Perfect. Here’s the **cutscene-style scene** of **Rembrandt Jones entering Elysium and meeting Jax for the first time**, written like it would appear in a high-quality narrative-driven video game — cinematic direction, lighting cues, emotional beats, and all.

## 🎞️ *Cutscene: “The Cool and the Canvas”*

**INT. ELYSIUM – FRONT ENTRANCE – NIGHT**

*The hum of conversation fades as the soft growl of an approaching engine seeps through the glass doors — low, throaty, vintage. A pair of headlights sweep across the marble floor as a **1955 Continental Mark II** rolls to a slow stop outside, chrome gleaming under the streetlights like liquid silver.*

**CUT TO:**
A close-up of the **license plate**, faintly rusted, embossed with the word:
**“REMJONES.”**

*The car door opens. A two-tone shoe hits the pavement, then another. A man steps out — slicked hair, velvet blazer, dark glasses at night. **Rembrandt Jones** straightens, swaying slightly, a cigarette dangling from his lips like he’s posing for a Sinatra album cover that never existed.*

**Rembrandt Jones (softly, to himself)**
“Still got it, baby. Still got it.”

*He takes in the building — the Elysium. The centerpiece of Phoenix’s undead society. His reflection dances across its glass doors, tinted gold by the chandeliers within. He fixes his tie, runs a hand through his hair, and smirks at his own reflection.*

**Rembrandt Jones**
“You and me, let’s make ‘em remember class.”

*The ghoul doorman opens the door before he can reach it. Rembrandt gives him a slow, dramatic nod — half thank-you, half encore bow — and saunters inside.*

### **INT. ELYSIUM MAIN HALL**

*The chatter returns, subdued but constant. The Toreador gather like stars in orbit around themselves. The Ventrue watch from the edges. The Brujah linger near the columns like restless shadows.*

*The camera tracks Rembrandt as he crosses the floor, his shoes clicking against the marble in perfect rhythm with the jazz bleeding faintly from the house speakers.*

Then — a *beat.* His gaze lands on **Jax**.

*Jax stands near one of the tall windows, hands in his jacket pockets, trying to look unimpressed. Streetborn. Coiled energy. A modern animal in an old-world palace.*

*The two lock eyes. The camera tightens — over-the-shoulder shots switching between them.*

**Rembrandt Jones (grinning, voice full of awe)**
“Would you look at that... You’re it. You’re the *moment.*”

*He points as if spotting a priceless painting.*

**Jax (flatly)**
“The hell you talkin’ about, old man?”

**Rembrandt (approaching, hands gesturing theatrically)**
“No, no, no—don’t move! That stance, that attitude, that... electric honesty. You’re all neon and shadow, baby. You’re the *new cool.*”

*He pulls a Polaroid camera from inside his coat — the kind that should’ve died decades ago — and snaps a picture before Jax can react. The flash lights up the hall, turning heads.*

**Rembrandt (delighted)**
“Ha! Perfect composition. You got Rat Pack soul and cyberpunk bones.”

**Jax (half-blinded, muttering)**
“I got half a mind to break that thing.”

**Rembrandt (beaming)**
“See? Even the threats have rhythm.”

*Nearby Kindred chuckle. A Harpy shakes her head, whispering, “He’s doing it again.” The Prince sighs from her balcony but doesn’t intervene.*

*Rembrandt claps Jax on the shoulder — a little too familiarly for Elysium — but the warmth is real.*

**Rembrandt (softly)**
“Don’t let them change you, kid. They’ll try to tell you what art’s supposed to be. You? You already *are* it.”

*Jax blinks, confused, halfway between annoyance and... curiosity.*

**Jax**
“You’re weird, man.”

**Rembrandt (grinning like it’s a compliment)**
“Baby, that’s what they said about Sinatra.”

*The jazz swells again as the camera pulls back — Rembrandt walking toward the bar, Jax watching after him, expression unreadable.*

**FADE OUT.**
