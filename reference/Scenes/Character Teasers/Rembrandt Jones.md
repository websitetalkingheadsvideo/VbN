Oh, this is a fantastic piece of character work — Rembrandt Jones is absolute gold for *Laws of the Night*; equal parts pathos and absurdity, exactly the kind of Toreador who enriches a scene just by existing. Let’s frame his **entrance into Elysium** like a cinematic game cutscene, in the same tone and visual rhythm as the others — stylish, melancholic, unintentionally brilliant.

# 🎞️ **Cutscene: “Rembrandt Jones Arrives at Elysium”**

**[FADE IN]**

**EXT. HAWTHORNE ESTATE – DRIVEWAY – NIGHT**

The camera pans across a sleek desert night. The moonlight glints off the polished chrome of a **1956 Continental Mark II** — the kind of car Frank Sinatra actually owned. It glides up the long desert driveway like a time machine, whitewalls crunching against gravel, its headlights slicing through the dry Arizona air.

The car stops beneath the portico, its idle rumbling low and elegant. The estate lights reflect off the glossy hood ornament — a shimmering halo of bygone glamour.

**SFX:** The soft *click* of a door opening. Jazz filters faintly from the car’s radio — Dean Martin crooning *“Ain’t That a Kick in the Head.”*

**CAMERA SHIFT – CLOSE ON REMBRANDT**

The man himself emerges — **Rembrandt Jones**, Toreador of the Rat Pack dream. His suit is sharp but dated, creased in all the wrong places, a powder-blue relic of 1963. His hair is slicked back with more effort than success. A gold cigarette case gleams as he fumbles with it, then tucks it away, realizing there’s no flame that won’t betray the Beast’s hunger.

He sways slightly — not drunk, not clumsy, just... out of time. The motion of a man who’s permanently moving to music no one else can hear.

**REMINGTON’S POV SHOT**

The grand facade of **The Hawthorne Estate** looms before him — columns glowing under warm floodlights, the distant hum of conversation drifting from within. A ghoul in a crisp tuxedo stands at the entrance — **the doorman**, expression neutral but knowing.

---

**CUT TO MEDIUM SHOT**

Rembrandt adjusts his lapel. Takes a breath. Grins, half-confident, half-desperate to be confident.

**REMBRANDT (under his breath):**
“Alright, Frankie, showtime.”

He steps forward, his gait a careful swagger. The camera follows from behind, tracking his movement up the stairs — each step slightly off-beat, as if the rhythm he’s chasing keeps slipping away.

---

**CAMERA – CLOSE ON DOORMAN**

The ghoul nods respectfully as Rembrandt approaches.

**DOORMAN (warmly, professional):**
“Good evening, Mister Jones.”

Rembrandt stops, gives him a finger-gun salute and a wink — all charm, no irony.

**REMBRANDT:**
“Evenin’, pal. Keepin’ the riffraff out?”

**DOORMAN (grinning):**
“As always, sir.”

Rembrandt pats him on the shoulder, missing slightly, then straightens his jacket.

---

**CAMERA – OVERHEAD TRACK**

The double doors open before him. Light spills out — golden, rich, full of chatter and perfume and politics. For a moment, Rembrandt stands framed in the doorway, haloed by light. He looks like he belongs... until he opens his mouth.

**REMBRANDT (calling out):**
“Alright, folks, the talent’s arrived!”

A few nearby Kindred glance over. Some smile indulgently. Others sigh. One Toreador Primogen murmurs to a companion:

**PRIMOGEN (quietly):**
“He’s still doing the act?”

**COMPANION:**
“He doesn’t know it’s an act.”

**[CUT TO]**

Rembrandt strolls in, hands in pockets, whistling softly to the tune only he can hear. His shadow stretches long across the marble floor as the camera pans upward — the chandelier glinting above, the murmurs of immortals surrounding him, the faint reflection of neon colors shimmering from his cufflinks.

**MUSIC CUE:** Soft jazz fades into a melancholic hum — a Rat Pack tune slowed to half-speed.

**ON-SCREEN TEXT (stylized subtitle):**
**“REMBRANDT JONES – Toreador of the Neon Age”**
*Too sincere to be ironic. Too oblivious to fail.*

**[FADE OUT]**
