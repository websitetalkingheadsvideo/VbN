### ?? *Opening Cutscene: “The Harpy Descends”*

**[INT. SCOTTSDALE ESTATE – POWDER ROOM – NIGHT]**

Soft amber light reflects off a gold-rimmed mirror. The frame, ornate and just slightly tarnished, captures **Cordelia Fairchild** as she adjusts a line of deep crimson lipstick — precise, unhurried, flawless. Her reflection watches itself with the same scrutiny she reserves for her prey.

Behind her stands **Mason**, her ghoul valet — pressed linen, white gloves, and expression schooled into silence. He offers her each item without prompting: powder compact, silver comb, silk handkerchief. She never speaks a word, and he never looks her in the eye.

> **Cordelia (quietly):**
> “Elegance is never accidental, Mason.”

She closes the compact with a crisp *click*.
The faint sound of tires on gravel carries through the walls — a long car, then another, the distant echo of laughter too bright for this hour.

**She pauses.**
A faint smile ghosts across her lips, reflected back a hundredfold in the gilt mirror.

> **Cordelia:**
> “At last, they arrive to be judged.”

**[CUT TO:]**

**The Grand Staircase** — white marble veined with gray, banister smooth from generations of careful polish. Cordelia glides down with deliberate grace, the sound of her heels measured — the tempo of expectation.

Below, the **doorman** straightens his jacket as headlights slice through the frosted windows. The front doors open in unison.

Two cars’ worth of Kindred step into the entry hall — jeweled gowns, black suits, all pretending not to care that the Harpy is already watching.

Cordelia halts halfway down the stairs, just where the chandelier light frames her in gold.
Every movement stops — even the murmurs fade.

She smiles again.
Not a greeting.
A reminder.

> **Cordelia:**
> “Good evening, darlings.
> You’re *late*.”

**[FADE OUT]**

Excellent — here’s the **GM / LARP Narration Version** of that scene, written so you can read or paraphrase it during session setup or in a teaser video.
This version emphasizes **what the players perceive** — tone, body language, emotional undercurrent — while leaving room for improvisation.

## ?? Scene Card: *The Harpy Descends*

**Setting:**
The opening of Elysium, early evening. Cordelia Fairchild’s Scottsdale estate. Guests are arriving.
Soft jazz filters from hidden speakers. The air smells faintly of rose and old money.

---

### **Scene Description (for players):**

As you step inside, the room already *feels* occupied — even before you see her.
There’s perfume in the air, expensive and subtle, and a hum of composure that presses into your thoughts. The chandeliers burn steady; the light is golden and warm, but somehow *judgmental*.

A whisper passes through the gathered Kindred:

> “She’s coming down.”

From the top of the grand staircase, **Cordelia Fairchild** appears — a vision framed by shadow and gold light. Every gesture is deliberate: the slight tilt of her head, the lazy grace of her hand on the banister, the faint pause as she allows the silence to stretch.

When her eyes pass over you, it feels like she’s flipping through a ledger, measuring worth in social currency and secret debts.
No Discipline use — or perhaps too subtle to notice — just Presence honed by centuries of practice.

She stops halfway down the stairs, ensuring every Kindred must *look up* to see her.
The doorman bows. The newcomers shift, uncertain.

Then she speaks, her voice smooth as poured wine:

> “Good evening, darlings. You’re late.”

A few Kindred laugh nervously, trying to curry favor by sharing in the joke.
The rest simply nod — the wise ones, who understand the Harpy’s greeting is never casual.
It’s a declaration: the night has begun, and *she* is the measure of it.

### **GM Notes:**

* **Disciplines in play:** Cordelia’s *Presence* is always active at Elysium, subtly amplifying her authority.
* **Tone:** She’s calm, confident, never rushed. Her control over the social atmosphere is absolute.
* **First impression:** Guests feel *evaluated*, not attacked. She’s not cruel — she’s *curating* the evening.
* **Hooks:**

  * Kindred who arrive late feel her gaze linger a little longer.
  * Anyone seeking to impress her can make a **Social Challenge** (Appearance + Etiquette) to read her reaction.
  * Nosferatu or Brujah may feel the old sting of disdain — she hides it well, but not perfectly.
