**EXT. DESERT OUTSKIRTS – NIGHT**

  > KERRY: “I know where he is… but it’ll take days to get there.”

### **Scene 4 – Obstacles & Foreshadowing**

**EXT. CANYON RIDGE – NIGHT**

* **Sequence:** Quick cuts to raise tension:

  * Rusted bridge over dry wash swaying.
  * Sudden gust blows sand into PC faces.
  * Faint red glimmer far ahead on cliff face.
* **Dialogue (Kerry, muttering):**

  > “They said he was gone… but I *heard* him. Every few years, the wind hits that cave just right, and it *talks*.”
* **Camera:** Close-ups on PCs’ eyes — fear, curiosity, doubt.

### **Scene 5 – Cave Entrance**

**EXT. HIDDEN CAVE – NIGHT**

* **Camera:** Slow push-in on narrow crack in rock; moonlight just touches the entrance.
* **Audio:** Silence, except for wind seeping through rocks. Faint metallic echo — stake tapping stone.
* **Action:** Kerry hesitates, hands shaking as he moves brush aside.
* **Dialogue:**

  > KERRY: “He’s still in there. I can feel him. Don’t… don’t look too long when you see him. He’ll look back.”
* **Camera:** Close-up on PCs’ hands pushing aside rubble, dust motes drifting in moonlight.

### **Scene 6 – Moment Before Revelation**

**INT. CAVE – NIGHT**

* **Camera:** Tight shot of stake protruding from the alcove, splintered and aged.
* **Audio:** Low heartbeat, rising slowly. Faint whispers, unintelligible, echoing off stone walls.
* **Visual Cue:** Shadow moves slightly — a ripple of something alive beneath stillness.

**End Scene / Cut:** Screen goes black for a beat, leaving audience/players holding tension.

> **Tagline Reinforced:** “Every choice awakens a secret.”

? **Notes for Gameplay:**

* Use lighting to maximize mystery: moonlight shafts, flashlights, torches.
* Sound design is crucial: wind, metallic echoes, faint whispering.
* Don’t reveal Elijah yet — let the PCs *feel his presence* before seeing him.
* Every PC decision during this trek (trusting Kerry, exploring, pacing themselves) should affect the tension and possible reactions when they finally encounter him.

If you want, I can **create the next act**, starting with **the first full reveal of Elijah** — including cinematic framing, PC reactions, his initial frenzy, and the tension of feeding or restraint — essentially completing the “awakening” sequence in shooting script style.

Do you want me to do that next?
