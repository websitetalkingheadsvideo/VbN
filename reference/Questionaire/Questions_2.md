# Camarilla Clan Selection Questionnaire - Post-Embrace Questions

---

**Question 11: The First Hunt**

You've been a vampire for three weeks. Your sire left you two nights ago with minimal instruction. The Beast gnaws at you - you need to feed. You spot a lone jogger on a dark trail, someone stumbling drunk from a bar, and a homeless person sleeping in an alley. All are vulnerable. The hunger intensifies with each passing moment.

**A)** You approach the drunk outside the bar, using conversation to lead them away from witnesses while appearing helpful and concerned.

**B)** You take the jogger immediately - fast, direct, trusting your newfound speed and strength to overwhelm them before they can scream.

**C)** You watch all three for nearly an hour, learning their patterns and the area's blind spots before making a calculated choice.

---

**Question 12: The Elysium Test**

It's your first night at Elysium. An elder you've never met approaches and asks, "Your sire never taught you proper etiquette, did they?" Others nearby have stopped talking to watch. You don't actually know what you did wrong, but the elder clearly expects an answer that will entertain the audience.

**A)** You apologize gracefully and ask the elder to enlighten you, turning the moment into an opportunity to learn while appearing humble.

**B)** You meet their eyes and respond that your sire taught you to value honesty over empty courtesy.

**C)** You remain perfectly still, observing everyone's reactions, saying nothing until you understand the real game being played.

---

**Question 13: The Masquerade Breach**

You're feeding in what you thought was a secluded parking garage when a security guard rounds the corner, flashlight in hand. Your victim is slumped against you, neck bleeding. The guard freezes, reaching for their radio. You have seconds before they call it in.

**A)** You drop the victim and immediately begin explaining - car accident, helping someone, please call an ambulance - while positioning yourself to control the situation.

**B)** You move before they can react, using your supernatural speed to ensure they can't make that call.

**C)** You lock eyes with them and speak, your voice carrying an unnatural weight that makes them reconsider everything they think they saw.

---

**Question 14: The Rival's Territory**

Another young vampire has been spreading word that you're weak, easy prey, and don't deserve your hunting grounds. Tonight, you find them in your territory, feeding on someone you'd been watching. They look up as you approach, blood on their mouth, and smile. "What are you going to do about it?"

**A)** You make note of exactly what they're doing and who might care, then walk away to report this breach through proper channels.

**B)** You answer their question physically, immediately and without words.

**C)** You stand at the edge of shadows, studying them until they grow uncomfortable, then leave without engaging.

---

**Question 15: The Unexpected Gift**

An elder you barely know sends you an expensive gift - a painting, a rare book, or jewelry worth thousands. There's no note, no explanation. Other kindred notice and start treating you differently, some with envy, others with suspicion. You don't know what this means or what's expected in return.

**A)** You research the elder extensively and arrange a formal meeting to thank them while carefully determining what they want.

**B)** You return the gift with a polite note saying you cannot accept what you haven't earned.

**C)** You keep the gift but change nothing about your behavior, watching to see who reacts and how.

---

**Question 16: The Dangerous Question**

You're at a gathering when a kindred you trust pulls you aside and whispers, "Do you think the Prince is making the right decisions?" You notice someone else within possible hearing range. The question feels like a trap, but your friend seems genuinely troubled and is waiting for your answer.

**A)** You deflect diplomatically, suggesting you discuss this somewhere more private while gauging whether your friend is testing you or truly concerned.

**B)** You say what you actually think - the Prince's decisions are theirs to make and yours to follow or leave the city.

**C)** You respond with a question that reveals nothing about your own position while learning what they really want to know.

---

**Question 17: The Failed Promise**

Your sire promised to introduce you to someone important who could help establish you in kindred society. The meeting was scheduled for tonight. Your sire doesn't show up, doesn't send word. You wait for three hours. You later hear they were seen across town at a party, laughing with others.

**A)** You arrange the introduction yourself through other connections, demonstrating you don't need your sire's help to advance.

**B)** You find them that night and make clear that abandoning you has consequences, sire or not.

**C)** You say nothing but begin building your own network separately, becoming less dependent on them with each passing night.

---

**Question 18: The Starving Night**

You haven't fed in four days. The Beast is screaming. You're at a crowded nightclub and everyone looks like prey. Your hands are shaking. A kindred you know slightly notices your state and offers you their wrist - fresh vitae, right now, but it means owing them. They're watching your reaction closely.

**A)** You accept gratefully but immediately begin planning how to repay this debt in a way that benefits you both.

**B)** You refuse and leave to hunt on your own, regardless of the risk of losing control.

**C)** You take what's offered without comment, filing away this moment and what it reveals about them.

---

**Question 19: The Domain Choice**

The Prince offers you formal permission to claim one of three territories as your domain. The first is wealthy and comfortable but already has established kindred nearby who might resent you. The second is rough but uncontested. The third is small but positioned between two powerful elders who will take notice of whoever claims it.

**A)** You choose the position between the elders, seeing the opportunity to build relationships with both.

**B)** You take the rough territory where you won't have to navigate anyone else's politics.

**C)** You request time to observe all three areas before deciding, ignoring the subtle pressure to choose immediately.

---

**Question 20: The Impossible Order**

Your sire orders you to do something that violates your personal code - destroy someone's reputation who helped you, betray a confidence, or harm an innocent. They offer no explanation beyond "because I command it." Refusing could mean severing the only connection you have in kindred society.

**A)** You do what's ordered but document everything, ensuring that if this comes back on you, the responsibility is clearly placed.

**B)** You refuse directly, making clear you'll face the consequences rather than compromise yourself.

**C)** You appear to comply while finding a way to achieve your sire's goal through methods that don't violate your principles.
