# Camarilla Clan Selection Questionnaire

---

**Question 1: The Cafeteria Humiliation**

It's lunch hour at your workplace cafeteria. You're in line when your ex-partner walks in with someone new - the same person they swore was "just a friend" during your relationship. Your ex loudly announces, "Oh look, there's the one I told you about," followed by laughter. Several coworkers turn to watch. Your ex brushes past you deliberately, still chuckling. The cafeteria has gone quiet.

**A)** You finish getting lunch calmly and spend the next week learning everything about their new relationship while carefully adjusting how others perceive them.

**B)** You follow them outside immediately and make clear such disrespect will not be tolerated.

**C)** You watch without reacting, cataloging every detail, knowing this information will be useful later.

---

**Question 2: The Parking Lot Confrontation**

You're walking to your car after work when you notice someone keying the driver's side door. As you get closer, you recognize them - a neighbor you've had ongoing disputes with about noise complaints. They see you approaching, drop the keys in their pocket, and stand their ground with arms crossed. Two other people are nearby loading groceries into their cars, clearly aware of what's happening.

**A)** You pull out your phone and calmly document the damage while asking them questions designed to get them to incriminate themselves on recording.

**B)** You feel the surge of anger and step forward, demanding they pay for damages right now or face the consequences.

**C)** You turn away without acknowledging them, already planning how to make their life systematically more difficult through official channels they won't see coming.

---

**Question 3: The Family Dinner Ambush**

You're at a family dinner when your sibling suddenly announces they've been offered your dream job - the position you've been working toward for three years. They knew you were interviewing for it. Everyone at the table congratulates them enthusiastically. Your parent says, "Well, I guess they just wanted someone more qualified." Your sibling smirks at you across the table while accepting praise.

**A)** You keep your expression neutral and spend the rest of dinner observing family dynamics, noting who supports whom and why.

**B)** You excuse yourself immediately, knowing if you stay you'll say something that can't be taken back.

**C)** You smile and raise your glass in a toast, already calculating how to position yourself for an even better opportunity while subtly undermining their success.

---

**Question 4: The Broken Promise**

Your best friend promised to help you move apartments this weekend - you've been planning it for a month. An hour before they're supposed to arrive, they text: "Sorry, got a better offer. Going to the beach instead. You understand, right?" You're standing in your half-packed apartment, the moving truck arrives in three hours, and you've already given notice to your landlord.

**A)** You text back something cordial and start calling other people, making note of who actually shows up when you need them.

**B)** You call them immediately, voice tight with anger, making it clear this friendship is over if they don't show up.

**C)** You say nothing, finish the move alone, and begin quietly distancing yourself while ensuring they feel the loss of your friendship in practical ways.

---

**Question 5: The Stolen Credit**

You're in a meeting where your manager presents "their" idea to upper management - except it's your idea, word-for-word from the proposal you sent them last week. They're getting praise and a potential promotion for it. They glance at you once during the presentation with a slight smile. Nobody else in the room knows this was originally yours.

**A)** You remain silent during the meeting, but immediately begin documenting everything and building a case to present to HR through proper channels.

**B)** You interrupt the presentation to point out that this was your idea, demanding credit in front of everyone present.

**C)** You let them have this moment while quietly building your own network above them, ensuring when you make your move, they have no support.

---

**Question 6: The Public Mockery**

You're at a bar with friends when someone from your past - a former bully from high school - recognizes you and starts loudly making fun of embarrassing things from years ago. Your current friends are watching. The bully is surrounded by their own group, clearly performing for them. Other patrons are starting to pay attention.

**A)** You smile politely and engage them in conversation, subtly steering the discussion to topics where you can make them look foolish without appearing aggressive.

**B)** You stand up and tell them exactly what you think of them, ready to physically back up your words if necessary.

**C)** You appear completely unbothered, almost detached, as if watching the situation from outside yourself while memorizing everything about them.

---

**Question 7: The Unexpected Betrayal**

You discover your romantic partner has been seeing someone else for months. Mutual friends knew but said nothing. When you confront your partner, they shrug and say, "You were too boring. I needed excitement." They're meeting the other person tonight at a restaurant you introduced them to. Your partner leaves, expecting no consequences.

**A)** You take a long walk to clear your head, then systematically separate your lives - finances, belongings, social circles - with surgical precision.

**B)** You show up at that restaurant tonight because they need to understand this doesn't end on their terms.

**C)** You withdraw into yourself, processing the betrayal privately while your mind catalogs patterns you missed and possibilities for what comes next.

---

**Question 8: The Ruined Opportunity**

You're waiting for an important job interview when another candidate - someone you know casually - walks by and "accidentally" spills coffee all over your clothes. They apologize profusely while obviously suppressing a smile. Your interview is in ten minutes. You're now stained and disheveled. The receptionist looks sympathetic but says nothing.

**A)** You ask to reschedule, explaining what happened while remaining professional, then research everything about this person for future reference.

**B)** You walk into the interview exactly as you are and use the incident to demonstrate how you handle unexpected problems under pressure.

**C)** You clean up as best you can and go into the interview, but you're already planning how to ensure this person never succeeds in this industry.

---

**Question 9: The Manipulated Reputation**

You hear from multiple sources that someone has been spreading false rumors about you - claiming you're unreliable, dishonest, and difficult to work with. You trace it back to a colleague who smiled to your face yesterday. The damage is already done; people are treating you differently. You have a major project presentation next week that could define your career.

**A)** You focus entirely on making your presentation flawless while carefully rebuilding relationships one conversation at a time.

**B)** You confront them directly in front of witnesses, forcing them to either admit the lies or defend them publicly.

**C)** You say nothing but begin collecting evidence of their own misconduct, knowing the truth will surface when you choose to reveal it.

---

**Question 10: The Undeserved Reward**

Your sibling just inherited your grandmother's house - the one you helped care for, visited weekly, and maintained for years. Your sibling visited twice in the last decade but was always your grandmother's "favorite." At the will reading, they don't even look at you. Your parents say, "She made her choice. Don't make this awkward."

**A)** You accept it publicly with grace, then quietly work through legal channels to ensure the estate is handled fairly regarding other assets.

**B)** You walk out immediately, cutting contact with everyone involved until they acknowledge what's wrong with this.

**C)** You attend the funeral and family events as if nothing happened, studying everyone's reactions and relationships, storing it all away.
