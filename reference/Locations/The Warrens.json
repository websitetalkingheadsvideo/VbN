  "summary": "Massive decommissioned WWII-era Army Air Corps bunker complex serving as Nosferatu Primogen Alistaire's primary haven and the nerve center of Phoenix Nosferatu operations.",
  "description": "The Warrens is a three-level underground bunker complex built during the WWII buildup as a secret Army Air Corps experimental facility tasked with developing innovative aircraft spotting methods. Decommissioned after the Korean Conflict in 1953, it was officially scheduled for demolition but Alistaire manipulated paperwork through bureaucratic influence to make the Air Force believe it was destroyed. The facility spans approximately 15,000 square feet across three descending levels, all reinforced with military-grade concrete and steel. Level 1 contains the main computer room, common areas, and access tunnels connecting to the Phoenix sewer system. Level 2 houses private quarters for residents (Alistaire, Terry, Betty, Core, Phreak) and the ghouls (Earl and Dale). Level 3 contains storage, maintenance systems, the animal feeding area for hunting returns from nearby hills, and Alistaire's private sanctum. The complex maintains perfect climate control at 68Â°F year-round through original military HVAC systems maintained by the ghoul custodians. Multiple entry points exist: the main entrance with remote-controlled reinforced doors (garage-door style), emergency exits hidden in the surrounding area, and sewer connections that lead to various parts of the Phoenix underground. The entire facility is completely sunlight-protected and maintains the institutional gray paint and utilitarian aesthetic of its 1940s military origins. Alistaire's rat network (Animalism 5) provides constant organic surveillance throughout all levels, while modern camera systems installed by Betty add electronic security. The surrounding area is kept clear of homeless and trespassers by Earl and Dale's regular patrols.",
  "notes": "Acquired 1954 through bureaucratic manipulation - altered Air Force records to show 'demolished'. Maintained through Influence backgrounds (controlling surrounding area). Original purpose: experimental aircraft spotting program that accomplished little. Has housed Alistaire since 1954 (40 years). Terry joined 1952. Core and Phreak arrived 1988-1989. Betty embraced 1993. Current residents: 5 Nosferatu (Alistaire, Terry, Betty, Core, Phreak) and 2 ghouls (Earl, Dale). Serves as Phoenix Nosferatu information hub and Shrecknet node. Connected to wider sewer system but all access points heavily secured. Most other Kindred believe Alistaire lives in Mesa storm drains (deliberate misdirection).",

Only 7 individuals permitted: Alistaire (owner/Primogen), Terry (childe, scout), Betty (childe, security chief), Dennis 'Core' Barsley (systems programmer), Kevin 'Phreak' Jamison (security/penetration), Earl (ghoul custodian), Dale (ghoul custodian). Violet occasionally visits but must be escorted and cannot access all levels. Remote-controlled doors require authorization codes. Biometric systems for ghouls. Alistaire uses Obfuscate to enter/exit. Multiple redundant security layers on each level.",

Computers: Level 1 main computer room - cutting-edge 1994 tech including DEC Alpha servers, Sun SPARC workstations, multiple high-speed modems, T1 Internet lines, Shrecknet hub nodes, custom BBS systems, extensive networking equipment. Library: Level 2 contains extensive technical documentation, Unix/networking manuals, hacking references, Nosferatu information archives, historical records. Medical: basic first aid and emergency supplies (mostly for ghouls). Workshop: Level 3 electronics repair, hardware hacking station (Phreak's tools), general maintenance equipment, HVAC system access. Hidden caches: throughout all three levels - emergency supplies, backup data storage, weapons. Armory: Level 3 contains weapons storage (mostly for ghoul security, Alistaire rarely needs them). Communications: Multiple redundant phone lines, T1 Internet connection, encrypted channels, Shrecknet network, connection to wider Nosferatu intelligence network, early email/BBS systems.",
  "social_features": "Not designed for socializing or entertaining - purely functional operations center. Weekly Nosferatu meetings held in Level 1 common area (usually brief per Alistaire's preference). Informal brainstorming sessions happen in computer room when technical questions arise. Level 2 private quarters allow residents personal space. No Elysium functions or formal gatherings. Occasional visits from Violet for information exchange. Terry reports findings from his scouting. Atmosphere is professional, focused, quiet - this is a workplace and haven, not a social venue.",
