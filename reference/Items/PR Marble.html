Trait,Detail
Name,Veritas (or: The PR Marble)
Type,Enchanted Marble (Occult Artifact)
Appearance,"A smooth, polished marble sphere, roughly the size of a billiard ball. It has a faint, internal crystalline structure. James Whitmore often fiddles with it as an affectation when he is bored or listening intently."
Origin,Found by James Whitmore in New York City during his mortal PR career in the 1960s.
Mechanics,"Truth Detection. If the holder is conscious and the marble is in their hand, Veritas will emit a faint, soft white glow when a person speaking within 10 feet tells a lie and has a Mental Attribute (Intelligence, Wits, or Perception) that is lower than the holder's."
Limitation,"The detection effect can only be activated once every 24 hours (resets at sunset). Once activated by a lie, the marble is dormant until the next night."
Current Holder,James Whitmore (Regent)
Use in Game,Used by Whitmore to assess the trustworthiness of Kindred and kine during political negotiations. This limitation forces him to choose his moment carefullyâ€”he must decide which person's lie is most critical to expose or confirm in a given night.
