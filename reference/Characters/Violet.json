    "biography": "Before her Embrace, Violet was a small-time grifter running cons in alleys and backstreets. Her sharp tongue and fearless attitude caught the attention of a Nosferatu who saw potential in her survival instincts. Fifteen years later, she has turned those same hustler skills into a thriving network of informants across the city. Her lair lies beneath an abandoned subway line, furnished with scavenged comforts and monitored by hidden cameras. Violet trades information for favors, protects her street people like a wary aunt, and never lights the cigarettes she carries. She has a soft spot for addicts and runaways, though she refuses to feed on them. To the Kindred of the city, Violet is a gossip, a survivor, and an unpredictable wildcard whose knowledge can make or break reputations.",
