  "biography": "Originally generation 10, Piston committed diablerie on a Gangrel during the Los Angeles Anarch faction wars (late 1980s/early 1990s). A former Hell's Angels member embraced in mid-1980s LA by Fred Osmond, he adapted to Kindred life while maintaining his biker identity. He found the Anarch philosophy aligned with Hell's Angels anti-authority stance. During the LA Anarch Free State internal faction wars, he rose in power through combat prowess. In late 80s/early 90s during a gang clash, he frenzied in combat with a Gangrel enforcer. The Beast took over and he committed diablerie, gaining Fortitude but acquiring the mark. LA became too dangerous after the diablerie - Gangrel wanted revenge, faction was divided. He fled to Phoenix early-to-mid 1990s, established in Surprise, and embraced two former Hell's Angels (Butch Reed and Basher) to rebuild brotherhood. Now running criminal operations to fund acquisition of a bar.",
