    "biography": "Dealer at The Sands casino in late 1950s/early 1960s Las Vegas. Obsessively attended Rat Pack shows 3+ times per week for years, even after his Embrace. Embraced during Rat Pack era (late 50s/early 60s) by a Las Vegas Toreador who created gaudy casino strip art and saw potential in Rembrandt's obsessive dedication to beauty. Has been a vampire for 30-35 years. Sire subtly encouraged him to leave Vegas and move to Phoenix (paid him, made it appealing) because while he saw potential, Rembrandt became something... unexpected. Now lives in small bungalow west of Camelback Mountain. Accidentally stumbled into Roadside Americana/kitschy nostalgia subculture where his work is actually appreciated, but remains oblivious to this success while desperately trying to impress mainstream Toreador scene and the Primogen. His failure at being a 'proper' Toreador is so complete and earnest that it has become its own form of performance art - a living masterpiece he will never understand. Sire sends him short poems about art every few months, trying to guide him; Rembrandt misinterprets them completely and uses them as inspiration for his next terrible piece.",

      "notes": "COMIC RELIEF CHARACTER. His complete failure at being a 'proper' Toreador is an art form itself - a living performance piece. Technically skilled enough to be a master art thief (Security 4, Stealth 3, Auspex 3, Dexterity traits) but uses skills to protect/acquire terrible art. Gets entranced by wrong things: fluorescent light buzz, gas station hot dog rollers, inflatable tube men, bad taxidery, 80s airbrushed vans, shopping cart sounds. His photography is technically brilliant but focuses on 'wrong' subjects (drainage grates, rust patterns, parking lot geometry). LED sculptures are technically flawless but aesthetically questionable. Can sell anything due to Subterfuge 4 + Awe + genuine passion. Thinks he's a 'lone wolf' (others find it silly/endearing). On verge of realizing his Roadside Americana community actually appreciates him - potential chronicle hook. Toreador Primogen fascinated but doesn't realize what he truly is (blind spot for non-high-art). If he becomes self-aware, does the art die? High Courage (4) is his defining virtue - keeps trying despite rejection."

      "sire_relationship": "Sire embraced him seeing potential in obsessive dedication. Now demoralized watching him fail. But occasionally Rembrandt creates something almost good (striking photo, perfect LED sculpture) and sire's hope rises. Then Rembrandt follows with velvet Elvis. Cycle continues.
