  "biography": "Barry Horowitz spent fifteen years as a traveling salesman for industrial machinery, mine equipment, and environmental cleanup systems throughout the American Southwest. His territory covered Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and parts of California - endless miles of highway, roadside diners, cheap motels, and the kinds of Americana that most people drive past without noticing. He was good at his job. Not great, but good. He could read a room, find common ground with a mine foreman or a corporate purchasing agent, and close a deal more often than not.\n\nIn early 1994, Barry's route took him to Prescott, Arizona. Wrong place, wrong time. The Sabbat were conducting a mass Embrace - the brutal practice of creating multiple shovelheads simultaneously, burying them, and seeing who claws their way out. Barry was grabbed off the street, drained, fed vitae, and buried in a shallow grave outside town with a dozen others.\n\nHe rose late. Very late. By the time Barry dug himself out of the earth, confused and terrified, the Sabbat had already moved on. They assumed he hadn't survived the Embrace. Barry spent three nights walking through the desert in a daze, his new instincts barely keeping him alive, not understanding what had happened to him. He followed highways south by instinct, drawn toward the lights of Phoenix.\n\nThe Sheriff found him on the outskirts of North Phoenix - a dirt-covered, starving, confused fledgling who clearly had no idea what he was. After determining Barry wasn't a Sabbat operative (just incredibly unlucky), the Sheriff brought him before Prince Mansfield. By all rights, Barry should have been executed - a clanless unknown with no sire, no lineage, no place in Camarilla society.\n\nBut Barry's natural social skills saved him. Even terrified and covered in desert dust, his salesman instincts kicked in. He was respectful, grateful, genuine. He didn't demand anything or claim rights he didn't have. He simply asked to understand what had happened to him and expressed profound gratitude for being saved. The Prince saw potential utility in a Caitiff who was genuinely grateful and socially competent.\n\nPrince Mansfield assigned Barry to Rembrandt Jones's care, using a medium boon owed to make it official. Rembrandt was told to teach Barry the basics of Kindred society, Camarilla protocol, and how to survive. For the past six months, Barry has been Rembrandt's student and responsibility.\n\nBarry knows several important truths: He's alive (undead) only because the Prince chose to spare him. He has no clan, which makes him lesser in most Kindred eyes. Rembrandt is teaching him because the Prince ordered it, but Rembrandt seems to genuinely care about doing a good job. And something happened during his Embrace that gave him the ability to manipulate shadows - a power that makes other Kindred look at him with suspicion and fear.\n\nHe's spent six months learning to navigate this new existence. Rembrandt has been patient and enthusiastic, teaching him Auspex and Presence, explaining Camarilla customs, and introducing him to other Kindred. Barry has learned that his shadow-power (Obtenebration, Rembrandt called it with an uncomfortable expression) is associated with the Sabbat, specifically the Lasombra clan. He's learned to keep it hidden, to only use it in absolute emergencies.\n\nBarry's strategy is simple: be useful, be grateful, be likable. Prove that sparing him was the right choice. His years as a salesman taught him how to read people, find what they need, and position himself as the solution. He applies those same skills to Kindred society, even as he learns that vampire politics run deeper and darker than any corporate negotiation he ever navigated.\n\nHe genuinely likes Rembrandt. Yes, he's figured out that Rembrandt is... different... from other Toreador. The enthusiastic explanations about LED light sculptures and roadside Americana, the sincere appreciation for things other Kindred seem to mock, the earnest way Rembrandt approaches everything - Barry recognizes that Rembrandt might not be the most typical mentor. But Rembrandt has been kind, patient, and genuinely invested in Barry's success. That means everything to someone who was buried alive by monsters and left to die.\n\nBarry knows he's walking a tightrope. Caitiff are barely tolerated in Camarilla society. He has a Sabbat discipline that marks him as dangerous and potentially corrupted. He has no lineage, no clan backing, no natural allies. But he's survived worse odds. He survived the Embrace when others didn't. He survived three nights in the desert. He survived meeting the Prince. He can survive this too.\n\nHe just has to stay useful, stay grateful, and prove he belongs.",
