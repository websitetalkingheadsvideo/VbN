# The Story of Rembrandt Jones
## The Mortal Years (1930s - Late 1950s)
Born in the 1930s, the man who would become Rembrandt Jones grew up during the Depression and came of age in post-war America. He drifted to Las Vegas in the early 1950s, drawn by the neon lights and the promise of something glamorous. He found work as a dealer at The Sands, one of the most prestigious casinos on the Strip.
But dealing cards was just his job. His *passion* was the Rat Pack.
Frank Sinatra. Dean Martin. Sammy Davis Jr. When they performed at The Sands, he was there. Three times a week, sometimes more. For years. He memorized their movements, their style, their effortless cool. He studied the way they held a room, the way they made sophistication look easy. He wanted to be like them - smooth, cultured, appreciated for understanding beauty and class.
The problem was, he didn't quite understand what made them work.
## The Embrace (Late 1950s/Early 1960s)
His sire was a Toreador who created gaudy art for the Vegas casinos - elaborate, glittering, profitable kitsch for the tourist crowds. The sire noticed this young man who showed up religiously to every Rat Pack show, who spoke with such passion about the "artistry" of their performances, who had such genuine, obsessive dedication to what he perceived as beauty.
The sire saw potential. Or maybe he saw profit - someone who could help create more of the lucrative casino art that paid so well.
One night, for reasons the sire would later claim were intentional, he Embraced the young dealer. He gave him the name Rembrandt Jones - sophisticated, artistic, impressive. The kind of name a Toreador should have.
## The Unintended Masterpiece (1960s - 1970s)
The Embrace changed him, but not in the way the sire expected.
Rembrandt Jones became *more* himself. His passion intensified. His dedication to beauty became absolute. His certainty in his artistic vision became unshakeable.
The problem - from the sire's perspective - was that his vision was terrible.
He loved the neon signs. Not ironically, not as kitsch, but genuinely, deeply, as high art. He photographed gas station architecture with the devotion of Ansel Adams shooting Yosemite. He collected velvet paintings like they were Rembrandts (the irony of his name was lost on him). He created LED light sculptures that were technically perfect but depicted shopping mall aesthetics.
His sire watched in growing horror and fascination. This wasn't what he'd planned. But after a while, the sire began to wonder... had he accidentally created something brilliant? A living deconstruction of Toreador aesthetics? A performance piece critiquing the very notion of artistic taste?
The sire started telling people it was intentional. "I created him as conceptual art," he'd say. Inside, he wasn't sure.
## The Vegas Years (1960s - Early 1980s)
For two decades, Rembrandt Jones existed in the Las Vegas Toreador scene as a lovable disaster. He still attended shows obsessively, now forever frozen in that Rat Pack era aesthetic. He tried so hard to be smooth, sophisticated, cultured.
He failed spectacularly and consistently.
He'd get Entranced by the geometric patterns in casino carpets during important meetings. He'd present "gifts" to elders - bedazzled picture frames, airbrushed wolf paintings, commemorative plates. He'd give passionate lectures on the artistic merit of vintage slot machine design.
Some Toreadors found him insufferable. Others found him fascinating. A few pretentious academics began writing papers about him, though he never read them.
His sire grew increasingly... conflicted. Watching Rembrandt was demoralizing. But every so often, Rembrandt would create something that was *almost* good. A photograph that was genuinely striking, if you ignored what it depicted. An LED sculpture with perfect technical execution, even if the subject matter was baffling. In those moments, the sire's hope would rise: "Maybe he'll finally understand..."
Then Rembrandt would follow it up with another velvet Elvis, and the cycle would continue.
## The Exile (Early 1980s)
By the early 1980s, the sire had had enough. Not angry - never angry. Just... tired. Demoralized. He couldn't watch anymore.
So he made it easy for Rembrandt to leave. Suggested Phoenix might be a good place for a "fresh start." Set him up with a trust fund and investments (the sire was wealthy from all that casino art money). Made it sound like an opportunity rather than an exile.
Rembrandt went willingly. He was always drawn to whatever shiny thing caught his attention, and a new city meant new subjects to photograph, new "artistic communities" to join, new galleries to visit.
His sire was relieved. And sad. And still not entirely sure what he'd created.
## Phoenix: The Accidental Community (1980s - 1994)
In Phoenix, Rembrandt found a small bungalow in an old neighborhood west of Camelback Mountain. He filled it with his collection - lava lamps, neon beer signs, vintage motel memorabilia, thousands upon thousands of photographs.
He thought he was a "lone wolf" (like the Rat Pack guys - cool, independent, mysterious). Everyone else found this adorable and slightly silly.
But something interesting happened in Phoenix, something Rembrandt didn't quite notice:
He found his people.
Not the Toreador Primogen he desperately tried to impress. Not the mainstream art scene that politely tolerated him.
The **Roadside Americana subculture**.
Collectors of Muffler Men statues. Vintage motel sign preservationists. Route 66 nostalgists. Googie architecture enthusiasts. People who genuinely appreciated vintage Vegas memorabilia and the aesthetic of mid-century roadside attractions.
They *got* him. His photography made sense to them. His LED sculptures of vintage casino signs were appreciated. His passion for preserving "forgotten American beauty" resonated.
He sold pieces to them for good money. They invited him to shows and conventions. They valued his work.
But Rembrandt barely noticed. He was too focused on trying to impress "real" Toreadors, trying to prove himself in "high art" circles, trying to be the sophisticated vampire he thought he should be.
## The Feeding (Ongoing)
He has 2-3 regular people he feeds from - probably people from his Roadside Americana community who find him endearing. They know what he is. They're into it.
Rembrandt thinks he's being smooth and mysterious with elaborate seduction techniques inherited from watching too many Rat Pack films.
They think it's adorable how bad he is at pretending. They go along with it because they genuinely like him, and maybe that Awe discipline helps a little.
## The Sire's Letters (Every Few Months)
His sire sends him short poems about art. Beautiful, meaningful verses trying to teach, to guide, to reach through the distance.
Rembrandt reads them. Misinterprets them completely. Thinks his sire is being supportive and encouraging. Uses them as inspiration for his next terrible piece.
The sire weeps.
The sire doesn't need to pay him to stay away or actively exile him. Whatever shiny thing catches Rembrandt's eye keeps him naturally distracted. "I need to photograph every vintage motel sign in Arizona!" "There's a roadside dinosaur statue I MUST see!"
The cycle continues.
## The Present (1994)
Rembrandt Jones has been in Phoenix for over a decade. He's 60+ years as a vampire, chronologically from the 1930s, forever frozen in Rat Pack-era aesthetics and sensibilities.
He's technically skilled enough to be a master art thief (Security 4, Stealth 3, Auspex 3, perfect dexterity). He protects his collection with sophisticated systems. He could case and rob galleries if he wanted.
He uses these skills to acquire and protect terrible art.
He's a master salesman (Subterfuge 4, Presence/Awe) who can convince people his work is valuable. And in the Roadside Americana community, it genuinely is. He makes good money selling to them.
But he doesn't realize this is where he belongs. He's still trying to impress the Toreador Primogen, still trying to fit into mainstream art circles, still trying to be the sophisticated Toreador he thinks he should be.
He's Clumsy x2 - things go wrong around him constantly. But he has Luck as a merit, so somehow it works out. The universe is keeping him alive.
Maybe because he's accidentally art.
## The Tragedy
Some of the pretentious Toreador theorists see what he is. They write papers: "He's deconstructing Toreador identity through lived experience." "His anti-aesthetic is commentary on the commodification of beauty."
The Primogen is torn between fascination and tolerance. She doesn't fully realize what she's watching yet. Her blind spot is that she only recognizes "high art" - she can't see that the Roadside Americana subculture is where he's actually successful and valued.
Rembrandt himself is on the verge of an epiphany. Somewhere deep down, he's starting to notice that his Roadside Americana friends actually appreciate him. That he's happy when he's with them. That maybe he doesn't need the approval he's chasing.
But here's the central question: **If he becomes self-aware, does the art die?**
His earnest obliviousness is what makes him a masterpiece. His genuine belief in his terrible taste. His complete lack of irony. His passionate sincerity.
If he ever realizes he's failed at being a "proper" Toreador, if he ever understands what he truly is, does that ruin it?
Or could he find genuine happiness in accepting himself and his community?
## The Meta-Layer
Rembrandt Jones is a living artwork that can never know what it is.
His failure at being a Toreador is so complete, so consistent, so perfectly authentic that it transcends into genuine artistry. He is a performance piece that has run for 60+ years without the performer knowing he's on stage.
His sire may have created him. Or his sire may have stumbled into creating him and is pretending it was intentional.
Either way, Rembrandt Jones continues. Taking photographs of drainage grates. Getting Entranced by fire extinguishers. Bringing terrible gifts to elders. Creating technically perfect LED sculptures of gas station signs.
Trying so hard.
Never quite getting it.
And somehow, accidentally, being exactly what he needs to be.

**That's the story of Rembrandt Jones. A comedy. A tragedy. An artwork that doesn't know it exists.**
