### Role in the Chronicle (1994 Context)

Bane-Howl is a terrifying manifestation of the Garou Nation's disgust with the Kindred presence in Phoenix.

1.  **Territorial Imperative:** He views the dry riverbeds, canals, and surrounding desert mesas as **sacred territory** (possibly a fragmented or defiled caern). In 1994, these areas are easily accessible and feel *wild*, giving him a massive home-field advantage. The canals are his highways, and the dense shadows of the sprawling city's edge are his cover.
2.  **Mission of Disruption:** Bane-Howl is likely an aggressive scout or a punishment-detail warrior sent by a powerful Sept (perhaps from northern Arizona or the Grand Canyon) to **disrupt the Phoenix Kindred** while they are in chaos. His mission is not subtle espionage; it's to sow terror and destabilize the Camarilla to make the city easier to cleanse later.
3.  **The Lupus Factor:** As a Lupus (Wolf-born), he struggles to comprehend human society, relying primarily on scent and instinct. This explains why he doesn't use the simple *1994 technology* of the Kindred, and why he relies on sheer overwhelming power rather than infiltration.
4.  **Connection to the Prince's Secret:**
    * **The Witness:** He may have been in the Superstition Mountains on the night the Prince was staked. He didn't intervene (Kindred killing Kindred is *good*), but he has a primal knowledge of the betrayal.
    * **The Hunter:** He is hunting **Kerry** because Kerry carries the lingering scent of that initial crime, the scent of the grave, or perhaps the scent of **Dale's** treachery‚Äîsomething the Garou can instinctively recognize as profanity or corruption. Kerry is a distraction, but the *smell* on him is what matters.

This version makes him a more compelling and difficult threat in the Arizona environment. Does this feel right for your game?
