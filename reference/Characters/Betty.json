  "biography": "Embraced in 1989 at age 22, fresh out of her Computer Science degree. Betty was a brilliant programmer who caught Alistaire's attention while working on cutting-edge networking protocols. He saw the future of information warfare and Embraced her to give the Phoenix Nosferatu a technological edge.\n\nAs a one-year-old fledgling in 1990, Betty is intensely grateful for her Embrace - viewing it as winning the lottery. She received immortality, unlimited access to cutting-edge technology, and a budget rivaling major tech companies. Her Nosferatu curse manifests as 'The Living Terminal' - her skin glows with CRT phosphorescence, fiber-optic filaments grow from her scalp and arms, her fingertips have hardened into connector pins, and her eyes display scan lines when focused.\n\nBetty largely ignores vampire society politics, focusing entirely on building systems and pushing technological boundaries. She coordinates the three-person Nosferatu tech team (herself, #3, and #4) working on Shrecknet development, making Phoenix a crucial node in the emerging global vampire information network. She's the most social of the three, handling all external communication and system architecture decisions while her teammates handle deep technical implementation.\n\nShe operates from Alistaire's bunker haven, monitoring the decoy storm drain location and running surveillance across his domain. Her relationship with her 'brother' Terry is one of respectful indifference - he doesn't understand her 'magic boxes' but trusts her intelligence, and she doesn't need him to understand packet sniffing to appreciate his street-level reconnaissance skills.\n\nBetty specializes in both Microsoft and Unix systems, making her dual-platform expertise rare and valuable. Any company in the Phoenix metro area is vulnerable to her team's hacking capabilities. She's obsessed with the future of technology, constantly theorizing about networking, AI, and digital communication - making predictions that sound insane in 1990 but will prove eerily accurate.",

Uses Obfuscate to install surveillance equipment, Animalism for backup 'sensors' (rats as living cameras), and Potence for server maintenance. \n\nRoleplaying: Enthusiastic about technology, dismissive of vampire politics, grateful to Alistaire. Voice has slight static undertone. Eyes flicker with scan lines when deeply focused. Speaks in mix of technical jargon and accessible explanations depending on audience.\n\nKey Relationships: Coordinates with Nosferatu #3 (Gen 12) and #4 (Gen 13) on Shrecknet. Respectful but distant relationship with Terry. Devoted to Alistaire's vision.\n\nMechanical Notes: As Gen 9, she has Blood Pool 20 and can spend 2 blood per turn. Her Nosferatu appearance penalty is severe - she must use Obfuscate or Mask of 1000 Faces for social interaction with non-Nosferatu. Monitors decoy storm drain haven remotely."
