  "biography": "Embraced in 1794 Paris during the revolutionary period, Étienne Duvalier has spent two centuries cultivating beauty, taste, and social influence across Europe and America. As Toreador Primogen in Phoenix, he dominates the local and national art scenes with unrivaled magnetism and centuries of refined charm. He maintains a penthouse loft above a restored theatre in downtown Mesa, where he curates not just art but society itself. His relationship with Prince Solomon Reaves is one of barely concealed contempt wrapped in perfect civility - he commands the city through culture while the Prince commands through politics. Étienne is training Sebastian and Sabine (the twins) alongside Cordelia Prescott as part of his grand plan to eventually take over New York Kindred society with a cultivated power bloc. He cannot abide imperfection and often rearranges objects or seating mid-conversation to 'improve symmetry.' His voice is hypnotic, his presence commanding, and to disappoint him is social death among Toreador.",

Barely conceals contempt for Prince Solomon Reaves - 'The Prince commands the city. I compose it.' Professional respect with Seneschal (forbidden friendship). Admires Christopher Duvall's precision but dislikes utilitarian aesthetics. Revered and feared by Toreador neonates. Behavioral quirks: lowers voice when others raise theirs, rearranges objects/seating mid-conversation for symmetry, shifts languages mid-sentence for nuance, sketches guests in document margins to 'capture posture.' Presence 5 (Majesty) makes him nearly untouchable in social settings. Lives in penthouse loft above restored theatre in downtown Mesa. Art History 4, Crafts (Sculpture) 5, speaks 7 languages fluently. 'Perfection is not a goal - it is the absence of noise.'"
