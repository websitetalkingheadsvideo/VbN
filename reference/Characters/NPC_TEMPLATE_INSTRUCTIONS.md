## Database Compatibility

All fields in this template directly map to database tables:

- `character_traits` table
- `character_abilities` table
- `character_disciplines` table
- `character_backgrounds` table
- `character_morality` table
- `character_merits_flaws` table
- `character_equipment` table
- `character_influences` table

The JSON file can be imported directly into the database system.

## Tips

1. **Keep it simple**: For minor NPCs, you don't need to fill every field
2. **Be consistent**: Use the same trait names that appear in the system
3. **Power levels**: Make sure discipline powers match their level (don't list level 4 power at discipline level 2)
4. **Balance**: NPCs should fit their role (elder = powerful, neonate = weak)
5. **Story first**: Focus on biography and concept, stats come second
