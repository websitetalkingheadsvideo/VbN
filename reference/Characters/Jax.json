    "biography": "Jax was a street hustler before the Embrace, peddling fake charms, talismans, and minor scams. Their Ravnos sire saw the potential to combine illusion and charisma, granting them Chimerstry to enhance their tricks. Now, Jax runs small-time psychic scams across the city, selling ghost removals, haunted trinkets, and protection spells. Some of their illusions have begun acting independently, creating problems Jax cannot fully control. Their personality is chaotic, charming, and unpredictable. They are androgynous in appearance, with bright eyes, shaved sides, colorful scarves, and ash-stained hands. Despite their bravado, a gnawing fear that something they created is now stalking them drives much of their behavior.",
