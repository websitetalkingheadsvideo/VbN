Perfect! Let me work with this:

## 1. Pistol Pete's Cars


**My recommendations:**
- **Classic:** 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T (most iconic)
- **80s:** 1987 Buick Grand National GNX (heavily modified turbo monster)
- **94:** 1994 Camaro Z28 (brand new, street racing build)

**Garage:** Just off Camelback, closer to Tempe

## 2. Bayside Bob - Full Profile

**Name:** "Bayside Bob"
**Clan:** Toreador
**Concept:** Ex-Coast Guard Recruiter turned Tiki Bar Owner

**Background:**
- Served in Coast Guard
- Last posting: Recruiter, Phoenix office (landlocked irony!)
- "Bayside" nickname from Coast Guard days (only he knows the real story)
- Embraced sometime before 1981
- Arrived Phoenix early 1981 (13 years by 1994)

**The Bali Hai:**
- Tiki-style Polynesian restaurant on Camelback Road
- Front for Anarch meetings
- **Dying business** - Tiki craze faded, customer numbers dropping
- May convert to "Private Club" if decline continues
- De facto Anarch gathering place

**Personality:**
- **WAY more laid back than Pete**
- Toreador who appreciates vintage Americana/Tiki culture
- If Anarchs need to vote on leader, probably him
- Not ambitious, just keeps things running

## 3. The Sympathizer
**[Reminder set: Create Camarilla sympathizer who calls Anarchs]**

---

## 4. Anarch Structure

**Current Anarchs:**
- **Pistol Pete** (Brujah, street enforcer)
- **Bayside Bob** (Toreador, de facto meeting place owner)
- **2 more you're writing up**
- **Maybe 2 more** (total 6 maximum)

**Leadership:**
- Not organized enough for Baron
- If forced to choose: Bayside Bob (more laid back, diplomatic)
- Pete is too hot-headed for leadership

---

## 5. First Night Response

**The Decision: "Watch and See"**
- Initial reaction: Something is happening...
- Actual response: Watch for a couple days
- Classic Anarch - talk big, move cautiously
- Opportunity? Threat? Unknown.

**PC Hook:**
- After first night, PC can look for Anarchs
- Eventually led to **Bali Hai** on Camelback
- Find them mid-discussion/planning
- Entry point to Anarch perspective

---

**Questions:**

1. **Which cars do you like for Pete?** My suggestions or different ones?

2. **Bayside Bob's disciplines?** Toreador clan (Auspex, Celerity, Presence) - what levels?

3. **Why DID Bob get called "Bayside"?** Want to establish the story or keep it mysterious?

4. **The other 2 Anarchs you're writing** - want to share what you have so far?

5. **Pete's garage location** - does it have a name? Just "Pete's place"?

What next?
