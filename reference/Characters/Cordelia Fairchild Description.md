# Cordelia Fairchild

## Physical Appearance

Cordelia Prescott appears as a woman in her mid-thirties with **pale, angular features** - sharp cheekbones, strong jawline, and intelligent gray eyes that assess everything with cool calculation. Her dark hair is pulled severely back into a tight Victorian-style bun at the nape of her neck with not a single strand out of place.

### Expression & Demeanor
- **Expression**: Coolly professional with thin lips that rarely smile
- **Eyes**: Sharp gray eyes that miss nothing
- **Aura**: Formidable intelligence and carefully controlled emotion
- **Beauty**: Severe and intimidating rather than warm or approachable

## Attire

She wears an expensive ensemble that speaks to both century-old elegance and modern wealth:

- **Blouse**: High-necked in deep burgundy silk with delicate lace at the collar and cuffs
- **Skirt**: Long black skirt that falls to mid-calf in Victorian style
- **Jacket**: Tailored black jacket with subtle brocade detailing

## Posture & Bearing

Her posture is **rigidly perfect**:
- Spine absolutely straight
- Shoulders back
- Chin level
- Hands clasped formally at her waist
- Every movement suggests precise control and aristocratic bearing from 1880s high society frozen in time

## Office Setting

### Desk Area
Behind her desk sits an ornate Victorian writing desk in dark mahogany with brass fittings, featuring:
- Stacks of meticulously organized papers and ledgers documenting boons and social obligations
- An antique telephone alongside a modern one (suggesting her bridge between eras)
- Crystal paperweight
- Fountain pen set
- Leather-bound ledger open to pages filled with precise handwriting tracking the complex web of Kindred social obligations

### Office Decor
The office walls feature:
- Dark wood paneling
- Framed photographs from late 1800s railroad construction and Flagstaff society balls
- Large painting of the Southern Pacific Railroad
- Elegant gas-lamp-style wall sconces providing warm ambient lighting

### Window View
A tall window behind her desk shows the Phoenix nighttime skyline, with curtains in heavy burgundy velvet partially drawn, moonlight streaming in to create dramatic shadows across the Victorian furnishings.

## Atmosphere & Character

The overall atmosphere suggests:
- **Wealth** accumulated over a century
- **Rigid Victorian propriety** that never adapted to modern eras
- **Formidable social power** wielded through information and reputation control
- A woman who is both elegant and deeply lonely - trapped in amber from 1890, slowly suffocating under the weight of duty and propriety while maintaining absolute control over Phoenix's Kindred social structure
