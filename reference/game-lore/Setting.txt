Phoenix by Night – RPG Chronicle Framework (Summary)

Setting

City: Phoenix, Arizona

Year: 1994

Tone: Recognizable Phoenix but not tied strictly to real-world accuracy.


Core Premise

The chronicle begins at a Camarilla gathering in Phoenix.

On the very night your character is formally introduced into Kindred society, the Prince is mysteriously killed.

This plunges the Camarilla into chaos, with every faction scrambling for power.

The player, as a neonate, must quickly navigate politics, alliances, and survival.


Key Locations & Power Centers

Guadalupe, AZ: Rumored home of a Sabbat pack.

24th Street near Arizona State Hospital: Controlled by the Anarchs, but the hospital grounds are under the control of a powerful Malkavian elder.

Scottsdale (Camelback Mountain area): Giovanni family stronghold with several family members and ghouls.

Mesa skyscraper: Controlled by human mages, becomes important late in the chronicle.

Desert around Phoenix: Controlled by Garou, not immediately relevant.


Faction Dynamics

Camarilla: Leaderless after the Prince’s death; clans and elders scramble for dominance.

Anarchs: Hold territory near 24th Street, but steer clear of the hospital grounds.

Malkavian Elder: Enigmatic, with firm control of the Arizona State Hospital.

Giovanni: Presence in Scottsdale.

Sabbat: Rumored nearby in Guadalupe, heightening paranoia.

Hunters/Mortals: Always a background threat if the Masquerade slips.


Starting Hook

The player is thrust into Kindred politics on their first night of recognition.

The Prince’s murder acts as both mystery and catalyst.

Gameplay begins with feeding safely, proving worth, and choosing early alliances, all while the Camarilla descends into chaos.
