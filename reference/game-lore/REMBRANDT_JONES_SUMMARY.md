# Rembrandt Jones - Character Import Summary

## Character Overview
**Name:** Rembrandt Jones  
**ID:** 29 (expected)  
**Clan:** Toreador  
**Generation:** 12th  
**Concept:** Roadside Americana Artist - Comic Relief Living Masterpiece

## The Tragedy
Rembrandt is a **living art piece** who doesn't realize he's the art. He's technically brilliant but aesthetically questionable, trying desperately to impress mainstream Toreador society while accidentally thriving in the Roadside Americana subculture.

## Key Stats
- **Auspex 3** (Heightened Senses, Aura Perception, Spirit's Touch)
- **Presence 1** (Awe)
- **Security 4** - Could be a master art thief
- **Subterfuge 4** - Can sell anything
- **Crafts 4** - LED sculptures (technically perfect, aesthetically questionable)
- **Resources 4** - Wealthy from terrible art sales
- **Contacts 4** - Deep in Roadside Americana community
- **Herd 2** - People who KNOW they're being fed on (find him endearing)

## The Joke
- Technically skilled enough to be a master art thief (Security 4, Stealth 3, Auspex 3)
- Uses these skills to protect and acquire **terrible art**
- Has **Clumsy x2** but also **Luck 3 Merit** (the universe keeps him alive because he's art)
- Gets entranced by: fluorescent light buzz, gas station hot dog rollers, inflatable tube men, bad taxidermy
- Photography is technically brilliant but focuses on drainage grates, rust patterns, parking lot geometry

## Relationship with Sire
- Las Vegas Toreador who created gaudy casino strip art
- Saw potential in Rembrandt's obsessive dedication to beauty
- Embraced him during Rat Pack era (late 50s/early 60s)
- Got more than expected and subtly encouraged him to move to Phoenix
- Sends short poems about art every few months trying to guide him
- Rembrandt **completely misinterprets** them and uses as inspiration for his next terrible piece

## Plot Hooks
1. Pretentious elder wants to 'acquire' him as living installation
2. Malkavian tells him the truth (he doesn't believe it)
3. Someone tries to 'fix' him (would destroy the art)
4. PCs have to babysit him at important event
5. He witnesses something important while distracted
6. Accidentally becomes famous in human art world
7. His collection is stolen (worthless to others but he's devastated)
8. Needs to impress Primogen at gallery opening (hilarious disaster)
9. Recruited for art heist - shockingly competent until Clumsy/Entranced kicks in

## The Core
**High Courage (4)** is his defining virtue - he keeps trying despite constant rejection. His earnest obliviousness is what makes him a masterpiece. **If he becomes self-aware, does the art die?**

## Notes
Rembrandt is **comic relief** but also has surprising depth. He's a commentary on what makes art "good" and the tragedy of seeking approval from those who can't see your value. The Roadside Americana community actually appreciates him, but he's blind to it because he's chasing mainstream Toreador validation.

Perfect NPC for:
- Comic relief in serious scenes
- Unexpected competence when plot needs it (Security 4, Stealth 3, Auspex 3)
- Philosophical questions about art and self-awareness
- Social dynamics within Toreador clan
