Chapter Eight:
A Harpy
’
s Primer
An Introduction to Playing a Harpy
In the Modern Nights, anyone can be a Harpy. Some of the people who play Harpies
have done it before; others are new to the experience. This primer is meant for both
groups. No one should assume that just because they played a Harpy in the past that
there isn’t new or relevant information available in this document. The first topic of
this primer certainly applies to all Harpy players, regardless of experience.
The Greatest Misconception
It is assumed by many that Harpies must be elected by the Primogen. This is false.
There is no requirement that Harpies be selected by the Primogen, that they serve the
Primogen, or that a domain even needs a Primogen Council to have a Harpy. None of
the written material on Harpies suggests that the Primogen Council selects the Harpy,
or that the Council can vote to remove a Harpy.
Some players point out that Primogen gives the Harpy Status Traits to show their
support and use that as cause to believe that Harpies are elected by the Primogen Council, or that only the Council can select a Harpy. However, the Status rules don’t say that.
The Status rules say that each Primogen automatically gives the Harpy a loaned
Status Trait to show their support for the Harpies. The loan is automatic; it is not by
choice—which contradicts the idea that the Primogen have a choice of whom serves as
Harpy. The rules also say that the loan is to show support for the Harpies. It’s plural:
The Primogen are showing support for the position, not the individual in that position.
This is the reason the loan of Status is automatic.
85
This doesn’t mean a Primogen couldn’t remove support by withdrawing the Status
Trait. Indeed, this sends a clear message that a Primogen believes the current Harpy’s
actions are blemishing the position as a whole. This type of action should not be taken
lightly. A Primogen who removes support for the Harpies simply because the local
Harpy caught him in a scandal is telling the sect that he doesn’t believe in the responsibilities or authority of the position. The circumstances when a Primogen removes support should only come when the position of Harpy itself is being diminished by the acts
of the office holder. Usually, this would only happen if a Harpy was found in a scandal
or wasn’t doing his job at all.
The method by which a Harpy comes to power is different for each domain. In
some, the Kindred may be happy allowing the Primogen to select a Harpy. In others,
the Prince may do it—as is allowed by the Second Tradition. In still others, a Harpy may
rise from among the ranks of her peers and be recognized by default as the most insightful among them.
For more information on the Harpy and how they come to power, one should read
the Laws of the Night: Camarilla Guide and Vampire the Masquerade: Guide to the Camarilla.
Both give insight into the position with a depth that the Laws of the Night: Revised cannot
match.
What Every Harpy Needs To Know
Every Tradition
Memorize both the title and content. There is no point in knowing that the Fifth
Tradition is Hospitality, but not knowing precisely what that means.
Every Status Rule
You need to know every nuance of the Status rules. You should know exactly when
anyone could do anything with Status. That means knowing every rule in the Laws of
the Night: Revised and Vampire the Masquerade: Camarilla Guide as well as those that appear elsewhere in this book.
Not all the Status rules are under the Status section of Laws of the Night: Revised.
There are rules hidden in other sections of the Systems chapter and even at the end of
the book in the entry for Anarchy. In a perfect world, every player should know these
rules, but more often than not, they will simply expect you to know them.
A Private Scandal Isn’t a Scandal
Your job is to gossip and spread information. That means sharing information with
other Harpies and the rest of the Camarilla. Send reports. Keep lines of communication open.
You Have a Duty
You have job to do, and nobody is above you when it comes to this job. There is
a reason a Harpy can remove Status during a scandal for free. A Prince can’t do that.
An archon can only do it to those who interfere with their official work. You have
the power to judge any scandal; even those committed by Primogen and Princes. You
have that power because the sect recognizes the power of reputation and the need for
86
OKC by Night
scandals to be caught and judged. Not everything is a killing offense, but many things
will murder a reputation.
Anyone who tries to stop you from doing your job—without evidence to remove the
scandal—is as guilty as the Kindred you are targeting. Even Princes are subject to your
gossip and scorn. Of course, a Prince may not look kindly on the Harpy condemning
someone that he wishes to remain untainted, which is why a smart Harpy may confer
privately with the Prince before publicizing a scandal.
The Duties of a Harpy
The two main duties of a Harpy are to track reputation and boons. The first requires making public every scandal and success and seeing that all involved are properly
recognized for their behavior—for good or for ill. The second requires keeping meticulous records. Both require sharing the information with—at the least—other Harpies.
Reputation
One of the most important tasks of a Harpy is to ensure that everyone acts in manner befitting their station. To do so requires knowing the standing of every Kindred in
the city, and many of the important Kindred who live in other cities. A Harpy doesn’t
need to worry about those who know their place and act in an appropriate manner.
But, they do need to act against those who fall out of line.
Harpies are rarely patient with fools. Those who act in a shameful manner need to
be dealt with at once, or they set a bad example for others. A Harpy who doesn’t act
swiftly is providing an invitation for others to misbehave. This doesn’t mean a Harpy
shouldn’t be sure they know all the facts before acting; it’s equally shameful for a Harpy
to scold someone who is working with the permission of those of high standing.
Harpies are not in the business of praising anyone. That would seem like bias, and
it would tarnish the reputation of both the individual Harpy and the position itself.
Harpies only report the praise given by others. They only report the good deeds and appropriate behavior that is noted by others—usually with Status Traits attached. A Harpy
should never look like she is showing favoritism or being swayed by another. A Harpy
needs to look pristine, even if they are not.
The Nature of Status
Status is a difficult Trait to manage in the chronicle. It is the Trait that most affects
in character social interaction among Camarilla Kindred. The effect of other Traits are
felt in game, such as the effect of Physical Traits in combat, or Social Traits in Discipline
use, but Status Traits have a direct impact on how characters perceive others in the society. This fact often makes players want to treat Status Traits as in character Traits. That
is, having their characters refer to numbers of Traits or make statements such as “Bob
lost half his Status.” This is incorrect. Status—as a Trait—is something that exists only
out of character. It is just like a Brawny Trait or a Gorgeous Trait. All it does is tell us, as
players, something we need to know about a character. We interpret that information
and apply it to what our characters know. Our characters know that someone is brawny
or gorgeous because they have experienced it, not because they know that character has
the Brawny Trait. Characters also know that a Kindred is more respected than his peers
87
because they have experience with that character, not because there are seven Status
Traits on his character sheet. High School social dynamics are similar. The popular
kids haven’t been given Status Traits by their peers or society, but they would have them
if we created character sheets for them.
Status is not something that Camarilla Kindred question. They just know who is
more important. There is no question of why; there is no demand for proof. Just like in
real life, we don’t expect to see proof of status in a social group. It’s obvious. Characters may resent it, or not want to recognize it, but that doesn’t change the reputation of
Kindred. However, if a Kindred doesn’t deserve their reputation, it is up to the court
officers—especially the Harpy—to let the world know. This includes the out of character
act of removing Status from a character, and the in character act of making that Kindred’s shortcomings a matter of public record.
The Harpy Report
For the Harpy’s gossip to be effective, others have to hear it. To this end, Harpies are
encouraged and expected to report the goings-on in their city to other Kindred. In our
chronicle—where players and characters normally only interact with others in their own
city—this usually is done in Elysium and over the in character communication network.
To reflect the rest of the Camarilla, however, the Harpy will usually also submit
a Harpy Report. These reports can be made any time, although the most common
time is shortly after a court gathering. The report usually consists of an in character
section that details the important events of the evening, and any boons that are owed
by Kindred. There is also an out of character section that covers any changes in Status
and the exact size of any boons that were owed. This report is normally posted to the in
character forums.
Reporting Boons
Most Harpies report boons to the peers and the rest of the world. The format is
simple: all the Harpy need do is note who is in debt and who is now owed. The reason
for the debt is usually kept between the parties involved, but may be made public in
cases where the debt is the result of a scandal.
Types of Harpy
Court Harpy
The Court Harpy is what most people mean when they discuss Harpies. They are
the Chief Harpy of any domain and oversee the selection of lesser Harpies, should such
be desired.
Lesser Harpy
The lesser Harpies serve the Court Harpy and share in some of the power of that
position. In most situations, the lesser Harpies act as coterie, unless the Court Harpy
has intentionally appointed Kindred who hate each other.
Lesser Harpies become most fearsome when the court Harpy falls from grace. In
such situations, the lesser Harpies rapidly destroy the remaining reputation of their
former mistress and then fight to take her place.
88
OKC by Night
Nights in Court
Harpies are most at home in the Court and at Elysium—which may or may not be the
same thing. It is important as the player of a Harpy to understand how to interact in
those environments, and what features of these events are of interest to her.
Attention
Harpies have to be attentive to the goings-on in the court. They have to be aware of
who owes whom, who is likely to cause trouble and who is above reproach. Harpies are
always looking for the next scandal, and playing a Harpy means being attentive to what
happens in the court.
Courtesy
Kindred are predators and monsters, with the Beast always pushing to get out. The
Camarilla doesn’t like to dwell on that. In fact, the sect is devoted to the idea that structure and civility are the controls that keep Kindred from becoming monsters. Camarilla gatherings are meant to reflect that. Kindred are expected to be polite, orderly and
well mannered. They don’t speak out of turn, they respect those above them and they
are attentive to the needs of the court. When the expectation of courtesy is not met,
the Harpy must act.
Conflict
Conflict is more than violence or arguments. Conflict is Camarilla society is meant
to be subtle: it is snubs, wit and carefully worded observations. It is also disagreements
and accusations that arise when Kindred struggle over resources and respect. The
Harpy and the Prince are the arbiters of such disagreements. The Prince makes the
decisions and the Harpy makes sure the appropriate protocols are followed.
Accusations and Guilt
When two or more Kindred descend to blame and finger pointing, the issue is
usually brought before the Prince—or the Kindred acting in his place. The Prince will
likely hear the arguments made by each party and decide who is right. In cases where
no evidence is available, the Prince is expected to side with the Kindred who is most
respected in the sect. If he doesn’t, he has committed a scandal in the eyes of the sect.
That is when the Harpy acts. Similarly, if the Kindred who loses the argument continues to push the issue, he is not only violating the expectations of the sect, but he is also
questioning the ruling of the Prince. That’s a double scandal.
It needs to be noted that accusations and disagreements are not the same thing. No
Kindred in a friendly discussion of the application of Kindred law—for example—should
be expected to agree automatically with those of higher station. Discussions are just
that—talk. Deferring to the word of those of higher standing should be reserved for
when there are actual stakes riding on the outcome. These may include reputation, sect
stability or a defense against the Sabbat.
Example: If a criminal—Jack—somehow manages to gain the support of the Prince and then
makes that support public, then Jack is innocent—regardless of the truth, and even if the whole of
the Primogen Council believes that the criminal is just that. The Prince may not want to support
him in the face of a united Council, since if she pisses the Primogen off enough, they may try to
89
force her from office. Now, say one elder—Alex—supports the neonate Jack, and two elders with
equal weight to Alex oppose Jack. The sum of each side’s Status Traits is not compared. Rather,
it is the fact that there are two men of the same standing as one that makes the elders right. If
the voices of either Alex or Jack held less weight than a single elder, but their voices combined held
more, they would still have lost. The Camarilla doesn’t bow to the will of the mob.
On a final note, Alex should probably go down with Jack. After all, Alex was supporting a
criminal, and that is scandalous behavior, but not everything is quite as cut and dry.
Chaos
Every court has its bad nights. These are the nights when Ancillae raise their voices,
weak-willed Brujah frenzy and two neonates try to kill each other on Elysium. No one
wants these nights, not even the Harpy—whose job would be all too dull without them.
Kindred who become violent are the worst of the scandalous Kindred, because they
have completely rejected the civility and society offered by the Camarilla. A Kindred
who speaks disrespectfully deserves to be shamed, a Kindred who has tossed aside all
social order must be driven to the ground. Violence—especially in court—is inexcusable,
because it is the tool of the Beast.
The Guide to Scandal
What follows is a list of obvious, and not so obvious, behaviors that a Harpy—or
other Kindred—may find to be scandalous. Most of these are likely to been seen as
scandalous in all but the most liberal of domains.
Scandals of Behavior
Airing Dirty Laundry
Only a Kindred who is in a position to be judging others for scandalous behavior
should be airing their domain’s problems and scandals. This usually means the Harpy
or Prince. Announcing to the world that a local elder frenzied—when it isn’t one’s
place—is itself scandalous.
Behavior Not Befitting One’s Station
This includes elders or Princes throwing tantrums, Kindred of high standing making
off-color jokes in public, or any behavior that is infantile or in poor taste. The greater
one’s standing, the more civil and thoughtful one is expected to behave. When such
Kindred act in such a fashion in public, the Harpy is expected to censure them.
Disrespecting the Standing of Other Camarilla Kindred
There is nothing shameful about disagreeing with anyone, so long as it is done in a
polite and deferential manner. Telling an archon that he is an idiot is disrespectful—although those with more Status than the archon can get away with it. Politely disagreeing with his interpretation of a Tradition is not disrespectful.
However, if a Kindred of high standing firmly refutes the opposing view again, in a
manner suggesting no discussion is desired, the lower status Kindred is expected to let
the matter drop.
90
OKC by Night
Faking One’s Reputation
Claiming to have the support or respect of Kindred who have not given it is a
scandal. This one isn’t too hard to catch since Harpies have a good memory for who
supports whom.
Falsely Claiming a Boon
Those who falsely claim to be owed boons are as low as those who renege on their
debts.
Frenzying
The Camarilla presents the facade of an ordered and civil society. Frenzying in the
presence of other Kindred is therefore considered a shameful act.
Infiltrating another Clan
The sect really doesn’t care that much about clan matters, but it has little tolerance
for those who have infiltrated other clans. This act is scandalous not only because some
clans are better regarded than others, but also because a Kindred willing to lie about his
clan may be lying about his sect loyalties as well. Kindred who choose to lie to the sect
had best be sure they are never caught in their deception.
Minor Violations of the Traditions
These are small violations, such as easily concealed Masquerade violations, attempting to breach the right of destruction or violating the domain or haven of another
Camarilla Kindred.
Questioning the Sect
This is usually only a scandal in more conservative domains. In such places, publicly
debating the validity of the sect’s ideology, or the right of the sect to rule all Kindred, is
scandalous.
Debating such things suggests that there is some question as to the validity of the
sect’s position. That sort of thinking is left for the Anarchs; to loyal Camarilla Kindred,
the truth is obvious. This does not proscribe discussion of how policy is enforced, or
how ideology manifests, but there should never be any question as to whether the Camarilla has a right to power. At least, those questions aren’t raised in public.
Reneging On a Boon
This is a scandal so noteworthy that it is described specifically among the Harpy’s
Status powers. No Kindred should reject a boon they owe without punishment.
Spreading Heresy
The Camarilla party line is clear on certain facts. Caine, the Antediluvians and
all legends surrounding them are myths. They are convenient marker points to define
one’s place with regard to age and standing in one’s clan. They are not going to rise
up and eat their young. They are not going to judge those found wanting. They will
not be around when Gehenna comes, because there is no Gehenna. There is also no
Golconda, no Lilith, and we are not in the Time of Thin Blood—which is just another
myth. Quoting the Book of Nod is scandalous—and those knowledgeable of the Sabbat
may even suspect you of being a sympathizer. In summary, suggesting publicly that any
part of the party line is false is scandalous and should attract the Harpy. It may also be
seen as treason.
91
Supporting Scandalous Kindred
Kindred have to be careful whom they support. If a Kindred does something
scandalous, all who supported them—whether by word or deed—are seen as guilty by
association. Once a scandal is revealed, it is too late to remove support, so it is in the
best interest to be the one to discover the scandal and either hide it or withdraw support
before the scandal is discovered. A smart Harpy or Prince will target anyone who publicly supported a scandalous Kindred. Those who showed private support may be able
to keep their names out of the mess if they are willing to pay the price of silence.
Violence
Just like frenzy, violence is a feature of the Beast, and is frowned upon in Camarilla
society. Like all societies, violence is more acceptable in times of war and is generally accepted when committed in self-defense. Good Harpies consider these situational factors
and may strike hard against those who incite other Kindred to violence.
Scandals of Court
Disrespecting Elysium
Violence on Elysium, destruction of property and the violation of domain-specific
rules of Elysium are all scandalous.
Interfering With the Duties of a Court Officer
Trying to stop a Sheriff from detaining a Kindred for questioning, publicly questioning the decision of a Prince, unless the decision is also scandalous, is a scandal.
Contradicting a Harpy’s analysis of a scandal without proof that the scandal is false is
also scandalous.
Violation of Domain Protocols
Ignorance of domain-specific laws is no protection from punishment. A Kindred
who doesn’t learn local customs and laws is showing disrespect to the local Kindred—especially the Prince—and disrespect to the institutions of the sect itself.
Scandals of Praxis
An Elected Prince
This is a scandal on great proportion. It can affect a Prince and the whole Primogen
Council. There are domains where a Prince is selected by vote of the Primogen, but it is
best that such things stay quiet. Declaring publicly that a Prince was elected is admitting that a Prince is a puppet of the Primogen or the masses, and thus unworthy of his
own power—and incapable of possessing power. That is bad for a domain and bad for a
Prince.
Announcing an Attempted Praxis Seizure
It doesn’t matter who makes the announcement. Any announcement of an effort
to overthrow the Prince before the attempt is successful—or ended—can be scandalous.
After all, one is declaring that the Prince cannot control her domain. If the Kindred
making the announcement is also the one attempting to overthrow the Prince, that is
also scandalous, as they are showing they have no claim other than hubris. Anything
less than a complete success or a complete failure is nobody’s business but those directly
involved.
92
OKC by Night
Bloodhunting during a Praxis Seizure
Bloodhunts during a Praxis seizure are possible, but they are also bad form. If the
Prince in power does it, he is telling the world that his only weapon for maintaining
power is telling everyone else to kill his enemies. If the one trying to seize Praxis calls
for a Bloodhunt, it is even more shameful, as they haven’t even secured their rule before
trying to act as a Prince.
Publicly Challenging a Praxis
Until a Kindred has replaced the sitting Prince—by death, abdication or similar
means—said Kindred is not a Prince. Publicly declaring otherwise is scandalous. Until
he is a Prince, there is nothing to declare.
Harpies and Boons
Harpies are often trusted to track and report boons. No Kindred is required to
inform the Harpies of a boon for the debt to be owed; however, it is usually in the best
interest of all the parties involved to make their boons well known. It gives the creditor
some security, as well as a public presentation of their power over another. It also lets
other Kindred know who may be angered should the debtor meet an untimely end—thus
offering a measure of protection to those who owe debts.
What is a Boon?
Boons are an agreement between two Kindred to the exchange of services at a later
date. Typically, one owes a boon in response to a favor or service performed by another.
Holding others in debt is the trait of a strong player in the Jyhad, while owing boons is
sometimes seen as a weakness. Despite this, some younger Kindred treat owing a debt
as a safety net, as the creditor will often work to protect what they see as an investment.
Boons cannot be exchanged in the same manner as one might give another a dollar
bill, nor can they be willed to others. As they are an agreement between two Kindred,
they are not transferable, as the debtor has an agreement with his creditor, not another
Kindred. This does not mean elders haven’t found ways to create the same effect as an
exchange—by calling in debts to aid another Kindred, in exchange for a boon or the calling in of a boon. While the effect may be the same as a simple transfer, this roundabout
method preserves the idea of a boon as an agreement between two specific Kindred, and
reminds all involved that these are social—not economic—contracts.
As boons are an agreement between two Kindred, those Kindred can—if they so
wish—allow for further boons between the two of them to combine into a larger single
boon.
Reneging on a boon is a scandalous action that attracts the ire of the sect as a whole
and is guaranteed to invoke the wrath of the Harpies. Killing one’s creditor is a far
worse crime, for which the penalty is usually a Bloodhunt or death.
Most Camarilla Kindred register their boons with one or more Harpies. While this
isn’t required—as Kindred are assumed to respect the system of favors and debt—it is rare
to find a Kindred who doesn’t register their boons for the sake of security and record
keeping.
93
Boon Compensation
When a Kindred dies, boons owed by them are lost. As such, it is in the best interests of creditors to protect those who owe them. However, destroying one who owed
boons to powerful or influential people is often dangerous, and new boons or other
compensation may be required to assuage the anger of the affected creditors. It has become the practice of some domains to require such compensation by those responsible
for killing other Kindred.
Advanced Concerns
Working with Others
Being a Harpy means working in concert with the rest of the court officers. The
Harpy must understand the role that each officer plays and how the offices can work
together to maintain a strong sect.
Sometimes, it isn’t enough for a Harpy to scorn those who have done wrong. Sometimes, the entire court has to move against those who have acted shamefully. Normally,
a Kindred has their Status stripped by the Harpy and is properly censured. However,
some Kindred commit acts so shameful that the Harpy’s judgment isn’t enough. In
those situations, the Harpy’s announcement of scandal may be swiftly followed by the
Prince or the offender’s Primogen also removing Status.
Such Kindred have fallen a long way. Even then, they may still have to attend to the
Sheriff, who may take advantage of his target’s shame to ask some hard questions. Some
Kindred bounce back quickly from such scandals—especially elders or court officers,
whose age or station requires respect. Others are not so lucky and can look forward to
slowly dragging themselves from the gutter.
When the Harpy is the Scandal
Harpies have enemies. Lesser Harpies want to be them, and Kindred who have been
the target of their gossip have cause to hate them. When a Harpy stumbles—when she
finds herself wrapped in a scandal—her enemies become hyenas, and they find every
possible way to tear her apart. In cases where a scandalous Kindred might have walked
away with her reputation bruised, a Harpy will be torn apart. Her peers will likely be
the first to strike, as it only takes the smell of a scandal for the lesser Harpies to have an
excuse to act. Once they make the scandal public, others will follow suit. In the end,
she will likely be a Harpy no longer, as the court has no tolerance for a gossip that is
caught in the hands of hypocrisy.
More Things a Harpy Should Know
You’re a Harpy now. They all belong to you. Seems a bit contradictory, doesn’t it? The fact is a Harpy within their home city can
be one of the most powerful players in the game. Once a Harpy has backing—especially
the backing of most of the Primogen—the Harpy can come down on anyone whether
they are Elder, Ancilla, Prince or colleague. Create a good working relationship with
94
OKC by Night
your Prince; you’ll be doing most of your grandstanding during her courts. Learn what
the Prince wishes from her Harpy. It’s always nice when Prince and Harpy work together—it gives you more power to say what you want, and sometimes even leave to make
an example of the Prince.
Love your Primogen Council. That’s right. The Primogen Council supports the Harpies, and it’s a good idea to
keep them happy until you have the public backing to make them look dumb when they
deserve it—or when someone pays you to. However, never make them look dumb for
supporting the Harpies. Always watch it with your Primogen. Moreover, always know
which Primogen you can keep in your pocket. If you want to keep your position, have at
least one. It’s difficult to oust a Harpy when you have at least one stalwart supporter.
You’ve got status. Use it. Playing a Harpy means that you are a social conscience of sorts. It is your job to
watch your Prince’s court with a social eye. It is your job to ensure that the Prince’s
social will be done. If you have one of those stuffy elder Princes who likes total silence
during court, it is your job to watch that there is no one talking; if there is, it’s your job
to make an example out of them. Negative Status exists so that you can assign colorful
names to social perpetrators. Never be afraid of throwing your weight around.
Use your authority publicly to denounce the mouthy Brujah. In character, Mr. Loud
Mouth gets dressed down. Out of character, assign something like Lemming, since he
seems to be bent on continuing the Brujah stereotype of being loud-mouthed idiots.
Brujah hate being thought of as lemmings.
Find the loopholes before they do. This means two things. One, you need to know the rules of the Status game backwards and forwards—and your Traditions. Two, when you make a public argument, try
your best to know every single angle of opposition someone might take, and prepare
a counter for it. Even better, don’t allow the opposition. The tighter your arguments
are, the more respect you’ll garner. The first and simplest way to block the arguments
against you is to remove room for them.
Variety is the spice of life. Have fun. Playing a Harpy can truly make you one of the most influential players
in the game, so enjoy it. Revel in the fact that you are now a target—the most obvious
target of the court, sometimes. You’re the mouthpiece, you’re the bearer of bad news.
You sentence the socially condemned.
Little black books aren’t just for “playas.”
Keep records. If your character has Eidetic Memory, then they don’t have to be in
character, but keep them all the same. It’s important to log boons and to keep a current
list of Status—especially for the denizens of your city, if not every single person you ever
come across. Always try to get the records from former Harpies.
Why all this? First, breaking a boon is a terrible thing. Proof that the boon exists
lies in your hands. Second, with the many ways Status can be used, having a current tab
95
is extremely useful for a Harpy, especially in deciding “truth.” It’s also useful for ferreting out Kindred who are claiming to possess little more weight than they deserve.
Tact. Get some. Keep it. Now that you know your character has the potential for quite a bit of power at her
fingertips, it’s time to learn when and how to do your Harping. If the Prince comes to
you and says, “I want ___,” then it’s time to make sure that “blank” is included in your
report. If an elder Toreador Primogen comes to you and says, “I want ___,” consider
what’s in it for you. If said elder can kick your ass either physically or socially, don’t ask
questions. If he is a wimp, see what you can get out of it. If the Prince herself commits
a faux pas, consider whether it’s in your interests to make such a revelation known to
the entire court. If it isn’t, get a boon for keeping your mouth shut. Words are a powerful weapon. Learn when to fight your battles—and learn when to get someone to fight
them for you.
A Sample Harpy Report
To My Influential Cousins,
Tonight has seen the tragic fall of an elder. He was not cut down by a sword, but by his own
failures. On this night, Lucius of the Brujah showed his true colors, and the limits of his will.
The night started with Lucius introducing the court to a new occupant of our city: Kyle. This
neonate was charming, but not yet ripe. Despite this, he would soon seem to be the downfall
of an elder.
Less than an hour into the night, Kyle presented himself as a shield between our Exalted
Prince and two warring Ancilla. Kyle suffered minor injuries, and the two offenders—who
had foolishly turned on the Prince—were staked and dragged from the premises. The Prince
was quick to note Kyle’s resolve in this situation, as well as the speed with which the neonate
rushed to aid his Prince.
Lucius seized upon this success and attempted to use his clan’s moment of splendor to shine the
spotlight on another of his clan: Cassie. Cassie was wise to his efforts and humbly noted that
she was no more worthy than others in the domain.
From that moment, events turned against Lucius. Later in the evening, his fellow elder,
Jeremiah, suggested that Lucius had been responsible for the slaying of two college students,
whose bloodless bodies were found outside a drinking establishment. It was with great effort
that the incident was washed from the attention of the public. When Sheriff Cole asked Lucius to attend a questioning, Lucius was indignant. Cole was forced to publicly reprimanded
Lucius for his reluctance.
Lucius, of course, took this matter to the Prince. The Prince, in his wisdom, saw that Jeremiah’s concerns were valid, especially in light of the Brujah Primogen’s recent behavior. The
Prince was also quick to note that the influence of Lucius in the court was waning.
Lucius, in the unfortunate fashion of many of his clan, took to berating Kyle. Clearly, his own
failures made Kyle’s earlier success a bitter pill to take. Rhianna, of the Ventrue, was swift in
