In **Laws of the Night Revised (Mind’s Eye Theatre / LARP version)**, **Willpower** is a resource that represents a character’s mental resilience, self-control, and determination. It’s separate from physical health and acts as a key mechanic for resisting the Beast, controlling disciplines, or pushing through stressful situations.

Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

---

### **1. Willpower Points**

* Characters have a **Willpower pool**, typically measured in dots or points (often 5 to 10 for starting characters).
* **Maximum Willpower** can depend on a combination of **Resolve Attribute + Composure Attribute**, though LARP rules often standardize starting points.

---

### **2. Spending Willpower**

Willpower is spent to:

* Resist **mental or emotional stress**, such as frenzy, fear, or intimidation.
* **Activate special powers** or disciplines that require self-control.
* Overcome **challenging actions** where pure mental effort is required (like resisting supernatural influence or maintaining composure in social manipulation).

Mechanically, in LARP:

* The **Storyteller or Marshal** decides when Willpower rolls or points are required.
* Usually, spending **1 Willpower point** allows a character to reroll or automatically succeed at a mental/emotional challenge.

### **3. Regaining Willpower**

Willpower is replenished by:

* **Rest or meditation**, often during downtime or after a scene ends.
* **Roleplaying positive character development**: acting in line with convictions, morality, or personal touchstones can restore points.
* In some cases, feeding on **blood** or other supernatural actions can also restore Willpower.

### **4. Willpower vs. Humanity / Beast**

* Willpower is your *active self-control*, while **Humanity** tracks your long-term moral compass.
* Spending Willpower allows a character to resist the **Beast’s impulses**, whereas failing to manage it can lead to **frenzy**, lapses in discipline, or other narrative consequences.
