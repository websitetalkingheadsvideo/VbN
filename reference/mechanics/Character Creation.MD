### Summary of Character Creation Rules: *Laws of the Night* (Introductory Kit)

Character creation is designed to be quick and easy, defining the basic capabilities and supernatural gifts of a neonate vampire within the Camarilla sect.

#### Character Concept
Start with a general concept for your vampire, considering:
* **Mortal Life:** Who was your character before the Embrace? (e.g., a coroner, debutante, gang member, accountant).
* **Embrace Reason:** Why were they chosen for immortality?
* **Personality:** How does your character dress and act? Do they have ties to their mortal life?

#### The Character Creation Quick Chart

| Step | Rule |
| :--- | :--- |
| **1. Choose a Clan** | Write down the **Aptitude** (what the clan excels at), **Advantage** (a societal or supernatural benefit), and **Weakness** (the clan's curse) for one of the Camarilla clans (Brujah, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Toreador, Tremere, Ventrue, or Gangrel). |
| **2. Choose and Prioritize Traits** | Rank your three Trait Categories (**Physical, Social, Mental**) as **Primary (7 Traits)**, **Secondary (5 Traits)**, or **Tertiary (3 Traits)**. |
| **3. Choose Disciplines** | Every clan is predisposed to three Disciplines. Choose one of the following schemes: |
| | **A.** All three clan Disciplines, taking three Basic-level powers, one for each Discipline. |
| | **B.** Two clan Disciplines, taking one Basic-level power and one Intermediate-level power in each. |
| | **C.** Two clan Disciplines, taking two Basic-level powers, with two Traits left over to apply to your Trait categories. |
| **4. Choose Health Levels and Blood Traits** | Start with **5 Health Levels** and **10 Blood Traits**. |
| **5. Give Your Character a Name and Think About the Details** | Flesh out the character's backstory, personality, and portrayal. |

#### Key Rules and Terminology

* **Traits:** Measure a characterâ€™s raw potential in **Physical** (strength, dexterity), **Social** (charm, presence), and **Mental** (wits, cunning) ability. Traits can be spent for benefits but are only recovered at the start of the next game session.
* **Disciplines:** These are the gifts of the blood (supernatural powers). They come in two levels: **Basic** and **Intermediate**.
* **Blood Traits:** Start at 10. They are spent to power Disciplines, boost Physical Traits, and heal wounds. A vampire spends one Blood Trait each night upon awakening. Falling to zero Blood Traits results in **Torpor**.
* **Health Levels:** Start at 5: Healthy, Bruised, Wounded, Mauled, and Incapacitated.
* **Damage:** Wounds are either **Simple** (healed with one Blood Trait and one turn) or **Aggravated** (caused by fire/sunlight/supernatural claws; healed with three Blood Traits and one day's rest).
* **Status:** Beginning characters are typically assumed to be **Neonates**, the lowest rank in the Camarilla hierarchy.
