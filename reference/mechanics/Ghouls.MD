### Ghoul Rules Summary: Mind's Eye Theatre (*Liber des Goules* referencing *Laws of the Night*)

Ghouls are mortals who have ingested vampire vitae, incorporating the best and worst of both Kindred and kine worlds. They are essential to Kindred society as servants, bodyguards, and a link to the mortal world.

#### Character Creation
Ghoul creation assumes familiarity with *The Masquerade: Second Edition* or *Laws of the Night*.

1.  **Inspiration:** Choose a Regnant (vampire master), Nature (true self), and Demeanor (public mask).
2.  **Attributes:** Prioritize **Physical, Mental, and Social** Attributes as Primary (7 Traits), Secondary (5 Traits), and Tertiary (3 Traits).
3.  **Advantages:**
    * **Abilities:** Choose 5 Traits from the core list or ghoul-specific ones (see below).
    * **Discipline:** Choose one initial Discipline from **Celerity, Fortitude, or Potence**. Other Disciplines require the **Merit: Learn Other Disciplines**.
    * **Influences:** Choose 3 Traits.
    * **Humanity:** Choose 3 initial Humanity Traits (one is lost immediately upon ghouling).
4.  **Last Touches:**
    * **Blood Traits:** Start with 4 (3 human + 1 vampiric). Max is 6 (3 human + 3 vampiric).
    * **Willpower:** Start with 1 Trait.
    * **Status:** Start with **Recognized**.
    * **Negative Traits/Flaws/Merits:** Optional; up to 4 Negative Traits (1-for-1 trade for positives) and 5 Traits each of Merits/Flaws. **Revenants** must take one Derangement.

#### Ghoul-Specific Abilities

* **Animal Affinity:** Relates well to non-ghoul animals; inoffensive to them and grants some control (Mental Challenge to command).
* **Blood Lore:** Knowledge of the Blood Bond, its coerced nature, and ideas on how to break it.
* **Haven Scouting:** Capacity to find havens for one's Regnant or sniff out where a quarry is sleeping (Mental Challenges).
* **Hunter Lore:** Knowledge of Hunters (types, reputations, tactics).
* **Kindred Lore:** Familiarity with Regnant's lineage and Kindred mysteries; useful for blackmail or gaining favor.
* **Lupine Lore:** Knowledge of werewolves, their hatred of vampires, and possible locations (Social Challenge to gain info).
* **Masquerade:** Allows a ghoul to pass for a vampire; grants a single re-test on Aura Perceptions against the ghoul.
* **Medical Knowledge:** Knowledge of medical procedures; can stabilize an injured ghoul to halt bleeding/decline (Static Mental Challenge against 6 Traits).
* **Sniping:** Instinctive ability to spot a vampire in a crowd; grants a specific Aura Perception (Social Challenge; winner asks if the target is a vampire, who cannot lie).
* **Steward:** Deep grasp of Regnant's affairs and haven management; useful for defense or blackmail/defection.

#### Ghoul Physiology

* **Blood Use:** Ghouls can use blood to heal **non-aggravated** wounds. They do not need blood to exist unless they have exceeded their natural lifespan.
* **Health Levels:** Bruised, Wounded, Incapacitated, **Dying**. There is no Torpor; death occurs when the heart stops. An Incapacitated ghoul cannot participate in challenges.
* **Bleeding:** Ghouls bleed when wounded. A Wounded ghoul drops to Incapacitated after 10 minutes without medical attention and loses a Blood Trait. Incapacitated and Dying ghouls continue to lose a Blood Trait every 10 minutes until they die. Medical attention (Static Mental Challenge) is required to stop the bleeding.
* **Aging:** Ghouldom is not permanent. After **30 days** without vitae, a ghoul reverts to human status, losing Disciplines and ghouling-related Traits. Ghouls over 100 years old will begin to age at an accelerated rate (10x normal) if they stop receiving vitae, suffering permanent Trait loss.

#### The Blood Bond
* The Bond forms after **three ingestions** of a vampire's blood. It is the core of a ghoul's life, creating overwhelming emotional attachment.
* **Dominate:** A vampire need not make eye contact to Dominate a Bound ghoul. The Regnant wins all ties against their Thrall.
* **Breaking the Bond:** The Bond fades if the Regnant does not feed the ghoul at least once a year. A ghoul may also attempt to break the Bond through sheer willpower and roleplay, especially if severely mistreated.

#### Frenzy
* Ghouls can frenzy, typically when facing imminent destruction, under extreme stress, with triggered Derangements, or via the Animalism Discipline.
* **Mechanics:** Frenzy is a violent, blind attack; the ghoul may ignore damage penalties but cannot use blood to heal and is susceptible to blood loss.
* **Humanity Loss:** If a ghoul injures someone during a frenzy, they must pass a Static Social Challenge against four Traits to avoid a Derangement and temporary Humanity loss. Killing someone requires two Static Challenges with a Humanity Trait bid; loss/tie results in permanent Humanity loss and a Derangement.

#### Humanity
* **Starting:** Most Ghouls start with **3** Humanity Traits.
* **Revenants:** Start with **1** Humanity Trait and may never have more than 4. They can lose their last Humanity Trait.
* **Uses:**
    * **Relief from Derangements:** Spend one Humanity Trait (with roleplay) to relieve a fear-related Derangement for the session.
    * **Threats to Life and Limb:** Spend a Humanity Trait to add one to the Trait put to the test in a life-threatening situation.
    * **True Love:** Use a Humanity Trait as a bid in a challenge to protect a True Love, lost regardless of the outcome.
* **Regaining:** Temporarily lost Humanity Traits are regained by the next event. Humanity Traits can be bought back with experience points (if not permanently lost) or a Willpower Trait for urgent need.
