ü©∏ Backgrounds in Laws of the Night: Revised
üìò General Rules

Backgrounds represent the resources, connections, and influence your character has beyond their personal abilities.

You start with 5 Background points during character creation.

Each Background can be rated ‚Ä¢ to ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ (1‚Äì5 dots).

Backgrounds cannot usually be increased with XP without in-game justification ‚Äî you earn them through play.

Each dot represents roughly a significant step in scope or power.

üß© Standard Backgrounds
Background	Description	Examples / Benefits
Allies	Mortal friends who will help you out of loyalty or mutual interest.	Police officers, gang members, journalists who provide favors or assistance.
Contacts	Sources of information rather than aid. You know who to ask and how to get info fast.	Knowing someone in the press, law enforcement, or academic circles.
Fame	You‚Äôre well-known among mortals.	At 1 dot you‚Äôre a local face, at 5 dots a national celebrity. Affects influence and security.
Generation	Represents how close you are to Caine ‚Äî your blood‚Äôs power.	Lowers your blood pool cap and increases Discipline potential. (10th gen default ‚Üí 13 blood max; each dot lowers generation one step.)
Herd	Mortals who willingly or unknowingly provide you with blood.	1 dot = a few donors, 5 dots = a small cult or club of regulars. Provides feeding access and some safety.
Influence	Political, criminal, or social clout in mortal society.	Control over institutions like City Hall, police, business, or crime. Each dot increases reach.
Mentor	An elder, sire, or teacher who guides you.	May grant training, political support, or rare knowledge ‚Äî but expects loyalty.
Resources	Wealth and financial assets.	1 dot = modest living, 3 dots = affluent, 5 dots = wealthy enough to fund others.
Retainers	Loyal servants or ghouls who serve you.	1 dot = a single ghoul or mortal servant, 5 dots = a team or staff.
Status	Your standing within Kindred society.	Reflects respect and authority. Varies by sect: Camarilla, Sabbat, Anarchs.
üßõ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Special Backgrounds (Clan- or Sect-Specific)

Some Storytellers or supplements include extra backgrounds relevant to certain clans or sects:

Background	Available To	Description
Domain	Camarilla / Princes	Control over territory and feeding rights.
Pack	Sabbat	Represents your loyalty and the resources of your pack.
Rituals	Tremere, Assamite Sorcerers	Access to Thaumaturgical or Sorcerous rituals.
Fame (Underworld)	Nosferatu / Anarchs	Influence in criminal or underground networks.
Library / Lorehouse	Scholars / Tremere	Access to occult tomes and rare knowledge.
Haven	All	Safe, secure, or luxurious place of rest.
‚öñÔ∏è Background Guidelines

Maximums at Creation: You can‚Äôt take more than 3 dots in any single Background without Storyteller approval.
(Exception: Generation, which is capped at 5 dots.)

Storyteller Control: Backgrounds are subject to the ST‚Äôs setting. Influence in ‚ÄúPolice‚Äù doesn‚Äôt help if the city has no police presence in the game world.

Loss Through Play: Backgrounds can be lost ‚Äî e.g., Allies die, Resources are seized, Influence fades.

Tying Backgrounds to Story: The ST may ask you to describe how each Background fits into your concept (e.g., Who are your Allies? What kind of business gives you Resources?).

üí∞ XP Costs

While typically earned in play, Backgrounds can also be bought during or after creation for:

1 XP per dot (with Storyteller approval and justification).
