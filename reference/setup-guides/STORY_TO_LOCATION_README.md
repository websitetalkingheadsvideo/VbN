# ü™Ñ Story to Location - AI-Powered Location Creation

Transform narrative location descriptions into structured database entries with AI magic!

## üåü Overview

The **Story to Location** feature allows you to write or paste a narrative description of a location, and AI will automatically extract and structure all the data needed for your VbN location database. No more filling out 48+ form fields manually!

## üìÅ Files

- **`admin_create_location_story.php`** - Main admin interface
- **`api_parse_location_story.php`** - AI parsing API endpoint  
- **`js/location_story_parser.js`** - Frontend logic and data handling
- **`config.env`** - API key configuration (already exists in project)

## üöÄ Setup

### 1. Configure AI API Key

Add your API key to the existing `config.env` file in your project root:

```bash
# AI API Keys (for Story to Location feature)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-actual-key-here
```

**Get your API key:**
- Visit https://console.anthropic.com/
- Sign up and create an API key
- Add it to `config.env`

The system uses the AI provider configured in `.taskmaster/config.json` (currently **Claude Sonnet 3.7**).

### 2. Verify Configuration

Check that your `.taskmaster/config.json` has the correct AI model settings:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "main": {
      "provider": "anthropic",
      "modelId": "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219",
      "maxTokens": 120000,
      "temperature": 0.2
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Access the Feature

Navigate to: `admin_create_location_story.php`

Or add a link in your admin panel:
```html
<a href="admin_create_location_story.php">
    <i class="fas fa-magic"></i> Create from Story
</a>
```

## üí° How to Use

### Step 1: Write Your Narrative

Describe the location as if you're telling a story. Include:

- **Basic details**: Name, type, appearance
- **Location**: District, address (if known)
- **Ownership**: Who controls it, faction affiliation
- **Security**: Locks, guards, protection measures
- **Features**: Utilities, amenities, special characteristics
- **Supernatural elements**: Wards, nodes, rituals
- **Social aspects**: Capacity, prestige, purpose

**Example:**

```
The abandoned warehouse sits in the industrial district of South Phoenix, 
its windows long since boarded up against prying eyes. Once a legitimate 
shipping depot, it now serves as a haven for the Nosferatu clan, who have 
transformed its underground levels into a labyrinth of tunnels and chambers.

The main floor appears derelict, but hidden behind false walls are 
state-of-the-art computer systems and a small armory. A ward placed by 
the local Tremere prevents unwanted supernatural visitors from entering 
without invitation. The location can hold perhaps 20 individuals 
comfortably, though few beyond the clan ever receive invitations to enter...
```

### Step 2: Parse with AI

Click **"Parse Story with AI"** and wait 10-30 seconds while the AI:
- Analyzes your narrative
- Extracts structured data
- Maps to all 48+ database fields
- Assigns confidence scores

### Step 3: Review & Edit

The preview panel shows all extracted fields with:

- üü¢ **High Confidence (80-100%)** - Direct information from text
- üü° **Medium Confidence (50-80%)** - Strong implications
- üî¥ **Low Confidence (<50%)** - Educated guesses

**Edit any field** directly in the preview. All fields are editable!

### Step 4: Save to Database

Click **"Save Location to Database"** to create the location using the existing `api_create_location.php` endpoint.

## üéØ What AI Extracts

## üß† AI Intelligence

### Confidence Scoring

The AI provides confidence scores for every extracted field:

| Score | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **0.9-1.0** | Direct quote | "The Red Velvet Lounge sits in Downtown Phoenix" |
| **0.7-0.9** | Strong implication | "reinforced steel doors" ‚Üí security_reinforced = 1 |
| **0.4-0.7** | Reasonable inference | "haven for Nosferatu" ‚Üí owner_type = "Clan" |
| **0.1-0.4** | Educated guess | "warehouse" ‚Üí security_level = 2 |
| **0.0** | Not mentioned | Fields left empty/default |

### Smart Inference

The AI can:

- **Recognize location types** from context clues
- **Infer security levels** from descriptions
- **Detect supernatural elements** (wards, nodes, rituals)
- **Estimate capacity** based on size descriptions
- **Identify ownership** from narrative context
- **Map features to checkboxes** (if mentioned ‚Üí checked)
- **Preserve the original narrative** in the description field

### Validation

- Ensures dropdown values match database schema
- Converts boolean mentions to 1/0 for checkboxes
- Provides reasonable defaults for required fields
- Flags ambiguous information for manual review

- **Right**: Live preview with confidence indicators

### Color-Coded Confidence

## üé≠ Example Narratives

### Example 1: Elysium

```
The Red Velvet Lounge sits in the heart of Downtown Phoenix, a high-end 
nightclub that serves as neutral ground for the city's Kindred. By day, 
it operates as a legitimate business, but when the sun sets, it transforms 
into Elysium under the Prince's decree.

The main floor features a spacious dance area with capacity for 200 guests. 
The VIP section on the second floor is reserved for important vampires. 
Behind the bar, a hidden door leads to underground chambers protected by 
Tremere wards.

Security includes reinforced steel doors, state-of-the-art alarms, and 
several ghouls posing as guards. Marcus Devereaux, an influential Toreador, 
owns this prestigious gathering place which also houses computer systems 
for monitoring security.
```

**Extracted**: Name, Type (Elysium), District (Downtown Phoenix), Capacity (200), Security features (reinforced, alarms, guards), Utilities (computers), Supernatural (warding rituals), Owner info, Prestige level, etc.

### Example 2: Chantry

```
The Old Mission Church in Tempe appears abandoned to mortal eyes, but 
serves as the primary Chantry for Phoenix's Tremere. The building dates 
to 1890 and sits on a powerful ley line intersection, creating a natural 
node with approximately 7 points of mystical energy.

The basement levels contain extensive ritual chambers, a library of occult 
texts, and hidden caches of mystical reagents. The structure is heavily 
warded against intrusion, both physical and astral. Only Tremere and their 
approved guests may enter, protected by threshold magics.

Above ground, the chapel maintains basic utilities and a small workshop 
for creating talismans. The location can accommodate around 15 individuals 
for ritual work.
```

**Extracted**: Name, Type (Chantry), District (Tempe), Supernatural features (node_points=7, ritual_space, magical_protection), Security (warding_rituals), Utilities (library, workshop, hidden_caches), Clan ownership, Access control (Threshold), etc.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "AI API key not configured"
- Create `.env` file in project root
- Add your `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...`
- Restart your web server

### "AI parsing failed"
- Check API key is valid
- Verify internet connection
- Check `.taskmaster/config.json` has correct provider
- Try shorter narrative (under 2000 words)

### Low confidence scores
- Add more specific details to your narrative
- Use explicit terms (e.g., "security cameras" vs "watched")
- Mention numbers when possible (e.g., "capacity of 50")

### Wrong field values
- Review and edit in the preview panel
- All fields are editable before saving
- The AI learns from context - be descriptive!

## üé® Styling

Uses existing `css/admin_location.css` with additional inline styles for:
- Two-panel grid layout
- Confidence color coding
- Loading states
- Preview sections

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Support for batch location creation (multiple narratives)
- [ ] Export/import narrative templates
- [ ] Learning from user corrections
- [ ] Support for images in narrative (AI vision)
- [ ] Integration with map services for auto-geocoding
