Warner Jefferson - Three Mission Test Arc
Overview
The PC needs significant money and approaches Warner Jefferson (or is directed to him) as one of two potential sources. Warner doesn't give loans lightly - he needs to know the PC is reliable, competent, and worth the investment. He structures this as three escalating tests disguised as "opportunities for mutual benefit."

Warner's Perspective: "I don't make bad investments. These tasks will tell me if you're someone I can work with long-term, or just another desperate vampire who'll waste my resources."

Structure: Each mission tests different capabilities while providing Warner with actual value. Success builds reputation; failure closes the door.

Mission 1: "The Information Audit" (Competence Test)
Setup
Warner's Pitch: "I'm considering an investment in a commercial real estate portfolio. Before I commit capital, I need accurate information. The seller's documentation is... let's call it optimistic. I need someone to verify the actual condition and occupancy rates. Discreetly."

The Real Task
Warner wants the PC to:

Visit 3-5 commercial properties (office buildings, strip malls, etc.)
Document actual occupancy vs. claimed occupancy
Identify any structural issues, problem tenants, or hidden liabilities
Do this without alerting the current owner or their agents
Provide detailed, accurate report within one week
Why This Tests the PC
Competence: Can they gather accurate information?
Discretion: Can they operate without causing problems?
Honesty: Will they tell Warner what he needs to know, or what they think he wants to hear?
Attention to Detail: Does their report catch important details or just surface observations?
Complications (Choose 1-2)
Security: One property has enhanced security (guards, cameras). PC must navigate without detection.
Squatters: One "vacant" property is actually occupied by homeless mortals or anarchs using it as crash space. What does PC report?
Other Interested Party: Another Kindred (or their ghoul) is also investigating the properties. Competitor? Could expose PC's activities.
Time Pressure: Warner moves up the deadline unexpectedly. Can PC deliver quality under pressure?
Moral Complication: PC discovers the current owner is being set up to fail by their own business partner who's feeding info to Warner.
Success Criteria
Minimum: Accurate report on occupancy and major issues
Good: Above + catches hidden problems (liens, code violations, problem tenants)
Excellent: Above + identifies why the seller is desperate to unload (tax issues, debt, personal problems) giving Warner additional leverage
Warner's Response
Failure: "I appreciate the effort, but this isn't the quality of work I need. Perhaps you should try elsewhere for funding."
Minimum Success: "Adequate. The information is useful. I have other tasks if you're interested in continuing to prove yourself."
Good/Excellent: "Impressive work. You have an eye for detail. I may have additional opportunities for someone with your skills."
Actual Outcome
Warner uses the information to:

Negotiate better price on the portfolio (if buying)
Short the investment (if passing)
Leverage the data against other Kindred with stakes in the properties PC's work directly profits Warner significantly.
Mission 2: "The Diplomatic Retrieval" (Social/Problem-Solving Test)
Setup
Warner's Pitch: "I made a loan to a Toreador - secured by a piece of art. The payment is overdue, which means the collateral is now mine. However, the Toreador is... emotional about the piece. I need someone to retrieve it without creating an enemy. This requires finesse, not force."

The Real Task
Retrieve the art piece from the Toreador (painting, sculpture, or other valuable artwork)
Maintain civil relations - no Masquerade breaches, no physical violence, no burned bridges
Negotiate, persuade, or otherwise convince the Toreador to honor the contract
If impossible to retrieve without incident, report back with accurate assessment
The Toreador
Name: [TBD - or use existing Toreador NPC] Situation:

Genuinely overextended financially and can't pay
The art piece has deep personal meaning (subject is their mortal love, created by their sire, gift from dead friend, etc.)
Embarrassed about defaulting
Will be hostile if approached aggressively but might respond to empathy or creative solutions
Why This Tests the PC
Social Skills: Can they negotiate effectively?
Problem-Solving: Can they find creative solutions beyond "give me the art"?
Emotional Intelligence: Can they read the situation and adapt approach?
Risk Assessment: Do they know when to push and when to retreat?
Kindred Politics: Do they understand reputation and relationship management?
Possible Approaches
Straight Negotiation: Explain the contract, offer face-saving options (payment plan, substitute collateral)
Empathy Play: Understand why piece matters, find alternative that satisfies Warner while preserving Toreador's dignity
Creative Solution: Help Toreador find money elsewhere, broker deal where Warner gets different compensation
Information Leverage: Discover why Toreador is broke, use that knowledge constructively
Reputation Appeal: Frame return as honoring one's word (Toreador value reputation)
Complications (Choose 1-2)
Toreador Ally: The Toreador has a powerful friend who "advises" PC to walk away
The Art is Hidden: Toreador moved it to secure location, claiming it's "lost"
Counter-Offer: Toreador offers PC something valuable to "lose" the art or report it damaged
Public Venue: Toreador forces meeting at Elysium where scene could be embarrassing for all parties
Art is Cursed/Haunted: There's a supernatural reason the Toreador doesn't want to give it up
Rival Creditor: Someone else also has claim on Toreador's assets
Success Criteria
Minimum: Retrieve the art OR provide accurate assessment of why retrieval is currently impossible
Good: Retrieve art while maintaining civil relations (Toreador isn't happy but isn't enemy)
Excellent: Retrieve art AND find solution that somewhat satisfies Toreador (payment plan, favor owed, future opportunity)
Outstanding: Above + PC's handling improves Warner's reputation for "reasonable" business practices
Warner's Response
Failure/Violent Resolution: "You solved the immediate problem but created a larger one. This is not how I do business."
Minimum: "Thank you for the assessment. I'll handle it from here." (Warner writes off the debt, disappointed in PC)
Good: "Well done. You retrieved the asset without unnecessary drama. That's exactly what I needed."
Excellent: "I'm impressed. You found a solution that preserved relationships while protecting my interests. That's rare."
Actual Outcome
Warner gets his collateral OR valuable information about Toreador's situation
PC's handling affects Warner's view of their judgment and discretion
Toreador's response to PC creates future ally, neutral party, or enemy
Mission 3: "The Hostile Acquisition" (Loyalty/Judgment Test)
Setup
Warner's Pitch: "I'm acquiring a business. The owner doesn't want to sell. I need you to provide... motivation. There's a ghoul running a mid-size company for a Ventrue who's overextended. I want you to create circumstances that make selling attractive. Use your judgment, but understand: I need this acquisition, and I need it clean."

The Real Task
This is the loyalty and judgment test. Warner is deliberately vague about methods because he wants to see:

What methods does PC choose?
How far will they go?
Do they maintain Masquerade and avoid unnecessary harm?
Do they report honestly about their methods?
Do they ask clarifying questions or make assumptions?
The Target
The Ghoul: [TBD - Name]

Runs [TBD - technology consulting firm? Commercial real estate management company? Financial services firm?]
Competent but loyal to their domitor (Ventrue who's not in Phoenix)
The business is profitable but the Ventrue needs cash for other obligations
Ghoul has authority to negotiate sale if pressured correctly
The Business:

Legitimately valuable
Warner wants it for the client base, not the assets
Currently profitable but vulnerable to the right pressure
Why This Tests the PC
Judgment: What level of pressure is appropriate?
Loyalty: Will they follow Warner's interests or their own conscience?
Creativity: Can they create leverage without violence or Masquerade breaches?
Honesty: Will they tell Warner exactly what they did?
Ethics: Where are their lines?
Possible Approaches (PC Choice)
Legitimate Pressure:

Create business problems (regulatory issues, competitor pressure, lost contracts)
Make generous offer that's hard to refuse
Demonstrate that selling is best option for everyone
Gray Area:

Blackmail (discover ghoul's secrets, threaten exposure)
Sabotage (cause "accidents" that hurt business)
Intimidation (threaten the ghoul or their interests)
Manipulation (dominate key employees, create internal chaos)
Crossing Lines:

Violence against ghoul or employees
Masquerade-threatening actions
Harming innocents unnecessarily
Creating long-term enemies for Warner
The Trap
This is Warner's real test. He's watching to see if PC:

Asks clarifying questions: "What methods are acceptable? What's off limits?"
Proposes their approach: Before acting, explains plan to Warner
Shows judgment: Chooses effective method that doesn't create bigger problems
Reports honestly: Tells Warner exactly what they did, good and bad
Complications (Choose 2-3)
The Ghoul is Sympathetic: Single parent, supporting sick family member, genuinely good person caught in bad situation
Ventrue Domitor Shows Up: Owner arrives in Phoenix to investigate what's happening
Other Bidder: Another Kindred (possibly an Anarch) is also trying to acquire the business through different methods
Ghoul Has Allies: More connected than expected - has friends who investigate PC's activities
PC Has Connection: PC knows someone who works at the business or knows the ghoul personally
Moral Witness: Another PC or NPC the character respects observes their methods
Unintended Consequences: PC's pressure tactics hurt innocent mortals (employees lose jobs, etc.)
Success Criteria
What Warner Actually Wants:

Business acquired at reasonable price
No Masquerade breaches
No unnecessary enemies created
Minimal collateral damage
PC shows good judgment and reports honestly
Warner's Secret Evaluation:

Did PC ask the right questions before acting?
Did they choose methods appropriate to the goal?
Did they show concern for consequences?
Did they report their methods honestly?
Would Warner trust them with more sensitive tasks?
Outcomes
PC Uses Violence/Excessive Force:

Warner gets the business but PC has proven they're a blunt instrument, not a scalpel
"You got results, but I need people with better judgment. I'll pay you for your work, but we're done here."
No loan, no future relationship
PC Uses Masquerade-Threatening Methods:

Warner has to clean up the mess
"You're a liability. We're done."
No loan, possible future antagonism
PC Uses Effective Legitimate/Gray Pressure:

Warner gets the business cleanly
"Good work. You showed judgment and effectiveness. That's what I need."
Loan approved (if other missions succeeded)
PC Refuses/Proposes Alternative:

"The target is a good person, I found a solution where we both profit without destroying them"
Warner respects the creativity and ethics (if solution works)
Can still get loan if approach is genuinely clever
PC Reports Dishonestly:

Warner has other sources (he's testing them)
Discovers the lie
"I can't work with people I don't trust. We're done."
No loan, possible future antagonism
After The Three Missions: The Decision
If PC Succeeded in All Three
Warner's Final Meeting: "You've proven yourself competent, discreet, and capable of good judgment. Those qualities are rare. I'm prepared to provide the funding you need."

The Terms:

Loan amount: [Sufficient for PC's need]
Interest: [Reasonable for Kindred - maybe 10-20% over extended period]
Collateral: [Something valuable to PC but not irreplaceable]
Terms: [Multi-year payment plan]
The Real Cost: Warner now has a relationship with PC. Future "opportunities" will arise. This is an investment in a long-term asset (the PC).
If PC Failed One Mission
Warner provides a smaller loan at higher interest
Or: Offers alternative arrangement (more tasks, less favorable terms)
The relationship is transactional, not partnership
If PC Failed Multiple Missions
"I appreciate your efforts, but I can't justify this investment. Perhaps [OTHER OPTION] can help you."
Door is closed
Warner may still use PC for simple tasks but won't invest in them
If PC Exceeded Expectations
Warner provides the loan at favorable terms
Offers additional opportunities
"I think we can do business together long-term. I value reliability."
Possible future: Warner becomes mentor/patron figure
The Alternative Option
Other Loan Source: [TBD - Should be available but with different costs/consequences]

Possibilities:

Piston: Has the money (from successful heist?), but terms involve criminal activity and Anarch obligations
Toreador Patron: Has money, wants artistic/social favors that conflict with PC's nature
Tremere: Has resources, wants magical services or blood bonds
Nosferatu Information Broker: Will provide money in exchange for becoming informant
Giovanni: Money is easy, soul-cost is high
Criminal Loan: Mortal organized crime at usurious rates with violent collection
The alternative should be viable but clearly worse than Warner's path if PC can pass his tests.
