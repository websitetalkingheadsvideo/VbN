Piston - Plot Hooks Database
Character: Piston (Generation 9 Brujah, Anarch) Location: Phoenix, Arizona (Surprise area) Campaign: Vampire the Masquerade - Phoenix by Night (1994)

Hook #1: "Talk Him Down" (Anarch Diplomacy)
Type: Political, Crisis Prevention Severity: High (Potential Masquerade Breach) Initiator: Bayside Bob

Setup
Bayside Bob approaches the PCs with a problem. Piston is planning something monumentally stupid - hijacking semi-trucks on the Phoenix-Vegas route. This will bring down massive heat from law enforcement, organized crime, and possibly the Camarilla who want to maintain the Masquerade. Bob needs someone to either talk Piston out of it or help him find a better solution for his money problems.

Complications
Piston is proud and doesn't take "advice" well, especially from people he doesn't know
His low mental stats mean logical arguments might not work - you need to appeal to his code or pride
If the PCs fail, they might get caught up in the disastrous aftermath
Success could earn Bob's favor but make Piston resentful
Potential Outcomes
Find legitimate funding for the bar
Broker a deal with someone who needs muscle
Convince Piston the heist is "beneath him"
Realize Bob has ulterior motives
Rewards
Bob's favor and political capital
Piston's grudging respect (if handled well)
Prevention of larger crisis
Hook #2: "The Auspex Problem" (Secret Exposure)
Type: Secret, Blackmail, Political Severity: Critical (Personal Destruction) Initiator: Auspex-using Kindred (Tremere, Toreador, etc.)

Setup
A Tremere, Toreador, or other Auspex-using Kindred at an Anarch gathering casually mentions seeing something disturbing in Piston's aura - black veins, the mark of diablerie. They haven't told anyone yet, but they're uncomfortable and might report it. The PCs overhear this conversation or are approached by either party.

Complications
Do the PCs tell Piston he's been compromised?
Do they tell Bob, who would use this as leverage?
Do they help cover it up or let the information spread?
The Auspex user might want something in exchange for silence
If word reaches the Gangrel clan, things get very bloody very fast
Potential Outcomes
Blackmail opportunities for all parties
Earning Piston's loyalty through warning
Creating a debt Bob can exploit
Triggering a Gangrel hunt
Rewards
Piston's eternal loyalty (if warned)
Blackmail material
Bob's favor (if informed)
Payment from Auspex user for handling situation
Hook #3: "Wrong House" (Criminal Blowback)
Type: Criminal, Crisis Management Severity: Medium-High (Exposure Risk) Initiator: Consequences of Butch Reed's burglary operation

Setup
Butch Reed's street contacts gave him bad intel. The "empty house" they robbed last night? It belonged to someone important - a ghoul of a Camarilla Ventrue, a mortal crime boss, or even a mortal with police/political connections. Now there's heat, and it's tracing back to Piston's operation. The PCs are asked to help clean up the mess.

Complications
Evidence might need to be destroyed or redirected
The victim might already be investigating
Butch or Basher might have been seen or left evidence
The actual owner might want revenge, not just their stuff back
Potential Outcomes
Frame someone else for the crime
Broker a peace deal with the victim
Recover the stolen goods before investigation completes
Escalate into gang war
Rewards
Piston's gratitude
Criminal contacts
Stolen goods if recovered
Favor from whoever hired you
Hook #4: "The Bar Opportunity" (Suspicious Benefactor)
Type: Mystery, Political Trap, Investigation Severity: Variable (Depends on the catch) Initiator: Unknown benefactor

Setup
Someone offers Piston exactly what he wants - a bar, cheap, available immediately. There's just one catch: [insert complication]. The PCs might be brought in as neutral parties to investigate whether this is legitimate or a trap.

Possible Complications (Choose One or Combine)
Camarilla Territory: The bar is on Camarilla-controlled land and this is a setup to justify action against Anarchs
Haunted: The bar is haunted or cursed (Giovanni dumping ground? Angry wraith? Bloodstained history?)
Ghost Revenge: The previous owner was murdered and their ghost wants revenge on whoever takes over
Organized Crime Front: It's a front for the mob/cartel and comes with "business partners" who expect cooperation
Occupied Haven: The basement is someone's haven and they're not happy about new owners taking the property
Bob's Hook: It's bait to draw Piston into Bob's debt or control - Bob arranged the whole thing
Sabbat Trap: Sabbat scouts are using it as bait to identify and eliminate Anarch leadership
Prince's Gambit: If Phoenix has a Prince or Camarilla presence, this could be political manipulation
Investigation Elements
Ownership Records: Who actually owns this property? Who owned it before?
History: What happened at this location? Any deaths, supernatural events, or criminal activity?
Benefactor: Who's offering the deal? What do they want in return?
Financial Trail: How is this being funded? Where's the money coming from?
Surveillance: Is someone watching to see if Piston takes the bait?
Contracts: What's in the fine print? Are there hidden obligations?
Complications During Investigation
Piston is impatient and wants to accept immediately
Butch and Basher are excited and pressure Piston to take the deal
Bob learns about the offer and either warns against it or encourages it (depending on his involvement)
The benefactor is pressuring for a quick decision
Other parties are also interested in the property
Time limit before the offer expires
Investigating too deeply alerts the person behind it
Potential Outcomes
Help Piston Get His Bar: PCs determine it's legitimate (or close enough) and help him acquire it, possibly negotiating better terms
Expose the Trap: PCs uncover the true purpose and save Piston from disaster, earning his loyalty
Walk Into Disaster: PCs either can't find the catch or Piston ignores their warnings, and everyone deals with consequences
Turn the Tables: PCs figure out how to use the trap against whoever set it
Steal the Opportunity: PCs decide they want the bar for themselves
Broker a Deal: PCs negotiate a solution where Piston gets the bar but with acceptable strings attached
Rewards
Piston's profound gratitude and loyalty
Part ownership or access to the bar
Exposure of a major plot (Bob's manipulation, Camarilla scheme, etc.)
Political capital from preventing disaster
The bar itself if PCs take it
Long-term Consequences
If it's Bob's trap and PCs expose it: Bob becomes an enemy or at least distrusts PCs
If it's legitimate and Piston gets it: The bar becomes a regular location and Anarch stronghold
If it's haunted and they take it anyway: Ongoing supernatural complications
If organized crime is involved: New criminal contacts and obligations
Hook #5: "Ghost of LA" (Past Catches Up)
Type: Combat, Political, Moral Choice Severity: Critical (Potential Character Death) Initiator: Gangrel hunter from Los Angeles

Setup
A Gangrel arrives in Phoenix asking questions about a diablerist who fled LA in the early 90s. They have a description that matches Piston. They're methodical, patient, and absolutely determined. The PCs encounter this hunter before they find Piston - what do they do?

Complications
The Gangrel is generation 8 or 9, making them a serious threat even to Piston
They're asking around, which means others will learn about the diablerie
They might offer the PCs a reward for information
Piston doesn't know they're coming yet
Bob might see this as the perfect "hook" to control Piston - save him and he owes you
Potential Outcomes
Warn Piston (earning his trust)
Help the Gangrel (earning their favor)
Try to mediate between them
Stay out of it and watch the bloodbath
Rewards
Piston's eternal loyalty (if saved)
Gangrel clan favor (if helped)
Boon from Bob (if he orchestrates rescue)
Diablerie opportunity if both sides destroy each other
Hook #6: "Basher's Victim" (Masquerade Breach Risk)
Type: Masquerade Threat, Crisis Management Severity: High (Potential Masquerade Breach) Initiator: Basher's sloppy mugging operation

Setup
Basher got sloppy during a downtown mugging. His victim survived and got a good look at him - too good. Now they're posting on early internet forums and BBS systems about a "vampire" attack, complete with descriptions. The Nosferatu have noticed. The Camarilla has noticed. Someone needs to handle this before it becomes a Masquerade breach.

Complications
The victim is paranoid and armed now
They've told friends/family who might need to be dealt with
Basher is defensive and doesn't think he did anything wrong
Piston is protective of his childer but also needs this fixed
The Camarilla might use this as justification to move into Anarch territory
Potential Outcomes
Silence the witness (how far do PCs go?)
Discredit them as crazy
Use Dominate to erase memories
Sacrifice Basher to appease authorities
Rewards
Preventing Masquerade breach
Camarilla or Nosferatu favor
Piston's gratitude (if handled without killing Basher)
Hook #7: "Fred Rides In" (Sire Returns)
Type: Personal Drama, Relationship, Judgment Severity: Medium (Emotional/Political impact) Initiator: Fred Osmond (Piston's sire)

Setup
Fred Osmond rolls into Phoenix on his Harley after years of wandering. He's heard rumors about his childe - some good, some very bad. He wants to see what Piston's built and judge whether the boy has become someone worthy of the Embrace. The PCs might encounter Fred first, or be present when the reunion happens.

Complications
Does Fred know about the diablerie? If not, will someone tell him?
Fred's nomadic philosophy might clash with Piston's territorial approach
Fred might approve of the diablerie as a power move, or be disgusted by it
Other Anarchs might try to recruit Fred or use him against Piston
Fred's arrival could draw attention from enemies tracking the wanderer
Potential Outcomes
Father-son reconciliation
Bitter conflict between sire and childe
Fred staying in Phoenix (new NPC)
Fred leading Piston down a darker path
Rewards
New ally (Fred) if befriended
Insight into Piston's past
Potential mentor in Fred

Hook #8: "The Semi-Truck Job Goes Wrong" (Damage Control)
Type: Crisis Management, Combat, Cover-up Severity: Critical (Multiple system exposure) Initiator: Piston's failed heist attempt

Setup
Despite everyone's warnings, Piston pulled the trigger on the heist. It went catastrophically wrong. Now there's [dead truckers/missing cargo/police investigation/mob retaliation/injured coterie members] and the PCs are called in for emergency damage control because they're the only ones who might be able to save this situation.

Complications
Law enforcement is actively investigating
The cargo belonged to organized crime who want blood
One of Piston's coterie is injured or captured
Evidence could expose the Masquerade
Bob is furious and wants Piston punished or brought to heel
The Camarilla sees this as proof Anarchs can't maintain order
Potential Outcomes
Salvage the situation and earn Piston's eternal loyalty
Let him burn and watch Bob take control
Use the chaos to advance your own agenda
Clean up leads to deeper entanglement
Rewards
Piston's life-debt loyalty
Bob's political favor
Stolen cargo if recovered
Leverage over multiple parties
Hook #9: "Butch's Ambition" (Internal Betrayal)
Type: Betrayal, Political Intrigue, Moral Choice Severity: High (Potential character death, coterie destruction) Initiator: Butch Reed (Piston's childe)

Setup
Butch Reed has been talking to someone - Bob, a Camarilla agent, or even LA contacts. He's learned the truth about Piston's diablerie and is now considering his options. Does he stay loyal? Does he try to diablerize Piston himself and take the generation 9 power? Does he sell the information to the highest bidder? The PCs learn about this before Piston does.

Complications
Butch might approach the PCs as potential allies
Piston trusts his childer completely - convincing him of betrayal is nearly impossible
Basher is still loyal and will defend Piston
Bob might be orchestrating this whole thing
If Butch succeeds in diablerizing Piston, he becomes an even bigger problem
Potential Outcomes
Stop the betrayal before it happens
Help Butch succeed (darker choice)
Warn Piston (testing his trust)
Exploit the chaos for personal gain
Rewards
Piston's loyalty (if saved)
Butch's loyalty (if helped)

Hook #10: "The Competition" (Territorial Challenge)
Type: Combat, Political, Territory War Severity: High (Potential faction war) Initiator: Rival faction challenging Surprise territory

Setup
Another group wants Surprise - maybe Camarilla Kindred expanding territory, maybe a Sabbat pack scouting, maybe even mortal organized crime that doesn't appreciate Piston's burglary operation cutting into their action. They've issued a challenge: leave or fight. Piston chooses fight. He needs allies.

Complications
The PCs might have connections to the challenging faction
This could escalate into full factional war
Piston's coterie is only three vampires - they need help
Bob might withhold Anarch support unless Piston agrees to his terms
The farmhouse is defensible but vulnerable during the day
Winning might draw attention Piston doesn't want
Potential Outcomes
Help Piston defend his territory (earning his loyalty)
Broker a peace deal (earning Bob's respect)
Let Piston fall and claim Surprise for yourselves
Use the conflict to advance larger political goals
Rewards
Territory if Piston falls
Piston's eternal loyalty if defended

New domain for PCs if negotiated
Using These Hooks
Implementation Strategies
Stand-alone Sessions: Single-night adventures with clear objectives

Hooks #3, #6, and #8 work well as one-shots
Campaign Arcs: Multi-session storylines with escalating complications

Hooks #2, #4, #5, and #9 can span multiple sessions
Interconnected Sequences: Several hooks triggering in sequence

Example chain: Hook #1 fails ? #8 happens ? #2 gets discovered during chaos ? #5 arrives to capitalize ? #7 shows up to see what his childe has become
Background Noise: Events happening whether PCs engage or not

Any hook can run in the background, affecting the larger Phoenix Kindred community
Character Dynamics
Piston's combination of:

Raw physical power (Generation 9, maxed combat stats)
Poor judgment (Mental 4, impulsive nature)
Dark secrets (diablerie, marked aura)
Fierce loyalty (to his childer and code)
...makes him a versatile NPC who can be ally, enemy, or complicated mix of both depending on PC choices.

Difficulty Scaling
Easy: Hooks #1, #3, #7 (Diplomatic or investigative solutions available) Medium: Hooks #4, #6, #10 (Multiple challenges, some combat) Hard: Hooks #2, #5, #9 (High stakes, powerful opposition) Very Hard: Hook #8 (Multiple simultaneous crises)

Notes for Storytellers
Piston's low mental stats should be played consistently - he makes gut decisions, not calculated ones
His Hell's Angels code is his moral compass - loyalty, brotherhood, never back down
The diablerie guilt is buried deep but surfaces when he's alone or questioned about LA
Bob's manipulation should feel subtle until it's too late
Butch and Basher are loyal until given reason not to be
Fred Osmond is a wild card - his wanderer nature makes him unpredictable
Created for: Vampire the Masquerade - Phoenix by Night (1994) Character: Piston (Generation 9 Brujah, Anarch Movement) Location: Surprise, Arizona (Northwest Phoenix suburbs) Status: Active NPC, available for plot integration
