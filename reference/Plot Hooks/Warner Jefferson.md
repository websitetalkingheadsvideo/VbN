    "three_mission_arc": "PC needs significant money. Warner is one of two options. He offers three escalating tests disguised as business opportunities. Success in all three with positive reputation earns the loan. See separate document: 'Warner Jefferson - Three Mission Test Arc'",
    "tremere_giovanni_investigation": "Warner and Markus are mapping Tremere and Giovanni financial holdings for the Ventrue Primogen. PCs could: be hired to help gather intelligence, accidentally discover the investigation and become complications, be approached by Tremere/Giovanni who've detected surveillance, or be used as unknowing cover for Warner's operations.",
    "victoria_visits": "Victoria Ashford-Sterling arrives in Phoenix to check on Warner's progress. Her presence creates political ripples. Does she approve of his methods? Is she disappointed? Do her enemies see opportunity to strike at her through Warner? PCs could be caught in the crossfire.",
    "corporate_ties_leverage": "Warner's Corporate Ties merit means he knows where bodies are buried in Phoenix business world. PCs could: seek his insider information, be hired to verify information he provides, discover he's manipulating them through corporate channels, or need him to open doors they can't open alone.",
    "proving_victoria_exploitation": "Warner's Driving Goal flaw makes him vulnerable. Enemies could: frame him as Victoria's 'failed experiment', sabotage his operations to make him look incompetent, or use his need to succeed against him. PCs might be unwitting tools or recognize the manipulation.",
    "primogen_politics": "Warner has Status 3 and Primogen's trust. Other Camarilla members might: resent his rapid rise, try to use him as stepping stone, want him as ally against rivals, or test whether he's truly loyal or just Victoria's plant. PCs could be caught in Camarilla power struggles.",

    "old_guard_challenge": "Traditional Ventrue elder visits Phoenix and challenges Warner's legitimacy. 'You're not real Ventrue, you're Victoria's pet project.' How does Warner respond? Do PCs witness/participate? Does this threaten his position?",
    "chicago_past_returns": "Someone from Warner's mortal life appears - former colleague, family member who doesn't know he's 'dead', or business rival from Wall Street days. Threatens Masquerade or brings uncomfortable memories. Does Warner handle it personally or need help?",
    "tech_boom_positioning": "1994 is right before internet explosion. Warner is positioning to profit. Who else sees this opportunity? Race against time and rivals to control coming tech boom. PCs could be hired as operatives in corporate espionage.",

    "tremere_giovanni_discovery": "What if the targets realize they're being investigated?

Assassination attempts, reputation attacks, or political sabotage could target him as proxy warfare against his sire."
