**For Character Sheet Screen:**

```

```

**In-Game HUD Elements:**

**Minimalist Corner Display:**
```
[‚ô•] 8  [‚Äª] 3  [‚óÜ] 4
(Humanity/Conscience/Self-Control)
```

**Pop-up Warning System:**
When player is about to commit a sin:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: HUMANITY TEST

Your Humanity (8) is at risk

```

**After Failed Conscience Test:**

You feel yourself becoming more callous...
The weight of your actions grows lighter.
```

**Status Effects/Visual Feedback:**
- **High Humanity (8-10):** Warm color palette, emotional dialogue options, NPCs more trusting
- **Medium Humanity (5-7):** Neutral tones, balanced options
- **Low Humanity (1-4):** Desaturated colors, predatory dialogue, NPCs fearful, red warning indicators

**Detailed Character Sheet Tab:**
Include an expandable "Hierarchy of Sins" reference that players can mouse over for tooltips explaining each level.

Would you like me to create a mockup of the full UI interface or develop the degeneration system mechanics?
