### **Teaser Ideas**

#### **Violet – Nosferatu**
- **Line teaser:** "In the shadows, she sees all. What you hide, she collects."
- **Visual teaser:** Half-hidden in the veranda shadows, scarf catching the chandelier light, eyes glinting as if aware of every whispered secret.
- **Mini-scenario teaser:** Player glimpses a rat scurrying across the garden; it stops, looks back, and suddenly Violet’s silhouette is there, vanished before it can be spoken about.

#### **Jax – Ravnos**
- **Line teaser:** "Every trick has a price… sometimes, you are the coin."
- **Visual teaser:** Mirage of sand flickering across the gallery floor, Jax’s eyes glimmering with mischief, guests unsure if what they saw was real.
- **Mini-scenario teaser:** A soft whisper in the hallway: "They said it was empty…" — and a fleeting shadow dances along the walls, vanishing when turned to face.

#### **Scene Teasers – Monthly Gathering**
- Guests clustered under amber light, polite smiles masking ambition and fear.
- Distant chandelier glimmer, reflecting obsidian walls and hidden eyes.
- An unseen illusion briefly sparks panic; no one knows if it’s real — except a few observant players.

#### **Lore Snippets**
- Northern Scottsdale holds hidden power nodes — ancient Toreador influence persists beneath contemporary wealth.
- The Hawthorne Estate was built with secrets as much as luxury: every corner, reflection, and stairwell tells a story.
- Street-level Kindred hold fragile influence, but even whispers can reshape alliances if delivered correctly.
