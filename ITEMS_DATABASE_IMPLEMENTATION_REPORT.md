# Items Database Management System - Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented a comprehensive Items Database Management System for the VbN (Valley by Night) project. This new admin interface provides complete CRUD operations for managing items in the database while seamlessly integrating with the existing character equipment assignment system.

## Project Scope

   - Assignment count checking for delete operations

3. **`css/admin_items.css`** - External stylesheet
   - Gothic theme styling consistent with admin panels
   - Badge system for item types and rarities
   - Modal and form styling
   - Responsive design elements

4. **`js/admin_items.js`** - JavaScript functionality
   - Table sorting and filtering
   - Pagination controls
   - Modal operations
   - CRUD API integration
   - Equipment assignment functionality

### Files Modified (6)
1. **`index.php`** - Updated navigation link
2. **`admin/api_items.php`** - Fixed database connection path
3. **`admin/api_admin_add_equipment.php`** - Fixed database connection path
4. **`admin/api_get_equipment.php`** - Fixed database connection path
5. **`admin/api_admin_remove_equipment.php`** - Fixed database connection path
6. **`admin/api_admin_update_equipment.php`** - Fixed database connection path

## Technical Challenges Resolved

### 1. Database Connection Path Issues
