# Character Image System Implementation Summary

## ✅ Completed Implementation

### 1. Database Migration Script
- **File:** `database/add_character_image_column.php`
- **Function:** Adds `character_image` column to the `characters` table
- **Status:** Script created, needs to be run manually via web interface

### 2. PHP Endpoints
- **upload_character_image.php** ✅
  - Validates user authentication
  - Checks character ownership and editability (blocks NPCs and finalized characters)
  - Validates file type (JPG, PNG, GIF)
  - Validates file size (2MB max)
  - Saves file to `/uploads/characters/` directory
  - Updates database with file path
  - Returns JSON response

- **remove_character_image.php** ✅
  - Validates user authentication
  - Checks character ownership and editability
  - Deletes file from filesystem
  - Sets `character_image` to NULL in database
  - Returns JSON response

### 3. JavaScript Module
- **File:** `js/character_image.js`
- **Features:**
  - `CharacterImageManager` class
  - File selection with preview
  - Client-side validation (type, size)
  - Upload functionality with progress
  - Remove functionality with confirmation
  - Image display with fallback logic
  - Integration ready for existing notification system

### 4. CSS Styles
- **File:** `css/character_image.css`
- **Features:**
  - Character image container styling (200x200px)
  - Responsive 2-column layout
  - Dark World of Darkness aesthetic
  - Upload/remove button styles
  - Clan icon and placeholder styles
  - Mobile-responsive adjustments

### 5. UI Integration
- **Updated:** `lotn_char_create.php`
  - Added CSS link in `<head>`
  - Added JS script before closing `</body>`
  - Modified basic info tab with 2-column layout:
    - Left: Character Name, Player Name, Chronicle
    - Right: Character Portrait (200x200px image box with upload controls)

### 6. Directory Structure
- Created: `/uploads/characters/` directory for image storage
- Created: `/images/svgs/` directory for clan SVG icons (needs SVG files)

## ⚠️ Manual Steps Required

### 1. Run Database Migration
The `character_image` column needs to be added to the database. You can run the migration script via:
- Direct URL: `http://vbn.talkingheads.video/database/add_character_image_column.php`
- Or execute via terminal with proper MySQL connection

### 2. Add Clan SVG Files
Place clan SVG files in `/images/svgs/` directory:
- `/images/svgs/Assamite.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Brujah.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Caitiff.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Gangrel.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Giovanni.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Lasombra.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Malkavian.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Nosferatu.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Ravnos.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Toreador.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Tremere.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Tzimisce.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Ventrue.svg`
- `/images/svgs/Followers of Set.svg`

Or you can use a default silhouette image at `/assets/default_silhouette.png`

### 3. Update Character Loading Logic
The image manager needs to be initialized when loading existing characters. Add this to your character loading code in `js/modules/main.js`:

```javascript
// In loadCharacter method, after character data loads:
if (characterData.character && characterImageManager) {
    characterImageManager.setCharacterId(characterData.character.id, characterData);
}
```

### 4. Set Character ID for New Characters
When creating a new character, you need to set the character ID after save:

```javascript
// After character is saved and character_id is returned:
if (result.character_id && characterImageManager) {
    characterImageManager.characterId = result.character_id;
}
```

## 📝 Implementation Logic

### Image Display Priority
1. **User uploaded image** → `character_image` field (if exists)
2. **Clan SVG** → For NPCs and finalized characters without uploaded image
3. **Default silhouette** → For editable characters without uploaded image

### Editability Rules
Characters **CAN** upload/remove images if:
- User is logged in
- User owns the character
- `pc = 1` (is a player character)
- `player_name !== 'ST/NPC'`
- `status !== 'finalized'`

Characters **CANNOT** upload/remove images if:
- `pc = 0` OR `player_name = 'ST/NPC'` (NPC)
- `status = 'finalized'` (finalized character)

### File Storage
- **Location:** `/uploads/characters/`
- **Naming:** `{character_id}_{timestamp}_{hash}.{ext}`
- **Example:** `15_1694567890_a3f5c2e1.jpg`
- **Database:** Stores relative path: `/uploads/characters/filename.jpg`

## 🎨 Visual Layout

```
[Basic Information Tab]
├─ Character Name * [input field]
├─ Player Name * [input field]
├─ Chronicle [input field]
└─ Character Portrait [200x200 image box]
   ├─ [Image preview or clan SVG]
   ├─ "Choose Image" button
   ├─ "Upload Image" button (appears when file selected)
   └─ "Remove Image" button (appears when image exists)
```

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ Session-based authentication check
- ✅ Ownership verification (user_id match)
- ✅ File type validation (whitelist approach)
- ✅ File size validation (2MB limit)
- ✅ Sanitized filenames (no path traversal)
- ✅ NPC/finalized character protection
- ✅ Unique filename generation (prevents overwrites)
- ✅ Prepared SQL statements

## 📦 Next Steps

1. **Run database migration** manually
2. **Add clan SVG files** or default silhouette
3. **Test upload** with a character
4. **Integrate with character save/load** logic
5. **Test remove** functionality
6. **Verify responsive** layout on mobile

## 🐛 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload image for new character
- [ ] Upload image for existing editable character
- [ ] Remove uploaded image
- [ ] Attempt upload for NPC (should fail)
- [ ] Attempt upload for finalized character (should fail)
- [ ] Test file type validation (non-image files)
- [ ] Test file size validation (files > 2MB)
- [ ] Verify image persists after page reload
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Verify clan SVG displays for NPCs
- [ ] Verify default placeholder for editable PCs without images
