- **Version increment**: Bumped project version to 0.7.6 (patch) per version rules
- **Character image UX**: Added external CSS/JS for square preview and robust Exit Editor button
  - `css/character-image.css`, `js/character-image.js`
  - `css/exit-button.css`, `js/exit-editor.js`
- **Edits**: Integrated assets into `lotn_char_create.php`; adjusted `save_character.php` and `upload_character_image.php`
- **Repo hygiene**: Removed obsolete reference character JSONs

- **Rationale**: Changes are incremental UI/UX improvements and supportive plumbing, not a complete new feature â†’ patch increment.

- **Next**:
  - Wire any remaining image upload flows to preview states and error handling
  - Verify cross-page availability of Exit button styles/scripts
