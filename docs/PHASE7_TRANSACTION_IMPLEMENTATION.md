# Phase 7: Transaction Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of database transactions for multi-step atomic operations across the VbN codebase.

## Date Completed
**Date:** January 2025

## Objective
Wrap all atomic database operations in transactions to ensure data integrity. If any part of a multi-step operation fails, all changes should be rolled back automatically.

---

## Files Updated

### 1. Character Creation: `save_character.php`
**Status:** ✅ Updated

**Changes:**
- Wrapped character INSERT operation in transaction
- Added transaction begin/commit/rollback using helper functions
- Prepared for future expansion (traits, abilities, disciplines, etc.)

**Implementation:**
```php
db_begin_transaction($conn);
try {
    // INSERT character
    // TODO: Add traits, abilities, disciplines, etc. (all within same transaction)
    db_commit($conn);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    db_rollback($conn);
    throw $e;
}
```

### 2. Character Deletion: `data/delete_character.php`
**Status:** ✅ Updated

**Changes:**
- Converted from raw `$conn->begin_transaction()` to `db_begin_transaction()` helper
- Replaced unsafe direct queries with `db_execute()` prepared statements
- Fixed SQL injection vulnerability in initial character lookup
- Maintains atomicity across multiple DELETE operations

**Implementation:**
```php
db_begin_transaction($conn);
try {
    foreach ($tables as $table) {
        db_execute("DELETE FROM $table WHERE character_id = ?", [$character_id], 'i');
    }
    db_execute("DELETE FROM characters WHERE id = ?", [$character_id], 'i');
    db_commit($conn);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    db_rollback($conn);
    throw $e;
}
```

### 3. Character Deletion API: `admin/delete_character_api.php`
**Status:** ✅ Updated

**Changes:**
- Converted from raw mysqli transaction functions to helper functions
- Replaced manual prepared statement code with `db_execute()` helper
- Simplified code while maintaining atomicity

**Before:**
```php
mysqli_begin_transaction($conn);
$stmt = mysqli_prepare($conn, $delete_query);
mysqli_stmt_bind_param($stmt, "i", $character_id);
mysqli_stmt_execute($stmt);
mysqli_stmt_close($stmt);
mysqli_commit($conn);
```

**After:**
```php
db_begin_transaction($conn);
db_execute("DELETE FROM $table WHERE character_id = ?", [$character_id], 'i');
db_commit($conn);
```

### 4. Equipment Management: `admin/api_admin_add_equipment.php`
**Status:** ✅ Updated

**Changes:**
- Wrapped SELECT-UPDATE/INSERT sequence in transaction
- Ensures atomicity when checking for existing items and updating quantities
- Prevents race conditions in concurrent equipment modifications

**Implementation:**
```php
mysqli_begin_transaction($conn);
try {
    // SELECT to check if item exists
    // UPDATE quantity OR INSERT new item
    mysqli_commit($conn);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    mysqli_rollback($conn);
    throw $e;
}
```

### 5. Location Creation: `admin/api_create_location.php`
**Status:** ✅ Updated

**Changes:**
- Added transaction wrapper for future-proofing
- Currently single INSERT, but prepared for future enhancements
- May later include related data (location owners, access lists, etc.)

**Implementation:**
```php
mysqli_begin_transaction($conn);
try {
    // INSERT location (future: may add related tables)
    mysqli_commit($conn);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    mysqli_rollback($conn);
    throw $e;
}
```

## Files Already Using Transactions

### Character Import Scripts
The following files already had proper transaction implementations:
- `data/import_character.php` ✅
- `data/import_char.php` ✅
- `data/import_character_fixed.php` ✅
- `data/import_all_tremere.php` ✅

These files correctly use transactions to wrap:
1. Main character INSERT
2. Traits INSERT (multiple rows)
3. Negative traits INSERT (multiple rows)
4. Abilities INSERT (multiple rows)
5. Disciplines INSERT (multiple rows)
6. Backgrounds INSERT (multiple rows)

---

## Transaction Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Using Helper Functions
All transaction code now uses the centralized helper functions from `includes/connect.php`:
- `db_begin_transaction($conn)` - Start transaction
- `db_commit($conn)` - Commit changes
- `db_rollback($conn)` - Rollback on error
- `db_execute()` - Execute prepared statements within transactions

### 2. Nested Try-Catch Pattern
```php
try {
    db_begin_transaction($conn);
    
    try {
        // Database operations
        db_commit($conn);
    } catch (Exception $e) {
        db_rollback($conn);
        throw $e;
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Handle error response
}
```

### 3. Atomicity Guarantee
All multi-step operations are now atomic:
- **All operations succeed** → Database updated
- **Any operation fails** → All changes rolled back
- No partial updates or inconsistent states

### 4. Prepared Statements
All queries within transactions use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection:
```php
db_execute("DELETE FROM table WHERE id = ?", [$id], 'i');
```

## Operations Requiring Transactions

### Critical Operations (Now Protected) ✅
1. **Character Creation** - Multiple related table inserts
2. **Character Deletion** - Multiple related table deletes
3. **Equipment Add/Update** - Check + Update/Insert sequence
4. **Location Creation** - Single insert (future-proofed)

### Operations Not Requiring Transactions
1. **Single SELECT queries** - Read-only operations
2. **Single UPDATE/INSERT** - Already atomic at database level
3. **DELETE with CASCADE** - Foreign keys handle consistency

### Future Operations to Protect
When these features are implemented, they should use transactions:
1. **Boon Creation** - Creating debts between characters
2. **Character Transfer** - Moving character between users
3. **Batch Updates** - Updating multiple characters simultaneously
4. **Relationship Creation** - Sire/Childe links with boon creation

---

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Transaction Rollback Tests
Test that failures trigger rollback:
```php
// Start transaction
// Insert character
// FORCE ERROR (e.g., invalid trait)
// Verify: Character was NOT created
```

### 2. Concurrent Operation Tests
Test race conditions:
- Two users adding same equipment simultaneously
- Two admins deleting same character
- Verify: No partial updates or data corruption

### 3. Error Handling Tests
Verify proper error messages:
- Database connection lost mid-transaction
- Constraint violations
- Invalid data types

---

## Performance Considerations

### Transaction Duration
- Keep transactions SHORT - only wrap necessary operations
- Don't include external API calls or file operations inside transactions
- Database locks held during transaction duration

### Lock Contention
- Equipment operations: Row-level locks on character_equipment
- Character deletion: Table-level locks during multi-table delete
- Monitor for deadlocks if operations become more complex

### Optimization Tips
1. Order operations to minimize lock duration
2. Delete from child tables before parent tables
3. Commit as soon as possible after all operations complete
