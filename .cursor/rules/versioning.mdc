# Version Incrementing Rules

## **Version Format: X.Y.Z**
- **X** (Major): Only increment when explicitly told by user
- **Y** (Minor): Increment for new WORKING features that are fully functional
- **Z** (Patch): Increment for general updates, bug fixes, or work-in-progress features

## **Increment Rules:**

### **Patch Version (Z) - Small Updates**
- **When to increment:** Bug fixes, small improvements, trait additions, UI tweaks, CSS/styling improvements, typography changes, documentation updates, font system changes, work-in-progress features that don't actually work yet
- **Examples:**
  - Adding new traits to existing categories
  - Fixing JavaScript bugs
  - CSS styling improvements
  - Small UI enhancements
  - Documentation updates
  - Typography system changes
  - Character saving work that doesn't work yet

### **Minor Version (Y) - New WORKING Features**
- **When to increment:** New tabs/sections that are FULLY FUNCTIONAL, new functionality that ACTUALLY WORKS, complete systems that are implemented and tested, major UI overhauls that are complete
- **Examples:**
  - Completing entire tabs (Abilities, Disciplines, Backgrounds) that work
  - Adding new systems (negative traits, category tracking) that are complete
  - Major UI overhauls that are complete
  - Database integration features that work
  - New character management features that work

### **Major Version (X) - Only When Told**
- **When to increment:** Only when user explicitly requests
- **Examples:**
  - Complete system rewrites
  - Major architectural changes
  - Breaking changes
  - Platform migrations

**Key principle: If it doesn't work, it's a patch. If it works completely, it's a minor.**

## **Implementation Process:**

1. **Update PHP constant:**
   ```php
   define('LOTN_VERSION', '0.2.1'); // Example patch increment
   ```

2. **Update version display:**
   ```html
   <span class="version">v<?php echo LOTN_VERSION; ?></span>
   ```

3. **Update VERSION.md:**
   - Add new version entry
   - List changes made
   - Update current version reference

4. **Commit with version tag:**
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: Add new traits - v0.2.1"
   git tag v0.2.1
   ```

## **Current Version: 0.2.0**
