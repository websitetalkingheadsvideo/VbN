## Next Session Goals: Character Image Upload & Display

### Primary Objective:
Add character portrait/image functionality to the character sheet and character creator.

### Planned Features:

#### 1. **Character Image Upload System**
- [ ] Add image upload field to character creator (Basic Info tab)
- [ ] Support common formats (JPG, PNG, WEBP, GIF)
- [ ] Client-side image preview before save
- [ ] Image validation (size, format, dimensions)
- [ ] Optional image cropping/resizing

#### 2. **Database Schema Updates**
- [ ] Add `character_image` field to `characters` table (VARCHAR for filename or TEXT for base64)
- [ ] Decide: Store as filename (with images folder) vs base64 in database
- [ ] Add migration script for database update

#### 3. **Image Storage Strategy**
**Option A: File System Storage (Recommended)**
- Store in `images/characters/` folder
- Database stores filename only: `character_123_portrait.jpg`
- Pros: Better performance, easier to manage, smaller database
- Cons: Need to manage file uploads, deletions

**Option B: Database Base64 Storage**
- Store image as base64 TEXT in database
- Pros: Single source of truth, easier backups
- Cons: Larger database, slower queries

#### 4. **Character Sheet Display**
- [ ] Add character portrait to character sheet (character_sheet.php)
- [ ] Position in header or sidebar
- [ ] Fallback to default silhouette if no image
- [ ] Responsive sizing for mobile

#### 5. **Character Creator Integration**
- [ ] Add image upload control to Basic Info tab
- [ ] Real-time preview in character preview sidebar
- [ ] Save image with character data
- [ ] Handle image in `save_character.php`
- [ ] Load existing image in `load_character.php`

#### 6. **Admin Panel Integration**
- [ ] Display character portraits in admin character list
- [ ] Thumbnail view option
- [ ] Click to view full-size image

#### 7. **Image Management**
- [ ] Delete old image when uploading new one
- [ ] Delete image when character is deleted
- [ ] Image compression/optimization
- [ ] Maximum file size enforcement (e.g., 2MB)

### Technical Considerations:

**File Upload PHP:**
```php
// Handle file upload
if (isset($_FILES['character_image'])) {
    $allowed = ['jpg', 'jpeg', 'png', 'webp', 'gif'];
    $filename = $_FILES['character_image']['name'];
    $ext = strtolower(pathinfo($filename, PATHINFO_EXTENSION));
    
    if (in_array($ext, $allowed) && $_FILES['character_image']['size'] <= 2097152) {
        $new_filename = 'character_' . $character_id . '_' . time() . '.' . $ext;
        move_uploaded_file($_FILES['character_image']['tmp_name'], 
                          'images/characters/' . $new_filename);
    }
}
```

**JavaScript Preview:**
```javascript
// Preview image before upload
document.getElementById('characterImage').addEventListener('change', function(e) {
    const file = e.target.files[0];
    if (file) {
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = function(event) {
            document.getElementById('imagePreview').src = event.target.result;
        };
        reader.readAsDataURL(file);
    }
});
```

### Using HTML2Canvas for Character Sheet Export:
Once we have character images working, we can:
1. Export character sheets as images (already have the tools)
2. Include character portrait in the exported image
3. Share character sheets on social media
4. Generate PDF versions (future enhancement)

### Files to Modify:
- `lotn_char_create.php` - Add image upload field
- `save_character.php` - Handle image upload/save
- `load_character.php` - Load existing image
- `character_sheet.php` - Display character portrait
- `admin/admin_panel.php` - Show thumbnails in list
- `admin/view_character_api.php` - Include image in view modal
- `admin/delete_character_api.php` - Delete image file with character
- `js/modules/main.js` - Handle image preview and validation
- `css/lotn_char_create.css` - Style image upload controls

### Database Migration Script Needed:
```sql
-- Add character_image column to characters table
ALTER TABLE characters 
ADD COLUMN character_image VARCHAR(255) DEFAULT NULL 
AFTER biography;

-- Add index for faster queries
CREATE INDEX idx_character_image ON characters(character_image);
```

### Default/Fallback Images Needed:
- Default male silhouette
- Default female silhouette
- Default generic vampire silhouette
- Or: Single placeholder image for all characters

### Future Enhancements (Not This Session):
- AI-generated character portraits (Stable Diffusion, DALL-E)
- Multiple character images (gallery)
- Character image backgrounds/frames
- Clan-specific image templates
- Character image filters/effects

---

## Quick Start for Next Session:

1. **Create character images folder**: `mkdir images/characters`
2. **Run database migration** to add `character_image` column
3. **Add upload field** to Basic Info tab in character creator
4. **Implement file upload** in `save_character.php`
5. **Add image display** to character sheet and preview
6. **Test with sample images**

## Questions to Decide:
1. File system storage vs database base64?
2. Maximum image size limit? (Recommend 2MB)
3. Resize/compress images server-side or client-side?
4. Allow multiple images per character or just one portrait?
5. Default fallback image style (silhouette, clan logo, custom)?
