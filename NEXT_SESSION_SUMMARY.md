## 🚀 Next Session Priorities

### 1. **Server Setup** (When DNS propagation completes)
- Navigate to: `http://yourdomain.com/admin/setup_npc_tracker.php`
- Click "Run Database Setup" button
- Test the NPC tracker pages

### 2. **Character Sheet Creation** (High Priority)
**Ready for Sheets:**
- **Silas Thornwood** - Gangrel Archon (full backstory complete)
- **Darrell Buyers** - Nosferatu Autarkis (full backstory complete)  
- **Victor Marchetti** - Toreador (deceased, flashback use)

**Concept Only:**

### 3. **PC Hook Development**
**Nosferatu PC Concept:** "The Student"
- Young Nosferatu trained by Buyers in information warfare
- Sent to infiltrate Phoenix Elysium and observe Cordelia
- Mission: Find her breaking point, report back, wait for signal
- **Conflict:** Loyalty to mentor vs. developing Phoenix relationships
- **Cordelia's Response:** Likely tries to turn them (Option B)

### 4. **Plot Thread Integration**
**Three-Front War Scenario:**
- Archon returns investigating someone close to Cordelia
- Vegas investigator asking about Victor Marchetti
- Nosferatu protégé infiltrating Elysium
- Perfect storm for Cordelia's vulnerabilities

## 🎭 Story Development Notes

### Cordelia's Methodology
- **Destroyed Buyers:** Not just defeated, but socially annihilated his political machine
- **Learned Dominate:** From Toreador she later allowed to die in desert
- **Archon Debt:** Saved Gangrel who's now more powerful than her
- **65-Year Game:** Buyers has been patient, building comprehensive intelligence

### The Perfect Antagonist
**Darrell Buyers** represents everything Cordelia fears:
- Patient (65 years vs. her impatience)
- Indirect (information warfare vs. her direct social manipulation)
- Comprehensive (complete dossier vs. her selective memory)
- Teaching moment (protégé vs. her isolated position)

### PC Integration Points
- **Nosferatu PC:** Natural infiltration, clan politics, moral ambiguity
- **Other PCs:** Caught between Archon investigation, Vegas questions, Harpy's social games
- **Cordelia's Response:** Turn the protégé, use them as double agent, or destroy them publicly
