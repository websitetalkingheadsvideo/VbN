### **What Was Accomplished:**
- **Successfully migrated Backgrounds System** from onclick-based to event delegation architecture

- **Fixed background initialization** to start at 0 on page load

### **Technical Changes Made:**

#### **Backgrounds System Migration:**
- âœ… **Removed 45 onclick attributes** from background buttons in `lotn_char_create.php`
- âœ… **Updated BackgroundSystem.js** for level-based selection (click level 3 â†’ sets to level 3)
- âœ… **Enhanced visual feedback** - buttons show selected state up to current level
- âœ… **Fixed event delegation** - uses `#backgroundsTab` container
- âœ… **Added proper initialization** - all backgrounds start at 0

#### **Notification System Removal:**
- âœ… **Updated all 8 systems** (Background, Discipline, Ability, Trait, Morality, MeritsFlaws, Cash, HealthWillpower)
- âœ… **Replaced all notifications** with console.log/warn/error/info
- âœ… **Updated main.js** - removed notificationManager dependencies
- âœ… **Simplified confirmations** - using native `confirm()` and `alert()`

### **Key Features:**
- **Level-based selection** - Click level 3 button â†’ sets background to level 3
- **Visual feedback** - Buttons show selected state up to current level
- **Clean console logging** - All user feedback via console instead of popups
