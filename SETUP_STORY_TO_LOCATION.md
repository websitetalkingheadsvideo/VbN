# üöÄ Quick Setup Guide - Story to Location Feature

## Step 1: Add API Key to config.env

Your project already has a `config.env` file! Just edit it and add your API key:

1. Open `config.env` in your project root
2. Find the AI API Keys section (already added)
3. Replace `your_anthropic_api_key_here` with your actual key

**Get an Anthropic API Key:**
1. Visit: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up or log in
3. Go to "API Keys" section
4. Create a new key
5. Copy and paste into `config.env`

**Example:**
```bash
# AI API Keys (for Story to Location feature)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Step 2: Verify Configuration

facility by day. At night, it serves as a secure feeding ground for 
Camarilla vampires. The facility has medical equipment, blood storage 
refrigeration, and security cameras throughout. Access is restricted to 
Camarilla members only, with armed guards protecting the entrance.
```

3. Click "Parse Story with AI"
