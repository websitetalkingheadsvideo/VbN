## 🗑️ Files Deleted

- **some commands I use.txt** - Workflow commands (redundant)
- **status.txt** - Old status tracking (replaced by session-notes/)
- **to do.txt** - Todo list (migrated to taskmaster)

---

## 📋 Taskmaster Updates

### Added Todo:
- **ID: 1** - "Test if new character has the same name as an existing character - implement duplicate name validation" (Status: pending)

This was migrated from the old to do.txt file and is now tracked in the taskmaster system.

   - Items → `Items/`
   
2. **Session tracking files:**
   - Moved to project root for easier access during development

3. **Setup documentation:**
   - Moved to project root alongside other development docs

4. **Core rulebook:**
   - Kept `LOTN - Revised.pdf` in `reference/` root for easy access

---

## 🎯 Next Session Priorities

### Pending Tasks:
1. **Character Name Validation** (Taskmaster ID: 1)
   - Test if new character has same name as existing character
   - Implement duplicate name validation in character creation
   - Add database constraint or API validation

2. **Continue Character System Development**
   - Complete any remaining character creator features
   - Test character import/export functionality
   - Verify all character data persists correctly
