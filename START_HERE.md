## 💡 How It Works

```
Write Narrative → Parse with AI → Review Fields → Save to Database
     3-5 min         10-30 sec        1-2 min         instant

             Total: 5-8 minutes vs 10-15 minutes traditional!

## 💬 Example Narratives to Try

### Simple Haven:
```
Small apartment in Tempe, basic security with locks and 
deadbolts. Has a computer for research and a mini-fridge 
for blood storage. Owned by a Ventrue neonate, restricted 
access with threshold protection.
```

### Detailed Elysium:
```
The Grand Opera House in Central Phoenix serves as primary 
Elysium under Prince's decree. Built in 1920s, the ornate 
building has a main auditorium holding 400, private balconies 
for clan leaders, and underground chambers for meetings. 
Security includes reinforced doors, alarm systems, ghoul guards, 
and Tremere wards. High prestige venue for all major gatherings.
```

### Supernatural Location:
```
The Old Mission Church in Tempe appears abandoned but serves 
as Tremere chantry. Sits on ley line intersection creating 
a 7-point node. Basement has ritual chambers, occult library, 
and hidden reagent caches. Heavily warded against physical and 
astral intrusion. Threshold protects against uninvited entry.
