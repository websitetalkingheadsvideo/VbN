  "biography": "Duke Tiki was a celebrated sculptor and designer of Polynesian-inspired art and décor, capturing the essence of the mid-century Tiki craze. He was a regular at Bali Hai, holding court over rum cocktails and torchlight, sketching murals and carving idols that would adorn the lounges of the jet set. He wasn't Hawaiian or Polynesian himself—more of a mid-century romantic who saw escapism in the imagery of paradise—but he treated his craft as homage rather than kitsch. He believed Tiki culture was about inviting warmth and joy into a cold world.\n\nAmong his regulars was Bob, a man who didn't create but understood art. Bob saw the soul in his carvings and could articulate it better than the artist himself. That drew the Toreador's attention. He saw in Bob not a rival, but a rare admirer who truly 'saw.' After a long friendship, and with the Prince's blessing, he Embraced Bob—a testament to the Toreador belief that beauty and perception are equally divine.",
