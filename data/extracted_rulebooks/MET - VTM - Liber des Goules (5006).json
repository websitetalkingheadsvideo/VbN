It wouldn't have been an annoyance at all had she been\nable to move, but the piece of white pine messily inserted between her\nthird and fourth ribs meant that moving was no longer an option . Of\ncourse, she reflected, the spider was definitely the least of her problems\nat this point .\nOn the other hand, if her current captivity continued much\nlonger, the spider and its arthropod companions might well become a\nconcern. While her dead flesh was still far too tough for the mandibles\nof the spiders and centipedes that swarmed the crawl space she'd been\nunceremoniously stuffed into, she could still feel the tickling of their\nfeet with exquisite precision . Every footfall, every step, every sensation\nwent straight to her too-active mind . It would probably drive her mad\nbefore long .\nThe time the centipede walked across her still-open left eye was\nthe worst . She screamed, or tried to, but she couldn't even move that\nmuch.

He cradled her head in his hands and muttered\nhis half-sensible endearments and apologies . He bathed her face with\na cool wet cloth and told her how much he loved her . Then, when his\nsense of guilt was assuaged, he lowered the boards and sealed her in the\ndark again .\nThe centipedes took all of half a minute to return\n.\nSo here she was, trapped in a six-by-three-by-two hideaway in her\nfavorite ghoul's laundry room . Never mind that she'd given Jace the\nmoney to buy the house (asking only that he make one room light-\nproof, just in case) . Never mind that she had supported him for years\n(it was only right, as the work he did for her precluded his holding a\nnormal job) . Never mind that she'd given him the blood .\nShe should have suspected something long ago, she told herself for\nthe thousandth time. There were so many clues, so many hints, and she\nignored them all . She ignored the danger, as she had for so many years\nwith so many other ghouls . Silently, she resolved to be much more\ncareful the next time around .\nThe next time . That was a laugh. Jace was probably going to keep\nher down here as long as the house stood, feeding her enough thin\nanimal blood to sustain her, but never letting her move again . And\nonce a month he would come to worship at the altar of her bleeding\nwrist and love her all the more for it\n.\nAll the ghouls had loved her, and that had been part of the\nproblem . It was accepted, really; if you had a ghoul, you Bound him,\nand the love inspired in him would be enough to keep him in line .\nCertainly there were the horror stories about ghouls who turned on\ntheir Regnants, but Lanaugha dismissed them as pure fancy, a sort of\nvampiric urban legend . Besides, all of those lurid anecdotes (ending\nwith the poor innocent vampire being staked out for the sun by a\nhorribly vengeful ghoul) had one thing in common . Inevitably, it was\nhorrible mistreatment of the ghouls that made them strike back,\ntortures and abuses that Lanaugha had never so much as considered .\nGhouls were just too valuable to risk damaging that way . No, she had\nalways been extremely kind to her ghouls . Next time she would simply\nhave to be firmer .\nThere was a loud clanking from above the claustrophobic crawl\nspace. Jace was apparently dragging something heavy and metallic\ndown the basement stair; there was a pattern of rhythmic thunks\ninterspersed with curses . Well, there wasn't much that she could do\nfrom here, one way or the other . It wasn't as if she'd picked Jace for his\nbrawn, anyway .\n"

She'd been\ntoo kind to Jace, and in his infatuated state, he decided that she\nactually returned his affection . It was preposterous, of course - he'd\nbeen her ghoul for almost 10 years and the perfect Servitor throughout\nthat time . Every assignment had been completed with style\nand\nefficiency, and she appreciated his work . That was why she bought him\nthe house . The parameters of the relationship were clear and under-\nstood .\nAt least, that was what she thought . Obviously, she'd been wrong .\nBut what was the turning point?\nShe could think of two possibilities . The first occurred nearly three\nyears ago. He'd finished performing some task or other - at this point\nshe could hardly remember what it had been, something to do with a\njudge - and she made the mistake of smiling at him for a little too\nlong, and of calling him her \"dearest Jace .\"\nIt was just a figure of speech, but she felt his eyes on her back the\nrest of that night . Jace had never watched her that way before, not with\nthat predatory intensity . Like an idiot, she attributed it to the Bond\nand thought no more of it, even though he watched her that way more\nand more over the nights that followed .\nShe never called him \"dearest\" again, but it was plain that Jace\nhungered to hear it . She remembered thinking something to herself\nabout not encouraging him, and then of not giving the matter any\nmore thought .\nDamn, the mistakes were mounting . She would have smiled, were\nshe able to.\nThen the floorboards were pulled away, and her eyes were flooded\nwith harsh fluorescent light .\nJace was there, of course, his face a mask of tender concern . In his\nleft hand was what could only be a carafe full of blood . In his right was,\nincongruously, a turkey baster . \"And how is my beautiful Lanaugha\nthis evening?\" he cooed, dropping oh so slowly to his knees so as to not\nspill the blood, and planted a soft kiss on her forehead . \"I have some\ngood news and some bad news . Which do you want to hear first?\"\nExpertly, he dipped the baster into the blood and drew forth a\ngenerous helping, and then slid the nozzle between Lanaugha's lips . He\npressed gently on the bulb, making the precious vitae trickle into her\nsystem. With a shock, she realized that the blood Jace was feeding her\nwas human . While she didn't mind the extra strength it gave her, not\nto mention the much more satisfying taste, in three\nmonths of\ncaptivity Jace had never, ever fed her human blood . Why now?\n"

You could at least say thank\nyou .\" He filled the baster and inserted it again . \"Ah, well, I'm sure you\nwould thank me if you could .\" Much too slowly, the blood leaked\ndown, spreading its delicious warmth . Eventually, the nozzle emptied\nand Jace paused to refill it .\n\"There is bad news, you know . Your friend Drake has been asking\nquestions about your whereabouts. He seems to think I had something\nto do with it, and has even insinuated that I've hurt you somehow .\nThat shows you how silly Drake is . You know I'd never do anything to\nhurt you.\"\nYou put a goddamned stake in my heart and locked me in a box with the\ntermites for three months, you bastard! she wanted to scream, but her lips\nwould not so much as twitch . Instead, the baster, full of warm sweet\nblood, was placed between her teeth again . To be fed thus, like a baby,\nwas humiliating . If she ever got free, Jace was going to pay .\nEventually, inevitably, the blood ran out . Jace planted a single kiss\non her cold lips, then stood . Oddly enough, he didn't replace the\nfloorboards. \"I've got a little something to take care of, love, then I'll\nbe right back. Don't go anywhere .\" Then he was gone, out of her field\nof vision, and she could hear his footfalls ascending the basement\nstairs. Off in the corner of the room, she could see some sort of tank .\nThat must have been what Jace lugged down, but for the life of her\nLanaugha couldn't figure out what it might be for .\nStill, lace was gone, and that gave her time to return to her original\ntrain of thought. The other thing that might have triggered Jace\noccurred when she took Paul on as a ghoul . Paul was a lawyer, and a\nrather handsome one at that . She met him at a party on a Saturday and\nBound him to her by the following Wednesday .\nAlone among her ghouls, Jace did not seemed thrilled with the\naddition. At the time, he had been the newest, and it was always\nnatural for the \"youngest\" to resent a new arrival . Jace had been\nresented by Carpenter, the ghoul she'd taken just before . Then again,\nCarpenter's dislike faded with the years, while ]ace's crystallized into\nan icy hatred .\nCome to think of it, it was after Paul's addition to her staff that the\naccidents started to happen . Carpenter was killed by a hit-and-run\ndriver ; Jace delivered the news as quickly as he could, but she got there\njust a little too late. Six months later, Paul was executed by the prince\nfor a breach of the Masquerade . His Majesty the Most Asinine Prince\nVincent didn't mention where he got the evidence that Paul had shot\n"

Often\ndismissed and taken for granted, ghouls are the bridge between the worlds of\nKindred and kine . Without the help of their Blood Bound retainers, vampires\nwould be prisoners to the rising and setting of the sun, and mostly helpless to\naffect the sunlit world .\nIt is no overestimation to state that the Camarilla's strides to preserve the\nMasquerade would falter or perhaps even fail altogether without ghouls . Nor\nwould it be unfair to say that the Sabbat relies heavily on ghouls; the existence\nof the Revenant families underscores the usefulness of these half-humans to\nthe antitribu (or at least to Clan Tzimisce) . Even lowly Anarchs need ghouls\nfor their very survival . Who else could be trusted to haul a vampire on the run\nout of town under the noon sun, even as the prince's lackeys sweep the streets\nfor her?\nThen again, the creation of ghouls exacts a price from Kindred as well\n.\nGhouls may be bound to their Regnants by love, but love can lead to jealousy\nand hate . Hell hath no fury like a ghoul scorned, and when a ghoul knows all\nof the secrets of the one who spurned him, the results can be explosive\n.\nThis book outlines and describes what is expected of a ghoul in a live-\naction setting, and details what a player should expect from the World of\nDarkness.

In essence, it is a game of make-\nbelieve, only one set in a very specific place and time . Mind's Eye Theatre\nsimply provides rules for resolving arguments on what any given player can\nor cannot do within the bounds of the game . After all, a tussle over who is\nright and who is wrong should be the last thing on any roleplayer's agenda ;\nthe play's the thing, not the rules .

The rules of the game are here to\nstreamline the action, not disrupt it .\nThe foremost priority in Mind's Eye Theatre is telling a story . Preferably,\nthe story will not be too convoluted, simple or violent . There is a time and\nplace for all of these things in the World of Darkness, but in measured doses .\nThe best-laid plans often become diverted by the active imaginations of\ncreative roleplayers.\nIt is therefore the responsibility of the Storyteller to provide a story that\ncan be enjoyed by all her players, not just a few .

It is the Storyteller's responsibility to not abuse this power, and the\nplayers' responsibility to respect it.

This powerful elixir carries the curse\nof Caine's damnation, and infects, to a degree, every creature that consumes\nit. Most notable among these are human beings, but the effect is not limited\nto them alone . Animals of all kinds can become ghouls .\nIn Mind's Eye Theatre, the ghoul's part has commonly been passed off\nto inexperienced players so they can learn the game by watching their\nRegnants go through the motions (and by staying out of the way of important\nplots) . Unfortunately, this has led to the prevailing notion of the expendable\nghoul . This is an unacceptable state of affairs, and is not true to the World of\nDarkness. Ghouls are neither peripheral to the world of the Kindred, nor are\nthey disposable .\nGhouls fulfill several important roles, all of which are fertile ground for\nMind's Eye Theatre plots. By playing the roles of servants, ghouls are privy\nto all sorts of dirty little secrets . They make excellent bodyguards with their\ncommand of physical Disciplines ; vampires who scoff at the abilities of\n\"lowly\" ghouls tempt fate more than they know . Ghouls also serve as envoys\nto and guardians against the mortal world . This is one of their most important\nroles, as it is they who tend to their Regnants' daytime business . An efficient\nghoul in this position can make her Regnant's unlife much easier; an\nincompetent one can lead hunters right to the haven door .\n"

Jealousy and resentment can even\nlead a ghoul to question her Bond, eventually causing a true break from her\nRegnant .

It fleshes out a vital part of the World of Darkness that, until now, has\nbeen largely taken for granted . Ghouls are truly the backbone of Kindred\nsociety, enabling vampires to extend their influence to the sunlit hours . This\nmakes ghouls quite necessary for vampires who have political interests -\ncourts of law, businesses and elections are all daytime operations - and for\nthose who have nothing but mischief on their minds . If a vampire wants to\naffect something - anything- in the mortal world while the sun is high, he\nprobably has to use a ghoul to do it . Considering the sheer variety of ways in\nwhich a vampire is likely to want to interact with the world during daytime\nhours, that leaves an awful lot for ghouls to do .\nGhouls are perfect characters for new players who know little about\nMind's Eye Theatre but who would like to play immediately . The opportu-\nnity to learn while playing is invaluable, and the very nature of \"new ghoul\"\nroles explains any \"out-of-character\" awkwardness or ignorance .\nOn the other hand, experienced Mind's Eye Theatre players will find\nghouls to have a capacity for multilevel play, as they can interact with more\ndenizens of the World of Darkness than just vampires . After all, who's to say\nthat a changeling, werewolf or wraith can't cut a deal, and what of the\nambitious Tremere ghoul who's selling his Regnant's vitae to a local mage?\nNor should players be the only ones having fun with ghouls . Storytellers\ncan use ghouls as antagonists or to perpetuate storylines or puncture vampiric\narrogance and to continue game action during daylight hours\n.\nThis book will show that ghouls are much more than slaves or conve-\nnient juice bags . It gives easy-to-follow rules and suggestions on how to create\nand play ghouls. Remember, though, the most important thing is the story!\nThe only real instructions to be paid special heed to are the ones that you\ncome up with . So Storytellers, feel free to disregard that which you disagree\nwith and go wild with what you like . The only limitations to a story are the\nones you set .\nThe Only Rules That Matter\nThese are the most important rules of MET, the only ones that absolutely\nmust be obeyed. Obviously, there are a lot of people out there who either don't\nknow or don't care that it's just a game . On the other hand, there are some\npeople who take the game far too seriously .

Any background information in\nFatal Addiction supersedes the material in this chapter at the\nStoryteller's discretion .\nThe Servitors\nMainly thought of as classic \"Renfield\" ghouls, Servitors have been\ngrossly misrepresented over the years . In some ways, this is to their advantage ;\nvampires automatically expect absolute devotion from them . The majority of\nServitor ghouls possess Architect, Sycophant and Visionary Natures, but\nothers are possible .\nMost Servitors spend their lives serving their Regnants through a broad\narray of duties. They are protectors, confidants, stewards and, perhaps most\nimportantly, ambassadors to the mortal world. The vast majority like where\nthey are and what they do . They have nothing but contempt for the ruck and\nrun of mortals, viewing themselves as a step above those who don't have\nKindred vitae on their lips. Vampire strategies for dealing with the mortal\nworld are often modified or even composed by willing Servitors, who are more\nin touch with the living than are their masters . Politicians, judges, advertising\nexecutives, lawyers and real-estate agents make excellent Servitors . A great\nmany Servitors are convinced that they are on the fast track to true\nimmortality, but even those who are content to remain ghouls actively enjoy\nthe perks that their supernatural existence's offer . For most Servitors, power\ncomes at fair price, and they'd gladly pay it again\n.\nOn the other hand, some Servitors actively work toward the day when\nthey can turn their formidable knowledge against their masters . This ingrati-\ntude is usually born not of hatred, but of sheer boredom . As the decades grind\non, quasi-immortality does not always wear well on a living creature . Ennui\nwages a harsh war against these ghouls, and they are at times ill-prepared for\nbattle . For some Servitors, this rebellious streak survives even under the\ncompact of the Blood Bond, becoming a subconscious rejection of slavery .\nDisgruntled Servitors do not always mean their Regnants harm, but many do .\nOthers set events in motion against their Regnants just so they can swoop in\nand \"save\" their beloved masters, hopefully garnering affection and attention\nfrom the suitably grateful vampires .\n"

When\nselecting their ghouls, most vampires rarely consider whether or not their\nservants are going to get along . They simply look for mortals who can get the\njob done . This policy often backfires, though ; ghouls can spend more time\nsquabbling than accomplishing their tasks . Such competition can even turn\ndeadly; ghouls can mount their own Jyhads or he destroyed by Regnants who\ngrow tired of all the bickering .\nIn their favor, Servitors can draw on their Regnants' ample resources\n.\nFurthermore, when they can agree with one another, ghouls belonging to a\nsingle vampire don't usually mind sharing their personal influences, so long\nas the privilege isn't abused .

Ask any\nvampire-killer and he will swear up and down that he regards his addiction\nto blood as a necessary evil, and that if he could be free of it, he would . Of\ncourse, most of these Hunters have stashed away huge stocks of Blood Traits\nto support both their hunts and their habits . There are even rumors of elder\nghouls, their lifespans prolonged by centuries, who pick off young Hunters to\nreduce competition for the precious vitae .\n∎\nHunters and Vampires\nMany vampires who wish to dispose of rivals without\ntempting the consequences of diablerie turn to Hunter ghouls\nto do their dirty work . Few of these vampires actively work with\ntheir unsuspecting hatchetmen . Instead, such vampiric quis-\nlings drop hints or have their Servitors leave clues for the\nhapless Hunters to follow to rivals' havens .

With another\nplayer as a Regnant, you automatically have someone to roleplay with, and\na means to introduce your character to the plots already in progress .

Is she in love with him? Is she jealous of his\nother ghouls? Defining the Regnant-Thrall relationship early on is vital\n.\nYou also need to figure out what you do for your Regnant, and why he\nkeeps you around .

A complete listing of\nNatures and Demeanors can be found in The Masquerade : Second Edition\n(p. 19), but you don't have to limit yourself o the ones in print .

When you see a\nweight lifter on television, the adjectives that you might use to describe him\nwould be Traits used in Mind's Eye Theatre roleplaying .

In Mind's Eye Theatre, all of these things\nbecome Traits that your character possesses .\nFrom the list of Attributes in Laws of the Night, decide which ones best\ndescribe your character . Attributes fall into three categories : Physical, Men-\ntal and Social . You need to pick one of these three as your Primary and assign\nseven Traits o it. The one next in importance is Secondary ; give this category\nfive Traits. The remaining one is Tertiary, which receives three Traits\n.\nLet your character inspiration determine your Attributes .

Derangements triggered by Chimerstry or Obtenebration are affected by\nthis use of Humanity, while Presence-spawned terrors are not\n.\nThis sort of expenditure of Humanity Traits should he played out .\nWhether a character confides in a trusted friend about his constant battle to\nwork through a Derangement, prays vociferously for strength, or displays the\nSt. Christopher medal that his mother gave him on her deathbed, there\nshould he some in-game action to demonstrate the expenditure of this very\nimportant Trait .\n• Threats to Life and Limb - Humanity Traits can also be used when\na character's \"fight or flight\" instinct is triggered .

This only works in life-threatening situations .\n• True Love - Assuming a ghoul has a True Love (Storytellers should\nknow about this sort of thing in advance ; making up the light of your life on\nthe spot tends to stretch credulity a hit), a Humanity Trait can be used as it\nis for Threats to Life and Limb if the loved one is in mortal danger .\nSimilarly, a Humanity Trait can be used in place of a regular Trait during\na character's initial bid if his loved one is at risk during the challenge . This\nis quite useful, particularly if the character no longer has an appropriate Trait\nto hid but is compelled to act anyway. A Humanity Trait used in this way is\nlost, regardless of the outcome of the challenge .\nLosing Humanity\nIf a ghoul enters a frenzy and harms or kills someone, a check must be\nmade to see if the character loses a Humanity Trait . (If no one is hurt, the\nghoul suffers no long-term scars from the frenzy .) If someone is indeed injured\nas a result of a ghoul's frenzy, the ghoul must win a Static Social Challenge\nagainst four Traits. If the ghoul wins the challenge, he is unaffected by his\nexperience and maintains all Humanity . If the ghoul loses, he acquires a\nDerangement (to be determined by the Storyteller) . He also loses a Humanity\nTrait, though not permanently .\nIn the event that the ghoul kills someone during frenzy, accidentally or\notherwise, an immediate challenge must he made against a Storyteller or\nNarrator. This takes the form of two Static Challenges, for which the ghoul\nmust bid a Humanity Trait . Loss of one challenge or a tie in both temporarily\n4 7\n"

So long as overzealous vampire characters don't regard all\nmortals as potential blood donors, ghoul characters will get the chance to do\nwhat they need to . In addition, ghouls have a few tricks of their own, and even\na new ghoul may not be as overmatched by a vampire as one might think\n.\nThere are several things to keep in mind when playing a ghoul. A ghoul\nis a complex creature, inhuman enough to want to forget her past but human\nenough to fear for her future . Within each ghoul, Humanity and Beast engage\nin an endless struggle . The paradox is: The ghoul continues to exist only as\nlong as the struggle within continues . Should Humanity triumph, existence\nas a blood drinker becomes unthinkable . Should the Beast win, little is left of\nthe ghoul's original personality .\nEvery afternoon or evening, a ghoul wakes up knowing that she is\nexcluded from both the mortal and immortal worlds . The only sanctuary she\ncan find is with other ghouls, and even that comfort can he hollow . Still, the\nempathy of peers is the only refuge that ghouls can find . Understanding each\nother's suffering creates strong bonds between most ghouls, and they tend to\nlook out for one another, especially those outside their own households\n.\nCompetition for the Regnant's attention can arise within a household, over\nduties, and as a result of sheer proximity to people with whom you have little\nin common but your blood .\nWhile ghouls are less powerful than their masters, sunlight is the great\nequalizer. A ghoul can almost forget the cold, undead hand that clutches at\nher heart when the sun warms her skin . But as the sun sets, her double life\nresumes . Of course, the vampire won't forget his ghoul's ability to walk the\nsunlit streets, and will certainly prepare a duty list .\nWhether their Regnants are cruel or kind, all ghouls are enthralled to\nthem to some degree . A vampire can symbolize everything a ghoul despised\nin life, yet she would still do nearly anything her Regnant wanted . How does\nit feel for a character to love everything she once hated? How would it feel for\nthe most independent of individuals to need someone so desperately? This\nperverted devotion is unnatural, and most ghouls recognize that . However,\nalmost all ghouls are helpless to act in the face of the Bond that ties (and gags)\nthem .\nMaking the Decision\nA player needs to he prepared to explore the uncharted emotional\ntragedy of the Blood Bond before she decides to play a ghoul . Playing a Bound\ncharacter can demand that a ghoul act contrary to her best interests, out of\nthe narcotic love that the Bond inspires. This love can make a character do\nthings that she doesn't want to, things that she would never normally do, or\nthings that are not necessarily in keeping with her long-term plans . To play\na ghoul is to play a character with less than total free will, and players should\nthink long and hard before accepting ghoulish restrictions\n.\n"

They can never let others, not even\nfamily or friends, know what is going on in their lives, though. Some break\noff relationships to avoid the pain or to spare loved ones the horror of\ndiscovery. The danger of a loved one witnessing a frenzy, the fear of a Regnant\nexecuting a friend as a \"lesson\" - these are the nightmares that haunt ghouls .\nThus the majority of ghouls slowly but surely step away from their intimate\nhuman relationships . Ultimately, ghouls are more alone in a crowd than they\nare on their own .\nOn the other hand, the benefits intrinsic to being a ghoul can make such\nhell worthwhile. Many an Olympic medalist in the World of Darkness has\ningested vampiric blood ; it is the ultimate performance enhancer, and it can't\nhe spotted in a drug test. Some vampires sponsor athletes, pitting them\nagainst the pawns of Kindred rivals in secret contests of one-upmanship\n.\nSports stars, aspiring actors, musicians, politicians, lawyers and computer\nprogrammers have all benefited from the power of a Regnant.\nSome ghouls even enjoy vampire politics, despite their status as super-\nnatural second-class citizens . They find it easy to manipulate their Regnants\nafter living with them so closely for so long . However, it is still a Herculean\neffort to gain any status as a ghoul in vampire society. Some ghouls offset their\nloneliness and rejection with the desire to be Embraced, to enter fully at least\none of the worlds they inhabit . Others would rather die than lose all\nHumanity to the Beast .\nMany vampires Embrace their most outstanding ghouls, as long as this\nchange in status will not interfere with the ghouls' work . Other reasons for\nEmbracing ghouls include rewarding servants for exceptional work, or mov-\ning trusted retainers into positions of more authority . Ghouls who are\nEmbraced are often given more choice in the matter than are other potential\nchilder. The transition from human to vampire is also less painful for a ghoul\nwho has already seen vampire society at work .\nEmbraced ghouls retain the Disciplines they possessed as half-humans,\nbut now their new clan Disciplines come to them more easily than they might\nhave . Meanwhile, Disciplines not related to their new clans become as hard\nto gain as any out-of-clan powers .\nThe First Change\nThe change from mortal to ghoul is important to roleplay . The way the\nRegnant introduces her intended ghoul to the World of Darkness is crucial\n.\nSome vampires take a backhanded approach, tricking their intended Thralls\ninto drinking the blood in a variety of ways . As soon as a victim of this sort\nof deception is Blood Bound and his new abilities manifest, the Regnant\nreveals what is really going on . These crucial tidbits are often dropped at a\n"

These can\nbe simple behavioral alterations, the products of learning from experience, or\nchanges can be as grandiose as the manifestations of new Disciplines\n.\nSubtle changes occur, too ; usually alterations of an emotional or mental\nsort. Betrayal is a good example. If a character is betrayed in the course of a\ngame, she is probably more careful about whom she trusts in the future. Other\ncharacters may not understand this sudden change of heart (they may not\neven know about the betrayal), but the player does and doesn't necessarily\nneed to explain .\nPeople rarely understand what makes others tick, or what their reasons\nfor actions are, and this should be reflected in-game .

There are Regnants out there who\nthink they have nothing better to do than take out theiraggressions\non their Thralls . Some of them even do it for fun!\nSick of it? Sick of her pals kicking you around? Mispronouncing\nyour name? Feeding on you without permission? Well, I'll tell you\nwhat, honey, there are ways of getting back at those jerks. And I'm\ngoing to lay out how. . . .\nBut before I start, don't even think about saying \"But mine's not\nlike that. \" Uh-huh . If she weren't like that, you wouldn't be reading\nthis column, dearie. If you get offended and put this down now,\nyou're not a ghoul -you're a vampire in a warm suit .\nOkay, it goes like this, kiddies: I you think revenge is a dish best\nserved cold, huh-unh - it can be served hot. (Or you can make them\nthink that, but that's my best and easiest one, and I should save it\nfor last.)\nLet me give you a little example I cooked up for my friend\nArmand. His kind, loving, generous Regnant decided to try him out\nas a bulletproof vent. In case you were wondering, it didn't go\nterribly well . He nearly died, with six neat little puncture wounds in\nhim .\nAt any rate, my friend the pincushion hired me to get back at his\nRegnant, and this is the trifle I came up with to make her regret\ntreating him that way . I call it Machka'a Little Ditty . Don't ask about\n"

First, you need a sponge and a\nbit of paraffin wax. Water down the sponge, then squeeze it tight .\nYou probably have Potence, so go to town. While the sponge is as\nscrunched up as you can make it, dip it into the wax and then freeze\nthe little blob .\nThen things get tricky . To use the Little Ditty, you need to get into\nyour target's haven. This is no problem if you're doing it for one of\nthe resident ghouls or for yourself, but if you're poaching a Regnant,\nwatch out. Hopefully you know where your target's sleeping and\nwhat defenses she employs . If her ghouls are on your side, they\nwon't be a problem.\nOn the way over to the mark, make sure you pick the wax off the\nsponge . Keep the bundle of joy in your hand so that it warms up a\nbit. When the time comes, you'll need it moderately well thawed\n.\nOkay, now for the really dangerous part . You have a 5o-5o\nchance of getting caught at thin point, so be ready to run with\nCelerity at pull tilt. As carefully as you can, togs the sponge down\nyour target's gullet. If you can get it past the little dangly things at\nthe back of her throat, you're in business .\nNow comes the most important part - run. If you aren't fast,\nyou're going to die. Hopefully you planned an escape route, prefer-\nably one that leads past bright, sunny windows. If the bloodsucker\nis in a high-rise, head for a corner stairwell and slide down the\nbanister.\nWhat is the result of this endeavor, besides leaving untidy wax\ndroppings for anyone with Psychometry to discover? What can you\npossibly hope to accomplish? It's really sweet. The sponge thaw's in\nthe vampire's throat, where it expands and is irretrievable . In and\nof itself, that's just annoying. The funny part comes in when she\ntries to feed . Blood gets soaked up by the sponge so it can't nourish\nher, yet she can taste it back there . It's so tantalizing it hurts .\nOnce the blood congeals, thin go get really bothersome . What\nwith this hard scratchy thing in her throat, your Regnant is going to\nbreak down or get help and rip it out the hard way .\nEver seen a vampire tear out her own throat? It's a treat .\n"

This is due in equal parts to their unquestioning loyalty and their\ninability to complain. While animals do have certain drawbacks (it's hard to\nget one to change a zoning ordinance), they are unsurpassed in their skills as\nsentries, spies and personal guards . However, animals aren't as intelligent as\nhumans ; players should not choose animal ghouls as characters .\nAnimal ghouls can be used for protection in a haven, and as agents for\ngathering intelligence. However, keep in mind that ghouled animals can be\neasy to recognize . Most vampires will become suspicious of oddly curious\nanimals that hang around too much . With that in mind, be prepared to lose\nan animal that your character brings to an evening's event\n.\nLogistics\nTo simulate an animal ghoul at your side, make up a card that lists the\nanimal's Traits and wear the card prominently when the creature is with you\n.\nStuffed animals can be used to represent small ghouls (although a teddy bear\nmay cause you to be mistaken for a Malkavian) . Even these should have stars\npinned to them to indicate their status as ghouls, not toys .\nIf you send your ghoul on a mission, inform a Narrator of the action and\nhand her your ghoul's card . She can assess the difficulty of the task, decide\nwhat tests your ghoul has to pass, and determine what tests others have to\nmake to impede your ghoul's progress . The card should he returned to you\nwhen the mission is completed, unless the ghoul doesn't come back .\nFor example, Bertram sends his ghouled pigeon off to spy on his rival,\nErnest, So Bertram's player talks to a Narrator . He explains what he wants the\npigeon to do, then hands the Narrator the ghoul's card . The Narrator finds\nErnest's player and asks him to make a Static Mental Challenge . He succeeds,\nso the Narrator rules that Ernest notices the pigeon . Ernest knows the pigeon\nis Bertram's, but isn't worried about it and does nothing . The next time the\nNarrator sees Bertram's player, he returns the card and provides rudimentary\ninformation on what the pigeon saw .\nNarrators shouldn't drop everything to run ghoul missions - animals\naren't likely to take the shortest route between two points, and may not do\nthings in a hurry .\n104\n1\n"

This Trait relates to\nthe animal's natural tendency to rebel against orders given to it . A wild\nanimal has a base Instincts Trait of 8, while a domesticated animal has an\nInstincts Trait of 5 .

It wouldn't have been an annoyance at all had she been\nable to move, but the piece of white pine messily inserted between her\nthird and fourth ribs meant that moving was no longer an option . Of\ncourse, she reflected, the spider was definitely the least of her problems\nat this point .\nOn the other hand, if her current captivity continued much\nlonger, the spider and its arthropod companions might well become a\nconcern. While her dead flesh was still far too tough for the mandibles\nof the spiders and centipedes that swarmed the crawl space she'd been\nunceremoniously stuffed into, she could still feel the tickling of their\nfeet with exquisite precision . Every footfall, every step, every sensation\nwent straight to her too-active mind . It would probably drive her mad\nbefore long .\nThe time the centipede walked across her still-open left eye was\nthe worst . She screamed, or tried to, but she couldn't even move that\nmuch. As hard as she tried, no words would come . No sound would\ncome. And so Lanaugha was trapped in silent frenzy for those nine\nhours, unresponsive muscles straining against invisible bonds\nthat\nwouldn't permit her so much as a whimper . It had been nine hours of\n\n\nI[\ni\ni\n1 iber (us Goules\ni\ni\ni\ni\nhell, made worse by the fact that when Jace came home, he immedi-\nately checked on her . He cradled her head in his hands and muttered\nhis half-sensible endearments and apologies . He bathed her face with\na cool wet cloth and told her how much he loved her . Then, when his\nsense of guilt was assuaged, he lowered the boards and sealed her in the\ndark again .\nThe centipedes took all of half a minute to return\n.\nSo here she was, trapped in a six-by-three-by-two hideaway in her\nfavorite ghoul's laundry room . Never mind that she'd given Jace the\nmoney to buy the house (asking only that he make one room light-\nproof, just in case) . Never mind that she had supported him for years\n(it was only right, as the work he did for her precluded his holding a\nnormal job) . Never mind that she'd given him the blood .\nShe should have suspected something long ago, she told herself for\nthe thousandth time. There were so many clues, so many hints, and she\nignored them all . She ignored the danger, as she had for so many years\nwith so many other ghouls . Silently, she resolved to be much more\ncareful the next time around .\nThe next time . That was a laugh. Jace was probably going to keep\nher down here as long as the house stood, feeding her enough thin\nanimal blood to sustain her, but never letting her move again . And\nonce a month he would come to worship at the altar of her bleeding\nwrist and love her all the more for it\n.\nAll the ghouls had loved her, and that had been part of the\nproblem . It was accepted, really; if you had a ghoul, you Bound him,\nand the love inspired in him would be enough to keep him in line .\nCertainly there were the horror stories about ghouls who turned on\ntheir Regnants, but Lanaugha dismissed them as pure fancy, a sort of\nvampiric urban legend . Besides, all of those lurid anecdotes (ending\nwith the poor innocent vampire being staked out for the sun by a\nhorribly vengeful ghoul) had one thing in common . Inevitably, it was\nhorrible mistreatment of the ghouls that made them strike back,\ntortures and abuses that Lanaugha had never so much as considered .\nGhouls were just too valuable to risk damaging that way . No, she had\nalways been extremely kind to her ghouls . Next time she would simply\nhave to be firmer .\nThere was a loud clanking from above the claustrophobic crawl\nspace. Jace was apparently dragging something heavy and metallic\ndown the basement stair; there was a pattern of rhythmic thunks\ninterspersed with curses . Well, there wasn't much that she could do\nfrom here, one way or the other . It wasn't as if she'd picked Jace for his\nbrawn, anyway .\n\n\nI\nI\ni\n1\ni\nA Cautionary Tale\nIt was her kindness that led to this, Lanaugha decided . She'd been\ntoo kind to Jace, and in his infatuated state, he decided that she\nactually returned his affection . It was preposterous, of course - he'd\nbeen her ghoul for almost 10 years and the perfect Servitor throughout\nthat time . Every assignment had been completed with style\nand\nefficiency, and she appreciated his work . That was why she bought him\nthe house . The parameters of the relationship were clear and under-\nstood .\nAt least, that was what she thought . Obviously, she'd been wrong .\nBut what was the turning point?\nShe could think of two possibilities . The first occurred nearly three\nyears ago. He'd finished performing some task or other - at this point\nshe could hardly remember what it had been, something to do with a\njudge - and she made the mistake of smiling at him for a little too\nlong, and of calling him her \"dearest Jace .\"\nIt was just a figure of speech, but she felt his eyes on her back the\nrest of that night . Jace had never watched her that way before, not with\nthat predatory intensity . Like an idiot, she attributed it to the Bond\nand thought no more of it, even though he watched her that way more\nand more over the nights that followed .\nShe never called him \"dearest\" again, but it was plain that Jace\nhungered to hear it . She remembered thinking something to herself\nabout not encouraging him, and then of not giving the matter any\nmore thought .\nDamn, the mistakes were mounting . She would have smiled, were\nshe able to.\nThen the floorboards were pulled away, and her eyes were flooded\nwith harsh fluorescent light .\nJace was there, of course, his face a mask of tender concern . In his\nleft hand was what could only be a carafe full of blood . In his right was,\nincongruously, a turkey baster . \"And how is my beautiful Lanaugha\nthis evening?\" he cooed, dropping oh so slowly to his knees so as to not\nspill the blood, and planted a soft kiss on her forehead . \"I have some\ngood news and some bad news . Which do you want to hear first?\"\nExpertly, he dipped the baster into the blood and drew forth a\ngenerous helping, and then slid the nozzle between Lanaugha's lips . He\npressed gently on the bulb, making the precious vitae trickle into her\nsystem. With a shock, she realized that the blood Jace was feeding her\nwas human . While she didn't mind the extra strength it gave her, not\nto mention the much more satisfying taste, in three\nmonths of\ncaptivity Jace had never, ever fed her human blood . Why now?\n\n\n+f\ni\ni\ni fiber t es Goules\ni\ni\ni\ni\n\"Well, I see you've discovered the good news . Yes, this is from a\nhuman. You've been such a good girl, I thought you deserved a treat .\nDon't worry, I checked to make sure there were no nasty drugs or\ndiseases . It took me a while, you know. You could at least say thank\nyou .\" He filled the baster and inserted it again . \"Ah, well, I'm sure you\nwould thank me if you could .\" Much too slowly, the blood leaked\ndown, spreading its delicious warmth . Eventually, the nozzle emptied\nand Jace paused to refill it .\n\"There is bad news, you know . Your friend Drake has been asking\nquestions about your whereabouts. He seems to think I had something\nto do with it, and has even insinuated that I've hurt you somehow .\nThat shows you how silly Drake is . You know I'd never do anything to\nhurt you.\"\nYou put a goddamned stake in my heart and locked me in a box with the\ntermites for three months, you bastard! she wanted to scream, but her lips\nwould not so much as twitch . Instead, the baster, full of warm sweet\nblood, was placed between her teeth again . To be fed thus, like a baby,\nwas humiliating . If she ever got free, Jace was going to pay .\nEventually, inevitably, the blood ran out . Jace planted a single kiss\non her cold lips, then stood . Oddly enough, he didn't replace the\nfloorboards. \"I've got a little something to take care of, love, then I'll\nbe right back. Don't go anywhere .\" Then he was gone, out of her field\nof vision, and she could hear his footfalls ascending the basement\nstairs. Off in the corner of the room, she could see some sort of tank .\nThat must have been what Jace lugged down, but for the life of her\nLanaugha couldn't figure out what it might be for .\nStill, lace was gone, and that gave her time to return to her original\ntrain of thought. The other thing that might have triggered Jace\noccurred when she took Paul on as a ghoul . Paul was a lawyer, and a\nrather handsome one at that . She met him at a party on a Saturday and\nBound him to her by the following Wednesday .\nAlone among her ghouls, Jace did not seemed thrilled with the\naddition. At the time, he had been the newest, and it was always\nnatural for the \"youngest\" to resent a new arrival . Jace had been\nresented by Carpenter, the ghoul she'd taken just before . Then again,\nCarpenter's dislike faded with the years, while ]ace's crystallized into\nan icy hatred .\nCome to think of it, it was after Paul's addition to her staff that the\naccidents started to happen . Carpenter was killed by a hit-and-run\ndriver ; Jace delivered the news as quickly as he could, but she got there\njust a little too late. Six months later, Paul was executed by the prince\nfor a breach of the Masquerade . His Majesty the Most Asinine Prince\nVincent didn't mention where he got the evidence that Paul had shot\n\n\n i \nI I I I I I\nN\ni I\ni\ni I\nA Cautionary Tale\nI\nhis mouth off, but it was effectively damning . And every time another\nghoul disappeared, Jace convinced her not to create a replacement,\nthat he could do the work of all .\nHe instead made her more reliant on him, she now saw . By the\ntime Jace staked her, he was her only ghoul . Apparently that wasn't\nenough, though . He was still afraid that she might take another. That\nhe might have competition . That it wouldn't be just the two of them\nforever .\nThere was the sound of an argument upstairs, then the slamming\nof a door. She heard Jace's feet on the stairs again, and more cursing .\nShe could vaguely see him come into the room and start fiddling with\nthe metal tank he'd hauled down earlier . There was a low hiss, and\nLanaugha was suddenly afraid\n.\nWhen should she have known? When Jace said that he'd created\nthe safest hiding place imaginable for her, and begged her to come look\nat it? When the last of her other ghouls disappeared? When Drake\nwarned her about things that Jace had said to his ghouls? She'd been\na fool .\nJace was back . He looked worried . There was something small and\nsilvery in his left hand . \"I'm sorry I had to go, love,\" he apologized .\nDistantly, she could hear someone pounding on the front door . \"That\nwas Drake again. He claims to know what happened to you . I told him\nhe was deluded, of course .\"\nA crash came from upstairs . It sounded like someone had torn the\nfront door off its hinges . She heard the muffled sound of Drake's voice,\nand a spark of hope flared within her. Jace didn't seem concerned,\nthough. He didn't even turn his head .\n\"Anyway, I knew he'd be coming back . I knew he'd probably even\nfind you. I couldn't allow him to take you away from me, love .\"\nSomewhere, Drake was shouting something about gas . Jace opened his\nleft hand to reveal a lighter .\n\"So when I got the human blood for you, beloved, it was a present .\nA going-away present, really . I wanted to have a `happily ever after,'\nbut I guess this is going to have to do .\"\nShe could hear Drake's feet on the stairs . She saw Jace flip the cap\noff the lighter . Drake! Get the hell out of here! she wanted to scream, but\neven now she was denied that much .\nJace leaned forward to kiss her. \"Goodbye, my love,\" he said, as\ntears ran from the corners of his eyes . \"I wish we could have had\nlonger.\"\nMe too, damn you, she thought . Me too .\nEven as Drake turned the corner at the bottom of the cellar stairs\nand lunged, she could hear the rasp of flint striking a fatal spark .\n\n\n \nI I I I I\nI Introduct on\n\"He who bears the brand of Cain shall rule the Earth .\"\n- George Bernard Shaw\nMany people have an active interest in the legend of the vampire, to the\npoint of wishing to become a part of it . The idea of the \"creature of the night,\"\nits myths and legends, is so fascinating that we are captivated by its aura, its\npower and its romance . The vampire legend is incredibly seductive on several\nlevels .\nSo what happens to those who become too enamored of that midnight\nallure, and are seduced by the menacing elements of the World of Darkness?\nIn the Gothic-Punk world, an exceptional few are taken under the vampiric\nwing to become ghouls . Later, some of these half-humans might become\nvampires, but for many the cost of humanity, life, the sun and loved ones is\none they are not ready to pay . Then again, many human beings don't normally\nhave much of a choice in this sort of decision .\nGhouls are creatures who incorporate the best and the worst of both\nworlds. They can stay out in the midday sun, taste immortality and even take\non the supernatural Disciplines of vampires, but they must often pay with\nunnatural love . Everything has a price in a ghoul's world, and often she will\nnot see who is paying it .\n\n\n12\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nTiber\nt es Goules\nVampires build their communities on the backs of their ghouls . Often\ndismissed and taken for granted, ghouls are the bridge between the worlds of\nKindred and kine . Without the help of their Blood Bound retainers, vampires\nwould be prisoners to the rising and setting of the sun, and mostly helpless to\naffect the sunlit world .\nIt is no overestimation to state that the Camarilla's strides to preserve the\nMasquerade would falter or perhaps even fail altogether without ghouls . Nor\nwould it be unfair to say that the Sabbat relies heavily on ghouls; the existence\nof the Revenant families underscores the usefulness of these half-humans to\nthe antitribu (or at least to Clan Tzimisce) . Even lowly Anarchs need ghouls\nfor their very survival . Who else could be trusted to haul a vampire on the run\nout of town under the noon sun, even as the prince's lackeys sweep the streets\nfor her?\nThen again, the creation of ghouls exacts a price from Kindred as well\n.\nGhouls may be bound to their Regnants by love, but love can lead to jealousy\nand hate . Hell hath no fury like a ghoul scorned, and when a ghoul knows all\nof the secrets of the one who spurned him, the results can be explosive\n.\nThis book outlines and describes what is expected of a ghoul in a live-\naction setting, and details what a player should expect from the World of\nDarkness. Within these pages are rules, roleplaying hooks and ideas for\nnewcomers to and long-time players of The Masquerade . Additionally,\nStorytellers will find story ideas and clarified rules to use and abuse as they see\nfit .\nMind's Eye Theatre\nMind's Eye Theatre started years ago, in somebody's backyard, in the\npark, and during recess on the playground . In essence, it is a game of make-\nbelieve, only one set in a very specific place and time . Mind's Eye Theatre\nsimply provides rules for resolving arguments on what any given player can\nor cannot do within the bounds of the game . After all, a tussle over who is\nright and who is wrong should be the last thing on any roleplayer's agenda ;\nthe play's the thing, not the rules . Players who drop out of character to argue\nover rules interpretations shatter the illusion of the ongoing story, which\ndoesn't help anyone have a good time . The rules of the game are here to\nstreamline the action, not disrupt it .\nThe foremost priority in Mind's Eye Theatre is telling a story . Preferably,\nthe story will not be too convoluted, simple or violent . There is a time and\nplace for all of these things in the World of Darkness, but in measured doses .\nThe best-laid plans often become diverted by the active imaginations of\ncreative roleplayers.\nIt is therefore the responsibility of the Storyteller to provide a story that\ncan be enjoyed by all her players, not just a few . If a few players want a blood\n\n\n{I\ni\ni\nI\n1\nThe Ghouls\nI\n1\nI\nI\nIII tro 11 41,011\nbath, a Storyteller might decide to give it to them, but even mindless violence\nis bound to get boring after a while . Besides, there are consequences for\nrelentless bloodshed : tedious police investigations, archons asking discom-\nforting questions, Blood Hunts, Inner Circle members demanding a cleansing\nof the city, and the Sabbat using the chaos to infiltrate what had been a\nperfectly safe domain .\nIt is good to remember that rules are there to resolve unclear situations\n.\nIf the Storyteller makes a decision regarding a rule, such is her right as final\narbiter . It is the Storyteller's responsibility to not abuse this power, and the\nplayers' responsibility to respect it. Rules in this game are flexible so as to\ncreate a game that is ultimately story driven . If a chronicle is being dictated\nby rules instead of ideas, there are definite problems, and a review of how such\na bind was reached is necessary .\nWe can feel the pulse of time,\nNaked in the wake of lies that suffocate and blind,\nWe may burn but we will shine .\n- My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult, \"13 Above the Night\"\nGhouls are mortals who have ingested the potent blood of vampires,\nthough not always of their own free will . This powerful elixir carries the curse\nof Caine's damnation, and infects, to a degree, every creature that consumes\nit. Most notable among these are human beings, but the effect is not limited\nto them alone . Animals of all kinds can become ghouls .\nIn Mind's Eye Theatre, the ghoul's part has commonly been passed off\nto inexperienced players so they can learn the game by watching their\nRegnants go through the motions (and by staying out of the way of important\nplots) . Unfortunately, this has led to the prevailing notion of the expendable\nghoul . This is an unacceptable state of affairs, and is not true to the World of\nDarkness. Ghouls are neither peripheral to the world of the Kindred, nor are\nthey disposable .\nGhouls fulfill several important roles, all of which are fertile ground for\nMind's Eye Theatre plots. By playing the roles of servants, ghouls are privy\nto all sorts of dirty little secrets . They make excellent bodyguards with their\ncommand of physical Disciplines ; vampires who scoff at the abilities of\n\"lowly\" ghouls tempt fate more than they know . Ghouls also serve as envoys\nto and guardians against the mortal world . This is one of their most important\nroles, as it is they who tend to their Regnants' daytime business . An efficient\nghoul in this position can make her Regnant's unlife much easier; an\nincompetent one can lead hunters right to the haven door .\n\n\nGhouls are always faced with the Blood Bond and the possibility of\nmistreatment through it . This does not mean, however, that they suffer abuse\nlightly. Being Blood Bound does not make a ghoul stupid . Ghouls often cope\nwith the Bond better than do vampires, becoming infatuated with their\nRegnants but not necessarily becoming foolhardy . A ghoul is not going to\nappreciate being ignored, struck or emotionally abused, and will react as a\nspurned lover would to such treatment . Jealousy and resentment can even\nlead a ghoul to question her Bond, eventually causing a true break from her\nRegnant . Considering the knowledge that many ghouls have, this could\nprove a fatal problem for their Regnants\n.\nThere are also ghouls who, when faced with nothing but abuse, strike\nhack and become vampire hunters, bent on the annihilation of their former\nmasters . Like anyone else, if a ghoul is treated well, she works better and more\nwillingly . Indeed, some ghouls work best alone, while others can learn to\nshare their Regnant's attention with others, if doing so is in the Regnant's best\ninterests . But of course, there are some ghouls whose Regnants might be\nbetter off treating them badly, or at least with some caution . Love, especially\nthe false affection of the Blood Bond, can lead to dangerous obsessions\n.\nThe most important thing to remember when playing a ghoul is that,\nwith the exception of the Revenant families of the Sabbat, a ghoul is still very\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\n1\n\n\nif\nIntroduction\nmuch a normal human . The majority of ghouls may still live with loved ones,\nhold day jobs, pay bills, go to college and so on . Apart from their addiction\nto vitae, ghouls function like everybody else .\n∎\nRevenants\nRevenants are very different from other ghouls, having\nbeen ghouls since their conception . The Revenant families\nhave had vampire blood in their veins for generations,\nmaking the half-life the normal state for these strange clans .\nThese creatures are brought up separate from the rest of\nhumanity, and most are unable to exist with vampires or\nhumans .\n∎\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nThe difference between a ghoul and a normal mortal lies in the ghoul's\nlongevity and access to vampiric Disciplines . These differences are what set\na ghoul apart from the unknowing part of kine society, both physically and\nsocially. And these differences are largely responsible for even the most stable\nghoul's eventual alienation from normal life ; the ghoul knows she is a\nchanged creature, no longer just one of the herd . This transition may or may\nnot fit in with her or her loved ones' personal beliefs, ethics or moral values,\nand the pain this conflict can bring proves unbearable for some .\n\n\n~\ni\nii sf\nI\nI 1 1 1\n \nI\n \n \n∎ \nInstructions for the Proper\nUse of This Book\nThis book should broaden the perspectives of both Storytellers and\nplayers . It fleshes out a vital part of the World of Darkness that, until now, has\nbeen largely taken for granted . Ghouls are truly the backbone of Kindred\nsociety, enabling vampires to extend their influence to the sunlit hours . This\nmakes ghouls quite necessary for vampires who have political interests -\ncourts of law, businesses and elections are all daytime operations - and for\nthose who have nothing but mischief on their minds . If a vampire wants to\naffect something - anything- in the mortal world while the sun is high, he\nprobably has to use a ghoul to do it . Considering the sheer variety of ways in\nwhich a vampire is likely to want to interact with the world during daytime\nhours, that leaves an awful lot for ghouls to do .\nGhouls are perfect characters for new players who know little about\nMind's Eye Theatre but who would like to play immediately . The opportu-\nnity to learn while playing is invaluable, and the very nature of \"new ghoul\"\nroles explains any \"out-of-character\" awkwardness or ignorance .\nOn the other hand, experienced Mind's Eye Theatre players will find\nghouls to have a capacity for multilevel play, as they can interact with more\ndenizens of the World of Darkness than just vampires . After all, who's to say\nthat a changeling, werewolf or wraith can't cut a deal, and what of the\nambitious Tremere ghoul who's selling his Regnant's vitae to a local mage?\nNor should players be the only ones having fun with ghouls . Storytellers\ncan use ghouls as antagonists or to perpetuate storylines or puncture vampiric\narrogance and to continue game action during daylight hours\n.\nThis book will show that ghouls are much more than slaves or conve-\nnient juice bags . It gives easy-to-follow rules and suggestions on how to create\nand play ghouls. Remember, though, the most important thing is the story!\nThe only real instructions to be paid special heed to are the ones that you\ncome up with . So Storytellers, feel free to disregard that which you disagree\nwith and go wild with what you like . The only limitations to a story are the\nones you set .\nThe Only Rules That Matter\nThese are the most important rules of MET, the only ones that absolutely\nmust be obeyed. Obviously, there are a lot of people out there who either don't\nknow or don't care that it's just a game . On the other hand, there are some\npeople who take the game far too seriously . By following these rules, you\nprovide yourself with ammunition against the former and protect yourself and\n\n\nL \nI\n111 rot uct ], oil\nI\nyour game against the latter. Both groups are equally dangerous to a solid\nMind's Eye Theatre troupe, and these rules are designed to make certain that\noffenders are given as little opportunity as possible to interfere\n.\n# 1- It's only a game.\ni\ni\nThis is by far the most important rule. It is only a game . If a character\nslides into the Beast, if a plot falls apart, if a rival wins the day - it's still only\na game. Don't take things too seriously, as that will spoil not only your\nenjoyment but also the enjoyment of everyone else . If the line between you\nand your character blurs, step back a bit and take some time off . If you see\nanother player confusing himself with his character, get in contact with the\nSoryteller . Someone who takes your play too seriously isn't healthy for a\ngame, or for his fellow players .\nRemember to leave the game behind when it ends . The Masquerade is\na lot of fun; spending time talking about the game is great . However,\nremember that not everyone you know is going o want to hear about your\ncharacter; many will have no idea what you're talking about . Plus, other\nplayers may want time off. Getting together with the rest of the \"household\"\nto bitch about the Regnant over pizza is one thing . It's entirely another to\nwake someone at 6 :00 A.M. on Sunday to ask about putting her Influences\ntoward your pet project .\n\n\ni\ni\nif\ni\n∎\n#2 - No touching.\nNo touching means no touching. None . Ever . There's simply too much\nof a chance that someone will get excited in the heat of combat or some other\nstressful situation and proceed to hurt themselves or someone else, however\naccidentally .\nThis rule also applies to running, jumping, swinging on chandeliers\nthrough sheets of plate glass, and other overly energetic behaviors that can\nresult in injuries . This game is called Mind's Eye Theatre for a reason . If you\ncan imagine yourself as a bloodsucking sycophant, then imagining yourself\nrunning when you're actually walking should he a snap\n.\n#3 - No weapons as props.\nProps are a wonderful way to make a game more real . However, real\nweapons or anything that even looks like a real weapon (and we're talking\nsword canes, peace-bonded claymores, trained attack gerbils, matte-black\npainted waterguns, and sword-shaped toothpicks from martinis) are a definite\nno-no . There are oo many paranoid people in the world who will see a prop\ngun and mistake it for a real one, or who will see a costume dagger and start\nscreaming for the police . Plus, there's the ever-present threat of someone\ngetting hurt. No matter how much having a sword suits your character\nconcept, leave the real thing at home . If you bring it, it's inevitable that the\none time you unsheathe it to show it off, some idiot will come pelting around\nthe corner and neatly skewer himself. The illusion is not worth risking\nanyone's safety .\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nI ib ∎\n\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\n#4 - No drugs or drinking .\nThis is a real no-brainer. Drugs and alcohol help distance you from\nyourself. Roleplaying gives you the chance to be someone else . Why go to all\nthe trouble of creating another persona to inhabit if you're just going to\nwander out of that persona in a haze?\nOn a more serious note, players who are impaired through drugs or\nalcohol represent a danger to other players and a threat to the flow and mood\nof the game. There's nothing wrong with playing a character who's drunk or\nstoned, but actually bringing drugs or alcohol into a game is going too far, not\nto mention the fact that it's possibly illegal. Don't do it .\n#5 - Feel free to ignore or adjust any\nof the rules in this book if it will make\nyour game better.\nWe at White Wolf call this \"The Golden Rule .\" Obviously, it should be\napplied within limits, and rules changes should be consistent throughout a\nstory or chronicle. If your troupe finds a way to handle Celerity that works\nbetter for it than what's set in The Masquerade, by all means go for it\n.\n#6 - Remember, not everyone is\nplaying.\nWhile \"freaking the mundanes\" can be fun, a game can be unnerving or\neven frightening to passersby . Be considerate of nonplayers in your vicinity .\nIf you're in a public area, make sure that your gameplay doesn't alarm random\ncivilians to the point where security or the police are called . Explaining to\nsome \"concerned citizens\" at 3 A .M . that your goblet of \"blood\" is just a glass\nof very red fruit punch is an exercise in futility .\n#7 - Have fun.\nNot \"win .\" Not \"Go out and kill everyone else .\" Just \"Have fun,\" because\nit's not about how the game ends, it's about everything that happens along the\nway.\ni\n\n\ni\nhou Ty\np\nes\nti\nOne cannot raise the bottom of society without benefiting everyone above .\n- Michael Harrington, The Other America\nThe types of ghouls are as varied as the monsters that a child imagines to\nhe under her bed . Forming a far-from-homogenous society, ghouls serve, fight\nand live for their own reasons . However, the ghoul population can he divided\ninto rough thirds : Servitors, revenants and Hunters . Each sort of ghoul has its\nown motivations, and humanity at large would deny relations to most ghouls .\nThey are outside of humanity, tainted by the touch of Caine . The Beast\nprowls the perimeter of every ghoul's soul, looking for a way in, and is all too\nready to pounce when it finds one .\nOf course, each ghoul thinks he has a handle on his situation, and can't\npossibly comprehend what the other types of ghouls are up to . The average\nServitor would rather die than he on his own, while the average Hunter would\naccept destruction before the Bond . As for revenants, the lifestyles of\n\"normal\" ghouls is so far from their own that it is unimaginable .\nAnd so nights are whiled away by these human drinkers of vitae, each one\npassing the decades in her own way . Servitors slave away willingly for their\nimmortal masters. Hunters subdue or slay for their fixes . On the fringes of\nghoul society, revenants lose any semblance to humanity that their ancestors\nmight have once had . And in the shadows skulk other groups, the Arcianists\nand the Talons of Black Rage . There is a multitude of paths from which to\nchoose, even for the Bound .\n21\n\n\n22\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nA Note\nFor more detailed information on ghouls, see Ghouls : Fatal\nAddiction for Vampire : The Masquerade . This chapter gives the\nbasics for purposes of live roleplaying . The following material is\nwritten with ease of play in mind . Any background information in\nFatal Addiction supersedes the material in this chapter at the\nStoryteller's discretion .\nThe Servitors\nMainly thought of as classic \"Renfield\" ghouls, Servitors have been\ngrossly misrepresented over the years . In some ways, this is to their advantage ;\nvampires automatically expect absolute devotion from them . The majority of\nServitor ghouls possess Architect, Sycophant and Visionary Natures, but\nothers are possible .\nMost Servitors spend their lives serving their Regnants through a broad\narray of duties. They are protectors, confidants, stewards and, perhaps most\nimportantly, ambassadors to the mortal world. The vast majority like where\nthey are and what they do . They have nothing but contempt for the ruck and\nrun of mortals, viewing themselves as a step above those who don't have\nKindred vitae on their lips. Vampire strategies for dealing with the mortal\nworld are often modified or even composed by willing Servitors, who are more\nin touch with the living than are their masters . Politicians, judges, advertising\nexecutives, lawyers and real-estate agents make excellent Servitors . A great\nmany Servitors are convinced that they are on the fast track to true\nimmortality, but even those who are content to remain ghouls actively enjoy\nthe perks that their supernatural existence's offer . For most Servitors, power\ncomes at fair price, and they'd gladly pay it again\n.\nOn the other hand, some Servitors actively work toward the day when\nthey can turn their formidable knowledge against their masters . This ingrati-\ntude is usually born not of hatred, but of sheer boredom . As the decades grind\non, quasi-immortality does not always wear well on a living creature . Ennui\nwages a harsh war against these ghouls, and they are at times ill-prepared for\nbattle . For some Servitors, this rebellious streak survives even under the\ncompact of the Blood Bond, becoming a subconscious rejection of slavery .\nDisgruntled Servitors do not always mean their Regnants harm, but many do .\nOthers set events in motion against their Regnants just so they can swoop in\nand \"save\" their beloved masters, hopefully garnering affection and attention\nfrom the suitably grateful vampires .\n\n\nCompetition in the household is the other great problem that faces\nServitor ghouls . Rarely is a single ghoul sufficient to meet all of a vampire's\nneeds, and in many cases there are at least three Bound o a given Regnant .\nRivalries often flare as ghouls fight for their Regnant's attention ; supernatu-\nrally induced jealousy is as virulent (if not more so) as the natural kind . When\nselecting their ghouls, most vampires rarely consider whether or not their\nservants are going to get along . They simply look for mortals who can get the\njob done . This policy often backfires, though ; ghouls can spend more time\nsquabbling than accomplishing their tasks . Such competition can even turn\ndeadly; ghouls can mount their own Jyhads or he destroyed by Regnants who\ngrow tired of all the bickering .\nIn their favor, Servitors can draw on their Regnants' ample resources\n.\nFurthermore, when they can agree with one another, ghouls belonging to a\nsingle vampire don't usually mind sharing their personal influences, so long\nas the privilege isn't abused . Valued Servitors, like any important resource,\nare frequently protected by their owners, and this provides them with some\ndegree of safety in the shadow society that they move in . In addition, many\nServitors need never worry about necessities like food, lodging and the like,\nas Regnants often provide these things through simple necessity of maintain-\ning a ghoul staff .\nIn the end, though, Servitors are handpicked by vampires to serve . It\nstands to reason, then, that vampires pick mortals who have something o\noffer . Serviors without useful skills or contacts are a waste of vitae, and are\nnot tolerated .\n\n\ni\nUnfortunately, not all vampires make good masters, and mistreatment of\nServitors has become legendary among ghouls . They hear tales of abuse and\ntorment, and eventually even the most pampered ghouls may glance uneasily\nat their Regnants . After being dangled as bait for an enemy or forced to run\nmissions through hazardous territory enough times, even the most loyal\nServitor begins to question the wisdom of continuing her current employ-\nment. Particularly vicious abuse can spark a ghoul to open revolt ; a servant\nwho is held loyal only by the frayed tethers of the Blood Bond may not be held\nfor long. Less openly rebellious Servitors can act like the djinni of Arabian\nmyth and conduct their Regnants' business by the letter of the command, not\nthe spirit . This game can he dangerous for both parties . A vampire whose\ncommands aren't followed to specification may find herself in hot water,\nwhile a ghoul who is willfully disobedient too many times can find his\nservitude at a violent end .\nYet the vast majority of Servitors are happy in bondage . Decades of being\ndenied true immortality or years of abuse can slowly sour a Servitor on her\nstation, but almost no Servitor would change her status to he a mere human\n.\nStereotypes\nHunters - These idiots have no idea what they're doing . If they'd settle\ndown and take to one master, they might be happier . Never let the hard cases\ninto the house, but if you can see the softness in a Hunter's eyes, you just might\nhe able to turn him hack to his proper place . Careful with the hard sell,\nthough; most Hunters can spot it, and resent it. \"Traitor\" is probably the\nnicest name you'll hear after that .\nRevenants - Never hesitate to inform your Regnant if you ever meet\none of these disgusting monsters . Death isn't permanent enough for these\nbeasts!\nKindred - Our masters know what is best for us . After all, they've had\na long time to learn about life, haven't they? It's best to keep them happy and\ndo as they say. Just look at all they give us in return-maybe even the ultimate\ngift .\nSabbat -Never, ever believe anything a Sabbat vampire says to you . No\nmatter what one offers, he's lying . If you're approached by a Sabbat vampire,\ntell your Regnant immediately . Don't try to he a hero . Play along to gather all\nthe information you can, instead .\nMortals - They have no idea what they're missing, and it's best to keep\nit that way. Can you imagine the chaos if the hoi polloi got access to the things\nwe do? No, it's far better to observe them from above than to try to elevate\nthem. Poor bastards .\n\n\nHunters\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nLlap62 Ghoul 1jPZS\nHunters are divided into two classes : those who hunt to kill and those\nwho hunt to survive . A killer often has a past blackened by a vampire who\nkilled a loved one, attacked the Hunter, or abused him as a Servitor . Rarer are\nthe religious or moralistic fanatics who wander their way into ghouldom\n.\nThese killers are intent on stamping out \"evil,\" and attempt to use the Devil's\nown tools against him . As witch-hunter ghouls come from every walk of life,\ntheir array of possible Natures is astounding .\nSome Hunter ghouls slay every vampire they meet without mercy,\ndelaying the coup de grace just long enough to take their victims' blood . The\nraison d'etre for this behavior is, supposedly, that only vampire blood enables\nthese noble Hunters to continue their war with the bloodsuckers . Ask any\nvampire-killer and he will swear up and down that he regards his addiction\nto blood as a necessary evil, and that if he could be free of it, he would . Of\ncourse, most of these Hunters have stashed away huge stocks of Blood Traits\nto support both their hunts and their habits . There are even rumors of elder\nghouls, their lifespans prolonged by centuries, who pick off young Hunters to\nreduce competition for the precious vitae .\n∎\nHunters and Vampires\nMany vampires who wish to dispose of rivals without\ntempting the consequences of diablerie turn to Hunter ghouls\nto do their dirty work . Few of these vampires actively work with\ntheir unsuspecting hatchetmen . Instead, such vampiric quis-\nlings drop hints or have their Servitors leave clues for the\nhapless Hunters to follow to rivals' havens . Most Hunters\nfollow a trail, congratulate themselves on their cleverness, and\nnever suspect that they've been played like violins. Only a few\nvery experienced Hunters can recognize such schemes .\n∎ \n∎\nThe greatest advantage that Hunter-killer ghouls have is their organiza-\ntional capacity . Most, if not all, have a vast network of contacts ; a lively trade\nin information, tactics and tools occurs whenever Hunters cross paths . There\nare even societies of Hunter-killer ghouls, though most groups of this sort tend\nto have lifespans of under a decade . Casualty ratios and inevitable infiltra-\ntions by Servitor ghouls render even the most effective collections of killers\nimpotent after a few years .\n25\n\n\n \nI i l l l\ni\ni \n∎\n I\nTi~~er ties Uoia1es\n∎\n1\nThere are also Hunter ghouls who do not kill their prey . The equivalent\nof \"Sandman\" vampires, these Hunters stalk vampires for vitae to support\ntheir own immortality, and nothing more . They have no ties to one another,\nthough some have formed working relationships with vampires . Indomitable\nsurvivors and loners by choice, these Hunters actively shy away from the\nBond. They drink from the same font twice only ifin the direst of straits, and\nmany claim that death is preferable to the Bond .\nHarvester Hunters (as these are called) have a number of stalking\ntechniques that closely mirror those of vampires themselves . Some prefer to\nslip into a marked vampire's haven and secretly draw blood from the\nunsuspecting victim . Others prefer seduction. There are even those who\nprefer to assault vampires physically and take their vitae, but most of this sort\ndon't live very long .\nHunting the hunters can be an extremely complicated proposition for\nghouls who are out for blood instead of ash . Most witch-hunters have the\nsimple aim of annihilating their targets ; Harvesters have to get in close and\nstay there in order to get what they need . It goes without saying that there are\nfar safer places to he than at a vampire's bedside, IV in hand . While these\nghouls do have the traditional Kindred advantage that their prey is usually\nunaware that it is being hunted (How many vampires really worry about\nmortals hunting them for their blood?), the actual hunt is fraught with\ndifficulties and dangers . Hunters using a Casanova approach have a hard time\npicking up marks when vampires have so many other willing victims to\nchoose from . Sandman Hunters are also faced with paranoid vampires'\nexasperating and potentially fatal daylight security . Indeed, considering the\nrisk-to-reward ratio for this sort of hunting, it is surprising how many ghouls\nmake a go of it .\nThe only tried-and-true method these ghouls have (and it is a surpris-\ningly effective one) involves befriending Servitors with the hope of being\npermitted to drop by a haven for a quick sip . The Servitor who agrees to this\narrangement had better he quite sure that he's indispensable . A vampire who\nawakens weaker than she ought to be will have some pointed questions for her\nfavorite ghouls, and may not like the answers she receives . In addition, many\nHunters tell stories about throwing themselves through second-story win-\ndows in panicked attempts to get away from light-sleeping vampires .\nOver the years the two Hunter factions of ghouls have grown increas-\ningly aware ofeach another . Neither is comfortable with the other's approaches\nor tactics, but the war against the common enemy takes precedence over any\ninternecine strife .\n\n\n•\n~- l\n•\n'~\n-~1 )\nHunter Stereotypes\nServitors - Slaves, the lot of them . They're weak . Some of them can't\nhelp it because of the Bond, but most love licking vampire boots . If you can\nhide your disgust, a houseboy can be helpful in getting a pint in a tough\nsituation, but that's as far as it goes .\nRevenants - They're the reason I don't believe in God .\nKindred - We can't live with `em, we can't live without `em, and I for\none don't much like either option .\nSabbat-No mercy ; they won't show you any . We're not even a resource\nto them, we're a meal!\nMortals- In the grand scheme of things, they just don't matter, except\nas food for vampires . Otherwise, they're nothing more than speed bumps on\nthe road we're all taking to Hell .\nThe Revenant Families\nCreated over a millennium ago through pacts made with the Tzimisce,\nthese four ghoul families are born with vampire blood in their veins . Reveling\nin debauchery and sadism above and beyond what their service to the Fiends\ndemands, Revenants have a foul reputation even among the Sabbat .\nRevenants don't need vampire blood to survive their first 300 years . The\nTzimisce blood that the families are infused with has changed their genetic\nstructure . Revenants seeking more than three centuries' existence do require\n27\n\n\n28\ndosages of vampire blood, but not many last even 300 years . The foul pleasures\nthat these creatures revel in do have their dangers .\nThe revenant families are not in the safest of positions, despite their\nadvantage of not needing the blood to reach a great age . Loyal to the Sabbat,\nincapable of true interaction with mortals, and without hope of ever being\nallowed into the Camarilla, revenants' actions are tightly circumscribed\n.\nThey are trapped in an organization that allows for no growth, and in which\nthe majority of their putative allies would like nothing better than to\nobliterate them . Four of the original eight revenant families have already\nbeen \"culled,\" and there are constant rumors that an additional purge of one\nfamily or another is coming . Despite the talents, resources and apparent\nunimpeachable loyalty of the revenant families, the vast majority of Sabbat\nvampires would still destroy every last one of them ; only the backing of Clan\nTzimisce sustains the ghoul clans . However, the Tzimisce support the four\nfamilies more in principle than anything else these days (by right of Sabbat\nlaw, a single mistake can earn a ghoul immediate and gory release from this\nmortal coil) .\nThe four families of revenant ghouls include the Bratoviches (\"Mon-\nsters\"), the Grimaldis (\"Puppets\"), the Obertuses (\"Hermits\") and the Zantosas\n(\"Trash\") . Each family gets along with the others tempestuously at best, but\nthere are occasional intermarriages that serve as elaborate displays of so-\ncalled unity and goodwill . The products of such marriages uniformly suffer\nderision and abuse from the families involved\n.\n\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nChap er 2 Ghoul( T'oe\nThe Bratoviches\nThe Bratovich family is widely considered the most disturbing of all of\nthe revenant clans, and the Monsters are now all but completely ignored by\nthe Sabbat . The only service these ghouls still provide to the sect at large is\nthe raising and training of hideous ghouled hounds for hunting . Most\nBratovich households keep large private kennels for personal use, and for\ndisposing of \"accidents.\"\nPragmatic in their dealings with vampires, the Bratoviches have always\nbeen interested in staying on the winning side of any conflict . The one\nexception to the infamous Bratovich shifting loyalty is the hatred the entire\nfamily has for Lupines; Bratovich excellence at hunting and slaughtering\nwerewolves is astonishing. Their keen understanding of Lupine tactics has\nbeen the downfall of many a pack that has wandered too close to one of the\nfamily's large, dilapidated estates. Ofcourse, the atrocities that the Bratoviches\npractice - cannibalism, vivisection and the like - produce enough of a\nWyrm-taint to lure in altruistic or unwary Lupines . Few werewolves realize\nwhat they're getting into, and fewer get out alive .\nWhile not actively anachronistic, these ghouls are reclusive and possess\nfew modern conveniences like televisions, radios or microwave ovens. On the\nother hand, Bratoviches are compulsive pack rats. The Monsters' estates are\nabsolutely filled to overflowing with the junk that the households have\ncollected over the decades. Neither personal hygiene nor landscaping is high\non the list of Bratovich priorities . Family estates and their tenants tend to he\nequally repulsive in appearance (not to mention odor)\n.\nOddly enough, Bratovich children attend public schools like normal\nchildren, but also attend classes at home . Toxicology, animal handling,\ntorture and other extremely liberal arts are at the top of each semester's\nschedule .\nVampire blood is such an integral part of the Monsters that they actually\nhave a clan weakness. Monsters are prone to frenzy . In terms of game\nmechanics, this flaw functions exactly like the weakness of the Brujah clan .\nFor more information, see Laws of the Night .\nBratovich Stereotypes\nServitors -Stupid pawns . Let `em lead you to their masters, then feed\n'em to your dogs .\nHunters - They're kinda fun to bother, but not much of a threat . A\nHunter will usually attack until you fuse his mouth and nose shut, then he'll\njust kinda fall over and wriggle a bit before he suffocates . Take pictures to\nshow the kids!\nKindred - Show off that good-neighbor side until they're not looking,\nthen plan a barbecue!\n\n\nLiber\nt e\n(joules\nSabbat - Be on your best behavior around Sabbat types, because they\ncan kick our butts if they decide we're getting uppity . It means eating dirt\nsometimes, but it also means living to see the sunrise .\nMortals - Breeding stock, if that. Most get one whiff and decide to back\noff. Smart people .\nThe Grimaldis\nOf all the revenant clans, the Grimaldis who work the best in the mortal\nworld. Blending in with an ease born of years of practice, the Puppets are\nperhaps the most human of the revenant families . Many even develop\nadditional Humanity Traits, as opposed to members of the other revenant\nfamilies (who frequently lose those Traits with appalling speed) . Most of this\nrelatively enlightened existence comes from the intense contact the Grimaldis\nhave with mortals throughout their lives . Grimaldi children go through\nnormal public or private schools and colleges while being groomed for\nlifetimes of servitude . Most adult Grimaldi actually function as part of the\nregular work force, as their utility to the Tzimisce extends far beyond their\nhomes and pets .\nThis family serves as a link between the Sabbat and the mortal world ;\nmore than one vampire has referred to the Grimaldi as the Servitors of the\nSabbat. In essence, the Grimaldi are in charge of maintaining a masquerade\nfor the Sabbat . With the support of their vampiric allies and human contacts,\nthey control most of the media in Sabbat-held cities . The family is also quite\nproficient at the fine arts of blackmail and bribery, a fact which routinely puts\nmortal movers and shakers firmly in the Grimaldi pocket .\nThese ghouls are both highly organized and incredibly wealthy, to the\npoint where they almost rival the Ventrue and Giovanni in influence .\nIndeed, Puppet cunning and skill at high finance is a match for those of the\nVentrue; more than one Blue Blood has been appalled to discover that the up-\nand-comer that he had targeted for the Embrace was in fact a Grimaldi .\n(Note : When creating a Grimaldi, it is always a good idea to purchase as many\nInfluences as possible .)\nThe only thing preventing a Grimaldi from gaining the normal maxi-\nmum of Humanity Traits is something inherent to the family : Every last\nPuppet is Blood Bound to a Sabbat bishop or archbishop . This tight rein is\nviewed as a necessary precaution . After all, Grimaldi ghouls have both the\nresources and the capability to do severe damage should they develop\nsufficient incentive . However, at this point the mandatory Bond is almost\nnever more than symbolic, as the Grimaldis would seem to be perfectly loyal .\nA Sabbat \"patron,\" as a Grimaldi refers to her blood donor, seldom calls on\n(or even calls for) this Blood Bond . It is the Grimaldi themselves who submit\nwillingly to the Bond . They make this gesture out of both respect and loyalty,\nL \nperhaps to convince the Sabbat that they are worth keeping around .\n\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nLao er 2 C oill T~Oes\n∎\ni\nGrimaldi Stereotypes\nServitors - A mixed hag is the best way of describing these folks . The\ngood ones are probably the smartest ghouls . They know how to get what they\nwant, not to mention what's really worth wanting . The worst ones might as\nwell he dirt .\nHunters - It's just stupid to kill that which makes you what you are\n.\nBesides, ghouls who make too much noise are reminiscent of the proverbial\nnail that stands out, begging to he hammered down . These ghouls make a lot\nof noise .\nKindred - It's ironic that we're often compared to Camarilla ghouls -\nor vampires . We're all about business while they're all about self-aggrandize-\nment. If a Cam vampire targets you for the Embrace, remove his illusions-\nOtherwise, things will get sticky .\nSabbat - Stay on their good side and they'll ignore you . That's all you\nreally want from them, so you can get on with your life without being tangled\nup in their nasty power struggles . Tzimisce versus Lasombra versus antitribu\nversus - who cares? Take care of your own business .\nMortals -Sometimes you have to envy their ignorance . Other times you\nhave to pity them . They're caught up in a game they don't even understand\n.\n\n\n* 32\nThe Obertuses\n∎\nThe Obertus family has earned the nickname \"Hermits\" for its members'\nextensive research into esoteric knowledge and lore . These ghouls reside in\nsmall communities composed entirely of family members, usually far from the\nhustle and hustle of big cities . Most Obertus settlements are located in New\nEngland, the American Midwest and Central America, but other villages are\nscattered all over the globe . While there's nothing overtly odd about an\nObertus village, visitors are not welcome, and enough odd things will happen\nduring the course of a single day (or night) to drive off even the most\ninsensitive tourist .\nThe Ohertuses are the quiet ones of the revenant families, and their\nobsessive search for information has taken them in some strange directions\n.\nAlthough their relentlessly rational approach (not to mention strict hewing\nto the Paths of Enlightenment) has kept the majority of family members sane\nin the face of even the foulest of discoveries, a few relatives passed beyond the\ngates of sanity long ago . The problem is that you can never tell who the mad\nones are . . . .\nIt is said, and rightly so, that some of the world's greatest scholars are\nObertus revenants . While Obertus children have no formal education, they\ndo receive private tutoring from family members, who are more than qualified\nto teach . This phase of Hermit education lasts until a child becomes old\nenough to seek his own teachers and fields of study . At this point, his life-long\nquest for true knowledge begins . Only death ends that search and the\nOhertuses hoard every hit of knowledge they acquire . The eldest members of\nthe family have accumulated astonishing libraries over the centuries, and\nyoung Obertus ghouls may - if they are properly respectful - occasionally\nbe permitted to access these tremendous resources .\nThe Obertus family retains close ties to Clan Tzimisce, but seldom\nactively involves itself in vampiric affairs . However, the Obertuses do serve\nthe information brokers of the Sabbat, and have successfully infiltrated the\nSociety of Leopold, the Arcanum and a number of other esoteric organiza-\ntions. Of special interest to these ghoulish moles is information on Caine,\ndemons, Lupines and mages.\nThe weakness of the family is a predictable one : intellectual obsession .\nOnce an Obertus is hooked on a subject, she'll follow an information trail to\nthe ends of the earth, regardless of danger or cost\n.\nObertus Stereotypes\nServitors - At least these ghouls make themselves useful . I really have\nno interest in them beyond that.\nHunters - They are both pragmatic and illogical . If the blood is what\nthey desire, there are more efficient ways of obtaining it . If they wish to kill\nvampires, there are more effective ways of doing that, too . However, the\n\n\nI\nI\n1\n1 1 I\n∎\nCllr\nkr 2 'llh0\n( T1)nes\nI \n ∎\ndegrees of success they have achieved in both regards means that their\nmethods warrant closer observation .\nKindred - Many are vast fonts of knowledge . Those who are not are best\ntreated well until they move on. The fewer questions they ask about what we\nare doing, the better . We have no wish to he caught between the two sects\nwhen they clash over the secrets they think we possess .\nSabbat - Which Sabbat are we talking about? The old members of the\nsect are gracious, knowledgeable and intelligent . They respect what we do,\nand we have no difficulties serving them . The young Sabbat are rude, crude,\nloud things with no respect for knowledge or those who preserve it . Our doors\nare shut to these fools .\nMortals - They are useful for experimentation, among other things .\nFew live long enough to accumulate any knowledge worth seeking, but\nsometimes it is the flame that burns out most quickly that shines the brightest\n.\nThe Zantosas\nUnquestionably the prime hedonists of the revenant families, the\nZantosas love pleasure and excess above all else . A Zantosa will inevitably be\npreceded by his family's reputation into any social situation . Every revenant\nhas stories about the lengths to a Zantosa will go to in order to satisfy some\nperversion or other. Such tales are almost the equivalent of \"light-bulb jokes .\"\nOn the other hand, the Trash may be hedonists, but they are not idle ones\n.\nThe family is fabulously wealthy, and has a genetically transmitted streak of\nirrepressible cruelty that makes it less of a joke and more of a dangerous\ncuriosity to those who meet its members .\nDescended from a cluster of noble houses in Eastern Europe, the Zantosas\nserved as a sort-of breeding pool for the Tzimisce . For centuries these ghouls\nworked as spies in Europe's most powerful courts, and those who served the\nTzimisce well were rewarded on rare occasions with the Embrace . Well\ntrusted and unquestionably loyal, the gaggle of families (now so thoroughly\nintermarried as to be essentially one lineage) followed the Tzimisce into the\nfledgling Sabbat . Many members of the family were Embraced to serve as\ncannon fodder during the Sabbat-Camarilla wars .\nThanks to their grasp of Vicissitude, the Trash are easily the most\nattractive of the ghoul families . Dancing on the cutting edge of technology\nand hedonism, most Zantosas dabble in drugs (dealing or using) as well as\nother assorted antisocial or illegal behaviors . It is very important to a Zantosa\nto have the latest technological toys and marvels, and just as important to\nhave traveled to all of the \"hot\" spots . A Zantosa who's a season behind the\ntimes in anything is as good as forgotten by the rest of the family, at least until\nshe catches up with the social whirl .\nZantosas tend to keep spotless homes and stables . Their stables, however,\nalso serve as pantries ; these ghouls have a peculiar taste for horseflesh . A\n33\n\n\nI\ndinner invitation to a Zantosa residence is not for the faint of heart or weak\nof stomach .\nCulinary perversion is not the most closely held secret of the Zantosas .\nThat honor falls to the fact that they, alone among of all the revenant\nfamilies, guard the slumbering Tzimisce Antediluvian . Were this to become\nknown, the family would he exterminated and the Antediluvian exhumed,\nundoubtedly to disastrous effect .\nThe Zantosas' greatest weakness is their addictions . If given intense\npleasure by anything, a Zantosa must make a Static Challenge or immediately\nacquire an addiction to the source .\nZantosa Stereotypes\nServitors - Booooooooring . You can't liven up a Servitor's day with\nanything . . . except maybe slipping acid into her groceries .\nHunters -They're not exactly party animals, and they always have such\nserious faces! Always thinking about their next infusion of blood-this and\nnext-hunt-that; they make lousy conversation . Even we're not that bad .\nKindred -The fangdaddies are fun, if not exactly safe to be around . Still,\nlife's never dull when you're palling around with the living dead! Besides, the\nlook on a Cammy vamp's face when he realizes he's been necking with a\nrevenant is priceless!\nSabbat - Some of these vampires have a sense of humor that matches\nours, and we'll work with them when it doesn't throw our own schedules out\nof whack . Avoid the \"destroy-the-Camarilla\" types . They'll waste us as\nquickly as their enemies.\nMortals - Wheeee! Humans are fun, fun, fun to play with, but they\nbreak easily . Too bad .\nOther Ghouls\nThe Arcianist Historical Society\nThe Arcianist Historical Society has come far and changed much in the\nlast few years . The core of the group consists of five renegade Tremere ghouls\nwho, fueled by the vitae of an imprisoned seventh-generation vampire, plot\nto destroy the vampires of the world . Protected by a series of spells that\ndisguise their true natures, these five ghouls serve as a clearinghouse of ghoul\ncandidates for the Ventrue of the Camarilla . The society has links with the\nSabbat as well, but its main business is with the Camarilla\n.\nWhile the ghouls that the Arcianists supply are uniformly excellent -\nintelligent, talented and attractive - they do come with one hidden feature .\nEach Arcianist-trained ghoul is implanted with a post-hypnotic suggestion .\nThis hidden programming ensures that on a certain date, each ghoul that the\n\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\nLii p cr 2 't1liou Ii.)pes\nI \n ∎ \nSociety provides will dial a phone number and detail the defenses of her\nRegnant's haven. What follows will almost certainly be academic, not to\nmention bloody.\nThe ghouls of the society never deal directly with their vampire custom-\ners . Instead, they use their secretary Jeanette as a front . Most of the Arcianists'\ncustomers respect this desire for privacy. The rest contribute to the light of the\nsunrise .\nThe Society does deal with the Sabbat, and the groups occasionally\ncooperate on hunting down a particularly meddlesome Camarilla vampire . In\nthe end, however, the five ghouls of the Society don't intend to spare even\ntheir erstwhile allies from their coming purge .\nTwo members of the society possess True Faith, and another is rumored\nto have an artifact called the Undying Heart . All sorts of rumors surround the\nlatter, but one piece of information is cold, hard fact : If the Tzimisce knew of\nthe Heart's location, they'd stop at nothing to retrieve it.\nSociety ghouls have acquired a method for breaking Blood Bonds,\nbeyond other achievements . This knowledge, along with the existence of the\nimprisoned Tremere antitribu in the basement, is kept under the closest of\nwraps. Either tidbit would be explosive enough to bring down considerable\nvampiric wrath on the society . No matter how potent their defenses, the\nArcianists are not capable of holding off a determined assault .\nWhile it is not recommended that players take the parts of the five leaders\nof the Arcianist Historical Society, ghouls recruited by the Arcianists make\nexcellent characters . For more information on the Arcianists, see Antago-\nnists .\nThe Talons of Black Rage\nThe Talons are the result of an eugenics project performed by a small\nnumber of Lasombra, without the consent of Les Amies Noir. (The last such\nproject resulted in the creation of the Kiasyd bloodline . Understandably, the\nclan elders are not eager to repeat that sort of blunder) . The Talons were bred\nfor the express purpose of infiltrating the Black Hand and destroying it from\nwithin. Their secondary mission was (and is) to counter the efforts of the\nrevenant families within the Sabbat, forcing the Tzimisce to disband or\ndestroy those ghouls. Most Sabbat - even most Lasombra - are unaware of\nthe Talons' existence . The Lasombra progenitors of these ghouls intend to\nkeep it that way .\nTo date there are 13 members of the Talons : seven men and six women .\nAll are followers of the Path of Power and the Inner Voice, and all are familiar\nwith Obtenebration, Chimerstry and assorted martial arts . Five generations\nof Talons have been bred, and each successive brood is increasingly deadly .\nThe existing Talons are each more than a match for most neonate vampires .\nFor more information on the Talons, see Antagonists .\n4~lk _-~ J\n\n\n I\n~-hap1es 3\nkrai kr\nw~~~ic~n\nPeople seem not to see that their opinion of the world is also a confession of\ncharacter .\n- R. W.

If you are not familiar with either\nof those books, read one of them before attempting to use the\nfollowing material .\nAny lists of Traits, Merits or Flaws that are not included in\nthis hook can he found in Laws of the Night or\n∎\nThe Masquerade : Second Edition .\n∎\nCharacter Concept: Who Are You?\nIt has often been said that a story with incredible characters and a\nhorrible plot will go farther than one with an outstanding plot and one-\ndimensional characters . The key to an interesting story is characterization,\nand good characterization begins with building a character from the ground\nup. After all, in creating a character you are in a sense creating a person, and\nyou need to consider exactly who this person is . This process does not consist\n\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nL7)('1' ( pS\n't1p171F;ti\nof slapping a name on a list of adjectives . You have to think about what makes\nthis person so interesting to you that you want to be her for an evening (or\nseveral evenings) . If there's nothing interesting about your character, you're\nnot going o he interested in being - or playing - her .\nIdentifying with your character is important, so you might want to draw\non subjects that you're interested in to add depth to her background . If you're\ninterested in a particular historical period, consider giving your character\nsome involvement in the important events of that era . If you like rock\nclimbing, even if you've never so much as scaled a particularly tall anthill,\nconsider adding it o your character's list of interests .\nOnce you have a basic idea of who your character is, start imagining her\nhisory. Figure out who she was and what happened in her past that made her\nwho she is today . Details like where she was horn, her economic circum-\nstances, and the time period and setting of her upbringing have great impact\non your character's life .\nYour character may have entered the world of vampires at any point in\nhistory that makes sense (the height of the Sumerian empire, for example, is\nright out) . If your character was horn in America in the '50s and became a\nghoul in the '70s, she must have been profoundly affected by all the political\nupheavals she lived through . The Vietnam War, Watergate, the disillusion-\nment of a country, conspiracies - all of these should he reflected in her\noutlook (which may have crystallized somewhat at the moment she was made\na ghoul) .\n\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nL1wp1er 3 (]\n.Air GicAm, \nAn important part of any character is her name . While you may\nWhat's in a Name?\nthink naming is the least important part of character design, the\nname you choose for your ghoul is the one you're going to be\nanswering to - perhaps for a long time . A good name also goes a\nlong way toward cementing a character's image. If you doubt that,\nconsider this : Would you be in any way, shape or form terrified of a\nBrujah named Alouicious?\nIf you have trouble naming your character, books of baby names\nare useful . Many provide lists of names from other countries and\ncultures, assuming you decide to give your character a background\nfrom further afield than the local suburbs . Nicknames are fun, too,\nbut ones like Slash or Blade get redundant fast - odds are the local\nvampiric community already supports at least three guys with similar\nmonosyllabic handles.\nConsider your character's biological age, particularly the year in which\nshe stopped aging. Ghouls can he of any age, although small children and\nnonagenarians are not recommended . Your character's apparent age dictates\nhow people treat her, and can affect her outlook on life . If your character\nbecame a ghoul at age 14, all the fake IDs in the world aren't going to help her\nget into a bar. If your character is middle-aged, she might get more respect on\none level, but people are going to underestimate her physical capabilities .\nOnce you have decided on a time and place as the starting point for your\ncharacter, think about what events have shaped your character's life . Writing\nup a brief synopsis is helpful . It doesn't have to he a 12-volume epic, but it's\ngood to get some grounding that will give you material to work with later\n.\nConsider the questions : Did your character come from a dysfunctional family?\nWas her upbringing perfectly mundane? Was she wealthy? What did her\nparents do? Was she raised by a single parent? How far did she get in school?\nWhat special talents does she possess? Is she a citizen or an immigrant? Did\nshe have siblings? Does she have a job? Is she married? What are her interests?\nHopefully these questions will fuel your creative processes and bring you\nto the moment of truth : the entrance of a Regnant into your character's life .\nOdds are your character will enter the game as a ghoul, so you need to decide\na few things about your Regnant and your character's relationship with him .\n\n\nTiller tips Gwilus\nSteps of Ghoul Character Creation\nStep One: Inspiration - Who are you?\n- Choose your Regnant\n- Choose a Nature and Demeanor\nStep Two : Attributes - What are your basic capabilities?\n- Prioritize Attributes (seven Primary, five Secondary and\nthree Tertiary)\nStep Three : Advantages - What do you know?\n- Choose five Abilities\n- Choose one Discipline (Celerity, Fortitude or Potence only)\n- Choose three Influences\n- Choose Humanity Traits\nStep Four: Last Touches - Fill in the details .\n- Assign Blood Traits\n- Assign Willpower Traits\n- Record Status Trait of Recognized\nI\n- Choose Negative Traits (if any)\nStep Five: Spark of Life - Narrative descriptions\nChoosing Your Regnant\nBefore you begin choosing Attributes, Abilities and Disciplines, you\nhave to decide who your Regnant is . Choosing another player's vampire\ncharacter or a nonplayer character is best for many reasons . With another\nplayer as a Regnant, you automatically have someone to roleplay with, and\na means to introduce your character to the plots already in progress . Further-\nmore, when that time of the month rolls around, your character has someone\nto give her blood .\nYou also need to decide how your character feels about her Regnant .\nDoes her Regnant mistreat her? Is she in love with him? Is she jealous of his\nother ghouls? Defining the Regnant-Thrall relationship early on is vital\n.\nYou also need to figure out what you do for your Regnant, and why he\nkeeps you around . If the vampire has other ghouls, you should establish your\nrelationships with them . The history of your dealings with your Regnant need\nto be laid down, including his reasons for taking you under his vampiric wing .\nEverything that you come up with should be cleared with a Storyteller, but\nonce this groundwork is established, you're ready for the hard part : assigning\nTraits .\n\n\nI\nNature and Demeanor\nYour Nature is your character's true self, which is often hidden from the\nworld. Your ghoul's Demeanor, however, is the facade she wears when dealing\nwith others . A character's Nature and Demeanor can he the same or widely\ndifferent, depending on her approach o the world . A complete listing of\nNatures and Demeanors can be found in The Masquerade : Second Edition\n(p. 19), but you don't have to limit yourself o the ones in print . With\nSoryteller approval, you can come up with unique Archetypes for your\ncharacter .\nStep Two: Attributes\nYour Attributes describe everything that your ghoul is . When you see a\nweight lifter on television, the adjectives that you might use to describe him\nwould be Traits used in Mind's Eye Theatre roleplaying . You could say that\nhe was Brawny, Burly or Tough. A suave soap opera star might be described as\nAlluring, Charming or Gorgeous . In Mind's Eye Theatre, all of these things\nbecome Traits that your character possesses .\nFrom the list of Attributes in Laws of the Night, decide which ones best\ndescribe your character . Attributes fall into three categories : Physical, Men-\ntal and Social . You need to pick one of these three as your Primary and assign\nseven Traits o it. The one next in importance is Secondary ; give this category\nfive Traits. The remaining one is Tertiary, which receives three Traits\n.\nLet your character inspiration determine your Attributes . If your ghoul\nis a bodyguard for the Ventrue primogen, making Physical Attributes his\nweakest area would not be wise . You may take a Trait more than once if you\nwant to reflect a greater level of aptitude in a particular area . For example, the\naforementioned power lifter might have Brawny x 5 .\nStep Three: Advantages\nChoosing Abilities\nAbilities are the skills your character has picked up in life . Whether your\nghoul learned to fight, perform surgery or write poetry, all of these Abilities\nmay come into play during a sory . Each Ability allows you to perform a\nspecialized task, and on occasion Ability Traits can be hid instead of\nAttributes . Choose five Traits from the complete list on page 23 of Laws of\nthe Night\n. Additional, ghoul-specific Abilities can he found in this hook on\npage 41 .\nDisciplines\nGhouls must choose their initial Discipline from among the so-called\nPhysical Disciplines. If you take Negative Traits or Flaws, these points may\n,f\n41 :\n\n\nI\n42\nhe used to buy other Disciplines, but only if you also take the Merit : Learn\nOther Disciplines . You can find a complete description of Disciplines starting\non page 75 of Laws of the Night .\nChoosing Influences\nInfluences represent the control you exert over the World of Darkness\n.\nThese are the subtle player's bread and butter . If Brujah punks give you\ntrouble, they might learn their lesson when you spend enough Police Influ-\nences to have their haven raided at 10 :30 A.M . You may take three Influences\nduring character creation. Your choices are listed in Laws of the Night,\nstarting on page 29. These Influences may be the reason you were made into\na ghoul, the things that your Regnant puts you in charge of, or may simply be\nthings you have acquired on your own .\nChoosing Humanity Traits\nThe last part of the Advantages stage is selecting your three Humanity\nTraits from the list in the Humanity section on page 36 of this book . These\nrepresent your ties to your human side that oppose the Beast within you .\nStep Four: Last Touches\nYou may now more fully define your character by taking up to four\nNegative Traits . This step is completely optional, but does allow you to take\nadditional positive Traits, Influences and Humanity Traits on a one-for-one\nbasis. Purchasing Numina costs two Negative Traits per level of Numina\n.\nNow is the time to record your four Blood Traits and one Willpower Trait\non your character sheet.\nYou may also take up to five Traits' worth of Flaws and five of Merits,\nassuming your character concept supports them . In other words, a ghoul with\nthe Flaw : Low Pain Threshold probably doesn't have several facial piercing\n.\nIf it's in character, you can also take Derangements . They provide extra\npoints to spend. For each Derangement that you take, you receive two\nadditional Traits to spend on your character . Revenants are required take one\nDerangement during character creation, but do not receive extra Traits from\nit .\nSample Character Creation\nGina has been playing a Ventrue for a while, and wants a break . She\nwould like to bring in a new character, and her Storyteller suggests a ghoul .\nShe comes up with the foundation of her ghoul character. Her ghoul is\na blues singer, Blood Bound to a Gangrel who's just entered the city . The\nStoryteller checks with the Gangrel's player, who agrees to it, and it's off to\nthe races .\n1\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\n1\n1\nI\n\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nO \"'PI, 3\nw'ir Ga!on\nFirst, Gina comes up with a name . Flipping through the paper, she comes\nacross the name \"Jimenez.\" She likes the sound of it, and looks for a first name\nin a baby-name book . \"Maya\" has a nice ring to it and fits harmoniously with\nher chosen surname . Now that Maya has a name, Gina thinks about who\nMaya actually is.\nHer deliberation determines that Maya was a singer in roadside clubs\nwhen she caught the attention of a traveling Gangrel named Kekkova\nRomanovich, who was looking for some companionship on the road . Back-\nstage, Kekkova made her offer to Maya, who, tired of playing the same\none-horse towns, accepted . The two have been together ever since, with\nMaya doing Kekkova's legwork and scouting out potential victims .\nThe back story makes sense to both the Storyteller and Kekkova's player,\nso it's on to Traits . While Maya comes across as something of a dreamer, she's\nhappiest when she has her own space, something that Kekkova respects . Gina\nchooses the Nature and Demeanor, Loner and Visionary, respectively . Next,\nGina ranks Mental, Social and Physical Traits in that order, and picks the\nspecific Traits that suit her concept of a tough-but-attractive singer who has\nmanaged to survive on her own in a very nasty world .\nPicking Attributes\nGina chooses the Mental Traits Cunning, Shrewd and a couple\nof levels of Wily right off the bat. She decides that these are useful in\ncontract negotiations and dealings with promoters and hooking\nagents. Attentive and Vigilant are added, which have enabled Maya to\nspot trouble and duck it . Finally, Gina tacks on Clever, just on general\nprinciple. Maya may not have had much education, but that doesn't\nmean she's dumb .\nNext come Social Traits . Gina starts with Eloquent, as a reflec-\ntion of Maya's talent for writing lyrics . Then it's on to what Traits\nmight make up the singer's stage persona: Beguiling, Dignified, Gor-\ngeous and Seductive .\nLast but not least are Physical Traits . Gina already knows that\nMaya is better at running than fighting, and holds to the philosophy\nthat the safest place to be in a fight is far away from it . She therefore\npicks the Traits Dexterous (x 2) and Quick.\nHumanity comes next, and Gina decides that Maya's actually something\nof a softy . Gina determines that Maya is Generous and Empathetic, but also\nLoyal to Kekkova .\n43\n1\n\n\nA\nsnicis\nspunoz(jae8\nsauildps}Q\nape.zanbsPW\nazoro paapuzx\nEx (buTbuTs) erusuuopza c [\nSalhl(1V\nMerits\nFlaws\nLearn Other  Insomnia\nDisciplines \n(2 Trait Flaw)\n(3 Trait Merit)\nHumanity\nLoyal, Generous,\nEmpathetic\nWillpower\n0000000000\nuaauaauaau\nBlood\n0000000000\nInfluences\nTransportation x 3\nDerangements\nNone\npaztubooag\nSSSeal anue(aN\naseo?T80\nZ X AT TM\n3uPTzb?n 'p^0ss\naanaIO 'b\nshea l leluayq\nanT3uao3y\nsnoobro0\n3ur0T3\neAT3anpe5\nbuzTTnbag\nsattul le)oos\nZ x snoraixaci\nSIYIi lealsdud\nPlayer \nG a DeBarthe\nCharacter \nMaya Jimenez\nChronicle \nDaylight Madness\nNature\nLoner\nDemeanor \nVisionary\nConcept \nTraveling Performer\nRegnant \nKekkova Romanovich\nRegnant's Clan \nGangrel\nHavenWith Kekkova\n\n\nit r\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nThen come Abilities . Three Traits' worth of Performance\nis a must .\nMasquerade\nand Kindred Lore seem natural as well, because Maya and\nKekkova spend considerable time together on the road .\nGina chooses the Celerity Discipline ; Maya's much more into flight than\nfight .\nMaya's only Status Trait is Recognized, so she marks it down and moves\non. As for Influences, knowing the ins and outs of Transportation (x 3) seems\nappropriate, since Maya and Kekkova travel a lot . All ghouls start with four\nBlood Traits, so Gina puts those down along with a single Willpower Trait\n.\nBasic character creation is done at this point, but Gina wants some\nmaneuverability points-wise . She gives her ghoul the Negative Trait : Deli-\ncate . Gina also wants Maya to be able to learn other Disciplines over time, so\nshe gives her the Merit: Learn Other Disciplines. Combined with her Negative\nTrait, this puts her two Traits in the hole . The balance will have to be made\nup somehow. Gina chooses the two-trait Flaw : Insomnia .\nSatisfied, Gina sits down to flesh out the details of Maya's pre-ghoul\nexistence . This record, as well as her character sheet, is shown to a Storyteller\nbefore game time for approval. When play begins, Kekkova is \"reunited\" with\nher favorite ghoul .\nThe Becoming\nI don't like your tragic sighs,\nas if your god has passed you by .\nWell, hey fool, that's your deception .\n- Sarah McLachlan, \"Ice\"\nMaking Mortal Characters into Ghouls\nIn a Mind's Eye Theatre game, new mortals who catch a vampire's eye\ncan expect to be ghouled . The transformation from normal human to ghoul\nbegins with the introduction of vampire blood, one Blood Trait's worth, into\nthe mortal's system . The vitae must somehow enter the body of the intended\nghoul, whether orally or intravenously, or else it has no effect . Topical\napplications of vitae are inevitably failures (not even pouring vampire blood\ninto open wounds has a very high success rate), and are extremely humiliating\nto the vampires caught attempting them .\nIf the vampire making a ghoul has the Flaw : Thin Blooded, or is of 13th\ngeneration, a Static Challenge must be made to determine if the ghouling\nsucceeds. If the vampire wins the mortal becomes a ghoul (would-he creators\nwith Thin Blooded lose all ties) . Ghouls created by Thin Blooded vampires\nacquire the same Flaw . Otherwise the mortal character becomes a perfectly\n\"healthy\" ghoul .\n\n\n∎\nA mortal character acquires a few things immediately upon becoming a\nghoul . The first is the Blood Trait that her creator injects into her system. The\nsecond is an additional Trait in her Primary Attribute category . This Trait,\nas well as any Disciplines learned, is lost should the character ever return to\nfull mortal status .\nOn the other hand, each new ghoul loses a Humanity Trait instantly\n.\nThis Trait is gone forever . It will not automatically return if the ghoul rejoins\nthe mass of humankind .\nHumanity\nA man feared he might find an assassin ;\nAnother that he might find a victim .\nOne was more wise than the other .\n- Stephen Crane\nHumanity is one of the most important parts of a ghoul's being . It\ndescribes how close a ghoul is to his human nature . Conversely, it is also a\nmeasure of how thoroughly a ghoul has been sucked into his Regnant's\nculture. Humans normally start out with four Humanity Traits, and can\nascend to a total of eight . Most ghouls start out with three (one is lost when\nthe blood is taken). Revenants start with one Humanity Trait, and may never\nobtain more than four (only Grimaldi ghouls may get this far ; members of the\nother families are restricted to one) . Revenants' existence is so essentially\ninhuman that it is impossible for them to empathize fully with normal people\n.\nWhile humans and other ghouls can never lose their last Humanity Trait,\nRevenants can and often do .\nHumanity Traits\nBenevolent, Charitable, Chivalrous, Empathetic,\nFair,\nGenerous, Giving, Gracious, Helpful, Honorable, Humane,\nInnocent, Kind, Liberal, Loyal, Merciful, Moral, Naive, Pious,\nSympathetic and Warm .\n46\ni\nCapitalist society at large deems the equivalent of Humanity Traits to be\ndisadvantages . Loyalty keeps you on the low end of the corporate ladder,\nsympathy gets you mugged, and you can't afford to be merciful . Machiavelli's\nPrince is the golden idol of our age, and vampires emulate this ideal to a\nfrightening degree. Ghouls, as reflections of vampires, may attempt to shed\ntheir Humanity to emulate their masters . But, believe it or not, Humanity\ndoes have its benefits.\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n\nX11\n,~'\n11l'&kr C\non I \n ∎\nUsing Humanity\nThe uses of Humanity Traits are varied . Not only can they he used to\npower Numina (as stated in Antagonists), they can he used in other\nsituations .\n• Relief from Derangements - A ghoul player can spend one Human-\nity Trait in the presence of a Storyteller early in gameplay to relieve her\ncharacter of a fear-related Derangement for the duration of that evening's\nplay. Derangements triggered by Chimerstry or Obtenebration are affected by\nthis use of Humanity, while Presence-spawned terrors are not\n.\nThis sort of expenditure of Humanity Traits should he played out .\nWhether a character confides in a trusted friend about his constant battle to\nwork through a Derangement, prays vociferously for strength, or displays the\nSt. Christopher medal that his mother gave him on her deathbed, there\nshould he some in-game action to demonstrate the expenditure of this very\nimportant Trait .\n• Threats to Life and Limb - Humanity Traits can also be used when\na character's \"fight or flight\" instinct is triggered . In a survival situation, a\nplayer can spend a Humanity Trait and add one to the Traits being put to the\ntest . This only works in life-threatening situations .\n• True Love - Assuming a ghoul has a True Love (Storytellers should\nknow about this sort of thing in advance ; making up the light of your life on\nthe spot tends to stretch credulity a hit), a Humanity Trait can be used as it\nis for Threats to Life and Limb if the loved one is in mortal danger .\nSimilarly, a Humanity Trait can be used in place of a regular Trait during\na character's initial bid if his loved one is at risk during the challenge . This\nis quite useful, particularly if the character no longer has an appropriate Trait\nto hid but is compelled to act anyway. A Humanity Trait used in this way is\nlost, regardless of the outcome of the challenge .\nLosing Humanity\nIf a ghoul enters a frenzy and harms or kills someone, a check must be\nmade to see if the character loses a Humanity Trait . (If no one is hurt, the\nghoul suffers no long-term scars from the frenzy .) If someone is indeed injured\nas a result of a ghoul's frenzy, the ghoul must win a Static Social Challenge\nagainst four Traits. If the ghoul wins the challenge, he is unaffected by his\nexperience and maintains all Humanity . If the ghoul loses, he acquires a\nDerangement (to be determined by the Storyteller) . He also loses a Humanity\nTrait, though not permanently .\nIn the event that the ghoul kills someone during frenzy, accidentally or\notherwise, an immediate challenge must he made against a Storyteller or\nNarrator. This takes the form of two Static Challenges, for which the ghoul\nmust bid a Humanity Trait . Loss of one challenge or a tie in both temporarily\n4 7\n\n\nI\nI\nlibel' c\nS Goal e5\ncosts the Trait that was hid and gives the ghoul a Derangement (Storyteller\nchoice). If the ghoul ties one test and loses the other, or loses both, he\npermanently loses the Humanity Trait he bid and acquires a Derangement\n.\nA ghoul can only permanently lose a Humanity Trait from frenzying if he\nkills someone . (This heinous act lowers the character's maximum Humanity\nby one Trait.) Under no other circumstances can a character lose Humanity\npermanently (allowing for Storyteller discretion- an exception can he made\nin the case of torturers, vivisectors and the like) . Humanity Traits lost\ntemporarily can be regained with experience and good roleplaying . Humanity\nTraits that are permanently lost cannot be restored under any normal\ncircumstances .\nOf course, if a ghoul kills someone during frenzy but both of his Static\nChallenges are successes, he loses no Humanity Traits and doesn't gain any\nDerangements .\nFor Example\nDana's character has a maximum of seven Humanity Traits. At\nthe moment she only has six (the result of using one earlier in the\nevening). However, she has just killed an innocent bystander while\nin the throes of a Frenzy. She immediately finds a Storyteller and\ntells him what happened .\nThe Storyteller conducts the mandatory Humanity check .\nDana announces that she's bidding her Humanity Trait Innocent ;\nthis will serve as the hid for both challenges . In the first challenge, the\nStoryteller comes up Rock while Dana comes up Scissors . The\nsecond attempt finds both Storyteller and Dana with Rock. Dana\nloses one challenge and ties the other, so permanently loses Inno-\ncent, a Trait that she can never regain . In addition, the Storyteller\nassigns Dana the Derangement : Undying Remorse, because her\ncharacter is so concerned with keeping her Humanity .\nFrom hereon, Dana can only have a maximum of six Humanity\nTraits. Her innocence (not to mention her Innocent) is lost forever .\nFrenzies aren't the only way to lose Humanity . Acts of outrageous or\nunnecessary cruelty, crimes or other immoral acts can all lead to the leaching\nof a ghoul's Humanity . On the following page is a chart of some actions that\ncan lead to Humanity loss, and the penalties associated with them .\n\n\nScale of Wrongdoing, Challenges and Penalties\nPurposely inflicting\nStatic vs. 4 Soc\ninjury\nLoss of Humanity Trait bid,\ncan be bought back with expe-\nrience points.\nTheft and robbery\nStatic v\n5 Soc .\nLoss of Humanity Trait bid,\ncan be bought back with ex-\nperience points .\nUnreasoning\ndestruction\nStatic vs . 6 Soc\n.\nLoss of Humanity Trait bid,\nin be bought back with expe-\nrience points .\nAccidental killing\ntatic\nLoss of one challenge or tie of\nboth; loss of Humanity Trait\nbid (to be gained hack with\nes.perience), and gain Derange-\ni vent of Storyteller choice .

Humanity Traits lost\nare permanent, subtracted\nfrom current maximum of Hu\n-manity Traits available to the\ncharacter .\nCrime\nChallenge\nPotential Penalty\n\n\nRoleplaying\nRemember, losing Humanity is a terrible thing . The erosion of a ghoul's\nsoul profoundly affects the character's personality. The more Humanity a\nghoul loses, the closer she comes to her Regnant's Beast, the harder it becomes\nfor her to break her Bond, the more she retreats from human society and the\nless useful she becomes to her Regnant. Characters who lose Humanity tend\nto be cynical, jaded and vicious ; the loss of even one Trait can have a\nnoticeable effect on long-established behavior patterns .\nRegaining Humanity\nRegaining Humanity Traits depends on how you lost them. Humanity\nspent to power Numina, save a loved one, counteract a fear, or face a life-\nthreatening situation can be regained in time (in other words, by the next\nevent all Traits spent this way return) . Ghouls who are in a hurry or in\ndesperate need can also spend a Willpower Trait to regain a Humanity Trait\n.\nHumanity Traits lost in a Humanity test may be bought back with\nexperience points (to the ghoul's current rating), unless those Traits were lost\npermanently . Humanity Traits lost permanently can only be regained through\nextraordinary penance, decreed by a Storyteller and roleplayed out over a\nseries of sessions . Humanity lost should never be returned lightly .\nStorytellers should take note of characters who constantly lose and\nregain Humanity Traits . If this situation becomes chronic, the Storyteller\nmay declare that the character has become jaded, and may no longer attempt\nto regain Humanity Traits that have been lost .\n\n\nAbilities\nThe Abilities in this section are either new or restated from previous\nhooks to suit the lifestyle and needs of a ghoul . They can be used by any sort\nof ghoul, whether Hunter, Servior or revenant . Ghouls may take these\nAbilities multiple times to demonstrate increased expertise . Thus, a ghoul\nwith Steward x 1 may be able to run his Regnant's haven for a night or two,\nbut a ghoul with Steward x 4 could fend off all manner of outside threats to his\nsleeping Regnant by using the haven's defenses to their utmost potential\n.\nAnimal Affinity\nAnimal Affinity describes how well a ghoul relates o normal, nonghoul\nanimals. In addition to making the ghoul with this Ability inoffensive to\nanimals (a la Animalism), the Ability imparts a degree of empathy with the\nanimal condition. Ghouls who train animals should not be without Animal\nAffinity .\nAnimal Affinity also grants some small measure of control over creatures .\nWhen a ghoul with Animal Affinity makes a command or request of an animal,\nthe creature must make a Mental Challenge to understand and carry out the\norder . As with Animal Ken, the difficulty of the test is based on the animal's\nlevel of domestication and the complexity of the task\n.\nThe character need only make a Static Challenge to calm an injured,\nattacking or frightened animal .\nBlood Lore\nThis Ability indicates your knowledge of the Blood Bond . You know that\nyou are Bound, you know that your feelings for your Regnant are false, and you\nmay have some idea of how to break the Bond . Ghouls with this Ability have\nthe potential to destroy the unlives of their Regnants . To learn this Ability,\nspeak with your Storyteller to see if it is appropriate for your character .\nHaven Scouting\nThis Ability is invaluable o both Servitors and Hunters . This is the\ncapacity to find a new haven for your Regnant if he needs one fast, or to sniff\nout likely places where a vampire might have gone o ground for the day\n.\nAlmost all applications of Haven Scouting require Mental Challenges, with\nthe difficulty determined by either the ghoul's time remaining before dawn\nor his familiarity with his quarry .\nHunter Lore\nClosely related to Lupine Lore, this shows your knowledge of different\ntypes of Hunters (and not just ghouled ones), their reputations and some of\ntheir tactics . This can help you protect your Regnant or yourself. Gaining\n\n\nL\n52\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nN\ninformation on a Hunter works in the same way that it does for Lupine Lore .\nHowever, researching a Hunter's tactics or abilities requires a Mental Chal-\nlenge . Obviously the difficulty of the challenge depends on the type of\ninformation being sought .\nKindred Lore\nThis is your familiarity with your Regnant's lineage and the mysteries\nshrouding her unnatural evolution . This Ability can aid you greatly in either\nblackmailing your Regnant or sweet-talking her into cutting you a little slack\n.\nIn addition, this Ability gives you accurate information on what does and\ndoesn't kill vampires, enabling you to separate fact from myth\n.\nLupine Lore\nWell, you know there are vampires out there, so why not believe in\nwerewolves, too? You know they're in the woods, you may know how much\nthey hate vampires, and you definitely know how much vampires hate them\n.\nWith enough experience invested in this Ability, you may even discover\nwhere the local Lupine pack hangs out . The use of this Ability requires a\nSocial Challenge with the difficulty directly affected by the Rank and\nRenown of the werewolf in question, or by the relative secrecy of the meeting\nplace .\nMasquerade\nThis Ability can he a real icebreaker at parties, though not always a good\none unless you're in with a gaggle of good-humored Malkavians . This Ability\nallows you to pass for a vampire - an especially useful skill for a Hunter.\nThere's nothing like being able to walk into a city and he presented to the\nprince, particularly when you intend to jam a sharpened croquet post through\nhis wishbone .\nThis Ability allows a single re-test on Aura Perceptions performed against\nghouls who possess it . It does not, however, fool the Garou Gift : Sense Wyrm .\nMedical Knowledge\nYou know a great deal about medical procedures, just as the name\nsuggests. This Ability can he invaluable to a ghoul, as the mostly living have\nonly limited use of blood to heal their wounds . Medical Knowledge also allows\na character to perform medical procedures on other ghouls and living\ncreatures with similar physiologies (humans - yes; Garou in Crinos form -\nno). This can halt a bleeding character's decline of Health Levels, or stabilize\na Dying character at Incapacitated . Multiple Traits of Medical Knowledge\nallow a character to stabilize a Dying character for up to an hour before she\nneeds to go to a hospital .\n\n\n 1 1 1 1 1 1\nI\nLiap1er 3 hoari\ner ~ ation\n∎\nTo accomplish any of these feats, a ghoul must make a Static Mental\nChallenge against six Traits . The challenge should become more difficult\naccording to the number and severity of injuries the ghoul is attempting to\nheal .\nMedical Knowledge can also be extended to other uses . Ghouls with this\nAbility can assess the effects of drugs and dosages, ascertain causes of death,\ndiagnose diseases and otherwise put their knowledge of how human anatomy\nworks to good use .\nSniping\nGhouls with this Ability are so in tune with vampires that they can pick\none out in a crowd. They can instinctively spot the predator . Working almost\nlike a psychic power, this is really more of a subconscious assessment of the\nhallmarks of vampires .\nSniping basically grants a ghoul a very specific sort of Aura Perception . By\nusing Sniping, a ghoul can enter a Social Challenge with a single target . If the\nghoul wins, he may ask if his target is a vampire or not . The target cannot lie\nin response to this question, and even Mask of 1000 Faces cannot hide a\nvampire from a talented ghoul who knows Sniping.\nSteward\nEvery vampire should be so lucky or intelligent as to have a ghoul with\nthis Ability . Steward demonstrates a ghoul's grasp of his Regnant's affairs, day-\nor nighttime. A ghoul with this Ability can run every aspect of his Regnant's\nhaven . This Ability is useful for defending the haven against invaders, but it\ncan also be brought to bear should a ghoul decide to defect from his Regnant's\nservice . Not only is a good Steward fully stocked with blackmail material on\nhis Regnant, but he just might know her haven better than she does.\nBlood Use\nFor the blood is the life .\n- Deuteronomy, 12 :23\nUnlike mortals, ghouls begin play with four Blood Traits . This includes\nthe three normal ones that humans have, plus one Trait's worth of vampiric\nblood . Ghouls can actually have up to six Blood Traits (three human, three\nvampiric) in their systems at any given time, but any more causes harm at the\nrate of one Health Level per additional Blood Trait\n.\nUnlike vampires, ghouls do not need blood to exist, save for those ghouls\nwho have exceeded what their natural life spans would have been . Ghouls can\nuse blood to heal, though only nonaggravated wounds . Aggravated damage,\ncaused by things such as fire, Garou claws and teeth, vampire fangs and claws,\n\n\nor weapons treated with blood from Quietus, can only be healed with the\npassage of time .\nGhouls are a hit more fragile than vampires, however, and ghouls who are\ndown by two or more Health Levels are in serious danger . In addition, a ghoul\nwho empties his Blood Pool must win a Static Challenge against six Physical\nTraits or die from blood loss . If the ghoul wins, enough vampire blood remains\nin his system o allow him to cling o life, however feebly\n.\nHealth\nA sound mind in a sound body, is a short but full description of a happy state\nin this world-\n- John Locke, Some Thoughts Concerning Education\nAs ghouls are still to some extent human, Health Levels work differently\nfor them than for vampires. For a ghoul, the four Health Levels below Healthy\nare Bruised, Wounded, Incapacitated and Dying . There is no Torpor for a\nghoul; once her heart stops she is dead . An Incapacitated ghoul is not\nunconscious, however . She simply may not engage in any challenges, and is\ncompletely at the mercy of those around her .\nAs their hearts still pump, ghouls also have the unfortunate problem of\nbleeding when wounded . A ghoul who is Wounded will, after 10 minutes\nwithout medical attention, lose a Blood Trait and slip down to Incapacitated .\nAn Incapacitated ghoul, if not treated within 10 minutes, will lose another\nBlood Trait and slip down to Dying . Dying ghouls will lose a Blood Trait every\n10 minutes until they are tapped out ; at this point death is the likely result .\n\n\ni\ni\nC +apler 3 Oiuaekr Creut on\nThe only other one is the Embrace, but players are advised not to count on\nthis sort of rescue .\nBleeding can be stopped with a minimum of medical attention . Any\ncharacter with medicine-related Abilities can tend to an injured ghoul and\nstop the downward spiral of blood loss . The character does this by announcing\nthat she is attempting to stop the bleeding, and then by winning or tying a\nStatic Mental Challenge . However, a ghoul who is bleeding to death and is\nalready Incapacitated (or worse) cannot treat herself. As the ghoul cannot\nparticipate in a challenge, it is impossible for her to perform the Static Mental\nChallenge and stop her own bleeding .\nBleeding from aggravated wounds can also he stopped in this manner, but\nthe structural damage caused by the wound can only be healed with intense\nmedical attention (read : hospitalization) . Ghouls heal one Level of aggra-\nvated damage per game session if they spend their downtime receiving medical\ncare . Otherwise, Storyteller discretion is advised .\nAging\nAge doth not rectify, but incurvate our natures, turning had dispositions into\nworser habits .\n- Sir Thomas Browne, Religio Medici\nThe revenant families aside, ghouldom is not a permanent state . Ghouls\nwill revert to true humanity after 30 days without a Trait's worth of vampire\nblood. This time limit is absolute, and the switchover is instantaneous . A\nghoul who reverts to her mortal state loses any additional Traits related to her\nghouling, not to mention all of her Disciplines . If she becomes a ghoul again,\nthe Traits are returned but the highest level attained in each Discipline is lost\n(you always retain the most basic level of any Discipline, though) . Nor are lost\nHumanity Traits regained ; the character has seen too much to return to\ninnocence .\nIn addition, vampire blood keeps ghouls young . If a ghoul with under a\nhundred years of service stops receiving vitae, he begins to age normally from\nthat point onward . Ghouls who have been in their current states for more\nthan a century face a slightly different problem . These old-timers begin to age\nat an advanced rate, effectively 10 or more times normal . In game terms, for\nevery hour past deadline, an aged ex-ghoul must win a Static Physical\nChallenge against 10 Traits . If she ties or loses, she drops one Health Level\n(though without bleeding), loses a Physical Trait and gains a Negative\nPhysical Trait (Storyteller's choice) . The Trait changes are permanent, even\nif the character does later manage to acquire vampire blood again .\nCharacters who lose and regain their not-quite-human status cease to age\nthe moment they become ghouls again . The restored ghouls do not grow more\nyouthful with new infusions of vitae . A ghoul's existence is a holding action\nagainst time, and nothing more .\n\n\nI\n4\n56 VI\nif\nIf a character, against all logic, somehow manages to keep poking along\nwithout vampire blood for an extended period of time, Storytellers should feel\nfree to intercede and help nature take its course .\nAnother Vampire Trait\nOne of the more remarkable things about ghouls is their ability to frenzy .\nGhoul frenzies are more rare than their vampiric counterparts, usually only\noccurring when a ghoul faces imminent destruction . However, when Hu-\nmanity fails, the Beast, the overwhelming desire to survive, takes over .\nfrenzies can also be brought on by incredible amounts of stress, triggered\nDerangements or by the Animalism Discipline .\nWhen a ghoul is in a situation in which her Humanity cannot help her\nescape, and all of her Willpower is gone, she may declare that she is in frenzy .\nGhoul Frenzy works much like vampiric frenzy . The ghoul becomes violent\nand attacks blindly in desperate need to escape . While in frenzy, a ghoul may\nignore damage penalties to the point of death, but she cannot use blood to\nheal and is still susceptible to blood loss . Any damage done to a ghoul past\nDying will kill her .\nDerangements can also trigger frenzy in a ghoul . A ghoul under the\ninfluence of her Derangement(s), or who is being pressured about them by\nanother character, may slide into a frenzy as a form of self-defense . In this case,\nthe ghoul makes a Static Mental Challenge against 10 Traits . If she ties or\nfails, she goes into frenzy .\nGhouls do not gain Beast Traits from frenzying . If a ghoul commits a\nheinous act while frenzying, a check must be made to see if the character loses\na Humanity Trait. However, if the frenzy passes without anything untoward\nhappening, there is no need to check for Humanity loss .\nThe Blood Bond\ni\ni\nWhen love is repressed, hate takes its place .\n- Havelock Ellis, On Life and Sex : Essays of Love and Virtue\nThe third time is a charm when it comes to ingesting vampire blood\n;\nthat's how many sips it takes to Blood Bond someone . The Bond is henceforth\nat the absolute center of a ghoul's life . The more thoroughly he is tied to his\nRegnant, the more perfect his Regnant will appear to him and the more\nimportant (or pleasurable) serving her becomes . As the Bond strengthens,\nthe ghoul finds himself excusing his Regnant's flaws, rationalizing her\ntyrannical behavior, and generally surrendering to the overwhelming emo-\ntional impact of the vitae .\nOf course, a ghoul is still human, and may know or guess that his feelings\nare coerced . However, this is not sufficient impetus to allow a ghoul to break\nthe Bond . Think about it this way: Lovers have their quarrels, and best friends\ni\ni\ni\ni\nTiber c es Goules\n\n\nI\ni\nI\nI\nI\ncan become disgusted with their counterparts' actions, but in most cases they\nare apt to forgive or withhold judgment because it's their lover or best friend\n.\nIt works the same way with the Bond .\nBound ghouls are easier to Dominate and coerce than are unbound\nghouls, or even normal humans- Once a vampire has Bound a ghoul to her,\nshe need no longer make eye contact to use Dominate on the hapless Thrall\n.\nIn addition, many contests between Regnant and Thrall the vampire wins\nall ties . However, these effects are Regnant-specific ; a ghoul Bound to the\nlocal Tremere elder won't necessarily be easy for another Ventrue to Domi-\nnate .\nThe saving grace that ghouls have in their Blood Bonds is the fact that\ntheir still-human metabolisms produce plenty of fresh, untainted blood with\nwhich to replenish their systems . If a Regnant doesn't feed a Bound ghoul at\nleast once a year, the Bond will fade-\nBreaking the Bond\nThe more violent the love, the more violent the anger\n.\n- Burmese proverb\nThe ease of breaking from a Bond often has to do with an individual\nghoul's Derangements and Nature . A Loner has a much better chance of\nbreaking his chains than does a Sycophant. Meanwhile, someone who slips\ninto childlike behavior during Derangement spells may cling to her Regnant\nas a child might an abusive parent .\n57\n\n\nI\nThere are no set rules for breaking a Blood Bond ; each ghoul must decide\nfor herself how to become free . Most ghouls, unless mistreated severely, won't\nwant to break their Bonds . Also consider that a Bound ghoul has a steady\nsource of vitae ; ghouls on the loose don't necessarily know where their next\nmetaphysical meals are coming from. Only drastic behavior on the part of a\nRegnant should motivate a ghoul to contemplate freedom .\nIf a ghoul character has a sadistic or cruel Regnant (providing, of course,\nthat the ghoul doesn't like that kind of treatment), the player should keep a\nStoryteller informed of what's going on. In time, and with Storyteller\npermission, the ghoul may be able to break free of the vampire's influence .\nThe escape will not be easy . In fact it should be the single-most-difficult thing\nthe character experiences in the course of the game . There is a great\nemotional struggle between the imposed love of the Bond and the character's\nown sense of self. Most ghouls are incapable of winning that battle .\nTime can also sever the Bond, but a year without blood will almost\ncertainly kill old ghouls ; the process calls for caution and a backup source of\nvitae. In addition, without vitae, a ghoul is just a normal human being and,\nin many cases, a target . Vampirism, like murder, should have no witnesses,\nand a ghoul who walks away from the Bond is a threat to the Masquerade\n.\nEmbracing a Ghoul\nEven as love crowns you shall he crucify you,\neven as he is for your growth so is he for your pruning .\n- Kahlil Gibran, The Prophet\nSometimes the creation of a ghoul is the equivalent of a test drive for a\nvampire. Creating a ghoul enables him to see how well a potential childe\nmight work out . Would-be sires can keep an eye on their ghoul prospects and\ncome to decisions at their leisure . A ghoul character who is observed in this\nfashion could remain a ghoul for any length of time, ranging from a month to\na decade to forever if the vampire decides that she is unsuitable for elevation\n.\nOn the other hand, there are those vampires who kill their failed would-be\nprogeny . The possible reward in a situation like this is great, but so is the risk .\nIf a Regnant decides to take a drastic step with her ghoul and Embrace\nhim, the process functions largely like the Embrace of a mortal . Embraced\nghouls retain all of their previously learned Disciplines, and acquire those\nTraits that go into making a vampire . They do, however, lose all of their\nHumanity Traits and any Numina they might have possessed .\n(Note : Ghouls who are Embraced do not receive a complete set of new\nDisciplines on top of the ones they already possess . Instead, those Disciplines\nalready learned go toward rounding out the new vampire's initial allotment .)\n\n\n I Ch\n1er 3 l header Creation\nWillpower\nThe good or ill of man lies within his own will .\n- Epictetus, Discourses\nIn times of desperation and strife, people have been known to do things\nthat would normally be impossible . These superhuman efforts are said to he\nthe product of chemistry, but in the World of Darkness this capacity is\nrepresented by Willpower. One of a ghoul's few weapons against the en-\ncroaching inhumanity of the World of Darkness, Willpower wraps up her\ndesire to live and her sense of self into a single package . It is what makes\nBonding ghouls necessary, and also makes it possible to throw off the Blood\nBond .\nGhouls start with a single Willpower Trait . Later, they can buy up to six\nduring the course of the game. Willpower Traits can he used for multiple\nthings :\n• A ghoul can spend a Willpower Trait to negate instances of frenzy .\n• Willpower can bring a ghoul back up to full in one Attribute category\n(Physical, Mental or Social)\n.\n• Willpower can also be used to ignore the effects of any wounds, up to\nand including Incapacitation, for the duration of one challenge . However, no\napplication of Willpower is capable of healing a character .\n• A Willpower Trait can he spent to stave off incipient death for 15\nminutes, assuming nothing else is done to send the character further on his\nway to the grave .\n• A Willpower Trait can he expended to ignore the effects of any one\nMental or Social Challenge, including ones from a ghoul's Regnant, if and\nonly if the effects of the challenge would cause the ghoul to perform an action\nthat would be deeply at odds with her Nature or personal ethics .\nKeep in mind that once a Willpower Trait is gone, it is unavailable until\nthe end of a story . At that time, a ghoul regains all the Willpower he used . A\nNarrator or Storyteller can grant Willpower more frequently to players who\nexhibit exceptional roleplaying or great improvement in their roleplaying\nstyle, but such rewards should be handed out infrequently at best .\n 1\n59\n\n\n \nI I I I I I\n i\ni\ni\ni\ni i I\nTiber\nt es Gc)u es\nI\n ∎\nGhoul Merits and Flaws\nThe sunshine, too light, the ocean too wide,\nI'm sick of your cliche,\nThe sky is kind, love is blind,\nYou can't let go of the lost pain .\n- Cibo Matto, \" Le Pain Perdu\"\nPsychological\nAware of False Love: (2 Trait Merit)\nGhouls possessing this Merit are aware of the nature of the Blood Bond .\nThey know that what they feel for their Regnants is not natural, and are\ntherefore more capable when dealing with their feelings\n.\nIf you have this Merit, your Regnant is two Traits down when attempting\nto coerce or Dominate you in any way .\nCannibalism: (3 Trait Flaw)\nThe first taste of your Regnant's blood turned you on to the taste of raw\nflesh. Now you think that human tartare is the only way to go . This Flaw can\nget so demanding that you might scour the streets for the \"other\" white meat .\nThe whole thing becomes a brutal obsession, and you settle for nothing less\nthan the taste of human . Cows, pigs, chickens - they're all safe from you . It's\nhomo sapiens a la mode that satisfies your craving, and if you can't get a fix you\njust might go mad . . . .\nOstentatious Toady: (3 Trait Flaw)\nYou have thrived since your Regnant first gave you her blood . The power\nshe grants you is apparent in your unnatural strength, toughness and speed .\nThe only problem (and you'd never admit it) is the fact that you know you\nwould he nothing without the blood . Your Regnant is the only thing that\nmakes you truly alive . As a result, you constantly try to impress her, even if\nthe attempt means risking your life . You must spend a Willpower Trait\nwhenever you're faced with a particularly juicy chance to show off for your\nRegnant. For example, if your Regnant mentions that she wishes for a\npompous Ventrue primogen to he run over with a steamroller, you might dial\nup construction-equipment companies and inquire about rentals .\nSqueamish: (2 Trait Flaw)\nWhen your Regnant first made you into a ghoul, you were nearly ill . How\ncould she make you drink her blood? You can't deny the tremendous\nadvantages that her vitae (That sounds better now, doesn't it? We'll call it vitae,\n\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nCiapier 3 ajarader Crei& n\nand that way we can pretend it's not blood.) has provided, but you must spend\na Willpower Trait every time you drink . If faced with a gruesome scene\n(combat doesn't count, unless people are really messy), you must either leave\nimmediately or win a Static Challenge to bear the sight of the gore . If the\nchallenge is lost, you may still stay, but feel extremely ill . To reflect this\nqueasiness, you lose two Physical Traits (you can regain them with one\nWillpower Trait) and gain the Negative Trait : Witless for the duration of the\nscene .\nSwept Away: (2 Trait Flaw)\nAh, the beauty of it all! After you got over the initial shock of your\nRegnant's true nature, you were enthralled by the romance and heartbreaking\ntragedy of vampirism . You are needed, loved, provided for- how wonderful!\nA ghoul who is Swept Away basically blinds himself to the nature of his\nrelationship with his Regnant . His master may be cruel or abusive, but in the\nend it doesn't matter. The ghoul sees her only through rose-colored glasses .\nA character with this Flaw is down two Traits when his Regnant attempts to\nDominate him .\nMental\nInsomnia: (2 Trait Flaw)\nTry as you might, much-needed sleep never comes to you . This problem\nhas been nagging at you since the trauma of your first taste of vitae, and the\nfalling of the scales from your eyes . The best you can manage is a fitful hour\nof dozing or a catnap here or there . It wouldn't he so had if you didn't need the\nrest so badly - lack of sleep is just wearing you down .\nTo reflect the effects of your affliction, you start every event at full Traits\n.\nAt the halfway point of the game, however, your current Mental, Physical and\nSocial Trait ratings all decrease by one .\nWell Rested : (I Trait Merit)\nYou need very little sleep . As few as three hours out of a full 24 will\nnormally let you wake up brighteyed and bushytailed (so to speak) . This can\ngreatly aid your Regnant by allowing you to help her all night and for part of\nthe day, as well as allowing you to live your own life .\nSupernatural\nAnimal Friendship: (2 Trait Merit)\nNot only do animals find you inoffensive, they actively like you . You\nhave an extraordinary rapport with animals that convinces them to come\nwhen called and occasionally aid you at your request .

However, you must have a mentor to teach\nyou these new powers . Otherwise, all the talent in the world won't help you\npick up Auspex .\nThe price for each level of any new Discipline is exactly the same as if a\nghoul were a vampire character buying an out-of-clan Discipline. Thus, if a\nghoul were to try to learn the basic level of Auspex (Heightened Senses), she\nwould have to hunt up a willing teacher and spend five experience points .\nNote : Protean and Thaumaturgy are the only two Disciplines that may not\nhe learned with this Merit .\nLight Sensitivity: (3 Trait Flaw)\nThe Beast is strong in your Regnant's blood, strong enough to cause you\nproblems in daylight . You can bear only short jaunts into the sunlit world, and\neven then you must cover up and wear sunglasses . Those same sunglasses must\nhe worn indoors in well-lit spaces to avoid the excruciating pain that bright\nlight causes you . You have no trouble with moonlight, and don't need\nsunglasses after sunset unless you go somewhere well lit (like a mall or a\nnighttime baseball game) . Prolonged exposure (10 minutes) to direct sun-\nlight causes you normal damage at the same rate at which a vampire takes\naggravated damage .\nI\nPoaching Ghouls\nI\nVampires want the best of anything, including ghouls . So\nif a vampire sees that another of his kind has a desirable or useful\nghoul, he may decide to make that ghoul his own. This practice\nis called \"poaching,\" and is frowned on by the Camarilla . Of\ncourse, the ones doing the frowning are generally the ones who\nhave the most talented ghouls (and therefore the most desirable\nto poachers) .\nSetites make a special habit of stealing others' ghouls, but\nthe practice is not restricted to them . It's just that poaching is\neasy for them to pull off .\n0\n1\n1\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n\n∎\n \nI I\n∎\nThin Blooded Regnant : (4 Trait Flaw)\nYour Regnant has weak blood, which is both a blessing and curse . Power-\nwise she's closer to ghoul level than any vampire has a right to he . Unfortunately,\nthis doesn't do you any good . You cannot spend any\nof your blood on\nDisciplines. Worse still, you need your Regnant's blood more often because\nit just barely sustains your immortality . If you don't have her blood every\nweek, you run the risk ofreverting back to full mortality . Other vampires will\nalso actively seek to steal (or \"poach\") ghouls who have this Flaw\n.\nUnbondable : (3 point Merit)\nThis Merit is the ace up many a ghoul's sleeve. You cannot he Bound and\nare therefore are immune to the disadvantages of the condition . However,\nyou have to keep this a secret from your \"Regnant,\" or he might be disinclined\nto retain you .\nI\nI\nI\nKindred Ties\nBlackmail Material: (1-3 Trait Merit)\nYou have somehow garnered very embarrassing information on a vam-\npire of indeterminate Status . The Status of your victim and juiciness of the\ninformation depend on how many points you spend on the Merit and on the\nimagination of your Storyteller- Of course, you can always suggest some-\nthing . . . .\nClan Weakness: (3 Trait Flaw)\nPerhaps your Regnant's blood is particularly potent, or maybe there's\nmore darkness in your soul than you realized . At any rate, you have taken on\nthe clan weakness of the vampire to whom you are Blood Bound . For example,\nVentrue ghouls find they gain no benefits from the blood of any other clan,\nand Assamite ghouls take damage from other clans' blood .\nRevenants may not take this Flaw .\nPrestigious Regnant: (I Trait Merit)\nYour Regnant has or had great Status in the sect, and this has accorded\nyou a peculiar honor . Most treat you respectfully, ghoul or not . This prestige\ncan aid you greatly when you deal with vampires acquainted with your\nRegnant . As long as she's around, you're in the clear. If something were to\nhappen to you, you can rest assured one of your Regnant's allies would take\ncare of - or avenge - you .\nSabbat ghouls may take this Merit if they can find sufficient justification\nfor doing so . However, situations in which Prestigious Regnant come into play\nfor a Sabbat ghoul are few and far between .\n63\n1\n\n\n64\nSugar Daddy : (I Trait Merit)\nA vampire is quite interested in you . Perhaps it's for the information you\ncan provide him on your Regnant, or maybe he just likes your company\n.\nWhatever the reason, you've been pragmatic enough to keep channels to him\nopen . If you need help, he may provide you with blood and a limited amount\nof other resources .\nThe main idea behind this Merit is survival, pure and simple . After all,\nin the World of Darkness, nothing is a sure thing . Your secret friend is\ninsurance against your Regnant and other vampiric machinations .\nTwisted Upbringing: (I Trait Flaw)\nYour Regnant has taught you all the wrong things about vampire society\nout ofthe goodness of her little black heart. Whether she told you that all the\nlegends about garlic and running water are true or convinced you that she and\nall other vampires are extraterrestrials, the fact is that you bought it, lock,\nstock and barrel. These false ideas are bound to get you into trouble, and you\nwill not believe any attempts to set you straight . Over time you can learn the\ntruth and buy off this Flaw, but not until a Storyteller grants you permission .\nWorld of Darkness Ties\nGarou Ally: (2 Trait Merit)\nAlthough both vampire and Garou societies frown on friendly interac-\ntion, exceptions can and do happen . That doesn't mean the local powers that\nhe approve of such alliances ; if your friendship were unmasked, the conse-\nquences could he grave for you and your furry friend . Whether you are Kinfolk\nor the two of you were old friends before either knew anything about the\nWyrm or Caine, your friendship has held through all adversity . You have the\nright to call on your friend if you need help, and she has the right to call on\nyou in return . In most cases, the Storyteller should create the allied character .\nPhysical\nDamned Visage: (I Trait Merit)\nYou have the uncanny ability to appear as one of the undead . Your skin\nis pale, your breathing is indiscernible, your hands are ice-cold, and your\nblinking appears practiced and unnatural . While you can't stop your heart\nfrom heating, you can spend a Blood Trait to slow your pulse to the point\nwhere it's not discernible . The only drawback to this Merit is the risk you run\noffooling a Hunter so well that he might try to stake you . On the other hand,\nif somebody leaves you out to greet the sun, you can laugh all the way home\n.\n\n\nEfficient Digestion : (3 Trait Merit)\nYou are able to go without vampire blood longer than most ghouls\n. In\nfact, you have experimented and found that you can go for two\nmonths\nwithout a drop of the good stuff. You also seem to benefit from the experience\nof feeding from your Regnant more than other ghouls do . Every two Blood\nTraits he gives you increases your Blood Pool by three (round fractions down)\n.\nInefficient Digestion: (3 Trait Flaw)\nYou need twice as much blood as other ghouls ; each Blood Trait Your\nRegnant grants you only counts for half . If she gives you four, you only receive\ntwo. Halves are rounded down, so gulping down one Blood Trait has no effect\non you whatsoever .\nLow Pain Threshold : (2 Trait Flaw)\nYou hate pain and cannot understand how your Regnant hears biting her\nwrist to give you blood . You always think to yourself, \"Oh, how that must\nhurt!\" Indeed, the sympathy pain you feel ruins your enjoyment of the vitae .\nYou don't like to see anything or anyone hurt . Most important, however, is\nthe fact that you don't like seeing yourself hurt . Resistance to pain is not your\nforte, and the slightest amount of agony sends you into a panic or a fainting\nfit. While normal injuries do not do you any additional physical damage, the\nsheer psychological impact has a devastating effect . You will do anything to\nmake pain stop, ranging from overdosing on painkillers to spilling all of your\nRegnant's secrets .\n\n\ntom/\ne\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nTiber t us '(icules\n∎ \n∎\nIf you are subjected to threats of bodily harm, you gain the Negative\nTrait: Submissive for the remainder of the evening . If somebody actually\nattempts to hurt you, you either cower or flee in terror . If you can't get away,\nbeg for mercy and debase yourself in any way in order to keep yourself from\ngetting hurt. Once safely away from the person who threatened you, you do\nyour best to never, ever be near him again, to the point of avoiding any room\nhe occupies .\nUnnatural Appearance: (2 Trait Flaw)\nYou are marked for life, whether your Regnant is a Tzimisce or vitae made\nthe Beast manifest in your appearance. The unnatural aspect of your appear-\nance could be an animal feature, an odd vampiric pallor to your skin, or even\nsomething inhuman in the way you move .\nWhen afflicted with this Flaw, you are down two Traits in any Social\nChallenge concerning your appearance . In addition, working with the\nhuman population at large is nigh impossible . You must shroud yourself\nwhenever you go out in public, and relations with your human friends must\nbe completely broken off. Nosferatu and Gangrel ghouls may not take this\nFlaw if they already have the Flaw : Clan Weakness .\nVitae Sink: (2 Trait Flaw)\nYou need your Regnant's blood, and you need it often . It seems you can't\ngo for longer than two weeks without it or you revert back to human state . If\nyou have been a ghoul for over a century, this Flaw can be downright deadly\n.\nDerangements\nSanity is a madness put to good uses ; waking life is a dream controlled .\n- George Santayana, Interpretations of Poetry and Religion\nA ghoul's initiation into the supernatural can be severely damaging to\nher psyche . Vampires are legends made real, nightmares come to horrible life .\nThe great majority of those given this burdensome insight buckle under its\nweight, and consequently gain mental afflictions called Derangements\n.\nNot every ghoul or vampire begins play with a Derangement, but you may\ntake one at character creation if it suits your ghoul's concept . If your\ncharacter's Regnant is a Malkavian, your character probably starts out with\nat least one Derangement, and may gain more as time passes. Ghouls also face\nsituations that induce Derangements . Just remember that most Derange-\nments are survival mechanisms that the subconscious creates to protect the\nconscious from horrid reality .\nBelow are new Derangements for ghouls, as well as some familiar ones\nthat have been modified for ghoul purposes . Others may be found in Laws of\nthe Night, starting on page 44 .\n66\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\n\nAmnesia\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n0hapler 3\narA-\n1\nCPe%lh()n\nIn highly traumatic situations, you sometimes forget who or even what\nyou are. This typically occurs when you come face to face with your situation\nas a ghoul, or with the nightly reality of the World of Darkness . You could\nforget the details of the situation that triggered this response, or you could\nforget anything from the evening's events to your name or identity . When you\nare confronted by events or situations that threaten to remind you of your\npast, you may react violently, pass out or go into a catatonic state rather than\nlet those memories rush back .\nIf you are in an incredibly stressful situation, you must perform a Static\nMental Challenge against seven Traits . If you fail, you forget who you are and\nwhat you are doing there . Other memories can be lost at Storyteller discre-\ntion .\nBlood Thirst\nYou crave the blood your Regnant gave you at the very beginning of your\nghoulish existence. You will do anything to keep receiving it. You want what\nyou need and then some - this once-a-month feeding schedule is for the\nbirds. You will go to great lengths to get vitae, doing anything from lying to\nyour Regnant about your use of blood, to actively hunting other vampires for\nthe blood they possess . Even when you know drinking too much will cause you\nharm, you cannot help but pursue the intoxicating elixir . When your Regnant\nfeeds you, you are always tempted to drink all that she has . Whenever you feed\ndirectly from your Regnant, you must test for Frenzy to avoid attempting to\ndrain her completely .\nCompulsive Lying\nYou were in New York with a friend once - his name isn't important -\nand you managed to convince this car dealer (he was pretty hard up to make\na sale) to sell you his brand-new Dodge Viper for, like, a thousand dollars .\nWhat a great deal! He didn't even charge tax or have you go through the\npaperwork . He did all that himself. Oh, you want to see the car? Well . . . it's\nbeing repainted . It was this nasty shade of lime green . You say Vipers don't\ncome in green? Well, this one was a special edition, signed by the president\nof the company. What was his name? Well, the signature wasn't very legible\n- you know how big businessmen are . . . .\nWhen this Derangement is triggered, you must spend Willpower to avoid\n10 full minutes of prevarication. The lies that you spout can be as subtle or\noutrageous as you wish . However, the point is that you have a compulsive\nneed to obscure the truth . \"Lies\" that are just a way of rephrasing the truth (for\nexample, \"Oh, I'd never be interested in joining your little cabal . Nope, nope,\nnope,\" while making it very clear that you are interested) are directly counter\nto the spirit of the Derangement, and hence are forbidden .\nIn other words, it's cheating . Don't do it .\n\n\nI\nr-^\nDelusional Identity\nWhen things get particularly hard to deal with, you often revert to\nsomeone you can trust to do a better job than you can . This new personality\nis someone efficient, someone stalwart, someone historic - like General\nPatton or Florence Nightingale . Don't worry if nobody believes you when you\nintroduce yourself; nobody ever believes it when they meet a celebrity . Get\nthe job at hand done quickly, efficiently and with enough zest to make people\nknow it really was you who did it .\nPsychological Note\nU\nDelusional Identities often derive from feelings of complete\nhopelessness and despair, and can reflect a ghoul's deepest terrors\n.\nIn moments of stress or fear, the ghoul's real personality retreats\nand is replaced by an identity (with the same Traits, of course) that\nis based on the ghoul's concept of competence . This other self can\nhe a historical, fictional or composite character . However, Delu-\nsional Identities that duplicate other characters already in gameplay\nare not allowed .\n∎ ~ \n∎\nDipsomania\nDipsomania is the urge to drink yourself into an absolute stupor when the\ngoing gets tough (or even mildly difficult) . Such a Derangement can destroy\nthe trust that others place in you, and limits your effectiveness in certain\nsituations. This weakness, should it become known, could he used as a weapon\nagainst you (say, by a rival who offers you drinks to sidetrack you from an\nimportant mission) . If this Derangement comes over you at an event, you are\nimmediately affected by the Negative Trait : Witless .\nWhether or not you are a \"happy drunk,\" you are unsightly in this state\n.\nYou stagger about, weave as you walk, and say all the wrong things . You may\neven tell the prince, to your Regnant's everlasting horror, what she really\nthinks of him - and have no memory of it the next morning .\nHebephrenia\nThe horror of the World of Darkness unveiled has shattered your\nperceptions of everything you once held as logical and real . This crisis has\nplunged you into a state of mind in which you maintain your sanity by clinging\nto the idea that everything going on is just in your head . Everyone you know,\nwell, they're all characters in the little playworld your mind has created . Even\nyour Regnant is just the lead in your mind's script . Everything she does is\nsomething you make her do, so you really don't mind doing what she asks\n.\n\n\ni\ni\nif\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nC\ni\nwpler 3\n1rdder\nlion\nObviously your subconscious wanted her to ask you to do it . Those around you\nget pretty mad when you are rude to them, but it doesn't matter because they\naren't real .\nHypochondria\nYou have noticed that since you became a ghoul, you get sick every time\nyou face stress . The symptoms are usually limited to a headache or\nupset\nstomach, but are sometimes much worse . If at any time during an event you\nbecome upset about anything, you begin to think you are coming down with\nsomething suitably viral or nasty . In all probability you are quite healthy, but\nyou need some kind of excuse to get sympathy from those around you . When\nyou get \"sick\" you are effectively be down one Physical Trait for the rest of the\nevent, or until your \"attack\" passes .\nImmortal Fear\nThis Derangement reflects an absolute fear of becoming a vampire . You\nwill go to great lengths to safeguard yourself from becoming one of the living\ndead, preferring to die permanently than become a creature cursed and feared\nthe world over . What's more, you love the sun and everything associated with\nit. Any attempt by your Regnant to even broach the subject of your Embrace\nis met with either stony silence or panicked protestation . You may even turn\nand flee. Should anyone attempt to Embrace you, you must test for Frenzy .\nMasochism\nSometimes things go wrong, dreadfully so . Deep down inside, you know\nit's all your fault. Since nobody else may necessarily know that you're\nresponsible, you have to work out a way of keeping yourself in line . You do so\nby getting yourself into harmful situations, or by hanging around with people\nand creatures who dislike you . You deserve their abuse, it's your penance .\nYou even tend to injure yourself physically, but never to a degree that\nmost people would notice . You don't want anybody to know what a terrible\nperson you are, so you don't leave any marks . If a problem comes up and you\nare blamed, even falsely, apologize profusely and offer yourself up to the mercy\nof your accuser . Even if you're not responsible for whatever it is, odds are that\nkarma is just catching up with you for a previous crime.\nObsession\nYou are obsessed with your Regnant . Nobody loves her like you do, and\nyou are certain that you know what is best for her . Everybody else misunder-\nstands her and seeks to hurt her, so you have to keep them all away . Her other\nghouls may profess to love her, but they are false suitors . Their passion is\nnothing compared to your great, all-consuming love .\n\n\n70\nThis dangerous Derangement can be activated by the presence of a new\nghoul, or merely by anyone else taking an interest in your Regnant . You would\nrather die (taking her with you, of course) than let her he with another .\nPanzaism\nSince your induction into the ways and world of the vampire, you have\nbecome completely detached . When the Derangement is at its mildest, you\nhave some trouble with the idea of the world at large being real. In a way, you\nseem to he halfway out of your body, simply watching events flow by . Your\nbody may act, but it all seems so mechanical, so contrived .\nWhen this Derangement is at its worst, things get really interesting . You\n\"realize\" that nothing is real . Nothing. You are nothing . The vampires are\nnothing . Everything is unreal . You can't affect the universe and the universe\ncan't affect you because there is nothing there\n. When everything seems to be\ngoing wrong, you wrap yourself up in this mental cocoon and refuse come out\nuntil things are more to your liking .\nPower Madness\nYou are obsessed with control, especially the idea of controlling your\nRegnant's affairs . When this Derangement is active, you are so preoccupied\nwith your megalomaniacal obsessions that you lose all control of yourself .\nWhen your goals are thwarted, you come unglued and attack, either physi-\ncally or verbally, those who oppose you . In short, you seek total and absolute\ncontrol of your Regnant and her household .\nThis Derangement can also be translated onto greater or smaller scales .\nSome ghouls may want to run their cities . Others may be content with\ndominating individual people or sites .\nI\nI\nI\n\n\n \nI\nL~9\n~er 3 l-hiui\nr Credio ~ I \n'x,,,`11\nQuixotism\nThis Derangement is the opposite of Panzaism . You believe everything\nyou see or hear. Yes, there are faeries . That guy with all the hair, he's a\nwerewolf. Oh, and by the way, this pendant same from Atlantis . You'll be out\nchallenging windmills to personal combat before tea time, at least metaphori-\ncally. You probably same from a perfectly mundane background, and nothing\nout of the ordinary ever happened to you . However, now that you've been\ninitiated into the secrets of the World of Darkness, logic has gone out the\nwindow . You are effectively down two Mental Traits whenever you are in a\nstressful situation .\nSadism\nYou resort to cruelty as a response when under pressure . Nothing relieves\nyour stress like causing people pain . Physical pain isn't all you excel in,\nthough. Sometimes mental anguish can last mush, mush longer . Whenever\nconfronted with something that profoundly bothers you, you must either\nspend a Willpower Trait or find some way of taking out your anger on\nsomeone immediately .\nSycophancy\nIf there is one thing you know (and you know it well), it is that you cannot\nsurvive without your Regnant. She made you and she can unmake you . To\nkeep her from leaving you to die, you do everything she says . In fast, you go\nbeyond the letter of her law and do things that you think she would like you\nto do. If she likes classical music, get her tickets to the symphony . So what if\nthey cost well over a hundred dollars . Isn't your life worth it? You spend your\nInfluence Traits on frivolous things to make your Regnant happy, and thus\nfind yourself caught short when crunch times some .\nRevenant Character Creation\nSpecific guidelines for creating revenant ghoul characters can he found\non page 65 of Antagonists. These are optional, and can be superseded by the\nbasic ghoul creation guidelines in this book . Note: All revenant ghouls must\npick a Path of Enlightenment at character creation beginning their in-game\nexistence with a Path rating of 1 . Revenants (with the exception of the\nGrimaldis) also have the option of learning Vicissitude as one of their\nDisciplines .\n\n\n'ft\n[u n\nter 4 Wep injllltl\nChapter Four.\n-14\nRoleplaying and\nStorytelling\nWhen we cannot act as we wish, we must act as we can .\n- Terrence\nStoryteller Incentive\nThere are several reasons for starting players off with mortal or ghoul\ncharacters (the rapid ghouling of mortals is perfectly acceptable in Mind's\nEye Theatre games, and can be used as reward for new players who learn\nquickly) . Setting up new players as ghouls instead of vampires reduces the\noverpopulation problem endemic to many Masquerade games . It's not\nuncommon to find 70 or more vampires in a city that's large enough to support\nperhaps one-tenth that number . By starting new characters as ghouls,\nStorytellers can maintain population balance .\nIntroducing ghouls also serves game balance . With new characters\ncoming in as ghouls instead of vampires, the power level of the average\ncharacter drops and gameplay is easier to manage .\nPlaying ghouls enables you to justify daylight events, and adds another\nlayer to the intrigues of your game .\nStarting players off as ghouls expands newcomers' roleplaying experi-\nence. They learn about the game even as their characters are educated by their\nRegnants .\n1 -_N t\n\n\nUltimately, playing a ghoul can lead to being Embraced . The precious\nnature of vampiric existence is emphasized by making players work for this\n\"advancement .\" Who is more likely to appreciate the Embrace : a ghoul who's\ngiven long service in hopes of becoming immortal, or a neonate who was\nchanged without explanation or cause? Furthermore, who will be better at\nroleplaying, the player who's developed a character oward a specific goal\nover the course of months of gameplay, or a newcomer who wanders into a\ngame and is immediately made a vampire as a matter of course?\nPlayer Incentive\nThis game is primarily about vampires. So why would anyone want o\nplay a ghoul instead? There are several reasons .\nStarting off as a ghoul is a perfectly acceptable way o get involved in any\nMind's Eye Theatre game. This approach is ideal for inexperienced players ;\nnewcomers may not have had previous exposure o the World of Darkness .\nIt's a lot easier to play someone who knows little of the true nature of things\nwhen one actually doesn't know what's going on . Starting an uneducated (in\nthe ways of The Masquerade, at least) player with an uneducated character\nalso helps to cut down information overload . Newcomers struggling to digest\nrules and background and history and character and the Traditions are likely\no be confused. Having a Regnant there o teach her ghoul (while the\nRegnant's player helps out the ghoul's player) saves wear and tear on\nNarraors, and provides a more immediate source of information .\nHowever, it's unlikely that \"mere\" ghoul characters will lack for things\nto do. Curious vampires will size up the potential threat of any and all\n\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\n 'L4mprcr 4 ltoiepirnpng\nnewcomers. So long as overzealous vampire characters don't regard all\nmortals as potential blood donors, ghoul characters will get the chance to do\nwhat they need to . In addition, ghouls have a few tricks of their own, and even\na new ghoul may not be as overmatched by a vampire as one might think\n.\nThere are several things to keep in mind when playing a ghoul. A ghoul\nis a complex creature, inhuman enough to want to forget her past but human\nenough to fear for her future . Within each ghoul, Humanity and Beast engage\nin an endless struggle . The paradox is: The ghoul continues to exist only as\nlong as the struggle within continues . Should Humanity triumph, existence\nas a blood drinker becomes unthinkable . Should the Beast win, little is left of\nthe ghoul's original personality .\nEvery afternoon or evening, a ghoul wakes up knowing that she is\nexcluded from both the mortal and immortal worlds . The only sanctuary she\ncan find is with other ghouls, and even that comfort can he hollow . Still, the\nempathy of peers is the only refuge that ghouls can find . Understanding each\nother's suffering creates strong bonds between most ghouls, and they tend to\nlook out for one another, especially those outside their own households\n.\nCompetition for the Regnant's attention can arise within a household, over\nduties, and as a result of sheer proximity to people with whom you have little\nin common but your blood .\nWhile ghouls are less powerful than their masters, sunlight is the great\nequalizer. A ghoul can almost forget the cold, undead hand that clutches at\nher heart when the sun warms her skin . But as the sun sets, her double life\nresumes . Of course, the vampire won't forget his ghoul's ability to walk the\nsunlit streets, and will certainly prepare a duty list .\nWhether their Regnants are cruel or kind, all ghouls are enthralled to\nthem to some degree . A vampire can symbolize everything a ghoul despised\nin life, yet she would still do nearly anything her Regnant wanted . How does\nit feel for a character to love everything she once hated? How would it feel for\nthe most independent of individuals to need someone so desperately? This\nperverted devotion is unnatural, and most ghouls recognize that . However,\nalmost all ghouls are helpless to act in the face of the Bond that ties (and gags)\nthem .\nMaking the Decision\nA player needs to he prepared to explore the uncharted emotional\ntragedy of the Blood Bond before she decides to play a ghoul . Playing a Bound\ncharacter can demand that a ghoul act contrary to her best interests, out of\nthe narcotic love that the Bond inspires. This love can make a character do\nthings that she doesn't want to, things that she would never normally do, or\nthings that are not necessarily in keeping with her long-term plans . To play\na ghoul is to play a character with less than total free will, and players should\nthink long and hard before accepting ghoulish restrictions\n.\n\n\n76\n1\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nTiber\nI CS G011ies\nGhouls who interact with humans can feel a plethora of overwhelming\nfeelings, from regret to anger to isolation . They can never let others, not even\nfamily or friends, know what is going on in their lives, though. Some break\noff relationships to avoid the pain or to spare loved ones the horror of\ndiscovery. The danger of a loved one witnessing a frenzy, the fear of a Regnant\nexecuting a friend as a \"lesson\" - these are the nightmares that haunt ghouls .\nThus the majority of ghouls slowly but surely step away from their intimate\nhuman relationships . Ultimately, ghouls are more alone in a crowd than they\nare on their own .\nOn the other hand, the benefits intrinsic to being a ghoul can make such\nhell worthwhile. Many an Olympic medalist in the World of Darkness has\ningested vampiric blood ; it is the ultimate performance enhancer, and it can't\nhe spotted in a drug test. Some vampires sponsor athletes, pitting them\nagainst the pawns of Kindred rivals in secret contests of one-upmanship\n.\nSports stars, aspiring actors, musicians, politicians, lawyers and computer\nprogrammers have all benefited from the power of a Regnant.\nSome ghouls even enjoy vampire politics, despite their status as super-\nnatural second-class citizens . They find it easy to manipulate their Regnants\nafter living with them so closely for so long . However, it is still a Herculean\neffort to gain any status as a ghoul in vampire society. Some ghouls offset their\nloneliness and rejection with the desire to be Embraced, to enter fully at least\none of the worlds they inhabit . Others would rather die than lose all\nHumanity to the Beast .\nMany vampires Embrace their most outstanding ghouls, as long as this\nchange in status will not interfere with the ghouls' work . Other reasons for\nEmbracing ghouls include rewarding servants for exceptional work, or mov-\ning trusted retainers into positions of more authority . Ghouls who are\nEmbraced are often given more choice in the matter than are other potential\nchilder. The transition from human to vampire is also less painful for a ghoul\nwho has already seen vampire society at work .\nEmbraced ghouls retain the Disciplines they possessed as half-humans,\nbut now their new clan Disciplines come to them more easily than they might\nhave . Meanwhile, Disciplines not related to their new clans become as hard\nto gain as any out-of-clan powers .\nThe First Change\nThe change from mortal to ghoul is important to roleplay . The way the\nRegnant introduces her intended ghoul to the World of Darkness is crucial\n.\nSome vampires take a backhanded approach, tricking their intended Thralls\ninto drinking the blood in a variety of ways . As soon as a victim of this sort\nof deception is Blood Bound and his new abilities manifest, the Regnant\nreveals what is really going on . These crucial tidbits are often dropped at a\n\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\n1T\n'\n, AnPI e1.\nLieh agiI g\njuncture that makes escape difficult or impossible, say, when the first vitae\ncraving comes on .\nSeduction is another means of drawing in a would-be ghoul, with the\nBlood Bond applied during the course of romance . When a Regnant reveals\nher true nature, a ghoul who has already been Bound is less likely to go into\ncomplete panic. The vampire's revelation to her new ghoul is a shock, of\ncourse, but the love he bears his Regnant no doubt provides him with the\nanchor needed to steady him at such a turbulent moment\n.\nOf course there is always the heartless vampire who swoops down on an\nunsuspecting mortal and spirits her away to a cellar, where the victim is Blood\nBound at the would-he Regnant's leisure . Such ghouls are more likely to rebel\ndown the road ; the trauma of their initiation into the World of Darkness\ntaints even the love of the Bond .\nAll of these methods of exposing new ghouls to the supernatural have\nprofound effects on their subjects . It is important to remember that before\nbecoming a ghoul, a character's life might have been completely mundane .\nThe sudden shift of reality can shatter beliefs, ideals and sanity . The challenge\nis in imagining how your character handles this rush of information . Think\nabout it this way : she's just been offered eternal life and powers that no mortal\ncan possess . In return, she has to agree to serve and protect her benefactor,\nwho claims to be a vampire . All she has to do is drink this lunatic's possibly\ndisease-infested blood . . . .\nYes, presentation is very important.\n\n\nCharacterization in Play\nWhen roleplaying, a player assumes the persona of her character . A\ncharacter is going to change and be changed like a real person is . These can\nbe simple behavioral alterations, the products of learning from experience, or\nchanges can be as grandiose as the manifestations of new Disciplines\n.\nSubtle changes occur, too ; usually alterations of an emotional or mental\nsort. Betrayal is a good example. If a character is betrayed in the course of a\ngame, she is probably more careful about whom she trusts in the future. Other\ncharacters may not understand this sudden change of heart (they may not\neven know about the betrayal), but the player does and doesn't necessarily\nneed to explain .\nPeople rarely understand what makes others tick, or what their reasons\nfor actions are, and this should be reflected in-game . Just because a player\nknows out-of-game information about another character does not necessarily\nmake that information her character's knowledge . The information is outside\nthe game and therefore outside the character's sphere . If the prince is\nportrayed by a player's best friend, that doesn't make it right for the two\nunrelated characters to be chummy without a good in-game reason .\nExperienced players don't need to play their characters according to\nstereotypes. Long-time players should look for challenges . If you normally\nstick to businesslike characters, creating an extrovert or artist might be a\nwelcome change . If you're struggling to come up with something different\n(everybody's creative well runs dry at some point), another point of view can\n \nTiber i uswi us\nI\nA Little Common Sense\nIf your character has irritated the prince and is dragged into\ncourt to be berated or punished, don't treat it like a joke .\nRemember that Kindred law is strict, most crimes are punishable\nby Final Death, and the prince is head honcho in a city full of\nunliving superpowered killers for a reason . More to the point,\nthere's no reason for the prince to care if an annoying ghoul lives\nor dies . Playing a ghoul flippantly can lead to character death\n.\nJust because you're playing a ghoul instead of a vampire\ndoesn't mean the game is any less serious . Playing a ghoul is a\nlicense to step outside the strict rules of vampiric society, but\ndon't abuse the opportunity . Invest your ghoul character some\ncommon sense, and don't feel that he's less valuable to the game\n.\nthan a vampire character is.\n∎\n∎\n\n\nStoryteller Tips\nbe helpful. Sometimes a Storyteller can offer suggestions based on the\nchronicle's needs, or a friend can play sounding hoard . If playing a ghoul\nsounds interesting, go to town. A player who normally creates brutes might\nfind a cowardly Servitor fun, too . Those who typically play intellectual types\nmight relish the opportunity to kick butt as part of a squad of Brujah ghoul\nroadies .\nIntroducing ghoul characters might sound good, but how do these sorry\ncreatures fit ino a Mind's Eye Theatre game? Actually, they fit in pretty\neasily . Ghouls are great characters for all roleplayers, regardless of whether\nphysical action or intrigue is important . Hunters, spies, bodyguards and\nchancellors - all of these roles and more can be filled by ghoul characters .\nWhether a ghoul slips ino a vampire's haven for a little early morning spying,\nwhispers plans ino his Regnant's ear, or uses Potence o teach some manners\nto a snot-nosed neonate, he can be a force to be reckoned with .\nGhouls add depth o a game . They bring life o characters who, until now,\nwere dismissed as two-dimensional henchmen . Elder vampires often have\nseveral ghouls who are never seen or played out, and all of these ghouls'\nactions (\"I have my Servitors arrange the firebombing of that arrogant\nTremere's house .\") take place offstage, as exposition instead of action- With\nthese rules, those faceless ghouls become flesh-and-blood characters, and\nhave their own agendas (and allow important events like firebombing the\nTremere to take place during gameplay) .\n\n\nHowever, it's important that ghoul characters aren't completely depen-\ndent on their Regnants . They should be able to partake of an evening's\nfestivities even if their Regnants don't show up . If Michael plays Renee's\nRegnant, and Michael has to miss the game, Renee is put in an awkward\nposition if she is dependent on their characters' interactions . However, if\nRenee's character is wrapped up in plots that don't involve her Regnant, she\nstill has plenty o do while Michael misses all the fun .\nIntroducing ghouls who have player Regnants can he a challenge and a\ngreat responsibility for whomever plays the Regnant . This parental role is\nrecommended for responsible roleplayers . That doesn't mean the Regnant is\nboring to play . The role simply demands maturity .\nStorytellers might even want to encourage players to assume ghoul\ncharacters to help fill out their cities . After all, anyone can play a ghoul . Some\nmight relish the challenge . Others might need convincing . Prod the reluctant\nalong by suggesting that they create ghouls along the lines of the vampire\ncharacters they would have played. After all, they might get Embraced - if\nthey're good .\nAnother technique you can use with ghouls is daylight play . This is one\nof the ghoul's greatest advantages . This is good for players who can't make an\nevening of it but who would still like to play . Players can be ghouls in the\nafternoon and Regnants in the evening . This sort of double casting takes a bit\nof planning, but is worth it .\n\n\nStory Ideas\nGhouls can be used as plot hooks in sorylines, drawing in vampires who\nhave something to do with them, and even drawing in those who have\nnothing to do with them.\nHunters Hunted\nHunter ghouls have set up housekeeping in the city, seeking to stockpile\nblood and perhaps liberate a few brethren at the same time . To assist the used\nand abused, they gather vast amounts of information as payment from suitably\ngrateful ghouls . This includes Influences, names of vampires' allies and\nenemies, access routes to havens, and details about vampires themselves\n.\nSuch information can be used in a number of ways, from embarrassing abusive\nRegnants to sparking full-scale wars between vampires .\nHunters perform hostile takeovers of cities with nothing less than their\nlives at stake. Extensive sieges of metropolitan areas are time-consuming and\ndangerous, and the longer one of these operations takes the more the tide\nturns in favor of the truly immortal . Still, if everything falls just right, a cadre\nof Hunter ghouls can cut a swath of terror through a city's vampiric\npopulation before moving on to the next target\n.\nWhen portrayed effectively, Hunters can throw vampires into full-scale\npanic. The thought of a Hunter prowling the streets in search of vampire\nblood may seem silly at first . The first kill ends the laughter, though, and sends\n\n\nL\n82\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni iUer\nf i3 GoIlle3\nsecurity bills skyrocketing . Even the most recalcitrant Brujah suddenly finds\nnew appreciation . for the Masquerade, which should be top priority anyway .\nIf the Masquerade is broken frequently in your game, Hunters can be used to\ndiscourage vampires' antics .\nTales From the Crypt\nRevenants are recommended for a different kind of horror . They can be\nintroduced in a number of ways . The dilapidated old mansion that a\nMalkavian moves into already has residents : the Bratoviches . A Zantosa\nbrings a date (a vampire's loved one or a favorite ghoul) home for dinner, and\nguess what's on the menu? The Tremere find they have competition in\nsearching for a grimoire ; the Obertuses are looking for the same book . A\nVentrue prince learns that one of his trusted ghouls is actually a Grimaldi\ninfiltrator, but which ghoul is it? And if there are revenants around, can the\nSabbat be far behind?\nStoryteller Note\nRevenants bring plenty of disturbing qualities to your\ngame, but a surfeit of weirdness can leave players numb . Be\ncareful how you introduce such elements ; give players time to\nabsorb before showing them greater horrors . Too much strange-\nness at one time might leave them saying, \"A horse with its\nstomach ripped out left on the mayor's front lawn? How\ngauche!\" If you want to inject the occasional random act of\nviolence (particularly in the case of revenants), add some kind\nof implied thought process to the scene . Dead people and\nanimals are scary, but the line into terror is crossed when all of\ntheir organs are neatly laid out next to the butchered bodies .\nSuddenly the violence is no longer random ; whoever commit-\nted the heinous act had a specific motive-a frightfully warped\none .\nTry to avoid the overused clichés of horror, such as penta-\ngrams and the like. Familiarity breeds boredom . Always take\nplenty of time and use lots of detail to describe a setting or event\nthat involves revenants . They are meant to be alien, and\nshouldn't be taken lightly .\n\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nYou Rang?\nServitors, though basically the least troublesome of ghouls, are not\nusually prepared for the eternity that stretches out before them . More than\none has been known o go insane from the crushing weight of years and the\nagony of the Embrace denied . Although this is possible with any ghoul, these\nunfortunates are very often attached to vampires of high standing, have the\nmost responsibilities in a given household, and have free rein over a Regnant's\nInfluences . Needless to say, these ghouls can cause a lot of trouble when they\ngo rogue . Such ghouls are put down eventually, but hopefully with a measure\nof dignity, respect or sorrow .\nMood for this type of story can be anything from manic o somber . The\npoor ghoul was once perfectly normal and sane, perhaps even happy with her\nlife. Encourage the Regnant o create memories of happier times, or other\nplayers to recall memories of interacting with the ghoul during her lucid days\n.\nSuch recollections can only intensify the frustration and heartbreak of the\nsituation, making the inevitable that much more painful .\nObsessive Servitors can spice up a game considerably . Ghouls who are\ndriven by the false love of the Bond can become jealous of their household\nfellows or even other vampires . Nothing is as messy as an all-out war between\nghouls, with their Regnant as the prize . Nothing is as dangerous as an obsessed\nThrall who stalks his Regnant's companions\n.\n\n\n l / l l l\nI I\n∎ ∎\nKindred Opinions of Ghouls\n84\nWe often despise what is most useful to us\n.\n- Aesop, The Hart and the Hunter\nif\nEverybody has an opinion on ghouls . Whether they hate them or love\nthem, few vampires are truly neutral when it comes to these quasi-immortals .\nMembers of the Camarilla view them as both a threat and a vital resource,\ninevitably falling back on the old cliché : \"Can't live with them, can't live\nwithout them-\" Sabbat vampires take a dim view of ghouls. The unaligned\nclans have their own agendas for them .\nCamarilla Opinions About Ghouls\nBrujah\nOld and wise Brujah make wide use of ghouls . Brujah prefer ghouls who\nare intelligent or reflexive rebels, and don't often plan beyond the act of\nghouling itself. They may also ghoul human members of their gangs, but with\nthe understanding that these people have proved themselves capable of\nrunning with the pack . Such people are also candidates for the Embrace\n.\nSometimes Brujah make ghouls out of sheer laziness . The vampires\nbecome tired of continually veiling their words or speaking in double\nentendre, and ghoul their human companions to allow themselves to talk\nmore freely .\n'\nGangrel\nGangrel think ghouls have as much right to true immortality as vampires\ndo, occasionally more so . Ghouls are the responsibility of the Regnants who\ncreate them, since ghouls are practically childer . Gangrel don't create ghouls\nvery often, preferring to take responsibility only for themselves ; one, with a\nnumber of ghouls in tow are usually active in city politics . Gangrel are most\nlikely to make ghoul animals; their command of Animalism ensures a tight\nBond with their beloved pets .\nMalkavians\nMalkavians have no formal uses for ghouls, but prefer their helpers to be\nsomewhat off-balance . If a Kook's ghoul of choice is not slightly insane at first,\nthe Malkavian rectifies that as quickly as possible . Malkavians seem to like\nghouls but don't keep many of them, finding them a bother to keep track of\n.\nWhen a Malkavian does take a ghoul, he uses the resource to the fullest . Crazy\ndoesn't mean inefficient .\n\n\nA Malkavian's Derangement is the key factor in how he treats his \"toys .\"\nThose ghouls unfortunate enough to he chosen by extremely unstable\nvampires often have short life spans .\nNosferatu\nThese vampires have a hard time keeping ghouls until they are Blood\nBound, and make use of Mask of 1000 Faces until they are. Most mortals just\ncan't get past appearances.\nNosferatu don't need human ghouls as much as the other clans do, but\nthey use the ones they have extensively (there are secrets that not even the\nNosferatu can learn without the aid of normal-looking pawns) . Animal\nghouls are often created as bodyguards, haven defenders and messengers\n.\nThey are also less likely to judge their masters by appearances .\nThe notorious Nosferatu spawning pools embody the heights of animal\nghoul making. Within these burbling cauldrons of foulness, sewer creatures\nbatten on Nosferatu blood and mutate into the most efficient home security\nsystems imaginable . Few intruding vampires, no matter how thoroughly they\nmay think they have done their research, are prepared for the monstrosities\nthat a spawning pool can vomit forth .\nNosferatu prize a certain profile among their human ghouls : detail-\noriented people who have inquisitive minds and aggressive attitudes .\nToreador\nToreador are infamous for picking ghouls for aesthetic as opposed to\nstrategic reasons - living artwork to keep around the haven . Looks aren't\neverything, though, even for the Toreador . Poseurs seeking secretaries,\nchauffeurs or any sort of \"help\" deliberately choose those who look plain or\ndowdy, but who can get the job done. Servants should not outshine their\nmasters, after all . Artistes are more likely to need housekeepers or assistants\nwho can keep havens from falling apart, and who won't touch the works in\nprogress in the basement .\n,~\nToreador as masters are a very mixed bag . Some disdain their ghouls as\nmere hired help . Others are protective employers. A few are imperiously\ncruel. They do, however, speak quite highly (even if it is with a surfeit of snide\ncomments) of the joys of having Blood Bound ghouls to take care of things .\nFor the most part this entails all the worldly duties normally taken care of in\ndaylight hours (legalities, hills, banking, paying off parking tickets) that\nToreador don't like to be bothered with .\nTremere\nWhen they can get them, old-fashioned Tremere prefer illiterate ghouls\nwho are incapable of reading their precious grimoires . However, illiterates\nwho are competent at the tasks set them aren't easy to find .\n85\n\n\n∎ \n∎\nSome Tremere select promising occult students\ng\no\n(espe-\ncially work involving new Internet search vehicles and computerized library\ncatalogs). They Blood Bond these agents as quickly as possible and liberally\nemploy Dominate to ensure their loyalty . All Tremere who wish to create\nghouls must have the permission of the local Regent, and must provide full\ndossiers on their would-be victims . Ghouls who are created without either are\nnot tolerated . The offending Tremere is punished, and the unfortunate\nghouls are executed .\nVentrue\nOf all Camarilla vampires, the Ventrue are the most fond of ghouls . Some\nhave 10 or more at any given time. Ventrue choose their servants based on\nwhat they need o control . How well a potential ghoul takes orders is\nimportant as well . Some Ventrue jokingly compare the process of choosing\na ghoul to that of an employer picking among job applicants . Ventrue tend\nto treat their ghouls very well, but arc careful not to let them grow too close\n.\nGhouls are employees in Ventrue eyes, which goes a long way in preventing\nobsessive Regnant-Thrall relationships . Ventrue do, however, give more\nrespect (and other rewards) to the highest achievers in their ghoulish broods,\nwhich can lead to fierce competition between ghouls . This competition has\nbeen known o turn deadly .\nSabbat Opinions on Ghouls\nSabbat vampires believe that ghouls are a waste of vitae and are good for\nnothing, not even cannon fodder . Ironically, few Sabbat strategists have\nseized upon the deep-seated discontent among Camarilla ghouls as a tactical\nadvantage to be exploited . Sabbat hatred for Camarilla Kindred and for\nghouls in general seems to blind the vampires to the usefulness of ghouls as\nweapons .\nThose few ghouls within the Sabbat who arc not part of the revenant\nlilies walk dangerously thin lines . A Sabbat ghoul can be destroyed for the\nmost minor of infractions by any sect member, and the ghoul's \"owner\" isn't\nlikely to argue .\nRevenants themselves are barely tolerated . Only the political and\nspiritual weight of Clan Tzimisce shier them from total annihilation. The\nsect has already purged four of the revcnant families, and many believe that\na second purge is coming\n.\nAntitribu keep ghouls, but consider disposable when the agents'\nerrands are completed .\n\n\nLasombra despise ghouls . If their Tzimisce allies did not support the little\nannoyances so emphatically, the entire subspecies would have been culled\nfrom the sect long ago . Lasombra ghouls are few and far between, and are kept\nmainly for two reasons : financial or political expertise, or skill at personal\ngrooming. The former is self-explanatory ; the Lasombra aren't fools and\nwon't discard useful tools . The latter is explicable in light of the clan\nweakness . These ghouls serve as surrogate mirrors for their Regnants-\nTzimisce\nThe Fiends have more uses for ghouls than they can shape fingers to\ncount them on . Of course, most Tzimisce ghouls aren't the happiest of\nservants, as their masters disfigure them until interaction with the mortal\nworld becomes impossible. Tzimisce have even developed new varieties of\nghouls, into which they installed specific emotions and personalities .\nSzlachta are kept as guardians . They are so worked over with Vicissitude\n(bone carapaces, horns, callused skin) that they have lost all semblance of\nhumanity, both physically and mentally . A vast majority have also lost the\nweakest grip on reality-\nWar ghouls, called vozhd, are the most rare of the Tzimisce creations .\nThey are composed of several ghouls who are grafted togother . Vozhd are most\noften used as siege weapons . Ghouls melded into one of these abominations\nlose their minds and Humanity in\nof o\nne fel swop, and no one has found a way\no restore them .\nSome creative Tzimisce craft ghouls into furniture or ornaments for their\nhavens . Still others have mastered the ab i lity of weaving the hapless creatures\ninto fashionable clothing (which, rumor has it, stays warm, even in the\nwinter) .\nThe revenant families were first created by the Tzimisce, and are\nsometimes used, even in their debased modern state, to breed promising\ncandidates for future childer .\n\n\nNeutral Clan Opinions on Ghouls\nThese vampires are more accepting outs than are the Sabbat, but\ndepend on them less than Camarilla vampires do . Members of the nonaligned\nclans often have surprising uses for their ghouls, and even more surprising\nways of keeping them in line .\nAssamites\nAll Assamites spend seven Years as ghouls before being Embraced into\nthe clan, so every Assamite has an intrinsic understanding of the ghoul's\nstation . This may not cause nn Assassin to spare a ghoul who gets in his way,\nbut at least he won't despise the ghoul for what he is .\nThe Assamites choose their ghouls with an eye on the future . An\nAssassin's ghoul is not a servant . he is a potential Assamite whose worth is\nassessed throughout his half-human apprenticeship . Assume r ghouls are held\nto the same high standards as their masters are, specifically in regard to honor,\ntruthfulness and dignity. Nun-Semitic men (not o mention women) have\nonly recently been selected as ghouls by members of this clan.\nCaitiff\nThe clanless vampires keep ghouls as a survival mechanism . Ghouls\nprovide backup whenever something Pig comes down . When intent on\nmaking ghouls, Caitiff seek out people like themselves\n: outcasts, misfits, the\nhomeless and anyone else who might prove useful . These ghouls are usually\ndrawn from the pools of mortals that the other clans have already surveyed,\nso the pickings get pretty slim. Beggars can't be choosers .\nGiovanni\nGiovanni ghoul those promising individuals who are not in the family,\nbut whose expertise they wish to use_ Power brokers, scholars, morticians,\nfinanciers these arc a l l good candidates for heing \"adopted\" into the family\n.\nMembers of the family- who, for whatever reason, are not chosen for the\nEmbrace may be sustained as ghouls for years\n.\nThe Necromancers have as many ghouls as the Ventrue do and utilize\nthem in similar ways, but also use a few unfortunates as subjects in their\nstudies. Any mortal who makes headway in the mysteries of the afterlife or\nwho shows talent in spirit communication should expect an offer she can't\nrefuse .\n\n\nRavnos\nThe average Ravnos values freedom so highly that enslaving ghouls is\nalmost anathema . However, Ravnos create ghouls on rare occasions, and\nmost of these are mortals with the mysterious Numina powers . A Ravnos\ntypically chooses a mortal of Gypsy Mood, specifically selecting a Rom who\ndisplays talents in the vaurpire's lost Numina . When a Ravnos drinks the\nblood of ghouls whose talents echo what his once were, he regains his powers\nbriefly . (The only blood that c ~ i n spark such a restoration of power comes from\nghouls who possesses the same gift that the vampire had .)\nApart from this sort of special case, Ravnos shun the creation of ghouls,\nunless they can avoid Bonding theta . Ghouls who do become attached to\nRavnos should be wary of their masters' activities, lest a heist gone wrong\nleave them holding the bag before a very annoyed prince .\nSetites\nWhen a Setite wants a ghoul, she get ., a Ghoul, even if it's one already\nBound to someone else . The Serpent have incredibly addictive blood and\nmake good use of it, poaching ghouls from other vampires with ease . The\nSetite gives a taste of his blood to ghouls already Bound o other vampires\n.\nThe original Regnants have no idea that their ghouls have been cotnpro-\nmised, or that Setites are monitoring their activities through spies . Setites\nrarely keep human ghouls in their temples or havens, but do have a predilec-\ntion for ghouling poisonous snakes . C1 I ras are particular favorites, though\nthey are difficult to come by .\nAnarchs\nAnarchs keep ghouls much like Caitiff do, choosing their Thralls from\nroadies and loyal toughs . Anarch ghouls are often picked for their prowess at\nmoving things quickly, by day or night. Nothing is more valuable to these\nvampires than the ability to get out town after the inevitable Blood Hunt has\nbeen called. There are times when waiting for nightfall to move would prove\nfatal .\n\n\nAUNTIE CSILLA'S ADVICE\nFOR THE BLOODLORN\nDear Csilla,\nI've been\na reader for years,\never since I was made\na\nghoul .\nI was wondering if you have any advice for a Bound\nghoul whose Regnant is mistreating him horribly?\nSigned,\nMiserable and Loving It\nDear Miserable,\nWe all know how grumpy Kindred can get, but its not an excuse\nto beat on an innocent ghoul . There are Regnants out there who\nthink they have nothing better to do than take out theiraggressions\non their Thralls . Some of them even do it for fun!\nSick of it? Sick of her pals kicking you around? Mispronouncing\nyour name? Feeding on you without permission? Well, I'll tell you\nwhat, honey, there are ways of getting back at those jerks. And I'm\ngoing to lay out how. . . .\nBut before I start, don't even think about saying \"But mine's not\nlike that. \" Uh-huh . If she weren't like that, you wouldn't be reading\nthis column, dearie. If you get offended and put this down now,\nyou're not a ghoul -you're a vampire in a warm suit .\nOkay, it goes like this, kiddies: I you think revenge is a dish best\nserved cold, huh-unh - it can be served hot. (Or you can make them\nthink that, but that's my best and easiest one, and I should save it\nfor last.)\nLet me give you a little example I cooked up for my friend\nArmand. His kind, loving, generous Regnant decided to try him out\nas a bulletproof vent. In case you were wondering, it didn't go\nterribly well . He nearly died, with six neat little puncture wounds in\nhim .\nAt any rate, my friend the pincushion hired me to get back at his\nRegnant, and this is the trifle I came up with to make her regret\ntreating him that way . I call it Machka'a Little Ditty . Don't ask about\n\n\nthe name; I don't want to get Machka in trouble. She's working on\nher third Regnant now - the first two never knew what hit them .\nAnyway, we're getting off topic. First, you need a sponge and a\nbit of paraffin wax. Water down the sponge, then squeeze it tight .\nYou probably have Potence, so go to town. While the sponge is as\nscrunched up as you can make it, dip it into the wax and then freeze\nthe little blob .\nThen things get tricky . To use the Little Ditty, you need to get into\nyour target's haven. This is no problem if you're doing it for one of\nthe resident ghouls or for yourself, but if you're poaching a Regnant,\nwatch out. Hopefully you know where your target's sleeping and\nwhat defenses she employs . If her ghouls are on your side, they\nwon't be a problem.\nOn the way over to the mark, make sure you pick the wax off the\nsponge . Keep the bundle of joy in your hand so that it warms up a\nbit. When the time comes, you'll need it moderately well thawed\n.\nOkay, now for the really dangerous part . You have a 5o-5o\nchance of getting caught at thin point, so be ready to run with\nCelerity at pull tilt. As carefully as you can, togs the sponge down\nyour target's gullet. If you can get it past the little dangly things at\nthe back of her throat, you're in business .\nNow comes the most important part - run. If you aren't fast,\nyou're going to die. Hopefully you planned an escape route, prefer-\nably one that leads past bright, sunny windows. If the bloodsucker\nis in a high-rise, head for a corner stairwell and slide down the\nbanister.\nWhat is the result of this endeavor, besides leaving untidy wax\ndroppings for anyone with Psychometry to discover? What can you\npossibly hope to accomplish? It's really sweet. The sponge thaw's in\nthe vampire's throat, where it expands and is irretrievable . In and\nof itself, that's just annoying. The funny part comes in when she\ntries to feed . Blood gets soaked up by the sponge so it can't nourish\nher, yet she can taste it back there . It's so tantalizing it hurts .\nOnce the blood congeals, thin go get really bothersome . What\nwith this hard scratchy thing in her throat, your Regnant is going to\nbreak down or get help and rip it out the hard way .\nEver seen a vampire tear out her own throat? It's a treat .\n\n\nDear Csilla,\nYou've obviously been doing this for decades . What was\nthe first trick you ever pulled, and which ones are your\nfavorites?\nCurious in Houston\nDear Curious,\nI came up with my first trick with a Ravnos ghoul who I met at a truck stop\non the way to Phoenix. She was fun, but her Regnant was too protective and bored\nme .\nTo be honest, it wasn't much of a prank. Ijust opened her coffin and nailed\nher feet to the bottom, then got in the car and drove like hell.\nOf course, I've gotten much better since then . 1f you're about to change\nemployment and don't really wish your old Regnant harm, use epoxy and stick\nsomething amusing to her fangs. Rabbit teeth work\nwell,\nand have a high\namusement value. Since vampires don't drool, this operation is surprisingly easy .\nThere are others that I'm fond of. A good one involves burning something in\nthe haven. When your Regnant finally gets around to inhaling, he gets a lungful\nof soot and a faceful of panic .\nI know childish ghouls who've thrown out all of their Regnants' clothes and\nthen vamoosed, but that lacks flair. Naked or not, an angry vampire can still kill\nyou. On the other hand, anything that can force a vampire to appear in court\nbefore sunset is good. The bloodsuckers usually get out of it, but it's fun to see\nthem sweat blood when that summons for io :oo A.M. arrives in the mail.\nDear Csilla,\nMy\nRegnant is a Ventrue, but he's not very good at\nbusiness . He keeps losing business deals, and when he\nscrews up he takes it out on me . I'm sure that if I worked\nharder he'd be more successful, but it's so hard with him\nabusing me the way he does . What should I do?\nYour faithful reader,\nHopeless in Seattle\n\n\nDear Hopeless,\nyou're being too hard on yourself . Sounds to me like your Regnant is going\nto be some Lasombra's snack before long . You'd be doing yourself a favor if you\nmoved on before it happened .\nIf you're really mad, stake the bastard and yank his fangs . you'll have no\nchoice but to leave him- If you don't I think you'll end up dead sooner or later,\nanyway . Get going. Leave him to his fate . You have nothing to do with his\nscrewups .\nDear\nCsilla,\nI\nneed\nsomething\nreally\nspecial\nfor\nmy Regnant .\nHe\nforgot\nthe\nanniversary\nof\nmy\nghouling,\nand\nI'm kind\nof\nupset .\nI don't want\nto hurt him,\nI just want\nto make\nhim\napologize .\nAny\nsuggestions?\nAnxiously\nawaiting guidance,\nHalfway Jilted\nDear Half,\nyou don't mind it I call you Half, do you? In any case, my best trick has got\nto be the Suntan/Sunburn routine . It's quick and easy . All you need is a beautiful\nsummer day, some suntan lotion for yourself and a sunburn mask for the vamp\nin question. Go out and get yourself a nice dark tan . Don't worry if you burn a bit ;\nthat gives the prank the extra touch of verisimilitude that it needs . Come home\nbe fore dusk and apply the sunburn mask to your mark . When you're finished, his\npretty little immortal face will appear nice and burned . When he wakes up and\nsees himself in the mirror (unless he's a Keeper, but in that case you have bigger\nproblems), he'll be at a loss for how he caught some rays . Did you take him to the\npark?\nOf course, if he has no sense of humor, you're in trouble . In that case, my\ncirculation drops by one. That's why I demand prepaid subscriptions, kiddies\n.\nThat's it for this week. I'm sorry I can't relate much more, but I have my\nRegnant's signii cant other to tar and feather . I might just cut off some of his hair\nwhile he sleeps and give it to a local Tremere . After all, it'll grow back before he\ncomes to in the evening, and he'll never notice its gone until the moment the first\npin goes into the voodoo doll. Send those cards and letters with suggestions!\nTake care, and remember: The only good Regnant is a humble Regnant .\nCSILLA\n\n\n94\nRelations with the World of Darkness\nVampires are not the only creatures that a ghoul has to worry about .\nThere are Lupines, mages and other Awakened beings who might not be\nfriendly o a vampire in training . Not many supernatural beings have dealings\nwith ghouls, unless contending with a Thrall's Regnant . Yet there's always\nthat first time, and a ghoul should be prepared . Ghouls have also been known\nto cultivate secret relationships with Lupines friends whom they knew before\ntasting vampire blood . Ghouls have also been haunted by the wraiths of those\nthey've killed in their Regnants' names .\nLupines\nFew ghouls look forward to coming face to face with werewolves\n.\nIronically, Lupines are the Awakened creatures that ghouls have o deal with\nmost often . Ghouls usually radiate some Wyrm-taint o Lupines, and are\nconsidered to be little better than the Leeches they serve . Every so often an\nenterprising vampire experiments with making Lupine Kinfolk into ghouls\n.\nIt usually backfires - badly . The victims' extended families attempt to slay\nthe new ghouls as acts of mercy . Kinfolk ghouls who hope to survive better\nrun far from their people .\nVery few Lupines are made into ghouls . Most werewolves have violent\nallergic reactions to the Wyrm-taint in vampiric blood (assuming one sits still\nlong enough to have some forced down her throat), and expel it immediately\n.\n\n\nPerhaps one Lupines in a hundred can be ghouled, and these are regarded as\none step short of Abominations .\nGhouls usually avoid werewolves whenever they can . As Awakened\ncreatures, ghouls are not subject to the Delirium, and can see nine-foot-tall\nfurry engines of destruction coming in plenty of time to get the hell out of the\nway. Some ghouls do cut deals with Lupines, but such exchanges are fraught\nwith peril for both sides.\nThe Changing Breeds\nLupines aren't the only shapeshifters in the world, although they are the\nmost numerous . Most of the other Changing Breeds have even less tolerance\nfor ghouls than werewolves do . Mokolé, in particular, have nothing but\ncontempt for ghouls, though this perception is perhaps skewed due to the sort\nof ghouls who go tromping around Mokolé lairs . Most of those unlucky\nServitors are in the company of land developers who have their eye on a\nregion. It's not surprising that the Mokolé have come to despise them .\nPerhaps the most benevolent attitude toward ghouls is that held by the\nNuwisha, who see them as means to get vampires' goats . A Nuwisha typically\nuses a ghoul to humiliate her Regnant, as opposed to killing the vampire\noutright .\nMages\nMages don't have many dealings with ghouls unless the Tremere are\ninvolved. Tremere often try to capture mages for study, sometimes turning\nthem into ghouls in an attempt o extend their shelf lives . While this has the\n\n\nbenefit of Bonding a ghouled mage so that he won't try anything tricky with\nCorrespondence and sunlight inside the haven, the process can imperil a\nmage's Avatar and hence his ability to work magick . Ghouled mages who can\nno longer work wonders are generally pumped for information and then\ndiscarded .\nConsors and ghouls in the same city often establish a sub rosa network,\ntrading information and favors o make their respective masters happy . This\nunderground servant connection can be a formidable force, and its members\nlook after their own .\nWraiths\nGhouls have definite problems with wraiths. As ghouls are often called\nupon to commit dirty deeds for their vampiric masters, they can rack up sizable\nbody counts. Furthermore, vampires tend to acquire large ghostly entourages .\nIf a ghoul can become friendly with a wraith, the ghost can he a valuable\nsource of information . However, most wraiths are unfriendly and inclined to\ncause ghouls trouble .\nRisen\nRisen are ghosts who have climbed hack into their bodies to finish\nbusiness on Earth . To come hack, wraiths have to make deals with their\nShadows . As part of a deal, a Risen might have to kill anyone it encounters,\nghouls included. Risen also possess the ghostly ability Lifesight, so ghouls\ncan't hide from them . Risen with less destructive Passions sometimes benefit\nfrom relations with ghouls, but these alliances are fragile and short-lived\n.\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n\nI\n \n~11~~1f P01~1)~il1)1H\ni\ni\nRisen can pass for vampires, and some seek out ghouls to help authenti-\ncate their disguises. An urban legend holds that an abused ghoul took\nadvantage of her friendship with a Risen to convince her Regnant to\nstraighten up and fly right. More likely, a ghoul would use a Risen friend to\nescape an intolerable Bond .\ni\ni\ni\ni\nChangelings\nChangelings generally avoid creatures as banal as the average vampire,\nbut have an easier time with ghouls . It has been theorized that supernatural\nrevelations make ghoul minds more flexible and capable of accepting oddities\nlike the fae . Yet even childlings know that the apple doesn't fall far from the\ntree, and don't trust ghouls . A lucky ghoul may be able to cultivate a\nfriendship with a fae, but the changeling is probably Unseelie and possesses\nan unhealthy curiosity about vampires. Seelie fae usually avoid ghouls\nentirely . Still, some look on these half-humans with pity .\n\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI fi\n~~\n1\nber JGUi1 es\nYou treat me like a dog,\nGive me a bone to chew,\nFrothing at the mouth,\nFrothing all over you\n- The Damned, \"Rabid\"\n\n\nLet's say you're a bright young vampire, but\nnot a particularly wealthy one . You want a loyal\nghoul, but without all the emotional baggage\n(and bills) that a mortal can bring. You don't\nwant to hear all the insipid questions . You want\nto be able to say, \"Frog[\" and have your ghouls\nhop without asking, \"How high?\" Don't get\nyourself a human; find an animal that suits your\nneeds .\nPersonally, my favorite species for ghouling\nis the dog . Borzoi, in particular, work well . They\naren't as bright as other canines, but they are the\nmost loyal and, without a doubt, the most\ncapable hunters that you could ask for . But l\nshouldn't bore you by telling you how wonderful\nmy puppies are when your needs might be met\nby other species .\nA companion of mine, one with an impressive\ncommand of Auspex, keeps birds of all sorts for\n\n\na wide variety of duties . While most adept at\nspying, birds are also excellent \"silent alarms\"\nand messengers for delivering warnings that\nmost people can never trace . They are also\nfearsome defenders . You laugh at the thought of\na \"killer attack parrot,\" but a beak in the eye is\nnothing to sneer at . Multiply that by a flock of 20\nand you begin to understand what my dear\nfriend Niccolo sees in his little canaries .\nOf course, Animalism is a prerequisite if you\nwant to keep animals of any kind under your\ncontrol . Vampires who seek to create animal\nghouls without this Discipline find themselves in\nthe same positions as the parents of teenagers\n:\nthey have no way to communicate . Further-\nmore, vampire blood can make an animal very\naggressive. The Beast in the blood seems to\nthrow domestics back to nature, as it were, and\neven the most affectionate of pets become\nsomewhat atavistic when they get a taste of\nvitae .\nMost find the domestic canine best suited to\nlife as a ghoul, but wolves are another story .\nWolves are so . .\n. primal . . . that to attempt to\nenslave them with the Blood Bond courts disas-\nter if you don't do it right . You have to consider\n\n\ntheir habits, the ways they challenge for rights of\nleadership - their whole societal structure .\nDomestic dogs, on the other hand, while they do\nrevert to a more natural state, have human\nconcepts ingrained into their skulls . This makes\nthem open to life with, and dependent upon, a\ntrue master. You become pack leader, the alpha .\nNo matter what type of animal you ghoul, you\nhave to deal with its degree of domestication .\nSome culture is better than none . Otherwise the\npoor beast may never develop any kind of\nintelligence . For example, my eldest dog Doran\nis capable of reasoning, and the occasional bit of\ndeductive logic . Though he's not terribly good\nat it yet, he can still make better decisions than\njust about any animal on Earth (at least, any\nanimal that's been around for fewer than five\ncenturies) . Mind you, Doran isn't much brighter\nthan a six year old, but he's improving . A few\nmore decades, and he'll be brighter than my\nCongressman .\nI find that most ghoul animals get brighter,\nbut it is a slow process . Borzoi are not the\nclearest thinkers, nor are Dobermans or grey-\nhounds . Their thought processes can take\ncenturies to improve. On the other hand, while\n\n\nprimates have intellects that mature rapidly, they\nare almost uncontrollable when ghouled . It has\nsomething to do with the way the Beast warps\nthem, I think . I won't give my blood to a monkey\n(marmoset, gibbon or any other primate, for\nthat matter) again after the last experiment l\nconducted . The property damage was in the tens\nof thousands of dollars, not to mention the\ninjuries inflicted on my person .\nUseful animals include the ferret, which is\nexcellent for thievery because it can get into air\nducts and other tight spaces . Horses are less\nuseful than they used to be (we have cars now,\nand mounted combat is passé), but as far as I'm\nconcerned, they still rank ahead of felines\n.\nDamned cats never do anything, and they expect\nyou to feed them whenever they want, which is\nusually at the least convenient times . Rodents\nwork well for information gathering; no build-\ning is rat-proof. (If you want to extend the\nprinciple and give your blood to cockroaches,\nyou're not likely to get much useful information\nback. Insects are simply unintelligible, and\nghouling them is a waste of blood .) Goats are still\npopular with one clan . The Ravnos insist on\ntheir utility, but I have no idea what they're\ntalking about. Nosferatu are fond of giving\n\n\nblood to alligators for obvious reasons. How-\never, keeping alligators requires sewer access or\na suitable pond, and a lot of spare corpses\n. It's\nnot like you can stick one in the bathtub and\nhope it will stay .\nOf course, your choice of ghoul species is\ndependent on your whereabouts and clan affili-\nation. A Nosferatu has more use for an alligator\nthan she does a goat (unless she's hungry) . A\nRavnos might find a gator on a leash to be\nawkward . Consider your situation, then figure\nout what sort of creature works best for you .\nAnd if you're still skeptical about the whole\nnotion, remember this: An animal ghoul never\nasks for a raise .\nStella di Riganoni\nProprietress,\nThe Pet Seminary\n\n\n \nI\n \n1_iber ties G0\nTee I\nRules for Creating Animal\nGhouls\nAnimal ghouls are highly regarded in vampire society, often more so than\nhuman ones . This is due in equal parts to their unquestioning loyalty and their\ninability to complain. While animals do have certain drawbacks (it's hard to\nget one to change a zoning ordinance), they are unsurpassed in their skills as\nsentries, spies and personal guards . However, animals aren't as intelligent as\nhumans ; players should not choose animal ghouls as characters .\nAnimal ghouls can be used for protection in a haven, and as agents for\ngathering intelligence. However, keep in mind that ghouled animals can be\neasy to recognize . Most vampires will become suspicious of oddly curious\nanimals that hang around too much . With that in mind, be prepared to lose\nan animal that your character brings to an evening's event\n.\nLogistics\nTo simulate an animal ghoul at your side, make up a card that lists the\nanimal's Traits and wear the card prominently when the creature is with you\n.\nStuffed animals can be used to represent small ghouls (although a teddy bear\nmay cause you to be mistaken for a Malkavian) . Even these should have stars\npinned to them to indicate their status as ghouls, not toys .\nIf you send your ghoul on a mission, inform a Narrator of the action and\nhand her your ghoul's card . She can assess the difficulty of the task, decide\nwhat tests your ghoul has to pass, and determine what tests others have to\nmake to impede your ghoul's progress . The card should he returned to you\nwhen the mission is completed, unless the ghoul doesn't come back .\nFor example, Bertram sends his ghouled pigeon off to spy on his rival,\nErnest, So Bertram's player talks to a Narrator . He explains what he wants the\npigeon to do, then hands the Narrator the ghoul's card . The Narrator finds\nErnest's player and asks him to make a Static Mental Challenge . He succeeds,\nso the Narrator rules that Ernest notices the pigeon . Ernest knows the pigeon\nis Bertram's, but isn't worried about it and does nothing . The next time the\nNarrator sees Bertram's player, he returns the card and provides rudimentary\ninformation on what the pigeon saw .\nNarrators shouldn't drop everything to run ghoul missions - animals\naren't likely to take the shortest route between two points, and may not do\nthings in a hurry .\n104\n1\n\n\nCommon Sense\nA note to players : Do not bring your pets to an event, even\nif your character has a ghouled pack of combat-trained Great\nDane-schnauzer crossbreeds . It's too dangerous for the players\nand your pet . And no, we're not even going to mention the\nproblems that a lack of facilities might create .\nAnimal Ghoul: (3-5 Trait Merit)\nThis Merit may he purchased after gameplay begins (hut the ghouling of\nthe animal must be roleplayed ) . The would-be Regnant must possess interme-\ndiate Animalism . Otherwise the ghouled animal won't follow commands and\nwill go rogue.\nA 3-Trait ghoul would he a hat, cat, small bird or rodent . A 5-Trait ghoul\nwould be a large dog (German shepherd, Irish wolfhound) or one of the bigger\ncats (leopard, cougar). Vampires who attempt to ghoul exotic species also\nhave to deal with the associated baggage : the care and feeding of large\npredators in between doses of blood, providing enough space for the animals,\npermits, and protests from animal-rights activists . There's more to ghouling\na leopard, feeding it the occasional Blood Trait and announcing a fait\naccompli .\nCreation\nA ghoul should he created according to the rules presented here, and\nbased on the animal Trait descriptions on page 158 of The Masquerade\n:\nSecond Edition. The player adds a number of Traits to the animal's descrip-\ntion equal to his character's rating in the Merit : Animal Ghoul, minus one .\nThese Traits should he reasonable ; gerbils with Brawny x 3 are right out . Next,\nthe Storyteller selects one appropriate basic \"physical\" Discipline for the\nghoul (e .g., Potence) .\nEvery ghoul animal also has a Trait called Instincts . This Trait relates to\nthe animal's natural tendency to rebel against orders given to it . A wild\nanimal has a base Instincts Trait of 8, while a domesticated animal has an\nInstincts Trait of 5 . Rather than take extra Traits for a ghoul, a player can buy\ndown its Instincts Trait at character creation by one level for each Trait\nsacrificed . After ghoul creation, the experience cost is two points to reduce\none level of Instincts .\n1 05\n\n\nI\nI\n106\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nliber\n[ us\nDU es\n∎\nInstincts comes into play whenever a character attempts to command his\nghoul. A Static Social Challenge is performed against the Instincts Trait\n.\nLeadership or Animal Ken Abilities may be used to re-test this challenge\n.\nA ghouled animal immediately acquires the Negative Trait : Violent . Any\nwild animal (use common sense ; wolves are wild, dogs aren't) also has the\nDerangement : Crimson Rage .\nUses and Abuses\nAn animal ghoul maybe used in a variety of ways. A Gangrel with a wolf\nghoul might use it as an ally in combat . In this case, mob-scene rules come into\neffect, and the wolf loans a Physical Trait to its master . A Toreador with a hat\nfor a ghoul might use it to spy on her rivals and watch over her while she sleeps ;\nthe Storyteller should arrange a Static Mental Challenge for the hat against\nan opponent's defenses . The possibilities are endless. However, if a Storyteller\nfeels that these rules throw the game out of balance, she should limit or\neliminate the use of ghouled animals .\nExample of Animal Ghouling\nDan's character, a Toreador Poseur named Octavius, has just attained the\nintermediate level of Animalism . He decides to spend three experience points\nand takes the Merit: Animal Ghoul . He settles on ghouling a vampire hat, after\ntalking it over with the Storyteller . Dan figures the bat will go nicely with\nOctavius' Goth image . The Storyteller is amused by the possibilities and\npotential logistic problems.\nDan and the Storyteller discuss the matter, and agree that acquisition\noccurs through the use of Octavius' second level of basic Animalism, The\nBeckoning. However, as Dan's chronicle is set in Kansas City and vampire bats\nare creatures of the tropics, Dan's character has to spend an appropriate\nInfluence to get into the local zoo after closing, and gain access to the vampire\nhat exhibit .\nIn the next session, the Storyteller and Dan meet again . The Storyteller\nannounces that Dan's attempt to acquire a hat as a ghoul is successful . Now\nit's time to assign extra Traits .\nDan decides to give his hat the extra Trait Dexterous . He also decides to\nbuy down his bat's Instincts Trait to 7 . As the ghouled bat is only a 3-Trait\nMerit, this takes care of the extra Traits that the hat can acquire .\nDan has no choice but to give the creature the Negative Trait : Violent .\nSince this is a naturally wild animal, he also has to give it the Derangement :\nCrimson Rage .\nNow that creation is complete, Dan names his hat Evil and hands the\nanimal's rough character sheet over to the Storyteller . She decides that\nCelerity is the best Discipline for a hat to have . A note is made of this, and\nEvil's stats are transcribed onto a large card which Dan has to wear whenever\nEvil accompanies Octavius .\n\n\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\ni\nNimble\nViolent\nCrimson Rage\nI ibtr acs 0001t\nThe -Pool of Ghouls\nell\n.\nName\nEvil the Bat \nRegnant Qctavius \nInstincts :\nNNNNNNNaoo\nTraits :\nQuick x 3\nDexterous\nNegative Traits :\nDerangements :\nSpecial Notes : Has the Discipline : Alacrity and must\navoid well-lit areas .\nAnimal Ghouls and Experience\nA character may spend her own experience points to buy her animal\nghoul Disciplines, and to buy down the ghoul's Instincts Trait .
