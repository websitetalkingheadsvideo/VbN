      "text": "ABANDON \nALL Hop€, \nYF WHO FNTFR \nHERE \nThe Final Nights are strange and terrible times for the Sabbat. They hurl \nthemselves at the strongholds of their enemies, the Camarilla, with a ferocity \nthat belies the desperation beneath. These are the nights that have been \nwhispered of in the prophecies of the Book ofNod. This has been foreseen as \nthe end times. And worst of all, their most terrible fears - \nof the hunger of \nthe Antediluvians and the horror of Gehenna - \nwould seem to be finally \nborne out. \nRacked from within by fractious sect politics and beset from without by \nenemies of all stripes, the Sabbat pits itself in direct opposition to the \nCamarilla. There is no Masquerade here, no cowering from mortals who are fit \nonly for service or food, no boot-licking to elders who haven’t earned the \nrespect they believe due them. The Sabbat’s children revel in their vampiric \nnatures, believing full well that vampires are meant to rule the night as the \nultimate predators. Even as it battles the Camarilla for territory and the hearts \nof young vampires who chafe under the elders’ talons, the sect glories in being \nthe best monster it can be. \nProphecy and the crumbling strength of the Camarilla would seem to be \non their side. If these are indeed the Final Nights, and the time of darkness \napproaches, the Sabbat should celebrate, but they instead fight with all the \nstrength they can muster. It is precisely because prophecy and fears are at last \ncoming to light that the sect fears the approach of the end times, and why it \ncalls on its strength to the last vampire. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "WHATTHIS \nBOOK Is (AND ISN’T) \nThis book details the innermost workings of the monstrous Sabbat. From \ntheir rituals to the strange Disciplines their members command, from the \nghastly revenant families to the workings of the antitribu, here all is revealed. \nWhat you have in your hands is not meant to be a stand-alone volume. \nThere’s a lot in the original Laws of the Night that you’ll need to play Sabbat \n(such as character creation, Disciplines and the basic rules). Other items, such \nas the elder levels of Disciplines such as Auspex or Obfuscate, are found in The \nCamarilla Guide. You may also find the tabletop Guide to the Sabbat handy \nfor more information regarding the sect’s history and internal chemistry. \nA ERIFNDLY WARNINC~ \nRepeat after me: ‘‘I am not a vampire. I am not a bloodthirsty creature of \nthe night. I do not have supernatural powers. If I ever start to confuse the \nboundaries of the game and real life, I will put down the game and not endanger \nother people.” Repeat this until you believe it. \nConsider this the official “You’re not a vampire - \nbehave yourself” \nwarning. There may not be an Inquisition, but there are certainly mortals out \nthere who will hunt you down if you start believing your own propaganda - \nthey’re called teachers, police officers, clergy and parents, and White Wolf \nsupports them heartily. The major rules of Mind’s Eye Theatre are more \nimportant than ever when playing a Sabbat chronicle. It can be exciting and \nmore than a little scary to delve into the dark parts of your psyche; the problem \nis when art and life start blurring too much. \nThe abyss is definitely looking back at you. Don’t get out of hand. \nWELCOME \nTO THE EAMILY \nWelcome to the Sabbat. Described as an apocalyptic blood cult, a coven \nof death-obsessed leeches, crusaders fighting an endless civil war and a hodge- \npodge of blood-drinking psychotics, the Sabbat is all of this and more. \nFor the Sabbat, to be a vampire means being a weapon in the Great Jyhad, \nan unending holy war on the ancient, cannibalistic monsters who passed on \nthe Curse of Caine during the Biblical nights. The Antediluvians - \nand their \nmindless servants in the Camarilla - \nseek to bring about the end of the world \nand destroy the race of Cainites. The Sabbat rages against this fate; they have \nbetter things to do than die at the fangs of their bloodthirsty sires. The world \nbelongs to them, not to the ancient evil that sleeps beneath the land. \nThe Great Jyhad is a matter of the sect against the world. Although the \nmembers of the Sword of Caine aren’t above internecine intrigue, blatant \nrivalry or treachery, in the end the Sabbat must come first. Martyrs and zealots, \nthe Sabbat’s children hurl themselves fangs-first at their enemies, falling upon \non their foes in scores and rending them like a pack of wolves. It’s a no-holds- \nbarred war, and rulership of the night is the prize. \nIn truth, however, the sect is more than this. Though neither mindless \nfiends nor demonic apostates, vampires of the Sabbat do tread dangerously \nclose to becoming such monsters.

      "text": "vampires understand that they are damned, creatures of the Beast. Rather than \nrail against their natures and pine for what they once were, they flaunt their \nmonstrosity: They have become more than human, and are yet cursed for \ndaring to move beyond the boundaries of the kine. \nOf course, this means the sect is as incestuously self-serving as any other \ngroup of ‘‘Kindred)) - \na term of weakness among the Sons and Daughters of \nCaine. In the modem nights, the sect is racked with corruption, festering from \nwithin, yet denying its own collapse with a passion unmatched by other \nvampires anywhere. \nTHE H I ~ H  \nPRICE \nOE UNLIEE \nAt a casual glance, the Sabbat would seem to be a haven for miscreants, \nthugs and cackling, self-indulgent deviants. Such is not the case. Indeed, \nnightly unlife for the Sabbat is so fraught with hellish peril that those members \nof the sect who are psychotic murderers and rapine blood-gluttons have \nbecome so to survive the incredible stresses they face. \nThe Sabbat suffers no end of internal schisms. Elder members of the sect, \nhundreds of years old and perhaps even present at its formation over half a \nmillennium ago, have radically different outlooks from the younger Sons and \nDaughters of Caine. Most young Sabbat have spent fewer than 25 years as \nCainites. As such, the Sabbat is a fractious entity, divided from within and \nbeset from without. The Sabbat does not generally have Cainites who are \nanalogous to ancillae - \nthe sect is comprised primarily of neonates, who do \nmost of the nightly fighting and dirty work, and a handful of potent elders who \nhave managed to turn the sect to their own ends by indoctrinating the young \nCainites and convincing them to serve their whims. This isn’t to say that the \nelders don’t believe in the grand struggle, but rather that they observe it as it \nsuits them. Elders of five centuries have too much at stake to risk fighting \nagainst the Antediluvians personally. Better to hurl a pack of howling \nneonates at their enemies and survive to continue the war on another night. \nHypocrisy plays a great role in the Sabbat. The sect is simultaneously \nrighteous and venal, spiritual and base, patriotic and selfish. A Sabbat Cainite \nmay have no qualms about hunting and destroying a Camarilla Kindred for his \noblivious service to the Ancients - \nbut it may have to wait until after she’s \nfinished gutting the mortal vessel who accidentally strayed across her path. \nLike a late-era Rome, the Sabbat has a strong, consistent philosophy that \nindividual corruption all too often pushes aside. \nTHE \nHISTORY \nOE THE SABBAT \nThe sect’s history prior to the momentous Cainite event known as the \nConvention of Thorns is shrouded in mystery. Some Sabbat claim legacies of \nmonstrosity and predation, wandering the Old World as a death cult. Others \nclaim the sect never truly existed prior to the Anarch Revolt, and instead took \nthe form of roving packs, not unlike the packs of the modem nights. Still others \nclaim that the very name defines the sect’s origin - \na loose confederation of \nwitches and self-avowed monsters claiming servitude to Hell. \nDespite the conflicting theories as to the sect’s origin, one fact remains \nrelatively reliable: The Sabbat came into being sometime after the Anarch \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "Revolt. When the rebellious neonates of Clans Lasombra and Tzimisce \ndestroyed their Antediluvians, the elders knew their iron rule had come to an \nend and that Cainite society would never be the same. \nAfter innumerable bloody skirmishes, the anarchs gained ground on their \nelders and sires. With the victory of the Tzimisce and Lasombra still fresh in \nmany minds, Cainite struggles plagued Europe. Young vampires turned to open \nrevolt, and elders met their ends nightly, sometimes taking their childer with \nthem. Aided by the mercenary Assamite clan, the anarchs left no stone \nunturned in their war on the hated elders. Although no other clans managed \nto achieve the same success over their Ancients that the Tzimisce and \nLasombra did, it wasn’t for lack of trying. \nAs the bloodshed of the Anarch Revolt reached new heights, a critical \nmistake was made: Mortals discovered that monsters loomed in their midst. \nAfter a desperate appeal to Rome, humankind entreated the Pope to turn the \nInquisition against the night-walkers and blood-drinkers that had sought to \nlord it over them for so long. Even more horrifying, the Church agreed, and the \ncombined might of the witch-hunters added a new and terrifying dimension to \nthe chaotic soup that were those nights. The war ground on, looking more and \nmore like a stalemate. \nIn the midst of this, certain powerful elder vampires, among them a \nVentrue named Hardestadt (who had been believed to be the first elder to fall \nto the anarchs), chose to throw their lots together, believing that unity would \ngive them the necessary strength. Under their combined might, the tide began \nto turn. Hardestadt and his collective, called the Camarilla, called for all \n“Kindred” to parley. In the English town of Thorns, the anarchs and the \nCamarilla sat down to a written accord, known as the Convention of Thorns. \nwhich promised to restore order and sanctity to the race of Cainites. \nNot every anarch gave up so easily, however. The treaty offered little to \nremedy the situation that had caused the strife in the first place. Furthermore, \nClan Assamite suffered the brunt of punishment for the war. Enraged, a war \nparty of anarchs and rogue Assamites rampaged through Thorns, leaving the \ntown burning behind them. The sect that would become the Sabbat commit- \nted itself to its immortal course of action that night. \nIn the years that followed, the vampires of the newly formed Sabbat took \ntheir war against the Camarilla. The Inquisition continued to claim victims, \nand Cainites drew lines in the sand to mark their allegiances. The end result, \nthough, was a guerrilla bloodbath. Puppet rulers fell, knightly orders crumbled, \nand havens burned like winter hearth-fires. \nWith the discovery of the New World, the Sabbat saw a new empire for \nthe taking, and the sect flourished while the Camarilla huddled in Europe. \nSoon, though, they faced opposition, as disenfranchised young Camarilla \nvampires arrived, hoping to carve out legacies for themselves away from the \nironbound holdings of European elders. Before long, the Camarilla-Sabbat war \nhad reached the shores of the Americas. \nNot long afterward, the Lasombra and Tzimisce fell to warring amongst \nthemselves for the rapidly depleting resources of the New World. The \ncontinent was huge and underdeveloped, its cities few and far between, and \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Cities \nbecame commodities while the clans fought each other for the dwindling \ncommunities of kine that sustained their existence. During the struggle, the \nCamarilla quietly spread through the New World. By the time the Sabbat \nrealized that they had been surrounded and, in fact, overtaken, it was too late. \nSabbat vampires are nothing if not survivors, however, and despite the \nobstacles of the Camarilla’s encroachment, the sect persevered. Establishing \nstrongholds in Canada (for which certain Sabbat vampires’ ties to the Native \nAmericans proved immensely helpful) and Mexico (where impoverished \nconditions and corrupt governments allowed the society of the undead to \nflourish), the Sabbat effectively blocked in the Camarilla. \nFinally, now painfully aware that their actions had cost them more \nterritory, the Sabbat vampires put their differences to rest... for a short time. \nConvening in New York, which the sect had managed to hold against all the \nbest efforts of the Camarilla, high-ranking Sabbat reconsidered their commit- \nment to the sect’s causes. Not content to merely sign a goodwill agreement as \nthey had before, Sabbat vampires took a long, hard look at what was important \nto the Sword of Caine. An unheard-of congregation of Sabbat committed to \ndocument the Code of Milan, a collection of tenets that composed Sabbat \nideology supposedly since the establishment of the sect. Additionally, the \nassembled vampires submitted a few addenda to bring the code up to date in \nlight of recent affairs. \nDOCUMENTS \nOE IMPORT \nAlthough the Sabbat is predicated upon freedom and the Great Jyhad \nagainst the Antediluvians, politics inevitably find their way into the affairs of \nthe Sword of Caine. Over the course of their existence, several important \nagreements have come to have meaning to the Cainites of the sect. The \nConvention of Thorns, which ended the Anarch Revolt, is seen by many \nCainites as not only the article that resulted in the formation of the Camarilla, \nbut also the Sabbat. The Purchase Pact enforced a previously inconceivable \nunity to the sect after one of its debilitating civil wars. The Code of Milan \nasserted what it meant to be Sabbat, and the responsibilities that the sect \ndetermined should accompany its freedoms. \nTHE CONVENTION \nOE THORNS \nMany years have passed since the start of our current conflict, now called \nthe Anarch Movement. Be it known that on this night of 23 October, 1493, \nthe Jyhad has ended. The time for self-destruction is over. \nThis concordat, bound in the Covenant of Caine by sacred vow, repre- \nsents anunyielding, vigilant truce between the Kindred known unto themselves \nas the Anarchs, the Clan Assamite, and the freestanding Kindred bound under \nthe title of Camarilla. Henceforth, the parties shall be recognized by faction as \nthe Anarchs, the Assamites, and the Camarilla. \nEach of the parties agrees to the responsibility of maintaining peace. Each \nshall lay its censures on any who breech or oppose this sacred Agreement. \nAccounting will be made of all parties for violations by them to either the letter \nor spirit of this Agreement.

This singularity of vision seems to have overcome at least a modicum \nof the sect’s disorganization. Additionally, the sect as a whole is considerably \nyounger than the Camarilla, able to adopt modern technology with a speed \nthat terrifies its stodgy counterpart. Whatever the reason, the sect has scored \nsome astounding coups and become a legitimate contender for the Camarilla’s \neroding power. \nNot surprisingly, the Sabbat exercises a great deal of influence over Third \nWorld nations and the most squalid cities of the world. There, amid the hives \nof homeless and faceless juicebags, Sabbat vampires feed with impunity and \nbuild their own private empires. In modernized parts of the world, the Sabbat \nis careful to cover its tracks. While scorning the Masquerade of the Camarilla \n(at least in theory, if not in practice), the Sabbat’s leadership realizes that the \nthreat of organized and technologically advanced human resistance is too \ndangerous to provoke. Thus, in cities of Europe and North America, the \nSabbat takes some pains to cover its tracks, though its methods- intimidation \nand murder - \nare far cruder than the (usually) subtle machinations of the \nCamarilla. With its limited contact in mortal circles, the Sabbat suffers in \nmodem cities; for now, the Camarilla’s influence in many human institutions \nremains one of their greatest banes. \nNORTH \nAMERICA \nCanada and the United States are perhaps the most successful staging \nground for the Sabbat.

Concerned Sabbat see these cities as paper tigers, however, as the sect’s \nformer supremacy in New York City eroded completely after a successful \nCamarilla coup. Supporters of the war movement hasten to note that the cities \nof Atlanta, Richmond, Boston and Raleigh-Durham have recently fallen or \nare in serious contention. Nightly, the sect tightens its grip on the Midwestern \nstates, hoping to crack the Camarilla like a nut between the combined might \nof Mexico and the East Coast territories. \nSOUTH \nAMERICA \nIn a continent overrun with feudal, balkanized vampiric domains, the \nSabbat holds only limited sway. Most of the Cainites of South America support \nprivate domains backed up by small coteries of influential allies. Although \nmajor cities are always prime targets for the Sabbat, the economics of South \nAmerican countries do not hold the appeal of North America and Europe, so \nthey are often considered secondary targets due to their combined lack of \nfinancial power and (incorrectly) importance to the Jyhad. In fact, the neutral \nattitudes of South America make many of the cities a perfect middle ground \nfor meetings with members of other sects or organizations. When a Camarilla \nor independent vampire needs to make arrangements with the Sabbat, it’s as \nlikely as not to happen here, often rubbing elbows with war criminals, \nexpatriates and other exiles of the mortal world. Sabbat vampires in South \nAmerica are disorganized and fractious. The cities are largely independent, \nand the given presence of Sabbat in any city is usually limited to a single pack. \nAs the home of the elders of the Camarilla and the birthplace of the \nSabbat, Europe is prime ground for the sect’s more subtle warfare. Here, the \nSabbat still fights to overthrow the decrepit “Kindred” of latter nights. \nUnfortunately, the presence of many powerful and paranoid elders makes it \ndifficult at best to besiege cities, and the Camarilla is quick with retribution \nagainst any perceived attack. As aresult, the Sabbat has only limited influence \nin Europe, primarily in Spain and Italy where the Lasombra clan still holds its \ntraditional sway. \nMany of the Sabbat in Europe are quite old; indeed, some vampires \nclaiming to have been involved in the fabled Anarch Revolt still give counsel \nin the Europeannations. As aresult, upward mobility in the sect is limited here. \nDespite the Sabbat’s rallying cries of freedom and equality, young European \nCainites chafe at finding themselves unable to rise in position because older \nand more cunning vampires already hold the reins of power. Eastern Europe, \nwith the Russian territories and the former Ottoman provinces, is almost a \nseparate continent as far as vampires are concerned. Here, the hoary Tzimisce \nply the ancient ways of their clan, some even still existing as feudal overlords \nruling from crumbling castles. Sabbat vampires of the Old World generally \nlook on their compatriots in the Americas with disdain, often considering \nthem crude and barbaric. \n€UROPE \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The Middle East, encompassing northern parts of \nAfrica and some Far Eastern sections of Europe, is an exception to the Sabbat’s \notherwise minimal presence in the Dark Continent. As the traditional home \nof the Assamites, countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia are fortifications of \nstrength for the Black Hand. The shifting allegiances of religious factions also \nmake fertile ground for recruitment; once the Blood has become involved, it \nis often a simple matter to turn fervent loyalty from a holy mortal cause to an \nunholy immortal one. \nAUSTRALIA \nAs a marginally independent territory, the Sabbat finds Australia frustrat- \ning. The princes of the area either pay lip service to the Camarilla or hold \ncompletely independent cities. Consequently, the Sabbat has pushed its \nattacks on Australia, as evidenced by rising crime and political unrest. \nWithout reinforcements from outside, the cities of Australia may soon fall to \nthe Sabbat presence, but many major outposts - \nSydney and Melbourne in \nparticular - \nremain remarkably free of Sabbat influence. \nASIA \nThe Far East remains shrouded in mystery to the Sabbat. The native \nvampires have little or no interest in contact or cooperation, and none seem \nto fear the Antediluvians. Even when using the underground smugglers who \ndeign to transport Cainites (albeit at ridiculously high prices), the Sabbat finds \nitself balked by the enigmatic locals and their disdain for the sect’s ruthless \nnature. Because of Asia’s huge mortal population (primarily in China and \nIndia) and financial markets (Japan and Korea), the Sabbat is quite interested \nin establishing power in this region. Aside from a single agent in Hong Kong \nand a pack in Tokyo, though, there are no active Sabbat in Asia. All attempts \nto gain ground in the region have failed miserably, with agents disappearing or \ndying before achieving any goals. Direct assaults with large packs of cannon \nfodder meet horrible ends as Cathayans seem to melt out of the shadows and \noverwhelm them with powers never seen before. Asia is a deathtrap for the \nSabbat, and the sect seethes with frustration at these failures. \nTHE \nSTRUCTURE \nOE THE SWORD \nOE CAINE \nAlthough it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from the outside, the \nSabbat observes an organized hierarchy. The sect has leaders and followers, as \nit must to be anything other than an anarchic mob. \nLike any philosophical gathering of vampires, the Sabbat is not ruled so \nmuch as it is led. Even the most august Cainites of the sect do what they do out \nof devotion to the Great Jyhad. Leadership among the Sword of Caine, \nhowever, is a capricious thing. At the higher echelons, Sabbat vampires tend \nto lose touch with the young Cainites who make their lofty positions possible. \nAt lower levels of the organization, a ductus’ or priest’s decisions sometimes \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

In the end, the Sabbat’s \nrabid self-sufficiency damns it as the disorganization endemic to a sect sworn \nto uphold freedom prevents it from maintaining consistency. \nDespite their seemingly fanatical devotion to the sect, members of the \nSabbat are individuals first and foremost. Sabbat vampires struggle with the \nsame problems as the other undead. Hunters, fellow Cainites, the mysterious \nother creatures who stalk the night and even savvy kine who catch on to a \nvampire’s depredations all conspire against the Sabbat as violently as they \nwould any other threat. Although they scoff at labeling it thus, the vampires \nof the Sabbat maintain a necessary “Masquerade”; the sect isn’t stupid, and its \nleaders know that they cannot achieve success if the sect falls to its enemies \nbefore it can muster for the Great Jyhad. \nIn response to the need for stability, the Sabbat supports specific titles and \npositions to serve its interests. Any vampire who has managed to acquire one \nlikely has the power, in one form or another, to support the claim. The Cainites \nof the Sabbat also remember slights as vividly as any Camarilla harpy or anarch \ndissident - \nintra-sect politics are no less vicious than those of the Camarilla \neven though the Sabbat pretends to be above such petty matters. Cainites at \nvarious stations almost universally owe some fellow Sabbat favors, nurse \nrivalries with others and manipulate all the resources at their disposal toward \nmaking things difficult for their foes while gaining (or erasing) debts sworn to \nothers. \nThe Sabbat respects these offices, by and large. In theory, this organization \nprovides a foundation for the sect - \nthe hierarchy is supposedly one based on \nmerit and achievement. In practice, however, the structure is only as strong as \nits weakest member. Vain elders sometimes demand near fealty from the \nCainites below them, and young Cainites rankle within the hierarchy of a sect \nthat claims to revile such things. The Sabbat may well be its own greatest \nenemy as many of the battles take place in the cold hearts and devious minds \nof the sect’s members. \nTHE \nREC~BNT \nThe regent of the Sabbat supposedly coordinates the master plan of the \nsect, much like a mortal dictator or corporate president. Supported by a \nconsistory of other powerfulvampires, the regent holds little sway over the sect \nas a whole, however. Young Sabbat often make a big show of rejecting this \nhypocritical figure of authority as elder Sabbat flout her rule for their own \npersonal gain. In the end, the regent may demand service, fealty and respect, \nbut she had best be able to back it up as the Sabbat has no lack of wide-eyed \nmegalomaniacs who would not hesitate to usurp the position for themselves. \nTHE \nCARDINALS \nCardinals have the responsibility of handling sect interests over large \ngeographical regions. Archbishops report directly to them and are, according \nto the hierarchy, responsible to them. Also, cardinals coordinate the Sabbat \nin their own cities - \na city in which a cardinal makes his haven sometimes \ndoes not have an archbishop or bishop. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "T H E  PRISCI \nAs advisors, sages and chamberlains to the Sabbat, the prisci make up the \nmajority of the consistory, the “cabinet” that assists the regent in matters ofwar \nand policy. The title carries no temporal power; these Sabbat are not enforcers \nor warlords. Rather, the prisci offer their unique insight to other members of \nthe sect, particularly the regent, cardinals and archbishops. \nTHE \nARCHBISHOPS \nArchbishops handle the administration of Cainite affairs in individual \ncities, often by wielding this title as preeminent in the city. Most often \nappointed by cardinals, archbishops bear the responsibility for all vampires \nunderneath them, and they must see to the support of the city in the Sabbat’s \nbest interests. Of course, the Sabbat’s best interests are not necessarily the best \ninterests of the mortals of a given city - \nindeed, they’re often quite at odds. \nThus, the archbishop’s position is one of balance: He must keep the city \nhospitable to the Sabbat and yet prevent it from becoming a wasteland by \nallowing the local Cainites to abuse it at their whim. \nTHE BISHOPS \nNot every Sabbat city has an archbishop to oversee the Cainite concern. \nThose that don’t typically host a council of three to five bishops, depending on \nthe city’s size. Like the archbishops, bishops maintain Sabbat influence in their \ncities. Likewise, they lead the spiritual growth of the vampires therein. \nTHE DUCTI \nAs leaders of individual packs, the ducti attend to the operational matters \nof their packmates. The title of ductus is a loose distinction, recognizing the \nmost accomplished member of a pack. They work closely with pack priests to \ncoordinate attacks, grow sect and pack influence and act as liaisons to the \nbishops and archbishops. \nTHE PRIESTS \nPriests are charged with the spiritual growth of their packmates. Many \npriests hail from Clan Tzimisce, but anyone of any clan may become a priest \nwith the proper instruction. As the ductus’ second-in-command, the pack \npriest conducts all of the pack’s rim and sometimes creates a few that are \nunique to it. All packs have a priest; some rare large packs even have two. \nShould the ductus be eliminated, the priest becomes the pack leader pro tern, \nuntil a bishop or archbishop (or in some cases, the pack itself) appoints a new \nleader. \nTHE \nTEMPLARS \nSometimes known as paladins, the templars are bodyguards appointed by \na bishop or greater Sabbat. Although they have no formal organization, \ngaining the title of templar is a great honor for a Cainite. It conveys the obvious \nfavor of a sect leader, makes the individual a symbol of strength in the Sabbat \nand endorses her fighting skills. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "TRUE \nSABBAT \nAs the most populous group of Sabbat, the True Sabbat are members of the \nsect who have proven themselves to their sires, packs or superiors and earned \nthe privilege of continued existence and service to the sect. Once a Cainite has \nreceived her Creation Rite, she is considered True Sabbat. \nTHE CLANS \nAND THE ANTITRIBU \nWhile the Sabbat may have fewer members than its rival sect, the \nCamarilla, those Cainites hail from a greater variety of clans. In nights past, \nClans Lasombra and Tzimisce made up the majority of the sect. In the modem \nnights, though, mass Embraces and new groups joining the sect have skewed \nthose numbers a bit. While the Lasombra and Tzimisce still maintain some \nnumerical superiority, the antitribu or “anti+clans” have certainly come into \ntheir own. \nThese antitribu have turned away from the clans into which they were \noriginally Embraced. Most have no love for their parent clans - \nthe antitribu \nwent their own way, and few harbor any illusions of future reconciliation, \nparticularly with Gehenna imminent. In most cases, the reasons for the clan \nschisms have been lost to centuries of ill will, and few Cainites bear such \nresentment as do the antitribu for their progenitors. \nMore information on them appears in Chapter Two (with the exception \nof the Tzimisce and Lasombra, who are covered in Laws of the Night). \nEACTIONS OE THE SABBAT \nThe Sabbat is hardly a unified entity, as its history, cosmopolitan makeup \nand penchant for personal freedom illustrates. The sect is home to numerous \nsplinter groups who have united under the Sabbat’s banner to achieve their \nown ends (which sometimes correspond with those of the sect) or to direct the \ngreater body of the sect. In the chaos of the Sabbat, it is not unlikely to find \nmembers of these factions among the packs, though by no means does every \nmember of the Sabbat support a faction - \nmost simply support the Sword of \nCaine itself. Nonetheless, these factions claim a great number of members, and \nsome have become integral to the existence of the Sabbat itself. \nTHE \nBLACK \nHAND \nThe Black Hand is best described as a sect within a sect; a unique group \nof vampires distinct from all other Sabbat. The Black Hand (also known simply \nas the Hand or, less frequently, the manus nigrum) is not a wholly independent \nsect, however, as all Hand members are also loyal members of the Sabbat. The \nBlack Hand consists of vampires of many different clans, but it draws most of \nits membership from the Assamite and Gangrel antitribu. It also includes many \nmilitant vampires, for whom clan is often a tertiary concern at best, as they \npursue the Sabbat’s ideal of freedom. \nConceived as aspecialmilitia, the Black Hand is, at its simplest, amilitary \nforce at the disposal of Sabbat leaders. Like a true army, the Hand specializes \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The Black Hand seldom remains active for any \nlong period of time, instead sending small, focused units or packs to attend to \nthe issue at hand. Indeed, very few vampires can even remember a time when \nthe whole of the Hand acted simultaneously at all. Sabbat elders seem to prefer \nthis arrangement, and some secretly fear that this sect-within-a-sect would \nattempt a coup if kept active for too long. Throughout its history, however, the \nBlack Hand has always served the Sabbat with unwavering loyalty. Many \nSabbat credit the Black Hand with the cohesion of the sect through difficult \ntimes. Indeed, the Black Hand remained solvent during two Sabbat civil wars, \nenabling the sect to maintain influence in cities that would have otherwise \nfallen to the Camarilla. \nMembers of the Black Hand bear a distinguishing mark - \nthe faction \nbrands its members with a permanent, mystical sigil on the palms of their right \nhands. Once the vampire receives this mark, she has become a true member of \nthe Black Hand and must heed the group’s call whenever she receives it. \nAlthough members may conceal the brand (which spies for the group often do \nto keep from revealing themselves), they may never remove it. Membership in \nthe Black Hand lasts until the vampire meets her Final Death. \nTHE \nSABBAT \nINQUISITION \nTaking its cue from the mortal Spanish Inquisition, the Sabbat Inquisi- \ntion is a political faction charged with rooting out heretics and infernalists. Of \ncourse, the faction resembles the mortal Inquisition in other ways as well: If it \nlabels someone an infernalist, the accusation is unlikely to be denied, and the \nfaction makes a practice of using similarly torturous tactics. As it possesses the \npower to depose bishops, archbishops, pack priests and ducti, the Sabbat \nInquisition is a political entity as well. It stands on the cusp of becoming a \npolitical tool, but has yet to do so, largely because its members are devout in \ntheir duties and respond poorly to attempts at manipulation. \nThe Sabbat Inquisition has recently doubled in size, from 15 to 30 \nmembers, largely owing to its success. All members of the Inquisition are \nrespected and trusted (and powerful ...) members of the Sabbat. Cells of \nInquisitors travel to all Sabbat-held territories, presiding over trials and \ndeliveringpunishments against accused Sabbat. Despite its success in exposing \ninfemalists, however, the Inquisition has acquired a reputation for cruelty, no \nmean feat among those who willingly label themselves monsters. \nThe Inquisition has unprecedented power, able to move and accuse as it \nwill. Nomadic Inquisitors usually travel in groups of five, accompanied by a pair \nof templars. Although their success leaves the Sabbat better for its interfer- \nence, the Inquisition has made few friends. Many bishops and archbishops \nresent the Inquisition’s presence, as the Inquisitors tend to disrupt the usual \naffairs of the sect and dig up dirt on all Cainites in a given city. Rumors claiming \nantagonism between the Black Hand and the Inquisition rise and circulate \nwith alarming frequency. The Sabbat expressly forbids members of one faction \nfrom joining the other, and some suspect this rivalry has resulted from the \nInquisition’s recent successes coupled with growing complaints of the Hand’s \nimpotence. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "THE \nLOYALISTS \nThe Loyalist faction claims that it is the legacy of the “true” Sabbat, those \nvampires who shook off the yoke of their elders and seized their freedom for \nthemselves. Other Sabbat tend to dismiss Loyalists as anarchists, sociopaths \nand spoiled childer who want the benefits of the Curse of Caine without the \nresponsibilities. \nThe Loyalists’ philosophy is simple: Each vampire is her own master. The \nfreedom to do as one wills belongs to each vampire, whether she wants to \ndestroy the Antediluvians or go on a rampage through a suburban mall. In \npractice, few Loyalists stoop to such recklessness as they know local law \nenforcement would hunt them down, most likely at the behest of other \nvampires who actually value their secrecy. \nThe night no longer belongs to the Sabbat, Loyalists contend. Sect is \nirrelevant given the modem state of affairs; Sabbat packs are as powerless as \nCamarilla neonates or rabid anarchs because of the apathy and antagonism of \ntheir elders. As the original anarchs and antitriibu did in the nights of the \nAnarch Revolt, Loyalists do what they do because they believe they must. \nLoyalists accept anyone into their ranks, and they have no codes or secret \nrituals to identify themselves to one another. \nLESSER \n#ACTIONS \nSmaller in power and number, lesser factions exist among the Sabbat to \nhelp the sect and themselves. These lesser factions come and go, springing up \nalmost overnight and then falling out of favor or being wiped out in some \ngrandiose but doomed war effort. Some of the longer-standing intra-Sabbat \nfactions include the following. \nTHE \nSTATUS Quo \nAs their name suggests, things are good enough for the Status Quo. Made \nup primarily of Lasombra, Tzimisce and key members of the Black Hand, the \nStatus Quo accepts the nature of vampires and knows that change is relatively \nimpossible. The Great Jyhad continues, for better or worse, and shaking the \nfoundations of the Sabbat serves only to distract it from its greater goal. The \nStatus Quo does not want to increase the authoritarianism of the sect - \nits \nmembers aren’t after hoarding power for themselves because it promotes \nrebellion in the lower ranks. At the same time, increasingly unreasonable \ndemands from overly vociferous Loyalists and concerned Moderates serve only \nto agitate other members of the sect, and a compromise must be struck. \nMODERATES \nThe Moderates oppose what they see as increasing rigidity intruding into \nthe sect. Edicts such as the Purchase Pact and the revised Code of Milan limit \nthe rights of individual Sabbat for the good of a few. While not as vehement \nas the Loyalists, Moderates nonetheless oppose the encroachment of “rules and \nguidelines” that have no place among such creatures as vampires. The faction \nrests between Loyalist dogma and Status Quo conservatism, acknowledging \nthe need for order and structure, but not adherence to arbitrary codes that offer \nno benefit to offset their inconvenience.

The time for freedom is \nover, claim the Ultra-Conservatives. Gehenna looms around the comer, and \nit’s time to stabilize the Sabbat, lest it fail utterly. Ultra-Conservatives favor \nstrong leaders and Monomacy, ritually removing weak leaders through duels. \nThe Black Hand seems to be slowly leaning toward support of the Ultra- \nconservatives, but it remains characteristically quiet when confronted with \nthe issue. \nOLD WORLD TZIMISCE \nNot every Tzimisce supports the Sabbat wholeheartedly. Indeed, when it \ncomes to the arcane Tzimisce of the Old World, few support it at all. Of course, \naligning oneself against the Sabbat is a good way to end up facing down a pack \nof self-important rabble who want to strike at the elders for the good of the \nSabbat and all that rubbish, so it’s often easier to join the society yet abstain \nfrom its meetings. Most keep to themselves, maintaining castles on ancestral \nlands like voivodes of old. \nTHE ORDER \nOE ST. BLAISE \nIn Europe during the 14th century, the Church established an auxiliary of \n14 saints to protect the plagued masses. One of the 14, St. Blaise, was known \nfor his ability to heal throat maladies. It became wide practice during this time \nthat devotees would have their throats blessed by a pair of crossed candles on \nFebruary third. Cainites active in the Church found it particularly ironic that \nthose same blessed throats would provide a sacred meal for vampires. Vampires \nof the Order of St. Blaise lead dangerous unlives, integrating themselves into \nthe hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church. Through careful manipulation \nof Church resources and “good works” done at the community level, members \nof the order influence aspects of their cities in ways most Sabbat traditionally \nneglect. By establishing herds in soup kitchens and exempting certain build- \nings from tax status, the Order of St. Blaise expands the Sabbat’s power locally. \nIndeed, most Sabbat cities, rife with murder, rape and skyrocketing crime rates, \nsee an increase in Church attendance, brought about by desperate mortals’ \nattempts to find any salvation they can in the World of Darkness. \nCHILDREN \nOE THE DRACON \nA bizarre knightly order of Tzimisce vampires, the Children of the Dracon \nseem to bear more Hellenic features than the Slavic heritage of Clan Tzimisce \nsuggests. The Children seem to be a cultural division, almost a bloodline, but \nthe distinction is more artificial than a true deviation in the vitae. The exact \nagenda of the Children of the Dracon is unknown, but they seem to be at \nintellectual odds with the rest of the Tzimisce.

If the Tzimisce favor a siege, the Children posit the \nvalues of holding back; if the Fiends support the Inquisition, the Children \nargue against giving any faction too much power. Although this seems \narbitrary, the Children seem to see themselves as the warders of their brothers. \nApparently, sometime in the mists of history, a Tzimisce made a decision that \naffected the entirety of his clan (perhaps resulting in the clan’s odd weakness). \nThe Children of the Dracon have sworn to make the Tzimisce consider the full \ngravity of their actions ... or perhaps atone for them. \nINPERNALISTS \nInfernalists - \ndevil-worshippers, Satanists, followers of the Path of Evil \nRevelations - \nare not truly a faction within the Sabbat. Rather, they are a \nsickness that plagues it. Infernalists have no formal structure as they rarely \nassociate with one another. The business of trafficking with demons is \ndownright medieval- the infemalist is a lone conjurer, dealing withdevilsfor \nhis own forbidden knowledge. The practice of infemalism runs contrary to \neverything the Sabbat believes in. While most infemalists see themselves as \ntaking a shortcut to power, the truth is that they are selling themselves into \ndemonic servitude. To the Sabbat, such servitude is completely counter to the \nideas of freedom to which the sect swears. The Inquisition’s leading purpose is \nthe tracking of these creatures, and woe to the fool whose infernal master \ndeserts him as his foes close in. \nTHE PACK \nVampires are by and large solitary creatures at heart. Sabbat do not \npractice solitude - \nthe nights are too dangerous to face completely alone \nwithout trustworthy comrades. For them, the pack becomes a strange mix of \ngang, family and platoon unit. \nPacks are typically organized with a single ductus to lead the group’s \nnightly activities, a priest to tend to spiritual needs and three to seven \nmembers. A pack‘s purposes may vary, from spying to computer hacking to \nbreaking the Masquerade in Camarilla cities to frontline fighting in the Jyhad. \nThe Sabbat may create some packs for such specific purposes of hunting relics \nor bringing down Lupines. \nFor a Sabbat vampire, the pack is everything. It is a surrogate family, bound \ntogether through ties of blood and reinforced through the Vaulderie. When all \nhell’s breaking loose, your pack will be always at your back. This isn’t to say that \nsuch families aren’t dysfunctional - \nsome packs’ dysfunction could fuel talk \nshows for years - \nbut there is some degree of mutual sympathy that runs \nthrough the dynamic, or they would have no reason to stay together. \nThere are two types of packs -nomadic \nand established. Nomadic packs \nare just that - \noften roaming the countryside in campers, on motorcycles, or \nstealing their transportation when the mood strikes them. Many are on \nscouting missions while others just prefer the freedom of wandering. Founded \npacks, on the other hand, choose a specific city to maintain a haven in, often \nserving the local bishop and keeping the mortals in line.

Packs only use such means during \ntimes of Jyhad, when speed is of the essence and the childer are useful as cannon \nfodder. Away from crusades, the Sabbat take as much care in selecting their \nchilder and giving the Embrace as any other vampire. However, such new \nvampires must prove themselves before becoming True Sabbat. Without the \nCreation Rites, the new vampire is not a vampire in the eyes of the Sabbat: Her \npack may feed from her or order her into battle, and she is generally at their \nmercy. \nRites vary, but a priest always presides (or a higher authority if the initiate \nis an elder’s childe). The sire determines what form the rites should take, for \nit is he who decides if the childe should even receive the rite. Among Brujah \nuntitribu or other violent groups, the rites may be similar to gang-style \ninitiations. The Kiasyd may turn the childe loose in a strange library and order \nher to find a new piece of lore for her sire. A Toreador antitribu‘s rites could be \na masterfully executed flaying or blood-sculpture while a Malkavian antihibu \nrequires the initiate to cast an augury from the entrails of a still-living woman. \nFailure almost guarantees destruction - \nthe childe has embarrassed the sire, \nwho is unlikely to want a reminder of such, but success means the vampire \nbecomes a True Sabbat, another monster unleashed upon the night. \nA SABBAT \nLEXICON \nThe vampires of the Sabbat have evolved their own specialized patois, \nmuch of which takes into account their holy war on the Antediluvians and the \nattendant rituals and practices that follow it. Particularly old Sabbat vampires \neven recall terms and phrases that have long since passed into history. \nAlthough many of these terms are in common use among Sabbat vampires, \nsome of them take on different meanings colloquially, given the lack of formal \ncommunication among sect members.

One notable exception to this rule is the \nLasombra untitribu, who have abandoned the Sabbat in favor of independent \nor Camarilla unlives. Parent clans hold their antitribu in low regard, especially \nthe Lasombra. \nArchbishop - \nA vampire who serves as the leader of a city under the \nSabbat’s influence.

The lists of Attributes, Abilities and \nMerits and Flaws are by no means complete - \nfor more detailed information \non character creation, see Laws of the Night. \nSTEP ONE: INSPIRATION \nArguably the most important step in character creation is the formation \nof the basic concept. Every vampire was once a normal human, after all, with \nhopes, fears, dreams and ambitions. Once Embraced, the character brings her \nparticular views to her new unlife. These strengths and weaknesses shape the \ncharacter’s Traits, capabilities and limitations. The first step in creating a \ncharacter is to come up with a basic idea of the person. Don’t worry about \ndetails now; think more in terms of broad brushstrokes. Create the person \nbefore you create the vampire. \nCLAN \nWith a base concept in mind, determine your character’s clan. Did he \narrive by a mass Embrace (which wasn’t too picky about a particular breed)? \nDid the clan select her for certain qualities (a savage outlook on life? her \nruthless dealings with other people) ?The choice of clan influences acharacter’s \ndevelopment heavily. The clan also determines the sorts of Disciplines, \nstrengths and weaknesses innate to the character. \nThere are few or no Caitiff in the Sabbat. While those born without a clan \nare common (given the rampant siring that occurs during certain rituals and \ntimes of war), they have banded together as a clan of their own- the Panders. \nIf you wish to play a true Caitiff, outside the Pander clan, you will need a very \ngood reason to have been excluded from the “family.” \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Only by \nclinging to a moral compass can a vampire resist the slide into total depravity. \nVampires of the Sabbat feel that Humanity is a lesser path, and seek \nalternate means of controlling their Beasts. The Paths of Enlightenment have \nexisted for as long as many Sabbat can remember, guiding those who follow \nthem away from Wassail. Those who follow these Paths have no Humanity left; \nthe Paths espouse utterly alien (albeit wholeheartedly vampiric) beliefs and \nmorals. The Sabbat insists on placing its recruits on Paths so that they are more \nsuited to leave mortal society behind and accept their new existence. \nAt this step in character creation, decide on your Morality. As strange as \nit might sound, many Sabbat neonates (usually the very young) take their early \nyears still clinging to their Humanity; they simply haven’t had the time or \nexperience to completely cast off all their mortal side, but those who cling for \ntoo long don’t survive long enough to change. However, Sabbat past their \nneonate years are often on a Path of Enlightenment, guided by their priests or \nmentors. Paths of Enlightenment are not for beginning players; they are utterly \ninhuman codes of behavior that demand intense roleplay. Consult your \nStoryteller if you’re unsure what your character should follow. \nSTEP Two: ATTRIBUTES \nNatural capabilities use Attributes for descriptions. You determine your \ncharacter’s natural talents, selecting whether your character is to be physically \nadroit, mentally agile or socially adept. Once you’ve decided on your character’s \ninherent strengths, you should describe exactly the sorts of exceptional character- \nistics she possesses. In your primary area of Attribute development, choose seven \nTraits; in your secondary, choose five; in your tertiary area, select three Traits. \nDetails of the various Sabbat Paths are listed in Chapter Four. \nNEW ATTRIBUTES \nAttributes are descriptors of a character’s natural talent and capabilities. \nIn the Sabbat, some Attributes are considered a good mark of a sect member, \nwhile more “humane” ones are considered a liability. \nPhysical Attributes are the character’s general health, dexterity, stamina \nand general physical capability. The Sabbat values individuals who are good \nfighters, and strong workers. \nA character’s Social Attributes are a definition of her personality, her \ninternal capacity to interact with others and her ability to lead and to follow. \nThe Sabbat typically chooses only the most ruthless and aggressive personali- \nties, bringing hardened killers and other amoral individuals into the sect. \nWhile the Sabbat does occasionally choose individuals who are beautiful, \nsmooth and competent, the sect encourages certain behaviors and morals. \nMental Traits define the character’s capacity for learning and reasoning. \nThe Sabbat typically does not value most types of study, but they do support \noccult education and tactical training. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

A high rating in your Morality Traits indicates that you set high \nstandards for yourself, but you risk losing ground to the Beast even with \nrelatively trivial violations of your chosen morals. Low Morality Traits \nindicate that you are close to losing control to the Beast forever. \nYour starting Morality Trait total equals the average of your Conscience / \nConviction and Self-control / Instinct Traits, rounded up. During character \ncreation, you may choose to lose one Morality Trait in exchange for gaining \ntwo Free Traits. You may do so only once - \nlosing a Morality Trait counts as \ntaking two Negative Traits. Be wamed though, that doing so is a dangerous \ncourse; a low Morality Trait total practically guarantees disintegration into \nWassail, the final frenzy. \nNFC~ATIVE \nTRAITS, \nDERANC~EMENTS \nAND ELAWS \nSome characters have particular weaknesses or shortcomings. Others just \nnever developed in some fashion or suffered injuries that set back otherwise \nstrong attributes. Negative Traits represent these. Though Negative Traits are \nnot required, they can represent a deficiency or injury in your character. \nIn addition to Negative Traits, you can choose derangements for your \ncharacter. A derangement represents some sort of mental instability or neurotic \nbehavior. Taking a derangement counts as two Negative Traits and thus grants \nyou two Free Traits, but you may only take one derangement at character \ncreation (or one extra, in the case of Malkavians, who all start with one). \nRepresenting specific deficiencies or drawbacks aside from inherent weak- \nnesses common to many people, Flaws showcase particular problems. As with \nNegative Traits, Flaws grant additional Traits to the user. Each Flaw is rated in \nterms of its value, ranging from one to seven Traits. The higher the value, the \nmore debilitating the Flaw. A character may total up to seven Traits of Flaws. \nEREE TRAITS \nAND MERITS \nBecause no two Cainites are alike, each character gets five Free Traits. \nAdditional FreeTraitsare eamedfromNegativeTraits, Flawsorderangements \ntaken earlier, or by removing Morality Traits. One Negative Trait grants a \nsingle Free Trait. Aderangement or Morality Trait is worth two Free Traits and \nFlaws have variable values listed individually. For details on how to spend your \nFree Traits, see Laws of the Night. \nPurchasing Merits is one way to spend Free Traits. Merits represent special \nbonuses and capabilities beyond the norm. Each Merit is rated in terms of its \nTrait value. To take a Merit, you must expend Free Traits equal to the Merit’s \nvalue. You can take no more than seven Traits of Merits, total (though some \nolder vampires may have more). \nSTEP EIVF: SPARK \nOE LIEE \nYour character is more than a summation of Traits and adjectives.

What is her political leaning? What Path of Enlightenment \ndoes she follow? Is she involved in the sect’s spiritual side, or is she just this side \nof a rampaging monster? \nThere are two types of “people” that become members of the Sabbat: those \nwho were considered by their sires to be good additions to the sect and those \nwho survived mass Embrace by some fluke. When you start creating your \nSabbat character, take some time to decide what brought him to his sire’s \nattention. Did he happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, or was \nhe watched for several months or even years? Your character’s mortal life can \nbe a good place to begin the character creation process, even if a large part of \nit was purged during his Creation Rites - \nit may help you with determining \nif he was brought in with a purpose or as cannon fodder. \nThe process of Embrace is meant to winnow the weak from the strong. A \npotential member is Embraced, then “shoveled” (slammed on the back of the \nhead with a shovel and buried in a grave which she may have dug herself) and \nthen forced to dig herself out with her own hands. If she survives this test, she \nis considered a False Sabbat member. Traditionally, the period during which \na member of Sabbat is considered “False” is strewn with tests of strength and \nsavagery. These tests serve to drive out any humanity that the character retains \nas well as to teach her Sabbat values. Many False Sabbat do not survive this \ntime of testing, either destroyed for weakness or caught by an enemy. How did \nyour character survive her testing? Is she still False Sabbat, still proving herself? \nEven after becoming Proven, the new True Sabbat must carve a place for \nherself in the local hierarchy. The Sabbat’s pecking order is ruthless, and any \ncharacter unable to stand her ground will be crushed beneath the heel of those \nmore powerful or cunning. Did she have a position, only to lose it, or is she \nuninterested in the sect’s ladders of power? Did she suffer when someone else \nfell from grace? \np OLITICS \nThe political stance a member of the Sabbat takes is no less important \nthan her Path of Enlightenment or clan. Central to this political debate are the \ndual and opposing roles of the two main Sabbat ideals: freedom and loyalty to \nthe sect. The rest are just details. \nThe struggle over ideology continues to pull the Sabbat in different \ndirections and is perhaps their greatest internal enemy, affecting even how a \nparticular Sabbat views status, who she will take orders fromand even if she will \ntake orders at all. Thus, knowing what political faction your character belongs \nto can be as central as her Nature in determining how she reacts to a situation. \nLoyalists represent the far left wing within the Sabbat; in a way, they can \nbe thought of as the Sabbat’s “anarchs.” Loyalists believe that the only way to \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Orders, rules and regulations that restrict the freedom and \nresponsibility of the vampire must be removed. \nThe Moderates represent the vast middle ground of the Sabbat; roughly \nthree-quarters of the sect is divided between them and the Status Quo. Many \nantitribu belong to the Moderates. Many Moderates have contacts with all of \nthe factions and generally have the most flexibility. Neither far left nor far \nright, they believe in balance but tend to favor the side of freedom. \nThe Pander Movement represents what the Moderates could become if \nthey changed their focus from greater freedom to greater power. Not all \nPanders share this mindset, but other moderates from other clans tread very \nclose to their philosophy of convenience over ideals. The Panders focus on \ndoing whatever is necessary to gain as much power and authority within the \nSabbat; if it means supporting the Status Quo one week and allying with the \nLoyalists the next, they’ll do so to save their skin. \nThe Status Quo represents the system of leadership and authority that has \nkept the Sabbat together since the last destructive Sabbat civil war. The \ncurrent hierarchy of the Sabbat is a testament to the Status Quo as it is their \nvision made flesh. The Status Quo literally seeks to keep things the way that \nthey are and work within their current systems, believing that allowing \nmembers a looser rein will compromise the secrecy and security of the sect. \nThe Ultra-Conservatives represent the far right hand of the equation and \nare the smallest faction in the Sabbat. Leaders that are weak need to be culled, \nand Sabbat that break the Code or disobey critical orders need to be purged \nbefore the sect falls to the Antediluvians. \nJumping into political factions during character creation can be confus- \ning, particularly if you’ve never played in a Sabbat chronicle before. If this is \nthe case, consider playing a freshly minted Sabbat (newly Proven or False), and \nlet the game’s action guide your choice of politics. \nPATHS \nThe Sabbat has the reputation of being bloody and nonhuman, and that \nreputation is deserved. The majority of the vampires in the Sabbat do not follow \nthe ethics of the Camarilla, having long ago spumed Humanity in favor of their \nmore monstrous selves. The Paths of Enlightenment, like those presented in \nLaws of the Night, are alternate codes of morality, meant to help a vampire \ncontrol his Beast. While moral quandaries still face the vampires of the Sabbat, \nthey are of a different nature. Listed below is a list of the most common Paths in \nthe Sabbat; more detailed information on these paths can be found in Chapter \nFour. All Paths value Courage, but differ in other Virtues they prize. \nPATH \nOE CAINE \nVirtues: Conviction and Instinct \nComprised of ancient scholars and mystics, the Path of Caine seeks for the \nkeys to the enigma of vampiric existence, believing Caine to be the progenitor \nand paragon of all vampires. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Abilities aid the outcome of actions, give the character knowledge \nand an understanding of the world around her and describe how competent a \ncharacter is in her chosen fields. \nThe Abilities listed in the Laws of the Night are all applicable to the \nSabbat venue; those listed below are additional Sabbat-only Abilities. \nBlindfighting \nMany Sabbat games and Monomacy ritual fights require use of this \nAbility. Blindjightingmeans you are practiced at fightingwithout the aidof your \neyes. You’ve learned to use your instincts, hearing and innate hunter nature \ninstead of sight. You may use this Ability to retest in any Brawl challenge that \noccurs in the dark or while blindfolded. \nFire Dancing \nYou can enter a trancelike state that relieves you from Rotschreck and allows \nyou to leap bonfires and burning coals during Fire Dance rituals. You do not get \nnervous around fire if you take the time to sit apart and meditate for five minutes \nbefore encountering the flames closely.

This Ability is vital to being a pack priest: \nUnless the character performing the ria has this knowledge, the ritue will fail. \nThis Ability is not simply the knowledge of such rituals, but is a spiritual, \nalmost supernatural ability to perform them.

This Ability \ncan be used in appropriate Presence retests, as well as in unique interrogation \ncircumstances. Bear in mind that vampires on Paths of Enlightenment may not \nspend blood to make themselves appear more human, and many vampires find \nthe idea of such base acts to be no better than animals coupling (benefits aside). \nBACK~ROUNDS \nSabbat do not receive free Backgrounds at character creation and must \npurchase all Backgrounds. Examples and definitions of character Backgrounds can \nbe found in Laws of the Night, although they will have a slightly different slant \nin a Sabbat chronicle.

While this rejection opens \nup many possibilities for Sabbat vampires, it doesn’t free them from the basic \nfacts of their own nature. Each Sabbat vampire, just like each Camarilla and \nindependent vampire, must keep the Beast in check. Reveling in one’s \ncapabilities as a hunter is one thing; losing all capacity for thought forever, \ndoomed to feed mindlessly until someone destroys the brute that once was a \nvampire, is another. \nHarsh experience shows the Sabbat that vampires retain the need for \nsome code of ethics, principles to guide and limit their behavior. Many junior \nmembers of the Sabbat and a handful of elders continue to follow the Path of \nHumanity. They’re not very good at it, but it does keep them apace or two back \nfrom the brink of Wassail. A great many Sabbat neonates perish in a few \nmonths or years; Sabbat priests often refrain from teaching any Path at all until \ntheir new recruits show signs of surviving to become something more than \ncannon fodder. Some vampires take immediately to a Path with an instinctive \ndrive from the moment of their creation while others never feel the need to \ngive up Humanity altogether. \nProgress on any Path of Enlightenment takes deliberate effort. The Paths \nare supposed to be inhuman. Each one exalts an aspect of Cainite nature, \nhistory or alleged destiny instead of some aspect of human nature. No mortal \ninstinct or doctrine really prepares a vampire to follow a Path. By definition, \nfollowing a Path means not acting in a human or humane manner. \nThe Paths can make real trouble in a LARP. Storytellers must prepare to \nspend some time watching players and reining in self-indulgent acts of random \nviolence and disruption. It’s far more difficult to identify with characters well \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Specific parts \nof various Paths do connect to elements of human experience, but the overall \nsynthesis of each is unique and inhuman. Players and Storytellers who \ncooperate with each other in maintaining an awareness of what the Paths \nmean in practice and thinking about what the events of each scene imply for \nadherents of the various Paths get the reward of an engaging, rich, satisfying \ngame despite the reduced intuitive identification. \nAt the outset, Storytellers must make it clear that the Paths are not \nlicense to run wild. Indeed, the upper levels of each Path restrict a character’s \npower of choice far more than Humanity does. A vampire who commits to \na Path sets aside many emotions, desires and values to pursue a very limited \nset of goals. Paths that include Instinct as one of the Virtues require their \nadherents to enter frenzy, and merely make it possible to maintain limited \ncontrol in some turns. Vampires find, as they advance along their Paths, that \ntheir choices of goals, of friends and associates, and of every other aspect of \ntheir existence become highly focused. The Paths close doors of choice at \nevery step; characters and players alike should think carefully. \nTHE PATH \nO E  CAINF \nFollowers of the Path of Caine, or Noddists, focus on Caine as the \nfirst and perfect vampire. All deficiencies of the Cainite condition stem \nfrom vampires’ distance from Caine. A Noddist has two duties: to study \nevery available scrap of information about Caine and the nature of \nvampires (including the duty to uncover more information) and to apply \nthat knowledge to purging human limitations on the way to achieving \nvampiric completion. \nNoddists believe that academic study only takes them so far. It’s \ngood to read history, autobiographies and the like, but to really appre- \nciate another vampire’s experience requires more. Specifically, it requires \ndiablerie. A Noddist who drains the essence of another vampires gets the \nvictim’s whole essence and sees the world, briefly, through another’s \neyes, sharing another’s memories and thinking another’s thoughts. \nNoddists never undertake diablerie lightly. It’s a sacred moment on the \nstep to unity with Caine’s perfect state; it requires preparation before- \nhand and serious contemplation afterward. \nCainite occultists created the Path of Caine in the 16th century. \nIronically, they drew precisely the sort of inspiration from mortal \naffairs - \nin particular, the Enlightenment and its emphasis on reason \nanchored in historical study- \nthat their Path rejects. The Camarilla’s \nrelentless advocacy of Humanity as the only safe moral code rankled \nthe first Noddists. They had to acknowledge that most Paths force \nvampires into behavior that invites mortal reprisal but didn’t want to \naccept the Camarilla’s solution. Thus the Path of Caine includes its \nown version of the Masquerade while allowing (even encouraging) \nwhat the Camarilla abhors. \nA t  any given time, only a handful of vampires pursue the Path of \nCaine.

They test the \nweaknesses of Light: Anything that they can destroy deserves to perish. \nSince former Cathars created the Path as an actual codified doctrine, it \nbears the name of Cathari.

Cathari vampires fight on the \nfront lines of the cosmic war. They must tempt every child of the Light, \nthen destroy all who prove weak or uncommitted. Private sins don’t \nmatter to the Cathari, only the sins that lead others to fall. Some Cathari \nbelieve that in the last moment of history, the Light will prevail and \nthey’ll be destroyed like Darkness itself.

Other Cathari believe the \noutcome of the cosmic war is in doubt and that if Darkness wins. it \ndeserves to. \nCathari do not kill anyone lightly. An imposed death interrupts the \nprocess of a soul’s collapse from within, unlike suicide, being shot while \nresisting arrest or any of the deaths that come from a falling mortal’s own \nactions. Cathari practice mastering frenzy to avoid strengthening the \nforces of Light with the ill-timed removal of a new recruit to Darkness. \nSometimes a follower of this Path decides, after calm reflection, that a \nmortal or Cainite must die to further the overall course of the war. The \nGnostic then kills deliberately and coolly, trying to derive as little \npleasure from the process as possible.

Bystanders notice them glancing \naround, smelling everything and listening for faint sounds. The Path pretty \nwell precludes involvement in politics; Beasts hold no high offices in the \nSabbat although some make good pack priests. \nCountry Gangrel outnumber all other followers of the Path. Some City \nGangrel who style themselves urban predators follow the Path, along with \nsmall numbers of Ravnos antitriibu, Nosferatu antitriibu and a few in each of the \nother clans. The Lasombra and Tzimisce almost never commit to it, since they \ntake civilization very seriously. \nPhysical or Mental Attributes come first for Beasts. Every Beast learns \nSurvival, Brawl, Dodge and Alertness. Many also study Animal Ken, and some \nbecome formidable at Empathy thanks to their ability to pick up clues about \nmental states others try to hide. Intimidation often follows naturally from the \nPath‘s emphasis on cooperation with the Beast. \nFollowers of this Path find Fortituck and Protean indispensable. Animalism \nis useful to learn from lesser predators and for feeding. Many Beasts develop \nAuspex, Obfuscate and Celerity as well, since all three enhance a vampire’s \nability to hunt. \nThe First Impulse \nSome people turn their backs on civilization in search of an imagined \nbetter existence in the wild. They may gather in small communes or may live \naltogether solitary lives, trying to purge themselves of the taints created by \ntechnology and population. Vampires on the Path of the Feral Heart love to \nrecruit these sorts of people, offering them the opportunity to exist with far \nfewer shackles than any mortal can hope for. In addition, some people who \nmoved happily through life turn to the wilderness after death to separate \nthemselves from their lost existence. The Path of the Feral Heart helps them \nmaintain internal discipline as they cut ties to sources of external discipline. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The Curse makes vampires \npredators with a strong individualistic bias. Unrestrained, they’d destroy each \nother down to the very last Leech. Knights teach that honor - \nthe rigorous \nenforcement of standards of nobility in conduct - \nholds the society of \nvampires together. Honor strengthens a vampire’s ability to resist the Beast \nand provides the rules that allow vampires to coexist without having to fall \nback on the human morality they’ve abandoned. \nThe Path allows no room for mercy or sentiment. Honor is a matter of \ncalculated rational choice. Knights carefully analyze the meaning of the \ncommitments they make and the circumstances they face. Either they must act \na particular way to keep their commitments, or not. If not, they enjoy complete \nfreedom to decide how to act on any basis that suits them - \nraw self-interest \nusually dominates. Knights gradually lose track of notions like “friendship.” \nThey have allies andregular associates; trust plays no part in the Path. Nor does \nthe Path require making any particular commitments, with a few specific \nexceptions. What matters is how Knights keep their word, not which particu- \nlar promises they give. \nKnights make prominent and reliable Sabbat leaders. As long as their \nsuperiors administer oaths of office carefully, Knights serve with less treachery \nor complicated side issues than almost anyone else in the sect. If their oaths \nrequire them to fight, Knights fight courageously because cowardice would \nbetray the spirit of their commitment. If they swear to teach, Knights teach \nthoroughly and make sure their students learn. The problem comes when \nsuperiors offer oaths that don’t require the Knights to restrain personal \nambitions. Knights make great traitors, and rationalize their treachery as \nproviding negative examples of just how important careful definition is when \nhonor ties the society together. \nVampires on the Path of Honorable Accord practice Conscience and Self- \nControl. Keep in mind that this Path‘s version of Conscience does not include \nremorse, only concern for one’s integrity. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Out \nof her sufferings, greater than any we can imagine now, came a unique \nenlightenment. She built a garden of her own and taught herself to master \nthose gifts that God had hoarded for Himself.

Conflicting \nlegends attribute its formalization to various Methuselahs; most stories agree \nthat the key manuscripts came to light in Africa, but no details can be \nconfirmed now. The ranks of Lilins have always been small - \nthey rise in times \nof great crisis, then shrink again as the uncommitted fall away. (A few very \nclever outside observers look for rising numbers of Lilins as a clue that trouble \nbrews somewhere.) The Path prescribes no specificrituals, so every community \nof Lilins develops complex ceremonies of their own. \nThe Camarilla ruthlessly persecutes the Lilins; their very presence raises \nunwanted questions about just how dead and buried the past is. The Sabbat \ndoesn’t support the Path’s teachings but allows Lilins to remain as long as \nthey serve the sect. This policy of tolerance may change as the Path grows \nmore popular. \nLilins trade the knowledge they’ve won. They maintain loose networks of \noccult-minded individuals - \nnot just vampires, but mortals, magicians and \neven ghosts sometimes prove useful. The Sabbat does frown on these ex- \nchanges, and Lilins who share too much risk harsh punishment. The Lilins \noften develop their own versions of rim, with much more pain involved. It’s \nimpossible to catalog fully the range of Bahari practices because they never \nfully discard anything that once proved useful. Enlightenment could strike \ntwice in the same way, after all. \nLilins alternate periods of frenzied activity, when they search endlessly \nfor the next change and the next learning experience, with periods of quiet \nwithdrawal, when they turn inward and try to collate what they’ve learned \nso far. The Path finds some adherents in every social class and group, and \noffers no barrier based on wealth (or its absence), gender or any other \nexternal marker. By the time they’re done, Lilins generally retain few if any \nclues as to their original condition. Sustained torture bums away the features \na vampire began with while deep insights change the vampire’s demeanor. \nMany Lilins, though not all, favor elaborate vestments and props for their \nrituals, and this attention to ceremonial detail is one of the few traits the \nLilins have in common. \nNo clan dominates the Path of Lilith, within the Sabbat or outside it. \nSabbat followers include Tzimisce and Lasombra and unticn’bu from the \nMalkavian, Nosferatu and Toreador clans. A few Kiasyd practice it, as do \nHarbingers of Skulls who refer to their unseen high priestess Lamia.

One of the most common forms of \npower that demons grant to vampires is a unique form of blood magic, and such \npaths and rituals are collectively known as Dark Thaumaturgy. Most Cainites \nrefer to practitioners of this Discipline as infemalists. \nWere a scholar of blood magic to compare the fundamental practices of \nThaumaturgy to Dark Thaumaturgy, she would find few differences. Both are \nforms of magic that rely on the strength of Caine’s Curse and the individual \npractitioner’s vitae to power their effects. The primary differences lie in the \nphilosophy behind the two Disciplines and the source of the requisite knowl- \nedge. Much like a history lesson from a devout neo-Nazi is inescapably colored \nby his perceptions, a blood magic lesson from a demon bears the biases of the \ninfernal perspective on magical workings. With time, this taint affects the \nvampire’s perceptions, his worldview, his physical form and even his very soul \n(which, by this point, he merely holds in trust for his demonic master). \nThe Sabbat loathes infernalists because their ultimate loyalty is not to the \nsect. Rather, it is to the demon with whom they made their pact for power. \nThough an infernalist’s night-to-night actions may be in accordance with the \nSabbat’s goals, his master may call upon him at any moment to act on the \ndemon’s own agenda, regardless of how it conflicts with the actions and views \nof those around him. To an organization whose very existence is based on the \nprinciple of mutual loyalty, such betrayal is anathema. The recently expanded \nSabbat Inquisition exists for the sole purpose ofrooting out and destroying such \ntraitors, and it is very, very good at this job. \nLearning individual paths and rituals of Dark Thaumaturgy follows the same \nlimitations as for Thumaturgy, including the declaration of a primary path. \nHowever, the learning process is marginally easier, thanks to demonic tutelage. All \nDark Thuumamrgy paths cost two Experience Traits for Basic powers, five for \nIntermediate ones, and eight for Advanced ones. All Basic rituals cost two \nExperience Traits, Intermediate rituals cost three and Advanced Rituals cost five. \nNote that Thaumaturgy and Dark Thaumaturgy are incompatible for the purposes \nof sharing rituals and primary path levels - \na character with an Advanced rating \nin his primary Dark Thauwrgy path but only an Intermediate one in his primary \npath of Thaumaturgy cannot learn Advanced Thuwrgy rituals. \nPlayers may not take this as one of their Disciplines at character creation. \nEven if you have every intention of coming into the chronicle as an infernalist \n(and where is your Storyteller if you are?), you must still make the bargain to \nstart acquiring Dark Thaumaturgy. Furthermore, you may not learn simply by \nspending a couple of Experience Traits and calling it a fait accompli - \nyour \ncharacter must petition his dark master each and every time he wishes to \nadvance on his path or learn aritual. Doing so otherwise is to trivialize the dark \npact and the fact that an infernalist is at the beck and call of a demon. \nDARK \nTHAUMATUR~ICAL \nPATHS \nMechanically, Dark Thaumaturgy functions in the same manner as does \nThaumaturgy (Laws of the Night, p. 176).

This is because the Path ofphobos, \nrather than creating horrifying images or inducing artificial emotions, releases \nand magnifies fears that were already lurking within its victims’ minds. While \nthis path is not an overtly powerful one, many cunning infernalists prefer it as \nthey can use its effects as a source of social and psychological leverage. It is all the \nmore powerful because its illusions exist entirely within the victim’s mind, and \nthus Auspex cannot penetrate them as it can the specters of Chimstry. The Path \nof Phobos uses the Intimidation Ability for retests. All powers of this path require \nyou to be within line of sight of your victim to apply them though some effects \nmay persist after activation regardless of where your victim is. \nThe Paeh of Phobos is not without its drawbacks. Continued use of it often \nresults in the infernalist sharing her victims’ unearthed fears. You may use Path \nof Phobos twice per night without any danger. However, on the third and every \nsubsequent use of a power from this Path, you must succeed in a Static Mental \nChallenge against a number of Traits equal to the number of times that night you \nhave used the path.

If you fail three such tests in the same night, you \npermanently gain the Flaw Phobia (Laws of the Night, p. 117).

If you succeed, she is affected for the \nremainder of the scene. While under the effects of Induce Fear, she must make \na Courage Virtue Test against two Traits to take any action that exposes her \nto her unseen stalkers.

It is taught in many forms, and \nthe particulars vary widely. However, the one constant is that the ritual \nrequires some form of sacrifice. Blood, souls, lives and unique material \npossessions are popular as are desecrated holy relics and items that have been \nused to perform acts of violence. The precise sacrifice depends on the nature \nof the demon in question (and is left to the Storyteller’s discretion). You must \nalso know the demon’s True Name in order to summon it. \nA successful casting of this ritual does not guarantee that you have a \nwilling or loyal servant. It only indicates that you have brought the demon to \nthis plane of existence. To bind the demon to your will, you must defeat it in \nboth a Social Challenge (to convince it of your dominance) and a Mental \nChallenge (to impose your terms of service upon it). \nIf you lose the Social Challenge, you do not impress the demon with your \ntransparent attempts at power and it either leaves or attacks you as it sees fit. \nIf you lose the Mental Challenge, the demon returns to Hell rather than accept \nsuch unfavorable terms. If you are unfortunate enough to lose both challenges, \nthe demon drags you back to Hell as it goes - \nmake a new character. If you win \nboth of these challenges, you must then expend a number of Mental Traits \nequal to the demon’s Willpower Traits (see below) in order to finish binding \nit to your will. You may spend additional Mental Traits at this time to increase \nthe length of the demon’s service to you; see below. If you are unable to expend \nthe full number of Mental Traits, the result is the same as if you had failed the \nMental Challenge to impose your terms of service upon the demon. \nIf the entire procedure is successful, your demon is your loyal (though not \nblindly loyal) servant for a period equal to 24 hours, minus one hour per Mental \nTrait you had to expend to complete the binding, plus one hour for every \nadditional Mental Trait you spent.

Bind the Interloper allows you to take control of a demon that \nanother infemalist has summoned, turning it against its former master. The \ninducements you may use to achieve this end are varied, ranging from blood \nto material items to souls, and the precise forms of the ritual depend on what \nyou believe will attract the demon’s attention.

If you cast this ritual on an unwilling recipient, you must \ndefeat him in a Mental Challenge after a successful casting.

Lunatic Eruption is a \ndevastating area-wide psychic effect that triggers a massive orgy of destruction. \nUnconfirmedrumors from within the Black Hand state that one of the Seraphs \nknows, or has access to a master of, this power and has used it as a threat against \nthe Camarilla in recent nights. \nTo activate Lunatic Eruption, spend eight Willpower Traits and make a \nStatic Mental Challenge against a difficulty of 12 Traits.

Other supernatural beings suffer similar effects: \nWerewolves take their war forms and go berserk against any likely target, and \nmagicians and fae revel in the sudden influx of wild power they receive.

Awakening from it, \nhowever, requires you to expend two Blood Traits. While you are under True \nDeath’s effects, you have no access to any Disciplines, even “automatic” ones \nsuch as Fortitude. You do not, however, consume blood nightly, nor do you enter \ntorpor unless you choose to.

However, Din of the Damned affects an enclosed chamber, not \nan individual.

Ahriman’s Demesne allows you to summon a great, billowing \ndarkness capable of destroying all who stand within it. It is unclear if the cloud \nitself serves your will or if some darkling creatures within are your willing \nlegions, but the end result is the same.

During this time, the cloud billows out from your \nhands and eyes and under your clothing, spreading throughout a radius of 50 \npaces like a cold black mist. At the end of the third turn, this entire area is \nconsidered to be under ShroudofNight. At the beginning of each of the next three \nturns, everyone in the area of effect who you wish to destroy must make a Static \nPhysical Challenge against the number of Willpower Traits you spent invoking \nthis power.

You may not invoke this power again for the rest of the night. \nSANC~UINUS \nThe unique Discipline of the Blood Brothers is a product of Tremere \nrituals and Tzimisce applications of Vicissitude that created the bloodline. \nSanguinus allows a Blood Brother to share various parts of his body with any \nother member of his circle. This Discipline is grotesque, to say the least. Many \nof its powers evoke mindless terror in mortals. Any human who witnesses the \neffects ofOctopodor Coagulated Entity must make a Courage Virtue Test against \na two-Trait difficulty or flee in nauseated terror.

Experienced \nBlood Brother circles often leave their weaker members a safe distance outside \ncombat, and these individuals quickly come to resemble quadruple amputees \nas they pass their limbs to comrades in need.

If one member is unable \nor unwilling to spend the Blood Trait, the power does not take effect, though \nindividuals who fail the Mental Challenge do not destroy the entire link, just \ntheir own connection to it.

This path, one of the first developed after the Sabbat’s \nformation, is a directly martial one, which sets it apart from many utilitarian \npaths that happen to have martial applications. It is also a highly personal path \nas its user focuses the effects internally rather than externally, and no two \nstudents of the Path of Mars approach it with exactly the same attitude. \nPractitioners of this path tend to be adept at close combat and often comple- \nment it with knowledge of H a d  ofDestruction (Laws of the Night, p. 183). \nPath of Mars uses the Occult Ability for retests. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

You activate \nthis power with some symbolic gesture or outcry, be it howling a Rebel yell, \nmurmuring a quickmeditative chant, donning astripe ofwar paint or inflicting \nsuperficial cuts on your face and chest. \nFor the duration of the scene, your Courage is increased by one Trait, and \nyou automatically win all ties on Mental Challenges when resisting hostile \nDiscipline effects. However, you are too focused on fighting - \nand winning \n-to consider others’ feelings, and you gain the Negative Social Trait Tactless \nwhile under War Cry’s influence. \nStrike True \nOnce you have learned to harden your will and subvert all weakness, you \nbegin to gain the unity of purpose necessary to ignore all obstacles. This \ntechnique allows you a momentary flash of clarity as you strike an opponent, \nusing your magic to enhance your perceptions and reflexes. Some thaumaturges \ninvoke this power with a martial artist’s kiai or a fencer’s dramatic flourish, \nthough others attack with perfect silence and no wasted motion. \nInvoke this power when making a close combat (bare hands or a melee \nweapon) attack before you make the challenge. You gain one free retest on this \nattack alone. You may not make any other attacks this turn, though you can \nuse multiple actions normally (to move or to ready a weapon, for instance). \nINTERMEDIATE \nPATH \nOE MARS \nWind Dance \nThe clarity of vision that you learned to apply to your own attacks with \nStrike True can now be used to discern the strikes that others make against you. \nThough this grants you no supernatural knowledge of attacks that you are not \naware of, you are much more able to evade those that you can see coming. If \nyou have a “signature” invocation that you use to activate War C v ,  you may \nwell have a corresponding one for this power as well. \nOnce you have activated Wind Dance, you gain two extra Dodge Ability \nTraits for the duration of the scene (which may exceed your generation limits \non Ability Traits in any one Ability).

Though not as potent as the combat transforma- \ntions of Disciplines such as Vicissitude, the advantage of Fearless Heart is that \nits application is largely undetectable. As with WindDance, many thaumaturges \nwho employ this power summon it with more complex variations of the \ninvocations they use for War Cry. \nOnce you have activated Fearless Heart, you gain the Physical Traits \nStalwart, Quick and Enduring for the duration of the scene.

You may \nbestow the effects of War Cry, Wind Dance or Fearless Heart upon any willing \nrecipient by touching her and spending the usual Blood Trait to activate the \npower in question.

This path‘sstudy is a hot topic ofdebate among Sabbat thaumaturges, \nas some Noddists, Bahari and Unifiers believe that claiming mastery over Caine’s \ncurse is dangerously close to heresy - \nor an aspiration to apotheosis. \nMost Sabbat thaumaturges teach Path of the Father’s Vengeance with a \nverbal component. Invocation of any power requires the thaumaturge to speak \nthe portion of the Curse (or a related passage from T h  Book of Nod) that she \nis applying. There is no actual innate power in the words (though some \nthaumaturges claim otherwise); rather, they serve as a mnemonic focus to \nsteady the caster’s concentration. All powers from this path have a maximum \nrange of the distance at which the caster’s voice is audible without mechanical \nassistance. Apply common sense in determining this range - \ndon’t penalize \nthe character if the player has laryngitis. \nThese powers only affect Cainites.

Your raptor has the Physical \nTraits Energetic, Quick x 2 and Resilient. You may only use Auspex through it. \nTo end the ritual, you must touch the bird. You must also put out its eyes \nwithin one minute of ending the ritual or suffer blindness for three nights (note \nthat such an act may cause a crisis of ethics, depending on your particular \nMorality). Some enterprising thaumaturges ghoul their raptors in order to \nproduce reusable subjects who can regenerate their eyes over time. If you do not \nvoluntarily end Eyes of the Night Hawk, it expires at sunrise and you face the \nnormal consequences of not blinding your avian surveillance device. \nIlluminate Trail of the Prey \nBy invoking the spirits of air and earth, you may command them to reveal \nthe trail of an individual who you now pursue. Whether she is traveling on foot, \non a mount or in a vehicle, your eyes perceive the path she took as a series of \nfaintly glowing silver footprints. Your quarry is unaware that you are tracking her \nin such a manner unless she has some magical warning mechanism. Her trail will \nend at the first body of water through which she passes (though passing Over it \nhas no effect). The ritual's effects only last as long as you are directly on the trail \n-if \nyou stop tracking to feed, sleep or make a phone call, the footprints fade. \nTo enact this ritual, you must have astarting point from which to work and \nyou must know your target's true face. While reciting your invocation of the \nappropriate spirits, you must burn a six-foot length of white satin ribbon \nwrapped around a bone from the leg of a predatory mammal. When the ribbon \nis reduced to ash, the trail appears before you. This is not a foolproof method \nof tracking as the spirits this ritual commands are weak and capricious, but it \ndoes give you three free retests on attempts to track your quarry (most often \nusing the Investigation or Survival Abilities). \nMachine Blitz \nFor the most part, Thaumaturgy is hardly technological in nature, but this \nritual stands as one of the rare exceptions to that rule. Through Machine Blitz, \nyou may increase the level of chaos within a mechanical device to the point \nthat it breaks down under the weight of its own complexity. This ritual can be \nused to affect any single machine more complex than a rope-and-pulley, \nincluding both mechanical and electronic devices. \nTo inflict Machine Blitz, spend one minute tracing a series of incorrect \nmathematical equations on the surface of the target device. For this, you must \nuse a pencil-sized wand made of a bone from a mortal who was killed in a \nmechanical accident. If you successfully cast the ritual, the machine instantly \nstops working through what appears to be a normal system failure. A skilled \nrepairman (a number of Repair or appropriate Crafts Ability Traits equal to \nyour number of Occult Ability Traits) can restore the target to function with \na Static Mental Challenge against a difficulty of your Mental Traits. \nRecure of the Homeland \nThis ritual, which many Sabbat believe to be a Tzimisce innovation, \nallows you to create a muddy paste which can assist you in healing even the \nmost devastating wounds.

You may make any amount of this paste, as long as you \nhave sufficient supplies of earth and blood, but you may only use it to heal one \nHealth Level per night. Once you cast the ritual, the blood you use becomes \npart of the curative substance and is no longer considered blood for game \npurposes. Only you may benefit from the properties of this paste- to any other \ncharacter, it is simply a glob of reddish mud. \nWidow’s Spite \nBy constructing a small ceremonial doll, you may inflict a distracting itch \nor ache on a target. This ritual holds little actual danger for its subject. Many \nSabbat use it as a practical joke or a message of contempt, though some intrepid \nthaumaturges utilize Widow’s Spite to probe a potential victim’s defenses in \npreparation for a more devastating magical attack. \nYou must construct the doll yourself, and it must bear at least a vague \nresemblance to your target (no test required, but roleplaying this construction \nis encouraged). When you cast the ritual, the doll oozes a few drops of blood \nfrom the location that you want to afflict with the distracting sensation. If the \nritual succeeds, the target receives the Negative Mental Trait Witless for the \nrest of the night. You may re-use the doll if you so desire, though it falls apart \nafter the second time you fail in casting the ritual. \nINTERMEDIATE \nTHAUMATUR~ICAL \nRITUALS \nClinging of the Insect \nThrough this ritual, you may imbue yourself with a mystical property of \nadhesion that mimics an insect’s ability to climb vertical surfaces. Spend five \nminutes performing stretching exercises, then place a live spider under your \ntongue. You may then move on walls and ceilings at half your normal walking \nspeed. This lasts for the rest of the scene or until the spider dies or leaves its \nplace under your tongue. While keeping a live spider pinned under your \ntongue, you are down three Traits on any Social Challenge that requires you \nto speak well. Naturally, you should simulate the spider through Narrator \nnotification or candy rather than using a real one. \nFirewalker \nThough no vampire in his right mind ever plans to come in contact with \nopen flame, this ritual allows you to prepare yourself for situations where such \nan event might occur. To enact Firewalker, cut off one of your big toes (which \nhurts like hell and inflicts one level of lethal damage) and bum it over a wood \nfire, then smear the resulting ashes on the soles of your feet and the palms of \nyour hands. For the next hour, make a Simple Test for each level of aggravated \ndamage you take from fire. If you win or tie, that level of damage becomes lethal \ndamage. You may cast this ritual on another vampire, in which case you must \nsacrifice one of your beneficiary’s toes. Multiple subjects’ toes may be sacrificed \nsimultaneously in the same group ritual, up to a maximum number of subjects \nequal to your number of permanent Mental Traits. A character who is missing \na big toe gains the Negative Physical Trait Clumsy due to the effect this loss has \non his balance. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

To do this, you must etch the back of the mirror with a series \nof mystic sigils and bathe it in two of your own Blood Traits. \nOnce you successfully enchant the mirror, its reflections reveal all \nsupernatural creatures for what they are.

If you’d rather keep it simple, just use the standard rules \nfor tests associated with each rite. Again, these rules are strictly optional. \nWhen a priest embarks on a rite, he makes a Social Challenge against a \nnumber of Traits equal to the number of participants. When a bishop or higher- \nranked priest performs a rite with lower-ranked assistants, each assistant adds \none Trait to the lead priest’s Social Traits total. If the lead priest ties this test, \nparticipants receive no bonus or penalty during the rite. If the lead priest \nsucceeds, everyone adds one Trait per level of the priest’s Path rating to their \nown Traits for the purposes of tests. This bonus applies to all tests directly \nassociated with the ritm - \nduring Fire Dancing, for instance, it applies to a \nvampire’s Physical Trait total for jumping the fire but not to trying to establish \na psychic link to someone four blocks away. \nIf the priest fails the test, make two Simple Tests. If the priest wins at least \none of them, the rite unfolds as usual. Otherwise, all participants suffer a one- \nTrait penalty on all related tests - \nif the priest is spiritually impaired, how can \nhe hope to lead his followers appropriately? The priest has the option of \ncanceling the rite. This automatically imposes the Negative Status Trait \nUnfaithful, which the priest can remove only by successfully performing two \nauctmitas rim in the future. \nEveryone in the sect practices the auctontas ritae.

Just as the Vaulderie unites members \nof a pack, the Binding ties together all the oath-taking vampires in the \ncommunity. \nThe ceremony begins with a recitation of the group’s interpretation of the \nSabbat credo. Each group does this a little differently. Some work it out in \nliturgical form while others present each point in metaphorical language or in \nthe form of a parable. Military-style gatherings shout out the credo in call-and- \nresponse style. Sometimes the recitation takes an hour or occupies just a few \nangry sentences. \nFounded packs host nomadic packs, where possible, although the negotia- \ntions beforehand to allow safe passage seldom go smoothly (very few occasions \ncould encourage such mutual restraint). Tradition calls for performing the \nBinding near water - \na beach, riverbank or waterfall if possible, a fountain if \nthere’s nothing else.

All Sabbat members who can attend the Blood Bath \ndo so; avoiding it unnecessarily may strike the new leader as an insult. Each \nparticipant in the ritus steps forward, kneels to the new leader, expresses praise \nfor or confidence in the recipient and offers blood into a common vessel. The \nleading priest acts first, followed by attending sect leaders and then by \neveryone else present. The vampire receiving the new title offers a response of \npraise or advice to each vampire present, emphasizing her wisdom and how she \nbenefits the Sabbat.

The \nguests dine on the blood of captured men and women suspended over a dining \ntable, bound to statues or otherwise immobilized. \nPreparations begin well before the feast. For several nights before the feast, \na specially constituted hunting party rounds up humans (and, when the \nopportunity arises, vampires outside the Sabbat). It’s an honor to be chosen to \ntake part in the hunt, and it takes great self-restraint to deliver the captured \nprey alive and as unharmed as possible. The hunters present their prey along \nwith demonstrations of martial prowess and boasts of their exploits to the \nhighest-ranking Sabbat member present. She receives each victim and gives \nthe vampire who brought the victim a kiss of thanks of the forehead. Vampires \nthen secure the prey safely until the night of the Blood Feast. \nOn the night of the feast, ghouls or low-ranking vampires arrange the prey \nat the Blood Feast’s location. The nature of the meal makes tardiness a grave \noffense against hospitality; guests arrive early or on time.

Each member of the pack-to-be gets drained and buried as if the victim \nof a shovel party, and must dig her way out. With the benefits of vampiric \nstrength, a vampire undergoing re-creation must win or tie two out of three \nSimple Tests with the Narrator (rather than having to win two out of three). \nLike a mortal in the same situation, the vampire can spend Physical Traits for \nretests. When (and if) all the members of the pack emerge, their designated \npriest brands himself and the other members of the pack and leads them in a \nVaulderie. Since there’s always the risk of losing vampires in this process, \nbishops in areas of active conflict or reduced numbers of members frown on the \npractice. \nTHE \nEESTIVAL OETHE DEAD \n(EESTIVO DELLO \nFSTINTO) \nThe Festival of the Dead occupies the entire second week of March; it’s \nsecond only to the Grand Ball as an opportunity for participants to celebrate \ntheir trans-human abilities. All the Sabbat vampires in a city gather, setting \naside usual disputes for the week of the Festival, and nomadic packs come into \ntown to celebrate with their urban brethren. \nThe Festival begins as soon as the highest-ranking priest in town declares \nit underway. He gives a single instruction to the assembledparticipants: Revel. \nThis i s  the time for vampires to set aside their normal restraints and find out \njust what they can do to themselves, to each other and above all to the mortals \naround them. Each night includes a Blood Feast and a celebration of the \nVaulderie after the night’s exertions, scheduled as late as possible given the \nneed of the participants to settle down for the day. \nIn principle, the Festival’s participants should act utterly without regard \nfor anyone’s concerns but their own. In practice, the world is still there even \nwhile vampires celebrate. The Sabbat uses the Festival partly to weed out the \nvampires who cannot distinguish between the freedom to choose their own \ncourse of action and consequences to their choices. Vampires who bring out \nmortal hunters or other supernatural beings in response to Festival behavior \ndeserve what they get, the sect’s teachers say. \nFestival events vary widely. Fire Dancing takes place almost everywhere, \noften coupled with dances pairing vampires with unwilling mortal partners. \nPacks whose members know Necromancy often raise zombies to provide \naccompaniment. In many cities, packs compete to present reenactments of \npassages from the Book of Nod and Sabbat history. Vampires who fancy \nthemselves great hunters set out on special hunts, going after specific sorts of \nvictims - \nteen mothers, bald priests, married computer programmers or some \nother specialized category of mortal. Vampires with experience in butchery, \nsurgery and the like oversee competitions to kill victims with a minimum of \nblood spilled or to remove of as many internal organs as possible while keeping \nthe victim alive and conscious. \nPresiding archbishops and bishops watch the various competitions and \naward victors with the right of drawing first blood at the next Blood Feast.

Elders look with favor on competitions \nto hunt as widely and freely as possible without attracting mortal attention. \nSuccess in this sort of challenge requires developing and presenting a plausible \ncover story, such as a terrorist attack. The Sabbat hierarchy admires and \nrewards the ability to use mortal institutions without becoming tangled in \nmortal values or concerns like the Camarilla. \nSystem: Resolve the various competitions as seems appropriate. The \nFestival is as much an occasion for roleplaying as for number-crunching. Note \nthat many Festival sports require a fair number of Storyteller mortal characters, \nso plan ahead to have enough Narrator support. \nEIRE DANCE \nFire is one of the great enemies to vampire, a danger to flee. The Sabbat \nbelieves in mastering that fear. In times of war, Sabbat vampires use fire as a \nweapon against their enemies. In between battles, they perform the Fire Dance \nto show their triumph over the weaknesses in their souls. \nA priest can call a Fire Dance at any time, whenever she judges the pack \nin need of some morale boosting. Bishops generally celebrate a Fire Dance just \nbefore a War Party, bringing together all the packs who will fight in the \nupcoming assault. Given the Sabbat’s emphasis on individual freedom, the \nconvening priest never forces a vampire to take part in the ritus until she feels \ntruly ready for it. Most vampires somehow find the resolve to participate \nanyway; their packmates do not tolerate cowardice, and too many refusals of \nthe Fire Dance can get a vampire exiled or destroyed. \nThe convening priest lights a bonfire somewhere away from mortal eyes. \nParticipants set a rhythm with drumming, chanting or other regular music. \nThey circle the fire, working themselves into a trancelike frenzy. They close \nin on the flames until primitive instinct forces them away; some make \nobeisance to the fire as if it is a god they hate but still venerate. As each \nparticipant feels ready, she jumps through the flames. The more vampires make \nit through, the more they encourage (and challenge) the remaining partici- \npants to do so. Particularly devoted or entranced vampires jump again and \nagain; some perform the most exotic stunts along the way. The n’tus ends when \nevery vampire has jumped. \nSometimes a vampire simply can’t muster the courage to jump. Tolerant \npacks throw him through so as to honor the spirit of the occasion. Less tolerant \npacks slaughter him as an inferior breed or pin him down in the fire to help him \novercome his weakness. \nSystem: Once the fire’s started and the revels begin, participating vam- \npires must make a Courage test against two Traits to approach the fire. (Their \ntrance state reduces the normal difficulty.) Actually jumping through the fire \nrequires a Static Physical Challenge against five Traits. The Storyteller should \nincrease the difficulty of complex maneuvers; if they work, the participant \ngains one or more bonus Social Traits for the rest of the night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Use \nyour imagination to capture a sense of the experience without the prop of real fire. \nThe Sabbat glorifies achievement. Thinking grand thoughts doesn’t mean \nanything without action. Therefore, the ceremonial demonstration of one’s \nphysical, mental and social prowess is a religious act. The label “Games of \nInstinct” applies to all competitions in which participants compete against each \nother and the surrounding world in ways that exemplify the Sabbat’s ideas. \nNote that Games of Instinct do not include random carnage for its own sake. \nThe Sabbat does not believe in the Masquerade as a goal, but sect leaders aren’t \nstupid and know that there are very firm limits to how far vampires can go \nwithout bringing down massive reprisals. The Sabbat does not value stupidity \nand won’t reward it, let alone treat it as a matter of spiritual importance. \nThe priest presides over each game, blessing the participants and instructing \nthem in the terms of this particular game. The practice should resemble the \nancient Olympic games in which participants demonstrated physical excellence \nas an act of worship. The games are vigorous, enthusiastic and often bloody, but \nnever frivolous. Holy joy in one’s superiority is far more than simple bloodthirst. \nSystem: The specific mechanical aspects of a Game of Instinct depend on \nthe nature of the game. All games share a specific feature. The winners of a \ngame get a one-Trait bonus to one Ability they used during the game. This \nbonus lasts for two weeks of game time. A vampire can only enjoy this benefit \nfor one Ability at a time, no matter how many games she participates in. \nC~AMFS OP INSTINCT \nSome examples of common Games of Instinct: \nCapture the Ductus. This game pits two packs against each other. The \npriest designates territory, generally a few square blocks. Each pack aims to \npresent the ductus of the other to the priest; the first pack to do so wins. \nInflicting Final Death on any participant automatically costs the destroyer’s \npack the game (plus the rage of the offended pack). The priest has discretion \nin setting boundaries for mortal awareness. Particularly challenging games \nrequire that no mortal ever know the game’s being played while other times, \nfor games of terror, the priest actively condones displays of vampiric power. \nThe Rat Race. At the beginning of the game, participants unleash one \nor more humans in a bounded, labyrinthine space -an actual maze, a factory \ndistrict or someplace else with complex terrain. The humans get piles of \nweaponry capable of actually hurting the vampires. Then the vampires go in \nunarmed and hunt the humans. Each vampire who drains a human wins. It’s \n“legit” to cripple or maim competing vampires, but not to torpor or destroy \nthem. A more extreme form of this game requires vampiric participants to draw \nstraws, with the one who gets the short straw becoming the designated victim. \nThe vampiric variety seldom proceeds to Final Death except as a punishment \n(in which the draw of straws is usually rigged). \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The burners hold an exotic mix of herbs and \nchemicals designed to weaken mortals’ willpower and skepticism and induce \na mild hallucinogenic state in which acquiescence and belief come easily. As \nshe blesses each burner, the priest adds a Blood Trait of her own to start the \nmix’s transformation. \nThe first part of the Grand Ball takes place in public, often staged as a \nfestival, a rave or some other gathering open to the general populace.

Caine’s murder of Abel outstrips all other topics in \npopularity, with the diablerie of the Tzimisce and Lasombra Antediluvians \nclose behind. Gehenna scenes attract both favor and controversy, with some \nelders (and devout neonates) arguing that too much attention to future \ntroubles undermines morale. Most theatre groups include some element of \naudience participation, seizing prepared targets for use as disposable props. \nAfter the show, the archbishop or ranking bishop present receives the \nBlood Bath. The recipient reclines in a tub, pool or other large container. \nAttendants bleed out selected victims to fill the pool. Each vampire present \ncontributes vitae to a Vaulderie cup, whose contents then join the mortal \nblood. The recipient maintains a steady chanting all the while, and takes in a \nbit of the essence of the other participants. \nAt the conclusion of the Blood Bath, the participants join the bath‘s \nrecipient in a final pre-dawn dance, generally very noisy and almost always \nending in a frenzied attack on the unfortunate mortals saved for the consum- \nmation of the rim. In most cases, the participants collapse in the ball’s private \nspace and rely on ghouls to take care of guarding them and cleaning up during \nthe following day. Over the next several days, vampires and ghouls charged \nwith attending to the aftermath use a combination of lethal force, mental \nDisciplines and occasional Embraces to tidy up loose ends. \nSystem: Grand Ball participants gain the benefits of the Blood Feast and \nBlood Bath as usual. In addition, they completely replenish their Willpower. \nEach participant must contribute at least one Blood Trait to the cloaking \nincense burners, and may contribute more.

Strong leaders and strong \nfollowers keep the sect strong as well. \nMonomacy is a genuine rim, not a right anyone can claim on their own. \nThe Sabbat denies the opportunity to young, unproven recruits who don’t \nappreciate the gravity ofwhat they’re doing. If everyone could get their leaders’ \nblessings for the sacred duel, in short order most packs would lose all their \nmembers over trivial matters. The pack priest must formalize any effort at \nMonomacy. The challenger presents her claim to the priest and the target \nsimultaneously. The priest decides whether the point of conflict warrants \nMonomacy, and if so, whether the priest will preside himself or appoint a \nsubstitute. If the priest is himself the challenged party, the ductus presides or \nrefers it to another pack‘s priest. \nThe defender doesn’t have to accept just because the priest approves. \nDeclining involves some loss of status, since bystanders assume cowardice or \nsome shameful secret must contribute to the refusal to take part in an \nimportant ritus. The defender encounters fewer hassles if the challenger is of \nmuch lower rank. Leaders can brush off even genuinely serious claims as just \nanother case of a youngster being uppity. \nWhen the challenger and defender belong to the same pack, it’s easy to \npick the right authority to arbitrate: Their pack priest does the job. Matters get \nmore complex when the disputing parties belong to different packs. In theory, \na bishop should hear such cases. In practice, most bishops feel they have better \nthings to do with their time and respond unfavorably to all but the most urgent \nor illuminating claims. Rivals often do better to seek out the priest of a third \npack, preferably but not always one they both know, and ask him to perform \nthe ritus. \nThe definition of the ritus leaves the setting and method of combat open. \nAs long as it satisfies the participants and the overseeing priest, it’s fine. The \nchallenger sets the time and place; the defender rules on weapons and other \ndetails. The defender can ask for the duel to be to first blood rather than Final \nDeath. In such a case the loser faces exile. A defender who takes such a wimpy \ncourse of action loses respect whether he loses the duel or not. More impressive \nrestrictions include fighting while blindfolded, fighting surrounded by fire, \nfighting only with out-of-clan Disciplines and the like. The priest declares the \nduel begun and finished. Priests and archbishops can declare a Monomacy null \nand void, but doing so for any reason short of proof of direct cheating by a \nparticipant invites new Monomacy-worthy challenges against the priest. \nSometimes Monomacy takes on strange forms. Lasombra elders may \nchoose to duel with life-sized chessboard populated by living pieces, moved by \nthreat or command.

Rumor says that the current \nregent took her position after besting her predecessor in a simple no-weapons \nphysical battle. \nSystem: This ritus calls for very little mechanical adjudication. The form \nof the fight itself suggests what sorts of challenges the participants should \nmake. The priest’s player should emphasize the seriousness of the occasion \nwith proper pomp and circumstance. This isn’t just a rumble, it’s a rumble with \nprofound religious significance. Whatever theme and style a pack presents - \nurban gang, enthusiastic cult, disciplined military team or something else - \nshould color the proceedings.

Among the vampires who care \nenough to argue theology, some treat Caine as the biggest, oldest and therefore \nworst menace of all, while others find in him the example of true freedom and \nindividuality. Vampires who do care about origins and do take Caine as their \ninspiration gather regularly to listen to teachings about him. This ritus renews \ntheir conviction and provides them with the shared attitudes and ideas to \nresolve disputes. \nIn some packs, the priest always delivers the sermon. In others, pack \nmembers share the duties. Each one in turn recites some favored passage from \nthe Book of Nod and offers comments about its relevance to the pack‘s \nsituation. Depending on the pack‘s preferences, the speaker may get an \nuninterrupted audience, or the rest of the pack may argue back. After the \nsermon, the priest may perform the Vaulderie. Enthusiastic pack members may \ncontinue the “discussion” until the approach of dawn. \nVampiric society has very few written records. The Book of Nod isn’t a \nsingle text - \nit’s a mass of fragments and an attitude about Cainite origins. \nSabbat packs argue constantly about the best, truest or oldest phrasing of a \npassage, and about whether a passage belongs in canon at all. Some believers \nargue that the sect must establish a single authoritative reading and make sure \neveryone studies it. Others claim, with just as muchfervor, that the spirit of the \nwork transcends any specific text, so competing searches for illumination serve \nthe sect’s best interests. Arguments on these points sometimes destroy packs \nand fuel inter-pack wars. \nSystem: This ritus doesn’t really require any mechanics. If Storytellers \nwant, they can ask for Performance tests to see how effectively a speaker \ncommunicates her point. Regular exposure to the Sermons of Caine might \nraise a participant’s Sabbat Lore, up to a limit of one or two levels less than that \nof the pack priest.

The Blood Bond as Camarilla and independent vampires use it binds \nthe subject as the slave of his regnant. It reinforces the static hierarchy of elder \nover childe. The Vaulderie makes the participants equal, uniting them in their \nshared cause. It also introduces a constantly shifting mosaic of relationships as \nthe vampire who held another in highest esteem last night has a new target of \nsupreme devotion tonight. The bonds don’t erode; they do gain rivals of equal \nor greater intensity. \nSimply mixing vitae isn’t sufficient for the Vaulderie.

Priests \ngenerally decorate their tools with hieroglyphics and artwork that expresses \ntheir pack concerns. (Artisans who produce tools that express a pack‘s shared \nsense of self gain high status. The Sabbat never has enough creators to match \nits ranks of corruptors and destroyers.) \nThe priest takes her ritual tools, makes a cut in herself and drains out as \nmany Blood Traits as she cares to contribute. Once the priest begins the \nceremony, she passes the cup and tool to each participant in turn, who \ncontributes as many Blood Traits as he chooses. \nContributing only one Blood Trait looks bad - \ndo you have something \nto hide? Contributing five or more Blood Traits, except when duty requires, \nlooks bad, too - \nare you angling for control? The ductus must contribute at \nleast one Blood Trait per participant (down to a minimum of one Blood Trait \nremaining), and generally aims to put in more than anyone else as a show of \ndedication and primacy of place. Trying to put in someone else’s blood, from \na concealed pouch or other source, doesn’t work. The cup erupts and splashes \nthe blood everywhere. Everyone loses the blood they put in. The priest must \nstart the ritual again, and the offender probably faces swift destruction. \nThe priest takes the filled cup and performs a simple ritual over it that \nmerges the blood together.

If you want to work with religious themes, \nchoose your place carefully. Don’t freak the bystanders and people not taking \npart. Save the funky stuff for private spaces. \nThe first time a vampire takes part in the Vaulderie, she gets a Vinculum \nrating of 1 toward every other participant, plus one for each Blood Trait she \ndrank that belonged to a particular individual. In later performances of the \nVaulderie, she makes a Static Challenge of her current Vinculum rating \ntoward a particular individual against a total of one plus the number of Blood \nTraits she drank that belonged to that individual this time. If she loses the \nchallenge, her Vinculum rating toward that individual rises by one. If she ties, \nher Vinculum rating remains the same. If she wins, she can (at her discretion) \nmake two Simple Tests. If she wins both, her Vinculum rating toward that \nindividual falls by one; otherwise it remains the same. Her Vinculum rating \ntoward a fellow participant in this Vaulderie can never fall below 1. The player \ncannot spend Willpower or Traits for retests in these challenges. \nOptionally, you may simplify proceedings. You can have each player test \nfor her character’s Vinculum rating toward everyone involved in the ritus by \na single Static Challenge against the highest total of Blood Traits she drew. \nKeep in mind that this cuts out many layers of inter-personal intrigue that give \nSabbat games an important part of their flavor. Discuss it with players before \nadopting it. \nVinculum ratings don’t fade over time. Only a feat of will in the \ncelebration of the Vaulderie lets a vampire break some of her ties to others. \nPacks that regularly celebrate the Vaulderie develop very close ties, and the \nSabbat’s elders retain a network of deep connections to each other. Rumor \nattributes a Vinculum-breaking ritual to Nosferatu untitribu, the Sabbat \nInquisition or both. Allegedly, the Inquisition uses it to break ties between \nloyal Sabbat members and infemalists, but it is considered rumor at this point. \nA character attempting to destroy another vampire to whom he has any \nVinculum rating at all must spend two Willpower Traits. Acting less termi- \nnally against the interests of a vampire to whom he has a Vinculum rating of \nthree or more requires spending one Willpower Trait, and acting against a \nVinculum rating of six or more requires two Willpower Traits. The only \nexception is Monomacy performed under the supervision of an approved \nSabbat official. \nWhen a character with Vinculum ties to several individuals faces a choice \nbetween them, she draws on the Vinculum to settle her conflicting impulses. \nShe makes an Extended Challenge of her Willpower against each of the \nVinculum ratings involved (adding two to her Willpower when testing for the \nindividual she favors most). Whichever individual wins the most successes in \nthe challenge gets her loyalty in that situation. She may also simply go with \nwhomever she has the higher Vinculum rating for, especially if the difference \nis two or greater. \nThe Vaulderie gradually breaks down blood bonds. A vampire seeking \nrelease from bondage must put in at least six Blood Traits and reduce himself \ndown to one Blood Trait remaining.

Doing this three times, therefore, completely breaks a blood bond (and \ngenerates very strong Vinculum ratings). \nWAR PARTY \nThe War Party puts Sabbat doctrine to practical use. Multiple packs \ncompete for the blood of a designated non-Sabbat elder, with the winners \ngetting the benefits of diablerie. Hunting elders isn’t easy - \nthey generally \ndidn’t survive all those centuries by being careless or stupid, after all. In \naddition, while rival packs seldom use outright lethal force against each other, \nthey can and do sabotage each other’s efforts with means that stop short of \ndestruction. \nA Sabbat member of bishop or higher rank declares a War Party after \nidentifying an elder whose removal would benefit the sect. (Almost every non- \nSabbat elder poses a threat to the sect in some sense.) Preparations usually \ninclude a Fire Dance, a Sermon of Caine and a Blood Feast or Vaulderie. The \nchief of the War Party - \nusually the highest ranking priest involved, though \nsometimes ducti or bishops lead more politically oriented hunts - \naddresses \nthe assembled packs. He asks each ductus one of the few ritual questions that \nactually has a standard phrasing throughout the sect: “DO you come freely to \nwar, and do you take up this noble cause, never resting until the blood of our \nenemy is spilled?” Each ductus answers with “We do!” After this expression of \ncommitment, the War Party leader identifies the target and presents informa- \ntion that might help the hunt. \nA ductus can decide to withdraw her pack from the challenge. She faces \nridicule for this, and any packmates who call for Monomacy generally win \napproval on the spot. The packs who remain celebrate the rest of the night and \nembark on the hunt itself after rising from sleep on the following night. \nThe War Party makes every tactic legitimate if not automatically wise. \nHunting packs can inflict whatever collateral damage they deem necessary on \ntheir way to the target, and when the destructive action shows courage and \nforethought, packs not participating in the War Party often help clean up the \ndamage. In the final approach to the target’s haven, competing packs often \ndispense with niceties like doors if they have members with the strength to \nbreak through barriers. Note that sometimes, brute force is very unwise. A \nwell-protected target calls for approaches emphasizing stealth and treachery. \nSome War Parties last for weeks or even months rather than a few violent \nnights. \nOnly one member of the winning pack gets the full benefit of the diablerie, \nof course. Sabbat tradition generally recognizes success, and awards the kill to \nthe first vampire to get her fangs into the victim. Pack members need not sit \nidly by, however. Tradition also endorses vigorous competition, and it’s not \nuncommon for a hunt to end with only one pack member still mobile enough \nto actually commit the deed. \nThe target elder seldom acquiesces calmly to her fate. Entire city blocks \nsometimes collapse in rubble in the ensuing struggle. Depending on their \npersonal styles, targeted elders may unleash Master-level Disciplines or potent \nbribes in various coins. Every so often, a winning pack gets a good enough offer \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The leader accepts the \ntoken after examining it for signs of fakery and blesses the victors. All surviving \npacks gather for another round of revels as soon as news of the War Party’s \nresolution spreads. \nSystem: The individual vampire who actually diablerizes the target gets \nall the usual benefits of diablerie. The members of the winning pack get the \ntemporary Status of Martial, which lasts until the next War Party, Grand Ball \nor Festival of the Dead. Particularly prominent targets like Methuselahs win \npermanent Status for the victors. \nWILD HUNT \nThe Wild Hunt gives force to the Sabbat’s emphasis on devotion. A \nmember who betrays the sect’s secrets risks this ultimate sanction. \nA priest calls the Wild Hunt. Generally the highest-ranking priest in the \nvicinity does so, and she’d better have the support of her superiors before \naccusing another Sabbat member of treachery or face the same punishment \nherself. All loyal sect members in the area must hunt down the traitor and \nanyone, Cainite or mortal, to whom he may have given the information. \nOverzealous vampires who destroy a Wild Hunt target before interrogation \nrisk Final Death themselves. The traitor’s contacts are exterminated only after \nexamination makes sure that they haven’t spread the leaked information \nfurther. \nThe Wild Hunt seldom takes place in the risky and yet exuberant \natmosphere of a War Party. Treachery exposes the whole sect to risk. Whatever \npreparatory rites take place, their priests perform them solemnly. Vaulderie is \nessential, and Fire Dancing usually accompanies it. \nThe vampire who captures the traitor and his contacts bring their prisoner \nback to some central meeting place for questioning. The ductus and priest, and \nany superiors who wish to take part, recite the traitor’s crimes and use torture \nto extract confirmation. Hot irons, mutilation, Vicissitude and a multitude of \nother means come into play. Once the traitor confirms his sins and the Sabbat \nestablishes the spread of his leaked secrets, torture becomes straightforward \npunishment, lasting as long as anyone involved has ideas about how to hurt the \ntraitor. Vampiric collaborators also face torture while mortal allies generally \nmeet quick, if painful, ends. \nAfter tormenting the traitor, his former packmates throw his staked body \nonto a consecrated funeral pyre. An attending priest recites the Book ofNod’s \nChronicle of Caine to remind all involved that victory requires unity and that \ndistrust makes unity impossible. Vaulderie follows to reestablish the bonds of \nmutual commitment. \nSystem: Some regions practice the ignoblis ritus of Contrition, to allow \ntraitors to make amends. Storytellers may allow the targets of a Wild Hunt to \ninvoke this or not, at Storyteller discretion. For minor offenses, allowing \ncontrition with punishment balances severity with the avoidance of hasty \ncharacter death. More serious offenses should bring a more serious penalty: \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Never arrange a character’s death lightly, but don’t hold back when it’s \ntruly earned. \nLOW RITES (1gNom1s RITA€) \nThe “low rites” vary from pack to pack. Not all packs observe them; many \npacks that do acknowledge them put local variations and emphases on them. \nStorytellers can establish ignoblis ritae for their chronicles, and players should \nfeel free to work up new low rites subject to review by their characters’ \nsuperiors. \nThe Sabbat works from the bottom up as well as from the top down. In the \nwar against the shadows of the past, innovation is one of the sect’s key weapons. \nCharacters should know that their innovations may well meet with favorable \nresponse. Sect leaders encourage new ways of putting existing principles into \naction, particularly in response to new situations. \nACCEPTANCE \nAcceptance ritae mark an individual’s induction to a pack, whether at the \nend of auctoritas Creation Rites, adoption of an existing Sabbat member \nseparated from his old pack or as a reaffirmation of the pack‘s membership after \na change of leadership. Each member of the pack acknowledges the newcomer \nwith some personal token. Some packs offer vitae while others offer gifts, \nadvice, favors or something else useful. There’s no innate magical benefit in \nthe Acceptance ritus, just the social bond. Many packs include a short oath in \nwhich the newcomer acknowledges his debt to the pack and the sect; in turn, \nhis new packmates take an oath to treat him as an equal, with the same rewards \nfor his successes and punishments for his failures that they all face. \nALLE~IANCE \nThe Allegiance ritus bridges the gap between formal creation of a new \nSabbat member and her acceptance into a specific pack. The new vampire \nmust prove herself familiar with the sect’s ideals and capable of acting \neffectively. While in this transitional period, the vampire occupies a distinctly \nsecondary position. She stands at the rear during uuctoritas ria, drinks last at \nthe Vaulderie (and generally can’t contribute her own blood) and cannot \nengage in discussion of the Book ofhrod. Most packs administer a secret mark \nof some sort as part of the ritus, identifying the recipient as someone who’s \nbegun to win acceptance and not yet completed the process. \nThe trial period may last only a few weeks if the vampire proves remark- \nably capable or may stretch on for years. A vampire who never succeeds in \nimpressing a pack enough to warrant Acceptance faces the threat of Final \nDeath administered by her disappointed creators.

At the end of the \nAsp’s Blessing ritus, examination and Contrition rime follow for all who failed \nthe test of purity. \nCONTRITION \nThe Contrition ritus is most likely to win promotion to auctoritas status \nsoon; very nearly every pack practices it in some form. Sabbat members who’ve \ncommitted offenses against the sect confess their failings and accept any \npunishment short of Final Death. Minor failures earn no more than a beating \nand assignment to unpleasant duties. Breaches of sect security might win \ndismemberment and the restoration of just enough vitae to let the contrite \nvampire begin healing. \nPacks vary in their willingness to accept repeated performance of the \nContritionritus, whether for the same offense again and again or for a diversified \nbut sustained pattern of clueless conduct. Packs whose leaders show too much \nleniency face condemnation themselves. The sect is, after, all, at war. \nW F L C o M I N q  \nThe Welcoming ritus is, like Acceptance, a social occasion. Whenever \ntwo packs meet for a shared task, or a nomad pack enters a city, they have to \nestablish some neutral space within which to become acquainted.

Vampires who recognize \nothers with whom they have grievances promptly say so, and the packs’ ducti \nand priests attempt to mediate the dispute.

All \nthe packmates then reaffirm their loyalty to the Sabbat’s twin emphasis on \nindividual liberty and united action. In many areas, the pack leaders exchange \nblood; in areas with a very strong religious emphasis, everyone in the packs may \nimmediately share the Vaulderie. \nAfter the Welcoming Titus, pack leaders feel more comfortable making \nplans for whatever their common purpose may be. \nT H A N K S ~ I V I N ~  \nThe Thanksgiving ritus practices the giving of thanks in an old-fashioned, \nliteral sense.

Traditional (or neo-primitive) groups include body adornment, \nritual scarification and the like. \nSPILLINS \nOE BLOOD \nThe ritus of the Spilling of Blood is one of several that never quite became \naucton‘tas but is well-known throughout the sect. Vampires feeding together \nmake a point of trading sips from their respective vessels with a ritual \nacknowledgement along the lines of “Hot blood that spurted from Abel at his \ntime of death, sustain us for the will of the Sabbat.” \nSTEALTH \nPacks about to embark on an assignment that requires silence practice the \nStealth ritus, as do packs that simply wish to test their discipline. Participants \nbite out eachother’s tongues and spit the severed organs into afire. This inflicts \nno lasting damage; the participants each spend a Blood Point to stabilize the \nwound. In some cases the ductus or priest refrains from participating so that he \ncan give orders, while in others all pack members join in and communicate \nthrough hand signals and mental Disciplines. \nSUN DANCE \nThis ritus tests the participants’ endurance and courage. The Sun Dance \nritus always takes place during a full moon. Participants wear frightening \ncostumes or body paint, hoping to intimidate others. The participants dance \nfrom the moment they waken after sunset until sunrise, gyrating around a \nsymbolic inscription of a fiery sun. They then attempt to stay wake and in the \nopen as long as possible during the new day. A Blood Feast generally follows \nthe next night. \nSome packs make provision to rescue participants who become too \ninjured to seek shelter, while others don’t. Sect leaders frown on this sort of \npointless loss of brave members and encourage Sun Dance observers to keep \nbystanders at hand. \nTESTS \nOE P A I N  \nAll of the various Test of Pain ritae challenge the participants’ ability to \nremain functional in the face of severe pain. Some packs use Tests of Pain as \npart of their competition to choose new leaders; many packs include Tests of \nPain along with Contrition ritae as punishment. The Trial by Stake is simple \nand widely practiced. The participant to be tested gets staked to a wall by a \nstake through his chest, mounted high enough that his feet don’t touch the \nground. Depending on the pack, he may remain there until packmates let him \ndown just before sunrise, or he may have to tear himself loose and go on to \nperform other tests. The Trial by Fire subjects various parts of a participant’s \nbody to flame wielded by the pack priest. The Trial by Gauntlet requires the \nparticipant to make his way through parallel rows of packmates who beat him, \nsometimes with weapons, sometimes barehanded. \nThe range of Tests of Pain is nearly infinite. Pack priests generally develop \na favored personal repertoire.

      "text": "TRUTH \nREVEALED \nThe Truth Revealed ritus hangs on the edge of auctoritas standing; its \nefficacy depends on the ability of the priest administering the ritus. A vampire \nunder suspicion of dishonesty writes out a statement with her own blood. The \npriest takes the paper and bums it, usually in a ceremonial censer. If the smoke \nturns black, the statement was false while white smoke indicates truthfulness. \nEven when the priest does nothing special, the ritus produces accurate results \nmore often than chance would allow. Sabbat scholars theorize that the \nceremony taps into the latent mystic powers of the pack united in the search \nfor truth. Priests who possess three or more levels of Occult or Rituals may make \na Mental Challenge against the subject of the inquiry. If the priest succeeds, \nthe n’tus always generates the right color of smoke. \nSTATUS \nThe Sabbat takes Status very seriously indeed. The sect fights wars on all \nfronts, and in time of war, everyone fighting on the same side needs to know \nwho gives orders and who carries them out. The war isn’t just political - \nit’s \nreligious, involving fundamental questions of right and wrong, who may be \nsaved or damned, when the world can or must end and so on. Individuals rise \nthrough the Sabbat’s ranks on merit, proving themselves physically and \nmentally capable of wielding power. Status Traits honor their past achieve- \nments and show what others should expect. \nSabbat members gain Status more readily than most Camarilla members. \nThey also lose Status more readily. As noted in Laws of the Night, Revised \nEdition, p. 222, the members of a pack acting in unison can strip a packmate \nof any Status Trait except those associated with matters of fact. See below for \na summary of common Sabbat Status Traits and the ways Sabbat members \nqualify for them. \nAs the descriptions of particular offices emphasize, the Sabbat’s masters \nlead rather than rule. They cannot hand down decrees with impunity; they \nmust set the example of courageous action and penetrating insight. The \nreligious and political goals of the secret favor pragmatic response. A good \nleader is the one who gets things done. If things don’t get done, or get done \nbadly, the leader is leading badly and runs the risk of being deposed. Even the \neldest master of war and crusade gets little automatic respect. Long lists of past \nhonors don’t matter much in the face of tonight’s needs. \nThe higher the rank a Sabbat member holds, the more of a proven record \nshe must have. Nobody becomes bishop the night after she earns Initiated Status. \nNobody loses a bishopric overnight in response to a single minor problem or \nallegation from a neonate, either. Deposing a high-ranking officer requires \nverifiable charges. Real failings are easier to prove than fraudulent ones, though \nsometimes trickery does work. The challenges facing the Sabbat from all sides \ngenerally ensure that every leader does in fact make some mistakes, and rivals \nneed only keep a careful tally of the leader’s errors. Rivals also generally strike \ndeals with the leader’s enemies or superiors (or both) so that when the current \nleader falls, the right candidate emerges as a plausible replacement. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Court and conclave schemes offer no more tangled \nmorass of intrigue than the maneuverings around a new bishop’s ascension. \nWHAT STATUS MBANS \nKeep in mind that Status Traits quantify something that’s hazy and \nsubjective to characters in the World of Darkness. Status is fluid, personalized \nand subject to change without notice. If you’d prefer to run your chronicle \nwithout using the mechanics, go right ahead. The reality of Status -superior \nand inferior rank, plus acknowledgement of smart or foolish deeds - \nexists, \nand you can roleplay it out in lots of ways.

Note that Sabbat Status comes and goes far more rapidly than in the \nCamarilla, see Laws of the Night, p. 222. \nSome Sabbat Status Traits reflect accomplishments that don’t require the \nvampire to hold an office.

A vampire \nwith two levels in his Morality earns one of these Traits - \nwhich one depends \non the views of his priest and pack about his particular standing. A vampire \nwith three Morality Traits is eligible for a second of these Traits, and a vampire \nwith four Morality Traits can carry all three. \nBlooded.

Some monitor pack \nleaders’ performance and intervene to solve problems, then punish the leader \nwho screwed up. The Inquisitors employ templars with them as enforcers \nduring their travels and trials. \nTemplars cannot join the Black Hand. Membership is seen as a conflict \nof interests as the paladins are encouraged to eschew factional agendas. In \ntheory, a templar pays attention only to his specific duties at the present time. \nIn practice, every templar has other issues in mind as well, and the sect simply \ntries to reduce the unnecessary complications. \nTemplars are used extensively by sect leaders, though some may belong to \npacks during periods of inactivity or have been honorably discharged from their \nduties in times when their leaders have no need for bodyguards.

Large \ncities without archbishops run under a council of all the bishops in the area. \nMany bishops once served as priests. It’s not a requirement, however - \nskillful ducti also go on to hold bishoprics. Rising to the rank of bishop marks \na vampire’s entrance into the serious realm of sect politics. New bishops are \nalmost always less than two centuries old and generally know only some of the \nmatters they must now make decisions about. Priests with profound insights \ninto the ritae, for instance, may know nothing about administration and \nsecurity issues while expert warriors may lack any experience in detecting the \nearly signs of heresy and infernalism. The council of bishops lets each of the \nnew leaders consult with peers and learn through observation. \nClueless bishops don’t last long. The cardinal of the region oversees the \nbishops’ council, and most cardinals tolerate few serious mistakes. The often \nfractious nature of pack debates means that bishops must constantly intervene \nto forestall disaster while worrying that the wrong action taken or left undone \ncould mean their own destruction. A bishop enjoys less maneuvering room in \nwhich to demand obedience: The bishop must negotiate as well as command. \nA bishop may command as few as two packs, or as many as a dozen. The \nSabbat tries to keep bishops from getting too overloaded with duties, but the \nongoing crises sometimes make it necessary. One unlucky attackon a Camarilla \ncity can leave a region devoid of leaders above the level of ducti and priests, \nfor instance. So can a successful investigation into infernalism (where “suc- \ncess” may involve the conviction and punishment of political enemies who \nweren’t actually dealing with demons). In peaceful times, bishops groom their \nheirs with extensive training and preparation and discussion beforehand with \narchbishops and cardinals about their own plans. In the Final Nights, being \nchosen as bishop more often comes as a complete surprise, with training after \nappointment. \nBishops answer directly to cardinals, whose justice may have severe \nconsequences if an errant bishop refuses to mend his ways. \nThe bishop automatically gains the Status Traits of Feared and Proven \nwhen taking office, and these can never be permanently removed while she \nretains her position. \nThe bishop can appoint and remove ducti and priests. \nThe bishop can appoint templars.

The \ncardinal for the region appoints an archbishop to the lead the Sabbat in a city \nthe cardinal believes needs a mdre experienced individual in charge or where \na council of bishops hasn’t done well. \nArchbishops always come from the ranks of bishops. Nobody gains \nresponsibility for all the affairs of a city until he’s learned how to handle all \naspects of Sabbat routine. The new archbishop takes office already solidly \ngrounded in Sabbat beliefs and practice. He’s proven himself in battle and \nshown himself capable of attending to his followers’ spiritual needs. He’s \nprobably not equally competent in all fields, but he’s at least not so incompe- \ntent that he got punished severely in lower positions. \nThe archbishop doesn’t look after the well-being of mortals. Sabbat \nstrongholds tend to be blighted, crime-ridden hellholes where nobody notices \na few more dead bodies. The people of the town live in fear, but are too scared, \nexhausted or depressed to flee. The Sabbat has no tradition of Masquerade: As \nlong as Sabbat behavior doesn’t bring down massive mortal retaliation, it’s \nfine. Highly visible displays of vampiric power usually merit punishment - \nnot because they’re wicked, but because they’re bad tactics. In the era of mass \nmedia, the Sabbat has to restrain its more zealous members from behavior that \nwouldn’t have mattered when cities were more isolated. (Some Sabbat \nenthusiasts favor social and technological collapse for precisely this reason.) \nThe archbishop sets the tone for his city. \nMost archbishops take office sometime in their second century of unlife, \nand few make it to 300. Competition and the endless war take their toll. A \nhandful of archbishops are much older, running back to the Sabbat’s founding \nor even before, and they exercise tremendous authority in the sect regardless \nof their nominal rank. \nEvery priest can create ignoblis ritae on her own, and superiors can \nintervene only in cases of extreme doctrinal divergence. The archbishop can \nrecommend ignoblis rim that impress him to packs in his jurisdiction and even \nsuggest them for elevation to aucton’tas status.

She must see to it that they come under the sect’s direction. \nExperienced in the various means ofwarfare, she’s expected to use them all, not \njust the ones she’s personally fond of. A successful crusade usually takes years \nto plan, with reconnaissance (updated constantly), contacts with potential \nallies inside the target zone, as well as contingency plans. The cardinal needs \nto oversee the planning while keeping her (theoretically) devoted followers \nbusy enough in the meantime. Inevitably, she must delegate responsibility for \nmany aspects of the process, and the failure of her chosen agents generally \nforms the basis of charges for her own removal. \nMost cardinals have been vampires for at least three centuries by the time \nthey take office, though there are prominent exceptions. Many cardinals, even \nin the Final Nights, took part in the Anarch Revolt as well as the Sabbat’s \nvarious civil wars.

Simultaneously, she must rein in her own \nenthusiasm for the sect’s ultimate triumph and keep her followers from \nprematurely ravaging the cities they dominate so thoroughly as to provoke \nmortal response. \nThe cardinal’s subjects usually don’t see her often, except during the \nannual ritae and in moments of great crisis when she must take a personal role \nin leadership.

More often, he provides information and training \nto younger vampires. Above all, the priscus helps the vampire he aids to make \nmost effective use of the weaknesses presented by the sect’s enemies of the \nmoment. Sometimes the job involves surgical strikes to study military de- \nfenses, sometimes espionage, sometimes ideological warfare to sow confusion \nand plant seeds of thought that the Sabbat can exploit later.

Often, a crusade’s success or failure depends on vital informa- \ntion, such as what defenses aprince can call upon or which influential vampires \nmight sympathize with the Sabbat. This is the priscus’ true purpose: to \nmaximize on the flaws of the others through proven strategies. \nThe “generation gap” in the Sabbat shows very prominently in members’ \nreaction to prisci. No vampire has ever become a prisci with less than 200 years \nof service to the sect, and most are twice that old. The Sabbat’s elders generally \nfeel that prisci are reaping their due reward for long service; younger members \noften think that prisci coast on past glories at the expense of the vampires who \ngo out and get things done now. The truth of the matter is that young vampires \nrarely see the prisci in action. Devoted as they are to the regent and her support, \nmuch of the prisci’s responsibilities keep them out of contact with the foot \nsoldiers of the sect. These young Cainites aren’t completely incorrect, however. \nThe consistory does resemble an aristocratic “court,” as the vampires who \ncomprise it (including somecardinals) play at their own Jyhads. In anutshell, the \npriscus’ role is to ensure the Sabbat’s long-term success through good advice and \ncareful planning. Prisci typically maintain the social structure of the Sabbat as \nwell - \na priscus’ patronage is required to become an archbishop, for example, \nand the consistory selects its own members from lesser ranks of the sect. \nThe priscus automatically gains the Status Traits of Confirmed, Feared \nand Infamous upon taking office, and these can never be permanently removed \nwhile he retains his position. \nOnly a priscus can appoint or remove another vampire as priscus.

They sit on the boards of directors for firms \nin many industrial sectors and serve throughout the Roman Catholic hierar- \nchy. There’s no real “center” to the family. Wherever family interests took past \ngenerations, there’s a current concentration of family influence, from Goa to \nNew York. \nThis spread of the family serves visible goals as well as a secret agenda \nknown only to family elders. The Grimaldi family leaders believe that the \nfamily survives only because of Tzimisce patronage. Should the Tzimisce ever \nwithdraw their protection, forces inside and outside the Sabbat would slaugh- \nter the family and seize its assets. The elders therefore quietly work on \ncontingency plans. Chosen agents negotiate with representatives of the \nCamarilla Ventrue and the Giovanni, discussing the terms under which those \nclans would find the family valuable enough to protect. \nIf news of these talks ever became public, the Tzimisce would immediately \nwithdraw their patronage and let the slaughter begin, so the elders involved \nkeep the matter secret from everyone else. Partly as misdirection, partly simply \nbecause it makes good sense, they do encourage their heirs to make ties with \nthe other Sabbat clans, particularly the newcomers, so as to strengthen bonds \nthat might prove useful in future calamities. The negotiating elders also keep \nthemselves away from direct contact with Sabbat vampires, to avoid the risk \nof inadvertent revelation. \nGrimaldi traditionally follow the Path of Honorable Accord or the Path \nof Power and the Inner Voice. In every generation, a handful follow the Path \nof Caine as best they can, given their inability to commit diablerie. This \ncentury, many Grimaldi have chosen to remain on the Path of Humanity, \nmuch to their elders’ distress. The advocates of the “humane” Grimaldi \nmovement explain that in an era of telecommunications, it’s harder to hide \nsigns of moral monstrosity. The Paths, the advocates say, reflect the opportu- \nnities and luxuries of a bygone age and are just bad business now. The Tzimisce \nwho monitor the family find this development distressing and cultivate \nsupporters of less humane strategies in the younger generations. \nDisciplines: Celerity, Dominate, Fortitude \nWeakness: All Grimaldi are blood bound to a Sabbat vampire of bishop \nrank or higher at puberty. The Sabbat started doing this to ensure the family’s \nloyalty in its extensive dealings with mortal society at large. It became a habit, \na sign of reaching adulthood in the eyes of the family and sect. The Sabbat rarely \nmakes use of these blood bonds.

Some features are fairly standard despite the variations. \nA typical szlachta has spikes, armored plates or both. The Tzimisce \ncreating the ghoul removes all unnecessary fat, or transfers it to areas where \nextra padding might come in handy, such as over vital organs.

The target gains one health level of all-body armor or two levels \nof armor for one specific part of the body (head, torso, arms, etc.).

A vohzd gets one attack to its front, one to its rear, and one to one \nside or the other. Depending on how much of a head its creator gave it, these \nlabels may be fairly arbitrary; assume that “front” is the direction the vohzd last \nmoved, in the absence of more permanent physiological markers.

While such games are occasionally amusing in the same way that, say, \na shoot ‘em up arcade game is amusing, they are rarely a basis for a long-term \nstoryline. The Sabbat can be challenging to portray, but challenges provide some \nof the most rewarding play. In this chapter, we’ll be giving you some ideas and \nsuggestions to help you run your own Sabbat chronicles. \nIf you are about to venture into the realm of Storytelling for the first time, \nyou will certainly find it helpful to read the chapter on Storytelling in Laws of \nthe Night if you haven’t already done so. It will give you all the basics about \nbookkeeping, theme, mood, structure and plot, and it will help you make more \nsense of what you’ll be reading here. For those who are already familiar with the \nins and outs of Storytelling, prepare to take the next step into something a little \nlarger. \nTHE \nREALLY IMPORTANT \nS ~ ~ f i f i  \nIt should go without saying that Sabbat chronicles delve into the darkest \nparts of the psyche. This is the place where you start conjuring up some very nasty \ndemons, figuratively speaking - \ncomplete disregard for human life, glorying in \natrocity and an utter lack of what are considered normal values such as compas- \nsion. Storytellers in Sabbat chronicles take on more than just plots and themes. \nIt is vitally important for a Storyteller to always be in touch with her players and \ndoubly so with Sabbat material. Is one player getting unnerved by the material, \nanother one taking things a little too seriously, or are there Masquerade problems? \nGuess what - \nthey’re yours to deal with. \nPlayers who are getting unnerved by Sabbat material can be fairly easy to spot - \nthey have trouble joining in the games or rim, even when their characters are being \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Consider other \nthings for the player to do- it’s unlikely he wants to chuck the whk game, just parts \nof it. Is he interested in the spirituality and social interaction? Encourage him to hang \nout with the Noddists and priests. Is someone going out of her way to harass him? \nDiscipline the errant player. Is someone handling sensitive material, such as religion \nor sex, inappropriately? Lay down the law on treating the game with respect. This is \nsupposed to be fun, and when players are uncomfortable about the material, then they \naren’t having fun. \nOn the flip side, there are those who think a Sabbat chronicle is an excuse \nto go completely wild. These are more than just “gun bunnies.” They do \neverything in their power to shock their fellow players, from juvenile gross-outs \nto excessive profanity to profoundly insulting others’ beliefs. Not a few take up \ninfemalism for fun and profit and take pleasure in killing other characters. When \nconfronted with their behavior, they claim that they’re merely acting in the spirit \nof the chronicle- it’s adult material, they say, and if you can’t stand the heat, you \nbetter stay out of the kitchen. Such behavior is hardly the hallmarkof the mature \nplayer. Don’t tolerate this a minute longer than you see it.

This is when the real world and the game world collide, with unpleasant \nresults. A case in point occurred at a convention where a Sabbat chronicle was \nbeing run. Two players, in character at the time, were overheard by a maid \ndiscussing the vivisection of a hotel worker. The maid was naturally disturbed and \nbrought it to the attention of management, who subsequently came looking for \nthe convention staff. People don’t treat such things as murder, torture and the like \nlightly, not in these days of domestic terrorism. Be extremely careful where you \nplay and where you discuss your game. Sabbat themes and material sound \nfrightening to the average listener and can lead to panic when people aren’t \nentirely aware of the situation. \nThese aren’t meant to put a damper on your fun; they’re meant as a safety net \nso you can keep having fun without getting hurt. Respect the material and your \nplayers, and everyone will have a good time. \nSABBAT \nCHRONICLES \nThe plots, themes, goals and drives of a Sabbat chronicle are very different \nfrom those of a Camarilla story. Sabbat ideology demands a more straightforward \napproach to matters - \nat least, on the surface. A Sabbat chronicle is not merely \na morass of combat in an urban hellhole setting with some “nasty bits” thrown in. \nA Storyteller who approaches it thusly is cheating the players (and herself) of the \nchance to tell some very unique and exciting stories. \nERESH MEAT \nOne of the most rudimentary and yet compelling elements of the Sabbat is \nthe theme of brotherhood.

Founded? Is she the lone survivor of a recently \nfallen pack? It’s extremely unusual for a Sabbat to be without a pack for more than \na few weeks. During that time, characters should be antsy and strained. Only \nthrough the repetitive bond of the Vaulderie are they safe from the overwhelming \npower of the Antediluvians and their blood bond. \nThe pack structure allows you a convenient method to integrate new \ncharacters into the venue. By placing an inexperienced player in an established \npack, the Storyteller allows the pack to teach its “fledgling,” and the new player \nis instructed by more experienced players. If one member of the pack has a reason \nto be involved in an ongoing plot, the rest of the pack will almost certainly become \ninvolved - \nwillingly or not. \nINTRIgUB \nAlthoughtheSabbat is theoretically bound togetherwithasingleoverwhelming \nblood bond, the actual strength of that bond varies from individual to individual - \neven from month to month.

Remember, also, \nthat the Sabbat is a place of brotherhood, however enforced, and it can hamstring as \noften as it helps. At the moment when a character’s revenge is about to be complete, \nhe could find himself unable to strike. \nA total disregard for mortal life does not mean a disregard for all life. \nCharacters should have goals, dictated by their backgrounds, their Paths and, \nmore importantly, by the constraints of the sect. As the game develops, look for \nplot points that can create intrigue between characters. Are there two Noddists \nlooking for the same, one-of-a-kind occult item? Do you have several members on \nthe Path of Power and the Inner Voice striving for position and rank? There’s \nnothing wrong with conflicting goals, so long as one remembers that loyalty to the \nsect should always come first - \nor at least, it should always appear to come first. \nIf you seem to be loyal, then you are treated as such. If you appear to be the \nstrongest, or the most capable, then your position is more stable. It’s all about \nappearances, from the archbishop trying to look like she’s completely in com- \nmand to the newest Pander recruit who’s trying desperately to show off how tough \nshe is. \nThe Sabbat is not merely asect offanatics anxiously awaiting thenext excuse \nto start a killing spree. It is a motley of liars, manipulators and powermongers who \nfurther their personal goals and ambitions in the name of “the good of the sect” \namidst devout believers and wild-eyed rowdies.

      "text": "SETTING \nMany Sabbat games begin with the description of a horrific setting. No one \nknows how anything got there or why, but it’s assumed that this is how things are done \nin the Sabbat: Y“Yu enter the chamber and see the mutilated bodies of five adults \nhanging from the ceiling. Their blood drains slowly into a large pool below. The \ndripping is the only sound you hear.” While the inhumanity of the Sabbat is a theme \nthat should be brought out, the players are going to become more jaded than their \ncharacters unless some real thought is put into the backdrop. \nThink creatively. Why is this particular scene here? What purpose does it \nserve? What should the characters and players be getting from this?Consider the \nscene described above. If thrown into the middle of the evening to “liven things \nup,” it may go to waste -just \none more act of mindless brutality to which you \ndon’t want your players to become jaded. On the other hand, it can serve your \nstory by enhancing some part of it. Perhaps it’s the remains of an interrupted Blood \nBath (so where is the recipient of the bath?). Better still, perhaps it’s an illustration \nof a particular Sabbat bishop’s cruelty or of some Toreador antitn’bu’s latest work. \nFromaphysicalstandpoint, a Sabbat game need not mean that allyour games \ntake place in grungy alleys or nightclubs of thundering music. The chosen \ngathering place may reflect the bishop’s taste for meditative silence and study, or \na pack may be hosting the gather and has set the tone of the place by putting out \ntrophies of their successes and achievements. Set up lights with red bulbs and lay \nout dark bed sheets to indicate pools of blood when it’s time for a more frightening \nscene, or set up colored cellophane to show where aceremonial bonfire is burning. \nThe Sabbat has many opportunities for exciting and involving storylines \nthat can be easily inserted into a long-term campaign. Below, you’ll find some \nexamples and ideas to get you started. These are by no means the only stories you \ncan tell in this venue. Use your creativity, your imagination and the stories that \nyour players write as backgrounds for their characters to create and intricate and \ninvolved setting. Does one of your Brujah antitn’bu have a mortal enemy in the \nCamarilla? What if the Lasombra’s old flame on the other side had become \nattached to that character, but neither party knows? \nThere are several themes that are most appropriate for a Sabbat chronicle and \ncan be highly useful when planning a story for your assembled characters. Theme \nis the most important part of your story- it is the organizing principal, the thread \nthat ties together the errant parts into a unified whole. However, the Sabbat is a \ngame about the absence ofhumanity and agroupof individuals who have willingly \ngiven up their humanity. Alter common themes to accurately reflect the setting. \nHere are a few examples, using the themes mentioned in Laws of the Night, \nwith some slight modifications: \nh\ne\n \n-The Sabbat is usually no place for love, although the heightened blood \nbond of the Vinculum can substitute. Love, even if created by an artificial source, \ncan alter actions and create tension. What would we sacrifice for love? When the \nVinculum becomes too strong, will a pack willingly separate in order to follow the \ncommands of their leader? Worse, what if a packmate was guilty of some terrible \ncrime against the sect? Would his loyal (and loving) packmates cover up the crime \nor answer for it themselves in order to free him? \nTHEMES \nNEW AND OLD \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "Hate - \nHatred runs strong in the Sabbat, particularly when it is thrust \noutward, toward the members of the Camarilla and other threats. How can hate \nbe used to drive the character’s motivations? What if two individuals who hated \none another were forced to Vaulderie and gained a blood bond to one another? \nHow will they resist the call of blood in order to fulfill their grudge? \nBetruyal- Whena member of the sect breaks the rules, it is the responsibility \nof the entire Sabbat to hunt her down. Use betrayal themes to bring warring \nfactions together and give them a single enemy to dedicate their combined efforts \nagainst. At what price will acharacter’s betrayal affect those who were once close \nto her? \nRevenge - \nAny creature as long-lived as a vampire is bound to have made \nenemies, both inside and outside of the sect. When those enemies come to take their \nrevenge, they will not stop at the individual, but will seek to annihilate those closest \nto her as well. Further, when a pack is formed, the enemies of a single member \nbecome enemies of the pack, and, as such, can provide asingle goal for the characters \nto attain together. The pack is a strong support for player interaction, particularly \nwhen your game relies heavily on the theme of revenge. \nRebellion - \nRebellion is one of the most dangerous themes in the Sabbat. \nThe various political factions can be used to great advantage, forcing characters \nto choose between their loyalty to the sect and their dedication to the ideal of true \nfreedom. Unlike the Camarilla, where revolutions are usually bloody affairs, the \nSabbat must handle them with increasing delicacy and intrigue, especially where \nthe Vinculum is concerned. \nMorality -Alternately, \nthe theme of morality can be the theme of anti- \nmorality, and the price paid for escaping the bonds of humanity. What happens \nwhen the leadership of a certain area forces characters to accept an alternate Path \nof Enlightenment? What if the chosen Path of the archbishop is Cathari in a \nregion predominated by Power and the Inner Voice? Who determines the correct \nPath and to what effect? \nBUILD IN^ A STORY \nAll good stories come in stages, from the carefully plotted beginning to the epic \nending of the tale. Many of these focus heavily on conflict, either interpemnal feuds \nor full-scale wars, and in the Sabbat, such conflicts are often quite violent. Because \nSabbat chronicles can be violent in nature, players and storytellers alike should be \nprepared to adjust their plotlines for a constantly changing character base. Still, the \nbasic plot structure -opening, climax and denouement - \nprovides milestones for \nthe story that you’re creating, whether the story’s climax comes in the form of a \nvaluable clue or the defeat of an enemy’s guardian. \nOne good example of a Sabbat storyline, particularly one in which both sides of \nthe story can be played, is the siege. Whether a Sabbat force has decided to wrest a city \nfrom Camarilla (or anarch) control, or the Sabbat is fighting against a Camarilla \ninvasion of their territory, the siege plotline offers character development, action, \nintrigue and deception - \nin short, opportunities for stories. \nOverall, establishing the timing and pacing of a single story and the stages of \na more epic plot are very similar. In fact, when you are dealing with a large-scale \nplot, it is best to think of it in terms of a series of smaller events, to help give \nperspective and make an enormous task a little easier. In the Siege example, the \nStoryteller creates a larger story arc, which the players interact with (and may \naffect) though smaller vignettes and scenes. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "Opening \nFirst, spend time researching your chosen city, whether it is the actual city \nyou are running your game in or a separate location. If you and the players are \nfamiliar with the location, challenges and benefits of a particular setting will \nbecome important to the plot. Los Angeles, for example, is a much different \nlocation for a siege than Charleston and will have a much different feel and \npacing. Spend some time preparing the introduction to your story: Has the local \ncardinal declared war on the Camarilla in this city or are the the character’s \ncombined packs proving their worth to the Sabbat by assaulting a known \nCamarilla haven? Are the characters present because of duty or coincidence? A \nbriefing on the city’s current Cainite politics and organization, however brief or \nvague, gives the players a starting place for roleplaying. Further, if characters are \ninterested in running brief preludes, arrange scouting missions that detail certain \nareas of the city or gather important information they can disseminate at the \nopening game. \nDunng the latter stages of the opening, the Storyteller should make every effort \nto establish the enemy’s strengths, weaknesses and ties within the city.

Anddon’t forget that the enemy canstrike back-setbacks \nand losses \nmark this time as much as wins and triumphs. \nC1’ imax \nWhen the players have done a significant amount of research into the \ndifficulties facing them, they are ready to confront them. Such actions deter- \nmine the climax of a story - \nthe assault, and the victory (or failure) against \nopposition. This is your story’s high point, the point toward which your players \nhave been traveling. In a siege storyline, the initial climax might be the first \nmajor battle against the Camarilla. Powerful forces, from prisci to the Black \nHand’s seraphim, may be involved in the battle -even if they choose to engage \nthe enemy from behind a deceptive screen. Characters may battle for position, \nusing their victories as leverage against weaker opponents, or may use the battles \nagainst the Camarilla as a convenient excuse to take care of another enemy. \nThe battle may be a single tremendous fight or, more likely, a series of waves \nas the Sabbat sends in packs of shock troops to break down the Camarilla’s \ndefenses. The siege will need infiltrators to tear apart the Camarilla’s bonds of \nloyalty from the inside even as War Parties gather to destroy the city from the \noutside.

      "text": "Denouement \nAfter the climax, the story winds down. Players and characters alike gather \nto count the dead and honor the living. The Sabbat has either won the city or lost \nthe siege. Tensions begin to ease, and story pieces begin to come together. It is \nimportant that both players and characters understand the resolution of the plot; \nthey should feel as if they have accomplished something, as if they have somehow \nmade an impact on the world around them. Remember to note the parts of your \nplot that your players missed - \nsuch openings can create all new plots. \nThere will certainly be new struggles within the sect to fill positions suddenly \nemptied by war and to claim power within the new hierarchy. Those packs who \nwish to set up permanent residency within the city must claim their territories, \nand there will be heartfelt farewells for those that seek to move on. \nSUB p LOTS \nPropaganda can serve an important purpose in a Sabbat chronicle. One odd \nfact about most players is their ability to solve conflicts (which, after all, are often \nthe focus of stories). However, occasionally players can take their drive to bring \npeace a bit too far. The Sabbat is a dangerous place, and promises and political \nconcessions are not easy ways to mollify enemies. A good storyteller will keep \nrelations between the Sabbat and the Camarilla in constant turmoil, using small \nplot twists to throw the two factions against one another, at least in the \nbackground. Although war does not have to be a major theme in the plotline, it \nis aconstant thought in the minds of all Sabbat vampires and should be recognized \nas such. The Storyteller should maintain walls of propaganda and misinforma- \ntion, attacking the base philosophies of both sects so that no possibility of \nreconciliation is possible. \nThe internal corruption within the Sabbat provides for constant minor \nsubplots and conflicts. Corruption eats at the very heart of the sect, dissolving it \nfrom within as well as without. The Lasombra and Tzimice fight for control, as the \nless populous clans ally and struggle against one another. The rise of the Panders \nhas thrown the hearts of the inner courts into turmoil, and the friction between \njealous leaders can lead to constant power struggles between their domains. \nAlthough loyalty and freedom are the sect’s catchwords, too often leadership \nbecomes the iron fist of rulership, and being considered disloyal is enough to \nensure one’s destruction. \nOccult ties, particularly through the more unusual bloodlines and back- \ngrounds of the sect, also make interesting and unusual subplots. Certainly, the \nLasombra have been deeply involved in church politics almost from the inception \nof Christianity; their vaults are crammed with the prizes of hundreds of years of \ninfiltration, from relics to texts to forgotten lore. The Tzimisce cling to the mystic \nties of their homeland while the Kiasyd and Harbingers of Skulls probe into the \nmysteries of this world and the next. Though the Sabbat flaunts and brags of its \nsuperiority, they are well aware that there are mysteries and secrets beyond their \nreckoning. If nothing else, the recent loss of the Tremere untihibu has convinced \nthem of that. \nC o NELI CTS \nSabbat stories, like all good plots, should revolve around conflict.

Still, a character is partially \ndefined by her enemies, so we’ve provided a few sketches of ideas and opponents \nthat often come into a Sabbat chronicle. Many of these are large story hooks: a war \nwith the Camarilla won’t vanish after a single individual is killed - \neven if it is \nthe prince, nor will werewolves casually forget that their Kinfolk were murdered \nduring Sabbat ria. \nTHE \nSABBAT \nAS HEROES \nDifficult as it may be to imagine, the Sabbat are heroes in their environment. \nThey believe that their fight lies against an opponent that wishes to destroy the \nworld. They see the Camarilla as pawns of a greater power, and, not unlike the \nAmerican colonists, they fight against the might of an established group that \nclaims power by no recognized right. With each victory, they free the vampires \nof the Camarilla from the Jyhad by conversion or death. \nWhile some players prefer to be the villain or anti-hero of the story, many \nplayers do want to be the heroes. Even in a Sabbat chronicle, players should be \ngiven opportunities for their characters to behave in a heroic manner, defending \ntheir comrades, goals and beliefs. One of the ways to accomplish this is by creating \nacity background for your players that gives them a natural enemy: the Camarilla. \nRestoring a city to Sabbat control can involve conversion, battle and other \nexciting adventures, and is a good place to begin a long-term Sabbat chronicle. \nIt can be a refreshing change of pace to be on the other side of the fence, knocking \ndown the things you were busily building up in another chronicle. \nThis is not to imply that you should destroy another game - \nturning players \nagainst each other in such a manner could create hard feelings. It is more equitable \nto create a completely new story for your Sabbat game, separate from any Camarilla \ngames you may have running at the same time. On the other hand, some players \nenjoy the struggle against an unpredictable, living opponent and may be interested \nin dividing their player base among the two sides. In this case, your job as Storyteller \nwill be to keep all lines of information and reaction open and ensure that players can \nunderstandandcopewiththelossofafavoritecharactertotheactionsofapredatory \nmember of the other sect. \nSABBAT VFRSUS ANARCH \nThe anarchs provide prime recruiting ground for the Sabbat. The Camarilla \nis not unfounded in its fear of Sabbat infiltration though local anarch ranks. But \nmore than that, the anarchs can be a devastating wild card in a war between the \nsects, tipping the balance at critical moments. Whether the chronicle takes place \nwithin an anarch city, or the anarchs are friendly to the sect, a chronicle of this \nsort is certain to have significant upheaval and opportunity for conflict. The \nmindset of most anarchs (dedication to personal freedom) is supported by the \nSabbat, but most anarchs spit on the Vaulderie as simply a dressed-up blood bond. \nBetrayal of one stripe or another is often a theme in anarch-Sabbat plots. They \nmay be easy to infiltrate, but how easy are they to convert? Many anarchs are aware \nof the Sabbat’s brutal and unwanted attempts to convert them and will resist any \nSabbat presence in their city to their utmost. Also, the Camarilla often uses rumors \nand false Sabbat infiltrators to encourage wars between the anarchs and the Sabbat, \nwars that can only be beneficial to the Camarilla.

      "text": "SABBAT \nVERSUS CAMARILLA \nFor centuries, the forces of the Camarilla have stood in violent opposition to \nthe goals of the Sabbat. Where the Sabbat seeks to destroy the Antediluvians, the \nCamarilladismisses them as myths. Where Cainites consider the Beast to be agift \nof Caine that destroys their weakness, the Kindred embrace their humanity. \nThere is no room for compromise. Ultimately, the Sabbat has one goal: to destroy \nthe Camarilla and to convert or slaughter those who insist on following its tenets. \nThe ancient battle against the Camarilla can be fought on a number of \ndifferent fronts. Events can center around street fights, but infiltration and \nconversion attempts can also provide storytelling opportunities. A city in tunnoil \n(from Praxis struggles or clan wars) can appear the perfect wounded target for a \ncrusade. It is also possible, and makes for interesting plot twists, if both sects are \nminor powers in a city held by anarchs, werewolves or even hunters. Such a \nsituation might force the two sects to find ways to work together in order to defeat \nthe more dangerous enemy. How does the alliance hold? What happens after the \nenemy is finally vanquished? \nThe Siege \nA subset of the Sabbat/Camarilla plotline, the siege tactic revolves around open \nwarfare over some trophy, typically a city or important geographical area. Involving \nthecharactersaslargegroupscanbedifficultwhenyouarerunningalive-actiongame. \nAfter all, there are typically 20-30 players, and only one of you. While Narrators or \nStoryteller assistants can be helpful fix to this problem, the most important thii you \ncan do as a Storyteller is to create a plotline that encourages character interaction and \nshared goals, taking some of the burden off of you. It can’t be stressed enough that your \nplayers often give you the greatest motivational tools in their own character sheets. \nRead through their histories, find characters who are converts from or had earlier \nbrushes with the Camarilla (for good or bad). Perhaps they’re still sensitive to a \nhumiliating l a  at their enemy’s hands, or a convert left behind a lover who could be \nleading the defense. \nIf the siege is going to be run against a city peopled solely with Storyteller \ncharacters, then you should take care to create believable antagonists with goals \nand initiative. These characters will become the villains to your players, so make \nthem motivated, dangerous and above all real in their own right. A good way to \ngive antagonists depth is to locate a personality test and take it while thinking as \nyour lead antagonist. These can lend some flashes of insight into character, or give \nsmall details about how the antagonist might react to certain situations. \nYOUNG VERSUS OLD \nThe Sabbat is founded on the idea that the oldest Cainites in the world are \ncorrupt, treacherous and use the younger generations as pawns in a great game of \npower that spans continents and nations. Therefore, it is not inconceivable that \nthe newer members of the sect feel a certain amount of resentment toward those \nof greater age and power. Diablerie is a common practice; those of lower \ngeneration may be at risk of losing their immortal lives to feed the ambition of a \nyounger vampire. \nAlso, the anachronism common among elder members of the sect can be a \nstumbling block to their younger companions, particularly when there is a war to be \nfought. The difference between fighting with guns and swords is monumental, and an \nelder who has become hidebound or unable to adapt will swiftly find himself \noutmaneuvered.

The violent Brujah untihibu press \nfor more strikes against their enemies, railing against the cautions of more \nconservative clans. A simple fight for power in a city or between two clans can \ngrow radically in scope if one side suddenly chooses to pull out the cards of sect \nunity and brotherhood. \nThe various Paths within the Sabbat contain their own plotlines. A \nmember of the Sabbat who has started on the Path of Power and the Inner Voice \nwill have difficulty coping in a city led by a radically hedonistic Catharist. Other \nPaths, as well, will come into conflict with one another when their goals are at \nodds, whether because of doctrinal disagreements or a sly antagonist. \nNOMADIC \nVERSUS EOUNDED \nThe nomadic bands of Sabbat are considered one of the banes of the sect, \ndespite their occasional use as scouts, and founded packs often resent their \npresence. During the Sabbat civil wars, nomadic packs were frequently assassi- \nnated, destroyed for their power or influence or used as fodder between warring \nfactions. Many of the packs who are currently nomadic are survivors of that era, \nand as such, have not forgotten their treatment at the hands of those they called \n“brother.” \nNomadic packs are an unbalancing influence on a city and can create strife \nbetween formerly peaceful factions. They come in, cause trouble and vanish \neffortlessly, leaving the founded packs to clean up their messes. For this very \nreason, nomadic packs are rarely treated with the same respect as founded packs. \nDisrespect breeds resentment, which in turn breeds treachery and deceit - \nafter \nall, though the founded packs of a city celebrate the Vaulderie with one another, \nthose who are simply traveling through have no such enforced loyalty to the city \nnor to the Sabbat leadership that holds sway there. They are only loyal to \nthemselves, and may ignore certain rituals, commands and restrictions placed on \nfounded packs. Add a little background conflict to this, and the tension can \nbecome a powder keg waiting for the match. \nTypically, a single nomadic pack causes little or no difficulty to a city with \na major founded Sabbat presence. One idea might be to have several nomadic \npacks driven into the city by an outside force and compelled to live within its \nconfines, rankling both their wanderlust and the stability of founded packs in the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "city. Nomadic packs are also frequently home to some very unpleasant practices \n(infernalism among them) -how long can the pack keep their secrets when each \nnight in the city may bring them closer to discovery? \nTHE \nBLACK \nHAND \nAs we’ve already mentioned, the Sabbat is a place of great internal conflict. \nAdd the members of the Black Hand and the Inquisition, and the already-volatile \nmix grows that much more exciting. The Hand has always been trusted by the Sect \nand once saved the Sabbat from falling to civil war. However, that trust only goes \nso far in the eyes of the archbishops and cardinals who secretly fear the Hand’s \nmilitary might and wonder when loyalty to the sect is superceded by loyalty to the \nHand. The Hand is only called u p n  in times of great need; once active, they may \nnot be willing to relinquish control to a leader they see as “weak.” Yet, if the Hand \nis kept from power, the Seraphim may lose influence and strength in the Sabbat. \nThey must maintain a delicate balance of fear and respect and continue to duence \nthe sect from their position in the rear of the column. \nThe Inquisition’s goals are not quite so subtle. If infernalist taint threatens \nthe sect in a city, political niceties fall by the wayside. The seizure of the city and \nthe bloody purge that follows can shock even those who call themselves beasts. \nUnlike the Hand, which maintains a working relationship with the political \nleaders of the sect, the Inquisition is comprised of fanatics who will allow nothing \nto come between themselves and their enemy. Their goal is to see the sect \ncleansed of the cancer that rots it from within. However, even such “pure” \nmotives can be corrupted -how \nmany purges have swept up victims innocent \nof the charge of infernalism but not of the sin of interfering with a powerful bishop? \nWhen a plotline involves either of these two very powerful factions, the \nStoryteller should be cautious not to overpower the characters and their goals. \nLike a visit from a Camarilla archon, the arrival of one of these mighty beings \nshould be suitably momentous and rare. Use them sparingly on stage and let the \noccasion (and the plot it furthers) unfold on a grand scale. \nLOYALTY \nAND FREEDOM \nThe conflict between the sect’s two founding principles, freedom and loyalty, \nis a story always waiting to be told. Although the sect does everything it can to \nunify these two beliefs, the road can be a difficult one. Many Sabbat demand total \nfreedom, seeing it as the ultimate goal of the sect. They refuse to take orders from \nanyone - \neven the regent - and the Code of Milan simply undermines \neverything they seek to achieve. Understandably, the Loyalists are a significant \nproblem to those who seek to keep the Sabbat together under the umbrella of \nauthority. If the Sabbat is to survive, the balance between loyalty and freedom \nmust be maintained. \nThere are many ways to throw the delicate balance of power out ofwhack and \nthus open up new stories. A sudden attack on the city slaughters nearly all of the \nmost vocal Loyalists, and the Ultra-Conservatives suddenly advance to power - \na little too conveniently.. . Do the characters adjust their views to the liking of \nthe new administration or is there more here than meets the eye? Or could it be \nthat open rebellionon the part ofLoyalists causes turmoil in the sect, allowing the \nCamarilla or other enemies to take advantage of the chaos - \nwhich enemy \nshould be dealt with first? \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "DESCENT \nINTO HELL \nInfernalism is a disease within the Sabbat. The sect finds demons and their \nmethods to be repulsive and anathema to all it stands for. Personal freedom does not \nmean selling oneself into slavery. Unfortunately, there are many younger members \nwho are power-hungry, discontent with their position at the lowest ranks and eager \nto explore any avenue that offers them a quick route to power. Without Humanity \nto guide them, and often with only a basic understanding of vampiric Morality, \ntemptation proves irresistible. If a vampire is found guilty of infernalism, the \noutcome is always the same: execution. The method varies from place to place and \noften relies on the whim of the Inquisitor-General, but the final result will be just \nthat - \nfinal. Meanwhile, the Inquisition hopes the monster didn’t do too much \ndamage before they discovered her, but who can really tell where such a creature’s \ninfluence begins or ends? \nSo, what makes someone desperate or greedy enough to throw away sect \nbeliefs for demonic offers? Who makes the better target - \nthe self-righteous, the \nunderdog, the power mad or the ignored? What kind of damage can an infernalist \ndo among the packs or the power structure? How far can one infernalist’s legacy \nreach? \nNON-CAINITF \nFNFMIES \nMortals, Garou, even fae, all abhor the inhumane practices and butchery of \nthe Sabbat. There are very few other creatures of the World of Darkness that the \nSabbat can call friends, or even allies. There are many reasons why these groups \nmight cross paths with the Sabbat, but what happens when they do? \nMortal hunters can cause no end of trouble for the Sabbat, forcing them to \nre-evaluate the belief that they are “superior beings.” The vampires of the Sabbat \nare certain of their superiority to the Children of Seth and go out of their way to \nprove it in their rituals and games. The arrival of a particularly capable group of \nhunters should shake them out of complacency. Perhaps they are skilled outsiders \nwho were drawn by some particularly spectacular breach of the Masquerade, or \nmaybe they’re the mortal Inquisition who has had the city under observation for \nsome time. A more intriguing possibility is to see how the Sabbat try to maintain \ncontrol when the mortals of a sect-controlled city become motivated to clean up \ntheir town. If the kine are struggling to throw off the yoke, is it possible to force \nthem to go back under? \nGarou and Sabbat clash on several fronts. Garou Kinfolk aren’t immune from \nbecoming targets when a pack goes scouting for Blood Feast vessels, and the Sabbat \nstink abominably of the Wyrm to even the most casual observer. Both groups are \nused to fighting against the odds, both revere honor and strength, and both adhere \nto the belief that humans are worthless except as breeding stock or food. Some \nwhisper that Black Spiral Dancers and Sabbat have joined forces on rare occasions, \nbut most Garou discount such tales as campfire stories. \nEven the most heartless Unseelie can find the Sabbat lust for blood and cruelty \nto be too much, despite similar views on individual freedom, and Seelie fae abhor \neverything the Sabbat stand for. When the Sabbat target those they believe “weak,” \nweakness in their eyes could be anything changelings value, such as compassion, joy \nor creativity. Rumors abound of unholy unions between the Shadow Court and the \nSabbat. Their denizens often share similar views on the weakness of mortals, not to \nmention enjoying the same guilty pleasures, although few are willing to brave the \ngathers where the answers might be found. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "RITAF \nThe amtoritas and ignobilis ritae are the rituals and customs that bind the \nSabbat together. For many vampires, these are the times of their unlives when \nthey feel closer to their heritage as vampires and closer to the greater family of \nCainites that surrounds them. Using the rim is a fine means of setting the stage \nfor players and characters. For players, it’s a complete immersion into the Sabbat \nworld and values. For characters, it’s a chance to get the blood racing (so to speak) \nand reconnect with their heritage. \nOne of the best ways to draw both players and characters into the setting of \nagame is to create interestingrim and encourage every pack to develop their own \ngames and rituals. The Sabbat hierarchy encourages spirituality in its members \nand encourages the development of new rim as well. The rim of a particular pack \nhighlight the pack‘s qualities that others may admire or scorn. Many players love \npomp and circumstance, and given time and space, they will create some amazing \nevents for your chronicle. \nThe Sabbat isn’t a homogeneous mass of vampires all spouting the same \nnaughty words from between clenched fangs while posing in the latest rumble- \nworthy garb. The characters given here are all fairly typical: They’d fit in with the \npopulation of many Sabbat strongholds. They don’t even come close to exhaust- \ning the range of possibilities. If you use them in your own chronicle, alter sex, \nappearance, behavior and whatever details need to change to suit your stories. Use \nthese characters as starting points, not as barriers to your own innovation. \nNote: The Ability levels presented here reflect a “conservative” reading of \nthe rules and the assumption that characters can still attempt tasks that require \nAbilities they’ve used up. The characters just don’t get retests anymore. If your \nchronicle imposes more limits or simply includes characters who routinely have \nmore Ability levels, adjust the totals for these template characters to match. \nARCHBISHOP \nBackground: You earned your position a few decades ago after long, hard \nservice in difficult circumstances. Older than the government of the country you \ndwell in, you’ve followed your region through multiple cycles of revolt and reform. \nMortal society holds very few surprises for you. The political and social cause of \nperfect individual freedom first drew you to the sect, and you remain more \ninterested in the social side of the Sabbat than doctrinal issues. Still, you can \nsustain debate on the fine points of all the major Paths and the theological \nimplications of various divergent philosophies; your bishops learn quickly not to \nconfuse a subject’s secondary importance to you with ignorance. Soon there will. \nRoleplaying Hints: You’ve proven yourself fit for your job. You hope to prove \nyourself fit for higher rank than this. Since your own success depends on the \nperformance of those beneath you, you make sure they’ve got the resources they \nneed to do well, the training to use their resources, rewards for doing good work \nand harsh penalties for failure. You can count the vampires you actually trust on \none hand, but you have stable, mutually profitable relationships with your \nassociates, and that counts for something. \nClan: Lasombra \nNature: Architect \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

They hurl \nthemselves at the strongholds of their enemies, the Camarilla, with a ferocity \nthat belies the desperation beneath. These are the nights that have been \nwhispered of in the prophecies of the Book ofNod. This has been foreseen as \nthe end times. And worst of all, their most terrible fears - \nof the hunger of \nthe Antediluvians and the horror of Gehenna - \nwould seem to be finally \nborne out. \nRacked from within by fractious sect politics and beset from without by \nenemies of all stripes, the Sabbat pits itself in direct opposition to the \nCamarilla. There is no Masquerade here, no cowering from mortals who are fit \nonly for service or food, no boot-licking to elders who haven’t earned the \nrespect they believe due them. The Sabbat’s children revel in their vampiric \nnatures, believing full well that vampires are meant to rule the night as the \nultimate predators. Even as it battles the Camarilla for territory and the hearts \nof young vampires who chafe under the elders’ talons, the sect glories in being \nthe best monster it can be. \nProphecy and the crumbling strength of the Camarilla would seem to be \non their side. If these are indeed the Final Nights, and the time of darkness \napproaches, the Sabbat should celebrate, but they instead fight with all the \nstrength they can muster. It is precisely because prophecy and fears are at last \ncoming to light that the sect fears the approach of the end times, and why it \ncalls on its strength to the last vampire. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWHATTHIS \nBOOK Is (AND ISN’T) \nThis book details the innermost workings of the monstrous Sabbat. From \ntheir rituals to the strange Disciplines their members command, from the \nghastly revenant families to the workings of the antitribu, here all is revealed. \nWhat you have in your hands is not meant to be a stand-alone volume. \nThere’s a lot in the original Laws of the Night that you’ll need to play Sabbat \n(such as character creation, Disciplines and the basic rules). Other items, such \nas the elder levels of Disciplines such as Auspex or Obfuscate, are found in The \nCamarilla Guide. You may also find the tabletop Guide to the Sabbat handy \nfor more information regarding the sect’s history and internal chemistry. \nA ERIFNDLY WARNINC~ \nRepeat after me: ‘‘I am not a vampire. I am not a bloodthirsty creature of \nthe night. I do not have supernatural powers. If I ever start to confuse the \nboundaries of the game and real life, I will put down the game and not endanger \nother people.” Repeat this until you believe it. \nConsider this the official “You’re not a vampire - \nbehave yourself” \nwarning. There may not be an Inquisition, but there are certainly mortals out \nthere who will hunt you down if you start believing your own propaganda - \nthey’re called teachers, police officers, clergy and parents, and White Wolf \nsupports them heartily. The major rules of Mind’s Eye Theatre are more \nimportant than ever when playing a Sabbat chronicle. It can be exciting and \nmore than a little scary to delve into the dark parts of your psyche; the problem \nis when art and life start blurring too much. \nThe abyss is definitely looking back at you. Don’t get out of hand. \nWELCOME \nTO THE EAMILY \nWelcome to the Sabbat. Described as an apocalyptic blood cult, a coven \nof death-obsessed leeches, crusaders fighting an endless civil war and a hodge- \npodge of blood-drinking psychotics, the Sabbat is all of this and more. \nFor the Sabbat, to be a vampire means being a weapon in the Great Jyhad, \nan unending holy war on the ancient, cannibalistic monsters who passed on \nthe Curse of Caine during the Biblical nights. The Antediluvians - \nand their \nmindless servants in the Camarilla - \nseek to bring about the end of the world \nand destroy the race of Cainites. The Sabbat rages against this fate; they have \nbetter things to do than die at the fangs of their bloodthirsty sires. The world \nbelongs to them, not to the ancient evil that sleeps beneath the land. \nThe Great Jyhad is a matter of the sect against the world. Although the \nmembers of the Sword of Caine aren’t above internecine intrigue, blatant \nrivalry or treachery, in the end the Sabbat must come first. Martyrs and zealots, \nthe Sabbat’s children hurl themselves fangs-first at their enemies, falling upon \non their foes in scores and rending them like a pack of wolves. It’s a no-holds- \nbarred war, and rulership of the night is the prize. \nIn truth, however, the sect is more than this. Though neither mindless \nfiends nor demonic apostates, vampires of the Sabbat do tread dangerously \nclose to becoming such monsters. Having forsaken the ways of mortals, Sabbat \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nvampires understand that they are damned, creatures of the Beast. Rather than \nrail against their natures and pine for what they once were, they flaunt their \nmonstrosity: They have become more than human, and are yet cursed for \ndaring to move beyond the boundaries of the kine. \nOf course, this means the sect is as incestuously self-serving as any other \ngroup of ‘‘Kindred)) - \na term of weakness among the Sons and Daughters of \nCaine. In the modem nights, the sect is racked with corruption, festering from \nwithin, yet denying its own collapse with a passion unmatched by other \nvampires anywhere. \nTHE H I ~ H  \nPRICE \nOE UNLIEE \nAt a casual glance, the Sabbat would seem to be a haven for miscreants, \nthugs and cackling, self-indulgent deviants. Such is not the case. Indeed, \nnightly unlife for the Sabbat is so fraught with hellish peril that those members \nof the sect who are psychotic murderers and rapine blood-gluttons have \nbecome so to survive the incredible stresses they face. \nThe Sabbat suffers no end of internal schisms. Elder members of the sect, \nhundreds of years old and perhaps even present at its formation over half a \nmillennium ago, have radically different outlooks from the younger Sons and \nDaughters of Caine. Most young Sabbat have spent fewer than 25 years as \nCainites. As such, the Sabbat is a fractious entity, divided from within and \nbeset from without. The Sabbat does not generally have Cainites who are \nanalogous to ancillae - \nthe sect is comprised primarily of neonates, who do \nmost of the nightly fighting and dirty work, and a handful of potent elders who \nhave managed to turn the sect to their own ends by indoctrinating the young \nCainites and convincing them to serve their whims. This isn’t to say that the \nelders don’t believe in the grand struggle, but rather that they observe it as it \nsuits them. Elders of five centuries have too much at stake to risk fighting \nagainst the Antediluvians personally. Better to hurl a pack of howling \nneonates at their enemies and survive to continue the war on another night. \nHypocrisy plays a great role in the Sabbat. The sect is simultaneously \nrighteous and venal, spiritual and base, patriotic and selfish. A Sabbat Cainite \nmay have no qualms about hunting and destroying a Camarilla Kindred for his \noblivious service to the Ancients - \nbut it may have to wait until after she’s \nfinished gutting the mortal vessel who accidentally strayed across her path. \nLike a late-era Rome, the Sabbat has a strong, consistent philosophy that \nindividual corruption all too often pushes aside. \nTHE \nHISTORY \nOE THE SABBAT \nThe sect’s history prior to the momentous Cainite event known as the \nConvention of Thorns is shrouded in mystery. Some Sabbat claim legacies of \nmonstrosity and predation, wandering the Old World as a death cult. Others \nclaim the sect never truly existed prior to the Anarch Revolt, and instead took \nthe form of roving packs, not unlike the packs of the modem nights. Still others \nclaim that the very name defines the sect’s origin - \na loose confederation of \nwitches and self-avowed monsters claiming servitude to Hell. \nDespite the conflicting theories as to the sect’s origin, one fact remains \nrelatively reliable: The Sabbat came into being sometime after the Anarch \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRevolt. When the rebellious neonates of Clans Lasombra and Tzimisce \ndestroyed their Antediluvians, the elders knew their iron rule had come to an \nend and that Cainite society would never be the same. \nAfter innumerable bloody skirmishes, the anarchs gained ground on their \nelders and sires. With the victory of the Tzimisce and Lasombra still fresh in \nmany minds, Cainite struggles plagued Europe. Young vampires turned to open \nrevolt, and elders met their ends nightly, sometimes taking their childer with \nthem. Aided by the mercenary Assamite clan, the anarchs left no stone \nunturned in their war on the hated elders. Although no other clans managed \nto achieve the same success over their Ancients that the Tzimisce and \nLasombra did, it wasn’t for lack of trying. \nAs the bloodshed of the Anarch Revolt reached new heights, a critical \nmistake was made: Mortals discovered that monsters loomed in their midst. \nAfter a desperate appeal to Rome, humankind entreated the Pope to turn the \nInquisition against the night-walkers and blood-drinkers that had sought to \nlord it over them for so long. Even more horrifying, the Church agreed, and the \ncombined might of the witch-hunters added a new and terrifying dimension to \nthe chaotic soup that were those nights. The war ground on, looking more and \nmore like a stalemate. \nIn the midst of this, certain powerful elder vampires, among them a \nVentrue named Hardestadt (who had been believed to be the first elder to fall \nto the anarchs), chose to throw their lots together, believing that unity would \ngive them the necessary strength. Under their combined might, the tide began \nto turn. Hardestadt and his collective, called the Camarilla, called for all \n“Kindred” to parley. In the English town of Thorns, the anarchs and the \nCamarilla sat down to a written accord, known as the Convention of Thorns. \nwhich promised to restore order and sanctity to the race of Cainites. \nNot every anarch gave up so easily, however. The treaty offered little to \nremedy the situation that had caused the strife in the first place. Furthermore, \nClan Assamite suffered the brunt of punishment for the war. Enraged, a war \nparty of anarchs and rogue Assamites rampaged through Thorns, leaving the \ntown burning behind them. The sect that would become the Sabbat commit- \nted itself to its immortal course of action that night. \nIn the years that followed, the vampires of the newly formed Sabbat took \ntheir war against the Camarilla. The Inquisition continued to claim victims, \nand Cainites drew lines in the sand to mark their allegiances. The end result, \nthough, was a guerrilla bloodbath. Puppet rulers fell, knightly orders crumbled, \nand havens burned like winter hearth-fires. \nWith the discovery of the New World, the Sabbat saw a new empire for \nthe taking, and the sect flourished while the Camarilla huddled in Europe. \nSoon, though, they faced opposition, as disenfranchised young Camarilla \nvampires arrived, hoping to carve out legacies for themselves away from the \nironbound holdings of European elders. Before long, the Camarilla-Sabbat war \nhad reached the shores of the Americas. \nNot long afterward, the Lasombra and Tzimisce fell to warring amongst \nthemselves for the rapidly depleting resources of the New World. The \ncontinent was huge and underdeveloped, its cities few and far between, and \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nrare was the Cainite who wished to attempt surviving in the wilds. Cities \nbecame commodities while the clans fought each other for the dwindling \ncommunities of kine that sustained their existence. During the struggle, the \nCamarilla quietly spread through the New World. By the time the Sabbat \nrealized that they had been surrounded and, in fact, overtaken, it was too late. \nSabbat vampires are nothing if not survivors, however, and despite the \nobstacles of the Camarilla’s encroachment, the sect persevered. Establishing \nstrongholds in Canada (for which certain Sabbat vampires’ ties to the Native \nAmericans proved immensely helpful) and Mexico (where impoverished \nconditions and corrupt governments allowed the society of the undead to \nflourish), the Sabbat effectively blocked in the Camarilla. \nFinally, now painfully aware that their actions had cost them more \nterritory, the Sabbat vampires put their differences to rest... for a short time. \nConvening in New York, which the sect had managed to hold against all the \nbest efforts of the Camarilla, high-ranking Sabbat reconsidered their commit- \nment to the sect’s causes. Not content to merely sign a goodwill agreement as \nthey had before, Sabbat vampires took a long, hard look at what was important \nto the Sword of Caine. An unheard-of congregation of Sabbat committed to \ndocument the Code of Milan, a collection of tenets that composed Sabbat \nideology supposedly since the establishment of the sect. Additionally, the \nassembled vampires submitted a few addenda to bring the code up to date in \nlight of recent affairs. \nDOCUMENTS \nOE IMPORT \nAlthough the Sabbat is predicated upon freedom and the Great Jyhad \nagainst the Antediluvians, politics inevitably find their way into the affairs of \nthe Sword of Caine. Over the course of their existence, several important \nagreements have come to have meaning to the Cainites of the sect. The \nConvention of Thorns, which ended the Anarch Revolt, is seen by many \nCainites as not only the article that resulted in the formation of the Camarilla, \nbut also the Sabbat. The Purchase Pact enforced a previously inconceivable \nunity to the sect after one of its debilitating civil wars. The Code of Milan \nasserted what it meant to be Sabbat, and the responsibilities that the sect \ndetermined should accompany its freedoms. \nTHE CONVENTION \nOE THORNS \nMany years have passed since the start of our current conflict, now called \nthe Anarch Movement. Be it known that on this night of 23 October, 1493, \nthe Jyhad has ended. The time for self-destruction is over. \nThis concordat, bound in the Covenant of Caine by sacred vow, repre- \nsents anunyielding, vigilant truce between the Kindred known unto themselves \nas the Anarchs, the Clan Assamite, and the freestanding Kindred bound under \nthe title of Camarilla. Henceforth, the parties shall be recognized by faction as \nthe Anarchs, the Assamites, and the Camarilla. \nEach of the parties agrees to the responsibility of maintaining peace. Each \nshall lay its censures on any who breech or oppose this sacred Agreement. \nAccounting will be made of all parties for violations by them to either the letter \nor spirit of this Agreement. This document is binding under the social code of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nall Children of Caine by the accepted Lextalionis of all Cainites as it has passed \nthrough the ages. All Kindred are entreated to accept and gain solace from this \npeaceful accord. \nBe it known that the Anarchs will enjoin with the Camarilla as an \naccepted part, making it whole. Anarchs are expected to work peacefully to \nachieve their own ends. They must become defenders of all, and they shall \nreceive full entitlement to all rights and privileges belonging to all Camarilla \nKindred. All Anarchs shall be accepted back unto their elders and their \nformerly denounced clans without any fear of reprisal. Only the most vicious \nof atrocities shall not be forgiven. These shall stand written for the justicars to \nhear within one year, after which all allegations are no longer valid. All \nAnarchs shall reclaim all remaining and rightful property confiscated from \nthem. In return they must turn over any war gains taken during the conflict by \ngiving them to their sires or any recognized clan elder. \nKnow also that if the Anarchs are further warred on, this open Jyhad \ninvalidates their responsibility to maintain peace with their attacker. They \nmay act freely without fear of reprisal from inactive members of the Camarilla. \nAnarchs are guaranteed the freedom to act as they please, short of breaching \nthe Masquerade imposed for the protection of all Kindred from the kine. \nIt is also noted that any member of any other self-proclaimed sect must \nopenly declare this before his elders and renounce this relation. Failure to do \nso will result in the destruction of any deemed guilty. No Kindred may be sent \nknowingly to his death by an elder or sire, unless the security of clan or \nCamarilla outweighs the possible loss of unlife. \nFrom this night forward, the Assamites shall henceforth no longer commit \ndiablerie on members of other clans. The Assamites must commit themselves \nto this acceptance by a mark of assurance placed on them in the form of a \nThaumaturgical limitation. All members of the Assamites shall become \nunable to drink freely of the vitae of other Kindred from now unto forever. In \naddition, the Assamites shall pay the Brujah elders of Spain two thousand \npounds of gold, in ransom of the five Assamite elders captured committing \ndiablerie. Also, the Assamites may no longer participate in blood hunts. \nBe it also know that the Assamites are guaranteed complete independence \nfrom Camarilla demands. The Assamite fortress, Alamut, shall be free from \nfurther assaults. Assamites are also granted, out of respect for their beliefs, the \nfreedom to commit diablerie within their own clan without restraint and the \nright to commit diablerie on all Kindred not recognized as holding membership \nwithin the Camarilla. \nIt is rendered that all parties involved and all showing allegiance to any \nof these parties shall be held responsible for all aspects of this Convention \nbrought forth here, in the neutral Kingdom of England, outside the hamlet of \nThorns, near the town of Silchester. May Caine hold truth and peace for us all. \nLet it be know that forthwith, the Sabbat exists as a free entity, though the \nO n  this, the 19th of September, 1803, all Sabbat of good faith and \nTERMS \nOE THE PURCHASE \nPACT \nprice of that freedom comes in the form of the sacrifice of certain rights. \nconscience do hereby suspend all grievances with other Sabbat. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAny Sabbat found in open violation of this agreement -e.g., \nany Sabbat \nmaking open war on another for the purposes of his own betterment at the \nexpense of the sect - \nis hereby declared forsaken, and may be hunted for the \nblood in his veins. Such abandonment must be pronounced by a duly \nrecognized bishop, archbishop or other elder member of the sect. \nIn this we are united. In this we are Sabbat. \nSigned, \nRegent Gorchist \nWitnessed, \nCardinal Radu Bistri \nPriscus Livia Boleslav Czernzy \nArchbishop Enrique Albertos Marquez \nBishop Federic Montaigne \nTHE \nCODE \nOP MILAN \nBy the solemn word of Regent Gorchist, this is the one true Code of Milan, \nrevised from the original manuscript this night, December 2 1,1933. Out of the \nashes of our great war may this peace reign everlasting. \nAn oath of allegiance has been sworn by the regent and the consistory in \nthe presence of all faction leaders and 50 other witnesses to faithfully follow all \nregulations imposed by this code in leading the Sabbat. This revised Code of \nMilan is agreed on by all Sabbat factions, including those of Cardinals Huroff, \nBruce de Guy, Agnes and Charles VI; and Archbishops Beatrice, Una, \nTecumseh, Giangaleazzo, Toth, Aeron, Marsilio, Rebecca, Julian and Salluccio. \nAll other factions must pledge themselves in support of this revised Code of \nMilan or claim separation from the Sabbat. \nThese are the statutes comprising the Code of Milan: \nI. \nThe Sabbat shall remain united in its support of the sect’s regent. If \nnecessary, a new regent shall be elected. The regent shall support relief from \ntyranny, granting all Sabbat freedom. \n11. All Sabbat shall do their best to serve their leaders as long as said \nleaders serve the will of the regent. \n111. All Sabbat shall faithfully observe all the uuctoritas rim. \nIV. All Sabbat shall keep their word of honor to one another. \nV. All Sabbat shall treat their peers fairly and equally, upholding the \nstrength and unity of the Sabbat. If necessary, they shall provide for the needs \nof their brethren. \nVI. All Sabbat must put the good of the sect and the race of Cainites \nbefore their own personal needs, despite all costs. \nVII. Those who are not honorable under this code will be considered less \nthan equal and therefore unworthy of assistance. \nVIII. As it has always been, so shall it always be. The Lextalionis shall be \nthe model for undying justice by which all Sabbat shall abide. \nIX. All Sabbat shall protect one another from the enemies of the sect. \nPersonal enemies shall remain a personal responsibility, unless they under- \nmine sect security. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nX. All sect members shall protect Sabbat territory from all other powers. \nXI. The spirit of freedom shall be the fundamental principle of the sect. \nXII. The R i m  of Monomacy shall be used to settle disputes among all \nXIII. All Sabbat shall support the Black Hand. \nAddenda to the Code of Milan \nObserved by all witnessing parties present on this night, December 2 1, \n1933, and hereafter upheld. \nXIV. All Sabbat have the right to monitor the behavior and activities of \ntheir fellow sect members in order to maintain freedom and security. \nXV.All Sabbat possess the right to call a council of their peers and \nimmediate leaders. \nXVI. All Sabbat shall act against sect members who use the powers and \nauthority the Sabbat has given them for personal gain at the expense of the \nSabbat. Action shall be taken only through accepted means, approved by a \nquorum of prisci. \nAll Sabbat shall expect and demand freedom from their leaders. \nSabbat. \nMODERN \nN I ~ H T S  \nSome say the Sabbat has matured remarkably in the intervening years. \nIndeed, it has become a force to be reckoned with, claiming or reclaiming cities \nlong held by the Camarilla and using sieges and crusades with deadly effi- \nciency. This singularity of vision seems to have overcome at least a modicum \nof the sect’s disorganization. Additionally, the sect as a whole is considerably \nyounger than the Camarilla, able to adopt modern technology with a speed \nthat terrifies its stodgy counterpart. Whatever the reason, the sect has scored \nsome astounding coups and become a legitimate contender for the Camarilla’s \neroding power. \nNot surprisingly, the Sabbat exercises a great deal of influence over Third \nWorld nations and the most squalid cities of the world. There, amid the hives \nof homeless and faceless juicebags, Sabbat vampires feed with impunity and \nbuild their own private empires. In modernized parts of the world, the Sabbat \nis careful to cover its tracks. While scorning the Masquerade of the Camarilla \n(at least in theory, if not in practice), the Sabbat’s leadership realizes that the \nthreat of organized and technologically advanced human resistance is too \ndangerous to provoke. Thus, in cities of Europe and North America, the \nSabbat takes some pains to cover its tracks, though its methods- intimidation \nand murder - \nare far cruder than the (usually) subtle machinations of the \nCamarilla. With its limited contact in mortal circles, the Sabbat suffers in \nmodem cities; for now, the Camarilla’s influence in many human institutions \nremains one of their greatest banes. \nNORTH \nAMERICA \nCanada and the United States are perhaps the most successful staging \nground for the Sabbat. The sect has recently redoubled its efforts along the East \nCoast of the United States, solidifying its dominance in Miami, Washington \nDC, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Atlantic City. Likewise, Detroit, Mexico \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCity and Montreal have become ever more important jewels in the sect’s \ncrown. Concerned Sabbat see these cities as paper tigers, however, as the sect’s \nformer supremacy in New York City eroded completely after a successful \nCamarilla coup. Supporters of the war movement hasten to note that the cities \nof Atlanta, Richmond, Boston and Raleigh-Durham have recently fallen or \nare in serious contention. Nightly, the sect tightens its grip on the Midwestern \nstates, hoping to crack the Camarilla like a nut between the combined might \nof Mexico and the East Coast territories. \nSOUTH \nAMERICA \nIn a continent overrun with feudal, balkanized vampiric domains, the \nSabbat holds only limited sway. Most of the Cainites of South America support \nprivate domains backed up by small coteries of influential allies. Although \nmajor cities are always prime targets for the Sabbat, the economics of South \nAmerican countries do not hold the appeal of North America and Europe, so \nthey are often considered secondary targets due to their combined lack of \nfinancial power and (incorrectly) importance to the Jyhad. In fact, the neutral \nattitudes of South America make many of the cities a perfect middle ground \nfor meetings with members of other sects or organizations. When a Camarilla \nor independent vampire needs to make arrangements with the Sabbat, it’s as \nlikely as not to happen here, often rubbing elbows with war criminals, \nexpatriates and other exiles of the mortal world. Sabbat vampires in South \nAmerica are disorganized and fractious. The cities are largely independent, \nand the given presence of Sabbat in any city is usually limited to a single pack. \nAs the home of the elders of the Camarilla and the birthplace of the \nSabbat, Europe is prime ground for the sect’s more subtle warfare. Here, the \nSabbat still fights to overthrow the decrepit “Kindred” of latter nights. \nUnfortunately, the presence of many powerful and paranoid elders makes it \ndifficult at best to besiege cities, and the Camarilla is quick with retribution \nagainst any perceived attack. As aresult, the Sabbat has only limited influence \nin Europe, primarily in Spain and Italy where the Lasombra clan still holds its \ntraditional sway. \nMany of the Sabbat in Europe are quite old; indeed, some vampires \nclaiming to have been involved in the fabled Anarch Revolt still give counsel \nin the Europeannations. As aresult, upward mobility in the sect is limited here. \nDespite the Sabbat’s rallying cries of freedom and equality, young European \nCainites chafe at finding themselves unable to rise in position because older \nand more cunning vampires already hold the reins of power. Eastern Europe, \nwith the Russian territories and the former Ottoman provinces, is almost a \nseparate continent as far as vampires are concerned. Here, the hoary Tzimisce \nply the ancient ways of their clan, some even still existing as feudal overlords \nruling from crumbling castles. Sabbat vampires of the Old World generally \nlook on their compatriots in the Americas with disdain, often considering \nthem crude and barbaric. \n€UROPE \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAERICA \nAND THE MIDDLE \nFAST \nWith the fierce rivalry between the Followers of Set and the Serpents of \nthe Light, Africa does occupy some of the Sabbat’s attention. However, the \nSetites remain too deeply entrenched in their homeland for the Sabbat to \nconfront them effectively. The Middle East, encompassing northern parts of \nAfrica and some Far Eastern sections of Europe, is an exception to the Sabbat’s \notherwise minimal presence in the Dark Continent. As the traditional home \nof the Assamites, countries like Turkey and Saudi Arabia are fortifications of \nstrength for the Black Hand. The shifting allegiances of religious factions also \nmake fertile ground for recruitment; once the Blood has become involved, it \nis often a simple matter to turn fervent loyalty from a holy mortal cause to an \nunholy immortal one. \nAUSTRALIA \nAs a marginally independent territory, the Sabbat finds Australia frustrat- \ning. The princes of the area either pay lip service to the Camarilla or hold \ncompletely independent cities. Consequently, the Sabbat has pushed its \nattacks on Australia, as evidenced by rising crime and political unrest. \nWithout reinforcements from outside, the cities of Australia may soon fall to \nthe Sabbat presence, but many major outposts - \nSydney and Melbourne in \nparticular - \nremain remarkably free of Sabbat influence. \nASIA \nThe Far East remains shrouded in mystery to the Sabbat. The native \nvampires have little or no interest in contact or cooperation, and none seem \nto fear the Antediluvians. Even when using the underground smugglers who \ndeign to transport Cainites (albeit at ridiculously high prices), the Sabbat finds \nitself balked by the enigmatic locals and their disdain for the sect’s ruthless \nnature. Because of Asia’s huge mortal population (primarily in China and \nIndia) and financial markets (Japan and Korea), the Sabbat is quite interested \nin establishing power in this region. Aside from a single agent in Hong Kong \nand a pack in Tokyo, though, there are no active Sabbat in Asia. All attempts \nto gain ground in the region have failed miserably, with agents disappearing or \ndying before achieving any goals. Direct assaults with large packs of cannon \nfodder meet horrible ends as Cathayans seem to melt out of the shadows and \noverwhelm them with powers never seen before. Asia is a deathtrap for the \nSabbat, and the sect seethes with frustration at these failures. \nTHE \nSTRUCTURE \nOE THE SWORD \nOE CAINE \nAlthough it is sometimes difficult to distinguish from the outside, the \nSabbat observes an organized hierarchy. The sect has leaders and followers, as \nit must to be anything other than an anarchic mob. \nLike any philosophical gathering of vampires, the Sabbat is not ruled so \nmuch as it is led. Even the most august Cainites of the sect do what they do out \nof devotion to the Great Jyhad. Leadership among the Sword of Caine, \nhowever, is a capricious thing. At the higher echelons, Sabbat vampires tend \nto lose touch with the young Cainites who make their lofty positions possible. \nAt lower levels of the organization, a ductus’ or priest’s decisions sometimes \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nhave more meaning than those of a city’s archbishop. In the end, the Sabbat’s \nrabid self-sufficiency damns it as the disorganization endemic to a sect sworn \nto uphold freedom prevents it from maintaining consistency. \nDespite their seemingly fanatical devotion to the sect, members of the \nSabbat are individuals first and foremost. Sabbat vampires struggle with the \nsame problems as the other undead. Hunters, fellow Cainites, the mysterious \nother creatures who stalk the night and even savvy kine who catch on to a \nvampire’s depredations all conspire against the Sabbat as violently as they \nwould any other threat. Although they scoff at labeling it thus, the vampires \nof the Sabbat maintain a necessary “Masquerade”; the sect isn’t stupid, and its \nleaders know that they cannot achieve success if the sect falls to its enemies \nbefore it can muster for the Great Jyhad. \nIn response to the need for stability, the Sabbat supports specific titles and \npositions to serve its interests. Any vampire who has managed to acquire one \nlikely has the power, in one form or another, to support the claim. The Cainites \nof the Sabbat also remember slights as vividly as any Camarilla harpy or anarch \ndissident - \nintra-sect politics are no less vicious than those of the Camarilla \neven though the Sabbat pretends to be above such petty matters. Cainites at \nvarious stations almost universally owe some fellow Sabbat favors, nurse \nrivalries with others and manipulate all the resources at their disposal toward \nmaking things difficult for their foes while gaining (or erasing) debts sworn to \nothers. \nThe Sabbat respects these offices, by and large. In theory, this organization \nprovides a foundation for the sect - \nthe hierarchy is supposedly one based on \nmerit and achievement. In practice, however, the structure is only as strong as \nits weakest member. Vain elders sometimes demand near fealty from the \nCainites below them, and young Cainites rankle within the hierarchy of a sect \nthat claims to revile such things. The Sabbat may well be its own greatest \nenemy as many of the battles take place in the cold hearts and devious minds \nof the sect’s members. \nTHE \nREC~BNT \nThe regent of the Sabbat supposedly coordinates the master plan of the \nsect, much like a mortal dictator or corporate president. Supported by a \nconsistory of other powerfulvampires, the regent holds little sway over the sect \nas a whole, however. Young Sabbat often make a big show of rejecting this \nhypocritical figure of authority as elder Sabbat flout her rule for their own \npersonal gain. In the end, the regent may demand service, fealty and respect, \nbut she had best be able to back it up as the Sabbat has no lack of wide-eyed \nmegalomaniacs who would not hesitate to usurp the position for themselves. \nTHE \nCARDINALS \nCardinals have the responsibility of handling sect interests over large \ngeographical regions. Archbishops report directly to them and are, according \nto the hierarchy, responsible to them. Also, cardinals coordinate the Sabbat \nin their own cities - \na city in which a cardinal makes his haven sometimes \ndoes not have an archbishop or bishop. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nT H E  PRISCI \nAs advisors, sages and chamberlains to the Sabbat, the prisci make up the \nmajority of the consistory, the “cabinet” that assists the regent in matters ofwar \nand policy. The title carries no temporal power; these Sabbat are not enforcers \nor warlords. Rather, the prisci offer their unique insight to other members of \nthe sect, particularly the regent, cardinals and archbishops. \nTHE \nARCHBISHOPS \nArchbishops handle the administration of Cainite affairs in individual \ncities, often by wielding this title as preeminent in the city. Most often \nappointed by cardinals, archbishops bear the responsibility for all vampires \nunderneath them, and they must see to the support of the city in the Sabbat’s \nbest interests. Of course, the Sabbat’s best interests are not necessarily the best \ninterests of the mortals of a given city - \nindeed, they’re often quite at odds. \nThus, the archbishop’s position is one of balance: He must keep the city \nhospitable to the Sabbat and yet prevent it from becoming a wasteland by \nallowing the local Cainites to abuse it at their whim. \nTHE BISHOPS \nNot every Sabbat city has an archbishop to oversee the Cainite concern. \nThose that don’t typically host a council of three to five bishops, depending on \nthe city’s size. Like the archbishops, bishops maintain Sabbat influence in their \ncities. Likewise, they lead the spiritual growth of the vampires therein. \nTHE DUCTI \nAs leaders of individual packs, the ducti attend to the operational matters \nof their packmates. The title of ductus is a loose distinction, recognizing the \nmost accomplished member of a pack. They work closely with pack priests to \ncoordinate attacks, grow sect and pack influence and act as liaisons to the \nbishops and archbishops. \nTHE PRIESTS \nPriests are charged with the spiritual growth of their packmates. Many \npriests hail from Clan Tzimisce, but anyone of any clan may become a priest \nwith the proper instruction. As the ductus’ second-in-command, the pack \npriest conducts all of the pack’s rim and sometimes creates a few that are \nunique to it. All packs have a priest; some rare large packs even have two. \nShould the ductus be eliminated, the priest becomes the pack leader pro tern, \nuntil a bishop or archbishop (or in some cases, the pack itself) appoints a new \nleader. \nTHE \nTEMPLARS \nSometimes known as paladins, the templars are bodyguards appointed by \na bishop or greater Sabbat. Although they have no formal organization, \ngaining the title of templar is a great honor for a Cainite. It conveys the obvious \nfavor of a sect leader, makes the individual a symbol of strength in the Sabbat \nand endorses her fighting skills. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTRUE \nSABBAT \nAs the most populous group of Sabbat, the True Sabbat are members of the \nsect who have proven themselves to their sires, packs or superiors and earned \nthe privilege of continued existence and service to the sect. Once a Cainite has \nreceived her Creation Rite, she is considered True Sabbat. \nTHE CLANS \nAND THE ANTITRIBU \nWhile the Sabbat may have fewer members than its rival sect, the \nCamarilla, those Cainites hail from a greater variety of clans. In nights past, \nClans Lasombra and Tzimisce made up the majority of the sect. In the modem \nnights, though, mass Embraces and new groups joining the sect have skewed \nthose numbers a bit. While the Lasombra and Tzimisce still maintain some \nnumerical superiority, the antitribu or “anti+clans” have certainly come into \ntheir own. \nThese antitribu have turned away from the clans into which they were \noriginally Embraced. Most have no love for their parent clans - \nthe antitribu \nwent their own way, and few harbor any illusions of future reconciliation, \nparticularly with Gehenna imminent. In most cases, the reasons for the clan \nschisms have been lost to centuries of ill will, and few Cainites bear such \nresentment as do the antitribu for their progenitors. \nMore information on them appears in Chapter Two (with the exception \nof the Tzimisce and Lasombra, who are covered in Laws of the Night). \nEACTIONS OE THE SABBAT \nThe Sabbat is hardly a unified entity, as its history, cosmopolitan makeup \nand penchant for personal freedom illustrates. The sect is home to numerous \nsplinter groups who have united under the Sabbat’s banner to achieve their \nown ends (which sometimes correspond with those of the sect) or to direct the \ngreater body of the sect. In the chaos of the Sabbat, it is not unlikely to find \nmembers of these factions among the packs, though by no means does every \nmember of the Sabbat support a faction - \nmost simply support the Sword of \nCaine itself. Nonetheless, these factions claim a great number of members, and \nsome have become integral to the existence of the Sabbat itself. \nTHE \nBLACK \nHAND \nThe Black Hand is best described as a sect within a sect; a unique group \nof vampires distinct from all other Sabbat. The Black Hand (also known simply \nas the Hand or, less frequently, the manus nigrum) is not a wholly independent \nsect, however, as all Hand members are also loyal members of the Sabbat. The \nBlack Hand consists of vampires of many different clans, but it draws most of \nits membership from the Assamite and Gangrel antitribu. It also includes many \nmilitant vampires, for whom clan is often a tertiary concern at best, as they \npursue the Sabbat’s ideal of freedom. \nConceived as aspecialmilitia, the Black Hand is, at its simplest, amilitary \nforce at the disposal of Sabbat leaders. Like a true army, the Hand specializes \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nin numerous aspects of warfare, from intrigue and intelligence to assassination \nto outright physical combat. The Black Hand seldom remains active for any \nlong period of time, instead sending small, focused units or packs to attend to \nthe issue at hand. Indeed, very few vampires can even remember a time when \nthe whole of the Hand acted simultaneously at all. Sabbat elders seem to prefer \nthis arrangement, and some secretly fear that this sect-within-a-sect would \nattempt a coup if kept active for too long. Throughout its history, however, the \nBlack Hand has always served the Sabbat with unwavering loyalty. Many \nSabbat credit the Black Hand with the cohesion of the sect through difficult \ntimes. Indeed, the Black Hand remained solvent during two Sabbat civil wars, \nenabling the sect to maintain influence in cities that would have otherwise \nfallen to the Camarilla. \nMembers of the Black Hand bear a distinguishing mark - \nthe faction \nbrands its members with a permanent, mystical sigil on the palms of their right \nhands. Once the vampire receives this mark, she has become a true member of \nthe Black Hand and must heed the group’s call whenever she receives it. \nAlthough members may conceal the brand (which spies for the group often do \nto keep from revealing themselves), they may never remove it. Membership in \nthe Black Hand lasts until the vampire meets her Final Death. \nTHE \nSABBAT \nINQUISITION \nTaking its cue from the mortal Spanish Inquisition, the Sabbat Inquisi- \ntion is a political faction charged with rooting out heretics and infernalists. Of \ncourse, the faction resembles the mortal Inquisition in other ways as well: If it \nlabels someone an infernalist, the accusation is unlikely to be denied, and the \nfaction makes a practice of using similarly torturous tactics. As it possesses the \npower to depose bishops, archbishops, pack priests and ducti, the Sabbat \nInquisition is a political entity as well. It stands on the cusp of becoming a \npolitical tool, but has yet to do so, largely because its members are devout in \ntheir duties and respond poorly to attempts at manipulation. \nThe Sabbat Inquisition has recently doubled in size, from 15 to 30 \nmembers, largely owing to its success. All members of the Inquisition are \nrespected and trusted (and powerful ...) members of the Sabbat. Cells of \nInquisitors travel to all Sabbat-held territories, presiding over trials and \ndeliveringpunishments against accused Sabbat. Despite its success in exposing \ninfemalists, however, the Inquisition has acquired a reputation for cruelty, no \nmean feat among those who willingly label themselves monsters. \nThe Inquisition has unprecedented power, able to move and accuse as it \nwill. Nomadic Inquisitors usually travel in groups of five, accompanied by a pair \nof templars. Although their success leaves the Sabbat better for its interfer- \nence, the Inquisition has made few friends. Many bishops and archbishops \nresent the Inquisition’s presence, as the Inquisitors tend to disrupt the usual \naffairs of the sect and dig up dirt on all Cainites in a given city. Rumors claiming \nantagonism between the Black Hand and the Inquisition rise and circulate \nwith alarming frequency. The Sabbat expressly forbids members of one faction \nfrom joining the other, and some suspect this rivalry has resulted from the \nInquisition’s recent successes coupled with growing complaints of the Hand’s \nimpotence. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHE \nLOYALISTS \nThe Loyalist faction claims that it is the legacy of the “true” Sabbat, those \nvampires who shook off the yoke of their elders and seized their freedom for \nthemselves. Other Sabbat tend to dismiss Loyalists as anarchists, sociopaths \nand spoiled childer who want the benefits of the Curse of Caine without the \nresponsibilities. \nThe Loyalists’ philosophy is simple: Each vampire is her own master. The \nfreedom to do as one wills belongs to each vampire, whether she wants to \ndestroy the Antediluvians or go on a rampage through a suburban mall. In \npractice, few Loyalists stoop to such recklessness as they know local law \nenforcement would hunt them down, most likely at the behest of other \nvampires who actually value their secrecy. \nThe night no longer belongs to the Sabbat, Loyalists contend. Sect is \nirrelevant given the modem state of affairs; Sabbat packs are as powerless as \nCamarilla neonates or rabid anarchs because of the apathy and antagonism of \ntheir elders. As the original anarchs and antitriibu did in the nights of the \nAnarch Revolt, Loyalists do what they do because they believe they must. \nLoyalists accept anyone into their ranks, and they have no codes or secret \nrituals to identify themselves to one another. \nLESSER \n#ACTIONS \nSmaller in power and number, lesser factions exist among the Sabbat to \nhelp the sect and themselves. These lesser factions come and go, springing up \nalmost overnight and then falling out of favor or being wiped out in some \ngrandiose but doomed war effort. Some of the longer-standing intra-Sabbat \nfactions include the following. \nTHE \nSTATUS Quo \nAs their name suggests, things are good enough for the Status Quo. Made \nup primarily of Lasombra, Tzimisce and key members of the Black Hand, the \nStatus Quo accepts the nature of vampires and knows that change is relatively \nimpossible. The Great Jyhad continues, for better or worse, and shaking the \nfoundations of the Sabbat serves only to distract it from its greater goal. The \nStatus Quo does not want to increase the authoritarianism of the sect - \nits \nmembers aren’t after hoarding power for themselves because it promotes \nrebellion in the lower ranks. At the same time, increasingly unreasonable \ndemands from overly vociferous Loyalists and concerned Moderates serve only \nto agitate other members of the sect, and a compromise must be struck. \nMODERATES \nThe Moderates oppose what they see as increasing rigidity intruding into \nthe sect. Edicts such as the Purchase Pact and the revised Code of Milan limit \nthe rights of individual Sabbat for the good of a few. While not as vehement \nas the Loyalists, Moderates nonetheless oppose the encroachment of “rules and \nguidelines” that have no place among such creatures as vampires. The faction \nrests between Loyalist dogma and Status Quo conservatism, acknowledging \nthe need for order and structure, but not adherence to arbitrary codes that offer \nno benefit to offset their inconvenience. Moderates generally oppose sieges \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nand crusades (though they usually follow orders), and they do not hesitate to \nquestion those in charge if an order seems foolish or reckless. \nULTRA-CONSERVATIVES \nPredictably composed of the eldest members of the Sabbat, most of whom \nbelong to Clans Lasombra and Tzimisce, the Ultra-Conservatives favor \ncentralization and authoritarianism, hoping to turn the Sabbat into a military \nforce against the Antediluvians and the Camarilla. The time for freedom is \nover, claim the Ultra-Conservatives. Gehenna looms around the comer, and \nit’s time to stabilize the Sabbat, lest it fail utterly. Ultra-Conservatives favor \nstrong leaders and Monomacy, ritually removing weak leaders through duels. \nThe Black Hand seems to be slowly leaning toward support of the Ultra- \nconservatives, but it remains characteristically quiet when confronted with \nthe issue. \nOLD WORLD TZIMISCE \nNot every Tzimisce supports the Sabbat wholeheartedly. Indeed, when it \ncomes to the arcane Tzimisce of the Old World, few support it at all. Of course, \naligning oneself against the Sabbat is a good way to end up facing down a pack \nof self-important rabble who want to strike at the elders for the good of the \nSabbat and all that rubbish, so it’s often easier to join the society yet abstain \nfrom its meetings. Most keep to themselves, maintaining castles on ancestral \nlands like voivodes of old. \nTHE ORDER \nOE ST. BLAISE \nIn Europe during the 14th century, the Church established an auxiliary of \n14 saints to protect the plagued masses. One of the 14, St. Blaise, was known \nfor his ability to heal throat maladies. It became wide practice during this time \nthat devotees would have their throats blessed by a pair of crossed candles on \nFebruary third. Cainites active in the Church found it particularly ironic that \nthose same blessed throats would provide a sacred meal for vampires. Vampires \nof the Order of St. Blaise lead dangerous unlives, integrating themselves into \nthe hierarchy of the Roman Catholic Church. Through careful manipulation \nof Church resources and “good works” done at the community level, members \nof the order influence aspects of their cities in ways most Sabbat traditionally \nneglect. By establishing herds in soup kitchens and exempting certain build- \nings from tax status, the Order of St. Blaise expands the Sabbat’s power locally. \nIndeed, most Sabbat cities, rife with murder, rape and skyrocketing crime rates, \nsee an increase in Church attendance, brought about by desperate mortals’ \nattempts to find any salvation they can in the World of Darkness. \nCHILDREN \nOE THE DRACON \nA bizarre knightly order of Tzimisce vampires, the Children of the Dracon \nseem to bear more Hellenic features than the Slavic heritage of Clan Tzimisce \nsuggests. The Children seem to be a cultural division, almost a bloodline, but \nthe distinction is more artificial than a true deviation in the vitae. The exact \nagenda of the Children of the Dracon is unknown, but they seem to be at \nintellectual odds with the rest of the Tzimisce. Perhaps this is due to some past \ntransgression, or perhaps it lies in the difference of mortal stock from which the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nvampires were originally drawn. Whatever the case, the Children of the \nDracon do not antagonize the other Tzimisce so much as they take a consistent \nrole of Devil’s Advocate. If the Tzimisce favor a siege, the Children posit the \nvalues of holding back; if the Fiends support the Inquisition, the Children \nargue against giving any faction too much power. Although this seems \narbitrary, the Children seem to see themselves as the warders of their brothers. \nApparently, sometime in the mists of history, a Tzimisce made a decision that \naffected the entirety of his clan (perhaps resulting in the clan’s odd weakness). \nThe Children of the Dracon have sworn to make the Tzimisce consider the full \ngravity of their actions ... or perhaps atone for them. \nINPERNALISTS \nInfernalists - \ndevil-worshippers, Satanists, followers of the Path of Evil \nRevelations - \nare not truly a faction within the Sabbat. Rather, they are a \nsickness that plagues it. Infernalists have no formal structure as they rarely \nassociate with one another. The business of trafficking with demons is \ndownright medieval- the infemalist is a lone conjurer, dealing withdevilsfor \nhis own forbidden knowledge. The practice of infemalism runs contrary to \neverything the Sabbat believes in. While most infemalists see themselves as \ntaking a shortcut to power, the truth is that they are selling themselves into \ndemonic servitude. To the Sabbat, such servitude is completely counter to the \nideas of freedom to which the sect swears. The Inquisition’s leading purpose is \nthe tracking of these creatures, and woe to the fool whose infernal master \ndeserts him as his foes close in. \nTHE PACK \nVampires are by and large solitary creatures at heart. Sabbat do not \npractice solitude - \nthe nights are too dangerous to face completely alone \nwithout trustworthy comrades. For them, the pack becomes a strange mix of \ngang, family and platoon unit. \nPacks are typically organized with a single ductus to lead the group’s \nnightly activities, a priest to tend to spiritual needs and three to seven \nmembers. A pack‘s purposes may vary, from spying to computer hacking to \nbreaking the Masquerade in Camarilla cities to frontline fighting in the Jyhad. \nThe Sabbat may create some packs for such specific purposes of hunting relics \nor bringing down Lupines. \nFor a Sabbat vampire, the pack is everything. It is a surrogate family, bound \ntogether through ties of blood and reinforced through the Vaulderie. When all \nhell’s breaking loose, your pack will be always at your back. This isn’t to say that \nsuch families aren’t dysfunctional - \nsome packs’ dysfunction could fuel talk \nshows for years - \nbut there is some degree of mutual sympathy that runs \nthrough the dynamic, or they would have no reason to stay together. \nThere are two types of packs -nomadic \nand established. Nomadic packs \nare just that - \noften roaming the countryside in campers, on motorcycles, or \nstealing their transportation when the mood strikes them. Many are on \nscouting missions while others just prefer the freedom of wandering. Founded \npacks, on the other hand, choose a specific city to maintain a haven in, often \nserving the local bishop and keeping the mortals in line. Whatever they do, \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\npacks usually set up a communal haven (usually outfitted with a fantastic array \nof traps and escape routes), which has living quarters for eachpackmember and \ncommunal rooms for running rituals or storing weapons. \nTHE \nCREATION \nRITES \nMost Kindred only see the “shovelhead” method of the Creation Rites, \nwhere a new vampire is thwacked on the back of the head with a shovel, buried \nin a grave and then must dig her way out. Packs only use such means during \ntimes of Jyhad, when speed is of the essence and the childer are useful as cannon \nfodder. Away from crusades, the Sabbat take as much care in selecting their \nchilder and giving the Embrace as any other vampire. However, such new \nvampires must prove themselves before becoming True Sabbat. Without the \nCreation Rites, the new vampire is not a vampire in the eyes of the Sabbat: Her \npack may feed from her or order her into battle, and she is generally at their \nmercy. \nRites vary, but a priest always presides (or a higher authority if the initiate \nis an elder’s childe). The sire determines what form the rites should take, for \nit is he who decides if the childe should even receive the rite. Among Brujah \nuntitribu or other violent groups, the rites may be similar to gang-style \ninitiations. The Kiasyd may turn the childe loose in a strange library and order \nher to find a new piece of lore for her sire. A Toreador antitribu‘s rites could be \na masterfully executed flaying or blood-sculpture while a Malkavian antihibu \nrequires the initiate to cast an augury from the entrails of a still-living woman. \nFailure almost guarantees destruction - \nthe childe has embarrassed the sire, \nwho is unlikely to want a reminder of such, but success means the vampire \nbecomes a True Sabbat, another monster unleashed upon the night. \nA SABBAT \nLEXICON \nThe vampires of the Sabbat have evolved their own specialized patois, \nmuch of which takes into account their holy war on the Antediluvians and the \nattendant rituals and practices that follow it. Particularly old Sabbat vampires \neven recall terms and phrases that have long since passed into history. \nAlthough many of these terms are in common use among Sabbat vampires, \nsome of them take on different meanings colloquially, given the lack of formal \ncommunication among sect members. Vampires who would “talk the talk” are \nadvised to be aware of everything they say and what it means. \nAbbot -A vampire or ghoul charged with the maintenance of a pack‘s \ncommunal haven. \nAntitrib’bu - \nLiterally, “anti-tribe” or “anti-clan.” The antihibu are vam- \npires who have turned their backs on their “parent” clans and now espouse the \npolicies of the Sabbat instead. One notable exception to this rule is the \nLasombra untitribu, who have abandoned the Sabbat in favor of independent \nor Camarilla unlives. Parent clans hold their antitribu in low regard, especially \nthe Lasombra. \nArchbishop - \nA vampire who serves as the leader of a city under the \nSabbat’s influence. Not every Sabbat-held city claims an archbishop; some \nhave councils of bishops. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAuctoritas R i m  - \nA collection of 13 rituals practiced by all vampires of \nthe Sabbat, upheld in a manner similar to the Biblical 10 Commandments. \nBishop - \nA vampire who serves or advises an archbishop, or a vampire \nwho maintains Sabbat influence in a city with the aid of others of equal status. \nThose who are in the know liken bishops to the primogen of the Camarilla. \nBlack Hand - \nThe secret militia of the Sabbat. Some references allude \nto another organization with the same name. The “true” meaning of this term, \nif there is one, is a matter of much uncertainty, even among those who claim \nto be members. \nBlood Feast -A victim or group of victims, bound and suspended upside \ndown. Said victims serve as refreshment at Sabbat functions. \nBrave - \nA vampire participating in a war party. \nCainite -A vampire. Sabbat vampires use this term in places where other \nvampires would use the term Kindred. Sabbat vampires accept and claim \ndescent from Caine, while the Camarilla largely claims him to be a myth. \nCardinal - \nA Sabbat vampire who oversees the influential affairs of a \nlarge territory. A group of archbishops, who govern the affairs of local cities, \nattends each cardinal. \nChief - \nThe leader of a war party. \nCode of Milan - \nAn oft-referenced but rarely seen document developed \nas acode ofconduct for Sabbat vampires. Some Sabbat scoff at it, claiming that \ncodifying the sect’s behavior runs counter to everything the Sabbat stands for. \nColumn - \nA permanent pack of Black Hand members, usually nomadic. \nCommunal Haven - \nA single haven shared by an entire pack. \nConsistory -The body of advisors to the regent, composed of key prisci \nand cardinals. \nConvention of Thorns -The treaty that supposedly ended the Anarch \nRevolt and resulted in the formation of the Sabbat. \nCoven - \nA pack of Sabbat that makes a permanent haven in a city; used \nto differentiate between founded packs and nomadic packs. Most Sabbat cities \nhost numerous covens in addition to providing “hospitality” to a seemingly \nendless stream of nomadic packs. \nCreation Rites - \nThe special ritual marking a Sabbat vampire as \nbecoming a true member of the sect. The Creation Rites differ from the \nEmbrace in that anyone can be Embraced, but until he receives the Creation \nRites, the recruit is not a member of the Sabbat (and thus, not considered a \nvampire.. . ). \nDaughters and Sons (of Caine) -All vampires. A similar term with the \nsame meaning is “brothers and sisters.” \nDuctus - \nThe leader of a Sabbat pack. This title is a highly subjective \none, sometimes held by the meanest thug in a pack, sometimes acquired \nthrough ritual combat or genuine merit. The ductus decides the logistical \naffairs of her pack, though the wise ductus gives careful ear to her packmates’ \nvoices. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nEsbat - \nA weekly meeting held by a pack, whether nomadic or founded. \nCentral to the esbats are the auctorita and ignoblis rime as well as discussions \nof events that affect the pack. \nFestivodeIIoEstinto-The “Festival ofthe Dead,”agrandcelebrationheld \nduring the second week of April in Sabbat cities. All covens attend the festival, \nas do any nomadic packs that can make it. \nFire Dance - \nA ritual and rough celebration in which Sabbat vampires \nprove their loyalty and bravery by jumping through raging fires. Many Sabbat \nwar efforts and other events begin with fire dances. \nFounded Pack - \nA coven; a pack of Sabbat vampires that maintains a \npermanent haven in a city. \nGreat Jyhad - \nThe war for supremacy in the New World, begun in the \n17th century and arguably raging during the modem nights. \nHand - \nThe Black Hand. \nHeadhunter - \nA Sabbat vampire who collects the skulls of his fallen foes \nas trophies. Some headhunters collect only vampire skulls while others collect \nLupine skulls, mortals’ skulls or the skulls of witch-hunters. Sabbat consider \nthese trophies great honors, according to the degree of difficulty associated \nwith claiming them. \nHorseman- A nomadic Sabbat vampire, thought to have been inspired \nby the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. \nHulul - \nThe figurehead of the Assamite untitrib’bu, rumored to be ritually \ndestroyed every 100 years. \nlgnoblis Rim - \nThe rituals practiced by individual Sabbat packs to \nreinforce unity, loyalty and the causes of the Sabbat. These rituals vary from \npack to pack, and the Sabbat considers them less important individually than \nthe auctoritas ritae because they are not universally practiced. Some Sabbat \nmembers observe no ignoblis rim at all. \nJyhad - \nThe eternal conflict with other vampire sects. Sabbat use this \nterm more loosely than other vampires because almost all struggle is a holy war \nfrom the Sabbat point of view. In her mind, a Sabbat takes part in the Jyhad \nany time she fights. \nKindred - \nNon-Sabbat vampires. Most Sabbat use this term derisively, \nconsidering Camarilla vampires to be their inferior and laughing at their “big, \nhappy family” of vampires who cower from humankind. Many Sabbat also \napply the term “Kindred” sarcastically to vampires of independent clans, \nwhom they perceive as too selfish or foolish to take up the cause against the \nAntediluvians. \nLoyalist - \nA Sabbat vampire who refuses to acknowledge leaders among \nthe sect out of loyalty to its original goals. Loyalists believe that to be truly loyal \nto the Sabbat, they must have total freedom. Most Sabbat view Loyalists as \nagitators and dissidents, and their packmates and the elders watch them warily. \nMuch of the Sabbat’s terrifying reputation among other vampires may stem \nfrom the actions of particularly fervent Loyalists. \nMonomacy - \nA ritual duel between vampires of the Sabbat, held under \nformal rules. This duel is a traditional Sabbat means of settling disputes, and \nit often results in the Final Death of one of the participants. \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNomadic Pack - \nA pack that travels constantly in its duties to the \nSabbat. Nomadic packs maintain no permanent havens, but they sometimes \nkeep bolt-holes and emergency havens throughout the regions they travel. \nNomadic packs may also stop in cities for indeterminate periods of time, but \nthey eventually return to the roads. \nNomads - \nMembers of nomadic packs. \nPack- A group of Sabbat who have sworn the Vaulderie to one another. \nA Sabbat may belong to only one pack at a time - \nusually the one that enacted \nher Creation Rites - \nthough she may have ties of blood to other packs from \nher past. \nPaladin - \nA Sabbat vampire who serves another important vampire as \nan assassin or bodyguard. Also known as templars, most Sabbat fear paladins \nfor their disciplined martial prowess. The sect forbids paladins to hold \nmembership in the Black Hand. \nPalla G r a d  - \nA grand and terrible festival held on All Hallows Eve, \nwhen all Sabbat vampires in a city gather to celebrate and revere the sect. It \noften takes the appearance of a masquerade ball, and the sect sometimes invites \nhumans as guests - \nor refreshments. \nPaths of Enlightenment - \nThe belief systems followed by the majority \nof the members of the Sabbat in place of Humanity. Paths of Enlightenment \nare moral codes that serve to anchor the Sabbat vampire against her ravening \nBeast, though some paths encourage “riding” the Beast rather than controlling \nit. The most common paths practiced by the Sabbat include the Path of Caine, \nthe Path of Cathari, the Path of Death and the Soul, the Path of the Feral \nHeart, the Path of Honorable Accord, the Path of Lilith and the Path of Power \nand the Inner Voice. Some Sabbat follow the Path of Evil Revelations, though \nthese vampires are hunted by the Sabbat Inquisition as heretics and traitors to \nthe sect. \nPriest -The \nleader of Sabbat rime in a given pack.

Hereafter are some of the (more printable) terms \nSabbat vampires casually drop. Many of these terms have roots in modern \nslang, but with an added meaning for vampires. Some even transcend the \nboundaries of sect and may be used anywhere. \nBat - \nAn elder vampire of the Sabbat, who often has little in common \nwith younger members of the sect. \nBitch - \nA probationary pack member or a Sabbat of lesser status than the \nspeaker. \nChica - \nA female Sabbat vampire. \nCostello - \nDismissive term for the Camarilla.

These vampires recall the nights when the \nSabbat was born and have carried over or adopted phrases as old as they are. \nBeware the vampire who speaks in the tongue of the Sabbat elders, for she is \nsurely formidable and wicked beyond belief. \nAngellis Ater - \nThe “black angels” of Clan Lasombra, often young \nvampires who embrace the stereotypical and shallow evils of the modem night \nin blatant attempts to become monsters. \nKamut - \nA nomadic pack of Sabbat formed for a specific purpose, such \nas hunting Lupines, scouting Camarilla cities or exposing heretics. \nLacheur - \nA young Sabbat, particularly an insolent one.

Revenants are families \nof ghouls that have existed for so long with the blood of their undead masters \nin their veins that it now passes on to each of their descendants as well. The \nvampires of Clan Tzimisce seem to use revenants most often, and they are often \nheld in suspicion by others who know of their natures. \nShakari - \nThe eldest vampires among the Assamite antitdm \nSword of Caine - \nThe Sabbat. \nVoivode - \nThe leader of Clan Tzimisce. Some vampires postulate that \nthere is no single voivode, and the title is one of inscrutable significance to only \nthe Fiends themselves. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe Sabbat is a very diverse sect, with representatives from almost every \nmajor clan within its ranks. Although most Sabbat hail from the ranks of Clans \nLasombra and Tzimisce (see Laws of the Night), as many as half come from \nthe ranks of the antitribu or “anti-clans” that have turned their backs upon \ntheir progenitors. Additionally, a few strange bloodlines have arisen in the \nsect, with no connection to outside clans or bloodlines. In this way, the sect \nprepares itself for the coming Gehenna and the continual Great Jyhad of the \nAntediluvians by arming themselves with soldiers of many capabilities. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nASSAMITF \nANTITRIBU \nSince the Sabbat’s formation, the Assamite untitribu have played an \nimportant role in the sect and have become some of the most feared \nwarriors of the Sword of Caine. Assamite untihibu typically place more \nemphasis on following the ideals of their clan than on upholding the sect’s \npurposes, though many of their beliefs coincide. The Angels of Caine \nseek to bring themselves closer to Caine, whom mainstream Assamites \nregard as a cursed and corrupt infidel. For some reason, the two clans seem \nto have guarded respect for each other, for which no one outside can give \na plausible reason. Assamite untitribu claim superiority over their inde- \npendent brethren, whom they despise for accepting the Camarilla’s \npunishment during the Treaty ofThorns. Even though the curse has since \nbeen broken, feelings on the matter have not changed. \nLike their brethren, Sabbat Assamites excel at assassination and \nstealth. Assamite untitribu make up a potent martial force for the sect, \nown prominent members, the hulul, as a gesture of favor to their dark \nfather, and many of their practices are similarly grim in nature. \nRoleplaying Hints: You are a sword in the war of vengeance waged \nagainst the “Kindred,” their masters and anyone foolish enough to get \nin the way. You are not a mindless killer, though - \nwanton murder has \nno place in the war of the righteous. You rarely attempt to “convert” \nothers; forcing your principles upon those who do not wish to accept \nthem is vain and futile. Caine will recognize his own when he returns. \nDisciplines: Celerity, Obfuscate, Quietus \nAdvantage: Members of this clan of death-bringers have a legacy \nof success. Most Sabbat Cainites respect these vampires based on the \nsimple fact that the Assamite untitribu chose to Embrace them: Only the \nmost potent mortals receive such. All Assamite untitribu gain the \nSabbat Status of Feared. \nAdditionally, like members of their parent clan, Sabbat Assamites \noften train in the ways of violence even before receiving the Curse of \nCaine. Assamite untinibu gain either one Melee Ability or one Brawl \nAbility at no additional cost during character creation. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWeakness: The Sabbat Assamites have the same weakness as their \nprogenitor clan- indeed, they never lost it, for they never succumbed \nto the Tremere’s curse. Members of this clan frequently become \naddicted to the blood of other vampires. When a Sabbat Assamite tastes \nvampiric vitae, she must make a Self-Controlhtinct Test with a four- \nTrait difficulty. If she fails, the taste is not enough, and she takes as \nmuch blood as she can, maybe even draining the vessel. Even if the \nCainite succeeds in the test, the hunger should be roleplayed to the best \nof the player’s ability. \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBLOOD \nBROTHERS \nCreated through vile Tzimisce and Tremere magic in the castles \nand chantries of the Old World, the Blood Brothers are an artificial \n“bloodline” of soldiers and servants. Extensive experimentation in \nblood bonding resulted in a brutal collective of vampires linked by \ncommunal thought. Although the bloodline is known as the Blood \nBrothers, a few rumors circulate concerning female members, but \nwithout evidence the talk remains just that. \nBlood Brothers are built around a hive-mind, sharing thoughts and \nexperiences vicariously through other members of their “circles.” This \nallows them to workeffectively even at adistance. The bloodline excels \nat security, sabotage and coordinated attacks. The Frankensteins also \npractice an unpleasant Discipline that allows them to take advantage \nof their mental links and even ex \ntihibu, Blood Brothers \nRoleplaying Hints: Do what you are told. When you askquestions, \nthey relate to the completion of your responsibilities, not the purpose \nor validity of them. Your master knows best, and your reason for existing \nis to aid him in achieving his greater goals. \nNote: Obviously, with so little room for individual thought and \ncharacterization, the Blood Brothers do not usually make good choices \nfor ongoing player characters. The bloodline is best used by Storytellers \nas a plot device or simple (but very determined.. .) rivals. \nDisciplines: Fortitude, Potence, Sunguinus \nAdvantage: Blood Brothers are chosen for their hardiness. Due to \ntheir hale bodies and mystical origins, Blood Brothers become even \ntougher upon their “Embrace” (see below). During character creation, \nBlood Brother characters receive an additional two endurance-related \nPhysical Traits, such as Enduring, Resilient, Stalwart or Tough. \nWeakness: Blood Brother vitae is sterile. Created by mystical \nrituals, they are not Cainites in the literal sense of the word and they \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmay not Embrace mortals (though they may create ghouls). If a Blood \nBrother attempts to sire a childe (why would his master tell him to do \nthis?), the mortal simply dies. Note that with the loss of the Tremere \nuntinibu, few Cainites know how to create Blood Brothers, and the \nnumber of circles is shrinking. \nThe hive-mind and common creation ritual do have their detri- \nments. Blood Brothers share each others’ declivities as well as their \nstrengths: Any Blood Brother’s Negative Physical or Social Traits may \nbe bid against any other member of his circle in challenges. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBRUJAH \nANTITRIBU \nDuring the Anarch Revolt, many youn Brujah readily took up \ndalliance with the revolutionary ideology. The Brujah anarchs saw \nthis as another of the elders’ betrayals and treacheries against the \nyoung childer of Caine and now nurse an eternal grudge against those \nelders who joined the Camarilla. Most Sabbat Brujah are very \nsupportive of their sect, unlike the fractious and indolent Brujah of \nthe Camarilla. Not only do they support the sect with enthusiasm, \nthey have an active vision that Sabbat ideology (or propaganda, as \ntheir rivals suggest) serves to unify. \nthe cause. Several clan elders denounced t a e anarchs after a brief \nhave lost faith in the Lasombra \nsupport the Loyalist faction, and a few calm themselves long \nenough to contribute something of worth to the Black Hand or \nInquisition or become paladins. The Brutes are, quite possibly, the \nfuture of the sect. \nRole laying Hints: You’re a vampire, dammit, so you may as \noin to take that from you. Talk and planning have their place, \ntut tie Final Nights are the time for action! You may be undisci- \nplined or utterly calculating, but one thing is true in every case: \nThose who stand idly by never make the change that’s necessary \nto winning the war. \nwell act P ike it! The world is yours, and no elder’s puppets are \nDisciplines: Celerity, Potence, Presence \nAdvantage: Sabbat Brujah may be vocal firebrands, reasoned \nintellectuals or bare-knuckled hooligans, like their Camarilla kin, but \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthey tend to be less involved with the influential side of things. Instead \nof a bonus Influence Trait, Sabbat Brujah may take a second Ability \nduring character creation, free of cost, to reflect the time they spend \n“doing things the hard way.” Brujah may select two Abilities from the \nfollowing group: Politics, Academics, Brawl and Streetwise, or any \ncombination. \nWeakness: Brujah untitriibu suffer the same short tempers and \nclan, as their blood carries the same passion \nBrujah suffer one-Trait penalties on tests of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nC~ANC~RFL \nANTITRIBU \nLike the bestial vampires of legend, the Gangrel antirribu display the \nSabbat’s animalistic side. Whether the predatory City Gangrel or the \nuntamed Country Gangrel, Sabbat Gangrel are tireless hunters whose skill in \nthe pursuit of prey knows no peer. Like animals, they are consummate \nstalkers, reveling in the thrill of the hunt and gorging themselves on the \nblood of their victims. \nGangrel antitribu have two distinct bloodlines, with two very different \ntastes in the modem nights. The Country Gangrel still somewhat resemble \ntheir parent clan, shunning society and prowling the nights alone. They \nconjure images of the vampires of legend, assuming animal forms and \nuntry Gangrel serve the Sabbat as \nstream” Gangrel from \nthe Camarilla, the Sabbat has seen many converts to their cause from their \nrival sect. Although the defectors remain tight-lipped about the event that \ndrove them away, it seems to have given them a new conviction for the \nSabbat’s cause. \nRoleplaying Hints: Cainites are as much Beast as they are Man, and you \nembody this fact. Your unlife depends upon your instincts - \nlet the \nLasombra scheme and the Tzimisce indulge their perversities; they have lost \ntouch with what it means to be a vampire. Whether you are a feral monster \nor a refined predator, you indulge your more primitive nature to survive. \nDisciplines: Animalism, Fortitude, Protean (Country Gangrel); Celerity, \nObfuscate, Protean (City Gangrel) \nAdvantage: As they embrace their animalistic natures, the Gangrel of \nthe Sabbat are knowledgeable of the ways of beasts, so they gain one Animal \nKen Ability at no extra cost during character creation. \nGangrel antitribu often feel the same wanderlust as their parent clan. As \nsuch, they often spend (or have spent) some period of their unlives alone and \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n+F \ni \ne \naway from the comforts of permanent havens. They gain one Survival Ability \nduring character creation at no extra cost. \nWeakness: After frenzies, the Beast leaves a mark of its passage on the \nGangrel untitn'bu. When a Gangrel experiences a frenzy, she acquires an \nanimalistic feature and a Negative Social Trait - \nBestial, Feral or Repugnant \n- \nin the aftermath. These Traits may not be removed except by exceptional \nmeans (such as powerful magic or Vicissitude, though they may be hidden by \ncertain powers of Obfuscate). The character may gain no more than five \nNegative Traits in this manner. Indeed, some Sabbat Gangrel barely re- \nsemble the human stock from which they came.. . . \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nHARBINC~FRS \nOE SKULLS \nThis enigmatic cult of necromancers has only recently joined the Sabbat, which \nthey claim to have done solely for the purpose of vengeance. Members of the bloodline \nare almost all of advanced age, and many speak of returning from exile in the realms of \nthe Underworld. As they tell the tale, a murderous band of sorcerers hunted them for their \nblood in nights long past, driving them to extinction to serve their own desires for power. \nOther members of the sect describe the Laarenes as aloof and guarded. Some even \nallude to the Harbingers as paranoid, or perhaps tainted by madness after whatever ordeal \nthat consumed them for so long. Only a few of these Cainites are known to exist, but they \nhave accumulated an inordinate amount of power and voice in the sect for such a short \nperiod of membership. The Black Hand, the Inquisition and the consistory all have \nmembers of the Harbingers among them. \nThe Harbingers of Skulls wie \nagic as effectively as any Giovanni, \nperhaps more so for their time in t \nId. The sect regards the Lazarenes’ \nNecromancy as a great benefit, \nthat the Camarilla has yet to \nexplore. Some speculate this m \npurpose in the Sabbat - \nnew \npower in exchange for favors \nThe Embrace \nemaciated cadavers, \nwhich they often he \nhence their name). \nWhether they do this as \nir rivals is unknown. \nAlso, the bloodline has a \nat relies on masks - \nprominent members wear \nmbers have simpler masks. \nd, and yours has chilled for \ncenturies. The Sabbat is a too \ntical agenda is secondary, but \nas long as you assist the sect, yo \nn call upon as you need them. \nYou don’t care who knows this \nbbat have no illusions regarding \nyour mercenary nature. To the \nto you they are weapons to turn \nupon your hated foes. \nNote: Vampires of advanced age comprise this bloodline, and they are often not \na viable option for player characters. Storytellers should feel free to restrict this \nbloodline to Storyteller characters or elder games. \nRoleplaying Hints: R \nDisciplines: Awpex, Fortltde, Necromancy \nAdvantage: The Harbingers of Skulls are no strangers to the realms ofpolitics, and \nare certainly not above using Necromancy to unearth secrets for blackmail material. \nDuring character creation and at no extra cost, a Harbinger of Skulls may take any \npermutation of three of the following Traits: Sabbat Status, one Influence or a trivial \nboon. For example, a player may choose for his character to possess one Sabbat Status \nTrait and two Church Influence Traits, or two Sabbat Status Traits and one trivial boon. \nWeakness: As the Harbingers of Skulls resembles corpses, they are as visually \nunpleasant as the most twisted Nosferatu. They suffer a similar Weakness: Every \nHarbinger possesses the Negative Social Traits Ghastly x 3 whenever they reveal their \ntrue forms. These Traits may never be removed by Free Traits or Experience Traits \n(though they may be hidden by Obfwcate). They may never possess Traits relating to \nappearance such as Gorgeous or Seductive. Harbingers may not initiate Social Chal- \nlenges, though they may defend against them normally. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nI \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nKIASYD \nAn inscrutable line of fey-blooded Cainites, the Kiasyd are small \nin number and seem to have few active relations with the Sabbat, \nhis lair to utter some cryptic warning or charge a bishop with an \ninscrutable quest. \nRoleplayin Hints: Unlife is not something to be frivolously \nblessing if it is used to unravel the mysteries of the world. Still, \nruthlessness has its place, and one should not hesitate to use the \npowers at one’s command. After all, the young Cainites are thirsty, \nand the blood ofelders, Kiasyd or otherwise, is always on their minds. \nKeep them in their place with the odd bit of lore and a healthy dose \nof fearful respect. \nNote: Because of their elder natures and sheer rarity, Kiasyd are \nbest used as Storyteller characters. \nDisciplines: Dominate, My therceriu, Obtenebrution \nAdvantage: The Kias d often spend their unlives in search of \nsecrets, and much of the ‘6 loodline’s concept of prestige balances \nwasted on batt P e or conquest. The curse of immortality can be a \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nupon how much a given member knows. To reflect this undying \nthirst for knowledge, Kiasyd gain two Lore Abilities of their choice \nduring character creation at no extra cost. This often takes the \nform of Kindred Lore as it is most useful, but a few Kiasyd have \nuncovered the practices of the Lupines or puzzled out the riddles of \nthe Wild Ones. \nWeakness: The Weirdlings seem to have some tie to the fae \n- \ncold iron causes them pain and discomfort. Simply being in \nthe presence of iron causes the Kiasyd to suffer a one-Trait \npenalty on Self-ControllInstinct tests. Any damage inflicted upon \na Kiasyd by an iron weapon is considered aggravated. \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMALKAVIAN \nANTITRIBU \nThe violent, dangerous nature of the Sabbat offers no solace for the fractured \nminds of the Malkavians. Indeed, Sabbat Malkavians are often more deranged \nand psychotic than their Camarila counterparts. Still, the old maxim of method \nlying beneath madness often proves true for the Sabbat - \nthe seemingly \nincomprehensible actions of the Malkavians confound the sect’s foes, and more \nthan one conflict has been won at the hands of a Malkavian tactician. \nStill, chaos is a dangerous element, and it festers in the minds of the \nMalkavianantinih. At varying points lucid and manic, Sabbat Malkavians are \nno more reliable than others of their mad line as insanity takes its toll on them. \nMalkavians of the Sabbat tend to have vicious edges to their insanity, and the \nclan claims a number of serial killers, mass murderers, cannibals and other \nwould rather look away than see it plainly. You suffer no such delusion, \nhowever; the truth has warped you in its own unique way, but you know its \nnature. Or perhaps you don’t - \nperhaps Fate has played the ultimate trick \nupon you and lied to you very successfully. Still, if that’s the case, who would \nknow unless they had the strength to observe it themselves? That’s what you \ntell yourself. That’s how you abate the fever in you mind each night: Even if \nyou’re completely wrong, you’re still less wrong than the ones who can’t bear \nto learn. \nDisciplines: Auspex, Dementution, Objmcate \nAdvantage: Malkavian insanity is the price of insight, or so the clan \nmaintains. Whether or not this is true, Sabbat Malkavians experience bursts \nof clarity to which other Cainites seem nigh oblivious. During character \ncreation, Malkavian untinibu gain one extra Awareness Ability at no extra cost. \nSabbat Malkavians share the mysterious connection to the network of \nfractured minds known as the “madness network.” Sometimes their insight is \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthe result of their uncommon vision, but it is also the product of the whispered \nvoices that travel ceaselessly through the minds of all Malkavians. \nWeakness: Afflicted by the curse of insanity, every Malkavian antitribu \nsuffers from some form of derangement, which the player chooses during \ncharacter creation. This derangement may never be removed or permanently \ncured, though Willpower Traits may temporarily overcome it. \nAdditionally, the Sabbat breeds unrest and lessens a Malkavian antitriibu's \ncontrol over the Beast (whether through lack of discipline or too much \nindulgence in monstrousness). A Sabbat Malkavian may not spend a Willpower \nTrait to control herself during a frenzy - \nshe must ride it through to the end. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNOSPFRATU \nANTITRIBU \nElders of the sect suspect that the Nosferatuantitribu joined the \nSabbat less out of hatred for their sires than out of something \nlurking beneath the clan’s own veil of secrecy. Nosferatu of the \nSabbat seem to be on the best terms with their Camarilla counter- \nparts of all the clans of the Sword of Caine, but why? As expected, \nthe Nosferatu and their antitribu close ranks when asked about it - \nthe problem is theirs alone. \nThe Nosferatu antitribu are as hideously deformed as their Camarilla \ncounterparts, making their havens in the sewers under their cities, \nthe inside as they are on the outside. \nRoleplaying Hints: Sabbat, Camarilla, whatever. That doesn’t \nmatter too much. What’s important is knowing what eo le need \nyou to know because that puts them in our debt. Unli K R  \ne t e other \nbecause the ancient tales of your clan tell that it has loosed a horde \nof hunters upon you. The more peo le who owe you favors, the \nmore people upon whom you can ca P 1 to tell you what they know, \nthe more aware you’ll be when the end of the world arrives. And \njust maybe you’ll be able to survive it. \nclans, you fear your Antediluvian rat K er than hating it blindly \nDisciplines: Animalism, Obfuscate, Potence \nAdvantage: When one is a hideously disfigured monster, one \neither dies quickly or adapts to her environment. The Nosferatu \nantitribu are hale Cainites, tough and determined. Every Sabbat \nNosferatu gains one free Stealth Ability and one free Survival Ability \nduring character creation. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWeakness: The other side of wretched ugliness, and the most \nsignificant, is the toll it takes upon one’s social capabilities. No \nNosferatu unticribu may ever acquire the Traits Gorgeous, Alluring or \nSeductive unless they use magical means or a Discipline. Additionally, \nNosferatu unticribu suffer the Negative Social Traits Repugnant x 3 \nwhen they show their visage, and these Traits may never be removed \nwithout some outstanding circumstance. Sabbat Nosferatu may not \ncall for a Social Challenge (except intimidation), though they may \ndefend against them normally. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPANDERS \nAlthough not truly a clan (no Antediluvian is believed to have \nfounded the bloodline), the Panders have made a lace for themselves \n[as no known clan becomes a Pander as do childer Panders Embrace. \nA broad spectrum of Cainites comprise the Panders, most of whom are \nyoung and rowdy. Haughty Cainites should beware, however; Panders \nare True Sabbat, not just a proving ground for embarrassing childer. \nThe Panders came to be reco nized during the late 1950s. \nIm ressed with the efforts of the ra ble leader Joseph Pander, the \ndespite their inaus icious origins. Like Caiti 8 - \nwhich, for all \nractical purposes, t K ey are - \nany vampire who joins the Sabbat and \nel 2 \ners of the Sabbat rewarded his sect-loyal followers with formal \nin the Final Nights. \nRoleplaying Hints: This is the Sabbat: If you don’t prove you’re \nworth something, then you’re not. Proving yourself can take any \nform - \nmaybe you’re a smooth diplomat, maybe you know all the \nright people, or maybe you’re just really good at putting the hurt on \nCainites who need it, but whatever it is, you do it well. After all, you \nhave to - \nif you’re no ood, you’re going to end up as a pile of ashes. \nyou’re useful. In a vampire’s world, you have to rely on yourself \nYou can’t rely on the e k ders because they only indulge you so lon as \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDisciplines: Any. Panders have no specific clan Disciplines, \nchoosing and learning Disciplines as per Caitiff (see Laws of the \nNight, p. 63 and 124). \nAdvantage: Panders have no innate advantage. \nWeakness: The benefit of having no advantage is that the \nPanders also have no inherent disadvantage - \nthe blood of Caine \nis so polluted, weak or subverted in them that they carry none of the \ntraditional banes or benefices of the clans. Note that few Panders \never achieve an significant degree of Sabbat Status, however. Also, \nlower than Ninth Generation. \nbecause their b Y ood is so diluted, no Pander may begin the game \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRAVNOS \nANTITRIBU \nAccording to the spotty oral history of the clan, a faction of Ravnos \nCainites split from their Gypsy heritage after the formation of the \nSabbat. Sabbat vampires didn’t torment each other with complex \nHindu dharma riddles or deny that the Beast was a part of them. The \nSabbat became a haven for these young defectors who became the first \nRavnos untitriibu. \nOver the years, the Rogues have distanced themselves from the sect, \nhelping when it suits them and otherwise generally doing whatever they \nplease. Many Sabbat wonder why they claim membership in the sect at \nall. The Ravnos untihibu maintain that it is for their own identity: They \nno longer observe the ways of their original clan and have freed them- \nRoleplaying Hints: You do what you want and if it helps the \nSabbat, so much the better. That way, they owe you something, or at \nleast that’s how you see it. Your sire’s sire may have joined the sect to \nescape the old clan’s games, but you know the score - \nthe Sabbat’s just \nlike any other group of Cainites, full of liars and bastards looking out for \ntheir own desires. And since you know that, you have no problems \nupholding those ideals yourself; after all, it’s not like you’re pretending \nyou’re better than anyone else. \nDisciplines: Animalism, Chimers?, \nFortitude \nAdvantage: Sabbat Ravnos know the value of learning the ins and \nouts of the low-life. Whether they travel each night or they settle down \ninto a comfortable haven, Ravnos untitriibu cultivate the contacts and \nopportunities necessary to keeping their unlives safe. During character \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncreation, a Ravnos untinibu may take a Contacts Trait or Street Influence \nat no additional cost. \nAlso, their nomadic tendencies instill in them a keen sense for how \nto survive in less than ideal situations. Sabbat Ravnos also receive an \nadditional Survivul or Stealth Ability at no extra cost. \nWeakness: Blood is stronger than politics and the Ravnos still \nsuffer the same urges for vice as their parent clan. Each Ravnos untinibu \nhas a passion for a “signature crime,” whether theft, murder, con games \nor even the blood of inebriated vessels. Any time the Ravnos untitribu \nfaces his vice of choice, he must indulge it unless he succeeds at a three- \nTrait Self-ControllInstinct test. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSALUBRI \nANTITRIBU \nThe Salubri antihibu have only recently joined the Sabbat, though \nthey have established themselves as fervent opponents of the Camarilla, \nwhom they blame for the destruction of their clan progenitor. Although \nthey care little for the ideals of the Sabbat, they claim membership in the \nsect out of necessity rather than true support. The Sabbat is happy to take \nany allies it can find, and the Salubriuntitribu know how greatly the Sabbat \nhates the Camarilla. \nThe Sabbat Salubri make proud boasts regarding their effectiveness, \nclaiming that they have eliminated the Cainites responsible for slaying their \nfounder. Driven by vengeance, the Salubri untirn’bu operate as furious \nwarriors, though their own private grudges easily distract them. Most Sabbat \ntorment, ending only \nThe Furies are as \nare a bloodline. \nnd more a result \nttle status in the \nCamarilla, in which the Sabbat is nothing but a convenient ally. Whether \nor not you know the specifics of why the fight is so dire (which not every \nSalubri antitdm does), you know that the cause is justified. The bloodline is \nalmost a cult or religion, so fiercely does it believe in its own cause and the \nneed for atonement. This fervor serves you well, for it gives you purpose \nwhen you rise for the night. \nDisciplines: Auspex, Fortitude, Vakren \nAdvantage: In studying their past, the Sabbat Salubri acquire some \nknowledge of the world’s supernatural mysteries. During character creation, \neach member of the bloodline gains one free Occult Ability at no extra cost. \nThe bloodline places great emphasis on accepting one’s vampiric \nnature. If the player chooses to have his character assume a Path of \nEnlightenment at character creation, he gains one Morality Trait, free of \ncharge. This may not take a beginning character above three Morality Traits \nat the beginning of the game, however. \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWeakness: Angry, impassioned creatures, the Salubri antitribu must \ntake the blood that sustains them from fallen enemies or otherwise by force. \nBlood that is freely offered to them does not give them any Blood Trait \nbenefit - \nthey must take their sustenance in the heat of passion. \nAdditionally, the Salubri untitribu are few in number, and their spec- \ntrum of generations is not very broad. All Salubri untitribu must begin the \ngame between 10th and 12th Generation. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSERPENTS \nOE THE LIC~HT \nThe Serpents of the Light are a renegade cult of the Followers of \nSet. The Serpents bear little connection to their parent clan: While \nmany Setites trace their lineages to Egypt, the Serpents claim they \noriginated in the West Indies. Some Cainites propose that the first \nSerpents were orphaned Setites who agreed with the political ideology \nof the Sabbat. \nThe formative Serpents sought protection from their hostile fore- \nbears in the ranks of the Sabbat, and the animosity between the \nSerpents of the Light and the Setites grew nightly afterward until the \nSerpents proclaimed total independence from the Followers of Set. \nto torment eac \ntheir means are v \nRoleplaying Hints: Manipulation by seduction is your tool of \nchoice, after which you discern your mark‘s weakness -be it drugs, sex, \npower or whatever - \nand bring your victim under your influence. You \ngenerally prefer to operate under cover or away from the sight of others, \nextending your influence through minions and dupes without identify- \ning yourself and drawing attention. You have a “fight fire with fire” \nattitude when it comes to conflict with the Setites and, when you \nencounter it, the Camarilla. \nDisciplines: Obfuscate, Presence, Serpentis \nAdvantage: Like their parent clan, the Serpents of the Light \ninvolve themselves in the underworld and its vice markets. Of course, \nthey do this for good reason: Their vitality depends upon it. To reflect \ntheir connections with the criminal culture and those peripheral to it, \neach Serpent of the Light gains one extra Streetwise Ability at no \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nadditional cost during character creation. Also, the Serpent may take \none Influence at no extra cost from the following list: Political, Street or \nUnderworld. \nWeakness: As vampires - \nespecially those who hail from a dark \ngod of the Egyptian underworld - \nSerpents of the Light are creatures \nof the night, despite their name. They are very sensitive to light, even \nfrom the dimmest and most artificial source. Exposure to sunlight causes \nthem to suffer an additional health level of damage. Other sources of \nbright light (such as spotlights, flares, halogen street lights, etc.) inflict \na one-Trait penalty for all actions undertaken in the light. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTOREADOR \nANTITRIBU \nIn the early nights of the sect, the Toreador antitribu layed \nan instrumental role in bringing the Sabbat together. &ch of \nwhat tookplace after the Convention ofThoms did so with the \nuidance of Toreador anarchs who would later lead the sect. \n%h e nascent Toreador antitribu established much of the sect’s \nstructure as well as outlining many of the sect’s beliefs. \nThe Perverts have adopted roles not too dissimilar from the \nyours to make. \nDisciplines: Auspex, Celerity, Presence \nAdvantage: Because they must move through the ranks of \nsociety with ease, Toreador antitribu often learn the concepts \nand concerns of the people with whom they meet. Every \nToreador gains any combination of two Traits from the follow- \ning: Academics Crafts, Performance or Subterfuge (she may take \ntwo separate Yraits or the same one twice) at no extra cost. \nWeakness: While art and beauty mesmerize the Toreador \nthe Toreador untitribu have come to be fascinated b pain and \ndispleasure. Whether their own or that of others, B \niscomfort \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nveritably hypnotizes the Sabbat Toreador. When confronted \nwith a scene of pain or the o portunity to do harm (no matter \ndark passion, or else spend a Mental Trait to free hersel from \nthe temptation. This may be as simple as making a callous \nremark or as grave as torture or murder. \nf: \nhow inconsequential), the f \noreador untitrin’bu must indul e the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nVFNTRUF \nANTITRIBU \nCenturies ago, according to the Ventrue untitribu, members of their \nclan were knights and aristocrats, masters of statecraft and diplomacy. \nAfter the Anarch Revolt and the formation of the Camarilla came the \nRenaissance, and the Ventrue changed with the times. Rather than \nremain nobles, they pursued financial interests, joining the merchant \nclass. They abandoned nobility and the right of kings to rule. \nSo say the Ventrue untitribu. The Ventrue anarchs who had \nopposed their elders during the revolt had chafed under the dominance \nof their aged sires. As mortal society evolved, these elders tightened \ntheir grip on their holdings, preventing younger and more able Ventrue \nfrom achieving what was rightfully theirs. The Ventrue had given up \nchilder. Gehenna may come, but Cainites, as tools of God’s vengeance \nand the Devil’s will, should dominate the Children of Seth. \nRoleplaying Hints: You bear the task of paving the way for the \nchilder of Caine to their proper place. After the Antediluvian threat has \nbeen destroyed, you will help usher in a new era of Cainite supremacy. \nUntil then, however, you must fight tirelessly. To accept anything else is \nto take the path of the disgraced Ventrue of the Camarilla, and that’s not \na failure you’re willing to accept. \nDisciplines: Dominate, Fortitude, Presence \nAdvantage: Their passionate dedication to their cause has given \nthe Ventrue untitribu a powerful reputation among the Sons and \nDaughters of Caine. At the beginning of the game, Ventrue untitribu \ngain one Sabbat Status Trait from the following list at no additional \ncost: Respected, Righteous, Passionate or Feared. \nCrusaders come from hale stock, with skills necessary for the Great \nJyhad. Also at no additional cost, a Ventrue untitribu player may take \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\none of the following Abilities for her character during character \ncreation: Academics, Finance, Leadership, Melee or Politics. \nWeakness: Like their counterparts in the Camarilla, Sabbat Ventrue \nsuffer selective tastes when it comes to the matter of feeding. Ventrue \nmay take only blood that meets the exacting requirements of their \nrestriction (though they may Embrace as normal). This comes into play \nnot only during the course of the game, in which the character may take \nsustenance only from his prey group, but also at the beginning of the \ngame - \nVentrue unticribu begin play with one less Blood Trait than \nother vampires of their generation. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe following is a brief description of character creation, adapted from \nLaws of the Night, for Sabbat characters. The lists of Attributes, Abilities and \nMerits and Flaws are by no means complete - \nfor more detailed information \non character creation, see Laws of the Night. \nSTEP ONE: INSPIRATION \nArguably the most important step in character creation is the formation \nof the basic concept. Every vampire was once a normal human, after all, with \nhopes, fears, dreams and ambitions. Once Embraced, the character brings her \nparticular views to her new unlife. These strengths and weaknesses shape the \ncharacter’s Traits, capabilities and limitations. The first step in creating a \ncharacter is to come up with a basic idea of the person. Don’t worry about \ndetails now; think more in terms of broad brushstrokes. Create the person \nbefore you create the vampire. \nCLAN \nWith a base concept in mind, determine your character’s clan. Did he \narrive by a mass Embrace (which wasn’t too picky about a particular breed)? \nDid the clan select her for certain qualities (a savage outlook on life? her \nruthless dealings with other people) ?The choice of clan influences acharacter’s \ndevelopment heavily. The clan also determines the sorts of Disciplines, \nstrengths and weaknesses innate to the character. \nThere are few or no Caitiff in the Sabbat. While those born without a clan \nare common (given the rampant siring that occurs during certain rituals and \ntimes of war), they have banded together as a clan of their own- the Panders. \nIf you wish to play a true Caitiff, outside the Pander clan, you will need a very \ngood reason to have been excluded from the “family.” \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNATURE \nAND DEMEANOR \nTo define a character’s personality, choose an Archetype. Each Arche- \ntype lists an underlying motivation, a reason for a character to behave in \nspecific ways. The Archetypes described here are, by no means, the final list \nof personalities; Storytellers can suggest and approve any further number of \nArchetypes. Bear in mind that the more “humane”Natures or Demeanors are \nsimply inappropriate: Those without the stomach for the job rarely survive. \nA character’s Nature is her innermost persona, the true basis of her \nmotives. By contrast, the Demeanor is the public face, the one a character \nshows to everyone else. On occasion, Nature and Demeanor may be the same. \nIn the Sabbat, an individual’s Demeanor is most likely very close to her true \nself - \nthe Sabbat has little time for duplicity. Also, your pack will be aware of \nyour Nature, even if you attempt to hide it from others. \nListed below are a number of Sabbat-specific Archetypes. Of course, feel \nfree to use Archetypes listed in Laws of the Night or to create your own with \napproval from your Storyteller. \nCapitalist - \nYou are the ultimate mercenary, with a keen understanding \nof how to manipulate others. \nChameleon- You can blend into any situation, able to pass yourself off as \nanything. You have no true loyalties. \nCreep Show - \nYou strive to shock and disgust, to intimidate and control \nothers. \nDaredevil -You \nlove taking risks and will seize any opportunity to do so. \nDark Pioneer-You \ncan’t change the traditions of the past, but you can be \nDark Poet -You \nwant to share the beauty of darkness with the rest of the \nDrunk Uncle - \nWhen things are going well, you’re everyone’s best friend. \nEnigma -Your \nactions are bizarre, uncontrolled; your erratic behavior is \nEye of the Storm - \nDespite your calm outward appearance, you surround \nGuru - \nYou seek enlightenment and cling to your idealism, trying to \nRecruiter - \nIt makes sense to build your side up before trying to tear theirs \nSadist -You \nexist to inflict pain and suffering. Killing is too easy- they \nSociopath- All inferior beings should be eradicated. You have no remorse \nStalker-The chase is all; the capture and feeding is almost anticlimactic. \nSorority Sister-you dowhatever the “in”crowddoes, and youdo itbetter. \nTorturer - \nPain isn’t a profession for you - \nit’s a calling. \nthe force that drives the future. \nworld. \nWhen they are going poorly, you’re their worst nightmare. \nconsidered insanity by those you meet. \nyourself with chaos and death. \nconvert others. \ndown. \nhave to know pain. \nor compassion. You are a machine. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPATHS \nOE ~ ~ N L I C ~ H T E N M E N T  \nEvery vampire struggles with the Beast Within, the predatory drive of \nhunger that pushes Cainites to acts of fury, desperation and horror. Only by \nclinging to a moral compass can a vampire resist the slide into total depravity. \nVampires of the Sabbat feel that Humanity is a lesser path, and seek \nalternate means of controlling their Beasts. The Paths of Enlightenment have \nexisted for as long as many Sabbat can remember, guiding those who follow \nthem away from Wassail. Those who follow these Paths have no Humanity left; \nthe Paths espouse utterly alien (albeit wholeheartedly vampiric) beliefs and \nmorals. The Sabbat insists on placing its recruits on Paths so that they are more \nsuited to leave mortal society behind and accept their new existence. \nAt this step in character creation, decide on your Morality. As strange as \nit might sound, many Sabbat neonates (usually the very young) take their early \nyears still clinging to their Humanity; they simply haven’t had the time or \nexperience to completely cast off all their mortal side, but those who cling for \ntoo long don’t survive long enough to change. However, Sabbat past their \nneonate years are often on a Path of Enlightenment, guided by their priests or \nmentors. Paths of Enlightenment are not for beginning players; they are utterly \ninhuman codes of behavior that demand intense roleplay. Consult your \nStoryteller if you’re unsure what your character should follow. \nSTEP Two: ATTRIBUTES \nNatural capabilities use Attributes for descriptions. You determine your \ncharacter’s natural talents, selecting whether your character is to be physically \nadroit, mentally agile or socially adept. Once you’ve decided on your character’s \ninherent strengths, you should describe exactly the sorts of exceptional character- \nistics she possesses. In your primary area of Attribute development, choose seven \nTraits; in your secondary, choose five; in your tertiary area, select three Traits. \nDetails of the various Sabbat Paths are listed in Chapter Four. \nNEW ATTRIBUTES \nAttributes are descriptors of a character’s natural talent and capabilities. \nIn the Sabbat, some Attributes are considered a good mark of a sect member, \nwhile more “humane” ones are considered a liability. \nPhysical Attributes are the character’s general health, dexterity, stamina \nand general physical capability. The Sabbat values individuals who are good \nfighters, and strong workers. \nA character’s Social Attributes are a definition of her personality, her \ninternal capacity to interact with others and her ability to lead and to follow. \nThe Sabbat typically chooses only the most ruthless and aggressive personali- \nties, bringing hardened killers and other amoral individuals into the sect. \nWhile the Sabbat does occasionally choose individuals who are beautiful, \nsmooth and competent, the sect encourages certain behaviors and morals. \nMental Traits define the character’s capacity for learning and reasoning. \nThe Sabbat typically does not value most types of study, but they do support \noccult education and tactical training. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nLaws of the Night gives many examples of Traits that aplayer may choose \nto represent the character’s Mental, Social and Physical Attributes. The Traits \nlisted below are intended to add to those and define more Sabbat-specific \ncharacter Traits. Some of the Traits listed in Laws of the Night are recopied \nhere, under different areas (Callous, for example, is considered to be a desirable \nTrait in the Sabbat, whereas Empathetic is Negative). Only those Traits listed \nbelow are considered to have “changed sides,” although as always, your \nStoryteller is the final arbiter of what is appropriate. For the Sabbat chronicle \npurposes, the character receives a Bestial (not Callous) Trait when he frenzies \nand acquires a Negative Trait. \nIf you’re going to have a mixed chronicle, then you may not wish to \nexpand your system with these optional Traits. It’s not fair to make players try \nto guess at Negative Traits they’ve never seen before. However, if you’re \nrunning a strictly Sabbat chronicle, then feel free to encourage your players to \nuse these more “Sabbat-oriented” Traits. \np HYSICAL \nStrength-related: Vicious \nDexterity-related: Fierce \nStamina-related: Deadly, Savage \nMiscellaneous Physical: Aggressive \nAggressive: You are familiar with fighting, and eagerly match your opponent \nstrike for strike. \nUses: Combat \nDeadly: An indomitable strength of body, able to continue fighting despite \ndamage. \nUses: Combat. Fortitude tests. Second challenges or challenges after being \nwounded. \nFierce: Driven by your will to win, swift movements are easy for you. \nUses: Fighting an obviously superior enemy. \nSavage: You possess brutal intensity and an instinct for slaughter that rivals the \nmost ferocious animals. \nUses: Brute force. Fortitude challenges. Combat \nVicious: You have a powerful urge to destroy, coupled with the wiry strength \nof a predator. \nUses: Second or subsequent challenges. Dirty fighting \nNFC~ATIVE \nPHYSICAL \nFrail: You are fragile and easily broken. You always come out of a fight looking \nlike you got the worst of it - \neven if you didn’t. \nSlow: The opposite of the Quick and Nimble Traits. You lack muscular \ncoordination and are always a half-beat behind the rest. \nSoft: You lack the physical strength to carry out arduous tasks. \nSOCIAL \nCharisma-related: Intense, Threatening \nManipulation-related: Callous, Cruel, Manipulative \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCallous: You are not easily swayed by the views of others, nor do you care what \nthey think. \nUses: Defending against Presence powers. Testing to perform an inhumane \nact. \nCruel: With refined viciousness, you have the ability to precisely target the \nweaknesses of others. \nUses: Presence or intrigue. Challenges used to control or harm others. \nIntense: You have an unnerving presence that draws the attention of others. \nUses: Commanding the actions of others. Intimidation challenges.

Dread Guze challenges. \nNF~ATIVB \nSOCIAL \nEmpathetic: Able to identify and commune with the emotions of \nothers. In the Sabbat, the ability to feel strong emotions other than fear or \nhatred is disapproved and treated with scorn. Your “soft” ways earn you the \nridicule of others. \nKind: You still retain much of your Humanity, and for that, you are \ntreated harshly by the other members of the Sabbat. Your actions disgust \neveryone around you. \nMeek: It is difficult for you to make your presence known, and you are \noften overlooked for honors or advancement. Further, your mild nature makes \nit difficult for you to enter combats; you often hesitate before acting. \nMENTAL \nPerception-related: Analytical \nIntelligence-related: Focused \nWits-related: Insidious \nMiscellaneous Mental: Depraved, Inhumane \nAnalytical: You believe in a strict mental regimen that guides your thoughts. \nUses: Auspex challenges.

Performing any action that would be considered brutal or violent \nInsidious: You are a master liar and conniver; few suspect you, and your \nbetrayals are devastating. \n@ \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nUses: Infiltration.

Changing someone’s mind. \nNE~ATIVE \nMENTAL \nDeceitful: Occasional mistruths, minor adjustments to the facts and \nSqueamish: You have difficulty grasping the brutality of the world; \nUnstable: Your mind is constantly teetering on the edge, and anything \nmisleading others all seem like second nature to you. \neverything is dirty, foul or uncomfortable. \ncould upset the careful balancing act. \nSTEP THREE: \nADVANTA~FS \nNo character begins play completely out of the void. A character has \nskills and knowledges, perhaps the ones that landed her the Embrace or ones \nshe learned later. Furthermore, vampiric powers, called Disciplines, flow \nfrom the blood of all Cainites, granting them superhuman capabilities. \nCollectively, these Advantages are learned or developed benefits over and \nabove one’s raw potential. \nA Sabbat character may not choose Backgrounds (although these may be \npurchased with Free Traits and with experience) at this time, but does receive \nan additional basic Discipline level. \nCHOOSIN~ \nABILITIES \nSelect five Abilities that represent your character’s education and train- \ning. Whether learned in mortal days or honed after death, Abilities set your \ncharacter apart by letting her attempt tasks that less skilled compatriots cannot \nunderstand or complete. You can choose an Ability multiple times, if desired, \nto show greater expertise. Note that your Storyteller may restrict some \nAbilities. Sabbat-specific Abilities are listed on page 60. \nCHOOSIN~ \nDISCIPLINES \nSelect four Disciplines. You must select them in the order listed (that is, \nyou must take the first Basic level before taking the second Basic level in any \ngiven Discipline), and you can only take the Basic levels at this time. All four \nof these Disciplines must come from your clan’s Disciplines, but you may take \nmore than one level in any. If you are a Pander, you may simply choose any \nthree Basic Disciplines desired, but your Storyteller may restrict you to the \neight most common Disciplines - \nAnimalism, Auspex, Celerity, Dominate, \nFortitude, Obfuscate, Potence, Presence - \nunless you have an exceptional \nreason for learning a more specialized power. \nSTEP EOUR: LAST TOUCHES \nAt this stage, you should note your character’s total number of Blood Traits, \nWillpower Traits and Path Traits. Note that Paths of Enlightenment still use \nVirtue Traits, which come in three categories: Conscience / Conviction Traits, \nSelf-Control / Instinct Traits and Courage Traits. You get seven Traits to split \namong these categories. Each category must range from one to five total Traits. \nFor greater detail on each of these Trait categories, see Laws of the Night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMORALITYTRAITS \nWhile your Virtue Traits represent your ability to hold off against the \nBeast, your Morality Traits show how closely you adhere to your chosen code \nof ethics. A high rating in your Morality Traits indicates that you set high \nstandards for yourself, but you risk losing ground to the Beast even with \nrelatively trivial violations of your chosen morals. Low Morality Traits \nindicate that you are close to losing control to the Beast forever. \nYour starting Morality Trait total equals the average of your Conscience / \nConviction and Self-control / Instinct Traits, rounded up. During character \ncreation, you may choose to lose one Morality Trait in exchange for gaining \ntwo Free Traits. You may do so only once - \nlosing a Morality Trait counts as \ntaking two Negative Traits. Be wamed though, that doing so is a dangerous \ncourse; a low Morality Trait total practically guarantees disintegration into \nWassail, the final frenzy. \nNFC~ATIVE \nTRAITS, \nDERANC~EMENTS \nAND ELAWS \nSome characters have particular weaknesses or shortcomings. Others just \nnever developed in some fashion or suffered injuries that set back otherwise \nstrong attributes. Negative Traits represent these. Though Negative Traits are \nnot required, they can represent a deficiency or injury in your character. \nIn addition to Negative Traits, you can choose derangements for your \ncharacter. A derangement represents some sort of mental instability or neurotic \nbehavior. Taking a derangement counts as two Negative Traits and thus grants \nyou two Free Traits, but you may only take one derangement at character \ncreation (or one extra, in the case of Malkavians, who all start with one). \nRepresenting specific deficiencies or drawbacks aside from inherent weak- \nnesses common to many people, Flaws showcase particular problems. As with \nNegative Traits, Flaws grant additional Traits to the user. Each Flaw is rated in \nterms of its value, ranging from one to seven Traits. The higher the value, the \nmore debilitating the Flaw. A character may total up to seven Traits of Flaws. \nEREE TRAITS \nAND MERITS \nBecause no two Cainites are alike, each character gets five Free Traits. \nAdditional FreeTraitsare eamedfromNegativeTraits, Flawsorderangements \ntaken earlier, or by removing Morality Traits. One Negative Trait grants a \nsingle Free Trait. Aderangement or Morality Trait is worth two Free Traits and \nFlaws have variable values listed individually. For details on how to spend your \nFree Traits, see Laws of the Night. \nPurchasing Merits is one way to spend Free Traits. Merits represent special \nbonuses and capabilities beyond the norm. Each Merit is rated in terms of its \nTrait value. To take a Merit, you must expend Free Traits equal to the Merit’s \nvalue. You can take no more than seven Traits of Merits, total (though some \nolder vampires may have more). \nSTEP EIVF: SPARK \nOE LIEE \nYour character is more than a summation of Traits and adjectives. At this \nstage, take the concepts that you’ve emphasized and develop a story for your \ncharacter. Why did your character learn certain things? What circumstances \nt- \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmade her grow and change? Think about the sort of person that you’re playing \nand the motives of the individual. For more specific details, see the suggestions \ngiven in Laws of the Night. \nSONS \nAND DAUC~HTFRS \nOE CAINF \nSabbat characters have a few other particulars that must be addressed \nduring creation. What is her political leaning? What Path of Enlightenment \ndoes she follow? Is she involved in the sect’s spiritual side, or is she just this side \nof a rampaging monster? \nThere are two types of “people” that become members of the Sabbat: those \nwho were considered by their sires to be good additions to the sect and those \nwho survived mass Embrace by some fluke. When you start creating your \nSabbat character, take some time to decide what brought him to his sire’s \nattention. Did he happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, or was \nhe watched for several months or even years? Your character’s mortal life can \nbe a good place to begin the character creation process, even if a large part of \nit was purged during his Creation Rites - \nit may help you with determining \nif he was brought in with a purpose or as cannon fodder. \nThe process of Embrace is meant to winnow the weak from the strong. A \npotential member is Embraced, then “shoveled” (slammed on the back of the \nhead with a shovel and buried in a grave which she may have dug herself) and \nthen forced to dig herself out with her own hands. If she survives this test, she \nis considered a False Sabbat member. Traditionally, the period during which \na member of Sabbat is considered “False” is strewn with tests of strength and \nsavagery. These tests serve to drive out any humanity that the character retains \nas well as to teach her Sabbat values. Many False Sabbat do not survive this \ntime of testing, either destroyed for weakness or caught by an enemy. How did \nyour character survive her testing? Is she still False Sabbat, still proving herself? \nEven after becoming Proven, the new True Sabbat must carve a place for \nherself in the local hierarchy. The Sabbat’s pecking order is ruthless, and any \ncharacter unable to stand her ground will be crushed beneath the heel of those \nmore powerful or cunning. Did she have a position, only to lose it, or is she \nuninterested in the sect’s ladders of power? Did she suffer when someone else \nfell from grace? \np OLITICS \nThe political stance a member of the Sabbat takes is no less important \nthan her Path of Enlightenment or clan. Central to this political debate are the \ndual and opposing roles of the two main Sabbat ideals: freedom and loyalty to \nthe sect. The rest are just details. \nThe struggle over ideology continues to pull the Sabbat in different \ndirections and is perhaps their greatest internal enemy, affecting even how a \nparticular Sabbat views status, who she will take orders fromand even if she will \ntake orders at all. Thus, knowing what political faction your character belongs \nto can be as central as her Nature in determining how she reacts to a situation. \nLoyalists represent the far left wing within the Sabbat; in a way, they can \nbe thought of as the Sabbat’s “anarchs.” Loyalists believe that the only way to \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nbe loyal to the Sabbat is to follow the original principle of the Anarch \nMovement - \nthat all vampires must be free and ultimately responsible for \ntheir own actions. Orders, rules and regulations that restrict the freedom and \nresponsibility of the vampire must be removed. \nThe Moderates represent the vast middle ground of the Sabbat; roughly \nthree-quarters of the sect is divided between them and the Status Quo. Many \nantitribu belong to the Moderates. Many Moderates have contacts with all of \nthe factions and generally have the most flexibility. Neither far left nor far \nright, they believe in balance but tend to favor the side of freedom. \nThe Pander Movement represents what the Moderates could become if \nthey changed their focus from greater freedom to greater power. Not all \nPanders share this mindset, but other moderates from other clans tread very \nclose to their philosophy of convenience over ideals. The Panders focus on \ndoing whatever is necessary to gain as much power and authority within the \nSabbat; if it means supporting the Status Quo one week and allying with the \nLoyalists the next, they’ll do so to save their skin. \nThe Status Quo represents the system of leadership and authority that has \nkept the Sabbat together since the last destructive Sabbat civil war. The \ncurrent hierarchy of the Sabbat is a testament to the Status Quo as it is their \nvision made flesh. The Status Quo literally seeks to keep things the way that \nthey are and work within their current systems, believing that allowing \nmembers a looser rein will compromise the secrecy and security of the sect. \nThe Ultra-Conservatives represent the far right hand of the equation and \nare the smallest faction in the Sabbat. Leaders that are weak need to be culled, \nand Sabbat that break the Code or disobey critical orders need to be purged \nbefore the sect falls to the Antediluvians. \nJumping into political factions during character creation can be confus- \ning, particularly if you’ve never played in a Sabbat chronicle before. If this is \nthe case, consider playing a freshly minted Sabbat (newly Proven or False), and \nlet the game’s action guide your choice of politics. \nPATHS \nThe Sabbat has the reputation of being bloody and nonhuman, and that \nreputation is deserved. The majority of the vampires in the Sabbat do not follow \nthe ethics of the Camarilla, having long ago spumed Humanity in favor of their \nmore monstrous selves. The Paths of Enlightenment, like those presented in \nLaws of the Night, are alternate codes of morality, meant to help a vampire \ncontrol his Beast. While moral quandaries still face the vampires of the Sabbat, \nthey are of a different nature. Listed below is a list of the most common Paths in \nthe Sabbat; more detailed information on these paths can be found in Chapter \nFour. All Paths value Courage, but differ in other Virtues they prize. \nPATH \nOE CAINE \nVirtues: Conviction and Instinct \nComprised of ancient scholars and mystics, the Path of Caine seeks for the \nkeys to the enigma of vampiric existence, believing Caine to be the progenitor \nand paragon of all vampires. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPATH \nOE CATHARI \nVirtues: Conviction and Instinct \nCathari vampires believe in the old Albigensian heresy - \nthat the forces of \nLight and the forces of Darkness are at continual odds with each other, and in the \nend, only one will triumph. They consider themselves the servants of Darkness and \nspread wickedness, believing that they are aiding Darkness and testing Light. \nPATH \noe DEATH \nAND THE SOUL \nVirtues: Conviction and Self-Control \nThose on the Path of Death and the Soul are cold, emotionless beings that \ndevote their lives to the study of death and its consequences. To understand \nthe purpose of existence, they say, one must know what motivates and drives \nthe immortal soul. \nPATH \nO E  THE EERAL HEART \nVirtues: Conviction and Instinct \nTo hunt, to kill, to be the ultimate predator -these \nare the goals of those \nwho follow the Path of the Feral Heart. They believe that vampires are the \nultimate hunters, and that their purpose in unlife is to accept the predator that \nexists within their hearts. \nPATH \n01; HONORABLE \nACCORD \nVirtues: Conscience and Self-control \nThe Path of Honorable Accord was created to represent the ideals set \ndown in the Code of Milan and to give a voice to the laws that govern the \nSabbat. Its followers are expected to be hospitable to other Sabbat members \nand uphold leaders that work toward the goals of the Sabbat. \nPATH \nO E  POWER \nAND THE INNER \nVOICE \nVirtues: Conviction and Instinct \nThose on this Path see the exercise of power and control as the best reason \nfor Cainite unlife. They believe that Cainites have been set above mortals, and \nthey must accept their existence as superior beings. In doing so, they strive to \ncontrol their own souls through harsh discipline and ruthless strength. \nPATH \nO E  FVIL \nREVELATIONS \nVirtues: Conviction and Instinct \nSome vampires revel in their evil natures, but the Corruptors go one step \nfurther - \nthey actively sell themselves to the infernal forces and seek others \nfor sacrifice. Vampires are already damned, they reason - \none might as well \nbe on the winning side. \nPATH \nO E  LILITH \nVirtues: Conviction and Instinct \nThis Path is considered heretical by most Cainites of the Sabbat. These \nvampires follow the doctrines and dictates outlined by Lilith, the Dark Mother \nof Noddist teachings. The Bahari consider themselves children to a greater \npower, and they learn through surviving trial and pain. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nABILITIES \nThe Sabbat is an ever-changing arena of war and personal power. \nMembers are expected to be knowledgeable in a vast array of subjects, from the \nsect’s history and traditions to battle tactics against the Camarilla’s pawns. \nThese are the tricks of the trade, the hard-earned rewards of those who survive \nin the sect. Abilities aid the outcome of actions, give the character knowledge \nand an understanding of the world around her and describe how competent a \ncharacter is in her chosen fields. \nThe Abilities listed in the Laws of the Night are all applicable to the \nSabbat venue; those listed below are additional Sabbat-only Abilities. \nBlindfighting \nMany Sabbat games and Monomacy ritual fights require use of this \nAbility. Blindjightingmeans you are practiced at fightingwithout the aidof your \neyes. You’ve learned to use your instincts, hearing and innate hunter nature \ninstead of sight. You may use this Ability to retest in any Brawl challenge that \noccurs in the dark or while blindfolded. \nFire Dancing \nYou can enter a trancelike state that relieves you from Rotschreck and allows \nyou to leap bonfires and burning coals during Fire Dance rituals. You do not get \nnervous around fire if you take the time to sit apart and meditate for five minutes \nbefore encountering the flames closely. However, unless a fire is specifically built \nas a ritual bonfire, you still suffer the same Rotschreck as anyone else. \nFortune-telling \nTea leaves, Tarot cards, runes, I Ching sticks, a swinging pendulum or \nentrails - \nthese are the tools you call upon to read the future. Whether or not \nyou have the actual psychic chutzpah to do this is up to the Storyteller, but at \nthe very least, you can put on a good show and part the gullible from their \nmoney. Using Fortune-telling requires you to specify at least one divination \nmethod and may require Social Challenges to pull off a good performance. \nRituals \nYou know the rituals and ritae of the Sabbat and can perform them \nwhenever the occasion requires. This Ability is vital to being a pack priest: \nUnless the character performing the ria has this knowledge, the ritue will fail. \nThis Ability is not simply the knowledge of such rituals, but is a spiritual, \nalmost supernatural ability to perform them. This Ability is typically taught to \npack priests and other spiritual leaders, and a Sabbat who is not a priest but \npossesses such knowledge may come under scrutiny. \nTorture \nYou know how to inflict pain and are efficient at doing so. This Ability \nallows you to retest any Physical Challenge when you are in a torture situation \n- i.e., when you have already caused pain to your opponent and are \ncontinuing to inflict pain (not damage). Regular combat is not an appropriate \nuse of this Ability; this can be used for retesting when inflicting pain on your \nopponent either during an interrogation or when using Disciplines. \nVamp \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nYou can use your seductive means to get any information from anyone. \nYour advances could make a sailor blush, and you know how to tailor them to \nthe individual. Remember, however, that you will still need to spend blood in \norder to make yourself appear human to ordinary sight and touch. This Ability \ncan be used in appropriate Presence retests, as well as in unique interrogation \ncircumstances. Bear in mind that vampires on Paths of Enlightenment may not \nspend blood to make themselves appear more human, and many vampires find \nthe idea of such base acts to be no better than animals coupling (benefits aside). \nBACK~ROUNDS \nSabbat do not receive free Backgrounds at character creation and must \npurchase all Backgrounds. Examples and definitions of character Backgrounds can \nbe found in Laws of the Night, although they will have a slightly different slant \nin a Sabbat chronicle. Remember that Backgrounds like Allies, Contacts or \ninfluence mean interaction with mortals on some level, and most Sabbat consider \nmortals inferior - \ntolerated at best, or no better than food at worst. While it’s not \ninconceivable that a Sabbat vampire might somehow still have ties to the mortal \nworld, such ties are best kept hidden - \nafter all, who would want it known that \nhe actually needs mortals for anything? If you’re going to have them, give some \nthought to how you acquired these Backgrounds and how you keep them up. \nSTATUS \nSabbat status and dynamics are very different from those of the Camarilla. \nThe fundamental systems are different, as are the means and uses of Status \nwithin the Sabbat. Sabbat may use Status to force another sect member to back \ndown or bid it in a Social Challenge in place of a normal Social Trait. \nCharacters can ignore Status, but only at the price of not being able to use their \nStatus for the rest of the session. Status is accrued by actions, accomplishments \nor taking up positions within the sect that carry a certain amount of prestige. \nSee more on Status and its uses in Chapter Six. \nDFRAN~FMBNTS \nThe derangements listed here seem to be peculiar to the Sabbat; indeed, \nmany of the sect’s members suffer some form of instability, whether from the \ntrauma of the Embrace or some other event. A Malkavianantitrih may select her \ninitial derangement from this list or from the more “common” ones found in \nLaws of the Night. \nBerserk \nYou have tremendous difficulty controlling your anger and frustration. \nWhen confronted with stressful situations, you often lose control, lashing out \nat those unfortunate enough to cross your path, whether friend or foe. The \nbloodlust and violence of the Sabbat suits you well; indeed, the sect seems to \nbreed this kind of madness. You must win two Simple Tests to avoid frenzy. \nBlood Addict \nYou are addicted to the blood of your pack. It gives you a physical and \nemotional high that can’t be beat. For every period of six hours you go without \nconsuming pack vitae, you lose one Physical Trait until you get your fix. When \nyou wake, you are down one Physical Trait until you get pack blood. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBlood Sweats \nWhen you’re stressed, you get so nervous and agitated that your state of mind \naffects your body. Much like a mortal may become jumpy and break out in cold \nsweats, you become likewise ill at ease. The “sweat” in your case, however, is \nblood that works its way to your skin. This blood is very obvious in your sleeping \nenvirons, not to mention staining your clothes and making you adisturbing sight \nto vampires and mortals alike. Blood sweats cause you to begin play each night \nan additional point down in your Blood Pool. In addition, the blood is quite \nobvious (your clothes are stained not long after changing, and you “perspire” \ncontinuously), and you’re often nervous and twitchy. \nBlood Taste \nYou hate the taste of blood. Your body craves it, but you think it tastes \ndisgusting. You go out of your way to feed on drunks (the alcohol helps kill the \ntaste), even hanging out in mortal bars. The Vaulderie is torture; one person’s \nblood is bad enough by itself, but the blood of a whole pack let out to go stale in \nthe air like that is really vile. You must win or tie a Static Test each time you \nparticipate in the Vaulderie to see if you spit out the blood. If you fail the test, you \nmust bum a Willpower Trait if you wish to keep the noxious fluid in your mouth. \nCreation Memory \nHigh stress, especially violence, usually triggers plaguing memories of your \nCreation Rites. Whenever you see a Storyteller, hear a specific word or \nencounter acertain type ofevent, your thoughts will immediately return to the \ntime of your creation, and you feel a pressing need to share these memories with \nwhoever is around. Characters may play this derangement as anything from a \nnear-frenzy to the burning desire to tell anecdotes. You are down one Mental \nTrait whenever you lapse into these memories. \nGluttony \nGluttonous vampires have difficulty taking their sustenance in modera- \ntion. Why stop when one is merely sated? Why not drink in the heady vitae \nuntil there is no more?This derangement is particularly prevalent among elder \nvampires who have indulged their vices for so long that they lack the ability \nto control their hunger. Vampires suffering from this derangement must spend \na Willpower Trait when they wish to stop feeding. A gluttonous vampire \nautomatically frenzies when confronted with the sight, smell or taste of blood \nwhen hungry (blood pool is at 3 or less), and may be continuously “snacking”, \ndespite not needing more (such overeating may lead to many episodes of bloat, \nwhere an overfull vampire sheds blood tears and has pronounced ruddy skin). \nObsession \nYou are obsessed with someone in your pack. You have a permanent \nVinculum of 10 for her and can’t shake the desire to be constantly in her \nbusiness and affection. You try to suck up as much of her attention and blood \nas you can to prevent others from getting what you crave. \nPack Feeding \nYou believe you can no longer feed on mortals or vampires other than \nthose in your pack and become ill when vitae from other sources passes into \nyour system. Your Vinculum ratings are at two higher than whatever the results \nof the night’s Vaulderie. No one is sure if this is a psychological condition or \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\na physical addiction, but it is reality for you. This derangement makes diablerie \nalmost impossible, and it is up to the Storyteller whether or not you may spend \nWillpower Traits to attempt diablerie or feed from another source. \nParanoid of Ancients \nEveryone and everything that is not expressly Sabbat is a tool of the \nAntediluvians and dedicated to your personal destruction. All of your loyal \ncomrades are doomed along with you. You are suspicious and wary of anything \noutside the sect and will not infiltrate the Camarilla for fear of being \nsubliminally taken over by their ancient masters. You insist that those who \nhave made contact outside the sect be purified to be sure they have not been \novercome by the influences of the Ancients themselves. \nPassion Player \nWhile you strongly dislike and refuse to take part in torture, you believe that \nkilling is your divine duty. Camarillavampires avoid killing because they disrespect \ntheir Creator’s wishes. They hide behind the Masquerade even when they do kill, \nthough it is God’s will for them to reveal themselves as the angels ofdeath that they \nare. Each time you kill, you make sure your victim knows exactly what you are first. \nPhobia \nSomething in your past affected you deeply. It may be the sight of a shovel or \nthe feeling of cold water around your body, but you have an instinctual trigger that \ncauses you to frenzy. If this trigger affects you, you must test as if for Rotschreck. This \nPhobia frenzy, if entered, does not cause any lasting Negative Traits. \nRitual Freak \nThe more rituals your pack performs, the happier you are. You insist on \nVaulderie at least twice a night, once at rising and once before sleep. You \nencourage others to participate in rituals before every anticipated combat and \nafter every unanticipated one. You believe a Sabbat priest should bless \neveryone who ventures into the Camarilla’s realm, whether to fight, cause \ntrouble or infiltrate, and purify them upon each return. \nMERITS \nAND ELAWS \nPHYSICAL \nEarly Riser (1 Trait Merit) \nNo one can explain it, but you seem to have the ability to exist on less rest \nthan your fellow packmates do, tending to rise at least one hour before \neveryone else. You always seem to be the first to rise and the last to go to bed, \neven if you’ve been out until dawn. While your packmates may still be groggy, \nyou’re awake and aware. You may awaken early, or remain awake late, with no \nneed to expend Willpower during the first or last hour of light to stay awake. \nVulnerability to Silver (2 Trait Flaw) \nTo you, silver is as painful and as deadly as the rays of the sun. You suffer \naggravated wounds from any silver weapons (bullets, knives, etc) and the mere \ntouch of silver objects pains you. Further, you are one Trait down when in \ncontact with the metal. \nLazy (3 Trait Flaw) \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nYou avoid anything that requires effort on your part. For any actions that \nrequire preparation, there’s a good chance you didn’t properly prepare. You are \ndown one Trait for any spontaneous actions (including combat, unless it is part \nof a planned offensive). \nInfertile Vitae (5 Trait Flaw) \nDuring your Embrace, something went horribly wrong, causing your blood \nto mutate under the stress of dying and rising again. All those you try to \nEmbrace die. No matter what you do, you may not create any childer. You can \nstill use your blood in the Vaulderie or for any other vampiric need, including \nmaking ghouls. Blood Brothers may not take this Flaw. \nSOCIAL \nSanctity (2 Trait Merit) \nThis Merit is sometimes called the halo effect; everyone considers you \npure and innocent, though not necessarily naive. You have a saintlike quality \nthat is hard to pinpoint but cannot be denied. You are trusted, even if you are \nnot trustworthy. At the Storyteller’s discretion, you tend to receive lesser \npunishments for wrongdoing, and most Cainites and humans like you. You are \ntwo Traits up when initiating non-aggressive social challenges. \nSpecial Responsibility (1 Trait Flaw) \nShortly after your Embrace, you volunteered for some task in order to gain \nrespect and approval from your pack members. Now, you wish you had never \nopened your damn mouth! While no one gives you any special credit for \nperforming this duty, you would lose much respect from the pack if you were to stop. \nThe Storyteller should work out the nature and details of your duty in advance. \nIdeas can range from lending money to pack members to acting as pack messenger \nor possibly a constant responsibility to gather victims for Blood Feasts. You must \ndefine your duty before beginning play, and if you refuse to perform your duty at any \ntime, you are stripped of one Status per game session until you resume your duty. \nMENTAL \nIntrospection (1 Trait Merit) \nYou have keen insight into your own psyche, making you concretely aware \nof the motives of all your actions. You also have incredible insight into the \nunderlying motives behind the actions of others. You are two Traits up when \nattempting to use the Subterfuge Ability to discover the Negative Traits of \nsomeone with the same Nature or Demeanor as yours or when attempting to \nperceive that character’s aura. \nFlashbacks (6 Trait Flaw) \nYou managed to make it through the Creation Rites, but not wholly \nintact. The most insignificant thing can throw you into a different mood or \nstate of mind. Your behavior is extremely unpredictable. Because of your \nprecarious emotional state, your Willpower fluctuates. At the beginning of \neachsession, make a Simple Test with your Storyteller (no Traits risked). If you \nsucceed, you may participate in the night’s game as normal. If you fail, \nhowever, you may only spend a single Willpower during the session. You may \nstill use your total number of Willpower for Tests, but may only spend one \nWillpower Trait during the session. You may test again at the beginning of the \nnext night to see if you \ne \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n* \ni \nt \nPATHS \nOE FNLI~HTFNMFNT \nThe Sabbat view of the Cainite condition rejects all ties to humanity. \nVampires are dead, won’t ever be alive again and now exist in a realm of \nexperience wholly unlike anything mortals know. While this rejection opens \nup many possibilities for Sabbat vampires, it doesn’t free them from the basic \nfacts of their own nature. Each Sabbat vampire, just like each Camarilla and \nindependent vampire, must keep the Beast in check. Reveling in one’s \ncapabilities as a hunter is one thing; losing all capacity for thought forever, \ndoomed to feed mindlessly until someone destroys the brute that once was a \nvampire, is another. \nHarsh experience shows the Sabbat that vampires retain the need for \nsome code of ethics, principles to guide and limit their behavior. Many junior \nmembers of the Sabbat and a handful of elders continue to follow the Path of \nHumanity. They’re not very good at it, but it does keep them apace or two back \nfrom the brink of Wassail. A great many Sabbat neonates perish in a few \nmonths or years; Sabbat priests often refrain from teaching any Path at all until \ntheir new recruits show signs of surviving to become something more than \ncannon fodder. Some vampires take immediately to a Path with an instinctive \ndrive from the moment of their creation while others never feel the need to \ngive up Humanity altogether. \nProgress on any Path of Enlightenment takes deliberate effort. The Paths \nare supposed to be inhuman. Each one exalts an aspect of Cainite nature, \nhistory or alleged destiny instead of some aspect of human nature. No mortal \ninstinct or doctrine really prepares a vampire to follow a Path. By definition, \nfollowing a Path means not acting in a human or humane manner. \nThe Paths can make real trouble in a LARP. Storytellers must prepare to \nspend some time watching players and reining in self-indulgent acts of random \nviolence and disruption. It’s far more difficult to identify with characters well \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nadvanced on a Path than with characters of high Humanity. Specific parts \nof various Paths do connect to elements of human experience, but the overall \nsynthesis of each is unique and inhuman. Players and Storytellers who \ncooperate with each other in maintaining an awareness of what the Paths \nmean in practice and thinking about what the events of each scene imply for \nadherents of the various Paths get the reward of an engaging, rich, satisfying \ngame despite the reduced intuitive identification. \nAt the outset, Storytellers must make it clear that the Paths are not \nlicense to run wild. Indeed, the upper levels of each Path restrict a character’s \npower of choice far more than Humanity does. A vampire who commits to \na Path sets aside many emotions, desires and values to pursue a very limited \nset of goals. Paths that include Instinct as one of the Virtues require their \nadherents to enter frenzy, and merely make it possible to maintain limited \ncontrol in some turns. Vampires find, as they advance along their Paths, that \ntheir choices of goals, of friends and associates, and of every other aspect of \ntheir existence become highly focused. The Paths close doors of choice at \nevery step; characters and players alike should think carefully. \nTHE PATH \nO E  CAINF \nFollowers of the Path of Caine, or Noddists, focus on Caine as the \nfirst and perfect vampire. All deficiencies of the Cainite condition stem \nfrom vampires’ distance from Caine. A Noddist has two duties: to study \nevery available scrap of information about Caine and the nature of \nvampires (including the duty to uncover more information) and to apply \nthat knowledge to purging human limitations on the way to achieving \nvampiric completion. \nNoddists believe that academic study only takes them so far. It’s \ngood to read history, autobiographies and the like, but to really appre- \nciate another vampire’s experience requires more. Specifically, it requires \ndiablerie. A Noddist who drains the essence of another vampires gets the \nvictim’s whole essence and sees the world, briefly, through another’s \neyes, sharing another’s memories and thinking another’s thoughts. \nNoddists never undertake diablerie lightly. It’s a sacred moment on the \nstep to unity with Caine’s perfect state; it requires preparation before- \nhand and serious contemplation afterward. \nCainite occultists created the Path of Caine in the 16th century. \nIronically, they drew precisely the sort of inspiration from mortal \naffairs - \nin particular, the Enlightenment and its emphasis on reason \nanchored in historical study- \nthat their Path rejects. The Camarilla’s \nrelentless advocacy of Humanity as the only safe moral code rankled \nthe first Noddists. They had to acknowledge that most Paths force \nvampires into behavior that invites mortal reprisal but didn’t want to \naccept the Camarilla’s solution. Thus the Path of Caine includes its \nown version of the Masquerade while allowing (even encouraging) \nwhat the Camarilla abhors. \nA t  any given time, only a handful of vampires pursue the Path of \nCaine. It’s rigorous and scholarly. Vampires who focus on the (un)life of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthe mind seldom flourish in the Sabbat, and very few non-Sabbat \nvampires would accept some of the Path’s key tenets. Noddist scholar- \nship doesn’t always happen in cloistered laboratories: Noddists lead war \nparties, act as bishops and roam with wandering packs, all in the effort \nto understand Caine’s life as a warrior, leader and wanderer. Modern \nNoddists often say that the Final Nights are a time of active scholarship, \nwith passive book study waiting for calmer times to return. \nVampires on the Path of Caine practice Conviction and Instinct. \nTHE FTHICS \nOE THE PATH \nStudy Caine’s history and act as much like Caine as you can. \nThe Beast is one more part of your nature. Increase your will and instinct \nTake the vitae of unworthy vampires and study the insights their \nPurge whatever remains of your lost Humanity.

Make yourself worthy through wise action. \nin you now. \nwhat vampires can do so that you know what goals to set for yourself. \nEOLLOWIN~ \nTHE PATH \nNoddists tend to be better educated and more reserved than the \nvampires around them, although some Noddists lived without interest \nin scholarly matters and developed their love of learning after the \nEmbrace. They study Caine for practical reasons: They want to make the \nbest possible use of their condition. Theory only matters when it guides \naction, either suggesting a line of research or guiding the choice between \nalternative courses of action. Assamite antitribu often favor the Path of \nCaine as the equivalent of the Path of Blood without the cowardice. \nSerpents of the Light, Toreador antitribu and Ventrue antitribu make up \nmost of the rest of the Path’s followers. They often gravitate to positions \nof spiritual leadership. Their comrades in the Sabbat generally view \nthem as haughty and vain. \nNoddists stay out of most Sabbat politics. Power structures don’t \ninterest them - \nCaine was above all hierarchy, after all. As priests, \nNoddists make very even-handed instructors, seeing the potential for \nperfection in every vampire along with the need to begin with what- \never talents a vampire has right now. All Noddists like to share their \ninsights with others so that as many vampires as possible can achieve \nunity with Caine. \nThe research aspects of the Path of Caine encourage vampires to \ndevelop Occult and Lore Abilities of all kinds. Since the Path also \nencourages practical action, Noddists often study Survival, Melee and \nAthletics. Proselytizers find Expression, Subterfuge and Leadership useful. \nMost Noddists frown on the Disciplines that don’t appear in the \ncommon texts of the Book of Nod, preferring Disciplines that enhance \ninnate abilities: Auspex, Celerity, Fortitude, Potence and Presence. Some \nNoddists shun esoteric Disciplines like Thaumaturgy and Serpentis while \n+- \nI \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nothers study them as interesting sidelights that simply aren’t as important \nas the core Disciplines attributed to Caine himself. \nThe First Impulse \nSome vampires, fresh from a shovel party, crawl from their graves filled \nwith adetermination to be the perfect vampire, since vampires they must be. \nOther vampires, recruited more selectively, accept the Embrace for its \npromise of power. They want to have it all, everything the Cainite condition \nmakes possible. The Sabbat’s spiritual advisors recognize this drive for \nvampiric perfection as an indication that the new recruits might flourish on \nthe Path of Caine. \nTHE PATH \nOE CATHARI \nFollowers of the Path of Cathari, who call themselves Albigensians or \nGnostics, hold to a mystical tradition which identifies two Gods. The pure \nand good God of Light made everything spiritual while the corrupt and \nevil God of Darkness made everything material. The idea surfaced again \nand again among believers in Classical and medieval times: Zoroastrian- \nism and Manicheism made the two Gods equal while Gnostic groups \nwithin Judaism and Christianity declared the God of Darkness doomed to \nultimate destruction. In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Cathar heresy’s \nversion of this dualist view of the world displaced mainstream Christianity \nin southern France. The Albigensian Crusade marked its violent end - \nthe Bishop of Citeaux gave the famous advice “Kill them all; God will \nknow His own” to the soldiers who then slaughtered every suspected \nheretic. The idea surfaced in future centuries, but never as successfully as \nduring the Cathar era. \nSome desperate Cathars accepted local vampires’ offer of shelter or \nescape and were Embraced. As the truth of their new condition sank in, \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthose Cathars who didn’t give themselves up to the sun set about system- \natically defining their place in the world. Vampires are the perfect \ncreatures of Darkness, their spirit locked in flesh forever and their \nexistence confined to the hours when darkness rules. They therefore took \nup the burden of being the foremost servants of Darkness. They test the \nweaknesses of Light: Anything that they can destroy deserves to perish. \nSince former Cathars created the Path as an actual codified doctrine, it \nbears the name of Cathari. Older vampires who’d already developed \nsimilar views adopted the practice without necessarily endorsing the \nname, and even in the Final Nights, followers of the Path still argue about \nits most proper title. \nThe Path of Cathari directs adherents to engage in every form of vice \nand indulgence.. . but not capriciously. Cathari vampires fight on the \nfront lines of the cosmic war. They must tempt every child of the Light, \nthen destroy all who prove weak or uncommitted. Private sins don’t \nmatter to the Cathari, only the sins that lead others to fall. Some Cathari \nbelieve that in the last moment of history, the Light will prevail and \nthey’ll be destroyed like Darkness itself. They accept this and focus on \ndoing their duty in the meantime so that what remains in that final \nmoment will stand strong, tested and purified. Other Cathari believe the \noutcome of the cosmic war is in doubt and that if Darkness wins. it \ndeserves to. \nCathari do not kill anyone lightly. An imposed death interrupts the \nprocess of a soul’s collapse from within, unlike suicide, being shot while \nresisting arrest or any of the deaths that come from a falling mortal’s own \nactions. Cathari practice mastering frenzy to avoid strengthening the \nforces of Light with the ill-timed removal of a new recruit to Darkness. \nSometimes a follower of this Path decides, after calm reflection, that a \nmortal or Cainite must die to further the overall course of the war. The \nGnostic then kills deliberately and coolly, trying to derive as little \npleasure from the process as possible. Like the mortal dualists they once \nwere, the Cathari teach that souls reincarnate. They want to make sure \nthat people reincarnate badly rather than well, which means letting \ncorruption flourish fully. \nVampires on the Path of Cathari practice Conviction and Instinct. \nTHE \nFTHICS \nOP \nTHE PATH \nSin gloriously. Indulge every capacity of your senses, reveling in the \npotential of the material world. The world is corrupt, and it is yours to rule. \nLead others into temptation. Everyone who succumbs is your lawful \nPrey. \nEmbrace the most passionate mortals. Strengthen Darkness with the fire \nof conviction and desire. \nFate made you what you are. Accept your destiny - \nfulfill it, don’t try \nto flee it. \nUntil the final victory of Light or Darkness, all souls reincarnate. \nMortals return so you can kill them again and again. If you meet Final Death, \nyou’ll return as mortal yourself and may not earn your current status again. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nE O L L O W I N ~  \nTHE PATH \nCathari take satisfaction in their role as masters of the world. They \nmove freely and easily through mortal society. Nothing human beings do \nsurprises old Cathari: There are no new sins, only new applications of the \nsame failings. Cathari almost all agree that Darkness’ triumph grows \nnearer every night. \nThe Path of Cathari calls its practitioners to deal with others. Almost \nall Cathari emphasize Social Attributes and Abilities. Subterfuge and \nStreetwise let Cathari find their next victims and set up the targets’ falls. \nFinance and Bureaucracy help out when Cathari aim for the upper classes. \nA handful of scholarly Cathari - \nalmost all of whom either practiced the \npath’s various pre-Albigensian forms or are the childer of such old Cathari \n- \nstudy the historical and theological context of the Path and rely on \nAcademics and Occult. \nCathari favor the Disciplines that let them corrupt and control \nothers. Dominate and Presence are essential. Not many Cathari get the \nopportunity to learn Chimerstry, but those that do treasure it. Animalism’s \nability to interfere with sentient souls pleases the Cathari; only the most \nprofoundly dedicated followers of the Path worry about winning the souls \nof animals to Darkness. \nThe First Impulse \nSome people leave the living world gladly. Whether they expressed \ntheir loathing loudly (perhaps supported with firepower) or lived with \nquiet curses, they hated humanity and everything beneath the sun. People \nlike this accept vampirism, eager for the chance to separate themselves \nfrom the daylight world and bring it all down. They’re natural adherents \nof the Path of Cathari if they’ll accept training about how to transmute \nraw hatred into specific ethical precepts. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHE PATH \nO E  DEATH \nAND THE SOUL \nNecronomists - \nfollowers of the Path of Death and the Soul - \nstudy \nthat part of themselves (and others) which remains aware after vital \nprocesses stop. Vampiric unlife illuminates normal death and life because \nit is poised in between them, making clear the boundaries and contours \nthat normally remain hidden by simple death. After isolating the dis- \ntinctly mortal components of existence, Necronomists can then grasp the \ntrue form of spirit. \nNecronomists reject both the immortality of ghosts and the endless \nundead existence of vampires. They seek spiritual mastery, not mere \ndisengagement, and freedom from all mortal and vampiric limits. Every- \nthing in the universe begins with spirit - \nthe truly enlightened soul might \ninclude everything that is within its existence and rewrite the book of the \nworld to suit itself. \nAccording to Necronomists, the heart anchors the soul in its body. \nVampire hearts are so vulnerable precisely because vampires shed so much \nof the armor of mortal life. A vampire’s soul withdrew at Embrace from \nmost vital functions to concentrate itself in the heart. Small wonder that \na simple wooden stake can destroy such potent force. The Path of Death \nand the Soul encourages experimentation to overcome this limitation \nalong with all others. \nVampires on the Path of Death and the Soul practice Conviction and \nSelf-control. \nTHE \n€THICS OE THE PATH \nDeath releases the soul. Understand how and why this process works. \nEverything material reflects preexisting spiritual patterns. Discover \nthose patterns and learn how the world truly works. \nDo not fear Final Death. Like all others, your soul is immortal and will \nendure in some form you do not yet know. \nReason and emotion both express the soul’s underlying state beneath all \nexpression finite beings understand. Discover each soul’s unique composition \nby studying how it manifests in behavior. \nEverything contains a piece of the truth, however disguised. Pierce every \nveil of myth and ignorance. \nEOLLOWINC~ \nTHE PATH \nTzimisce scholars developed this Path in antiquity; it’s the oldest of \nthe common Sabbat Paths by at least a thousand years. It replaces \nconventional morality with a drive that contains both intellectual and \nemotional elements, guiding behavior without endorsing human as- \nsumptions. (After all, still-living beings can scarcely understand existence \nwithout life.) During the Inquisition and Enlightenment, the Path \npicked up accretions from new scientific and occult theories, undergo- \ning revision at the same time several other Paths got started. Most of its \npractitioners belong to the Sabbat, but not all. It appeals to a minority \nof studious vampires who reject all sect affiliation as mere distraction \nfrom the real great work of Cainites. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNecronomists seek to isolate soul manifestations by making them \npure and intense. Everything must be extreme: all-consuming rage, blind- \ning pain, overwhelming love and utterly dispassionate reason alike all \nilluminate the soul. Necronomists generally devote themselves to study- \ning a few manifestations at time, then moving on when they feel they’ve \nmastered that realm of existence. Outsiders regard Necronomists as \nobsessive even by Sabbat standards since a dedicated Necronomist gener- \nally loses interest in everything but her current topic. When concerned \nwith leadership, strategy and the like, Necronomists make excellent \nleaders. The rest of the time they exist on the fringes of Sabbat society; \nNecronomists currently studying pain often serve as torturers, but most \nNecronomist research simply doesn’t matter to the vampires around \nthem. \nUnless they’re experimenting on themselves to understand emo- \ntional states better, Necronomists present an icily rational and detached \ndemeanor. They know that passion clouds perception, and while they find \nothers’ confusion fascinating, they don’t want to confuse themselves. \nTzimisce (both of the main clan and the Old Clan) generally lead \nNecronomist groups. Most of their followers come from the ranks of \nMalkavian and Toreador antitribu, although the Path appeals to a handful \nof vampires in every clan. Harbingers of Skulls often pursue this Path in \nsolitary study. \nAlmost all followers of the Path of Death and Soul make Mental \nAttributes primary. They learn as much Occult, Academics, Medicine, \nInvestigation and related Abilities as their generational limits allow, \nforsaking other concerns except insofar as some personal mastery might \nhelp them understand research subjects better. \nNecromancy and Thaumturgy provide the Necronomist’s primary \ntools, while Auspex allows fuller data collection. Vicissitude allows \nNecronomists interested in matters of the physical heart to experiment \nwidely; other Necronomists can take it or leave it. Necronomists seldom \nengage in combat, so other vampires don’t grasp why followers of this Path \nlike Fortitude. Supernatural endurance, however, lets a Necronomist \nengage in long-term experiments no mortal (or even weak vampire) could \nmaintain, and since insight comes from the purity of extremes, \nNecronomists seek out Fortitude early in their studies. \nThe First Impulse \nSome people always found death more interesting in life. Life consists \nonly of what you see, after all; the great mysteries await beyond death. \nSeekers of insights into the ultimate mysteries often bring themselves to \nthe attention of Sabbat observers. If they survive the early shocks of \nactually being part of the world beyond death, the new recruits may find \nin the Path of Death and the Soul what they always sought, unawares. In \naddition, some people attract such attention for sheer unemotional \ndetachment from the world. Whether or not they had any interest in such \nmatters before death, some of these recruits take to the Path and its \nsupport for calm study. \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHE PATH \nOE FVIL REVELATIONS \nThe followers of the Path of Evil Revelations, who call themselves \nCorrupters and Slaves, teach that all vampires serve the greater powers \nof evil. Vampires are not their own masters, but agents of Hell itself. The \nvampire’s only choice is to acknowledge and serve his infernal creators \n- \nto resist is to face destruction. The Beast is the demon given to each \nvampire in the Embrace. In the end, when Hell triumphs and the \ninfernal lords stride through every realm of existence, vampires who \nobeyed their inner demons will reap rewards. The others ... won’t. \nNo Slave knows just how many demons exist, or whether, over time, \nnew demons emerge in some mysterious process of creation. Demons \ndon’t tell their servants such things. Each Slave learns his particular part \nin the grand schemes of Hell - \nthe specific vices he should promote and, \nin some cases, the virtues he should concentrate on undermining. The \ndemons set some vampires to traveling wherever the opportunity to \ncorrupt in a particular way may arise while other vampires must stay in \none area and corrupt it in a variety of ways. \nKeep in mind that Corrupters don’t make all this up. Spiritual \nbeings of great power and great evil do exist in the World of Darkness. \nInfernalism does allow material beings to contact demons, and a variety \nof rules systematize the process of cutting deals with demons. Demons \nnever tell the truth except when it makes a good weapon, so bystanders \nneed not assume that the Beast actually is a demon or that Hell’s triumph \nis inevitable. Vampire skeptics face enough surprises already when \ninfernal force presents itself to them. \nThe Sabbat and Camarilla hate the Path of Evil Revelations with \nequal fervor. Neither sect likes the idea of vampires binding themselves \nto demons or the destruction such creatures bring. Corrupters regard the \nsects as foolish and weak, obstacles for Hell’s willing servants to over- \ncome - by subversion and mastery if possible. The Path of Evil \nRevelations claims unique truth. Any moral code founded on rejection \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nof vampires’ status as demonic servants is wrong, pure and simple. \nAdherents to other Paths find the Corrupters laughably pretentious, \ndangerously insane or both. \nVampires on the Path of Evil Revelations practice Conviction and Instinct. \nTHE FTHICS \nO P  \nTHE PATH \nYou serve Hell. Demons reward their loyal servants and punish rebels \nand incompetents. \nPersuade other vampires of the truth. When they resist, corrupt them so \nthat they unwittingly serve demonic agendas anyway, then explain the rest of \nthe story. \nFight fiercely against all vampires who harbor desires to be good or \nhonorable. \nNever speak the truth except to gain something that dishonesty can’t \nget for you. Intrigue with other vampires and demons other than the one you \nserve; success justifies disobedience. \nThe Beast is your master and ally. Exploit it always. \nEOLLOWIN~ \nTHE PATH \nInfernalism in various forms is as old as the Curse of Caine. The \ncurrent form of the Path reflects, like most Sabbat Paths, the influence of \nmortal thinking during the Inquisition and Renaissance. The idea of Hell \nas a political state in a grand war with Heaven developed only after the \nnation-state appeared as the basis of mortal politics. Likewise, the notion \nof an autonomous evil - \nneither in rebellion against the good nor in \nultimately harmonious tension with it - shows the influence of an \nincreasingly secular philosophy. The dwindling of popular belief in \ndemons as personal entities pushed the Path into obscurity, and it \nremains an unpopular choice. \nThe Sabbat does its best to keep the Path unpopular. Sabbat Inquisi- \ntors hunt infernalists as diligently as any breathing Inquisitor ever did. \nUnfortunately for anti-infernalist officers, the sect’s fundamental lack of \nconcern over human mortal restraints makes Sabbat members easier \ntargets than the Humanity-obsessed ranks of the Camarilla. Infernalism \nflourishes most successfully in nomadic packs since it’s easier to maintain \nsecrecy over infernalist practices in the short term. \nThe escalating terror of the Final Nights makes infernalism more \npopular. Corrupters find ready recruits everywhere they go now that no \nlesser form of support seems likely to survive. When even Antediluvians \nfall, what hope waits for young vampires except the comforts of Hell? \nThe Inquisition works overtime without really making a dent in the new \nranks of infernalists. \nSlaves practice a variety of rituals. Different demons want different \nsorts of offerings: Some care a lot about ceremony, and others don’t. The \nmost important sacrifice is of the vampire’s self, his free will, place in the \ncommunity and morality. Everything else is secondary. Human sacrifice \nhelps bind the vampire to the demon, so demons encourage it. They also \nencourage other sacrifices and even demand the absence of sacrifices \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nwhen that might breed more fear of reprisals. Followers of the Path all \nengage in frenetic activity since Hell frowns on idleness and no demonic \nmaster ever guarantees unconditional support. \nCorrupters don’t create many childer: It’s just inviting competition \nfor demonic favors. Instead, they work through their own servants and \ndupes to get things done. Some turn back to mortal society while others \nspecialize in corrupting their fellow vampires. Mortal-oriented Corrupt- \n‘ers feed evils great and small. Every sin from petty theft to global \nterrorism can serve Hell’s agenda. As with the Corrupter himself, what \nmatters most in mortal pawns is that their souls turn to Hell. The actions \nthat follow just make the inner change visible. \nHell receives all willing lackeys, so there’s no particularly “typi- \ncal” Slave. To do their work well, followers of the Path must be social \ncreatures. A vampire who does not spread evil doesn’t matter to Hell, \nafter all. Hell demands obedience, and followers of the Path often \nfind themselves ordered to suddenly give up things they valued or \nenjoyed and replace them with new objects of desire. Anything that \nmight distract the vampire from his master’s concerns must go. Long- \ntime followers of the Path tend to become strange, disconnected, \nobsessed creatures. \nCorrupters who prepare themselves thoughtfully develop Occult, \nSubterfuge, Etiquette, Intimidation and Empathy. Those who actively fight \ntheir masters’ enemies also build up a range of combat Abilities. \nAuspex and Presence are the most popular Disciplines for followers \nof the Path. Many also study Dark Thaumaturgy, a particular form of \nThaumaturgy known only to their masters. Dementation became popular \nrecently as the Malkavian clan showed just how influential the Discipline \ncould be when used intelligently. \nThe First Impulse \nEvery generation of mortals includes some people willing to sell their \nsouls. The Sabbat generally doesn’t like such fools any more than the \nCamarilla does, but vampires already on the Path of Evil Revelations do \nrecruit among like-minded humans. Most often, however, people who \nnever really thought about serving demons in life respond to their first \nexperiences as vampires with a chain of logic that leads straight to Hell. \nIf they manage to avoid destruction at the hands of vampires who don’t \napprove of infernalism, these recruits gravitate toward packs focused on \nthe Path. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHE PATH \nOE THE EFRAL HEART \nThe followers of the Path of the Feral Heart, or Beasts, define themselves in \nterms of the Beast. As the ultimate predators, vampires stand outside all human \nsocial constraints. Civilization supports the weak - \nvampires aren’t weak and \ndon’t need the support. Vampires should hunt when hungry and rest when tired. \nThe Beast is only one part of the vampire’s nature, but it’s the most important \npart. The Beast tells the vampire when to act and when to remain calm. There’s \nnothing wrong with either state, only with doing something at the wrong time. \nThe Path doesn’t give any merit to stupidity. As sentient predators, \nvampires must use their intelligence as well as their instincts. Forethought \nsharpens the hunt, letting the vampire prey most efficiently. The Path rejects the \ntrappings of civilization, including technology. The Curse gives vampires \neverything they need. Relying on the tools invented by prey makes the predator \nthat much more dependent on prey, more like the prey, more prone to failure. \nVampires hunt and kill and should do just fine without any trappings. \nVampires on the Path of the Feral Heart practice Conviction and Instinct. \nSurvive. You can’t do anything if you don’t exist. \nStrike a balance with your Beast.

Civilization is bad because it weakens you. \nof action unfettered by terror. \nyourself and your packmates. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nEOLLOWINC~THE PATH \nThe Path of the Feral Heart has existed without much change for thousands \nof years. Gangrel pioneers created it, and it spread to other clans as they found \nthemselves facing defeat and exile. Nomadic Sabbat packs often practice it. \nFollowers of the Path feel no urge to create a formal organization: They \nshare insights and questions when they happen to encounter fellow adherents. \nA minority of Beasts serve the Sabbat as assassins and do very well indeed. The \nPath teaches vampires to kill carefully, in response to need, not caprice. \nBeasts don’t bother with fashion. If they wear clothes at all, they aim for \nfunctionality. Sturdy protective garb does the job. Nor do they bother with \ncamouflage - \nBeast Gangrel let their animal features show. Beasts do pay \nconstant attention to their environment. Bystanders notice them glancing \naround, smelling everything and listening for faint sounds. The Path pretty \nwell precludes involvement in politics; Beasts hold no high offices in the \nSabbat although some make good pack priests. \nCountry Gangrel outnumber all other followers of the Path. Some City \nGangrel who style themselves urban predators follow the Path, along with \nsmall numbers of Ravnos antitriibu, Nosferatu antitriibu and a few in each of the \nother clans. The Lasombra and Tzimisce almost never commit to it, since they \ntake civilization very seriously. \nPhysical or Mental Attributes come first for Beasts. Every Beast learns \nSurvival, Brawl, Dodge and Alertness. Many also study Animal Ken, and some \nbecome formidable at Empathy thanks to their ability to pick up clues about \nmental states others try to hide. Intimidation often follows naturally from the \nPath‘s emphasis on cooperation with the Beast. \nFollowers of this Path find Fortituck and Protean indispensable. Animalism \nis useful to learn from lesser predators and for feeding. Many Beasts develop \nAuspex, Obfuscate and Celerity as well, since all three enhance a vampire’s \nability to hunt. \nThe First Impulse \nSome people turn their backs on civilization in search of an imagined \nbetter existence in the wild. They may gather in small communes or may live \naltogether solitary lives, trying to purge themselves of the taints created by \ntechnology and population. Vampires on the Path of the Feral Heart love to \nrecruit these sorts of people, offering them the opportunity to exist with far \nfewer shackles than any mortal can hope for. In addition, some people who \nmoved happily through life turn to the wilderness after death to separate \nthemselves from their lost existence. The Path of the Feral Heart helps them \nmaintain internal discipline as they cut ties to sources of external discipline. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHE PATH \nOE HONORABLE \nACCORD \nThe followers of the Path of Honorable Accord call themselves Knights \nand focus on the society of vampires as a whole. The Curse makes vampires \npredators with a strong individualistic bias. Unrestrained, they’d destroy each \nother down to the very last Leech. Knights teach that honor - \nthe rigorous \nenforcement of standards of nobility in conduct - \nholds the society of \nvampires together. Honor strengthens a vampire’s ability to resist the Beast \nand provides the rules that allow vampires to coexist without having to fall \nback on the human morality they’ve abandoned. \nThe Path allows no room for mercy or sentiment. Honor is a matter of \ncalculated rational choice. Knights carefully analyze the meaning of the \ncommitments they make and the circumstances they face. Either they must act \na particular way to keep their commitments, or not. If not, they enjoy complete \nfreedom to decide how to act on any basis that suits them - \nraw self-interest \nusually dominates. Knights gradually lose track of notions like “friendship.” \nThey have allies andregular associates; trust plays no part in the Path. Nor does \nthe Path require making any particular commitments, with a few specific \nexceptions. What matters is how Knights keep their word, not which particu- \nlar promises they give. \nKnights make prominent and reliable Sabbat leaders. As long as their \nsuperiors administer oaths of office carefully, Knights serve with less treachery \nor complicated side issues than almost anyone else in the sect. If their oaths \nrequire them to fight, Knights fight courageously because cowardice would \nbetray the spirit of their commitment. If they swear to teach, Knights teach \nthoroughly and make sure their students learn. The problem comes when \nsuperiors offer oaths that don’t require the Knights to restrain personal \nambitions. Knights make great traitors, and rationalize their treachery as \nproviding negative examples of just how important careful definition is when \nhonor ties the society together. \nVampires on the Path of Honorable Accord practice Conscience and Self- \nControl. Keep in mind that this Path‘s version of Conscience does not include \nremorse, only concern for one’s integrity. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n4 \nI \nI \nTHE \nFTHICS \nOE THE PATH \nHonor every commitment you make. Your word defines who you are to \nNever fear, or at least never show it. Duty takes precedence over your \nShow respect to your superiors, loyalty to your equals and appropriate \nRepay your debts in full. \nSupport your comrades-at-arms in all endeavors except treachery. \nThe Path of Honorable Accord emerged from the medieval world, \ninspired by the same ideas that underlay the older Path of Chivalry without \naccepting human morality in any matter but honor itself. The decline of \nchivalry in mortal society also led to Honorable Accord losing ground to the \nPaths of the Renaissance era. The Sabbat civil wars brought Honorable \nAccord back to general attention. Knights committed themselves to the Code \nof Milan, becoming its first defenders. Many Knights identify themselves by an \noath as “followers of the Code.” \nThe Knights remained prominent throughout the sect schisms of the 19th \nand 20th centuries. They generally remained aloof from factional wars, \ndefining their duty to the sect as a whole. In particularly contested regions, \nKnight often brokered cease-fires between rival factions. As pack leaders, they \nallow more experimentation than followers of other Paths: Any action that \ndoesn’t jeopardize the commitments of pack members to each other and the \nsect is fine with adherents of the Path of Honorable Accord. \nKnights take a very visible part in ritae and ceremonies. Public reaffirma- \ntion of one’s oaths allows the Knights to shine as the really trustworthy, serious \nmembers of the group.. . and also provide good opportunities for humiliating \nor punishing the unreliable fools around them. Other Sabbat members find \nKnights useful but scary and sometimes downright ridiculous. Only vampires \nwith a suicidal urge actually laugh ut Knights, though. For their part, Knights \nsee everyone else as tools or obstacles. That includes mortal society as well as \nCainite; where mortals may advance a Knight’s oaths, she won’t hesitate to use \nthem, destroying them once the job is done. \nVentrue antitribu and Salubi antitribu dominate this Path. Nosferatu \nuntitrin‘bu, Tzimisce uninterested in radical personal transformation and lucid \nMalkavian untitribu also find the Path a good match for their concerns. More \nand more Panders adopt the Path as they find it a good route to respect from \nthe vampires around them. A handful of Camarilla elders - \nthose who can \nkeep their private lives well away from unsympathetic inquirers - \npractice the \nPath, making no effort to teach it, simply holding onto what they remember \nas their mortal ideals from 800 years ago. \nThe Path of Honorable Accord requires calm contemplation. A Knight \nmust never act rashly. She should first consider her obligations and then \nevaluate the consequences of the options available to her. Hasty Knights \neveryone else. \npersonal worries. \nconsideration to your lessers. \nEOLLOWIN~ \nTHE PATH \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nperish. Deliberate Knights also perish, but only when fightingon behalfoftheir \ncommitments and when no lesser sacrifice can do justice to the duty. \nMost Knights learn a wide range of combat Abilities along withkadership \nand Expression. Investigation, Luw and other research-related Abilities help \nKnights commit and act wisely. Knights who take office acquire relevant Lores. \nMore Knights learn Fortitude and Presence than any other Disciplines: \nFortitude for surviving the rigors ofduty, Presence for commanding proper respect. \nPotence helps indischargingmartial duties. Salubriantitriibuon the Path favor the \nmartial side of Valeran and sometimes teach it to their fellow Knights. \nThe First Impulse \nSome people want to be part of the winning team. They emerge from \nmortality with the knowledge that the Sabbat is the biggest winning team \nthere ever was: No corporate acumen or political clout can begin to compete \nwith the power of the blood. Having joined the winning team, they want to \nhelp it win. The Path of Honorable Accord gives structure to their desire. \nSome of these natural adherents were real winners in life, but some lost again \nand again and take their undead existence as a chance to forget all that and get \nit right this time. \nTHE PATH \nOE LILITH \nThe followers of the Path of Lilith, who sometimes call themselves \nBahari or Lilins, begin with a heretical view of Cainite history. According \nto the Lilins, the textual fragments that compose the Book of Lilith reveal \nthe true story of vampires’ origins. The tale begins not with Caine but with \nLilith, Adam’s first wife, whom he rejected because she claimed to be his \nequal. Exiled, she wandered the unfinished wilderness of the world. Out \nof her sufferings, greater than any we can imagine now, came a unique \nenlightenment. She built a garden of her own and taught herself to master \nthose gifts that God had hoarded for Himself. When Caine received God’s \ncurse, Lilith stood ready to take him, comfort him and train him. Caine \nhas never acknowledged the extent of his debt; most of his childer show \nthe same lack of gratitude. Nonetheless, Lilith’s heirs persist in seeking \ntrue wisdom for themselves and for the whole world. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe Lilins regard everyone, mortal and Cainite alike, as children \ntrapped in an immature understanding of the universe. Everyone ad- \nvances to a comfortable point and stops there, afraid of the challenges that \nlie ahead. Lilith taught Caine the way a parent must teach a rebellious \nchild, the way her heirs teach themselves and others: Through pain. Only \ndiscipline forces the child to pay attention and persevere, resisting the \ntemptations to turn aside. Adults deceive themselves into believing \nthey’ve learned the important lessons. They’re wrong. Compared to the \nvast scope of potential enlightenment, almost no one ever takes more \nthan one step along the hard road. The Path of Lilith pushes its adherents \nto go further. \nPain marks every step. The Lilins seek to challenge their own limits. \nFire walking, freezing themselves, impaling themselves on thorns and \nblades, starving themselves, feeding on poisoned blood, amputation - \neverything that shocks the body and mind might open a door of percep- \ntion. Flesh imprisons the soul even after life stops, and Cainite have to \nwork at least as hard as mortals to escape its limits. Outsiders see the Lilins \nas a bunch of masochists and sadists, but no outsider really understands the \npoint. Pain isn’t the end; it’s a means of forcing fresh thought. If other \nmeans served, the Lilins would use them. In fact, the Lilins do pursue \nesoteric study, meditation and the like, resorting to pain at the point the \nother means fail. \nWhile the Lilins don’t pursue pain gratuitously, the Path allows no \nroom for compassion in any ordinary sense. Enlightenment must come, \nwhatever the cost. Let those who wish to remain ignorant remove \nthemselves from the Lilins. Above all, Lilins drive themselves and each \nother, but they won’t let others remain ignorant. Everyone needs to \nawaken to their full potential. The Final Nights give the Lilins an extra \nsense of urgency since they see absolutely no hope except the attainment \nof the heights Lilith reached long ago. If the Antediluvians rise and face \nonly an ignorant horde, the world will not last. Pain must save the world. \nSome individuals find themselves suddenly hearing a quiet song \nbeneath all other sounds. The Hierophants - \nthe priests and priestesses \nof the Path - \ncall this the ahi hay Lilitu and diligently seek out its \nhearers. The song marks one’s readiness to join the ranks.. . regardless of \nhow the listener feels about it now. \nVampires on the Path of Lilith practice Conviction and Instinct. \nAccept every pain. There is no enlightenment without it. \nFreely give pain to seekers; freely receive pain from seekers. You do not \nPractice what you learn. The world depends on practice, not theory. \nPlant a garden that shows the power of your mastery over creation. \nSeek out those who, unknown to themselves, are now ready to join you. \nTHE \nFTHICS \nOP THE PATH \nfollow this Path alone. \nGather with your brothers and sisters to share your progress. \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nEOLLOWIN~ \nTHE PATH \nThe Path of Lilith is older than recorded Cainite history. Conflicting \nlegends attribute its formalization to various Methuselahs; most stories agree \nthat the key manuscripts came to light in Africa, but no details can be \nconfirmed now. The ranks of Lilins have always been small - \nthey rise in times \nof great crisis, then shrink again as the uncommitted fall away. (A few very \nclever outside observers look for rising numbers of Lilins as a clue that trouble \nbrews somewhere.) The Path prescribes no specificrituals, so every community \nof Lilins develops complex ceremonies of their own. \nThe Camarilla ruthlessly persecutes the Lilins; their very presence raises \nunwanted questions about just how dead and buried the past is. The Sabbat \ndoesn’t support the Path’s teachings but allows Lilins to remain as long as \nthey serve the sect. This policy of tolerance may change as the Path grows \nmore popular. \nLilins trade the knowledge they’ve won. They maintain loose networks of \noccult-minded individuals - \nnot just vampires, but mortals, magicians and \neven ghosts sometimes prove useful. The Sabbat does frown on these ex- \nchanges, and Lilins who share too much risk harsh punishment. The Lilins \noften develop their own versions of rim, with much more pain involved. It’s \nimpossible to catalog fully the range of Bahari practices because they never \nfully discard anything that once proved useful. Enlightenment could strike \ntwice in the same way, after all. \nLilins alternate periods of frenzied activity, when they search endlessly \nfor the next change and the next learning experience, with periods of quiet \nwithdrawal, when they turn inward and try to collate what they’ve learned \nso far. The Path finds some adherents in every social class and group, and \noffers no barrier based on wealth (or its absence), gender or any other \nexternal marker. By the time they’re done, Lilins generally retain few if any \nclues as to their original condition. Sustained torture bums away the features \na vampire began with while deep insights change the vampire’s demeanor. \nMany Lilins, though not all, favor elaborate vestments and props for their \nrituals, and this attention to ceremonial detail is one of the few traits the \nLilins have in common. \nNo clan dominates the Path of Lilith, within the Sabbat or outside it. \nSabbat followers include Tzimisce and Lasombra and unticn’bu from the \nMalkavian, Nosferatu and Toreador clans. A few Kiasyd practice it, as do \nHarbingers of Skulls who refer to their unseen high priestess Lamia. As noted \nabove, some version of the Path also finds mortal and ghostly practitioners. \nMore women follow it than men, and women seem to fare better on it, but the \nPath does not exclude men. Individuals make their own way toward the goal \nof completeness, and followers encourage each other even when their specific \nsteps diverge greatly. The Path promotes areal, if peculiar, sense of community \namong people who share only the drive to break through all restraints that keep \nthem finite and static. \nTorture and Occult form the foundation of the Bahari standard set of \nAbilities. Many things can supplement them; Lores, academic and scientific \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAbilities, Investigation and Medicine are all popular. Linguistics comes in handy \nwhen Lilins try to trace the work of their predecessors. \nThe Path‘s core teachings state that Lilith developed Disciplines within \nherself in response to the pain of evil. Her disciples emulate her with special \nattention to Animalism, Cekrity, Fortitude and Obfuscate. Vicissitude provides \npain without external tools, and packs of Lilins try to include someone who \nknows it. The handful of Ravnos who follow the Path enjoy tremendous \npopularity as Horrid Reality makes a wonderful teaching tool. \nThe First Impulse \nThe truth hurts, some people believe. Becoming undead hurt a lot; even \na physically painless Embrace does involve dying and the trauma that goes with \nit, and the Sabbat seldom Embraces with regard for the personal comfort of \nrecruits. Having begun their new existence in pain, they continue to seek \nfurther truths in pain. Some of these recruits were masochists or sadists in life, \nothers dealt with pain no more intimately than the picking of a scab. The Path \nof Lilith draws more followers from those who never cared about pain in life \nthan from those who already have experience trying to open their spiritual eyes \nthrough material suffering. \nTHF \nPATH OE P O W F R A N D  THF INNFRVOICF \nThe followers of the Path of Power and the Inner Voice, called Unifiers, \ntake the rejection of their lost humanity to its extreme. They discard all desire \nfor community, all interest in philosophical and theological matters, all \nintellectual and abstract pursuits in favor of one single goal: Power. Vampires, \nthey say, exist to rule, and they shall set the example. Some night they’ll rule \nthe world. In the meantime, they rule as much as they can. \nUnifiers focus on the tangible world around them. If they ever had a soul, \nit’s gone along with their breath. Human beings and their petty desires don’t \nmatter since they all die. Purely personal satisfactions don’t matter, either. \nWhat counts is the society of vampires, and the role Unifiers play in it. The \nability to give orders and watch others obey them matters. Unifiers aim to \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncommand everything around them- political, economic, social and spiritual \nauthority should all be theirs. \nThe Path of Power and the Inner Voice requires Unifiers to understand \neveryone. Would-be rulers must know why people obey, what drives them to \nrebel and how different forms of power work. Every aspect of human and \nvampiric nature comes into play, from the foundations of biology and occult \nhistory to psychology. Unifiers study both the surface mind and the subcon- \nscious, as well as the body they exist in. Particularly diligent followers of the \nPath zealously pursue competing theories of vampiric origins and develop- \nment in hopes of creating the Cainite counterpart to human medical lore. \nStupid power-seekers try to apply bigger sticks when obvious brute-force \nsolutions fail. Usurpers know that command sometimes works secretly, and \nthat very complex forces interact with each other each time subjects obey or \nreject an order. \nUnifiers enjoy a great deal of respect, and even more fear, from other \nSabbat members. Every successful follower of this Path shows herself both \nwilling and able to use every means at her disposal to increase her power. As \nfollowers, Unifiers seek constantly to displace their superiors. As leaders, \nUnifiers tolerate no failure or dissent. Wherever a significant number of \nUnifiers gather, most of them soon end up either fleeing or dead. The abolition \nof mercy and compassion applies to one’s fellow followers of the Path just as \nmuch as to anyone else. \nNovices on the Path tend to practice overt forms of rulership, with fear \nand punishment as their tools. More sophisticated Unifiers realize that the \nbest control is that which rules out the possibility of rebellion. Willing \nservants do things slaves and prisoners don’t. An effective Unifier corrupts \nhis followers until they can conceive of no existence without him. Offer \nthem the satisfaction of all their desires and develop desires that only you can \nsatisfy, and they’re yours. \nVampires on the Path of Power and the Inner Voice practice Conviction \nand Instinct. \nTHE \nBTHICS \nOP THE PATH \nSuccess justifies everything. Pursue mastery at all costs. \nBe sparing in rewards. Don’t let subordinates count too strongly on your \nShow respect to leaders who deserve it; replace those who don’t. \nNever show weakness for fear. Appear stronger than you are and grow \nUse every tool at your disposal. \nfavor. \ninto your image. \nEOLLOWIN~ \nTHE PATH \nNobody knows for sure just how this Path developed. The most common \nstory attributes it to Lord Marcus of the Lasombra in the early 16th century. It \ncertainly originated or took its current form in the Renaissance, but may have \nroots running back further. Unifiers gave prominent early support to the \nSabbat; those who survive continue to lead it in the Final Nights. Unifiers \nchoose their childer more carefully than many Sabbat members and are \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nresponsible for many mysterious disappearances of tyrants, politicians, prison \ncamp directors and the like. In recent years the Path has gained many more \nadherents. The prospect of ever-escalating warfare inspires low-ranking Sabbat \nmembers to try to move up in the ranks so that they can give orders rather than \ntake them. \nUnifiers practice no Path-specific rituals and don’t like to spend time \naround each other except when necessary. They do enthusiastically take part \nin war parties and hunts. Every opportunity to show mastery, like the Fire \nDance, gives Unifiers the chance to humiliate others in public. A humble \nfollower of this Path would be a contradiction in terms. Whatever the social \nbackground of a particular Unifier, confidence to the point of megalomania \nnow drives her actions. \nSome Unifiers develop extensive combat mastery; others don’t. All \nUnifiers build Abilities such as Leadership, Intimidation, Politics and Subterfuge. \nEmpathy and Meditation assist careful planners. \nDominate and Presence are the favorite Disciplines for followers of this \nPath. Everything else has its uses, and the Unifiers don’t spurn any Disciplines \nas irrelevant. \nThe First Impulse \nSome people want to rule the world and want to rule it without having to \nshare it with others. Becoming a vampire shows them how much they didn’t \nknow about the real nature of power in the world. That’s a learning experience. \nNow that they know about the night’s society, they want to master it. If they \nmanage to avoid destruction for excessive insubordination, recruits of this sort \ntake readily to the Path of Power and the Inner Voice -at least, they do if they \ncan refrain from arguing too much with their teachers. As with the Path of \nHonorable Accord, some adherents were winners and rulers in life, others just \nthe opposite. The impulse to rule doesn’t always go with prior success in \nexercising it. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBetween the Lasombra and Tzimisce, the various antitribu and a handful \nof minor bloodlines, the vampires of the Sabbatpractice most of the commonly \nknown Disciplines (Animalism, Auspex, Celerity, Dominate, Fortitude, Obfus- \ncate, Potence and Presence). Specific lines also know certain proprietary \nDisciplines that appear in Laws of the Night (Chimermy, Dementation, \nObtenebration, Protean, Quietus, Serpentis and Vicissitude). However, this is \nhardly the full extent of the powers that various Sabbat members boast. Several \nSabbat bloodlines claim their own secret permutations of Caine’s curse, and \nelder Lasombra, Tzimisce and Malkavian antitribu wield aspects of their \nrespective Disciplines that are unmatched by those of any Camarilla vampire. \nThe late, unlamented Tremere antitribu did add a handful of Thaumaturgy \npaths and rituals to the sect’s arsenal, and these are still in the hands and \ngrimoires of other blood magicians. The sect’s few necromancers boast their \nown rites, and the mysterious Harbingers of Skulls have demonstrated their \nown mastery of the boundaries of life and death through the art known as the \nMortuus Path. \nThough many outside the Sabbat regard the sect’s unique powers as the \nfoulest arts of the undead, the Sabbat itself is all too aware of abilities that are \neven more blasphemous. Since its inception, traitorous infernalists have \nplagued the sect, vampires who would give over their very souls to demons for \nthe promise of temporal power. Many times, this power comes in the form of \nlessons in blood magic, and the Sabbat knows these arts as Dark Thaumaturgy. \nDARK \nTHAUMATURC~Y \nThough the Sabbat endorses many paths to power, dealing with demons is \none that the sect has never approved of. Servitude to an infernal master, to the \nSabbat’s way of thinking, is no better than servitude to the Antediluvians -in \nsome ways worse, as it places the Cainite under an influence that Caine himself \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nnever accepted. Nevertheless, individual Sabbat vampires do seek out the quick \nroad to personal power that demons provide. One of the most common forms of \npower that demons grant to vampires is a unique form of blood magic, and such \npaths and rituals are collectively known as Dark Thaumaturgy. Most Cainites \nrefer to practitioners of this Discipline as infemalists. \nWere a scholar of blood magic to compare the fundamental practices of \nThaumaturgy to Dark Thaumaturgy, she would find few differences. Both are \nforms of magic that rely on the strength of Caine’s Curse and the individual \npractitioner’s vitae to power their effects. The primary differences lie in the \nphilosophy behind the two Disciplines and the source of the requisite knowl- \nedge. Much like a history lesson from a devout neo-Nazi is inescapably colored \nby his perceptions, a blood magic lesson from a demon bears the biases of the \ninfernal perspective on magical workings. With time, this taint affects the \nvampire’s perceptions, his worldview, his physical form and even his very soul \n(which, by this point, he merely holds in trust for his demonic master). \nThe Sabbat loathes infernalists because their ultimate loyalty is not to the \nsect. Rather, it is to the demon with whom they made their pact for power. \nThough an infernalist’s night-to-night actions may be in accordance with the \nSabbat’s goals, his master may call upon him at any moment to act on the \ndemon’s own agenda, regardless of how it conflicts with the actions and views \nof those around him. To an organization whose very existence is based on the \nprinciple of mutual loyalty, such betrayal is anathema. The recently expanded \nSabbat Inquisition exists for the sole purpose ofrooting out and destroying such \ntraitors, and it is very, very good at this job. \nLearning individual paths and rituals of Dark Thaumaturgy follows the same \nlimitations as for Thumaturgy, including the declaration of a primary path. \nHowever, the learning process is marginally easier, thanks to demonic tutelage. All \nDark Thuumamrgy paths cost two Experience Traits for Basic powers, five for \nIntermediate ones, and eight for Advanced ones. All Basic rituals cost two \nExperience Traits, Intermediate rituals cost three and Advanced Rituals cost five. \nNote that Thaumaturgy and Dark Thaumaturgy are incompatible for the purposes \nof sharing rituals and primary path levels - \na character with an Advanced rating \nin his primary Dark Thauwrgy path but only an Intermediate one in his primary \npath of Thaumaturgy cannot learn Advanced Thuwrgy rituals. \nPlayers may not take this as one of their Disciplines at character creation. \nEven if you have every intention of coming into the chronicle as an infernalist \n(and where is your Storyteller if you are?), you must still make the bargain to \nstart acquiring Dark Thaumaturgy. Furthermore, you may not learn simply by \nspending a couple of Experience Traits and calling it a fait accompli - \nyour \ncharacter must petition his dark master each and every time he wishes to \nadvance on his path or learn aritual. Doing so otherwise is to trivialize the dark \npact and the fact that an infernalist is at the beck and call of a demon. \nDARK \nTHAUMATUR~ICAL \nPATHS \nMechanically, Dark Thaumaturgy functions in the same manner as does \nThaumaturgy (Laws of the Night, p. 176). To use one of the powers of an \nindividual path, spend a Blood Trait and make any additional challenges or \nexpenditures that the individual path calls for. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHE \nPIRFS OE THE INPFRNO \nWith this path, you learn mastery over the very fires of Hell (or so you’re \ntold). Unlike a practitioner of The Lure ofFlames, who spontaneously generates \nfire, you summon this sickly green flame by opening a tiny one-way portal to \nHell. This path is extremely unsubtle and impossible to hide, but its eldritch \nflames are as impressive in effect as they are fearsome in appearance. \nFire from this path is supernatural in origin, and protection from mundane \nflames does not help its victims. Unless a power specifically protects against \nSupernatural aggravated damage (such as Fortitude), it provides no special \nbenefits when resisting Fires ofthe Inferno. Body armor does not absorb damage \nfrom this path, which instead goes straight to the target. These flames may, \nhowever, be extinguished in the same manner as any other fire (with holy \nwater having more than normal effect, at Storyteller discretion). Fires of the \nInferno uses the Occult Ability for retests. All powers of this path have a \nmaximum range of the character’s line of sight. \nBASIC SIRES \nOE THE INPERNO \nFlash Blind \nYou may cause a brief flash of intensely bright flame to appear in front of \na target’s eyes. Though this power functions more as a distraction than an \nattack, it briefly disorients its victim, during which time you may launch an \nadditional attack or take advantage of the confusion to escape. \nTo Flash Blind a target, make a Mental Challenge against her. If you win, \nshe is dazzled and disoriented by the eruption offire and automatically loses all \nties until the end of the next turn. If she was using Heightened Senses to enhance \nher vision, the sensory overload blinds her for one hour (see the Flaw Blind, p. \n116 of Laws of the Night). \nFlame Lance \nThis power allows you to shoot a pencil-thin stream of intense fire. This \nappears as a perfectly straight line of bright green flame reaching from you to \nyour target. Many practitioners of Flame Lance invoke this power by pointing \nat their intended target and twisting their wrists, defining the portal through \nwhich the flame erupts with the circle that their fingertip describes in the air. \nTo strike someone with Flame Lance, make a Mental Challenge that the \ntarget resists with her Physical Traits, If you win, she suffers one level of \naggravated damage. You may use Flame Lance to ignite flammable inanimate \ntargets, though it will not set flame to anything that your target is wearing. \nINTERMEDIATE \nEIRES OE THE INEERNO \nRing of Fire \nWhen you use this power, a foot-thick circle of flame erupts in a 10’ radius \naround you. Smoldering lines appear on the ground inside this circle, inscrib- \ning a pentagram with you at its center. This fire reaches your own height, \nforming a wall of dancing flame through which any potential assailant must \nleap in order to reach you. The fire stays in place regardless of where you move, \nthough you have no special immunity to it if you attempt to pass through it. \nSpend a Willpower Trait to ignite a Ring of Fire. The circle erupts instantly, \nand anyone who is standing on its perimeter must win a Static Physical \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nChallenge against five Traits or suffer one level of aggravated damage. Befort \nmaking this challenge, he has the option to declare whether he will move to tht \noutside or inside of the ring after the test is resolved (we assume that no one wil \nwant to remain standing directly on the ring’s perimeter, though particularll \nbrave or stupid individuals may do so by expending a Willpower Trait). The Rini \nof Fire remains in place for the rest of the scene or until you are knockec \nunconscious, move out of line of sight of it or decide to release it. \nAnyone who attempts to pass through the Ring of Fire must win a Couragt \nVirtue Test against three Traits in order to summon the will to do so and take: \none level of aggravated damage if he does step through it. You are not immunc \nto damage from the fire, though you suffer no fear of it and may pass througl \nit without the Courage Virtue Test. \nIncinerate \nYou may inflict the very wrath of Hell upon an enemy. With a gesture an( \naglance, you create a three-foot wide circle under a target from which acolum1 \nof flame erupts to consume her. This fire reaches the ceiling if you are indoors \nand reaches 30 feet into the air outdoors. \nTo Incinerate your target, issue a Mental Challenge that she resists with he \nPhysical Traits. If you win, she is unable to dodge before the ground under he \nerupts in fire. The initial blast does two levels of aggravated damage to her an( \nanyone in contact with her. Your primary target is also on fire and takes onc \nadditional aggravated health level every turn until she extinguishes the blazi \nor perishes. A victim of this attack may use Dodge for a retest. \nADVANCED \nEIRES OE THE INEERNO \nFurnaces of Hell \nYour mastery of hellfire has surpassed mere point-targeting. With thi \npower, you may engulf multiple opponents in simultaneous eruptions of fire \nThis power’s effects resemble those of Incinerate, but the fires summoned wit1 \nF u m e s  of Hell are much more intense. \nTo throw open the doors of the F u m e s  of Hell, spend a Willpower Trai \nand make a mass challenge against all your intended targets (you may affect a \nmany targets as you have permanent Willpower), testing your Mental Trait \nagainst their Physical Traits. Anyone you beat in this challenge is subject ti \nthe effects of Incinerate, but the initial injury to each primary target is thre \nlevels of aggravated damage. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHE PATH \nOP PHOBOS \nThis path is subtle in most of its manifestations, and its effects are usually \ndifficult to recognize as blood magic in action. This is because the Path ofphobos, \nrather than creating horrifying images or inducing artificial emotions, releases \nand magnifies fears that were already lurking within its victims’ minds. While \nthis path is not an overtly powerful one, many cunning infernalists prefer it as \nthey can use its effects as a source of social and psychological leverage. It is all the \nmore powerful because its illusions exist entirely within the victim’s mind, and \nthus Auspex cannot penetrate them as it can the specters of Chimstry. The Path \nof Phobos uses the Intimidation Ability for retests. All powers of this path require \nyou to be within line of sight of your victim to apply them though some effects \nmay persist after activation regardless of where your victim is. \nThe Paeh of Phobos is not without its drawbacks. Continued use of it often \nresults in the infernalist sharing her victims’ unearthed fears. You may use Path \nof Phobos twice per night without any danger. However, on the third and every \nsubsequent use of a power from this Path, you must succeed in a Static Mental \nChallenge against a number of Traits equal to the number of times that night you \nhave used the path. If you fail, you are afflicted with the Flaw Nightmares (Laws \nof the Night, p. 117) for the next week and you lose an additional Blood Trait \nfor every night that this lasts. If you fail three such tests in the same night, you \npermanently gain the Flaw Phobia (Laws of the Night, p. 117). The Storyteller \ndetermines the object of this phobia; it should be related to the fears of one or \nmore of the victims on whom you have used Path of Phobos during that night. \nBASIC PATH \nOE PHOBOS \nInduce Fear \nYou can induce a mild paranoia in your victim. She feels as if she is being \nwatched constantly. Menacing figures hover at the edges of her vision, never \ncoming fully into view. \nMake a Static Mental Challenge against your subject’s permanent Mental \nTraits to Induce Fear in your victim. If you succeed, she is affected for the \nremainder of the scene. While under the effects of Induce Fear, she must make \na Courage Virtue Test against two Traits to take any action that exposes her \nto her unseen stalkers. She is also down one Trait on all tests she makes in \ncombat due to the distraction imposed by “having to watch her back.” \nSpook \nThe implicit terrors of Induce Fear become explicit with Spook. Your victim \nexperiences minor hallucinations that portray an imminent attack that he will \nbe powerless to resist. A police officer might see the flash of a gun barrel from the \nwindow of a burned-out apartment building while a Gangrel elder might hear the \nheavy footfalls of Lupines in war-form just around the comer. Whatever form \nthese sensations take, they add up to the overburdening impression that your \nvictim must flee at once lest he fall prey to whatever menaces him. \nIssue a Mental Challenge. If you win, your target must leave the area \nimmediately. Additionally, a Cainite victim of this power must win a Courage \nVirtue Test against three Traits or enter Rotschreck. The compulsion to avoid \nthe area lasts for one hour; the frenzy subsides in five minutes. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nINTERMEDIATE \nPATH \nOE PHOBOS \nTerrorize \nYou can now summon illusions of your victim’s worst fears that, to her, are \nindistinguishable from reality. No one else can perceive them, but they are \nimmediate threats to her, and so omnipresent that they all but paralyze her. If \nshe is afraid of heights, the floor seems to fall away from her; if she fears snakes, \na hundred cobras slither into the room and surround her. You are not \nautomatically aware of what fear you have unearthed with this power though \nyou may be able to infer it from your victim’s reactions by winning a Social \nChallenge (retest with Empathy or Subterfuge). \nTo Terrorize your victim, bid a number of Mental Traits equal to her \nnumber of Courage Traits and defeat her in a Mental Challenge. If she loses, \nshe must either succeed in a Courage Virtue Test against a four-Trait difficulty \nor spend a Mental Trait to take any action except cowering in fear. Teworize \nlasts for the rest of the scene. \nFear-Plague \nThrough this power, you may draw your subject’s deepest fears out of his mind, \nexamine them and hurl them back at him. They then haunt him at every turn, \nstalking his mind and denying him any sort of peace. A criminal might constantly \nhear police cars pulling up; a Pander who believes in occult conspiracy theories may \nsee mysterious sigils scrawled on walls wherever he goes. These omens and experi- \nences are so all-pervading as to seriously affect the victim’s mental equilibrium. \nTo inflict Fear-Plague on a target, spend a Willpower Trait and defeat him \nin a Mental Challenge. If you win, he cannot spend Willpower Traits for any \npurpose that does not directly complement his Nature or directly affect him \nimmediate chances for survival as he perceives them. These effects last for one \nweek. Your victim must be within your line of sight when you activate this \npower though its effects persist regardless of where he is. \nADVANCED \nPATH \nOE PHOBOS \nLeech of Fear \nThe diets of demons are many and varied. Some feed on blood like \nCainites while others subsist on such diverse substances as the breath of infants \nor the remains of dead murderers. With this power, you may feed on other \nindividuals’ fears, drawing sustenance as if they were mortal vitae. \nYou may use this power on any given individual once per night. She must \nbe within your line of sight, and she must be currently afraid of or intimidated \nby something or someone (though this power will not work if the fear is an \nartificial product of another PathofPhobos power). Spend the usual Blood Trait \nto activate Leech ofFear and make a number of Simple Tests equal to six minus \nyour target’s number of Courage Traits. Each such test that you win or tie is one \nFear Trait that you may add to your Blood Pool. Fear Traits function exactly \nlike Blood Traits, except that all unspent Fear Traits disappear at sunrise. \nTHE TAKINC~ \nOF THE SPIRIT \nThrough this paths will-draining magics, you can strip mental stability, \nself-determination and even the very sense of self fromyour chosen victim. The \nTaking of the Spirit allows you, with time and practice, to reduce even the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nstrongest-willed individual to a mindless automaton who only exists to serve \nyour will. You must be within line of sight of your target for all of the following \npowers to work. The Taking of the Spirit uses the Subterfuge Ability for retests. \nBASIC  TAKIN^ OE THE SPIRIT \nMind Leech \nThe most basic power of this Path allows you to temporarily drain a small \nportion of a target’s mental stamina. Your victim has no idea what causes the \nsudden listlessness she experiences; she only knows that she feels listless, \ndrained, distracted and discouraged. \nMake astatic Mental Challenge against adifficulty of the victim’s Mental \nTraits. If you win, your subject must bid an additional Trait on all Mental \nChallenges for the rest of the scene. You may only successfully use Mind Leech \non an individual once per scene, though multiple infemalists may all apply it \nto the same target. \nStigmatize \nYou may now probe deeper into your victim’s psyche, impairing her ability \nto relate to other individuals. As with Mind Leech, your subject does not know \nthe cause of her mysterious loss of social aptitude - \nshe simply feels detached, \nantisocial and unable to relate to other people. \nMake a Static Mental Challenge against adifficulty of the victim’s Mental \nTraits. If you win, your subject must bid an additional Social Trait on all Social \nChallenges for the rest of the scene. You may only successfully use Stigmatize \non an individual once per scene, though multiple infernalists may all apply it \nto the same target. \nINTERMEDIATE \n TAKIN^ OE THE SPIRIT \nDrain Resolve \nYour ability to siphon away your victim’s will has progressed to such an \nextent that you may impair her ability to regain self-determination. This \npower’s psychological effects resemble those of deep depression. As in the case \nof the previous powers, Drain Resolve has no obvious source. \nWithin five minutes of a successful use of Mind Leech, issue a Mental \nChallenge against the same target. If you win, your victim must spend three \nWillpower Traits, not one, to refresh her Mental Traits. The target should \nroleplay the psychological effects, which last until the next sunrise. \nSap Will \nWith Sap WiU, you may strike at the very heart of your victim’s psyche, stripping \naway her very strength of self. This is not without its dangers as a particularly strong \nmind can turn your attack back upon you. Unlike the lesser powers of Taking of the \nSpirit, Sap Will is obvious to its victim as some sort of mystic attack. \nIssue a Mental Challenge, bidding three Mental Traits. If you win, your \nvictim loses a Willpower Trait. You may use Sup Will to drain no more than \nthree Willpower Traits per night from any given target. \nADVANCED \n TAKIN^ OE THE SPIRIT \nThe Gift of Servitude \nThough this path‘s lesser magics have the potential to temporarily weaken \na victim, Gift of Servitude is the goal to which all students of Taking of the Spirit \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\neventually aspire. Through this feat of magical manipulation, you can bind \nyour victim’s will to your own, leaving him little more than an empty shell who \nfollows your commands with perfect obedience. \nGift of Servitude will only work on an individual who has no Mental Traits \nleft. Once you have prepared the target, spend a Willpower Trait and issue a \nSocial Challenge. If you win, your target is affected as if you have bound him \nto you via the Dominate power Conditioning (Laws of the Night, p. 147). This \nlasts for one week. If you lose the Social Challenge, you may not use Gift of \nServitude on that target for one full year. \nDARK \nTHAUMATURC~ICAL \nRITUALS \nTo cast aDurk Thaumaturgy ritual, follow the same procedure as for casting \na ritual from Thaumaturgy. Make a Static Mental Challenge with a difficulty \ndependent on the level of the ritual: five Traits for a Basic ritual, seven for \nIntermediate and nine for Advanced. The only exceptions to this are the two \nvariable-level rituals below, whose difficulty is equal to two plus the number \nof Willpower Traits that the target demon has. \nBASIC \nDARK \nTHAUMATUR~ICAL \nRITUALS \nCall Forth the Host (Variable Level) \nThis ritual’s existence is no secret, for folklore has spoken of infernalists’ \nability to summon demons for untold centuries. It is taught in many forms, and \nthe particulars vary widely. However, the one constant is that the ritual \nrequires some form of sacrifice. Blood, souls, lives and unique material \npossessions are popular as are desecrated holy relics and items that have been \nused to perform acts of violence. The precise sacrifice depends on the nature \nof the demon in question (and is left to the Storyteller’s discretion). You must \nalso know the demon’s True Name in order to summon it. \nA successful casting of this ritual does not guarantee that you have a \nwilling or loyal servant. It only indicates that you have brought the demon to \nthis plane of existence. To bind the demon to your will, you must defeat it in \nboth a Social Challenge (to convince it of your dominance) and a Mental \nChallenge (to impose your terms of service upon it). \nIf you lose the Social Challenge, you do not impress the demon with your \ntransparent attempts at power and it either leaves or attacks you as it sees fit. \nIf you lose the Mental Challenge, the demon returns to Hell rather than accept \nsuch unfavorable terms. If you are unfortunate enough to lose both challenges, \nthe demon drags you back to Hell as it goes - \nmake a new character. If you win \nboth of these challenges, you must then expend a number of Mental Traits \nequal to the demon’s Willpower Traits (see below) in order to finish binding \nit to your will. You may spend additional Mental Traits at this time to increase \nthe length of the demon’s service to you; see below. If you are unable to expend \nthe full number of Mental Traits, the result is the same as if you had failed the \nMental Challenge to impose your terms of service upon the demon. \nIf the entire procedure is successful, your demon is your loyal (though not \nblindly loyal) servant for a period equal to 24 hours, minus one hour per Mental \nTrait you had to expend to complete the binding, plus one hour for every \nadditional Mental Trait you spent. At the end of this time, the demon vanishes \nin a flash of hellfire, returning to its infernal home. You must be careful to \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nphrase your commands very precisely as most demons summoned with this \nritual are resentful and will only obey the letter of the order unless you placate \nthem with very favorable terms of service. “Very favorable” depends on the \ndemon in question, and the Storyteller is free to make you research it. \nBind the Interloper (Variable Level) \nInfemalists are a fractious lot, and the purposes of one may lie against those \nof another. Bind the Interloper allows you to take control of a demon that \nanother infemalist has summoned, turning it against its former master. The \ninducements you may use to achieve this end are varied, ranging from blood \nto material items to souls, and the precise forms of the ritual depend on what \nyou believe will attract the demon’s attention. You must also know the True \nName of the demon in question and the name or face of the infemalist whom \nit serves. Finally, your Dark Thaumaturgy must be at an equal or greater level \nthan that required to summon the demon in the first place (see below). \nBind the Interloper requires 15 minutes to cast for every Willpower Trait \nthe target demon has. If the casting is successful, you have attracted the \ndemon’s attention. You must then defeat its current master in a Mental \nChallenge. If you win, the demon transfers its loyalty to you for the \nremainder of its term of service. If you lose, you lose three Willpower Traits \nand the demon’s master receives a perfect mental picture of your face \n(though no other information concerning your identity unless the demon is \non good enough terms with him to tell him) and the knowledge that you just \ntried to take his servant away from him. \nCurse of Oedipus \nBy invoking the legacy of Oedipus, who tore out his eyes when he became \naware of his crimes against his own family, you may inflict temporary blindness \non a victim. You must know the face of your intended target, and you must \nconcentrate on this image while inhaling the fumes from a burning stick of \nincense. When the incense is done burning, your victim receives the Flaw: \nBlind (Laws of the Night, p. 1 16) for five hours, minus one hour for every Trait \nof Conscience or Conviction he has (thus, individuals with five Conscience or \nConviction Traits are immune to the Curse 0fOedipu.s). During this time, the \nvictim is overcome by grief for every wrong, real or imagined, that he has \ncommitted, and he weeps tears of blood (which can be deeply disturbing for \nmortals and a threat to the Masquerade for Cainites). \nVideo Nefa \nThe forces of Hell are everywhere, or so most infemalists believe. Accord- \ningly, the sum of all knowledge is open to you if you can find the demon who \nknows what you want to learn. V h o  Nefus allows you to commune with an \ninvisible messenger imp who whispers the secrets of the universe in your ear. \nBeware, though: this ritual causes the demons it commands to tell you the truth, \nbut they will only tell you as much of that truth as you can force them to reveal. \nTo enact Video Nefas, write your question in black ink, using a sharpened \nbone as a stylus. Snap the bone in two, bum the surface that you wrote the \nquestion on and make five Simple Tests. The number of these Tests that you \nwin or tie determines how much information your demon informants reveal to \nyou. You may not declare retests for these tests though a generous Storyteller \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmay allow you to perform Mental Tests to analyze the accuracy of the answers \nif you possess Abilities that relate to the subject of the question. \nWith one win or tie, you can learn the answer to a “yes or no” question. Two \ngives you a short sentence’s worth of information. If you win or tie three times, \nyou receive a short synopsis (three to five sentences). A complete answer, \nperhaps two or three paragraphs’ worth, comes with four wins or ties. If you win \nor tie all five Simple Tests, you learn the complete truth behind the subject of \nyour inquiry, perhaps even facts previously unknown to any mortal or Cainite. \nI NTFRMFDIATF DARK \nTHAUMATUR~ICAL \nRITUALS \nFelis Negrum \nRumors of Gangrel infemalists abound because of this ritual, which allows \nyou to change yourself or another individual into a black cat. To cast Felis \nNegrum on yourself, you must have three whiskers from a black cat; to transform \nsomeone else, you will need the skin of a white cat. You must bum this material \nover a one-foot square of glass, then inscribe on the glass, in your own blood, the \nname of the individual you wish to transform (using one Blood Trait). \nIf you use this ritual on yourself, its effects last indefinitely, and you can return \nto your natural form whenever you wish. A ghoul or a mortal is transformed for 24 \nhours while another vampire is changed for 13 nights, less one night for every \nMorality Trait he has. If you cast this ritual on an unwilling recipient, you must \ndefeat him in a Mental Challenge after a successful casting. This metamorphosis \nonly changes the subject’s physical form; it doesnot affect clothingorcarried items. \nA character in cat form loses his normal Physical Traits; they are replaced \nwith one Trait each of &le, \nEnergetic, Nimble and Quick. His normal Social \nTraits remain, though he may have some difficulty applying them under most \ncircumstances as he loses the power of speech. His Mental Traits also remain \nas normal. He is an exceptionally durable cat, however, as he retains his usual \nHealth Levels, Disciplines and Blood Pool. A transformed vampire is a \nvampiric cat, complete with fangs, a lack of pulse or respiration and bite and \nclaw attacks that do one Health Level of aggravated damage. The magic of this \nchange renders the subject immune to Dominate and Presence, but Animalism \naffects him as if he were an actual cat. \nPlague’s Secret Domain \nAlthough many Kindred consider themselves safe from mortal diseases, \nthey overlook illnesses of the mind and heart. P h p ’ s  Secret Donain unlocks \nthe secrets of these maladies, allowing you to inflict a morbid weariness on \nmortal and vampire alike. Casting this ritual requires you to intone a one-hour \nchant in front of a ritual fire in which you bum the corpse of a freshly killed \nmourning dove. At the end of the hour, you must extinguish the fire with two \nBlood Traits from someone pure of heart (five Humanity Traits), then spend \nany number of temporary or permanent Willpower Traits and defeat your \nintended victim in a Mental Challenge. \nOnce you have successfully cast Plague’s Secret Domain, your target falls into \na crushing depression, which she should roleplay. She is down two Traits on any \nSocial or Mental Challenge due to listlessness and apathy, and is down three \nTraits (these penalties are cumulative) on any challenge that may result in her \ndeath. These effects last for one night for every temporary Willpower Trait you \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nspent and one lunar month for every permanent Willpower Trait you spent. A \nvampire whose depression lasts for one lunar month or more must win a Self- \nControl or Instincts Virtue Test against a difficulty of the number of permanent \nWillpower Traits you spent. If she fails, she enters torpor at the end of the ritual's \nduration. A mortal whose depression lasts a similar length of time must win the \nsame Virtue Test or commit suicide when the ritual's duration expires. \nADVANCED \nDARK THAUMATUR~ICAL \nRITUALS \nClose the Ways \nIf your hatred of a given target - \nor at least your ill will- is great enough, \nyou can wreak untold havoc upon his fortune. Close the Ways is the path to such \ndoom. It is deceptively simple in its execution. To cast it, you must meditate \nnaked while kneeling on a stone surface for six hours while 14 black candles \nbum down around you. At the end of this time, you extinguish all 14 candles \nwith the palm of your left hand. As each candle flame goes out, speak the birth \nname of your target. You must also expend seven temporary and three \npermanent Traits each in the Social and Mental categories as well as a \npermanent Willpower Trait. If the ritual fails, you still lose the Willpower \nTrait, though not the permanent Attribute Traits. \nYour victim suffers catastrophic bad luck if this ritual succeeds. First, all \nInfluence expenditures require one more Trait than normal as strings don't \npull as easily and pawns are difficult to contact and exert pressure over. Second, \nhe treats all ties on Simple Tests as losses. Third and most damaging, he gains \nthe Cursed Negative Trait, and anyone who knows of the curse may bid against \nhim in any challenge. These effects persist for a number of months equal to the \nnumber of permanent Willpower Traits you possess after casting the ritual. \nYou may remove this ritual's effects should you so choose, as may anyone \nelse who knows Close the Ways. This requires a one-hour ceremony conducted \nin a graveyard in which the individual lifting the curse cuts off his own left \nhand (incurring three levels of lethal damage) and expends a permanent \nWillpower Trait. \nInto the Abyss \nAlthough the wisdom of such a course of action is debatable at best, \nsometimes insanity is the only option. Into the Abyss is insane by most \nstandards, even those of infernalists, for this ritual opens a portal to Hell itself. \nSome dark thaumaturges claim that this is the best way to commune with \ndemons of great power while others tell stories of ancient treasures (or \nslumbering Methuselahs) contained in the depths of the infernal regions. Still \nothers study this ritual as a last hope against the threat of capture. \nTo enact Into the Abyss, you must spend 24 hours, midnight to midnight, \npainting the sigils of power on a stone wall with the blood of children and a \nbrush made from the hair of a white horse. Staying awake during the day \nrequires one Static Mental Challenge for every hour of local daylight, with a \ndifficulty of nine Traits minus the vampire's number of Morality Traits (retest \nwith Survival). Once you have successfully cast the ritual, the portal opens and \nremains open for a number of hours equal to your permanent Willpower Traits. \nDuring this time, anyone can enter the portal. No one, including a demon, can \nleave Hell through it without your express permission. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThis ritual is a particularly problematic one in a live-action setting, due \nto the difficulty inherent in simulating Hell and the potential issues that such \na game raises. Storytellers are advised to use Into the Abyss for dramatic effect, \nnot as a garbage disposal for groups of player characters. \nSup F RI o R I) \nF MFNTATI o N \nElder Dementation: Lingering Malaise \nWhile lesser Malkavians are only able to inflict temporary (though \nsometimes very long-lasting) insanity on their victims, your power to twist the \npsyche has progressed to such an extent that you can gift your subjects with \npermanent psychological shifts and dementia. \nYou must speak to your victim for at least a minute, describing in vivid and \nprecise detail the derangement that you wish to inflict upon her. This may take \nplace in the middle of an ordinary conversation if you wish; you do not have to \nexplicitly state what you are doing until you make the challenge. When you have \ndescribed the derangement in sufficient detail, spend a Willpower Trait and make \na Social Challenge. If you win, your target receives one permanent derangement \nof your choice. You may only inflict one derangement per game session on any \ngiven target, though you may make multiple attempts until you succeed. \nIn the interest of fairness, it’s polite to get Storyteller approval for any “non- \nstandard” (i.e. “not published in a Mind’s Eye Theatre book”) derangement. \nElder Dementation: Shattered Mirror \nAlthough some Dementation powers are subtle, initiating or promoting \ninsanity, Shattered Mirror results in immediate and devastating effects. With \nbut a glance, you can bestow your own psychological afflictions on another \nvictim, spreading your own derangements like a psychological virus. \nTo inflict Shattered Mirror, make eye contact with your target, spend a \nWillpower Trait and one or more Mental Traits, and defeat her in a Social \nChallenge. Your victim receives allof your derangements and Mental Flaws for \none night per Mental Trait you expended. \nMaster Dementation: Restructure \nAt this level of mastery, you may now rewrite the most fundamental aspects \nof a subject’s mind, changing his very self-image and worldview. Victims of \nResmture often compare the experience to a religious rebirth or a philosophical \nepiphany and state that their new mindset feels completely natural and they \ndon’t really understand why they used to act the way they did. Your target retains \nall his memories but may view his previous actions in a radically different light. \nTo Restructure a subject, make eye contact with him, spend a number of \nMental Traits equal to his total number of permanent Willpower Traits and \ninitiate a Social Challenge. If you win, his Nature changes to one of your choice, \nand your subject should roleplay his new mindset appropriately. This effect is \npermanent unless undone by another application of Restructure, though even \nsuch a restoration is hardly flawless due to the complexity of the effort. \nIf you lose the Social Challenge, including all retests, your victim may \nspend a Willpower Trait to initiate a Social Challenge against you. If he wins, \nyour Nature changes to his Nature for the next lunar month. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAscendant Dementation: Personal Scourge \nThis fearsome power goes beyond the psychological aspects of madness. \nWith Personal Scourge, you may turn a victim’s own mind against him in a \npsychic attack with explicit physical manifestations. In effect, he is tom apart \nby the force of his own will. His body erupts in violent stigmata - \nbruises, \nlacerations, punctures and abrasions appear over the surface of his skin as he \nsprays blood and howls in agony. Observers using Aura Perception see the \nvictim’s aura exude spiritual tendrils and lashes even as it swirls into the \npatterns of extreme psychosis. \nTo attack a victim with Personal Scourge, you must touch him or make eye \ncontact, spend two Willpower Traits, and defeat him in a Social Challenge. \nFor each of the next three turns, he makes a number of Simple Tests equal to \nhis number of permanent Willpower Traits. Each test he loses is one level of \nlethal damage that he receives. During these three turns, he may take no \nactions other than thrashing, gibbering and howling in agony - \nthis includes \nspending blood to heal himself. \nMethuselah Dementation: Lunatic Emption \nMost Malkavians know of this power’s existence, if only as a dim legend \npassed down through the clan. It has seen no confirmed use in the modem era, \nand the only reliable account of its appearance in past nights places a \nMalkavian Methuselah at the final battle of Carthage. Lunatic Eruption is a \ndevastating area-wide psychic effect that triggers a massive orgy of destruction. \nUnconfirmedrumors from within the Black Hand state that one of the Seraphs \nknows, or has access to a master of, this power and has used it as a threat against \nthe Camarilla in recent nights. \nTo activate Lunatic Eruption, spend eight Willpower Traits and make a \nStatic Mental Challenge against a difficulty of 12 Traits. The entire city (or \neveryone in a radius of 30 miles if you are not in an urban area) falls into \ntemporary insanity. Mortals riot, loot, rape and bum. Cainites go berserk or \nenter hunger frenzies, laying waste to all in their path and draining as many \nvessels as they can consume. Other supernatural beings suffer similar effects: \nWerewolves take their war forms and go berserk against any likely target, and \nmagicians and fae revel in the sudden influx of wild power they receive. These \neffects persist until the next sunrise. \nA Cainite who’s caught in the “blast radius’’ must make a Self-control/ \nInstincts Virtue Test against a five-Trait difficulty. If she fails, she succumbs to \nthe madness and instantly frenzies. Once she recovers from the initial frenzy, \nshe is down three Traits on any further attempt to resist any other frenzy trigger \nfor the rest of the night. \nThis sort of game-wide effect is best used as a background plot device. The \nStoryteller should convene an all-hands meeting (preferably at the beginning of \nthe game session) in order to conduct the mass Virtue Test and to ensure that all \nplayers know what is happening to them and around them. It’s hard to simulate a \nhowling mob in live action, so player understanding of offstage events is key. \nMYTHFRCFRIA \nThe reclusive Kiasyd care little for the affairs of other Kindred, so reliable \nknowledge of their bastardized faerie powers is difficult to come by. Those few \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSabbat who have dealt with Kiasyd characterize their Discipline, Mythreria, \nas a path of twisted perceptions - \nwhether those perceptions be of the Kiasyd \nor of her unfortunate victims. In some ways, My therceriu is similar to Auspex for \nits ability to reveal insights about the world; in others, it resembles Dementution \nin its ability to bring the sturdiest mind crashing down in madness. Few, if any, \nKiasyd are willing to teach this Discipline to outsiders. They value the power \nthat it gives them and fear that, were their abilities too well-known, the \nSabbat’s regard for their might could turn to mindless hunger. \nMytherceria users retest with the Awareness Ability. At the Storyteller’s \ndiscretion, the specialized Ability Faerie Lore may augment or replace Awure- \nness for this purpose. \nBASIC MYTHERCERIA \nFolderol \nThe first shroud of reality through which you see is that of untruth. This \npower’s precise manifestation varies with each practitioner. You may weep or \nsweat blood, see the liar’s tongue assume unnatural shapes or colors, or \nexperience a crawling sensation on your hands or neck. Regardless of the \ntrappings, the result is the same: you know a lie when you hear one. \nWhen someone makes a statement that you want to assess, make a Static \nMental Challenge with a difficulty of the subject’s number of Social Traits, plus \none for every Subterfuge Ability Trait he has. Success indicates that you know \nwith absolute certainty whether or not the statement was true. You must be able \nto hear the statement as it is spoken (or read the speaker’s lips if you are deaf), \nand you must make this challenge for each statement that you want to analyze. \nFae Sight \nYour ability to view multiple levels of reality at once has advanced to the \npoint that you can perceive all things fae as they truly are. With a small amount \nof effort, you can also scrutinize an area to determine if faerie magic was \nrecently used there or if faerie beings were present. \nThe first part of this power is always in effect. No challenge is needed. You \ninstantly recognize all fae beings as such. If you are viewing a faerie in a mortal \nbody, you see the individual‘s true form with a ghostly superimposed silhouette \nof its “human” appearance. \nTo determine if an area held fae creatures or was subjected to fae magic \nwithin the past three nights, concentrate for a turn and expend a Mental Trait. \nTraces of faerie presence appear to you as faintly glowing footprints, runes or \nscorch marks. Interpretation of these signs may require one or more Static \nMental Challenges, as determined by the Storyteller, but you can always tell \nwhether or not the signs are actually there. \nINTERMEDIATE \nMYTHERCERIA \nAura Absorption \nThis power is virtually identical to the first Intermediate Auspex power, \nSpirit’s Touch, and the same rules should be applied (Laws of the Night, p. \n138). However, when youexamine anobject with Aura Absorption, youdevour \nthe psychic traces on it. Anyone who attempts to examine the same object \nwith The Spirit’s Touch or Aura Absorption after you have finished with it must \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nwin a Static Mental Challenge against your permanent Mental Traits in order \nto glean any impressions. \nChanjelin Ward \nYou may create arcane glyphs that reveal your own altered perceptions to \nothers. However, most individuals don’t handle seeing reality the way you see \nit. While not directly threatening, these wards are sufficiently distracting that \nmost characters who see them become disoriented, which may lead to other \nunpleasant complications. These wards may guard a single object, affect an \nindividual who wears the clothing on which they are inscribed or fill an entire \nroom with their effects. \nTo inscribe a Chanjelin Ward, spend one turn tracing the ward on the \ntarget object with your fingertip (if warding an entire room, spend 10 minutes \ntracing the ward on the floor) and make a Static Mental Challenge with a \ndifficulty of seven traits. Success means that anyone touching the object or \nentering the room is down two Traits on all Mental Challenges for as long as \nshe is in contact with the item or in the room. Additionally, she must win a \nStatic Mental Challenge against a difficulty of nine Traits or become lost until \nsomeone leads her to familiar surroundings. \nIf the object you are warding is currently worn by another individual, make \na Mental Challenge against her instead. Success inflicts the above effects on \nher, but no one else is affected by the wards unless they don the afflicted item. \nA Chnjelin Ward lasts for one night. You may extend this at the time of \ncreation by spending one Blood Trait per extra night. A victim is only affected \nby one Chanjelin Ward at a time. Any character who has Chanjelin Ward is \nimmune to all Chanjelin Wards. \nADVANCED \nMYTHERCERIA \nRiddle Phantastique \nYour study of “reality” has now progressed to the point that you have an \ninnate knowledge of the underpinnings of the universe - \nthough, to anyone \nwho does not share your altered perceptions, this knowledge is closer to \nmadness. You may share your unique insights with any one subject who can \nhear you ask your penetrating philosophical questions (and, of course, under- \nstand the language in which you are speaking). The Riddle Phantastique is so \narcane that it can drive its victims to madness, even self-inflicted injury, until \nthey solve it. Insanity is neither a sure solution nor a certain doom where the \nRiddle Phantastique is concerned. Some deranged minds are capable of unrav- \neling it with ease while others are driven even farther into incoherence. \nTo inflict the Riddle Phantastique, speak to your victim and make a \nchallenge that pits your Social Traits against her Mental Traits. If you win, the \nsubject falls into a trance state as the complexities of your twisted logic ensnare \nher mind. She may take no actions while so entranced as all her concentration \nis devoted to solving the riddle. \nOnce per half-hour, the victim makes a Static Mental Challenge against a \ndifficulty of your Mental Traits (retest with Occult, and she gains a number of free \nOccult Ability Traits, usable only for these retests, equal to the number of \nDementation powers she has). Once she wins three such tests, she solves the riddle \nand breaks the trance. Every time she fails a retest, she tears at herself in spasms of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nraging frustration, inflicting one level of lethal damage upon herself. At any time, \nyou may tell her the answer to the Riddle Phuntastique and end the trance. The same \nindividual may be the target of Riddle Phuntastique on multiple occasions as you \nhave a virtually limitless supply of questions. For roleplaying purposes, you may \nwant to have a supply of Zen riddles or advanced calculus problems on hand so that \nyou can actually issue your enigma as an in-character statement. \nSUPERIOR \nMYTHERCERIA \nElder Mytherceria: Steal the Mind \nThough it superficially resembles some forms of telepathy, Steal the Mind is \na much more invasive power than those of Advanced and Superior Auspex. \nMany Kiasyd believe that their line’s founder developed this ability from the \nmemory-altering arts of his faerie brethren. At this level of mastery, your ability \nto perceive various aspects of reality is so advanced that you may plumb the \ndepths of a subject’s psyche for any memory he has - \neven those that he has \nrepressed or someone else has erased with Dominate. This theft is temporary, for \na victim’s memories trickle through your fingers over the course of the night, but \nwhile you have possession of your subject’s mind, he is little more than a husk. \nTo steal a victim’s mind, make eye contact with him, spend a Willpower \nTrait, and initiate a Mental Challenge. If you succeed, you have full access to \nall of his memories. He becomes comatose or torporous, depending on whether \nhe is mortal or Cainite. You may search his mind for anything that he knows, \nthough Static Mental Challenges (with Storyteller assistance) may be neces- \nsary to find suppressed or erased information. You retain the victim’s memories \nfor one hour (unless you choose to give them back sooner), and may extend this \ntime by spending Willpower Traits at the rate of one per additional hour. If you \nfeel benevolent, you may choose to release your victim’s mind at any time. \nWhile you are in possession of your victim’s mind, you gain a number of \nKnowledgeable Mental Traits equal to one-third the total number of Mental \nTraits he has (rounded down). However, you also receive an equal number of \nOblivious Negative Mental Traits thanks to the distraction that holding two \nsets of memories in your head incurs. \nMaster Mytherceria: Absorb the Mind \nWhile Steal the Mind allows you to pilfer a subject’s memories, Absorb the \nMind goes beyond even this impressive theft, allowing you to “borrow” \nportions of your victim’s psyche, taking the fruits of his learning for your own. \nThis procedure is less overtly invasive than Steal the Mind, for the subject is still \nable to function, but many of its victims consider it much crueler. \nTo absorb a portion of your victim’s mind, make eye contact, spend a \nWillpower Trait and any number of Mental Traits, and initiate a Mental \nChallenge. If you win, you may take a number of Ability Traits from your \nvictim equal to the number of Mental Traits you spent to activate Absorb the \nMind. Your victim loses these Traits as if he had spent them for retests, \nregaining them normally at the next game session. You may spend these stolen \nTraits as if they were your own, but once spent (or at the end of the session, if \nyou haven’t spent them by then) they return to their rightful owner. \nAscendant Mytherceria: The Grandest Trick \nAccording to Lasombra legend, the Kiasyd share a strong bond with the \nfae folk-strong enough to call upon the faerie blood that taints the bloodline. \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe Grandest Trick is a bittersweet legacy of this blood, for it allows you to \ntemporarily bring the faint traces of faerie heritage to the forefront of your \nblood, overwhelming Caine’s curse for a few precious hours. \nTo perform The Gradest Trick, spend 10 Blood Traits and one or more \nWillpower Traits and make a Static Mental Challenge against a difficulty of \n15 Traits minus your number of Morality Traits. If you succeed, you briefly \nshrug off the Curse of Caine and revert to mortality (including your pre- \nEmbrace mortal appearance) at the next sunrise. You retain no vampiric \nqualities while mortal. You have no Blood Pool, and you lose access to all \nDisciplines except the second basic Mytherceria power, FIX Sight. You lose all \nAttribute and Ability Traits in excess of normal human maximums (10 \nAttribute Traits per category, a maximum of five Traits in any one Ability, and \na maximum of six Willpower Traits; you decide which Traits to cross off). You \ndo not actually lose all memory of being a vampire, though all of your \nexperiences in unlife take on a hazy, dreamlike quality, and you must make a \nStatic Mental Challenge against a nine-Trait difficulty to recall any specifics \nof Cainite existence. To outside observers, you appear a normal mortal, though \nyour aura appears to be that of a faerie. \nThe Gradest Trick lasts for one hour per Willpower Trait you spent when \nyou activated the power. When you have one hour of “mortality” left, you \nbegin to feel a strange compulsion to seek shelter from sunlight. You are aware \nof your impending return to unlife, even if you are unable to recall any other \naspect of your personal history. When this power’s duration of effect expires, \nyou instantly revert to your normal state of existence, regaining all Traits and \nDisciplines. Your Blood Pool contains 10 Blood Traits when this power wears \noff, regardless of how many you had left when you invoked The Grandest Trick. \nIf you are killed while in mortal form, you die and may not be re-Embraced. \nNECROMANCY \nThough the Giovanni clan likes to claim exclusive mastery of necroman- \ntic blood magic, the truth is that Necromancy is something of an open secret. \nWhile it’s not a subject that a Camarilla occultist teaches for cash, nor does a \nSabbat priscus know necromantic rites to go with her auctoritas rim, odds are \nthat a truly dedicated Cainite scholar can find an instructor for the right price. \nNecromancy may be more common in the Sabbat than in the Camarilla, due \nin part to the interest that practitioners of the Path of Death and the Soul have \nin it. For that matter, Necromancy is largely held to be amore “acceptab1e”form \nof blood magic than Thaumaturgy as the former deals more closely with the \nundead condition. As with Thumturgy, Necromancy is hardly an organized \nfield of study in the sect, and lessons are largely a matter of catch as catch can. \nThere are a few somewhat cohesive groups within the Sabbat which \npractice Necromancy, though none are large enough to be formal organizations \nof scholars in any sense. Some Tzimisce kolduns are versed in the Ash Path, which \nthey use as a means of dealing with another family of spirits. A small but \nwidespread network ofNosferatuantitrh.4 and Sabbat-affiliated Samedi collabo- \nrate in using various Sepulchre Path arts for their own ends, most often the \nacquisitionofpriceless information. The Sabbat Inquisition and the Black Hand \nare both believed to use various rituals in their investigations and operations, \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthough this is more rumor than fact. Finally, the recently arrived Harbingers of \nSkulls make use of their own unique permutation on the dark arts. \nTHE \nMORTUUS \nPATH \nThe Harbingers of Skulls claim to have developed their proprietary \nMortuus Path during their long sojourn in the Underworld. Of course, whether \nthis is true or simply another one of the veils in which the Harbingers wrap \nthemselves is a matter of some conjecture. Regardless, the Harbingers do have \naccess to powers that no Giovanni has ever demonstrated or admitted to \nknowing. The Mortuus Path deals with the physical processes and manifesta- \ntions of death as they affect the physical form. \nThe Harbingers learn the Mortuus Path as their primary Necromancy path. \nOnce a Harbinger has attained the first Intermediate level of this path, he may \nbegin to study the basic levels of another. Once he reaches the Advanced level \nof the Mortuus Path, he may raise his second path to the Intermediate level and \nbegin to study the remaining paths, which he may not raise past the second \nBasic level until he has reached the Advanced stage of his second path. \nThough the Harbingers shouldn’t be player characters, they have taught the \nbasics of their art to a very few students, most of whom seem to have been \nselected for no identifiable common quality. As always with blood magic, the \naccessibility of these powers is wholly subject to Storyteller approval. \nBASIC MORTUUS \nPATH \nNECROMANCY \nReaper’s Shroud \nYou may take on the semblance of a corpse or inflict this same transfigu- \nration on another individual. The victim of this power resembles a cadaver in \nthe advanced stages of deterioration - \nskin yellows and stretches, eyeballs \nshrink, and joints become stiff. Though the most obvious application of this \npower is as a temporary curse, some practitioners use it as a means of disguise \nor concealment or simply to terrify unsuspecting mortals. \nIf you wish to assume this form yourself, simply spend a Blood Trait. The \nchange is instantaneous. If you want to inflict it on another subject, you must \nspend the Blood Trait and defeat him in a challenge of your Mental Traits \nagainst his Physical Traits. The subject of Reaper’s Shroud gains the Negative \nPhysical Traits Decrepit and Lethargic and the Negative Social Trait Repugnant. \nHowever, she also gains one free retest on any attempt to remain completely \nmotionless (including attempts to be stealthy while not moving), and she is up \nthree Traits on any challenge in which she attempts to intimidate or to inflict \nfear. The effects of this power last until the next sunrise or sunset, at which time \nthey fade. A vampire can remove all these effects by spending two Blood Traits \nto reverse her body’s deterioration. \nBlight \nWith Blight, you can push a victim closer to the edge of her grave, spinning \nout the thread of her life by decades in a single moment. Your target suffers all \nthe effects of advanced age: wrinkled and weathered skin, arthritic joints, \nfragile bones, poor perception and occasionally even mental impairment. \nTo inflict Blight on someone, touch her, spend a Blood Trait and defeat her \nin a challenge of your Mental Traits against her Physical Traits. Until the next \ndusk or dawn, your victim receives the following Negative Traits: Decrepit, Sickly \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nand her choice of Delicate, Dull, Forgetful or Obliuious. Additionally, a mortal \nvictim of Blight risks cardiac arrest. Every turn that she engages in strenuous \nactivity, she must win a Static Physical Challenge with a five-Trait difficulty or \nsuffer a heart attack, the effects of which are left to the Storyteller’s discretion. \nINTERMEDIATE \nMORTUUS PATH \nNECROMANCY \nResume the Coil \nThis subtle but potent art allows you to defeat the effects of torpor, raising \na slumbering Cainite from the sleep of ages. It is one of the few Discipline \npowers that a character can use while in torpor, though most practitioners have \nno particular desire to enter this condition on a regular basis. Resume the Coil \nis by no means a soothing experience to undergo as it awakens its sleeping \nsubject’s body with a sudden infusion of the very energies of death itself, much \nlike an undead equivalent of cardiac shock paddles. Many recipients of this \npower have reported strange visions or near-Final Death experiences. \nTo activate Resume the Coil, spend a Willpower Trait and make a Static \nMental Challenge against a number of Traits equal to 10 minus your target’s \nnumber of Morality Traits. If you are attempting to awaken yourself, you must \nspend an additional Willpower Trait. If you are using this power on another \nindividual, you must touch him. A vampire who entered torpor due to lack of \nblood awakens with one Blood Trait, and will not enter a hunger frenzy for the \nfirst hour after he arises. \nTrue Death \nA power whose benefits are not altogether certain or obvious, True Death \nis just what its name implies. For a brief period of time, you may cast off the \nCurse of Caine - \nbut unlike other methods of attaining such a goal, True Death \nrenders you both clinically and spiritually dead. Your body becomes an inert \ncadaver, indistinguishable from that of any other dead mortal, and it obeys all \nthe laws thereof. Sunlight and True Faith have no particular effect on you, your \nblood is stale and unpalatable, and you exhibit no signs of life or unlife, lacking \neven an aura. However, your soul is trapped in an inanimate husk, and the only \naction you may attempt is awakening from this slumber. \nYou may automatically assume this form at any time. Awakening from it, \nhowever, requires you to expend two Blood Traits. While you are under True \nDeath’s effects, you have no access to any Disciplines, even “automatic” ones \nsuch as Fortitude. You do not, however, consume blood nightly, nor do you enter \ntorpor unless you choose to. The only way your body can be externally \ndistinguished from that of a deceased mortal is with extended observation over \na period of years (beyond the scope of most games): You do not decay. However, \nif you have more than 10 Blood Traits in your Blood Pool and an enterprising \nmedical examiner cuts you open, the excess erupts from the incision in a high- \npressure crimson fountain (reducing you to 10 Blood Traits in the process). \nBarring outside interference, you may remain “dead” as long as you like. \nAnyone attempting to drain or drink your blood may take you down to zero \nBlood Traits in your system but may not diablerize you, and the blood they \nremove is considered “generic” mortal blood. However, any damage to your \nuninhabited “corpse” that would kill a vampire with no special Disciplines of \nresilience does, in fact, inflict Final Death upon you. Decapitation is still fatal, \nas is total incineration. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nADVANCED \nMORTUUS \nPATH \nNECROMANCY \nMercy for Seth \nPlague has always been one of humanity’s greatest fears. With this power, \nyou can visit such a fate upon your victims. This is a blood magic-generated effect \nand does not actually produce a virus or bacterium, but instead simulates the \neffects of such plagues with uncanny accuracy. Many Cainite elders who witness \nMercy for Seth in action are uncomfortably reminded of the various plagues that \nswept through Europe in the 11th through 15th centuries. Symptoms include \nblackened and bloated skin, blood sweat, blood in bodily excretions, suppurating \nlesions, swollen glands, chills, fever and delirium. A mortal victim of this plague \ngenerally dies within 24 hours while a vampire sinks into torpor. \nTo apply Mercy for Seth to a target, you must touch him, spend a Willpower \nTrait and a Blood Trait, and win a challenge of your Mental Traits against his \nPhysical Traits. A victim must make one Static Physical Challenge against a \nfive-Trait difficulty every hour. If he loses, he takes one level of lethal damage \n(if mortal) or receives one Negative Physical Trait of Sickly (if Cainite). A \nvampire who accumulates a number of Sickly Traits equal to his number of \nPhysical Traits sinks into torpor. \nMercy for Seth’s effects cannot be cured through scientific/medical tech- \nniques, though various magical practices or herbal remedies may have some \neffect at the Storyteller’s discretion. The “plague” leaves its victim on the third \nsunrise after it was inflicted, so a particularly hardy character may be able to \nstave it off long enough to walk away. \nNECROMANTIC \nRITUALS \nThese sinister rites use the same system presented in Laws of the Night (p. \n156). They originated with Sabbat practitioners ofNecronumcy, but they are not \nwholly exclusive to the sect. However, these secrets are anything but common, \neven within the Sabbat, and the Storyteller should feel free to treat them as even \nmore difficult to acquire than sect-specific Thaumaturgical rituals. \nBASIC NECROMANTIC \nRITUALS \nEldritch Beacon \nThis ritual allows you to create a small token that makes the bearer stand \nout like a bonfire in the lands of the dead. Melt a green candle and mold its wax \ninto a half-inch sphere. The bearer of this sphere, aware or otherwise, is down \none Trait on any attempts to resist the powers of any ghost (Arcanoi, if you are \nusing Oblivion). This effect lasts for one hour, plus one hour for every Blood \nTrait you expend when casting the ritual. \nPuppet \nSome Sabbat necromancers use Puppet to facilitate interrogations of the \ndead while others use it to shock the living (or the unliving) into cooperation. \nBy smearing herb-laden grave soil across the eyes, lips and forehead of a subject, \nyou prepare him for ghostly possession. For the rest of the scene, any wraith that \nattempts to enter the subject’s body and take control of him gains one free retest. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nINTERMEDIATE \nNECROMANTIC \nRITUALS \nDin of the Damned \nThis ritual bears some similarities to Call of the Hungry Dead (Laws of the \nNight, p. 157) in that it makes the sounds of the Underworld audible in the \nphysical realm. However, Din of the Damned affects an enclosed chamber, not \nan individual. Some necromancers use it to ensure privacy while others simply \ncast it for the psychological effect it has on those who encounter it. \nTo ward a room in this manner, draw an unbroken line of crematorium ash \naround its perimeter (you may go over doors and windows to allow entrance). \nUntil dawn, any attempt to eavesdrop on events inside the room, be it \nmundane, technologically- enhanced or supernatural, requires a Static Mental \nChallenge against a nine-Trait difficulty. Failure means the listener is partially \ndeafened by an unholy cacophony of ghostly screams and howling winds and \nreceives the Negative Mental Traits Oblivious x 2 for the rest of the night. \nPeek Past the Shroud \nErgot is a black mold that grows on unharvested grain in cold, damp \nweather. In its natural form, it is poisonous and can cause hallucinations. This \nritual allows you to enchant a handful of ergot to create a small amount of a \nsubstance that allows limited second sight. A successful ritual transforms a \nhandful of ergot into three doses of a fine black powder. An individual who \nconsumes one dose of this powder gains the benefits of Shroudsight (Basic Ash \nPath Necromncy, Laws of the Night, p. 154) for three hours. If you fail your \ninitial Mental Challenge to cast the ritual and subsequently fail a retest, the \nergot becomes highly poisonous. Any character (even a vampire) who ingests \nthe product of such a critically failed ritual takes four levels of lethal damage. \nThis cannot be used to create large amounts of toxin (in other words, no, you \ncan’t deliberately fail in order to manufacture poison; those who try may find \nthemselves with large batches of inert sludge). \nADVANCED \nNECROMANTIC \nRITUAL \nChill of Oblivion \nThis potent rite allows a necromancer to infuse her body or that of a \nwilling subject with the proverbial cold of the grave. This ritual has several \nbenefits, though its risks are not inconsiderable. To enact Chill ofoblivion, the \nsubject must lie naked on bare earth while a one-foot cube of ice melts on her \nchest (mortal subjects take three levels of bashing damage from the extreme \ncold). This takes an entire night (the ritual causes the ice to melt at a uniform \nspeed regardless of the air temperature). Once Chill of Oblivion is completed, \nits effects last for one week. \nAn individual affected by Chill of Oblivion converts aggravated damage \nfrom fire and high temperatures to lethal damage. She may also attempt to \nextinguish any open flame with which she is in contact by spending a \nWillpower Trait and making a Static Mental Challenge against a number of \nTraits determined by the fire’s size: three for a lighter or candle, five for a torch, \neight for a bonfire, 12 for a room OT 18 for an entire building. The Narrator \nrepresenting the fire may attempt to overbid on this challenge. \nWhile under Chill ofoblivion, the character’s aura is laced with writhing \nblack lines that appear as proof of diablerie to anyone not intimately familiar \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nwith this ritual. She also draws in heat from her immediate environment, \ngiving her the Flaws Touch of Frost and Eerie Presence. Finally, the taint of the \nUnderworld makes her appealing to malevolent spirits and susceptible to their \narts; all such entities are up three Traits when using their powers on her (Dark \nArcanoi, if you are using Oblivion). \nSUPERIOR \nOBTENEBRATION \nElder Obtenebration: The Darkness Within \nThough the casual observer may mistake this power’s manifestation for \nthat of ShroudofNight (Laws of the Night, p. 164), your command of the very \nstuff of darkness now reaches far beyond simple summoning. The cloud of \nshadow that you produce with The Darkness Within is an extension of your \ntainted soul, and its touch drains both courage and life from its victims. \nTo assault someone with The Darkness Within, spend a Blood Trait and a \nWillpower Trait. A cloud of shadow pours forth from whatever orifice you choose. \nMost Lasornbra expel this shadow from their mouths, though some cut themselves \nand let the darkness leak from the wound or command it to spring forth from other \nareas of their bodies. Whatever the precise source of this shadow, it rushes forward \nto envelop its designated target, covering him in an inch-thick shroud of liquid \ndarkness. This power may target anyone within 50 steps of you. \nWhile enveloped in this shadow, your victim suffers all the effects of \nShroud of Night. If he has not previously experienced the effects of Shroud of \nNight or The Darkness Within, he must also resist Rotschreck with a two-Trait \ndifficulty. Every turn, he must make a Static Physical Challenge against a five \nTraits difficulty; if he fails, the cloud drains one of his Blood Traits. \nYou must maintain total concentration to keep your victim ensnared. If \nyou sustain an attack, the cloud immediately rushes back to you. However, if \nyou voluntarily recall the cloud, you may absorb up to half the Blood Traits \n(rounded up) that it drained from its victim. This is considered the same as \ndrinking from the individual in question for purposes of blood bonds and other \nblood-borne effects. \nElder Obtenebration: Shadowstep \nYour kinship with the shadows is such that you can use one shadow as a \nportal to another by calling on the kinship that all darkness shares with its \nultimate source. To use Shadoeustep, you must be standing in a naturally occurring \nshadow --not one producedvia Obtenebration. Spend two Blood Traits and make \na Static Mental Challenge against a seven-Trait difficulty. If you win, you may \nshift your position up to 50 steps, so long as the point at which you end is within \nyour line of sight and is also in a natural shadow. You are not considered to have \nmoved “through” the intervening space in any sense - \noutside observers see \nyour form briefly obscured by a flicker like moonlight through tree branches, with \na similar effect at the point from which you emerge. Your clothes and personal \npossessions (up to half your body weight) travel with you. If you use Shadowstep \nas a means of Fair Escape, it occurs at the same speed as a normal action, which \nmeans an individual using Alacrity may be able to stop you. \nYou may bring one other person with you as you Shadowstep. This requires \nyou to spend a Willpower Trait in addition to the power’s other costs. If your \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ntraveling companion is unwilling to move with you, you must defeat her in a \nPhysical Challenge; if she wins, neither of you move. \nIf you wish to use Shadowstep to escape restraint, you must likewise spend \na Willpower Trait and win a Physical Challenge against the item or person \nrestraining you. If you’re held by another individual, success means you slip out \nof his grasp. If you are chained to a wall, handcuffed to a bed or tied to railroad \ntracks, a Narrator decides how many Physical Traits your bonds have. \nMaster Obtenebration: Shadow Twin \nYou may breathe a twisted semblance of life into an individual’s shadow, \ncausing it to become a dark mannequin. During this dim servant’s short life \nspan, it is your loyal servitor, obeying your commands with as much accuracy \nas its necessary limitations allow. \nTo animate a shadow, make astatic Mental Challenge against nine Traits \nand expend one or more Blood Traits. If you win, the target’s shadow takes on \na life of its own for one hour per Blood Trait you spent - \nthough it will last \nno longer than the next sunrise, regardless of how much blood you use to create \nit. It has all of its parent’s Physical, Social, Mental and Ability Traits and six \nHealth Levels (all Bruised for damage penalty purposes). It may invoke Shadow \nPlay at the cost of one Mental Trait. ANarrator should depict the Shadow Twin \nfor the duration of the night. \nA Shadow Twin may move no farther than 50 feet from its parent, though \nit may become two-dimensional and slide up walls or under doors. It may \nengage in combat, though it takes half damage from physical attacks and \ndouble damage from supernatural attacks, fire and sunlight. It is normally \nunder your verbal command, though you may release it to its parent’s service \nif you so desire. If a Shadow Twin “dies,” its parent loses one Willpower Trait. \nYou may animate a maximum number of Shadow Twins per night up to \nyour number of Morality Traits. \nAscendant Obtenebration: Oubliette \nUnlike the dungeon from which it draws its name, the Oubliette of \nObtenebration has no opening, and thus it is inescapable unless the jailer wills \nit. It is aprison of pure abysmal shadow, summoned around its victim no matter \nwhere she stands. To the outside observer, a victim of this power appears to be \ndrawn down a two-yard wide pool of darkness that forms under her in a second \nor less, sucks her in, ripples briefly as she passes its surface and then returns to \nimperturbable quiescence. \nTo entrap a victim in an Oubliette, spend five Willpower Traits and issue \naMentalChallenge that your victim resists with her PhysicalTraits. If you win, \nyour victim is encased in the Oubliette until you release her or until sunlight \ntouches the portion of the Oubliette that remains in the physical realm. You \nmay only summon one Oubliette at a time. \nYour victim is transported to a frigid, unlit, unventilated, spherical \nchamber just large enough for her to touch both walls with her outstretched \narms. If she is mortal, she suffocates in a number of minutes equal to her \nPhysical Traits. If she is Cainite, she may use no powers of any Discipline of \nwhich she does not possess an Ascendant or Methuselah power. She may think \nas much as she likes, however; the calm surroundings and isolation give her two \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n-+r \ni \ne \nbonus Traits on any Mental Challenge that she makes during this contempla- \ntion unless she has a phobia that the Oubliette would prey upon. \nMethuselah Obtenebration: Ahriman’s Demesne \nNo modem accounts of this power’s use are in evidence, though several \nprominent Sabbat founders claim that Montan0 invoked it during his final \ndefense of his sire. Ahriman’s Demesne allows you to summon a great, billowing \ndarkness capable of destroying all who stand within it. It is unclear if the cloud \nitself serves your will or if some darkling creatures within are your willing \nlegions, but the end result is the same. When the cloud withdraws into you, it \ntakes with it the bodies of all those who fell to its wrath, leaving behind their \npossessions - \nthe only mortal remains this world will ever see of them again. \nTo summon Ahriman’s Demesne, spend any number of Willpower Traits and \nconcentrate for three turns. During this time, the cloud billows out from your \nhands and eyes and under your clothing, spreading throughout a radius of 50 \npaces like a cold black mist. At the end of the third turn, this entire area is \nconsidered to be under ShroudofNight. At the beginning of each of the next three \nturns, everyone in the area of effect who you wish to destroy must make a Static \nPhysical Challenge against the number of Willpower Traits you spent invoking \nthis power. If they lose, they take three Health Levels of aggravated damage. \nAt the end of the third turn of damage, the cloud collapses back into you. \nAnyone who died within it, whether the fatal damage came from Ahriman’s \nDemesne or another source, disappears, though their clothes and belongings \nremain. You may not invoke this power again for the rest of the night. \nSANC~UINUS \nThe unique Discipline of the Blood Brothers is a product of Tremere \nrituals and Tzimisce applications of Vicissitude that created the bloodline. \nSanguinus allows a Blood Brother to share various parts of his body with any \nother member of his circle. This Discipline is grotesque, to say the least. Many \nof its powers evoke mindless terror in mortals. Any human who witnesses the \neffects ofOctopodor Coagulated Entity must make a Courage Virtue Test against \na two-Trait difficulty or flee in nauseated terror. Sanguinus uses Empathy for \nretests as it requires the Blood Brother to have a certain degree of rapport with \nhis circlemates in order to function at maximum efficiency. Outsiders attempt- \ning to acquire the secrets of Sanguinus often find themselves at a disadvantage; \nmany of the powers do not function as well without circlemates. \nBASIC \nSAN~UINUS \nBrother’s Blood \nThe bond that each circle of Blood Brothers shares gives that circle a \nunique physical, spiritual and mental link. The blood of one is the blood of all. \nYou may exploit this link to heal the wounds that your brothers sustain, \nregardless of distance. \nTo use Brother’s Blood, spend a Blood Trait as if you were healing one of \nown wounds and declare which member of your circle you are healing. You may \nspend five Blood Traits over the course of several turns to heal a circlemate’s \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\naggravated wound. This Blood Trait expenditure counts against your per turn \nlimit, not your target’s. \nOctopod \nExpanding on the lessons of Brother’s Blood, you may now lend limbs or \nexternal organs toyour circlemates. This power is horrifying to watch, not only \nfor the effects on the recipient but for the effects on the donor. Experienced \nBlood Brother circles often leave their weaker members a safe distance outside \ncombat, and these individuals quickly come to resemble quadruple amputees \nas they pass their limbs to comrades in need. Octopod takes effect instantly and \nover any distance within line of sight; donated parts simply vanish from the \ndonor and appear attached to the recipient. \nTo lend a limb, eye or ear to a circlemate, spend a Blood Trait. The loaned \norgan appears at the end of the turn, manifesting wherever the recipient wants \nit to appear. This power imparts no means of additional attack. However, an \nextra ear or eye gives two bonus Traits for resolving perception-based chal- \nlenges for the appropriate sense; an extra arm gives two bonus Traits in close \ncombat, and an extra leg gives one bonus Trait for close combat and two bonus \nTraits for any balance-related challenge. You may call the limb back whenever \nyou wish. This power may only be used to lend external parts - \nyou may not \ngive away your brain or your heart. Any supernatural enhancements your limb \nhas, such as Feral Cluws or Fleshcrafted hooves, travel with it, as do any \nornaments or jewelry, but clothing stays with you. \nINTERMEDIATE \nSAN~UINUS \nGestalt \nThough you normally share a low-level mental bond with your circlemates, \nGestalt allows you to intensify this bond, giving your circle the equivalent of \na temporary hive mind. While this power is in effect, you do not actually \nbecome one, though you share thoughts and your will is strengthened by those \nof your comrades. \nTo activate Gestalt, every member of your circle must spend a Blood Trait. \nA member who does not possess Gestalt himself must also succeed in a Static \nMental Challenge against five Traits to join the link. If one member is unable \nor unwilling to spend the Blood Trait, the power does not take effect, though \nindividuals who fail the Mental Challenge do not destroy the entire link, just \ntheir own connection to it. Gestalt lasts for the rest of the scene, even if you or \nanother circle member are killed or rendered unconscious. \nWhile this power is ineffect, you enjoy several benefits. First and foremost, \nyou are all in telepathic communication, requiring no effort and no Trait \nexpenditure. Second, any circle member may sacrifice his action for the next \nturn in order to expend an Ability Trait, “giving” it to any other circle member \nwho can use it for a retest on a challenge taking place during the current turn. \nThird, any attempt to use any mind-altering Discipline on any circle member \nis resisted by the highest number of the appropriate Trait that any individual \nin the circle possesses, though the individual target must still bid his own Traits \nto resist. For example, if Leon has three Mental Traits and is the target of a \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDominate attempt, he must bid one of his own Mental Traits, but ties and \noverbids resolve against the 14 Mental Traits that Leon’s circlemate Rick has. \nWalk of Caine \nDrawing on your circle’s link at both the sanguine and the spiritual levels, \nyou may now increase the potency of your own vitae at the expense of a \ncirclemate. Most circles use this power when only one member is embattled, \ndonating the strength of their blood to him in order to allow him to perform \nfearsome physical feats or to heal massive wounds in a matter of moments. \nTo borrow a Generation Background Trait from a willing circlemate, make \na Static Mental Challenge against a difficulty of five Traits. If your target is \nunwilling to give up this Trait, this power fails. If he is willing but does not \nknow Walk of Caine himself, he must succeed in the same challenge. Walk of \nCaine lasts for the scene. \nYou may only borrow one Generation Trait from any one member of your \ncircle, and you may not reduce your own generation past fourth. If you borrow \na generation from a 13th-generation circlemate, he gains the Flaw: Fourteenth \nGeneration until the power wears off. You may not borrow a generation from \na circlemate who is already 14th generation. Any effects of your circle’s blood \nthat last past the end of the scene, including Embraces you perform or diablerie \nthat you commit or that is committed upon you, use your normal generation \nrather than your altered one. For example, if you are usually 10th generation \nbut reduce your generation to seventh and Embrace a childe, she will be 1 1 th \ngeneration, not eighth. \nADVANCED \nSAN~UINUS \nCoagulated Entity \nStepping beyond mere sharing of blood, flesh and minds, you and your \ncirclemates may now combine your very forms into one monstrous conglom- \neration of writhing muscle and jagged bone. While this makes you a likely \ntarget for any enemy attacks, you more than likely have the combined strength \nto shrug off most assaults as you shamble over any opposition. This power \nshould be overseen by a Narrator as its effects on the surrounding scenery and \nmortals are rather severe. It is recommended that you work out a Coagulated \nEntity’s Traits before play begins. \nEvery member of the circle who wishes to join the Coagulated Entity must \nbe in physical contact with one another and spend three Blood Traits, taking \nno other action for three turns, though only one participating member must \nknow this power in order to initiate the merge. At the end of the third turn, \nthe unholy melding is complete. The component character with the lowest \ngeneration controls the entity’s actions, though its actual generation is equal \nto that of the highest-generation member. \nA Coagulated Entity enjoys the combined Physical Traits and Mental \nTraits of all its members. However, it gains a number of Clumsy Negative \nPhysical Traits and Witless Negative Mental Traits each equal to half its total \nnumber of component characters, rounded up. Normal Social Traits are \nsubmerged, replaced by a number of Fearsome Social Traits equal to three times \nthe number of members. The entity’s Blood Pool holds 10 Blood Traits per \nmember, though per turn expenditure is determined by the entity’s generation. \nIts Disciplines are the highest level of any given Discipline that any circle \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmember has attained, so if one member has Advanced Potence, a second has \nAdvanced Fortitude and a third has Advanced Auspex, the Coagulated Entity \nhas Advanced Auspex, Fortitude and Potence. \nA Coagulated Entity may not be staked as it has too many hearts in \ninaccessible places. It has a normal range of health levels, plus two additional \nBruised health levels per component vampire past the first. This power’s effects \nlast until the end of the scene or until the entity is destroyed. \nTHAUMATURC~Y \nSabbat vampires have never practiced Thaumaturgy widely. The Tremere \nantitribu were hardly numerous, even at the height of their power, and their \nrecent disappearance nearly destroyed the sect’s magical capabilities. The sect \nno longer has an organized group willing to provide rituals, instruction, \nresearch or support. \nThis is not to say that the Sabbat has lost all thaumaturgical knowledge \n- \nfar from it. Many pack priests and Black Hand members practice the arts of \nblood magic for their general value. Many vampires who follow the Paths of \nCaine and Death and the Soul see Thaumaturgy as one more method of \nfurthering their respective goals and studies. Several bloodlines, most notably \nthe Tzimisce kolduns and the Serpents of the Light, have made attempts to \norganize and combine their knowledge, though no one group has yet matched \nthe degree of proficiency that the Tremere antitribu displayed. \nThe following material is a collection of Sabbat-specific Thaumaturgy. \nWhile some outside of the sect will undoubtedly have learned or stolen these \npractices, such instances are more exceptions than rules. Thus, Storytellers \nshould feel perfectly within their rights to deny any non-Sabbat character access \nto these paths and rituals. Most are products of Tremere antidm research that \ntook place after the bloodline split from its parent clan, though some are \nadaptations of arts that predate the Sabbat’s inception. Camarilla Tremere are \nfamiliar with the existence, capabilities and appearances of most of the following \ntechniques (Static Mental Challenge to recognize a “competing brand” of \nThaumaturgy as not from the character’s own sect, difficulty of seven Traits, must \nhave Basic Thaumaturgy to recognize paths and a level of ThaumatuTgy equal to \nthat of a ritual to recognize it). Anyone who is foolish enough to display such \npowers in Camarilla circles comes under a great deal of unpleasant scrutiny. \nMechanically, these paths and rituals work in the same manner as “com- \nmon” Thaumaturgy and use the basic rules on page 176 of Laws of the Night. \nTHF PATH \nOE MARS \nUnlike the Camarilla Tremere, the Tremere antitribu were never at liberty \nto pursue pure research in blood magic - \nall of their work was applied toward \ntheir sect’s goals. This path, one of the first developed after the Sabbat’s \nformation, is a directly martial one, which sets it apart from many utilitarian \npaths that happen to have martial applications. It is also a highly personal path \nas its user focuses the effects internally rather than externally, and no two \nstudents of the Path of Mars approach it with exactly the same attitude. \nPractitioners of this path tend to be adept at close combat and often comple- \nment it with knowledge of H a d  ofDestruction (Laws of the Night, p. 183). \nPath of Mars uses the Occult Ability for retests. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBASIC PATH \nOP MARS \nWar Cry \nThe first technique you learn is that of focusing your will to fight. This \nenhances your courage and renders you less susceptible to mind-altering \neffects. However, this artificial strengthening of your will locks your emotions \naway from you while it is in effect, rendering you cold and distant. You activate \nthis power with some symbolic gesture or outcry, be it howling a Rebel yell, \nmurmuring a quickmeditative chant, donning astripe ofwar paint or inflicting \nsuperficial cuts on your face and chest. \nFor the duration of the scene, your Courage is increased by one Trait, and \nyou automatically win all ties on Mental Challenges when resisting hostile \nDiscipline effects. However, you are too focused on fighting - \nand winning \n-to consider others’ feelings, and you gain the Negative Social Trait Tactless \nwhile under War Cry’s influence. \nStrike True \nOnce you have learned to harden your will and subvert all weakness, you \nbegin to gain the unity of purpose necessary to ignore all obstacles. This \ntechnique allows you a momentary flash of clarity as you strike an opponent, \nusing your magic to enhance your perceptions and reflexes. Some thaumaturges \ninvoke this power with a martial artist’s kiai or a fencer’s dramatic flourish, \nthough others attack with perfect silence and no wasted motion. \nInvoke this power when making a close combat (bare hands or a melee \nweapon) attack before you make the challenge. You gain one free retest on this \nattack alone. You may not make any other attacks this turn, though you can \nuse multiple actions normally (to move or to ready a weapon, for instance). \nINTERMEDIATE \nPATH \nOE MARS \nWind Dance \nThe clarity of vision that you learned to apply to your own attacks with \nStrike True can now be used to discern the strikes that others make against you. \nThough this grants you no supernatural knowledge of attacks that you are not \naware of, you are much more able to evade those that you can see coming. If \nyou have a “signature” invocation that you use to activate War C v ,  you may \nwell have a corresponding one for this power as well. \nOnce you have activated Wind Dance, you gain two extra Dodge Ability \nTraits for the duration of the scene (which may exceed your generation limits \non Ability Traits in any one Ability). You may only activate Wind Dance once \nper scene and these Traits disappear if you do not spend them by the end of that \nscene -you \nmay not “stack” multiple applications of Wind Dance. \nFearless Heart \nThis technique reaches beyond mere tricks of perception to subtly \nenhance your physical form. Though not as potent as the combat transforma- \ntions of Disciplines such as Vicissitude, the advantage of Fearless Heart is that \nits application is largely undetectable. As with WindDance, many thaumaturges \nwho employ this power summon it with more complex variations of the \ninvocations they use for War Cry. \nOnce you have activated Fearless Heart, you gain the Physical Traits \nStalwart, Quick and Enduring for the duration of the scene. You may not “stack” \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmultiple applications of Fearless Heart, but you may employ it in conjunction \nwith Wind Dance or other Discipline powers that give you additional Traits. \nADVANCED \nPATH \nOP MARS \nComrades at Arms \nRather than bestowing more complex boons, the pinnacle of the Path of \nMars allows you to share your benedictions with your packmates. You may \nbestow the effects of War Cry, Wind Dance or Fearless Heart upon any willing \nrecipient by touching her and spending the usual Blood Trait to activate the \npower in question. You may give any combination of these effects to any \nnumber of recipients as long as you spend one action and one Blood Trait for \neach power and each character. Roleplay this appropriately, especially if \nyour unique “style” for this path‘s lesser powers involves war paint or \nsuperficial injuries. All limitations for self-application of these powers also \napply when applying them to others (e.g. no multiple Wind Dance applica- \ntions on the same subject). \nTHE PATH \nOE THE EATHER’S VEN~EANCE \nThis path originated with the first Noddist Tremere antitribu. According to \ntheir claims, it is a blood magic method of directly manipulating the curse that \nGod placed upon Caine. However, most non-Noddist scholars of the Path of the \nFather’s Vengeance state that it is simply one more application of blood magic, \nalbeit with trappings that certainly make it look like a primal tie to the vampiric \ncondition and that the path‘s creators were probably inflating their own \nimportance. This path‘sstudy is a hot topic ofdebate among Sabbat thaumaturges, \nas some Noddists, Bahari and Unifiers believe that claiming mastery over Caine’s \ncurse is dangerously close to heresy - \nor an aspiration to apotheosis. \nMost Sabbat thaumaturges teach Path of the Father’s Vengeance with a \nverbal component. Invocation of any power requires the thaumaturge to speak \nthe portion of the Curse (or a related passage from T h  Book of Nod) that she \nis applying. There is no actual innate power in the words (though some \nthaumaturges claim otherwise); rather, they serve as a mnemonic focus to \nsteady the caster’s concentration. All powers from this path have a maximum \nrange of the distance at which the caster’s voice is audible without mechanical \nassistance. Apply common sense in determining this range - \ndon’t penalize \nthe character if the player has laryngitis. \nThese powers only affect Cainites. They have no effect on Cathayans, \nmortals, ghouls, Lupines or any other beings. Path ofthe Father’s Vengeance uses \nthe Occult Ability for retests, though it may use the specialized Ability of \nVampire Lore if the Storyteller so desires. \nBASIC EATHER’S VFN~EANCF \nZillah’s Litany \nYour blood, potent as it is now, will bond those who drink it, as you did, once a \nnight fur three nights. You will be the master. They will be your thrall, as youare mine. \nAccording to commonly accepted Cainite prehistory, Zillah was Caine’s \nwife. She was the first vampire besides Caine to undergo the blood bond as Caine \nused the harsh lesson that the Crone taught him to capture Zillah‘s eternal love. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe passages from The Book of Nod that deal with this incident serve as a \nmnemonic device to focus your concentration, allowing you hazy impressions of \nany blood bonds or Vinculi to which your target might be subject. \nTo apply Zillah’s Litany, you must speak the passages in question to your \ntarget. Make a SimpleTest for eachvampire to whom your subject is connected \nby blood bond or Vinculum. On a tie, you gain a hazy impression of the \nindividual’s face. If you win, you gain a face and the name by which the subject \nknows that individual, as well as a hazy psychic impression. A Narrator will \nmost likely have to arbitrate this power’s effects as your subject may not be \naware of all her Vinculi. \nThe Crone’s Pride \nAndCainecoulddonothingbutstareintoherancienteyes,desireherleathery skin. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe Crone is the mythic-historic figure who taught Caine the power of \nthe blood bond by subjecting him to it. According to The BookofNod, she was \na creature of loathsome visage, horrifying to gaze upon and undesirable by even \nthe coarsest standards. To apply a similar appearance to your target, you must \nrecite a description of the Crone to her and defeat her in a Mental Challenge. \nIf you win, she receives the Nosferatu clan disadvantage for the rest of the \nnight, including the Negative Social Traits Repugnant x 3. She may not bid the \nSocial Traits that are banned for Nosferatu (Alluring, Gorgeous or Seductive), \nnor do they count toward her total Social Traits for ties and overbids. \nINTCRMFDIATC EATHER’S VFNgEANCF \nFeast of Ashes \nYou will drinkonly blood. You willeat only ashes. You will bealways as you were \nat death. \nWith this power, you may invoke the final curse that God laid upon Caine, \ntwisting your subject’s hunger so that blood no longer sustains him. For the \nduration of this power, he gains no sustenance from vitae, but instead must \nconsume ash for nourishment. \nMake a Mental Challenge against your target. If you win, expend a \nnumber of Mental Traits. This is the number of nights during which he gains \nno Blood Traits from drinking blood. Instead, for every handful of ash he \nconsumes, he gains one Ashen Blood Trait, which he may only expend to heal \nnon-aggravated damage or to satisfy his normal nightly sustenance require- \nment. This may be any sort of ash: cigarette butts, the leavings of a campfire \nor even the remains of a vampire who has met Final Death. \nUriel’s Disfavor \nThen, for as long as you walk this earth, you and your children will fear the \ndawn, and the sun’s rays will seek to burn you like fire where ever you hide always. \nPurists argue that this power’s proper name should be “Raphael’s Disfa- \nvor,” as it was that angel, not Uriel, who cursed Caine in such a fashion. \nNevertheless, the current appellation remains. A victim of this power is \nafflicted with a vastly heightened sensitivity to any sort of light, even artificial \nsources that are normally harmless to most Cainites. \nMake a Mental Challenge against your target. If you win, she gains Uriel’s \nDisfavor for the rest of the scene. You may spend a Willpower Trait after \nwinning the challenge to extend this to the rest of the night. While under the \neffect of this power, the subject gains the Negative Mental Trait Oblivious \nwhen in the presence of any light source brighter than a single candle. Worse \nyet, she sustains one level of aggravated damage for every turn that she is \ndirectly exposed to any bright light, such as a halogen flashlight, automobile \nhigh beams or nightclub strobes (Storyteller’s discretion; a good rule of thumb \nis any light that would make you go “ouch!” if you looked directly into it from \nthree yards or less). \nADVANCED \nEATHER’S VEN~EANCE \nValediction \nSeek not the blood of thine own Elder. Seek not the blood of thy Sire’s Sire. Seek \nnot the blood that made thee Kin. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThough many Sabbat consider diablerie a sacrament or a duty, such \nbehavior is in direct opposition to one of the few dictates that Caine \nsupposedly laid down. The mere threat of Valediction is enough to give pause \nto those who are familiar with it. By invoking Caine’s law against diablerie, you \ncan strip all the benefits of that act from your victim. \nYou must spend three turns to speak the entire invocation of this power. \nOn the third turn, make a Mental Challenge against your victim. If you \nsucceed, spend any number of Willpower Traits. For that many nights, the \nsubject returns to the generation she possessed at the time of her Embrace. She \nimmediately loses access to all Traits that are in excess of her generation \nmaximum (Storyteller’s discretion as to which specific Traits the victim loses \nin each category). Her Blood Pool likewise shrinks; if she has more Blood Traits \nin her system than she can currently hold, she is unable to initiate any actions \nuntil she has finished vomiting up the excess blood at the rate of one Blood \nTrait per turn. If this shift in generation changes her access to high-level \nDisciplines, she is temporarily stripped of those powers. \nTHAUMATUR~ICAL \nRITUALS \nMost Sabbat-taught rituals, whether sect-specific or commonly known, \nare couched in some sort of pseudo-religious ceremony. Many require a certain \namount of paraphernalia and elaborate incantations. Physical components \nalso tend to be unsettling to mortal sensibilities; body parts of humans or \nanimals are common, as are rare or precious substances and body fluids. \nThese rituals use the same systems as those in Laws of the Night (p. 185). \nBlood Rush \nWith this ritual, you may experience all of the pleasure of feeding with \nnone of the business of the hunt. This is particularly useful in staving off hunger \npangs or preparing to deal with large quantities of spilt blood. While affected \nby Blood Rush, you gain one free retest to avoid frenzying over hunger or the \nsmell or sight of blood. Blood Rush uses the fangs of a predatory animal as a focus, \nand you must carry these for the ritual to work. It lasts until the next sunset. \nDominoe of Life \nDominoe of Life allows you to assume one physical characteristic of \nmortality: normal human temperature, an appetite for solid food, automatic \nrespiration or a pulse and a normal flesh tone. You may only replicate one of \nthese features per casting, though you may “stack” them multiple times. \nDominoe ofLife requires you to carry a small vial of mortal blood on your person \n(at least 1/4 of a Blood Trait). It lasts until one hour after dawn. \nBASIC THAUMATURC~ICAL \nRITUALS \nEyes of the Night Hawk \nThrough this ritual, you may transfer your perceptions into the body of a \npredatory bird. Until dawn breaks or you end the ritual, you see with the \nraptor’s eyes rather than your own. You may exert no influence over the bird \nother than controlling its flight and its gaze-commanding \nit to attack a target \nor pickup an object is beyond your grasp (though it will follow its own instincts \nif it sees food or a threat). \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nExcept for the behavioral restrictions mentioned above and the means of \nending the ritual, the effects of Eyes of the Night Hawk simulate those of \nSubsume the Spirit (Laws of the Night, p. 135). Your raptor has the Physical \nTraits Energetic, Quick x 2 and Resilient. You may only use Auspex through it. \nTo end the ritual, you must touch the bird. You must also put out its eyes \nwithin one minute of ending the ritual or suffer blindness for three nights (note \nthat such an act may cause a crisis of ethics, depending on your particular \nMorality). Some enterprising thaumaturges ghoul their raptors in order to \nproduce reusable subjects who can regenerate their eyes over time. If you do not \nvoluntarily end Eyes of the Night Hawk, it expires at sunrise and you face the \nnormal consequences of not blinding your avian surveillance device. \nIlluminate Trail of the Prey \nBy invoking the spirits of air and earth, you may command them to reveal \nthe trail of an individual who you now pursue. Whether she is traveling on foot, \non a mount or in a vehicle, your eyes perceive the path she took as a series of \nfaintly glowing silver footprints. Your quarry is unaware that you are tracking her \nin such a manner unless she has some magical warning mechanism. Her trail will \nend at the first body of water through which she passes (though passing Over it \nhas no effect). The ritual's effects only last as long as you are directly on the trail \n-if \nyou stop tracking to feed, sleep or make a phone call, the footprints fade. \nTo enact this ritual, you must have astarting point from which to work and \nyou must know your target's true face. While reciting your invocation of the \nappropriate spirits, you must burn a six-foot length of white satin ribbon \nwrapped around a bone from the leg of a predatory mammal. When the ribbon \nis reduced to ash, the trail appears before you. This is not a foolproof method \nof tracking as the spirits this ritual commands are weak and capricious, but it \ndoes give you three free retests on attempts to track your quarry (most often \nusing the Investigation or Survival Abilities). \nMachine Blitz \nFor the most part, Thaumaturgy is hardly technological in nature, but this \nritual stands as one of the rare exceptions to that rule. Through Machine Blitz, \nyou may increase the level of chaos within a mechanical device to the point \nthat it breaks down under the weight of its own complexity. This ritual can be \nused to affect any single machine more complex than a rope-and-pulley, \nincluding both mechanical and electronic devices. \nTo inflict Machine Blitz, spend one minute tracing a series of incorrect \nmathematical equations on the surface of the target device. For this, you must \nuse a pencil-sized wand made of a bone from a mortal who was killed in a \nmechanical accident. If you successfully cast the ritual, the machine instantly \nstops working through what appears to be a normal system failure. A skilled \nrepairman (a number of Repair or appropriate Crafts Ability Traits equal to \nyour number of Occult Ability Traits) can restore the target to function with \na Static Mental Challenge against a difficulty of your Mental Traits. \nRecure of the Homeland \nThis ritual, which many Sabbat believe to be a Tzimisce innovation, \nallows you to create a muddy paste which can assist you in healing even the \nmost devastating wounds. To prepare one dose, mix one handful of earth from \nthe area of your mortal birth with two of your own Blood Traits. The resulting \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\npaste (assuming you succeed in casting the ritual) instantly heals one level of \naggravated damage when you smear it on the wound (or consume it, in the case \nof internal injuries). You may make any amount of this paste, as long as you \nhave sufficient supplies of earth and blood, but you may only use it to heal one \nHealth Level per night. Once you cast the ritual, the blood you use becomes \npart of the curative substance and is no longer considered blood for game \npurposes. Only you may benefit from the properties of this paste- to any other \ncharacter, it is simply a glob of reddish mud. \nWidow’s Spite \nBy constructing a small ceremonial doll, you may inflict a distracting itch \nor ache on a target. This ritual holds little actual danger for its subject. Many \nSabbat use it as a practical joke or a message of contempt, though some intrepid \nthaumaturges utilize Widow’s Spite to probe a potential victim’s defenses in \npreparation for a more devastating magical attack. \nYou must construct the doll yourself, and it must bear at least a vague \nresemblance to your target (no test required, but roleplaying this construction \nis encouraged). When you cast the ritual, the doll oozes a few drops of blood \nfrom the location that you want to afflict with the distracting sensation. If the \nritual succeeds, the target receives the Negative Mental Trait Witless for the \nrest of the night. You may re-use the doll if you so desire, though it falls apart \nafter the second time you fail in casting the ritual. \nINTERMEDIATE \nTHAUMATUR~ICAL \nRITUALS \nClinging of the Insect \nThrough this ritual, you may imbue yourself with a mystical property of \nadhesion that mimics an insect’s ability to climb vertical surfaces. Spend five \nminutes performing stretching exercises, then place a live spider under your \ntongue. You may then move on walls and ceilings at half your normal walking \nspeed. This lasts for the rest of the scene or until the spider dies or leaves its \nplace under your tongue. While keeping a live spider pinned under your \ntongue, you are down three Traits on any Social Challenge that requires you \nto speak well. Naturally, you should simulate the spider through Narrator \nnotification or candy rather than using a real one. \nFirewalker \nThough no vampire in his right mind ever plans to come in contact with \nopen flame, this ritual allows you to prepare yourself for situations where such \nan event might occur. To enact Firewalker, cut off one of your big toes (which \nhurts like hell and inflicts one level of lethal damage) and bum it over a wood \nfire, then smear the resulting ashes on the soles of your feet and the palms of \nyour hands. For the next hour, make a Simple Test for each level of aggravated \ndamage you take from fire. If you win or tie, that level of damage becomes lethal \ndamage. You may cast this ritual on another vampire, in which case you must \nsacrifice one of your beneficiary’s toes. Multiple subjects’ toes may be sacrificed \nsimultaneously in the same group ritual, up to a maximum number of subjects \nequal to your number of permanent Mental Traits. A character who is missing \na big toe gains the Negative Physical Trait Clumsy due to the effect this loss has \non his balance. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMirror of Second Sight \nUnlike most rituals, whose effects are short-lived, Mirror of Second Sight \nallows you to create a permanently enchanted item. You may imbue any \ncircular mirror between four and 18 inches in diameter with the property of \nreflecting an individual’s supernatural nature, if any, superimposed over her \nmundane image. To do this, you must etch the back of the mirror with a series \nof mystic sigils and bathe it in two of your own Blood Traits. \nOnce you successfully enchant the mirror, its reflections reveal all \nsupernatural creatures for what they are. Vampires appear as skeletal husks of \ntheir physical selves, werewolves are shown simultaneously as men and beasts, \nghosts are visible as misty outlines, changelings are masked with their faerie \nfaces and mages bear luminescent auras. Mortals still look like mortals, \nhowever; this mirror will not detect a ghoul or a human who practices lesser \nsorcerous arts. Additionally, this mirror only reveals the “true forms” of \nindividuals who are visible to the unaided eye - \nit does nothing to pierce \nObfuscate or any other supernatural means of concealment save for showing \nimages of ghosts who are normally invisible in the physical world. \nADVANCED \nTHAUMATURC~ICAL \nRITUALS \nPaper Flesh \nThis fearsome ritual allows you to strip avampire of most of his supernatu- \nral resilience, leaving him as defenseless as an ordinary mortal. However, you \nmust know his mortal birth name, which is much harder to learn of paranoid \n(or senile) elders than it is of innocent neonates. \nToenact Pupr Fksh, sketch yourtarget’sface onasheetofunblemished white \npaper, using one Blood Trait of your own blood for ink (Static Physical Challenge \nagainst a difficulty of the subject’s Social Traits, retest with an appropriate Crufts \nAbility). Then write his birth name across the image’s forehead in black ink and \ncut the image’s throat witha silver dagger. For the rest of the night, the subject loses \nany Fortitude he may have had except for Endurance, as well as all of the following \nPhysical Traits: Enduring, Resilient, Robust, Rugged and Tirekss. \nIf your target is a vampire who is of seventh generation or greater, he may \nretain one additional level of Fortitude and two of the affected Physical Traits \nfor every generation he is above eighth. For instance, a sixth-generation target \nwould retain both Basic Fortitude powers, the first Intermediate Fortitude power \nand four of the affected Physical Traits (assuming he had these powers and \nTraits to begin with). \nVALFRFN \nThe Salubri untitriibu claim that Vuleren is one of their former clan’s oldest \nsecrets, a Discipline of mystic martial prowess that the non-Sabbat Salubri \nperverted into a weakling’s healing tool. Saulot, they claim, was a holy warrior, \nand they remain true to his heritage by practicing Valeren. \nWhile this Discipline has some features in common with Obeah, the \nDiscipline of the Salubri, it is its own distinct series of lessons, and its practitio- \nners tend to regard it as one of their foremost weapons for their sacred battles. \nLike Obeah, Vuleren does have a physical manifestation in the form of a third eye, \nwhich appears on any Vuleren practitioner’s forehead when he learns the first \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nIntermediate level of the Discipline. This eye’s exact purpose is unclear. Some \nbelieve it is a mark of favor or disfavor from various infernal or divine powers, \nwhile others (including most of the Salubri antihibu) say it gives Vakren’s \npractitioners sight beyond sight. Vakren uses the Awareness Ability for retests. \nBASIC VALEREN \nSense Vitality \nThis power functions exactly as the Obeah power of the same name (Laws \nAnesthetic Touch \nThis power functions exactly as the Obeah power of the same name (Laws \nof the Night, p. 158). \nof the Night, p. 159). \nINTERMEDIATE \nVALEREN \nBurning Touch \nIn a grim parody of the legends of saints’ healing touches, you may lay \nhands on an individual to inflict excruciating pain. This power does no actual \ndamage, but the subject feels as if he is being burned, flayed, impaled, \neviscerated, dissolved or experiencing whatever other sensation you care to \ninflict. Some Salubri antihibu use Burning Touch as an interrogation tool while \nothers simply apply it out of sadism. When you apply Burning Touch, your third \neye glows with a dim, flickering red-orange light. \nTo apply Burning Touch, simply touch your victim and expend a Blood \nTrait. If you apply this power in combat, your victim suffers the penalties for \nbeing at the Wounded state of health for the rest of the turn. If he is already \nWounded, he must defeat you in a Mental Challenge or suffer the effects of \nbeing Incapacitated for the rest of the turn. \nIf you use Burning Touch as an interrogation tool, you or your fellow \ninterrogators gain one free retest on the next interrogation- or torture-related \nchallenge you make against that individual. Recreational applications of this \npower are best left to roleplaying. \nEnding the Watch \nThis power allows you to visit euthanasia upon a willing mortal. By simply \nlaying your hand over your subject’s heart, you may release her from the trials \nand turmoil of earthly existence. \nTo End the Watch, touch your victim and spend a Willpower Trait. The \nmortal must actively want to die; if she has any doubts about this desire, the \npower fails to work. However, if death is truly what she yearns for, her soul \ninstantly flees her body. A mortal killed with this power may not be Embraced, \nbecome a wraith after death or have any form of Necromancy work on her soul \nor body. Medical or mystic examination will reveal the cause of her death to \nbe sudden heart failure. Ending the Watch will only kill an ordinary mortal with \nno supernatural qualities - \nit has no effect on werewolves, changelings, \nwizards, ghosts, ghouls, mummies or any other supernatural being. \nADVANCED \nVALEREN \nVengeance of Samiel \nBy invoking the legacy of your line’s distant progenitor, the legendary holy \nwarrior Samiel, you may strike with the devastating precision that he devel- \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\noped over centuries of battle. Vengeance of Samiel is an exhausting power to \ninvoke, but its effects are unparalleled. Your third eye flares wide open when \nyou invoke this power, emitting a hellish red glare, and you may close your \nnormal eyes with no penalty to this attack. \nYou may only use Vengeance of Samiel when you are making an attack with \nyour bare hands or a melee weapon and it is your only action for the turn. Spend \nthree Blood Traits to activate this power. You may not use Vengeance of Samiel \nto augment an attack you make with another Discipline (such as combat \nBonecrafting), though you may still use it with another attack-enhancing \nDiscipline power that does not generate the attack in and of itself (such as Feral \nClaws or Prowess). Add your Mental Traits to your Physical Traits for the attack \nchallenge, including bidding, tie resolution and overbidding. Your opponent \nmay not evade this attack by declaring a retest with the Dodge Ability. If the \nattack succeeds, it inflicts an additional two health levels of the appropriate type \nof damage. If you use Vengeance ofSamid in an attempt to stake an opponent, you \nmust win or tie only one Simple Test after the successful attack, as opposed to \nthe two that staking usually requires (Laws of the Night, p. 204). \nSUPERIOR \nVALEREN \nElder Valeren: Blissful Agony \nYou may visit agony on an enemy that makes the torture of BurningTouchpale \nin comparison. This searing pain persists even after you remove your hand, and it \nis intense enough to kill weak-willed mortals and drive Cainites into frenzy. \nTo inflict Blissful Agony on your victim, touch him, spend a Blood Trait \nand defeat him in a Mental Challenge. For the rest of the scene, your victim \nis considered to be Wounded for purposes of wound penalties. If his condition \nactually reaches Wounded, he is considered Incapacitated. \nIf you wish, you may inflict lethal damage on an opponent, though you \nmust maintain contact and spend one Blood Trait per health level to exercise \nthis option. A Cainite may make one Simple Test per health level you inflict \nin this fashion; if she wins, she negates the damage. This damage heals \nnormally for mortals, but vanishes at the next sunset for avampire. If you inflict \nmore health levels on a vampire than she has Willpower Traits, she must resist \nRotschreck against a difficulty of your Mental Traits. \nSUPERIOR \nVICISSITUDE \nElder Vicissitude: Chiropteran Marauder \nAlthough this form bears vague resemblance to the more familiar zulo or \nH m ' d F m  (Laws of the Night, p. 189), it is evenmore capable and terrifying. \nChiropteran Marauder allows you to assume the form of a horrid melding of \nhuman and bat forms. Your face gnarls into a hideous grimace while your arms \nshift into leathery wings bearing talons. \nTo take on this visage, spend three Blood Traits. You gain all the benefits \nof Horrid F m ,  as well as the ability to fly at speeds of up to 25 mph (Celerity \ndoes not increase this). You can carry aloft a maximum weight equal to that of \nyour own body in this altered form, though your flight is rather awkward if you \ndo so. You also possess bony claws at the end of your wings that have the same \neffect as Feral Claeos (Laws of the Night, p. 169). You are down two Trait on \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nall perception-related challenges that deal with hearing but gain one bonus \nTrait on any vision-based challenges that deal with wits or perception. This \nform remains in effect for the scene once you invoke it. \nElder Vicissitude: Blood of Acid \nThis power’s effects are exactly what its name suggests. You have perma- \nnently converted your vitae into a powerful organic acid. While this limits your \npotential applications of it, it also serves as a final line of defense against \ndiablerie, as well as posing a formidable hazard to anyone who would engage \nyou in close combat. \nEach Blood Trait of yours that comes in contact with something other \nthan you inflicts two levels of aggravated damage to that item or individual. \nAnyone who actually ingests your vitae receives four levels of aggravated \ndamage per Blood Trait she drinks. This makes the creation of progeny or \nghouls rather difficult and unpleasant, though not completely impossible. \nEvery time a penetrating attack injures you in close combat (stake, claws, \nsword, or any gunshot at five feet or less), make a Simple Test. If you win, you \nlose one BloodTrait of your vitae as it sprays toward your attacker. She, in turn, \nmust make a Static Physical Challenge against a difficulty of five Traits. If she \nloses, she takes one level of aggravated damage (damage is lessened due to the \ndispersed spray). \nThis acid also affects any weapon or object that enters your body. Make \na Simple Test every time this happens. A wooden object will be corroded to \nuselessness within five minutes if you win or tie while a metal or plastic item \nsuffers the same fate on a win. Individuals who stake you are in for an \nunpleasant surprise as the concentration of vitae in your heart dissolves the \nstake in five turns (15 seconds). \nIf you assume Bloodform (Laws of the Night, p. 189), your blood only \ndissolves what you wish it to dissolve. Use this effect carefully as you may find \nyourself reacting away to nothingness if you decide to dissolve your way \nthrough the floor. \nMaster Vicissitude: Cocoon \nMany ancient Tzimisce use Cocoon to sleep away the ages in safety and \ncomfort. This power allows you to extrude an opaque cocoon from various \nbodily fluids, spinning it around yourself like the chrysalis of a vampiric \nbutterfly. The cocoon solidifies within a few minutes and vaguely resembles a \ntough, fibrous coffin. \nTo spin your Cocoon, spend three Blood Traits and 10 minutes. It lasts as \nlong as you wish, and you may emerge from it at no cost or effort. The cocoon \nblocks sunlight, and is somewhat flame-retardant, negating the first two health \nlevels of damage per turn that you would otherwise sustain from fire. Any \nattacker making a physical strike against you must first defeat the cocoon’s \nstrength in a Static Physical Challenge against a difficulty of twice your \nnumber of Physical Traits. While within your Cocoon, you may still use mental \nDisciplines so long as you can meet the requirements (eye contact is right out \nunder most circumstances). \nAscendant Vicissitude: Breath of the Dragon \nYour mastery of your own flesh and blood is such that you can vomit forth \nyour vitae even as you convert it to a highly combustible fluid that ignites in a \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nhellish flame as it leaves your mouth. You may purse your lips to direct this fire \nagainst one target or open your mouth wide to spray flaming droplets over an \narea. You are immune to this flame though not to secondary fires that it starts. \nTo attack a single target, spend a Blood Trait and defeat him in a Physical \nChallenge. If you win, he sustains three levels of aggravated damage and bursts \ninto flame. In the next turn, he suffers an additional two levels of aggravated \ndamage, and one more each subsequent turn until he extinguishes the flame or \nperishes. Youmay strikeanindividualat amaximumrangeof 100 feet (30steps). \nIf you wish to incinerate an area, spend five Blood Traits. You may center \nthe blast on any point in your line of sight that is within 100 feet (30 steps) of \nyou. The radius of effect is 20 feet. Everyone within that area receives two levels \nof aggravated damage. All flammable objects within the area are ignited. Any \nvictims must succeed in a Static Physical Challenge against a difficulty of five \nTraits to avoid being set afire as well; this does one additional aggravated health \nlevel per turn, as does remaining within the burning area on subsequent turns. \nMethuselah Vicissitude: Earth’s Vast Haven \nThis power hails from the time when the childer of Tzimisce were the \nundisputed masters of Eastern Europe, calling upon the line’s strange bond to \nthe earth of their ancestral homeland. It allows you to become one with your \nvery domain, spreading your vitae, physical form and consciousness through- \nout all that you survey. You are virtually invulnerable in this form - \nnothing \nshort of an explosion powerful enough to leave a mile-wide crater can harm you \nin any meaningful manner, and sunlight on your soil does nothing but \nstimulate plant growth. \nTo enter Earth’s Vast Haven, spend six Blood Traits. You sink into the \nground in a manner that is visually similar to that of EurthMeld. However, your \nform is spread throughout the ground in an approximate three-mile radius to \na depth of six feet. While in Earth’s Vast Haven, you require no blood for \nsustenance. You may exercise your mental Disciplines on anyone within your \narea of dispersion, as long as you may maintain the other requirements (eye \ncontact is impossible, but anyone who is standing on bare earth within your \narea is assumed to be in physical contact with you). You may also initiate direct \nmental contact with anyone within this area at any time, using the rules for \nTelepathy (Laws of the Night, p. 138). You theoretically have complete \nawareness of all that transpires within your area of existence, though in \npractice your mind tends to wander when inhabiting such a vast space. If you \ndecide to emerge from Earth’s Vast Haven, you may re-form your normal body \nat any point within the power’s area of effect. \nIf nuclear weapons are used on the area in which you reside (the only \npractical means of killing you available to modem technology), you suffer one \nto three levels of aggravated damage per explosion. You may not heal this \ndamage until you leave Earth’s Vast Haven. The explosions must be on or under \nthe ground in order to harm you - \neven the most powerful air burst won’t \ndisplace enough earth to do more than annoy you. Obviously, the effects of \nnuclear weapons are difficult enough to simulate in a live-action setting that \nthey should remain plot devices. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRITAF \nThe Sabbat has another side, one that contrasts the bloodthirsty faGade \nthat the average Cainite of any stripe sees - \nthat of its spirituality. The ritae, \nor rites, remind believers of their common goals, reward them for success and \npunish them for failure. Regular performance of the ritae keeps pack members \nin harmony (or something like it) and focused on their goals. \nThere’s no sect-wide standard for formality. Storytellers should decide on \nthe tone they want for their chronicles and flesh out the ritae accordingly. If \nyou want to go for the grand ceremonial feel, appropriate props and music can \nmake a big difference. Even a couple of candlesticks, an altar cloth and a tape \nof Gregorian chants go a long way toward evoking the sense of a chapel \ndedicated to dark deeds. \nSabbat spirituality - \nand no, that’s not a contradiction in terms - \nisn’t \ntied to one single culture. Even the stodgiest cardinals reluctantly admit, the \ntruths the Sabbat proclaims don’t require that members practice a medieval \nBlack Mass. A Sabbat ceremony might look like a gang hanging out, a \ncorporate board meeting or a blood-cult pagan gathering. Beneath it all there’s \nthe same set of doctrines. As long as orthodoxy prevails in action, most bishops \ndon’t fuss too loudly about how packs celebrate. \nPomp, circumstance and abused liturgical Latin can convey a mystic \nsense, but there’s a risk of turning into gratuitous blasphemy. Only a monster \nwould trample someone’s real religious beliefs for the sake of a game. Keep the \ngame and life separate, and watch for danger signs that someone is taking his \npersonal intolerances out of one arena and into another. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPEREORMING \nTHE RITES \nIf you want priestly competence and power to matter in your chronicle, use \nthese optional rules. If you’d rather keep it simple, just use the standard rules \nfor tests associated with each rite. Again, these rules are strictly optional. \nWhen a priest embarks on a rite, he makes a Social Challenge against a \nnumber of Traits equal to the number of participants. When a bishop or higher- \nranked priest performs a rite with lower-ranked assistants, each assistant adds \none Trait to the lead priest’s Social Traits total. If the lead priest ties this test, \nparticipants receive no bonus or penalty during the rite. If the lead priest \nsucceeds, everyone adds one Trait per level of the priest’s Path rating to their \nown Traits for the purposes of tests. This bonus applies to all tests directly \nassociated with the ritm - \nduring Fire Dancing, for instance, it applies to a \nvampire’s Physical Trait total for jumping the fire but not to trying to establish \na psychic link to someone four blocks away. \nIf the priest fails the test, make two Simple Tests. If the priest wins at least \none of them, the rite unfolds as usual. Otherwise, all participants suffer a one- \nTrait penalty on all related tests - \nif the priest is spiritually impaired, how can \nhe hope to lead his followers appropriately? The priest has the option of \ncanceling the rite. This automatically imposes the Negative Status Trait \nUnfaithful, which the priest can remove only by successfully performing two \nauctmitas rim in the future. \nEveryone in the sect practices the auctontas ritae. Each one gives expres- \nsion to an important aspect of the Sabbat’s mission and goals, and their \nuniversal exercise binds members together. \nTHE \nBINDING \nOn the night of the winter solstice, Sabbat members gather for a public \nreaffirmation of their oaths to the sect. Just as the Vaulderie unites members \nof a pack, the Binding ties together all the oath-taking vampires in the \ncommunity. \nThe ceremony begins with a recitation of the group’s interpretation of the \nSabbat credo. Each group does this a little differently. Some work it out in \nliturgical form while others present each point in metaphorical language or in \nthe form of a parable. Military-style gatherings shout out the credo in call-and- \nresponse style. Sometimes the recitation takes an hour or occupies just a few \nangry sentences. \nFounded packs host nomadic packs, where possible, although the negotia- \ntions beforehand to allow safe passage seldom go smoothly (very few occasions \ncould encourage such mutual restraint). Tradition calls for performing the \nBinding near water - \na beach, riverbank or waterfall if possible, a fountain if \nthere’s nothing else. Water symbolizes the sect’s implacable determination, \neroding or flooding all opposition just as the Sabbat must in the end triumph \ncompletely. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nVaulderie and a separate oath to protect the sect’s secrets to Final Death \nalmost always follow the Binding. Major Sabbat war efforts also often begin at \nthe Binding, exploiting the unity of purpose the ritus creates. \nSystem: The Vinculum ratings of all participants in the ritus increase by \none (to a maximum of lo), and remain elevated for the next month. \nTHE \nBLOOD BATH \nSect leaders perform this ritus to confirm a vampire’s appointment to a \nbishopric or higher office. All Sabbat members who can attend the Blood Bath \ndo so; avoiding it unnecessarily may strike the new leader as an insult. Each \nparticipant in the ritus steps forward, kneels to the new leader, expresses praise \nfor or confidence in the recipient and offers blood into a common vessel. The \nleading priest acts first, followed by attending sect leaders and then by \neveryone else present. The vampire receiving the new title offers a response of \npraise or advice to each vampire present, emphasizing her wisdom and how she \nbenefits the Sabbat. He then bathes in the pool, and all participants drink from \nit. Sometimes the priest consecrates the pool as a Vaulderie, sometimes not. \nFervent Sabbat supporters often refuse to acknowledge leaders who \ncannot produce evidence of having undergone a proper Blood Bath. \nSystem: Each participant must contribute at least one Blood Trait. If the \npool is consecrated as a Vaulderie, follow the Vaulderie system. \nTHE \nBLOOD \nEEAST \nThe Blood Feast often accompanies other rim; in some cities, the bishops \ncelebrate this on its own. This ritus combines an opportunity for formal \ngathering with a stark celebration of vampires’ predatory natures. \nThe Blood Feast itself is the vampiric equivalent of a formal dinner. The \nguests dine on the blood of captured men and women suspended over a dining \ntable, bound to statues or otherwise immobilized. \nPreparations begin well before the feast. For several nights before the feast, \na specially constituted hunting party rounds up humans (and, when the \nopportunity arises, vampires outside the Sabbat). It’s an honor to be chosen to \ntake part in the hunt, and it takes great self-restraint to deliver the captured \nprey alive and as unharmed as possible. The hunters present their prey along \nwith demonstrations of martial prowess and boasts of their exploits to the \nhighest-ranking Sabbat member present. She receives each victim and gives \nthe vampire who brought the victim a kiss of thanks of the forehead. Vampires \nthen secure the prey safely until the night of the Blood Feast. \nOn the night of the feast, ghouls or low-ranking vampires arrange the prey \nat the Blood Feast’s location. The nature of the meal makes tardiness a grave \noffense against hospitality; guests arrive early or on time. The presiding official \ndedicates the prey to the glory of the Sabbat and the participants in the ritus. \nShe may deliver a Sermon of Caine at this time, depending on how self- \ncontrolled the participants are in the face of imminent feeding. The presiding \nofficial gets her pick of the vessels and draws first blood. Once she’s begun, the \nguests set in. \nTradition calls for a minimum of one vessel per three participants in the \nBlood Feast. Some groups favor more. The ratio depends partly on how tidily \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nor messily the participants feed. Some groups feed directly from the vessels \nwhile others drain the blood into champagne flutes or other containers. The \npresiding official may mandate a particular method of feeding or allow diverse \nstyles as she deems fit. \nThe priestly blessing at the beginning of the Blood Feast somehow \nintensifies the vessels’ blood as it leaves their bodies; it gains double normal \npotency. The Sabbat hierarchy appreciates the merits of the Blood Feast but \ncensures groups that engage in it too often. Too many kidnappings and gore- \nspattered meeting halls attract mortal attention even in thoroughly cowed \ncities. \nSystem: The priest’s ceremony at the start of theritus transforms the blood \nofvictims boundandpresentedfortheBloodFeast. EachBloodTraitofavessel \nso consecrated becomes two Blood Traits as it leaves the vessel’s body. \nVampires who drink the consecrated blood get the benefit of two Blood Traits \neven though it only occupies one Blood Trait’s worth of capacity in their own \nbodies. Participants in the Blood Feast generally feel unusually energetic; the \nextra blood can take them beyond their normal generational limits for vitae. \nAny doubled Blood Traits unspent at the end of the third night after the Blood \nFeast collapse back into single Blood Traits. \nCREATION \nRITES \nOutsiders assume that the Sabbat’s “shovel party” is the standard way of \nmaking new Sabbat members. The sect knows otherwise. The process is \ninefficient; a lot of victims don’t make it out. Many of those who do survive \nemerge permanently insane. \nNew recruits to the Sabbat don’t join as full members until they’ve proven \nthemselves in combat or intrigue. Until they complete the Creation Rites, \nthey’re on probation. They can be destroyed at any time for disobedience, \ncreating childer of their own or even for getting in the way of their elders. The \nprobation lasts at least for several days, often for weeks and goes on for years \nin areas with very strict leadership. A sire may require his childe to display her \nnewfound strength and nature by performing in a test of his choosing before he \nconsiders her ready for the rite. \nA priest administers the Creation Rites. She touches a flaming brand to \nthe initiate’s forehead and leads her in an oath of allegiance. The phrasing \nvaries; the key points include loyalty to one’s pack leader, to the chain of \ncommand and to the principles of the Sabbat as they’ve been taught to the \nrecruit. Once branded, the initiate becomes a true member of the Sabbat, with \nall the risks and benefits that implies. The priest follows the branding with a \nVaulderie. \nSires and packs often add celebrations or other rites of their own. Young \nurban packs perform gang-style initiations while dignified elders present their \nupper-class childer in formal gatherings. In their various forms, such supple- \nmental commemorations both congratulate the new recruit and remind her \nthat she is still at the bottom of the pile. \nSystem: The branding requires the new recruit to succeed in a two-Trait \nRotschreck test. A recruit who panics gets a second chance, albeit with a \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsubstantial stigma for cowardice. Failing the test a second time brings imme- \ndiate destruction. \nSee Laws of the Night, p. 224, for the shovel-party rules. \nSome bishops like to form new packs in a special version of the Creation \nRites. Each member of the pack-to-be gets drained and buried as if the victim \nof a shovel party, and must dig her way out. With the benefits of vampiric \nstrength, a vampire undergoing re-creation must win or tie two out of three \nSimple Tests with the Narrator (rather than having to win two out of three). \nLike a mortal in the same situation, the vampire can spend Physical Traits for \nretests. When (and if) all the members of the pack emerge, their designated \npriest brands himself and the other members of the pack and leads them in a \nVaulderie. Since there’s always the risk of losing vampires in this process, \nbishops in areas of active conflict or reduced numbers of members frown on the \npractice. \nTHE \nEESTIVAL OETHE DEAD \n(EESTIVO DELLO \nFSTINTO) \nThe Festival of the Dead occupies the entire second week of March; it’s \nsecond only to the Grand Ball as an opportunity for participants to celebrate \ntheir trans-human abilities. All the Sabbat vampires in a city gather, setting \naside usual disputes for the week of the Festival, and nomadic packs come into \ntown to celebrate with their urban brethren. \nThe Festival begins as soon as the highest-ranking priest in town declares \nit underway. He gives a single instruction to the assembledparticipants: Revel. \nThis i s  the time for vampires to set aside their normal restraints and find out \njust what they can do to themselves, to each other and above all to the mortals \naround them. Each night includes a Blood Feast and a celebration of the \nVaulderie after the night’s exertions, scheduled as late as possible given the \nneed of the participants to settle down for the day. \nIn principle, the Festival’s participants should act utterly without regard \nfor anyone’s concerns but their own. In practice, the world is still there even \nwhile vampires celebrate. The Sabbat uses the Festival partly to weed out the \nvampires who cannot distinguish between the freedom to choose their own \ncourse of action and consequences to their choices. Vampires who bring out \nmortal hunters or other supernatural beings in response to Festival behavior \ndeserve what they get, the sect’s teachers say. \nFestival events vary widely. Fire Dancing takes place almost everywhere, \noften coupled with dances pairing vampires with unwilling mortal partners. \nPacks whose members know Necromancy often raise zombies to provide \naccompaniment. In many cities, packs compete to present reenactments of \npassages from the Book of Nod and Sabbat history. Vampires who fancy \nthemselves great hunters set out on special hunts, going after specific sorts of \nvictims - \nteen mothers, bald priests, married computer programmers or some \nother specialized category of mortal. Vampires with experience in butchery, \nsurgery and the like oversee competitions to kill victims with a minimum of \nblood spilled or to remove of as many internal organs as possible while keeping \nthe victim alive and conscious. \nPresiding archbishops and bishops watch the various competitions and \naward victors with the right of drawing first blood at the next Blood Feast. In \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsome cases, aparticularly good performance wins the victor apromotion on the \nspot while an appalling failure may lead to demotion or to the loser becoming \none of the next Blood Feast’s vessels. Elders look with favor on competitions \nto hunt as widely and freely as possible without attracting mortal attention. \nSuccess in this sort of challenge requires developing and presenting a plausible \ncover story, such as a terrorist attack. The Sabbat hierarchy admires and \nrewards the ability to use mortal institutions without becoming tangled in \nmortal values or concerns like the Camarilla. \nSystem: Resolve the various competitions as seems appropriate. The \nFestival is as much an occasion for roleplaying as for number-crunching. Note \nthat many Festival sports require a fair number of Storyteller mortal characters, \nso plan ahead to have enough Narrator support. \nEIRE DANCE \nFire is one of the great enemies to vampire, a danger to flee. The Sabbat \nbelieves in mastering that fear. In times of war, Sabbat vampires use fire as a \nweapon against their enemies. In between battles, they perform the Fire Dance \nto show their triumph over the weaknesses in their souls. \nA priest can call a Fire Dance at any time, whenever she judges the pack \nin need of some morale boosting. Bishops generally celebrate a Fire Dance just \nbefore a War Party, bringing together all the packs who will fight in the \nupcoming assault. Given the Sabbat’s emphasis on individual freedom, the \nconvening priest never forces a vampire to take part in the ritus until she feels \ntruly ready for it. Most vampires somehow find the resolve to participate \nanyway; their packmates do not tolerate cowardice, and too many refusals of \nthe Fire Dance can get a vampire exiled or destroyed. \nThe convening priest lights a bonfire somewhere away from mortal eyes. \nParticipants set a rhythm with drumming, chanting or other regular music. \nThey circle the fire, working themselves into a trancelike frenzy. They close \nin on the flames until primitive instinct forces them away; some make \nobeisance to the fire as if it is a god they hate but still venerate. As each \nparticipant feels ready, she jumps through the flames. The more vampires make \nit through, the more they encourage (and challenge) the remaining partici- \npants to do so. Particularly devoted or entranced vampires jump again and \nagain; some perform the most exotic stunts along the way. The n’tus ends when \nevery vampire has jumped. \nSometimes a vampire simply can’t muster the courage to jump. Tolerant \npacks throw him through so as to honor the spirit of the occasion. Less tolerant \npacks slaughter him as an inferior breed or pin him down in the fire to help him \novercome his weakness. \nSystem: Once the fire’s started and the revels begin, participating vam- \npires must make a Courage test against two Traits to approach the fire. (Their \ntrance state reduces the normal difficulty.) Actually jumping through the fire \nrequires a Static Physical Challenge against five Traits. The Storyteller should \nincrease the difficulty of complex maneuvers; if they work, the participant \ngains one or more bonus Social Traits for the rest of the night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n4 \ni \nI \nAll participants who voluntarily leap through the fire get a bonus Courage \nTrait for the rest of the night and for three nights after that. This bonus can \nexceed the usual Virtue limit of 5. \nDo not, under any circumstances, actually go leaping through bonfires. Use \nyour imagination to capture a sense of the experience without the prop of real fire. \nThe Sabbat glorifies achievement. Thinking grand thoughts doesn’t mean \nanything without action. Therefore, the ceremonial demonstration of one’s \nphysical, mental and social prowess is a religious act. The label “Games of \nInstinct” applies to all competitions in which participants compete against each \nother and the surrounding world in ways that exemplify the Sabbat’s ideas. \nNote that Games of Instinct do not include random carnage for its own sake. \nThe Sabbat does not believe in the Masquerade as a goal, but sect leaders aren’t \nstupid and know that there are very firm limits to how far vampires can go \nwithout bringing down massive reprisals. The Sabbat does not value stupidity \nand won’t reward it, let alone treat it as a matter of spiritual importance. \nThe priest presides over each game, blessing the participants and instructing \nthem in the terms of this particular game. The practice should resemble the \nancient Olympic games in which participants demonstrated physical excellence \nas an act of worship. The games are vigorous, enthusiastic and often bloody, but \nnever frivolous. Holy joy in one’s superiority is far more than simple bloodthirst. \nSystem: The specific mechanical aspects of a Game of Instinct depend on \nthe nature of the game. All games share a specific feature. The winners of a \ngame get a one-Trait bonus to one Ability they used during the game. This \nbonus lasts for two weeks of game time. A vampire can only enjoy this benefit \nfor one Ability at a time, no matter how many games she participates in. \nC~AMFS OP INSTINCT \nSome examples of common Games of Instinct: \nCapture the Ductus. This game pits two packs against each other. The \npriest designates territory, generally a few square blocks. Each pack aims to \npresent the ductus of the other to the priest; the first pack to do so wins. \nInflicting Final Death on any participant automatically costs the destroyer’s \npack the game (plus the rage of the offended pack). The priest has discretion \nin setting boundaries for mortal awareness. Particularly challenging games \nrequire that no mortal ever know the game’s being played while other times, \nfor games of terror, the priest actively condones displays of vampiric power. \nThe Rat Race. At the beginning of the game, participants unleash one \nor more humans in a bounded, labyrinthine space -an actual maze, a factory \ndistrict or someplace else with complex terrain. The humans get piles of \nweaponry capable of actually hurting the vampires. Then the vampires go in \nunarmed and hunt the humans. Each vampire who drains a human wins. It’s \n“legit” to cripple or maim competing vampires, but not to torpor or destroy \nthem. A more extreme form of this game requires vampiric participants to draw \nstraws, with the one who gets the short straw becoming the designated victim. \nThe vampiric variety seldom proceeds to Final Death except as a punishment \n(in which the draw of straws is usually rigged). \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRousing theBeast. Eachparticipant must dig up avictimofafailedshovel \nparty. The participant must then immobilize and destroy his victim. Keep in \nmind that the victim emerges weak but in frenzy. The process of consecrating \ndisinterment as a rim somehow strengthens the victim, who regains one Trait \nper turn until at full strength and suffers half normal wound penalties. \nThe Spire. The priest designates some target to climb that human \nbeings cannot achieve without elaborate tools, such as the tallest skyscraper in \nthe area. The participants must scale it using only their own bare hands and \nfeet, their Attributes, Abilities and Disciplines. The first one to the top and \nback down wins. Climbing barehanded up modern buildings (stone, glass and \nmetal, etc.) requires a Simple Physical Test every 10 feet or so. The difficulty \nvaries, from six Traits for conveniently sized bricks up to 12 or more for sheer \nfeatureless walls. Using Disciplines stylishly doesn’t guarantee a win, but earns \nthe respect of competitors. \nC~RAND BALL (PALLA \nC~RANDC) \nThe Grand Ball - \nPalla Grande to Sabbat elders and others who like to \nretain a European flavor to their rim - \nmarks the end of the Sabbat’s year. On \nAll Hallows Eve, all the vampires in the city gather for a two-part celebration. \nSome archbishops summon all the vampires in their territory to celebrate in \nasingle city; others encourage separate celebrations in eachcity. In either case, \nattendance is not optional. Nomad packs converge on the nearest city holding \na Grand Ball. The most renowned priest in the city (who may not be the \nhighest-ranked) oversees the ritus. \nThe night before the Grand Ball, the presiding priest and her assistants \nprepare incense burners. The burners hold an exotic mix of herbs and \nchemicals designed to weaken mortals’ willpower and skepticism and induce \na mild hallucinogenic state in which acquiescence and belief come easily. As \nshe blesses each burner, the priest adds a Blood Trait of her own to start the \nmix’s transformation. \nThe first part of the Grand Ball takes place in public, often staged as a \nfestival, a rave or some other gathering open to the general populace. The \nBall’s vampiric hosts generally put on a fancy spread in whatever idiom they \nchoose, with the best music, plenty of free food and drink and so on. Almost \nall Grand Balls emphasize costumes, going beyond fancy wardrobe to include \nphysical transformation through Vicissitude and the illusions of Obfuscate and \nChimerstry . Eachvampiric participant in the ritus adds a Blood Trait of his own \nto one (or more) of the incense burners. The air takes on a very slight pink tinge \nand all mortals in the area experience a mild form of the surrender that comes \nwith the Embrace. \nThe second part of the Grand Ball takes place away from mortal eyes. The \npriest convenes a Blood Feast for the vampires of the area. Daring groups \nsnatch their vessels from the nearby crowd or from the unlucky recipients of \ninvitations to a “special private gathering” associated with the ball’s public \nface. Sabbat communities who face more serious challenges from hunters or \nwhose leaders believe in not creating unnecessary risks round up their victims \nfor weeks beforehand. Sabbat vampires, retainers and ghouls who’ve commit- \nted flagrant offenses also become vessels for the occasion. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAt midnight, individuals chosen by the presiding priest present a reenact- \nment of an event from Cainite legend or history. In some cities, would-be \nactors compete for the priest’s favor; in others, theatre duty is as much a \npunishment as a reward. Caine’s murder of Abel outstrips all other topics in \npopularity, with the diablerie of the Tzimisce and Lasombra Antediluvians \nclose behind. Gehenna scenes attract both favor and controversy, with some \nelders (and devout neonates) arguing that too much attention to future \ntroubles undermines morale. Most theatre groups include some element of \naudience participation, seizing prepared targets for use as disposable props. \nAfter the show, the archbishop or ranking bishop present receives the \nBlood Bath. The recipient reclines in a tub, pool or other large container. \nAttendants bleed out selected victims to fill the pool. Each vampire present \ncontributes vitae to a Vaulderie cup, whose contents then join the mortal \nblood. The recipient maintains a steady chanting all the while, and takes in a \nbit of the essence of the other participants. \nAt the conclusion of the Blood Bath, the participants join the bath‘s \nrecipient in a final pre-dawn dance, generally very noisy and almost always \nending in a frenzied attack on the unfortunate mortals saved for the consum- \nmation of the rim. In most cases, the participants collapse in the ball’s private \nspace and rely on ghouls to take care of guarding them and cleaning up during \nthe following day. Over the next several days, vampires and ghouls charged \nwith attending to the aftermath use a combination of lethal force, mental \nDisciplines and occasional Embraces to tidy up loose ends. \nSystem: Grand Ball participants gain the benefits of the Blood Feast and \nBlood Bath as usual. In addition, they completely replenish their Willpower. \nEach participant must contribute at least one Blood Trait to the cloaking \nincense burners, and may contribute more. The recipient of the Blood Bath \ncan make a Mental Challenge against any of the other participants; if she \nsucceeds, the recipient can use any oracular powers the target possesses, like \nAuspex and some Thaumaturgical Paths, as if they were her own for the night. \nShe does not gain fine control, seeingrandom moments of the coming year that \nwarrant her attention. The Storyteller should feel free to make the resulting \nimages symbolic and allusive, and to allow circumstances to render them null \nand void. \nMONOMACY \nThe Sabbat’s internal disagreements don’t always erupt into war, contrary \nto the popular opinion among outsiders. Most conflicts find fairly quick and \nfairly peaceful resolution, through a combination of actual persuasion, use of \nStatus and the occasional push with Disciplines. When two individuals can’t \nsettle a quarrel, often their authorities, starting with the pack leader and priest, \ncan. Sometimes all efforts at mediation fail. Monomacy provides the ultimate \nresolution: Combat to the death. \nMonomacy isn’t just a duel to the death. Through careful authorization of \nMonomacy, the Sabbat applies a limited form of evolutionary selection to its \nranks. The duels purge individuals who were too physically weak or too \ncrippled by bad ideas to make effective use of their abilities. The sect grows \nstronger as the weak and inefficient fall - \nbetter to lose them in an internal \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ndispute than to suffer them in crises to come. Strong leaders and strong \nfollowers keep the sect strong as well. \nMonomacy is a genuine rim, not a right anyone can claim on their own. \nThe Sabbat denies the opportunity to young, unproven recruits who don’t \nappreciate the gravity ofwhat they’re doing. If everyone could get their leaders’ \nblessings for the sacred duel, in short order most packs would lose all their \nmembers over trivial matters. The pack priest must formalize any effort at \nMonomacy. The challenger presents her claim to the priest and the target \nsimultaneously. The priest decides whether the point of conflict warrants \nMonomacy, and if so, whether the priest will preside himself or appoint a \nsubstitute. If the priest is himself the challenged party, the ductus presides or \nrefers it to another pack‘s priest. \nThe defender doesn’t have to accept just because the priest approves. \nDeclining involves some loss of status, since bystanders assume cowardice or \nsome shameful secret must contribute to the refusal to take part in an \nimportant ritus. The defender encounters fewer hassles if the challenger is of \nmuch lower rank. Leaders can brush off even genuinely serious claims as just \nanother case of a youngster being uppity. \nWhen the challenger and defender belong to the same pack, it’s easy to \npick the right authority to arbitrate: Their pack priest does the job. Matters get \nmore complex when the disputing parties belong to different packs. In theory, \na bishop should hear such cases. In practice, most bishops feel they have better \nthings to do with their time and respond unfavorably to all but the most urgent \nor illuminating claims. Rivals often do better to seek out the priest of a third \npack, preferably but not always one they both know, and ask him to perform \nthe ritus. \nThe definition of the ritus leaves the setting and method of combat open. \nAs long as it satisfies the participants and the overseeing priest, it’s fine. The \nchallenger sets the time and place; the defender rules on weapons and other \ndetails. The defender can ask for the duel to be to first blood rather than Final \nDeath. In such a case the loser faces exile. A defender who takes such a wimpy \ncourse of action loses respect whether he loses the duel or not. More impressive \nrestrictions include fighting while blindfolded, fighting surrounded by fire, \nfighting only with out-of-clan Disciplines and the like. The priest declares the \nduel begun and finished. Priests and archbishops can declare a Monomacy null \nand void, but doing so for any reason short of proof of direct cheating by a \nparticipant invites new Monomacy-worthy challenges against the priest. \nSometimes Monomacy takes on strange forms. Lasombra elders may \nchoose to duel with life-sized chessboard populated by living pieces, moved by \nthreat or command. A famous conflict between a Tzimisce and a Ventrue \nuntitribu ended in a Monomacy in which each took turns shooting one of the \nother’s ghouls. The Tzimisce won when the last of the Ventrue’s ghouls \nsuccumbed to his wounds and fell over. \nThe winner of the Monomacy gets his pick of the loser’s possessions. This \ndoesn’t include diablerie unless the priest approves it as a term of the contest. \nCustom suggests but doesn’t require offering a cut to the presiding priest. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAnything left over goes to the loser’s packmates and any scavengers who can \nstake a claim. \nMonomacy settles all sorts of serious disputes within the sect. Would-be \nducti, pack priests and bishops bring out their grievances (and generally lose). \nIndividuals contesting points of influence take it to a duel if their priest deems \nthe issue important to Sabbat activity in the area. Rumor says that the current \nregent took her position after besting her predecessor in a simple no-weapons \nphysical battle. \nSystem: This ritus calls for very little mechanical adjudication. The form \nof the fight itself suggests what sorts of challenges the participants should \nmake. The priest’s player should emphasize the seriousness of the occasion \nwith proper pomp and circumstance. This isn’t just a rumble, it’s a rumble with \nprofound religious significance. Whatever theme and style a pack presents - \nurban gang, enthusiastic cult, disciplined military team or something else - \nshould color the proceedings. The priest should feel at liberty to add plausible \nrestrictions, perhaps postponing the battle to the next new or full moon or \nrequiring the setting to incorporate sacred numbers. \nSERMONS \nOP CAINF \nCaine the historical (or at least mythical) figure matters very much to \nsome Sabbat members, not at all to others. Among the vampires who care \nenough to argue theology, some treat Caine as the biggest, oldest and therefore \nworst menace of all, while others find in him the example of true freedom and \nindividuality. Vampires who do care about origins and do take Caine as their \ninspiration gather regularly to listen to teachings about him. This ritus renews \ntheir conviction and provides them with the shared attitudes and ideas to \nresolve disputes. \nIn some packs, the priest always delivers the sermon. In others, pack \nmembers share the duties. Each one in turn recites some favored passage from \nthe Book of Nod and offers comments about its relevance to the pack‘s \nsituation. Depending on the pack‘s preferences, the speaker may get an \nuninterrupted audience, or the rest of the pack may argue back. After the \nsermon, the priest may perform the Vaulderie. Enthusiastic pack members may \ncontinue the “discussion” until the approach of dawn. \nVampiric society has very few written records. The Book of Nod isn’t a \nsingle text - \nit’s a mass of fragments and an attitude about Cainite origins. \nSabbat packs argue constantly about the best, truest or oldest phrasing of a \npassage, and about whether a passage belongs in canon at all. Some believers \nargue that the sect must establish a single authoritative reading and make sure \neveryone studies it. Others claim, with just as muchfervor, that the spirit of the \nwork transcends any specific text, so competing searches for illumination serve \nthe sect’s best interests. Arguments on these points sometimes destroy packs \nand fuel inter-pack wars. \nSystem: This ritus doesn’t really require any mechanics. If Storytellers \nwant, they can ask for Performance tests to see how effectively a speaker \ncommunicates her point. Regular exposure to the Sermons of Caine might \nraise a participant’s Sabbat Lore, up to a limit of one or two levels less than that \nof the pack priest. This ritus is primarily an occasion for roleplaying. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nVAULDFRIF \nAND VINCULUM \nThe Vaulderie defines the Sabbat as a group. Vampires who partake show \nthat they are part of the sect; vampires who refuse the cup can never really \nbelong. The Blood Bond as Camarilla and independent vampires use it binds \nthe subject as the slave of his regnant. It reinforces the static hierarchy of elder \nover childe. The Vaulderie makes the participants equal, uniting them in their \nshared cause. It also introduces a constantly shifting mosaic of relationships as \nthe vampire who held another in highest esteem last night has a new target of \nsupreme devotion tonight. The bonds don’t erode; they do gain rivals of equal \nor greater intensity. \nSimply mixing vitae isn’t sufficient for the Vaulderie. The presiding priest \nmust use a cutting tool and cup dedicated to this specific purpose. Priests \ngenerally decorate their tools with hieroglyphics and artwork that expresses \ntheir pack concerns. (Artisans who produce tools that express a pack‘s shared \nsense of self gain high status. The Sabbat never has enough creators to match \nits ranks of corruptors and destroyers.) \nThe priest takes her ritual tools, makes a cut in herself and drains out as \nmany Blood Traits as she cares to contribute. Once the priest begins the \nceremony, she passes the cup and tool to each participant in turn, who \ncontributes as many Blood Traits as he chooses. \nContributing only one Blood Trait looks bad - \ndo you have something \nto hide? Contributing five or more Blood Traits, except when duty requires, \nlooks bad, too - \nare you angling for control? The ductus must contribute at \nleast one Blood Trait per participant (down to a minimum of one Blood Trait \nremaining), and generally aims to put in more than anyone else as a show of \ndedication and primacy of place. Trying to put in someone else’s blood, from \na concealed pouch or other source, doesn’t work. The cup erupts and splashes \nthe blood everywhere. Everyone loses the blood they put in. The priest must \nstart the ritual again, and the offender probably faces swift destruction. \nThe priest takes the filled cup and performs a simple ritual over it that \nmerges the blood together. Real magic happens at this point. Even if the priest \nwas chosen on the spur of the moment by packmates interested in renewing \ntheir Vinculum, a priest performing the ritual makes it work while someone \nnot chosen as priest could perform the same ritual but get no results. The priest \noffers a brief blessing on each participant as she drinks from the cup. The ritual \ngives back to each participant as many Blood Traits as she put in. \nEvery Sabbat member takes the Vaulderie seriously. Even the most feral \nwanderers or rowdy urban punks settle down for this ritual even if they’re never \nserious at any other time. This is what it’s all about. \nThe Vaulderie generates the Sabbat’s alternative to the blood bond, the \nVinculum. Each vampire takes away from the ritual a special bond to some \nother members of the pack (or whatever group performs the ritual). In game \nterms, each participant has a Vinculum rating of 1-10 with each of the other \nparticipants. The stronger the bond, the more firmly the participants feel \nbound to each other. At the high end, the Vinculum ties individuals together \neven more tightly than the blood bond. Note that Vinculum ratings aren’t \nsymmetrical. Andrew can have a Vinculum rating of 6 to Bettina, indicating \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\na very strong attachment to her, while she has only a rating of 1 to him, \nindicating the minimum possible result from sharing the ritual. \nSystem: The system given here supercedes that in Laws of the Night, p. \n224. \nThe player of a vampire taking part in the Vaulderie writes the character’s \nname on an index card to represent one Blood Trait added to the cup. Find a \ncontainer big enough to hold the cards players contribute -a \ntypical chalice \nwill overflow. Don’t carry the roleplaying of bloodletting to an extreme, and \nwhatever you do, don’t really drain any blood for this purpose (or any purpose \nin the game). \nThe player of the priest mixes the cards together, generally with some \nritual. The level of ceremony depends on the group’s preferences. The priest’s \ninvocation may be a simple “Grant us the strength to defeat all our enemies \nthrough unity of purpose” or a full-blown recitation from the Book ofNod about \nCaine’s refusal to bow to God’s threats. Likewise, the blessing can range from \n“Take courage to perform all your duties well” to complete Latin renderings of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nliturgical prayers adapted to the Sabbat’s worldview. Each participant draws \nout one card for each one he put in. If you want to work with religious themes, \nchoose your place carefully. Don’t freak the bystanders and people not taking \npart. Save the funky stuff for private spaces. \nThe first time a vampire takes part in the Vaulderie, she gets a Vinculum \nrating of 1 toward every other participant, plus one for each Blood Trait she \ndrank that belonged to a particular individual. In later performances of the \nVaulderie, she makes a Static Challenge of her current Vinculum rating \ntoward a particular individual against a total of one plus the number of Blood \nTraits she drank that belonged to that individual this time. If she loses the \nchallenge, her Vinculum rating toward that individual rises by one. If she ties, \nher Vinculum rating remains the same. If she wins, she can (at her discretion) \nmake two Simple Tests. If she wins both, her Vinculum rating toward that \nindividual falls by one; otherwise it remains the same. Her Vinculum rating \ntoward a fellow participant in this Vaulderie can never fall below 1. The player \ncannot spend Willpower or Traits for retests in these challenges. \nOptionally, you may simplify proceedings. You can have each player test \nfor her character’s Vinculum rating toward everyone involved in the ritus by \na single Static Challenge against the highest total of Blood Traits she drew. \nKeep in mind that this cuts out many layers of inter-personal intrigue that give \nSabbat games an important part of their flavor. Discuss it with players before \nadopting it. \nVinculum ratings don’t fade over time. Only a feat of will in the \ncelebration of the Vaulderie lets a vampire break some of her ties to others. \nPacks that regularly celebrate the Vaulderie develop very close ties, and the \nSabbat’s elders retain a network of deep connections to each other. Rumor \nattributes a Vinculum-breaking ritual to Nosferatu untitribu, the Sabbat \nInquisition or both. Allegedly, the Inquisition uses it to break ties between \nloyal Sabbat members and infemalists, but it is considered rumor at this point. \nA character attempting to destroy another vampire to whom he has any \nVinculum rating at all must spend two Willpower Traits. Acting less termi- \nnally against the interests of a vampire to whom he has a Vinculum rating of \nthree or more requires spending one Willpower Trait, and acting against a \nVinculum rating of six or more requires two Willpower Traits. The only \nexception is Monomacy performed under the supervision of an approved \nSabbat official. \nWhen a character with Vinculum ties to several individuals faces a choice \nbetween them, she draws on the Vinculum to settle her conflicting impulses. \nShe makes an Extended Challenge of her Willpower against each of the \nVinculum ratings involved (adding two to her Willpower when testing for the \nindividual she favors most). Whichever individual wins the most successes in \nthe challenge gets her loyalty in that situation. She may also simply go with \nwhomever she has the higher Vinculum rating for, especially if the difference \nis two or greater. \nThe Vaulderie gradually breaks down blood bonds. A vampire seeking \nrelease from bondage must put in at least six Blood Traits and reduce himself \ndown to one Blood Trait remaining. Taking in six points of Vaulderie- \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nconsecrated blood negates the effects of one draught of an individual vampire’s \nblood. Doing this three times, therefore, completely breaks a blood bond (and \ngenerates very strong Vinculum ratings). \nWAR PARTY \nThe War Party puts Sabbat doctrine to practical use. Multiple packs \ncompete for the blood of a designated non-Sabbat elder, with the winners \ngetting the benefits of diablerie. Hunting elders isn’t easy - \nthey generally \ndidn’t survive all those centuries by being careless or stupid, after all. In \naddition, while rival packs seldom use outright lethal force against each other, \nthey can and do sabotage each other’s efforts with means that stop short of \ndestruction. \nA Sabbat member of bishop or higher rank declares a War Party after \nidentifying an elder whose removal would benefit the sect. (Almost every non- \nSabbat elder poses a threat to the sect in some sense.) Preparations usually \ninclude a Fire Dance, a Sermon of Caine and a Blood Feast or Vaulderie. The \nchief of the War Party - \nusually the highest ranking priest involved, though \nsometimes ducti or bishops lead more politically oriented hunts - \naddresses \nthe assembled packs. He asks each ductus one of the few ritual questions that \nactually has a standard phrasing throughout the sect: “DO you come freely to \nwar, and do you take up this noble cause, never resting until the blood of our \nenemy is spilled?” Each ductus answers with “We do!” After this expression of \ncommitment, the War Party leader identifies the target and presents informa- \ntion that might help the hunt. \nA ductus can decide to withdraw her pack from the challenge. She faces \nridicule for this, and any packmates who call for Monomacy generally win \napproval on the spot. The packs who remain celebrate the rest of the night and \nembark on the hunt itself after rising from sleep on the following night. \nThe War Party makes every tactic legitimate if not automatically wise. \nHunting packs can inflict whatever collateral damage they deem necessary on \ntheir way to the target, and when the destructive action shows courage and \nforethought, packs not participating in the War Party often help clean up the \ndamage. In the final approach to the target’s haven, competing packs often \ndispense with niceties like doors if they have members with the strength to \nbreak through barriers. Note that sometimes, brute force is very unwise. A \nwell-protected target calls for approaches emphasizing stealth and treachery. \nSome War Parties last for weeks or even months rather than a few violent \nnights. \nOnly one member of the winning pack gets the full benefit of the diablerie, \nof course. Sabbat tradition generally recognizes success, and awards the kill to \nthe first vampire to get her fangs into the victim. Pack members need not sit \nidly by, however. Tradition also endorses vigorous competition, and it’s not \nuncommon for a hunt to end with only one pack member still mobile enough \nto actually commit the deed. \nThe target elder seldom acquiesces calmly to her fate. Entire city blocks \nsometimes collapse in rubble in the ensuing struggle. Depending on their \npersonal styles, targeted elders may unleash Master-level Disciplines or potent \nbribes in various coins. Every so often, a winning pack gets a good enough offer \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n-4 \nto betray the Sabbat and defend the elder, though they usually don’t survive \nlong after that. \nThe War Party ritus comes to an end when the winning pack presents \ntangible evidence of their kill to the War Party leader. The leader accepts the \ntoken after examining it for signs of fakery and blesses the victors. All surviving \npacks gather for another round of revels as soon as news of the War Party’s \nresolution spreads. \nSystem: The individual vampire who actually diablerizes the target gets \nall the usual benefits of diablerie. The members of the winning pack get the \ntemporary Status of Martial, which lasts until the next War Party, Grand Ball \nor Festival of the Dead. Particularly prominent targets like Methuselahs win \npermanent Status for the victors. \nWILD HUNT \nThe Wild Hunt gives force to the Sabbat’s emphasis on devotion. A \nmember who betrays the sect’s secrets risks this ultimate sanction. \nA priest calls the Wild Hunt. Generally the highest-ranking priest in the \nvicinity does so, and she’d better have the support of her superiors before \naccusing another Sabbat member of treachery or face the same punishment \nherself. All loyal sect members in the area must hunt down the traitor and \nanyone, Cainite or mortal, to whom he may have given the information. \nOverzealous vampires who destroy a Wild Hunt target before interrogation \nrisk Final Death themselves. The traitor’s contacts are exterminated only after \nexamination makes sure that they haven’t spread the leaked information \nfurther. \nThe Wild Hunt seldom takes place in the risky and yet exuberant \natmosphere of a War Party. Treachery exposes the whole sect to risk. Whatever \npreparatory rites take place, their priests perform them solemnly. Vaulderie is \nessential, and Fire Dancing usually accompanies it. \nThe vampire who captures the traitor and his contacts bring their prisoner \nback to some central meeting place for questioning. The ductus and priest, and \nany superiors who wish to take part, recite the traitor’s crimes and use torture \nto extract confirmation. Hot irons, mutilation, Vicissitude and a multitude of \nother means come into play. Once the traitor confirms his sins and the Sabbat \nestablishes the spread of his leaked secrets, torture becomes straightforward \npunishment, lasting as long as anyone involved has ideas about how to hurt the \ntraitor. Vampiric collaborators also face torture while mortal allies generally \nmeet quick, if painful, ends. \nAfter tormenting the traitor, his former packmates throw his staked body \nonto a consecrated funeral pyre. An attending priest recites the Book ofNod’s \nChronicle of Caine to remind all involved that victory requires unity and that \ndistrust makes unity impossible. Vaulderie follows to reestablish the bonds of \nmutual commitment. \nSystem: Some regions practice the ignoblis ritus of Contrition, to allow \ntraitors to make amends. Storytellers may allow the targets of a Wild Hunt to \ninvoke this or not, at Storyteller discretion. For minor offenses, allowing \ncontrition with punishment balances severity with the avoidance of hasty \ncharacter death. More serious offenses should bring a more serious penalty: \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe Sabbat is not a place where “do as you please” flourishes without \nqualification, and sometimes nothing short of character death makes the point \nclear. Never arrange a character’s death lightly, but don’t hold back when it’s \ntruly earned. \nLOW RITES (1gNom1s RITA€) \nThe “low rites” vary from pack to pack. Not all packs observe them; many \npacks that do acknowledge them put local variations and emphases on them. \nStorytellers can establish ignoblis ritae for their chronicles, and players should \nfeel free to work up new low rites subject to review by their characters’ \nsuperiors. \nThe Sabbat works from the bottom up as well as from the top down. In the \nwar against the shadows of the past, innovation is one of the sect’s key weapons. \nCharacters should know that their innovations may well meet with favorable \nresponse. Sect leaders encourage new ways of putting existing principles into \naction, particularly in response to new situations. \nACCEPTANCE \nAcceptance ritae mark an individual’s induction to a pack, whether at the \nend of auctoritas Creation Rites, adoption of an existing Sabbat member \nseparated from his old pack or as a reaffirmation of the pack‘s membership after \na change of leadership. Each member of the pack acknowledges the newcomer \nwith some personal token. Some packs offer vitae while others offer gifts, \nadvice, favors or something else useful. There’s no innate magical benefit in \nthe Acceptance ritus, just the social bond. Many packs include a short oath in \nwhich the newcomer acknowledges his debt to the pack and the sect; in turn, \nhis new packmates take an oath to treat him as an equal, with the same rewards \nfor his successes and punishments for his failures that they all face. \nALLE~IANCE \nThe Allegiance ritus bridges the gap between formal creation of a new \nSabbat member and her acceptance into a specific pack. The new vampire \nmust prove herself familiar with the sect’s ideals and capable of acting \neffectively. While in this transitional period, the vampire occupies a distinctly \nsecondary position. She stands at the rear during uuctoritas ria, drinks last at \nthe Vaulderie (and generally can’t contribute her own blood) and cannot \nengage in discussion of the Book ofhrod. Most packs administer a secret mark \nof some sort as part of the ritus, identifying the recipient as someone who’s \nbegun to win acceptance and not yet completed the process. \nThe trial period may last only a few weeks if the vampire proves remark- \nably capable or may stretch on for years. A vampire who never succeeds in \nimpressing a pack enough to warrant Acceptance faces the threat of Final \nDeath administered by her disappointed creators. Camarilla defectors spend \nmore time under scrutiny and must complete tougher challenges of their new \nloyalty, often including attacks on their former comrades. \nTHE \nAsp’s BLESS IN^ \nSabbat teachings sometimes compare the sect to a snake. This ritus gives \nthat metaphor tangible form. The priest raises a snake (almost always of some \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\npoisonous species) before the pack and asks Caine’s spirit to guide the snake’s \neyes and fangs. Each pack member must step forward to kiss the snake. If it bites \nback, the priest denounces the participant for concealed sins. At the end of the \nAsp’s Blessing ritus, examination and Contrition rime follow for all who failed \nthe test of purity. \nCONTRITION \nThe Contrition ritus is most likely to win promotion to auctoritas status \nsoon; very nearly every pack practices it in some form. Sabbat members who’ve \ncommitted offenses against the sect confess their failings and accept any \npunishment short of Final Death. Minor failures earn no more than a beating \nand assignment to unpleasant duties. Breaches of sect security might win \ndismemberment and the restoration of just enough vitae to let the contrite \nvampire begin healing. \nPacks vary in their willingness to accept repeated performance of the \nContritionritus, whether for the same offense again and again or for a diversified \nbut sustained pattern of clueless conduct. Packs whose leaders show too much \nleniency face condemnation themselves. The sect is, after, all, at war. \nW F L C o M I N q  \nThe Welcoming ritus is, like Acceptance, a social occasion. Whenever \ntwo packs meet for a shared task, or a nomad pack enters a city, they have to \nestablish some neutral space within which to become acquainted. The mem- \nbers of the packs name themselves and their homes. Vampires who recognize \nothers with whom they have grievances promptly say so, and the packs’ ducti \nand priests attempt to mediate the dispute. A short, non-lethal duel often \nfollows just to let the disputing parties deal with it. The packs’ leaders establish \nbasic protocols governing access to havens and favored feeding grounds. All \nthe packmates then reaffirm their loyalty to the Sabbat’s twin emphasis on \nindividual liberty and united action. In many areas, the pack leaders exchange \nblood; in areas with a very strong religious emphasis, everyone in the packs may \nimmediately share the Vaulderie. \nAfter the Welcoming Titus, pack leaders feel more comfortable making \nplans for whatever their common purpose may be. \nT H A N K S ~ I V I N ~  \nThe Thanksgiving ritus practices the giving of thanks in an old-fashioned, \nliteral sense. Members of a pack gather and each tells a story about his exploits. \nHe begins, (‘1 thank Caine for his favor when I.. . .” Then he recounts a recent \naccomplishment, aiming to show his particularly remarkable strength, cun- \nning or other desirable characteristic. Exaggeration is routine in almost all \npacks that practice this ritus. Thanksgiving often precedes an esbat or other \nmore formal occasion. \nMARTIAL \nMartial rim take many forms, all with the goal of mustering pack \nmembers’ enthusiasm for and ability to take the endless war to their enemies. \nA Martial ritus generally involves some rhythmic activity to ease participants \ninto a trance state. Music, dance and martial arts all enjoy widespread \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\npopularity. Traditional (or neo-primitive) groups include body adornment, \nritual scarification and the like. \nSPILLINS \nOE BLOOD \nThe ritus of the Spilling of Blood is one of several that never quite became \naucton‘tas but is well-known throughout the sect. Vampires feeding together \nmake a point of trading sips from their respective vessels with a ritual \nacknowledgement along the lines of “Hot blood that spurted from Abel at his \ntime of death, sustain us for the will of the Sabbat.” \nSTEALTH \nPacks about to embark on an assignment that requires silence practice the \nStealth ritus, as do packs that simply wish to test their discipline. Participants \nbite out eachother’s tongues and spit the severed organs into afire. This inflicts \nno lasting damage; the participants each spend a Blood Point to stabilize the \nwound. In some cases the ductus or priest refrains from participating so that he \ncan give orders, while in others all pack members join in and communicate \nthrough hand signals and mental Disciplines. \nSUN DANCE \nThis ritus tests the participants’ endurance and courage. The Sun Dance \nritus always takes place during a full moon. Participants wear frightening \ncostumes or body paint, hoping to intimidate others. The participants dance \nfrom the moment they waken after sunset until sunrise, gyrating around a \nsymbolic inscription of a fiery sun. They then attempt to stay wake and in the \nopen as long as possible during the new day. A Blood Feast generally follows \nthe next night. \nSome packs make provision to rescue participants who become too \ninjured to seek shelter, while others don’t. Sect leaders frown on this sort of \npointless loss of brave members and encourage Sun Dance observers to keep \nbystanders at hand. \nTESTS \nOE P A I N  \nAll of the various Test of Pain ritae challenge the participants’ ability to \nremain functional in the face of severe pain. Some packs use Tests of Pain as \npart of their competition to choose new leaders; many packs include Tests of \nPain along with Contrition ritae as punishment. The Trial by Stake is simple \nand widely practiced. The participant to be tested gets staked to a wall by a \nstake through his chest, mounted high enough that his feet don’t touch the \nground. Depending on the pack, he may remain there until packmates let him \ndown just before sunrise, or he may have to tear himself loose and go on to \nperform other tests. The Trial by Fire subjects various parts of a participant’s \nbody to flame wielded by the pack priest. The Trial by Gauntlet requires the \nparticipant to make his way through parallel rows of packmates who beat him, \nsometimes with weapons, sometimes barehanded. \nThe range of Tests of Pain is nearly infinite. Pack priests generally develop \na favored personal repertoire. Use Courage and Self-Control (or Instinct) for \nspecific tests when the vampire’s resolve is in doubt. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTRUTH \nREVEALED \nThe Truth Revealed ritus hangs on the edge of auctoritas standing; its \nefficacy depends on the ability of the priest administering the ritus. A vampire \nunder suspicion of dishonesty writes out a statement with her own blood. The \npriest takes the paper and bums it, usually in a ceremonial censer. If the smoke \nturns black, the statement was false while white smoke indicates truthfulness. \nEven when the priest does nothing special, the ritus produces accurate results \nmore often than chance would allow. Sabbat scholars theorize that the \nceremony taps into the latent mystic powers of the pack united in the search \nfor truth. Priests who possess three or more levels of Occult or Rituals may make \na Mental Challenge against the subject of the inquiry. If the priest succeeds, \nthe n’tus always generates the right color of smoke. \nSTATUS \nThe Sabbat takes Status very seriously indeed. The sect fights wars on all \nfronts, and in time of war, everyone fighting on the same side needs to know \nwho gives orders and who carries them out. The war isn’t just political - \nit’s \nreligious, involving fundamental questions of right and wrong, who may be \nsaved or damned, when the world can or must end and so on. Individuals rise \nthrough the Sabbat’s ranks on merit, proving themselves physically and \nmentally capable of wielding power. Status Traits honor their past achieve- \nments and show what others should expect. \nSabbat members gain Status more readily than most Camarilla members. \nThey also lose Status more readily. As noted in Laws of the Night, Revised \nEdition, p. 222, the members of a pack acting in unison can strip a packmate \nof any Status Trait except those associated with matters of fact. See below for \na summary of common Sabbat Status Traits and the ways Sabbat members \nqualify for them. \nAs the descriptions of particular offices emphasize, the Sabbat’s masters \nlead rather than rule. They cannot hand down decrees with impunity; they \nmust set the example of courageous action and penetrating insight. The \nreligious and political goals of the secret favor pragmatic response. A good \nleader is the one who gets things done. If things don’t get done, or get done \nbadly, the leader is leading badly and runs the risk of being deposed. Even the \neldest master of war and crusade gets little automatic respect. Long lists of past \nhonors don’t matter much in the face of tonight’s needs. \nThe higher the rank a Sabbat member holds, the more of a proven record \nshe must have. Nobody becomes bishop the night after she earns Initiated Status. \nNobody loses a bishopric overnight in response to a single minor problem or \nallegation from a neonate, either. Deposing a high-ranking officer requires \nverifiable charges. Real failings are easier to prove than fraudulent ones, though \nsometimes trickery does work. The challenges facing the Sabbat from all sides \ngenerally ensure that every leader does in fact make some mistakes, and rivals \nneed only keep a careful tally of the leader’s errors. Rivals also generally strike \ndeals with the leader’s enemies or superiors (or both) so that when the current \nleader falls, the right candidate emerges as a plausible replacement. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe Camarilla generally sees the Sabbat as a mass of fanatics and \nberserkers only because the true depths of Sabbat sect politics happen where \noutsiders don’t see them. Court and conclave schemes offer no more tangled \nmorass of intrigue than the maneuverings around a new bishop’s ascension. \nWHAT STATUS MBANS \nKeep in mind that Status Traits quantify something that’s hazy and \nsubjective to characters in the World of Darkness. Status is fluid, personalized \nand subject to change without notice. If you’d prefer to run your chronicle \nwithout using the mechanics, go right ahead. The reality of Status -superior \nand inferior rank, plus acknowledgement of smart or foolish deeds - \nexists, \nand you can roleplay it out in lots of ways. The rules should serve the chronicle. \nMost particularly, in a sect as open to variation as the Sabbat, you have the \nfreedom topresent the world in terms that work for your players and characters. \nSTATUS \nEOR SABBAT \nA Sabbat member can have eight Status Traits, plus one per level of Path \nrating. Note that Sabbat Status comes and goes far more rapidly than in the \nCamarilla, see Laws of the Night, p. 222. \nSome Sabbat Status Traits reflect accomplishments that don’t require the \nvampire to hold an office. Important Traits of this sort include: \nBattle-Scarred. The vampire was Wounded or Incapacitated while \nfighting enemies of the Sabbat. \nBlessed, Devoted and Enlightened all mark progress on a Path. A vampire \nwith two levels in his Morality earns one of these Traits - \nwhich one depends \non the views of his priest and pack about his particular standing. A vampire \nwith three Morality Traits is eligible for a second of these Traits, and a vampire \nwith four Morality Traits can carry all three. \nBlooded. The vampire killed another vampire in fair combat, and \nobservers agree that it was a meaningful challenge (as opposed to a 6th- \ngeneration Methuselah devouring the 13th-generation childe created last \nnight, for instance). \nEnriched. The vampire committed diablerie in accordance with sect \npractice (often because her Path recommends it). \nInitiated. The vampire went through CreationRites and Vaulderie to the \nsatisfaction of her new packmates and any higher-ranking vampires overseeing \nthe process. \nUndefeated. The vampire has never lost a fair fight or Monomacy. Facing \noverwhelming odds that force flight doesn’t invalidate this Status. \nStorytellers should feel free to define more Status Traits that apply to a \npack, all the packs in a bishop’s territory or even to the sect as a whole. Just as \nthe ignoblis rim supplement the auctoritas rim, “unofficial” Status Traits \nexpress the concerns of the leaders in a particular region. Make the style of the \nSabbat in your region matter in Status along with rites and the general tone of \nyour chronicle. \nThe packmates of a successful leader who steps down in honorable \ncircumstances often grant him the Status he held as an officer. It’s a display of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsatisfaction with how he did his work. Superiors generally let these gifts of \nStatus stand; removing them shows disapproval almost as directly as a slap in \nthe face. \nThe Sabbat also defines a number of standard negative Status Traits. (As \nwith positive Status Traits, feel free to add more that suit your chronicle.) A \nSabbat member may possess two of these at any given moment. Recently \nawarded negative Traits displace older ones as far as game mechanics go, \nthough Sabbat members retain their memories ofwhat went wrong and can act \non those memories even without game mechanics prodding them along. A \nvampire can earn the removal of the Trait by twice successfully completing \nwhatever task it was he failed at to earn the negative Trait in the first place: \nA failed priest removes Untrustworthy by performing rites correctly twice; a \nDangerous vampire goes on two hunts without making trouble for packmates \nand so on. \nDangerous. This Trait goes to vampires who endanger packmates for \nstupid reasons, particularly while on a hunt or otherritus-related mission. Most \npacks only give it to those who do things like shooting packmates or standing \naround to argue with flamethrower-wielding soldiers; strict packs give it simply \nfor creating a risky situation. \nIgnorant. The vampire cannot remember some essential tenet of the \nSabbat as explained to her time and time again. Most often this Trait goes to \na vampire who says something like “Well, maybe some of the Antediluvians \nare okay.” \nSlow. This Trait goes to any vampire who gets overtaken by humans, \nwhether in a pursuit on foot, by vehicles or some more exotic means of travel. \nUntrustworthy. The vampire failed in the performance of some key duty \nof his position. This may go to a priest who “botches” a ritus but may also go \nto some other leader for an explicit violation of his duties. \nVain (also known as Cocky, Full Of Himself or comparable terms). The \nvampire claims mastery of some field she goes on to fail publicly at, preferably \nin an impressive or even physically dangerous way. This Trait commemorates \nacts of unsuccessful hubris. \nTHE PRIVILE~ES \nOE O~EICE \nHigher-ranked officers can exercise the privileges of those beneath them, \nexcept as noted in each office’s description. Thus archbishops can do everything \nbishops can; cardinals can do everything archbishops can, and regents can do \neverything cardinals can. The Sabbat ranks ducti, priests and abbots equally. \nTemplars and prisci occupy special positions somewhat outside the chain of \ncommand and have only the powers listed in their respective descriptions. \nDUCTUS \nEvery Sabbat pack has a ductus, its leader. The importance of the title \nvaries from pack to pack. Sometimes the ductus holds real authority, whether \nby fear, charisma or some other means of getting her packmates to do her will. \nIn other packs it’s just there because superior officers want someone to blame \nwhen the pack screws up. A ductus who consistently gets her pack into trouble \neventually gets destroyed, from above or below. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe ductus calls her packmates to esbat, or pack meeting, in which the \npack discusses its affairs. Members who’ve earned rewards get them now, and \nmembers who’ve earned punishments face judgment. The ductus divides up \nresponsibilities like haven defense and corpse removal as seems wise to her - \nsome ducti reserve jobs for themselves while others spread the load around as \nmuch as possible. \nThe ductus may not be the eldest member of the pack. If she isn’t, she \nneeds some other edge, like most ferocious, most skilled in an impressive \nDiscipline or best stocked with blackmail information. Most packs go through \na phase of choosing the most personable or charming member as ductus. A few \ndisastrous and wholly avoidable defeats cure the urge. \nWhen rank becomes absolutely critical, the ductus is considered “more \nequal than” all others in the pack- she has distinguished herself somehow and \nearned responsibility for (and some authority over) the pack, which most ducti \ncan bring to bear should a matter of pack policy come into question. The wise \nductus, of course, listens to her pack, resorting to rank only when others refuse \nto see the strength of her arguments. \nThe ductus automatically gains the Status Trait of Feared when taking \noffice, and this can never be permanently removed while she remains ductus. \nThe ductus appoints and removes the pack‘s priest. \nThe ductus can grant or remove permanent Status Traits from pack \nmembers at a cost of one temporary Status Trait each. Each grant of Status after \nthe third permanent Trait costs the ductus one permanent Status Trait of her own. \nIt costs nothing at all for the ductus to grant the Status of Initiated to new recruits. \nPACK \nPRIEST \nThe priest takes care of his packmates’ souls just as the ductus takes care \nof their bodies. The priest sets the tone for the pack‘s values and priorities. \nWhat do pack members value most highly? What angers them most? How do \nthey deal with losses and setbacks? The priest’s teachings provide the answers. \nThe priest must know all the standard rim since the ductus and bishop \nconduct inspections for pack orthodoxy. The priest also has freedom to invent \nnew ritae for the pack‘s own use. The popular ones spread, earning favor for the \npriest and the enlightened leaders who let him experiment while unpopular \nones bring disfavor on the idiot and the fools who let him out of his cage. \nEvery pack has at least one priest. Large packs and packs led by ducti who \nreally care about the religious side of the Sabbat may have two. If the ductus \nbecomes unable to lead, the priest acts as pro tern pack leader until the pack \nchooses a replacement or the bishop appoints a new ductus. Even while the \nductus leads on other matters, the priest carries a tremendous responsibility. \nHe must teach his packmates to resist frenzy and steer them away from \ninfernalist temptations. Most priests, though not all, forsake Humanity in \nfavor of one of the Paths of Enlightenment. Some priests encourage their \npackmates to adopt the same Path while others encourage any system of \nmorality that doesn’t undermine the pack‘s goals. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe priest automatically gains the Status Trait Enlightened when taking \noffice, and this can never be permanently removed while the Priest retains his \nposition. \nThe priest can give or remove the following permanent Status Traits, \neach at a cost of one temporary Status Trait of his own: Blessed, Devoted and \nEnlightened. The priest uses these Traits to mark the rise (and fall) of his \npackmates’ spiritual insight. \nThe priest’s performance of the ritae modifies the results available to the \npack, as discussed on page 140. \nABBOT \nThe office of abbot goes in and out of fashion. In the Final Nights, it’s \nfavored mostly by bishops and archbishops who like large packs. In regions that \nappoint individuals to the office, the abbot takes charge of maintaining a \npack‘s haven and food supply. The abbot must scout out possible locations, deal \nwith security threats, find ways to dispose of the bodies and keep the pack rested \nand fit for all their various duties. Converts from the Camarilla describe the \nabbot’s duties as a combination of the work of seneschal and scourge. \nThe abbot automatically gains the Status Trait of Loyal when taking \noffice, and this can never be permanently removed while she retains her \nposition. \nThe abbot can ignore one Status held by packmates whose actions \njeopardize the haven. This only applies to immediate threats, like leading \npolice pursuers back to the haven. \nTF iv p LAR/pALAD IN \nBishops and higher-ranking officers can appoint bodyguards and personal \nagents for tasks that require force and finesse. The Sabbat as a whole maintains \nfew standards for the position, not even having a single title for it. Templar and \npaladin refer to the same category of special service. Templars have a variety \nof duties, all related to combat or protection in some fashion. Most look over \nthe personal safety of the officer who appointed them. Some monitor pack \nleaders’ performance and intervene to solve problems, then punish the leader \nwho screwed up. The Inquisitors employ templars with them as enforcers \nduring their travels and trials. \nTemplars cannot join the Black Hand. Membership is seen as a conflict \nof interests as the paladins are encouraged to eschew factional agendas. In \ntheory, a templar pays attention only to his specific duties at the present time. \nIn practice, every templar has other issues in mind as well, and the sect simply \ntries to reduce the unnecessary complications. \nTemplars are used extensively by sect leaders, though some may belong to \npacks during periods of inactivity or have been honorably discharged from their \nduties in times when their leaders have no need for bodyguards. Ex-templars \nenjoy widespread respect. Packs in their vicinity compete to recruit vampires \nwith a history of such prominent service and to treat them well after recruitment. \nThe templar automatically gains the Status Traits of Respected and \nOminous when taking office, and this can never be permanently removed \nwhile he retains his position. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe templar can disobey an order from an officer lower-ranked than the \none who appointed him, as long as it’s disobedience in the line of duty. If the \ntemplar’s superior refuses to support the templar, then normal Sabbat justice \ntakes its course. \nBISHOP \n(ALWAYS OE A S ~ E C I E I C  \nCITY) \nThe bishop presides over the Sabbat population of a small to mid-sized \nmetropolitan region, or an expanse of smaller settlements that doesn’t strike \nSabbat leadership as big or important enough to warrant an archbishop. Large \ncities without archbishops run under a council of all the bishops in the area. \nMany bishops once served as priests. It’s not a requirement, however - \nskillful ducti also go on to hold bishoprics. Rising to the rank of bishop marks \na vampire’s entrance into the serious realm of sect politics. New bishops are \nalmost always less than two centuries old and generally know only some of the \nmatters they must now make decisions about. Priests with profound insights \ninto the ritae, for instance, may know nothing about administration and \nsecurity issues while expert warriors may lack any experience in detecting the \nearly signs of heresy and infernalism. The council of bishops lets each of the \nnew leaders consult with peers and learn through observation. \nClueless bishops don’t last long. The cardinal of the region oversees the \nbishops’ council, and most cardinals tolerate few serious mistakes. The often \nfractious nature of pack debates means that bishops must constantly intervene \nto forestall disaster while worrying that the wrong action taken or left undone \ncould mean their own destruction. A bishop enjoys less maneuvering room in \nwhich to demand obedience: The bishop must negotiate as well as command. \nA bishop may command as few as two packs, or as many as a dozen. The \nSabbat tries to keep bishops from getting too overloaded with duties, but the \nongoing crises sometimes make it necessary. One unlucky attackon a Camarilla \ncity can leave a region devoid of leaders above the level of ducti and priests, \nfor instance. So can a successful investigation into infernalism (where “suc- \ncess” may involve the conviction and punishment of political enemies who \nweren’t actually dealing with demons). In peaceful times, bishops groom their \nheirs with extensive training and preparation and discussion beforehand with \narchbishops and cardinals about their own plans. In the Final Nights, being \nchosen as bishop more often comes as a complete surprise, with training after \nappointment. \nBishops answer directly to cardinals, whose justice may have severe \nconsequences if an errant bishop refuses to mend his ways. \nThe bishop automatically gains the Status Traits of Feared and Proven \nwhen taking office, and these can never be permanently removed while she \nretains her position. \nThe bishop can appoint and remove ducti and priests. \nThe bishop can appoint templars. To promote a pack member to templar \nrank, the bishop must spend a temporary Status Trait of her own. \nThe bishop may choose to lead ritae in which she participates; she must \nchoose an appropriate surrogate when she declines. (Declining too often \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n-+ \ni \ne \nsuggests cowardice and makes a good start for accumulated charges of derelic- \ntion of duty.) \nThe bishop leads the packs under her jurisdiction against the Sabbat’s \nenemies. She can delegate some responsibilities to templars, ducti and chosen \nwar leaders, but as with ria, too much refusal or reassignment undermines her \nauthority. \nThe bishop can strip a Sabbat member of the Status of Initiated in \nresponse to serious violations of the Sabbat’s governing code. At that point, \nonly the individual bonds of Vaulderie protect the outcast from immediate \ndestruction. This costs the bishop one temporary Status Trait of her own. \nThe bishop can set terms on which roving packs enter her jurisdiction. \nShe cannot refuse passage to packs who acknowledge her authority and take \npart in ria; she can restrict their ability to act independently while residing \nin the area. \nARCHBISHOP \n(ALWAYS OE A S ~ F C I ~ ~ I C  \nRFC~ION) \nThe archbishop rules over the city, or at least that’s the general idea. The \ncardinal for the region appoints an archbishop to the lead the Sabbat in a city \nthe cardinal believes needs a mdre experienced individual in charge or where \na council of bishops hasn’t done well. \nArchbishops always come from the ranks of bishops. Nobody gains \nresponsibility for all the affairs of a city until he’s learned how to handle all \naspects of Sabbat routine. The new archbishop takes office already solidly \ngrounded in Sabbat beliefs and practice. He’s proven himself in battle and \nshown himself capable of attending to his followers’ spiritual needs. He’s \nprobably not equally competent in all fields, but he’s at least not so incompe- \ntent that he got punished severely in lower positions. \nThe archbishop doesn’t look after the well-being of mortals. Sabbat \nstrongholds tend to be blighted, crime-ridden hellholes where nobody notices \na few more dead bodies. The people of the town live in fear, but are too scared, \nexhausted or depressed to flee. The Sabbat has no tradition of Masquerade: As \nlong as Sabbat behavior doesn’t bring down massive mortal retaliation, it’s \nfine. Highly visible displays of vampiric power usually merit punishment - \nnot because they’re wicked, but because they’re bad tactics. In the era of mass \nmedia, the Sabbat has to restrain its more zealous members from behavior that \nwouldn’t have mattered when cities were more isolated. (Some Sabbat \nenthusiasts favor social and technological collapse for precisely this reason.) \nThe archbishop sets the tone for his city. \nMost archbishops take office sometime in their second century of unlife, \nand few make it to 300. Competition and the endless war take their toll. A \nhandful of archbishops are much older, running back to the Sabbat’s founding \nor even before, and they exercise tremendous authority in the sect regardless \nof their nominal rank. \nEvery priest can create ignoblis ritae on her own, and superiors can \nintervene only in cases of extreme doctrinal divergence. The archbishop can \nrecommend ignoblis rim that impress him to packs in his jurisdiction and even \nsuggest them for elevation to aucton’tas status. In addition, the archbishop takes \nthe lead insetting the style of ritual observance for all the packs he leads. Priests \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nand bishops act very slowly (if they know what’s good for them) when \ncontradicting the archbishop’s preferences for level of formality, aesthetic \npresentation and the like. \nThe archbishop is also the spiritual authority of her city. Many archbish- \nops were pack priests before attaining their positions. Archbishops officiate at \nmany of the auctoritas rim of their city’s Cainites, and they often develop \npersonal, local or regional ignoblis ritue as well. In the end, the archbishop \nsupervises the spiritual, and therefore civic, health of her city. \nThe archbishop gains the Status Traits of Feared, Proven and Relentless \nwhen taking office, and these can never be permanently removed while he \nretains his position. \nThe archbishop appoints and removes bishops and lower-ranked \nofficers in his jurisdiction. \nThe archbishop can create and remove templars; this costs him no \ntemporary Status Traits. \nThe archbishop can strip a vampire in her jurisdiction of the Status of \nInitiated and grant the Status of Hunted. This costs the archbishop one \ntemporary Status Trait of his own when changing the status of a bishop and one \npermanent Status Trait when changing the status of another archbishop or \nsuperior. Vampires who know that a target is Hunted can use it as a Negative \nTrait while resisting efforts by the outcast to call on Vinculum bonds for aid. \nCasting out an archbishop or cardinal without very good reason leads to the \noffending archbishop’s own destruction. \nThe archbishop can temporarily strip priests under his command of one \nor more Status Traits for inappropriate performance of the rime - \nthat is, for \nperforming them in a style the archbishop doesn’t like. In cases of gross \ndeviation, the archbishop may spend a temporary Status Trait to grant the \nStatus of Questionable or Unreliable to the priest, and (at the archbishop’s \ndiscretion) to the ductus and other participants. No Sabbat member may rise \nthrough the ranks without convincing an archbishop or superior to remove the \nnegative mark; it takes heroic displays of merit to earn release unless the \narchbishop himself comes into disgrace, in which case his successor undoes \nmost negative grants. \nCARDINAL (ALWAYS O E  A spwmrc RtxjroN) \nWhat archbishops do for cities, cardinals do for states and whole coun- \ntries. The cardinal coordinates all the archbishops in her jurisdiction, directing \nthem as the great war requires. \nLike her subordinates, the cardinal exercises both political and spiritual \nauthority. The balance depends on the cardinal‘s own inclinations. Every \nsuccessful cardinal must advance the sect’s goals (or, in areas of particularly \nintense opposition, at least not let the sect’s interests suffer) and see to it that \nhealthy religious dispute remains within the bounds of Sabbat orthodoxy. \nSome cardinals emphasize themselves as generals and warriors taking their \npeople into heroic battle. Others fancy themselves master tacticians and \ndevise cunning plans that their followers carry out. Still others see themselves \nas the guardians of the true Cainite faith, putting up with administrative chores \nas the price of leading the masses toward the ultimate freedom of the soul. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRegardless of her particular style, every cardinal enjoys the mixed fear and \ndevotion of her subjects. The vampires she commands must know that she \npunishes failure and rebellion by any means she deems appropriate, up to and \nincluding Final Death, just as she rewards success and innovation. \nThe cardinal bears personal responsibility for the crusades in her region. \nThe territory assigned to her includes many cities that the Sabbat does not \ncontrol. She must see to it that they come under the sect’s direction. \nExperienced in the various means ofwarfare, she’s expected to use them all, not \njust the ones she’s personally fond of. A successful crusade usually takes years \nto plan, with reconnaissance (updated constantly), contacts with potential \nallies inside the target zone, as well as contingency plans. The cardinal needs \nto oversee the planning while keeping her (theoretically) devoted followers \nbusy enough in the meantime. Inevitably, she must delegate responsibility for \nmany aspects of the process, and the failure of her chosen agents generally \nforms the basis of charges for her own removal. \nMost cardinals have been vampires for at least three centuries by the time \nthey take office, though there are prominent exceptions. Many cardinals, even \nin the Final Nights, took part in the Anarch Revolt as well as the Sabbat’s \nvarious civil wars. The successful cardinal has to appease her peers and \nsuperiors, offering evidence that her unfolding plans make sense and offer a \nreasonable chance of success. Simultaneously, she must rein in her own \nenthusiasm for the sect’s ultimate triumph and keep her followers from \nprematurely ravaging the cities they dominate so thoroughly as to provoke \nmortal response. \nThe cardinal’s subjects usually don’t see her often, except during the \nannual ritae and in moments of great crisis when she must take a personal role \nin leadership. Even advocates of individual supremacy need a chain of \ncommand, and bishops and archbishops handle routine matters. If the cardinal \ngets involved, the situation is by definition unusual and generally unfortunate \nfor whoever attracted the cardinal’s attention. \nThe cardinal gains the Status Traits of Ominous, Proven and Supen’or \nupon taking office, and these can never be permanently removed while she \nretains her position. \nThe cardinal can appoint and remove archbishops (at the cost of one of \nher own temporary Status Traits), templars and lower-ranked officers (at no \ncost to herself). \nThe cardinal can remove a vampire’s Initiated Status and impose the \nStatus of Hunted without cost to herself. She may also punish priests with the \nremoval of one or more Status Traits without cost to herself. \nThe cardinal may spend a temporary Status Trait to grant the Status of \nFavored to chosen agents - \ninfiltrators, strategists and the like. Anyone who \npunishes or destroys a Favored member of the Sabbat faces automatic Monomacy \nagainst the cardinal unless there’s an extremely good reason for the action. \nPRISCUS \nThe priscus generally has held offices in the past and may in the future, but \nthe rank of priscus doesn’t require other position in the Sabbat’s hierarchy. \nPrisci act as advisors to the regent, cardinals and archbishops (and occasionally \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n+c \ni \nt \nto lower-ranked officers). The priscus generally holds a great deal of influence, \nboth in the form of favors owed by current officials and in the fundamental coin \nof the sect, respect for individual achievement. \nThe priscus sometimes acts independently, with or without the approval \nof the official he’s advising. More often, he provides information and training \nto younger vampires. Above all, the priscus helps the vampire he aids to make \nmost effective use of the weaknesses presented by the sect’s enemies of the \nmoment. Sometimes the job involves surgical strikes to study military de- \nfenses, sometimes espionage, sometimes ideological warfare to sow confusion \nand plant seeds of thought that the Sabbat can exploit later. Many prisci were \nlords or military strategists before becoming vampires, and their experience \nserves the sect. Often, a crusade’s success or failure depends on vital informa- \ntion, such as what defenses aprince can call upon or which influential vampires \nmight sympathize with the Sabbat. This is the priscus’ true purpose: to \nmaximize on the flaws of the others through proven strategies. \nThe “generation gap” in the Sabbat shows very prominently in members’ \nreaction to prisci. No vampire has ever become a prisci with less than 200 years \nof service to the sect, and most are twice that old. The Sabbat’s elders generally \nfeel that prisci are reaping their due reward for long service; younger members \noften think that prisci coast on past glories at the expense of the vampires who \ngo out and get things done now. The truth of the matter is that young vampires \nrarely see the prisci in action. Devoted as they are to the regent and her support, \nmuch of the prisci’s responsibilities keep them out of contact with the foot \nsoldiers of the sect. These young Cainites aren’t completely incorrect, however. \nThe consistory does resemble an aristocratic “court,” as the vampires who \ncomprise it (including somecardinals) play at their own Jyhads. In anutshell, the \npriscus’ role is to ensure the Sabbat’s long-term success through good advice and \ncareful planning. Prisci typically maintain the social structure of the Sabbat as \nwell - \na priscus’ patronage is required to become an archbishop, for example, \nand the consistory selects its own members from lesser ranks of the sect. \nThe priscus automatically gains the Status Traits of Confirmed, Feared \nand Infamous upon taking office, and these can never be permanently removed \nwhile he retains his position. \nOnly a priscus can appoint or remove another vampire as priscus. This \ncosts one of the acting priscus’ own temporary Status Traits and usually \nhappens only after all prisci in the area agree. The appointment to priscus rank \nalways comes with assignment to a particular Sabbat leader. (The priscus may \nchange the affiliation when all parties agree or when the original leader \nperishes or loses office.) \nThe priscus can spend a temporary Status Trait to ignore an order given \nby any vampire of lower rank than the one the priscus serves. \nThe priscus can use his Status Traits for retests in Mental Challenges \ndirectly related to the advice he’s giving his leader - \ntesting an infiltration \nplan, for instance, or scouting out saboteurs. \nREGENT \nThe regent directs the entire sect, drawing on the support of her advisors \nto guide the whole Sabbat toward ultimate victory. In theory, she holds \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nabsolute power. In practice, subordinates often distort or just plain “lose” \norders they refuse to accept, and the regent’s power depends on her personal \nbase of support. Ideologically driven young vampires (and a few elders) make \ntheir rejection of the regent’s authority a point of doctrine: They accept the \nSabbat’s ideals and feel that no personal leader is compatible with the sect’s \nfounding principles. Less thoroughly independent vampires simply don’t trust \na high and remote commander to understand what their immediate situation \nmay require or forbid. \nThe regent is necessarily an old vampire, chosen from the ranks of \ncardinals by exhaustive competition, and generally spends much time in \ntorpor. The night-to-night governing of the sect depends on how her subordi- \nnates carry out the overall vision she gives them and how much of their own \ngoals they mix in. While awake, the regent must spend much of her time \nmeeting with sect leaders to hear their reports and lay out the grand strategy \nfor coming conflicts. Details come only after multiple layers of filtering, and a \nsensible regent assumes that she doesn’t know everything about what’s going \non. The routine struggle to preserve her position against rivals also consumes \na lot of attention, which further requires the scattered limbs of the sect to make \ntheir own way as best they can. \nThe regent’s nightly affairs consist primarily of entertaining sect luminar- \nies, hearing progress reports, plotting against other vampires (both in the sect \nand out) and deciding which tactical or strategic maneuvers to make. Add to \nthis list the incessant cultivation of influences, moving and counter-moving \nto keep one’s enemies at bay, presiding over n’tae and weathering the countless \nintrigues inherent to centuries among the undead. \nThe regent gains the Status Traits of Feared, Infamous, Proven and \nSupreme upon taking office, and these can never be permanently lost while she \nretains her position. \nThe regent can appoint and remove cardinals at the cost of one of her \nown temporary Status Traits. (In turn, the cardinals acting in unison appoint \nand remove the regent.) She can appoint and remove lesser officials at no cost \nto herself. \nThe regent can use her temporary Status Traits for retests in Mental \nChallenges related to her role as sect leader: Detecting plots against her, giving \ninstructions and so on. \nTITLES \nWhat follow are a few of the titles used by the sect, as well as common \nforms of address. While the titles themselves are male, the forms of address \nreflect the bearer’s gender; female forms of address are given in parentheses if \nthey differ from the masculine. Players and Storytellers should feel free to \ncreate their own titles and pack names as well - \nBrother Logan of the Grave \nRevenant Families Ciphers has a certain ring that Logan the Tzimisce from \nPack Number Three seems to lack. \nREVENANTS \nIn the early Middle Ages, a consortium of Tzimisce elders systematically \ninfused vitae into the blood of selected families of Eastern European nobility. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nOver the course of several generations, the revenant lineages emerged: Human \nbeings, mortal men and women, with vastly extended lifespan and innate \naffinities for some vampiric Disciplines. Revenants manufacture a unique \nvariation of vitae, sufficient to support their limited abilities even though it’s \ntoo weak for Cainite purposes. Some theorists believe that magical forces in \nthe revenant families’ homeland contribute to maintaining revenant powers; \narguments on the subject consume many a long night. \nThe original experiments produced more than a dozen revenant lineages. \nSome perished during the Inquisition and Anarch revolt. Two merged with \nsurviving families through intermarriage and lost any distinct identity. Rumors \nsay the Ducheski and Rustovitch lines broke away from the Tzimisce to serve \nother masters. Matching rumors credit Assamites, Setites, Giovanni and \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTremere with creating their own revenant lines. In any event, four revenant \nfamilies serve the Sabbat in the Final Nights. \nThe revenant families make Sabbat packs seem humane and psychologi- \ncally balanced by comparison. Incest runs rampant in all of them. So do \npedophilia, cannibalism and bestiality. Necrophilia and more esoteric vices \nturn up fairly regularly. Revenants who deal with mortal society gravitate \ntoward the most extreme political, religious and social views they can find, \ncontributing to the monstrous image such groups receive. Many revenants \nfollow Paths of Enlightenment rather than Humanity, and they actually start \noff with advantages in this direction. Unlike most vampires, they grow up \nsurrounded by the evidence of trans-human forces and powers, and they’re \nsharply aware of how different they are from the mortals around them. A \nrevenant may pass for normal more easily than a vampire can simply because \nthe revenant has breath and a pulse, but the revenant shouldn’t expect to \nplease many people with his perspective on the human condition. \nTHE REVENANT \nCONDITION \nIn most respects, revenants follow the same rules as other ghouls: assign \narevenant 6/4/3 Attributes, 5 Abilities, 5 Backgrounds and five freebie points. \nA revenant starts with one Trait in each of the Virtues and divides another five \npoints between them. (See “Path,” below, for revenant morality.) Most \nrevenant characters are a few decades old. With Storyteller approval, players \nmay buy extra age at the cost of one freebie point per full century. While \nrevenants naturally acquire many deficiencies of mind, body and spirit, the \nseven-point limit on Flaws and Negative Traits remains in effect for revenant \ncharacters. Revenants also have the following unique features: \nVitae. Each revenant produces one Blood Trait of weak vitae per night. \nThis is much weaker than Cainite vitae (even that of the thin-blooded). It \ncannot create other ghouls, help in Embracing a drained corpse or create blood \nbonds. It allows the revenant to use his Disciplines, heal injuries and boost \nAttributes temporarily. Each revenant has a Blood Pool of 10 Traits, plus one \nfor every full century he’s been alive. Revenants have no generation; they \ncannot Dominate Cainites, cannot diablerize and cannot be diablerized. \nPowers. The revenant family lineage provides each revenant with a set \nof “in-clan” Disciplines and a family weakness comparable to clan weaknesses. \nEach revenant begins with one level in one of the family’s Disciplines and can \nlearn more for the “out of clan” costs (4 experience points for basic Disciplines, \n7 for intermediate and 10 for advanced; revenants cannot learn Disciplines \nabove the advanced level). A revenant can only learn the first level of each \nDiscipline, plus one per full century: a 300-year old revenant can learn the \nsecond intermediate level of each family Discipline. \nPaths. Each revenant begins with one Trait in a Path (or, occasionally, \nHumanity, if the family allows it). Most revenants progress at about one Trait \nper full century. \nCREATIN~ \nREVENANTS \nThe details of revenant family creation vary; no clan does it quite like any \nother. All the various methods draw on common principles, and in terms of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ngame mechanics, they all work similarly. Note that these rituals all take a very \nlong time to work. They appear in most chronicles as part of the background \nunless the chronicle involves extended downtime. \nEach of the following rituals is an Advanced Thaumaturgical Ritual, \nrequiring the usual cost in experience points to learn. Finding a teacher for \nthem is generally hard. Very few vampires who know how to create revenant \nfamilies survive in the Final Nights. \nStimulation of the Male’s Essence \nYou work a change in the vitae of a male human who’s been ghouled by \na member of your clan. The subject male may thereafter mate with a female \nsubjected to Stimulation ofthe Female’s Essence (see below). Any offspring of the \nunion carry revenant potential. Spend two Blood Traits to enact the ritual, \nplus one per year you maintain the stimulation. \nStimulation of the Female’s Essence \nYou work a change in the vitae of a female human who’s been ghouled by \na member of your clan. The subject female may thereafter mate with a male \nsubjected to Stimulation ofthe Male’s Essence (see above). Any offspring of the \nunion carry revenant potential. Spend two Blood Traits to enact the ritual, \nplus one per year you maintain the stimulation. \nThe chances of ghouls reproducing are vanishingly small. The participat- \ning ghouls must win (not tie) a series of three Simple Tests against the \nStoryteller, plus one per generation of the vampire(s) performing the Stimula- \ntion rituals, for a potential fertilization to succeed and come to term. The \nresulting child manifests one Discipline chosen at random from the creating \nclan’s in-clan list, and one chosen at random, generally tuned to some aspect \nof the parents’ psychology. \nProtection of the Revenant Essence \nYou reinforce the revenant nature of each child born to properly prepared \nparents, manipulating its vitae to develop more intrinsic sympathy with its \nsomewhat vampiric nature. This is an extended process, requiring a full year \nof operation upon and instruction of the child. You must perform the ritual \nbefore the child reaches puberty, or it reverts to being a normal ghoul. Spend \ntwo Blood Traits at the consummation of the year-long ritual. Children \nsubjected to this ritual retain the two-Discipline limits described above, but \nreproduce more successfully upon mating with their own kind. The partici- \npants must win (not tie) a series of three Simple Tests against the Storyteller, \nplus a number of tests equal to half your generation. \nPerfection of the Revenant Essence \nThis ritual only works on third-generation and later revenants whose \nparents and grandparents were all born as revenants. You perform a final set of \nvitae manipulations that bring the full potential of the revenant into expres- \nsion. Like Protection of the Revenant Essence, this requires a full year with the \nchild before it reaches puberty. Spend two Blood Traits at the end of the year. \nIf you succeed in the ritual, the child manifests a third Discipline (the first child \nto do so sets the pattern for the family, and all subsequent offspring develop the \nsame set of Disciplines) and develops the range of revenant features described \nabove. Perfected revenants reproduce fairly easily upon mating with each \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nother; the participants must win or tie three Simple Tests against the Story- \nteller. \nThe nature of the rituals vary from clan to clan. Most clans perform \ndebased versions of fertility rites when enchanting female ghouls and dark \noath-swearing rituals involving swords (or impalement) when enchanting \nmale ghouls. The Tzimisce sometimes bury children being subjected to \nProtection or Perfection of the Revenant Essence in mounds of corpses for a day \nto infuse a post-mortem spirit and drive out some of the taint of mundane \nexistence. \nThe process of revenant creation necessarily involves a great deal of \ninbreeding. That’s one reason it takes so long. The vampiric creators must \nconstantly weed out the most defective individuals so as to keep the whole \nrevenant family from collapsing into disease and madness. The difficulties here \ncombine with the naturally low birthrate of potential and actual revenants to \nexplain why most efforts at creating revenants end in failure. \nNo new ghoul lineages can join a revenant family once the first child \nsuccessfully undergoes Perfection of the Revenant Essence. In the earlier stages, \nfresh ghouls can be brought in through stimulation of their respective essences \nand mated so as to create offspring suitable for Protection of the Revenant \nEssence. Some revenant families, especially the Bratovitches, kidnap and mate \nwith outsiders. This doesn’t produce revenant offspring, since the non- \nrevenant parent lacks any of the necessary preparatory steps and doing them \nnow wouldn’t change anything. It’s just one way to pass the time. They almost \nalways destroy the non-revenant offspring in short order, often by feeding such \nchildren to real members of the family. \nBRATOVITCH \nThe Bratovitches are the most rural, not to mention bestial, of the four \nfamilies. They maintain rural estates in very remote countrysides, as far as \npossible from civilization. Within their well-secured boundaries, the \nBratovitches breed hellhounds and other abnormal creatures with which they \nventure forth to hunt Lupines and the other enemies of the Sabbat. Apart from \nthese hunts, Bratovitches generally leave their estates only to act as guides for \nnomadic Sabbat packs and to kidnap brides and studs. \nThe family fulfills every stereotype of inbred, homicidal rural monsters \nand adds unique wrinkles of its own. North American Sabbat vampires \ndescribe Bratovitch enclaves as “like Deliverance, except not so nice” while the \nfamily’s ancestral holdings in Poland strike visitors as gatherings of cavemen \nwith the latest firepower. Bratovitches don’t care what others think about \nthem. They like being able to wrestle down every animal they can raise and \nbeing able to have sex with just about every orifice those wrestled-down \nanimals provide. The Sabbat seems to the Bratovitches like a bunch of big \nnasty uncles and aunts - \nneat and impressive but not around that much. \nMost Bratovitches live in rural North America, in mountain valleys and \nlong deserted stream channels where their pets have room to graze. The South \nAmerican settlements are mostly new - \nless than a century old - \nand \ngrowing slowly but steadily. The Polish homestead maintains a fairly constant \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsize, and has largely escaped the social upheavals of the post-Communist era \nsince it was never part of the society at large to begin with. \nThe family isn’t exclusively composed of hicks, despite being rural. The \nelders include many scholars of vampiric affairs, including some of the \nTzimisce’s most valuable research assistants on breeding projects. Established \nBratovitch settlements maintain well-stocked libraries. Bratovitch children \ngenerally get eccentric and ill-balanced educations, but those who want to \npursue book lore can develop a first-rate mastery of selected fields. \nNo Bratovitches follow Humanity. It just doesn’t work for them. The \nother Paths of Enlightenment all occur with roughly equal frequency, and \nsome scholarly minded members of the family preserve Paths that the Sabbat \ngenerally abandoned long ago. \nDisciplines: Animalism, Potence, Vicissitude \nWeakness: Bratovitches are psychotic and unstable. They take a two- \nTrait penalty in all tests related to resisting frenzy and suffer a one-Trait \npenalty on all social interactions with normal people. \nHellhounds \nThe Bratovitches perform extensive breeding and vitae manipulation of \ndogs to create special war-hounds for the Tzimisce and other members of the \nSabbat. The art of hellhound creation is a combined Discipline requiring \nmastery of both basic levels of Animalism and Vicissitude, so only Bratovitches \nover 200 can actually create hellhounds from regular dogs. Breeding existing \nhellhounds requires no special Disciplines, just a lot of courage and the ability \nto fix up the inevitable wounds. \nHellhounds have the following statistics: 10 Physical Traits, no Mental or \nSocial Traits, Alacrity and Swiftness (Celerity), Endurance and Mettle (Forti- \ntude) and Prowess and Might (Potence). A hellhound’s bite inflicts two levels \nof aggravated damage, and its claws inflict one level of aggravated damage \neach. A hellhound possesses the equivalent of four levels each of Brawl and \nDodge for retest purposes. Most hellhounds have the same health levels as \nvampires and 10 Blood Traits, though a few are stronger or weaker. \nHellhounds come in a variety of breeds, most heavily mixed. Whatever \ntheir canine ancestry, they look mean now. \nC~RIMALDI \nBefore their bargain with the Tzimisce, the Grimaldi family ran merchant \nhouses throughout the Italian city-states of the 12th century. They retain their \nflair for business, and are the most “normal” of the remaining revenant families. \nMost of their excesses fall within the general scope of self-indulgent behavior \non the part of the very, very wealthy. \nGrimaldi children grow up confident that they deserve the best and that \nthey’ll get it. They study at the finest schools and play with the most impressive \ntoys. As they mature, Grimaldis take on positions of increasing corporate or \npolitical responsibility. The family knows the dangers of power without \ncompetence, and family members start their climbs on ladders to power outszde \nfamily holdings. Once they’ve demonstrated their ability, then they take an \nappropriate place within the systems the family controls. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe Grimaldi family retains its connections to Italy; under their own \nname and a dozen other lineages the family’s married into, Grimaldis hold \noffices at city and provincial levels. They sit on the boards of directors for firms \nin many industrial sectors and serve throughout the Roman Catholic hierar- \nchy. There’s no real “center” to the family. Wherever family interests took past \ngenerations, there’s a current concentration of family influence, from Goa to \nNew York. \nThis spread of the family serves visible goals as well as a secret agenda \nknown only to family elders. The Grimaldi family leaders believe that the \nfamily survives only because of Tzimisce patronage. Should the Tzimisce ever \nwithdraw their protection, forces inside and outside the Sabbat would slaugh- \nter the family and seize its assets. The elders therefore quietly work on \ncontingency plans. Chosen agents negotiate with representatives of the \nCamarilla Ventrue and the Giovanni, discussing the terms under which those \nclans would find the family valuable enough to protect. \nIf news of these talks ever became public, the Tzimisce would immediately \nwithdraw their patronage and let the slaughter begin, so the elders involved \nkeep the matter secret from everyone else. Partly as misdirection, partly simply \nbecause it makes good sense, they do encourage their heirs to make ties with \nthe other Sabbat clans, particularly the newcomers, so as to strengthen bonds \nthat might prove useful in future calamities. The negotiating elders also keep \nthemselves away from direct contact with Sabbat vampires, to avoid the risk \nof inadvertent revelation. \nGrimaldi traditionally follow the Path of Honorable Accord or the Path \nof Power and the Inner Voice. In every generation, a handful follow the Path \nof Caine as best they can, given their inability to commit diablerie. This \ncentury, many Grimaldi have chosen to remain on the Path of Humanity, \nmuch to their elders’ distress. The advocates of the “humane” Grimaldi \nmovement explain that in an era of telecommunications, it’s harder to hide \nsigns of moral monstrosity. The Paths, the advocates say, reflect the opportu- \nnities and luxuries of a bygone age and are just bad business now. The Tzimisce \nwho monitor the family find this development distressing and cultivate \nsupporters of less humane strategies in the younger generations. \nDisciplines: Celerity, Dominate, Fortitude \nWeakness: All Grimaldi are blood bound to a Sabbat vampire of bishop \nrank or higher at puberty. The Sabbat started doing this to ensure the family’s \nloyalty in its extensive dealings with mortal society at large. It became a habit, \na sign of reaching adulthood in the eyes of the family and sect. The Sabbat rarely \nmakes use of these blood bonds. The family elders planning for defection \nregretfully regard their heirs bound to Tzimisce officials as acceptable losses: \nBetter to sacrifice the individuals blood bound recently enough that they would \nhave to obey Tzimisce orders than sacrifice the whole family for their sake. \nOBERTUS \nThe Obertuses survive on the basis of knowledge rather than wealth or raw \npower. They deal with the Sabbat at large as little as possible, maintainingregular \ncontact only with a handful of Tzimisce scholars. When they become revenants, \nthe Obertus family served as librarians and clerics in the northern reaches of the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nByzantine Empire. They congregated in the Tzimisce strongholds in eastern \nEurope for several centuries, then spread to the Americas with the Spanish and \nPortuguese empires. In the FinalNights, most of the family lives in New England \nand Canada’s eastern provinces. The family maintains smaller enclaves in South \nAmerica, particularly in Brazil, and in eastern Europe. \nOn all continents, the Obertuses prefer to live in small towns well \nremoved from commerce and other distractions. They enjoy the freedom to \nengage in their own pursuits free of distractions, without wishing to be as cut \noff as most Bratovitches. The Obertus family ethos promotes stable, secure, \ncomfortable living conditions as the foundation for the exhaustive, perenni- \nally innovative search for secret knowledge. Obertuses compete with each \nother to understand the unseen things of the world, all the hidden forces that \nshape the world outside mortal perception. Some enclaves train generation \nafter generation to study a single subject, like poltergeists or the cryptozoology \nof suburbia; others try to encompass under one roof a wide range of expertise. \nThe Tzimisce find little of this knowledge directly useful but appreciate the \nvalue of basic research. The next tremendously useful weapon in the War of \nAges could appear in almost any context - \nafter all, the Vinculum was once \njust a theoretical exercise in blood magic. \nThe Obertus elders have a secret project of their own, more devious and \nindependent than the Grimaldi elders’ scheme. The elders believe that \nrevenants, and in particular Homo obertus, constitute anew species destined to \nreplace Homo sapiens. The first evolutionary steps have been artificial, driven \nby Tzimisce manipulation. The Obertuses must find some way to make the \nrevenant transformation happen naturally, or at least without requiring \nvampiric participation. To establish a proper context for this master goal, the \nfamily elders sponsor covert examination of many variations on the Embrace \nand ghouling. They capture Camarilla and independent Kindred from time to \ntime and (more rarely) arrange the disappearance of Sabbat vampires who go \nto ground in Obertus-controlled towns. So far, results are patchy, consisting \nmostly of long lists of ways to make an Embrace or ghouling fail. The elders feel \nhopeful that the key breakthrough may come at any time. \nDisciplines: Auspex, Obfuscate, Vicissitude \nWeakness: The Obertuses were bred for intellectual ability without \nregard for stability, and are prone to psychological disorders. Each Obertus \nsuffers at least one derangement of an intellectual nature. Most Obertuses \nsuffer from the Obsessive/Compulsive Derangement, but characters may \ndevelop others with Storyteller approval. \nZANTOSA \nThe Zantosafamily were and remain aristocrats, wealthy lords of the social \nscene. They remain prominent in Eastern Europe and spread, over the \ncenturies, across the Atlantic. The family’s leaders never cared much for direct \npower and worried about money only so far as necessary to maintain their \nlifestyle. Lifestyle itself has always been the Zantosa concern. The Zantosas \nexist, they tell each other, to widen the boundaries of human experience until \none day they’ll have done everything a human being can do. They keep the \npeople around them stirred up in pursuit of the new, always seeking some fresh \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsensation not yet made routine and therefore safe. The Zantosas set the \nstandards others try to imitate. \nLiving on the edge carries certain risks, of course. Some Zantosas lose their \nstanding after getting caught in some behind-the-scenes crime like blackmail \nor graft. Some members of the family choose the wrong partners for their \nexploits and face the legal and social hassles that come with accusations of \npedophilia, necrophilia, sexual assault and other behavior most people haven’t \nyet learned to accept. Many Zantosas become so addicted to a particular habit \n(or drug) that they become boring, locked in asingle routine, no longer capable \nof or interested in innovation. In particularly tragic cases of self-inflicted \ntedium, the family quietly slaughters the offender to impress upon relatives the \nimportance of remaining the master of one’s habits rather than their servant. \nFew of the Zantosas’ social partners trust the family, and like all experimenters, \nthe family must avoid becoming so obnoxious that they lose the audiences they \nneed to complete the great work of experience. \nThe Zantosas have dealt with several of the clans from their first generations \nas revenants. The Toreador antinibu tend to like the Zantosas, trading insights \nand taking turns acting as subjects in group activities. The Ventrue antihibu \nregard the Zantosas as particularly decadent jesters who reinforce the antihibu \ninterest in preserving old power relationships inside new social forms. More \nrecently, the Serpents of the Light and the Zantosas have entered into close \nassociation, mingling cultural, religious and purely aesthetic explorations. \nIt’s been several generations since the presence of Zantosas could make or \nbreak a party in New York or Prague. Most of the family members now exist in \nfairly small sub-communities, dealing only with a handful of lineages that share \nthe Zantosa fascination with extremes. Some Zantosas of the last two genera- \ntions build elaborate false genealogies for themselves and then enter into high \nsociety as newcomers interested in “picking up the Zantosa legacy where those \nold fellows left off.” The family elders frown on this, fearing that pointless \ndeceptions could crumble and do harm to elaborate deceptions that actually \ndo advance family concerns. Zantosa children learn from their nannies and \nmentors never to waste an action: If it’s worth doing, it’s worth doing in a way \nthat makes an impact on someone. \nThe New York branch of the family suffered a severe setback in 1997, one \nthat’s had repercussions elsewhere. Two dozen family members, all in good \nstanding with the family (that is, practicing the right sorts of perversions and \ndegradations), suddenly found themselves denounced by family elders and \nexecuted. Sabbat inquiries produced the explanation that the elders uncov- \nered a nest of infernalists. The Zantosas frown on dealing with devils since \ndevils tend to want to impose their own aesthetics and interfere with the family \npursuits. The Sabbat Inquisition apparently found the answer satisfactory \nsince no vampiric investigation took place. Similar nests of infernalists turn up \nfrom time to time in other Zantosa communities; in each case, the Sabbat \nInquisition pronounces itself satisfied with the Zantosas’ own response. \nOnly the family elders know the real story. From the very beginning of the \nfamily’s revenant experience, the elders have guarded the body of a Tzimisce \nelder in very deep torpor. The body came with the first sizable contingent of \nZantosas to settle in New York and slept away the centuries there. One night, \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nwithout any sort of warning or disturbance, the body disappeared. The \ninfernalist story is an after-the-fact explanation for mysterious deaths inflicted \non elders who helped tend the body at some point. Quiet inquiries with the \nObertus (a painful matter for the Zantosas, who hate to admit the usefulness \nof anyone so boring) and occultists outside the Sabbat produce no clues as to \nthe identity of the presumably reawakened vampire. \nMost Zantosas pursue the Path of Cathari; many succeed in maintaining \nvery high ratings in it, thanks to the family’s accumulated wisdom in such \nmatters. More necrotically inclined individuals pursue the Path of Death and \nthe Soul. One rural Zantosa enclave whose members deal regularly with the \nBratovitches specializes in the Path of the Feral Heart, to the embarrassment \nof their relatives. No Zantosa admits to practicing the Path of Caine, despite \npersistent rumors of Noddists in the family and the demonstrable use of blood \nand vitae for more recreational ends. \nDisciplines: Auspex, Presence, Vicissitude \nWeakness: Nothing in Zantosa family training prepares its members to resist \ninteresting temptations. Whenever a Zantosa faces what looks like an interesting \nand intense pleasure, she must make a SelfConrrolor Instinct test, generally against \na difficulty of three Traits, to avoid wandering off to pursue it instead of what she \nhad been working on. Zantosas cannot spend Willpower to resist supernatural \nenticements as long as there’s a pleasurable component involved (bear in mind \nthat Zantosa notions of “pleasure” aren’t like most people’s). \nSZLACHTAAND \nVOHZD \nThe Tzimisce excel in the creation of highly specialized ghouls. Clan lore \nincludes the techniques for creating the slzuchta (guardian ghouls) and the \nvohzd (war ghouls). The Tzimisce make no particular effort to keep their \ntechniques secrets; the requirements, including Vicissitude and extensive \npractice, exclude anyone outside the clan. A non-Tzimisce would-be student \nwho wants to learn may or may not meet with a favorable response, depending \non the whim of the Tzimisce elders she meets, but it’s not usually due to a need \nfor secrecy. \nThe processes for both slzuchta and vohzd creation require the vampire to \nknow Bonecraft and to possess at least two levels of the Crafts Ability with a \nfocus in Body Crafting. \nPLAYINC~ \nSPECIALIZED \n~ H O U L S  \nNeither szlachta nor vohzd make suitable player characters. Specialized \nghouls undergo a level of distortion and transformation that renders them \neffectively mindless in normal terms - \nthey possess even less independent \nconsciousness than someone subjected to Conditioning. Specialized ghouls \nshould only be Storyteller characters, and when they do appear in your \nchronicle, emphasize their alien nature. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSZLACHTA \nThe slzachta serve as soldiers, bodyguards and sentries. Each szlachta \nemerges from its creator’s laboratory unlike any other, since the process \nrequires handwork. Some features are fairly standard despite the variations. \nA typical szlachta has spikes, armored plates or both. The Tzimisce \ncreating the ghoul removes all unnecessary fat, or transfers it to areas where \nextra padding might come in handy, such as over vital organs. Most Tzimisce \nreplace the ghoul’s entire skin with something tougher while some add on extra \nlayers to create whole-body calluses or otherwise increase the ghoul’s capacity \nto resist wounds. Almost all s ~ & ~ h t a  \npossess armored sensory organs with \nincreased sensitivity, so as to make better observers. \nTo reduce the ghoul’s automatic resistance to modification, most Tzimisce \nstarve their subjects before setting to work. Some creators outright attack their \ncreations-to-be, using injury to further weaken the target body’s defenses. \nEach of the following transformations requires a successful Mental Chal- \nlenge against the target’s current health levels (the creator may use Body \nCrafting for a retest) and a Physical Challenge with Bonecraft. \nArmor. The target gains one health level of all-body armor or two levels \nof armor for one specific part of the body (head, torso, arms, etc.). If the creator \nwins both challenges, the armor adds no Negative Traits; if the creator ties, the \narmor works as usual but the target gains the Negative Trait ofHeavy. After the \nthird level of Heavy, the s&chta can carry no more armor. \nOrganic Weapons. The target does an extra level of lethal damage with \neach strike in hand-to-hand combat. Depending on the creator’s taste, the \nweapons might be spikes, fangs, exuded poisons or something else. (Note that \nmost poisons don’t work against vampires; the creator should plan based on the \ncircumstances she expects her creation to face.) If the creator ties either \nchallenge, the target gains the Negative Trait of Clumsy; after the third level \nof Clumsy, the target cannot engage in tasks requiring fine manipulation and \ncan receive no more weaponry. \nEnhanced Sense. The target gains the equivalent of one level of the \nAcute Sense Merit (see Laws of the Night, p. 112). If the creator ties either \nchallenge, the target also gains a 2-Trait penalty on all uses of one of its other \nsenses. A creator attempting to compensate for such deficiencies must use this \nprocess to undo the flaw before attempting to boost the impaired sense. This \nrequirement can, given bad luck, turn into an endless spiral of sensory \ndegeneration. It’s one of the most common reasons creators destroy otherwise \nsatisfactory szlachta. \nEnhanced Speed. The target can take two extra steps during combat \nmovement. This change involves lengthening the target’s legs and changing \nthe ratio of upper limb to lower limb length as well as modifying leg and hip \njoints. If the creator ties either challenge, the target becomes imbalanced and \nmust win or tie a Simple Test to avoid falling over when it comes to rest after \na period of motion. Each additional level of this complication requires the \ntarget to win or tie another Simple Test when stopping. After developing the \nneed to perform three Simple Tests every time it stands still, the target can \nreceive no more speed enhancements. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nProgrammed Ability. This modification is a combination of preparing \nspecialized physical features and mental condition; the creator must know \nConditioning as well as the basic requirements for creating szlachta. The target \ngains two levels in one ability related to its basic nature, such as a weapon skill \nor Alertness. If the creator ties either challenge, the target also develops the \nFugue Derangement (see Laws of the Night, p. 213). Each additional level of \nthis complication subtracts 1 from the target’s Mental total for the challenge \nto resist the fugue state. After getting a 2-Trait penalty, the target cannot \nreceive further ability programming. \nThe creator can attempt one modification per night, plus one for each level \nof Body Crafting she possesses beyond the two required to make srlachta at all. \nSZLACHTA \nIN PLAY \nSi&chta remind young vampires of H.R. Geiger paintings come to life. \nGuardian ghouls lack most normal facial features and cannot easily express the \nlimited range of emotions they do feel. Creators who turn captured mortals \ninto srlachta and send the new ghouls as weapons against the mortals’ allies do \nmake sure to leave a few distinctive features visible. People who knew the \ns7Jahtarecognize it upon succeeding in a Static Mental Challenge against four \nTraits. The horror of identifying a former friend or ally under these circum- \nstances requires a 3-Trait Courage test to resist the impulse to flee. \nUnless you happen to have players who are skilled contortionists, it \ntakes costuming, props and a measure of imagination to portray szlachta in a \ngame session. Dark clothing, presented in low light, helps hide the player’s \nown body contours. Also, never underestimate the effects of careful posture \n- \nlook into how stage actors portray characters like the Elephant Man and \nShakespeare’s Richard 111. \nVOHZD \nFew vampires make vohzd anymore, just as few vampires build castles \nanymore. The titanic war ghouls come from an age when the Tzimisce strode the \nCarpathian landscape as absolute masters, free from fear of mortal hunters or \neven vampiric rivals. In the age of organized vampire hunters, satellite imagery \nand portable anti-tank weaponry, war ghouls create more problems than they \nsolve. Since vampires seldom completely abandon any practice once they take \nit up, a handful of creators do continue to make vohzd in the Final Nights. \nAlmost all vohzd are team projects. It takes time and effort to reassemble \ncomponents into the final form, and teamwork reduces the risk of components \ngoing bad, suffering accidental damage or otherwise wasting the creator’s work. \nThe construction of a war ghoul begins with at least 15 regular ghouls, \nwhether human or animal. The creators force them all to drink each others’ \nblood in a Vaulderie-like ritual. (If you need rules for this, require the creators \nto win Mental Challenges with Intimidation or some Discipline suitable for \nissuing simple commands.) The creators then disassemble their targets with \nVicissitude, sometimes using Thaumaturgy for assistance. To simulate the effects \nof Vicissitude surgery, keep track of the damage that the creators would \nnormally inflict with Fleshcraft and Bonecraft attacks. The target takes no \nactual damage from this manipulation; when it reaches zero health levels, it \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncomes apart in surgically tidy components. These pieces of ghouls generally \nsurvive in storage for about one night per level of the creator’s Body Crafting \nability - \nless in adverse conditions, more in places with provision for storing \norganic materials like meat. \nVivisected ghouls provide one component each for sensory purposes - \neach head yields up just one useful set of sensory organs- along with two useful \nlimb components, and a number of “general” components equal to half their \nhealth levels. General components provide the skeleton, musculature and \ninternal organs necessary to make the new amalgamated organism work \nproperly. \n“Component” as a term reflects the Tzimisce attitude toward their work. \nWhen describing these pieces of people and animals in play, reinforce the idea \nthat each component is a still-living piece of an organism. It pulses slowly; eyes \nstare blindly; fingers and toes twitch without conscious control. The mystical \nproperties of Vicissitude and Body Crufting produce seamless barriers of flesh \nover the points where one body part was severed from another. The resulting \nmasses shouldn’t live at all. Storytellers should feel free to require Conscience or \nCourage checks for bystanders to remain calm in the presence of vohzd creation \nin progress. Prop cards don’t do justice to the experience. Very minimal props \ncan add a lot, such as cardboard boxes covered with appropriate photographs \nto illustrate the body parts involved. \nOnce the creators have their initial set of components, they begin \nreassembling bits. The vohzd automatically develops Potence and Fortitude \nequal to twice the highest level possessed by any of the ghouls providing \ncomponents. Its blood pool also equals twice the largest blood pool of any of \nthe component ghouls. Vohzd generally move at half normal human speed \n(one step walking or two steps running per action). \nThe creators must decide on a single individual to act as the vohzd’s \ncontroller. The war ghoul has scarcely any mind to speak of, and responds only \nto commands of three words or less from the controller. Tzimisce war leaders \ngenerally starve their vohzd before a battle and then point the hungry war \nghouls at enticing vitae- or blood-rich targets. The vohzd’s mindless, alien \ncondition makes it immune to Animalism, Dominate and Presence. \nEach of the following transformations requires the creator to make a \nPhysical Challenge with Bonecraft to insert the components correctly. Failure \nrenders the component useless; the creator must discard it and try again. \nGeneral framework. Two general components fused together give the \nvohzd one health level. Keep track of the total health levels of the work in \nprogress and follow this progression: Healthy, Bruised, Wounded, Incapaci- \ntated, Healthy, Bruised, Wounded. A vohzd with five health levels (from 10 \ngeneral components) has Healthy, Healthy, Bruised, Wounded, Incapaci- \ntated. A vohzd with 10 health levels (from 20 components) goes all the way \nthrough the cycle and starts over again, ending up with Healthy, Healthy, \nHealthy, Bruised, Bruised, Bruised, Wounded, Wounded, Wounded, Inca- \npacitated. The vohzd must have at least as many components dedicated to \ngeneral framework as it has components allocated to specific purposes. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBlood Pool. One general component dedicated to the task of holding \nblood increases the vohzd’s blood pool by one. \nDisciplines. Two sensory components taken from ghouls who knew \nFortitude or Potence provide the brain matter and lingering soul traces to raise \nthe vohzd’s level of one of those Disciplines by one. \nMovement. Four limb components increase the vohzd’s walking speed \nby one step per turn, up to a maximum of twice normal human speed. Yes, these \nare multiple legs. \nArms. Two limb components provide the material for one arm and the \nnecessary attachments. This is a standard human-type arm, doing one level of \nbashing damage. Each extra limb component included in this step can add one \nof the following: The ability to inflict Lethal damage, the ability to inflict one \nextra health level of damage or increasing the limb’s reach by three feet. \nArmor. Three general components provide enoughraw material to give \nthe vohzd one level of armor, as long as it has 10 or less health levels. Add \nanother two general components for every 10 health levels after that. \nEach creator can attempt one modification per night, plus one for each level \nof Body Crafting she possesses beyond the two required to make vohzd at all. \nVOHZD \nIN PLAY \nVohzd horrify everyone who sees them, and it takes time to get used to \nthem. Anyone seeing a vohzd for the first time must make a Courage test against \nfive Traits to avoid running in terror. Each time a character succeeds in \novercoming her fear of the war ghoul, reduce the difficulty of future tests by one \nTrait; when the difficulty falls to zero, the character finally takes such things \nfor granted. A point of Willpower allows a retest on these challenges. \nVohzd often include multiple arms spread more or less evenly around the \nmain torso. A vohzd gets one attack to its front, one to its rear, and one to one \nside or the other. Depending on how much of a head its creator gave it, these \nlabels may be fairly arbitrary; assume that “front” is the direction the vohzd last \nmoved, in the absence of more permanent physiological markers. Each arm \nbeyond the second on that side of the vohzd adds two bonus Traits in combat; \neach leg beyond the second adds one bonus trait in close combat. \nPresenting vohzd in your chronicle is very easy to do poorly. A bunch of \nplayers under a sheet and shuffling around seldom looks horrifying. Expect \nplayers to need to use their imagination to fill in the gaps, whatever you decide \nto do. A group of players wearing similar dark colors, roped together or moving \nin coordination and given the benefit of backlighting can create a startling \nimpression if nobody gets the time to examine them in detail. Mannequin parts \nare unfortunately expensive, but if you have connections to someone in retail \nsupply or other suitable source, extra arms and legs waving at the edges of the \nmass can be very startling, particularly if they’re clothed like the people \nholding them. \nKeep in mind that vohzd are big. Their creators store them in barns and \nremote valleys, not closets or phone booths. As far as your game space allows, \narrange a suitably large area for the vohzd to occupy. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nStorytelling a Sabbat chronicle is something that should be approached with \nmore preparation than average. Sabbat material is frankly adult, filled with \nshocking themes, disturbing sights and a streak of amorality that can be misun- \nderstood without proper acclamation. This is not the place for the inexperienced \nor immature. \nBecause the vampires of the Sabbat are seen as callous, inhuman beasts, they \nare often given minor plots in live-action roleplay, complete with a three-digit \nbody count. While such games are occasionally amusing in the same way that, say, \na shoot ‘em up arcade game is amusing, they are rarely a basis for a long-term \nstoryline. The Sabbat can be challenging to portray, but challenges provide some \nof the most rewarding play. In this chapter, we’ll be giving you some ideas and \nsuggestions to help you run your own Sabbat chronicles. \nIf you are about to venture into the realm of Storytelling for the first time, \nyou will certainly find it helpful to read the chapter on Storytelling in Laws of \nthe Night if you haven’t already done so. It will give you all the basics about \nbookkeeping, theme, mood, structure and plot, and it will help you make more \nsense of what you’ll be reading here. For those who are already familiar with the \nins and outs of Storytelling, prepare to take the next step into something a little \nlarger. \nTHE \nREALLY IMPORTANT \nS ~ ~ f i f i  \nIt should go without saying that Sabbat chronicles delve into the darkest \nparts of the psyche. This is the place where you start conjuring up some very nasty \ndemons, figuratively speaking - \ncomplete disregard for human life, glorying in \natrocity and an utter lack of what are considered normal values such as compas- \nsion. Storytellers in Sabbat chronicles take on more than just plots and themes. \nIt is vitally important for a Storyteller to always be in touch with her players and \ndoubly so with Sabbat material. Is one player getting unnerved by the material, \nanother one taking things a little too seriously, or are there Masquerade problems? \nGuess what - \nthey’re yours to deal with. \nPlayers who are getting unnerved by Sabbat material can be fairly easy to spot - \nthey have trouble joining in the games or rim, even when their characters are being \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nridiculed, or they seem enthused to be with the game until things start getting hairy. \nTouch base with the player inquestion and ask if things are all righr. Don’t pry or push, \nbut make it clear that you’re open to what he has to say. Once you learn what the \nproblem is, ask him for suggestions about what he’d like to do about it. Consider other \nthings for the player to do- it’s unlikely he wants to chuck the whk game, just parts \nof it. Is he interested in the spirituality and social interaction? Encourage him to hang \nout with the Noddists and priests. Is someone going out of her way to harass him? \nDiscipline the errant player. Is someone handling sensitive material, such as religion \nor sex, inappropriately? Lay down the law on treating the game with respect. This is \nsupposed to be fun, and when players are uncomfortable about the material, then they \naren’t having fun. \nOn the flip side, there are those who think a Sabbat chronicle is an excuse \nto go completely wild. These are more than just “gun bunnies.” They do \neverything in their power to shock their fellow players, from juvenile gross-outs \nto excessive profanity to profoundly insulting others’ beliefs. Not a few take up \ninfemalism for fun and profit and take pleasure in killing other characters. When \nconfronted with their behavior, they claim that they’re merely acting in the spirit \nof the chronicle- it’s adult material, they say, and if you can’t stand the heat, you \nbetter stay out of the kitchen. Such behavior is hardly the hallmarkof the mature \nplayer. Don’t tolerate this a minute longer than you see it. Such behavior is \ndangerous to your other players and to your chronicle, both from a story point of \nview andfromamoremundaneview.Youdon’twantthese \njokers tobe whatnon- \nplayers see of your game. If they can’t treat mature material in a mature fashion, \ndon’t hesitate to throw them out. \nLastly, there are those matters which are sometimes termed “Masquerade” \nproblems. This is when the real world and the game world collide, with unpleasant \nresults. A case in point occurred at a convention where a Sabbat chronicle was \nbeing run. Two players, in character at the time, were overheard by a maid \ndiscussing the vivisection of a hotel worker. The maid was naturally disturbed and \nbrought it to the attention of management, who subsequently came looking for \nthe convention staff. People don’t treat such things as murder, torture and the like \nlightly, not in these days of domestic terrorism. Be extremely careful where you \nplay and where you discuss your game. Sabbat themes and material sound \nfrightening to the average listener and can lead to panic when people aren’t \nentirely aware of the situation. \nThese aren’t meant to put a damper on your fun; they’re meant as a safety net \nso you can keep having fun without getting hurt. Respect the material and your \nplayers, and everyone will have a good time. \nSABBAT \nCHRONICLES \nThe plots, themes, goals and drives of a Sabbat chronicle are very different \nfrom those of a Camarilla story. Sabbat ideology demands a more straightforward \napproach to matters - \nat least, on the surface. A Sabbat chronicle is not merely \na morass of combat in an urban hellhole setting with some “nasty bits” thrown in. \nA Storyteller who approaches it thusly is cheating the players (and herself) of the \nchance to tell some very unique and exciting stories. \nERESH MEAT \nOne of the most rudimentary and yet compelling elements of the Sabbat is \nthe theme of brotherhood. All Sabbat characters are expected to be, or to soon \nbecome, members of a pack. These packs are small cells of individuals, pressed \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ntogether through circumstance and, occasionally, choice, dedicated to their own \ngoals as well as the goals of the sect. Though the Vaulderie and Vinculum provide \nsome artificial ties of closeness, there are still squabbles between “brothers and \nsisters,” nodifferently thanamong mortal siblings (with the exception that mortal \nsiblings don’t call on supernatural powers to put someone through a wall for \ndisagreeing with them). \nWhen a new character enters the chronicle, some thought must be given \ntoward her “pack.” Is she nomadic? Founded? Is she the lone survivor of a recently \nfallen pack? It’s extremely unusual for a Sabbat to be without a pack for more than \na few weeks. During that time, characters should be antsy and strained. Only \nthrough the repetitive bond of the Vaulderie are they safe from the overwhelming \npower of the Antediluvians and their blood bond. \nThe pack structure allows you a convenient method to integrate new \ncharacters into the venue. By placing an inexperienced player in an established \npack, the Storyteller allows the pack to teach its “fledgling,” and the new player \nis instructed by more experienced players. If one member of the pack has a reason \nto be involved in an ongoing plot, the rest of the pack will almost certainly become \ninvolved - \nwillingly or not. \nINTRIgUB \nAlthoughtheSabbat is theoretically bound togetherwithasingleoverwhelming \nblood bond, the actual strength of that bond varies from individual to individual - \neven from month to month. At the moment when a character is relying on the total \nsupport of their pack, a traitor may break through the c o h e s  of the Vinculum and \nstab the metaphorical knife into the back of those who trusted him. Remember, also, \nthat the Sabbat is a place of brotherhood, however enforced, and it can hamstring as \noften as it helps. At the moment when a character’s revenge is about to be complete, \nhe could find himself unable to strike. \nA total disregard for mortal life does not mean a disregard for all life. \nCharacters should have goals, dictated by their backgrounds, their Paths and, \nmore importantly, by the constraints of the sect. As the game develops, look for \nplot points that can create intrigue between characters. Are there two Noddists \nlooking for the same, one-of-a-kind occult item? Do you have several members on \nthe Path of Power and the Inner Voice striving for position and rank? There’s \nnothing wrong with conflicting goals, so long as one remembers that loyalty to the \nsect should always come first - \nor at least, it should always appear to come first. \nIf you seem to be loyal, then you are treated as such. If you appear to be the \nstrongest, or the most capable, then your position is more stable. It’s all about \nappearances, from the archbishop trying to look like she’s completely in com- \nmand to the newest Pander recruit who’s trying desperately to show off how tough \nshe is. \nThe Sabbat is not merely asect offanatics anxiously awaiting thenext excuse \nto start a killing spree. It is a motley of liars, manipulators and powermongers who \nfurther their personal goals and ambitions in the name of “the good of the sect” \namidst devout believers and wild-eyed rowdies. Making this key distinction \nchanges a Sabbat game from an excuse for mass slaughter to something with much \nmore depth. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSETTING \nMany Sabbat games begin with the description of a horrific setting. No one \nknows how anything got there or why, but it’s assumed that this is how things are done \nin the Sabbat: Y“Yu enter the chamber and see the mutilated bodies of five adults \nhanging from the ceiling. Their blood drains slowly into a large pool below. The \ndripping is the only sound you hear.” While the inhumanity of the Sabbat is a theme \nthat should be brought out, the players are going to become more jaded than their \ncharacters unless some real thought is put into the backdrop. \nThink creatively. Why is this particular scene here? What purpose does it \nserve? What should the characters and players be getting from this?Consider the \nscene described above. If thrown into the middle of the evening to “liven things \nup,” it may go to waste -just \none more act of mindless brutality to which you \ndon’t want your players to become jaded. On the other hand, it can serve your \nstory by enhancing some part of it. Perhaps it’s the remains of an interrupted Blood \nBath (so where is the recipient of the bath?). Better still, perhaps it’s an illustration \nof a particular Sabbat bishop’s cruelty or of some Toreador antitn’bu’s latest work. \nFromaphysicalstandpoint, a Sabbat game need not mean that allyour games \ntake place in grungy alleys or nightclubs of thundering music. The chosen \ngathering place may reflect the bishop’s taste for meditative silence and study, or \na pack may be hosting the gather and has set the tone of the place by putting out \ntrophies of their successes and achievements. Set up lights with red bulbs and lay \nout dark bed sheets to indicate pools of blood when it’s time for a more frightening \nscene, or set up colored cellophane to show where aceremonial bonfire is burning. \nThe Sabbat has many opportunities for exciting and involving storylines \nthat can be easily inserted into a long-term campaign. Below, you’ll find some \nexamples and ideas to get you started. These are by no means the only stories you \ncan tell in this venue. Use your creativity, your imagination and the stories that \nyour players write as backgrounds for their characters to create and intricate and \ninvolved setting. Does one of your Brujah antitn’bu have a mortal enemy in the \nCamarilla? What if the Lasombra’s old flame on the other side had become \nattached to that character, but neither party knows? \nThere are several themes that are most appropriate for a Sabbat chronicle and \ncan be highly useful when planning a story for your assembled characters. Theme \nis the most important part of your story- it is the organizing principal, the thread \nthat ties together the errant parts into a unified whole. However, the Sabbat is a \ngame about the absence ofhumanity and agroupof individuals who have willingly \ngiven up their humanity. Alter common themes to accurately reflect the setting. \nHere are a few examples, using the themes mentioned in Laws of the Night, \nwith some slight modifications: \nh\ne\n \n-The Sabbat is usually no place for love, although the heightened blood \nbond of the Vinculum can substitute. Love, even if created by an artificial source, \ncan alter actions and create tension. What would we sacrifice for love? When the \nVinculum becomes too strong, will a pack willingly separate in order to follow the \ncommands of their leader? Worse, what if a packmate was guilty of some terrible \ncrime against the sect? Would his loyal (and loving) packmates cover up the crime \nor answer for it themselves in order to free him? \nTHEMES \nNEW AND OLD \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nHate - \nHatred runs strong in the Sabbat, particularly when it is thrust \noutward, toward the members of the Camarilla and other threats. How can hate \nbe used to drive the character’s motivations? What if two individuals who hated \none another were forced to Vaulderie and gained a blood bond to one another? \nHow will they resist the call of blood in order to fulfill their grudge? \nBetruyal- Whena member of the sect breaks the rules, it is the responsibility \nof the entire Sabbat to hunt her down. Use betrayal themes to bring warring \nfactions together and give them a single enemy to dedicate their combined efforts \nagainst. At what price will acharacter’s betrayal affect those who were once close \nto her? \nRevenge - \nAny creature as long-lived as a vampire is bound to have made \nenemies, both inside and outside of the sect. When those enemies come to take their \nrevenge, they will not stop at the individual, but will seek to annihilate those closest \nto her as well. Further, when a pack is formed, the enemies of a single member \nbecome enemies of the pack, and, as such, can provide asingle goal for the characters \nto attain together. The pack is a strong support for player interaction, particularly \nwhen your game relies heavily on the theme of revenge. \nRebellion - \nRebellion is one of the most dangerous themes in the Sabbat. \nThe various political factions can be used to great advantage, forcing characters \nto choose between their loyalty to the sect and their dedication to the ideal of true \nfreedom. Unlike the Camarilla, where revolutions are usually bloody affairs, the \nSabbat must handle them with increasing delicacy and intrigue, especially where \nthe Vinculum is concerned. \nMorality -Alternately, \nthe theme of morality can be the theme of anti- \nmorality, and the price paid for escaping the bonds of humanity. What happens \nwhen the leadership of a certain area forces characters to accept an alternate Path \nof Enlightenment? What if the chosen Path of the archbishop is Cathari in a \nregion predominated by Power and the Inner Voice? Who determines the correct \nPath and to what effect? \nBUILD IN^ A STORY \nAll good stories come in stages, from the carefully plotted beginning to the epic \nending of the tale. Many of these focus heavily on conflict, either interpemnal feuds \nor full-scale wars, and in the Sabbat, such conflicts are often quite violent. Because \nSabbat chronicles can be violent in nature, players and storytellers alike should be \nprepared to adjust their plotlines for a constantly changing character base. Still, the \nbasic plot structure -opening, climax and denouement - \nprovides milestones for \nthe story that you’re creating, whether the story’s climax comes in the form of a \nvaluable clue or the defeat of an enemy’s guardian. \nOne good example of a Sabbat storyline, particularly one in which both sides of \nthe story can be played, is the siege. Whether a Sabbat force has decided to wrest a city \nfrom Camarilla (or anarch) control, or the Sabbat is fighting against a Camarilla \ninvasion of their territory, the siege plotline offers character development, action, \nintrigue and deception - \nin short, opportunities for stories. \nOverall, establishing the timing and pacing of a single story and the stages of \na more epic plot are very similar. In fact, when you are dealing with a large-scale \nplot, it is best to think of it in terms of a series of smaller events, to help give \nperspective and make an enormous task a little easier. In the Siege example, the \nStoryteller creates a larger story arc, which the players interact with (and may \naffect) though smaller vignettes and scenes. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nOpening \nFirst, spend time researching your chosen city, whether it is the actual city \nyou are running your game in or a separate location. If you and the players are \nfamiliar with the location, challenges and benefits of a particular setting will \nbecome important to the plot. Los Angeles, for example, is a much different \nlocation for a siege than Charleston and will have a much different feel and \npacing. Spend some time preparing the introduction to your story: Has the local \ncardinal declared war on the Camarilla in this city or are the the character’s \ncombined packs proving their worth to the Sabbat by assaulting a known \nCamarilla haven? Are the characters present because of duty or coincidence? A \nbriefing on the city’s current Cainite politics and organization, however brief or \nvague, gives the players a starting place for roleplaying. Further, if characters are \ninterested in running brief preludes, arrange scouting missions that detail certain \nareas of the city or gather important information they can disseminate at the \nopening game. \nDunng the latter stages of the opening, the Storyteller should make every effort \nto establish the enemy’s strengths, weaknesses and ties within the city. Once the \ncharacters know who and what they are fighting, they can begin to understand the \nimportance of their actions and generate new ideas to propel the siege forward. \nScoutingpaaiesbecomeraidingparties, striking against valuable positions withinthe \ncity and tearing down Camarilla bastions. Internal debates and arguments within the \nsect become significant power struggles, determining the path of the siege. Two \ncourses of action may be equally valid, but who has more political clout to force her \nideas through? Anddon’t forget that the enemy canstrike back-setbacks \nand losses \nmark this time as much as wins and triumphs. \nC1’ imax \nWhen the players have done a significant amount of research into the \ndifficulties facing them, they are ready to confront them. Such actions deter- \nmine the climax of a story - \nthe assault, and the victory (or failure) against \nopposition. This is your story’s high point, the point toward which your players \nhave been traveling. In a siege storyline, the initial climax might be the first \nmajor battle against the Camarilla. Powerful forces, from prisci to the Black \nHand’s seraphim, may be involved in the battle -even if they choose to engage \nthe enemy from behind a deceptive screen. Characters may battle for position, \nusing their victories as leverage against weaker opponents, or may use the battles \nagainst the Camarilla as a convenient excuse to take care of another enemy. \nThe battle may be a single tremendous fight or, more likely, a series of waves \nas the Sabbat sends in packs of shock troops to break down the Camarilla’s \ndefenses. The siege will need infiltrators to tear apart the Camarilla’s bonds of \nloyalty from the inside even as War Parties gather to destroy the city from the \noutside. Conversions are forced, defenses shattered, allies lost, and the story races \nheadlong to the penultimate confrontation with the prince and her strongest \nallies. \nIf the opening of the story was sufficiently intriguing, and the characters are \nalready involved in the plot, there should be little need for you to guide the climax. \nPlayer involvement is always stronger than Storyteller character commands, and \nwhencharacters are initiating subplots, give them plenty of leash to runon; they’ll \ntake care of themselves just fine. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDenouement \nAfter the climax, the story winds down. Players and characters alike gather \nto count the dead and honor the living. The Sabbat has either won the city or lost \nthe siege. Tensions begin to ease, and story pieces begin to come together. It is \nimportant that both players and characters understand the resolution of the plot; \nthey should feel as if they have accomplished something, as if they have somehow \nmade an impact on the world around them. Remember to note the parts of your \nplot that your players missed - \nsuch openings can create all new plots. \nThere will certainly be new struggles within the sect to fill positions suddenly \nemptied by war and to claim power within the new hierarchy. Those packs who \nwish to set up permanent residency within the city must claim their territories, \nand there will be heartfelt farewells for those that seek to move on. \nSUB p LOTS \nPropaganda can serve an important purpose in a Sabbat chronicle. One odd \nfact about most players is their ability to solve conflicts (which, after all, are often \nthe focus of stories). However, occasionally players can take their drive to bring \npeace a bit too far. The Sabbat is a dangerous place, and promises and political \nconcessions are not easy ways to mollify enemies. A good storyteller will keep \nrelations between the Sabbat and the Camarilla in constant turmoil, using small \nplot twists to throw the two factions against one another, at least in the \nbackground. Although war does not have to be a major theme in the plotline, it \nis aconstant thought in the minds of all Sabbat vampires and should be recognized \nas such. The Storyteller should maintain walls of propaganda and misinforma- \ntion, attacking the base philosophies of both sects so that no possibility of \nreconciliation is possible. \nThe internal corruption within the Sabbat provides for constant minor \nsubplots and conflicts. Corruption eats at the very heart of the sect, dissolving it \nfrom within as well as without. The Lasombra and Tzimice fight for control, as the \nless populous clans ally and struggle against one another. The rise of the Panders \nhas thrown the hearts of the inner courts into turmoil, and the friction between \njealous leaders can lead to constant power struggles between their domains. \nAlthough loyalty and freedom are the sect’s catchwords, too often leadership \nbecomes the iron fist of rulership, and being considered disloyal is enough to \nensure one’s destruction. \nOccult ties, particularly through the more unusual bloodlines and back- \ngrounds of the sect, also make interesting and unusual subplots. Certainly, the \nLasombra have been deeply involved in church politics almost from the inception \nof Christianity; their vaults are crammed with the prizes of hundreds of years of \ninfiltration, from relics to texts to forgotten lore. The Tzimisce cling to the mystic \nties of their homeland while the Kiasyd and Harbingers of Skulls probe into the \nmysteries of this world and the next. Though the Sabbat flaunts and brags of its \nsuperiority, they are well aware that there are mysteries and secrets beyond their \nreckoning. If nothing else, the recent loss of the Tremere untihibu has convinced \nthem of that. \nC o NELI CTS \nSabbat stories, like all good plots, should revolve around conflict. Heroes \nneed antagonists, and even villains have enemies. Most stories take the hero out \nof the ordinary world and place her within an alien landscape, trusting on her \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nactions to define her purpose and nature. The World of Darkness provides the \nsetting; the Sabbat provides the goals and drive. Still, a character is partially \ndefined by her enemies, so we’ve provided a few sketches of ideas and opponents \nthat often come into a Sabbat chronicle. Many of these are large story hooks: a war \nwith the Camarilla won’t vanish after a single individual is killed - \neven if it is \nthe prince, nor will werewolves casually forget that their Kinfolk were murdered \nduring Sabbat ria. \nTHE \nSABBAT \nAS HEROES \nDifficult as it may be to imagine, the Sabbat are heroes in their environment. \nThey believe that their fight lies against an opponent that wishes to destroy the \nworld. They see the Camarilla as pawns of a greater power, and, not unlike the \nAmerican colonists, they fight against the might of an established group that \nclaims power by no recognized right. With each victory, they free the vampires \nof the Camarilla from the Jyhad by conversion or death. \nWhile some players prefer to be the villain or anti-hero of the story, many \nplayers do want to be the heroes. Even in a Sabbat chronicle, players should be \ngiven opportunities for their characters to behave in a heroic manner, defending \ntheir comrades, goals and beliefs. One of the ways to accomplish this is by creating \nacity background for your players that gives them a natural enemy: the Camarilla. \nRestoring a city to Sabbat control can involve conversion, battle and other \nexciting adventures, and is a good place to begin a long-term Sabbat chronicle. \nIt can be a refreshing change of pace to be on the other side of the fence, knocking \ndown the things you were busily building up in another chronicle. \nThis is not to imply that you should destroy another game - \nturning players \nagainst each other in such a manner could create hard feelings. It is more equitable \nto create a completely new story for your Sabbat game, separate from any Camarilla \ngames you may have running at the same time. On the other hand, some players \nenjoy the struggle against an unpredictable, living opponent and may be interested \nin dividing their player base among the two sides. In this case, your job as Storyteller \nwill be to keep all lines of information and reaction open and ensure that players can \nunderstandandcopewiththelossofafavoritecharactertotheactionsofapredatory \nmember of the other sect. \nSABBAT VFRSUS ANARCH \nThe anarchs provide prime recruiting ground for the Sabbat. The Camarilla \nis not unfounded in its fear of Sabbat infiltration though local anarch ranks. But \nmore than that, the anarchs can be a devastating wild card in a war between the \nsects, tipping the balance at critical moments. Whether the chronicle takes place \nwithin an anarch city, or the anarchs are friendly to the sect, a chronicle of this \nsort is certain to have significant upheaval and opportunity for conflict. The \nmindset of most anarchs (dedication to personal freedom) is supported by the \nSabbat, but most anarchs spit on the Vaulderie as simply a dressed-up blood bond. \nBetrayal of one stripe or another is often a theme in anarch-Sabbat plots. They \nmay be easy to infiltrate, but how easy are they to convert? Many anarchs are aware \nof the Sabbat’s brutal and unwanted attempts to convert them and will resist any \nSabbat presence in their city to their utmost. Also, the Camarilla often uses rumors \nand false Sabbat infiltrators to encourage wars between the anarchs and the Sabbat, \nwars that can only be beneficial to the Camarilla. Finding the real traitor in a nest \nof them can be a dangerous and intriguing race against time. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSABBAT \nVERSUS CAMARILLA \nFor centuries, the forces of the Camarilla have stood in violent opposition to \nthe goals of the Sabbat. Where the Sabbat seeks to destroy the Antediluvians, the \nCamarilladismisses them as myths. Where Cainites consider the Beast to be agift \nof Caine that destroys their weakness, the Kindred embrace their humanity. \nThere is no room for compromise. Ultimately, the Sabbat has one goal: to destroy \nthe Camarilla and to convert or slaughter those who insist on following its tenets. \nThe ancient battle against the Camarilla can be fought on a number of \ndifferent fronts. Events can center around street fights, but infiltration and \nconversion attempts can also provide storytelling opportunities. A city in tunnoil \n(from Praxis struggles or clan wars) can appear the perfect wounded target for a \ncrusade. It is also possible, and makes for interesting plot twists, if both sects are \nminor powers in a city held by anarchs, werewolves or even hunters. Such a \nsituation might force the two sects to find ways to work together in order to defeat \nthe more dangerous enemy. How does the alliance hold? What happens after the \nenemy is finally vanquished? \nThe Siege \nA subset of the Sabbat/Camarilla plotline, the siege tactic revolves around open \nwarfare over some trophy, typically a city or important geographical area. Involving \nthecharactersaslargegroupscanbedifficultwhenyouarerunningalive-actiongame. \nAfter all, there are typically 20-30 players, and only one of you. While Narrators or \nStoryteller assistants can be helpful fix to this problem, the most important thii you \ncan do as a Storyteller is to create a plotline that encourages character interaction and \nshared goals, taking some of the burden off of you. It can’t be stressed enough that your \nplayers often give you the greatest motivational tools in their own character sheets. \nRead through their histories, find characters who are converts from or had earlier \nbrushes with the Camarilla (for good or bad). Perhaps they’re still sensitive to a \nhumiliating l a  at their enemy’s hands, or a convert left behind a lover who could be \nleading the defense. \nIf the siege is going to be run against a city peopled solely with Storyteller \ncharacters, then you should take care to create believable antagonists with goals \nand initiative. These characters will become the villains to your players, so make \nthem motivated, dangerous and above all real in their own right. A good way to \ngive antagonists depth is to locate a personality test and take it while thinking as \nyour lead antagonist. These can lend some flashes of insight into character, or give \nsmall details about how the antagonist might react to certain situations. \nYOUNG VERSUS OLD \nThe Sabbat is founded on the idea that the oldest Cainites in the world are \ncorrupt, treacherous and use the younger generations as pawns in a great game of \npower that spans continents and nations. Therefore, it is not inconceivable that \nthe newer members of the sect feel a certain amount of resentment toward those \nof greater age and power. Diablerie is a common practice; those of lower \ngeneration may be at risk of losing their immortal lives to feed the ambition of a \nyounger vampire. \nAlso, the anachronism common among elder members of the sect can be a \nstumbling block to their younger companions, particularly when there is a war to be \nfought. The difference between fighting with guns and swords is monumental, and an \nelder who has become hidebound or unable to adapt will swiftly find himself \noutmaneuvered. The youth know well that the motto is “adapt or die” if they want to \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsurvive this war, and they will not hesitate to use whatever new weaponFateputs into \ntheir hands. So who will adapt? Will the elders learn in time that they must change \nto survive? Or will the young find themselves in a headlong race to keep up with the \nlatest, only to risk becoming obsolete themselves! \nSABBATVERSUS \nITSELE \nPossibly the greatest number of Sabbat plots comes from internal sect \nmaneuverings. No outside force is needed to spark conflict between the sect’s \nmany paths and factions; even less is needed when characters add their own \npersonal goals and desires to the mix. The sect is hardly a unified one, despite the \nbest efforts of the leadership. It is a cacophony of voices, all screaming to be heard, \nand each one believes the louder it screams, the more likely it will be to achieve \nits goals. \nClans squabble with each other for a greater share of power and respect. \nPanders get in the middle of whatever they can in an effort to prove themselves \nonce and for all. LasombraandVentrueuntiMibuoftencircleeachother, \ntwodans \nof kings and not enough thrones for them all. The violent Brujah untihibu press \nfor more strikes against their enemies, railing against the cautions of more \nconservative clans. A simple fight for power in a city or between two clans can \ngrow radically in scope if one side suddenly chooses to pull out the cards of sect \nunity and brotherhood. \nThe various Paths within the Sabbat contain their own plotlines. A \nmember of the Sabbat who has started on the Path of Power and the Inner Voice \nwill have difficulty coping in a city led by a radically hedonistic Catharist. Other \nPaths, as well, will come into conflict with one another when their goals are at \nodds, whether because of doctrinal disagreements or a sly antagonist. \nNOMADIC \nVERSUS EOUNDED \nThe nomadic bands of Sabbat are considered one of the banes of the sect, \ndespite their occasional use as scouts, and founded packs often resent their \npresence. During the Sabbat civil wars, nomadic packs were frequently assassi- \nnated, destroyed for their power or influence or used as fodder between warring \nfactions. Many of the packs who are currently nomadic are survivors of that era, \nand as such, have not forgotten their treatment at the hands of those they called \n“brother.” \nNomadic packs are an unbalancing influence on a city and can create strife \nbetween formerly peaceful factions. They come in, cause trouble and vanish \neffortlessly, leaving the founded packs to clean up their messes. For this very \nreason, nomadic packs are rarely treated with the same respect as founded packs. \nDisrespect breeds resentment, which in turn breeds treachery and deceit - \nafter \nall, though the founded packs of a city celebrate the Vaulderie with one another, \nthose who are simply traveling through have no such enforced loyalty to the city \nnor to the Sabbat leadership that holds sway there. They are only loyal to \nthemselves, and may ignore certain rituals, commands and restrictions placed on \nfounded packs. Add a little background conflict to this, and the tension can \nbecome a powder keg waiting for the match. \nTypically, a single nomadic pack causes little or no difficulty to a city with \na major founded Sabbat presence. One idea might be to have several nomadic \npacks driven into the city by an outside force and compelled to live within its \nconfines, rankling both their wanderlust and the stability of founded packs in the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncity. Nomadic packs are also frequently home to some very unpleasant practices \n(infernalism among them) -how long can the pack keep their secrets when each \nnight in the city may bring them closer to discovery? \nTHE \nBLACK \nHAND \nAs we’ve already mentioned, the Sabbat is a place of great internal conflict. \nAdd the members of the Black Hand and the Inquisition, and the already-volatile \nmix grows that much more exciting. The Hand has always been trusted by the Sect \nand once saved the Sabbat from falling to civil war. However, that trust only goes \nso far in the eyes of the archbishops and cardinals who secretly fear the Hand’s \nmilitary might and wonder when loyalty to the sect is superceded by loyalty to the \nHand. The Hand is only called u p n  in times of great need; once active, they may \nnot be willing to relinquish control to a leader they see as “weak.” Yet, if the Hand \nis kept from power, the Seraphim may lose influence and strength in the Sabbat. \nThey must maintain a delicate balance of fear and respect and continue to duence \nthe sect from their position in the rear of the column. \nThe Inquisition’s goals are not quite so subtle. If infernalist taint threatens \nthe sect in a city, political niceties fall by the wayside. The seizure of the city and \nthe bloody purge that follows can shock even those who call themselves beasts. \nUnlike the Hand, which maintains a working relationship with the political \nleaders of the sect, the Inquisition is comprised of fanatics who will allow nothing \nto come between themselves and their enemy. Their goal is to see the sect \ncleansed of the cancer that rots it from within. However, even such “pure” \nmotives can be corrupted -how \nmany purges have swept up victims innocent \nof the charge of infernalism but not of the sin of interfering with a powerful bishop? \nWhen a plotline involves either of these two very powerful factions, the \nStoryteller should be cautious not to overpower the characters and their goals. \nLike a visit from a Camarilla archon, the arrival of one of these mighty beings \nshould be suitably momentous and rare. Use them sparingly on stage and let the \noccasion (and the plot it furthers) unfold on a grand scale. \nLOYALTY \nAND FREEDOM \nThe conflict between the sect’s two founding principles, freedom and loyalty, \nis a story always waiting to be told. Although the sect does everything it can to \nunify these two beliefs, the road can be a difficult one. Many Sabbat demand total \nfreedom, seeing it as the ultimate goal of the sect. They refuse to take orders from \nanyone - \neven the regent - and the Code of Milan simply undermines \neverything they seek to achieve. Understandably, the Loyalists are a significant \nproblem to those who seek to keep the Sabbat together under the umbrella of \nauthority. If the Sabbat is to survive, the balance between loyalty and freedom \nmust be maintained. \nThere are many ways to throw the delicate balance of power out ofwhack and \nthus open up new stories. A sudden attack on the city slaughters nearly all of the \nmost vocal Loyalists, and the Ultra-Conservatives suddenly advance to power - \na little too conveniently.. . Do the characters adjust their views to the liking of \nthe new administration or is there more here than meets the eye? Or could it be \nthat open rebellionon the part ofLoyalists causes turmoil in the sect, allowing the \nCamarilla or other enemies to take advantage of the chaos - \nwhich enemy \nshould be dealt with first? \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDESCENT \nINTO HELL \nInfernalism is a disease within the Sabbat. The sect finds demons and their \nmethods to be repulsive and anathema to all it stands for. Personal freedom does not \nmean selling oneself into slavery. Unfortunately, there are many younger members \nwho are power-hungry, discontent with their position at the lowest ranks and eager \nto explore any avenue that offers them a quick route to power. Without Humanity \nto guide them, and often with only a basic understanding of vampiric Morality, \ntemptation proves irresistible. If a vampire is found guilty of infernalism, the \noutcome is always the same: execution. The method varies from place to place and \noften relies on the whim of the Inquisitor-General, but the final result will be just \nthat - \nfinal. Meanwhile, the Inquisition hopes the monster didn’t do too much \ndamage before they discovered her, but who can really tell where such a creature’s \ninfluence begins or ends? \nSo, what makes someone desperate or greedy enough to throw away sect \nbeliefs for demonic offers? Who makes the better target - \nthe self-righteous, the \nunderdog, the power mad or the ignored? What kind of damage can an infernalist \ndo among the packs or the power structure? How far can one infernalist’s legacy \nreach? \nNON-CAINITF \nFNFMIES \nMortals, Garou, even fae, all abhor the inhumane practices and butchery of \nthe Sabbat. There are very few other creatures of the World of Darkness that the \nSabbat can call friends, or even allies. There are many reasons why these groups \nmight cross paths with the Sabbat, but what happens when they do? \nMortal hunters can cause no end of trouble for the Sabbat, forcing them to \nre-evaluate the belief that they are “superior beings.” The vampires of the Sabbat \nare certain of their superiority to the Children of Seth and go out of their way to \nprove it in their rituals and games. The arrival of a particularly capable group of \nhunters should shake them out of complacency. Perhaps they are skilled outsiders \nwho were drawn by some particularly spectacular breach of the Masquerade, or \nmaybe they’re the mortal Inquisition who has had the city under observation for \nsome time. A more intriguing possibility is to see how the Sabbat try to maintain \ncontrol when the mortals of a sect-controlled city become motivated to clean up \ntheir town. If the kine are struggling to throw off the yoke, is it possible to force \nthem to go back under? \nGarou and Sabbat clash on several fronts. Garou Kinfolk aren’t immune from \nbecoming targets when a pack goes scouting for Blood Feast vessels, and the Sabbat \nstink abominably of the Wyrm to even the most casual observer. Both groups are \nused to fighting against the odds, both revere honor and strength, and both adhere \nto the belief that humans are worthless except as breeding stock or food. Some \nwhisper that Black Spiral Dancers and Sabbat have joined forces on rare occasions, \nbut most Garou discount such tales as campfire stories. \nEven the most heartless Unseelie can find the Sabbat lust for blood and cruelty \nto be too much, despite similar views on individual freedom, and Seelie fae abhor \neverything the Sabbat stand for. When the Sabbat target those they believe “weak,” \nweakness in their eyes could be anything changelings value, such as compassion, joy \nor creativity. Rumors abound of unholy unions between the Shadow Court and the \nSabbat. Their denizens often share similar views on the weakness of mortals, not to \nmention enjoying the same guilty pleasures, although few are willing to brave the \ngathers where the answers might be found. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRITAF \nThe amtoritas and ignobilis ritae are the rituals and customs that bind the \nSabbat together. For many vampires, these are the times of their unlives when \nthey feel closer to their heritage as vampires and closer to the greater family of \nCainites that surrounds them. Using the rim is a fine means of setting the stage \nfor players and characters. For players, it’s a complete immersion into the Sabbat \nworld and values. For characters, it’s a chance to get the blood racing (so to speak) \nand reconnect with their heritage. \nOne of the best ways to draw both players and characters into the setting of \nagame is to create interestingrim and encourage every pack to develop their own \ngames and rituals. The Sabbat hierarchy encourages spirituality in its members \nand encourages the development of new rim as well. The rim of a particular pack \nhighlight the pack‘s qualities that others may admire or scorn. Many players love \npomp and circumstance, and given time and space, they will create some amazing \nevents for your chronicle. \nThe Sabbat isn’t a homogeneous mass of vampires all spouting the same \nnaughty words from between clenched fangs while posing in the latest rumble- \nworthy garb. The characters given here are all fairly typical: They’d fit in with the \npopulation of many Sabbat strongholds. They don’t even come close to exhaust- \ning the range of possibilities. If you use them in your own chronicle, alter sex, \nappearance, behavior and whatever details need to change to suit your stories. Use \nthese characters as starting points, not as barriers to your own innovation. \nNote: The Ability levels presented here reflect a “conservative” reading of \nthe rules and the assumption that characters can still attempt tasks that require \nAbilities they’ve used up. The characters just don’t get retests anymore. If your \nchronicle imposes more limits or simply includes characters who routinely have \nmore Ability levels, adjust the totals for these template characters to match. \nARCHBISHOP \nBackground: You earned your position a few decades ago after long, hard \nservice in difficult circumstances. Older than the government of the country you \ndwell in, you’ve followed your region through multiple cycles of revolt and reform. \nMortal society holds very few surprises for you. The political and social cause of \nperfect individual freedom first drew you to the sect, and you remain more \ninterested in the social side of the Sabbat than doctrinal issues. Still, you can \nsustain debate on the fine points of all the major Paths and the theological \nimplications of various divergent philosophies; your bishops learn quickly not to \nconfuse a subject’s secondary importance to you with ignorance. Soon there will. \nRoleplaying Hints: You’ve proven yourself fit for your job. You hope to prove \nyourself fit for higher rank than this. Since your own success depends on the \nperformance of those beneath you, you make sure they’ve got the resources they \nneed to do well, the training to use their resources, rewards for doing good work \nand harsh penalties for failure. You can count the vampires you actually trust on \none hand, but you have stable, mutually profitable relationships with your \nassociates, and that counts for something. \nClan: Lasombra \nNature: Architect \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDemeanor: Survivor \nGeneration: 7th \nEmbrace: 1715 \nApparent Age: Middle-aged \nPhysical: &le, Energetic x 2, Ferocious, Quick x 2, Tough x 2 \nSocial: Chuarismtic x 3, Commnding x 3, Dtplomatic, Intimidating x 3, Witty \nMental: Attentive x 2, Creative, Dedicated x 2, Knowledgeable x 3, Observant x 2, \nVigilant x 2 \nAbilities: Alertness x 2, Brawl x 3, Camarilla Lore x3, Etiquette, Expression x 2, Fire \nDancingx 2, Intimidation x 3, Investigation x 3, Leadership x 4, Occult x 3, Politics x \n4, Rituals x 4, Subbut Lore x 5, Streetwise, Subterfuge, SuruivuI x 2 \nDisciplines: Dominate 4, Fortitude 1, Obtenehation 6, Potence 3, Protean 3 \nBackgrounds: Contacts x 5, Herd x 2, Resources x 3 \nVirtues: Conviction 4, Znstinct 3, Courage 5 \nPath of Enlightenment: Power and the Inner Voice 4 \nWillpower: 14 \nStatus: Battle-Scarred, Blessed, Blooded, Enlightened, Initiated, Ominous, Proven, \nSuperior \nBISHOP \nBackground: You are first among equals in your city.

Payback time. The bitches and sons of bitches can \nnever suffer too much. You take great pleasure in making mortals hurt in ways that \nthey can’t cure and can’t stop.

Beneath \nyour calm exterior, you were angry enough at the world to try everything your \ncould think of that might summon demons. The survivors consulted briefly and \noffered you the Embrace. You accepted. Now you throw yourself without reserve \ninto the spiritual side of the Sabbat. Who cares about politics? You want to see \nhumanity crushed and the worthy few, yourself included, elevated to supreme \npower. God Himself can’t hide from you forever.
