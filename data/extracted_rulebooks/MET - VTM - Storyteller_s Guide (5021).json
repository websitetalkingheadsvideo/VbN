The \nlayout frankly stinks - \nit’s mostly a long slope overgrown with creeping \nvines and brush that runs down into a valley where the fog collects and \na little stream meanders through. Not much for lights, which means the \nplace turns into a pit after dark. The original idea for the place came from \nsome Audubon Society do-gooder who wanted something “natural.” In \nthis city, “natural” means “neglected,” so Bronger’s is now a favorite \nafter-dark spot for just about anything that shouldn’t be happening in \npublic. Consequently, Gina and I (who play beat cops for the brick who \nlikes to pretend he’s sheriff) spend a lot of time there. \nOver the past six months, there’d been a bunch of bodies showing up \nin the valley, all with serious blood loss and strange mutilations, which \nmeans we’ve got to assume the worst. Even better, the bodies had been \nfound by mortals out for their morning jog or walking the pooch or \nwhatever, and the papers were all over it, yammering about serial killers. \nSo Prince Warner is screaming at the brick for the heads of the Masquer- \nade-breakers, which means the brick is screaming for ours if we can’t hunt \nthis bastard down. Which brings us to tonight. \nWe’re hanging out in Gina’s car in the upper parking lot, watching \nthe lower lot and waiting for something to show up.

That’s when a car pulls into the empty \nparking lot below us. Gina nudges me, and I lean over for a look. Older \nmodel sedan, dark color, with the plate-light disabled. I make a mental \nnote to check the plate and have it run. \nThe car parks, cuts its lights and sits in the darkness for a few \nminutes. Finally, the driver’s door opens, and a dark-skinned man in \na suit gets out. No one I recognize. The passenger side opens too, and \na black girl gets out. She’s dressed in a nice-looking skirt and white \nsweater, maybe a college student. \nThey start heading for the crude stairway of dirt and railroad ties that \ngoes down through the creeper and into the valley. My hand’s on the door \nhandle, but Gina lays a warning hand on my arm. No, not yet. They \ndescend, and as they dip just below sight and out ofhearing range, she opens \nher car door and we follow. \nWe descend from the upper parking lot to the lower one, and I \ncheck the car as we pass - \na dealer’s drive-off plate, damn him. Still, \nthe car isn’t one I recognize from the parking lots during court. Now \nwe’re moving into the weed-choked darkness, following the faint \ntrail they’re leaving behind. Gina’s leading - \nI’m following what I \ncan see of her dark jacket and pale hands in the starlight. Around us, \nthe trees seem to close in, like great hands cupping around an insect \nto trap it. I’m no more paranoid than usual, but this feels different. \nIt feels like something is watching us, maybe from the trees or laying \nin the masses of creeper. I shrug my jacket into place, tapping at the \ntwo stakes and silenced pistol I’ve got laying in wait. \nWe’re approaching the valley. I can smell water and damp soil, hear \nthe faint gurgle of the stream passing over rocks. The rest of the woods \nis strangely quiet - \nno birds, no crickets, nothing but the water. The \nwatching feeling is getting stronger; my fists clench, almost automati- \ncally. Then there’s another smell - \nincense of some sort, something \nexotic, spicy. I stop on the trail to get a better read on the situation. \nNow I hear what sounds like groans, and I pause. Caution turns to \nfrustration. Christ. Just two kine wanting a cheap place to rut. I reach \nfor the hood on Gina’s jacket to pull her back, but she’s stepped out of \nmy reach. Irritated, I try to close the distance between us, and that’s \nwhen the other smell hits me. \nBlood. \nI ate earlier, so I’m not feeling hungry. The cool air of the valley now \nseems more like a slaughterhouse - \nthick, moist, strangely warm, the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

I almost crash into Gina, who is standing stock-still on the trail. \nWe look at each other, and I know what she’s thinking, because I’m \nthinking it too: Found him. Whether it’s a messy Kindred, or a kine gone \nbatshit, we found our valley serial killer. \nShe’s holding her flashlight (which could cold-cock a man) like a club. \nI check again for my means, and take out my pistol. She motions to me that \nwe should circle around and catch him from behind. I motion that I think \notherwise, but she indicates he’s currently too busy to notice us. I sigh \ninwardly - \nat least her risks are calculated ones. \nI creep through the brush, trying not to think about what could be \nunder my feet, focusing on the noise the whole time. I can just make out \nmovement about 10 feet away. I remember the student girl had that white \nsweater, and what’s ahead of me looks darker. The sounds are starting to \nchange, but I’m not sure what’s happening. I hear wet, meaty tearing.. . \ngulping.. . little growls deep inside the throat.. .. \nI see Gina about three feet from me, and the slashing motion she uses \nto indicate “get ready.” I turn my face toward the noise, pistol in hand and \nready to scare something shitless. Someone is squatting on the ground, bent \nover something dark, and the growls and groans seem to be coming from \nhim. Gina’s flashlight clicks. Suddenly the guy’s in a spotlight, and my \nevening meal is trying to climb my throat. \nThe man turns on us, snarling with surprise, his mouth a bloody gash \nin his face. Blood runs from his open mouth, and I realize he doesn’t have \nfangs. In one hand is a lump of dripping, maroon-colored flesh. The \nstudent, her mocha skin now ashen and mottled, is laying under him, her \neyes wide and blank. Her white sweater has turned mostly crimson. The \nsmell of blood, incense and death would make a lesser man faint. \nThe guy drops his meal and makes a run for Gina, who’s too \nstunned by the scene to react. The flashlight is knocked from her \nhand, hits the ground, and the beam rolls before it’s stopped by a tree \nand lights up the dead girl’s face. He shouts a bunch of gibberish, and \nGina briefly whirls past me, her hands batting at her face and she’s \nscreaming something like “Get them off me!” I’ve got a stake in my \nhands, and I’m trying to find this guy, and suddenly it’s there’s \nhundreds of angry voices howling and screaming in my ears, and tiny \nmouths biting me, digging into my flesh. I drop the stake while I’m \ntrying to fight off whatever’s swarming me. Whatever it is, I can’t lay \nhands on it - \neven as I swat at my face, I’mgetting bitten on my hands \nand mouth. \nEven in the middle of this Charlie Foxtrot, I manage to crash into \nthe monster. As I’m fumbling desperately for the other stake, he grabs \nmy tie to pull me toward him. I can see his teeth - \nall pointed, like \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

He yanks my head back and starts to bite \ninto my cheek - \nhe’s actually ripping the flesh out of my face, and his \nteeth are scraping the bone- \nHe shrieks and drops me. I look up through a haze of pain, and he’s \nfacing down Gina, spitting out the hunk of my cheek as he does. The \nstake I dropped earlier is buried in his left flank, the point sticking \nbloodily out of his lower ribs. Maybe we’re more fight than he planned for. \nMaybe he just wants to get away. For whatever reason, he turns and runs. \nI tell Gina to follow him, but the swarm of.. . whatever.. . makes a last pass \nat her, she trips and falls a couple times, and that’s the end of that. I hear \ntires squealing as his car peels out of the parking lot. \nI will my mangled cheek to close over so I don’t lose more blood. Gina \nreturns, picks up her flashlight, and I can see she has dozens of tiny gouges, \nlike bite-marks, all over her exposed hands and face, like me. Her hands \nare shaking and her pallor is pronounced as we turn our attention to the \nstudent. It’s hard to tell what killed her -the massive bite to the throat, \nblood loss (the ground is saturated with it), the long jagged knife-wound \ndown her torso, her missing liver ... \nThe air in the valley has definitely turned hostile. It sounds \nstrange, I know, but it’s not a friendly place to be right now. We both \nstagger up the hill to retrieve the tarp kept in the trunk for clean-ups, \nand spend a few minutes fixing the crime scene as fast as we can - \nunidentifiable lumps of flesh, blood-spattered leaves, soil that practi- \ncally screams when we step on it -always \nwithin sight of each other. \nThe paranoia and menace I felt earlier is returning with a vengeance, \nand whatever’s out there is pissed at us for disturbing what happened. \nCaine forbid this thing comes back for a doggy bag. \nAs soon as things look passable, we stow the body in the trunk and get \nthe hell out of there. * \n* \n* \n* \n* \nMy elder, Matisse, doesn’t turn around from the monitor when Gina \nand I come in, and at first, I think he didn’t hear us. His fingers are moving \na mile a minute on the keyboard, his concentration on the scrolling words. \nAfter a few moments of this, I clear my throat, and his fingers pause, \nhovering above the keyboard. He leans toward the monitor as if scrutiniz- \ning something, then says, “Ah, Nick. Is Gina with you?” \n“Yes, sir,” I reply. \nThere’s a pause, he seems to take a breath, and I know he’s adjusting \nforms. Gina’s cool with usual Nosferatu attire, but it’s still polite to put a \nface on for company. After a few moments, he turns to us, wearing his usual \nmask.

In the next moment, \nhe’s all business. “Tell me everything.” \nI notice Gina’s hands starting to shake again, and decide I’d better \ndo the talking. Matisse doesn’t say a word while I tell what happened, just \nlooking at me with that long, thoughtful stare that he uses every time he \ngets secondhand info. \nI wind up by mentioning the body in the trunk and how things \ncurrently stand down at Bronger’s, and he just nods and doesn’t say \nanything. He seems to be considering the space on the floor in front of us, \npursing his lips, and the lines on his forehead getting deeper by the minute. \nYou could power a city block with the tension in this place. \nFinally, he glances up at us with hooded eyes. Maybe he thinks we’re \nbullshitting him. I feel Gina tensing beside me, and God’s truth, I am too. \nI know I wasn’t dreaming tonight; I know Gina wasn’t, and there’s a body \nin our trunk that says we weren’t. \n“So what was it?” I ask. \nThat’s when Matisse, my always-knows elder, who probably never \nadmitted he was stumped in his last life or this one, looks confused.

Well, come on in, because this book is for you! \nThis is part translation from the Vampire Storytellers Handbook, part \ncollection of things Storytellers are likely to find helpful and exciting. It’s not about \nbeing given a Bible of Storytelling Mind’s Eye Theatre or a mandate on how to \nrun your game.

Now \nthere is some material that they might find helpful, but it may not mean their \nintentions are altruistic. Maybe they want to try trumping the Storyteller with her \nown tools, or maybe they want to “be prepared” for the Storyteller’s next tricks. We \nplay as well as Storytell, and there’s something to be said for reading the Storyteller \nsections to figure out what’s ahead. \nThat said, trying to use what you’ve read to trump the Storyteller is frankly not \nnice. Remember way back in Laws of the Night, where we said the object of the \ngame was not winning but telling stories? That’s not the action of someone who \nwants to tell astory, but who wants to win, who wants to beat the Storyteller at her \nown game.

The Cainites herein \nhave bloodily carved out places for themselves, and found roosts upon \nwhich to squat (most usually consisting of a pile of elegantly butchered \ncorpses). As the opening story shows, these creatures are Tare. Even elders \nare unlikely to have heard of these vampires beyond a few stories whis- \npered in the corners at a grand conclave, or So-and-so’s sire having a \nparticular encounter back in 1547, or the like. In short, any encounters \nwith these creatures should be suitably momentuous. Because of the \nfrightful powers of their Disciplines and their “lifestyles”, these Cainites \ncan easily throw game balance out the window into heavy traffic. They are \nbest used as Storyteller characters. \nThe fact that not even elders know much about these monsters should \nput the fear of Caine in the younger generations. What Man (and \nKindred) does not know, he fears, and here are no less than three \nbloodlines that the majority of Western Kindred know nothing about. \nResist the temptation to put one of each in every city - \nthat defeats the \npurpose of their rarity.

Legend claims that an Antediluvian dallied \nwith a singing slave-boy, and the youth turned against the Third Generation. \nHe wrought foul pacts with those who hid between the shadows of this world \nand the next and gathered followers from his Cainite siblings. Calling himself \nshaitan, he and his followers made war against the Second City. The Third \nGeneration ended the war with the deaths of the shaitan’s generals, routing \ntheir hordes. None knew what happened to the shaitan himself, and the names \nof what he had served were lost to the night. \nOnce thought eradicated by the Inquisition, the Baali have come into the \nawareness (and enmity) of modern Cainites and are rooted out wherever they \nare found. Faced with an infestation of Baali, Camarilla and Sabbat often set \naside personal agendas to burn the offending nest from sight. The recent \nunearthing of a Baali hive, along with the recovery of their unholy tomes, has \ncast doubt on the long-held belief of their destruction. \nNever numerous, the ranks of the Baali have dwindled even further in \nrecent nights as more and more succumb to a wasting erosion of spirit. They \nare beset on all sides by the Camarilla, Sabbat, and a host of enemies, and their \ninternal unity fractures nightly. Their havens are visible to those who know \nthe signs - \nstrange sigils in hillsides, the prevalence of places of power, \nchildren and livestock in nearby villages born deformed. Contrary to popular \nbelief, they are not the cackling, mustachioed minions of evil, but sages and \nacademics intent on the discovery of knowledge few others have the courage \nto pursue. They are evangelists, of a sort, bent on the task of bringing all to \ndestruction for the greater glory of Those-Who-Wait. \nRoleplaying Hints: While some Demons do fit the tongue-wagging, \nleather-clad devil worshipper profile, most Baali look on these as marks of \nimmaturity or, in more persistent cases, evidence of someone seriously \nmissing the point. It becomes difficult to convert the faithless if you cannot \nbe taken seriously. Seduce your prey, not with wild displays of “evil” but with \na genteel and urbane offer of enlightenment. Let them know that the truth is \ntheirs to be had, if they but ask for it. Do not force the issue. The sweetest \nconquest comes from the willingly conquered. \nAs Baali age and grow wise in the ways of their masters, they fall further \nand further from their human roots. Many older Demons develop an affecta- \ntion for vermin, keeping them as pets or companions, sometimes in vast \nhordes to rival those of the Nosferatu. Many young Demons have Humanity \n(albeit abysmally low), but fall off rapidly and take up a different path. Some \nolder Baali follow the Path of Cathari or Death and the Soul. Recently, though \nmany have taken up the Path of Evil Revelations and Power and the lnner Voice. \nThere are whispers of a Path particular to Demons, the Path of the Hive, but \nnone have dared get close enough to the Baali to know for sure. \nDisciplines: Daimoinon, Obfuscate, Presence \nAdvantage: The very existence of the Demons is bent toward the \ndiscovery of dark secrets and hidden lore.

Once rumored to be members of a secret cult called the Black \nHand, the bloodline is no more than a handful now. A war deep in the \nUnderworld has whittled away at their ranks until less than 20 (some sources \nsay no more than a dozen) remain. \nMost tales put their origins somewhere in the Middle East, but rumor and \ntruth are nigh indistinguishable when it comes to the Nagaraja. What is \nknown is that they are necromancers on par with (or greater) than the \nGiovanni, that their troves of blasphemous knowledge are prodigious and \nthat not only the blood of their victims is needed to sate their hunger but the \nflesh as well. Victims of their hungers are often a beacon to the Camarilla and \nSabbat, who hunt them mercilessly. \nWith their numbers shrinking nightly and their eldest destroyed, \nthere aren’t many takers who would wager on the Nagaraja’s continued \nexistence. Isolated from Kindred and kine alike by their gruesome diet, \nhunted by the ghosts they once commanded, the Flesh Eaters can do little \nbut hide and watch the world go by, eking out meager unlives before Final \nDeath comes at last. \nRumors have filtered west from Korea of an ancient court of Eastern \nvampires offering a dozen or so of the surviving Flesh Eaters sanctuary, but \npoor relations between Cathayans and Cainites have prevented confirma- \ntion. If the rumors are true, perhaps the Nagarajah are not finished, but biding \ntheir time and gaining strength. The wise Cainite rules nothing out. \nRoleplaying Hints: Yours is a solitary existence, an unlife of discipline \nand study. Those that may have once been your allies have all perished \nbeyond the Shroud. Those who were your slaves pursue you in hopes of \ntaking vengeance. You do not have the luxury of the occasional misstep. \nOnly a handful of your blood remains, and you mean to keep yours as long \nas possible. You cannot afford the extravagance of Humanity. Your very \nexistence denies it, calling out for the flesh of the kine to sate its terrible \nhunger. Immortality is precious and terrible, power its only salve. Cling to \nboth and you just might live to eat the flesh from your enemies’ bones. There \ncan be no sweeter morsel than that. \nThe peculiarities of the Nagarajah diet leave little room for maintaining \none’s Humanity. As a result most Flesh Eaters opt for the vampiric Paths of \nmorality and often choose the Path of the Bones or Death and the Soul. \nDisciplines: Auspex, Dominate, Necromancy \nAdvantage: Hunted for millenia as the most vile of monsters, the \nNagaraja have developed a knack for deception, if only for the sake of \nconcealing their studies and dietary needs. All Nagaraja receive a free \nSubterfuge Ability. In addition, their scholarly pursuits and morbid interests \nlead them to make inroads as they can in fields where such things might, at \nthe very least, be tolerated if not appreciated.

Sagacious and erudite, the Elois are the scholars the Brujah often \naspire to be, ensconced in their studies as firmly as iron rods set in stone. Sage \nphilosophers that they are, the True Brujah bear a legacy of bitterness as well. \nIt is the claim of the Elois that the founder of their blood was slain by its childe \nages ago, and that those who claim the name Brujah are no more than the bastard \nchilder of that ancient diablerist. Carthage, they say, the city so lauded and \nlamented by their cousins was, in fact, the pinnacle of their achievements, where \nthey strode godlike over the night. As timeless as the Kindred themselves, the \nElois’s resentment for their fractious kin festers into these nights. \nFor all their claims of once-shared blood, the True Brujah hold none of \ntheir cousins’ passion. Cold and imperturbable, the Elois pursue ancient lore \nand discourse with serpentlike detachment. Indeed their Blood does seem to \ndeaden the spirit as it preserves the flesh, immutable as stone. And for all their \nvaunted mastery of Temporis, time itself bears hard upon them, each descend- \ning into anachronism as the present climbs swiftly from the past, unable to \nmuster warmth enough to thaw their glacial ways. \nEvents of recent nights have struck hard again at the Elois. As with the \nNagaraja, the True Brujah found shelter and collaboration in the Black Hand \ncult. Since the destruction of that order and some of the eldest of their blood \nalong with it, the Elois have sought allies where they may, particularly with \ntheir African neighbors, the Followers of Set.

Each seeks \nhidden knowledge though to different ends, and in these nights, when safe \nhaven is a scarce commodity, that much is more than enough. \nRoleplaying Hints: Passion is the haven of the ignorant, emotion the \ncrutchof mediocrity. You are of the true blood and lifted far above such things. \nAll things are yours to observe and understand. Calm is the tool of the learned. \nBe calm. Disdain the ignorant and the unrestrained. Be patient and wise. \nWhen time at last runs out, you alone will remain to watch a universe die. \nMost True Brujah adhere to Humanity, though elders sometimes espouse \nthe ideals of Paths of Enlightenment unique to them alone. There are even \nthe infrequent followers of the Path of Typhon among those True Brujah who \nhave dealings with the Setites. \nDisciplines: Potence, Presence, Temporis \nAdvantage: The True Brujah are academics without peer. They typically \ndevote their long unlives to obscure and esoteric pursuits, gathering vast pools \nof knowledge over uncountable subjects. As a result, each True Brujah \nreceives one Academics Ability at no cost and may choose an additional \nAbility in any one Lore for no cost as well. \nWhile solitary by nature, the Elois do value discourse and intellectual \ndebate very highly. To this end, the clan meets twice each century to discuss \ncurrent developments and argue the finer points of philosophy.

For every Trait sacrificed, the Baali may reduce \none of his victim’s Attributes, Virtues or Willpower by a single Trait to \na minimum of one.

Whether caused by another of \nthe Elois, a mortal magician or something even less common, the \nvampire may sense the disturbance by succeeding in a Simple Test. \nThe range of this sensitivity is wholly dependent on the intensity of \nthe disturbance - minor powers (Basic and Intermediate) can be \nsensed up to a mile away. Advanced and Master-level powers can be \nperceived from as far as 10 miles away, and use of even more potent \nabilities can be detected from a hundred to as far as a thousand miles \naway.

Unless the wielder is capable of invasive psychic probing, \nthe event to be replayed must have been physically witnessed by the \nwielder (and likely will have occurred only shortly before the power \nwas activated). As described above, the event to be relived must be \nrelatively uneventful or commonplace and must require no interaction \non the part of the victim.

From their rotting mansions, the Fiends’ kolduns call \nupon the elements to obey their will; in the dark chambers of Mount Alamut, \nthe viziers of the Assamite clan weave smoky, kalif-induced enchantments; \nthe Followers of Set perform grotesque rituals of defilement in their attempt \nto wake their god. Eventually, as a Storyteller, you may wish to incorporate \nother magical systems into your game. \nThe koldunic sorcery of the Tzimisce is an ancient, mystical art that \ncalls forth the elements of nature to take shape and obey the koldun’s \nwill. The specific paths, or “Ways” of this spiritual magic - \nEarth, \nWind, Fire, Water and Spirit - \nwere originally taught by elder Tzimisce \ncorresponding to the novice’s regional surroundings (for example, the \nWay of Wind was originally only known to koldun who lived in the \nCarpathian Mountains, the Way of Water to those who made their \nhavens near bodies of water, and so on); tonight, however, young Sabbat \nwho have heard rumors of these enchantments are thirsting for a taste \nof the eldritch power. \nUsing glyphs, herbal mixtures and the powerful sympathetic connections \nhoused in canopic jars (ornate clay vessels used to contain the organs of \nmummies), the Followers of Set usurp the power of the fertile Western Lands \nand bend it to their twisted desires. Despite the clan’s chaotic reputation, \nSetite paths are remarkably precise and deliberate in their practice. Some \nfocus on the exaggeration of vices already present in their victims; others \ninvolve the creation of cursed amulets which blind their bearers to anything \ngood or pure, making even the most wholesome influence seem hideous and \nbarren. They also employ a number of rituals to invoke their god, using the \nancient Egyptian magic of aeons past to give their more mundane pursuits a \nsilent and insistent partner. \nUnlike their martial brethren, Assamite viziers regard themselves as \nabove the struggles to maintain a single ethnic purity. Combining the \nmagical traditions of several groups of regional sorcerers, these wizards \nwork their magic through ritual intoxication, often maintaining a “herd” \nof perpetually drugged servants to feed from. Kulif (hashish watered in \nblood) provides revelations beyond human imagination, gifting the “field” \nAssamites with powerful protections or advantages even when they are \nnot in the presence of the vizier. Perhaps these wizards’ most awesome \nblessing is the ability to transcend the boundaries of space, their rituals \nenabling them to make their voices heard across thousands of miles or to \ntransport objects across a distance instantly. \nBlood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy offers an in-depth look into \nthe other magics of Vampire: The Masquerade.

The guidelines listed in “Creating Tremere \nPaths” can be used when considering the impact alternate paths will have \non your game and help you balance the relative power levels. While the \nalternate paths may go by other names, for game purposes it’s easier just \nto call them Thaumaturgy. \nTREMERB \nPATHS \nPerhaps the most disputed power in all of Vampire: The Masquer- \nade, Thaumaturgy makes the Warlocks both mighty and mistrusted as \n(given enough time) Clan Tremere can accomplish just about anything. \nThis kind of power has its price, however. It’s worth noting that while \nmany consider the Tremere advantage unbalancing in a live-action \ngame, the magnitude of their influence is, and must be, balanced by the \nrigidity of their hierarchy and the vigilance with which they guard their \nsecrets. Before you instantly outlaw certain paths or rituals because you \nfeel they are overpowered, it’s useful to consider how you can make the \nconsequences of abusing their advantage too high a price for the \nWarlock to pay. Remember, the Tremere guard their secrets jealously \nand do not take kindly to their members “showing off” - \nsuch frivolous \nor ostentatious use results in too much attention for the Warlocks’ taste, \nand Tremere who flaunt their gifts are always stifled quickly (and \nforcibly) by their superiors. Treat Thaumaturgy as you would a powerful \nbut fickle firearm: If you use it too many times in the wrong way, you just \nmight blow your own head off. \nMany of the paths listed here are extremely rare, some of them \nunknown to all but the most elder or worldly Warlock. A first-circle \napprentice who demands to know Biothaumaturgy can legitimately be \ngiggled at; a fourth-circle regent who meets a thyrsus, on the other hand, \nmight be given the opportunity to learn The Vine of Dionysus. Storytellers \nshould use common sense when determining if a character may know \nabout and learn any of the following paths. Also note that inquiring about \na few of these paths (such as Path of the Blood’s Curse) will raise a few stern \neyebrows among the higher-ups; they might even feel it necessary to pay \nthe curious Warlock a visit to ensure that their colleague isn’t entertain- \ning any “ideas”. . . . \nUnless otherwise noted, powers require a Blood Trait to activate and a \nfull action to use. \nTo T O U C H O R  \nNOT To T O U C H ?  \nAs outlined in “The Rules Thou Shalt Never Break,” players are \nnot permitted to touch one another in the course of roleplaying. \nHowever, some powers of Thaumaturgy require nothing but a light \ntouch to enact.

In either case, with \nsuccess, the caster may ask for the target to reveal either his heart’s \ndream or his deepest fears. These are not merely temporary passions, \nbut go to the very well of the soul.

By \nmaking a successful Physical Challenge with the target, the thaumaturge \nrenders her decrepit, shriveled and warped. The target’s fangs elongate, and \nvampiric features become more pronounced. \nFor every Willpower Trait the thaumaturge spends, the target is \nphysically aged one decade. Each decade means the loss of two Physical \nTraits. While the target cannot be aged past zero Traits, without \nPhysical Traits she cannot move, feed or even defend herself, and her \nspeech becomes so soft as to be nearly inaudible. If aged to zero Physical \nTraits, she may also not initiate challenges, and any of her Appearance- \nbased Social Traits are negated. For every five decades the target ages, \nshe gains the Negative Traits Decrepit and Repugnant as her features \nbecome more feral and her body shrinks into a skeletal heap, in addition \nto the loss of Physical Traits. The target may attempt to restore herself \nby spending one Willpower Trait and five blood Traits in the same turn \nshe was afflicted. \nStorytellers should feel free to increase or decrease these penalties as \nappropriate (if, for example, the vampire is only 10 years old, but was \nEmbraced at age 70, or if the character has the Flaw: Child). This power lasts \nfor one night, whereupon the vampire sheds her years and appears as young \nor old as the night of her Embrace. \nPATH \no E CURSES \nThis path, a natural extension of human spite, was developed early in \nthe history of Thaumaturgy. Whatever it is called - \nwhether it be hexing \nor bestowing the evil eye - \nit always involves a “calling down” of evil \nforces upon the victim. Some theorize that it is purely the psychological \nimpact that makes the superstitious unlucky or ill, but thaumaturges know \nbetter. This path is extremely powerful, but is also dangerous; unlike other \npaths, the accursed usually know exactly who it is who is making their \nunlives miserable - \na Warlock must speak aloud her curse directly to her \ntarget. While modern industrialized nations pooh-pooh the notion of \ncurses, there are places in the world where such a brazen witch could find \nherself pursued by a mob. \nWarlocks wishing to bestow a curse upon the unlucky target must first \npossess a sympathetic link - \na bit of blood, a lock of hair, a fingernail or the \nlike - \nand then must win a Social Challenge against their victim while \nintoning to them the details of the curse (although not necessarily in a \nlanguage the target understands). The sympathetic link might need to be \nacquired through a Physical Challenge; this is a good time to remind players \nof the “NO Touching” rule. A new sympathetic link must be used each time \na power is invoked, even if it is upon the same person. This path retests with \nthe Intimidation Ability.

This \npower lasts until the next sunset. \nMalady \nThis power allows the thaumaturge to infect Kindred or kine with a \ndebilitating sickness. Even a powerful Cainite might think twice about crossing \nsomeone who could make them suffer the sicknesses of a common mortal. \nIf this power is successfully invoked, the accursed suffers a two-Trait \npenalty to all physical actions due to intense discomfort; the disease looks and \nbehaves similarly to influenza.

By twisting the perceptions of the target’s peers, \nthe thaumaturge curses his target to appear as the most hateful of \nenemies to her peers (the target should indicate to anyone she interacts \nwith that she appears to be the most horrible enemy that person can \nthink of). This altered perception is only in body - \nthe target may still \nact and speak as normal. \nLike Mask of 1000 Faces, this power affects the perceptions of the \nonlooker, leading him to believe that he sees his worst enemy before him. \nHow he chooses to react is up to him: He may simply snub the target, or he \nmight throw the first punch. Auspex cannot see through this power. This \npower lasts until sunrise. \nCorrupt Body \nWhile Pariah simply alters the perceptions of those around the target, \nCorrupt Body makes that appearance reality. By denouncing the physical form \nof the accursed, the thaumaturge forces her body to warp into a grotesque \nparody of what it once was. This outward caricaturing is accompanied by \nmind-wracking pain, and Kindred who have undergone this curse are often \nscarred both mentally and physically. \nIf successfully cast, this power reduces the target’s Physical Traits to \nhalf (rounded down), bestows two Negative Physical Traits (Storyteller \ndiscretion, based on the curse) and renders all Appearance-based Social \nTraits unusable for the duration of the curse.

Also, these powers may be used in conjunction with one another \nfor more dramatic alterations and work upon any object within the \nthaumaturge’s direct line of sight (meaning that blood within a body cannot \nbe affected, but blood exiting the body can). \nThis path retests with the Occult Ability. \nBASIC PATH \nO E  TRANSMUTATION \nFortify The Solid Form \nBy strengthening the atomic bonds in an object, the magus in- \ncreases the strength of an item, negating any Fragile Negative Traits it \nhas and allowing for inherently weak objects (such as pencils) to \nfunction more effectively in combat situations.

Creative thaumaturges can use this power in \nother ways, at the Storyteller’s discretion. The magus must spend a \nMental Trait to use this power. \nObjects thus enhanced will remain so for the duration of one scene. \nCrystallize the Liquid Form \nOriginally developed to keep other Kindred from imbibing the \nthaumaturges’ vitae (as Kindred cannot consume congealed blood), this \npower will transform up to one Blood Trait’s worth (about two pints) of \nliquid into solid form. The substance will not change in temperature or \nvolatility, only form (so solid acid will still corrode, solid molten metal \nwill still burn, etc.). Liquids within living forms may not be affected.

A shimmering prison forms around the target’s body, encasing \nher within an impenetrable field; this power can also be used to form walls \nwithin doorways, solidifying the space within the doorframe. \nThe thaumaturge may affect any area within 50 yards (and line of sight) \nof himself and must spend a number of Mental Traits relevant to the size of \nthe area encased (a small rodent would cost one, while a normal-sized \nperson would cost five). Once encased, Kindred suffer no penalties, but \nmortals experience the discomfort of adapting to breathing “liquid air” as \nthe oxygen in the block becomes liquid-like but still breathable (and \nindeed, after being freed from their prison, mortals must cough out the \ncondensed contents of their lungs, suffering one bashing level of damage \nwhile they retch).

It lasts \nuntil sunrise. \nImpressive Visage \nThis ritual grants the caster a degree of sheer physical magnetism \nand ensures he will be neither ignored nor forgotten. He simply appears \nto be more desirable and attractive than anyone else in the room. By \nperforming this ritual and then placing a sprig of dried mint in his right \nshoe or pocket, the Warlock gains two Appearance-related Social Traits \nfor an evening. While they may not be bid, they may be counted in ties \nand overbids even if it goes over the Kindred’s generational maximum. \nThis power may not be “stacked” for an evening. \nThe Imp’s Affliction \nThis ritual only works on mortals, and infects them with an uncom- \nfortable and embarrassing illness. While under the effects of this ritual, \nthe target’s eyes and nose overflow with mucus, her throat becomes raw \nand raspy, and her eyes constantly brim with tears. Storytellers should \nassign penalties appropriate to the target’s actions (Social and Physical \nChallenges are certainly more difficult). This ritual lasts for one scene \nand requires the thaumaturge to write the target’s name on a scrap of \npaper and then burn it. \nJinx \nBy sacrificing some of the victim’s blood, the thaumaturge afflicts a \nCainite with bad luck. The thaumaturge must possess at least one Trait of \nthe target’s vitae, which disappears during the sending, after which the \nStoryteller should be informed of the ritual’s success so she can properly \ninterpret the consequences. For one scene, anything that can go wrong for \nthe character will - \nhe trips on his shoelaces as he enters a room, his car \nfails to start at a critical moment, or he alerts a firewall while he’s hacking \ninto a mainframe. \nThis ritual won’t do direct damage to the victim but should definitely \nmake the Jinxed person’s evening more interesting. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "Learning the Mind Enslumbered \nWith this ritual, a thaumaturge can determine the cause of a \nKindred’s torpor or demise. After placing a penny or other small coin \non the vampire’s eye, she will hear the Kindred’s spirit tell the \nparticulars of its current state. She may also invoke this power on a \nvampire’s ashen remains. The thaumaturge cannot carry on a conver- \nsation with the spirit. This power takes a full half-hour to perform and \nonly works on Kindred. \nMourning Life Curse \nAlthough this ritual causes no real physical harm (outside of \nblood loss) to mortals, it can be incredibly frightening to those who \nview it. The Warlock drinks a dram of thrice-distilled crocodile \nblood, then makes a paste of copal oil, ground eyebright and dates. He \nmay carry the paste until he finds a suitable target. When the \nthaumaturge wishes to enact this ritual, she must first dab the paste \nonto her target’s eyes (possibly requiring a challenge) and then \nwhisper a two-line incantation in his ear (the target must be able to \nhear the words to be affected by this ritual, although he may be \nasleep). The mortal then begins to uncontrollably weep bloody tears. \nThis unstoppable blood loss continues until the thaumaturge stops \nvisually concentrating upon the mortal. Thaumaturges performing \nthis ritual are unable to take any other actions, as the totality of their \nwill is focused on the mortal. The bleeding is painless but slow; one \nBlood Trait will be secreted for every five minutes. Some Tremere use \nthis to feed upon sleeping victims. \nPurge the Inner Demon \nAll Kindred face the Beast; thaumaturges developed this ritual to \ncontrol it. By pushing a sturdy pin through her own hand, the Warlock \ncauses a vampire’s Beast to be temporarily separated from her psyche. \nShe may be pulled out of frenzy by this ritual. In this state, she cannot \nbe made to frenzy by anything non-supernatural in nature, but she also \ngains the Negative Social Trait Submissive. This power lasts a number of \nhours equal to the caster’s Morality Traits. The thaumaturge may not use \nthis power on himself. \nRebirth Of Mortal Vanity \nOften a useful chip for bargaining with the Toreador, this ritual allows \na vampire to effectively “grow” hair. For every inch of hair he wishes, the \nrecipient of the ritual (whether the caster or another Kindred) must pluck \na hair from the head of a living human child. The thaumaturge then places \nthe hairs on a mirror and invokes the ritual. As the vampire’s hair begins \nto grow, the child’s hairs disappear into the surface of the mirror. Once the \nritual is finished, the hair ceases to grow, but the hair will remain at the \nnew length until cut. If it is ever cut shorter than it was at the vampire’s \nEmbrace, it will return to its original pre-ritual length the next sunset. \nNote that this ritual will not grow hair on a bald vampire, and the ritualist \ncannot change the color or other features of the hair. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The arrival of the telephone and e- \nmail has made the ritual mostly obsolete, but some tradition-minded \nregents will not accept a visitor who has not followed protocol. The caster \nboils a handful of ground tamarisk root in a pot of rainwater, then recites \nan incantation into the vapors that form over the water and adds a drop \nof galangal oil, then speaks a brief (30 second) message of introduction for \nthe regent of the city. The regent may reply telepathically for up to five \nminutes if she wishes. \nSanguineous Phial \nThis ritual enables the caster to mystically enchant a vessel so \nthat it will hold a quantity of blood without spoiling. The Warlock \nmust obtain a covered earthenware jar and bury it in the earth for \ntwo nights, after which she digs it up and crumbles an ash leaf into \nthe empty canister. Then the blood is poured in, and the jar is \nclosed and sealed with tallow from a candle. The blood remains \nfresh until the seal is broken; after the jar is opened, the blood will \nbegin to rot at a normal rate, but if the jar is broken, the blood \nimmediately decays as if it had never been preserved. This ritual \nmust be recast every time the thaumaturge wishes to preserve blood, \neven if she uses the same container. \nThe Scribe \nWith this power, the thaumaturge’s spoken words are mystically \ntranscribed into a written document. The document can take almost any \nform - \nthe words may appear in a bound book, on loose-leaf paper, on a \nwall, the head of apin or whatever, but clarity may be sacrificed (100 pages \nwill not translate onto a notecard without difficulty). Some younger \nWarlocks even use this to mimic a computer’s speech recognition pro- \ngram. Note that the transcription is literal - \nthe ritual will not improve \na speaker’s quality or clarity. The caster may also lay this ritual on another \nwith the same effects, but must crush a bird’s beak or lizard’s tongue \nbetween her thumb and forefinger each time. This power lasts for one \nscene, or until the thaumaturge chooses to end it. \nSense The Mystical \nThis ritual enables the thaumaturge to sense magical effects and \nenchanted objects. The Warlock chants non-stop for five minutes to \ninvoke this power, then carries a lit candle with him. When the \ncandlelight finds an object or effect touched by blood-related magic, the \nitem glitters. This power will sense any kind of blood-related magic \n(including Thaumaturgy, Necromancy and the user) as long as it is \ncurrently being invoked, any magically created or manipulated items \nand, at the Storyteller’s discretion, any traces of True Magick in the area \nof the candle’s light. This power does not distinguish between the \ndifferent types of magic it reveals and lasts for one scene. It is not \ntriggered by “normal” Disciplines. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Although the creation of the spiced wine \nrequires a Trait of the caster’s vitae, Kindred feeding from mortals under the \ninfluence of the enspelled beverage need not worry about becoming blood \nbound to the caster; all supernatural properties of the thaumaturge’s blood are \ndissolved into the trim. \nMortals drinking the concoction suffer the Negative Traits Submissive \nand Lethargic, and any details about the evening they try to remember later \nwill be fuzzy and indistinct. The power of the oinos lasts until sunrise. \nWhispers Of The Ghost \nThis ritual, when combined with the Auspex power of Psychic Projec- \ntion, enables the ritualist to speak directly into the material world while \nin his astral form. After weaving the spell, the Cainite may only speak in \nwhispers to the physical world (he cannot be seen or touched).

By mixing a Blood \nTrait with dead rose petals and speaking the incantation, the ritualist makes \nit impossible for the target to keep blood in her system; for every Blood Trait \nabove three the target possesses, she spends one turn vomiting it from her \nbody. The Kindred cannot retain more than three Blood Traits in her body \nfor the duration of the ritual; if she attempts to drink more, she immediately \nsuffers severe nausea and vomiting until the extra blood is gone. While this \nloss of blood will not induce torpor, it may require the vampire to make a \nhunger frenzy check (at the Storyteller’s discretion). This power lasts for an \nentire evening. This power will not work on those Kindred who are older \nthan the caster. \nCleansing Of The Flesh \nWith the spread of blood plagues such as AIDS, Kindred often find \nthemselves unwitting carriers of these unflattering “social” diseases. A \nWarlock wishing to rid himself of these kinds of maladies must spend a \nfull night in a bathtub (or cauldron) filled with purified water, bleeding \nall but the tiniest drop of blood from his body. As the blood is diffused \ninto the water, any addictions and diseases (non-supernatural) the \nKindred’s body might carry are bled out. This ritual may be performed \nupon another Kindred; in this case, the subject must lie in the water, \nhaving opened his own veins, while the thaumaturge chants for the \ncourse of the night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

A Dream Catcher is an intensely \npersonal talisman composed of the target’s hair, spittle, blood and \nother sympathetic links. Owners of these “shields” are afforded more \nprotection against any ghostly attack (spirits trying to adversely affect \nthe owner are two Traits down to do so); also, the oneiromancer who \ncrafted the artifact is granted a two-Trait bonus when affecting its \nowner with that path, while other oneiromancers attempting to do so \ntake a two-Trait penalty. This power lasts until the artifact is lost, \nstolen or destroyed. \nThe Curse Belated \nThis ritual is used to safeguard particularly precious ghouls against \nuntimely death, especially when they are being considered for Em- \nbrace. By increasing the power of the vampiric blood running through \nhis thrall’s veins, the ritualist all but insures the mortal’s survival; \nthe instant a ghoul under this spell dies (in any way) the infused vitae \nin her body will revive her as a Kindred within 10 minutes (ghouls \nwho die in a particularly mangled state should probably be given the \nFlaw: Permanent Wound or something else appropriate when they \nreturn as Kindred). To cast this ritual, the thaumaturge willingly \nloses one permanent Blood Trait, which is returned to the caster’s \nblood pool when the ghoul dies. The inaccessible Blood Trait re- \nmains in the ghoul’s system and may not be used to power Disciplines \nor be lost in any way. If someone else attempts to Embrace the \nenspelled ghoul, the mortal will revive as a Kindred - \nas the childe \nof the thaumaturge who cast the spell. The thaumaturge must brand \nthe target ghoul with his sigil, which disappears when the ghoul \nawakens as undead. \nInfirm Inert \nOne of the most powerful properties of a Kindred’s vitae is its ability \nto heal the vampire of nearly any trauma; this ritual deprives a Kindred of \nthat advantage, rendering her impotent to close her wounds. The \nthaumaturge must first imbibe a small quantity of blood laced with \nlaudanum (which will grant the caster the Negative Physical Trait \nLethargic for the scene immediately following the casting); after that, he \nonly need smear a tiny bit of his blood onto the victim’s skin to bestow the \ncurse upon her for the rest of the evening. The target may not be aware of \nthe change until she first attempts to heal. She may spend a Willpower \nTrait to negate this effect for one turn. When the ritual expires, she may \nheal as normal, according to the level of damage. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "Major Creation (Path of Conjuring) \nWhile the Path of Conjuring is limited with regard to the size of the \nitems created, this ritual gives the conjurer more range. It requires the \ncaster to sever her thumb (requiring the expenditure of a temporary \nWillpower); the digit disappears when the enlarged item is successfully \nconjured, although it will regenerate at a normal rate. After this ritual is \ncast, the thaumaturge may now spend either two or three temporary \nMental Traits to make a summoned item either double or triple the size he \ncan normally conjure. Note that this ritual works in conjunction with \nwhatever power of the path the caster is using (so combining this with \nSummon The Simple Form will still only enable basic items to be conjured, \nbut now they can be bigger basic items). \nOnce the thumb is consumed by the ritual, the thaumaturge can no \nlonger create enlarged objects until the ritual is recast. \nReturn of the Heart (Path of the Blood’s Curse) \nThis ritual overwhelms the target with human guilt. By mixing a Trait \nof the victim’s blood with the tears of an infant, the thaumaturge forces \nthe victim to reflect upon her past actions through the eyes of an \ninnocent. While this does not affect a Path rating, the Cainite behaves for \nthe rest of the evening as if she had a Morality rating of 5 and is governed \nby the Path of Humanity. This will probably result in several Conscience/ \nConviction Virtue tests, at the Storyteller’s discretion. This power is \nparticularly terrible against Sabbat elders, who may be destroyed by their \npackmates for such “weakness.” \nScry \nThe thaumaturge causes a body of water, whether natural or \nartificial, to become a scrying pool after mixing it with owl’s blood. \nThe water must be relatively still, and confined pools no larger than \na bathtub work better than open lakes. The caster can either concen- \ntrate on a known location he has visited or a person; if spying upon \na person, the ritualist must possess an object of personal significance \nto the target. Auspex or other powers may not be used while Scrying \nto “remotely” affect the victim. The thaumaturge may not change the \ntarget of the Scry once cast; for example, if the focus is a location, it \nwill remain locked on that area for the duration of the ritual. This \npower lasts for 10 minutes, although viewing time may be lengthened \nby the expenditure of one temporary Mental Trait for each additional \n10 minutes. \nStolen Kisses \nThaumaturges use this macabre power when they do not wish to, or \nare unable to, feed by fang. By making a small incision on her body and \nperforming the ritual (which requires that the thaumaturge always carry \na “witch’s kiss” - \na thistle steeped in vampiric vitae), the ritualist seals \nthe self-inflicted wound into an undetectable mouthlike sucker which \nonly opens when pressed against a mortal’s warm flesh, and which can \nmystically drain blood from the vessel.

The “mouth” will \nlast until sunrise. \nTelecommunication \nIn these nights, precocious Tremere are relying more on electronic \ndevices than the animal spies and familiars of yesteryear. With this \nritual, any television the thaumaturge has touched in the last week may \nnow be used as both an “eye” into the room as well as a device for \nbeguiling those watching the set. The thaumaturge, by performing this \nritual and dropping into a meditative state, may observe everything from \na “television’s-eye-view” and can also regulate any images or sounds the \ntelevision generates, from changing the channel to crafting a fake \nbroadcast.

By uttering mystical \nsyllables and spilling a Trait of her vitae upon the ground where the infidel \nis known to have worked Thaumaturgy within the past 24 hours, the caster \nmay then be able to track the magus for the rest of the evening. This tracking \nfollows the exact path the other magus took after leaving the area where the \nmagic was worked.

They are ill-tempered and edgy. Psychics, the \nmentally ill and other sensitive beings across the globe experience \nspontaneous and uncontrollable visions of these events, but such \nvisions are allegorical and oracular in nature rather than providing \nexplicit news of what is transpiring. \nThree Cathayan bodhisattvas (the most powerful of Cathayans), recog- \nnize the situation for what it is and move with their acolytes and allies to \nintercept the antediluvian. \nA C T  Two: THE THIRD \nN I C ~ H T  \nOn the third night, the Antediluvian and the three bodhisattvas meet in \nbattle. One of the Cathayans summons forth a hurricane, both as a weapon \nand as a shield against the sun so they can continue the fight into the \nBangladeshi day. Another weakens the Gauntlet and calls forth the creatures \nof the spirit worlds to aid in the battle. Thousands of Bangladeshis die in the \nresultant flooding. \nThe Technocracy has taken note of these developments and responds \nby declaring Code Ragnarok - \nan alert condition that results from a threat \nto the entire planet. They bring giant solar reflector satellites to direct and \nconcentrate the light of the sun upon the site of the battle. They also fight \nthe hurricane with their techno-magical aircraft, and finally, they dropped \na handful of Hellstorm neutron bombs - \nmagically enhanced nuclear \ndevices - \non the battlefield. \nThe battle with the three Cathayans weakened the Antediluvian. \nThough the nearby nuclear detonations kills the bodhisattvas as well as all \nother beings in the area, it further weakens the Antediluvian enough that \nwhen the clouds part, the light of four suns, reflected by the satellites above, \nshine down and obliterate it. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

For \nmost creatures, the world seems to return to normal: Those who are \ntrapped in visions abruptly recover, and the unnatural nightmares fade \ninto the past. \nFor the Ravnos, the horror has just begun. Each Ravnos hears the \ndeath cry of the Antediluvian, full of wrath and hunger. The creature’s \nfinal act before it meets its Final Death is to send a command to all its \nchilder to hunt each other down and destroy each other, purging the \nworld of all its progeny. This affects all Ravnos, regardless of sect \naffiliation, blood bonds, Vaulderie, torpor or any other conditions. In \nareas where there is only a solitary Ravnos, that vampire need only \ncontend with the unnatural hunger, but should one Ravnos meet \nanother, each is consumed by an overwhelming, cannibalistic bloodlust \nand attacks on sight. Over the next three nights, the Ravnos slay each \nother, and then the curse abruptly fades away, leaving confusion, \nsuspicion and very few Ravnos. \nT H E  EPILOC~UE \nThree days after the Final Death of the Ravnos Antediluvian, the last \nof the mystical effects of the Week of Nightmares fade. The surviving \nRavnos lose their abnormal bloodlust. Most Kindred return to unlife as \nusual, though some, those who have an inkling of understanding of the \nevents and those who realize that they do not, find reason to question the \nvalidity of the status quo. \nAll told, the Week of Nightmares racks up quite a body count: The \nRavnos Antediluvian and three of the most powerful Cathayans are \nthe most noteworthy casualties. Over a million mortals and uncounted \nsupernatural beings in Bangladesh die from the hurricane, the battle \nand the Technocracy’s Hellstorm devices, though the supernatural \nnature of these events is quickly covered up. Beyond Bangladesh, most \nof Clan Ravnos fall prey to each other following the dying curse of \ntheir ancestor - \nby the end of the week, there are perhaps a hundred \nRavnos left in the world, none of whom are elders. All of this happened \nwhen a single Antediluvian rose. The question remains: What might \nhappen when the rest awaken? \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

After all, the rising of Antediluvians is strictly \nagainst Camarilla policy, and no prince wants his subjects listening to such \nbalderdash.

And if there \nis more than a single Ravnos present, it is almost guaranteed that at best, \nonly one will survive. \nWhat is a Storyteller to do when her chronicle has three Ravnos, and the \nWeek ofNightmares will leave at most one of them standing?

This is especially \ntrue in a situation like the Week of Nightmares, where fatalities are \nalmost guaranteed in one segment of the vampiric population while the \nrest face only a marginal increase in their usual nightly danger. This is \na case of deciding what knowledge the player can handle without \nadversely affecting his role in the chronicle. In some cases it is best to tell \nthe player outright that his character stands a good chance of experienc- \ning Final Death in the next couple of sessions.

Hopefully they can \nbe convinced to keep their speculations under wraps, both for the sake \nof the other players and because such knowledge could help them in \nthe coming fight against one another. This option should only be used \nif you believe that this level of mutual antagonism would not trauma- \ntize any of the players involved. \nAll things being equal (and they rarely are), you will likely be able to \nguess who, of a group of Ravnos, will come out on top.

In any case, unless some of \nthe players are willing to take the fall for the sake of the story, it is almost \nguaranteed to be a bad idea to play favorites or try to arrange for a certain \nRavnos’ victory over the others. \nThe Dramatic Exit: Another possible solution involves recruiting \nthe players to take an active role in their characters’ demise. When faced \nwith the certainty of character death, many players will rise to the \noccasion and make certain that the death will be one that is remembered \nfor years. If you believe you have a player who can handle the responsibil- \nity, this can be the most rewarding way of handling the situation. With \nthis option, the player can come to see the story as not just a story about \nunlife in an unfair world, but the epic saga of her demise - \nand a chance \nto “inadvertently” leave her comrades in deep trouble as they must clean \nup whatever mess her death caused. \nThe Consolation Prize: Some players are unwilling to take the death \nof their characters quietly. For some of them, they have invested too much \ninto the character to willingly let it go; others are just munchkins. It may be \nnecessary to offer them some sort of consolation prize, a bribe, to do what \nother players do freely. This prize usually takes the form of special treatment \nfor his next character: “If you don’t create a big stink about dying, I’ll let you \nplay the Camarilla mole you wanted to play.” It usually sets a dangerous \nprecedent to offer bribes in these cases, but if the player is worth it overall, \nor if you want to reward a player who did not ask for compensation but \nplayed her death well, do so. Just remember that future fatalities may expect \nsimilar treatment. \nThe Plant: If there are no Ravnos in the chronicle, or if you feel that \nthe current number of Ravnos is inadequate for the task, there may be \nanother solution. If you have a spare player or aNarrator who has wanted \nto just play a single character for a while, you may introduce more \nRavnos into the chronicle for the sole purpose of enhancing the expe- \nrience of the Week of Nightmares. Any Ravnos brought in for this \npurpose should be warned that their stay will be rather brief, but some \nplayers enjoy playing marginal characters to whom they need not feel \nany real attachment. The introduction of these characters needs to be \ncarefully managed so it is not obvious that they are only being brought \nin to add to the body count. \nA E T E R T H E  \nSHOW \nIt is possible that the Week of Nightmares will come and go before the \nplayers in the chronicle have figured out what is happening - \nquite likely in \nfact - \nunless someone has friends in very high places. Fortunately, the long- \nterm effects of the waking of the Antediluvian are more than enough to make \nthose nights come back and haunt everyone. \nE P I L O C ~ U E  \nEVENTS \nYou the Storyteller have quite a menu of tricks and events you can use \nto drive home the long-term implications in the aftermath of the Week of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Whether you deploy these according to a precise schedule you \nprepared in advance, interject them on an ad hoc basis where you feel the \nchronicle could benefit or ignore them completely depends on your designs \nfor the chronicle. Used properly, these elements can make the Week of \nNightmares a dire portent of things to come or a call for planning and \naction; used improperly, they add little more than chaos to an already \nconfused situation. \nRumors from Near and Far: Regardless of the state of the home city \nof the chronicle, rumors filter in from neighboring cities as soon as the \nlines of communication permit. It could come from the mouths of ghoul \ncouriers, secret IRC chat rooms, hushed phone calls, solemn board \nmeetings or any of the hundreds of ways vampires have discovered for \ncommunicating with each other. \nIt is safe to say that the earliest rumors will be the most confused \nand incoherent, but they will also be the least touched by the “official \nversion” of whoever controls the source. As time passes, princes and \nbishops will establish “what really happened” in their domains. You \nmight want to use this as a way of illustrating the mood of the various \nlocations that surround the home city, stressing whichever aspects you \nfind most interesting. Alternatively, you might use the similarity of \nreports from wide-ranging places to impress upon the characters the \nuniversality of their experience. As time progresses, the quality of \nwhat is reported from Sabbat and Camarilla territories will probably \ndiverge, and if the characters have access to information across sect \nlines, you can use this information to highlight the strengths and \nweaknesses of the sects in your chronicle. You may also use it to \nforeshadow power plays or larger changes in sect direction. Though \nmost rumors are just clues or distractions, each one could be a seed for \nsome future development in the chronicle. \nAs time progresses, the stories will probably diverge in three \ndirections: the urban legend, the official story and the carefully re- \nsearched truth. Telling one from the other will, of course, be difficult. \nOf these, the urban legend is probably the most entertaining - \nthat is \nwhy such stories are so enduring. The story of the Ravnos in Glasgow \nwho somehow grew 10 heads and vowed that she would diablerize a \ndifferent vampire with each head and was seen by a Nosferatu only one \ncity away is the sort of tale that could terrorize a neonate. It also \ncontains just that hint of what went on to almost have the resonance \nof truth. Besides, the World of Darkness is a big place, and stranger \nthings have happened .... Other rumors may take the form of con- \nspiracy theories, difficult to disprove, seductively plausible, and pointing \ntoward the creator’s scapegoat of choice. At the other end of the \nspectrum, the official story is probably far less entertaining, but it is \nalso probably a little more comforting. For both Camarilla and Sabbat \nvampires, their respective official stories will justify what they are \ndoing and remind them that they are on the right track - leaders \nalmost always justify the status quo.

Conspiracy theories may be \npopular among the purveyors of official truth as well, so long as their \nenemies are at the core of the conspiracy. To do otherwise runs the \nunpleasant risk that the underlings will figure out that their masters \nare lying, which often has inconvenient consequences. Finally, rarest \nof the rare, there will be those vampires who manage to figure out some \nof the truth and carefully spread it to those they feel deserving. As any \nStoryteller knows, there is nothing like the select reporting of accurate \ninformation to keep everyone guessing. \nCamarilla Denial: Clearly it was a massive hoax. Or it was a bizarre \nform of lunacy caused by those thrice-accursed Lupines. Or it was \nnothing at all. \nCamarilla doctrine denies the existence of the Antediluvians and \nspecifically denies that they are going to rise from their torpid slumber and \ndevour all of their descendants. So how does the largest organization of \nKindred on the Earth handle the Week of Nightmares? By denying it, of \ncourse. Accepting that an Antediluvian stalked the Indian subcontinent \nand was able to affect vampires around the world is just too close to Sabbat \ndoctrine. Some princes will offer their own reasonable explanations for \nthe strangeness. Some princes will recognize that there is strength - \nand \nplausibility- \nin numbers and form a united front of disinformation. Some \nprinces will simply claim that what happened was not at all out of the \nordinary. Some of them might actually believe these lies, but many will \nonly be using them to pacify their charges while they frantically attempt \nto come up with some plan to allow their surviving a Gehenna that now \nseems all too close. \nThis dichotomy between what happened and what is said to have \nhappened could result in some serious changes in the night-to-night \noperation of the city. Anyone who publicly argues that an Antediluvian did \nawaken is just asking for correction of one sort or another, and a prince who \nis unable to keep such blatant lies at bay might find his city visited by an \narchon. At the same time the lesser Kindred are being kept in the dark, or \nat least being kept quiet, anyone in the know has motive to hunt down \nwhatever lore she can find. Also, fragments of the Book of Nod and scholars \nthereof stand to become even more valuable, so long as they can keep their \nknowledge from falling into the wrong ears. \nMany of the city’s lesser Kindred may know that something has hap- \npened, but not what. Even a few months of unlife should warn vampires that \nthe elders are not entirely concerned with their well-being and that there are \nenough secrets floating about that it is best to try to unearth the truth before \nit comes after you with fangs and claws. And if the elders are not offering any \nanswers, it is time to look for someone who is. \nSabbat Propaganda: Naturally, the Sabbat wants the word out: The \nAntediluvians are real. We were right. \nIt is never that straightforward, though, even among the Sabbat, \nwho are often stereotyped as simpler than other vampires.

Sabbat \npolitics are fractious enough without the added pressure of Gehenna \nstarting ahead of schedule. In theory, all Sabbat agree that the \nAntediluvians must be destroyed, but no one seems to agree on who \nshould lead the forces. \nMuch like the Camarilla, the various leaders of the Sabbat will be \ndoing their best to see that the rabble is kept occupied while they try to \nfigure out how best to turn this situation to their advantage. The \nambitious will need to act with greater speed, and the wary will need to \nuse even greater caution. Noddist scholars will almost certainly collabo- \nrate, debate and fight with eachother. Afew will share their information, \nseeking to unravel the truth before it is too late. Others will hoard their \nhard-won knowledge lest it be used against them now that all vampires’ \nnights are numbered. \nAmong the lower echelons, priests who craft new ritae taking the events of \nthe Week of Nightmares into account may find that they have gained greater \nrenown. Pack leaders who lack greater vision will keep their packmates in fighting \nform - \nand try to find a couple good places to hide if it becomes necessary. \nIndependent Curiosity: Perhaps more than any other vampires, the \nindependent clans want to know exactly what happened. In addition to \nthose surviving Ravnos, the four remaining independent clans need to \ndetermine what is happening and what they can do to protect themselves. \nIn most cases, this will involve trying to get as much accurate information \nabout the events of the Week of Nightmares as possible and to do \nwhatever they can to protect themselves and increase their own power. It \nmay involve spying on the other clans to see what they know or what they \nare planning. It may involve trying to create alliances in which neither \nside necessarily trusts the other. Feel free to use this opportunity to \nstrengthen intra-clan ties or allow internal bickering to create chinks in \na previously unified front. \nFor the Assamites, the Week of Nightmares could not only repre- \nsent an inconvenience in fulfilling one of their contracts, it could force \nthem to step up their efforts against the children of Khayyin.

Many independent Gangrel may retain loose ties to their \nclanmates within the Camarilla, so they may show up to exchange \nstories. The Gangrel and the Ravnos have stood against each other \nalmost as long there were Gangrel and Ravnos clans.

Of course, some \nvampires may put two and two together and realize that this all hap- \npened suspiciously soon after Clan Gangrel’s departure from the \nCamarilla: Clan Gangrel must be the instigators of all this madness. \nWhile the Giovanni would seem to be in the best position to obtain \ninformation about the Week of Nightmares using their wraithly connec- \ntions, those wraiths in a position to see what happened were all destroyed \nby the Technocracy’s hellstorm bombs. And though it would seem \nbeneficial having their progenitor as one of the more active members of \nthe Third Generation, rumors about the Harbingers of Skulls are enough \nto keep Giovanni on their toes. It is only natural that the Followers of \nSet would want to use this opportunity to extend their influence over \nthe rest. A confused situation where powerful people want hard-to-find \ninformation is a potential windfall for those who have information to \noffer. It need not be accurate information, of course, just enough to \nencourage dependence or cement an alliance. And while they are \noffering information to those who crave it, the Setites will be seeking \nthe truth for themselves, not that they would ever admit it. \nIn many ways, the plight of the independents is a more honest \nreaction to the Week of Nightmares than the reactions of the Camarilla \nand Sabbat. You can use these reactions as a sort of reality check against \nthe actions of the grand sects, you can use them as extra boogeymen to \nfurther confuse things, or you can just ignore them and concentrate on \nthe clans at hand. \nBacklash against the Remaining Ravnos: The Ravnos, like all vampires, \nhave made many enemies. They have had a reputation as annoying bastards \nfor millennia, and spending a night with more mystic power than usual \nfollowed by half a week of bloodthirsty fratricide has probably not improved \npublic opinion. Some might even blame the entire Week of Nightmares on \nthe Ravnos: They were the most active during it, after all. In the past, \nindividual Ravnos had the protection of their clan. If a prince gave one \nRavnos too much grief, he would soon find that he had more Ravnos dropping \nby than he could handle. \nUnfortunately for the Ravnos, it will not take long after the Week of \nNightmares for people to figure out that there are far fewer Ravnos around \nthan there used to be. And once that happens, some vampires’ thoughts \nwill turn to revenge. The Ravnos who wronged that particular vampire \nmight be long dead, but there are always those who will see any clanmate \nas an acceptable substitute. Fortunately for the Ravnos, it will take a while \nfor most vampires to figure out how complete the devastation is. The \nRavnos have never been popular, so many of them have learned to lie \nabout their heritage. Of course, others just lied for the hell of it. Still, \neventually someone will realize how few Ravnos there are, and the word \nwill spread, and vampires will do what they always have done for the \nunderdog - \neat him. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

In and of itself, \nthis is not a new development. What will be new is that a large number \nof vampires will actively be searching for ancient lore for the first time \nin their unlives, a situation that opens a world of possibilities for a \ncunning Storyteller. \nOne of the most obvious developments from this turn of events is \nthat vampires who possess such arcane knowledge - \nor are able to \nconvince others that they do - \nwill find a marked increase in their \nperceived importance. They may be courted by princes and primogen, \nbishops and paladins.

And, of \ncourse, there will be the charlatans who are adept at sounding pro- \nfound and producing forgeries that tell their audience what they most \nwant to hear. Vampires are not the only creatures that will seek to \nprofit from this situation; there is no shortage of demons that are more \nthan willing to offer information - \naccurate or not - \nto those who are \nwilling to pay the price. \nBeyond the active players, is the information itself: moldy tomes, \nlost fragments of the Book of Nod, ancient manuscripts, recently un- \nearthed icons with strange writing and all such stuff will be in high \ndemand. Depending on the needs of the chronicle - \nor the ingenuity of \nthe players - \nthese could be vital clues or simple McGuffins designed \nto keep the rabble busy. \nGehenna Cults: For centuries, some vampires have believed that the \nkey to surviving Gehenna lies not in universal camaraderie and blind \nacceptance of leadership, but in secrecy and selective solidarity. Some of \nthese secret societies are new developments, spawned by the apparent \napproach of Gehenna; others are centuries, perhaps even millennia old. \nSome have members who span the globe; others are strictly local affairs. \nSome seek to avert Gehenna entirely, others seek defense against the \nAntediluvians, still others seek to curry favor with these ancient crea- \ntures.

      "text": "sects. Though most have a tiny membership, the only common element \namong Gehenna cults is a covert plan for the members to survive the \nimpending doom in some way. \nThere are two obvious reasons for the aftermath of the Week of \nNightmares to involve Gehenna cults. The first is that many of the \nestablished cults (See Time of Thin Blood, pp. 55-60 for some of the more \nprominent Gehenna cults) will perceive this as a sign that Gehenna is \nnigh and will be very interested in those who seem more involved with \nthese events. Some might take an interest in those who were in the throes \nof visions or even the few surviving Ravnos. Whether this interest takes \nthe form of observation, questioning, thaumaturgical experimentation or \nsomething else entirely depends on the nature of the cult and the \ndesperation - \nor determination - \nof the vampires involved. The second \nform of Gehenna cult involvement occurs when someone takes the events \nof the Week of Nightmares to heart and decides to form her own cult. \nUnless the new cult had some special source of information and a great \ndeal of subtlety, it is probably doomed to failure. The Camarilla disap- \nproves of Gehenna cults for doctrinal reasons, and the Sabbat does not \nwant its members loyal to any organization other than itself. Even if it is \nnot destroyed outright, a new cult stands a good chance of being infil- \ntrated and used as a pawn. Those who are interested in what power and \ninformation the new cult has may monitor it for that reason while \nsomeone who is only interested in keeping track of the dissidents in the \ncity could use it to gather the Noddists together for easier monitoring. \nTHE \nSOLE SURVIVOR \nSo there is still a Ravnos in the chronicle who did not meet Final Death? \nEven the surviving Ravnos are not in the clear. \nThree nights of blood thirst and fratricidal madness can do a lot \nto alienate wherever the survivor calls home. Even without the \nprohibitions against attacking vampires (and diablerie, should the \nRavnos be in a Camarilla city) and drawing the attention of the \nmortals, raving madness is not a popular trait.

And if the Ravnos committed diablerie, she may soon \ndiscover that others can tell merely by looking at her. In fact, if she \nwas in the throes of frenzy while doing the deed, others may discover \nit before she does. \nAlso, there is the lack of support. One of the benefits of belonging \nto a clan is that clanmates will look after their own. Ravnos never had \nthe reputation as the most militant of clans, but other vampires were \ncareful about harassing them too much because it could draw the wrath \nof the rest of the clan. Having a party of trickster vampires arrive in town \nbecause the prince killed one of their sisters was never a pleasant \nsituation. With most of the clan gone, many vampires are looking to the \nsurvivors to redress old humiliations - \nothers just think of it as open \nseason on Ravnos for the fun of it. \nThere are a few potential benefits to being a Ravnos who survived \nthe Week of Nightmares, but they are limited at best. For example, it is \npossible that a Ravnos under the influence of the Antediluvian’s death \ncurse might have managed to lower her generation during one of her \nfrenzied binges. Sadly, the lack of elders of her clan to teach her the \nhigher powers of Chimerstry will probably hinder her studying them. \nAnother possible benefit is the reduced competition for herd space \namong the Gypsies. Unfortunately, many of the Roma are rather leery of \nanyone claiming to be Ravnos, especially after the stories of their three- \nnight bout of madness and blood thirst. Additionally, the Gangrel, \nespecially those who have left the Camarilla might be looking to move \noccupy these openings. Possibly the most useful development for the few \nsurvivors is the potential for anonymity. Ravnos are now so rare that \nalmost no one will believe that the new Lick in town is from that lost \nclan. This leaves the stage open for as much fun as the vampire can get \naway with - \nuntil the work started by her Antediluvian gets taken up \nby the rest of the Third Generation. \nTHE BLACK HAND \nWhen one imagines the organizations of the Kindred world, there are \nthe Sabbat, the Camarilla, the mysterious Inconnu and those vampires \nwho claim to stand outside all sect concerns, but in that act, are them- \nselves parceled into organization - \nthe independent clans, the anarchs, \nthe Autarkis.

The passing of the \n“True Black Hand” has reverberated through the Sabbat and into the \nWorld of Darkness itself. \nThere are few certainties regarding the cult - \nafter all, anything that \nhas its origins in human prehistory must be clouded with supposition. \nMost cults rarely leave step-by-step instructions regarding their world \ndomination plans.

All that remains are fragments pieced together \nfrom the accounts of survivors, describing what is both horror unimagined \nand hubris unchecked. \nThe True Black Hand was said to have sprung up in the ancient \nMiddle East, long past the nights of the First and Second Cities, founded \nby a cult of mortal magicians studying death and the afterlife; some \ncalled this gathering the Tal’mahe’Ra. The early magicians made con- \ntact with Cainites, and the two groups traded knowledge, each attempting \nto understand the other’s craft, without success. Cainites could not learn \nmortal magic nor could the magicians learn Disciplines. In pursuit of \nknowledge, some of the magicians accepted the Embrace at the cost of \ntheir mortal gifts. As the new vampires learned more of the mythology \nbehind their condition and shared their knowledge with their mortal \nbrethren, the cult determined that the loss of the Antediluvians held \nback the world from its potential. Henceforth, the cult would bend its \nentire effort to the revival of the Third Generation, ushering in a new \nage of magical potential under the will of the Antediluvians. In modern \nparlance, the group would be considered a Gehenna cult, albeit one that \nhad both mortal and vampiric followers. \nAs so frequently happens, the Cainites gradually wrested control of the \ncult from the mortal magicians, turning the mortals to serve their own \nschemes. Around 500 BC, the magicians left and founded a society of their \nown devoted to the study of death and fate. Mortal descendants of these early \nwizards tell a vastly different tale of the society’s origins that makes no \nmention of a secret society of vampires; it would seem to be left to outsiders \nto judge which makes a better tale - \nvampires who prefer living in the \nUnderworld or immortal mages who risk a magical backlash should they dwell \nin physical reality. \nWith the cult’s composition and means altered to a Cainite perspective, \nthe vampires expanded their studies, spreading into Europe. They were \nunsuccessful in learning the secrets of mortal blood-magicians, but did \nsucceed in infiltrating mortal instutions. During this era, the cult’s masters of \nvampiric studies created new Disciplines exclusive to their ranks, which \ncontinued to evolve for several centuries to come. \nAround 450 AD, something happened that caused the Tal’mhe’Rah \nto fracture. Survivors debate the reasons for this, and everyone seems to \nhave a particular theory regarding the hows and whys. Some blamed it \non Setite influence, others on the Inconnu or on vampires who were too \nreluctant or eager for the group to study the Underworld. More outland- \nish tales pointed to beings and intelligences from unknowable places \nthat infiltrated the group. Whatever the reason, the cult split into the \nWestern branch (which focused on mortal concerns) and the Eastern \nbranch (which followed a more mystic bent). Somewhere around this \ntime, the group’s Latin name, Manus Nigrum, came into use. As the \ninternal squabbles resulted in more notice, victims and observers termed \nthese half-glimpsed machinators “the Manus Nzgrum”. The name even- \ntually stuck. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The results were not \nwhat was intended - \nthe Inquisition did benefit from the organization and \nstrength, turning its fury on those careless vampires found hiding in the midst \nof humanity. But it was only the youth (who posed little threat to the Manus \nNigrum) that fed the flames; the elders, the original targets, proved more \ncapable of escape. None in the cult paused to consider that the ensuing \ndisaster could have been of their own making, or that their strategy was \nflawed. Instead, the leaders pressed on, blaming the events on enemies real \nand imagined, and apparently heedless that the vampires avoiding the \nslaughter were the ones who could most challenge the Manus Nigrum’s power \nand control over mortals. \nDOWN \nAMONGTHE \nDEAD \nM E N  \nIn between their attempts to direct the focus of the fire they had \nunleashed, the cult continued with its earlier pursuits into insights of death \nand magic. During an expedition into the Underworld of the dead, Manus \nNigrum explorers encountered the memory of a city that they believed was the \nEnoch of legend, the First City founded by Caine. \nA word of explanation becomes necessary here. The Underworld is \nbelieved to stretch to infinity, below the surface, as it were, of the living \nlands. If one were to enter the deadlands, one would first encounter the \nShadowlands, so called because they mirror the appearance of the living \nworld (albeit through a darker reflection of death and decay). Below the \nShadowlands boils the Tempest, a perpetually raging storm of spirit \ncreated from the debris of emotion and memory of the mortal world. \nOccasionally, islands of calm can be found in this storm, and it was on \none such island that this next crucial piece of the Manus Nigrum’s \nhistory was found. \nWas the city truly the memory of legendary Enoch? After all, things \nof great personal importance can materialize in the Underworld once \nthey’ve been destroyed. Or could it merely have been the sum total of \nvampiric dreams, hopes and fears of Enoch, perhaps the remnants of the \ndreams of the Antediluvians? None could say for certain, but to the \nManus Nigrum, only the first possibility counted. Surely this was re- \nvealed only to the faithful for their own use. The cult’s eldest Eastern \nmembers and more mystically inclined Westerners settled in Enoch and \nmade extensive studies of the city’s treasures, seeking clues to the \nAntediluvians’ purpose. \nDuring the early occupation, the settlers found the tombs of four \nbeings called the Aralu down in Enoch’s foundations. The inscriptions \non the tombs suggested these creatures might be Antediluvians. Over \ntime, the explorers had dreams clearly sent by the Aralu that used \nfamiliar symbols from cult rituals.

They squabbled amongst each other almost as often \nas non-member Kindred and were not above stereotyping or blaming each \nother for mishaps. \nThe cult was never very large to begin with. Its sum total membership was \nbetween 150 to 200 vampires (with occasional lapses during crises). With the \nformation of the Camarilla and Sabbat, the cult divided itself between the two \nsects and independent Kindred enclaves. These latter ones made their homes \nin the Middle East, central Asia or India. The cult also attracted non-Kindred \nsupernatural members to its ranks by its studies into the afterlife. Wraiths were \nthe most common of these, followed by death-magicians and other, less well- \nknown creatures. \nThe majority of members came from the following clans and bloodlines: \nAssamite untitribu - A few Assamites helped found the cult and \nrecruited members in the wake of the Tremere curse. They believed they were \nthe protectors of those brethren who flocked to the Sabbat. \nTrue Brujah - \nThis bloodline’s members claimed direct descent from \nBrujah, rather than from Troile, who had diablerized his/her (Troile’s \ngender remains a mystery) sire. The True Brujah differ from their brethren \nin Disciplines and psychology. Some Manus Nigrum members speculated \nthat the bloodline was much younger and had diablerized its way to \nrespectable old age, but such insults usually brought intricately plotted \nrevenge from the offended party. \nGangrel and untitribu - The cult respected this clan as the \nkeepers of the old, pure traditions, and thus good servants of the \nAntediluvians. Gangrel who went to the Camarilla, or City Gangrel, \nwere viewed as traitors. \nMalkavians and antitribu - The cult’s lore claimed that favored \nvampires had received dreams from the Antediluvians, so mystical insights \nwere held in high regard.

The cult had experimented to \nfuse mortal death magic with vampirism; the result was considered a \nperfect fusion of the worst blasphemies of Eastern religions. The Nagaraja’s \nsurvival depended on the most despicable predatory acts, and their very \nunlives cut them off from the cycle of reincarnation. The bloodline can \npractice none of the major tenets of Buddhism or Hinduism, the religions \nof their mortal lives. Whenever the bloodline came to the attention of \nHindu or Buddhist vampires (not to mention moderately devout mortals \nor Kuei-jin), purges inevitably followed. The bloodline found safety only \nwithin the Manus Nigrum. \nNosferatu and untitribu - \nThose Nosferatu who joined the cult usually \ndid so believing they could purge their clan’s sin against Caine without \nactually dying. Caught between suicidal despair and fratricidal rage, they \noften succumbed to their own anguish. \nToreador and untitribu -Toreador \nprovided aesthetic insight to the \ncult’s spiritual teachings and valuable connections to the mortal world. This \nwas particularly necessary in India, where the Nagaraja required extra \nassistance to hide themselves. Such assistance included portraying vampire- \nhunting as superstitious or steering the hunters themselves at other targets, a \ntalent turned against the cult’s rivals. \nOld Clan Tzimisce - \nThis collection of Tzimisce elders believed the \nmain clan had fallen into delusion and rebellion. They blamed the elders of \nthe main clan for allowing the disastrous insubordination and rebellion that \nhad been part and parcel of the Anarch Revolt. Most found havens with the \nManus Nigrum and spent most of their time endlessly scheming to recover the \nclan homelands. \nVentrue and untitribu -The Ventrue brought a sense of hierarchy and \ntradition to the cult, preferring merit and nobility over mere wealth. Their \ngreatest assistance was to bring their own influence among mortals to the \ncult’s needs. \nC ~ H O U L S  \nThe Manus Nigrum took its ghouls from three families.

A number of newly Embraced vampires within the cult were \nselected from the ghouls’ ranks. \nENRATHI \nThe Enrathi family traces its line back to Etruscan farmers in the time \nof Rome’s early years. As the republic became an empire, the family \ndabbled in the slave trade and found it to be profitable (not to mention \nthey had an unpleasantly good knack for it). Within two generations, the \nEnrathi became slavers instead of farmers.

The family already knew enough \nabout vampiric society to spot a good thing. \nFor over 1000 years, the Enrathi family provided the Manus \nNigrum with some of the finest ghouls, chosen from the family’s own \nranks. Such tasks were not only out among the mortals, but also to \nassist the cult’s vampires and other supernatural members. The most \nfavored among them even grew up in Enoch, tutored by the cult in the \nlands of the dead. \nOne of the cult’s major tenets (and a major sore point for the Enrathi) \nis that no other vampires should interfere with mortals but those of the \nManus Nigrum. The cultists simply believe that no other vampire is more \ncapable of ruling the humans properly than they. A few members find this \nrestrictive, preferring to command the kine and destroy those who dis- \nobey. As such, the Enrathi work quietly and don’t bring up the fact that \ntheir contract with the Manus Nigrum is one of mutual social obligation, \nnot terms of submission. \nWith the opening of the Americas and trans-Atlantic slave trade, the \nEnrathi rose to undreamed-of heights. Through a variety of names and \ndisguises, the family grew to fabulous wealth. Politcal power remained \nbeyond their reach - \ntheir experiments in the 17th and 18th centuries \nwent badly awry when their ghoul natures attracted the attentions of \nwitch-hunters. Since then, the Enrathi have been content to be rich, \nfavored and private. \nMARIJAVA \nThe Marijava family line had associations with vampires as far \nback as early Hindu history. Devout Thuggees appeared in every \ngeneration, supported by their mortal kin with magical studies. \nMarijava ghouls were seeded into the Assamite and Ravnos clans \nwhen the Manus Nigrum came calling. The family rejected the cult’s \novertures, finding the Gehenna cult to be too alien and too obsessive \nto most Marijava. \nAround 500 BC, a branch of the family went into service of the \ncult and disappeared from family records thereafter. Between the cult’s \npenchant for secrecy and the family’s own magical defenses, the new \nManus Nigrum servants never knowingly encountered their mortal kin \nagain. The family turned its attentions to esoteric studies, particularly \nin Indian religion, along with the cult’s vampires, especially the \nNagaraja. The cult’s Marijava maintained vast libraries of theological \nand philosophical writings on Indian mysticism and religion, much of \nit blasphemous. \nThe Marijava’s primary task was to serve the cult as observers of Kindred \nactivity in mortal guises. They spread themselves out across the world into \nblood cults, domains that made heavy use of ghouls and various mortal \nagencies that would allow them to watch Kindred from a distance.

When the traitors were discovered, the cult \npurged these servants and their immediate families; the family as a whole was \napparently too useful to destroy. \nRAPASTIO \nThe Rafastio began serving the Manus Nigrum several centuries before \nthe beginnings of Christianity, practicing the magic of blood and nature for \ntheir vampiric masters. Some cult members claim that the Rafastio family \ngave them a link with the powerful magi called the Verbena, while others find \nthe claim stretched a little thin for credibility. \nThe family traces its ancestry to northern Italy in the Po River Valley. \nMost of them stayed close to the villages and ancestral holdings of their \nforeparents, even into the modern nights. A few family branches moved out \nto the New World in the 19th century, and one group has operated farms in \nKenya since the turn of the 20th century. \nUnlike the Enrathi, the Rafastio have served the Manus Nigrum, \nnever taking a more equal stance. They operated and lived solely at \nthe cult’s discretion. Only rarely would particularly talented mem- \nbers be Embraced; the Rafastio’s service was the sort of magic that the \nEmbrace kills. Though they showed great aptitude for blood magic \nupon their change, the Rafastio were considered far more valuable in \nlife than death. \nMagic was the Rafastio’s sole reason for inclusion in the cult. \nAnything the vampires couldn’t do for themselves, the witches likely \ndid, from potions and mystical wards to bindings and protections. \nThe cult paid them well, but supplemented their payments with \nabuse of all kinds. Some witches attempted to flee, but none escaped, \nand their gruesome fates were left as object lessons to the rest of their \nclan. Such was the price paid for shelter against the encroaching \nFinal Nights. \nNON- \nEAMILY GHOULS \nThe familes occupied special places in the hierarchy of the cult. \nOther ghouls signed on in response to certain needs.

They spent their time being instructed in esoteric lore by \nelder vampires and tutored in the ways of the Underworld by wraiths. \nAny other living humans these children saw were either other \nchatterlings or ghouls who had reasons to be in Enoch. The Aralu often \nwalked in the children’s dreams, but what they mumbled very few \ncould understand. \nFew adults are cut out for such a life, and children’s malleable \nminds were no more adaptible. About a third of any given group \nbrought to Enoch went insane before finishing their instruction, and \nup to one-half of the rest perished in Underworld accidents or while \ntrying to cross the Shroud. The rest learned to cope with the nightly \nstrangeness of their situation - \nthe constantly boiling storms of the \nTempest, visits from violently insane Spectres hunting for prey, even \nthe residents of Enoch. They were indoctrinated with the Manus \nNigrum’s teachings, and the Aralu’s whispers confirmed what they \nhad been taught. Fully inculcated, the chatterlings returned to the \nliving world. \nAfter living most of their lives in the colorless, sensory-deprived \nworld of Enoch, many chatterlings were overwhelmed with the mortal \nworld. Some had to turn to smaller doses of humanity while the \nstrongest among them managed to thrive and prosper. These served \nthe cult’s efforts to guide humanity by working from the inside.

Most of the cult was comprised of elders, and the \nnotion disturbed them greatly. Finally, they rationalized that the youths \nhadn’t actually done such a thing - \nit had been the Antediluvians who \nhad faked their destructions for reasons that made sense only to them. The \ncult decided to monitor the new anarch organization and try to direct its \nenergies more appropriately. Let them slaughter all the elders they \nwanted, so long as they thought it was preparation for Gehenna and the \ncult could do its work. \nThe cult also attempted to infiltrate the Camarilla, seeking to topple the \nsect. When the young sect proved too stable for them to knock over easily, the \nmembers concluded that the Inconnu (who, according to Manus Nigrum \ndoctrine, stood in active opposition to the Antediluvians) had blocked their \nefforts. They reconsidered their strategy and decided the Camarilla would \nmake a better tool. \nT H E  C U L T I N T H E  \nEAST \nMeanwhile, the Eastern branch of the cult had other concerns. Though \nit had once billed itself as being closer to the original purpose of the cult, most \nmembers spent their time in individual study or building their own personal- \nity cults. The study of death and the afterlife was gradually shuffled aside, and \nmost Enoch residents had no idea what transpired in wraithly affairs beyond \nthe black marble walls. \nThose Eastern cultists still in the living world engaged in shadow wars \nwith the Assamites and Setites, starting in the Middle Ages and lasting down \nthrough the centuries, or so they claimed.

The Nagaraja were the particular targets of much of the \nworst opposition, primarily for their flesh-eating ways. As such feeding \nis much harder to cover up than typical blood-drinking, vampiric \nhunters tracked the Nagaraja before such activity could stir the mortals \nin the area to take up monster-hunting. In response, the Nagaraja saw \nsuch panic as both a mark of incompetence on the native vampires’ part \nand jealousy of their own superior insights.

Only a handful survived, and the city’s defenses crumbled. \nIt took over a century for the Eastern cultists to persuade their brethren \nto help them retake Enoch and another three years for the crusade \nitself. The commander of the operation, called the Del’Roh, took over \nas leader of the entire cult. During the mid- 1700s, the cult’s division \ncame to a formal end. Still, groups in the cult would continue to pursue \ndifferent aims and goals. \nT H E  CHALLENC~FSOETHE \nSABBAT \nThe Sabbat, the more visible Black Hand, was never solely a tool \nof the Manus Nigrum. Members joined at their discretion, not the \nwhim of some unseen mover’s. Likewise, the sect would move or not \nas it chose, sometimes in spite of efforts by the Manus Nigrum to steer \nthem in another direction. As tensions elevated in the Sabbat, the \nManus Nigrum saw its pawns as troublesome, things to be dismissed \nrather than people to be understood. Indeed, the cult rarely saw the \nsect’s members as being personalities at all. It continued to be \nsurprised when tensions escalated into violence, and would more \noften than not attribute the chaos to the work of its unseen enemies. \nManipulation caused the problems: Manipulation could solve them. \nThe cult saw the terms that ended the two Sabbat Civil Wars as being \nbut scraps thrown to the hounds so it could continue its own work. \nSuch a disregard for the responses and motives of others would \ncontinue to unbalance the cult’s views and eventually be the first \nstones paving its downfall. \nThe cult claimed it had preserved the Sabbat during the first Sabbat \nCivil War (running from the end of the 1700s to the early 1800s), and \nthere was some truth to this. The Camarilla certainly could have poured \ninto warring domains and decimated the ranks if not destroyed them \noutright. Instead, the Camarilla focused on expanding into new do- \nmains, opening new territories and waiting for the peace of thinned \nranks before attacking any Sabbat domains, usually guided into such by \nthe words of certain elders or Manus Nigrum agents in various courts. \nPart of the war’s terms included the Purchase Pact, forbidding war \nbetween Sabbat members, which allowed the cult’s influence over one \nfaction to influence the Sabbat as a whole. \nThe second Sabbat Civil War changed this drastically. The early \n20th century saw incredible mortal conflict, and the Sabbat followed \nwith factional battles over the opportunities (and threats) arising from \nit. The Camarilla made gains during this time while the Sabbat was \ndistracted, particularly in Canada, although the Camarilla’s victories \nwere made pyrrhic by a few quick strikes. The Code of Milan in 1933, \nwhich ended this conflict, was a masterpiece of doublespeak: It pro- \nclaimed the true ideals of the Sabbat then made them worthless by \nputting the true power in the hands of the sect’s leaders.

The \nupshot was the recognition of the Caitiff as a new “clan,” which suited \nthe cult; after all, groups and factions were far easier to manipulate than \nindividuals, and this organized the most troublesome members of the \nSabbat in one easy package. \nThe rise of the Inquisitors among the Sabbat worried the Manus Nigrum, \nwho recalled how unsatisfactory a tool their mortal counterparts had once \nproven. Of course, none ever considered that such disaster had ever been \nremotely their doing. \nI N  T H E  EINAL NIGHTS \nWhether Gehenna is imminent or not, the Manus Nigrum was struck by \na number of disasters over several months - \nthe work of millennia literally \nfell in the blink of an eye. \nENOCH \nEALLS \nEnoch’s end was the first of these catastrophes.

Each time, the wraith ended her \nexistence as a prisoner of the cult, met an unpleasant end while trying to \nescape or returned to the cities of the dead with the news and no one \nwilling to believe her tale about vampires living in the Underworld. \nHowever, the Deathlords who governed the Empire of Stygia, the mighty \ndomain of European and North American wraiths, had learned of Enoch \nlong ago and longed to wipe it from the face of the Underworld com- \npletely. Reliable guidance for getting through the storm, though, had been \nanother matter, and their forces could only sit in harbor while the lords \nbrooded. Then, recently, a band of wraiths presented the Imperial forces \nwith precise information about Enoch’s whereabouts in the Tempest. The \nImperial Navy, comprised of ships from across the centuries, set out to \nbombard Enoch. \nEnoch’s defenses included magical wards and 100-foot-high black \nmarble walls that had often stymied and amazed those few travelers who \nhad ever seen the city. Stygia’s navy came prepared, however, bringing the \nvery best firepower available, and was able to hide its approach until it was \ntoo late for Enoch’s residents to flee. The dozens of vampires, ghouls and \nwraithly servants within commanded enough power to sink most of the \nfirst ships approaching. Superior numbers and familiarity with the Tem- \npest prevailed in the end for the wraiths.

The Green \nCourts listened to their suit with fewer preconceptions, and offered \nshelter in exchange for information (whether or not they knew as much \nabout the Nagaraja as the Kuei-jin of India). The price was steep - \nthe \nNagaraja traded nearly everything they knew about Necromancy and \nnecromantic organizations. The Nagaraja are now recognized as honored \nguests of the Green Courts. \nThe Green Courts were most interested in the news of the war against \nEnoch and the origins of the monster storms currently raging in the \ndeadlands. Few Kuei-jin oriented toward the dead can tolerate the \nGiovanni, and the news could bring a united campaign of the courts \nagainst the Necromancers. As for the Nagaraja, they remain on the brink \nof extinction, unable to Embrace (their requests to their hosts for such are \nall put aside politely for “further discussion”) and trying to maintain a \nfooting in their precarious shelter. \nO L D  CLAN TZIMISCE \nThe Old Clan Tzimisce includes both the usual disgruntled elders and a \nhandful of lunatics, as well as their loyal childer. It is the lunatics who have \nchanged the timbre of the clan’s activities. \nThe Old Clan possesses Animalism, Auspex and Dominate for its \nDisciplines, rather than Vicissitude. The clan believes that these \npowers reflect the needs and concerns of ancient rulers in rugged \ndomains. They find Vicissitude to be a perversion, completely un- \nhealthy for a vampire to indulge in. A Tzimisce should be a leader \nsteeped in ancient lore and wisdom, not a freak show. The lunatics \ntook this dislike a bit further, claiming that the Discipline wasn’t a \ntrue Discipline but the manifestation of an evil spirit or even a \nvampiric disease. Those leaders who found such rants to be ridiculous \nwere branded as members of the Vicissitude conspiracy. Rants led to \npurges, and most of the saner members now try to keep the lunatics \nsomewhat contained. \nMost of the Old Clan now spends its days preparing for what it \nknows must be the End Times. Its members know they must prepare \nthemselves to be worthy on their own terms, not trying to shore up other, \nweaker vampires. Many now spend all their rime on their ancestral \nestates (those who didn’t have them previously have been acquiring \nthem by various means), preparing themselves for the Tzimisce Antedi- \nluvian (who may have already risen). \nIn post-Communist Eastern Europe, many Old Clan Tzimisce \nfind their old-style tyranny to be reassuringly stable to the peas- \nantry. They restrain overt displays of vampirism, preferring to walk \namong the people as returned heirs of noble estates or business \nleaders, concealing their vampiric powers. They have withdrawn \nfrom the worthless Kindred society at large to cultivate virtuous \ndomains at home. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The family never \ncommitted its entire resources to the cult, in the event of just such an \nemergency, and concentrated on building up its slave trade, despite the short- \nterm hardships. \nThe Enrathi are skilled survivors in the World of Darkness and know how \nto make themselves unseen to the world at large. They don’t advertise that \ntheir vastly extended family is all related; their outward guise is of ghouled and \nunghouled mortals of varying ethnicities who all happen to traffick in the \nflesh trade. Their gifts as mediums can be found in any ethnic group, so that \ndoesn’t cause suspicion. In short, only the most dedicated observers might \ntrace down connections. \nPrinces of major port cities and airport hubs are aware of the slave trade, \nbut so long as the law isn’t aroused and “gifts” keep showing up in their coffers, \nmost princes are willing to let it slide.

Enrathi ghouls bring with \nthem the family’s accumulated wisdom regarding the dead and the Masquer- \nade, always welcome resources. \nThe drawback to all this has been the storms in the Underworld. Enrathi \nmedium gifts have become a curse and burden as wraiths plead and demand \ntheir attention. Some Enrathi fall to psychosomatic illnesses or try to lose \ntheir gifts through lobotomy; some even commit suicide.

Half \nthe searchers disappear altogether due to threats from Lupines and other \nmonsters outside the cities. There is confusion over the fates of the old \nMarijava family that refused service with the Manus Nigrum - \ndid they \nall simply die out,or are they unfindable to those ghouls whose auras bear \nthe stamp of cult service? \nA number of Marijava simply continue their existence and service to new \nmasters, trading information about vampiric rivals for blood, cash and other \nresources.

Without their masters standing over them as they \nhave for millennia, what can give determination to their sense of self? Most \nvampires are unlikely to trust mortal magicians who talk of serving some \ncult of Kindred overlords, and those few who attempted to defect to other \nmagical communities found they had no friends among other mortal \nmagicians. In short, they find themselves truly isolated with few resources. \nDozens of Rafastio die in the months after the Week of Nightmares. Some \ncross the path of a vampire on the verge of frenzy, some attempt a ritual \nwithout adequate preparation, some meet gruesome (unprintable) fates, \nand many commit suicide, bereft of hope and purpose without the cult. The \nremaining family members regroup to plan and redirect their clan’s activi- \nties in the name of survival. \nSub-families within the clan bind themselves to individual cult \nmembers or offshoot groups. Old Clan Tzimisce take many of these \n“orphans” in, the two traditionalist groups being comfortable with the \narrangement. Others gather in spots around the world in groups of varying \nsizes, such as six serving a very old Malkavian or two living with a mixed \ncoterie. Most select such new masters with an eye toward the future, \nhoping that their masters’ purity might deflect whatever carnage follows \nwhen the Antediluvians awaken. \nAbout 50 to 100 of the Rafastio hunt for the remaining Ravnos. After all, \nif these vampires came so close to contact with their Antediluvian and \nsurvived, they must bear a special holiness which could protect those around \nthem. Finding a Ravnos is a task in and of itself, and once found, few Ravnos \nunderstand what the Rafastio want, and even fewer accept the offer. A \nRavnos who allows the Rafastio to remain soon finds herself with a following \nof devoted disciples very interested in her continued existence. \nThe rest of the family go into business for themselves in various enter- \nprises. Some turn to the vampire-hunting organizations of the Inquisition; \nafter all, if the Manus Nigrum could not survive, then no other vampire is \nworthy.

When conspirators continually work in disciplined secrecy \nand use even minor events to advance the grand agenda, they forget that \nmost people are not part of any great scheme. They look for rival plots, \nsearch for non-existent evidence and see such as confirmation of cagey \nenemies. Everyone is either raw material or in on the conspiracy. \nMotivations that have nothing whatsoever to do with the conspiracy \nmean nothing to those who can’t understand why events don’t follow \nthe grand scheme. The Manus Nigrum failed in part because of its \nmembers forgot that history happens because of many personal drives \ncoming together in unpredictable ways, and individuals ultimately act \nfor their own reasons, for better or worse. O n  several occasions, the cult \neven dismissed the idea that those outside the cult had personalities, \ngoals and motives - \nin short, that they were people. Those who were \nnot of the cult were merely tools, servants or just part of a mass that was \nbeing used as a tool. Such beliefs rarely take independent thought into \naccount, and by this the cult collapsed. \nThe Manus Nigrum was certain that the chaos that affected both the \nCamarilla and Sabbat was its own doing. Debacles like the Anarch Revolt \nor the Inquisition weren’t their fault, and any successes were entirely their \ndoing. They didn’t believe that any non-cult vampires could create long- \nterm plans or that neonates and ancillae might actually work together out \nof shared concerns rather than under the coordination of some great \nscheme. In the end, such unrealistic appraisal of themselves and their \n“enemies” brought them down. \nSo how much history is the Manus Nigrum responsible for? That \ndepends on your perspective. As Storyteller, you can make the cult as \nirrelevant or as critical as you see fit. The cult’s insight into its own doings \nmakes it unlikely to be completely true, but likewise, the cult’s critics may \nhave made their own mistakes in assizing the cult. Loyal members examin- \ning the cult’s claims may either find their beliefs confirmed or core-shaking \ndisappointments. If you choose to use Manus Nigrum material in your \nchronicle, remember that the cult overestimated its impact on the Kindred \nworld. It attempted to play at Illuminati with only minimal success due to \nthe continual maintenance of secrecy. \nT H E  SECTSAND \nLIBERTY \nThe Manus Nigrum boasted members from both sects, and the cult’s \nfracture resounds on both sides of Kindred society in different ways. \nFor the Camarilla, the Manus Nigrum’s claims of influence and \ncontrol were frankly overinflated. Some prominently placed individuals \ntook orders from the cult or responded to prompting through various \nchannels, but on the whole, the sect owed nothing to the cult and the cult \ncouldn’t extend its reach without the risk of exposing its agents (who \nwould have been promptly ashed for serving outside influences).

Each game \nhas its own demands. \nAll of these techniques are tools to building a better game. They’re \ntools; they aren’t full-blown chronicles in and of themselves. Each of \nthem can add excitement to a story, but they need to be used sparingly \nor they’ll get too familiar (and thus lose that excitement, which was why \nyou brought them in). If you have a flashback scene every session, \neventually players will get bored with them. Roll these techniques out \nwhen you want to add an exclamation point to an event in your game or \nwhen you want to explore a character’s emotions in depth.

Don’t give up hope though; \neventually they’ll be ready for this kind of stuff. Until then, don’t spoil \ntheir fun by forcing this down their throats. You can’t force a person to \nroleplay well; you can just give them the opportunity.

      "text": "Still ready to give a whirl? Great. Let’s see what these tricks will do for \nyour chronicle. \nE LAS H B A C  KS \nA vampire story is as much about the past as it is the present. \nVampires are creatures that have had centuries to grow, learn, and \nchange. The person a Kindred was years ago makes him who he is today. \nMost vampire fiction spends a great deal of time on those past experi- \nences. Often the audience watches the past and the present side by side, \nso that they can see just why the vampire acts the way he does. Your \nchronicle might have just as much history as any vampire novel, but that \nhistory rarely gets much examination in play. Players will generate \ncharacters that were born centuries ago, but somehow, that history \nrarely has any relevance to what happens tonight. \nFlashbacks are one method of bringing that history to life. In a \nflashback scene, you take a moment from a character’s history and put it on \nits feet. This can really flesh out a character’s roleplaying experience. It’s \none thing to know why a Kindred still seeks vengeance for his lover’s death \ncenturies ago; it’s another to hold her mangled body in your arms and know \nshe’s gone forever. A player’s character can become far deeper for this \nexperience. If you choose the right history, and the right time, this can take \nyour whole chronicle to a new level. \nThe trick is picking the right character and the right time. When you \nselect a player to do a small scene like this, you’re devoting an awful lot \nof time and attention to her. Is that the best thing for your game, or should \nyou spread your time more evenly across your entire player base? Ulti- \nmately, only you can answer that question. As a rule of thumb, you’ll \nprobably want do small scenes like this outside of your main gaming \nsession. Your first instincts will draw you to the characters that gave you \ndetailed backgrounds that catch your attention, or the characters that are \ndriving the plot right now. However, eventually someone is going to \ngrumble “favoritism” if you spend too much time with any one group of \nplayers. While it can be easy to focus continually on the good roleplayers \nwho always give you great backstories, look at those players who perhaps \nneed a small kick in their metaphyical pants to move from merely \nmeandering through the game to being an active part of it. \nA quick dip into a character’ past is a big boost to any player’s \nroleplaying skills. Most Storytellers like to talk new players through the \nevents of their characters’ lives well before the Embrace just to establish \nthe character in the player’s mind before real play begins. With a group of \nwilling volunteers, the Storyteller might be able to take these initial \nroleplay notes into a bona fide scene, providing a miniature “boot camp” \nto get fresh players accustomed to their new characters and to live-action \nroleplaying in general. This sort of technique is only practical for smaller \ngames, however, and it requires a lot of supervision on your part. You may \nwant to talk a trustworthy assistant into making this a full-time project if \npossible. I t  may take time, but eventually, everyone can get a chance to \nsample their character’s pasts as they see fit. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Keep an eye out for high stakes moments in a character’s background, \nthose times when everything acharacter had was on the line. The character’s \nEmbrace is a solid choice, but almost anything goes. Also, you want to pick \nsomething that has relevance to your current plot line. If the scene you’re \ncreating never has any impact on your main chronicle, it may as well have \nnever happened at all. If the modern-day lover of a Kindred is threatened, \nit might be worthwhile to detail with a player how his character lost a lover \ncenturies ago. In the end, though, the game that you’re creating will \ndetermine what sort of history you need to show. \nPreviously written history needs to happen in a certain way, not \nnecessarily rigid because that’s no fun to play, but with the understanding \nthat you have a goal to get to. Make sure you know exactly what’s supposed \nto happen in a flashback scene. How does it begin? What actions have to \noccur? When does it end? You will probably what to keep the flashback \nscene a “soft” roleplay event with no challenges. If you let the players play \nrock-paper-scissors to determine your chronicle’s past, you could end up in \nserious trouble. After all, if that tragic death of a lover in the 17th century \nnever happened because your player gets lucky.. . well, it’s back to drawing \nboard for that character history. You can patch over the situation - \nmaybe \nshe just died later - \nbut overall, you just want to prevent those situations \nin the first place. Let the players determine how they react to events, but \nkeep the action under your control. Encourage gut instinct and emotional \nresponse rather than too much decision-making. \nThe resources you throw into a small scene like this can enhance the \nexperience tremendously. A few helpful assistants to play Narrator char- \nacters are always a great benefit. Likewise, a few small costumes or props \ncan give a lot of life to a scene. At a minimum, give yourself enough time \nto play the scene fully and enough space to put the scene on its feet. Avoid \nmerely sitting down and talking things out if you can help it. Mind’s Eye \nTheatre is a game that’s meant to be played on its feet. Show your players \nthe past; don’t just tell them. \nThe most important thing about any flashback is tying it into current \nevents. History without a context is meaningless to the game. A flashback \nis a great way of illustrating how history repeats itself. Do your best to make \nthat history repeat and watch the recognition in your player’s eyes. If you \nwent the extra mile and got an assistant for a Narrator character, make \nsure you use the same assistant when you’re bringing the past into the \nmodern nights. Maybe that lounge singer is a distant ancestor of your \nKindred’s old lover.. . . In the same way, a prop from the past can take on \na lot of value if it shows up unexpectedly in these final nights. A little \ntouch like this is all you need to tie the past and present together at times \nand bring depth to the game as whole. \nELASH- EORWARDS \nJust as modern vampire stories revolve around the past, the World of \nDarkness is obsessed with the future - \nwhat little of it remains, anyway. \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Just as \na flashback shows players events of what came before, a flash-forward gives \nthem an opportunity learn what the Final Nights are all about. Sometimes \nthey can be signs of smaller events that are coming up, like a Sabbat \ninvasion or the death of a prince.

Imagine what \nhappens when you show your players what will happen to them before the \ngame even begins. If you tell your players, “This is the story of how the \nCamarilla fell in this city. This is how Gehenna came,” then they will pay \nattention. Every action that they take becomes important. Every choice \nbecomes a dangerous one. The stakes are just a little bit higher than if they \nwere playing for their own characters’ amusement - \nand the higher the \nstakes, the more your players will want to play. \nWhen you’re producing a scene that predicts events in the future, you \nneed to be extremely careful. Players can and will do their best to get out of \nawful predicaments, and their methods will surprise you. You want to get \nyour point across while giving away a minimum amount of information. If \nyou don’t, someone will inevitably find a way to make your foreshadowing \ninvalid. Don’t be afraid to include a disclaimer before any flash-forward \nscene: “This scene shows events that may happen.” As a wise sage noted, the \nfuture is always in motion, and what was true when you opened events may \nnot be after three sessions. \nGenerally speaking, you want to show the distant future, not the events \nhappening next week. The further ahead in time your scene is set, the less \nlikely it is that your players can change it. You’ll also want to keep things as \nvague as possible. If too many details are set in stone, you’ll have to scramble \nkeep things happening according to schedule, which may devolve into a run- \non-rails game. \nYou’ll probably want to keep a tight rein on the action a flash-forward \nscene, just like a flashback.

You want to keep things \nlax enough that the players feel that they have some control over the \nsituation, even if that’s not the case. These scenes are about flavor, not \ncombat. As with any of these techniques, roleplaying is the biggest concern. \nEncourage your players to pay attention to how they react to what happens, \nnot what they do themselves. \nOf course, if you really are serious about throwing Gehenna at your \nplayers, you may just want to hose them with ridiculous odds.

You don’t have to worry about whether all your \ncharacters will survive. Feel free to draw up Methusalahs, battalions of \nSabbat or whatever else your fiendish mind can produce. You don’t need \nto be “fair” when the end result isn’t going to have an impact on the \nchronicle. Just remember that you’re not in this for sadism. You’re here \nto make a point for the players. Admittedly, the point might be that \ntheir characters aren’t really as tough as they think they are, but you \nshould be aiming higher than that. \nA little mystery in a flash-forward can create a great deal of suspense \nin your main chronicle. If you keep some of the details obscure in your \nscene, you can keep the players guessing anxiously about the chronicle’s \nplot for some time. Maybe there’s a mysterious hooded figure command- \ning the Sabbat legions in your home city. The conversations in the \nflash-forward make it clear that this figure was once a loyal Camarilla \nmember. So who’s the traitor? Players will become a great deal more \nparanoid after something like this is shown to them. The characters may \nnot have any reason to be more suspicious, but you can bet that the \nplayers will start jumping at shadows. You may very well not know who \nthat hooded figure is yourself at this point - \njust creating that sense of \nurgency and dread is often enough to drive events forward. Eventually, \nthe chronicle will present its own answer, and you can reveal that \nhooded figure in a later scene. In a sense, the actual events in a flash- \nforward aren’t all that important. It’s how the chronicle gets to the \nfuture that matters. The details of the flash-forward can remain obscure, \nas long as the end results are interesting. \nMake absolutely certain that your players understand that the flash- \nforward is not in-game information. Anyone who acts on the information \nyou give in a scene like this is cheating. If a player can’t respect this, he \nshouldn’t be a part of the scene. At the same time, you need to make sure \nyou don’t give players information that they’ll have a hard time sup- \npressing. If you reveal one of the main characters in the game is a traitor, \nplayers will react differently to the character, no matter how hard they \nmight try otherwise. Again, keeping your flash-forward vague and \ndistant in time helps. \nDREAM \nSEQUENCES \nIn a chronicle, a dream sequence is a great way to lend an air of mystery \nand surrealism to a game. You can use dreams to liberally drop hints about a \nplot to a specific character, to make agraphic statement about a theme in your \nchronicle or even to make the loss of Humanity in a character an event \ninstead of a statistic. Dreams are extremely liberating in their freedom as \nStorytelling devices. Dreams and visions are disjoined, illogical scenes where \nemotions are more important that the laws of nature. This sort of fractured \nvision can provide a great mechanism for giving your players clues, or insights \nas to their own inner natures.. . or even just frightening them as you hit the \ncharacters in their sleep. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "As with all these Storytelling techniques, you want to pick and \nchoose whom you’re going to give a dream sequence to. Unless the \nsituation is extremely odd, only one character will have an active role \nin the dream. Perhaps she frequently has nightmares or the dream is one \nthose strange flashes of insight that crop up with Auspex or Dementation. \nThere’s nothing keeping you from hitting any player at any time with an \ninteresting dream, though. After all, everyone dreams. The final deci- \nsion, as always, is up to you. If you feel something interesting will come \nfrom taking a character through the Twilight Zone, don’t hesitate to go \ndown that road. \nIt’s critical to have a complete background for a character before you \ncreate any dream sequence. Dreams tend to pull images from our past \nexperiences and everyday lives. You need to know what the events in a \ncharacter’s past mean before you can truly begin. If you put a father figure into \na dream, you need to make sure that the character in question didn’t kill his \nfather in a rage. Likewise, little details like a favorite toy or an old phobia can \nhelp to give a dream context and texture. Dreams are intensely personal; you \nhave use symbols that mean something for the character in order to make a \ntruly personal experience. \nA dream sequence probably has the most opportunity for Storyteller \ncontrol out of any Storytelling technique. You can turn the dreaming \ncharacter into a little girl, an old woman or anything in between. Strange \nthings happen in dreams, and often, the dreamer can feel powerless in the \ndream’s wake. It’s highly recommended that you avoid using any sort of \nchallenges in a dream sequence outright. Most dreams only give someone \na few options on how to cope with a situation. When you encounter a fork \nin the road in a dream, you rarely have the option of turning around and \ngoing back home. As long as your player is comfortable with the idea of \nlosing this much control of their character, things should go smoothly. As \nalways, the player you choose to work with in a special scene like this \nmakes all the difference. \nBear in mind that when it comes to surrealism and dream imagery, \na little goes a long way. You might want to compose a dream sequence \nwhere the player flies into orbit and takes tea with dragons, but such wild \nthings are generally hard to roleplay. Small, subtle changes are more \nlikely to unnerve your players rather than big special effects. Something \nas small as meeting a familiar friend who treats her like a stranger can \nrattle a character a lot more than meeting a large horned demon in a dark \nalley. The familiar gone very wrong always has more potential for terror \nthan the alien. \nIt’s a good idea if you touch on a several different themes in the course \nof a dream. Use dream imagery to hit upon problems that a character is \nhaving in his modern life; show him a prophetic event; toss in a few \nmeaningless images. To a certain degree, you want to be as obscure as \npossible in a dream sequence. Your own vision as Storyteller should tell \nyou where to go with any dream, but as a rule of thumb, never be \ncompletely straightforward.

Rapid jumps \nin time and space can help to give players the surreal experience you’re \nlooking for. Your only goal in a dream sequence is to give a player \ninformation or to set a mood; stop the session once those goals are \nachieved, even if it cuts a scene in half. Dreams are all about images, not \nconclusions, and a good dream sequence should always leave a player with \nunanswered questions. \nAfter a dream sequence, your player may well approach you looking for \nsome insight as to what they went through. While the use of some Abilities \nlike Enigmas or Occult might help out, there is no hard and fast rule as to how \nto use game mechanics to interpret a dream. You definitely want to avoid \nsimply handing the players a dream’s meaning. As a rule of thumb, limit \nquestions to specific objects in the dream and avoid answering questions \nabout the dream as a whole. Enigmas might tell you what the one-armed man \nrepresented in a dream, but it won’t tell you the dream’s story from beginning \nto end. Make the players work to reason things out; don’t hand them the \nanswers on a platter. \nB L U E  B O O K S  A N D  DOWNTIMES \nOften there just isn’t enough time to get everything done in a game. \nPlayers may want to conduct detailed investigations, pursue a stakeout or \neven just socialize over a long period of time. Events like this can’t be \ncovered in just one evening, no matter how much work you do. As a \nStoryteller, it’s sometimes in your benefit to gloss over these things and \ncompress time so that the players can get back to the central plot of the \nevening. However, you can take another approach. If all the players \ninvolved are mature enough to roleplay on their own, you may want to \nallow them to create the details on their own time and let you become \naware of the results. A process like this is called blue booking, and in the \nhands of strong roleplayers, it can help you flesh out the daily life of your \ngame considerably. \nA bluebook is not the same thing as a downtime. Downtimes are \nanother common tool used by Storytellers, usually when several weeks \npass between game sessions. Generally, Storytellers will ask that \nplayers let them know how their characters spend those intervening \nweeks. A good downtime report can provide a lot of detail on a \ncharacter’s actions and may provide a wealth on a character’s motives. \nHowever, most downtimes are a solo effort, and as such don’t quite \nqualify as roleplaying. A character’s downtime doesn’t involve any- \nthing but the player’s own imagination; other players rarely have any \ninput into events, nor can the Storyteller change things as they occur. \nWithout reactions from other people, there’s very little roleplaying \nthat can go on. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "A bluebook, on the other hand, involves both Storyteller and player \ninteraction. In a sense, it’s more like agroup writing effort than a true Mind’s \nEye Theatre session. If two or more players let you know that they’d like to \nbuild a scene together, you may want to have them write down the details \nof what happened and convey the events to you. The exact process is up to \nyou and your players, but generally, it’s best to work in a round-robin format. \nYou build the initial setting for the players; then one player puts down his \nactions and reactions. The next player edits events as he sees fit, adds some \nmore details and returns them to the original player. When all parties are \nsatisfied, they can return the project to you, and you can then incorporate \nevents into the game. \nThere are certain criteria for a bluebook scene that have to be met \nbefore you can use this method. Obviously, a bluebook has to be a no- \nchallenge event; if things come to blows, it’s time to move things off of the \npaper on onto their feet, with you present in the flesh. Generally, a \nbluebook is useful for filling in the quiet times between games. It’s far more \nuseful to describe coffee between friends than a showdown between \nenemies. If there’s ever a doubt as to whether a set of roleplayers can build \na bluebook together effectively, get things back onto their feet and \nsupervise things in person. \nE-mail is a fantastic way of building a good bluebook with your players. \nIdeas can flow back and forth very quickly. A scene can take shape \npractically in real time if you let it. However, it’s better to resist this \ntemptation and put detail into your blue book techniques whenever pos- \nsible. Bear in mind that you’re using a bluebook because your players wanted \nto take the time to do a scene right. Just because you can compose something \nin a matter of moments doesn’t mean that you should. While it’s very useful \nfor you as a Storyteller to monitor the crafting of a bluebook as it happens, \nyou’ll want to remind the players that it’s the final draft that matters most, \nnot the e-mails that fly in between players as they go. \nHow you use a finished bluebook is up to you. Often, players create \nbluebook scenes simply to fulfill the personal needs of their characters. \nIn a case like this, you may need to do nothing more than moderate the \nscene to make sure that nothing happens that might disrupt the game as \na whole. Hold on to that finished work, however. Generally, players will \ngive you a lot of information on how their characters think through \nbluebooks scenes such as this. That information can only benefit you \nlater in the chronicle. \nA bluebook scene will generally require almost no moderation on your \npart. There’s no reason for you to step in when a scene changes direction; if \nthe players find themselves leaving the coffee house to go hunting in a back \nalley, let them. A bluebook is as much for the players’ benefit as yours; as long \nas none of their actions harm the chronicle, you might as well let them roam \nas freely as possible. \nMost importantly, bear in mind that Mind’s Eye Theatre is a game that’s \nmeant to played on its feet. Bluebooks in particular, and e-mail in general, can \ntake up a lot of the slack in between game sessions. But they’re no substitute \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

While a bluebook can be a solid tool for creating a \ncharacter, it is a tool, and not an end in and of itself. \nIn the end, there are many more techniques than this available to you. \nPeople have been telling stories for as long as they have been able to speak, \nand the styles they’ve used to do so are varied in the extreme. Any of those \ntechniques can be applied to your chronicle, as long as you’re willing to \napply time and effort to the problem.

What better way \nto explore history than through the eyes of the Kindred? \nR U N N I N C ~  \nWITH HISTORY \nHistorical chronicles have particular needs that are often vastly different \nfrom modern chronicles. They require attention to detail, intensive research \nand considerations of what you want to accomplish with your chronicle. \nHistorical chronicles can easily fall down when slapdash research \ncatches up with you. If you’re going to run a chronicle set in Victorian \nEngland, then you’d best know something about Victorian England. \nWhat’s given here should help you choose what time period you’d like to \nplay with and some ideas for Kindred involvement, but to make the setting \ncome more fully alive, you’ll need more background. Historical resources \ncan be found in a number of easily digestible formats, from movies to \ndocumentaries to references for writers (found in the reference section of \nthe bookstore) or even other games (such as Call ofcthulhu). Don’t focus \non solely on an endless series of political events - \nlook at what literature \nwas being read, what was causing scandal, what unexplainable events were \nstirring up people, what exciting new inventions were improving life. No \nmatter how small a Kindred’s world, things like the banning of Lady \nChatterley ’s Lover or the invention of the cotton gin can create ripples that \neventually run up against him. \nIt’s been said the devil’s in the details, and in a historical game, details \ncan mean the difference between an adequate chronicle and something \nspectacular. Anything from the hat a character wears to how she addresses \nsomeone can help it come to life. Details are also frequently what can trip \nyou, especially if you have a history buff whose pet project just happens to \nbe the era your chronicle is set in.

If your history buff proves to be more of \na nut and nitpick, you can always point out that it’s the World of Darkness \nand your chronicle, and this is the setting you’re working with. \nWhile we’ve given you a lot of broad swathes in mortal and Cainite \nhistory to work with, this is by no means all that is going on. A single book \ncould be written on running a chronicle in Victorian England or Renais- \nsance Italy alone. Don’t get bogged down by everything that’s happening \nin a single time period - \nchances are, you don’t need to be; you only need \nto know how the era’s events will affect your own chronicle’s setting. In \nsome periods (especially the pre-industrial world), a vampire’s world is \nlikely to be the city he lives in or around, and maybe the city he fled from, \nwhich makes your setting conveniently smaller. How easily a vampire can \ncommunicate with a neighboring city or even another country is up to you \n- \nthere’s a great deal of difference between trying to send a messenger \nthrough the Lupine-haunted Schwarzwald and sending a telegram. As \ncommunication becomes easier and the news becomes more accessible \n(through the telegraph, telephone, radio, television), the world grows \ncorrespondingly, at which time you’ll need to decide how much of that \ngreat big world to include. Travel does not become feasibly safe for many \nCainites until the advent of the steam train, which means most folks will \nstick close to their home cities. The wild places in between mean Lupines \nand other terrors, another good reason to stay home. Close to home does \nnot always mean safer, though: Which is worse, a city that hosts a center \nof the Inquisition, or a city where a vampire story has swept up dozens of \nexcited youth (both living and dead)? \nLastly, what do you want to accomplish with your chronicle? Fore- \nmost, of course, is telling a good story and having fun at it, but sometimes \na different setting can bring out aspects of the story in new ways. For \nexample, you decide you’d like one of the major themes to be paranoia - \nwho can be trusted, who is an enemy, who has fallen? While a contempo- \nrary chronicle can certainly fill the bill, consider times when paranoia was \neven more poisonous - the Anarch Revolt, the Reformation, the \nMcCarthy hearings. What do you see now? What about a chronicle that \nemphasizes humanity? The era of Carthage and the formation of the \nCamarilla both find vampires with great Humanitas either struggling to \nmaintain what they have or using it as a means of survival. In other time \nperiods, rehashed themes can take on new meaning, and have far more \nserious consequences to really shake up players. \nTHE \nSECOND \nCITY \nThe Second City arises after the Great Flood recedes. The Flood has \nwiped out Enoch, destroyed most of humanity and left only some of the \nThird Generation to start again after the world’s near-destruction.

For over a thousand years, the \nBrujah and other Cainite inhabitants of the city explore new depths of the \nBlood in Disciplines, magic or the power of the Beast. Carthage, however, \nis nothing like the dream that will be spoken of in later centuries - \nCainites openly rule the mortal population and demand blood sacrifice \nfrom the people while darker rumors of infernal ties divide the city’s \ninhabitants. Some Cainites are appalled by what their self-styled “divine” \nbrethren have done, and attempt to turn the city to a more Utopian ideal, \na place where mortals and Cainites live openly and harmoniously to- \ngether. Others drive it even further into iniquity. Cainites outside Carthage \noften see the city for what it truly is - \na nightmare waiting to breed \nfurther nightmares. Such conditions make the place ripe for a revolt by the \nmortals against the vampires, and possibly open the door to similar revolts \neverywhere else. Several vampires work against Carthage, starting ru- \nmors, infiltrating the city and even undermining it from the inside. \nRoman vampires aid this by encouraging the Punic Wars. When Carthage \nfinally falls, gnawed from the inside by Cainite infiltrators and crushed \nfrom the outside by Scipio, it is no wonder that no stone is left standing \nand the earth is salted. Over the years, Carthage fuels many speculations, \nsends out Cainite recruiters and hosts vampires of nearly every clan. Who \nwould listen to such tales? Would characters enjoy the depravity of \nCarthage, seek its profit or work against it? \nNot everyone is so pleased with the “Eternal City” or her grasp. The \nFertile Crescent is a scene of uneasy peace or violent bloodshed as Jews \nstruggle against the Roman occupation of their homeland. Rome ap- \npoints native govenors in an attempt to quell some of the demands, then \nremoves those govenors when the expected tax revenues don’t flow, or \nan Emperor perceives some action as being suggestive of weakness. It is \nentirely possible that Cainites could be on either side of the conflict - \nthose who maintain lands where Enoch once stood (or so they believe), \nand those who serve the Roman eagle (and Ventrue overlords). The \nHoly Lands are also considered the historical lairs of the Baali. Most \nCainites believe them destroyed with the great wars, but Salubri war- \nriors and other demon-hunters still find evidence of their tracks. Across \nthe continent in what will become Germany, Cainites entering with \nRoman forces may likely tangle with angry Lupines, who rage against \nMan’s grasping ways.

In fact, the perceived lack is false - \nthe Catholic Church sets \ndown its roots, patronizing arts that benefit its young power, and legendries \nsuch as King Arthur spring out of this era. \nCainite sects begin to emerge during this confused time. A number \nof Roman Cainites, tired of the nightly games and ceaseless Jyhad, seek \nto remove themselves entirely from their brethren’s blighted sport; \nthey become known as the Inconnu. The Manus Nigrum begins its \nsecret crusade to pave the way for the return of the Antediluvians \n(although its roots are in fact much older). Most vampires during this \ntime are more centered on those around them rather than far-flung \ngroups; after all, the Blood is more important than some half-formed \nideal. This era also sees the institution of a Cainite idea called the Law \nof 1001 Nights (one vampire per 1001 mortals) in an effort to check \noverpopulation, which often leads to bloody clashes. In many places, \nCainites follow the example of mortals in establishing minor fiefs for \nthemselves, barely bothering to conceal their supernatural natures \n(especially where paganism still reigns). It is a choice they will come \nto regret in later centuries. \nThe Catholic Church’s continuing rise of power results in a change to \nRome’s atmosphere. Some Cainites in the Holy City experience strange \nvisions and dreams, others suffer discomfort from the new aura of Faith, \nand a few even meet with mysterious destruction. Not all suffer in the same \nway-not \na few vampires choose to convert to Christianity and others see \nthe nascent Church as a new resource of power.

While elements inside and \noutside the Church often use it as a tool to seize money or land, or for one \nenemy to denounce another, too often the Inquisition serves its purpose \nadmirably. For many elders, the Inquisition is a wake-up call that their \nopenly supernatural ways point the Inquisitors to their doors. To buy time \nfor themselves, the elders hurl their childer at the flames; scores of \nvampires of all generations and ages fall in the fires.

The fleas bear the bubonic plague, which sweeps \nacross Europe in two years.

How would a blood-borne \ndisease react to Cainite blood? How will Cainites feed as their neighbors \naround them drop from the plague? Could a Cainite be insane enough to \ncarry and spread the disease deliberately? \nThe Black Death has far-reaching consequences.

Those anarchs who wish to \nreturn to the fold may do so, but many refuse the offer of their treacherous \nelders, turning their backs on the Camarilla; these die-hard rebels will \nform the core of the early Sabbat.

The witch-hunts last from the early 1500s until the early 1700s, \nand while the fires burn the fiercest in the German states, the rest of Europe \nis not unfamiliar with the grip of the witch-craze. In some towns, the \nhysteria reaches such a pitch that their populations are devastated. Torture \nis considered perfectly appropriate to elicit confessions from those who are \nreluctant to confess or who recant on the stand. Documents of the time \nreveal that not a few “witches” or “heretics” were also wealthy or prominent \ncitizens or that interrogators would force confessions regarding particular \nnames. Were the witch-hunters making examples of their high-born prison- \ners, or was someone cashing in on the wealth that often reverted to town \ntreasuries? Only the wiliest of vampires could remain unscathed in this time, \nperhaps guiding the hunters to the doorstep of his rivals and enemies, but \nthere is always the chance that the hunters may suddenly question how their \nsource knows so much. \nMartin Luther’s Reformation brings many changes for German Chris- \ntians: In their split with the Catholic Church, they were no longer subject to \nits laws. Many read the Bible for the first time after it is published in German. \nThe split does not bode well for everyone, though; many Protestants are as \nintolerant or more so than the Catholics.

Those Kindred living in \nCalvinist communities find they must be extremely careful as their neighbors \nare ever watchful for “sinful” activity, which is quite broadly defined. Worse, \nmany Calvinists are witch-hunters even more fanatical than the Romans. \nThe Restoration of the English monarchy marks the time of the cavaliers \nas the English king Charles I1 restores English society to a more relaxed state \nafter Oliver Cromwell’s bloody reign.

Indeed, neonates who enter into \nKindred society with such views may be quickly disavowed of them after \nseeing princes at work. \nRevolution rocks both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1700s as the \nFrench and American populaces revolt against their monarchies and form \nnew governments. For Kindred, revolution means violence, an overthrowing \nof all things old and a risk of the Final Death (all of which elders are \nnotoriously intolerant of), but it also means opportunities for those who avoid \nthe swing of the axe. Quite often, conflict means new blood (bothofEmbraces \nand in positions of power). \nThe American Revolution sees the Colonies refuse to bow to an \nincreasingly overbearing English monarchy and turn against England to win \ntheir freedom. American Kindred (ancillae who came with the original \ncolonists, neonates born in the Colonies or Sabbat riding the violence) \noccasionally lend aid, seeing this as their chance to separate their fates from \nthe European elders. \nThe French Revolution is far more bloodthirsty than the American. \nDuring the Reign of Terror, mob rule takes over, and the monarchy and \nits supports die in wholesale slaughter.

For \nvampires, such changes are not unwelcome: The industrial revolution means \nmany neonates and ancillae who invested in the new (which elders often \navoid) profit from their risks. \nIndustrialisim rapidly turns into a curse for the lower classes, worked as \nslave-labor in the factories.

Not a few \nare reduced to nothing when the dust settles. \nIn 1919, the United States outlaws alcohol, a culmination of years \nof temperance protests to the evils of drink. Instead of preventing \nalcohol consumption, Prohibition only encourages people to find ways \naround it. Organized crime grows exponentially from early gangs of \nrumrunners. Some Kindred on the fringes take the advantage to enter \ninto the business, become involved with the gangs or even use the \nspeakeasies as feeding-grounds. Those with ties to the police may either \naid and abet allies in the mob or use the police raids to move against \ncompetition. The growth of organized crime occasionally conflicts with \nvampiric power-bases, leading to shadowy wars against enemies that \nmany mobsters can barely believe in. The cauldron of Chicago’s orga- \nnized criminals versus the Cainites versus Elliot Ness and his \nUntouchables might make for a chronicle of both tommy-guns and \nshadowy predation. \nIn Oct. 1929, the Stock Market crashes, ruining lives and fortunes across \nthe US. Germany’s economy has collapsed two years prior in response to the \nGreat War. Several banks fail, trade drops and investments sink. The world \nis truly in the grip of misery. Many Kindred prefer not to speculate in risky \nventures, but some seeking opportunity get a rude awakening. What happens \nwhen a Kindred loses everything or when his best mortal allies hurl them- \nselves from the roofs after their fortunes collapse? \nThe new film industry spurs great interest among many young Toreador, \nwhile their elders decry it as “vulgar.” With the arrival of the first films, \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Even as he encourages pride in the \nTeutonic past, Hitler lays the blame for Germany’s misery squarely at the \nfeet of “undesirables,” especially Jews. Little by little, Jewish freedom is \nwhittled away. The beginning of open hostility arrives with Kristullnucht in \nNovember 1938. \nHitler enters Austria without incident in March of 1938, and Poland \nin September of 1939. France and England, fearing Hitler’s ambition, \ndeclare war too late. For its defiance, Britain suffers through a campaign \nof nightly air attacks called the Blitzkrieg (“lightning war”).

Some brave souls stand watch on the \nroofs of historical buildings like St. Paul’s Cathedral, ready with buckets \nof water to douse any blaze and are often thanked generously (if covertly) \nby Kindred who would prefer not to see London in flames again (the Great \nFire of 1666 was enough for them). Children are evacuated across the sea \nfrom besieged London (perhaps along with precious childer) until the u- \nboats target the vessels, then to the English countryside. Meanwhile, \nFrance endures Nazi occupation, and worse, the personal betrayal of the \nVichy government as their own countrymen work with the invaders. \nEverywhere the Nazis go, the Jews are deported and put on trains of cattle \ncars, bound for the work camps or gas chambers. \nAmerica’s situation on the homefront was one of readiness and \nsacrifice for the war effort.

Thinking to avert a \npotential crisis of Japanese spies in their midst, the government orders all \nJapanese-Americans into internment camps. Such a “solution” could \nsurely bring out Cathayan vampires, enraged at the treatment of their \nrelatives. It is also not unlikely that some unscrupulous Kindred haunt the \nbarracks of Topaz and other camps for feeding grounds, or suddenly find \ncertain contacts have been shipped off. \nRumors occasionally circulate regarding how the Tremere’s Vienna \nstronghold survived the Anschloss when Hitler’s army entered Austria, \nand none speak well of the Tremere.

Dark \nrumors still circulate that unscrupulous Tremere and Tzimisce used camp \nvictims as subjects for unsavory experiments, while opportunistic vampires of \nthe Camarilla and Sabbat haunted the barracks as feeding grounds. \nSeveral international organizations make it their business to track those \nNazis who escaped justice following the war, and most keep detailed files of \nofficers and camp officials, including photographs. A Kindred who appears no \ndifferent from his 1939 photos is going to attract immediate attention from \nNazi-hunters. Agencies like Mossad or Interpol often have international \ncooperation, and even the Inquisition is hard-pressed to keep up with these \nzealous hunters.

Bands like the Sex \nPistols and the Ramones characterize the music, while metal spikes, \nbrightly dyed hair, combat boots and battered leather characterize the \nlook. The hedonism of punk bands often draws neonates to their \nbanners, and many young vampires find the music an excellent way to \nirritate their elders.

They are often proactive people in the \nchronicle who are good at making their own fun and at involving other \ncharacters to assist their research. On the other hand, it can drag down \nthings tremendously to have a player who nitpicks every detail and \ndemands that every inquiry be answered encyclopedically, not to men- \ntion a player whose entertainment needs exceed what the average player \nbase wants. At worst, such players can easily get bored and act up in ways \nthat can rip a chronicle apart, just so they can have a challenge (not \nunlike gifted students in a “normal” class). \nDon’t punish a smart player whose character is a good research hound or \nwho manages to avoid the pitfalls that other players seem to walk into. You’re \nwasting a potentially valuable resource, not to mention that it sends the \nmessage that you punish players who “ruin” your clever plotting. Instead, \nthink about what you can do to prolong her run enough to get things caught \nup, or how you can utilize this underestimated resource. \nNever underestimate the value of the red herring. Even Jung and \nEinstein followed wild tangents or lines of research that never panned \nout and gone some interesting places in the process. The red herring is \na fine way to buy some time should a plot be in danger of getting busted \nopen too soon. However, don’t get dependent on them - \nthere’s a point \nwhere it’s going to look painfully obvious. Remember what you threw \nout in this go-around, because a red herring for this plotline may be a \nsignpost to something else. \nSome smart players enjoy being smart by themselves, i.e., they hoard \ntheir hard-won information, gloat over their hoard like a miser with his gold, \nand don’t share well. Consider throwing a nugget into another player’s \npossession through his downtime or another line of research he’s working on. \nEventually the hunter’s going to have to come out and socialize for that clue \nand will hopefully do so well. Done properly, this can slow down your target \nfor a couple months, particularly if the other character has all the recalci- \ntrance of a snapping turtle. A few such redirections can keep the player going \nwithout being aware of getting slowed down. \nPlayers who are heavily into researching and hunting for clues eat up \nthings like history and background. Most Storytellers create large histories \nfor their chronicles to explain how their cities and Kindred relations got to \ntheir current state. How much of that ever gets seen by the players? Probably \nnot a lot, and that can be a little discouraging to think that all that work is \ngoing to go unseen. If you have a player who loves to research and piece \nthings together from the past, consider mining some tidbits from your back \nstory and seeding them into her downtime results (if they’re relevant). It \ncan be a great way to get some of that grunt work you did into play. And you \nnever know if the seed you planted early on will blossom into a full-fledged \nplot down the road. \nOn the flip side, there’s covering the bases, and then there’s just plain \nridiculous. For example, the player of a Salubri is researching a disease that’s \nrecently cropped up among Kindred. The player also just read The Hot Zone \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

On one \nhand, it’s cool to see that the player is getting so much enjoyment out of the \nplot; on the other hand, trying to follow five courses of research is a tad \nmuch. Your best bet is to acknowledge (however briefly) the work that the \nplayer put in to her downtime before you determine if she’s spent enough \ntime and resources to get certain answers.

On the other hand, demanding that someone have \nArt History to do any sort of research on, say, the Mona Lisa, is frankly \nridiculous. You may choose to ask them what Abilities, Backgrounds, \nInfluences and other relevant material they’re bringing to the table when \nthey’re doing their research if there’s a particular point that you feel \nshould go to someone who has a better toehold on the material (special- \nized study may allow someone to skip the basics that someone without that \nknowledge will have to wade through). \nObviously, there’s a fine line between a player who makes a logical leap \nand one who metagames, and that line makes all the difference. If you’re \nconcerned that someone is metagaming rather than puzzle-solving, it’s not \nout of line to ask her to show her paper trail.

Further, your savvy players have commandeered the \nInternet and e-mail as part and parcel of the game. Bad news? Only if you \nlook at it that way. E-mail and the Internet can be one of your chronicle’s \nbest friends if properly harnessed. For all the good it can do, the Web can \nalso be a thorn in your metaphysical side.

It allows you to think about your answers and can provide a handy \npaper trail if things are disputed, or you have a less-than-perfect memory. E- \nmail lists can take care of a number of matters, from announcements from the \nprince to news regarding the game’s more mundane aspects. Some games use \nthem to put out news stories of events that are taking place in their city, from \nconventions to strange murders. \nA Web site can be a fine place to throw lots of hard facts about the game, \nboth story and mundane - \nvenue descriptions, dates and times, directions, \ncharacter creation limits. A single URL at the bottom of your flyer can \ndirect potential new players to all the neat stuff you’d tell them about if you \ncould stand at that flyer 24 hours a day. For players, this can be a spot to find \nout about an out-of-character social, get those last-minute directions or \nlearn about the venue before bringing in an inappropriate character. If \nanyone is feeling really adventurous, e-mail links to characters and Story- \ntellers, game pictures, rogue’s galleries of characters, PDF files of character \nsheets and links to the coffeehouse the troupe patronizes can add pizzazz to \nsomething straightforward. \nThe Web can be an invaluable research tool for digging up answers on \na subject you barely know. A simple query in a search engine can return \nmany places to research to your heart’s content; no matter how exotic the \nsubject, chances are someone out there knows about it. E-commerce and \nsearch engines are useful for hunting up the existence of an object or service \nwhose legitimacy is questionable (“So you want a million-candlepower \nhand-held spotlight?

They’re getting \nready for you to narrate a scene where the three of them will work on \npatching up a Masquerade breach at a night club. You say, “You come in \nand see the following: a bar to the left, an open DJ booth to the right, about \n50 people on the dance floor and two dozen more around the three pool \ntables in the back. What do you do?” You can’t understand why they’re \nlooking at you a little vacantly. \nA description like that is right up there with the infamous, “You enter a \n10 by 10 room with four orcs and a box of unidentified treasure.” Players will \nfind it hard to get excited (much less interested) about the scene if they don’t \nknow what’s going on. They rely on you to set the stage that their characters \nwill strut and fret upon. You know what the place looks like in your head \n(don’t you?), but the players can’t see through your skull into that place you’re \nthinking of. So how do you go about getting a little more bang for the buck? \nWhen setting a stage, remember that we don’t merely look at what’s \nhappening before us and call it a scene. Humans (and Kindred) rely on their \nentire range of sensory input to give them information about what’s \nhappening around them, what might have happened in the past and what \nmight happen in the future. A complete scene involves all five senses. So \nwhen describing a location for your players, give thought not only to what \nthe place looks like visually, but what it sounds like, smells like, tastes like \nand feels like. To return to our earlier attempt at the night club: “The \nnightclub is a little hole-in-the-wall dive that probably only operates a few \ntimes a week in what used to be a dry cleaning shop. Several people in the \nlatest bondage and Goth gear stand outside smoking - \nthe smoke rising \nfrom one young man smells strangely sweet, almost like cherries. Inside, the \nthunderous industrial music is rattling anything not nailed down, including \nthe bottles behind the bar. The DJ booth perches over the crowd against one \nwall. The walls are cinderblock, painted black, and the black-and-white \nlinoleum dance floor is surrounded by enormous woofers and tweeters. \nAbout 50 young people are out on the floor, thrashing and swaying with the \nmusic. You inhale, and the combined smells of cigarettes, sweat, cheap \nfragrances and leather all rush down your nostrils and over your palate. The \nplace is crowded, and a rail-thin girl with white-blonde hair wearing scarlet \nvelvet brushes past you, glancing back for half a second to apologize. As you \nturn to speak, you catch a whiff of vitae on the passing girl.” \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The absence, impairment or overstimulation of any particular \nsense can provoke amazing reactions; torturers the world over understand \nthis very well. In the case of someone playing a character who is deaf, blind \nor missing another sense like smell or taste, she’ll look to you for vivid \ndescriptions that her other senses will use to fill in the gap in her under- \nstanding. Someone who can hear but has a derangement that makes him \nnervous of certain sounds will want to know if his particular madness is \nthrobbing in response to stimuli. The Heightened Senses of Auspex in \nparticular need a great deal of detail - \nreading a letter by touch, smelling \na perfume to pull apart its components or focusing the sight to study the very \nbrushstrokes made by Rembrandt when he painted “The Night Watch” will \nall require you to delve a little deeper into the logistics of sensory percep- \ntion. That said, imagine what happens when that sense is overloaded - \nthe \nsensitized fingers get slammed with a hammer or the sharply focused eyes get \nstruck with a camera flash. No wonder vampires with overloaded Heightened \nSenses spend time stunned and dazed! \nAction is what makes things happen - \nseriously! When you’re describing \na scene, evocative words can go a long way to really nailing down how \nsomething looks to you and your players. Consider the following example: “As \nyou pass the alley, a miasma of piss, sweat and vitae wafts over you” versus “You \nsmell urine, sweat and Kindred blood when you walk by the alley.” Which one \npaints the more detailed picture? Boning up on your vocabulary will do \nwonders for scene description, as you pull out such lovely mouthfuls as \n“baroque,” “pandemic,” “untoward.” \nAll of us have “that song,” the one that we first kissed to, that we broke \nup to or that we’ve designated as our personal theme song. Movie music does \nthis in particular, leading viewers to understand subtext or emotional themes \nin a scene without necessarily stating them outright. The occasional piece of \nmusic can be crucial in helping your players think about the scene their \ncharacters are going through. A complex harpsichord piece can be indicative \nof an elder’s equally complex plots and older manners, while the quiet sound \nof a single koto invokes the tranquility of a formal Japanese garden. Music can \nhelp define the space that you’re setting aside for your players to create this \nscene; this isn’t the corner of the recreation basement or even the second \nroom of the Elysium. While the music plays, you’re in a Zen garden, an elder’s \nparlor or with a lovestruck ghoul. \nNot every Storyteller character must hinge on the plot, appear \nthere solely to deliver a line like the cauldron ghosts of Macbeth and \nthen depart. Sometimes, the best roleplaying can come from a chance \nencounter, something unexpected (just like real life) that must be \ndealt with and might even be a foreshadowing of things to come (the \nfirst encounter with an Ally). If you’re short on time or have a \nparticularly garrulous player, obviously you can adjust this. Still, \nchance encounters can make a scene sparkle - \nthe Indian man behind \nthe gas station counter who’s nervous of certain people, the child who \nsees through the Nosferatu’s Mask while he’s hunting, the elderly \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Well, the cavalry is here! \nHere’s the different types and what you can do with them. \nNarrators are those folks who are in amongst the players, usually with \ntheir own characters, but who are available as necessary for challenges (such \nas Simple Tests, Virtue Challenges) or as an extra set of eyes when combat \nhits. Typically, Narrators are more rules-oriented, and the best seem to have \nencyclopedic memories regarding where every rule can be found and where \nare the three instances that contradict said rule. Still, they know when a \nchallenge needs to be seen by a Storyteller and when to let the Storyteller \ndo the talking. \nAssistant Storytellers do just that, assist the Storyteller with keeping \nthe chronicle on track. Often, an assistant is in charge of a particular \naspect of the game that needs watching, but the Storyteller is about to \ndrown in watching everything else - this could be Influences and \nBackgrounds, or maybe keeping a weather eye out for in-game Masquerade \nbreaches. Assistant Storytellers may or may not maintain their own \ncharacters, according to Storyteller needs for the game. They may play for \nstints, then take a shift at the Storyteller desk for those little emergencies \nlike watching a ritual be performed or running a minor scene while the \nStoryteller deals with something bigger. Some assistants even run their \nown subplots after getting permission from the Storyteller. It’s often from \namong these folks that the chronicle’s next Storyteller can be found. \nYou yourself know best how much help you need (and you’re never \nbeyond help) and where it should go. If your game is small, you may need \nonly one or two Narrators and a single Assistant Storyteller to run some \nsubplots for players to chew on each session. O n  the other hand, if you have \na large chronicle or some details that necessitate more attention (a number \nof inexperienced players, heavy use of Influences, a location that seems to \ngenerate a lot of character interest), then you’ll probably want more \nNarrators and at least two assistants to oversee the details that you’ve \nforgotten because you’re writing plot. Again, you know what will make your \ngame run better. \nIt’s a given that people will always find something to disagree about - \nit’s life. When you disagree with your Narrator or an Assistant Storyteller, it’s \nstill life, but you don’t want to have it out right there. Take it elsewhere. \nUnless the matter is so heinous that you can’t possibly let it go, take it \nelsewhere. Don’t scream at each other in public - \nit’s not nice to each other \nor to the players. If you disagree on a ruling, unless it’s so gross that you can’t \nlet it slide (or it means a character could live or die), let it roll for now. By \nconstantly overseeing and correcting their work, you indicate to your assis- \ntants that you don’t trust them fully, and if you show the players you don’t trust \nyour assistant’s rulings, they won’t trust them either. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Supernatural creatures that are hostile to each other sometimes \nhave common enemies - \nafter all: “The enemy of my enemy is my ally.” \nAnd there’s nothing like the confusion that reigns when one group discov- \ners its favorite hang-out has been staked as sacred by some band of \nill-tempered (and powerful) thugs. \nCrossovers can easily happen when a Cainite with a high Humanity \nscore tries to clean up the city and starts encountering Wyrm-tainted \nfomori or other fell creatures who normally battle Lupines. Will the \nLupines start wondering who’s doing their work, and how will they \nreward their “helper” when they do learn? What of a Giovanni who \ntemporarily devotes her efforts to fighting a particularly nasty Spectre \nwho also preys on a local Circle of Renegade wraiths? Will the Circle \ncontinue to ally with her, or is she merely taking care of the Spectre \nbecause he’s muscling in on her turf? While the status quo antagonism \nwill return when the threat is gone, these crossovers can lead to mutual \nrespect and common ground. \nCrossovers can also happen when one type of supernatural denizen \nattempts to play King of the Hill. Consider the frustration of the Nosferatu \nwho tries to boot a sluagh from “his” sewers and later discovers that someone \nis mysteriously and repeatedly draining his spawning pool, yet does not show \nup on cameras in and out of the area (nasty little chimera!). What of the \nTremere regent who finds herself racing with a local Uktena Theurge and \nmortal Ancient Order of the Aeon Rites coven to recover a lost talisman of \nsorcerous power? These crossovers can lead to double-crosses and outright \nhostility, so manage them carefully. \nFinally, sometimes a Cainite’s search for hidden and forgotten lore can \nlead him to consult with strange creatures; a Kiasyd might contact the local \nKithain (who have heard of such creatures in the vaguest of legends, if at all), \nor a Gangrel unraveling a mystery might be directed to a local Bone Gnawer \nby Kinfolk.

Work with your players in establishing \nguidelines for power levels as discussed below. \nFinally, Storytellers must moderate the actions of “Apocalypse Now!” \nplayers, such as the disgruntled Caitiff who published maps of the next \nElysium and mailed them to every Lupine in a four-state area. Beyond \ndealing with the carnage wrought by this wild-eyed fruitcake, you need a \nway to keep the story rolling without pulling out an unrealistic deux ex \nmachinae.

For many Storyteller characters you may \nnot even have well-developed sheets, but may instead rely upon a line or \ntwo jotted down in a notebook or on index cards: “The Quick Corner clerk \nis a punkish, tattooed older teen with a shock of red hair. She seems \nconfident and self-assured, with a steely gleam in her jaded but young eyes. \nShe is actually a changeling, an Unseelie redcap wilder, with Basic-level \nArts.” You can often make simple characters seem more real when you \nfocus on mannerisms, styles of dress and speech habits. Maybe our above \nexample redcap clerk has a habit leaving her hightops untied, or drops an \nautomatic (not necessarily sincere) apology when she curses. If the \ncharacter is interesting to interact with, no one’s going to much care how \nbutch her sheet is. \nWhen you do decide to give statistics to your crossover Storyteller \ncharacters, go sparingly on Lores and special Abilities. Most Garou do not \nrealize that the Kindred’s fabled weakness to wooden stakes is real, and \nnoble sidhe changelings who knew the Prodigal races of the Dark Ages \nwill be at a loss to understand the Giovanni or modern anarchs. To avoid \nspoiling the mood of mystery and danger, you should generally try to avoid \nmixed-genre “killer combinations,” such as the angry Black Fury war- \nmachine who has both the Luna’s Armor Gift and the changeling \nOakenshield and Quicksilver cantrips cast on her, or the Risen who has \nmore sorcerous enchantments and wards than a bad Aleister Crowley \nimitation. These latter start looking like the Uber-NPCs we warned you \nabout earlier. \nIt’s easy to focus on the full-blooded supernaturals as being a worthy \nchallenge, but the mortal relatives of these creatures can prove even more \ninteresting for crossover use. Werewolf Kinfolk and changeling kinain are \noften more common than their full-powered relatives, and Consorts of \nwraiths are certainly more accessible than their ghostly associates. Often \nthese people make useful ‘[nice old man down the street” crossovers, which \nare more roleplaying-oriented than the usual clash-of-titans encounters, \nbecause they have limited but useful knowledge and because player \ncharacters are more likely to see them as a resource or ally instead of as \ncompetition. Should the players mistreat these “weak” ones, though, the \nsupernatural kin of the oppressed are certain to come looking for the \nplayer characters. \nYou may also want to use Storyteller characters drawn from the psychics, \nsorcerers, shamans and priests described in Laws of the Hunt and Laws of the \nHunt Players’ Guide. Want to up the ante for your Tremere who have been \nless than helpful regarding mortal activities? Let them uncover a coven of \nmortal sorcerers who are now using Kindred as sacrifices to summon infernal \nhelp with the Daimonis Praxis. Want your Gangrel to find an unusual \nuoudoun-like rural cult as the start of a larger plot? Use a shamanistic Uzoma \nbabalawo or sorcerous Uzoma bokor. Want to create a rival for a particularly \nseductive Toreador?

One \nrough way of classifying these worlds is to call the lands of the dead the \n“Low Umbra,” the realms of elementals and nature spirits the “Middle \nUmbra” and rarefied heights of abstract concepts the “High Umbra,” as \ndescribed in The Book of Worlds. The closest parts of each of these \nUmbrae are called the “Periphery.” Wraiths normally interact with the \nliving world from the Shadowlands, which are the Periphery of the Low \nUmbra. Lupines, nature spirits and elementals often use the Penumbra, \nwhich is the periphery of the Middle Umbra. Kindred, mortal sorcerers \nand mages occasionally use the periphery of the High Umbra, which \nKindred and sorcerers often call the astral plane and Awakened \nwillworkers call the Vulgate. \nA vampire using Psychic Projection normally enters the astral plane or \nVulgate. If he wanders too far or his silver cord is broken, however, he may \nbecome lost and find himself in the Penumbra or Shadowlands. Conflict in \neither can be disastrous, as a Cainite uses Mental Traits in lieu of Physical \nTraits, but wraiths and Garou use Physical Traits for “physical” combat. A \nstrong Lupine or Spectre may rend the Cainite’s psyche into small pieces, \ntrapping the Cainite in torpor indefinitely. \nWOLVESATTHE \nDOOR \nAncient and embittered enemies, vampires and werewolves have long \nfought for control of their respective territories.

The Embrace \ncuts a werewolfs spirit away from the world’s soul, literally ripping her out of \nthe great cycle of life and denying her the very reason for which she lives. \nDespair usually sets in at some point, and suicide carries off more of these \ncreatures than anything. \nAbominations are created no differently than other Kindred, but the \nvictim can make a last Gnosis Challenge in an attempt to avoid her fate. On \na win, the victim dies quietly in the attempt and her spirit travels on. Should \nshe tie, the Garou’s spirit will still pass on, but it will be bloody and agonizing. \nOn a loss, the Garou becomes an Abomination. No power short of divine \nintervention can affect this challenge. \nLike any other vampire, an Abomination learns three levels of Disci- \nplines and has the weakness of whatever clan Embraced her (or she could be \nCaitiff). Like any other vampire, she can heal herself or boost her Attributes \nwith blood. That’s where the benefits end. \nAn Abomination’s spirit connections begin to wither almost immedi- \nately upon the Embrace. She cannot increase her Gnosis, nor can she heal \nherself like a werewolf - \nshe must spend blood to do so. While she may \nremember the rites and Gifts she used before her change, she won’t get the \nsame results if she attempts to use them now. Her Gifts now only attract the \nattention of Wyrm-spirits due to her own state as an unclean thing. If she \nattempts to learn more Gifts or rites, she must learn them from Wyrm-spirits \nor Banes, and these are foul spirits who have no interest in dealing truthfully \nwith an Abomination.

Even though changelings can sometimes be detected by Aura \nPerception, fewer Kindred know of the Kithain; the exceptions are nor- \nmally Malkavians and the Kiasyd of the Sabbat. While most of this can be \nattributed to simple, “I don’t believe in faeries,” there are magical causes \nas well. This forgetfulness is partly because a Cainite must be “enchanted” \nin order to even see the Kithain fully, and partly because after an \nenchantment fades the Mists of the Dreaming erase the memories of what \nhappened while enchanted from mortals, Kindred and others, the Kindred \nof Malkavian blood as the sole exception. \nChangelings can enchant Kindred in several different ways. Kiasyd \nwith Fae Sight are always enchanted. A Cainite can be enchanted if a \nchangeling convinces her to freely accept a token of enchantment. \nFeeding from a changeling can also enchant a Cainite (if the changeling \nmade the offer and the Kindred accepted), and at Storyteller discretion \nmay induce any number of weird effects, from hallucinations to derange- \nments. Malkavians who feed on changelings are freed from the effects of \none derangement but must win or tie a Simple Test with a Narrator to \navoid developing an addiction to the heady vitae - \nand a Cainite with \na craving for Kithain blood is rarely welcome in changeling freeholds. A \nCainite normally stays enchanted for one day per Glamour Trait in- \nvested in a token of enchantment or one day per blood trait ingested; \nStaying in a changeling glade or freehold can prolong this. As long as the \nvampire has one Trait of changeling blood in her system, she can see \nchimerical reality. \nWhen a Cainite passes from enchantment to mundane reality; or \nwhen he is slain by chimerical monsters, weapons or magic; he normally \nfalls into a torpor with the duration based upon his Banality. For most \nKindred this can last up to two months. A Cainite may avoid falling into \nthis torpor when enchantment slips away by spending a Willpower Trait \n(Malkavians need not spend this trait - \nthey automatically avoid this \ntorpor). If slain chimerically, though, a Cainite is “out for the count,” as \ndescribed in The Shining Host. \nKindred are undead creatures with an unnatural, rigid stasis; they do \nnot grow and live.

You may \nchoose to adjust the amount of Banality for factors such as high Human- \nity, Path ratings or youth. \nBanality can prove dangerous to changelings and deadly to chimeri. \ncal companions.

The Shroud \nthins in places where mortal belief encourages the idea of ghosts: grave- \nyards, foggy roads, old attics, certain nights of the year - \nand thickens \nwhere it does not: parking lots, shopping malls. Many Kindred havens and \nhangouts often have moderate Shroud ratings. \nOf the forbidden Guilds, the four Guilds teaching the Arcanoi of \nEmbody, Outrage, Pandemonium and Puppetry are the most likely to \ninteract with Kindred, though many wraiths using these Arcanoi on \nKindred belong to no Guild. With Embody, wraiths may manifest to \nKindred; given the long undead “life” of most Kindred, they are a perfect \nconsort for attunement for Embody. Spooks and Haunters using Outrage \nand Pandemonium often haunt Kindred because of the Pathos they gain \nfrom tormenting vampires. Kindred are particularly vulnerable to fren- \nzies induced by illusions of blood created with Foul Humor or windows \nopened in a haven by Death’s Touch. Finally, practitioners of the \nPuppetry Arcanos find that attuning a Cainite results in a wonderfully \nlong-lasting Consort for possession. \nWraiths may use their powers of Deathsight, Lifesight and Sharpened \nSenses to examine Kindred; Spectres normally cannot, unless they have the \nArcanoi known as Shroud Rending. When looking for a Cainite who has \nhidden herself in a crowd of mortals, a wraith can easily spot her by her signs \nof arrested death using the wraith‘s own Deathsight. A wraith may also use \nLifesight to perform a form of Aura Perception; the paler aura of most Kindred \nusually reveals them for what they are. Finally, a wraith may use Sharpened \nSenses to pierce Cainite Chimerstry or Obfuscate as if the wraith had the basic \nlevels of Auspex. \nWraiths usually associate with vampires as haunts or spirit mentors. \nHaunts may occasionally be extremely hostile and dedicated to a Cainite’s \ndestruction, but this is rare. Many haunts either have a Kindred as a \nFetter or are using the Kindred as a source of Pathos. Vampires have a \nway of creating wraiths, and it only takes one careless feeding for a \nKindred to have a companion that will never leave. As much as a wraith \nmight hate the vampire who created her, she is unlikely to destroy that \nFetter. Her Shadow, on the other hand, is not quite so particular. A \nwraith that uses Kindred as a source of Pathos, on the other hand, may \nnot be as sentimental about keeping the Cainite around. If, however, she \nhas put in the rime and effort into attuning the Cainite for Embody or \nPandemonium, she is unlikely to destroy the Cainite out-of-hand; instead \nshe will focus on making the Cainite’s life as miserable as her creativity \nallows (and with the right Arcanoi, she can make forever seem like a \nvery long time indeed). In turn, a Cainite can cause problems for a wraith \nby the simple expedient of running through the location where the \nwraith is standing, temporarily disrupting the wraith and costing it a \nCorpus Trait as the wraith becomes incorporeal. \nA wraith who aids a Cainite with the Spirit Mentor Merit is much more \nhelpful.

Oblivion is the \nobvious tool for building a wraith. For game balance, you probably do \nnot want to assign the Storyteller character wraith more than Interme- \ndiate Embody (Life-in-Death) or Intermediate Pandemonium (FoulHurnor), \nand you probably do not want to exceed Basic levels for other Arcanoi \nunless you have a high-powered game. Remember to determine why and \nhow the wraith decided to associate with Kindred. If you’re feeling \nsadistic, you might even assign a wraith’s Psyche to help a Kindred and \nits Shadow to destroy her. \nSome vampires will have more truck with the Shadowlands than others. \nGiovanni, Harbingers of Skulls and the rare Nagaraja all interact with the \nlands of the dead. Solitary Heretic and Renegade Wraiths tend to fear these \nKindred because of the powers granted them by Necromancy. In turn, these \nKindred are usually smart enough to avoid angering the Hierarchy leadership \nor powerful Circles of Renegades or Heretics. After all, no Cainite wants to \nwake up from daysleep in mid-afternoon as the local wraiths dismantle her \nhaven board by board. \nA few wraiths learn how to reanimate their bodies in the Skinlands, \ndriven by a need or passion so fierce that they could literally not stay buried. \nThese Risen often find it easy to hide among Kindred, as they exhibit many \nof the same outward signs as a vampire. Since Risen can learn the Disciplines \nof Celerity, Potence, Fortitude and Obfuscate, they are often remarkably \nsuccessful at infiltrating Camarilla courts or anarch gangs; a few pass them- \nselves off as Sabbat, taking advantage of the opportunity of random destruction \nto cover their own tracks. Many times, a Risen can hide successfully until \nsomeone tries to put the bite on her - \nthe resultant mouthful of embalming \nfluids (or curdled blood and vinegar) is enough to sicken the unwary, not to \nmention enraging the Risen. \nKindred are not happy creatures. Wraiths who constantly follow Kindred \nthrough the night risk acquiring Angst and the rise of their darker side, the \nShadow. If you want to further emphasize the taint of Oblivion on Kindred, \nyou might grant one trait of temporary Angst for every hour that a wraith \nspends in the company of 10 or more Kindred. \nUnless the vampire has met both Shadow and Psyche, or has appro- \npriate knowledge (Wraith Lore), she is unlikely to know when the Shadow \nhas come to visit as opposed to the wraith.

Nihilistics, a strange Discipline used only by the rare Nagaraja \nbloodline, allows a vampire to feast on a wraith via Soul Feasting. \nKindred Disciplines \nAsh Path Necromancy: A vampire must have the first level of Ash \nPath Necromancy (Shroudsight) to see past the Shroud. A wraith attempt- \ning to hide in the Shadowlands through an Arcanos from an observer in \nthe living world tests against either the vampire’s Auspex or Ash Path \nrating, whichever is higher. \nAuspex: A wraith who is materialized or Embodied can be read with \nAura Perception. As wraiths are pure emotion, their auras do not halo \naround them - \ninstead, their forms shimmer with color. Risen auras read \nno differently than other vampire’s. Some claim that the Shadow can be \nseen as a muddy blot upon the aura of any wraith or Risen, but the claim \nremains unverified. \nObfuscate: All wraiths may attempt to see through Obfuscate, using \nLifesight and a Mental Challenge. \nArcanoi \nEmbody: Embodied wraiths are affected by all Disciplines that can affect \nordinary mortals (Dominate, Presence).

Fatal Vision \nallows the wraith to witness the vampire’s Embrace, the end of his mortal life. \nKeening: At Storyteller discretion, an Embodied wraith may spend a \nWillpower (in addition to any other expenses) and perform Requiem, which \nmay force a vampire into or out of frenzy. \nMoliate: Vicissitude and Moliate are nothing alike, although they are \nvery similar in ideas. Moliate works only on wraithly plasm while Vicissitude \nworks only flesh (Embody doesn’t count here).

Most mages who find \nthemselves in such a condition commit suicide shortly thereafter. \nSome Storytellers may be tempted to let mages do almost anything \nimagined - \nresist the temptation. Remember that each mage has a paradigm \nthat she must follow. For example, let’s say that you are considering having \na Storyteller character mage who can turn Kindred into lawnchairs. What is \nher paradigm? Is she Verbena? A Verbena might turn someone into a toad, \ntemporarily, but not lawn ornaments. Order of Hermes? She is more likely to \ntransform someone into a mythical beast than something found in a garden \nshop. In short, it’s unlikely. \nCan a Kindred be restored to mortality? Entirely possible, say the \nlegends, but this takes the powers of a Master or Oracle of Sphere magic, \nand they have fled this world, with most barred from re-entering by the \nAvatar storm that shrieks incessantly on the other side of the Gauntlet. \nEven if one of these mighty ones could be found, the Effect is highly \nvulgar and the Paradox riskcatastrophic. Magic can also be used to break \na blood bond, whether amortal’s or vampire’s, although this too is a risky \nproposition, one whose difficulty increases for every decade the bond \nhas been in effect. \nIt is possible for a mage call on her Spheres to combat certain \nKindred Discplines, most often Animalism, Dominate, Presence and \nThaumaturgy, an effort called countermagic. At Storyteller discretion, a \nmage may be able to counter specific Discipline powers that target the \nmind or soul with appropriate Spheres. To counter Animalism, Dominate \nor Presence, a mage must have Basic Mind, spend a Willpower Trait and \nmake an Arete Challenge. To counter Thaumaturgy, the mage spends \nthe Willpower and makes the Arete Challenge. By expending a Mental \nTrait, she may either interrupt a Thaumaturgy ritual or negate its effects \nafter its completion. \nVampiric blood magic is relatively simple, being powered by Kindred \nvitae. While not as versatile as the Spheres, blood magic’s static effects do not \nincur Paradox, and blood magic may be used to counter a mage’s Effects. \nThose using Thaumaturgy, blood magic of Assamites or Setites, or Tzimisce \nkolduns make a Willpower Challenge against the mage in a countermagic \nattempt. A number of Tremere practice a specific path called Thaumaturgical \nCountermagic (The Camarilla Guide), said to be quite effective in dealing \nwith mage Effects. \nIn challenges between Auspex versus illusion or invisibility rotes \n- \nor Obfuscate or Chimerstry versus sensory Effects - \nuse the Auspex \nversus Obfuscate rule in Laws of the Night. The level of Sphere in use \n(or highest Sphere for combined effects) and the level of the Disci- \npline are compared. \nLife magic does not affect vampires. Most Life Effects that work on a \nmortal body can be performed on a vampire using Matter. To heal a vampire, \nthe mage must use Matter and Prime in a conjunctional Effect.

The World of Darkness holds \nmany unusual creatures in addition to Kindred, Garou, changelings \nand wraiths, and mortal humans are often among the most surpris- \ning. Liber des Goules describes the roles of ghouls in mortal \nsociety. Laws of the H u n t  and Laws of the H u n t  Players’ Guide \ndescribe psychics, sorcerers and clergy who also people the World of \nDarkness. If you use these sources, remember that ordinary mortals \naren’t as robust as Kindred and have a maximum of eight Physical, \nSocial or Mental Traits if they have no supernatural abilities or \nheritage, and a maximum of nine Physical, Social or Mental traits \nif they have a supernatural heritage (ghoul, Kinfolk, Kinain) or \nhave Numina. \nPSYCHIC \nE R I E N D S  NETWORK \nAs the Storyteller, you can use Laws of the Hunt to prepare Storyteller \ncharacters or Narrate for players who have psychic powers, called Numina. \nYou may also choose to create hedge wizards and shamans from Laws of the \nHunt as well instead of using the more complex systems in Laws of the Hunt \nPlayers’ Guide. Players who portray psychics can add a mortal flavor to a \nvampire game with their ability to walk in the daylight and use special powers \nsuch as Psychometry or Telepathy. Keep in mind, though, that the Cainite \nEmbrace destroys psychic Numina, and the player of a psychic character may \nbe frustrated at losing the months of experience that she has invested in the \npsychic power. Also remember that mortal psychics cannot heal as fast as \nKindred and are more vulnerable to many environmental concerns, such as \nlack of air or temperature extremes. You may even want to emphasize the fear \nand uncertainty faced by mortal friends and allies of Kindred through the \nexperiences of a relatively defenseless psychic character. \nCertain Cainite Disciplines may interact strangely with \npsychic Numina: \nAt higher levels, Psychometry often yields more potent images \nthan a Cainite using Auspex’s power of the Spirit’s Touch and can \noverwhelm the psychic. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Typically, \na mortal hedge wizard’s power is weaker than that of his Cainite \ncounterparts in the Tremere and Tzimisce clans, and humans have fewer \nmaximum Traits than Kindred, but mortals can often do what Kindred \ncannot easily do, such as summon spirits or angels and demons with \nPraxes like Spirit Calling or Daimonis. With their powers, numbers and \nmortal organizations, mortal sorcerers can often prove to be able-bodied \nassistants or harsh foes of the Tremere or Tzimisce kolduns. \nSorcerous Praxes occasionally interact with Cainite Disciplines: \nDemonic forces summoned with the Dark Thaumaturgy ritual of Call \nForth the Host are very vulnerable to control by the mortal Praxis of Daimonis, \nespecially powers such as Dolor and Truce. \nObviously a mortal using Hellfire causes a Cainite witnessing its use to \nmake a Courage test or enter Rotschreck. The difficulty of the test depends on \nhow much fire the mortal creates. \nA Cainite with Auspex may see through the powers of the Praxis of \nIllusion as if he were attempting to pierce the phantasms of Chimerstry. \nA mortal with the Mentalis Praxis may intercept, and be intercepted by, \na Cainite with the Auspex power of Telepathy with a Static Mental Challenge. \nCROSSOVER \nLOCALES \nYou may decide to run a game mixing Kindred with other \nsupernaturals.

This may or may not be a \ngood thing, as conflict often breaks out when Kindred and others \nmix. A more neutral or open location, where the Masquerade makes \nconflict a definite no-no might work better. The local Cainite \nfeeding grounds may also be a good choice for crossovers, especially \nif the common feeding grounds, often called “the Rack,” are not \ncontrolled by any one agency; a particular club or restaurant in the \nRack might serve as a common place to find other supernaturals. In \nthe case of wraiths, you’ll need a place where the Shroud is thinner, \nor your players will spend the better part of the game trying to pierce \nthe Shroud instead of interacting. \nWherever the setting happens to land, you’ll need to work with your \nplayers in managing the “common ground.” There’s more to such a spot \nthan merely walking in and ordering a Type 0 cocktail and elderberry \nwine on the rocks? Who’s part of the nightly business of the place? What \nhappens if someone tries to take over the place by using Influences, or \ntrying to buy or bully it outright? Does the owner/operator realize that \nher place is becoming the hot spot for the local supernaturals? If yes, is \nshe doing anything about it? If no, how is she being kept in ignorance? \nMost importantly, why should one group of supernaturals not gang up on \nthe other group in the middle of this common spot? This last could go \nback to your plotline, it could be something settled by the setting, or \neven by how your critters interact. \nCONCLUSION \nCrossover events are one of the tools that you can use in painting \nthe World of Darkness for your players. Use crossovers to increase the \nmystery and tension for your troupe, and work with them to keep \nthings fresh. Be wary of too much knowledge - if you find the \nVentrue and Toreador primogen discussing the Litany or Escheat, \nyou know that you may have let things go too far (and it’s pretty \ndifficult to pull back when that’s happened). Consider carefully how \nmuch crossover your game can take; dogs and cats living together \n(i.e., Kindred and Garou living in sin) is definitely a sign of too \nmuch. Remember that good drama changes the characters whom it \ntouches, unlike melodrama, where characters return to the same \nsetting the next game session as if it were a fanged sitcom - \ntherefore, strive for good drama when bringing in new supernaturals, \nand avoid “‘monster of the week” plots. Use crossovers to emphasize \nthe themes in your troupe’s games. For example, emphasize the \nimportance of Humanity and the inhumanity of Kindred when a \nsidhe of House Fiona falls in love with the Toreador primogen who \nfeels the flickerings of love for the first time in years ... and then \naccidentally frenzies on her lover in the throes of a passionate \nembrace. Perhaps a Risen seeks justice for the murder of his lover, but \nhis justice requires the death of a particular Kindred. \nt- \nI \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

The \nlayout frankly stinks - \nit’s mostly a long slope overgrown with creeping \nvines and brush that runs down into a valley where the fog collects and \na little stream meanders through. Not much for lights, which means the \nplace turns into a pit after dark. The original idea for the place came from \nsome Audubon Society do-gooder who wanted something “natural.” In \nthis city, “natural” means “neglected,” so Bronger’s is now a favorite \nafter-dark spot for just about anything that shouldn’t be happening in \npublic. Consequently, Gina and I (who play beat cops for the brick who \nlikes to pretend he’s sheriff) spend a lot of time there. \nOver the past six months, there’d been a bunch of bodies showing up \nin the valley, all with serious blood loss and strange mutilations, which \nmeans we’ve got to assume the worst. Even better, the bodies had been \nfound by mortals out for their morning jog or walking the pooch or \nwhatever, and the papers were all over it, yammering about serial killers. \nSo Prince Warner is screaming at the brick for the heads of the Masquer- \nade-breakers, which means the brick is screaming for ours if we can’t hunt \nthis bastard down. Which brings us to tonight. \nWe’re hanging out in Gina’s car in the upper parking lot, watching \nthe lower lot and waiting for something to show up. Gina’s grumbling \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nabout how much she had to pull down with the police so they didn’t run \nus off park grounds like necking kids, I’m mentally calculating my odds \non tomorrow night’s races, and it’s the 10th night running we’ve been \non stakeout, with nothing. That’s when a car pulls into the empty \nparking lot below us. Gina nudges me, and I lean over for a look. Older \nmodel sedan, dark color, with the plate-light disabled. I make a mental \nnote to check the plate and have it run. \nThe car parks, cuts its lights and sits in the darkness for a few \nminutes. Finally, the driver’s door opens, and a dark-skinned man in \na suit gets out. No one I recognize. The passenger side opens too, and \na black girl gets out. She’s dressed in a nice-looking skirt and white \nsweater, maybe a college student. \nThey start heading for the crude stairway of dirt and railroad ties that \ngoes down through the creeper and into the valley. My hand’s on the door \nhandle, but Gina lays a warning hand on my arm. No, not yet. They \ndescend, and as they dip just below sight and out ofhearing range, she opens \nher car door and we follow. \nWe descend from the upper parking lot to the lower one, and I \ncheck the car as we pass - \na dealer’s drive-off plate, damn him. Still, \nthe car isn’t one I recognize from the parking lots during court. Now \nwe’re moving into the weed-choked darkness, following the faint \ntrail they’re leaving behind. Gina’s leading - \nI’m following what I \ncan see of her dark jacket and pale hands in the starlight. Around us, \nthe trees seem to close in, like great hands cupping around an insect \nto trap it. I’m no more paranoid than usual, but this feels different. \nIt feels like something is watching us, maybe from the trees or laying \nin the masses of creeper. I shrug my jacket into place, tapping at the \ntwo stakes and silenced pistol I’ve got laying in wait. \nWe’re approaching the valley. I can smell water and damp soil, hear \nthe faint gurgle of the stream passing over rocks. The rest of the woods \nis strangely quiet - \nno birds, no crickets, nothing but the water. The \nwatching feeling is getting stronger; my fists clench, almost automati- \ncally. Then there’s another smell - \nincense of some sort, something \nexotic, spicy. I stop on the trail to get a better read on the situation. \nNow I hear what sounds like groans, and I pause. Caution turns to \nfrustration. Christ. Just two kine wanting a cheap place to rut. I reach \nfor the hood on Gina’s jacket to pull her back, but she’s stepped out of \nmy reach. Irritated, I try to close the distance between us, and that’s \nwhen the other smell hits me. \nBlood. \nI ate earlier, so I’m not feeling hungry. The cool air of the valley now \nseems more like a slaughterhouse - \nthick, moist, strangely warm, the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nincense mingling with the coppery stench in a mix that’s starting to make \nme queasy. I almost crash into Gina, who is standing stock-still on the trail. \nWe look at each other, and I know what she’s thinking, because I’m \nthinking it too: Found him. Whether it’s a messy Kindred, or a kine gone \nbatshit, we found our valley serial killer. \nShe’s holding her flashlight (which could cold-cock a man) like a club. \nI check again for my means, and take out my pistol. She motions to me that \nwe should circle around and catch him from behind. I motion that I think \notherwise, but she indicates he’s currently too busy to notice us. I sigh \ninwardly - \nat least her risks are calculated ones. \nI creep through the brush, trying not to think about what could be \nunder my feet, focusing on the noise the whole time. I can just make out \nmovement about 10 feet away. I remember the student girl had that white \nsweater, and what’s ahead of me looks darker. The sounds are starting to \nchange, but I’m not sure what’s happening. I hear wet, meaty tearing.. . \ngulping.. . little growls deep inside the throat.. .. \nI see Gina about three feet from me, and the slashing motion she uses \nto indicate “get ready.” I turn my face toward the noise, pistol in hand and \nready to scare something shitless. Someone is squatting on the ground, bent \nover something dark, and the growls and groans seem to be coming from \nhim. Gina’s flashlight clicks. Suddenly the guy’s in a spotlight, and my \nevening meal is trying to climb my throat. \nThe man turns on us, snarling with surprise, his mouth a bloody gash \nin his face. Blood runs from his open mouth, and I realize he doesn’t have \nfangs. In one hand is a lump of dripping, maroon-colored flesh. The \nstudent, her mocha skin now ashen and mottled, is laying under him, her \neyes wide and blank. Her white sweater has turned mostly crimson. The \nsmell of blood, incense and death would make a lesser man faint. \nThe guy drops his meal and makes a run for Gina, who’s too \nstunned by the scene to react. The flashlight is knocked from her \nhand, hits the ground, and the beam rolls before it’s stopped by a tree \nand lights up the dead girl’s face. He shouts a bunch of gibberish, and \nGina briefly whirls past me, her hands batting at her face and she’s \nscreaming something like “Get them off me!” I’ve got a stake in my \nhands, and I’m trying to find this guy, and suddenly it’s there’s \nhundreds of angry voices howling and screaming in my ears, and tiny \nmouths biting me, digging into my flesh. I drop the stake while I’m \ntrying to fight off whatever’s swarming me. Whatever it is, I can’t lay \nhands on it - \neven as I swat at my face, I’mgetting bitten on my hands \nand mouth. \nEven in the middle of this Charlie Foxtrot, I manage to crash into \nthe monster. As I’m fumbling desperately for the other stake, he grabs \nmy tie to pull me toward him. I can see his teeth - \nall pointed, like \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\na shark’s. I try to find enough purchase to push his face away, but the \nswarm is making it tough. He yanks my head back and starts to bite \ninto my cheek - \nhe’s actually ripping the flesh out of my face, and his \nteeth are scraping the bone- \nHe shrieks and drops me. I look up through a haze of pain, and he’s \nfacing down Gina, spitting out the hunk of my cheek as he does. The \nstake I dropped earlier is buried in his left flank, the point sticking \nbloodily out of his lower ribs. Maybe we’re more fight than he planned for. \nMaybe he just wants to get away. For whatever reason, he turns and runs. \nI tell Gina to follow him, but the swarm of.. . whatever.. . makes a last pass \nat her, she trips and falls a couple times, and that’s the end of that. I hear \ntires squealing as his car peels out of the parking lot. \nI will my mangled cheek to close over so I don’t lose more blood. Gina \nreturns, picks up her flashlight, and I can see she has dozens of tiny gouges, \nlike bite-marks, all over her exposed hands and face, like me. Her hands \nare shaking and her pallor is pronounced as we turn our attention to the \nstudent. It’s hard to tell what killed her -the massive bite to the throat, \nblood loss (the ground is saturated with it), the long jagged knife-wound \ndown her torso, her missing liver ... \nThe air in the valley has definitely turned hostile. It sounds \nstrange, I know, but it’s not a friendly place to be right now. We both \nstagger up the hill to retrieve the tarp kept in the trunk for clean-ups, \nand spend a few minutes fixing the crime scene as fast as we can - \nunidentifiable lumps of flesh, blood-spattered leaves, soil that practi- \ncally screams when we step on it -always \nwithin sight of each other. \nThe paranoia and menace I felt earlier is returning with a vengeance, \nand whatever’s out there is pissed at us for disturbing what happened. \nCaine forbid this thing comes back for a doggy bag. \nAs soon as things look passable, we stow the body in the trunk and get \nthe hell out of there. * \n* \n* \n* \n* \nMy elder, Matisse, doesn’t turn around from the monitor when Gina \nand I come in, and at first, I think he didn’t hear us. His fingers are moving \na mile a minute on the keyboard, his concentration on the scrolling words. \nAfter a few moments of this, I clear my throat, and his fingers pause, \nhovering above the keyboard. He leans toward the monitor as if scrutiniz- \ning something, then says, “Ah, Nick. Is Gina with you?” \n“Yes, sir,” I reply. \nThere’s a pause, he seems to take a breath, and I know he’s adjusting \nforms. Gina’s cool with usual Nosferatu attire, but it’s still polite to put a \nface on for company. After a few moments, he turns to us, wearing his usual \nmask. Normally, Matisse isn’t one to show when he’s rattled, but I see his \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\neyes widen as he takes us in - \nbites, blood and all. In the next moment, \nhe’s all business. “Tell me everything.” \nI notice Gina’s hands starting to shake again, and decide I’d better \ndo the talking. Matisse doesn’t say a word while I tell what happened, just \nlooking at me with that long, thoughtful stare that he uses every time he \ngets secondhand info. \nI wind up by mentioning the body in the trunk and how things \ncurrently stand down at Bronger’s, and he just nods and doesn’t say \nanything. He seems to be considering the space on the floor in front of us, \npursing his lips, and the lines on his forehead getting deeper by the minute. \nYou could power a city block with the tension in this place. \nFinally, he glances up at us with hooded eyes. Maybe he thinks we’re \nbullshitting him. I feel Gina tensing beside me, and God’s truth, I am too. \nI know I wasn’t dreaming tonight; I know Gina wasn’t, and there’s a body \nin our trunk that says we weren’t. \n“So what was it?” I ask. \nThat’s when Matisse, my always-knows elder, who probably never \nadmitted he was stumped in his last life or this one, looks confused. He \nhesitates before he says: “I have no idea.” \nFor the first time that night, I’m frightened. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCREDITS \nWritten by: Kieran Dewhurst, Earle “Glas” Durboraw, Matthew Hooper, Edward \nMacGregor, Brett Smith, Cynthia Summers \nDeveloped by: Cynthia Summers \nEdited by: Richard Ruane \nPreviously published material has appeared in: Blood Magic: Secrets of \nThaumaturgy, Vampire Storytellers Handbook \nArt direction by: Aaron Voss \nArt by: Laura Robles \nFront and back cover design: Pauline Benney \nLayout and typesetting by: Pauline Benney \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nT \nPROLO~UE: \nSLO \nCHAPTER ONE: \nCHAPTER Two: \n'TS \nCHAPTER THREE: \nBLOOD \nIC \nCHAPTER EOUR: WH \nCHAPTER \n~ I V E :  S \nCHAPTER SIX: UNDE \nI \nI O  \nI4 \n42 \n76 \n116 \n158 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAre you a Storyteller? Are you an Assistant Storyteller or Nanator ? Do you entertain \nnotions of becoming a Storyteller? Well, come on in, because this book is for you! \nThis is part translation from the Vampire Storytellers Handbook, part \ncollection of things Storytellers are likely to find helpful and exciting. It’s not about \nbeing given a Bible of Storytelling Mind’s Eye Theatre or a mandate on how to \nrun your game. Think of it as a bunch of Storytellers hanging out with our feet up, \na cold one in hand (non-alcoholic, of course), talking about this thing we love and \nhate and spend so much of our free time on. \nCome in, have a seat, the soda’s in the fridge, and let’s get cozy. \n9 \nATE CRAS H E R  s \nWe’re fully aware that even now there are players picking up this book. Now \nthere is some material that they might find helpful, but it may not mean their \nintentions are altruistic. Maybe they want to try trumping the Storyteller with her \nown tools, or maybe they want to “be prepared” for the Storyteller’s next tricks. We \nplay as well as Storytell, and there’s something to be said for reading the Storyteller \nsections to figure out what’s ahead. \nThat said, trying to use what you’ve read to trump the Storyteller is frankly not \nnice. Remember way back in Laws of the Night, where we said the object of the \ngame was not winning but telling stories? That’s not the action of someone who \nwants to tell astory, but who wants to win, who wants to beat the Storyteller at her \nown game. It seems to us that all that will accomplish is spoiling potential surprises \nfor other players, and creating antagonism (or adding to it). \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSo, even if you’re bound and determined to read ahead, at least refrain from \nbeing a weasel and spoiling your fellow players’ enjoyment of the evening’s \nentertainments. If you’re bursting to tell someone about the neat things you’ve read \nand created already, tell your pets, dig a hole in the backyard and tell the worms \nor scribble it out to yourself. Let the story unfold in its own time and let the \nStoryteller do her job. \nH O W T O  USE \nTHIS \nBOOK \nAs stated earlier, this is part translation from Vampire Storytellers \nHandbook and part collection of interesting topics that a Storyteller might \nfind value in. We also included the new blood magic paths from Blood Magic: \nSecrets of Thaumaturgy. \nYou’ll find things in here you disagree with- that’s always a given. But there’s \nalso things in here that you can agree with. Hopefully there’s information in here \nthat makes you pause and reconsider your chronicle or gets you excited about a \nstory that seemed to be dying ungracefully or solves a persistent problem. \nChapter One: Introduction -The \nofficial welcome to the party. \nChapter Two: The Thousand Eyes -Here’s an introduction to some of the \nmost disturbing denizens of the World of Darkness, and their murderous ways. \nChapter Three: Blood Magic -The new blood magic paths and rituals from \nBlood Magic: Secrets of Thauamturgy. \nChapter Four: Wheels Within Wheels - \nIn this section, you’ll find the \nconspiracies to make the Freemasons look like child’s play, from the Manus Nigrurn \nto the Week of Nightmares. \nChapter Five: Storyteller Help- Did a player figure out your plot too early? \nWondering what to do with the Web? Want to try something different in your \nchronicle but don’t know where to start? Look here! \nChapter Six: Under One Dark Sky - \nWe know you’re going to do it. \nCrossovers, that is. If you’re going to do it, you might as well do it safely, and this \nchapter will help you out. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nI DON’T NEEDA \nSTORYTELLER \nC ~ U I D F !  \nSure, there are going to be some folks that say, “I’ve got my chronicle under \ncontrol, I don’t need someone else’s buttinsky advice, and everything’s cool.” \nThat’s great you’re so confident about the state of your chronicle. As we said, we’re \nnot out to tell you otherwise. But for those times when you’re not so sure, we’ll be \nhere and waiting. \nTHE \nSTORYTELLER’S \nCREED \nWe all have those nights when the thought of Storytelling makes us green \nwith fright. We don’t know why we’re putting ourselves through this torture; \nwe second-guess ourselves when we make judgment calls; we cringe at the \nthought of refereeing a fight. Consider the mission statement of Storytellers \neverywhere. Repeat this mantra when you find yourself questioning why you’re \nhauling yourself out to a game, when you need confidence to tell someone his \nrequest is (to put it politely) addled or when you just need that extra boost to \nremind yourself what it’s all about. \nTake this book and head for your favorite mirror, something that will allow \nyou to see a little more of yourself than, say, a compact. Now, look yourself in the \neye and repeat: \nI am the Storyteller. I am here to tell sm’es. \nPeople come to me to hawe a good time, and I will do my best to give it to them. \nWithout the story, there is no game. A good stov is my goal and my guide. \nI will recognize that I can’t please everyone, no matter what I do. When in doubt, \nI will be fair and balacedinmy judgments. I wdl notplay faworites or punish without cause. \nI will do what is best for the game - \nI will deny the bad charmer concept, the \nI will have the guts to do what is necessary, especdly when it’s unpleasant, be it \nI will do my best to be open to the players’ needs and understandingof their concerns. \nIf a player comes to me with u grievance, I will listen and try to help her. \nIfewer Ifindmyselfnot hawingfun, I willgive myselfabreukrather than let thegame \nI am the Storyteller. Let the story unfold. \nNow that that’s done, let’s get to work. \nI will favor the story. \nunreasonable request, whining and temper tantrums. \nmediating a dispute or banishing a disruptive player. \nor phyers suffer. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nIn this chapter are three bloodlines that have almost vanished from \nthe World of Darkness, and with very good reason. The Cainites herein \nhave bloodily carved out places for themselves, and found roosts upon \nwhich to squat (most usually consisting of a pile of elegantly butchered \ncorpses). As the opening story shows, these creatures are Tare. Even elders \nare unlikely to have heard of these vampires beyond a few stories whis- \npered in the corners at a grand conclave, or So-and-so’s sire having a \nparticular encounter back in 1547, or the like. In short, any encounters \nwith these creatures should be suitably momentuous. Because of the \nfrightful powers of their Disciplines and their “lifestyles”, these Cainites \ncan easily throw game balance out the window into heavy traffic. They are \nbest used as Storyteller characters. \nThe fact that not even elders know much about these monsters should \nput the fear of Caine in the younger generations. What Man (and \nKindred) does not know, he fears, and here are no less than three \nbloodlines that the majority of Western Kindred know nothing about. \nResist the temptation to put one of each in every city - \nthat defeats the \npurpose of their rarity. When they do appear on the screen, make their \ntime memorable, and impress on the characters that the World of Dark- \nness has some secrets not worth knowing. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBAALI \nEven monsters have their bogeymen. To their erstwhile cousins, the \nBaali are the devils under the bed. Legend claims that an Antediluvian dallied \nwith a singing slave-boy, and the youth turned against the Third Generation. \nHe wrought foul pacts with those who hid between the shadows of this world \nand the next and gathered followers from his Cainite siblings. Calling himself \nshaitan, he and his followers made war against the Second City. The Third \nGeneration ended the war with the deaths of the shaitan’s generals, routing \ntheir hordes. None knew what happened to the shaitan himself, and the names \nof what he had served were lost to the night. \nOnce thought eradicated by the Inquisition, the Baali have come into the \nawareness (and enmity) of modern Cainites and are rooted out wherever they \nare found. Faced with an infestation of Baali, Camarilla and Sabbat often set \naside personal agendas to burn the offending nest from sight. The recent \nunearthing of a Baali hive, along with the recovery of their unholy tomes, has \ncast doubt on the long-held belief of their destruction. \nNever numerous, the ranks of the Baali have dwindled even further in \nrecent nights as more and more succumb to a wasting erosion of spirit. They \nare beset on all sides by the Camarilla, Sabbat, and a host of enemies, and their \ninternal unity fractures nightly. Their havens are visible to those who know \nthe signs - \nstrange sigils in hillsides, the prevalence of places of power, \nchildren and livestock in nearby villages born deformed. Contrary to popular \nbelief, they are not the cackling, mustachioed minions of evil, but sages and \nacademics intent on the discovery of knowledge few others have the courage \nto pursue. They are evangelists, of a sort, bent on the task of bringing all to \ndestruction for the greater glory of Those-Who-Wait. \nRoleplaying Hints: While some Demons do fit the tongue-wagging, \nleather-clad devil worshipper profile, most Baali look on these as marks of \nimmaturity or, in more persistent cases, evidence of someone seriously \nmissing the point. It becomes difficult to convert the faithless if you cannot \nbe taken seriously. Seduce your prey, not with wild displays of “evil” but with \na genteel and urbane offer of enlightenment. Let them know that the truth is \ntheirs to be had, if they but ask for it. Do not force the issue. The sweetest \nconquest comes from the willingly conquered. \nAs Baali age and grow wise in the ways of their masters, they fall further \nand further from their human roots. Many older Demons develop an affecta- \ntion for vermin, keeping them as pets or companions, sometimes in vast \nhordes to rival those of the Nosferatu. Many young Demons have Humanity \n(albeit abysmally low), but fall off rapidly and take up a different path. Some \nolder Baali follow the Path of Cathari or Death and the Soul. Recently, though \nmany have taken up the Path of Evil Revelations and Power and the lnner Voice. \nThere are whispers of a Path particular to Demons, the Path of the Hive, but \nnone have dared get close enough to the Baali to know for sure. \nDisciplines: Daimoinon, Obfuscate, Presence \nAdvantage: The very existence of the Demons is bent toward the \ndiscovery of dark secrets and hidden lore. By their nature, the Baali seek out \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nforbidden knowledge and forgotten paths to power. As a result, all who come \nto the Blood gain a free Occult Ability to reflect their rigorous study of the \ndarkest roads. This focus is not exclusive to the magical world. The Baali \ntreasure all forms of learning and typically make inroads into academia and \nthe halls of mundane power as easily as in the occult world. Neonate Demons \nmay also choose one bonus trait in University or Occult Influence. \nDisadvantage: Perhaps because of the nature of their patrons, or even if \njust the lingering ghosts of human morality, the Baali are particularly affected \nby acts of faith. When confronting a mortal with True Faith, all Baali must \nrisk twice the normal number of Traits to even have a chance of succeeding. \nIf struck by a holy symbol wielded by one of True Faith, the Baali takes twice \nthe damage normally inflicted. Most cannot even handle any paraphenalia \nrelated to religion. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nN A ~ A R A J A  \nReviled for their unsavory practices by all but the most charitable of \nKindred, the Nagaraja’s ranks have eroded in these late nights to the point of \ninsignificance. Once rumored to be members of a secret cult called the Black \nHand, the bloodline is no more than a handful now. A war deep in the \nUnderworld has whittled away at their ranks until less than 20 (some sources \nsay no more than a dozen) remain. \nMost tales put their origins somewhere in the Middle East, but rumor and \ntruth are nigh indistinguishable when it comes to the Nagaraja. What is \nknown is that they are necromancers on par with (or greater) than the \nGiovanni, that their troves of blasphemous knowledge are prodigious and \nthat not only the blood of their victims is needed to sate their hunger but the \nflesh as well. Victims of their hungers are often a beacon to the Camarilla and \nSabbat, who hunt them mercilessly. \nWith their numbers shrinking nightly and their eldest destroyed, \nthere aren’t many takers who would wager on the Nagaraja’s continued \nexistence. Isolated from Kindred and kine alike by their gruesome diet, \nhunted by the ghosts they once commanded, the Flesh Eaters can do little \nbut hide and watch the world go by, eking out meager unlives before Final \nDeath comes at last. \nRumors have filtered west from Korea of an ancient court of Eastern \nvampires offering a dozen or so of the surviving Flesh Eaters sanctuary, but \npoor relations between Cathayans and Cainites have prevented confirma- \ntion. If the rumors are true, perhaps the Nagarajah are not finished, but biding \ntheir time and gaining strength. The wise Cainite rules nothing out. \nRoleplaying Hints: Yours is a solitary existence, an unlife of discipline \nand study. Those that may have once been your allies have all perished \nbeyond the Shroud. Those who were your slaves pursue you in hopes of \ntaking vengeance. You do not have the luxury of the occasional misstep. \nOnly a handful of your blood remains, and you mean to keep yours as long \nas possible. You cannot afford the extravagance of Humanity. Your very \nexistence denies it, calling out for the flesh of the kine to sate its terrible \nhunger. Immortality is precious and terrible, power its only salve. Cling to \nboth and you just might live to eat the flesh from your enemies’ bones. There \ncan be no sweeter morsel than that. \nThe peculiarities of the Nagarajah diet leave little room for maintaining \none’s Humanity. As a result most Flesh Eaters opt for the vampiric Paths of \nmorality and often choose the Path of the Bones or Death and the Soul. \nDisciplines: Auspex, Dominate, Necromancy \nAdvantage: Hunted for millenia as the most vile of monsters, the \nNagaraja have developed a knack for deception, if only for the sake of \nconcealing their studies and dietary needs. All Nagaraja receive a free \nSubterfuge Ability. In addition, their scholarly pursuits and morbid interests \nlead them to make inroads as they can in fields where such things might, at \nthe very least, be tolerated if not appreciated. Each may choose one Medicine, \nOccult or University Influence trait at no cost. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDisadvantage: Not only must a Nagaraja drink blood to maintain her \nexistence, she must also eat of her prey’s flesh. Without fresh meat, a \nNagaraja’s body wastes away. As with Blood Traits, a mortal has 10 Flesh \nTraits. Unlike blood, however, each Flesh Trait consumed by one of the \nNagaraja inflicts one health level of unsoakable lethal damage - \nthis is not \nskimming off the top, but loss of muscle tissue or organs. For every night that \na Nagaraja does not eat at least one Flesh Trait, she loses two Physical Traits \nas her body withers away. This deficit must be repaid in full before she can \nreturn to complete health. Every point of flesh consumed after such an \nepisode restores two Physical Traits, up to the character’s normal maximum. \nNagaraja do not have retractable fangs like other Kindred. Instead, their \nmouths are full of sharp teeth like a piranha’s. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTRUE \nBRUJAH \nEvery family has its secrets. The True Brujah have borne one such secret \nfor centuries. Sagacious and erudite, the Elois are the scholars the Brujah often \naspire to be, ensconced in their studies as firmly as iron rods set in stone. Sage \nphilosophers that they are, the True Brujah bear a legacy of bitterness as well. \nIt is the claim of the Elois that the founder of their blood was slain by its childe \nages ago, and that those who claim the name Brujah are no more than the bastard \nchilder of that ancient diablerist. Carthage, they say, the city so lauded and \nlamented by their cousins was, in fact, the pinnacle of their achievements, where \nthey strode godlike over the night. As timeless as the Kindred themselves, the \nElois’s resentment for their fractious kin festers into these nights. \nFor all their claims of once-shared blood, the True Brujah hold none of \ntheir cousins’ passion. Cold and imperturbable, the Elois pursue ancient lore \nand discourse with serpentlike detachment. Indeed their Blood does seem to \ndeaden the spirit as it preserves the flesh, immutable as stone. And for all their \nvaunted mastery of Temporis, time itself bears hard upon them, each descend- \ning into anachronism as the present climbs swiftly from the past, unable to \nmuster warmth enough to thaw their glacial ways. \nEvents of recent nights have struck hard again at the Elois. As with the \nNagaraja, the True Brujah found shelter and collaboration in the Black Hand \ncult. Since the destruction of that order and some of the eldest of their blood \nalong with it, the Elois have sought allies where they may, particularly with \ntheir African neighbors, the Followers of Set. Though they do not share \nphilosophies, there is some common ground between them. Each seeks \nhidden knowledge though to different ends, and in these nights, when safe \nhaven is a scarce commodity, that much is more than enough. \nRoleplaying Hints: Passion is the haven of the ignorant, emotion the \ncrutchof mediocrity. You are of the true blood and lifted far above such things. \nAll things are yours to observe and understand. Calm is the tool of the learned. \nBe calm. Disdain the ignorant and the unrestrained. Be patient and wise. \nWhen time at last runs out, you alone will remain to watch a universe die. \nMost True Brujah adhere to Humanity, though elders sometimes espouse \nthe ideals of Paths of Enlightenment unique to them alone. There are even \nthe infrequent followers of the Path of Typhon among those True Brujah who \nhave dealings with the Setites. \nDisciplines: Potence, Presence, Temporis \nAdvantage: The True Brujah are academics without peer. They typically \ndevote their long unlives to obscure and esoteric pursuits, gathering vast pools \nof knowledge over uncountable subjects. As a result, each True Brujah \nreceives one Academics Ability at no cost and may choose an additional \nAbility in any one Lore for no cost as well. \nWhile solitary by nature, the Elois do value discourse and intellectual \ndebate very highly. To this end, the clan meets twice each century to discuss \ncurrent developments and argue the finer points of philosophy. Some small \ncells continue this contact between the larger meetings and occasionally \nassist their brethren in scholastic pursuits. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n-+t \ni \ne \nDisadvantage: Even as it lends vigor to their long-dead flesh, so does the \nblood of the Elois smother their emotions. This decaying passion draws them \nfurther and further from the living world, washing away over centuries of \nstudy all semblance of human warmth. In the end, though they might debate \nthe concepts of morality in great depth, they can no longer feel what is right \nand what is wrong. Those that can take up the Paths of vampiric morality. \nThose that cannot are consumed, the vast knowledge they’ve amassed forever \nlost to the ravages of the Beast. As nights go on it grows ever more difficult \nfor the True Brujah to maintain their connection to their Humanity. Elois \nwishing to increase their Morality or Virtue traits must pay double the \nstandard experience point costs. On all Conscience and Conviction challenges, \nTrue Brujah must bid two extra Traits or automatically lose the bid. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDISCIPLINES \nDAIMOINON \nIn the blackest temples of prehistory, ancient priest-kings made sacrifice \nto their dark masters and as the sibyls spoke, their lives fleeing with their \nbreath, the arts of Daimoinon were writ on parchment of skin and bound up \nin flesh. Wielded by the faithful, passed from sire to childe, the arts of \nDaimoinon are subtle, potent and wholly evil. \nThis power retests with the Occult Ability. \nSense the Sin \nLike calls to like, and the first lesson of the Baali is to hear with the ears \nof one’s darkness. Invoking the power of their masters, the Demons may \nhear the call of the secret evils that hide in all souls: the doubts, the fears, \nthe petty envies. \nTo use Sense the Sin, the Baali must engage her target in a Mental \nChallenge, bidding Traits in accordance with the depth of knowl- \nedge sought. By risking a single Trait, the Demon may learn some \nsmall transgression or weakness: a lack of resolve (low Willpower); \ncowardice, callousness or poor control (low Virtues); or even some \nsmall personal failings (a Negative Trait). A t  two Mental Traits, the \nDemon may learn more intimate knowledge: a dangerous secret or \nundiscovered crime. With three traits, the Baali opens the door to \nher target’s soul, exposing derangements or similar flaws, past diablerie \n(though not necessarily the identity of the victim) or other deeply \nhidden sin. \nNote: Just what exactly is learned is always the decision of the Storyteller \nand should be couched in subjective terms. For example: “Anabelle is always \nthe first to run when words come to blows” rather than “Anabelle has just one \nCourage Trait.” \nBASIC DAIMOINON \nFear of the Void Below \nAt this stage, the disciple has begun to wield the power of his masters. \nWith the footholds of sin as his guide, he may invoke the horror of those \nbeyond and inflict it on his target. \nBefore invoking the Fear of the Void Below, the Demon must first \nperform Sense the Sin on his target, ferreting out what might cut a path \nto the victim’s heart. For every Trait beyond the first successfully \nrisked in Sense the Sin, the Baali gains one Trait to use to invoke the \nFear of the Void Below. (This challenge may occur at any time, up to one \nnight prior to the use of Fear of the Void Below. If the sun rises before \nFear of the Void Below is used, the Baali must start again from the \nbeginning.) When the target’s secret is known, the Demon then \nengages her in a Social Challenge, and should roleplay the verbal \nassault on her target’s hidden sin. By playing on the fear and shame of \nthe secret, explaining the unavoidable consequences of the target’s \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncrimes, the inevitable retribution to be exacted, the Baali inspires \nabject terror in his victim. For a one-Trait risk on Sense the Sin, the \ntarget stands trembling before the Baali until she ceases her verbal \nassault. If two Traits were used for Sense the Sin, the target flees as \nthough taken by Rotschreck. For three Traits, the target faints dead \naway and remains unconcious until disturbed. \nThe target may avert Fear of the Void Below with a Courage Test. \nConflagration \nAt this level of mastery, the Baali may actually call forth a \nportion of what lies Beyond, channeling some of the power of her \nmasters as an eerie flame. For the brief time it burns in this world, the \nflame may take any number of forms from a barely visible shimmer in \nthe air to a ripple of jet black fire. Conflagration’s destructive power \nis never in dispute and often reminds its viewers of traditional tales \nof the infernal. \nWith the expenditure of a Blood Trait, the Baali calls into being \na bolt of black flame which can then be hurled at her enemies as a \nPhysical Challenge. Typically, if the bolt strikes its target, it inflicts a \nsingle aggravated wound and gutters out immediately. The Baali may \nelect to maintain the flame by spending a Blood Trait each turn for as \nlong as she wishes it to remain. The target must remain in sight and the \nBaali must maintain full concentration or the flame will vanish, but for \nevery turn the Baali maintains the flame, the target suffers another \naggravated wound. \nKindred confronted with this mystical fire must make Courage tests to \nprevent Rotschreck just as if facing a normal flame of similar size. Targets may \ndodge as per any other ranged attack. \nI N T E R M E D  I ATE DAI M O  \nI N O N  \nPs ychomachia \nAfter mastering the ability to draw power from beyond, the Baali now \nlearns to shape that power into a living nightmare. Striking deep into his \nvictim’s psyche, the Demon may draw out her deepest fears and give them \nphysical form. \nAfter performing Sense the Sin on her intended target, the Baali \nspends a Willpower Trait and forces the victim to make a Virtue Test \nagainst her weakest Virtue with a difficulty equal to the number ofTraits \nthe Baali successfully risked in Sense the Sin. If the target fails, an \napparition from the darkest hours of her past (perhaps a childhood \nboogeyman or a lost lover) takes shape, visible and material to her alone. \nThe victim must immediately make a Courage Test or fall into frenzy. \nEven if she succeeds in the Courage Test, the victim must then face \nterror given flesh. Most often, this nightmare construct will have Traits \nidentical or slightly inferior to the victim herself. The final state of the \nentity is fully at the Storyteller’s discretion and all damage suffered in \nthe subsequent struggle should always be completely illusory. At worst, \nthe victim may suffer unconsciousness or a brief torpor for dying at the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n* \ni \nC \nhands of fear. For purposes of combat with the victim, the psychomachia \nshould be treated as a normal, material being. If the Baali stops concen- \ntrating, the spectre vanishes. \nADVAN \nC B  D DAI M o I N o N \nCondemnation \nSince the first of the Baali crept into the wilderness and made an \nabominable pact with forces beyond this world, their childer have forged a \nlitany of contracts and bargains with infernal powers longer than can be \ncounted in the lives of even the Methuselahs. The Baali can call upon these \nancient pacts to lay a curse on his enemies with all the power and hatred of \nthe infernal legions. \nTo invoke the curse, the Demon must first give voice to the deed, \nenunciating his condemnation in detail before engaging in a Static \nWillpower Challenge against a difficulty of the target’s Willpower traits. \nIf successful, the Baali must then sacrifice a number of permanent \nMental Traits, reducing his permanent total by that number for the \nduration of the curse. For every Trait sacrificed, the Baali may reduce \none of his victim’s Attributes, Virtues or Willpower by a single Trait to \na minimum of one. The Baali may end the curse whenever she chooses, \nalthough it is unlikely. \nAbuse of this ability may well result in the Baali herself feeling the \ncurse as Those-Who-Wait do not take lightly to the frivolous use of \ntheir gifts. \n€ L D B R  DAIMOINON \nConcordance \nThose Baali who reach this level of enlightenment all make what can \nonly be called a leap of faith. In their devotion to Those-Who-Wait- \nBeyond, they have taken into themselves something of their monstrous \npatron and are strengthened by the gift. Such boons are not without cost, \nhowever - \nlegends speak of the Baali priests as twisted monstrosities \nwithout any resemblance to humanity. \nOnce purchased, this ability grants its wielder one of the powers \noften attributed to the minions of darkness, be it flight, an unholy \nresistance to flame, or any of the dozens of infernal gifts spoken of in \nstory. Always, though, this gift comes at a price. With the gift of flight \nmight come monstrous bat wings; with immunity to flame might come \na deep bronzing of the skin. Just as varied as the powers bestowed are the \ncurses that follow them. Hooves, talons, scales or stranger features are all \nfair game when it comes to infernal investiture. In addition, this \nDiscipline may be purchased more than once, allowing for truly mon- \nstrous distortions of the Baali’s flesh. \nPlayers and Storytellers alike are encouraged to use their imagina- \ntions in developing “gifts” granted by the unholy. Take note, however: \nThe curse of Caine may never be lifted, nor alleviated, by the gifts of \ndemons. The subject may never use this Discipline to overcome the need \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nfor blood, the vulnerability to sunlight or the clan’s sensitivity to acts of \nFaith. All Boons must be approved by the Storyteller. \nMASTER DAIMOINON \nSummon the Herald of Topheth \nName them djinn or daemon, angel or efreet, the spirits of the outer \ndarkness come only to those with the strength to compel them. Those \nBaali whose faith and wisdom have progressed as far as this power may part \nthe curtain between worlds long enough to allow something of the other \nside through. \nT o  even begin this ritual, the Baali must first make a blood \nsacrifice (no less than three Traits worth) and spend one permanent \npoint of Willpower. The creature summoned will appear shortly \nafter. At the Storyteller’s discretion, a Demon who has strayed from \nhis faith may be required to engage the Herald in a Mental Test \n(retest with Occult) or become the vessel for this spirit. Regardless, \nthe spirit comes and though none will ever be identical, all are at \nleast as capable as the following statistics would indicate: Attribute \nTraits 10/7/3, six Willpower Traits, seven Ability Traits, 10 Disci- \npline Traits, no less than Intermediate Fortitude and the ability to \nregenerate at least one health level every other turn. The spirit \nremains until its task is completed or the sun rises three times, \nwhichever comes first. \nAS C E  N D A N T  DAI \nM o I N o N \nContagion \nSo powerful is the Baali’s faith at this level, she becomes a focus for \nthe divisive energies of her god, bleeding dissension and discord into the \nhearts and minds of all those in her vicinity. The mere presence of the \nDemon sends businesses spiraling into ruin, marriages dissolving in \nbitter divorce, and lifelong friendships descending into bloody hatred. \nAs hope dies, Baal grows ever stronger until entire towns fall under the \nsway of Those-Who-Wait. \nTo use this power, the Baali first spends a number of Willpower \nTraits in accordance with the breadth of the disruption he wishes to \ninstigate. With one Willpower, the Demon may affect those in her \nimmediate vicinity. Two Willpower allow him to reach a small apart- \nment complex or office building. Three traits stretches his reach over a \ncity block; four, an entire neighborhood, stadium or sports arena. With \nthe expenditure of five Willpower Traits, the Baali may touch a entire \ncity (megalopoli like New York, London or Tokyo may require six \nWillpower at Storyteller discretion). Each Willpower Trait spent takes \na full day and night to take effect. \nNext, the Baali spends Mental Traits to determine the degree of \nchaos she inflicts. Every two Traits spent in this way increases the \nintensity one step as shown on the table below. As with everything, it’s \neasier to start a fire with oil than with water. So it is with Contagion. At \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthe Storyteller’s discretion, naturally occurring aggravating factors may \nreduce the number of Traits necessary by one, or even several, steps. For \nexample, it would be far easier to incite murderous riots at the peak of \na hot spell just after a questionable police shooting than on the first \nsunny day in May. \nKindred schooled in the arts of Ausgex (Spirit’s Touch or better) may \ndetect the source of this disturbance with a successful Mental Challenge \nagainst the Baali. Any detection will be vague at best, revealing only the fact \nthat something is causing the unease in the area. \nM BTH u s E LAH DAIM \no I N O  N \nCall the Great Beast \nThis Discipline is always known to one of the children of Baal and only \none. The eldest among them, like unto a god itself, bears this gift alone, for \nit must be able to match what arrives. Never in the history of the world has \nthis power been used successfully, but many are the tales of warning that tell \nof those that tried. \nTo say the least, the ritual to invoke this power is exacting. Nothing but \nvague sketches of the requirements exist, the most illuminating tomes \nspeaking of scores of sacrifices and months of ritual - \nonly the Eldest knows \nfor certain. And should the rite stray from the prescribed path in any \nparticular, the consequences promised are dire indeed, even for one great \nenough to make the attempt. \nShould the ritual succeed, though, the final act is simple enough. The \npriest must expend the whole of her Willpower and hurl her very soul at the \nbarrier between this world and Those-Who-Wait. As her very essence is \nextinguished, her body becomes a vessel for the terror Beyond, granting what \nwas never meant for flesh a foothold on this world. Thus, they would say if any \nremained, ended the world. \nNECROMANCY \nVITREOUS \nPATH \nMore a complement to more common necromantic powers than \na power in and of itself, Vitreous Path Necromancy is practiced almost \nsolely by its Nagaraja creators. Steeped in the entropic energies of \nthe Underworld, energies even the most talented and experienced \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nnecromancers hesitate to wield, the Flesh Eaters’ were afforded \nconsiderable opportunity to study Oblivion and the power that drives \nit. The Vitreous Path is the result of their efforts, its secrets guarded \njealously, and with good reason - \nany who pursue mastery over death \nand restless souls would give near anything to acquire even the basest \nprimer of Vitreous Path lore. \nAs do most Necromancers, Nagaraja begin their studies with the \nSepulchre Path. The Vitreous Path follows soon after. Even the least \ntalented of the Flesh Eaters, armed with knowledge of the Vitreous \nPath, can be a formidable force. Indeed, this last precious lore may well \nbe the secret to the Nagaraja’s survival, if they can just keep it from the \nsort of creature that would risk a great deal to learn it, such as the \nHarbingers of Skulls. \nThis Discipline retests with the Occult Ability, although the Storyteller \nmay allow the more specialized Wraith Lore to be used instead. \nBASIC VITREOUS \nPATH \nNECROMANCY \nEyes of the Dead \nGhosts, or wraiths, are born into the Underworld with certain gifts \nstemming from the nature of their new existence. Use of Eyes of the Dead \nallows the necromancer to usurp one of these gifts, Deathsight, from a \nnearby wraith and use it herself. There must be at least one wraith in the \nvicinity as the necromancer actually sees through the wraith’s eyes for \nthe duration of this power. For the unschooled, it can be disorienting \ntrying to sort through the strange auras visible to the dead, not to \nmention the distraction of literally seeing the world from another (or \nseveral) person’s point of view. \nTo invoke Eyes of the Dead, the necromancer must spend a Mental \nTrait. She may then attempt to view her subject whether it be in the \nShadowlands or the living world. By using this power, the necromancer \nmay determine the general health of the subject, including any injuries, \nillnesses or disease. The likelihood of imminent death can be deter- \nmined, and even such things as curses and hostile enchantment may be \nP- \nI \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ndiscerned. The Storyteller may decide that particularly subtle readings \nrequire a Static Mental Challenge (retest with Occult) to decipher the \ndeath energies’ meaning. \nEyes of the Dead lasts for one scene or one hour, whichever ends \nfirst, though the necromancer may decide to return to his own percep- \ntions at any time. \nHour of Death \nAs his mastery over the energies of Oblivion increases, the necro- \nmancer gains the ability to peceive death energies in the auras of those \naround him. Like Eyes of the Dead, this power grants the necromancer use \nof the Deathsight. Unlike Eyes of the Dead, however, Hour of Death \nactually grants the user Deathsight of his own without need of borrowing \nthe eyes of a wraith. HOW of Death also allows for much greater detail in \nreadings. With it, the necromancer may determine just how far his \nsubject is from death, how soon death is likely to occur and what the \ncause of death is most likely to be. In addition, fluctuations of death \nenergies may be interpreted to reveal the subject’s feelings toward others \nwhen first meeting them. \nT o  exercise this ability, the necromancer must first spend a single \nMental Trait, empowering himself with Eyes of the Dead for one scene \nor one hour, whichever is shorter. To make a reading, the necromancer \nperforms a Static Mental Challenge against a difficulty designated by \nthe Storyteller in accordance with the depth of knowledge desired. A \none-Trait challenge might reveal the subject’s probable death within \nseveral weeks to a month. Three Traits may reveal time of death to \nwithin a few days along with impressions of the cause of death (ghostly \nwounds or withering organs), while five Traits may give the time of \ndeath to within an hour, vicinity within a few blocks, and strong \nimpressions of the cause of death. \nThis Discipline may only be used on one target at a time. Targets viewed \nbeyond the first require successive uses of the power. \nI NTE R M  E D IATE VITRE \no u s PAT \nH NECROMANCY \nSoul Judgement \nIt seems the Kindred are not the only creatures that struggle nightly with \na dark side. Wraiths, too, wrestle with the passions of a baleful reflection lying \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\njust below the surface of their psyches. Though more urbane than the \nravening Beast, a wraith‘s Shadow is no less ruthless or destructive. Knowing \nwhich persona is in command at any given time can be an invaluable boon to \na necromancer looking to strike a deal. \nBy spending a Willpower Trait and defeating the wraith in a \nMental Challenge, the necromancer may discern which personality is \nascendant at any particular moment as well as which personality \ntypically holds dominance. Wraiths controlled by their Shadows are \ncalled Spectres and are dealt with at the necromancer’s peril. Those \ndominated by their higher selves, however, are often prime pickings. \nThe wise vampire can reap great returns playing one personality \nagainst the other, taking gains from each as the Psyche is often \nunaware of the dealings of his Shadow. And while the Shadow is not \nsimilarly unaware of its Psyche’s affairs, it is often more than willing to \ncooperate to the Psyche’s detriment. \nBreath of Thanatos \nThis power marks a significant step on the road to a necromancer’s \nmastery over the energies of Oblivion. With it, the wielder may actually \nexpel entropic energies from his body in a baleful mist. This mist, \ninvisible to any not particularly attuned to entropic manifestations, acts \nas a siren call to any Spectres in the vicinity, drawing them to the \ninfected area in droves. This foul haze can be spread over an area or \nfocused into an object or person. When dispersed into the air, this foul \nmist will summon Spectres to the area, but does not offer any means to \ncontrol them when they arrive. Necromancers who instigate such a \ngathering without knowledge of other Necromancy paths sufficient to \nsway the tide do so at their own risk and are just as likely to be a target \nas anyone else in the vicinity. Objects or people infused with this power \nbear a lingering malaise of the spirit and inspire unease in those not \naccustomed to the touch of death. \nThe necromancer need only spend one Blood Trait, one Will- \npower Trait and succeed in a Simple Test to manifest the Breath of \nThanatos. If dispersed over an area for the purposes of summoning \nSpectres, the radius covered is one-quarter mile plus one-quarter \nmile for each additional Blood Trait spent and is always centered on \nthe necromancer. Again, the mist grants the user no authority over \nthose who respond; other powers must be used to gain control of the \napproaching spirits. In any case, the cloud of fog lasts for no more \nthan a scene. If concentrated in an item or person, the wielder must \ntouch the target or, if used at range, defeat her in a Physical Chal- \nlenge (retest with Occult). If the necromancer is successful, the target \nsuffers a single aggravated wound - \noften manifesting as disease, \ndecay or rot - \nas she is infused with the death fog and filled with \nentropic energies. The infusion will persist until sunrise or sunset, \nwhichever comes first. For the duration of the infection, the victim \nwill be two Traits down on all social interactions with those unfamil- \niar with the touch of death - \nwerewolves, faeries, certain mages and \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmost normal humans. In addition, to those with senses tuned to \ndetect such things, the victim will appear as tainted by the entropic \nenergies that fill her. Most will mark the victim as a threat, and some \n(werewolves in particular) will regard her as worthy of immediate \nattack. Those already infected with the Breath of Thanatos cannot be \ninfected a second time until the first has worn off. \nFailure in the Simple Test means the necromancer has failed to \nexpel the negative energies, instead incorporating them into his own \nbody. After the first failure, certain minor nuisances are his to endure \n- \nthe attentions of a particularly mischievous Spectre or a short- \nlived Aura of Corruption as per the Flaw. Subsequent, consecutive \nfailures will inflict effects equivalent to those he sought to turn on \nhis victim in all particulars, each successive failure increasing the \neffects’ intensity. \nSoul Feasting \nADVANCED \nVITREOUS \nPATH \nNECROMANCY \nAt this level, the necromancer has gained as comprehensive a \nmastery over the energy of Oblivion as anything not truly of the Under- \nworld can. Now her power has grown to such heights that she can actually \nuse the essence of the Dead to power her gifts. Whether absorbing power \nfrom a locale rich in such energies or feeding directly from the dead, the \nnecromancer may convert the essence of Oblivion into a crude fuel, if not \nactual sustenance. \nOnly places recently touched by death hold sufficient energy to be \nharvested using this Discipline. Whether the site of a recent murder or \nan ancient burial ground with generations of the dead buried within it, \nthe place must have been touched by death recently or in such volume \nas to leave a retrievable surplus. Depending on the source, a vampire \nmay draw the equivalent of one to four Blood Traits of energy, as \ndetermined by the Storyteller, in a single night. Doing so eliminates all \nbenefits that might otherwise apply to the use of Necromancy or ghostly \nabilities in such a place as the energy that facilitates such things is \nconsumed. In the case of cemeteries and the like, these energies will \nreplenish themselves within a few days. For the scene of a murder or a \nfatal accident, however, it may well take another death before more \nenergy can be harvested in that place. \nA vampire with knowledge of this Discipline is not restricted to \ngathering ambient energy alone, though. She may also feed directly \nfrom wraiths, robbing the hapless ghosts of their vital essence to fuel \nher vampiric powers. To do so, the necromancer must attack the wraith \nas though she were feeding normally. Upon doing so, the vampire \nenters a sort of half-state wherein she inhabits both the Underworld \nand the lands of the living. During this time, the vampire is vulnerable \nto any of a wraith’s attacks, even those that would not normally affect \nthe material world. The wraith must defeat her assailant in a Will- \npower Challenge before attempting any action and is considered \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nimmobilized and unable to escape until doing so. Wraiths all have the \nequivalent of 10 Blood Traits in an “Entropy” pool. Each Entropy Trait \ndrained renders the wraith less and less substantial until it finally \ndissolves into nothing as the last shred of its spirit is drained away. This \npower may be used in conjunction with Ash Path Necromancy, allowing \nthe vampire to gain power (though not sustenance) from wraiths as she \ntravels the Shadowlands. \nWraiths drained in this way are completely destroyed. They do not fall \ninto the Labyrinth or suffer a Harrowing. They are utterly and irrevocably \ndestroyed. Energy gained in this fashion can be used only to fuel Disciplines. \nIt is ineffective for any physical task in which Blood Traits are normally spent, \nsuch as healing or increasing Attributes. \nAt the Storyteller’s discretion, subsequent and consecutive failures in \nimplementing this Discipline may result in the vampire becoming trapped \nbetween the two worlds for a short time, thus being vulnerable to attack from \neither side for the duration of her entanglement. \nTEMPORIS \nOnce touted as certain proof of the True Brujah’s claim to sole \ndescent from the legitimate founder of their clan, Temporis has become \nin these late nights less a badge of honor and more the last bastion of \nsurvival for the true blood of Brujah. As with their former allies and \nassociates the Nagaraja, many Elois were destroyed as Enoch fell and \nwith them the greatest of those ever to wield Temporis. Of the handful \nthat remain, only a fraction know more than a smattering of the \nDiscipline. The highest arts may well be lost forever with the passing of \ntheir eldest, and what is left is hardly better than folklore and rumor. \nEven the imperturbable Elois are stirred to rage at the slightest whisper \nthat one not of the blood seeks the secret of Temporis. They do not part \nwith it - \nthey must not, they will not. Those that claim to have stolen \nthe secret rarely live long enough to enjoy it as the cold vengeance of a \ndesperate bloodline is borne out against them with cruel expedience. To \nthe Elois, it’s academic. No better way, they say, to make an enemy than \nto put a knife in the hands of a friend. \nAt the moment of the Embrace, all of Caine’s childer are frozen in time, \ntheir flesh made immutable and unchanging, their bodies suspended pre- \ncariously on the cusp of life and death. It is this selective stasis that is the \nsource of all the power of Tempon’s. Even the most trivial exercise in power \nis like doing a soft-shoe on the brink of oblivion. Each time she wields \nTemporis, an Elois takes her immortality in her hands. Failure in the use of \nany Temporis power from the Advanced level on up inflicts an aggravated \nwound for each consecutive failure after the first. This count resets as soon \nas the vampire succeeds in one use of Temporis, allowing her two failures \nbefore taking damage again. If the sun rises before she succeeds in using \nTemporis, the count is also reset. \nBecause of the nature of Temporis (each use is like stopping your own \nheart so you can use the electricity to jump-start your car) and because \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nFortitude is just another extension of the very same power, wounds \ngained from one cannot be resisted or reduced by the other. Powers that \nreduce wound penalties after the wound has been inflicted (Endurance, \nfor instance) however, are still effective. Thus, Resilience and Resistance \nare ineffective against wounds garnered due to Temporis failures. In the \ncase of Aegis, if the killing wound is caused by a Temporis failure AND \nit is the only wound taken in the round, Aegis cannot be used to negate \nthe damage and the character dies. If wounds other than those gained \nfrom Temporis failures are taken in the same round before death, Aegis can \nbe used to negate all damage other than that gained from Temporis \nthereby letting the vampire live to fight again (at least for another \nround, anyway). \nBy its very nature, the use of Temporis is profoundly linked to the \nhardiness of the wielder. For that reason, all Traits bid in challenges to \ninvoke the powers of Temporis must be Stamina-related. In rare cases, the \nStoryteller may allow the use of non-Stamina-related Traits, but this is \nnot suggested. In the case of over-bidding, only the total of the wielder’s \nStamina Traits may be bid except in those rare cases mentioned above, at \nthe Storyteller’s discretion. \nThis power retests using the Occult Ability. \nB A S I C  TEMPORIS \nTime Attunement \nThe first step toward controlling time is learning to perceive it. \nIf time is a river, Time Attunement is the equivalent of putting a hand \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nin the water. In addition to granting an extremely accurate time \nsense (allowing him to keep track of the exact time before the next \nsunset, down to the second, among other things), this level of \nTemporis also gifts the vampire with a unique sensitivity to distur- \nbances in the flow of time around him. Whether caused by another of \nthe Elois, a mortal magician or something even less common, the \nvampire may sense the disturbance by succeeding in a Simple Test. \nThe range of this sensitivity is wholly dependent on the intensity of \nthe disturbance - minor powers (Basic and Intermediate) can be \nsensed up to a mile away. Advanced and Master-level powers can be \nperceived from as far as 10 miles away, and use of even more potent \nabilities can be detected from a hundred to as far as a thousand miles \naway. Also, any attempt to alter the vampire’s internal clock must \nfirst succeed in a Static Mental Challenge at a difficulty of the \ntarget’s level of Temporis, in Traits. (This is only true of powers \nintended to change the character’s perception of time. Abilities that \nspeed or slow the character’s body through time affect the character \nas it would any other.) \nTime Attunement also allows its practitioners to detect Celerity \nwhen used in their immediate vicinity. By succeeding in a Static \nMental Challenge with a difficulty equal to seven minus the level of \nthe power being detected, the character may sense the use of Celerity \nin the round it’s activated up to 10 yards for each level of Temporis the \ncharacter possesses. \nTime Attunement is always in effect. Characters possessing it can always \ntell the exact amount of time that has passed between two events, to the \nsecond. When given an amount of time, a practitioner of Temporis can count \nit down as precisely as any clock known to man. Those using Time Attunement \ncan always tell the hour exactly, night or day. \nInternal Recursion \nWith a deft flex of his temporal power, the vampire who’s \nmastered Internal Recursion can knit his victim into a loop of time, \nforcing the target to relive some small, simple segment of life over \nand over again. Only the victim’s mind is actually affected, body and \nsurroundings chug on through normal time immobilized for lack of \nintelligent motivation. \nTo initiate the Internal Recursion, the vampire spends a Blood \nPoint and engages the target in a Social Challenge. If successful, the \ntarget’s mind is trapped in a looping replay of some harmless, common- \nplace event. Unless the wielder is capable of invasive psychic probing, \nthe event to be replayed must have been physically witnessed by the \nwielder (and likely will have occurred only shortly before the power \nwas activated). As described above, the event to be relived must be \nrelatively uneventful or commonplace and must require no interaction \non the part of the victim. Thus, a patrol of familiar, empty corridors \nwould be a viable subject for replay while a conversation (no matter \nhow banal or boring) would not. Some of the less humane members of \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthe Kindred population may be tempted to inflict painful or horrific \nrecursions on unwitting victims. This simply will not work as the \nemotional placidity required of the event and target is destroyed by the \nintensity of such a situation. \nOnce snared in the Internal Recursion, the victim remains motion- \nless and insensible for one minute. Each Blood Trait spent by the \nwielder after the first will extend this duration by 10 minutes. The \nvictim will be totally unaware of his surroundings and incapable of \ntaking action for the full duration unless disturbed in some way. \nAnything causing loss of health levels, even if the victim feels no pain, \nwill end the recursion and bring him to his senses. Quiet speech will \nnot rouse the target, but a shout or gunshot, or even a gentle nudge, \nwill break the trance. \nI N T E R M E D I AT E TE \nM p o R I s \nLapse \nA t  this level, the vampire’s mastery over time has progressed far \nenough that she may physically alter a subject’s passage through \ntime, slowing her target’s progress by half for a brief moment. Just the \nfeeling of being afflicted by this power can be unsettling to fragile \nminds as the world rushes past at twice speed, leaving the victim \nstraining to keep up. \nTo invoke Lapse, the vampire first spends two Blood Traits and \nengages in a Static Physical Challenge with a difficulty equal to the \ntarget’s Willpower. Each trait successfully risked in this challenge \nenforces Lapse for one round in combat. In non-combat situations, \nthe duration is one minute per Trait successfully risked. Successive \nuses of Lapse are cumulative and extend the duration of the effect \nappropriately. Lapse takes effect in the round immediately following \nsuccessful application. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThose under the sway of Lapse must bid twice the usual Traits in any \nchallenge involving speed of motion or thought. Thus, a Lapsed character \nmust bid at least two Traits to hit an opponent in combat, though a Physical \nChallenge made to lift a heavy object would be unaffected. Challenges \nintended to reflect quick thinking (as determined by the Storyteller) are \nsimilarly affected. \nCharacters using Celerity for additional actions may sacrifice one \nhalf of their actions (round down) to eliminate the penalty for all \nremaining actions. Thus, a character with five total actions in a turn \nmay sacrifice two of those actions to eliminate the penalty in the \nremaining three or take five actions and bid at least twice the usual \nnumber of Traits for each. \nThis power in no way affects the damage inflicted by attacks. Bullets and \narrows, though slowed, retain the full force of their impact. \nSubjective Suspension \nAt this stage in her development, the vampire may actually \nremove inanimate objects from the flow of time, suspending them for \na little while as the rest of the world is carried past in the current. As \nwith Lapse, the benefits of this power are not restricted to combat \nalone. Subjective suspension could be used to halt a falling object in \nits descent, suspend a sudden conflagration long enough for a hasty \nescape, or preserve a fragile artifact from decay. When Subjective \nSuspension is activated, all processes, whether mechanical, electrical \nor chemical, are frozen for the duration of the effect. Bullets hang \nmotionless in mid-air; fires appear as no more than charred logs, falling \nobjects freeze in mid-tumble. \nTo invoke Subjective Suspension, the vampire must first be able to \nperceive it. In most cases this is automatic, with particularly difficult \nobservations requiring a Static Mental Test at a difficulty determined by \nthe Storyteller. For objects moving too quickly to be seen by mortal eyes, \nsome means of enhancing the senses beyond mortal means is necessary. \nMost often, the Auspex power of Heightened Senses is sufficient, though \nthe Storyteller may still require a successful Mental challenge to make \nbest use of the power. Once the object is perceived, the vampire must \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nspend two Blood Traits and succeed in a Static Physical Challenge \n(retest with Occult). Each Physical Trait spent increases the duration of \nthe Suspension as indicated on the table below. Suspension of an object \nincludes the suspension of all its energy and any chemical processes \noccurring within it. Thus, a suspended bullet has no kinetic energy with \nregards to the world around it, chemical reactions are held in stasis, and \nfires cease to emit heat, light or smoke until such time as the power’s \nduration expires. At the end of Subjective Suspension’s duration, all \nprocesses, energies and reactions resume activity as though no time had \npassed. Fires roar to life, chemical reactions run their course, and objects \nin motion continue on their original trajectory at the speed they had \noriginally been traveling. \nSubjective Suspension may never be used on an object larger than the \nvampire herself and cannot be used to suspend living or unliving thing more \ncomplex than a dog. \nA D v A N c E D TE \nM p o R I s \nClotho’s Gift \nBy speeding the flow of time through himself, the vampire gains \nthe ability to perform acts of speed normally reserved to uses of \nCelerity. Unlike Celerity, Clotho’s Gift does not simply enhance the \nuser’s physical speed and reactions but accelerates him through time, \nthus allowing the use of Disciplines normally requiring full conscious \nthought to invoke. There is a price to pay, however, as using vampiric \npowers while Clotho’s Gift is in effect taxes the force that maintains \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthe vampire’s immortality to its limits and beyond. Vampires choos- \ning to exercise other Disciplines while under the influence of this \npower find their bodies withering with the strain as the force that \nmaintains them is consumed by their exertions. True Brujah tell their \nchilder horror stories of unwise vampires made ash-heaps by acceler- \nated use of Dominate. \nTo use Clotho’s Gift, the vampire spends three Blood Traits and must \nsucceed in a Static Physical Challenge (retest with Occult). For a \nnumber of turns equal to his levels in Temporis divided by two (round \ndown), the vampire gains one extra action for each trait successfully \nrisked in the Physical Challenge. These actions may be used in any way \nthe player wishes, including the use of Disciplines normally forbidden \nfrom multiple uses per turn (Dominate and Thaumaturgy, for instance). \nAs said before, however, there is a price. Each use of a Discipline within \nthe duration of Clotho’s Gift inflicts one health level of unsoakable \nlethal damage on the vampire. \nUses of accelerated powers occur at normal speed, relative to the victim. \nVictims of Dominate hear commands as if spoken at normal speed and \nTemporis in no way eliminates the need for eye contact. \nUse of lesser Temporis powers is also permitted under the same \nstrictures as those of other Disciplines as listed above. Greater powers \n(Elder-level and greater), however, cause the immediate destruction of \nthe vampire using them. Similarly, any vampire attempting multiple use \nof Clotho’s Gift immediately collapses in a pile of ash, the force of his \nunlife instantly dispersed. \nE L D E R  \nTEMPORIS \nKiss of Lachesis \nAt this stage, the vampire may affect the toll of time on physical \nobjects and individuals. Through his mastery of Temporis, the vampire \nmay age a subject decades in a few scarce moments. With some greater \nsacrifice, the vampire may draw out the effects of time from another into \nhimself, thus reducing the subject’s physical age. This power does not \nchange anything that has gone before. The subject’s experiences and \nmemories remain the same, only the effects of time on her physical form \nare affected. \nTo age a target, the vampire must concentrate and touch his \ntarget, spending two Blood Traits and engaging the subject in a \nchallenge using the wielder’s Social Traits versus the victim’s \nPhysical Traits (retest with Occult). Each Trait successfully risked \nmoves the result one step down on the chart below. The chart does \nnot dictate absolute results, but rather sets an upper limit for the use \nof the power. The user of Kiss of Lachesis may age the target a \nnumber of years up to and including that listed as his result, though \nis not forced to do so. The actual effects of this aging are left to the \nStoryteller, but there are very few mortals who could last very long \nin a body over a century old. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe system is identical for purposes of reducing the age of one’s \ntarget, but the wielder must spend a Physical Trait, in addition to \nrisking the appropriate number of traits to achieve the desired \neffect. Also, for each Trait risked, the vampire suffers one lethal \nwound level. These wounds can be healed normally, but may not be \nresisted, transferred or removed in any other way. Again, the effect \nlevel indicated on the table is an upper limit, not an absolute result. \nThe vampire may choose not to enforce the full potential of his \npower and reduce the total effect by any amount he wishes. This \npower may not regress any victim past the point at which it assumed \nits current form. Adult humans may not be regressed past the point \nof full maturity; mortals that have not yet reached maturity may not \nbe regressed past the point of birth. Inanimate objects may not be \nregressed past the point of construction. A Kindred’s lowest regres- \nsion is his Embrace. \nChanges in age affect only the physical form - \nmystical properties \nand mental faculties are not affected. Thus, while an elder vampire’s \nbody may be returned to a neonate’s age, she does not lose the benefit \nof her centuries of immortality -- all Disciplines, Attributes and \nAbilities remain the same. Aging the same vampire will, again, not \nchange those capabilities built up through experience, but any signs of \ndiablerie may fade and the dietary peculiarities of extreme age may \nbegin to show themselves. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nM A S T E R  TEMponrs \nHall of Hades’ Court \nWith this degree of mastery, the vampire’s powers have grown so great \nthat she is no longer restricted to affecting a single creature or object. \nWith the use of Hall of Hades’ Court, the wielder may speed or slow the \nflow of time through an enclosed area and all those within it. Usually this \nis used for social or defensive purposes, though not exclusively. The \nvampire may, at her discretion, stretch time so that what passes as one \nnight outside the affected area seems like days within it. Or, she may \ncompress time in an area, spending a few drowsy moments in her haven \nwhile an entire day races by outside. \nThe player must spend a single BloodTrait per hour of normal time that \nthis power will affect. She must then succeed in a Static Physical Challenge \n(retest with Occult). For each Trait successfully risked in this challenge, the \nvampire may move her effect level one step down on the table below. Hall \nof Hades’ Court affects the environs and occupants of a single enclosed \nstructure no larger than a high school gymnasium. \nAS \nc s N D A N T Ts M p o R I s \nClio’s Kiss \nThose who reach this level of mastery may actually summon history \nforward to the present night and in some cases bring people or objects \npermanently into the present. Those True Brujah who have reached this \nheight often use Clio’s Kiss to bring past events of the past forward so they \nmight be studied “as-they-happened.” Others summon aid or long-lost \nartifacts. No less than four attempts to summon Brujah himself have been \nmade, each ending in horrifying failure. None have ever attempted to \nsummon Caine with Clio’s Kiss. Perhaps it’s a testament to the wisdom of the \nTrue Brujah that none have ever tried. \nTo invoke Clio’s Kiss, the vampire must first spend one-half \ncurrent blood traits, rounded up, and succeed in a Static Physical \nChallenge, bidding at least two Traits. The number of Traits success- \nfully risked determines how far into the past the vampire may reach, as \nshown on the table. \nSuccessful use of Clio’s Kiss summons the desired scene to the \npresent, replacing the existing “real” situation and environment. All \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n4 \nindividuals in the area of effect - \nany room as large or smaller than a \nballroom or an outdoor area of similar size as determined by the \nStoryteller - \nare affected. Only the wielder may choose to interact \nwith the scene; all others are relegated to insubstantial observation \nunless they possess Time Attunement. They may, however, affect each \nother normally. \nA vampire using Clio’s Kiss to permanently summon an item or \nperson from the past must spend one permanent Willpower Trait. The \ncurrent use of Clio’s Kiss ends and leaves the summoned person or item \nin the present. Persons so summoned are undoubtedly disoriented, \nconfused and will require considerable explanation and education in \nthe nights to come. \nUses of Clio’s Kiss may never alter history in any meaningful way. \nIndividuals or items whose disappearance would change the course of \nhistory simply cannot be summoned as the tremendous inertia of time \nis just too great for any vampire to overcome. Only those individuals \nwhose footprint on the past is so slight that their presence will not be \nmissed can be summoned permanently. As well, the actions of the \nvampire on a scene summoned from the past will be immediately \nundone when use of this power ends. The course of history is imper- \nturbable - \nwhat has already been written must remain so. At all \ntimes, the Storyteller has the final word on what is and is not possible \nwith this power. In general, no change may be made that would affect \nthe course of recorded or remembered history or the present. It is \npossible to summon a historically significant person or object after \nthe notable portion of their existence has passed, but only if it is \ncalled to the present from a time after any event that might be \nremembered in the present. For example, summoning a book that is \nbelieved to have been destroyed is allowable, provided it is summoned \nfrom a time after it was last read. If evidence of its destruction exists, \nhowever, it cannot be summoned. Thus, Adolph Hitler could not be \nsummoned from the past, nor could the Titanic (though one of the \ncrew may be summoned if no one actually witnessed his death). Also, \na vampire may never summon the previous form of a currently \nexisting item or individual. \nMETHUSELAH \nTEMPORIS \nTangle Atropos’ Hand \nA t  this level of mastery, the vampire may unravel the recent \ncourse of time to undo her own mistakes or preventing the actions \nof others. The elder attempting such a thing pays a high price, \nliterally burning away the energies that sustain her to reverse the \nflow of time. The vampire must take different direction from her \npast course of action or watch the previous events unfold all over \nagain. If she repeats her actions, so will all those affected by the \npower with exactly the same results. The vampire must actively \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nchange the course of events or the use of this power will be wasted \nin replaying precisely what went o n  before. None of those affected \nby this power, except the wielder, will remember any course of \naction other than the final one. The memories of the subjects are \nreset just as time is. \nTo Tangle Atropos’ Hand, the vampire must spend a permanent \nWillpower Trait, three Blood Traits, and succeed in a Static Physical \nChallenge. For each Trait successfully risked in the test, the vampire may \nrewind one turn’s worth of time. For each turn so rewound, the vampire \nsuffers one aggravated health level of damage. This power may be used \nonly once per scene and only affects events taking place within the user’s \nline of sight. \nIf successful, the character remains where she is and does not return \nto her previous position (unless she chooses to do so). She has full \nrecollection of the previous course of events as do any others in the area \nof effect who possess Time Attunement or similar aptitudes; all others lose \nall memory of those actions undone by this power. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThaumaturgy, though considered to be a Discipline for game pur- \nposes, is not a true gift of Caine (after all, the Usurpers aren’t actually \ndescended from the First). While most Thaumaturgy has its basis in the \nproperties of Cainite vitae, it also has elements of what the mages call \n“static magic”: magic performed through tried and tested occult experi- \nmentation wherein the results are the same every time. In game terms, \nall non-Necromantic vampiric magic is called “Thaumaturgy,” though \nindividual paths vary dramatically. \nThaumaturgy involves two main elements: paths and rituals. Paths are \nsimilar to Disciplines - \nthey have the same number of individual powers \n- \nexcept that they may be designed to achieve nearly any end while true \nDisciplines are immutable. Some paths (like those listed in Laws Of The \nNight) are so effective or traditional that they have fallen into common \nusage, but many, many more paths exist. A Tremere who creates a path that \neventually becomes standard curriculum in other chantries is a proud \nWarlock indeed, and many elder Tremere owe their fame and station to the \ncreation of powerful and innovative paths. Rituals are more of a one-shot \neffect and often require odd or expensive material components; thaumaturges \nfavor them when creating an entire path would be too time-consuming or \nwasteful. Thaumaturges may also create their own rituals -a \nprocess \nexplained more clearly in the “Rituals” section of this chapter. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWhile Clan Tremere is the best-known font of blood wizardry, other \nclans have managed to learn unique forms of Thaumaturgy, notably the \nAssamites, Tzimisce and Setites. Their paths are much different from the \nHermetic style of the Warlocks and rely on different skills to power them. The \nAssamite wizards gain their abilities through the haze of powerful narcotics; \nthe koIdunic sorceries of the original Tzimisce, now pursued by fledgling \nSabbat eager for power, are fueled by the thaumaturge’s will and knowledge \nalone; and the Setites often use the act of corruption to further their magic. \nThe translation of these paths into a liveeaction setting is discussed in \n“Creating Non-Tremere Paths.” \nAs a Storyteller, you have final say over what you will or won’t allow \ninto your game. Thaumaturgy can be a wonderful spice to add to your \nchronicle’s menu - \nthe long searches for rare components or forgotten \ntomes, the successful completion of a ritual that took years to write - \nbut it can also make those characters too powerful to interact with other \nCainites. You can always give the players more bells and whistles later, \nbut once you’ve introduced something it’s extremely difficult, if not \nimpossible, to take it away without engendering player resentment. \nBefore handing things over on a silver platter, consider the impact it will \nhave on your game; “I Win” doesn’t reflect the spirit of the game you’ve \nworked so hard for. \nC R E A T I N ~  \nTRBMBRB \nPATHS \nA Tremere who wishes to create her own thaumaturgical path should \nhave at least five levels of the Occult Ability and have previously mastered \ntwo standard paths. Once she is properly “grounded,” player and Storyteller \nneed to sit down and discuss what she has in mind. Could it be accomplished \nmore effectively through ritual magic? Is there a single thread tying all five \npowers together? Paths revolve around a central focus or theme, and that \nfocus should be maintained throughout: It might be easy to come up with \nfive completely unrelated powers, but they certainly won’t reflect the \nstructure necessary to a proper path. \nOne way to plan the power curve of a path is to first determine the \nmaximum power you’re going to allow. This gives you a point to work down \nfrom as opposed to starting big and getting bigger. Once you both have \nagreed upon the Advanced power of the proposed path, you can then \ndecide what the first Basic power should be. With the weakest and \nstrongest powers already decided, it’s much easier to fill in the blanks with \nlevel-appropriate effects. Storytellers should squash “instant-kill” or “blow- \nup-the-world” powers and encourage those players who are aiming for \ngame flavor over game power. Also, paths created to mimic a true \nDiscipline should function as if they are at least one level below the \nequivalent of the real thing, and never rival the Advanced power: Paths \nare good, but nothing beats the original gifts of Caine. \nPaths should take a ridiculous amount of time to create and learn. A \ncharacter might work on a path for at least six months before she is “in tune” \nwith her vitae enough to learn the first power. Such work should include \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ninvesting vitae, possibly as much as three Blood Traits per level. After all, this \nis about releasing new properties of the blood. Created paths are one point \nabove the usual expense for Thaumaturgy purchases. \nC R E A T I N ~  \nNON-TREMBRE \nPATHS \nTremere and Giovanni don’t have the monopoly on vampiric magic in \nthe World of Darkness. From their rotting mansions, the Fiends’ kolduns call \nupon the elements to obey their will; in the dark chambers of Mount Alamut, \nthe viziers of the Assamite clan weave smoky, kalif-induced enchantments; \nthe Followers of Set perform grotesque rituals of defilement in their attempt \nto wake their god. Eventually, as a Storyteller, you may wish to incorporate \nother magical systems into your game. \nThe koldunic sorcery of the Tzimisce is an ancient, mystical art that \ncalls forth the elements of nature to take shape and obey the koldun’s \nwill. The specific paths, or “Ways” of this spiritual magic - \nEarth, \nWind, Fire, Water and Spirit - \nwere originally taught by elder Tzimisce \ncorresponding to the novice’s regional surroundings (for example, the \nWay of Wind was originally only known to koldun who lived in the \nCarpathian Mountains, the Way of Water to those who made their \nhavens near bodies of water, and so on); tonight, however, young Sabbat \nwho have heard rumors of these enchantments are thirsting for a taste \nof the eldritch power. \nUsing glyphs, herbal mixtures and the powerful sympathetic connections \nhoused in canopic jars (ornate clay vessels used to contain the organs of \nmummies), the Followers of Set usurp the power of the fertile Western Lands \nand bend it to their twisted desires. Despite the clan’s chaotic reputation, \nSetite paths are remarkably precise and deliberate in their practice. Some \nfocus on the exaggeration of vices already present in their victims; others \ninvolve the creation of cursed amulets which blind their bearers to anything \ngood or pure, making even the most wholesome influence seem hideous and \nbarren. They also employ a number of rituals to invoke their god, using the \nancient Egyptian magic of aeons past to give their more mundane pursuits a \nsilent and insistent partner. \nUnlike their martial brethren, Assamite viziers regard themselves as \nabove the struggles to maintain a single ethnic purity. Combining the \nmagical traditions of several groups of regional sorcerers, these wizards \nwork their magic through ritual intoxication, often maintaining a “herd” \nof perpetually drugged servants to feed from. Kulif (hashish watered in \nblood) provides revelations beyond human imagination, gifting the “field” \nAssamites with powerful protections or advantages even when they are \nnot in the presence of the vizier. Perhaps these wizards’ most awesome \nblessing is the ability to transcend the boundaries of space, their rituals \nenabling them to make their voices heard across thousands of miles or to \ntransport objects across a distance instantly. \nBlood Magic: Secrets of Thaumaturgy offers an in-depth look into \nthe other magics of Vampire: The Masquerade. As a Storyteller, it’s your \nprivilege to decide which paths will work in your game and which won’t \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nand alter and adapt them as you desire. So long as overall game balance is \nkept firmly in mind, players can expand their characters’ range without \nbecoming bloated powerhouses. The guidelines listed in “Creating Tremere \nPaths” can be used when considering the impact alternate paths will have \non your game and help you balance the relative power levels. While the \nalternate paths may go by other names, for game purposes it’s easier just \nto call them Thaumaturgy. \nTREMERB \nPATHS \nPerhaps the most disputed power in all of Vampire: The Masquer- \nade, Thaumaturgy makes the Warlocks both mighty and mistrusted as \n(given enough time) Clan Tremere can accomplish just about anything. \nThis kind of power has its price, however. It’s worth noting that while \nmany consider the Tremere advantage unbalancing in a live-action \ngame, the magnitude of their influence is, and must be, balanced by the \nrigidity of their hierarchy and the vigilance with which they guard their \nsecrets. Before you instantly outlaw certain paths or rituals because you \nfeel they are overpowered, it’s useful to consider how you can make the \nconsequences of abusing their advantage too high a price for the \nWarlock to pay. Remember, the Tremere guard their secrets jealously \nand do not take kindly to their members “showing off” - \nsuch frivolous \nor ostentatious use results in too much attention for the Warlocks’ taste, \nand Tremere who flaunt their gifts are always stifled quickly (and \nforcibly) by their superiors. Treat Thaumaturgy as you would a powerful \nbut fickle firearm: If you use it too many times in the wrong way, you just \nmight blow your own head off. \nMany of the paths listed here are extremely rare, some of them \nunknown to all but the most elder or worldly Warlock. A first-circle \napprentice who demands to know Biothaumaturgy can legitimately be \ngiggled at; a fourth-circle regent who meets a thyrsus, on the other hand, \nmight be given the opportunity to learn The Vine of Dionysus. Storytellers \nshould use common sense when determining if a character may know \nabout and learn any of the following paths. Also note that inquiring about \na few of these paths (such as Path of the Blood’s Curse) will raise a few stern \neyebrows among the higher-ups; they might even feel it necessary to pay \nthe curious Warlock a visit to ensure that their colleague isn’t entertain- \ning any “ideas”. . . . \nUnless otherwise noted, powers require a Blood Trait to activate and a \nfull action to use. \nTo T O U C H O R  \nNOT To T O U C H ?  \nAs outlined in “The Rules Thou Shalt Never Break,” players are \nnot permitted to touch one another in the course of roleplaying. \nHowever, some powers of Thaumaturgy require nothing but a light \ntouch to enact. It can be difficult, as a Storyteller, to find the right \nbalance between player comfort and character realism, especially \nwhen sometimes it could be just as simple as a character accepting a \nhandshake from the thaumaturge. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTremere have their reputation for being sneaky bastards for a \nreason, and taking away a goodly portion of their thaumaturgical \nadvantage isn’t necessary. A good rule of thumb in dealing with this \nsticky situation is that the character must willingly have accepted \nthe thaumaturge’s touch. A player who hides behind a corner and \npounces on other players as they walk by not only looks ridiculous but \nis also breaking the rules; on the other hand, a player who extends her \nhand and beams a disarming smile is not. Socially Challenging \nsomeone into a passionate embrace is acceptable (after all, one of the \ngreatest betrayals was enacted with a simple kiss). A player who \nrefuses to accept any challenge out of fear of Thaumaturgy is \nmetagaming. Encourage your thaumaturges to be creative in their in- \ncharacter touching and don’t hesitate to require a proper Physical \nChallenge if you are in doubt. \nPowers that work by touch require skin contact. \nALCHEMY \nA seminal path, Alchemy has its basis in the Hermetic practices of \nthe earliest Tremere and is mostly overlooked by thaumaturges of the \n20th century. With tonight’s technology at their disposal, many Tremere \ndisdain this path as inefficient and outmoded; however, a handful of \nelders still teach this path as a reminder of the principles modern blood \nmagic is built on. \nAlchemy deals with Hermetic “ideals,” not realistic interpretations \nof such, so while it is possible for a thaumaturge to turn lead into gold, \nshe cannot turn lead blocks into a pile of gold coins or melt the \nresulting gold down to make something else; all the thaumaturge can \ndo is work with raw elements in their “natural” states. Anyone at- \ntempting to use Alchemy must first have detailed knowledge of the \nelements involved (requiring at least two levels of Science or Science: \nChemistry) and must work in a controlled environment. Alchemy is a \nhighly exacting process that cannot be realistically accomplished \noutside of a laboratory-type setting. The path’s effects make no dis- \ntinction between natural or man-made elements; it will affect helium \nor Holmesian equally. \nThe level of Alchemy the Tremere possesses determines how greatly he \nmay alter a given element; note that before the thaumaturge may alter a \nsubstance, he must first be aware of every element in the compound, and \nAlchemy does not work on animate ideals (no attempting to change a vampire \ninto salt element by element). Alchemy takes one hour per level to work, at \nthe end of which the Tremere must succeed in a Static Mental Challenge \n(with the difficulty being at the Storyteller’s discretion). The path of Alchemy \nretests with the Science Ability. \nB A S I C  \nALCHEMY \nCommuta \nChanges in state - \nsolid to liquid, liquid to gas, etc. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nConforma \nSimple changes in form - \nwater to separate into amorphous clouds of \nhydrogen and oxygen, liquid to a desired shape of solid (note that it will \nremain the same element), etc. \nI NTE R M  E D I A T E  ALCHEMY \nScinde \nComplex changes to form - \nwater into breathable oxygen and loose \nMutate \nMinor shifts in composition, such as changing a given element into \nanother (up to five greater or five less than its original place on the Periodic \nTable of Elements). \nhydrogen, compounds into their separate elements, etc. \nADVANCED \nALCHEMY \nTransmutate \nRadical shifts in composition - \nany element can be transformed into any \nother (note that the state and form of the transmuted element will become \nthat of the new element’s “natural” composition). \nB I O T H A U M A T U R ~ Y  \nThis macabre path, supposedly crafted by Sabbat thaumaturges, \ndeals with flesh, whether it’s living, dead or somewhere in between. \nBiothaumaturges are the proverbial “Dr. Frankensteins,” and are \nregarded with a mixture of curiosity and revulsion - \nthis path has \nmore to do with vivisection than mysticism and is a radical depar- \nture from the clan’s Hermetic roots. Though not forbidden, \nBiothaumaturgy is generally only pursued by the strong of stomach or \nthe slightly unhinged ... . \nBiothaurnaturgy does not require any Blood Traits to be spent; \ninstead, it has other costs that are listed under the individual powers. \nAdditionally, while the biothaumaturge need not have a state-of-the- \nart facility, she must have some kind of laboratory in which to perform \nher tasks. The Tremere must have at least three levels of Science and one \nMedicine Ability in order to begin this path, and may retest it with the \nScience Ability. \nBAS I c BI O T H A U M A T U  R\n~\nY\n \nThaumaturgical Forensics \nBy taking a tissue sample back to her laboratory, and succeeding in \na Static Mental Challenge (difficulty at Storyteller discretion), a \nthaumaturge may ascertain a wealth of information beyond what “nor- \nmal” forensics or genetics would yield. This information will always be \nphysical in nature, such as gender, clan, generation, age, diablerie traces \nor relative health, and it is up to the Storyteller how much is gleaned \nunder a given examination. Thaumaturgical Forensics may be used on \nplants, but not inanimate objects, and requires a week’s worth of study \nupon the tissue sample. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThaumaturgical Surgery \nThe thaumaturge may use her abilities to increase a body’s regenera- \ntive prowess, even those of the undead, so long as she and her target are \nin her laboratory. Once per evening, for every Mental Trait the caster \nspends (up to three), one wound level may be converted to a lesser type. \nAggravated damage becomes lethal, lethal damage becomes bashing and \nbashing damage vanishes completely. The actual surgery takes about 10 \nminutes of work per wound level reduced, the target taking time to rest \nfor the remainder of the evening or session. The thaumaturge may not \nregain those Mental Traits until the next evening, even with the \nexpenditure of Willpower. \nLesser Animation \nThe biothaumaturge imbues an intact, dead being with part of his \nown life essence, although at this level the power is limited to plants \nor animals the size of a dog or smaller. These creations may be given \nsimple instructions to carry out, which they will do so mindlessly until \nthey are destroyed. \nCreatures animated in this way are considered to have the same \nStrength- and Stamina-related Traits they had in life, although their \nDexterity-related Traits drop by one (but never below one). For obvious \nreasons, these zombie servants are considered to have zero Mental and \nSocial Traits; they are, however, immune to Dominate and Social-based \npowers as a result. The automaton’s wound levels are half of what it had \nin life, rounded up. It will immediately crumble to dust if struck by \nsunlight and suffer double damage from fire. Note that decayed, maimed \nor partially eaten corpses will be extremely ineffective as the corpse \ncannot regenerate any bits that might be missing \nIf the caster succeeds in a Static Mental Challenge (the Storyteller \nmay modify. this to reflect the state of decay), the carcass is successfully \nanimated and may be given a basic one-sentence command any time the \ncaster wishes. Animating a corpse takes at least seven days of preparation \nand experimentation, and once an order has been given, the creation may \nnot be given another. \nINTERMEDIATE \nBIOTHAUMATURC~Y \nGreater Animation \nAt this level, the biothaumaturge has refined the process of reanima- \ntion to the point that she can now revive the corpses of humans and larger \nanimals; additionally, modifications may be made to smaller creatures \nrevived with Lesser Animation by grafting and manipulating body parts \nfrom other creatures. \nWhile the larger creatures and humans follow the same rules as \nLesser Animation for instructions, Traits, wound levels and immunities, \nthe thaumaturge may now begin to creatively alter the plants and \nanimals she has previously animated. Plants can be given tiny snapping \njaws, or a rat may have grafted wings. Before any vivisection may begin, \nhowever, the thaumaturge must first acquire the appendages she wishes \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nto graft onto his creations. Storytellers should adjust the creations’ \nTraits and damage levels accordingly. \nAnimating a larger corpse will take two weeks of intense experimenta- \ntion; altering an existing Lesser Animation takes only one week. In both \ninstances, the caster must first succeed in a Static Mental Challenge (diffi- \nculty at the Storyteller’s discretion). \nADVANCED \nB I O T H A U M A T U R ~ Y  \nCognizant Construction \nThe apex of biothaumaturgical prowess, the animated creations \nthe thaumaturge controls may now be given back a degree of the \nmental acuity they had in life. Although they now have a number of \nMental Traits equal to what they had in life less one (but never below \none), they will still serve their creator faithfully. Now, however, these \ncreations possess some cognitive capacity - \nanimate animals gain an \nevil cunning while higher lifeforms can reason deductively and strate- \ngically. Unlike the other animations, the biothaumaturge may change \nthe orders given to a Cognizant Construction at any time; it will follow \nthe most recent order. \nCognizgnt Constructions take three weeks of work after a Static Mental \nChallenge. \nTHE \nEOCUSED M I N D  \nDeveloped by a Tremere Kabbalistic scholar, this extremely rare path is \nonly practiced by a select few. The serenity and dedication necessary to train \nthe mind is often lacking in these chaotic nights, but those few who master \ntheir own thoughts become frighteningly effective opponents. \nThis path retests on the Occult Ability, and thaumaturges must have at \nleast seven Mental Traits to begin it. \nBASIC PATHOETHE \nEOCUSED M I N D  \nReadiness \nThis power grants the ability to jumpstart sluggish synapses, allowing for \na quicker and more lucid understanding of a situation. While it is only usable \nupon the thaumaturge herself, she will be three Traits up on Mental Chal- \nlenges relating to leaps of logic, investigation, memory or reasoning. This \npower lasts from one scene to an hour. \nCentering \nBy muttering soothing words to himself or another, the caster can \ninfluence a person’s psyche, even talking her out of frenzy. While experienc- \ning this serenity, the target is better able to focus on tasks and problems ahead \nof her, even ignoring pain and the threat of bodily harm. Some magi in fear \nof frenzy use this on themselves. \nFor the duration of the power, the target is unaffected by wound \npenalties; additionally, for every Mental Trait the thaumaturge spends (up \nto three), the target gains a Trait to defend against any attempt to evoke \nemotion and resist (or break out of) frenzy, even those which resulted from \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDisciplines. The target must be within earshot of and able to hear the caster, \nand the caster must spend at least one full turn speaking to the target. This \npower lasts for one scene or an hour. \nINTERMEDIATE \nPATHOETHE \nEOCUSED MIND \nOne-Tracked Mind \nBy extending her focus to another person and speaking to them \nrationally, the thaumaturge may fixate her subject upon a single action or \nthought. The target ignores any and all distractions around him, and \nsimply concentrates on the idea in front of him. If cast during combat, the \ntarget may not perform any other actions for the remainder of the combat \nother than the one he most recently declared at the time of casting; even \nextra actions gained through Celerity are directed toward this end. As a \nbonus, the target gain an extra Trait that may be added to any challenges \nmade in pursuit of his target obsession. This fixation will fade at the end \nof the combat. If cast outside a combat, the target must continue doing \nexactly what he was doing at the time of casting for one scene. In both \ncases, the target’s actions are perfectly logical to him, and he will even \nbelieve it was his idea. \nTo fixate a subject, the thaumaturge must first succeed in a Mental \nChallenge with the target and speak with the target for one action. The target \nmust be within earshot and able to hear the caster. \nDual Thought \nThis degree of mental perfection permits the thaumaturge to concen- \ntrate on two completely different tasks and perform them both with equal \nacumen. By spending a temporary Willpower, the caster may now take an \nextra action during her turn so long as that action is Mental in nature, be \nit Mental-based Disciplines or the tackling of a problem. These actions \ntake place simultaneously on the thaumaturge’s turn. There are no other \nbenefits to this power; all actions still require any expenditures, chal- \nlenges or penalties they would have if performed separately, and no more \nblood may be spent per turn than is allowed by the thaumaturge’s \ngeneration. The power lasts for one scene or 10 minutes. \nADVANCED \nPATHOETHE \nEOCUSED MIND \nPerfect Clarity \nWith a burst of concentration, the thaumaturge is able to achieve a \nmoment of pure thought, transcending emotion and distraction. By spending \na temporary Willpower, the caster becomes temporarily immune to frenzy and \nRotschreck (even through supernatural means), has a two-Trait bonus in any \nchallenge, and all opponents attempting to influence or control the \nthaumaturge in any way (including with Presence or Dominate) lose all ties to \ndo so. This power lasts for one combat scene, or 10 minutes. \nT H E  HEARTH PATH \nOriginally a collection of rituals, this path deals with the security of a \nthaumaturge’s haven. The thaumaturge may end these enchantments at any \ntime. This path retests with the Occult Ability. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBASIC HEARTH PATH \nGuest’s Herald \nWhen used on a door or other entryway, this power creates an \nauditory or visual effect that will alert the thaumaturge that an intruder \nhas breached the portal. This signal could be anything the thaumaturge \ndesires - \na bell ringing in another room or the door slamming shut \nbehind the trespasser -but \nit is the same for the duration of the power \n(although the thaumaturge can change the form the signal takes from \ncasting to casting). Note that the thaumaturge must actually be in the \nhaven for the alarm to be effective, and the signal must be small and \nsubtle (no Uzis firing automatically at the opening, for example). This \npower lasts for 24 hours. \nMaster’s Order \nBy becoming mystically attuned to her haven, a thaumaturge with this \nability instinctively knows where every one of her possessions lies in the \nhaven so long as she is in it. Note that this only works on inanimate objects \nthe thaumaturge owns (though objects the thaumaturge has successfully \nstolen will also show up without difficulty). It lasts for 24 hours. \nINTERMEDIATE \nHEARTH PATH \nRhyme of Discord \nThis power fuddles the minds of intruders in the haven, causing \nthem to become hopelessly confused and wander in circles, no matter \nhow small and plain the haven might actually be. Any intruders must \nsucceed in a Mental Challenge against the caster or else be trapped \ninside the haven until the thaumaturge breaks the spell or until it wears \noff naturally. As well, any person affected by Rhyme of Discord will be \nunable to remember details of the protected haven even after he has left \nits influence until such time as he visits the haven when it is not \nenspelled. Note that while intruders affected by this power will be \nunable to effectively pursue the thaumaturge through his haven, they \nmay still fight and defend themselves normally if the thaumaturge \nengages them. This power lasts for 24 hours. \nTemportal \nAs master of his haven, a vampire may briefly warp the space inside it so \nthat the doorways connect to each other any way he chooses. A closet door \nmight suddenly open into the laboratory, or the bathroom on the third floor \nmight be made an escape route into the back garden. Anyone following the \nthaumaturge through the door will end up where it should normally open to; \nclever vampires will use this to lead pursuers into an oubliette or trap. This \npower lasts until sunrise. \nADVANCED \nHEARTH PATH \nThe Cauldron’s Rede \nBy imparting a primitive awareness into the haven itself, the \nthaumaturge creates a network of spies from her household furnishings. \nAnything happening within the haven (or within eyeshot outside, as the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nwindows can “look” out) can be relayed to the magus by the furniture, \nornaments, draperies or bric-a-brac. The thaumaturge must verbally ask \nquestions of her belongings; anything within and around the haven is \navailable for her perusal, even if the item she is questioning wasn’t \npresent for the event. Havens have short “memories,” so the thaumaturge \nmay only ask questions regarding events that occurred in the duration of \nthat casting. In cases of extreme danger, such as fire or a pending \nambush, the voices of the haven will actively scream out to the Kindred. \nThis power lasts until sunrise. \nM A S T E R Y O ~ T H F  \nMORTAL \nSHELL \nThaumaturges practicing this path gain control over the physical \nworkings of a body. While this path cannot actually animate corpses, it \nis effective against the living and undead. Unless otherwise stated, the \npowers of this path last for a number of turns equal to the number of \nMental Traits the caster spends on the casting. This path retests with the \nOccult Ability. \nVertigo \nWith but a light touch, the thaumaturge causes a wave of dizziness and \ndisorientation to overtake her target. Anyone affected by this is rendered one \nTrait down on all Physical Challenges for the remainder of the scene. This \ndizziness might also trigger appropriate effects, such as acrophobia, at the \nStoryteller’s discretion. A ready or suspicious target will probably require a \nPhysical Challenge to affect. \nB A S I C  MASTERYOETHF \nMORTAL \nSHELL \nContortion \nThis power enables the thaumaturge to cause wracking spasms in his \ntarget. The use of this power requires a Physical Challenge to touch the \nlimb he wishes to affect. A “normal” Physical Challenge will strike an arm \nor leg; if the caster wishes to affect the target’s head, he must declare this \nintention and win two Simple Challenges after succeeding in the initial \nPhysical Challenge (if the two Simple Challenges are unsuccessful, the \ncaster misses completely and loses the Trait bid). For each arm or leg \nwarped in this way, the target not only loses the ability to use it but also \ngains the negative Physical Trait Lame. If the head is affected, the target \nsuffers a complete loss of speech and is three bids down on all Social \nChallenges as his facial muscles spasm wildly. These effects will span the \nduration of one scene. \nThe thaumaturge may also cast this effect upon himself to tighten his \nmuscles, very effective during a bite or choke attack. This power grants the \ncaster two Traits he may use during Physical Challenges if the target attempts \nto break free. \nINTERMEDIATE \nM A S T E R Y O ~ T H E  \nMORTAL \nSHELL \nSeizure \nThaumaturges using this power cause uncontrollable convulsions in \ntheir targets, sometimes resulting in death to mortals as they choke on their \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nown tongues. With a successful Physical Challenge, the thaumaturge causes \nher target to twist and writhe upon the ground in utter agony. In this state, the \nperson so afflicted may only bid passive Physical Traits and may not initiate \nchallenges, and will suffer one level of bashing damage per turn as he jerks \naround. This power lasts for one scene, and may be fatal to mortals (at the \nStoryteller’s discretion). \nBody Failure \nThose wielding this devastating power have incredible insight \ninto the workings of the body - \nand how to shut them down. This \npower will kill mortals, as their autonomic nervous system simply stops \nworking, and is extremely uncomfortable, if not usually lethal, to \nKindred. With a successful Physical Challenge and the expenditure of \na temporary Willpower, the thaumaturge causes her target to go into \ntotal system shock. The victim will suffer three health levels of lethal \ndamage immediately, and one more every subsequent turn they are \naffected by this power (until death or torpor). During this time, mortal \nvictims may only bid passive Physical Traits, may not initiate chal- \nlenges and are four Traits down in all actions. Kindred may attempt to \nsoak lethal damage. \nMarionette \nA t  this level, thaumaturges truly usurp their enemies’ bodies from \nthem, taking total control of their movements with their will alone. \nWith the expenditure of a temporary Willpower, a successful Mental \nversus Physical Challenge and established visual contact, the \nthaumaturge can cause the target to perform any physical actions \ndesired, including speech. The thaumaturge must keep the target in \nsight for the duration of the power. Because of the intense concentra- \ntion this power requires, the thaumaturge may not initiate any \nchallenges while “puppeteering” a target. \nThis power does not rob a victim of thought, only physical control. \nDuring this time, the target is aware that some outside force is having its way \nwith him and his actions are not his own. This requires gracious roleplaying \non the part of the target - \nthe movements are not jerky and robotic, but as \nfluid as his own normal ones might be. Owing to logistical difficulties, the \nthaumaturge may wish to give a series of commands for the target or follow \nwithin earshot and whisper instructions. \nADVANCED \nMASTFRYOPTHE \nMORTAL \nSHELL \nONFIROMANCY \nThe wellspring of the Sabbat’s Path of Morpheus, Oneiromncy (the \nancient Roman study of dreams) has become more popular in light of the \ndemise of the Tremere antitribu. Many Tremere are turning their attention \nback to the divinatory path, hoping that its hazy glimpses will offer guidance \nin the apocalyptic nights to come. Use of any of these powers requires at least \nfive minutes’ worth of dreamlike trance (to be treated as the vampire’s \ndaytime sleep, with any related penalties if awakened before the power is \ncompleted). This path retests with the Occult Ability. \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThis power requires the presence of a Storyteller or Narrator to provide \nresults. Storytellers are encouraged to be deliberately vague when giving the \nresults of these powers; no one ever said dreams had to be specific.. .. \nB A S I C  \nONEIROMANCY \nPortents \nBy piecing together remnants of her dreams, the thaumaturge may \nperform a reading regarding her immediate future. This power must be used \nimmediately after awakening from the dreamtrance, and takes 10 minutes of \nmeditation to collect all the fragments of information. If the thaumaturge \nsucceeds in a Simple Challenge with the Storyteller, she may then be given \na series of allegorical or symbolic images concerning one upcoming event in \nher unlife. Repeated use of this power may only result in the same images \nappearing over and over. \nForesee \nThis power allows the Warlock to delve directly into the mind of a \nsleeping individual, exposing shards of her unconscious mind. While \nPortents may only be used to foretell the future of the thaumaturge, \nForesee allows the same kind of divination for someone else. The subject \nmust be in the presence of the thaumaturge and asleep, although the \nthaumaturge may be Psychically Projected. If this power is performed on \nKindred, the caster must spend a Willpower Trait in order to see the \ndreams and understand the results \nIf the casting is successful, the Storyteller will then relate the dream- \nimages regarding the target’s future, as in Portents. \nINTERMEDIATE \nONEI \nR O M A N C Y  \nDreamspeak \nThe oneiromancer can now send messages, warnings or even \nthreats to a target through dreams. While these messages will blend \nseamlessly into the target’s own dreams, he will remember them clearly \nupon waking. This power may be used upon anyone the thaumaturge \nhas met, provided the target is asleep at the time. If successfully cast, \nthe thaumaturge can insert a static dream-sequence no longer than \nfive minutes into the sleeper’s reveries. A thaumaturge may not haunt \nher target all night/day, but the image will recur at intervals until the \ntarget awakes. \nAugury \nWhere Portents offers mere fragments, Augury allows for more \nexplicit prophetic vision or a potential breakthrough in a problem. \nThrough the course of a dreamlike trance, the oneiromancer may now \ntravel through her mind into the collective unconscious. If the caster \nwins a Simple Challenge with the Storyteller, the Storyteller may give \nthe thaumaturge a series of dream-images spawned either by the \nthaumaturge or someone the oneiromancer has previously contacted \nthrough Foresee or Dreamspeak (whichever the thaumaturge designates \nbefore casting). Dream divination is still an imperfect art and may \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n-4 \nprovide misleading symbols or information useless to the diviner - \ncaveat emptor. \nThis power may be used only once per night and only after the thaumaturge \nhas prepared herself by at least 20 minutes of meditation. The Storyteller has \nfinal say on what information an Augury provides (ordoesn’t), and should not \nreveal things that could ruin a plot or chronicle. \nADVANCED \nONEIROMANCY \nReveal the Heart’s Dreams \nA t  this level of mastery, the thaumaturge gains astounding in- \nsights into others simply by observing them. If successful, the \noneiromancer learns of the target’s single guiding passion, or the thing \nhe fears the most. The target must be within sight of the caster. For a \nmortal target, the caster spends a Willpower Trait and wins a Mental \nChallenge; a Kindred target requires the thaumaturge to spend two \nWillpower Traits and win the Mental Challenge. In either case, with \nsuccess, the caster may ask for the target to reveal either his heart’s \ndream or his deepest fears. These are not merely temporary passions, \nbut go to the very well of the soul. Armed with such information, a \nthaumaturge can make the target an offer that’s almost impossible to \ndeny, or threaten him through his greatest fear (which may well result \nin frenzy). \nStorytellers should be present during the use of this power to ensure that \nthe target of this power answers appropriately. \nP A T H O E T H E  BLOOD’S C U R S E  \nIt is the privilege of elder vampires to flagrantly abuse their power and \nstatus while the neonates and ancillae fume impotently. With the threat \nof Gehenna suddenly looming on the horizon, these “underdogs” are \nseeking creative ways to turn their tormentors’ age against them. This \npath, developed by rogue Pander and Caitiff thaumaturges, is just such a \nway. It may only be learned by Kindred of 10th generation or weaker, as \nthe thinness of the thaumaturge’s blood is an integral part of the magic of \nthe path, and the powers only work on vampires of equal or better \ngeneration. The path remains a guarded secret by those who learn it, and \nthose upper-level Tremere who are aware of it watch their underlings \nclosely for signs of it. Displaying knowledge of it is an excellent way to get \na one-way ticket to Vienna. \nThis path retests with the Occult Ability. \nBASIC PATHOETHE \nBLOOD’S \nCURSE \nRavages Of The Beast \nA thaumaturge invoking this power (which may affect any Kin- \ndred within her line of sight) prods the target’s Beast into sudden and \nterrifying action. By succeeding in a Mental Challenge, the thaumaturge \nforces the target to immediately test for frenzy (type of frenzy should \nbe appropriate to the situation). Note that Kindred with Instinct \ninstead of Self-control will always frenzy if this power is successfully \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nused on them; otherwise, normal frenzy rules apply (see page 209 of \nLaws Of The Night). \nWeight Of The Sun \nAs dawn approaches, Kindred feel their limbs and eyelids grow \nheavy and must quickly find shelter before they succumb to the irresist- \nible weight of day-sleep; thaumaturges invoking this power inflict this \nsame terrible helplessness upon their target. By succeeding in a Mental \nChallenge with her target, the thaumaturge causes the Kindred to not \nonly gain the negative Physical Traits Lethargic x 2, but also prevents \nhim from bidding any number of Traits greater than triple his Morality \n(or Path) rating. This power lasts for one scene and cannot affect \ncharacters who have achieved Golconda. \nI N T E R M E D I A T E  PATH O E T H E  BLOOD’S CURSE \nAbated Tooth \nA vampire unable to use his fangs is in sorry shape. By succeeding \nin a Mental versus Physical Challenge with his target, the thaumaturge \ncauses the target’s fangs to become mystically blunted, unable to pierce \nflesh and robbing her of the ability to use them effectively. While \naffected in this way, a Kindred cannot use her fangs to either cause \naggravated damage in combat or to feed normally. Even if the vampire \nmanages to bite a victim, it will no longer trigger the ecstasy of the \nKiss. This can make feeding problematic, if not nearly impossible, \nrequiring the Kindred to find other means. Storytellers should feel free \nto throw whatever obstacles into the Kindred’s path, from irritated \nwould-be vessels in the Rack to vexed sheriffs and princes dealing with \na Masquerade threat. \nThis power lasts for an entire night. \nTreacherous Bonds \nMany elder vampires have built a power base through judicious use of the \nblood bond, sometimes creating entire “broods” of thralls they know that can \ntrust. This insidious power reverses the bond, wreaking havoc upon the \nhapless regnant. \nIf invoking this power against a regnant, the thaumaturge must \nfirst touch the regnant, possibly requiring a Physical Challenge. If \nthe touch is successful, the blood bond between that regnant and one \nthrall becomes corrupt and unstable. Regardless of how he genuinely \nfeels about her, the regnant’s thrall now become actively distrustful \nand suspicious of her actions, possibly spreading her secrets to her \nenemies or plotting against her. This power works even if the thrall \nis unaware of the bond. If the thaumaturge turns this power against \na thrall, only that thrall’s bond becomes warped. Both uses last for \none night. \nStorytellers should be informed of this power’s use, and the \nthaumaturge should not be told out of character if the power has \nsucceeded or failed. Many regents levy harsh censure on those appren- \ntices with knowledge of this power. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nADVANCED \nPATH \no E T H F  BLOOD’S CURSE \nThe Withering Of Ages \nThis devastating power works directly upon the blood within a Kindred’s \nveins, stripping her of her immortality until she resembles her true age. By \nmaking a successful Physical Challenge with the target, the thaumaturge \nrenders her decrepit, shriveled and warped. The target’s fangs elongate, and \nvampiric features become more pronounced. \nFor every Willpower Trait the thaumaturge spends, the target is \nphysically aged one decade. Each decade means the loss of two Physical \nTraits. While the target cannot be aged past zero Traits, without \nPhysical Traits she cannot move, feed or even defend herself, and her \nspeech becomes so soft as to be nearly inaudible. If aged to zero Physical \nTraits, she may also not initiate challenges, and any of her Appearance- \nbased Social Traits are negated. For every five decades the target ages, \nshe gains the Negative Traits Decrepit and Repugnant as her features \nbecome more feral and her body shrinks into a skeletal heap, in addition \nto the loss of Physical Traits. The target may attempt to restore herself \nby spending one Willpower Trait and five blood Traits in the same turn \nshe was afflicted. \nStorytellers should feel free to increase or decrease these penalties as \nappropriate (if, for example, the vampire is only 10 years old, but was \nEmbraced at age 70, or if the character has the Flaw: Child). This power lasts \nfor one night, whereupon the vampire sheds her years and appears as young \nor old as the night of her Embrace. \nPATH \no E CURSES \nThis path, a natural extension of human spite, was developed early in \nthe history of Thaumaturgy. Whatever it is called - \nwhether it be hexing \nor bestowing the evil eye - \nit always involves a “calling down” of evil \nforces upon the victim. Some theorize that it is purely the psychological \nimpact that makes the superstitious unlucky or ill, but thaumaturges know \nbetter. This path is extremely powerful, but is also dangerous; unlike other \npaths, the accursed usually know exactly who it is who is making their \nunlives miserable - \na Warlock must speak aloud her curse directly to her \ntarget. While modern industrialized nations pooh-pooh the notion of \ncurses, there are places in the world where such a brazen witch could find \nherself pursued by a mob. \nWarlocks wishing to bestow a curse upon the unlucky target must first \npossess a sympathetic link - \na bit of blood, a lock of hair, a fingernail or the \nlike - \nand then must win a Social Challenge against their victim while \nintoning to them the details of the curse (although not necessarily in a \nlanguage the target understands). The sympathetic link might need to be \nacquired through a Physical Challenge; this is a good time to remind players \nof the “NO Touching” rule. A new sympathetic link must be used each time \na power is invoked, even if it is upon the same person. This path retests with \nthe Intimidation Ability. The thaumaturge can remove her own curses any \ntime she wishes. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBASIC PA THO^ CURSES \nStigma \nThis, the most basic of curses, “marks” the victim with an invisible aura \nof revulsion. While no one will ever be able to say exactly why the target is \nuncomfortable to be around, it will make social dealings difficult nonetheless. \nThe subject of this curse (who may be mortal or Kindred) must bid an extra \nTrait in all Social Challenges and loses all ties in Social Challenges. This \npower lasts until the next sunset. \nMalady \nThis power allows the thaumaturge to infect Kindred or kine with a \ndebilitating sickness. Even a powerful Cainite might think twice about crossing \nsomeone who could make them suffer the sicknesses of a common mortal. \nIf this power is successfully invoked, the accursed suffers a two-Trait \npenalty to all physical actions due to intense discomfort; the disease looks and \nbehaves similarly to influenza. The player should tell everyone around her of \nthese developments and roleplay appropriately. This curse might also endan- \nger the Masquerade as the accursed Kindred sneezes and vomits blood. It lasts \nuntil sunrise. \nINTERMEDIATE \nPATH \nO E  CURSES \nPariah \nThis curse touches upon the greatest fear in organized society, that \nof being wholly outcast. By twisting the perceptions of the target’s peers, \nthe thaumaturge curses his target to appear as the most hateful of \nenemies to her peers (the target should indicate to anyone she interacts \nwith that she appears to be the most horrible enemy that person can \nthink of). This altered perception is only in body - \nthe target may still \nact and speak as normal. \nLike Mask of 1000 Faces, this power affects the perceptions of the \nonlooker, leading him to believe that he sees his worst enemy before him. \nHow he chooses to react is up to him: He may simply snub the target, or he \nmight throw the first punch. Auspex cannot see through this power. This \npower lasts until sunrise. \nCorrupt Body \nWhile Pariah simply alters the perceptions of those around the target, \nCorrupt Body makes that appearance reality. By denouncing the physical form \nof the accursed, the thaumaturge forces her body to warp into a grotesque \nparody of what it once was. This outward caricaturing is accompanied by \nmind-wracking pain, and Kindred who have undergone this curse are often \nscarred both mentally and physically. \nIf successfully cast, this power reduces the target’s Physical Traits to \nhalf (rounded down), bestows two Negative Physical Traits (Storyteller \ndiscretion, based on the curse) and renders all Appearance-based Social \nTraits unusable for the duration of the curse. The target must also spend \none turn doing nothing but writhing in agony. After that turn of transfor- \nmation, the full weight of the curse descends, lasting until sunrise or until \nthe thaumaturge lifts it. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nADVANCED \nPATH \nO E  CURSES \nFall From Grace \nThis power curses the target with supreme ineptitude, making even \nthe most familiar of tasks an uncertain endeavor. If successfully invoked, \nthe thaumaturge ensures that the odds will always be against the accursed \n-the target will lose all ties, in any challenge, and cannot use any retests, \nincluding those given by Merits (i.e. to succeed in an action, a person \naccursed in this way must straight-out win every challenge). This power \nlasts until sunrise. \nPATH \nOF TRANSMUTATION \nThis path is regarded by elder Tremere as a kind of poor man’s Alchemy, \nas it deals with similar principles without the true mastery of the art. \nHowever, it is quick and does not require the structure of a laboratory to \nperform. Also, these powers may be used in conjunction with one another \nfor more dramatic alterations and work upon any object within the \nthaumaturge’s direct line of sight (meaning that blood within a body cannot \nbe affected, but blood exiting the body can). \nThis path retests with the Occult Ability. \nBASIC PATH \nO E  TRANSMUTATION \nFortify The Solid Form \nBy strengthening the atomic bonds in an object, the magus in- \ncreases the strength of an item, negating any Fragile Negative Traits it \nhas and allowing for inherently weak objects (such as pencils) to \nfunction more effectively in combat situations. It can also be used to \nmake armor tougher, enabling it to withstand one more Health Level \nthan it would normally. Creative thaumaturges can use this power in \nother ways, at the Storyteller’s discretion. The magus must spend a \nMental Trait to use this power. \nObjects thus enhanced will remain so for the duration of one scene. \nCrystallize the Liquid Form \nOriginally developed to keep other Kindred from imbibing the \nthaumaturges’ vitae (as Kindred cannot consume congealed blood), this \npower will transform up to one Blood Trait’s worth (about two pints) of \nliquid into solid form. The substance will not change in temperature or \nvolatility, only form (so solid acid will still corrode, solid molten metal \nwill still burn, etc.). Liquids within living forms may not be affected. At \nthe end of the scene, the material will revert to its natural form; solidified \nobjects can be broken, although this weakness can be lessened through use \nof the first power of this path. The thaumaturge must spend a Mental Trait \nto enact this power. \nINTERMEDIATE PATH \nO E  TRANSMUTATION \nLiquefy the Solid Form \nAs its name implies, use of this power melts objects into liquid \npuddles. The thaumaturge must spend a number of Mental Traits relevant \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nto the size of the object affected (a stake might cost one, while a tank \nmight require seven or eight). At the end of the scene, the object will \nrevert to its “natural” form unless the puddle is scattered; Storytellers \nshould be aware that the object will try to resume its previous form with \nas much material as remains. Also note that this power does not work on \nliving (or unliving) beings. \nGaol \nThis power allows the Warlock to solidify air into an opaque, indestruc- \ntible barrier. A shimmering prison forms around the target’s body, encasing \nher within an impenetrable field; this power can also be used to form walls \nwithin doorways, solidifying the space within the doorframe. \nThe thaumaturge may affect any area within 50 yards (and line of sight) \nof himself and must spend a number of Mental Traits relevant to the size of \nthe area encased (a small rodent would cost one, while a normal-sized \nperson would cost five). Once encased, Kindred suffer no penalties, but \nmortals experience the discomfort of adapting to breathing “liquid air” as \nthe oxygen in the block becomes liquid-like but still breathable (and \nindeed, after being freed from their prison, mortals must cough out the \ncondensed contents of their lungs, suffering one bashing level of damage \nwhile they retch). This prison is completely impenetrable, even by Kindred \nusing Potence, and lasts for one scene. \nADVANCED \nPATH \nO E  TRANSMUTATION \nGhost Wall \nAt this level of the path, thaumaturges find that solid objects offer no \nresistance. With due concentration, any material is rendered vaporous and \nmay be passed through easily. While this power does not affect sentient \nbeings, floors underneath foes may suddenly disappear, parachutes suddenly \n“don’t work,” or the prince’s favorite ghoul suddenly falls right through the car \nseat into traffic.. . . \nThe thaumaturge must spend a number of Mental Traits relevant to \nthe size of the object being made gaseous (one Mental Trait would be \nenough to affect a target’s clothes, while a city bus would take seven or \neight). This power affects anything within the thaumaturge’s line of \nsight, and lasts for one scene, after which the object reforms itself \nexactly how and where it was when this power was used (vaporous \nobjects may not be dissipated in any way). Should a victim be occupying \nthe same space as an affected object after the power expires, the victim \nsuffers a number of health levels of aggravated damage (amount deter- \nmined by the Storyteller based one the object). Objects conflicting this \nway remain together until one is invoked to vaporous state or is physi- \ncally removed. \nV I N E  \nOE DIONYSUS \nYears before the coming of Christianity, temples devoted to the god \nDionysus flourished throughout Greece. As a symbol of rebirth, vampires \nin those areas were drawn to him and worshipped nightly at his shrines, \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\neagerly involving themselves in orgiastic bouts of wine and revelry. These \npractices eventually became reflected in the magic of the Tremere, \nalthough few Warlocks will openly admit to engaging in the shameful \n(and often cannibalistic) rites. \nMost practitioners of either gender on this path refer to them- \nselves as thyrsi (sing. thrysus); female Warlocks are sometimes called \nMaenads (usually from a safe distance). These Warlocks often display \njewelry or symbols of their faith, including representations of pi- \nnecones and ivy. \nFollowers of this path find it is more of a religion than a series of magical \nformulae and cannot resist becoming entrenched in its hedonism; as a result, \nKindred beginning this path automatically lose one permanent Willpower \nTrait as they become “addicted” to the pleasures. This path retests with the \nOccult Ability. \nB A S I C  PATHOETHE \nV I N B O E  \nD I O N Y S U S  \nMethy skein \nBy making physical contact with his target, the Warlock causes her to \nbehave and appear as if she were drunk. For one scene, a person affected by \nthis power suffers a one-Trait penalty on all challenges involving Dexterity \nor Intelligence, and generally acts intoxicated, from slurred speech to eupho- \nria and clouded judgement. \nIf used on a mortal or ghoul three nights in a row, the victim becomes \naddicted to the euphoria this power brings and may suffer ill effects from \nthis addiction (such as Trait penalties for each night without a “fix”). \nOmophagy \nThis power hearkens back to Dionysus’ ability to invoke animal urges \nin his victims. By making direct eye contact and winning a Mental \nChallenge with her target, the Warlock imbues her target with an all- \nencompassing gluttony. Mortals eat until they become sick and even then \nwill feel hungry and continue to gorge after they vomit. Kindred affected \nin this way will not only drain a vessel completely of blood (even if it is \nanother Kindred!) but attempt to devour the victim’s flesh (although this \ndoes not grant the ability to digest whatever flesh is eaten, ensuring \npredictable, gory results). A Kindred who kills another in a fit of gustatory \necstasy cannot “accidentally” diablerize the victim. \nA vampire affected by this power seeks out the easiest “prey” readily \navailable. If the vampire is hungry and confronted by the sight, smell or \ntaste of blood, hunger frenzy occurs. The target loses awareness of her \nsurroundings to the extent that a breach of Masquerade is probable. By \nspending a Willpower Trait, the victim may resist the hunger for one \nscene but will lapse back into it with gusto. This effect lasts for the rest \nof the night. \nINTERMEDIATE \nPATHOETHE \nV I N E O E  \nDIONYSUS \nHamartia \nFar more intense than the mere euphoria created by Methyskein, this \npower causes intoxication to the point of perversity, delirium and possibly \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ntorpid stupor. In those who possess the path themselves, however, it also \ngrants superhuman strength. \nBy making physical contact with his target, the thaumaturge induces \nsuch euphoria in the victim that she is two Traits down on all challenges \nfor the remainder of the scene. How the victim reacts to such intoxication \nis in the hands of the Storyteller - lust, depression and violence are \npossible, and the target’s Nature, Flaws or derangements may further \naffect her actions. \nInterestingly enough, while they also suffer most of the negative effects \ndetailed above, when this path is used upon another follower of the Vine of \nDionysus the victim takes no penalty to physical actions and gains a two-Trait \nbonus in challenges involving strength. \nEnthousiasm6s \nWith this power, the follower of Dionysus exudes a powerful phero- \nmone with which she may “infect” others within a 10 foot radius. Anyone \naffected will fall into a narcotic stupor as the hallucinogen induces pleasant, \ndreamlike images. In this state they wilt simply giggle, dance or sigh as they \nsink into the visions. \nBy succeeding in this power, the Warlock ensures that the targets are far \ntoo Submissive x 2, Lethargic and Witless to pose much of a threat; they’re \ninclined to passive euphoria, content to while away their time with their \nvisions (which are better than television). Someone affected by this power \nmay spend a temporary Willpower to shrug off the effects for one turn, after \nwhich he slides back under. This power lasts for one scene. \nADVANCED \nPATHOETHE \nV I N E O E  \nDIONYSUS \nOinos Aimatos \nBy invoking the essence of the wine-god into themselves, the thrysus \ntransforms his blood into a powerful elixir. For the duration of one scene, \nanyone imbibing even the tiniest drop of the Warlock‘s blood will be affected \nas per Enthousiasrn6s. The thaumaturge need only spend a Blood Trait and a \nWillpower Trait upon first invoking this power: He can affect as many targets \nas drink his blood without further expense. \nIf dumped into a communal punchbowl or the like, it can only be \ndetected through the use of Heightened Senses and a successful Mental \nChallenge (difficulty at the Storyteller’s discretion). It can also be detected \nby enhanced powers of taste, but by then of course it is too late for the Kindred \nin question. \nThe effects of this power last for one scene. \nTRFMERF \nRITUALS \nThaumaturgical rituals can be defined as a unique series of gestures, \ninvocations and material components that achieve a particular magical \npurpose. The more dramatic and far-reaching the effect desired, the more \ncomplex and difficult the ritual will be. \nThe creation of rituals requires lengthy and painstaking experimen- \ntation. A Kindred must possess at least five levels of the Occult Ability \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nbefore she can even begin to sketch out her own ritual, and must also \npossess a level of Thaumaturgy at least one step greater than the level of \nthe ritual she is attempting to write; after that, the player should let the \nStoryteller know what effect she is after and how exactly she is going \nabout it, and be willing to negotiate. The actual details of the ritual are \nup to the Storyteller; factors to consider when determining the power of \nthe ritual are level (Basic, Intermediate, Advanced), components (are \nthey rare or mundane? will they result in a loss of Humanity to use or \nobtain?), casting time (is the “usual” time for a ritual of that level, or \ndoes it take longer/shorter?) and overall difficulty (does it require a \nBlood Trait from the target?). When both the Storyteller and player \nhave agreed upon a balanced ritual, the character then “experiments” \nin-character for a length of time appropriate to the level of the ritual \n(double the time it takes to learn Disciplines of the same level is one \nidea), at the end of which the character has a completed set of notes to \nactually learn the ritual from. \nLearning existing rituals requires the study of someone else’s written \nnotes on the ritual until it is committed to memory; the more common rituals \nlisted in Laws of the Night may be found in nearly every Tremere library, but \nsome of the rituals listed below are particularly inaccessible. Storytellers may \ndecide to make the rituals with a path listed after them only available to, or \ntaught by, followers of that path. \nCasting rituals requires a Static Mental Challenge (against five Traits \nfor a Basic, seven Traits for an Intermediate and nine Traits for an \nAdvanced) and, unless otherwise stated in the ritual description, 10 \nminutes for each level (10 minutes for Basic, 20 minutes for Intermediate, \nand 30 minutes for an Advanced). Although all of the rituals listed here \ninclude necessary components (usually readily available through the use \nof Influences), you may opt, as the Storyteller, to allow them to assume the \ncomponents were on hand. Very few of the rituals in Laws Of The Night \nhave component requirements, it’s true; but the rituals listed here are \nmore specialized and less ubiquitous, and therefore might require a bit \nmore effort on the part of the thaumaturge. Just keep in mind that the \nacquisition of arcane objects and occult materials is an ongoing task for \nthaumaturge and can be the basis for many intricate plots. \nA NOTE \nSome of these effects can be darned hard to simulate in a live-action \nsetting or make demands of a Storyteller (such as following an unlucky target \nofjinx). You may choose to designate aNarrator to handle such duties, to alter \nthe effects of a ritual in the name of expedience or simply to disallow it \naltogether. \nB A s I c THAW \nMATU R cj I CAL RITUALS \nBlood Mead (Vine of Dionysus) \nFollowers of Dionysus claim that their potions do more than just \nintoxicate. By invoking Dionysus’ blessing upon a special concoction of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmead (fermented honey) and two of his own Blood Traits, the ritualist \ncreates a brew that is both invigorating and anesthetizing. By drinking \nthis potion immediately after casting, the thaumaturge gains an extra \nHealthy health level, but also becomes one Trait down on all challenges \ninvolving dexterity or intelligence due to intoxication. This ritual lasts \nfor one night. \nBrand of the Paramour \nThis ritual enables the thaumaturge to maintain constant aware- \nness of her ghoul’s physical condition. The Warlock obtains a Blood \nTrait from mortal twins of any age (two Blood Traits in total) and \nperforms the ritual over the blood. Both ghoul and Kindred then drink \nequally of the vitae, after which time the Kindred will feel a “ghost” \npain in the same place that the ghoul suffers, although the severity of \nthe damage will be uncertain. The thaumaturge suffers no unusual \nphysical effects (other than pain) no matter how badly injured the \nghoul is, even if her ghoul is slain. This ritual lasts until the ghoul is \nEmbraced or killed. \nCraft Bloodstone \nBy imbuing a small pebble with her own vitae, the thaumaturge \ncreates a mystical tracking device to which she will always be connected. \nThis ritual takes three consecutive nights to cast; on the first night, the \nthaumaturge soaks the pebble in three Traits of her blood and recites the \nritual while the stone absorbs a portion of the vitae. On the second night, \nshe completes the next phase of the incantation, during which the pebble \nabsorbs more of the blood. On the final night, the last of the blood is \nabsorbed (although the pebble’s appearance does not change) and the \nthaumaturge instinctively knows where the pebble is at all times. While \nthis does not grant precise knowledge of its location, it does give the caster \na strong sense of distance and direction. This ritual takes five minutes per \nnight, for three nights. \nEncrypt Missive \nCenturies of clan secrets have been preserved through judicious use of \nthis ritual, although now it also seems common among the anarchs of the new \nstates, who use it to encrypt graffiti on slum alleyways. By writing the message \nin blood and speaking the name of the person he wishes to read it, the \nthaumaturge ensures that anyone else spying the document will interpret it \nas meaningless scribbles. Only the writer and the person to whom the note is \naddressed may read it \nEnhancing the Curse \nThis ritual is used almost exclusively to punish or torment ghouls. By \nscratching or striking the ghoul, drawing blood and speaking the ancient \nwords of the curse, the Warlock bestows a terrible vulnerability to sunlight \nupon her. For as long as vampiric vitae courses through her veins, the ghoul \nnow suffers aggravated damage from exposure to sunlight at a rate of one \nhealth level per two turns as her skin blisters and blackens into third-degree \nbums. This ritual lasts for one month. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nExtinguish \nBy first intoning the ritual and then pinching out a candle flame \n(possibly requiring a Courage check) and spitting on the floor, the caster \nof this ritual ensures that for the remainder of the night he has a degree of \nmastery over flames. After this ritual is successfully cast, the thaumaturge \nmay at any time for the rest of the evening speak a magical syllable that \nwill completely extinguish any one flame up to the size of a small bonfire. \nAfter it has been used, the spell is broken. Even if this ritual goes unused \nafter casting, it must be recast the next night if the caster wishes to retain \nits effects. \nImpassable Trail \nThe vampire can travel through even the densest woods without betray- \ning any sign of passage aside from her faint scent (which can only be detected \nby Heightened Senses or other supernatural sensory abilities). The thaumaturge \nmust either carry an owl‘s feather steeped in Kindred vitae or bum the legs of \na dead toad and carry the ashes with her while this ritual is in effect. It lasts \nuntil sunrise. \nImpressive Visage \nThis ritual grants the caster a degree of sheer physical magnetism \nand ensures he will be neither ignored nor forgotten. He simply appears \nto be more desirable and attractive than anyone else in the room. By \nperforming this ritual and then placing a sprig of dried mint in his right \nshoe or pocket, the Warlock gains two Appearance-related Social Traits \nfor an evening. While they may not be bid, they may be counted in ties \nand overbids even if it goes over the Kindred’s generational maximum. \nThis power may not be “stacked” for an evening. \nThe Imp’s Affliction \nThis ritual only works on mortals, and infects them with an uncom- \nfortable and embarrassing illness. While under the effects of this ritual, \nthe target’s eyes and nose overflow with mucus, her throat becomes raw \nand raspy, and her eyes constantly brim with tears. Storytellers should \nassign penalties appropriate to the target’s actions (Social and Physical \nChallenges are certainly more difficult). This ritual lasts for one scene \nand requires the thaumaturge to write the target’s name on a scrap of \npaper and then burn it. \nJinx \nBy sacrificing some of the victim’s blood, the thaumaturge afflicts a \nCainite with bad luck. The thaumaturge must possess at least one Trait of \nthe target’s vitae, which disappears during the sending, after which the \nStoryteller should be informed of the ritual’s success so she can properly \ninterpret the consequences. For one scene, anything that can go wrong for \nthe character will - \nhe trips on his shoelaces as he enters a room, his car \nfails to start at a critical moment, or he alerts a firewall while he’s hacking \ninto a mainframe. \nThis ritual won’t do direct damage to the victim but should definitely \nmake the Jinxed person’s evening more interesting. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nLearning the Mind Enslumbered \nWith this ritual, a thaumaturge can determine the cause of a \nKindred’s torpor or demise. After placing a penny or other small coin \non the vampire’s eye, she will hear the Kindred’s spirit tell the \nparticulars of its current state. She may also invoke this power on a \nvampire’s ashen remains. The thaumaturge cannot carry on a conver- \nsation with the spirit. This power takes a full half-hour to perform and \nonly works on Kindred. \nMourning Life Curse \nAlthough this ritual causes no real physical harm (outside of \nblood loss) to mortals, it can be incredibly frightening to those who \nview it. The Warlock drinks a dram of thrice-distilled crocodile \nblood, then makes a paste of copal oil, ground eyebright and dates. He \nmay carry the paste until he finds a suitable target. When the \nthaumaturge wishes to enact this ritual, she must first dab the paste \nonto her target’s eyes (possibly requiring a challenge) and then \nwhisper a two-line incantation in his ear (the target must be able to \nhear the words to be affected by this ritual, although he may be \nasleep). The mortal then begins to uncontrollably weep bloody tears. \nThis unstoppable blood loss continues until the thaumaturge stops \nvisually concentrating upon the mortal. Thaumaturges performing \nthis ritual are unable to take any other actions, as the totality of their \nwill is focused on the mortal. The bleeding is painless but slow; one \nBlood Trait will be secreted for every five minutes. Some Tremere use \nthis to feed upon sleeping victims. \nPurge the Inner Demon \nAll Kindred face the Beast; thaumaturges developed this ritual to \ncontrol it. By pushing a sturdy pin through her own hand, the Warlock \ncauses a vampire’s Beast to be temporarily separated from her psyche. \nShe may be pulled out of frenzy by this ritual. In this state, she cannot \nbe made to frenzy by anything non-supernatural in nature, but she also \ngains the Negative Social Trait Submissive. This power lasts a number of \nhours equal to the caster’s Morality Traits. The thaumaturge may not use \nthis power on himself. \nRebirth Of Mortal Vanity \nOften a useful chip for bargaining with the Toreador, this ritual allows \na vampire to effectively “grow” hair. For every inch of hair he wishes, the \nrecipient of the ritual (whether the caster or another Kindred) must pluck \na hair from the head of a living human child. The thaumaturge then places \nthe hairs on a mirror and invokes the ritual. As the vampire’s hair begins \nto grow, the child’s hairs disappear into the surface of the mirror. Once the \nritual is finished, the hair ceases to grow, but the hair will remain at the \nnew length until cut. If it is ever cut shorter than it was at the vampire’s \nEmbrace, it will return to its original pre-ritual length the next sunset. \nNote that this ritual will not grow hair on a bald vampire, and the ritualist \ncannot change the color or other features of the hair. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRite of Introduction \nThis ritual is used for a newly arriving Tremere to make a formal \nintroduction to the regent of the city. The arrival of the telephone and e- \nmail has made the ritual mostly obsolete, but some tradition-minded \nregents will not accept a visitor who has not followed protocol. The caster \nboils a handful of ground tamarisk root in a pot of rainwater, then recites \nan incantation into the vapors that form over the water and adds a drop \nof galangal oil, then speaks a brief (30 second) message of introduction for \nthe regent of the city. The regent may reply telepathically for up to five \nminutes if she wishes. \nSanguineous Phial \nThis ritual enables the caster to mystically enchant a vessel so \nthat it will hold a quantity of blood without spoiling. The Warlock \nmust obtain a covered earthenware jar and bury it in the earth for \ntwo nights, after which she digs it up and crumbles an ash leaf into \nthe empty canister. Then the blood is poured in, and the jar is \nclosed and sealed with tallow from a candle. The blood remains \nfresh until the seal is broken; after the jar is opened, the blood will \nbegin to rot at a normal rate, but if the jar is broken, the blood \nimmediately decays as if it had never been preserved. This ritual \nmust be recast every time the thaumaturge wishes to preserve blood, \neven if she uses the same container. \nThe Scribe \nWith this power, the thaumaturge’s spoken words are mystically \ntranscribed into a written document. The document can take almost any \nform - \nthe words may appear in a bound book, on loose-leaf paper, on a \nwall, the head of apin or whatever, but clarity may be sacrificed (100 pages \nwill not translate onto a notecard without difficulty). Some younger \nWarlocks even use this to mimic a computer’s speech recognition pro- \ngram. Note that the transcription is literal - \nthe ritual will not improve \na speaker’s quality or clarity. The caster may also lay this ritual on another \nwith the same effects, but must crush a bird’s beak or lizard’s tongue \nbetween her thumb and forefinger each time. This power lasts for one \nscene, or until the thaumaturge chooses to end it. \nSense The Mystical \nThis ritual enables the thaumaturge to sense magical effects and \nenchanted objects. The Warlock chants non-stop for five minutes to \ninvoke this power, then carries a lit candle with him. When the \ncandlelight finds an object or effect touched by blood-related magic, the \nitem glitters. This power will sense any kind of blood-related magic \n(including Thaumaturgy, Necromancy and the user) as long as it is \ncurrently being invoked, any magically created or manipulated items \nand, at the Storyteller’s discretion, any traces of True Magick in the area \nof the candle’s light. This power does not distinguish between the \ndifferent types of magic it reveals and lasts for one scene. It is not \ntriggered by “normal” Disciplines. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTrima (The Vine of Dionysus) \nThis type of oinos is made with spices that warm the drinkers’ blood and \nmake them drowsy and content. Thaumaturges often use this ritual at parties \nwhere both Kindred and kine mingle, the better to protect the Masquerade \nif the vampires choose to feed. Although the creation of the spiced wine \nrequires a Trait of the caster’s vitae, Kindred feeding from mortals under the \ninfluence of the enspelled beverage need not worry about becoming blood \nbound to the caster; all supernatural properties of the thaumaturge’s blood are \ndissolved into the trim. \nMortals drinking the concoction suffer the Negative Traits Submissive \nand Lethargic, and any details about the evening they try to remember later \nwill be fuzzy and indistinct. The power of the oinos lasts until sunrise. \nWhispers Of The Ghost \nThis ritual, when combined with the Auspex power of Psychic Projec- \ntion, enables the ritualist to speak directly into the material world while \nin his astral form. After weaving the spell, the Cainite may only speak in \nwhispers to the physical world (he cannot be seen or touched). This power \nlasts for one scene, counted from the first word the thaumaturge utters. \nThe thaumaurge must carry the ear of a still-living creature in his left hand \nwhile performing this ritual. \nI NTE R M E D I ATE TH \nA U  M ATU ~q I C A L  XI \nT u A L  s \nBlood Allergy \nA grim reminder of the frailties of mortal flesh, this ritual enables the \ncaster to forcefully “purge” blood from a victim’s body. By mixing a Blood \nTrait with dead rose petals and speaking the incantation, the ritualist makes \nit impossible for the target to keep blood in her system; for every Blood Trait \nabove three the target possesses, she spends one turn vomiting it from her \nbody. The Kindred cannot retain more than three Blood Traits in her body \nfor the duration of the ritual; if she attempts to drink more, she immediately \nsuffers severe nausea and vomiting until the extra blood is gone. While this \nloss of blood will not induce torpor, it may require the vampire to make a \nhunger frenzy check (at the Storyteller’s discretion). This power lasts for an \nentire evening. This power will not work on those Kindred who are older \nthan the caster. \nCleansing Of The Flesh \nWith the spread of blood plagues such as AIDS, Kindred often find \nthemselves unwitting carriers of these unflattering “social” diseases. A \nWarlock wishing to rid himself of these kinds of maladies must spend a \nfull night in a bathtub (or cauldron) filled with purified water, bleeding \nall but the tiniest drop of blood from his body. As the blood is diffused \ninto the water, any addictions and diseases (non-supernatural) the \nKindred’s body might carry are bled out. This ritual may be performed \nupon another Kindred; in this case, the subject must lie in the water, \nhaving opened his own veins, while the thaumaturge chants for the \ncourse of the night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nKindred with no blood in their bodies are ravenously hungry; a source of \nblood should be immediately on hand or else the vampire might frenzy \n(Kindred with low Self-control are particularly dangerous after this ritual has \nbeen completed for this reason). \nCraft Dream Catcher (Oneiromancy) \nBy incorporating Native American beliefs with their own ageless \narts, oneiromancers both create a portal into a target’s dreams and \nguard them against hostile spirits. A Dream Catcher is an intensely \npersonal talisman composed of the target’s hair, spittle, blood and \nother sympathetic links. Owners of these “shields” are afforded more \nprotection against any ghostly attack (spirits trying to adversely affect \nthe owner are two Traits down to do so); also, the oneiromancer who \ncrafted the artifact is granted a two-Trait bonus when affecting its \nowner with that path, while other oneiromancers attempting to do so \ntake a two-Trait penalty. This power lasts until the artifact is lost, \nstolen or destroyed. \nThe Curse Belated \nThis ritual is used to safeguard particularly precious ghouls against \nuntimely death, especially when they are being considered for Em- \nbrace. By increasing the power of the vampiric blood running through \nhis thrall’s veins, the ritualist all but insures the mortal’s survival; \nthe instant a ghoul under this spell dies (in any way) the infused vitae \nin her body will revive her as a Kindred within 10 minutes (ghouls \nwho die in a particularly mangled state should probably be given the \nFlaw: Permanent Wound or something else appropriate when they \nreturn as Kindred). To cast this ritual, the thaumaturge willingly \nloses one permanent Blood Trait, which is returned to the caster’s \nblood pool when the ghoul dies. The inaccessible Blood Trait re- \nmains in the ghoul’s system and may not be used to power Disciplines \nor be lost in any way. If someone else attempts to Embrace the \nenspelled ghoul, the mortal will revive as a Kindred - \nas the childe \nof the thaumaturge who cast the spell. The thaumaturge must brand \nthe target ghoul with his sigil, which disappears when the ghoul \nawakens as undead. \nInfirm Inert \nOne of the most powerful properties of a Kindred’s vitae is its ability \nto heal the vampire of nearly any trauma; this ritual deprives a Kindred of \nthat advantage, rendering her impotent to close her wounds. The \nthaumaturge must first imbibe a small quantity of blood laced with \nlaudanum (which will grant the caster the Negative Physical Trait \nLethargic for the scene immediately following the casting); after that, he \nonly need smear a tiny bit of his blood onto the victim’s skin to bestow the \ncurse upon her for the rest of the evening. The target may not be aware of \nthe change until she first attempts to heal. She may spend a Willpower \nTrait to negate this effect for one turn. When the ritual expires, she may \nheal as normal, according to the level of damage. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMajor Creation (Path of Conjuring) \nWhile the Path of Conjuring is limited with regard to the size of the \nitems created, this ritual gives the conjurer more range. It requires the \ncaster to sever her thumb (requiring the expenditure of a temporary \nWillpower); the digit disappears when the enlarged item is successfully \nconjured, although it will regenerate at a normal rate. After this ritual is \ncast, the thaumaturge may now spend either two or three temporary \nMental Traits to make a summoned item either double or triple the size he \ncan normally conjure. Note that this ritual works in conjunction with \nwhatever power of the path the caster is using (so combining this with \nSummon The Simple Form will still only enable basic items to be conjured, \nbut now they can be bigger basic items). \nOnce the thumb is consumed by the ritual, the thaumaturge can no \nlonger create enlarged objects until the ritual is recast. \nReturn of the Heart (Path of the Blood’s Curse) \nThis ritual overwhelms the target with human guilt. By mixing a Trait \nof the victim’s blood with the tears of an infant, the thaumaturge forces \nthe victim to reflect upon her past actions through the eyes of an \ninnocent. While this does not affect a Path rating, the Cainite behaves for \nthe rest of the evening as if she had a Morality rating of 5 and is governed \nby the Path of Humanity. This will probably result in several Conscience/ \nConviction Virtue tests, at the Storyteller’s discretion. This power is \nparticularly terrible against Sabbat elders, who may be destroyed by their \npackmates for such “weakness.” \nScry \nThe thaumaturge causes a body of water, whether natural or \nartificial, to become a scrying pool after mixing it with owl’s blood. \nThe water must be relatively still, and confined pools no larger than \na bathtub work better than open lakes. The caster can either concen- \ntrate on a known location he has visited or a person; if spying upon \na person, the ritualist must possess an object of personal significance \nto the target. Auspex or other powers may not be used while Scrying \nto “remotely” affect the victim. The thaumaturge may not change the \ntarget of the Scry once cast; for example, if the focus is a location, it \nwill remain locked on that area for the duration of the ritual. This \npower lasts for 10 minutes, although viewing time may be lengthened \nby the expenditure of one temporary Mental Trait for each additional \n10 minutes. \nStolen Kisses \nThaumaturges use this macabre power when they do not wish to, or \nare unable to, feed by fang. By making a small incision on her body and \nperforming the ritual (which requires that the thaumaturge always carry \na “witch’s kiss” - \na thistle steeped in vampiric vitae), the ritualist seals \nthe self-inflicted wound into an undetectable mouthlike sucker which \nonly opens when pressed against a mortal’s warm flesh, and which can \nmystically drain blood from the vessel. Warlocks feeding in this manner \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nquietly steal one Blood Trait every other turn from the time the contact \npersists. Particularly lascivious thaumaturges will create this orifice to be \nused during sexual contact, thus combining both the passions of life and \nundeath; more conservative Warlocks prefer a lengthy firm handshake. \nWhatever the medium for exchange, vessels will not be immediately \naware of their blood loss (although they will suffer the usual health \neffects); this particularly tidy method of feeding causes neither the rapture \nof the Kiss nor any immediate discomfort to the vessel. The “mouth” will \nlast until sunrise. \nTelecommunication \nIn these nights, precocious Tremere are relying more on electronic \ndevices than the animal spies and familiars of yesteryear. With this \nritual, any television the thaumaturge has touched in the last week may \nnow be used as both an “eye” into the room as well as a device for \nbeguiling those watching the set. The thaumaturge, by performing this \nritual and dropping into a meditative state, may observe everything from \na “television’s-eye-view” and can also regulate any images or sounds the \ntelevision generates, from changing the channel to crafting a fake \nbroadcast. This power lasts for 10 minutes from the completion of the \nritual, although it may be prolonged for an extra 10 minutes per \ntemporary Mental Trait spent. While in this meditative state (which \nmay be broken at any time, also breaking the ritual), the caster may not \ninitiate challenges. \nA Touch Of Nightshade \nThis ritual allows the thaumaturge to poison a single victim with but \na slight touch. The caster must anoint his hands with the bitter extract \nof deadly nightshade before conducting this ritual. Anytime after the \nritual, anyone the caster touches with his bare hands will become \npoisoned; this weakness lasts until sunrise and inflicts one health level \nof bashing damage (not halved) per hour to Kindred and one health \nlevel of lethal damage to mortals. The caster may not reverse these \neffects; once the victim is poisoned, it must run its course. This poison \nmay not be treated by medical means or by “burning” the blood in a \nKindred’s body. The effects of the poison will not transfer if the victim’s \nblood is drunk. \nTrack Transgressor \nDeveloped as a means for Tremere to track down those non-clan Kindred \nwho have managed to learn the secrets of Thaumaturgy, this ritual makes the \ntarget’s most recent footsteps visible to the caster. By uttering mystical \nsyllables and spilling a Trait of her vitae upon the ground where the infidel \nis known to have worked Thaumaturgy within the past 24 hours, the caster \nmay then be able to track the magus for the rest of the evening. This tracking \nfollows the exact path the other magus took after leaving the area where the \nmagic was worked. This ritual may only track down Thaumaturgy, not \nNecromancy or other kinds of blood magic, and does not distinguish between \nTremere and non-Tremere. \n\\ \nI \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWard Versus Fae \nThe fae are not nicknamed “The Wild Ones” erroneously; the \nTremere developed this ritual to keep the Fair Folk from interfering \nwith their affairs. While most modern Tremere scoff at the notion of \nfaeries, this ritual lurks in faded tomes and forgotten libraries still. It \nis cast in much the same way as Ward Versus Ghouls (with identical size \nrestrictions), except that a handful of cold iron filings is used in lieu of \na Trait of blood. \nA D  \nV A N  CB D TH \nAU M ATU R G  I CA L RI T U  A LS \nCobra’s Favor \nEchoing the curse laid upon the Assamites, elder Tremere created this \nritual to make their vitae so poisonous that it would burn anything living \nit touched. After combining one Trait of her blood with a brew of toxic \nherbs and snake venom, the thaumaturge then recites a complicated \nincantation over it, calling upon the spirit of all things baneful. After this, \nthe concoction turns a fetid black, and the ritualist must ingest the elixir \n(suffering a level of unsoakable aggravated damage). For one full month, \nthe thaumaturge’s blood turns to a deadly poison and inflicts one level \naggravated damage per Trait to anyone ingesting it. Needless to say, this \nmakes creating ghouls or childer near impossible. \nCourt Of Hallowed Truth \nOnce created for Tremere tribunals, this ritual has seen much wider \nuse in these treacherous nights. Indeed, princes who know of this ritual \noften call upon the Tremere to cast it for them, and the Tremere will, of \ncourse, oblige - \nfor the right price. By placing a pair of crossed bones \nbefore every entry into a room (including windows), the ritualist weaves \na powerful magic through the chamber. While this ritual is in effect, no \nfalsehood may be spoken within the room regardless of how much the \nspeaker wishes to deceive, and direct questions from the presiding judge \nor power must be answered completely candidly, with no creative omis- \nsions. This power lasts for a single night in the room, after which it must \nbe cast again to be effective. \nPrinces who rely too heavily upon this power quickly lose the respect of \ntheir peers and become ridiculously indebted to the Warlocks, not to mention \neroding their own power-bases. Most Kindred resent such heavy-handed \ntactics and may refuse to attend meetings where this will be used. \nSevered Hand \nDeveloped during the Dark Ages, this ritual forms a particularly \neffective method of punishment for Kindred who have transgressed, \nbut have not been deemed worthy of destruction. Use of this powerful \nrite (which requires an entire night of preparation) prevents a Kindred’s \nsevered appendage from healing normally, even if they attempt to re- \nattach the body part. The thaumaturge must possess the severed body \npart (which may be a hand, arm, foot, eye, tongue or anything else) and \nhave lengthy access to the victim’s stump (or socket, or... ). By \nswabbing both pieces with volatile and mysterious compounds, the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthaumaturge ensures that the Kindred becomes permanently maimed. \nKindred affected in this way will have an appropriate Flaw given to \nthem by the Storytellers (such as One Arm, Bad Sight, Mute, etc.); the \nappendage may not be regenerated by any means short of supernatural \nhealing (such as Obeah). \nStone Of The True Form \nThis ritual forces the transformation of any form-altering creature back \ninto its natural state. By coating a small pebble in one Trait of his vitae, the \nthaumaturge creates a talisman capable of rendering even enraged Garou \nunable to shift their shape at will. Anyone touched by the pebble (which is \ngood for one use) must assume his “natural” shape; Garou shift to their breed \nform, Gangrel using Protean are forced into their usual vampiric shape \n(including the temporary loss of Wolf Claws), a Nosferatu’s Mask of 1000 \nFaces vanishes, and Tzimisce altered through Vicissitude return to the shape \nthey had at the time of their Embrace. The Warlock must successfully touch \nthe target with the pebble, probably requiring a Physical Challenge; the \nvictim’s inability to change form lasts for a scene, after which they may \nresume their shapeshifting. \nStone Slumber \nInspired by the Gargoyles they kept enslaved for so long, this ritual \nenables Warlocks to transform their bodies into solid stone, becoming \ncompletely immune to most of the dangers they might face during the day. \nThis ritual is highly precise - \nany mistake might result in that morning being \nthe last sunrise the thaumaturge will ever see. \nBeginning exactly one hour before sunrise, the thaumaturge first \nsmears her body with the blood of a 12-hour-old corpse. Then, she must \nstand completely still in an open area, facing east. If the ritual has been \nperformed correctly, she turns to stone as the sun’s rays strike her. In this \nform, the Kindred is completely protected from all forms of physical \ndamage, most types of flame (including sunlight) and heat (unless the \nheat is great enough to melt rock, such as lava). Telepathy and other \nmental Disciplines are useless, as the thaumaturge’s mind is dormant. The \nKindred is not aware of her surroundings during this time, will not dream, \nand will wake 10 minutes after sunset that evening, although she must \nspend an additional Blood Trait to rouse herself. \nM A S T E R  T H A U M A T U R ~ I C A L  \nRITUAL \nRefined Digestion \nThis powerful curse gives even the weakest neonate a Methuselah’s \nhunger for Kindred blood. Cainites affected by this ritual can now \ngain no nourishment from mortal blood. To cast this ritual, the \nthaumaturge first requires five Traits of the victim’s blood, which he \nmixes with five of his own. Then the ritualist must spend a permanent \nWillpower Trait, after which time the victim is afflicted with this \nhunger for a month’s time. Such a curse may be a death sentence for \nthe unfortunate Kindred as such hungers are seen as a step away from \nthat most forbidden of thirsts. The ritualist may reverse this effect \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nwith an additional five Blood Traits from the victim and all the blood \nfrom a normal mortal. \nASCENDANT \nT H A U M A T U R ~ I C A L  \nRITUAL \nEyes Of The Ever Vigilant \nThe original (and extremely powerful) version of this ritual is the \nmainstay of the most clandestine of Tremere chantries and strongholds; \nthis weaker version has trickled its way down into more ubiquitous usage. \nFew outside Clan Tremere even know of its existence as it is a fairly recent \naddition to the Tremere libraries. Successful casting of this ritual requires \nthree thaumaturges to perform the incantations. During the five-night \nritual, the eyes of seven vampires who have lied to any of the three \nthaumaturges casting the ritual must be dropped into an alchemical \ncompound, which is boiled away through the ritual. The ritual enchants \none structure (one haven, one building - a multi-building campus \nrequires multiple rituals). After that, Kindred within the structure are \nunaffected by Obfuscate and Chimerstry. Should an Obfuscated Nosferatu \nattempt to cross the threshold of a place under this ritual, the Discipline \nfails. This power lasts for a year; if it is to be re-dedicated, one of the elder \nWarlocks present at the initial casting need only recite the original \nincantation to empower it for another year. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTH \nB We E K o E N I ~  \nHTMARB s \nThe Week of Nightmares shakes the supernatural denizens of the \nWorld of Darkness, reminding most Kindred that there is much more \nto unlife than even they see. In short, the Ravnos Antediluvian \nawakens, battles three of the most powerful Cathayans, and is finally \ndestroyed by the combined (though not allied) power of those \nCathayans and the Technocracy, after which the Ravnos as a whole \ngo mad, attempting to slaughter each other. For those who have made \na study of the mythology of the Kindred, these events point toward \nthe arrival of Gehenna. This is not a local affair, though; when a \nbeing as powerful as the Antediluvian awakens, the ramifications are \nfelt across the globe. \nThis section is divided into four sections. The first section presents \nan overview of what actually happened, both at ground zero and across \nthe globe, how it fits into the World Of Darkness’ grand story arc and the \naftermath. It looks at who was left standing, who met their final death \nand other such concerns on the large scale. The second section offers \nMind’s Eye Theatre systems for handling the effects of the Week of \nNightmares on the local scale across the globe. The third section delves \ninto how you can shepherd your own chronicle through the Week of \nNightmares, inviting your players to be perplexed and shaken by events \nfar larger than they are. The last section looks at the long-term effects \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nof this event, how they can affect a chronicle and possible directions for \nnew storylines and themes. \nWHAT HAPPENS \nOEESTAC~E \nGround zero for the Week of Nightmares is Bangladesh - \nsouth of \nChina and east of India. In official World of Darkness chronology, these \nevents take place in July 1999. Wise Storytellers will keep their players’ \ncharacters away from Bangladesh at this time. \nACT ONE: THE \nE I R S T A N D  SECOND \nNIGHTS \nThe Ravnos Antediluvian - known by some as Churka and \nothers as Ravanna - \nawakens in Pakistan, drawn by the blood of its \nchilder spilt in their battles with the Cathayans. The Antediluvian \npromptly slakes its millennia-old thirst on those of its Methuselahs \nthat are available. \nSince the awakening of an Antediluvian is a mystical event of \ngrand magnitude, its spiritual reverberations are felt across the world \nby those open to such experiences. Vampires (as well as the rest of the \nworld) experience nightmares during their slumber. They can remem- \nber nothing when they awake, but instead have a sense of missing \nsomething important. They are ill-tempered and edgy. Psychics, the \nmentally ill and other sensitive beings across the globe experience \nspontaneous and uncontrollable visions of these events, but such \nvisions are allegorical and oracular in nature rather than providing \nexplicit news of what is transpiring. \nThree Cathayan bodhisattvas (the most powerful of Cathayans), recog- \nnize the situation for what it is and move with their acolytes and allies to \nintercept the antediluvian. \nA C T  Two: THE THIRD \nN I C ~ H T  \nOn the third night, the Antediluvian and the three bodhisattvas meet in \nbattle. One of the Cathayans summons forth a hurricane, both as a weapon \nand as a shield against the sun so they can continue the fight into the \nBangladeshi day. Another weakens the Gauntlet and calls forth the creatures \nof the spirit worlds to aid in the battle. Thousands of Bangladeshis die in the \nresultant flooding. \nThe Technocracy has taken note of these developments and responds \nby declaring Code Ragnarok - \nan alert condition that results from a threat \nto the entire planet. They bring giant solar reflector satellites to direct and \nconcentrate the light of the sun upon the site of the battle. They also fight \nthe hurricane with their techno-magical aircraft, and finally, they dropped \na handful of Hellstorm neutron bombs - \nmagically enhanced nuclear \ndevices - \non the battlefield. \nThe battle with the three Cathayans weakened the Antediluvian. \nThough the nearby nuclear detonations kills the bodhisattvas as well as all \nother beings in the area, it further weakens the Antediluvian enough that \nwhen the clouds part, the light of four suns, reflected by the satellites above, \nshine down and obliterate it. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAcross the world, the nightmares and visions continue, though \nthroughout the battle, the visions tell of the strange and terrible fight \nrather than just warning of the awakening of the Antediluvian. All \nvampires continue to feel irritable. In addition to the global effects, all \nRavnos experience a sympathetic accord with their progenitor’s anger and \npower. They find their mastery of Chimerstry to be both more powerful and \nless predictable. Additionally, the Beast is stronger within them, making \nthem more prone to frenzy. \nA C T  T H R E E :  THE EOURTH T H R O U C ~ H  \nSEVENTH \nNIGHTS \nThe Antediluvian dies early in the morning on the fourth day - \nnear \nsunset in Europe, in the middle of the day in the Americas. The hurricane \nover Bangladesh dissipates, and rescue and recovery operations begin. For \nmost creatures, the world seems to return to normal: Those who are \ntrapped in visions abruptly recover, and the unnatural nightmares fade \ninto the past. \nFor the Ravnos, the horror has just begun. Each Ravnos hears the \ndeath cry of the Antediluvian, full of wrath and hunger. The creature’s \nfinal act before it meets its Final Death is to send a command to all its \nchilder to hunt each other down and destroy each other, purging the \nworld of all its progeny. This affects all Ravnos, regardless of sect \naffiliation, blood bonds, Vaulderie, torpor or any other conditions. In \nareas where there is only a solitary Ravnos, that vampire need only \ncontend with the unnatural hunger, but should one Ravnos meet \nanother, each is consumed by an overwhelming, cannibalistic bloodlust \nand attacks on sight. Over the next three nights, the Ravnos slay each \nother, and then the curse abruptly fades away, leaving confusion, \nsuspicion and very few Ravnos. \nT H E  EPILOC~UE \nThree days after the Final Death of the Ravnos Antediluvian, the last \nof the mystical effects of the Week of Nightmares fade. The surviving \nRavnos lose their abnormal bloodlust. Most Kindred return to unlife as \nusual, though some, those who have an inkling of understanding of the \nevents and those who realize that they do not, find reason to question the \nvalidity of the status quo. \nAll told, the Week of Nightmares racks up quite a body count: The \nRavnos Antediluvian and three of the most powerful Cathayans are \nthe most noteworthy casualties. Over a million mortals and uncounted \nsupernatural beings in Bangladesh die from the hurricane, the battle \nand the Technocracy’s Hellstorm devices, though the supernatural \nnature of these events is quickly covered up. Beyond Bangladesh, most \nof Clan Ravnos fall prey to each other following the dying curse of \ntheir ancestor - \nby the end of the week, there are perhaps a hundred \nRavnos left in the world, none of whom are elders. All of this happened \nwhen a single Antediluvian rose. The question remains: What might \nhappen when the rest awaken? \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWHAT HAPPENS \nONSTAC~E \nThe events of the Week of Nightmares are of such mystical gravity that \nthey are felt across the globe in one form or another. This section offers \nsystems for letting these effects manifest in a chronicle. \nT H E  E I R S T A N D  SECOND \nN I C ~ H T S  \nDuring this period, everyone is on edge. Handle this as you feel is \nnecessary for your vision of the Week of Nightmares. If you want the \neffects to be more subtle, perhaps rule that vampires do not receive any \nspecial penalties due to their edginess, but these feelings should be \nroleplayed - \nwhich may lead to more situations where Virtue Tests are \ncalled for more than usual. Particularly harsh Storytellers may rule that \nall characters have gained the Nightmares Flaw (Laws of the Night \nRevised, p. 117), imposing a one-Trait penalty on all characters for all \nchallenges. Even if the penalties seem to cancel out for most non-Static \nChallenges, you might rule that all characters must bid at least two \nTraits in order to have a chance of winning. As the price of losing rises, \neveryone gets more desperate. \nAdditionally, Kindred or mortals who possess a Merit such as Oracular \nAbility or at least three derangements experience involuntary visions of the \nawakening of the Antediluvian and its call to its childer and grandchilder. \nFreeing oneself from these visions requires expending a Willpower Trait, \nand even then, this freedom only lasts for a scene as the psychic pressure \nfrom this cataclysm is too powerful to be held back for too long. The \npossession of Auspex has no effect on these visions, and Malkavians gain no \nspecial insight into this matter or likelihood of experiencing visions through \ntheir brand of insanity. \nT H E  T H I R D  \nN I G H T  \nFor most beings, the third night is the same as the first two: Unease for \nmost, overwhelming visions for the few. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRavnos, on the other hand, all receive three extra levels of Chimerstry \nfor the duration of the battle. These levels may ignore generational limits \nas the forces the Antediluvian calls forth alter the rules of the game for all \nits childer. You may also increase or decrease the difficulty of any uses of \nChirnerstry to reflect the changingfortunes of the battle. At the beginning \nof each scene, you may decide to assign from one to five bonus or penalty \nTraits to any use of Chimerstry. \nAdditionally, the Ravnos suffer a one-Trait penalty in all Virtue Tests. \nFinally, should a Ravnos frenzy during this time, he need not expend any \nWillpower to use any of his Chimerstry powers. \nT H E  \nE O U R T H T H R O U ~ H  \nSEVENTH \nN I ~ H T S :  \nFor most vampires, everything seems to return to normal. The edginess \nfades, the visions go away. Vampires can concentrate on their usual problems. \nFor the Ravnos, things get worse. With the death of the Antedilu- \nvian, each Ravnos must make a successful Self-Control/Instinct Static \nChallenge or enter a cannibalistic frenzy. Ravnos of 12th generation or \ngreater make the test at a difficulty of two Traits; Ravnos of 1 l t h  to \neighth generation make it at a difficulty of three Traits; and those of the \nSeventh Generation or lower perform it at four Traits. The vampire \nmust make this test each time she awakens and each time she encounters \nanother Ravnos - \nthis thirst is not affected by any form of disguise or \nnot knowing the other Ravnos’ clan. The Blood knows who is Ravnos, \nand that is enough. \nCRITICAL \nANALYSIS \nSo the Ravnos Antediluvian awoke, had a fight and met its Final Death \ntwo continents away. How does this affect a specific, active chronicle? \nUltimately, the answer depends on you the Storyteller and the \nnature of the chronicle you’re running. If you and the players are \ngetting enough enjoyment and drama out of nepotistic politics, back- \nstabbing and the night-to-night trials and tribulations of maintaining \nthe Masquerade, jockeying for position in their home city or wiping \nout the Camarila sissy-boys, then you may want to think twice about \nadding a complication as large as this one. If the chronicle is moving \nsmoothly - from your perspective, not necessarily the players’ - \nalong some great story arc toward a major revelation of your own \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ndevising, you probably don’t want to toss this new element into the \nmix - \nat least not yet. O n  the other hand, if the chronicle is just \ncoming out of a major story arc and you’re looking for a something new \nto shake your players out of their self-congratulatory (or self-pitying, \ndepending on how they fared) denouement, this could be what you \nwant. The Week of Nightmares adds to the mythic dimension of the \nvampiric experience, and if you want to see that facet of unlife \nenhanced, the Week of Nightmares could offer a rewardingly ominous \nportent of things to come. And it may be just what you need if you want \nto remind your players that it is a World of Darkness, not just a City of \nDarkness or if you just want to throw some chaos into one or two of \nyour elders’ carefully laid plans. \nOne other point to consider is the potentially fatal effect of the Week \nof Nightmares on any Ravnos in the chronicle. Laws of the Night Revised \n(p. 55) includes an explicit warning of the tenuous situation of the \nRavnos, though it treats the Week of Nightmares as already having \npassed. And, of course, if the chronicle’s timeline presumes that these \nevents have already occurred, it’s unlikely that they will happen again. \nCareful Storytellers may want to reflect on the plight of any Ravnos they \nhave in the chronicle before they commit themselves to the Week of \nNightmares -or \nthey may want to set the carnage in motion and let the \ncards fall where they may. \nDespite all these warnings and caveats, incorporating the Week of \nNightmares into a chronicle can be a very rewarding experience for a skilled \nand ambitious Storyteller. Rather than present a precise recipe for telling this \nstory, this section examines some of the situations and their potential effects \non a Mind’s Eye Theatre chronicle \nOfficial World of Darkness canon places the Week of Nightmares in \nJuly 1999, and all subsequent sourcebooks reflect that chronology. \nUnless the chronicle has not caught up to the present or you feel the \nneed to run a flashback adventure, you’ll probably want to adjust the \ntime to bring it into line with your own chronicle. In most cases, there \nwill be no serious repercussions to doing this; however, you might need \nto coordinate with the Storytellers of any other groups your troupe \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ninteracts with to see that any possible conflicts in storyline are as \nseamless as possible. \nIn general, it is more important that you time the Week of Nightmares \nto fit well into the chronicle. I t  should not arbitrarily steal the thunder \nfrom a player who is trying to accomplish something, though it may be \nused to knock down a character whose self-importance or hubris has \ngotten out of hand. Under most circumstances, it should not be inter- \njected at a time of extreme confusion - \nunless you’re looking to create an \natmosphere of extreme pandemonium. In the end, the decision of the \ntiming of the Week of Nightmares has to be left in the hands of the \nStoryteller; you knows the chronicle’s direction, the troupe and how they \nwork together best, after all. \nU P T O T H E  \nK N E E S O R  U P T O T H E  \nTHROAT? \nSo you decided to incorporate the Week of Nightmares into your \nchronicle. All right, then - \nthe first thing you need to determine is how \ndeeply it will affect your city, or whatever the setting of your chronicle is. \nIf there are no Ravnos nearby, no one consults the oracles regularly, and \nno one pays any attention to the rantings of the local asylum inmates and \nstreet people, your entire troupe could get through the Week itself with only \na little tension and a bit more bickering. This does not mean that they escaped \nthe long-term effects of the Week, only that they missed out on the opening \nsalvo. If, at the opposite extreme, the city has an enclave of Ravnos, a chantry \nof oracular Noddist scholars and a cunning Malkavian who takes his institu- \ntionalized comrades very seriously, the prince and the Storyteller will have a \nlot on their hands. \nIn addition to the universal edginess, there are a few obvious \nareas where the events of the Week of Nightmares could directly \naffect the Kindred of any given city. All vampires, supernatural \nbeings and mortals will be edgy from the nightmares and the psychic \nfallout from the rising of the Antediluvian, but in many locations \nthere will be other, more noticeable symptoms. First, and most \nobviously, come the Ravnos. If there are Ravnos in the city, or a \nneighboring city, the Kindred will probably hear of or experience at \nleast some of the side effects of the Antediluvian’s wrath firsthand. \nThe second prominent phenomenon is the eruption of spontaneous \nvisions among any who have any sort of sensitivity to the winds of \nfate. This can range from an prophesying Tremere primogen to \nKindred who notice that a lot of the local crazies are spouting the \nsame gibberish. Next there are Contacts, Allies and areas of influence \nwho may provide information that something peculiar is going on \nand call for a second opinion. Finally, there is the mundane media in \nall its glory, feeding the characters local color, red herrings and a \nskewed view of the big picture. Each of these can contribute, detract \nor confuse the experience of the Week of Nightmares in a chronicle, \ndepending on how you employ them and how much they come into \nplay in the chronicle’s city. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThough it is not apparent early on, the Ravnos are the stars of the \nlocal drama during the Week of Nightmares. Whether there are \nRavnos, and how many are present if there are, will have a major \nimpact on how the Week plays out. Without them, it may come across \nas a spooky interlude where some Kindred began speaking in tongues \nand evoking bizarre imagery. If there is but a single Ravnos, it may \nappear that the stress of the week got the better of him, making him \neven less rational than usual. Though that’s not entirely unexpected, \nthe Ravnos always have been a little less than civilized, after all. If \nthere are more than one Ravnos in the city, you can expect to have \na battle on your hands. They may have been the closest of compadres \n(when they weren’t stabbing each other in the back), but the force of \nthe Antediluvian’s dying curse will set them at each others’ throats \n- \nliterally. Expect fatalities. By the end of the Week of Nightmares, \nthere will likely be at most one Ravnos in the city; having no \nsurvivors of that doomed clan is also a possibility. Even if Ravnos \nsurvive, they will likely have earned the prince’s wrath, almost \ncertainly by breaking the Masquerade in their bloodlust, possibly \neven through diablerie. Once the Week of Nightmares begins, the \nStoryteller has to accept that all the Ravnos in her chronicle will \nprobably have very short unlives. \nThe next area of impact is those creatures and people who have \nsome level of psychic sensitivity. You have full power to determine \nwho is affected by the psychic turmoil and who is not. In general \nterms, any and all oracular beings will find themselves fully in the \nthrall of the visions. Even if there is no vampire blessed (or cursed) \nwith oracular powers in the city, those who are less in tune with \nconsensual reality may find themselves tapping into the situation in \nBangladesh. Many of the city’s insane, whether in asylums or on the \nstreets will rant about the events. Alarmingly, there will always be a \nfew people who had seemed completely normal who will start speak- \ning of the tiger preparing to strike the ten-headed king. At your \ndiscretion, certain drugs may put the user in touch with the battle; \nthis could certainly get the attention of any Setites in the city. Such \nmeans are probably untrustworthy and confusing, though, even more \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nso than the “regular” auguries. You might also want to give any \nRavnos a better chance to receive the visions, or to have such visions \nmanifested in spontaneous eruptions of Chimerstry - even more \ndeadly during the phase when their powers are enhanced. \nRemember that Auspexdoes not allow any special insight into these \nevents. The thaumaturgical Path of Spirit Manipulation may grant some \ninformation from whatever spirits the thaumaturge can reach, but such \ninformation is likely to be every bit as confusing as that coming from the \npeople experiencing visions. If you feel it’s necessary, you might allow \nsome thaumaturgical rituals to shed a little light on what is going on - \nor you may rule that the all-but forgotten ritual in question requires \neight nights of preparation, by which time there is nothing happening \nto spy on.... Malkavians do not gain any particular understanding either \n-they may be subject to the visions if they meet the three derangement \nrequirement, but the forces the Ravnos Antediluvian calls into play are \nnot the same as the madness of the Malkavians. They are as much in the \ndark as the other clans. \nThe third place these events may manifest is through allies and \ncontacts the characters may have. Even if there are no Ravnos in the \nchronicle and no one happens to qualify for visions, there is a good \nchance that someone in the chronicle will have contact with someone \nwho has gotten a closer look at all the weird shit that is happening. \nMentors may express a sudden, uncharacteristic interest in what is \nhappening on the streets. Allies may contact the players with questions \nof their own. Contacts may report bizarre events, or become the source \nof such reports. Quick checks into the character’s areas of Influence may \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nreveal bizarre trends. In most cases, this will be the first indication the \ncharacters have that the weirdness is not another local event - \nanother \ncase of the Tremere botching a ritual or some remarkably potent act of \nDementation. It is up to you to what degree the characters’ contacts will \nbe affected by the Week of Nightmares, but it is safe to say that the \ngreater the number of social backgrounds the character has, the broader \nher source of information. \nVampires with higher levels of Influence are more likely to encounter \nmore alarming, and more informative, reports. In general, characters who \nhave Backgrounds of level four and below will only hear about odd local \noccurrences, and only if they specify that they are keeping an eye out. At \nlevels greater than that, the character may receive information from a \ncommensurately larger spectrum of sources. \nYou may want to consider the sort of information that comes from \nthe different backgrounds. You may decide that the only information \nhaving Political Influence 8 offers is that the UN is trying to get relief to \nBangladesh, but the weather has frustrated them so far, or you may \ndecide that Political Influence 8 reveals that the President’s astrologer is \nmuttering about cranes and dragons just like the neonate who made such \na mess in Elysium last night. In all likelihood, you’ll want to tailor the \nrelease of information for maximum impact and drama. A clever Story- \nteller can tailor the release of information to thrust different characters \ninto the limelight or create some of those strange bedfellows politics is \nsupposed to make. Perhaps all the Noddist scholar’s Occult contacts are \ntoo busy with or confused by these developments to provide anything \nuseful, but there are a couple of High Society performance artists who are \nastonishing the Toreador with their synchronized ranting. Almost any \nBackground offers the potential to produce information, though the \nquality of information should vary dramatically. Bureaucracy Influence \nmay tell the character that calls to counseling hot lines were up 23 \npercent across the tri-state area, but might not offer any relevant details. \nOccult, Health, Church, Media and Street Influences are likely to provide \nthe most appropriate intelligence because of their proximity to the \nunusual and the marginalized, who tend to be more aware of such things. \nEach area brings with it its own skewing of the data, and that skewing is \nvital to maintaining the sense of mystery. \nThe final likely source of information on these events is the \nmortal media. Though hardly as useful as having a man on the scene, \nfor those who do not have allies in Dresden and Influence that spans \nthe globe, the media is often the only source of information on world \nevents. In this case, the coverage may well be limited to the occa- \nsional mention of the unusual typhoon over India - \nprobably hidden \nin the weather section - \nor a human-interest story about a new artist \nwhose works on the Ten-Headed God and the Crane are causing a \nminor sensation in Des Moines. But that is only the mainstream \nmedia, which has traditionally been shaped to maintain the Mas- \nquerade; there are other sources out there for those who know to \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nlook. Small-press and alternative newspapers provide one source, but \nthey rarely have the larger perspective. The Internet is erratic at best, \nbut it is always possible that there is a Web site out there containing \na lone programmer’s complete selection of visions. As before, the \naccuracy, availability and prevalence of this information depends \nupon your needs and your chronicle’s needs. \nT H E  \nV I E W P R O M T H E  \n~ A L L E R Y A N D T H E  V I E W P R O M T H E  \nPIT \nThe next aspect to consider is how the players (and characters) \nreceive their information. Unlike the previous section, which looked at \nthe source of the information in the game world, this section examines \nthe dissemination of the information from Storyteller to player. Much of \nthe experience of the Week of Nightmares will depend on whether the \ncharacters feel that they are at the epicenter of another local crisis or \nexperiencing fallout from some far larger event. Depending on how the \nstoryteller plays it, it is even possible that many of the characters will \nperceive some of the events as a personal attack. Vampires - and \nplayers - \nare a paranoid lot, after all. \nIf you favor a paranoid chronicle, full of mystery and suspicion, you \nmight want to tell each character separately that they feel a little more \nanxious and irritable than usual for no reason that they can put their \nfinger on. This will probably have each character wondering which of \nher enemies and rivals has found a subtle method of getting at her and \nwill probably start a series of quarrels before it becomes apparent that \nsomething is bothering everybody. O n  the other hand, if you want the \nplayers to start out with an idea that they are under the influence of \nsomething larger, you could tell the troupe as a whole that they are \nsuffering from high levels of hostility and anxiety. This will likely let \nthem bypass the someone-is-out-to-get-me stage and start out wonder- \ning what has happened to the city. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThere is also the matter of those in the throes of the visions. If \nO’Malley the Oracle is in the middle of Elysium when the Antedilu- \nvian awakes, everyone present will know that something is happening, \neven if they do not know what. If the only folks in the thrall of the \nvisions are locked in padded cells, then only the Malkavians are likely \nto find out - \nand only when they check in. Of course, since the exact \ntime of the awakening is up to you, you can place it when it best suits \nyour needs. \nFrom there, it is a matter of pacing. You have it within your power to \nshape the availability, reliability and timing of the information the charac- \nters receive, as outlined above. If the chronicle is to focus on disinformation \nand plotting, there is ample opportunity for some of the characters to start \npublicizing false visions and red herrings they wish while they secretly look \nfor the truth on their own. After all, the rising of Antediluvians is strictly \nagainst Camarilla policy, and no prince wants his subjects listening to such \nbalderdash. On the other extreme, if the chronicle revolves around trading \nsecrets and solving puzzles, you can arrange it that the truth really is out \nthere if every one puts it together. This is also the time to consider whether \nthe characters should be fearing the arrival of Gehenna here and now or \ncompletely underestimate how dire the situation truly is, only later realizing \nwhat has hit the fan. \nOnce the Ravnos begin frenzying and going after each other’s blood, \nthings take a different turn. In the Americas, this will happen during the day \n(unless you decides otherwise), so it is unlikely that there will be anyone \naround to realize that they lost it just as all those ranting folks broke free of \ntheir trances. \nNo matter how you want the chronicle to go, you should consider how \nyou introduce the events to your players. A little advance scheming can go a \nlong way toward establishing a desirable feel for the events and keeping the \nplayers in the proper frame of mind. \nPITYTHE \nPOOR \nRAVNOS \nIf there is only a single Ravnos in the chronicle, you could theoretically \nget away with merely the intense hunger, no insane diablerie of clanmates, \nbut that would weaken the strength of the story significantly. Additionally, \nthe power of the hunger is such that a Ravnos would easily feel the urge to \ntravel far and wide to any havens of clanmates he knew of - \nand if he did \nnot, it is always possible that another Ravnos would come after him. So even \nthe solitary Ravnos who manages not to do something regrettable due to the \nhunger could fall prey to the dying curse of his Antediluvian. And if there \nis more than a single Ravnos present, it is almost guaranteed that at best, \nonly one will survive. \nWhat is a Storyteller to do when her chronicle has three Ravnos, and the \nWeek ofNightmares will leave at most one of them standing? While the death \nof a character should never be a trivial event, the emotional response to it \noften extends from the dramatic response within the game to hard feelings \noutside the game. This can be especially true in cases such as the Week of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNightmares where events may seem arbitrarily stacked against a certain group \nof characters - \nRavnos in this case. \nAnother matter you must consider is whether to give the players \nforeshadowing about the deadliness of the situation. This is especially \ntrue in a situation like the Week of Nightmares, where fatalities are \nalmost guaranteed in one segment of the vampiric population while the \nrest face only a marginal increase in their usual nightly danger. This is \na case of deciding what knowledge the player can handle without \nadversely affecting his role in the chronicle. In some cases it is best to tell \nthe player outright that his character stands a good chance of experienc- \ning Final Death in the next couple of sessions. In others, it is better to \nkeep it all under wraps but be prepared for damage control when heads \nstart to roll. If you don’t want to tell the players outright that “there can \nbe only one,’’ another option is to offer some sort of vision. This vision \nneed not be one of the overpowering visions of the Ten-Headed King \nthat will become so common during the Week of Nightmares, but a \nsmaller, more intensely personal vision. If played properly, the character \nmight not even realize when the vision is coming to pass until the week \nis well under way. \nAs with so many situations, the proper handling depends upon the \nplayers and the Storyteller. Below are a few ways of handling this dilemma, \nwhich can be used or combined as you see fit: \nLet the cards fall where they may: Mind’s Eye Theatre \nchronicles take place in the World of Darkness, where life is cheap, \nand so is unlife - \neven immortality does not last forever. You could \nargue that experiencing the unfairness inherent in the system is a \npart of the dramatic process and elect not to cushion the blow in any \nway. A player who lost her Ravnos to the Week of Nightmares is just \nlike any other player who lost a character. This is probably accept- \nable to players who enjoy making new characters or those who truly \nsee their characters as subservient to the story. Others may feel \nrailroaded into a Final Death they could have avoided had they \nchosen a different clan. \nRavnos Death Match: Perhaps even more vicious, you could warn \nthe Ravnos’ players that only one of them will survive an upcoming \nevent. This should only be employed with players who are willing to \ncompete strongly with each other and will not take losing poorly, \neither inside or outside the game. I t  is quite possible that the players \nwill suspect the nature of the upcoming storyline. Hopefully they can \nbe convinced to keep their speculations under wraps, both for the sake \nof the other players and because such knowledge could help them in \nthe coming fight against one another. This option should only be used \nif you believe that this level of mutual antagonism would not trauma- \ntize any of the players involved. \nAll things being equal (and they rarely are), you will likely be able to \nguess who, of a group of Ravnos, will come out on top. In most cases it will be \nthe one with the lowest generation, but it might be the oldestor the best knife- \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nfighter or the one who runs with the Brujah pack. In any case, unless some of \nthe players are willing to take the fall for the sake of the story, it is almost \nguaranteed to be a bad idea to play favorites or try to arrange for a certain \nRavnos’ victory over the others. \nThe Dramatic Exit: Another possible solution involves recruiting \nthe players to take an active role in their characters’ demise. When faced \nwith the certainty of character death, many players will rise to the \noccasion and make certain that the death will be one that is remembered \nfor years. If you believe you have a player who can handle the responsibil- \nity, this can be the most rewarding way of handling the situation. With \nthis option, the player can come to see the story as not just a story about \nunlife in an unfair world, but the epic saga of her demise - \nand a chance \nto “inadvertently” leave her comrades in deep trouble as they must clean \nup whatever mess her death caused. \nThe Consolation Prize: Some players are unwilling to take the death \nof their characters quietly. For some of them, they have invested too much \ninto the character to willingly let it go; others are just munchkins. It may be \nnecessary to offer them some sort of consolation prize, a bribe, to do what \nother players do freely. This prize usually takes the form of special treatment \nfor his next character: “If you don’t create a big stink about dying, I’ll let you \nplay the Camarilla mole you wanted to play.” It usually sets a dangerous \nprecedent to offer bribes in these cases, but if the player is worth it overall, \nor if you want to reward a player who did not ask for compensation but \nplayed her death well, do so. Just remember that future fatalities may expect \nsimilar treatment. \nThe Plant: If there are no Ravnos in the chronicle, or if you feel that \nthe current number of Ravnos is inadequate for the task, there may be \nanother solution. If you have a spare player or aNarrator who has wanted \nto just play a single character for a while, you may introduce more \nRavnos into the chronicle for the sole purpose of enhancing the expe- \nrience of the Week of Nightmares. Any Ravnos brought in for this \npurpose should be warned that their stay will be rather brief, but some \nplayers enjoy playing marginal characters to whom they need not feel \nany real attachment. The introduction of these characters needs to be \ncarefully managed so it is not obvious that they are only being brought \nin to add to the body count. \nA E T E R T H E  \nSHOW \nIt is possible that the Week of Nightmares will come and go before the \nplayers in the chronicle have figured out what is happening - \nquite likely in \nfact - \nunless someone has friends in very high places. Fortunately, the long- \nterm effects of the waking of the Antediluvian are more than enough to make \nthose nights come back and haunt everyone. \nE P I L O C ~ U E  \nEVENTS \nYou the Storyteller have quite a menu of tricks and events you can use \nto drive home the long-term implications in the aftermath of the Week of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNightmares. Whether you deploy these according to a precise schedule you \nprepared in advance, interject them on an ad hoc basis where you feel the \nchronicle could benefit or ignore them completely depends on your designs \nfor the chronicle. Used properly, these elements can make the Week of \nNightmares a dire portent of things to come or a call for planning and \naction; used improperly, they add little more than chaos to an already \nconfused situation. \nRumors from Near and Far: Regardless of the state of the home city \nof the chronicle, rumors filter in from neighboring cities as soon as the \nlines of communication permit. It could come from the mouths of ghoul \ncouriers, secret IRC chat rooms, hushed phone calls, solemn board \nmeetings or any of the hundreds of ways vampires have discovered for \ncommunicating with each other. \nIt is safe to say that the earliest rumors will be the most confused \nand incoherent, but they will also be the least touched by the “official \nversion” of whoever controls the source. As time passes, princes and \nbishops will establish “what really happened” in their domains. You \nmight want to use this as a way of illustrating the mood of the various \nlocations that surround the home city, stressing whichever aspects you \nfind most interesting. Alternatively, you might use the similarity of \nreports from wide-ranging places to impress upon the characters the \nuniversality of their experience. As time progresses, the quality of \nwhat is reported from Sabbat and Camarilla territories will probably \ndiverge, and if the characters have access to information across sect \nlines, you can use this information to highlight the strengths and \nweaknesses of the sects in your chronicle. You may also use it to \nforeshadow power plays or larger changes in sect direction. Though \nmost rumors are just clues or distractions, each one could be a seed for \nsome future development in the chronicle. \nAs time progresses, the stories will probably diverge in three \ndirections: the urban legend, the official story and the carefully re- \nsearched truth. Telling one from the other will, of course, be difficult. \nOf these, the urban legend is probably the most entertaining - \nthat is \nwhy such stories are so enduring. The story of the Ravnos in Glasgow \nwho somehow grew 10 heads and vowed that she would diablerize a \ndifferent vampire with each head and was seen by a Nosferatu only one \ncity away is the sort of tale that could terrorize a neonate. It also \ncontains just that hint of what went on to almost have the resonance \nof truth. Besides, the World of Darkness is a big place, and stranger \nthings have happened .... Other rumors may take the form of con- \nspiracy theories, difficult to disprove, seductively plausible, and pointing \ntoward the creator’s scapegoat of choice. At the other end of the \nspectrum, the official story is probably far less entertaining, but it is \nalso probably a little more comforting. For both Camarilla and Sabbat \nvampires, their respective official stories will justify what they are \ndoing and remind them that they are on the right track - leaders \nalmost always justify the status quo. Naturally, the official story makes \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsense and cover most of the known facts. Conspiracy theories may be \npopular among the purveyors of official truth as well, so long as their \nenemies are at the core of the conspiracy. To do otherwise runs the \nunpleasant risk that the underlings will figure out that their masters \nare lying, which often has inconvenient consequences. Finally, rarest \nof the rare, there will be those vampires who manage to figure out some \nof the truth and carefully spread it to those they feel deserving. As any \nStoryteller knows, there is nothing like the select reporting of accurate \ninformation to keep everyone guessing. \nCamarilla Denial: Clearly it was a massive hoax. Or it was a bizarre \nform of lunacy caused by those thrice-accursed Lupines. Or it was \nnothing at all. \nCamarilla doctrine denies the existence of the Antediluvians and \nspecifically denies that they are going to rise from their torpid slumber and \ndevour all of their descendants. So how does the largest organization of \nKindred on the Earth handle the Week of Nightmares? By denying it, of \ncourse. Accepting that an Antediluvian stalked the Indian subcontinent \nand was able to affect vampires around the world is just too close to Sabbat \ndoctrine. Some princes will offer their own reasonable explanations for \nthe strangeness. Some princes will recognize that there is strength - \nand \nplausibility- \nin numbers and form a united front of disinformation. Some \nprinces will simply claim that what happened was not at all out of the \nordinary. Some of them might actually believe these lies, but many will \nonly be using them to pacify their charges while they frantically attempt \nto come up with some plan to allow their surviving a Gehenna that now \nseems all too close. \nThis dichotomy between what happened and what is said to have \nhappened could result in some serious changes in the night-to-night \noperation of the city. Anyone who publicly argues that an Antediluvian did \nawaken is just asking for correction of one sort or another, and a prince who \nis unable to keep such blatant lies at bay might find his city visited by an \narchon. At the same time the lesser Kindred are being kept in the dark, or \nat least being kept quiet, anyone in the know has motive to hunt down \nwhatever lore she can find. Also, fragments of the Book of Nod and scholars \nthereof stand to become even more valuable, so long as they can keep their \nknowledge from falling into the wrong ears. \nMany of the city’s lesser Kindred may know that something has hap- \npened, but not what. Even a few months of unlife should warn vampires that \nthe elders are not entirely concerned with their well-being and that there are \nenough secrets floating about that it is best to try to unearth the truth before \nit comes after you with fangs and claws. And if the elders are not offering any \nanswers, it is time to look for someone who is. \nSabbat Propaganda: Naturally, the Sabbat wants the word out: The \nAntediluvians are real. We were right. \nIt is never that straightforward, though, even among the Sabbat, \nwho are often stereotyped as simpler than other vampires. While certain \nleaders will want to take this opportunity to gain as many converts as \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\npossible, by whatever means possible, others will want to whip their \ntroops into a battle frenzy and wipe out all the other vampires who might \nbe potential pawns of the Antediluvians. And of course, there will be \nthose who knew all along, but wish that Gehenna could have held out \njust a bit longer so they could have seen their plans to fruition. Sabbat \npolitics are fractious enough without the added pressure of Gehenna \nstarting ahead of schedule. In theory, all Sabbat agree that the \nAntediluvians must be destroyed, but no one seems to agree on who \nshould lead the forces. \nMuch like the Camarilla, the various leaders of the Sabbat will be \ndoing their best to see that the rabble is kept occupied while they try to \nfigure out how best to turn this situation to their advantage. The \nambitious will need to act with greater speed, and the wary will need to \nuse even greater caution. Noddist scholars will almost certainly collabo- \nrate, debate and fight with eachother. Afew will share their information, \nseeking to unravel the truth before it is too late. Others will hoard their \nhard-won knowledge lest it be used against them now that all vampires’ \nnights are numbered. \nAmong the lower echelons, priests who craft new ritae taking the events of \nthe Week of Nightmares into account may find that they have gained greater \nrenown. Pack leaders who lack greater vision will keep their packmates in fighting \nform - \nand try to find a couple good places to hide if it becomes necessary. \nIndependent Curiosity: Perhaps more than any other vampires, the \nindependent clans want to know exactly what happened. In addition to \nthose surviving Ravnos, the four remaining independent clans need to \ndetermine what is happening and what they can do to protect themselves. \nIn most cases, this will involve trying to get as much accurate information \nabout the events of the Week of Nightmares as possible and to do \nwhatever they can to protect themselves and increase their own power. It \nmay involve spying on the other clans to see what they know or what they \nare planning. It may involve trying to create alliances in which neither \nside necessarily trusts the other. Feel free to use this opportunity to \nstrengthen intra-clan ties or allow internal bickering to create chinks in \na previously unified front. \nFor the Assamites, the Week of Nightmares could not only repre- \nsent an inconvenience in fulfilling one of their contracts, it could force \nthem to step up their efforts against the children of Khayyin. Luckily, \nthe increased worries of other vampires should result in a commensurate \nraise in calls for their services. The Gangrel may be expected to retreat \nfurther into the wilderness - at least as well as they can given the \nLupines - \nbut they are a clan of individualists, so it would not be \nunexpected for one or two to be prowling around looking for answers or \nat least clues. Many independent Gangrel may retain loose ties to their \nclanmates within the Camarilla, so they may show up to exchange \nstories. The Gangrel and the Ravnos have stood against each other \nalmost as long there were Gangrel and Ravnos clans. Gangrel may be \ninterested in what happened to their rivals, especially if that rivalry was \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\npersonal; some will want to gloat and rejoice, others will be more curious \nand, naturally, there will be those who are furious that they were \ndeprived of the chance to deal with them personally. Of course, some \nvampires may put two and two together and realize that this all hap- \npened suspiciously soon after Clan Gangrel’s departure from the \nCamarilla: Clan Gangrel must be the instigators of all this madness. \nWhile the Giovanni would seem to be in the best position to obtain \ninformation about the Week of Nightmares using their wraithly connec- \ntions, those wraiths in a position to see what happened were all destroyed \nby the Technocracy’s hellstorm bombs. And though it would seem \nbeneficial having their progenitor as one of the more active members of \nthe Third Generation, rumors about the Harbingers of Skulls are enough \nto keep Giovanni on their toes. It is only natural that the Followers of \nSet would want to use this opportunity to extend their influence over \nthe rest. A confused situation where powerful people want hard-to-find \ninformation is a potential windfall for those who have information to \noffer. It need not be accurate information, of course, just enough to \nencourage dependence or cement an alliance. And while they are \noffering information to those who crave it, the Setites will be seeking \nthe truth for themselves, not that they would ever admit it. \nIn many ways, the plight of the independents is a more honest \nreaction to the Week of Nightmares than the reactions of the Camarilla \nand Sabbat. You can use these reactions as a sort of reality check against \nthe actions of the grand sects, you can use them as extra boogeymen to \nfurther confuse things, or you can just ignore them and concentrate on \nthe clans at hand. \nBacklash against the Remaining Ravnos: The Ravnos, like all vampires, \nhave made many enemies. They have had a reputation as annoying bastards \nfor millennia, and spending a night with more mystic power than usual \nfollowed by half a week of bloodthirsty fratricide has probably not improved \npublic opinion. Some might even blame the entire Week of Nightmares on \nthe Ravnos: They were the most active during it, after all. In the past, \nindividual Ravnos had the protection of their clan. If a prince gave one \nRavnos too much grief, he would soon find that he had more Ravnos dropping \nby than he could handle. \nUnfortunately for the Ravnos, it will not take long after the Week of \nNightmares for people to figure out that there are far fewer Ravnos around \nthan there used to be. And once that happens, some vampires’ thoughts \nwill turn to revenge. The Ravnos who wronged that particular vampire \nmight be long dead, but there are always those who will see any clanmate \nas an acceptable substitute. Fortunately for the Ravnos, it will take a while \nfor most vampires to figure out how complete the devastation is. The \nRavnos have never been popular, so many of them have learned to lie \nabout their heritage. Of course, others just lied for the hell of it. Still, \neventually someone will realize how few Ravnos there are, and the word \nwill spread, and vampires will do what they always have done for the \nunderdog - \neat him. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSome princes or bishops may treat the Ravnos as lepers, others may \nuse them as scapegoats for whatever ails their domains and some may \nclaim to not care but secretly encourage their removal. One or two may \neven take the opposite approach, offering sanctuary to a particular \nRavnos, perhaps any of the clan. After all, it is always useful to have a \nsubject with rare abilities, and the danger outside may actually encour- \nage loyalty in an otherwise treacherous vampire. Some may even have a \nparticular use for a vampire whose Antediluvian has been annihilated. \nRegardless of how things work out in the chronicle’s main city, you may \nemploy the other scenarios at will for neighboring cities or other areas \nthe players visit. \nThe Search for Information: It will not take long for many \nvampires to decide that they need more information. In and of itself, \nthis is not a new development. What will be new is that a large number \nof vampires will actively be searching for ancient lore for the first time \nin their unlives, a situation that opens a world of possibilities for a \ncunning Storyteller. \nOne of the most obvious developments from this turn of events is \nthat vampires who possess such arcane knowledge - \nor are able to \nconvince others that they do - \nwill find a marked increase in their \nperceived importance. They may be courted by princes and primogen, \nbishops and paladins. Some may find this attention and importance \nseductive, a way to social power that they previously lacked, others \nmay find that it gets in the way of their studies. There will be those who \nbelieve they know the truth, but only know false tales spread by others \nwho did not want competition in their quest for knowledge. And, of \ncourse, there will be the charlatans who are adept at sounding pro- \nfound and producing forgeries that tell their audience what they most \nwant to hear. Vampires are not the only creatures that will seek to \nprofit from this situation; there is no shortage of demons that are more \nthan willing to offer information - \naccurate or not - \nto those who are \nwilling to pay the price. \nBeyond the active players, is the information itself: moldy tomes, \nlost fragments of the Book of Nod, ancient manuscripts, recently un- \nearthed icons with strange writing and all such stuff will be in high \ndemand. Depending on the needs of the chronicle - \nor the ingenuity of \nthe players - \nthese could be vital clues or simple McGuffins designed \nto keep the rabble busy. \nGehenna Cults: For centuries, some vampires have believed that the \nkey to surviving Gehenna lies not in universal camaraderie and blind \nacceptance of leadership, but in secrecy and selective solidarity. Some of \nthese secret societies are new developments, spawned by the apparent \napproach of Gehenna; others are centuries, perhaps even millennia old. \nSome have members who span the globe; others are strictly local affairs. \nSome seek to avert Gehenna entirely, others seek defense against the \nAntediluvians, still others seek to curry favor with these ancient crea- \ntures. Some exist only within a given sect, others have members who cross \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsects. Though most have a tiny membership, the only common element \namong Gehenna cults is a covert plan for the members to survive the \nimpending doom in some way. \nThere are two obvious reasons for the aftermath of the Week of \nNightmares to involve Gehenna cults. The first is that many of the \nestablished cults (See Time of Thin Blood, pp. 55-60 for some of the more \nprominent Gehenna cults) will perceive this as a sign that Gehenna is \nnigh and will be very interested in those who seem more involved with \nthese events. Some might take an interest in those who were in the throes \nof visions or even the few surviving Ravnos. Whether this interest takes \nthe form of observation, questioning, thaumaturgical experimentation or \nsomething else entirely depends on the nature of the cult and the \ndesperation - \nor determination - \nof the vampires involved. The second \nform of Gehenna cult involvement occurs when someone takes the events \nof the Week of Nightmares to heart and decides to form her own cult. \nUnless the new cult had some special source of information and a great \ndeal of subtlety, it is probably doomed to failure. The Camarilla disap- \nproves of Gehenna cults for doctrinal reasons, and the Sabbat does not \nwant its members loyal to any organization other than itself. Even if it is \nnot destroyed outright, a new cult stands a good chance of being infil- \ntrated and used as a pawn. Those who are interested in what power and \ninformation the new cult has may monitor it for that reason while \nsomeone who is only interested in keeping track of the dissidents in the \ncity could use it to gather the Noddists together for easier monitoring. \nTHE \nSOLE SURVIVOR \nSo there is still a Ravnos in the chronicle who did not meet Final Death? \nEven the surviving Ravnos are not in the clear. \nThree nights of blood thirst and fratricidal madness can do a lot \nto alienate wherever the survivor calls home. Even without the \nprohibitions against attacking vampires (and diablerie, should the \nRavnos be in a Camarilla city) and drawing the attention of the \nmortals, raving madness is not a popular trait. A Ravnos may recover \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nfrom frenzy only to discover that she is the subject of a blood hunt or \nthere is a Sabbat pack after her, angry about what she did to their \npackmate. And if the Ravnos committed diablerie, she may soon \ndiscover that others can tell merely by looking at her. In fact, if she \nwas in the throes of frenzy while doing the deed, others may discover \nit before she does. \nAlso, there is the lack of support. One of the benefits of belonging \nto a clan is that clanmates will look after their own. Ravnos never had \nthe reputation as the most militant of clans, but other vampires were \ncareful about harassing them too much because it could draw the wrath \nof the rest of the clan. Having a party of trickster vampires arrive in town \nbecause the prince killed one of their sisters was never a pleasant \nsituation. With most of the clan gone, many vampires are looking to the \nsurvivors to redress old humiliations - \nothers just think of it as open \nseason on Ravnos for the fun of it. \nThere are a few potential benefits to being a Ravnos who survived \nthe Week of Nightmares, but they are limited at best. For example, it is \npossible that a Ravnos under the influence of the Antediluvian’s death \ncurse might have managed to lower her generation during one of her \nfrenzied binges. Sadly, the lack of elders of her clan to teach her the \nhigher powers of Chimerstry will probably hinder her studying them. \nAnother possible benefit is the reduced competition for herd space \namong the Gypsies. Unfortunately, many of the Roma are rather leery of \nanyone claiming to be Ravnos, especially after the stories of their three- \nnight bout of madness and blood thirst. Additionally, the Gangrel, \nespecially those who have left the Camarilla might be looking to move \noccupy these openings. Possibly the most useful development for the few \nsurvivors is the potential for anonymity. Ravnos are now so rare that \nalmost no one will believe that the new Lick in town is from that lost \nclan. This leaves the stage open for as much fun as the vampire can get \naway with - \nuntil the work started by her Antediluvian gets taken up \nby the rest of the Third Generation. \nTHE BLACK HAND \nWhen one imagines the organizations of the Kindred world, there are \nthe Sabbat, the Camarilla, the mysterious Inconnu and those vampires \nwho claim to stand outside all sect concerns, but in that act, are them- \nselves parceled into organization - \nthe independent clans, the anarchs, \nthe Autarkis. One, however, has fallen from the great heights of secrecy \nand self-claimed mastery into destruction and diaspora. The passing of the \n“True Black Hand” has reverberated through the Sabbat and into the \nWorld of Darkness itself. \nThere are few certainties regarding the cult - \nafter all, anything that \nhas its origins in human prehistory must be clouded with supposition. \nMost cults rarely leave step-by-step instructions regarding their world \ndomination plans. Even the survivors continue to sweep away their tracks \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nwith rumor and legend. All that remains are fragments pieced together \nfrom the accounts of survivors, describing what is both horror unimagined \nand hubris unchecked. \nThe True Black Hand was said to have sprung up in the ancient \nMiddle East, long past the nights of the First and Second Cities, founded \nby a cult of mortal magicians studying death and the afterlife; some \ncalled this gathering the Tal’mahe’Ra. The early magicians made con- \ntact with Cainites, and the two groups traded knowledge, each attempting \nto understand the other’s craft, without success. Cainites could not learn \nmortal magic nor could the magicians learn Disciplines. In pursuit of \nknowledge, some of the magicians accepted the Embrace at the cost of \ntheir mortal gifts. As the new vampires learned more of the mythology \nbehind their condition and shared their knowledge with their mortal \nbrethren, the cult determined that the loss of the Antediluvians held \nback the world from its potential. Henceforth, the cult would bend its \nentire effort to the revival of the Third Generation, ushering in a new \nage of magical potential under the will of the Antediluvians. In modern \nparlance, the group would be considered a Gehenna cult, albeit one that \nhad both mortal and vampiric followers. \nAs so frequently happens, the Cainites gradually wrested control of the \ncult from the mortal magicians, turning the mortals to serve their own \nschemes. Around 500 BC, the magicians left and founded a society of their \nown devoted to the study of death and fate. Mortal descendants of these early \nwizards tell a vastly different tale of the society’s origins that makes no \nmention of a secret society of vampires; it would seem to be left to outsiders \nto judge which makes a better tale - \nvampires who prefer living in the \nUnderworld or immortal mages who risk a magical backlash should they dwell \nin physical reality. \nWith the cult’s composition and means altered to a Cainite perspective, \nthe vampires expanded their studies, spreading into Europe. They were \nunsuccessful in learning the secrets of mortal blood-magicians, but did \nsucceed in infiltrating mortal instutions. During this era, the cult’s masters of \nvampiric studies created new Disciplines exclusive to their ranks, which \ncontinued to evolve for several centuries to come. \nAround 450 AD, something happened that caused the Tal’mhe’Rah \nto fracture. Survivors debate the reasons for this, and everyone seems to \nhave a particular theory regarding the hows and whys. Some blamed it \non Setite influence, others on the Inconnu or on vampires who were too \nreluctant or eager for the group to study the Underworld. More outland- \nish tales pointed to beings and intelligences from unknowable places \nthat infiltrated the group. Whatever the reason, the cult split into the \nWestern branch (which focused on mortal concerns) and the Eastern \nbranch (which followed a more mystic bent). Somewhere around this \ntime, the group’s Latin name, Manus Nigrum, came into use. As the \ninternal squabbles resulted in more notice, victims and observers termed \nthese half-glimpsed machinators “the Manus Nzgrum”. The name even- \ntually stuck. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Manus Nigrum believed that it could \nprevent vampiric interference (other than its own, of course) of mortal \norganizations by strengthening those organizations. The results were not \nwhat was intended - \nthe Inquisition did benefit from the organization and \nstrength, turning its fury on those careless vampires found hiding in the midst \nof humanity. But it was only the youth (who posed little threat to the Manus \nNigrum) that fed the flames; the elders, the original targets, proved more \ncapable of escape. None in the cult paused to consider that the ensuing \ndisaster could have been of their own making, or that their strategy was \nflawed. Instead, the leaders pressed on, blaming the events on enemies real \nand imagined, and apparently heedless that the vampires avoiding the \nslaughter were the ones who could most challenge the Manus Nigrum’s power \nand control over mortals. \nDOWN \nAMONGTHE \nDEAD \nM E N  \nIn between their attempts to direct the focus of the fire they had \nunleashed, the cult continued with its earlier pursuits into insights of death \nand magic. During an expedition into the Underworld of the dead, Manus \nNigrum explorers encountered the memory of a city that they believed was the \nEnoch of legend, the First City founded by Caine. \nA word of explanation becomes necessary here. The Underworld is \nbelieved to stretch to infinity, below the surface, as it were, of the living \nlands. If one were to enter the deadlands, one would first encounter the \nShadowlands, so called because they mirror the appearance of the living \nworld (albeit through a darker reflection of death and decay). Below the \nShadowlands boils the Tempest, a perpetually raging storm of spirit \ncreated from the debris of emotion and memory of the mortal world. \nOccasionally, islands of calm can be found in this storm, and it was on \none such island that this next crucial piece of the Manus Nigrum’s \nhistory was found. \nWas the city truly the memory of legendary Enoch? After all, things \nof great personal importance can materialize in the Underworld once \nthey’ve been destroyed. Or could it merely have been the sum total of \nvampiric dreams, hopes and fears of Enoch, perhaps the remnants of the \ndreams of the Antediluvians? None could say for certain, but to the \nManus Nigrum, only the first possibility counted. Surely this was re- \nvealed only to the faithful for their own use. The cult’s eldest Eastern \nmembers and more mystically inclined Westerners settled in Enoch and \nmade extensive studies of the city’s treasures, seeking clues to the \nAntediluvians’ purpose. \nDuring the early occupation, the settlers found the tombs of four \nbeings called the Aralu down in Enoch’s foundations. The inscriptions \non the tombs suggested these creatures might be Antediluvians. Over \ntime, the explorers had dreams clearly sent by the Aralu that used \nfamiliar symbols from cult rituals. Though the evidence did not quite \nfit the Antediluvian paradigm, gradually all doubts faded and any \npotential challenges disappeared. The cult became quite certain that \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthis must be Enoch and no other option was possible. None ever paused \nto consider if the Aralu might be shaping the Manus Nigrum to fit their \nown agenda. \nThe city became a headquarters for the cult. Most cultists made at least \none trip there at some point (usually through a ritual involving ceremonial \ndeath) to remind themselves of past glories and to inspire dreams of future \ntriumphs. The passion inspired by the pilgrimage made any troubles getting \nthere worthwhile. \nTHE \nHAND’S E I N C ~ E R S  \nThe Manus Nigrum brought together a very mixed bag of vampires. Like \nother Gehenna cults, its members often claimed to feel alienated from \n“normal” Kindred society and to be possessed of special insights which their \nown clans did not heed. What resulted was several dozen vampires, all \nconvinced of the correctness of their own insights, forming a fractious \norganization where the common goal and their personal goals had little, if \nanything, in common. They squabbled amongst each other almost as often \nas non-member Kindred and were not above stereotyping or blaming each \nother for mishaps. \nThe cult was never very large to begin with. Its sum total membership was \nbetween 150 to 200 vampires (with occasional lapses during crises). With the \nformation of the Camarilla and Sabbat, the cult divided itself between the two \nsects and independent Kindred enclaves. These latter ones made their homes \nin the Middle East, central Asia or India. The cult also attracted non-Kindred \nsupernatural members to its ranks by its studies into the afterlife. Wraiths were \nthe most common of these, followed by death-magicians and other, less well- \nknown creatures. \nThe majority of members came from the following clans and bloodlines: \nAssamite untitribu - A few Assamites helped found the cult and \nrecruited members in the wake of the Tremere curse. They believed they were \nthe protectors of those brethren who flocked to the Sabbat. \nTrue Brujah - \nThis bloodline’s members claimed direct descent from \nBrujah, rather than from Troile, who had diablerized his/her (Troile’s \ngender remains a mystery) sire. The True Brujah differ from their brethren \nin Disciplines and psychology. Some Manus Nigrum members speculated \nthat the bloodline was much younger and had diablerized its way to \nrespectable old age, but such insults usually brought intricately plotted \nrevenge from the offended party. \nGangrel and untitribu - The cult respected this clan as the \nkeepers of the old, pure traditions, and thus good servants of the \nAntediluvians. Gangrel who went to the Camarilla, or City Gangrel, \nwere viewed as traitors. \nMalkavians and antitribu - The cult’s lore claimed that favored \nvampires had received dreams from the Antediluvians, so mystical insights \nwere held in high regard. Any Malkavian might find a place in the cult if he \nfollowed its teachings. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNagaraja - \nThis strange bloodline, known only within the Manus \nNigrum, dates back barely two millennia. The cult had experimented to \nfuse mortal death magic with vampirism; the result was considered a \nperfect fusion of the worst blasphemies of Eastern religions. The Nagaraja’s \nsurvival depended on the most despicable predatory acts, and their very \nunlives cut them off from the cycle of reincarnation. The bloodline can \npractice none of the major tenets of Buddhism or Hinduism, the religions \nof their mortal lives. Whenever the bloodline came to the attention of \nHindu or Buddhist vampires (not to mention moderately devout mortals \nor Kuei-jin), purges inevitably followed. The bloodline found safety only \nwithin the Manus Nigrum. \nNosferatu and untitribu - \nThose Nosferatu who joined the cult usually \ndid so believing they could purge their clan’s sin against Caine without \nactually dying. Caught between suicidal despair and fratricidal rage, they \noften succumbed to their own anguish. \nToreador and untitribu -Toreador \nprovided aesthetic insight to the \ncult’s spiritual teachings and valuable connections to the mortal world. This \nwas particularly necessary in India, where the Nagaraja required extra \nassistance to hide themselves. Such assistance included portraying vampire- \nhunting as superstitious or steering the hunters themselves at other targets, a \ntalent turned against the cult’s rivals. \nOld Clan Tzimisce - \nThis collection of Tzimisce elders believed the \nmain clan had fallen into delusion and rebellion. They blamed the elders of \nthe main clan for allowing the disastrous insubordination and rebellion that \nhad been part and parcel of the Anarch Revolt. Most found havens with the \nManus Nigrum and spent most of their time endlessly scheming to recover the \nclan homelands. \nVentrue and untitribu -The Ventrue brought a sense of hierarchy and \ntradition to the cult, preferring merit and nobility over mere wealth. Their \ngreatest assistance was to bring their own influence among mortals to the \ncult’s needs. \nC ~ H O U L S  \nThe Manus Nigrum took its ghouls from three families. Most ghouls \nserved the cult as long they proved useful, meeting unpleasant ends by dying \nin service or from lack of vitae, which was withheld when they outlived their \nusefulness. A number of newly Embraced vampires within the cult were \nselected from the ghouls’ ranks. \nENRATHI \nThe Enrathi family traces its line back to Etruscan farmers in the time \nof Rome’s early years. As the republic became an empire, the family \ndabbled in the slave trade and found it to be profitable (not to mention \nthey had an unpleasantly good knack for it). Within two generations, the \nEnrathi became slavers instead of farmers. When the empire fell, the \nfamily continued its work - \nthere would always be those who wanted \nslaves, Cainites among them. When slavery was outlawed by convention \nor location, the family developed contacts and an array of tricks to \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncontinue the business. When the Manus Nigrum approached the family \nabout a more extended and permanent relationship, it merely remained \nfor the Enrathi to iron out the details. The family already knew enough \nabout vampiric society to spot a good thing. \nFor over 1000 years, the Enrathi family provided the Manus \nNigrum with some of the finest ghouls, chosen from the family’s own \nranks. Such tasks were not only out among the mortals, but also to \nassist the cult’s vampires and other supernatural members. The most \nfavored among them even grew up in Enoch, tutored by the cult in the \nlands of the dead. \nOne of the cult’s major tenets (and a major sore point for the Enrathi) \nis that no other vampires should interfere with mortals but those of the \nManus Nigrum. The cultists simply believe that no other vampire is more \ncapable of ruling the humans properly than they. A few members find this \nrestrictive, preferring to command the kine and destroy those who dis- \nobey. As such, the Enrathi work quietly and don’t bring up the fact that \ntheir contract with the Manus Nigrum is one of mutual social obligation, \nnot terms of submission. \nWith the opening of the Americas and trans-Atlantic slave trade, the \nEnrathi rose to undreamed-of heights. Through a variety of names and \ndisguises, the family grew to fabulous wealth. Politcal power remained \nbeyond their reach - \ntheir experiments in the 17th and 18th centuries \nwent badly awry when their ghoul natures attracted the attentions of \nwitch-hunters. Since then, the Enrathi have been content to be rich, \nfavored and private. \nMARIJAVA \nThe Marijava family line had associations with vampires as far \nback as early Hindu history. Devout Thuggees appeared in every \ngeneration, supported by their mortal kin with magical studies. \nMarijava ghouls were seeded into the Assamite and Ravnos clans \nwhen the Manus Nigrum came calling. The family rejected the cult’s \novertures, finding the Gehenna cult to be too alien and too obsessive \nto most Marijava. \nAround 500 BC, a branch of the family went into service of the \ncult and disappeared from family records thereafter. Between the cult’s \npenchant for secrecy and the family’s own magical defenses, the new \nManus Nigrum servants never knowingly encountered their mortal kin \nagain. The family turned its attentions to esoteric studies, particularly \nin Indian religion, along with the cult’s vampires, especially the \nNagaraja. The cult’s Marijava maintained vast libraries of theological \nand philosophical writings on Indian mysticism and religion, much of \nit blasphemous. \nThe Marijava’s primary task was to serve the cult as observers of Kindred \nactivity in mortal guises. They spread themselves out across the world into \nblood cults, domains that made heavy use of ghouls and various mortal \nagencies that would allow them to watch Kindred from a distance. Much of \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthe Manus Nigrum’s knowledge about current Kindred affairs came from \nMarijava intelligence. \nNot all of the family provided sound information. Some sold out to the \nSetites or Ravnos, passing false information as bait for unwary cult vampires. \nSome made up details to fill in gaps in their knowledge while others simply \nmade up stories wholecloth. When the traitors were discovered, the cult \npurged these servants and their immediate families; the family as a whole was \napparently too useful to destroy. \nRAPASTIO \nThe Rafastio began serving the Manus Nigrum several centuries before \nthe beginnings of Christianity, practicing the magic of blood and nature for \ntheir vampiric masters. Some cult members claim that the Rafastio family \ngave them a link with the powerful magi called the Verbena, while others find \nthe claim stretched a little thin for credibility. \nThe family traces its ancestry to northern Italy in the Po River Valley. \nMost of them stayed close to the villages and ancestral holdings of their \nforeparents, even into the modern nights. A few family branches moved out \nto the New World in the 19th century, and one group has operated farms in \nKenya since the turn of the 20th century. \nUnlike the Enrathi, the Rafastio have served the Manus Nigrum, \nnever taking a more equal stance. They operated and lived solely at \nthe cult’s discretion. Only rarely would particularly talented mem- \nbers be Embraced; the Rafastio’s service was the sort of magic that the \nEmbrace kills. Though they showed great aptitude for blood magic \nupon their change, the Rafastio were considered far more valuable in \nlife than death. \nMagic was the Rafastio’s sole reason for inclusion in the cult. \nAnything the vampires couldn’t do for themselves, the witches likely \ndid, from potions and mystical wards to bindings and protections. \nThe cult paid them well, but supplemented their payments with \nabuse of all kinds. Some witches attempted to flee, but none escaped, \nand their gruesome fates were left as object lessons to the rest of their \nclan. Such was the price paid for shelter against the encroaching \nFinal Nights. \nNON- \nEAMILY GHOULS \nThe familes occupied special places in the hierarchy of the cult. \nOther ghouls signed on in response to certain needs. At least 20 ghouls \nspent their nights dealing with the storm debris that the Tempest threw \nagainst Enoch, which could include hauling toxic wastes or even “liv- \ning” creatures. Such work was extremely dangerous, with a turnover rate \nof as high as 50 percent during the most violent Underworld storms. \nOthers might spend their time sorting manuscripts in the vast libraries. \nOther than the strange living conditions, these ghouls lived like any \nothers, attending to their masters and working at tasks they might never \nknow the significance of. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n4 \nC H A T T E R L I N ~ S  \nChatterlings came to the Underworld as human children, brought \nby the Enrathi who had kidnapped them and growing up in the lands \nof the dead. As crossing the Shroud could be extremely risky, most of \nthese unfortunates spent years in Enoch before they saw the living \nworld again. They spent their time being instructed in esoteric lore by \nelder vampires and tutored in the ways of the Underworld by wraiths. \nAny other living humans these children saw were either other \nchatterlings or ghouls who had reasons to be in Enoch. The Aralu often \nwalked in the children’s dreams, but what they mumbled very few \ncould understand. \nFew adults are cut out for such a life, and children’s malleable \nminds were no more adaptible. About a third of any given group \nbrought to Enoch went insane before finishing their instruction, and \nup to one-half of the rest perished in Underworld accidents or while \ntrying to cross the Shroud. The rest learned to cope with the nightly \nstrangeness of their situation - \nthe constantly boiling storms of the \nTempest, visits from violently insane Spectres hunting for prey, even \nthe residents of Enoch. They were indoctrinated with the Manus \nNigrum’s teachings, and the Aralu’s whispers confirmed what they \nhad been taught. Fully inculcated, the chatterlings returned to the \nliving world. \nAfter living most of their lives in the colorless, sensory-deprived \nworld of Enoch, many chatterlings were overwhelmed with the mortal \nworld. Some had to turn to smaller doses of humanity while the \nstrongest among them managed to thrive and prosper. These served \nthe cult’s efforts to guide humanity by working from the inside. Most \nchatterlings served for as long they were useful, then perished. Even \ndisapproval from their masters drove some to suicide; there was no life \noutside of the cult and service, and the thought left some unable to \ncope. Even those who were successfully returned knew they were \noutsiders, alien to the rest of humanity. Their secret knowledge forever \nweighed heavily on them. \nOnly a few chatterlings from each “class” received the Embrace. Of these, \nthey were either particularly suited for life in the Underworld, or they could \nmove among mortals without difficulty or revealing themselves. The former \nprovided Enoch with its yesmen, administrators and other servants. The \nlatter became the window to humanity during the cult’s planning and \nobserved the results of those plans on the mortals at large. \nR I S E O E T H E  \nSABBAT \nMortal tools hadn’t worked as planned for the Manus Nigrum; \nperhaps Cainite tools would work better. The cult was positive that \nunseen forces were at work in the creation of the Camarilla and sought \nto create a counter-balance to it. It assisted the Anarch Revolt and was \npleased to see several elders (and enemies) destroyed. Then, as before, \nthings went awry. \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe cult got a rude surprise with the destruction of the Lasombra and \nTzimisce Antediluvians. How could such youths mount a devastating \nattack on Antediluvians? Most of the cult was comprised of elders, and the \nnotion disturbed them greatly. Finally, they rationalized that the youths \nhadn’t actually done such a thing - \nit had been the Antediluvians who \nhad faked their destructions for reasons that made sense only to them. The \ncult decided to monitor the new anarch organization and try to direct its \nenergies more appropriately. Let them slaughter all the elders they \nwanted, so long as they thought it was preparation for Gehenna and the \ncult could do its work. \nThe cult also attempted to infiltrate the Camarilla, seeking to topple the \nsect. When the young sect proved too stable for them to knock over easily, the \nmembers concluded that the Inconnu (who, according to Manus Nigrum \ndoctrine, stood in active opposition to the Antediluvians) had blocked their \nefforts. They reconsidered their strategy and decided the Camarilla would \nmake a better tool. \nT H E  C U L T I N T H E  \nEAST \nMeanwhile, the Eastern branch of the cult had other concerns. Though \nit had once billed itself as being closer to the original purpose of the cult, most \nmembers spent their time in individual study or building their own personal- \nity cults. The study of death and the afterlife was gradually shuffled aside, and \nmost Enoch residents had no idea what transpired in wraithly affairs beyond \nthe black marble walls. \nThose Eastern cultists still in the living world engaged in shadow wars \nwith the Assamites and Setites, starting in the Middle Ages and lasting down \nthrough the centuries, or so they claimed. Two dozen vampires that only met \nin secret to study and most times effected independence were hardly consid- \nered an enemy by Kindred society at large, and it is likely that the cult’s “wars” \nwere not taken seriously. \nHowever, they did fight more seriously with the other supernatural \nbeings of India. The Nagaraja were the particular targets of much of the \nworst opposition, primarily for their flesh-eating ways. As such feeding \nis much harder to cover up than typical blood-drinking, vampiric \nhunters tracked the Nagaraja before such activity could stir the mortals \nin the area to take up monster-hunting. In response, the Nagaraja saw \nsuch panic as both a mark of incompetence on the native vampires’ part \nand jealousy of their own superior insights. Some of the Ravnos took \nparticular umbrage at the Nagaraja; they were quite serious about their \nhistory, and part of that included a role as the defenders of their local \nculture and religion. Even if the mortals were unaware, the Ravnos \nwould be there to fulfill their role as keepers of India’s spiritual order, \none which the Nagaraja had no part of. \nTHE \nCULT R E ~ O U ~ S  \nThe Manus Nigrum’s disdain for the wraiths around them would \nlead to disaster. During the early 16th century, an army of wraiths \nattacked Enoch, using a mighty storm sweeping through the Deadlands \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nfor cover. Only a handful survived, and the city’s defenses crumbled. \nIt took over a century for the Eastern cultists to persuade their brethren \nto help them retake Enoch and another three years for the crusade \nitself. The commander of the operation, called the Del’Roh, took over \nas leader of the entire cult. During the mid- 1700s, the cult’s division \ncame to a formal end. Still, groups in the cult would continue to pursue \ndifferent aims and goals. \nT H E  CHALLENC~FSOETHE \nSABBAT \nThe Sabbat, the more visible Black Hand, was never solely a tool \nof the Manus Nigrum. Members joined at their discretion, not the \nwhim of some unseen mover’s. Likewise, the sect would move or not \nas it chose, sometimes in spite of efforts by the Manus Nigrum to steer \nthem in another direction. As tensions elevated in the Sabbat, the \nManus Nigrum saw its pawns as troublesome, things to be dismissed \nrather than people to be understood. Indeed, the cult rarely saw the \nsect’s members as being personalities at all. It continued to be \nsurprised when tensions escalated into violence, and would more \noften than not attribute the chaos to the work of its unseen enemies. \nManipulation caused the problems: Manipulation could solve them. \nThe cult saw the terms that ended the two Sabbat Civil Wars as being \nbut scraps thrown to the hounds so it could continue its own work. \nSuch a disregard for the responses and motives of others would \ncontinue to unbalance the cult’s views and eventually be the first \nstones paving its downfall. \nThe cult claimed it had preserved the Sabbat during the first Sabbat \nCivil War (running from the end of the 1700s to the early 1800s), and \nthere was some truth to this. The Camarilla certainly could have poured \ninto warring domains and decimated the ranks if not destroyed them \noutright. Instead, the Camarilla focused on expanding into new do- \nmains, opening new territories and waiting for the peace of thinned \nranks before attacking any Sabbat domains, usually guided into such by \nthe words of certain elders or Manus Nigrum agents in various courts. \nPart of the war’s terms included the Purchase Pact, forbidding war \nbetween Sabbat members, which allowed the cult’s influence over one \nfaction to influence the Sabbat as a whole. \nThe second Sabbat Civil War changed this drastically. The early \n20th century saw incredible mortal conflict, and the Sabbat followed \nwith factional battles over the opportunities (and threats) arising from \nit. The Camarilla made gains during this time while the Sabbat was \ndistracted, particularly in Canada, although the Camarilla’s victories \nwere made pyrrhic by a few quick strikes. The Code of Milan in 1933, \nwhich ended this conflict, was a masterpiece of doublespeak: It pro- \nclaimed the true ideals of the Sabbat then made them worthless by \nputting the true power in the hands of the sect’s leaders. Manus Nigrum \nagents acted to secure their own positions from challenges below and \nchannel any remaining hostilities into more acceptable expressions; the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n4 \ncult itself had very little to do to ensure its interests. Even more, the \nCode of Milan committed the Sabbat to supporting the Manus Nigrum, \ngranting the cult even greater influence. \nThe third Sabbat Civil War proved equally satisfying in results, \neven though the war lasted a mere 100 nights in 1957, things were \nsettled before the cult had time to make a response to its agents. The \nupshot was the recognition of the Caitiff as a new “clan,” which suited \nthe cult; after all, groups and factions were far easier to manipulate than \nindividuals, and this organized the most troublesome members of the \nSabbat in one easy package. \nThe rise of the Inquisitors among the Sabbat worried the Manus Nigrum, \nwho recalled how unsatisfactory a tool their mortal counterparts had once \nproven. Of course, none ever considered that such disaster had ever been \nremotely their doing. \nI N  T H E  EINAL NIGHTS \nWhether Gehenna is imminent or not, the Manus Nigrum was struck by \na number of disasters over several months - \nthe work of millennia literally \nfell in the blink of an eye. \nENOCH \nEALLS \nEnoch’s end was the first of these catastrophes. Over the centuries, a \nfew wraiths stumbled across the city. Each time, the wraith ended her \nexistence as a prisoner of the cult, met an unpleasant end while trying to \nescape or returned to the cities of the dead with the news and no one \nwilling to believe her tale about vampires living in the Underworld. \nHowever, the Deathlords who governed the Empire of Stygia, the mighty \ndomain of European and North American wraiths, had learned of Enoch \nlong ago and longed to wipe it from the face of the Underworld com- \npletely. Reliable guidance for getting through the storm, though, had been \nanother matter, and their forces could only sit in harbor while the lords \nbrooded. Then, recently, a band of wraiths presented the Imperial forces \nwith precise information about Enoch’s whereabouts in the Tempest. The \nImperial Navy, comprised of ships from across the centuries, set out to \nbombard Enoch. \nEnoch’s defenses included magical wards and 100-foot-high black \nmarble walls that had often stymied and amazed those few travelers who \nhad ever seen the city. Stygia’s navy came prepared, however, bringing the \nvery best firepower available, and was able to hide its approach until it was \ntoo late for Enoch’s residents to flee. The dozens of vampires, ghouls and \nwraithly servants within commanded enough power to sink most of the \nfirst ships approaching. Superior numbers and familiarity with the Tem- \npest prevailed in the end for the wraiths. The blockade held long enough \nfor Stygia to call out its greatest weapon - \nthe ghostly reflection of a \nnuclear warhead. In a blinding flash, the city and any within it vanished \ninto nothingness. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThere was no advance warning to anyone. The mysterious Aralu fell like \nthe rest of the city - \nwhether they did not know, or did know and chose not \nto reveal it, remains a mystery. Early on, three ghouls were caught trying to \nslip through the blockade. When the destruction had spent itself, the Empire \nordered them to carry the news to the Manus Nigrum adherents in the \nSkinlands. Let the vampires know that beyond the Shroud would only be the \njustice they had evaded among mortals. \nFor more on Enoch’s destruction (and the wraith perspective), see Ends \nof Empire for Wraith. \nTH E HAND \nI N  TURMOIL \nThe current Del’Roh and all her senior commanders perished when \nEnoch fell. Further, the liches, three potent blood magicians of the ancient \nMiddle East who advised the Del’Roh, perished as well. Rumor claimed that \nthey had managed to escape the destruction briefly, trying to siphon enough \nenergy from the wraiths around them to maintain themselves, but eventu- \nally vanishing altogether. Any attempts by the cult to track them down \nproved fruitless. \nThe Seraphim, the elite guard of the Black Hand, fell to internal \nsquabbles about choosing the new Del’Roh. Someone must bear the \nblame for Enoch’s fall - \nthe Seraphim could not agree on who this \nshould be, except that whoever it was was in the cult and must be \ndestroyed. Factions not previously represented in the leadership started \ndemanding their voices be heard. Clan fought against bloodline, fanat- \nics against moderates, vampire against humans, those who favored \nmortals against those who managed Kindred society - \nany argument \nthat could escalate into violence did. \nTH E WEEK o E N I ~ H T M A R E S  \nThe Manus Nigrum might have survived the loss of Enoch. After all, the \ncore tenets were still intact - \nthe loss of a single city in the Underworld \nwasn’t part of those. If some Antediluvians were destroyed (there never had \nbeen any definitive confirmation regarding the Aralu beyond cult doc- \ntrine...), then it must be part of a master plan. Gehenna hadn’t begun yet, and \nthe cult could regroup and gather its strength. \nThen the final disaster struck. \nIn July 1999, the Ravnos Antediluvian awoke in a blast of dreams that \nstruck sensitives from Malkavians to mortal psychics and madmen. For a week \nit fought a variety of opponents and continued to send out telepathic messages \nsymbolically describing the battle. Only a combination of supernatural and \ntechnical powers were able to bring the monster down. The reverberations \ncontinue to echo throughout Kindred society, but the Manus Nigrum found \nparticular meaning. \nThe cult always believed that it did the work of the Antediluvians. \nFrom the finding of Enoch to the various movements in Kindred society, \nthe Manus Nigrum did the work of the Antediluvians. The sleeping \ngiants sent dreams and prophecy to their favored ones, confirming those \nbeliefs. The Ravnos Antediluvian, however, had nothing to say to the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncult when it awoke. It never addressed them in its mental ravings. It \nnever chastised them for a failing or praised them for preparing the way. \nIt never called on them during the battle. It did not seem to know they \nwere there at all. Worst of all. it did not seem to care. For the cult, the \nrevelation brought despair. \nRationalization soon followed, though. After all, the Antedilu- \nvian had been insane. It had been busy. Surely the next Antediluvian \nwould awake with more composure. But every new explanation fell as \nevents unfolded. None of the Antediluvians spoke to anyone anymore, \nnot in dreams or directly. Perhaps they never had. Perhaps the cult had \nonce understood the pure truth, but had lost its way while dealing with \nbaser vampires (or other creatures). Prophecy had not spoken of the \nWeek of Nightmares. Could it be the prophets had misled the cult, or \ndeluded themselves? \nIn the wake of disillusionment, the cult shattered irretrievably. Some \nawait what must be inevitable ends at the hands of the Antediluvians, while \nothers cast about frantically for new hope. The Manus Nigrum as a unified \nentity, however, no longer exists. \nT H E  HAND \nSEVERED \nThe events of the Year of Reckoning left remaining members of the \nManus Nigrum disbelieving both their own infallibility and the cult’s teach- \nings. There is a lot of frustration to be felt when one believes one’s been \nwasting hundreds of years on a path that leads nowhere. \nThe world still knows nothing of the Manus Nigrum. Only a handful of \nobservers have noticed the increased turmoil as the cult continues to \nfragment (thus removing previous guiding hands), and of these a few have put \ntogether the clues to deduce the cult’s existence. Those who have seen only \npieces but no coherent whole build conspiracy theories that would make the \ncult proud. \nSEVERED \nE I N C ~ E R S  \nTHE \nCLANS \nMost cult members who belong to major clans resume normal \nunlives after the Week of Nightmares. Most believe that vampiric \nsociety in general will not survive, but perhaps smaller groups can save \na few. Smaller Gehenna cults begin springing up among Assamites, \nGangrel, Malkavians, Nosferatu, Toreador and Ventrue, where a single \nelder (or two or three) speaks of the approaching end times and of \nsubmitting to the Antediluvians. \nSuch a message would not have brought a positive response in any \nother age. After all, these apocalyptic preachers suggest submitting to \nunknowable beings with incomprehensible wills that just might eat them \nall. Still, as the skies darken and stranger things prowl the nights, the \nKindred do accept that they don’t know as much as they thought they did, \nalthough no clan’s majority has accepted the Gehenna cult message. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nElders reevaluate their places on the ladders of the Jyhad, while the \nneonates and ancillae find their lots look even bleaker than before. Is \nsubmission a message of hope or despair? \nT R U E  \nBRUJAH \nGiven ideal circumstances, the True Brujah would respond with cool \nreason and analytical appraisal. They began their plotting before the \nManus Nigrum, and the cult’s end does not change things a whit. They \ntake the Gehenna message quite seriously, but their rationalistic natures \nmake them less likely to succumb to raving prophecies. They see their \ndesire to serve the Antediluvians as being the product of carefully \nappraised historical precedent and current reality. Too bad the approach- \ning end times aren’t ideal circumstances. \nThe True Brujah have little idea how to deal with the crises approaching. \nUnused to high emotion, they have been forced to enter the End Times with \nlittle information and act quickly, a situation not to their liking. They knew \nthey must abandon the Manus Nigrum, but what comes next continues cause \nbitter argument. \nMost True Brujah agree that all wicked vampires (read: nearly every \nother vampire) must be punished. If there are fewer sinners needing punish- \nment when the Antediluvians wake, perhaps the carnage will be more \nrestrained. To this end, the bloodline’s members have insinuated themselves \ninto coteries, posing as members of other clans. As the bloodline is unknown \nto Kindred at large, its members operate knowing they are unlikely to be \nconnected to each other from city to city. They often assist in the hunting of \nthe Thin-Blooded or other forms of Kindred slaughter, though their efforts are \nminor in the grand scheme. \nA few True Brujah and Setites have formed a loose confederation. \nThe Setites are well-aware of the secrets of the past with their confed- \nerates, and their histories recount the fateful old times. True Brujah \npass along information and tactical intelligences for the Setites to \napply (as the bloodline has discovered it has some trouble persuading \nanyone outside itself), a combination of ruthless intelligence and \ncunning along with a sense of others’ weaknesses. Some Setites make \na particular effort to undermine prominent main-clan Brujah, while \nothers merely look for opportunity. \nDissension plagues the ranks of the bloodline, particularly among the \ntruly ancient elders and those wanting to move ahead. Efforts to begin \nrecruitment and Embrace fall on deaf ears. The time for extended action \nhas passed, and as the world crumbles, conflict may further thin the ranks \nof the bloodline. \nN A ~ A R A J A  \nNever very large to begin with, nearly all Nagaraja active in the \nmodern nights fell with Enoch. Less than a dozen who had been on the \nother side of the Shroud managed to survive. Knowing they would need \nmore shelter than the cult’s remnants could provide, they sought shelter \nwith the Cathayans. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTheir reputation in India assured that they would find only death \nthere, so the Nagaraja turned to the Green Courts of Korea. The Green \nCourts listened to their suit with fewer preconceptions, and offered \nshelter in exchange for information (whether or not they knew as much \nabout the Nagaraja as the Kuei-jin of India). The price was steep - \nthe \nNagaraja traded nearly everything they knew about Necromancy and \nnecromantic organizations. The Nagaraja are now recognized as honored \nguests of the Green Courts. \nThe Green Courts were most interested in the news of the war against \nEnoch and the origins of the monster storms currently raging in the \ndeadlands. Few Kuei-jin oriented toward the dead can tolerate the \nGiovanni, and the news could bring a united campaign of the courts \nagainst the Necromancers. As for the Nagaraja, they remain on the brink \nof extinction, unable to Embrace (their requests to their hosts for such are \nall put aside politely for “further discussion”) and trying to maintain a \nfooting in their precarious shelter. \nO L D  CLAN TZIMISCE \nThe Old Clan Tzimisce includes both the usual disgruntled elders and a \nhandful of lunatics, as well as their loyal childer. It is the lunatics who have \nchanged the timbre of the clan’s activities. \nThe Old Clan possesses Animalism, Auspex and Dominate for its \nDisciplines, rather than Vicissitude. The clan believes that these \npowers reflect the needs and concerns of ancient rulers in rugged \ndomains. They find Vicissitude to be a perversion, completely un- \nhealthy for a vampire to indulge in. A Tzimisce should be a leader \nsteeped in ancient lore and wisdom, not a freak show. The lunatics \ntook this dislike a bit further, claiming that the Discipline wasn’t a \ntrue Discipline but the manifestation of an evil spirit or even a \nvampiric disease. Those leaders who found such rants to be ridiculous \nwere branded as members of the Vicissitude conspiracy. Rants led to \npurges, and most of the saner members now try to keep the lunatics \nsomewhat contained. \nMost of the Old Clan now spends its days preparing for what it \nknows must be the End Times. Its members know they must prepare \nthemselves to be worthy on their own terms, not trying to shore up other, \nweaker vampires. Many now spend all their rime on their ancestral \nestates (those who didn’t have them previously have been acquiring \nthem by various means), preparing themselves for the Tzimisce Antedi- \nluvian (who may have already risen). \nIn post-Communist Eastern Europe, many Old Clan Tzimisce \nfind their old-style tyranny to be reassuringly stable to the peas- \nantry. They restrain overt displays of vampirism, preferring to walk \namong the people as returned heirs of noble estates or business \nleaders, concealing their vampiric powers. They have withdrawn \nfrom the worthless Kindred society at large to cultivate virtuous \ndomains at home. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n-4 \n9 H O U L S A N D  C H A T T E R L I N ~ S  \nB N R A T H I  \nThe fall of Enoch cut the Enrathi family off from its greatest source of \nincome. As the Manus Nigrum further fragmented following the Week of \nNightmares, the Enrathi’s ties to the cult disintegrated. The family never \ncommitted its entire resources to the cult, in the event of just such an \nemergency, and concentrated on building up its slave trade, despite the short- \nterm hardships. \nThe Enrathi are skilled survivors in the World of Darkness and know how \nto make themselves unseen to the world at large. They don’t advertise that \ntheir vastly extended family is all related; their outward guise is of ghouled and \nunghouled mortals of varying ethnicities who all happen to traffick in the \nflesh trade. Their gifts as mediums can be found in any ethnic group, so that \ndoesn’t cause suspicion. In short, only the most dedicated observers might \ntrace down connections. \nPrinces of major port cities and airport hubs are aware of the slave trade, \nbut so long as the law isn’t aroused and “gifts” keep showing up in their coffers, \nmost princes are willing to let it slide. There are a few more experienced \nghouls looking for domitors in these nights, but hardly enough to rouse \nsuspicion except in the most paranoid of princes. Enrathi ghouls bring with \nthem the family’s accumulated wisdom regarding the dead and the Masquer- \nade, always welcome resources. \nThe drawback to all this has been the storms in the Underworld. Enrathi \nmedium gifts have become a curse and burden as wraiths plead and demand \ntheir attention. Some Enrathi fall to psychosomatic illnesses or try to lose \ntheir gifts through lobotomy; some even commit suicide. The unintentional \npurge results in individuals who are savvy enough to understand the dead, but \ncallous enough to resist their calls. \nMARIJAVA \nMarijava committed themselves to service with the Manus Nigrum. \nWhen the cult splinters, the ghouls panic. Some attempt to bind themselves \nto the isolated survivors, but the need for servants is little, and more than a \nthird are dying simply for lack of vitae to prolong their lives. Those who \nhaven’t died yet have become vampire-hunters, taking the blood they need \nas rogue ghouls. \nSome Marijava search for their long-lost family, without success. Half \nthe searchers disappear altogether due to threats from Lupines and other \nmonsters outside the cities. There is confusion over the fates of the old \nMarijava family that refused service with the Manus Nigrum - \ndid they \nall simply die out,or are they unfindable to those ghouls whose auras bear \nthe stamp of cult service? \nA number of Marijava simply continue their existence and service to new \nmasters, trading information about vampiric rivals for blood, cash and other \nresources. Those private or government agencies seeking to hunt vampires \nmay find the Marijava willing to work for them. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRAEASTIO \nThe Rafastio perhaps suffer the greatest in the wake of the Manus \nNigrum’s disintegration. Without their masters standing over them as they \nhave for millennia, what can give determination to their sense of self? Most \nvampires are unlikely to trust mortal magicians who talk of serving some \ncult of Kindred overlords, and those few who attempted to defect to other \nmagical communities found they had no friends among other mortal \nmagicians. In short, they find themselves truly isolated with few resources. \nDozens of Rafastio die in the months after the Week of Nightmares. Some \ncross the path of a vampire on the verge of frenzy, some attempt a ritual \nwithout adequate preparation, some meet gruesome (unprintable) fates, \nand many commit suicide, bereft of hope and purpose without the cult. The \nremaining family members regroup to plan and redirect their clan’s activi- \nties in the name of survival. \nSub-families within the clan bind themselves to individual cult \nmembers or offshoot groups. Old Clan Tzimisce take many of these \n“orphans” in, the two traditionalist groups being comfortable with the \narrangement. Others gather in spots around the world in groups of varying \nsizes, such as six serving a very old Malkavian or two living with a mixed \ncoterie. Most select such new masters with an eye toward the future, \nhoping that their masters’ purity might deflect whatever carnage follows \nwhen the Antediluvians awaken. \nAbout 50 to 100 of the Rafastio hunt for the remaining Ravnos. After all, \nif these vampires came so close to contact with their Antediluvian and \nsurvived, they must bear a special holiness which could protect those around \nthem. Finding a Ravnos is a task in and of itself, and once found, few Ravnos \nunderstand what the Rafastio want, and even fewer accept the offer. A \nRavnos who allows the Rafastio to remain soon finds herself with a following \nof devoted disciples very interested in her continued existence. \nThe rest of the family go into business for themselves in various enter- \nprises. Some turn to the vampire-hunting organizations of the Inquisition; \nafter all, if the Manus Nigrum could not survive, then no other vampire is \nworthy. Others offer their particular magical influence and assistance to \nvampires outside the cult or even to mortal clients. As mortals seek whatever \nanchor they can find in such dark times, the Rafastio cater to many requests \nwith both genuine magic and superstitious pandering. \nC H A T T E R L I  ~\nc\nj\n~\n \nNearly all chatterlings serving the Manus Nigrum died when Enoch \nfell. Unusual numbers of chatterlings happened to be in the city at the \ntime due to a variety of reasons. Any survivors were in the physical lands. \nMost of these are exceptionally gifted at moving among mortals, and most \noperated under deep cover, going for years without contacting their \nmasters. These deep-cover agents have no idea that the cult’s remnants \ndon’t care about them. A few more informed chatterlings are aware of \nevents transpired, but they continue with their mission, waiting for new \nleaders to give them their next orders. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHE \nH A N D A N D  \nEATE \nTo conspirators, everything else looks like part of a plot or an \naccident. When conspirators continually work in disciplined secrecy \nand use even minor events to advance the grand agenda, they forget that \nmost people are not part of any great scheme. They look for rival plots, \nsearch for non-existent evidence and see such as confirmation of cagey \nenemies. Everyone is either raw material or in on the conspiracy. \nMotivations that have nothing whatsoever to do with the conspiracy \nmean nothing to those who can’t understand why events don’t follow \nthe grand scheme. The Manus Nigrum failed in part because of its \nmembers forgot that history happens because of many personal drives \ncoming together in unpredictable ways, and individuals ultimately act \nfor their own reasons, for better or worse. O n  several occasions, the cult \neven dismissed the idea that those outside the cult had personalities, \ngoals and motives - \nin short, that they were people. Those who were \nnot of the cult were merely tools, servants or just part of a mass that was \nbeing used as a tool. Such beliefs rarely take independent thought into \naccount, and by this the cult collapsed. \nThe Manus Nigrum was certain that the chaos that affected both the \nCamarilla and Sabbat was its own doing. Debacles like the Anarch Revolt \nor the Inquisition weren’t their fault, and any successes were entirely their \ndoing. They didn’t believe that any non-cult vampires could create long- \nterm plans or that neonates and ancillae might actually work together out \nof shared concerns rather than under the coordination of some great \nscheme. In the end, such unrealistic appraisal of themselves and their \n“enemies” brought them down. \nSo how much history is the Manus Nigrum responsible for? That \ndepends on your perspective. As Storyteller, you can make the cult as \nirrelevant or as critical as you see fit. The cult’s insight into its own doings \nmakes it unlikely to be completely true, but likewise, the cult’s critics may \nhave made their own mistakes in assizing the cult. Loyal members examin- \ning the cult’s claims may either find their beliefs confirmed or core-shaking \ndisappointments. If you choose to use Manus Nigrum material in your \nchronicle, remember that the cult overestimated its impact on the Kindred \nworld. It attempted to play at Illuminati with only minimal success due to \nthe continual maintenance of secrecy. \nT H E  SECTSAND \nLIBERTY \nThe Manus Nigrum boasted members from both sects, and the cult’s \nfracture resounds on both sides of Kindred society in different ways. \nFor the Camarilla, the Manus Nigrum’s claims of influence and \ncontrol were frankly overinflated. Some prominently placed individuals \ntook orders from the cult or responded to prompting through various \nchannels, but on the whole, the sect owed nothing to the cult and the cult \ncouldn’t extend its reach without the risk of exposing its agents (who \nwould have been promptly ashed for serving outside influences). The \ngreatest evidence of the cult’s passing is that those who were receiving \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\norders are now without leaders. Some former pawns lose their direction \ncompletely, so used to taking orders after several centuries that they have \nlost much of their innovation. Others become more aggressive, trying to \nshow themselves that they haven’t lost their individuality after years of \nservice. Those who genuinely followed the cult’s doctrine simply carry on \nas best they can, wondering what happened to their old masters and \nhoping that things will soon return to normalcy (when they’re not \nproselytizing). \nThe Black Hand, however, is in far more dire straits in some cases. \nTwo Seraphim battle for control of both the cult and the Sabbat - \nDjuhah, who sought to speed the pace of the cult’s recruiting and now \nfinds himself suspected of plotting against the Sabbat leadership, and \nIzhim ur-Baal, who believes himself the new Del’Roh and presides over \nthe cult’s remnants from the crater that was Enoch. The other Sera- \nphim of the Sabbat had no connection to the cult; the cult’s own \nSeraphim perished along with the Del’Roh and liches at Enoch, and \nIzhim and Djuhah survived only because their duties took them away \nat a crucial time. Some have debated bringing Seraph Elimelech \naboard, but most believe him to be too insane. Others would prefer to \nsee the cult die a dignified death rather than totter along as a shadow \nof its former glory. Those packs that took orders from the cult know \nsome of the fallout from the Week of Nightmares. Now the packs seek \nto prove themselves ready for the great battle, working without secret \ninstructions, which results in reckless acts of bravery that get more \nkilled than anything else. The other factions in the Sabbat at large \ndon’t understand the fury of these packs and seek to rein it in or at least \nchannel it. Some Sabbat leaders, only now aware of the subversion of \nthe Manus Nigrurn, seek to weed out the cult’s influence where they \ncan, finding the cult’s doctrines completely against their greater \nmission and the degree of its influence disturbing. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCome on in and sit for a while.

If you want to galvanize the players into action, let \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthem see what Gehenna might be like. Show them their dreams, or let \nthem compose the threads of their nightly lives in detail. Your chronicle \nis not limited to a few brief hours a week and neither is your role as \nStoryteller. If you feel the need to change the pace and direction of your \ngame, you may want to use some of the following techniques to throw a \ncurve in the road. \nSTOP READ IN^ Now If... \nThese techniques require a lot from you and your players before you \nuse them. Here are some of the demands that these tools will place on you. \nIf you don’t feel up to these needs, come back to this section later. You \naren’t a “bad” Storyteller if you don’t use these techniques; it may be that \nyour game simply doesn’t need these systems to make it work. Each game \nhas its own demands. \nAll of these techniques are tools to building a better game. They’re \ntools; they aren’t full-blown chronicles in and of themselves. Each of \nthem can add excitement to a story, but they need to be used sparingly \nor they’ll get too familiar (and thus lose that excitement, which was why \nyou brought them in). If you have a flashback scene every session, \neventually players will get bored with them. Roll these techniques out \nwhen you want to add an exclamation point to an event in your game or \nwhen you want to explore a character’s emotions in depth. Never use \nthem simply because you’re bored. If you honestly can’t get any excite- \nment out of your current game, you need to do more work than just \nthrowing a couple of these ideas at the screen. \nAll of these techniques are meant to encourage roleplaying. If your \nplayers are more interested in blowing away Sabbat members with their \nsubmachine guns than exploring the emotional depths of their characters, \nthen they aren’t ready for these scenes. Don’t give up hope though; \neventually they’ll be ready for this kind of stuff. Until then, don’t spoil \ntheir fun by forcing this down their throats. You can’t force a person to \nroleplay well; you can just give them the opportunity. Until they take that \nopportunity, wait and be patient. \nThese techniques often focus heavily on a single character. They will \ndemand a lot of one-on one work between yourself and a player. If you \nhave players who get jealous of that sort of attention, be ready to deal with \nthe consequences and the politics before you dive in. If you spend a lot of \ntime with one character in particular, other people will likely start \ndemanding the same sort of attention. Be prepared to provide it or skip \nthese techniques entirely. \nLast, be prepared to go above and beyond your usual game time to \nmake these techniques work. Most of these ideas require that you \nspend some time away from your regular game session moderating a \nscene. It really helps if you have some assistance in this work. These \nscenes are meant to be a break from the ordinary, so a few changes to \nyour regular routine can make a big difference. In particular, a few \nhelpful assistants to play Narrator characters, a few props or a few \ncostumes can have a big impact. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nStill ready to give a whirl? Great. Let’s see what these tricks will do for \nyour chronicle. \nE LAS H B A C  KS \nA vampire story is as much about the past as it is the present. \nVampires are creatures that have had centuries to grow, learn, and \nchange. The person a Kindred was years ago makes him who he is today. \nMost vampire fiction spends a great deal of time on those past experi- \nences. Often the audience watches the past and the present side by side, \nso that they can see just why the vampire acts the way he does. Your \nchronicle might have just as much history as any vampire novel, but that \nhistory rarely gets much examination in play. Players will generate \ncharacters that were born centuries ago, but somehow, that history \nrarely has any relevance to what happens tonight. \nFlashbacks are one method of bringing that history to life. In a \nflashback scene, you take a moment from a character’s history and put it on \nits feet. This can really flesh out a character’s roleplaying experience. It’s \none thing to know why a Kindred still seeks vengeance for his lover’s death \ncenturies ago; it’s another to hold her mangled body in your arms and know \nshe’s gone forever. A player’s character can become far deeper for this \nexperience. If you choose the right history, and the right time, this can take \nyour whole chronicle to a new level. \nThe trick is picking the right character and the right time. When you \nselect a player to do a small scene like this, you’re devoting an awful lot \nof time and attention to her. Is that the best thing for your game, or should \nyou spread your time more evenly across your entire player base? Ulti- \nmately, only you can answer that question. As a rule of thumb, you’ll \nprobably want do small scenes like this outside of your main gaming \nsession. Your first instincts will draw you to the characters that gave you \ndetailed backgrounds that catch your attention, or the characters that are \ndriving the plot right now. However, eventually someone is going to \ngrumble “favoritism” if you spend too much time with any one group of \nplayers. While it can be easy to focus continually on the good roleplayers \nwho always give you great backstories, look at those players who perhaps \nneed a small kick in their metaphyical pants to move from merely \nmeandering through the game to being an active part of it. \nA quick dip into a character’ past is a big boost to any player’s \nroleplaying skills. Most Storytellers like to talk new players through the \nevents of their characters’ lives well before the Embrace just to establish \nthe character in the player’s mind before real play begins. With a group of \nwilling volunteers, the Storyteller might be able to take these initial \nroleplay notes into a bona fide scene, providing a miniature “boot camp” \nto get fresh players accustomed to their new characters and to live-action \nroleplaying in general. This sort of technique is only practical for smaller \ngames, however, and it requires a lot of supervision on your part. You may \nwant to talk a trustworthy assistant into making this a full-time project if \npossible. I t  may take time, but eventually, everyone can get a chance to \nsample their character’s pasts as they see fit. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThere’s no hard and fast rule about what bit of history makes a good \nscene. Your own judgment and sense of style as a Storyteller is your best \nguide. Keep an eye out for high stakes moments in a character’s background, \nthose times when everything acharacter had was on the line. The character’s \nEmbrace is a solid choice, but almost anything goes. Also, you want to pick \nsomething that has relevance to your current plot line. If the scene you’re \ncreating never has any impact on your main chronicle, it may as well have \nnever happened at all. If the modern-day lover of a Kindred is threatened, \nit might be worthwhile to detail with a player how his character lost a lover \ncenturies ago. In the end, though, the game that you’re creating will \ndetermine what sort of history you need to show. \nPreviously written history needs to happen in a certain way, not \nnecessarily rigid because that’s no fun to play, but with the understanding \nthat you have a goal to get to. Make sure you know exactly what’s supposed \nto happen in a flashback scene. How does it begin? What actions have to \noccur? When does it end? You will probably what to keep the flashback \nscene a “soft” roleplay event with no challenges. If you let the players play \nrock-paper-scissors to determine your chronicle’s past, you could end up in \nserious trouble. After all, if that tragic death of a lover in the 17th century \nnever happened because your player gets lucky.. . well, it’s back to drawing \nboard for that character history. You can patch over the situation - \nmaybe \nshe just died later - \nbut overall, you just want to prevent those situations \nin the first place. Let the players determine how they react to events, but \nkeep the action under your control. Encourage gut instinct and emotional \nresponse rather than too much decision-making. \nThe resources you throw into a small scene like this can enhance the \nexperience tremendously. A few helpful assistants to play Narrator char- \nacters are always a great benefit. Likewise, a few small costumes or props \ncan give a lot of life to a scene. At a minimum, give yourself enough time \nto play the scene fully and enough space to put the scene on its feet. Avoid \nmerely sitting down and talking things out if you can help it. Mind’s Eye \nTheatre is a game that’s meant to be played on its feet. Show your players \nthe past; don’t just tell them. \nThe most important thing about any flashback is tying it into current \nevents. History without a context is meaningless to the game. A flashback \nis a great way of illustrating how history repeats itself. Do your best to make \nthat history repeat and watch the recognition in your player’s eyes. If you \nwent the extra mile and got an assistant for a Narrator character, make \nsure you use the same assistant when you’re bringing the past into the \nmodern nights. Maybe that lounge singer is a distant ancestor of your \nKindred’s old lover.. . . In the same way, a prop from the past can take on \na lot of value if it shows up unexpectedly in these final nights. A little \ntouch like this is all you need to tie the past and present together at times \nand bring depth to the game as whole. \nELASH- EORWARDS \nJust as modern vampire stories revolve around the past, the World of \nDarkness is obsessed with the future - \nwhat little of it remains, anyway. \nt \ni \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nGehenna is coming with all the speed and fury of a runaway train, and no one \nquite knows what’s going to happen or when or what will result. Sometimes, \nit pays to remind players of this little fact. \nFlash-forwards serve as foreshadowing to events in a chronicle. Just as \na flashback shows players events of what came before, a flash-forward gives \nthem an opportunity learn what the Final Nights are all about. Sometimes \nthey can be signs of smaller events that are coming up, like a Sabbat \ninvasion or the death of a prince. Alternately, you can get really ambitious \nand stage the opening salvos of Gehenna. In either event, your goal is to \nheighten the sense of dread and urgency that should be present in any \nKindred game. The World of Darkness is coming to an end; players \nshouldn’t feel like they can dawdle. \nA flash-forward is a terrific way to start a new chronicle. Imagine what \nhappens when you show your players what will happen to them before the \ngame even begins. If you tell your players, “This is the story of how the \nCamarilla fell in this city. This is how Gehenna came,” then they will pay \nattention. Every action that they take becomes important. Every choice \nbecomes a dangerous one. The stakes are just a little bit higher than if they \nwere playing for their own characters’ amusement - \nand the higher the \nstakes, the more your players will want to play. \nWhen you’re producing a scene that predicts events in the future, you \nneed to be extremely careful. Players can and will do their best to get out of \nawful predicaments, and their methods will surprise you. You want to get \nyour point across while giving away a minimum amount of information. If \nyou don’t, someone will inevitably find a way to make your foreshadowing \ninvalid. Don’t be afraid to include a disclaimer before any flash-forward \nscene: “This scene shows events that may happen.” As a wise sage noted, the \nfuture is always in motion, and what was true when you opened events may \nnot be after three sessions. \nGenerally speaking, you want to show the distant future, not the events \nhappening next week. The further ahead in time your scene is set, the less \nlikely it is that your players can change it. You’ll also want to keep things as \nvague as possible. If too many details are set in stone, you’ll have to scramble \nkeep things happening according to schedule, which may devolve into a run- \non-rails game. \nYou’ll probably want to keep a tight rein on the action a flash-forward \nscene, just like a flashback. In a flash-forward, you’ll probably be using \ncharacters that currently exist in your chronicle. Players get very unhappy \nwhen they feel that they’re powerless to affect events. You want to keep things \nlax enough that the players feel that they have some control over the \nsituation, even if that’s not the case. These scenes are about flavor, not \ncombat. As with any of these techniques, roleplaying is the biggest concern. \nEncourage your players to pay attention to how they react to what happens, \nnot what they do themselves. \nOf course, if you really are serious about throwing Gehenna at your \nplayers, you may just want to hose them with ridiculous odds. A glimpse \nof the end times should be terrifying for characters. It doesn’t hurt to \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nrattle the players a bit as well. In your main story line, it would terrible \nform to give the characters no chance of survival at all, but this isn’t your \nmain story line. You don’t have to worry about whether all your \ncharacters will survive. Feel free to draw up Methusalahs, battalions of \nSabbat or whatever else your fiendish mind can produce. You don’t need \nto be “fair” when the end result isn’t going to have an impact on the \nchronicle. Just remember that you’re not in this for sadism. You’re here \nto make a point for the players. Admittedly, the point might be that \ntheir characters aren’t really as tough as they think they are, but you \nshould be aiming higher than that. \nA little mystery in a flash-forward can create a great deal of suspense \nin your main chronicle. If you keep some of the details obscure in your \nscene, you can keep the players guessing anxiously about the chronicle’s \nplot for some time. Maybe there’s a mysterious hooded figure command- \ning the Sabbat legions in your home city. The conversations in the \nflash-forward make it clear that this figure was once a loyal Camarilla \nmember. So who’s the traitor? Players will become a great deal more \nparanoid after something like this is shown to them. The characters may \nnot have any reason to be more suspicious, but you can bet that the \nplayers will start jumping at shadows. You may very well not know who \nthat hooded figure is yourself at this point - \njust creating that sense of \nurgency and dread is often enough to drive events forward. Eventually, \nthe chronicle will present its own answer, and you can reveal that \nhooded figure in a later scene. In a sense, the actual events in a flash- \nforward aren’t all that important. It’s how the chronicle gets to the \nfuture that matters. The details of the flash-forward can remain obscure, \nas long as the end results are interesting. \nMake absolutely certain that your players understand that the flash- \nforward is not in-game information. Anyone who acts on the information \nyou give in a scene like this is cheating. If a player can’t respect this, he \nshouldn’t be a part of the scene. At the same time, you need to make sure \nyou don’t give players information that they’ll have a hard time sup- \npressing. If you reveal one of the main characters in the game is a traitor, \nplayers will react differently to the character, no matter how hard they \nmight try otherwise. Again, keeping your flash-forward vague and \ndistant in time helps. \nDREAM \nSEQUENCES \nIn a chronicle, a dream sequence is a great way to lend an air of mystery \nand surrealism to a game. You can use dreams to liberally drop hints about a \nplot to a specific character, to make agraphic statement about a theme in your \nchronicle or even to make the loss of Humanity in a character an event \ninstead of a statistic. Dreams are extremely liberating in their freedom as \nStorytelling devices. Dreams and visions are disjoined, illogical scenes where \nemotions are more important that the laws of nature. This sort of fractured \nvision can provide a great mechanism for giving your players clues, or insights \nas to their own inner natures.. . or even just frightening them as you hit the \ncharacters in their sleep. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAs with all these Storytelling techniques, you want to pick and \nchoose whom you’re going to give a dream sequence to. Unless the \nsituation is extremely odd, only one character will have an active role \nin the dream. Perhaps she frequently has nightmares or the dream is one \nthose strange flashes of insight that crop up with Auspex or Dementation. \nThere’s nothing keeping you from hitting any player at any time with an \ninteresting dream, though. After all, everyone dreams. The final deci- \nsion, as always, is up to you. If you feel something interesting will come \nfrom taking a character through the Twilight Zone, don’t hesitate to go \ndown that road. \nIt’s critical to have a complete background for a character before you \ncreate any dream sequence. Dreams tend to pull images from our past \nexperiences and everyday lives. You need to know what the events in a \ncharacter’s past mean before you can truly begin. If you put a father figure into \na dream, you need to make sure that the character in question didn’t kill his \nfather in a rage. Likewise, little details like a favorite toy or an old phobia can \nhelp to give a dream context and texture. Dreams are intensely personal; you \nhave use symbols that mean something for the character in order to make a \ntruly personal experience. \nA dream sequence probably has the most opportunity for Storyteller \ncontrol out of any Storytelling technique. You can turn the dreaming \ncharacter into a little girl, an old woman or anything in between. Strange \nthings happen in dreams, and often, the dreamer can feel powerless in the \ndream’s wake. It’s highly recommended that you avoid using any sort of \nchallenges in a dream sequence outright. Most dreams only give someone \na few options on how to cope with a situation. When you encounter a fork \nin the road in a dream, you rarely have the option of turning around and \ngoing back home. As long as your player is comfortable with the idea of \nlosing this much control of their character, things should go smoothly. As \nalways, the player you choose to work with in a special scene like this \nmakes all the difference. \nBear in mind that when it comes to surrealism and dream imagery, \na little goes a long way. You might want to compose a dream sequence \nwhere the player flies into orbit and takes tea with dragons, but such wild \nthings are generally hard to roleplay. Small, subtle changes are more \nlikely to unnerve your players rather than big special effects. Something \nas small as meeting a familiar friend who treats her like a stranger can \nrattle a character a lot more than meeting a large horned demon in a dark \nalley. The familiar gone very wrong always has more potential for terror \nthan the alien. \nIt’s a good idea if you touch on a several different themes in the course \nof a dream. Use dream imagery to hit upon problems that a character is \nhaving in his modern life; show him a prophetic event; toss in a few \nmeaningless images. To a certain degree, you want to be as obscure as \npossible in a dream sequence. Your own vision as Storyteller should tell \nyou where to go with any dream, but as a rule of thumb, never be \ncompletely straightforward. If you follow the psychology that says humans \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ndream in an effort to deal with issues that their waking minds can’t or \nwon’t tackle, then the subconscious probably will find a back-door route \nto accomplishing what it needs. \nAlso keep in mind that most dreams are very disjointed in structure. \nFeel free to jump around in time and place as your plans dictate, ending \nscenes and starting new ones whenever the mood strikes you. Rapid jumps \nin time and space can help to give players the surreal experience you’re \nlooking for. Your only goal in a dream sequence is to give a player \ninformation or to set a mood; stop the session once those goals are \nachieved, even if it cuts a scene in half. Dreams are all about images, not \nconclusions, and a good dream sequence should always leave a player with \nunanswered questions. \nAfter a dream sequence, your player may well approach you looking for \nsome insight as to what they went through. While the use of some Abilities \nlike Enigmas or Occult might help out, there is no hard and fast rule as to how \nto use game mechanics to interpret a dream. You definitely want to avoid \nsimply handing the players a dream’s meaning. As a rule of thumb, limit \nquestions to specific objects in the dream and avoid answering questions \nabout the dream as a whole. Enigmas might tell you what the one-armed man \nrepresented in a dream, but it won’t tell you the dream’s story from beginning \nto end. Make the players work to reason things out; don’t hand them the \nanswers on a platter. \nB L U E  B O O K S  A N D  DOWNTIMES \nOften there just isn’t enough time to get everything done in a game. \nPlayers may want to conduct detailed investigations, pursue a stakeout or \neven just socialize over a long period of time. Events like this can’t be \ncovered in just one evening, no matter how much work you do. As a \nStoryteller, it’s sometimes in your benefit to gloss over these things and \ncompress time so that the players can get back to the central plot of the \nevening. However, you can take another approach. If all the players \ninvolved are mature enough to roleplay on their own, you may want to \nallow them to create the details on their own time and let you become \naware of the results. A process like this is called blue booking, and in the \nhands of strong roleplayers, it can help you flesh out the daily life of your \ngame considerably. \nA bluebook is not the same thing as a downtime. Downtimes are \nanother common tool used by Storytellers, usually when several weeks \npass between game sessions. Generally, Storytellers will ask that \nplayers let them know how their characters spend those intervening \nweeks. A good downtime report can provide a lot of detail on a \ncharacter’s actions and may provide a wealth on a character’s motives. \nHowever, most downtimes are a solo effort, and as such don’t quite \nqualify as roleplaying. A character’s downtime doesn’t involve any- \nthing but the player’s own imagination; other players rarely have any \ninput into events, nor can the Storyteller change things as they occur. \nWithout reactions from other people, there’s very little roleplaying \nthat can go on. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nA bluebook, on the other hand, involves both Storyteller and player \ninteraction. In a sense, it’s more like agroup writing effort than a true Mind’s \nEye Theatre session. If two or more players let you know that they’d like to \nbuild a scene together, you may want to have them write down the details \nof what happened and convey the events to you. The exact process is up to \nyou and your players, but generally, it’s best to work in a round-robin format. \nYou build the initial setting for the players; then one player puts down his \nactions and reactions. The next player edits events as he sees fit, adds some \nmore details and returns them to the original player. When all parties are \nsatisfied, they can return the project to you, and you can then incorporate \nevents into the game. \nThere are certain criteria for a bluebook scene that have to be met \nbefore you can use this method. Obviously, a bluebook has to be a no- \nchallenge event; if things come to blows, it’s time to move things off of the \npaper on onto their feet, with you present in the flesh. Generally, a \nbluebook is useful for filling in the quiet times between games. It’s far more \nuseful to describe coffee between friends than a showdown between \nenemies. If there’s ever a doubt as to whether a set of roleplayers can build \na bluebook together effectively, get things back onto their feet and \nsupervise things in person. \nE-mail is a fantastic way of building a good bluebook with your players. \nIdeas can flow back and forth very quickly. A scene can take shape \npractically in real time if you let it. However, it’s better to resist this \ntemptation and put detail into your blue book techniques whenever pos- \nsible. Bear in mind that you’re using a bluebook because your players wanted \nto take the time to do a scene right. Just because you can compose something \nin a matter of moments doesn’t mean that you should. While it’s very useful \nfor you as a Storyteller to monitor the crafting of a bluebook as it happens, \nyou’ll want to remind the players that it’s the final draft that matters most, \nnot the e-mails that fly in between players as they go. \nHow you use a finished bluebook is up to you. Often, players create \nbluebook scenes simply to fulfill the personal needs of their characters. \nIn a case like this, you may need to do nothing more than moderate the \nscene to make sure that nothing happens that might disrupt the game as \na whole. Hold on to that finished work, however. Generally, players will \ngive you a lot of information on how their characters think through \nbluebooks scenes such as this. That information can only benefit you \nlater in the chronicle. \nA bluebook scene will generally require almost no moderation on your \npart. There’s no reason for you to step in when a scene changes direction; if \nthe players find themselves leaving the coffee house to go hunting in a back \nalley, let them. A bluebook is as much for the players’ benefit as yours; as long \nas none of their actions harm the chronicle, you might as well let them roam \nas freely as possible. \nMost importantly, bear in mind that Mind’s Eye Theatre is a game that’s \nmeant to played on its feet. Bluebooks in particular, and e-mail in general, can \ntake up a lot of the slack in between game sessions. But they’re no substitute \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nfor interacting with another player in the flesh and on the scene. As soon as \nis convenient, encourage your players to break away from the bluebooks and \ninto real time again. While a bluebook can be a solid tool for creating a \ncharacter, it is a tool, and not an end in and of itself. \nIn the end, there are many more techniques than this available to you. \nPeople have been telling stories for as long as they have been able to speak, \nand the styles they’ve used to do so are varied in the extreme. Any of those \ntechniques can be applied to your chronicle, as long as you’re willing to \napply time and effort to the problem. The tools given here may help when \ntrying something new; if they don’t, feel free to make up your own. In the \nend, any new style of Storytelling is going to be daring and experimental. \nIf that worries you, than don’t risk it. If it excites you, try it and see what \nhappens. In the end, that process of discovery may prove as exciting as the \ngame itself. \nHISTORICAL \nSETTINC~S \nSo you want to run anew chronicle, but the idea of dragging out the same \nold sort of setting (Yourcity, USA, current year) makes you gag. Sounds like \nit’s time to go traveling. Vampires have been stalking the shadows since \nBiblical times and have always been active in human history. What better way \nto explore history than through the eyes of the Kindred? \nR U N N I N C ~  \nWITH HISTORY \nHistorical chronicles have particular needs that are often vastly different \nfrom modern chronicles. They require attention to detail, intensive research \nand considerations of what you want to accomplish with your chronicle. \nHistorical chronicles can easily fall down when slapdash research \ncatches up with you. If you’re going to run a chronicle set in Victorian \nEngland, then you’d best know something about Victorian England. \nWhat’s given here should help you choose what time period you’d like to \nplay with and some ideas for Kindred involvement, but to make the setting \ncome more fully alive, you’ll need more background. Historical resources \ncan be found in a number of easily digestible formats, from movies to \ndocumentaries to references for writers (found in the reference section of \nthe bookstore) or even other games (such as Call ofcthulhu). Don’t focus \non solely on an endless series of political events - \nlook at what literature \nwas being read, what was causing scandal, what unexplainable events were \nstirring up people, what exciting new inventions were improving life. No \nmatter how small a Kindred’s world, things like the banning of Lady \nChatterley ’s Lover or the invention of the cotton gin can create ripples that \neventually run up against him. \nIt’s been said the devil’s in the details, and in a historical game, details \ncan mean the difference between an adequate chronicle and something \nspectacular. Anything from the hat a character wears to how she addresses \nsomeone can help it come to life. Details are also frequently what can trip \nyou, especially if you have a history buff whose pet project just happens to \nbe the era your chronicle is set in. If you can work with the player to share \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nhis vast store of knowledge, you may find yourself with a fine Assistant \nStoryteller who can catch those little details you missed the first time \naround (how to address a duke, how many calling cards to leave) and infuse \nthe game with a sense of the times. If your history buff proves to be more of \na nut and nitpick, you can always point out that it’s the World of Darkness \nand your chronicle, and this is the setting you’re working with. \nWhile we’ve given you a lot of broad swathes in mortal and Cainite \nhistory to work with, this is by no means all that is going on. A single book \ncould be written on running a chronicle in Victorian England or Renais- \nsance Italy alone. Don’t get bogged down by everything that’s happening \nin a single time period - \nchances are, you don’t need to be; you only need \nto know how the era’s events will affect your own chronicle’s setting. In \nsome periods (especially the pre-industrial world), a vampire’s world is \nlikely to be the city he lives in or around, and maybe the city he fled from, \nwhich makes your setting conveniently smaller. How easily a vampire can \ncommunicate with a neighboring city or even another country is up to you \n- \nthere’s a great deal of difference between trying to send a messenger \nthrough the Lupine-haunted Schwarzwald and sending a telegram. As \ncommunication becomes easier and the news becomes more accessible \n(through the telegraph, telephone, radio, television), the world grows \ncorrespondingly, at which time you’ll need to decide how much of that \ngreat big world to include. Travel does not become feasibly safe for many \nCainites until the advent of the steam train, which means most folks will \nstick close to their home cities. The wild places in between mean Lupines \nand other terrors, another good reason to stay home. Close to home does \nnot always mean safer, though: Which is worse, a city that hosts a center \nof the Inquisition, or a city where a vampire story has swept up dozens of \nexcited youth (both living and dead)? \nLastly, what do you want to accomplish with your chronicle? Fore- \nmost, of course, is telling a good story and having fun at it, but sometimes \na different setting can bring out aspects of the story in new ways. For \nexample, you decide you’d like one of the major themes to be paranoia - \nwho can be trusted, who is an enemy, who has fallen? While a contempo- \nrary chronicle can certainly fill the bill, consider times when paranoia was \neven more poisonous - the Anarch Revolt, the Reformation, the \nMcCarthy hearings. What do you see now? What about a chronicle that \nemphasizes humanity? The era of Carthage and the formation of the \nCamarilla both find vampires with great Humanitas either struggling to \nmaintain what they have or using it as a means of survival. In other time \nperiods, rehashed themes can take on new meaning, and have far more \nserious consequences to really shake up players. \nTHE \nSECOND \nCITY \nThe Second City arises after the Great Flood recedes. The Flood has \nwiped out Enoch, destroyed most of humanity and left only some of the \nThird Generation to start again after the world’s near-destruction. No \nCainites weaker than the Third Generation survive the Deluge, and they \nseek to rebuild what was lost. The mortals build another city on or near the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsite of Enoch, and the Antediluvians (those Cainites who survived the \nFlood) claim the rulership of it. They have, however, not learned the lessons \nof Enoch prior to its loss. \nThe Third Generation sires many childer, seeking servants and pawns, \nagainst the dictates of Caine. The vampire population rises to such a pitch \nthat the mortals can barely support it, and bloody feuds rack the streets as \ncoteries compete for dwindling resources. This is the era that sees the \nbeginnings of the different clans and the end of bloodlines so rare that they \ndo not survive the end of the Second City. \nFinally, Caine becomes so enraged at the hubris of the Antediluvians, for \ntheir rebellion against their sires, for their wasteful fighting, for the destruc- \ntion of the Second Generation, that he curses each one in turn according to \nhis or her crimes. It is believed that from these curses spring what will become \nthe weaknesses of the new clans. Here will come Nosferatu’s hideous appear- \nance, Brujah’s uncontainable rage and Gangrel’s bestial nature, among \nothers. Having cursed his grandchilder for their ways, Caine vanishes soon \nafter. None know where he has departed to, why he has gone or when (if ever) \nhe will return. Confusion reigns: Some celebrate their overbearing grandsire’s \ndeparture while others believe themselves lost. In the confusion, fighting \nagain breaks out as the new clans scramble for his chair. \nSoon, the Third Generation realizes that their childer may well prove as \ngreat a danger to them as they were to the Second Generation. This \nrealization drives them into the shadows where they continue their fighting, \nnow called the Jyhad. The move changes the nature of the war as well - \nJyhad is now conducted in secret, using more visible creatures as pawns to \nprotect themselves from discovery. \nA chronicle of the Second City has remarkable story potential. The \nvampires do not observe the Masquerade - \nindeed, they are often \nworshipped and revered as gods or divine servants of such. The clans are \naltered considerably - the Tremere have not yet appeared, the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n4 \nCappadocians have never heard of the Giovanni, and the Salubri \nflourish as healers and teachers. There is no thought of sects, only \nalliances between coteries and broods, making for strange bedfellows \nindeed. It is during this time that the infernalist Baali arise in the East \nand war with the Second City, destroying many on both sides. There is \nno agreement on what brought the Third Generation to their gestalt \nabout their childer and grandchilder - \ncould it have been a coterie \nattacking an Antediluvian, or the growing rumbles of rebellion across \nthe Fourth Generation? Did the mortals lose patience with their end- \nlessly warring “gods” and aid the Fourth Generation in rebellion? And \nwhat of the Canaille in this time? How did they live and work in the \nshadow of seemingly immortal blood-drinkers who could kill them with \nbut a thought? What happened when one of their own was Embraced? So \nmuch history is shrouded in myth or lost to modern eyes that your \nchronicle could go in many directions. It can be immensely entertaining \nto create history (or myth, in this case). \nChronicles that involve such aged characters like Methuselahs can be a \ntemptation to abuse character power. Even in this age, when the Masquerade \nis observed more in the breach than the practice, Cainites wage their wars \nagainst each other in stealth (with the exception of the brutal Baali war). \nAntediluvians and Methuselahs don’t stalk each other in the streets or have \nshowdowns at midnight. Whether it is to keep the mortals from rising in \nrebellion against their not-so-immortal gods (for if a god dies, surely the rest \nmust be equally breakable), or to make their moves less obvious to their foes, \nthe Cainites practice the early beginnings of what will become the shadow \nwar of the modern nights. \nTHE \nCLASSICAL \nWORLD \nWith the fall of the Second City, the Cainites scatter across the known \nworld (and perhaps a few into the unknown). The Fourth Generation sires the \nFifth Generation to serve them - \ncreating the makings of yet another revolt. \nGatherings are often difficult due to travel, but when they do occur, they can \ncreate true marvels, like Carthage. \nThe Classical World includes the eras of Babylon, Phoenicia, the \nEgyptian dynasties, Hellenic Greece, the Roman Republic and Empire, \nthe kingdom of Israel, Carthage and many other cultures and cities. Many \nCainites use the time to set themselves up as priests to benefit from \nsacrifice (for several gods did demand blood sacrifice), and some go \nfarther, setting themselves up as dark gods who lead from the shadows. \nMany tales tell of the ancient gods having human-seeming flaws and \nmaking titanic struggle over petty matters - \ncould it be that the Cainite \nJyhad made its way into mortal tales? The Masquerade exists as a Tradi- \ntion, but it is honored in passing (more often in the breach than the \nobservance) and in many places (especially where Cainites wish to flaunt \nsupposed divinity) ignored altogether. \nWhile mystery cults are found in nearly every time, they have their \ntrue start in the Classical World. These are where citizens come to worship \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nolder gods supplanted by the new pantheons, the forbidden gods whose \nworship is banned by the government or even some deities created by \n“priests” hungry for offerings of any kind. Some worshippers are wealthy \ncitizens bored with earthly pleasures and seeking decadence (which many \ncults offer in abundance). Others are poor, believing that these cults can \noffer them something that the “accepted” gods and priests do not. As the \ncults and their practices are often banned by the local governments as \ndestructive (with excellent reason - \ntales of sexual orgies, blood-drink- \ning and human sacrifice abound), their activities take place in secret, \nunder cover of darkness and the protection afforded by the social standing \nof the wealthy. In all, the cults prove a windfall for Cainites to feed and \nbuild contacts. Perhaps a Cainite even founds such a cult for himself as a \nplace to feed, or to relive older days of glory in Enoch. \n~ R E E C F  \nGreece is considered the cradle of much of Western civilization’s \nideals, from poetry and drama to statecraft and philososphy. Numerous \nluminaries, such as Plato, Aeschylus, Sappho and Draco, may have \nCainite followers or companions. Nights mean debating in the philoso- \nphers’ schools, listening to the sublime poetry of Homer or training with \nthe Spartans in the arts of war. The historic rivalry between Athens and \nSparta may well have roots in a Cainite quarrel or another move in the \nJyhad. Many Brujah trace their lineages to this golden age, when they were \ndebating philosophy or training warriors. \nThis time gives rise to the idea of Elysium, a safe place where \nCainites might meet and interact without fearing attack from each \nother. Those who violate the sanctity of Elysium are destroyed, estab- \nlishing precedent for millenia to come. There is little describing those \nfirst tense nights when Cainites entered Elysia and wondered who they \ncould trust - \nan invitation to the first Elysium might make a fine start \nto a Classical chronicle. \nPAX \nROMANA \nThe rise of the Eternal City sees Cainites in its midst. At its height, \nthe Roman Empire’s borders span from Great Britain to the Middle East, \nfrom Germany to northern Africa. The Romans borrow much from their \nneighbors and subjects - \nlanguage, religion, customs, adornment - \nand are great patrons of their own enterprises. Cosmopolitan, wealthy, \nmighty, respected, Rome is both prize and opportunity for Cainites. \nMany cluster in Rome, warring with each other and their mortal \nneighbors for the prizes to be won in struggles both open and secret. \nRome is the pride of the Ventrue, and the clan maintains a great \npresence here. Nosferatu find the phrase “All roads lead to Rome” to be \nan apt one, and many settle in to reap the information that flows through \nthe city on its way to other destinations. As a center of religion (of many \nreligions), Rome is also a city of Faith. True Faith is not found merely \nwith Christianity but with any religion, and in an era when gods sit in \nhousehold shrines and the sacred sits publicly beside the secular, Cainites \ntread carefully among the temples. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAcross the Mediterranean in Phoenicia, Carthage is the Brujah’s \nattempt to re-create the glories of Enoch. For over a thousand years, the \nBrujah and other Cainite inhabitants of the city explore new depths of the \nBlood in Disciplines, magic or the power of the Beast. Carthage, however, \nis nothing like the dream that will be spoken of in later centuries - \nCainites openly rule the mortal population and demand blood sacrifice \nfrom the people while darker rumors of infernal ties divide the city’s \ninhabitants. Some Cainites are appalled by what their self-styled “divine” \nbrethren have done, and attempt to turn the city to a more Utopian ideal, \na place where mortals and Cainites live openly and harmoniously to- \ngether. Others drive it even further into iniquity. Cainites outside Carthage \noften see the city for what it truly is - \na nightmare waiting to breed \nfurther nightmares. Such conditions make the place ripe for a revolt by the \nmortals against the vampires, and possibly open the door to similar revolts \neverywhere else. Several vampires work against Carthage, starting ru- \nmors, infiltrating the city and even undermining it from the inside. \nRoman vampires aid this by encouraging the Punic Wars. When Carthage \nfinally falls, gnawed from the inside by Cainite infiltrators and crushed \nfrom the outside by Scipio, it is no wonder that no stone is left standing \nand the earth is salted. Over the years, Carthage fuels many speculations, \nsends out Cainite recruiters and hosts vampires of nearly every clan. Who \nwould listen to such tales? Would characters enjoy the depravity of \nCarthage, seek its profit or work against it? \nNot everyone is so pleased with the “Eternal City” or her grasp. The \nFertile Crescent is a scene of uneasy peace or violent bloodshed as Jews \nstruggle against the Roman occupation of their homeland. Rome ap- \npoints native govenors in an attempt to quell some of the demands, then \nremoves those govenors when the expected tax revenues don’t flow, or \nan Emperor perceives some action as being suggestive of weakness. It is \nentirely possible that Cainites could be on either side of the conflict - \nthose who maintain lands where Enoch once stood (or so they believe), \nand those who serve the Roman eagle (and Ventrue overlords). The \nHoly Lands are also considered the historical lairs of the Baali. Most \nCainites believe them destroyed with the great wars, but Salubri war- \nriors and other demon-hunters still find evidence of their tracks. Across \nthe continent in what will become Germany, Cainites entering with \nRoman forces may likely tangle with angry Lupines, who rage against \nMan’s grasping ways. In Albion, Cainites are likely to find even more \nsurprising challenges - \nnative vampires like the Lhiannan bloodline or \neven the Fair Folk, the Wild Ones that Caine warned his children about, \nmaintain England’s green hills as their own, and they are unlikely to \nwelcome Roman Cainites with open arms. \nThe era of the emperors sends the glory of Rome crashing into \ndecadence and decay. The succeeding horrors of Tiberius, Caligula and \nNero steadily whittle away the Roman Empire into nothingness. Those \noutside the palaces see how their-once proud world is collapsing into \nbread and circuses (but may not care) while those within struggle to \nmaneuver the mazes of intrigue and avoid fatal notice. Even Cainites may \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nbe hard-pressed to keep up with the intrigue and might well wonder who \nis manipulating whom. It is during this time in the Holy Land that Jesus \nteaches and is crucified. Many converts to Christianity are martyred for \ntheir faith by the Roman Empire while others huddle in catacombs, \nunwilling to risk their lives or give up their faith. While perhaps there is \nno blood sacrifice or infernal ties (to most Cainites’ knowledge, at any \nrate), those who despised Carthage’s depravity surely swallow hard at the \nsight of Caligula’s madness or Nero’s circuses. \nTHE \nDARK \nA ~ E S  \nThe Roman Empire collapses under its own weight, inept leaders and \nwave upon wave of barbarian invasions. Many Gangrel claim to have ridden \nwith the hordes that sacked Roman outposts and the Eternal City itself. Here \nfollows an era commonly called the Dark Ages, so called because it was \nbelieved that Europe stagnated in a period completely lacking in art, culture \nor philosophy. In fact, the perceived lack is false - \nthe Catholic Church sets \ndown its roots, patronizing arts that benefit its young power, and legendries \nsuch as King Arthur spring out of this era. \nCainite sects begin to emerge during this confused time. A number \nof Roman Cainites, tired of the nightly games and ceaseless Jyhad, seek \nto remove themselves entirely from their brethren’s blighted sport; \nthey become known as the Inconnu. The Manus Nigrum begins its \nsecret crusade to pave the way for the return of the Antediluvians \n(although its roots are in fact much older). Most vampires during this \ntime are more centered on those around them rather than far-flung \ngroups; after all, the Blood is more important than some half-formed \nideal. This era also sees the institution of a Cainite idea called the Law \nof 1001 Nights (one vampire per 1001 mortals) in an effort to check \noverpopulation, which often leads to bloody clashes. In many places, \nCainites follow the example of mortals in establishing minor fiefs for \nthemselves, barely bothering to conceal their supernatural natures \n(especially where paganism still reigns). It is a choice they will come \nto regret in later centuries. \nThe Catholic Church’s continuing rise of power results in a change to \nRome’s atmosphere. Some Cainites in the Holy City experience strange \nvisions and dreams, others suffer discomfort from the new aura of Faith, \nand a few even meet with mysterious destruction. Not all suffer in the same \nway-not \na few vampires choose to convert to Christianity and others see \nthe nascent Church as a new resource of power. Christianity introduces \nnew concepts to Cainite thinking, such as their place under the hierarchy \nof God and the notion of damnation. Perhaps sires and childer clash over \nconversion, or new converts must struggle with questions of doctrine \nversus their own existence. \nEarly in 1000 and continuing through the Middle Ages, the Church \nseeks to reclaim holy sites in the Middle East from the “heathen” Muslims. \nIt sponsors Crusades, great battles against the Muslim forces led by secular \nkings and calling up armies from across Europe. Christian Cainites may \ntake up the banner of Holy Mother Church and venture into the Holy \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nLands, only to encounter Assamites and Setites, who are not interested in \nentertaining Canaille claims to their lands or the Cainites who back \nthem. Some knights may ride out on Crusade and return as Cainites after \nbeing Embraced in the ranks. A Crusades chronicle can be very exciting \nas Christian vampires encounter brethren inclined to Muslim or Jewish \nfaiths in the Middle East - \nwhich battle is more important: Cainite versus \nCainite, or faith versus faith? What happens when a promising mortal \nreceives a battlefield Embrace? \nThe recent surge of “millennium fever” that heralded the year 2000 \nis not as new a phemonemon as the pundits would make it to be. In fact, \nthe first round of millennia1 fervor struck as 1000 CE approached. Some \nfeared that this was the year that the Biblical Apocalypse would strike, \nand clergy took the opportunity to impress on the pagan populations that \ndisaster was imminent. In many places there were mass conversions to \nChristianity (perhaps from those thinking to stave off whatever punish- \nment was muttered by the priests), followed with millennium cults and \nmass suicides. Accounts of the times speak of prophecies and omens. In \nthe midst of all this, it’s doubtful that the Cainites were able to completely \nignore the mortal panic. Indeed, some were likely swept up by the fear and \nfever, perhaps believing that the Biblical Apocalypse would also herald \nGehenna. An interesting short-term chronicle might deal with how the \nCainites faced the coming millennium and the resulting mortal terror - \ndid they accept a conversion to Christianity (the pain of Faith be \ndamned), did they support cults that promised protection from the coming \nstorm or that vowed to celebrate unto destruction, or did they simply hide \nand hope that there would be a world to return to? \nT H E  MIDDLE \nA ~ E S  \nFrom the Dark Ages rises the medieval period, a complex time of openly \nruling Cainite lords, neonates chafing under the iron rule of their elders, \nmortal faith and fears, and strange things to be found in the untamed woods \nbetween cities. This is a time best described in Vampire: The Dark Ages and \nits MET companion The Long Night. \nIn 1022, a cabal of Hermetic wizards steals the secret of vampirism in \ntheir search for immortality. They pay a heavy price for their knowledge: \nTheir magical powers vanish, and their presence in Cainite society is very \nmuch unwelcome. Seeking to legitimize his line, their leader hunts down \nand diablerizes the Antediluvian of the Salubri clan. Fortified on stolen \nvitae, the new clan begins a systematic purge of the Salubri, to the \nrevilement of many Cainites. Clan Tremere’s temerity in seizing vampiric \npower upsets vampiric society, and many vampires do not know what to \ndo with these “Usurpers.” Clans Nosferatu, Gangrel and Tzimisce, along- \nside several Hermetic cabals, wage shadow wars with the blood magicians \nin retribution for clanmates used in Tremere experiments. A chronicle of \nbloody nights in Eastern Europe as the young Tremere clan struggles \nagainst their many enemies can be laden with conflict, but not always - \nthe Tremere utilize powers never seen before among vampires, the Tzimisce \ncall upon their own blood magic steeped in the crags of the Carpathians, \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nand the Nosferatu put their spying powers to the test to gather information \non their enemies. \nWithin the Church arises a new faction, one dedicated to the \neradication of heretics, witches and monsters. While elements inside and \noutside the Church often use it as a tool to seize money or land, or for one \nenemy to denounce another, too often the Inquisition serves its purpose \nadmirably. For many elders, the Inquisition is a wake-up call that their \nopenly supernatural ways point the Inquisitors to their doors. To buy time \nfor themselves, the elders hurl their childer at the flames; scores of \nvampires of all generations and ages fall in the fires. The Cainite popula- \ntion is left a shadow of its former numbers, but deeper wounds are dealt. \nThe betrayal of the elders enrages many neonates and sows the seeds for \ngreater rage to come. \nIn the mid-14th century, flea-ridden rats arrive in Italy, riding in bales \nof silk from Asia Minor. The fleas bear the bubonic plague, which sweeps \nacross Europe in two years. The resultant pandemic kills over one-quarter \nof Europe’s population, wiping whole villages from the face of the world. \nUncommon numbers of the clergy die as they care for the sick or \nadminister last rites to the dying. The fear of this time is unparalleled - \nwho will sicken next? where is God during this time? is the world ending? \nFeeding becomes difficult for many Cainites, and questions over the \nCainites’ role in the Black Death go unanswered. While it’s well-known \nthat vampires can carry disease from those they feed on, did the Cainites \ncarry the Black Death as much as the rats? How would a blood-borne \ndisease react to Cainite blood? How will Cainites feed as their neighbors \naround them drop from the plague? Could a Cainite be insane enough to \ncarry and spread the disease deliberately? \nThe Black Death has far-reaching consequences. The population loss \nresults in labor shortages, which leads in turn to traditional feudal relation- \nships crashing from lack of support. This leads feudal lords to crack down on \npeasant wages and mobility in an effort to stabilize matters, making them \nworse. The peasants respond with some of the largest revolts ever seen in \nmedieval Europe. The violence stirs many neonates into open warfare against \ntheir murderous sires in what will be known as the Anarch Revolt. \nT H E  \nRENAISSANCE \nThe dark, cold times cannot last forever. Slowly, Europe begins to thaw \nitself out, both physically and spiritually. However, the emerging warmth of \nrebirth becomes the heat of passion and where a new ideas clash with an old \norder reluctant, fires often result. \nIn the warm hills and cities of Italy, this “renaissance,” or rebirth, first \ntakes hold. Ancient Greek and Roman texts (some no doubt sheltered in \nvampire libraries for centuries), with their ideas of a world that is based on \nhumanity’s worth, provide much of the impetus for the changes in thought \nthat subsequently lead to changes in culture and society. The world is no \nlonger centered solely on the attainment of Heaven - \nthis is a world of \nhumans, where things should be created for the benefit of humanity. The \nwellspring of changes and new ideals are almost impossible to catalogue as \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nevery aspect of life is touched by this new notion of human worth. \nImpressive strides are made in art, literature and the sciences - \nfrom da \nVinci to Michelangelo, from Dante to Shakespeare, from Gutenberg’s press \nto Galileo’s astronomy. \nAll is not necessarily well, however. The Renaissance also sees a rise in \nabsolutism, the divine right of kings and totalitarianism. The Church has \nlost some of the power it wielded over secular life, but that increases its grip \nmore strenuously over the sacred. Where the Church and state meet, their \nhands clamp with deadly force. After many prosperous years in Spain, \nMoors and Jews are thrown out during the Reconquista, a joint venture by \nKing Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile. Even as Isabella \nis bankrolling Christopher Columbus’ voyage to seek new routes to India, \nshe is enthusiastically leading the Spanish Inquisition to seek out not only \npotential heretics but also those Jews and Muslims who converted to \nCatholicism to avoid persecution and who practice their religions in \nprivate. Some escape early on; others are not so fortunate. Across Europe, \nMuslims, Jews and pagans become scapegoats for Holy Mother Church, and \npublicly professing one’s faith can be tantamount to a death sentence in \nsome places. Obviously, few Kindred with the right inclination will waste \nthe opportunity to put enemies squarely in the sights of Torquemada and his \ncrew. Who will profit when an enemy burns in the public square? The \nLasombra who support Isabella are likely to put Brujah, Assamites and other \n“undesirables” to the torch with enthusiasm. \nThe Anarch Revolt continues to rage in the shadows, and the pursuit \nof the mortal Inquisition doesn’t help matters. Two Antediluvians fall \nagainst the onslaught. The first is Tzimisce himself, when anarchs and \nclanmate Lugoj successfully attack and supposedly diablerize him, which \nfollows close on the heels of Assamites and anarchs claiming to have \ndestroyed Lasombra. Neither Antediluvian seems to be around to deny the \ncharges. Suddenly, the Anarch Revolt is being taken very, very seriously by \nthe elders - \nafter all, if the Antediluvians (who are nigh unto gods) fall \nbefore these mongrels, what hope can there be? Rumors that a group of \nTzimisce youth have discovered a way to break the shackles of the blood \nbond only fuels the terror. Assamites follow the anarchs across Europe, \nsupping on the blood of fallen elders. \nThe scions of a merchant family in Venice become bored with the \nearthly privileges that wealth and power can bring and start casting about \nfor more unearthly delights. Incest and other perversities bring some \ndiversion, but then some of the family discovers nigrimancy. The family finds \nit has a talent for this type of magic, particularly when it allows them to \nindulge their dark tastes. Such talent does not go unnoticed, and when \nCappadocian clan comes to offer patronage, la famiglia Giovanni does not \nsquander the opportunity. Greed, however, is strong, and in 1444, the \nfamily head, Augustus Giovanni, seeks ultimate power by diablerizing the \nclan’s founder, Cappadocius. In a grim replay of the hunt against the \nSalubri, the Cappodocians are put to the sword by the new clan and believed \nhunted to extinction. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nIn October 1493, the Camarilla is officially founded at the Conven- \ntion of Thorns to put an end to the hostilities of the Anarch Revolt. A \nheavy curse is levied to punish the Assamites for their involvement, \nmaking them unable to commit diablerie. Those anarchs who wish to \nreturn to the fold may do so, but many refuse the offer of their treacherous \nelders, turning their backs on the Camarilla; these die-hard rebels will \nform the core of the early Sabbat. The convention also sees a new, \nstringent policy of the Masquerade come into effect: It is not enough to \nhide from humanity; the vampires (or “Kindred”) must make humanity \nforget they ever existed. For some that means avoiding older ways and \npractices, including the old Viae (medieval precursors to Paths of Enlight- \nenment). Those who cannot or will not change are often stamped out as \nthreats by the newly created archons and justicars. \nR E  E O  R MATI o N A N  D RE s TO RAT I o N \nThe Reformation is a dangerous time, whether one is dead or alive: One \ncan easily be killed on a spurious accusation of witchcraft or heresy. The \nMalleus Maleficarum (or, The Hammer of Witches), authored by two \nfanatical clergymen, adds fuel to the hunts by making a case against witches \nand women. The witch-hunts last from the early 1500s until the early 1700s, \nand while the fires burn the fiercest in the German states, the rest of Europe \nis not unfamiliar with the grip of the witch-craze. In some towns, the \nhysteria reaches such a pitch that their populations are devastated. Torture \nis considered perfectly appropriate to elicit confessions from those who are \nreluctant to confess or who recant on the stand. Documents of the time \nreveal that not a few “witches” or “heretics” were also wealthy or prominent \ncitizens or that interrogators would force confessions regarding particular \nnames. Were the witch-hunters making examples of their high-born prison- \ners, or was someone cashing in on the wealth that often reverted to town \ntreasuries? Only the wiliest of vampires could remain unscathed in this time, \nperhaps guiding the hunters to the doorstep of his rivals and enemies, but \nthere is always the chance that the hunters may suddenly question how their \nsource knows so much. \nMartin Luther’s Reformation brings many changes for German Chris- \ntians: In their split with the Catholic Church, they were no longer subject to \nits laws. Many read the Bible for the first time after it is published in German. \nThe split does not bode well for everyone, though; many Protestants are as \nintolerant or more so than the Catholics. Luther supports pogroms against the \nJews while Calvinist tolerance is equally lacking. Those Kindred living in \nCalvinist communities find they must be extremely careful as their neighbors \nare ever watchful for “sinful” activity, which is quite broadly defined. Worse, \nmany Calvinists are witch-hunters even more fanatical than the Romans. \nThe Restoration of the English monarchy marks the time of the cavaliers \nas the English king Charles I1 restores English society to a more relaxed state \nafter Oliver Cromwell’s bloody reign. Across the channel, the French king’s \nprivate bodyguard, the Musketeers, fuel stories for years. In response to years \nof tight restrictions, closed theatres, guarded words and fiery deaths, Europe \nin many places enjoys many newly loosened strictures, from the arts to bodices \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nto expectations, although the Inquisition continues to remain a shadow in \nmany Catholic countries. The Camarilla’s continued efforts to enforce the \nMasquerade begin to pay off at last: The vampire-hunters, finding few \nmonsters to slay, turn their attention to more human causes. As part of the \nMasquerade, Kindred encourage mortal sciences and explorations grounded \nfirmly in “reality,” encouraging worldviews that do not allow for such \nsupersititons as vampires. \nThe exploration and colonization of the New World sends both Sabbat \nand Camarilla across the sea, seeking new opportunities. The Sabbat seeks a \nworld where they can gain a foothold against the Camarilla while Camarilla \nneonates and ancillae hope to expand beyond the smothering grasp of the \nEuropean elders. Both sects find what they hoped for, and neither is willing \nto share with the other. \nE N L I  cj H T E  N M  E N T  A N D REVO L U T I  o N \nThe 18th century is marked by a time called the Enlightenment, so \ncalled because it introduced many new ways of thinking: Advances in the \nsciences as well as new philosophies and thoughts on religion and spiritu- \nality. Religion is no longer considered a source of explanations, but \nscience hasn’t taken its place yet. Philosophy describes the world in terms \nof reason, not faith and superstition (hallmarks of ignorance). Individual \nthought and identity gain ground while monarchies and divine right slip \nfurther from power, but not everywhere. Indeed, neonates who enter into \nKindred society with such views may be quickly disavowed of them after \nseeing princes at work. \nRevolution rocks both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1700s as the \nFrench and American populaces revolt against their monarchies and form \nnew governments. For Kindred, revolution means violence, an overthrowing \nof all things old and a risk of the Final Death (all of which elders are \nnotoriously intolerant of), but it also means opportunities for those who avoid \nthe swing of the axe. Quite often, conflict means new blood (bothofEmbraces \nand in positions of power). \nThe American Revolution sees the Colonies refuse to bow to an \nincreasingly overbearing English monarchy and turn against England to win \ntheir freedom. American Kindred (ancillae who came with the original \ncolonists, neonates born in the Colonies or Sabbat riding the violence) \noccasionally lend aid, seeing this as their chance to separate their fates from \nthe European elders. \nThe French Revolution is far more bloodthirsty than the American. \nDuring the Reign of Terror, mob rule takes over, and the monarchy and \nits supports die in wholesale slaughter. Not a few Kindred (who may well \nbe responsible for the misery that incites the mobs) die at their hands - \nafter all, Madame Guillotine never sleeps. Thousands die before the \nviolence begins to gnaw on itself. Robespierre, architect of the Revolu- \ntion, dies at the hands of a madness he helped to create. While mortals \nsee the French Revolution as a great triumph of reason over superstition \nand privilege, the Kindred often find it a different story. Many Kindred \nflee France entirely or go into hiding to avoid the mobs. Anarchs and \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSabbat find the violence to be excellent cover for their own activities. \nCould neonates make a similar discovery when it comes to dealing with \na hated sire? \nTHE \nROMANTICS \nThis is considered an age of gentility and grace, or at least if one is \nliving the country life. This is the era of Jane Austen and Emily Bronte, \nof the Romantics and the original Gothic period. This is also the begin- \nning of the end of the pastoral life of much of the western world as \nindustrialization begins. \nThe Romantic sensibility so prevalent in this time sees the new changes \nof industrialization and technology to be the road to disaster: Technology will \nseparate man from nature, bringing prosperity to a few but overall misery for \nthe greater population. The writings of this era (reflected in the work of \nColeridge, Blake, Shelley and Burns, among others) speak of both the \nvanishing country world and the growing oppression that progress sows. For \nvampires, such changes are not unwelcome: The industrial revolution means \nmany neonates and ancillae who invested in the new (which elders often \navoid) profit from their risks. \nIndustrialisim rapidly turns into a curse for the lower classes, worked as \nslave-labor in the factories. A select few profit while many suffer. The \nurbanization of the working class, often living in desperation, means new \nprey, minions and allies for Kindred. Some Kindred find it filthy living and \nhunting, while others who are city-born and bred (or who have moved there \nout of circumstances) grow influence and learn secrets that the “high-born” \nrarely encounter. \nThe French Empire (under Sicilian-born Napoleon Bonaparte) and \nthe English Regency periods coincide during the early part of this era. \nThis marks a period of great gentility and grace, the time of the country \ngentlemen with their estates, of “the season” in London, or holidays to \n“take the waters.” The novels of Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell \ndescribe this time of manners and mores. Shortly after follows Gothic \nsensibility, described by the Bronte sisters and Anne Radcliffe - \na time \nof gloomy days and dark nights, of crumbling castles and madwomen left \nin attics. Elysia of this time, therefore, have a much different timbre, one \nthat elders and ancillae might enjoy, and the neonates find at once \nfamiliar and utterly confusing. How do the newly Embraced young \nwomen of the day understand how Cainite women seize power, hold \noffice or otherwise act “unladylike?” What measures would a Cainite sire \ntake to make his sheltered childe understand that Regency manners no \nlonger apply? \nTHE \nCIVIL WAR \nPalatial mansions and textile factories, slavery and suffrage: The United \nStates during the antebellum era is a bundle of contradictions. In the South, \nit is the time of plantations, exquisite Southern gentility and the dark misery \nof slavery. In the North, it is a time ofwild growth, from the factories to groups \nagitating for causes ranging from women’s rights to the abolition of slavery. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nIndustrialism reaches the United States, but the country is sharply divided by \neconomic and ideological differences. \nThe fight is one of the bitterest, often dividing families (and perhaps \ncoteries or bloodlines) along ideological fronts, or between ancestral lands \nand modem circumstances. The physical cost is terrible: thousands dead, the \nSouth reduced to rubble, a country gnawing on itself. But America does \nsurvive in one piece. Sabbat see the time as a chance to attack elders esconced \nin their mansions while neonates in the North get in on the ground floor of \nindustries that most elders have previously dismissed. \nThe antebellum period is considered by many vampires to be some of \ntheir palmiest days. Elders find it reminiscent of the glories of older times \nwhen they had legions of servants to administer their lands and wait upon \ntheir command. Not a few Kindred of the modern nights can trace their \nhistories back to a pedigreed birth and pampered upbringing as the offspring \nof wealthy plantations owners, or perhaps even owners in their own right. \nSome vampires use their plantations as feeding grounds, although at their \nown peri: Such abuse can result in slave uprisings, or a cunning wise-woman \nturning the tables on her family’s oppressor. Not a few Kindred borne of the \nconflict (whether it was the War Against Northern Agression, the War \nBetween the States or some other title) still have strained relations with \nbrethren who were on the opposite side, even in the modern nights. \nTHE \nVICTORIAN \nERA \nThis era finds England at her summit, as a cultural and political capital, \nand as an imperial nation. By the end of the 19th century, London is the \npolitical and economic capital of the world Her holdings spread from \nAustralia, India, China, Canada and nearly every comer of the globe, giving \nrise to the phrase “The sun never sets on the British Empire.” Of course, where \nthe mortals go, the Kindred often follow, attempting to expand their own \nholdings and the Camarilla’s (usually in that order). But where the mortals \nmight plow through the natives with the Bible, the railway and the gun, \nKindred often encountered supernatural creatures the likes of which they had \nnever seen. Many of the first encounters with the Cathayan vampires are \nreported during this time. Not every Kindred departing Europe was heading \nfor the Dark Continent or the mysterious East for reasons of power, though - \nafter all, few elders are likely to pursue troublesome neonates or ancillae into \nsuch dangerous places, which often means coteries involved in quarrels may \nchoose to flee together to avoid powerful enemies. \nWhile it is hardly a time of kings and courts of two centuries past, \nthere is certainly a “proper” way to do things, from dressing to manners \nto conducting business, and from this propriety arises the notorious \nprudishness and strictures that mark the time period. In Kindred society, \nwhich has such ideals already inculcated, courts and Elysiums practically \ncalcify under the press of custom and manners. In some cases, neonates \nmight find it comforting to discover that things are not so different after \ndeath while others nearly go mad to find themselves reduced to lower \nstraits upon their Embraces. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAmong the most shocking developments to the Kindred world is the \nappearance of Bram Stoker’s Dracula, along with stories like “Carmilla” and \nPolidori’s “The Vampyre.” The sudden pictures of vampires moving through \nmodern society as predators stirs up panic as the Camarilla hunts for the \nKindred responsible for the breach of the Masquerade. Is it truly the \nMasquerade faltering, or perhaps a brilliant attempt to further display \nvampires as fancies and fictions rather than true predators? Even the Sabbat \nare in awe of this monumental risk to vampiric existence. Whatever it truly \nis, vampire fiction becomes something of a novelty in the Elysiums and \nspawns dozens of mortal fans enticed by the barely concealed sexual \nmetaphors and elegant predation. \nAmerica during this era busily plows through one turbulent time after \nanother -the westward expansion, the Civil War, the Age of Innocence - \nbut always with an eye on Europe’s fashion and culture. The new millionaires \nhead for Europe to purchase whatever trappings their wealth can bring them, \nfrom mansions to furnishings to pedigrees. Young American women of the \n“right” standing become some of the most expensive bartered brides of the \ncentury as the tottering European nobility infuses its stock with American \nblood and money, perhaps literally in some cases. This time can make for an \nintriguing chronicle of American-born neonates being Embraced by Euro- \npean ancillae - \nand the resulting culture clash. \nTHE \n(+EAT WAR \nThe invention of the automobile brings about a new mobility, and \nKindred find the idea of picking up and moving a little less traumatic than \nbefore. Women agitate for the right to vote on both sides of the ocean - \nthe \nmovement is hardly a new one, but it gains strength during this era, finally \nculminating in America with the passage of the 19th Amendment. Strangely, \nfor Kindred, this is not necessarily anything new-not afew of the most adept \nprinces or archons are women. \nPrior to and after the Great War, empires around Europe totter and \ncrumble. In some places, the monarchy simply and quietly fades from view. \nThe most violent of these quakes occurs in Russia, as the Bolsheviks force Czar \nNicholas I1 to abdicate. The subsequent execution of the Romanov royal \nfamily not only frightens many European monarchs (most of whom were \nrelated to the Romanovs), but also shocks many Kindred elders, who recall \nthe horrors of the Anarch Revolt. The complacency they have slid into over \nthe past centuries regarding the “proper way” to do things is rudely shattered, \nand marks the beginning of the modern era for them. The ensuing years see \nelders keeping an exceptionally close eye on their childer. \nNineteen-year-old Gavrillo Princip assassinates Archduke Ferdinand \nand his wife the Duchess Sophie, and the simmering tensions in Europe \nerupt into full-scale conflict. For the first time, the world is engaged in war \non a global scale. In the past, wars had been between leaders or principali- \nties, but now entire countries under a single dictum engage each other. \nWorse yet is the apparent abandonment of “civilized” forms of war: Poison \ngas, machine guns, primitive tanks and other weapons allow soldiers to cut \nbroad swaths across their enemies, horrifying politicians and civilians \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n4 \nalike. When the war is finally ended, 64 nations band together to sign the \nKellogg-Briand Pact, an attempt to make war illegal. Meanwhile, at \nVersailles, several European nations and the United States put together \na treaty to officially end the Great War; among its statements is a “war- \nguilt clause,” forcing Germany to accept responsibility for the destruction \nthat has just been wrought. It is an act that many will regret, for in that \nare sown the seeds of worse to come. \nThe full horror of the conflict catches some Kindred by surprise. Those \nunprepared are swept away by anarchs and Sabbat seeking to capitalize on the \nchaos or by misguided mortals. In Russia, the Soviet Revolution rips up \nKindred society as Brujah attempt to ride the coattails of the people’s \nrevolution against the Ventrue. Some conspiracy theorists among Kindred \npoint to the fact that Gavrillo Princip was part of a group called the Black \nHand (another name for the Sabbat), and speak of the war being started by \nthe Sabbat to cover for other violence. \nTHE \nR O A R I N C ~  \n‘20s \nA N D  C ~ R E A T  DEPRESSION \nThe 1920s roar for a reason -for \nmany, it means celebrating war’s end \nand new prosperity. This time is popping with all manner of exciting \ndevelopments - \nfrom radio to postsSoviet revolution to the flappers and \nrumrunners. The last of Victorian strictures collapse by the wayside, reduced \nto ridiculousness or left outdated by the past decades’ changes. While \nAmerican Kindred enjoy new prosperity, the European Kindred often struggle \nto rebuild their resources from the tatters left after the Great War. Not a few \nare reduced to nothing when the dust settles. \nIn 1919, the United States outlaws alcohol, a culmination of years \nof temperance protests to the evils of drink. Instead of preventing \nalcohol consumption, Prohibition only encourages people to find ways \naround it. Organized crime grows exponentially from early gangs of \nrumrunners. Some Kindred on the fringes take the advantage to enter \ninto the business, become involved with the gangs or even use the \nspeakeasies as feeding-grounds. Those with ties to the police may either \naid and abet allies in the mob or use the police raids to move against \ncompetition. The growth of organized crime occasionally conflicts with \nvampiric power-bases, leading to shadowy wars against enemies that \nmany mobsters can barely believe in. The cauldron of Chicago’s orga- \nnized criminals versus the Cainites versus Elliot Ness and his \nUntouchables might make for a chronicle of both tommy-guns and \nshadowy predation. \nIn Oct. 1929, the Stock Market crashes, ruining lives and fortunes across \nthe US. Germany’s economy has collapsed two years prior in response to the \nGreat War. Several banks fail, trade drops and investments sink. The world \nis truly in the grip of misery. Many Kindred prefer not to speculate in risky \nventures, but some seeking opportunity get a rude awakening. What happens \nwhen a Kindred loses everything or when his best mortal allies hurl them- \nselves from the roofs after their fortunes collapse? \nThe new film industry spurs great interest among many young Toreador, \nwhile their elders decry it as “vulgar.” With the arrival of the first films, \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n4 \nKindred adventurous enough to enter a movie house see the sun rise and other \ndaylight activities they can barely remember. It also has its risks, as Obfus- \ncated vampires discover how their Discipline fails them under the camera. \nRadio also becomes a popular medium, especially for those wanting a crack at \nstardom without the risk of being seen by too many. No doubt a few Nosferatu \nfind this an excellent way to exercise talents that the Toreador disdain. How \nmany neonates skip Elysium or arrive late because they were listening to their \nfavorite radio show (to the dismay of their elders, of course)?The arrival of the \nsilent film “Nosferatu” with its mysterious leading man (a little-known actor \nby the name of Max Shreck) surely provokes panic for the Masquerade. \nFlorence Stoker, widow of Bram Stoker, launches a successful suit against the \nfilmmakers, and every print of the film is destroyed.. . or is it? \nThe relative silence of the Sabbat during this time ensures brisk \nactivity among Camarilla Kindred, although the silence is not from lack \nof interest on the part of the Sabbat. The Sabbat is engaged in the second \nof its destructive civil wars, brought about by fighting over the opportu- \nnities of the Great War and the early Depression. The Code of Milan, \ncreated in 1933, finally puts an end to the fighting, at least for the \nmoment. Like the mortals, they attempt to outlaw war between them- \nselves. Like the mortals, they are unsuccessful. \nWORLD \nWAR \nI I \nThe seeds sown at the table in Versailles bear bitter fruit in Germany. \nAdolph Hitler rises to the Chancellorship, claiming that he will restore \nGermany’s dignity and pride in itself. Even as he encourages pride in the \nTeutonic past, Hitler lays the blame for Germany’s misery squarely at the \nfeet of “undesirables,” especially Jews. Little by little, Jewish freedom is \nwhittled away. The beginning of open hostility arrives with Kristullnucht in \nNovember 1938. \nHitler enters Austria without incident in March of 1938, and Poland \nin September of 1939. France and England, fearing Hitler’s ambition, \ndeclare war too late. For its defiance, Britain suffers through a campaign \nof nightly air attacks called the Blitzkrieg (“lightning war”). Many Britons \nspend their nights huddling in the subways tunnels below London or \nhiding in backyard bomb shelters. Some brave souls stand watch on the \nroofs of historical buildings like St. Paul’s Cathedral, ready with buckets \nof water to douse any blaze and are often thanked generously (if covertly) \nby Kindred who would prefer not to see London in flames again (the Great \nFire of 1666 was enough for them). Children are evacuated across the sea \nfrom besieged London (perhaps along with precious childer) until the u- \nboats target the vessels, then to the English countryside. Meanwhile, \nFrance endures Nazi occupation, and worse, the personal betrayal of the \nVichy government as their own countrymen work with the invaders. \nEverywhere the Nazis go, the Jews are deported and put on trains of cattle \ncars, bound for the work camps or gas chambers. \nAmerica’s situation on the homefront was one of readiness and \nsacrifice for the war effort. Women gave up their silk hose for parachutes \nand went to work in the factories, families grew victory gardens and lived \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n4 \nI \non rations of butter, sugar and meat. Having witnessed how the British \nwere faring, their attitude was to be prepared for anything that came their \nway. It didn’t help that America had two fronts to watch - \nthose on the \nEast Coast feared the Germans, but those on the West Coast feared the \nJapanese, especially after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Thinking to avert a \npotential crisis of Japanese spies in their midst, the government orders all \nJapanese-Americans into internment camps. Such a “solution” could \nsurely bring out Cathayan vampires, enraged at the treatment of their \nrelatives. It is also not unlikely that some unscrupulous Kindred haunt the \nbarracks of Topaz and other camps for feeding grounds, or suddenly find \ncertain contacts have been shipped off. \nRumors occasionally circulate regarding how the Tremere’s Vienna \nstronghold survived the Anschloss when Hitler’s army entered Austria, \nand none speak well of the Tremere. European Kindred either find new \nplaces to hide or flee the violence by sailing for America. Trans-Atlantic \ncrossings grow increasingly dangerous as the war progresses, risking the \nvarious blockades and military vessels prowling the waters. Should Kin- \ndred survive the passage, there’s not necessarily going to be room in the \ncity when they arrive- \nmany cities strain to the breaking point as \nbalances of power teeter with the arrival of Old-world newcomers. The \nAmerican Kindred are not always glad to see their European relatives \n(particularly when Old World demands for power and respect are made), \nand the risks to the Masquerade skyrocket when a dozen more mouths to \nfeed show up. A “homefront” chronicle can be an excellent choice for \nthose wishing to run a story during wartime with a large range of characters \nor without getting into theatres of war. \nTHE \nHOLOCAUST \nWhile many Kindred brag about their body counts, or how one more \nmassacre is hardly different from the rest, the Holocaust strikes a dissonant \nchord throughout the World of Darkness. The numbers stagger - \ncountless \n“undesirables” from homosexuals to political dissidents to Jehovah’s Wit- \nnesses, thousands of Rrom and six million Jews. Rarely has genocide been \npracticed on such a massive scale, with such methodical precision or with \nsuch complete cooperation. \nFor all their bragging about their close ties to the Rrom, neither the \nGangrel nor the Ravnos do much to help their “favored” Herds’ suffering. Dark \nrumors still circulate that unscrupulous Tremere and Tzimisce used camp \nvictims as subjects for unsavory experiments, while opportunistic vampires of \nthe Camarilla and Sabbat haunted the barracks as feeding grounds. \nSeveral international organizations make it their business to track those \nNazis who escaped justice following the war, and most keep detailed files of \nofficers and camp officials, including photographs. A Kindred who appears no \ndifferent from his 1939 photos is going to attract immediate attention from \nNazi-hunters. Agencies like Mossad or Interpol often have international \ncooperation, and even the Inquisition is hard-pressed to keep up with these \nzealous hunters. Very few princes are likely to be pleased when a former war \ncriminal Kindred brings such hunters to his door. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nT ~ ~ ‘ 5 0 . s  \nThe years following the end of World War I1 and the atomic bomb on \nHiroshima find Kindred young and old reconsidering the mortal world with \nfrightened eyes. Humanity finally has the power to wipe the planet clean of \nall life for centuries with the atomic bomb. What would these people do if they \nencounter vampires in their midst? The Masquerade takes on paramount \nimportance: Even the youngest neonates are impressed with the seriousness \nof the situation in a way that elders’ droning tales of the Burning Times never \nreached them. Across Europe, the Iron Curtain drops across countries under \nthe shadow of communism, along with a concomitant Shadow Curtain that \ntraps many supernaturals behind barbed wire and stranger barriers. \nThe McCarthy hearings and the hunt for Communists spur many \nelders to dive for cover as they begin to emerge from the nights of WWII. \nAs names are blacklisted, and people are called up to explain their “un- \nAmerican” activities or hounded out of town for being too different, many \nelder Kindred are uncomfortably reminded of the witch-hunts of centuries \nprevious. While elders might prefer to lay low and wait for more hospitable \ntimes, neonates and ancillae who can adapt to change (and stay out of \nMcCarthy’s searchlights) are likely to find this time ripe with potential. \nThere is a great deal of rebuilding going on, and for some, this is an \nunparalleled opportunity to get in on the ground floor when someone \nabruptly disappears. Likewise, some Kindred lose valuable mortal allies \nwhen they are called before the Senate committees and lose the jobs that \nmade them so valuable. \nClashes between counter-culture versus the mainstream start to erupt, \nand in some cases, it’s hard to tell which side is which. Rock-n-roll, with its \nmongrel musical pedigree, starts out as rebellion, but the end of the decade \nsees Elvis, Buddy Holly, the Beatles and similar stars rocketing into the \nmainstream. Is television tripe, or a new medium? Surely there are neonates \nand ancillae finding excuses to skip Elysium when it conflicts with “The \nHoneymooners.” What of the Beat writers? Some elders may simply smile \naway most of the changes as the energy of youth is funneled into “accept- \nable” channels while others may fret about the potential rebellion that rock \nmusic may be breeding. The Toreador surely have much fuel for debate in \nthe Elysia over the decade \nA third civil war erupts among the Sabbat in 1957, lasting only about \n100 nights. Disease from careless feeding and Embraces racks the rank- \nand-file. Joseph Pander leads the Caitiff against the Sabbat leadership to \ndemand more than simply the right to exist. The treaty results in the \ncreation of the Panders, a “clan” of the Clanless. It is generally viewed by \nthe Caitiff leadership and older members as a bone thrown, but it does \nkeep the rabble quiet. \nT ~ 6 ‘ 6 0 s  \nThe ‘60s are a time of violent social change. Many youth rebel against \nthe strictures of the  OS, raging against social norms, what they perceive \nas a wasteful conflict in Vietnam and the very real potential of the world \ngoing up in flames. Minorities agitate for long-overdue change, demand- \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ning the right to be treated as human beings. Artists stretch their bound- \naries and push the envelope in every medium. Everywhere, it’s about going \nagainst the “Establishment,” against a grain too staid for its own good. \nHow are newly Embraced Kindred youth likely to view elders and princes? \nComing in from the Cold War, where the young mortals don’t trust their \nelders not to push the button that starts Armageddon for personal gain, \nneonates perceive vampiric elders as even less trustworthy. This time sees \nmassive defections to the anarch cause and even open rebellion against \nolder Kindred. \nCounterculture of this time includes music even wilder than the \nprevious decade, with the Doors, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. Neonates \nmay be found down at Whiskey-A-Go-Go in Los Angeles or in the Haight \nneighborhood of San Francisco seeking new excitement. Depending on \nwhere Kindred feed, there’s every chance that they may encounter a drug- \nusing vessel, and psychotropic drugs can induce all sorts of interesting \neffects. The darker side includes personality cults, such as Charlie Manson, \ndrawing the disaffected to their banners. With so many mortal gurus, who \nwould notice the few vampires who gather similar herds for blood or money? \nThe struggle for civil rights for African-Americans culminates \nduring this time, with marches, lunch counter sit-ins, boycotts and \nrallies by leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Further north, \nMalcolm X and the Nation of Islam seek similar goals but with far \ndifferent means and words. Kindred with any interest in the mortal \nworld cannot help but become enveloped by the conflict. Blacks in any \nclan are likely stirred by events in the mortal world, while some elders \nsee the makings of another Anarch Revolt (after all, it was peasants \nagitating for rights from their lords that was the cover for the original). \nElysia may find their claims of non-violence within their walls hard to \nmaintain when racist Kindred clash with their black or more civil- \nminded brethren. The race riots that rock many cities following the \nassassination of Dr. King leave them in flames, with vampires scram- \nbling to get out of the way of rioting mobs. \nTH \ne MODERN \nNIC~HTS \nThe modern nights are all about change, usually swift and often \nviolent. This is where most chronicles are set, and where many \nneonates knew their breathing days, starting from the ‘70s. A leader \nassassinated, a fashion trend begun or ended, a hiccup in the stock \nmarket, and the world will know in the blink of an eye via television \nor the Internet. Even some neonates are occasionally rushing to keep \nup with changes, while their elders are nearly paralyzed with fright by \nthe wild, headlong rush of progress. Many fear the imminent approach \nof Gehenna nightly, and as the world hurtles into the 21st century, \nperhaps they are not so wrong. \nThe Gothic-Punk sensibility that so characterizes the World of \nDarkness originates from the twin movements of punk and Goth, two \nmusical waves spawned by popular culture. Lyrics turn to disturbing \nsubject matter, such as war, drugs, insanity or murder. The musical \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nextreme first evolves to punk, which boils out of London and spills over \nto the United States. The lyrics revolve around violent material, the \nmusic is equally so. Punk seems to be all about violence, speed, hard \nedges and garish colors, and it is the pierced flesh, angry rebellion and \nclenched fists that it lends to the World of Darkness. Bands like the Sex \nPistols and the Ramones characterize the music, while metal spikes, \nbrightly dyed hair, combat boots and battered leather characterize the \nlook. The hedonism of punk bands often draws neonates to their \nbanners, and many young vampires find the music an excellent way to \nirritate their elders. The Goth movement grows out of punk, a shift from \nthe garish to shadowy, from the wild to the eerie. Goth bands include \nSiouxie and the Banshees, Bauhaus and Sisters of Mercy, and the range \nof music runs broader, from ethereal haunting tunes to rapid beats \nbacked with a clashing guitar. The movement emphasizes the darker side \nof life, whether that be in desperation or violence, and offers Gothic- \nPunk flowing black, morbid outlooks, ornate architecture and the \nunrelenting despair found in the cities. \nThe modern nights also see a new trend toward vampires as “fash- \nionable.”From bands that describe romantic death to sub-culture practices \nof blood-drinking and biting during sex to popular novels and film, \nvampires are suddenly “in.” While in many ways the excitement re- \nsembles the flap over Dracula all over again, some Kindred worry that \nthis time, there are more potential ways to break the Masquerade: \nIgnorant mortal youths pretending to be vampires may bring harder \nscrutiny from mortal authorities (and who knows when one of those \nscrutinizing might be someone who knows the truth?). Neonates more \noften see it as excellent cover for their own activities, and occasionally \nsome Caitiff hide themselves among the pretenders, using the mortal \nwannabes for their own protection. \nW H E N  YOU HAVETO \nSAY No \nRecall how often in Laws of the Night we said, “Try to avoid saying ‘no’ \noutright” or something similar? Well, we lied. Sometimes, someone comes \nto you with a character concept, a story idea or a character action that you \nfind unacceptable. Could it be the player who can barely fake being sick who \nwants to create an elder? Maybe it’s the Nosferatu whose information \ncontinually skirts into meta-gaming territory, or the Tremere who insists \nthat he can create nuclear material with Alchemy. Whatever it is, you have \ntrouble in the works, and it comes in the form of a player looking at you with \nsoulful eyes. And here’s one of the most onerous tasks of the Storyteller - \ndenying a request. \nMany times, certain requests can be dismissed with the wave of a hand: \n“Can I buy Garou Lore, ‘cause my Gangrel ran with a pack and got made an \nhonorary Garou?” Other times, it takes a bit more planning: “Hey, can my \nToreador buy Health Influence?”( when you’ve capped the Influence). What- \never sort of denial it must be, here’s some ways to get to it. \nLet’s say Joe Player made a request that made your hair curl, mostly \nbecause he apparently pulled it out of his butt without any rhyme or reasons \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n(“Hey, I want my character to learn Swahili!”). There’s nothing wrong with \nasking him to explain the what and wherefore of this new enterprise (‘IS0 \nwhy do you want to learn this, and how are you going to go about doing it?“). \nAfter all, nothing exists in a vacuum - \neven the character wanting to \nimprove his culture can be a good enough reason. Sometimes, a subtle \nreminder to the player to think before asking can save a great deal of grief \nand give you some insight into where your players are going (not to mention \nconsidering some story seeds for later). If Joe still can’t come up with a \ndecent reason why his character should have Swahili, hasn’t got a clue \nwhere his character is going to learn this and can’t give you a single reason \nin the world why he should have it, then the answer can be no. This same \napproach can be used for someone who comes up with a character concept \nthat just looks like a bunch of neat tricks held together with safety pins and \nbaling wire - \nthe sample character creations in the main rulebooks should \ngive you some ideas about how a Storyteller sits down with a player and says, \nin the nicest, most sincere tone she can muster: “What were you thinking?” \nSo you said “no,” because it needed saying - \ngreat. Then comes \nthe dreaded “But why?” So, why did you do it? If you can’t come up with \na reason beyond, “’Cause it was stupid,” you’re going to look a little \nfoolish yourself. When choosing to deny something, remember why \nyou’re doing it. Is it because the the player didn’t think enough about \nthe concept? Point it out to her - she may not realize she did \nsomething less than stellar. What about someone who’s attempting to \nbuy more Influence in a category that’s become saturated? Perhaps \nshow her in downtime that all her efforts just aren’t panning out. The \nflat-out “NO” with no further discussion behind it whatsoever should \nbe used only in extreme cases, like the Bastet Abomination with \nNumina and Spheres. Once you come up with a reason, make it sound, \nstick to it and remember it. It looks very fishy when you deny some- \nthing to one player then give it to another. \nL A Y I N ~ T H E  \nC ~ R B A T  SMACKDOWN \nThese are the days when you have great sympathy and respect for parents \neverywhere: You’ve got to discipline someone who’s being a problem. The girl \nwho keeps showing up late and disrupting the action in a major way when she \ndoes make her grand entrance. The guy who likes showing off his cast of \ncartoon-voice imitations. Whatever they’re doing, they’re being a problem, \nand it’s yours to solve, ‘cause you’re the Storyteller. \nMany times, the player isn’t aware he’s being problematic. Snag him \nwhen he comes in the door or at a time outside the game and sit him down for \na private chat. Lay out your grievance clearly (“Joe, I really wish you would \nquit breaking character to quote Star Wars, because it’s disruptive to the \nmood.) and what you would like to see done about it (“Could you save your \nrepertoire for another time?”). Don’t leave the table until you have something \nsettled. Be clear in what the problem is and what you want to see done about \nit so there’s no confusion over what’s at stake. \nOkay, you had your private talk with Joe Player about his inappropriate \nbehavior, and you thought he’d listened. Nope -next week, his Jar-Jar Binks \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nimitation can be heard across the Elysium. If you know some of Joe’s friends, \nthen ask them if they could point out to him that he’s being a pain; they may \nbe equally bugged by his behavior. If they know you’re unhappy, that can give \nthem a little incentive to help their friend avoid the Storyteller’s wrath. Plus, \nhe might be more inclined to listen to his friends rather than enduring the \nStoryteller’s “nagging.” \nUnfortunately, a figurative smack upside the head does occasionally \nseem to be the only thing that some problem people hear. It could be the \ndocking of an experience point or unwelcome attention from the prince \n(some Old-world princes might look very dimly on hearing some wise-ass \nYoda quote during court). However it’s done, it should be done consistently \nevery time Joe misbehaves. This should be a stick reserved for repeat offenses \nwhen the previous two suggestions have failed to produce results. A sudden \nand immediate use of this stick for a first-time offense that was in all likelihood \nan honest mistake is a bit harsh. \nFinally there’s the most extreme case, the one who will not listen, the \none where you’ve tried everything in the book, the one who’s become \nquite literally the bane of your game, or the one that did something so \ngrievous it bypasses the other three options (the player showed up trashed \nor broke one of the major rules of MET). That’s when you ask the \ntroublemaker to please leave and not let the door hit him on the way out. \nState that you have asked the player to mend his ways, that he has not \nlived up to that and that you are not going to let him disrupt other players’ \nfun. He may stomp out and say that’s the end. Well, that may be, but you \nhave a troupe to worry about. Again, this is the most extreme case and a \nlast resort. It’s unpleasant when it must be done, but if it means the health \nof your chronicle, then swallow hard. \nI CAN’T \nD o  THAT \nBECAUSE... \nHow many times have you come up with a plot idea, started developing \nit, then suddenly got cold feet? Chances are, one of the motives down below \nhad something to do with it. \n... I Don’t Know Enough About X \nHie yourself to the library or the Internet and do some honest-to- \ngoodness research - \nit’s that simple. You don’t need to become an expert on \nthe subject, but you do need to have some basics to start the plot rolling, and \nyou’ll need to know where to go when the questions start flying. There’s very \nlittle that can make you look more foolish than looking at a player’s well- \nthought-out question and giving some half-baked answer that is really, ‘‘I \ndunno.” This does not mean you need to go break into the CDC to find out \nif it can be done; there are some lines that should not be crossed. If you find \nyourself dealing with such a subject, get out your God-given imagination and \nput it to work. \n... Someone Might Get Offended \nA wise Storyteller takes into consideration when material might be \noffensive. Hot topics such as religion, intolerance, race relations or \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nsexuality can result in hurt feelings out of game if they’re handled \ninappropriately. If you’re thinking about taking the game in a new \ndirection that includes such material, send out a feeler or two to see if the \ntopic pushes the wrong buttons or if your troupe is ready to handle a \nchallenge. Keep a weather eye out for players who are suddenly reluctant \nto come to the game or who are being unusually combative. This assumes, \nof course, that you’re treating the material with respect and dignity. If \nyou’re throwing in rape, domestic violence, child abuse or other touchy \ntopics without thought or for shock value, don’t look surprised when folks \nget mad enough to walk. \n... So-and-so Threatened to Walk Because She Said the Story Would \nWreck Her Character \nNever allow a player to hold the game hostage to her whims. Just because \nsomeone’s a prince/elder/big cheese does not make her the be-all end-all. If \nshe did something foolish in character (such as break the Masquerade on \nnational television), then she deserves what comes next. Call her bluff. If she \ndoes decide to walk, then let her. You don’t need such aggravation. \n... It’s Too Big/Complicated \nDon’t automatically discard an idea because you think it’s too big - \ndreaming big comes naturally with Storytelling. Better to think realistically, \nsuch as whether you have adequate resources to Storytell such a plotline in its \nentirety. Will you have enough Narrators to assist you? Will the plotline as \nit stands snag player interest? Sometimes things that look too large can be \nbroken down into parts that are easier to swallow: You may find that you have \nseveral (smaller) plotlines that could eventually lead back to your original \nidea. You may also find that out of these broken-up parts, you have a plot \nthread that’s more clearly defined than the first. \n... It’s a Dumb Idea \nThree film students get lost in the woods making a movie. A bunch of girls \nstart having seizures and blame it on witchcraft. Dinosaurs are re-created with \nDNA found in old mosquitoes. The only dumb idea is one that hasn’t been \ntried. Presentation is what makes or breaks an idea. If you’re psyched about the \nidea and let the players know you’re psyched by how you present the idea \n(news stories, richly descriptive scenes), that will get them interested. Players \ncan sense when you’re not giving a scene your all, and if you think that \nsomething’s corny, they will pick up on that and find it difficult to follow the \nmaterial too. \n... The Material Is Too Mature \nThis can go a number of directions. Stop and look at the whole \nequation. Does your player base consist of mostly young players? Do you \nfind yourself running a chronicle for a bunch of gun bunnies who prefer to \nshoot first and think later? Do you have some players who have some \npersonal, out-of-game stake in the material you’re about to present or who \nare shy about getting involved? \nWith younger players, you may have players who are not socially \nor emotionally ready for what you’re planning, and your game is \nprobably not the place for them to learn about it. Redirect such \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmaterial away from them entirely or replace it. If there’s discomfort or \nanger from folks, stop immediately. If you learn someone has an out-of- \ncharacter tie to the issue, ask him how he’d like to handle it, and be \nopen to what he has to say, including, “Um, could I just not follow this \nanymore?” It’s a lot less headache to adjust a plotline than to lose a \nplayer to bad feelings. In the case of the gun bunnies, a mature topic \nmight be a good addition to the game to subtly (or not so subtly) prod \nthe players into improving their roleplaying. \n... People will think I’m a (Fill in the Blank) \nPervert - \nRacist - \nHomophobe - \nAnti-Semite - \nwhatever. \nOne of the most delicate areas to walk through as a Storyteller is when \nthe story calls for a character to behave in a hateful way, one that may hurt \nfeelings out of game. In simple, make it clear to folks that you the person \ndo not believe in what this character is saying. Even a quick, “Hey, just \nwanted to say, I’m not this sort of asshole in real life,” at the end or \nbeginning of the scene can be all it takes. Treat the material with dignity, \nwhich sounds odd, but translates to, “Don’t be gratutious. Unless it serves \na purpose, don’t use it.” \n... Something Just Doesn’t Feel Right \nWe all have a gut feeling left over from the human race’s early days \nof hunting and gathering - \nthat little voice in the ear or the metaphysi- \ncal tap on the shoulder that tells us when something might not be \nkosher. It’s better known as instinct. If your instinct is sending off alarm \nbells, tapping your shoulder or otherwise alerting you, stop a moment \nand try to pin down what the problem is. Is it the subject or theme of a \nnew plotline? Is it a player who’s being unusually canny about avoiding \ncertain perils? Is it the sudden decrease in Tremere characters? Did a \nnormally outgoing player suddenly get very quiet when you introduced \na plotline that included rape or a stalker? \nInstinct isn’t usually one for false alarms. We have that little feeling for \na reason, whether it was to warn us about walking into‘a cave that might be \na bear’s den or to point out a game problem we’ve been rationalizing away. If \nit’s a player, find her out of game and have a talk or make a discreet inquiry \namong people you trust. If there’s a genuine problem, then get busy with it. \nTHE \nSMART PLAYER \n~ \nYou spent months plotting out this puzzler, convinced that most of your \nplayers would spend the next year working on it. It was full of pitfalls, from \nInfluence traps to red-herring research. You released it into the chronicle on \nSaturday. Two months later, you realize that one player, through her character’s \nsavvy research and detective work, is about to crack the whole thing wide \nopen. Influence traps? She avoided them by her own regular actions of \nnetworking and cover-up. Pitfalls? A couple of them slowed her down, but not \nfor long. Congratulations - \nyou have a smart player! \nSmart players can be as much burden as they are boon. It can be very \nhelpful to have go-get-‘em folks who love to worry at a puzzle like a dog \nwith a bone. These folks can please themselves for hours on end while \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nthey hunt for clues and come up with some surprising finds, and often \nwithout much help from you. They are often proactive people in the \nchronicle who are good at making their own fun and at involving other \ncharacters to assist their research. On the other hand, it can drag down \nthings tremendously to have a player who nitpicks every detail and \ndemands that every inquiry be answered encyclopedically, not to men- \ntion a player whose entertainment needs exceed what the average player \nbase wants. At worst, such players can easily get bored and act up in ways \nthat can rip a chronicle apart, just so they can have a challenge (not \nunlike gifted students in a “normal” class). \nDon’t punish a smart player whose character is a good research hound or \nwho manages to avoid the pitfalls that other players seem to walk into. You’re \nwasting a potentially valuable resource, not to mention that it sends the \nmessage that you punish players who “ruin” your clever plotting. Instead, \nthink about what you can do to prolong her run enough to get things caught \nup, or how you can utilize this underestimated resource. \nNever underestimate the value of the red herring. Even Jung and \nEinstein followed wild tangents or lines of research that never panned \nout and gone some interesting places in the process. The red herring is \na fine way to buy some time should a plot be in danger of getting busted \nopen too soon. However, don’t get dependent on them - \nthere’s a point \nwhere it’s going to look painfully obvious. Remember what you threw \nout in this go-around, because a red herring for this plotline may be a \nsignpost to something else. \nSome smart players enjoy being smart by themselves, i.e., they hoard \ntheir hard-won information, gloat over their hoard like a miser with his gold, \nand don’t share well. Consider throwing a nugget into another player’s \npossession through his downtime or another line of research he’s working on. \nEventually the hunter’s going to have to come out and socialize for that clue \nand will hopefully do so well. Done properly, this can slow down your target \nfor a couple months, particularly if the other character has all the recalci- \ntrance of a snapping turtle. A few such redirections can keep the player going \nwithout being aware of getting slowed down. \nPlayers who are heavily into researching and hunting for clues eat up \nthings like history and background. Most Storytellers create large histories \nfor their chronicles to explain how their cities and Kindred relations got to \ntheir current state. How much of that ever gets seen by the players? Probably \nnot a lot, and that can be a little discouraging to think that all that work is \ngoing to go unseen. If you have a player who loves to research and piece \nthings together from the past, consider mining some tidbits from your back \nstory and seeding them into her downtime results (if they’re relevant). It \ncan be a great way to get some of that grunt work you did into play. And you \nnever know if the seed you planted early on will blossom into a full-fledged \nplot down the road. \nOn the flip side, there’s covering the bases, and then there’s just plain \nridiculous. For example, the player of a Salubri is researching a disease that’s \nrecently cropped up among Kindred. The player also just read The Hot Zone \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n(which details the discovery of the ebola virus) and has more than a passing \ninterest in diseases like ebola, so she asks some pretty penetrating questions \nof the Storyteller - \nshe’s asking if she can use Obeah even when she’s in an \nisolation suit, trying to determine what type of virus it is, plotting out five \ndifferent courses of research (and has given you outlines of everything). The \nStoryteller also read The Hot Zone and some articles on the Web, but hasn’t \ndone nearly the same amount research as the player. Now what? On one \nhand, it’s cool to see that the player is getting so much enjoyment out of the \nplot; on the other hand, trying to follow five courses of research is a tad \nmuch. Your best bet is to acknowledge (however briefly) the work that the \nplayer put in to her downtime before you determine if she’s spent enough \ntime and resources to get certain answers. If nothing else, the player is \nreassured that you are at least looking at the downtime and not tossing \nanswers off the top of your head. Here’s a good place to point out that \nsometimes you may dig your own hole with this problem. If you’re the sort \nof Storyteller who likes to emphasize that the devil’s in the details (and the \nmost crucial ones always seem to be in the questions a player doesn’t ask), \nyou don’t have much room to gripe when your players start pulling 20 \nQuestions in their downtimes in an effort to cover their bases. \nSomeone can demolish puzzles without a thought, and now, bored, sets \nout to chase Praxis or primogen, or simply to wreak havoc. And all because \nhe’s bored. If he’s got that much extra energy, find out if he’d be good to put \non detail as an Assistant Storyteller, perhaps doing research for you or writing \nin-character news articles. It works out some of the boundless creativity and \nwill either shut him up when he starts griping about some problem in the \ngame, or he’ll learn to put his money where his mouth is. \nSome players find it irritating that they must have a particular \nknowledge or Ability to even attempt to learn something-after \nall, their \ncharacters have gone to high school (or college) and learned the basics, \nand now they can’t even tell a da Vinci from a Monet? There are cases \nwhere it’s entirely necessary to demand specialized skills for research. \nSomeone with Science: Entomology should have a better chance at iden- \ntifying a weird little moth than someone who’s simply using Academics or \neven Science: Biology. On the other hand, demanding that someone have \nArt History to do any sort of research on, say, the Mona Lisa, is frankly \nridiculous. You may choose to ask them what Abilities, Backgrounds, \nInfluences and other relevant material they’re bringing to the table when \nthey’re doing their research if there’s a particular point that you feel \nshould go to someone who has a better toehold on the material (special- \nized study may allow someone to skip the basics that someone without that \nknowledge will have to wade through). \nObviously, there’s a fine line between a player who makes a logical leap \nand one who metagames, and that line makes all the difference. If you’re \nconcerned that someone is metagaming rather than puzzle-solving, it’s not \nout of line to ask her to show her paper trail. If something still looks fishy, have \nher work at it a little more, but don’t just toss her off. Something concrete like, \n“Most of your contacts have told you everything they can think of and \nprobably some stuff they’ve made up, and they’ve run out of things to tell you \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\non this particular topic that you don’t already know ....” has a lot more \nmeaning (not to mention story value) than “You come to a dead end.” \nTHE \nINEORMATION \nA ~ E  \nThe Internet and e-mail are here and have settled in for what looks \nlike a very long stay. Further, your savvy players have commandeered the \nInternet and e-mail as part and parcel of the game. Bad news? Only if you \nlook at it that way. E-mail and the Internet can be one of your chronicle’s \nbest friends if properly harnessed. For all the good it can do, the Web can \nalso be a thorn in your metaphysical side. That big 01’ Internet can be a \nmighty scary place, and unfortunately, sometimes what you put in isn’t \nalways what you get back. \nT H E  \nWEB As YOUR ERIEND \nIf you work odd hours or have players that do, e-mail can be a very helpful \nway to keep up communications instead of wasting a couple hours playing \nphone tag. It allows you to think about your answers and can provide a handy \npaper trail if things are disputed, or you have a less-than-perfect memory. E- \nmail lists can take care of a number of matters, from announcements from the \nprince to news regarding the game’s more mundane aspects. Some games use \nthem to put out news stories of events that are taking place in their city, from \nconventions to strange murders. \nA Web site can be a fine place to throw lots of hard facts about the game, \nboth story and mundane - \nvenue descriptions, dates and times, directions, \ncharacter creation limits. A single URL at the bottom of your flyer can \ndirect potential new players to all the neat stuff you’d tell them about if you \ncould stand at that flyer 24 hours a day. For players, this can be a spot to find \nout about an out-of-character social, get those last-minute directions or \nlearn about the venue before bringing in an inappropriate character. If \nanyone is feeling really adventurous, e-mail links to characters and Story- \ntellers, game pictures, rogue’s galleries of characters, PDF files of character \nsheets and links to the coffeehouse the troupe patronizes can add pizzazz to \nsomething straightforward. \nThe Web can be an invaluable research tool for digging up answers on \na subject you barely know. A simple query in a search engine can return \nmany places to research to your heart’s content; no matter how exotic the \nsubject, chances are someone out there knows about it. E-commerce and \nsearch engines are useful for hunting up the existence of an object or service \nwhose legitimacy is questionable (“So you want a million-candlepower \nhand-held spotlight? If you can find it, I’ll consider it.”). It can also put you \nin touch with other games that might be interested in linking plots or \nallowing players to travel. \nT H E W E B A S Y O U R E O E  \nMany times, players get into blue-booking online, whether by chat or \ne-mail, working out scenes and coming into play with all manner of new \nconnections, Status and whatever, that you’ve never seen before. While \nthere’s nothing wrong with this - \nmost often it’s simple conversation or \nexchanges that don’t need a Storyteller’s eye - \nit can be baffling or even \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ndamaging to a plot to suddenly find out that the prince decided to Summon \nhis favorite anarch scapegoat to his office for the purposes of killing him \nwithout so much as a by-your-leave from you. Suggest that those who want \nto do more than talk take up the situation with a Narrator. If challenges start \nflying or things get complicated, that should automatically put it in the \nprovince of Storyteller staff. Even the most trustworthy players can get \nbogged down in who said what away from the eyes of authority. \nFor good or ill, just about anything can be found on the Web now, from \nthe latest headlines to catalogue shopping to hate speech or worse. A simple \nsearch on bomb-making can snag an enterprising soul dozens of links. You’re \ngoing to have to consider how to answer the player who claims that his anarch \ncharacter has been downloading information on making pipe-bombs and now \nwants to use that information for fun and profit. Just because someone can dig \nit up does not mean you have to let him have it, and there are several ways you \ncan deal with the issue. Perhaps the anarch has been unwittingly chatting \nwith an undercover federal agent (which will bring a whole new set of \nproblems - \nMasquerade breach, perhaps?) or forgot to turn off the cookies \nduring his last excursion. An e-mail program like Carnivore - \nwhich was \ndesigned to find and read the e-mails of terrorists or other users who’ve been \nflagged for various reasons -could \ntake untoward interest in said anarch (or \nany other Kindred’s mail for that matter). The “disruption of service” \nhackings of Yahoo!, Amazon.com and other Web giants may make some Net- \nsavvy Kindred tremble - \nif a couple of kids with too much time and RAM \ncould bring these sites to their knees, what happens if they turn their attention \non a Kindred site, or if they get Embraced by the enemy? And even if you don’t \nmake use of those stumbling blocks, who’s to say that the information your \nanarch got was correct? (“Was that 50 blasting caps or 500?”) \nOn a more serious note, in this age of school shootings and domestic \nterrorism, there are real-life people and groups who take an interest in those \nwho do nightly searches in hate-speech sites or other dangerous places, or who \npost to these sites. Watch your step and be very careful who you start chatting \nwith. An over-enthusiastic agent might be hard-pressed to figure out what’s \nthe more interesting threat - \nsomeone researching bomb-making, or some- \none who pretends to be a vampire that’s researching bomb-making. \nT H E  \nWIRED \nA N D T H E  UNHOOKED \nStrange as some people might think it, not everyone is wired for the Web, \nor has only sporadic access at best. It could be the computer is in the dumps, \nthey can’t afford computer access, or they must rely on someone else’s charity. \nIn which case, if your group has become very Web-dependent, you may have \na minority group that is constantly in the dark about last-minute changes or \nother important matters. It only takes one sudden change of location to piss \noff a lot of uninformed people. There are few clearer illustrations of haves \nversus have-nots than the matter of Internet access. \nIf your group is in the habit of meeting between games, use that time to \ncatch up non-Webby folks on anything important that went out over the wire \nor list. While many character announcements have a way of filtering back to \nthe necessary folks, game announcements have a similar way of getting lost. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nA “newspaper” with the week’s news articles and Storyteller news can be an \nexcellent way of keeping the non-wired folks in touch. It doesn’t have to look \nfancy, so long as it’s functional. \nFolks who like to stay in touch via cell phones and pagers (but don’t have \ncomputers) may also bring back that relic of elementary school and scout \ntroop - \nthe phone tree. The gist of it (for those who don’t recall) is that one \nperson is responsible for calling two other people, and those two people each \ncall two people and soon. While some might mumble about it being primitive, \nit may be helpful to the Storyteller and allows folks to stay in touch. Besides, \nif there’s a server or router problem, what happens then? \nSCENE DESCRIPTION \n- \nMORE B A N ~ ~ O R T H E  \nBUCK \nYou’ve got your three players arrayed before you. They’re getting \nready for you to narrate a scene where the three of them will work on \npatching up a Masquerade breach at a night club. You say, “You come in \nand see the following: a bar to the left, an open DJ booth to the right, about \n50 people on the dance floor and two dozen more around the three pool \ntables in the back. What do you do?” You can’t understand why they’re \nlooking at you a little vacantly. \nA description like that is right up there with the infamous, “You enter a \n10 by 10 room with four orcs and a box of unidentified treasure.” Players will \nfind it hard to get excited (much less interested) about the scene if they don’t \nknow what’s going on. They rely on you to set the stage that their characters \nwill strut and fret upon. You know what the place looks like in your head \n(don’t you?), but the players can’t see through your skull into that place you’re \nthinking of. So how do you go about getting a little more bang for the buck? \nWhen setting a stage, remember that we don’t merely look at what’s \nhappening before us and call it a scene. Humans (and Kindred) rely on their \nentire range of sensory input to give them information about what’s \nhappening around them, what might have happened in the past and what \nmight happen in the future. A complete scene involves all five senses. So \nwhen describing a location for your players, give thought not only to what \nthe place looks like visually, but what it sounds like, smells like, tastes like \nand feels like. To return to our earlier attempt at the night club: “The \nnightclub is a little hole-in-the-wall dive that probably only operates a few \ntimes a week in what used to be a dry cleaning shop. Several people in the \nlatest bondage and Goth gear stand outside smoking - \nthe smoke rising \nfrom one young man smells strangely sweet, almost like cherries. Inside, the \nthunderous industrial music is rattling anything not nailed down, including \nthe bottles behind the bar. The DJ booth perches over the crowd against one \nwall. The walls are cinderblock, painted black, and the black-and-white \nlinoleum dance floor is surrounded by enormous woofers and tweeters. \nAbout 50 young people are out on the floor, thrashing and swaying with the \nmusic. You inhale, and the combined smells of cigarettes, sweat, cheap \nfragrances and leather all rush down your nostrils and over your palate. The \nplace is crowded, and a rail-thin girl with white-blonde hair wearing scarlet \nvelvet brushes past you, glancing back for half a second to apologize. As you \nturn to speak, you catch a whiff of vitae on the passing girl.” \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSensory input is even more important to those using Auspex, who are \nroleplaying a physically impaired sense or who have derangements related \nto the senses. The absence, impairment or overstimulation of any particular \nsense can provoke amazing reactions; torturers the world over understand \nthis very well. In the case of someone playing a character who is deaf, blind \nor missing another sense like smell or taste, she’ll look to you for vivid \ndescriptions that her other senses will use to fill in the gap in her under- \nstanding. Someone who can hear but has a derangement that makes him \nnervous of certain sounds will want to know if his particular madness is \nthrobbing in response to stimuli. The Heightened Senses of Auspex in \nparticular need a great deal of detail - \nreading a letter by touch, smelling \na perfume to pull apart its components or focusing the sight to study the very \nbrushstrokes made by Rembrandt when he painted “The Night Watch” will \nall require you to delve a little deeper into the logistics of sensory percep- \ntion. That said, imagine what happens when that sense is overloaded - \nthe \nsensitized fingers get slammed with a hammer or the sharply focused eyes get \nstruck with a camera flash. No wonder vampires with overloaded Heightened \nSenses spend time stunned and dazed! \nAction is what makes things happen - \nseriously! When you’re describing \na scene, evocative words can go a long way to really nailing down how \nsomething looks to you and your players. Consider the following example: “As \nyou pass the alley, a miasma of piss, sweat and vitae wafts over you” versus “You \nsmell urine, sweat and Kindred blood when you walk by the alley.” Which one \npaints the more detailed picture? Boning up on your vocabulary will do \nwonders for scene description, as you pull out such lovely mouthfuls as \n“baroque,” “pandemic,” “untoward.” \nAll of us have “that song,” the one that we first kissed to, that we broke \nup to or that we’ve designated as our personal theme song. Movie music does \nthis in particular, leading viewers to understand subtext or emotional themes \nin a scene without necessarily stating them outright. The occasional piece of \nmusic can be crucial in helping your players think about the scene their \ncharacters are going through. A complex harpsichord piece can be indicative \nof an elder’s equally complex plots and older manners, while the quiet sound \nof a single koto invokes the tranquility of a formal Japanese garden. Music can \nhelp define the space that you’re setting aside for your players to create this \nscene; this isn’t the corner of the recreation basement or even the second \nroom of the Elysium. While the music plays, you’re in a Zen garden, an elder’s \nparlor or with a lovestruck ghoul. \nNot every Storyteller character must hinge on the plot, appear \nthere solely to deliver a line like the cauldron ghosts of Macbeth and \nthen depart. Sometimes, the best roleplaying can come from a chance \nencounter, something unexpected (just like real life) that must be \ndealt with and might even be a foreshadowing of things to come (the \nfirst encounter with an Ally). If you’re short on time or have a \nparticularly garrulous player, obviously you can adjust this. Still, \nchance encounters can make a scene sparkle - \nthe Indian man behind \nthe gas station counter who’s nervous of certain people, the child who \nsees through the Nosferatu’s Mask while he’s hunting, the elderly \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nwoman who asks for help carrying a bag of groceries. From small things \ndo bigger things grow.. . . \nASSISTANT \nSTORYTELLERS \nAND NARRATORS \nEver have a night where you wished you could clone yourself? Ever see the \nwarning, “If you’re struggling, go find some help”? Well, the cavalry is here! \nHere’s the different types and what you can do with them. \nNarrators are those folks who are in amongst the players, usually with \ntheir own characters, but who are available as necessary for challenges (such \nas Simple Tests, Virtue Challenges) or as an extra set of eyes when combat \nhits. Typically, Narrators are more rules-oriented, and the best seem to have \nencyclopedic memories regarding where every rule can be found and where \nare the three instances that contradict said rule. Still, they know when a \nchallenge needs to be seen by a Storyteller and when to let the Storyteller \ndo the talking. \nAssistant Storytellers do just that, assist the Storyteller with keeping \nthe chronicle on track. Often, an assistant is in charge of a particular \naspect of the game that needs watching, but the Storyteller is about to \ndrown in watching everything else - this could be Influences and \nBackgrounds, or maybe keeping a weather eye out for in-game Masquerade \nbreaches. Assistant Storytellers may or may not maintain their own \ncharacters, according to Storyteller needs for the game. They may play for \nstints, then take a shift at the Storyteller desk for those little emergencies \nlike watching a ritual be performed or running a minor scene while the \nStoryteller deals with something bigger. Some assistants even run their \nown subplots after getting permission from the Storyteller. It’s often from \namong these folks that the chronicle’s next Storyteller can be found. \nYou yourself know best how much help you need (and you’re never \nbeyond help) and where it should go. If your game is small, you may need \nonly one or two Narrators and a single Assistant Storyteller to run some \nsubplots for players to chew on each session. O n  the other hand, if you have \na large chronicle or some details that necessitate more attention (a number \nof inexperienced players, heavy use of Influences, a location that seems to \ngenerate a lot of character interest), then you’ll probably want more \nNarrators and at least two assistants to oversee the details that you’ve \nforgotten because you’re writing plot. Again, you know what will make your \ngame run better. \nIt’s a given that people will always find something to disagree about - \nit’s life. When you disagree with your Narrator or an Assistant Storyteller, it’s \nstill life, but you don’t want to have it out right there. Take it elsewhere. \nUnless the matter is so heinous that you can’t possibly let it go, take it \nelsewhere. Don’t scream at each other in public - \nit’s not nice to each other \nor to the players. If you disagree on a ruling, unless it’s so gross that you can’t \nlet it slide (or it means a character could live or die), let it roll for now. By \nconstantly overseeing and correcting their work, you indicate to your assis- \ntants that you don’t trust them fully, and if you show the players you don’t trust \nyour assistant’s rulings, they won’t trust them either. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTHOSE \nWHO HUNTTHE \nNIGHT \nTake a moment and think about the phrase “World of Darkness.” The \nfirst word says it all: It is a big world, and Kindred share its eternal night with \nmany other creatures. Some of the other denizens of the Gothic-Punk world \nare as indifferent to Kindred as the ghost of a long-dead centurion, while some \nare as hostile as a Lupine with a hangnail and a religious conviction that she \nshould slay all Kindred and let Gaia sort them out. You, as the Storyteller, help \npaint the backdrop that is this world. \nA crossover is a story or scene where one supernatural creature \nencounters another supernatural creature. Why allow crossovers? This \nis one of the first things that you must ask yourself as a Storyteller. After \nall, crossovers have a potential for disaster. Imagine a mixed Masquer- \nade and Apocalypse live-action game where the werewolf players are \nconvinced that they should know where all the Kindred Elysia are, but \nthat the Kindred should have no idea where the Garou caerns are. Here’s \na crossover that could have led to dead characters and unhappy players \nwhen the Kindred decide to enforce the sacredness of their own Elysium \nagainst the Lupine visitors; few things disrupt a quiet art gallery gather- \ning more than an attack by a pack of nine-foot tall, hairy, unwashed \nkilling-machines-for-Gaia. \nAnd yet crossover scenes can be very important in maintaining the feel \nof the World of Darkness. Where would the Giovanni be without their allies \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n(or foes) among the Restless Dead? What wielder of Spirit Thaumaturgy is \nnot afraid of hostile spirits and Lupines? Caine didn’t issue the warnings \nagainst the Wild Ones and moonbeasts just to take up space in the Book of \nNod. The important thing is to keep your crossover experience from \ndegenerating into an everyday experience, where the most exotic creatures \nare met with yawns and boredom. \nW H Y  CROSSOVERS \nHAPPEN \nCrossovers can happen for many reasons, but common themes include \nvying for resources or dominance, and the search for forgotten lore or \nlegends. Supernatural creatures that are hostile to each other sometimes \nhave common enemies - \nafter all: “The enemy of my enemy is my ally.” \nAnd there’s nothing like the confusion that reigns when one group discov- \ners its favorite hang-out has been staked as sacred by some band of \nill-tempered (and powerful) thugs. \nCrossovers can easily happen when a Cainite with a high Humanity \nscore tries to clean up the city and starts encountering Wyrm-tainted \nfomori or other fell creatures who normally battle Lupines. Will the \nLupines start wondering who’s doing their work, and how will they \nreward their “helper” when they do learn? What of a Giovanni who \ntemporarily devotes her efforts to fighting a particularly nasty Spectre \nwho also preys on a local Circle of Renegade wraiths? Will the Circle \ncontinue to ally with her, or is she merely taking care of the Spectre \nbecause he’s muscling in on her turf? While the status quo antagonism \nwill return when the threat is gone, these crossovers can lead to mutual \nrespect and common ground. \nCrossovers can also happen when one type of supernatural denizen \nattempts to play King of the Hill. Consider the frustration of the Nosferatu \nwho tries to boot a sluagh from “his” sewers and later discovers that someone \nis mysteriously and repeatedly draining his spawning pool, yet does not show \nup on cameras in and out of the area (nasty little chimera!). What of the \nTremere regent who finds herself racing with a local Uktena Theurge and \nmortal Ancient Order of the Aeon Rites coven to recover a lost talisman of \nsorcerous power? These crossovers can lead to double-crosses and outright \nhostility, so manage them carefully. \nFinally, sometimes a Cainite’s search for hidden and forgotten lore can \nlead him to consult with strange creatures; a Kiasyd might contact the local \nKithain (who have heard of such creatures in the vaguest of legends, if at all), \nor a Gangrel unraveling a mystery might be directed to a local Bone Gnawer \nby Kinfolk. All of these crossovers can be rewarding or disastrous depending \nupon how you the Storyteller manage them. \nWORLD \no E DARKNESS \nHow much information can Kindred gain from crossovers? That \ndepends. The Gothic-Punk world is a dark and mysterious place. Its \ninhabitants do not have books like the Laws of the Night or The \nCamarilla Guide at their elbows to flip through when they first meet an \neight-foot-tall blue-skinned Viking. Most werewolves have never met a \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nvampire, and a Cainite’s first encounter with the Lupine threat is likely to \nend in Final Death. \nRemember to use Abilities and Lores to help keep the night myste- \nrious, and remember that different Lore Abilities may be more or less \naccurate. For example, a Cainite with four levels in Occult might suspect \nthat lycanthropes are real and that garlic and silver affect them. One \nwith three levels in Lupine Lore might know what Kindred have learned \nover the last three millennia - \nand about half of it may be more or less \nfalse. Finally, a Cainite with Garou Lore has an inkling of the “right \nstuff,” knows the name of a tribe or two, the real story behind silver and \nperhaps even a little about the Triat (“What’s a Wyrm?”) and spirits. \nLore shouldn’t be free, though: A Kindred with Garou Lore probably has \nthe scars to prove it, is not spreading around how she acquired it, and is \nlikely to have an Ahroun hunting her or a Glass Walker Ragabash \npreparing to blackmail her three ways from Sunday unless she helps him \nsteal the Influences he wants. \nThe different denizens of the World of Darkness have different agendas \nand different cultures; it’s not out of line to compare the biases between \ngroups to the sort of inculcated prejudice found in South Africa’s apartheid \ndays. After all, it may serve Kindred elders to claim that the Wild Ones are \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nfrightening - \nadding a few gory tales that happened to the childe of his \nsire’s uncle may keep the childer sufficiently frightened and thus unmoti- \nvated to go hunting the truth. The reverse holds true - \na Lupine who has \nbeen told a thousand thousand times (each time more unpleasant than the \nlast) how untrustworthy and horrific Leeches are, then actually meets one \nin an alley, is going to remember those stories first, not whatever the Leech \nis babbling as she tries to get away. \nLovers and spouses do not always reveal their deepest secrets to each \nother, which forms the premise of many a modern thriller. The same is true \nof companions and even the blood-bound in the Gothic Punk world, \nespecially if the friend or thrall fears that the information might make her \nKindred domitor unhappy. So the ghoul or thrall sneaks out to find her \nchangeling sibling, and her domitor starts wondering where she’s going. Does \nhe follow her? Does he question her? Or does he let it slide under the weight \nof other worries? Kindred may interact with other creatures, but the informa- \ntion rarely comes with full disclosure or classroom credit. \nThe truly mighty powers of the World of Darkness, ranging from Garou \nIncarna spirits and sleeping Methuselahs to the Technocracy, labor to keep \ntheir secrets hidden from the prying eyes of mortal society. Consider the \nmodern marvel of the Internet: While some supernatural creatures use \ncomputer networks, ranging from the Nosferatu SchreckNet or the Digital \nWeb to Pentex’s strange computer-spirit hybrid network, very few have \nsucceeded in making the Web truly work for them. A young Lick’s attempt \nto openly use the Internet to trade away secrets of Kindredsociety to other \nsupernaturals might result in missing e-mail, strange server and router \ncrashes and an ominous knock on the door in the middle of daysleep. Think \nof this balance of misinformation as being adelicate stasis, like that between \nseveral hostile nations, each “hidden master” wanting to be the one to pull \nthe trigger at the time that best meets its own agenda, but before the other \nnations get the first shot. \np R O B  LE M s A N  D PRI \nN CI p LE s \nWhen managing crossovers, Storytellers need to be aware of potential \nproblem areas, including how much information is traded, relative power \nlevels and intentional player-generated catastrophes. Each by itself can bring \nan evening’s game to its knees. \nPlayers should not readily trade away secrets of their clans to other \nsupernatural allies unless they have very good reasons for doing so. As a \nStoryteller, encourage your players to be reasonable. If they are not, point \nout that their “students” may not understand everything because they do \nnot have the background and context to do so. You may also require those \nlearning about vampires to purchase Kindred Lore or Vampire Lore, or \nrequire that they also learn one or more “incorrect” facts for each \n“tutoring session.” (“What do you mean, vampires can endure moonlight? \nMy friend told me that they couldn’t!”) \nRemember to be consistent when choosing to use the newer health \nlevels. All characters should get access to the expanded health levels \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\npresented in Laws of the Night unless you choose to use the compressed \nhealth levels from earlier Mind’s Eye Theatre games. You must also \nmoderate power levels: Few solitary Kindred can stand up to a raging \nGarou war-pack or a Renegade wraith with Stonehand Punch, while \nsolitary Garou or Wraith players should feel understandably nervous \nabout entering a Kindred Elysium. Work with your players in establishing \nguidelines for power levels as discussed below. \nFinally, Storytellers must moderate the actions of “Apocalypse Now!” \nplayers, such as the disgruntled Caitiff who published maps of the next \nElysium and mailed them to every Lupine in a four-state area. Beyond \ndealing with the carnage wrought by this wild-eyed fruitcake, you need a \nway to keep the story rolling without pulling out an unrealistic deux ex \nmachinae. Perhaps locations change at the last minute, strategic car \ntrouble strands the war party on the highway, or someone at Elysium gets \na tip-off (perhaps one of those strange flashes that occur with Auspex or \nDementution) that something is approaching. As a Storyteller, you have a \nresponsibility to create a sense of verisimilitude, of authenticity. Allowing \na single player to blow up the city (and the game) singlehandedly does not \nhelp in creating this atmosphere. \ns T 0 RYT E L L E R CH A R A CT E R CR 0 S S 0 VE R S \nYou have the most control over crossover Storyteller characters, \nincluding their statistics, personalities, roles and what they actually do for \nthe players in your game. They should be doing more than simply handing \nout plot - \nconsider that these are more of the World of Darkness (remem- \nber that first word), and people aren’t there solely to dish out tasty clues and \ngracefully exit stage left. \nWhen creating Storyteller characters, avoid the temptation to create \n“uber-NPCs,” the mighty monsters that can squish any annoying player \ncharacter like a grape. Many times you won’t need them, especially not for \nsimple interaction. One rule of thumb is to ensure that these characters \ndon’t have too many more Traits than the most powerful player character \nthat they may oppose. You may even want weaker, more numerous \nopponents: Even a powerful elder with Fleetness and Puissance may run out \nof Traits when faced with a mob of angry vampire-hunters with just a \nsmattering of True Faith. \nBalance what the Storyteller characters can do against what the players \ncan do. If Lupine Storyteller characters can find the characters’ Elysium \neasily, consider letting the characters occasionally disturb a late-night moot \nat a smaller caern. Do not let your players cultivate the belief that your \ncrossover Storyteller characters are more important than the player charac- \nters themselves; that leads to players feeling powerless. On that same note, \nletting the characters run roughshod without too much interference will \nmake them cocksure that they can take down anything. Sure, that Kinfolk \ngirl who wouldn’t answer the coterie’s questions went down pretty easily, \nbut it’s a certain bet that her angry Garou mate and his pack aren’t going be \nquite such a pushover. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nStatistics do not make up a Storyteller character’s personality, espe- \ncially for crossover characters. For many Storyteller characters you may \nnot even have well-developed sheets, but may instead rely upon a line or \ntwo jotted down in a notebook or on index cards: “The Quick Corner clerk \nis a punkish, tattooed older teen with a shock of red hair. She seems \nconfident and self-assured, with a steely gleam in her jaded but young eyes. \nShe is actually a changeling, an Unseelie redcap wilder, with Basic-level \nArts.” You can often make simple characters seem more real when you \nfocus on mannerisms, styles of dress and speech habits. Maybe our above \nexample redcap clerk has a habit leaving her hightops untied, or drops an \nautomatic (not necessarily sincere) apology when she curses. If the \ncharacter is interesting to interact with, no one’s going to much care how \nbutch her sheet is. \nWhen you do decide to give statistics to your crossover Storyteller \ncharacters, go sparingly on Lores and special Abilities. Most Garou do not \nrealize that the Kindred’s fabled weakness to wooden stakes is real, and \nnoble sidhe changelings who knew the Prodigal races of the Dark Ages \nwill be at a loss to understand the Giovanni or modern anarchs. To avoid \nspoiling the mood of mystery and danger, you should generally try to avoid \nmixed-genre “killer combinations,” such as the angry Black Fury war- \nmachine who has both the Luna’s Armor Gift and the changeling \nOakenshield and Quicksilver cantrips cast on her, or the Risen who has \nmore sorcerous enchantments and wards than a bad Aleister Crowley \nimitation. These latter start looking like the Uber-NPCs we warned you \nabout earlier. \nIt’s easy to focus on the full-blooded supernaturals as being a worthy \nchallenge, but the mortal relatives of these creatures can prove even more \ninteresting for crossover use. Werewolf Kinfolk and changeling kinain are \noften more common than their full-powered relatives, and Consorts of \nwraiths are certainly more accessible than their ghostly associates. Often \nthese people make useful ‘[nice old man down the street” crossovers, which \nare more roleplaying-oriented than the usual clash-of-titans encounters, \nbecause they have limited but useful knowledge and because player \ncharacters are more likely to see them as a resource or ally instead of as \ncompetition. Should the players mistreat these “weak” ones, though, the \nsupernatural kin of the oppressed are certain to come looking for the \nplayer characters. \nYou may also want to use Storyteller characters drawn from the psychics, \nsorcerers, shamans and priests described in Laws of the Hunt and Laws of the \nHunt Players’ Guide. Want to up the ante for your Tremere who have been \nless than helpful regarding mortal activities? Let them uncover a coven of \nmortal sorcerers who are now using Kindred as sacrifices to summon infernal \nhelp with the Daimonis Praxis. Want your Gangrel to find an unusual \nuoudoun-like rural cult as the start of a larger plot? Use a shamanistic Uzoma \nbabalawo or sorcerous Uzoma bokor. Want to create a rival for a particularly \nseductive Toreador? Consider a Fenian sorceress with the Fascination Praxis. \nThese sorts of characters have an edge that will be unexpected, particularly \nif your targets have usually looked down on mortals before. \n+- \nI \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nKindred will occasionally have allies and retainers who are supernatu- \nral creatures themselves. Ghouls are described in Liber des Goules. You \nmay use Oblivion for wraiths for the Spirit Mentor Merit or as servitors of \nGiovanni or Harbingers of Skulls. Be careful to limit chronicle-bending \nArcanoi like Obliviate or Cupitatis, and remember that a Cainite can force \na wraith to become Incorporeal and unable to affect the real world by \nsimply waving her arms and running through the wraith. If you have a \nKiasyd in your Sabbat chronicle, it makes sense that Unseelie changelings \n(maybe even the Shadow Court) make an appearance at some point. \nRemember, though, that Kindred have a high Banality and any change- \nling who drinks Cainite vitae gains Banality and is well on the way to \nbecoming a Typhoid Dauntain. While even Gangrel are unlikely to have \nGarou allies or retainers, they might occasionally have Kinfolk in those \nroles, which puts the Kinfolk in an uneasy balancing act between the \nLeech who’s her brother and the Garou who demand her loyalties. Mortal \npsychic and sorcerers will also occasionally serve Kindred, though the \nTremere chantry that attempts to totally control a dozen mortal sorcerers \nin an Ancient Order of the Aeon Rite coven is asking for repeat of the \ndrama whereby Tremere himself became a vampire, with the Tremere as \nthe main course. \nWhen creating a retainer or ally, use the description under the Allies \nBackground: The ally or retainer has as many Abilities as the player \ncharacter has Traits in the Allies Background. For other Storyteller \ncharacters, you might be a little more generous, depending on how mature \nyour chronicle has grown. For a competent Storyteller character foe or \nindependent plot character, start by assigning three to six Attribute Traits \nto the two Attributes that are not primary (e.g., Physical traits for a \nTremere or a mortal psychic), one to four levels for appropriate Abilities \nand about the same level of special powers like Gifts, Arts, Arcanoi or \nNumina; base special abilities on the player characters’ average, compar- \ning spent experience. If the Storyteller character is very competent, \nconsider adding a few more Attribute Traits to her primary Attribute. For \nmaximum traits for mortals, you can use either 10 Traits (The Camarilla \nGuide) or eight Traits (Laws of the Hunt, Laws of the Hunt Players’ \nGuide), based on what sort of competency you want the players to \nencounter. For other supernatural creatures, adjust accordingly, based on \nhow much experience the player characters have: Unless it’s going to \nserve the needs of the story, a character that is too weak may not last long. \nIf time is short, you can always simply modify an existing template, such \nas those in the Portrait Gallery from The Camarilla Guide or the Rogues’ \nGallery in The Sabbat Guide. \nPLAYER \nCHARACTER \nCROSSOVERS \nWhen you allow players to mix Kindred and other types of creatures in \na game, you will find that you have a whole new set of concerns to address, \nincluding balancing power levels, maintaining novelty and creating new \nexternal threats. For example, allowing combat-oriented Garou Ahrouns \ninto a salon-style game set in an Elysium may quickly reduce both your in- \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ngame Kindred population and your out-of-game number of players. On the \nother hand, bringing in three weak Rank One Garou into an elder game may \nprove futile for your werewolf players. Search to find both a balance point \nand a reason why the two disparate cultures are working together, and work \nto keep your game from becoming a hunting expedition for other player \ncharacters. You will also find that you need to work harder to keep a sense \nof mystery; Kindred shouldn’t be able to name every changeling kith, Garou \ntribe or network of psychics and sorcerers on a whim. Enlist the aid of your \nmore experienced players in this; they may help you in spreading strategic \ndisinformation (“Of course Bone Gnawers and Glass Walkers are the same \ntribe; so are the Silver Fangs and Shadow Lords”). \nFinally, do not forget to include the genre-specific threats that each \ncrossover character may face. If your Garou characters start talking about \nhow to wipe out the Camarilla court without breaking a sweat, consider \nthrowing a major Pentex plot at them so that the Garou need Cainite \nhelp. If your changelings plan to re-write everyone’s perceptions in a \nSabbat game, you might introduce a Black Magician Dauntain who is \nghouled to the Tzimisce ductus who leads a rival pack. If your wraiths are \nso proud that no one in the local Camarilla court can touch them while \nthey use Stonehand Punch across the Shroud, a cabal of mortal necroman- \ncers or a few Giovanni should knock them off their high horse. \nTH e MANY WORLDS \nThere are many layers to the spirit worlds, as described in Laws of \nthe Wild, Laws of the Hunt andLaws of the Hunt Players’ Guide. One \nrough way of classifying these worlds is to call the lands of the dead the \n“Low Umbra,” the realms of elementals and nature spirits the “Middle \nUmbra” and rarefied heights of abstract concepts the “High Umbra,” as \ndescribed in The Book of Worlds. The closest parts of each of these \nUmbrae are called the “Periphery.” Wraiths normally interact with the \nliving world from the Shadowlands, which are the Periphery of the Low \nUmbra. Lupines, nature spirits and elementals often use the Penumbra, \nwhich is the periphery of the Middle Umbra. Kindred, mortal sorcerers \nand mages occasionally use the periphery of the High Umbra, which \nKindred and sorcerers often call the astral plane and Awakened \nwillworkers call the Vulgate. \nA vampire using Psychic Projection normally enters the astral plane or \nVulgate. If he wanders too far or his silver cord is broken, however, he may \nbecome lost and find himself in the Penumbra or Shadowlands. Conflict in \neither can be disastrous, as a Cainite uses Mental Traits in lieu of Physical \nTraits, but wraiths and Garou use Physical Traits for “physical” combat. A \nstrong Lupine or Spectre may rend the Cainite’s psyche into small pieces, \ntrapping the Cainite in torpor indefinitely. \nWOLVESATTHE \nDOOR \nAncient and embittered enemies, vampires and werewolves have long \nfought for control of their respective territories. Werewolves, known as Garou \nto themselves and Lupines to Kindred, believe that Kindredare the embodi- \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nment of a destructive and malignant evil known as the Wyrm. Despite this \nanimosity, Kindred and Garou occasionally work together in secret for \ncommon goals or against common enemies. \nBecause of their knowledge of the wild and animal ways, Gangrel are \nthe most likely Kindred to interact with the Garou and their Kinfolk \nwithout conflict, though Nosferatu occasionally encounter Bone Gnaw- \ners and their Kinfolk without (much) bloodshed. In the city, a Cainite \nis most likely to encounter the urban poor of the Bone Gnawer tribe and \nits Kinfolk or the techno-savvy Glass Walker tribe. If a Cainite is lucky, \nhe might interact without excessive hostility with a peace-loving Child \nof Gaia, a contemplative Stargazer or a Native American-influenced \nUktena who is more interested in magical knowledge than in slaying the \nhated ancestral foe personified by the Cainite. All bets are off with the \nother tribes. And Gaia help the Gangrel who crashes the sacred Garou \ngathering known as a moot - \nEarth Meld only helps a little when being \nchased by 20 nine-foot-tall killing-machines who want your blasphe- \nmous undead hide! \nPart of this ancient animosity is the taint of death and destruction laid on \nevery Cainite’s soul by the Beast. Kindred and ghouls with three or fewer \nHumanity Traits smell of the Wyrm to Garou attempting to sense Wyrm- \ntaint. Vampires on Paths ofEnlightenment automatically stinkofwyrm-taint, \nregardless of the rating. The exception to this is Path ofthe Feral Heart, which \nis treated like Humanity for purposes of Wyrm detection. \nVampires who drink Lupine vitae are in for an unpleasant surprise. \nEach Blood Trait counts as two, but the Cainite suffers from the Negative \nMental Trait Impatient until the blood is used (and should roleplay the \nrestless, verge-of-frenzy tension that’s rolling through him in the mean- \nwhile) and gets one Trait added to the difficulty of any tests for frenzy. \nBlood cycles through, so the last blood in (the most recently drunk) \nbecomes the last blood out. A number of vampires even hunt Lupines for \ntheir blood as some have claimed that Lupine blood grants speed and \nstrength no different than that granted by Celerity or Potence. In truth - \nand no Kindred should know this - \nthe effect is based on the werewolf s \nPure Breed Background. On the turn after the Kindred spends the Lupine \nblood that came from a werewolf with Pure Breed, she gains extra actions \nand Strength-related Traits, as below: \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThese effects will add to existing Celerity and Potence, but aren’t cumu- \nlative: If a Kindred spends a Blood Trait from a werewolfwith Pure Breed 1 and \nanother from one with Pure Breed 3 in the same turn, the only first blood to \nbe spent adds effects. Any effects from Garou blood last only for the first turn \nfollowing the expenditure. \nGarou who imbibe Cainite blood aren’t in much better shape. A Lupine \ncan be ghouled (and gains one level of Potence like any other ghoul). He \ncan also be blood bound, although getting a Garou to sit still long enough \nto drink vampire blood and keep it in his system is a feat indeed. Most Garou \nwould rather force themselves to vomit the noxious fluid up than swallow \nit: The blood of the undead is a mockery of all things natural. A Garou who \ndrinks Cainite vitae or has it forced into her body becomes Wyrm-tainted. \nFortunately, a Rite of Cleansing is usually sufficient to remove the blood and \nthe Wyrm-taint. \nIn the spirit world known as the Umbra or Middle Umbra, the Garou \nclassify spirits who are influenced by the Wyrm as “Banes.” When Kindred \nindulge in the Beast through violence, bloodshed or corruption, their \nactivities often attract Banes. Banes normally do not affect Kindred - \nattempts by Banes to possess Kindred usually result in trapped Banes - \nbut will instead hang out to wait for the spiritual fallout of Kindred lusts \nand desires. \nBecause of their supernatural heritage, Kindred may find that their \nDisciplines interact differently with Lupines and other shapechangers than \nwith mortals or other Kindred. \nDisciplines from Laws of the Night: \nAnimalism: Kindred with Feral Whispers will not understand the Garou \ntongue, although they can communicate as wolves. No power that specifically \naffects animals will affect a Garou or other Changing Breed, not even Lupus \nor animal breed forms. Garou have Beasts (expressed in their Rage Traits) and \nmay be affected by powers that draw on the Beast. \nCelerity: Lupines can use Rage to match the extra actions that a Cainite \ncan gain from Celerity. \nDementation: Voice of Mudness: A Cainite using Voice of Madness can force \na Lupine to test for fox frenzy; the Lupine tests its Willpower against its Rage. \nObfuscate: Obfuscate works like it does against other creatures. En- \nhanced- senses Gifts can attempt to pierce it in the same manner that Auspex \ndoes (use the Garou’s rank in place of the Auspex rating, but the challenge \nremains the same). \nProtean: Kindred in wolf form via Shape of the Beast cannot understand \nthe Garou tongue and will not smell quite right to a Garou’s senses. \nGarou Gifts \nHealing: Garou healing Gifts like Mother’s Touch are meant to work on \nliving creatures, which a Kindred assuredly is not. Gifts that mend inanimate \nthings also cannot heal a vampire. \nHeightened Senses: Garou may use the Heightened Senses Gift to \npierce Kindred powers of Chimerstry or Obfuscate; treat these instances \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\naccording to the “Case Law” or “Relative Power Level” crossover rules \nin Laws of the Night. \nResist Toxin: While it won’t keep a Garou from being ghouled or blood \nbound, it does give the werewolf the opportunity to make a soak attempt \nagainst Quietus, Thanatosis and other Disciplines that work through blood \ncontact, disease or decay. \nScent of Running Water: This Gift can be broken with Auspex if the \nvampire attempts to track the Garou by scent (use the Auxpex versus Obfuscate \nchallenge mechanic - \nthe Garou’s Rank replaces the Discipline rating). \nScent of the True Form: On a win (but not a tie), a Garou can sense a \nKindred who has used Possession or Subsume the Spirit to possess a mortal or \nanimal vessel. \nSense Magic: Sense Magic will detect the presence of blood magics \nlike Thaumaturgy and Dark Thuumuturgy, but not the use of other \nCainite Disciplines. \nABOMINATIONS \n- \nTHE B L I ~ H T E D  \nONES \nMost attempts to Embrace werewolves end in failure - \nthe werewolf \nusually dies, grateful that her mother-goddess preserved her from a fate truly \nworse than death. Unfortunately, sometimes the Embrace takes hold in a \nLupine. The result is rightly referred to as an Abomination. \nVampire werewolves are truly things that should not be. The Embrace \ncuts a werewolfs spirit away from the world’s soul, literally ripping her out of \nthe great cycle of life and denying her the very reason for which she lives. \nDespair usually sets in at some point, and suicide carries off more of these \ncreatures than anything. \nAbominations are created no differently than other Kindred, but the \nvictim can make a last Gnosis Challenge in an attempt to avoid her fate. On \na win, the victim dies quietly in the attempt and her spirit travels on. Should \nshe tie, the Garou’s spirit will still pass on, but it will be bloody and agonizing. \nOn a loss, the Garou becomes an Abomination. No power short of divine \nintervention can affect this challenge. \nLike any other vampire, an Abomination learns three levels of Disci- \nplines and has the weakness of whatever clan Embraced her (or she could be \nCaitiff). Like any other vampire, she can heal herself or boost her Attributes \nwith blood. That’s where the benefits end. \nAn Abomination’s spirit connections begin to wither almost immedi- \nately upon the Embrace. She cannot increase her Gnosis, nor can she heal \nherself like a werewolf - \nshe must spend blood to do so. While she may \nremember the rites and Gifts she used before her change, she won’t get the \nsame results if she attempts to use them now. Her Gifts now only attract the \nattention of Wyrm-spirits due to her own state as an unclean thing. If she \nattempts to learn more Gifts or rites, she must learn them from Wyrm-spirits \nor Banes, and these are foul spirits who have no interest in dealing truthfully \nwith an Abomination. Even the mightiest, most honored Garou elder \nbecomes a pariah when she’s Embraced and may well have some wrathful \nGarou after her to return her to the cycle. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAbominations may not spend blood in the same turn that they spend \nGnosis or Rage or make Rage or Gnosis Challenges. The mystical qualities of \nthe three pools interfere with each other drastically. An Abomination has a \nblood pool commensurate with her generation. \nAbominations have been rightly called the most miserable of creatures \n- \nthey live with a permanent, debilitating depression that cannot be lifted \nby Willpower or other means. They may never expend Willpower for retests. \nTheir Humanity Traits often plummet fairly quickly, consigining them to \ndeath or the Beast. They may never buy further Humanity, Willpower or \nVirtue Traits with experience - \ntheir psyches are considered to be constantly \neroding, and maintaining status quo is about all they can manage. Where an \nAbomination goes after death, no one is certain. Does Gaia accept them back \nafter their time in Hell, or are they cut out of the great cycle forever? The \nanswer may be forever a mystery. \nThese monsters are considered vicious, powerful and, above all, rare foes. \nThe appearance of one should send shockwaves, not bored yawns. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDREAMS \nI N  DARKNESS \nThough the fae spirits of old now walk the streets clad in mortal flesh \nas changelings, they still remember Kindred as one of their “Prodigal” \nraces. Even though changelings can sometimes be detected by Aura \nPerception, fewer Kindred know of the Kithain; the exceptions are nor- \nmally Malkavians and the Kiasyd of the Sabbat. While most of this can be \nattributed to simple, “I don’t believe in faeries,” there are magical causes \nas well. This forgetfulness is partly because a Cainite must be “enchanted” \nin order to even see the Kithain fully, and partly because after an \nenchantment fades the Mists of the Dreaming erase the memories of what \nhappened while enchanted from mortals, Kindred and others, the Kindred \nof Malkavian blood as the sole exception. \nChangelings can enchant Kindred in several different ways. Kiasyd \nwith Fae Sight are always enchanted. A Cainite can be enchanted if a \nchangeling convinces her to freely accept a token of enchantment. \nFeeding from a changeling can also enchant a Cainite (if the changeling \nmade the offer and the Kindred accepted), and at Storyteller discretion \nmay induce any number of weird effects, from hallucinations to derange- \nments. Malkavians who feed on changelings are freed from the effects of \none derangement but must win or tie a Simple Test with a Narrator to \navoid developing an addiction to the heady vitae - \nand a Cainite with \na craving for Kithain blood is rarely welcome in changeling freeholds. A \nCainite normally stays enchanted for one day per Glamour Trait in- \nvested in a token of enchantment or one day per blood trait ingested; \nStaying in a changeling glade or freehold can prolong this. As long as the \nvampire has one Trait of changeling blood in her system, she can see \nchimerical reality. \nWhen a Cainite passes from enchantment to mundane reality; or \nwhen he is slain by chimerical monsters, weapons or magic; he normally \nfalls into a torpor with the duration based upon his Banality. For most \nKindred this can last up to two months. A Cainite may avoid falling into \nthis torpor when enchantment slips away by spending a Willpower Trait \n(Malkavians need not spend this trait - \nthey automatically avoid this \ntorpor). If slain chimerically, though, a Cainite is “out for the count,” as \ndescribed in The Shining Host. \nKindred are undead creatures with an unnatural, rigid stasis; they do \nnot grow and live. Because of this, many Kindred harbor high levels of \nthe Banality that can be so lethal to changelings. As described in The \nShining Host, Malkavian and Ravnos Kindred normally have six Traits \nof Banality, mortals have six or seven Banality Traits, and other Kin- \ndred, including Kiasyd, have eight or nine Traits of Banality. You may \nchoose to adjust the amount of Banality for factors such as high Human- \nity, Path ratings or youth. \nBanality can prove dangerous to changelings and deadly to chimeri. \ncal companions. By her sheer unmoving presence, a stodgy and \nunbelieving Ventrue elder may dissipate a changeling’s chimerical arms \nand armor and slay the changeling’s chimerical companions. If a change- \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nling is foolish or unlucky enough to drink Cainite vitae, she can become \na ghoul (or even blood bound) and also gains one Trait of temporary \nBanality for every Cainite blood trait ingested. If you want to further \nemphasize the cold and unnatural presence of Kindred, you might grant \none Trait of temporary Banality every hour that a changeling spends in \nthe company of 10 or more Kindred. \nThough the powers of the blood of Caine and the cantrips of the faerie \nDreaming are different, several Disciplines may interact with the chimerical \nreality of changelings: \nAs described under Mytherceria, Fae Sight allows Kiasyd to see and \ninteract with changelings. \nThe illusions created by Chimerstry remain as incidental chimera \neven after they fade to mundane perception. Sluagh may use their \nSharpened Senses (and a Mental Challenge) to attempt to pierce \nChimerstry illusions. \nA Cainite attempting to use Aura Perception on a changeling may \nperceive what he’s seeing by the changeling’s particular aura - \nit shows itself \nas bright, flickering colors. High Auspex can also counter Chicanery in the \nsame way that Auspex and Obfuscate can counter each other. \nMost changelings are affected by Obfuscate no differently than any \nother creature. Sluagh may attempt to pierce these with their Sharpened \nSenses and a Mental Challenge. \nKindred claws and teeth inflict aggravated damage on changelings. \nHowever, changelings can inflict aggravated damage with any cantrip that \ninflicts direct damage on their targets, such as Holly Strike. This damage works \nno differently than any other aggravated damage. \nT H E  D E A D A N D T H E  \nDAMNED \nDeath is not always final in the Gothic-Punk world. Those dead who are \nbound by their passions and remorse can become wraiths, condemned to \nspend eternity fighting against entropy and the forces of Oblivion. Others \nbecome Spectres, the servants of Oblivion. As walking undead who may exist \nfor centuries, Kindred frequently become allies and pawns in the games that \nthe Restless Dead play. \nOblivion-serving Spectres cannot easily see the Skinlands, the lands \nof the living. Wraiths belonging to the Hierarchy are theoretically \nprohibited from contacting mortals (although Charon’s prohibition is \nhonored more in the breach than practice). The wraiths of the illicit \nGuilds, the rebellious Renegades and fanatical Heretics may be the ones \nKindred encounter most. With the advent of the storm winds of the Sixth \nGreat Maelstrom, many of these wraiths cannot easily approach Kindred \nunless the Kindred venture into a place in the lands of the living that \ncorrespond to a safe haven from the storms in the Shadowlands, such as \na cemetery that corresponds to a Hierarchy Necropolis or an abandoned \nhouse that serves as the Haunt belonging to a Circle of Renegades. \nWraiths are separated from mortals by a barrier of emotion and mortal \ndisbelief in ghosts called the Shroud. It is this barrier that wraiths and \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nvampires must pierce if they wish to interact with each other. The Shroud \nthins in places where mortal belief encourages the idea of ghosts: grave- \nyards, foggy roads, old attics, certain nights of the year - \nand thickens \nwhere it does not: parking lots, shopping malls. Many Kindred havens and \nhangouts often have moderate Shroud ratings. \nOf the forbidden Guilds, the four Guilds teaching the Arcanoi of \nEmbody, Outrage, Pandemonium and Puppetry are the most likely to \ninteract with Kindred, though many wraiths using these Arcanoi on \nKindred belong to no Guild. With Embody, wraiths may manifest to \nKindred; given the long undead “life” of most Kindred, they are a perfect \nconsort for attunement for Embody. Spooks and Haunters using Outrage \nand Pandemonium often haunt Kindred because of the Pathos they gain \nfrom tormenting vampires. Kindred are particularly vulnerable to fren- \nzies induced by illusions of blood created with Foul Humor or windows \nopened in a haven by Death’s Touch. Finally, practitioners of the \nPuppetry Arcanos find that attuning a Cainite results in a wonderfully \nlong-lasting Consort for possession. \nWraiths may use their powers of Deathsight, Lifesight and Sharpened \nSenses to examine Kindred; Spectres normally cannot, unless they have the \nArcanoi known as Shroud Rending. When looking for a Cainite who has \nhidden herself in a crowd of mortals, a wraith can easily spot her by her signs \nof arrested death using the wraith‘s own Deathsight. A wraith may also use \nLifesight to perform a form of Aura Perception; the paler aura of most Kindred \nusually reveals them for what they are. Finally, a wraith may use Sharpened \nSenses to pierce Cainite Chimerstry or Obfuscate as if the wraith had the basic \nlevels of Auspex. \nWraiths usually associate with vampires as haunts or spirit mentors. \nHaunts may occasionally be extremely hostile and dedicated to a Cainite’s \ndestruction, but this is rare. Many haunts either have a Kindred as a \nFetter or are using the Kindred as a source of Pathos. Vampires have a \nway of creating wraiths, and it only takes one careless feeding for a \nKindred to have a companion that will never leave. As much as a wraith \nmight hate the vampire who created her, she is unlikely to destroy that \nFetter. Her Shadow, on the other hand, is not quite so particular. A \nwraith that uses Kindred as a source of Pathos, on the other hand, may \nnot be as sentimental about keeping the Cainite around. If, however, she \nhas put in the rime and effort into attuning the Cainite for Embody or \nPandemonium, she is unlikely to destroy the Cainite out-of-hand; instead \nshe will focus on making the Cainite’s life as miserable as her creativity \nallows (and with the right Arcanoi, she can make forever seem like a \nvery long time indeed). In turn, a Cainite can cause problems for a wraith \nby the simple expedient of running through the location where the \nwraith is standing, temporarily disrupting the wraith and costing it a \nCorpus Trait as the wraith becomes incorporeal. \nA wraith who aids a Cainite with the Spirit Mentor Merit is much more \nhelpful. Though rarely possessing Arcanoi beyond the basics, wraithly men- \ntors provide the Cainite with extra eyes and ears. In tum, the wraith probably \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ngains Pathos or other aid from the Cainite, or protects the Cainite as a Fetter. \nSpirit Mentors are almost always wraiths, though it is not unheard that the \noccasional Spectre might use Shroud Rending and manipulate a Cainite to \ntend to its Spectre cult. \nWhen creating a haunt or a spirit mentor, remember that the \nwraith’s personality is more important than his statistics. Oblivion is the \nobvious tool for building a wraith. For game balance, you probably do \nnot want to assign the Storyteller character wraith more than Interme- \ndiate Embody (Life-in-Death) or Intermediate Pandemonium (FoulHurnor), \nand you probably do not want to exceed Basic levels for other Arcanoi \nunless you have a high-powered game. Remember to determine why and \nhow the wraith decided to associate with Kindred. If you’re feeling \nsadistic, you might even assign a wraith’s Psyche to help a Kindred and \nits Shadow to destroy her. \nSome vampires will have more truck with the Shadowlands than others. \nGiovanni, Harbingers of Skulls and the rare Nagaraja all interact with the \nlands of the dead. Solitary Heretic and Renegade Wraiths tend to fear these \nKindred because of the powers granted them by Necromancy. In turn, these \nKindred are usually smart enough to avoid angering the Hierarchy leadership \nor powerful Circles of Renegades or Heretics. After all, no Cainite wants to \nwake up from daysleep in mid-afternoon as the local wraiths dismantle her \nhaven board by board. \nA few wraiths learn how to reanimate their bodies in the Skinlands, \ndriven by a need or passion so fierce that they could literally not stay buried. \nThese Risen often find it easy to hide among Kindred, as they exhibit many \nof the same outward signs as a vampire. Since Risen can learn the Disciplines \nof Celerity, Potence, Fortitude and Obfuscate, they are often remarkably \nsuccessful at infiltrating Camarilla courts or anarch gangs; a few pass them- \nselves off as Sabbat, taking advantage of the opportunity of random destruction \nto cover their own tracks. Many times, a Risen can hide successfully until \nsomeone tries to put the bite on her - \nthe resultant mouthful of embalming \nfluids (or curdled blood and vinegar) is enough to sicken the unwary, not to \nmention enraging the Risen. \nKindred are not happy creatures. Wraiths who constantly follow Kindred \nthrough the night risk acquiring Angst and the rise of their darker side, the \nShadow. If you want to further emphasize the taint of Oblivion on Kindred, \nyou might grant one trait of temporary Angst for every hour that a wraith \nspends in the company of 10 or more Kindred. \nUnless the vampire has met both Shadow and Psyche, or has appro- \npriate knowledge (Wraith Lore), she is unlikely to know when the Shadow \nhas come to visit as opposed to the wraith. Some Shadows do have obvious \ndifferences about them (a gray dove that accompanies them, cat-slit eyes), \nmany times the changes between dark and light persona are so subtle that \nonly a long-time associate might notice them- a sneer in place of a smile, \nhumor with a hint of cruelty. It’s in the Shadow’s interest to string the \nvampire along and not let her in on the change, the better to make \nmischief. Indeed, some Shadows may live independently when their \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nwraiths fall into Slumber, sneaking out to make all sorts of associations \nthat the wraith has no idea about, \nKindred who suffer Final Death occasionally become wraiths, though \nnormally they do not return as Risen. Rising requires that the body be \nreasonably intact, and vampire bodies often crumble to dust from im- \nmense age. There are two glaring exceptions to this - \nKindred who have \nreached Golconda or been diablerized never become wraiths. Of course, \na Giovanni who wakes up as a newly unCauled wraith usually hightails it \nback to his old Cainite family post haste lest the news of his passing bring \nout some old enemies. \nLastly, wraiths cannot be fed from, ghouled or Embraced, even if they are \nEmbodied. Nihilistics, a strange Discipline used only by the rare Nagaraja \nbloodline, allows a vampire to feast on a wraith via Soul Feasting. \nKindred Disciplines \nAsh Path Necromancy: A vampire must have the first level of Ash \nPath Necromancy (Shroudsight) to see past the Shroud. A wraith attempt- \ning to hide in the Shadowlands through an Arcanos from an observer in \nthe living world tests against either the vampire’s Auspex or Ash Path \nrating, whichever is higher. \nAuspex: A wraith who is materialized or Embodied can be read with \nAura Perception. As wraiths are pure emotion, their auras do not halo \naround them - \ninstead, their forms shimmer with color. Risen auras read \nno differently than other vampire’s. Some claim that the Shadow can be \nseen as a muddy blot upon the aura of any wraith or Risen, but the claim \nremains unverified. \nObfuscate: All wraiths may attempt to see through Obfuscate, using \nLifesight and a Mental Challenge. \nArcanoi \nEmbody: Embodied wraiths are affected by all Disciplines that can affect \nordinary mortals (Dominate, Presence). Arcanoi normally hampered by the \nShroud work without interference. \nFatalism: This Arcanos does not always work on those across the \nShroud, especially Kindred (spend another Mental Trait in challenges). \nWhen it does work, though, the results can be very.. . interesting. Fatal Vision \nallows the wraith to witness the vampire’s Embrace, the end of his mortal life. \nKeening: At Storyteller discretion, an Embodied wraith may spend a \nWillpower (in addition to any other expenses) and perform Requiem, which \nmay force a vampire into or out of frenzy. \nMoliate: Vicissitude and Moliate are nothing alike, although they are \nvery similar in ideas. Moliate works only on wraithly plasm while Vicissitude \nworks only flesh (Embody doesn’t count here). While an irritated Tzimisce \nmay perform Vicissitude on the body a wraith happens to Skinride, it has no \neffect on the wraith. \nOutrage: Death’s Touch may start fires that ignite clothing but not \nundead flesh. Obliviate works as usual on vampires and may be soaked \nwith Fortitude. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPandemonium: Any blood created with this Arcanos is completely \nunusable to vampires and will even induce intense bouts of vomiting if \nconsumed. A vampire targeted by Tempus Fugit cannot gain further \nextra actions with Celerity, but Tempus Fugit can negate additional \nCelerity actions. \nPhantasm: This Arcanos affects vampires no differently than mortals - \nthey can be pulled into dreamscapes and acted on. While in dreamscape, \nKindred may not spend blood or use Disciplines. \nPuppetry: If the Kindred is aware of its effects, she can make a \nWillpower Challenge, or spend two Willpower, to attempt to force the \nwraith out. If commands issued by Dominate and Puppetry conflict, the \nvampire issuing the command and the wraith go to a Willpower Chal- \nlenge. The loser cannot attempt to override the winner’s commands \nuntil the following night. \nUsury: This cannot be used to steal blood, or to steal or restore health \nlevels from one Kindred to another. \nB L O O D A N D  \nM A ~ I C  \nTrue willworkers, mages are rarer than their partially Awakened \nhedge wizard counterparts. This may be good for Cainite society; a \nconfederacy of Technocratic willworkers was partly responsible for the \ndestruction of the Ravnos Antediluvian. Several factions of mortal \nmages are aware of Kindred, and a few of these are openly hostile. The \nOrder of Hermes, for example, still holds animosity toward the Kindred \nof Clan Tremere, and both the Verbena and the Euthanatos consider \nKindred to be unnatural abominations. The Technocracy would gladly \ndestroy any Cainite who exposes the truth of vampiric existence to the \nmasses (so long as a few study subjects are saved for the Progenitors). The \ninfernalist Nephandi have studied the undead as well, perhaps even \noccasionally sharing infernal tutors.. . . \nA few mages may still seek out Cainite company for a variety of reasons, \nand that is where tragedy usually begins. Kindred resonate strongly with \nentropic energy. Any mage who travels too often in the company of Kindred \nrisks acquiring entropic Resonance Traits, especially the taint of Jhor. \nWhile these Traits may help in certain castings, they mark the mage and \nlead other mortals to feel uncomfortable around the mage, as described in \nLaws of Ascension. \nKindred often ghoul those who provide them with useful services. \nWhile all ghouls are forced to trade away some of their Humanity and \nfreedom for a shadow of Cainite power, mages risk more. The Avatar of a \nghouled mage becomes addicted to relying on the power of vampire blood. \nLulled into a stupor, it slowly drifts into Oblivion. In a real sense, \nbecoming a ghoul is the opposite of striving toward Ascension. The \nEmbrace is even worse - as the Tremere painfully discovered, the \nEmbrace extinguishes an Awakened Avatar and causes the mage to lose \nher abilities. While she might be more receptive to learning Thaumaturgy, \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nblood magic is a poor substitute for the Spheres. Most mages who find \nthemselves in such a condition commit suicide shortly thereafter. \nSome Storytellers may be tempted to let mages do almost anything \nimagined - \nresist the temptation. Remember that each mage has a paradigm \nthat she must follow. For example, let’s say that you are considering having \na Storyteller character mage who can turn Kindred into lawnchairs. What is \nher paradigm? Is she Verbena? A Verbena might turn someone into a toad, \ntemporarily, but not lawn ornaments. Order of Hermes? She is more likely to \ntransform someone into a mythical beast than something found in a garden \nshop. In short, it’s unlikely. \nCan a Kindred be restored to mortality? Entirely possible, say the \nlegends, but this takes the powers of a Master or Oracle of Sphere magic, \nand they have fled this world, with most barred from re-entering by the \nAvatar storm that shrieks incessantly on the other side of the Gauntlet. \nEven if one of these mighty ones could be found, the Effect is highly \nvulgar and the Paradox riskcatastrophic. Magic can also be used to break \na blood bond, whether amortal’s or vampire’s, although this too is a risky \nproposition, one whose difficulty increases for every decade the bond \nhas been in effect. \nIt is possible for a mage call on her Spheres to combat certain \nKindred Discplines, most often Animalism, Dominate, Presence and \nThaumaturgy, an effort called countermagic. At Storyteller discretion, a \nmage may be able to counter specific Discipline powers that target the \nmind or soul with appropriate Spheres. To counter Animalism, Dominate \nor Presence, a mage must have Basic Mind, spend a Willpower Trait and \nmake an Arete Challenge. To counter Thaumaturgy, the mage spends \nthe Willpower and makes the Arete Challenge. By expending a Mental \nTrait, she may either interrupt a Thaumaturgy ritual or negate its effects \nafter its completion. \nVampiric blood magic is relatively simple, being powered by Kindred \nvitae. While not as versatile as the Spheres, blood magic’s static effects do not \nincur Paradox, and blood magic may be used to counter a mage’s Effects. \nThose using Thaumaturgy, blood magic of Assamites or Setites, or Tzimisce \nkolduns make a Willpower Challenge against the mage in a countermagic \nattempt. A number of Tremere practice a specific path called Thaumaturgical \nCountermagic (The Camarilla Guide), said to be quite effective in dealing \nwith mage Effects. \nIn challenges between Auspex versus illusion or invisibility rotes \n- \nor Obfuscate or Chimerstry versus sensory Effects - \nuse the Auspex \nversus Obfuscate rule in Laws of the Night. The level of Sphere in use \n(or highest Sphere for combined effects) and the level of the Disci- \npline are compared. \nLife magic does not affect vampires. Most Life Effects that work on a \nmortal body can be performed on a vampire using Matter. To heal a vampire, \nthe mage must use Matter and Prime in a conjunctional Effect. The same rules \nof coincedence for healing a mortal with Life are in effect. Healing aggravated \nwounds is always vulgar. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nI \nI \nAny damaging Effect powered by Prime (except Life Effects) inflicts \naggravated damage. An attack with Intermediate Prime or fire- or electric- \nity-based Forces will also cause aggravated damage. Intermediate Forces \nand Basic Prime is necessary to create sunlight for an attack. Creating \nsunlight at night or calling sunlight from somewhere else on the planet are \nboth vulgar. \nVampire blood is worth Tass - \ntwo Traits of vampire blood equals one \nTrait of Tass. If used for this, wise mages collect the blood in a container. \nPSYCHICSAND \nSHAMANS \nA N D  SOIICBREXIS, \nOH MY! \nKindred were once mortals, and most regularly interact with the \nmortal world, even if only to feed. The World of Darkness holds \nmany unusual creatures in addition to Kindred, Garou, changelings \nand wraiths, and mortal humans are often among the most surpris- \ning. Liber des Goules describes the roles of ghouls in mortal \nsociety. Laws of the H u n t  and Laws of the H u n t  Players’ Guide \ndescribe psychics, sorcerers and clergy who also people the World of \nDarkness. If you use these sources, remember that ordinary mortals \naren’t as robust as Kindred and have a maximum of eight Physical, \nSocial or Mental Traits if they have no supernatural abilities or \nheritage, and a maximum of nine Physical, Social or Mental traits \nif they have a supernatural heritage (ghoul, Kinfolk, Kinain) or \nhave Numina. \nPSYCHIC \nE R I E N D S  NETWORK \nAs the Storyteller, you can use Laws of the Hunt to prepare Storyteller \ncharacters or Narrate for players who have psychic powers, called Numina. \nYou may also choose to create hedge wizards and shamans from Laws of the \nHunt as well instead of using the more complex systems in Laws of the Hunt \nPlayers’ Guide. Players who portray psychics can add a mortal flavor to a \nvampire game with their ability to walk in the daylight and use special powers \nsuch as Psychometry or Telepathy. Keep in mind, though, that the Cainite \nEmbrace destroys psychic Numina, and the player of a psychic character may \nbe frustrated at losing the months of experience that she has invested in the \npsychic power. Also remember that mortal psychics cannot heal as fast as \nKindred and are more vulnerable to many environmental concerns, such as \nlack of air or temperature extremes. You may even want to emphasize the fear \nand uncertainty faced by mortal friends and allies of Kindred through the \nexperiences of a relatively defenseless psychic character. \nCertain Cainite Disciplines may interact strangely with \npsychic Numina: \nAt higher levels, Psychometry often yields more potent images \nthan a Cainite using Auspex’s power of the Spirit’s Touch and can \noverwhelm the psychic. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNormally, a psychic can use only use the Psychometry power of \nFlashback on fresh corpses to determine manner of death; with a Cainite, \nthough, a psychic can engage in the normal Static Mental Challenge \nand receive visions of her Embrace, even if it was not recent. \nA mortal with the Telepathy Numina may intercept and be intercepted by \na Cainite with the Auspex power of Telepathy with a Static Mental Challenge. \nThis can occasionally be unsettling for the Cainite who “overhears” a mortal \nusing Telepathy to read an animal or a subject in another room. \nSORCERERS, \nPRIESTSAND \nSHAMANS \nYou may also wish to introduce sorcerers, priests and shaman from \nLaws of the Hunt Players’ Guide. These hedge wizards are usually more \npowerful than their counterparts from Laws of the Hunt. With 23 \ndifferent Praxes from which to choose, these hedge wizards can be \nenchanters, shapechangers or necromancers, and can imitate several of \nthe powers that Kindred usually associate with certain clans, such as a \nBrujah or Toreador’s Presence or a Lasombra’s Obtenebration. Typically, \na mortal hedge wizard’s power is weaker than that of his Cainite \ncounterparts in the Tremere and Tzimisce clans, and humans have fewer \nmaximum Traits than Kindred, but mortals can often do what Kindred \ncannot easily do, such as summon spirits or angels and demons with \nPraxes like Spirit Calling or Daimonis. With their powers, numbers and \nmortal organizations, mortal sorcerers can often prove to be able-bodied \nassistants or harsh foes of the Tremere or Tzimisce kolduns. \nSorcerous Praxes occasionally interact with Cainite Disciplines: \nDemonic forces summoned with the Dark Thaumaturgy ritual of Call \nForth the Host are very vulnerable to control by the mortal Praxis of Daimonis, \nespecially powers such as Dolor and Truce. \nObviously a mortal using Hellfire causes a Cainite witnessing its use to \nmake a Courage test or enter Rotschreck. The difficulty of the test depends on \nhow much fire the mortal creates. \nA Cainite with Auspex may see through the powers of the Praxis of \nIllusion as if he were attempting to pierce the phantasms of Chimerstry. \nA mortal with the Mentalis Praxis may intercept, and be intercepted by, \na Cainite with the Auspex power of Telepathy with a Static Mental Challenge. \nCROSSOVER \nLOCALES \nYou may decide to run a game mixing Kindred with other \nsupernaturals. If you do decide to allow large-scale crossover, be careful \nand consistent when you choose where and when the crossover takes \nplace. Some creatures are inherently antagonistic; Lupines and Kindred \nhave long battled to destroy each other, so setting your scenes in \nsomeone’s haven or Garou caern is asking for trouble. The same applies \nto changelings as well; few motleys or households will allow undead \nProdigals to step into their freehold. \nKindred might rub shoulders with other supernaturals in many \nsettings, such as an Elysium, the “Rack,” a club or a place of mutual \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ninterest, like an art gallery. Many troupes set crossover games in the \nElysium for Camarilla-controlled cities. This may or may not be a \ngood thing, as conflict often breaks out when Kindred and others \nmix. A more neutral or open location, where the Masquerade makes \nconflict a definite no-no might work better. The local Cainite \nfeeding grounds may also be a good choice for crossovers, especially \nif the common feeding grounds, often called “the Rack,” are not \ncontrolled by any one agency; a particular club or restaurant in the \nRack might serve as a common place to find other supernaturals. In \nthe case of wraiths, you’ll need a place where the Shroud is thinner, \nor your players will spend the better part of the game trying to pierce \nthe Shroud instead of interacting. \nWherever the setting happens to land, you’ll need to work with your \nplayers in managing the “common ground.” There’s more to such a spot \nthan merely walking in and ordering a Type 0 cocktail and elderberry \nwine on the rocks? Who’s part of the nightly business of the place? What \nhappens if someone tries to take over the place by using Influences, or \ntrying to buy or bully it outright? Does the owner/operator realize that \nher place is becoming the hot spot for the local supernaturals? If yes, is \nshe doing anything about it? If no, how is she being kept in ignorance? \nMost importantly, why should one group of supernaturals not gang up on \nthe other group in the middle of this common spot? This last could go \nback to your plotline, it could be something settled by the setting, or \neven by how your critters interact. \nCONCLUSION \nCrossover events are one of the tools that you can use in painting \nthe World of Darkness for your players. Use crossovers to increase the \nmystery and tension for your troupe, and work with them to keep \nthings fresh. Be wary of too much knowledge - if you find the \nVentrue and Toreador primogen discussing the Litany or Escheat, \nyou know that you may have let things go too far (and it’s pretty \ndifficult to pull back when that’s happened). Consider carefully how \nmuch crossover your game can take; dogs and cats living together \n(i.e., Kindred and Garou living in sin) is definitely a sign of too \nmuch. Remember that good drama changes the characters whom it \ntouches, unlike melodrama, where characters return to the same \nsetting the next game session as if it were a fanged sitcom - \ntherefore, strive for good drama when bringing in new supernaturals, \nand avoid “‘monster of the week” plots. Use crossovers to emphasize \nthe themes in your troupe’s games. For example, emphasize the \nimportance of Humanity and the inhumanity of Kindred when a \nsidhe of House Fiona falls in love with the Toreador primogen who \nfeels the flickerings of love for the first time in years ... and then \naccidentally frenzies on her lover in the throes of a passionate \nembrace. Perhaps a Risen seeks justice for the murder of his lover, but \nhis justice requires the death of a particular Kindred. \nt- \nI \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCrossovers can mean a great deal of work and aggravation, and you \ndon’t need to take it on if you don’t want to. Ignore player gripes if this goes \noutside the stories you want to tell - \nno one said you had to have a Bastet \nAbomination kept chained to the prince’s throne on a velvet cushion. On \nthe other hand, crossovers can mean opportunities to build stories rich \nwith depth and complexity. This isn’t about steel-cage matches between \nBrujah and Get of Fenris, although sometimes a good slug-fest can be \ntheraputic. Nor should the Nosferatu and sluagh regularly walk in and out \nof each other’s warrens. It should be about how two very different worlds \nview each other, the tensions between them, and how mutual respect can \neventually develop. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nC O U R A ~ E  \n00000 \nB L O O D  \n0000000000 \nC l L l L l m c l c I L l c l L l m  \nWILLPOWER \n0000000000 \nLlClLlLlclclLlLlLlm \n'IVI30S \nNAME: \nCHRONICLE: \nGENERATION: \nNATURE : \nDEMEANOR: \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"
