      "text": "WELCOME \nT O  T H E  MIND’S EYE THEATRE \nJOURNAL. 1 \nHello again, everybody, and welcome to the fourth issue of the MET \nJournal. For those of you who are new to the publication, let me take a second \nto acquaint you with just what you’ve got here. (For those who’ve read this \nbefore, you may skip ahead to “Deadguy Speaks” on the next page.) \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gaps in \nyour White Wolf LARP environment. We offer rules for new character types, \noriginal storylines to work into your chronicles, guides for keeping your games \nunder control and running smoothly and rules updates you won’t find in any \nother Mind’s Eye release. Plus, you’ll find answers to the questions that have \nplagued you, original World of Darkness fiction and columns from people \nwho’ve been LARPing or working here at White Wolf (or both) for years. \nIn this issue, we take a look at the wraiths of the Yellow Springs, the \nimplications of Hunter: The Reckoning for your Mind’s Eye chronicles and \na short treatise on live-action mages from the Mage developer himself. And \nthat’s just a sample ofwhat’s in store for you here. We’ll also take a look at what \nyou’ve missed in previous issues (if you’re joining us late) and what to expect \nin the future of Mind’s Eye Theatre and White Wolf in general. \nIn future issues of the Journal, we’ll present an entirely new LARP \nadventure, a look back through history at some historical expansions to our \nmost popular games, a look ahead at a possible future of the World of Darkness \nand more MET rules conversions. \nAnd you can help make the Journal even better. Send us letters on your \nopinions about the state of live-action roleplaying today. Send us questions \nabout the features and rules you see here, as well as notes about the broken rules \nyou come across in different MET publications. Send us horror stories about \ngames gone wrong and how your player characters fixed them. We’re inter- \nested in all aspects of live-action roleplaying, and we want to know what you \nthink. \nStick around. The Journal is on the cutting edge of the live-action genre; \nwe’ve got something for everybody. And if we don’t have it yet, let us know. \nWe’ll get it for you. \nCurl Bowen \nDeveloper \ncurl@white-wolf. corn \nWhite Wolf \nAttn: Mind’s Eye Theutre Journal Developer \n735 Park North Blvd, Suite 128 \nChrkston, GA 30021 \nUSA \n"

      "text": "DFADCjUY SPFAKS \nHowever, Dame Fortune smiles Onme, and this column \nwill continue to showcase Rich’s unique insight, h \nhis observutions on life in general and his view \ndzvelopment of Mind’s Eye Theatre, though \nlanner be directly in the middle of the action \nA C~REAT ONUS I S  PLACED \nUPONTHEE \nThis one’s going to be a little different, folks. Bear with me. I’m sitting here, not too \nlong after the Columbine High Schoolshootings, pondering what it is that we do that makes \nus such easy targets for scapegoating in the wake of tragedy. More importantly, I have to ask \nwhat we - \nyou and I - \ncan do about it. \n(Author’s note: I have nothing but sorrow for the families, friends and classmates of the \nchildren cut down in Columbine. My mother works in amiddle school, and every time I hear \nabout another outrage in a public school somewhere, my first irrational thought is to call \nand make sure that she’s all right. Nothing I say here is intended to diminish the shock and \nhorror of incidents like that at Columbine, even now, when so much time has passed.) \nHere’s a revelation for you: America does not necessarily like live-action roleplaying. \nIt does not necessarily like people who pretend to be vampires or werewolves cavorting \naround the local coffeehouse or state park and frightening the paying customers with vicious \nrounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. A hundred thousand people will cram themselves into a \nconcrete toilet bowl with tiny seats on a weekend afternoon, painting team logos on their \nwell-developed beer bellies and screaming for someone to rip a quarterback‘s or referee’s \nhead off, but it’s those weirdoes who skulk around in black and quote Shelley that people \nthink you have to watch out for. \nIn other words, depending upon how understanding your local community is, it can \nreally, really suck to be an MET player. \nThat’s just the way it is, at least at the moment. You and I know it, and one of the \nfavorite conversational topics that comes up whenever players of MET get together (besides \ndiscussing characters, making fun of those idiots at White Wolf who clearly don’t know \nwhat they’re doing and comparing prices on fake fangs) is the fact that the world just doesn’t \nlike LARPers. It’s a sad state of affairs, yes, but something about it nags at me. LARPing may \nnot be loved by all walks of life, but at the same time, that does not excuse the self-martyred \n“woe betide us for having an unpopular hobby” attitude that seems to exist in certain \nquarters. Yes, there are places where MET games get it hard. Believe me, all the stories come \nback to us here at the office sooner or later, and we do what we can to help. But there are \nother places where a little effort on the part of players and Storytellers, a little willingness \nto teach and explain rather than an insistence on feeling persecuted, can do a world of good. \nSo let’s talk about responsibility here. \nSpecifically, let’s talk about yours. \n"

      "text": "intrinsically that LARPing is a friendly social activity that is enjoyable for a great many \npeople, and not some sort of weird pseudo-mystical immersion in the nether realms of the \nhuman psyche. If life were fair, you wouldn’t have to explain to your folks or your faculty \nadvisor that it’s just a costume and you don’t really think that you’re Mircea the Ravenous, \nTzimisce Overlord of the Borgo Pass. They would just get it, wish you good luck storming \nthe castle and - \nif you were really lucky -comment \non the nice trim you’d added to your \ncloak since the last game. \nBut life’s not fair. You know that, I know that, and the rest of the world knows that. \nLike it or not, our hobby is simply not something that much of “mainstream” society gets. \nIt requires leaps of faith. It requires suspension of disbelief. It requires spending time as \nsomeone else, and, on occasion, it requires saying funny words and wearing funny clothes. \nNone of these things are necessarily intuitive to perfectly nice folks whose idea of a game \nis building hotels on Baltic Avenue before someone else beats them to Free Parking. Sad as \nit may be, you simply cannot rely on the goodwill of the universe to make people understand \nthat Mind’s Eye Theatre, or any type of roleplaying, is nothing more or less than a game. \n(Time for a sidebar rant here: One of the most frequent complaints I get when I hear \nfrom people whose parents or teachers or store owners or whatever have shut down their \nLARPs is that whoever is doing the shutting down is “wrong.” Well, duh. Of course they’re \nwrong. It is just a game, nothing more and nothing less, even if they’re convinced it’s going \nto turn you into Sabrina the Teenaged Witch. However - \nand this is the part that matters \n-it \ndoes not matter one teeny little bit that they are wrong, as long as they’re the ones holding \nthe big stick. Being right and a buck will get you a small cup of lousy cappuccino these days. \nAs long as the folks with the power think they’re right, it doesn’t matter what the facts of the \ncase actually are. That’s the way it is, pure and simple. \nYeah, they’re wrong, but you know what: They could think that LARPing promotes \nwatching the Teletubbies and joining the alien conspiracy at Roswell, and your game would \nstill get shut down because They Have the Big Stick. Again, I state that it is categorically, \nunmitigatedly, unabashedly unfair. But that’s just too bad. It was unfair that Belgian \nneutrality got violated in 1914 too, but the universe doesn’t much care about fair. All you \ncan do is try to make the unfairness of it all work in your favor - \nor at least work against \nyou less emphatically. The more time you spend kvetching about life being unfair, the less \nyou’re going to get done. It’s that simple.) \nAll of this brings us back to the most important person in the whole equation: You. \nYou have to make a difference, one person at a time. You have to take a moment and \nsit down with your parents to explain what you’re doing and why it’s just a game. They’re \nyour parents. Odds are they’re not irretrievably evil. Odds are that if they’ve expressed \ndisapproval over that game you’re playing, it’s because they’re worried about you. They may \nnot be doing the world’s greatest job of expressing that concern in a palatable or even open- \nminded way, but it’s there, nonetheless. Remember, also, where their information is coming \nfrom. The treatment of roleplaying in the traditional media has been, to be blunt, anywhere \nfrom mildly to wildly inaccurate on many occasions. However, your folks don’t know that. \nThey just know that it says right there, in black and white, in the Upper Herkimer Herald- \nDemocrat-Observer-Picayune that an occult expert from Sheboygan, Michigan, has decided \nthat your game is naughty and evil, and it must be that you’re “immersed in the occult” - \nwhatever that means. Personally, I’ve always resisted being immersed in the occult because \nA) the stains are hard to get out of mv boxers, and B) I’m actuallv a former vouth group \n"

      "text": "On a more serious note, I know that you don’t have to immerse yourself in the occult \nto play Masquerade. You know that you don’t need to immerse yourself in the occult to play \nMasquerade. God help anyone who tries to claim that there’s something Satanic about \ninvoking the images of rock, paper and scissors, because, if you ask me, that’s the final twist \nof the loosest of all possible screws. But that occult expert out there (and how does one make \na career out of being an occult expert, anyway? It doesn’t strike me as the sort of thing one \nputs on a rtsumt) is sure that the game does mandate such goofiness, and the harried reporter \nlooking for a quote from an expert may not know any better. The quote gets printed, sitting \nthere in black and white for all the world to see. And because that information is there in \nthe paper - \nand they wouldn’t print it in the paper if it weren’t true - \nthat’s where your \nfolks’ idea of your hobby may well be coming from. \n(An aside: The newspaper ain’t always right. That little “corrections” item they tuck \naway where it’s hard to find is there for a reason - \nand that’s just the stuff someone caught \nand yelled about. You might want to bear that in mind. Just because it’s in agate type on a \npiece of a dead tree doesn’t mean it’s gospel. After all, this got printed too, didn’t it?) \nWhat all that means, however, is that there’s a window of opportunity here for you to \neducate your folks - \nand by extension, your teachers, professors, faculty advisors and so on. \nShow them the books up close and personal so that they read the big words that say “No \ntouching,” “No running,” “No drinking” and “It’s only a game.” You may even want to think \nabout running a little demo, showing off a staged scene complete with challenges. Let’s face \nit, it’s kind of hard for anyone with any common sense to work themselves into a self- \nrighteous frenzy over even the most heated exchange of R-P-S. If you really want to push \nyour luck, you can even sell it as a vocabulary-building exercise. After all, who uses the words \n“brawny” or “lithe” in their daily conversation? Come to think of it, how many of your \nfriends knew what “obfuscate” meant before 1991? \nIs this sort of common-sense approach going to work every time? Of course not. Some \nfolks don’t want to be convinced. Some folks would rather rant and rave than face honest, \nsimple facts. There’s nothing you can do about them. However, the vast majority of \nconcerned parents, teachers and so on ate concerned because they’ve been told they should \nbe concerned. Show them and tell them differently, and you may see some remarkable \nresults. \nNow think about your community, be it a college campus, a town or a city. A basic fact \nof Mind’s Eye Theatre play is that you need space and lots of it. You need comers to plot \nin, shadows to hide in, coat rooms to cut deals in - \nwhatever. You need room, and by \nspreading out your contingent of players over a lot of room, you increase your chances of \nhaving your players bump into someone who isn’t playing. When that happens, those who \naren’t playing may well be curious as to why that guy over in the comer (you know, the one \nplaying the Nosferatu) has Rice Krispies and Karo syrup all over his face. \nSo is this a crisis or an opportunity? Well, if Gordo the Nosferatu decides to drip \nbreakfast cereal all over the innocent bystanders, yeah, you just might get some negative \nfeedback here. But if you take a minute and explain what you’re doing - \nand it’s always a \ngood idea to talk with all of your players before starting the game about what to say if asked \nabout what’s going on - \nyou can go a long way toward building some goodwill and maybe \neven recruiting a new player or two. It’s just common sense, after all. No matter how \nalienated or antisocial your character might be, bringing that attitude into discussions with \nfolks who don’t know diddly about what you’re doing is a great way to make them antisocial \ntoward you. And believe it or not, there are a lot more of them out there than there are of \nyou. Social Traits don’t matter too much when you get tossed off site for trespassing or told \nby Public Safety to bust it up because you’re freaking the mundanes. \n"

      "text": "In a broader sense, it behooves you to let the community around where you’re playing \nknow what you’re doing ahead of time. Call the local police station and explain that there’s \na game happening there. Take the time to reassure them that there’s no touching or actual \ncombat. That way, when the Hitchcock refugee of a paranoid neighbor calls down to the \nprecinct in a panic over the black-clad hooligans running wild in the streets, the gendarmes \nalready know its you (and that you’re harmless). If you’re going to be meeting at a coffee \nhouse, let the proprietor know that there are 30 vampires coming, and encourage your \nplayers to patronize the shop while they’re there. Thirty vampire players wandering in and \ndrinking lots of coffee once a week is a stable customer base; 30 vampire players wandering \nin and taking up tables without buying anything is great way to shut that coffeehouse down. \nAnd if you are so classless as to bring your food or drink from elsewhere into an \nestablishment dedicated to serving the same, I’ll personally hold you down long enough for \nthe proprietor to kick your ass. Commoncourtesy is not optional. I know of at least one group \nthat lost its space because some chuckleheads decided that they’d bring McDonalds Happy \nMeals to the site - \nwhich happened to be a cafe that sewed dinner. The phrase “dumber \nthan a sack of sand” does not begin to do justice to this sort of nonsense. If you can’t afford \nthe coffee-house prices, at least have the basic decency to eat your McThing McOutside or \nbefore you get to the McGame. Either that, or get ready to volunteer your basement. \nNo, you don’t have a constitutional right to obstruct commercial floor space, so be \nconsiderate. Recognize that your game does impact the community around you, even in \nsmall ways, and try to make that impact positive. That way, if some yobbo writes a nasty \neditorial about those darn vampires, your local coffeehouse owner sees the call to shut down \nthe game as the potential loss of 30 of his best (and hopefully best-behaved) customers. \nThree guesses which way he’ll hop in response. Profit motive outweighs fear of a black cloak \nevery time. \nBy the same token, think about what your game can give to the local community to \ndemonstrate tangibly that you’re not a bunch of bloodsucking freaks: blood drives, cleaning \nup parks and stretches of local highways, food drives, adopting local families at holiday \ntime.. . . You get the idea. None of these things is terribly difficult to arrange; there are dozens \nof charities out there in place who will be glad for a few more hands (even pale, tremulous \nhands with black-painted fingernails. Honest). Furthermore, the sight of a bunch of \n“vampires” doing a blood drive is often the sort of thing that’s irresistible to local news \nmedia. It makes for a great visual, allows the writers to haul out the one-liners they generally \nget to use only at Halloween, and most importantly, it shows your troupe off to the \ncommunity in a positive tight. Just make sure that it’s not the guy with Rice Krispies glued \nto his face who gets interviewed by the cub reporter - \nand definitely not the guy who thinks \nit will be fun to play a Malkavian and calls himself “Count Fruitbatula.” He might think it’s \nfunny to do his little tribute to Gene Simmons on camera, but remember, that’s the image \nthat everyone in your local viewing area is going to have of you and your troupe. It often \nmakes life easier if the entire world doesn’t think you’re a tongue-flapping drool spigot who \ngets his ya-yas licking a camera lens. Instead, you’ve got a perfect opportunity to be well- \nspoken and interesting for the public, even if it’s a virtual certainty that whatever you say \nwill be reduced to anine-second sound bite. Do be careful with what you say; don’t bog down \nin detail or get esoteric because there’s always the chance that something you say could be \ntaken out of context. It’s sad but true. On the other hand, you can look at it this way: Those \nnine seconds will help you reach a lot more potential new players all at once than any flyer \nin a game store ever could. A lot of groups even have a designated individual who gets \npropped up out front every time the media comes calling. This tactic might not be a bad idea \nif you’ve got someone particularly eloquent on hand. \n"

In this feature, I’ve combined the letters to the develoger and \n“Frequently Asked Questions’’ into one vozhd-like mass dedicated to what’s on \nthe minds of today’s MET players. The ideas and opinions herein expressed are \nin no way those of the management or intended to represent an overview of the \nopinions of those who play Mind’s Eye Theatre games, unkss you find them \nparticularly witty and worth taking to heart. Otherwise, the writers (some of \nwhom appeared on the Forum section of White Wolfs website) are compktely \non their own. \n~ \n~ \n~ \n~~~~ \nA discussion started on the White Wolf website some months ago about the \nviability of mixed LARPs (i.e., games in which character types from various \nindependent game lines participate in the same story). Considering that different \nthemes, moods and ideologies apply to each individual White Wolf game, how easily \ncould characters representing those themes (etc.) be meshed into one game? The \noriginal poster received a plethora of advice (some good, some decidedly not), and \nsince this topic is one that recurs in Mind’s Eye Theatre play (and will continue to \ndo so throughout this game line’s long future), I decided to reprint some of the best \n(and worst) responses. This first letter, though sloppy in presentation, is well- \nintentioned in meaning. \nWe have had a problem running an independent LARP with many people \nwanting to play many different things. First things first. \nNumina: Certain numina are so rare that you have to use common sense. How \nmany people in your LARP will have Telepyrokinesis, or Telepathy? \nGarou: Make sure the players of the Garourealize their characters either work with \nor against the vampires. In our game, our area is heavily BSD-dominated. The Garou \nknow their life span is that of a zit. They have to work with vamps or against them. We \nallow players to play other werecreatures according to rarity. It is perfectly fine for one \nGurhal to appear in West Virginia. However, 10 Bastet in one town in West Virginia \nis not good. \nMages: Don’t touch them, they just cause problems. Just say no. Mummies: There \nare 47 in the world. How many of them are likely to come to your town? \nRisen: Don’t touch this one with a 20-foot pole unless you want a walking battle \ntank. \nRemember, the Storyteller’s best friend is the ability to say, “NO.” \n-Nurain \n(nurain@hotmail.com) \n"

      "text": "Unless the Storyteller hooks you up with an interesting and somewhat logical plot \n-moth \nline, I still can’t understand the reasoning behind your role. \nWhile this next guy is no Baz Lerman (remember him?), he does make some \ninteresting points. However, apply salt-grains liberally when reading. \nI’ve been playing Garou for quite a few years and I’ve been there, I can feel your \npain. Come to think of that, I’m in the same boat. My Garou characters are constantly \nsurrounded by vampires. The best advice I can offer is simple: Read Your hws! There \nare many, many, many neat little tricks Garou can pull to save their necks if they get \nin trouble, which are provided in Laws of the Wild. The rest of these tips are ones I’ve \nfound that can really swing the balance in you favor. \n-Avoid your Crinos form; it scares the hell out of vampires. They will attack you \nif you use it openly. Stay in Homid; it’s less threating. \n- \nGangrel can be your best buddies, and they’re not Wyrtn-tainted. Bonus! Get \non speaking terms with them. \n- \nIf you are crafty and discreet, you can masquerade as a vampire (Gangrel are \nbest). A Trait or two of Meditation could conceivably let you lower you heart rate and \nthe temp in you hands, for instance. \n-You \ncan enter the Umbra from any reflective surface, even the reflection in a \nperson’s eyes (it says so in LotW). Don’t forget a Gnosis Trait will get you into the \nUmbra without a test. Which is to say: If you have to, run. \n-Spirits are you friend! Summon them properly, and they’ll help you do various \nthings (dependent on the spirit type). Awaken them and they’re even more useful. Even \nif you kill them, they can serve as an instant Gnosis-battery! \n- \nUse Gifts creatively. Take Create Element for example. You can create a fire \nwith thisGift thenmake it biggerbyaddingair.Orbetteryet,encase thatpesky Brujah‘s \nhead in a block of stone as you make good your next action. Sure, he’ll pummel himself \nfree eventually, but it’ll buy you some well-deserved time. Other good Gifts of note: Jam \nTechnology, Clap of Thunder, Control Simple Machine, Sense Wyrm, Truth of Gaia, \nPersuasion, Luna’s Armor, Cyber-senses, Scent of Sweet Honey, The Fulling Touch, \nParalyzing Stare and Scent of Sight. \n-Thatbringsme \nto thenextbit offun:TheUmbra.UseIt!!!!! ScrewBlurofthe \nMilky Eye and that stuff. You can peek out of the Umbra with a Simple Test against half \nthe Gauntlet. And the best part is that damn near all vampires can’t see you. \n- \nOne claw, two claw, three claw, four, plus your teeth. Each appendage does \naggravated damage. \n-Get \na Totem!!!!!!!

Sick of the hour-long time freezes while a pack of wannabe-goth boys tries \nto affirm its manhood by playing a child’s game? Tired of being the only one with \nsomething to say that isn’t “I’m Brutal enough to blah blah blah...”? Do you often find \nyourself wondering where your game went wrong? Know the answer? \nIt’s the twinks. They suck. You know they suck. Everyone else knows they suck ... \nbut they have the biggest gun-bunny characters around .... What do you do? Well, leave \nit to Zhavric to come up with the answer. \nBuy them a copy of Aberrant. \nWhite Wolfs first venture into the world of the superhero and superpowers was \nnot meant to be the Brujah Elder. It is here and it is now in this new book. Round up \nall your twinks when they show up, force them into a room, lock it and slide a copy of \nthis book under the door. Let them get all that Mega-nonsense out of their system over \na tabletop, and maybe -just maybe -they will get bored of playing characters that \ncan juggle tanks. Maybe they will figure out that there is more to live-action gaming \nthan number-crunching. \nIf they don’t figure it out, leave them there. \n-Zhavric \n(zhavric@hotmail.com) \nOkay, so even all-knowing Zhavric has ably demonstrated his capacity to miss \nthe point behind the Aberrant game, but his point about live-action gaming is solid. \nI’m going to switch to a different font here for a minute and throw my own editorial \ninto the ring. \nThere exists in live-action gaming (in all roleplaying, really) a dichotomy between \nthose who play for the stories, themes and moods inherent in the game, and those who \nplay because being the biggest, baddest [insert fruity character concept here] you can \nbe isahellofalotoffun.AnyWhiteWo1fgame (especially in the live-actionline) lends \nitself to just that sort of dichotomy quite easily. In fact, some would say that that \ndichotomy is just what makes these games so popular in the first place. \nHowever, having both types of players in a game (unless the game is exceedingly \nwell-populated) is going to result in players from one camp getting in the way of (and \nlargely pissing off) the players from the other camp. It just happens; it’s the way of \ngaming life. Thus the proposition of giving both factions what they want is the best way \nto go about solving a lot of the friction that crops up between live-action players. \nDoes your game have a significant contingent of players who just like to build \nindestructible doom-bots and overtake their enemies with effusive protestations of how \nBrutal, Dexterous, Ferocious or Vigurous they are? If so, get them together and work with \nthem to give them the kind of plots they want. Throw slavering packs of Sabbat, Black \nSpiral Dancers, Unseelie redcaps (or whatever) at them, and let them do what they do \nbest. If they have fun because you’ve made the “plot” for the evening engaging, you’re \ndoing your job. \nAre you instead beset by tragically hip gothic youths who want to explore the \nboundaries of their fabricated [characters’] personalities, face moral dilemmas and use \ntheir brains to solve a conflict rather than relying on how many times they thought to \nwritedown theRobwt Trait atcharactercreation?Youfindsomeofthemineverygame, \n"

So, for those \nabout to make their first appearance on the MET scene and the established troupes that \nmust absorb these new players, here’s a brief survival guide to help you through that first \nnight. \nThe most important thing to remember is that, during the game, a lot of real-world \ninteraction goes on that has little to do with the invented reality of the characters. \nInvented personas don’t always relate to each other on their own terms; the player - \nthe \npuppeteer pulling the character’s strings - \nis never too far away.

After all, the characters and their imaginary world \nexist so that real players can have fun. But when new faces appear in the crowd, an \nattitude arises which is equally true in both the game and real life: Strangers are unknown \nquantities. Will this new character prove a threat? Will this new player screw up our \ngame? \nConfronting this attitude might make you feel left out, but fear not.

While tabletop \ngames move along with one major plot and a few subplots, LARPs are collections of \nsubplots with the larger plot proceeding somewhere in the background.

      "text": "the tabletop versions of the White Wolf games certainly emphasize character-develop- \nment, characters are everything in MET. Rather than acting out a plot in which \ncharacters respond to external situations that are the sole purview and domain of the \nStoryteller, LARP characters respond to each other, each with his or her own agenda. \nThis interaction creates story threads that thrust some characters together while \nexcluding others completely. Getting involved with LARP plots takes a proactive \ncommitment on the part of the players, whereas plots are all but spoon-fed to tabletop \ncharacters. \nWith that in mind, design your first character as a social being. While your character \ndoesn’t have to be a complete conformist or even an especially nice person, misanthropes \nwho glare at the room in silent judgement and introverts afraid of everyone present are \nbad choices. That is, of course, unless your idea of a good time is leaning against a wall \nand not talking to anyone. At the same time, if you create a character who’s too aggressive \nor generally obnoxious, you’ll be keeping the wallflowers company on the sidelines as \nwell. \nCreate an individual capable of conversation. Since most MET play involves \ntalking to other characters, invent someone up to the task and remember that a good \ncharacter is a person who wants something. Give him some goals and reasons to interact \nwith others. If you’re in a Masquerade game, for example, you’ll probably start out as a \nneonate newly created or new to town, and your character must seek out potential allies \nif she hopes to survive. \nwhile you can come up with your character’s background and personality without \na rulebook, do get your hands on the rules a few days before the game is scheduled, if it’s \nat all possible, in order to build your character. If you can’t get the rules beforehand, show \nup for the game a little early. Any open LARP worth its salt will have someone available \nto walk you through the character-creation process. That’s the most complicated part of \nthe game by far - \nthe basic rules (apart from character creation) can be explained in five \nminutes. You’ll need your own copy of the rules eventually, but for the first night, \nconcentrate on making the best character (the most real person) you can. \nFinally, exploit the connections you have with other players. If you have friends \nalready involved with the game, make your character’s background somehow involve \ntheir characters so you’ll have some reason to hang close to them when you’re not makmg \nmuch progress with others. If you’re joining a game without knowing any of the other \nplayers, make sure you at least introduce yourself to the Storyteller over e-mail or on the \nphone. Make sure he knows you’re coming and that you’ve never LARPed before. Ask \nhim about the general mood of the game and how best to get involved with existing plot \nlines. Most Storytellers are friendly people who have plenty of experience with introduc- \ning new people to existing troupes. Plus, most Storytellers love it when new people \nexpress interest in their games, and they can be persuaded to answer questions and \ndescribe the themes and mood of the game with little effort. \nWHATTODO \nD U B I N ~ T H E  \nEIBST *ME \nThe game will begin and here’s what it will look like: A bunch of people will be \nstanding around, some in fairly elaborate costume, talking to each other. Don’t panic- \nmost of these folks are approachable. While it might be rude to slither up to a \nconversation and begin eavesdropping, keep in mind that your character is new and \nintroductions are appropriate. Have answers ready for questions about who you are, where \nyou’re from, and what you’re doing here. Who should you talk to first? In most LARPs, \n"

      "text": "there’s an established hierarchy. Ask around, then seek out whomever you’re account- \nable to - \nyour primogen, a local noble, a ranking Legionnaire or whatever. \nThe important thing is to be bold. Where angels fear to tread, you must leap. Most \nLARPs are populated by cliques that tend to stick together, so expect to feel a little \nexcluded at first. Don’t count on anyone to hold your hand or lead you through the \nevening. Get out there and interact. Otherwise, expect a long, dull night. \nAt the same time, don’t find one person who will tolerate your presence and cling \nto him or her for the entire night. For your first game, get out there and try to meet as many \npeople as you can. Don’t monopolize another’s time. If your character isn’t exactly asocial \nbutterfly, ask ”ut-of-character to be introduced to a few people. Of course, there are \nalways two safe bets for conversation: those who are like you (your clan, guild, kith, tribe \netc.) and those who are standing alone, wishing they had your courage to go out and \nmingle. Befriending other new characters often makes good sense, especially in intrigue- \noriented games. While individual new characters have little power, a gang of neonates \nor cubs is sure to frighten the establishment. Even better, it gives you a “home base,” a \ngroup to talk with during lulls in the action. \nAs the game progresses, you’ll probably see people doing strange things with their \nhands. Don’t panic. These gesturesusually mean the character is using some supernatural \npower that the player is incapable of producing. In Blackened Hearth (an Atlanta \nCamarilla chapter LARP, on which I cut my newbie teeth), for instance, crossing your \narms over your chest means that your character is obfuscated (that is, using the vampiric \npower of invisibility). Pointing at your eyes means you’re using Ampex (a supernatural \nheightening of the senses). These gestures vary from LARP to LARP, and not all of them \nsignify the use of powers. Ask someone before the game how to signify that you’re out- \nof-character (like when you’re looking for a bathroom or having asnackbetweenscenes). \nUsually, crossing your fingers does the trick. \nDuring the evening, there will probably come a time when you’ll need a rule \nexplained. If you don’t understand what’s happening, signify that you’re out of character \nand ask someone to tell you what’s going on. Everyone’s needed a rule explained at some \npoint, so most players are willing to slow down the action long enough to fill you in. \nIn the end, there’s a simple way to determine if you’re doing the right thing at your \nmaiden LARP: Ask yourself, “Am I havingfun?” Ifthe answer is yes, you’re doing the right \nthing. If you sit in a chair the whole night, looking at all the costumes without ever \nopening your mouth, and you’re actually having fun, more power to you. But if the answer \nis no, you’re not having fun, you probably need to change your approach. Talk to different \npeople, consider anew character, or get your existing one into trouble. If you sticksilently \nto the wall, your character will probably survive as long as you do. But where’s the fun in \nthat? The exciting aspect of MET, besides getting to be someone (and something) else \nfor a few hours, lies in achieving the goals you set for your character. Taking the plunge \nand talking to people is risky, in the game and in life, but it’s ultimately well worth it. \nSome final advice: Get to know the people you’re LARPing with. For some, \nLARPing is just a fun pastime, and for others it’s life. In the latter group, there are people \nfor whom it’s life because it’s fun, and people for whom it’s life because they’re nuts. Avoid \nthe nuts - \nthere’s no pleasing those people. \nFortunately, most MET-types are sane and indistinguishable from the rest of the \nhumanity, and they probably have stronger opinions about the nuts than you do.

Happily, I was proven \ncompletely wrong. \nT H E  NEXT C~AME, A N D T H E  NEXT \nStick with a LARP, and you’ll be a familiar face before you know it. The best advice \nis just to use common sense. Have fun, and allow others to have fun as well. Don’t be a \nRules Lawyer, don’t cheat, don’t be any of the varieties of Twinkus METus that Charles \nBailey and Rich Dansky have described in previous issues of the Journal. \nMost importantly, don’t be afraid to play what you want to play. Your character can \nbe a total bastard but still welcome in the game, because his presence provides achallenge \nfor others. Also, don’t be daunted by the petty politics that seem to surround some \nLARPs. Make your opinions known but don’t be one of the folks who drive perfectly fun \ngames to ruin by talking behind people’s backs and staging bimonthly secret revolutions. \nAt the same time, don’t let the fear of that sort of out-of-game dynamic keep you from \nplaying and enjoying yourself. Simply put, do what you want to do, but don’t ruin other \npeople’s good time along the way. \nPOSTSCRIPT: \nBE NICETOTHE \nNEWBIES \nGetting involved with a LARP would be easier if the experienced players made their \ngames more accessible to new players. So for you folks already involved in a game, here \nare a few suggestions to make things better for the tyros. \nUnless you want to keep your LARP small, inbred, poor and newbie-free, you need \nto incorporate new players in such a way that they’ll have fun and stick with the game. \nMake a point of talking to the new people at least once during the course of the evening. \nSure, your character’s the most important being in the city, far too important to actually \nacknowledge a new face. Can’t you send a lackey over to find out a little about the \nnewcomer? In a larger game, it simply isn’t practical to talk to all the new people. If \nnothing else, avoid discounting them out of hand. At least give them a nod and an \nacknowledgement before you get on with your life. \nAlso, don’t whip out too many arcane rules on the beginners. They’re still trying to \nfigure out what all the crazy gestures mean. Saying, “I don’t care if your sheet’s done, I \nwant to see you write up a treatment of your character history using the Prelude \nFlowcharts in the Masquerade Players Kit,” doesn’t quite convey the friendly welcome \nyou should give newbies for showing up to your game. And if you absolutely must \ndominate a newbie’s character into standing still so you can destroy her with your \nAdvanced Stormbringing and the Windmill Dance of the Never-Ending Bloodbath, at \nleast explain to her out-of-character what’s going on. After the game, you should shake \nher hand and tell her sincerely that you enjoyed the scene and that you hope to see her \nagain next time in more genteel circumstances. The newbie will, no doubt, come blazing \nback onto the scene with a new character ready to avenge the recently deceased, but at \nleast she’ll come back. \nThose involved in organizing the game or Storytelling should pay particular \nimportance to the new folks. Yeah, you’re busy. At least come up to them after the game \nand ask if they had fun and invite them to the next game. If you’re running an invitation- \nonly game, you’ve probably already figured out that most of this advice doesn’t apply to \nyou. But for most LARPs, new players are precious - \ntry not to scare away too many. \n"

      "text": "INSIDF THF CLOSFT: \nEASHION TIPS FOR THF \nBLOODLORN \nby Auntie Csilla \nGood evening, kiddies, and welcome to another edition of Auntie Csilla’s wit and \nwisdom. How’s it hanging? Mine’s currently in mothballs for the season, but that’s \nanother story. \nwhile there aren’t any Elysium fashion police, there are times when they sure would \nbe helpful. How many times have you been able to spot every Tremere walking in simply \nbecause they’re all wearing black capes and accessorizing with pentacles and canes? How \nmany Toreador insist on showing up in the same black lace ensemble? Consider this \narticle, then, the equivalent of the Elysium Fashion Highway Patrol. \nFirst, let’s start with color. There’s no denying that black is a nice basic to build on. \nIt matches everything, it looks classy and mysterious, just about everyone can wear it \n(very slimming, you know), and it’s timeless, while colors vary from season to season. At \nSay you’ve never been to a Masquerade event - \n01 you don’t attend regularly \nenough - \nand you can’t put your finger on exactly why you feel out of p h e .  The \nreason for that may be the way you’re dressed. Whik it‘s okay to smnd out from the \ncrowd, there are some accepted conventions of vampiric fashion that have become the \nwrm and even passed on into the realm of stereotype. For tips on recognizing those \nstereotypes (and breaking the mold with class and fir), read on. Auntie Csilla‘s got \njust the right advice.. . \n~ \nk \nthe same time, if everyone around you is wearing black, you don’t stand out from the \ncrowd. For all you Toreador, isn’t that a fate worse than being tacky? If you want to go \nfor the “I’m dark and mysterious” bit, consider other deep colors, such as crimson, forest \ngreen, teal, navy, burgundy, purple or charcoal gray. You don’t even have to go all red or \ngreen or whatever. Just a few little bits (like the buttons, a scarf, a boutonniere, a vest, \njewelry) can make somebody’s eyes give you more than a once-over. \nSecondly, fit. In short, if you can’t zip it/ button it/ tie it without seriously sucking \nit in-and you haven’t beenable toforyears-put \nit in theGoodwil1 bin. Whenclothes \ndon’t fit, you look uncomfortable and certainly not your best. It’s one thing to be \nhermetically sealed in satin if you’re built like a toothpick or you have the sort of figure \nthat gets your picture slapped onto the “Dangerous Curves Ahead” signs, but honey, if \nyou’re neither, reconsider. \nThirdly, gimmick or shtick. Call it what you will, the most memorable characters \nalways have something that makes them stand out when they wear it. Indiana Jones had \nhis fedora, Fred Astaire had his tux, the Black Dahlia had the original head-to-foot all \nin black -er, bad kind of unforgettable on that one. At any rate, think about something \nyou can do that will be your particular signature. It doesn’t need to be wearing the same \ndang thing over and over. It could be a Toreador neonate who wears grunge or a Gangrel \nin chain mail. What about a Ventrue whose main business is manufacturing surf boards? \n"

Goodwill bins, St. Vincentde Paulshops, the local Army-Navy \nsurplus store - \nall are very good for restocking your wardrobe when you find yourself in \na pinch. One fine-looking specimen was partial to collecting the occasional bit of jewelry \nfrom his travels and wearing it to court. He had a set of silver Tibetan bracelets that he \nwore on special occasions; I’m holding them for him right now while he’s visiting the \nYukon. \nBefore we go any further, I’d like to register a complaint against whoever it was it \nwho said that Malkavians needed to accessorize with stuffed animals and fuzzy rabbit \nslippers. Come clean now, and I’ll kill you befure I string you up. But first things first - \nleave Mr. Bear at home, unless you redy need him. Your average homicidal maniac, serial \nkiller or otherwise serious nut job usually looks normal to the point of nerdiness. Some \ndo what the voices in their heads tell them to do (including wearing every single piece \nof clothing they own to keep it from getting stolen), some wear special helmets to block \nout the mind-control rays, and some go for the antique look. I’ve seen mystics in filmy \ndrapes, wack-job loners in their old varsity jackets, and an elder who wore commedia \nmasks for special occasions. One of the most seriously twisted cases I ever spotted at court \nwas Douglas Netchurch. I would give my left tit not to be left alone with this man (and \nsowouldyouifyouknewhim), but ifyousawhimonthestreet anddidn’tknowotherwise, \nyou’d think he was just another doctor getting away from the hospital for a bit. \nYes, even the Sewer Rats merit attention. Call this lesson: “Names can be \ndeceiving.” Not every one looks like he’s been sewer-crawling, not to mention that sewers \naren’t always waist-deep in waste water. I’ve seen a lot of Sewer Rats scrounge their gear \nout of dumpsters when they need something to work the Obfuscate over. Some like to \nfudge their clothes in addition to their faces; I know one Nos who liked to show up \nwearing a tux. Point of order, kiddies - \nif you think it’s fun to sneak around in your \naltogether and “dress” yourself with Mask of a Thousand Faces, I’ve got one word for you: \nCameras! Do you really want to chance that your best girl/guy is going to find out a) that \nyou look like road pizza outta the suit, and b) that your puss is less than you’ve been \nmaking it out to be?

Most of the nasties who give you reason \nto carry one of those will make ground round out of you while you’re still trying to figure \nout how to make the button work. And last, but not least, the cape: Skip it. Wanna slash \napart your aura of nocturnal majesty?Try answering the question, “So, are you in a play?” \nwith some degree of dignity. It’s the same argument with regard to the all-blackensemble. \nVentrue- Wow. If they’ve got money, it shows. The best Ventrue wear clothes that \nnot only look good (whatever it is and for whatever occasion), but which compliment \nthem and should put their personal shoppers at the top of all the socialite lists. If they were \nroyalty, they still have their old crowns and robes of state (cedar storage, please, unless \nyou get a buzz on mothballs). Unfortunately, if you spill something on Hizzoner, you’d \nbest sell all your worldly goods and hope that the stain is dry-cleanable. If they don’t have \nthe money, they at least have the taste to pull a pretty good act (“Hey, wasn’t that your \nprimogen I spotted at the Off-Fifth outlet?”). Too bad taste and money don’t always go \ntogether. Nothing can make you wince like a nouveau-rick Ventrue trying to out- \nToreador a Toreador. \nAnd now, last but not least, all you poor little bloodlorn readers: Let your Mommy \ndress you, especially if you’re saddled with a Toreador. Some won’t give a shit how you \nlook, just so long as you’re there and you do your job. Ventrue, Tremere, anyone who’s \ninto business will probably insist you wear a clean shirt and tie, at the least (if you can’t \nafford the dry-cleaning, give these folks a miss). Malks may do anything from putting \ncurlers in your hair to making you wear long sleeves in the dead of summer to hide the \n“accidental” cuts. But the Toreador are a whole other case. Something about how the \nhired help should not outshine the mistress. Pity the poor secretary disfigured by her \nmistress to ensure that Madame would always get picked for the kickball team first. \nThat’s all for now, chicas. Check your flies before you get to the door, and take care \nuntil next time. \n"

This time around, she giwes you the skinny on \nincorporating the ewents of White Wolfs table-top World of Darkness books into \nyour Mind’s Eye games. Basically, this column is the definitiwe guide un what you \nhawe to do with information you don’t hawe to use unless you want to. This advice \nstands for table-top material, but it’s ewen m e  applicable to live-action play. \nWHITE \nWOLE \nCONTINUITYAND \n‘You \nRecently, with the changes to the story lines that drive the White Wolf table- \ntop books, there’s been a great hue and cry from Mind’s Eye Theatre Storytellers \nand players, and a bigger one is anticipated. Every time a table-top book advances \nthe meta-story of one of our games, we hear, “Hey, do we have to do that?!” \nThe short answer is, no, it’s your game. Now go have fun. \nToo short? All right, here’s the more detailed answer: \nThere are grand story-arcs in the various game lines. Some are coming to \nsmashing ends, some are just beginning, and others are getting a jump-start that \nsends them off the deep end in their various “Year of the Reckoning” books. In part, \nthese arcs help focus the books and build momentum to carry things forward. Our \nown real world isn’t static, and neither is the World of Darkness. Things change, \nand not necessarily for the better. Even as table-top games come and go, the stories \nmarch ever, ever on. \nAfter all, remember why a Storyteller sits around beating her head against the \nwall trying to think up new things for the players to do - \nshe’s telling stories. A \nstory-arc is but one more story out of the thousands that populate the World of \nDarkness. These arcs, however, are not scripts. In the end, the choice of whether \nto deal with the fallout or backlash of a particular story thread is the Storyteller’s. \nIf you don’t want to incorporate the various arcs into your plot lines, there’s \nnothing wrong with that. We’re not going to bring the mountain in to beat your \ngame into line. If you want Stygia to be standing in the deadlands (what’s this!) or \nthe Camarilla Malkavians to miss the “fun” of Dementation, that’s up to you. You \nknow what makes your game tick and what would take a sledgehammer to it. Just \nmake sure your players know that you’re running in a “nonstandard direction, and \nthat they’re aware of all that comes with doing so (as in, “No, you can’t have that \nnew Discipline - \nwe’re running a different scenario.”). \nNow if you do decide to go with the grand arc, you have a number of options. \nYou may choose to throw your players in the middle of things (starting with the \nevacuation of Stygia or the Sixth Great Maelstrom, for instance), or to let events \ncome to them (Stygian refugees show up at the door of their Necropolis). You may \nchoose the “pond ripple” effect (in the wake of High King David’s disappearance, \nthe throne factions start pressuring local nobles to pick sides), or the “home-front” \nPBONOUNCEMENTS \nEBOM O N  H I ~ H  \n"

If you’re running a game full of players who \nknow White Wolf “canon” backward and forward, pull a fast one on them. Start \nsending Malkavian Narrator characters into the game professing that they’re no \nlonger able to command men’s minds. All they can do is spread their madness like \na contagion. Your characters may know that only Sabbat Malkavians can do what \nthese newcomers are claiming, but the players will probably have heard of the \nrecent changes to Vampire: The Masquerade andLaws of the Night.

Mister Frost!” \nThe sound of the children’s voices wasn’t what made Mr. Frost look up from his \nwell-thumbed paperback to glare over the thick glass of the main display case. Rather, \nit was the harsh sound of the front door slamming behind the children as they came that, \nin turn, caused the antique bronze chimes he had neatly tied to the top of the door to \njangle discordantly instead of chiming in their usual harmony. \nIf there was anything at all that made Mr. Frost upset - \nand not many things in \nlife had received this honor- it was witnessing an item being misused. That was simply \nunacceptable, and he elaborated this opinion at great length to anyone around him who \nhad the misfortune to be caught abusing a possession of theirs in such a fashion. It was \nprecisely this habit of his, in fact, which had earned his tiny curiosity shop a reputation \nfor.. . eccentricity among the city’s antiques and collectibles crowd, a reputation which \nserved to keep away the more “respectable” collectors - \nat least when they thought \nanyone was watching them, that is. \nNot that Mr. Frost cared for such petty matters of public esteem. Customers who \nneeded him came to him, and that sort of business had always been more than enough \nto keep the shop in the black and fund his annual excursions to London and Cairo. \nBesides, as these children had proven ably, the bulk of his transactions were with \nanother sort of customer entirely. \nThey had come to him the night before, just as he had been about to close the store \nfor the night, looking ten times more bedraggled and positively frantic. It had taken him \nseveral minutes to calm the five children down, but when he finally heard their story, \nit had set even his chill blood to boiling. According to the eldest, a satyr childling \nnamed Jesse, the short version of their adventure went something like this: \nThe five of them had snuckout of their houses and been roaming around after dark, \nwhen they decided it would be fun to go and see the old abandoned Jervais Mansion. \nOf course, Mr. Frost knew of the place himself - \nafter all, no fae could grow up in this \ntownwithout hearing tales about the “haunted house” that stood like adamnedsentinel \nat the outer edge of the Garden District. The little motley had nerved themselves up \nwith flashlights and a couple of good ghost stories, then gone over to the house to poke \nin the closets and raise some spooks. \nNervous and giggling as they were, they hadn’t seen any obvious ghosts as they \napproached, but the laughter had quickly faded when they entered the house itself. \nThere was precious little dust for an “abandoned” house, and going from room to room, \n"

A lot of the symbols looked new, but some \nlooked like they’d been there for a long time, painted in faded paint or scuffed over by \nthe marks of many feet. Most of the furniture was gone, but every room had a sinister- \nlooking ebony statue crouching in at least one comer, watching them with narrow eyes. \nThere were bookcases too, piled high with strange black books and objects, from tiny \nsilver knives to big crystal balls and ominously human-looking skulls. They were all \ngrowing more scared as they went, but they were also convinced (as only children can \nbe) that this place was just a “regular old haunted house,” so they were in no real danger. \nConvinced, that is, until they finally entered the back pantry by the cellar. \nThere they found chairs, a pile of new magazines, a walkie-talkie, a half-empty cup \nof soda and a shiny pistol staring at them forlornly from where it lay on top of a glossy \nnew Time magazine. Despite the heat, there was still ice in the cup, as if it had been left \nonly a short time ago, and the sight of the gun brought the whole message home in a \nway the other, more exotic objects couldn’t: There are peopk in this house. Red peopk, \nandred badpeopkat that. Andifthey’remtheremw, then youcan bet they’llbe backsoon. \nIn fact, water was running behind a door not far away, meaning that the someone who \nowned the gun was probably in the bathroom, bound to return any second. \nTrembling with fear, the children &wore that they had been about to go home \nwhen they heard voices in the basement. Chanting, to be precise. The children all \nlookedembmassed at this part of the story. Even with such obvious danger staring them \nin the face, such noises were too much to resist investigating, especially in a haunted \nhouse like the Jervais place. But when they went down the stairs they saw not some \ncollection of innocent bed-sheeted specters, but a group of 12 pale, dark-robed figures \nperforming what even children could see was some sort of dark ritual. \nInvestigating was Mistake Number One. \nMistake Number Two came when one of them (no one would remember who) \nscreamed at the sight. The robed figures had turned immediately, baring wicked fangs \nand chasing the children out of the building hollering all manner of vile curses. The \nchildren had run as fast as they could, leaping fences and ducking under hedges to get \naway, but even once they were out of range, the monsters called after them. They yelled \nthat the children had already been caught by their spells, that there was nowhere they \nwould be safe now. The monsters called the children by name to show the truth behind \nthese threats, then promised to drink their blood and inflict other hideous forms of \nrevenge. \nNow the children were too scared to go to the Duke, and they had heard there was \nonly one other person to turn to insuch asituation, one personwhocouldset everything \nright -for a tidy fee, that is. Mr. Frost had graciously accepted that compliment, asked \nthem each to return the next morning with an item they valued and sent them on their \nway once he reassured them that daylight would render the monsters powerless for the \ntime being. Now here they had returned. \n“Mister Frost,” Jesse panted, her disheveled hair glowing like banked embers. \n“We.. . we have.. .” She trailed off, gulping air like a landed catfish. Mr. Frost’s scowl \ndeepened. A person’s body was her ultimate possession, after all, and seeing such a \npretty one so mistreated didnothing for his disposition. He swallowed hisdistaste as best \nhe could, though. These children were badly frightened, and thus such minor lapses \nwere excusable. This time, anyway. \n"

He steppedlightly to the front door and \npulled down the shade, pausing only to turn the deadbolt and change the store sign over \nto “Closed.” Suitably arranged, he returned to his high stool. The wide eyes of the young \nmotley followed him intently all the while, the payments he’d asked them to bring \nclutched tightly in five pairs of hands. He knitted his pale, slender fingers - \nso like the \ntalons of a hunting bird, or so many customers had noticed - \ntogether under his chin, \nfixed his deep obsidian eyes on them and began to close the deal he had bartered with \nthem only the night before. \n“School?” \n“We played hooky.” \n“I’ll see what I can do about that. What have you brought me?“ \nJesse, whose full fae name was Jesselayth, turned to the other children and looked \nat them pleadingly, her own hand closed tightly around something Mr. Frost couldn’t \nquite make out. “Guys. ..” \nMichael, a little eshu boy, came forward first, looking up at Mr. Frost with calm \ngreen eyes. ‘‘I got a book for you,” he said, his initial hesitation disappearing as his kith \nconfidence with the spoken word reasserted itself. “It’s an old one that I got from the \nlibrary last year. Mrs. Jacobs said I could keep it cause they were gonna throw it out \nanyway, so I took it home. It’s really cool and it’s got all kindsa wicked gross pictures \nin it, too.’’ He produced a tattered, coverless paperback whose yellowing title page \nproclaimed it Dr. Rando’s Amazing World ofthe Occult and Bizarre! Mr. Frost picked it \nup, careful not to damage it, and began flipping through the pages. “There’s a picture \nof a guy’s cut-off head in the middle,” Michael added helpfully. \n“Thank you, Michael,” Mr. Frost said with a grave nod of his head, concealing a \nsmile. He turned to the others. “What else do you have?” \n“I found this in my dad’s closet next to his spaceship,” ventured Kenny, the tow- \nhaired pooka boy, putting a box on the counter. It was a build-it-yourself model car kit, \nseemingly untouched despite the words “Made in the USA 1959” printed on one side. \n“He said I could have it, so I took it.” Kenny scratched his nose nervously, setting his \nthin whiskers and heavy cheeks shaking in tandem. “It’s pretty new though, so I don’t \nthink it’s worth anything.” \nMr. Frost waved the concern away, ideas for the kit’s use already spinning in his \nmind. “You’re a born trader, my boy. This will do fine.” The pooka’s ears twitched with \npride at the compliment. “What else?” \nA pile of black feathers - \nwhich once might have been acrow but could now only \ncharitably be called a mess -slapped down on the counter with a wet sqoosh. ‘‘I was \nsaving it for lunch, but you can have it.” Jacque (pronounced “Jock” by anyone who \nwanted to avoid a giant wedgie or killer Indian bum) grinned his irregular shark‘s smile \nup at Mr. Frost. His eyes dared a refined gentleman like Mr. Frost to touch such a gross \nthing without throwing up, dared him in the leering fashion even the smallest redcaps \nlearn. \n“Delightful,” Mr. Frost declared, sweeping the wrecked carcass up to inspect it. ‘‘I \nknow just the person who might make some use of this item.” He looked carefully from \nchild to child, seeing that hope had started to dawn on their faces. Excellent. Still, he \nhad a part to play, and he stuck to it. “Thii can’t be all of it, can it?” \n"

He took the broach and \nexamined it gravely. A grand idea was already forming in his mind, but it was lacking \none crucial piece. He hoped the last offering would complete the set. “Have no fear, \nyoung Jesse. It shall not be wasted. Thank you.” The children all breathed relief \nsimultaneously. He raised one final speculative eyebrow. “Anything else!” \n“Yes, Mister Fross,” came the tiny, whispered reply. Peep stepped forward, his \noversized dark eyes and mousy mop of hair a sharp contrast to his pale skin. Easily the \nyoungest, the little sluagh had to stand on his toes just to reach the countertop, and Mr. \nFrost suspected that the boy must’ve been carried by someone during the getaway the \nnight before. Nonetheless, he seemed to fit in with the others just fine. “I rescued these \nfrom the post office last spring. It was really cold in there, and I got scared.” With great \ncare, the boy slid a folded sheet of white paper across the glass top. “Are they okay?” \nMr. Frost picked up the sheet, on which were stuck five brightly colored butterfly \nstamps. He frowned for a moment, then a slight smile flickered across his lips like a \nshadow at the edge of candlelight. “They’re perfect, child. Just perfect. And you’re very \nbrave.” \nMr. Frost sat for a moment more in silence, then rose to his feet, pulling down his \nblackgreatcoat and carefully sweeping each item into a pocket. “Come,children. I shall \ntake care of your monster problem for you, but there are many things I need to do, and \nthe day is short. Let’s go.” \nAs they followed the enigmatic sluagh out into the early morning light, Kenny \nturned to Jesse and said, with no small amount of admiration, “I think he’s gonna get \nus all killed after all.” \n“Come on, Kenny,” Jesse said, tugging the pooka along. \n“I can’t believe we’re in a TV studio!” Jesse exclaimed. \nThe office was small but colorful, its walls slathered in garish movie posters and \nshelves teeming with odd knickknacks, and the children gaped comically at the array \nof memorabilia before them. Old movie posters from fifties B-movies vied with pictures \nof alleged Bigfoot tracks and blown-up reproductions offamous UFO photos. Mr. Frost’s \nstore and its prized collectibles were one thing, but this collection was far more \ncontemporary and thus struck a more active nerve. Mr. Frost didn’t care one way or \nanother - \nit was the office’s occupant, Emory Dodge, they’d come to see. \nDodge rose from his rolling chair, extending a hand across the desk with a wide \nsmile for his old contact, sparing a slightly puzzled but affable expression for the group \nof children Frost brought with him. The pooka’s loud yellow blazer and neon green tie \nwent well with the decor, though they would’ve staggered sensible fashion designers \nfrom miles away against any other backdrop. Mr. Frost could see where the makeup had \nbeen applied to remove the natural dark circles under the man’s eyes, the only touch \nof the pooka’sraccoon nature that mortals could see.

Is it \nvaluable ?” \n“Not at all, Frost,” Kincaid said, arching a sardonic eyebrow. “Not to someone \nwho’s been looking for a model from this series made in this year to complete a life- \nspanning collection. Hardly worth the concrete foundation under our feet.” \nThe flat, poured base chd look a little uneven to Frost, but he neglected to mention \nit in deference to Kincaid’s feelings. \n“Sure, I’ll do the job,” Kincaid shouted over the noise at last, his rough hands \ncaressing the smooth contours of the box like a lover’s curves. “But are you really sure \nabout this?

Mr. Frost - \nseldom a caller in this part \nof town-was still admiring the tasteful decor when the kinain reappeared to usher him \ninto the back of the store for an audience with the Baroness. \nThe Baroness appeared as he had always known her: a boggan of uncommon grace \ndressed in a simple blue-satin outfit that nonetheless teased out every aspect of her \nbeauty. She was still bent over a fine silk dress with a needle in one hand and a spool \nof thread in the other when he coughed softly to announce himself. Even at court, she \nseldom left her knitting far from her hands, always altering some item or weaving \nanother as she entertained guests or weighed cases brought before her. \nThis scene was a familiar one to Frost.

Now, it was amarvel in itself, \nan innocent wish captured in cream-colored silk and fine silver thread. But even as Mr. \nFrost entered, the Baroness threw away her needle in despair, as if facing a puzzle she \nsimply couldn’t solve. Hearing him approach, the Baroness looked up and smiled \nthinly, the frustration evident at the comers of her lips. \n“My Lady Rhiannon,” Mr. Frost said, nodding slightly. \n“Come and be welcome, Cyrus Frost,”she replied, waving his politeness away.

Oh, really, Cyrus.” \n“Not a bribe, Lady Rhiannon,” said Mr. Frost persuasively, rolling the pearls slowly \nin his fingers. “No, think of it as gesture of good faith, a way of compensating you for \nassuming the inconvenience of pursuing the matter with the Jervais house on my \nbehalf.” He smiled ever so slightly. “I believe the Society’s monthly meeting is due any \nday now, is it not?”The Baroness nodded cautiously. “How fortuitous. Then please, take \nthis little token,” he pressed the broach into her palm, “and accept my gratitude.” He \npaused for just a heartbeat. ‘‘I believe it might just complete the image you’re looking \nfor with that dress, if I may say so.” \nSurprised, Baroness Rhiannon compared the broach to the dress, at first hesi- \ntantly, then with more interest. She clucked her tongue, held them both up to the light, \nthen nodded almost imperceptibly and turned back to the waiting sluagh, a bemused \nlookon her face. “Alright, Cyrus, I’ll call the Society and bring it up with them tonight. \nIf anything comes of it, I’ll let you know. I don’t know what your interest in this matter \nis - \nand frankly I’m not sure if I want to - \nbut restoring that house would truly be a \nbeautiful deed, a blessing to kith and kinain alike. So I will take it on.. . faith that your \nintentions are noble.” \nMr. Frost looked deadly serious. “You have my word on it, Lady Rhiannon.” \nShe held his gaze a moment longer, then nodded once more. “Then go in peace, \nCyrus Frost. I only hope your hunch is as impeccable as your fashion sense.” Mr. Frost \nmerely smiled in response and rose to leave. He had not yet crossed the threshold, \nhowever, when the Baroness called after him. \n"

He simply waited outside the old mausoleum \nin which the contact slept until the last rays of daylight were dying on the horizon, \npositioned himself carefully in front of the door and knocked three times briskly on the \nheavy marble. A shuffling arose from within, and the marble groaned aside a few inches. \nFrost could see no more than the pale, delicate curve of the tomb‘s inhabitant’s cheek. \n“Some dream comes to tempt me,” the bored, cultured and very old voice said \nquietly from within. “It wants something. What does it want?” \n“I need the address of one of your kind,” Mr. Frost said very carefully, making sure \nto keep his voice respectful and calm. “More specifically, I need you to deliver \nsomething to that one before the night gets under way.” \n“What insight does this dream bring me?” the voice asked in smooth, even tones. \n“Your word first,” Frost whispered, knowing he played a dangerous game. The \nseductive caress of Banality already tickled his skin like cold water. \n“And why shouldn’t I just wake from this dream?” the voice said, lowering in \ntimbre and humming with thinly repressed anger. “And in waking, dream it no more.” \nThe shape within stepped forward, revealing a silken fall of black hair before Frost \nstepped aside. The last, dying rays of sunlight on the western horizon (which Frost’s \nshadow had been blocking off) fell into the tomb. The figure inside made no sound, but \ndarted back instantly. Frost stepped back into place. \n“I’ll dream a while longer,” the voice said tightly, after a very long, tense pause. \n“Tell of your insight. I will indulge the dream its message.” \n"

He held out a \nbulging manila envelope, sealed and marked with only a name and a title of nobility. \n“Time is of the essence.” \nHysterical laughter erupted from within the tomb, and Frost had to force himself \nnot to take a step back. Tides of Banality surged and swelled around him. \n“I’ll deliver it,” the voice whispered, still laughing. “Now, fill me with your \nportent.” \nFrost saw a pale, perfect hand emerge from the tomb, and he put the envelope into \nit. \n“And Frost,” the voice said, banishing all traces of mirth as quickly as blowing out \na cand’.?.

Definitely the Seer’s work, he thought with a mental sigh. The stamps hadn’t even \nbeen postmarked. Then again, the Seer had never really understood the contrivances \nof modem bureaucracy. \nWaving the butler away offhandedly, he slit the package open with sharpened \nfingemails. A video cassette marked “Weekly Weirdness News Show 149” fell out, \nalong with a small, handwritten note in the same old-fashioned script that graced the \nenvelope the package had come in. \nHe skimmed the note distractedly at first, then read it again with greater \nconcentration. The language of the note betrayed modem colloquialisms and patterns \nof thought vastly different from the Seer’s timeless linguistic flavor. All of the prince’s \nearlier good humor faded during the third reading, replaced by a widening scowl as \ndangerous as any fault line. By the time he had finished his fifth reading, any vestigial \npretense of humanity was long gone, the ashen hue of his undead state unmistakably \napparent in his rage. It was all he could do to fight the urge to twist the tape into plastic \nribbons as he slid it into the VCR.

      "text": "circulation play-test version of True Magic rules. Consider this feature damage- \ncontrol against pre-existing LARP mages you’ve already into your game. \nALLTHB POWERINTHE \nUNIVERSE \nPerhaps the most pressing problem with live-action mages is the incredible \nflexibility of the table-top magical system. With the right control of the nine \nSpheres, a mage can do just about anything. That being the case, how does one \ntranslate this broad variety into live-action play? You need an impartial Narrator to \ndetermine what a mage can and can’t do, and having a Narrator for every mage player \nis just too unwieldy, even in games where the mage population is relatively low. \nUsing an Effect-based system of established rotes is one idea, but it limits what \nmages can do and runs counter to the Mage philosophy of altering the universe \naccording to your will. Given enough time and knowledge, mages are supposed to \nbe able to perform unbelievable feats at the slightest of thoughts! A list of permissible \nEffects is like, well, a list of spells out of a game by that other company. \nTHE PARADOX \nPROBLEM \nParadox isn’t just a problem for mages, it’s a problem in games, too. Paradox \ntends to strike according to the resonance that a mage has picked up - \nweird events \nand happenings that mess around with her individual style of magic and intent. \nObviously, forming such an intensely individualized threat requires Narrator inter- \nvention, and you’re back to the problem of having a Narrator to follow every player \naround. A point-based backlash system is possible, but it lacks the flexibility and \nrandomness of true Paradox behavior. You could always make up Paradox backlashes \non the spot, but the problem then becomes one of consistency and duration. Until \nthe effect wears off (if it does), you would have to assign a Narrator to follow the \ncharacter around to a.) make sure he’s roleplaying amage beset by such a n  effect, and \nb.) inform onlookers of what bizarre effect they see when the mage player neglects \nto do so. \n~ o c I ?  \nWHAT ~ o c I ?  \nAnother typical problem for Mage LARPers lies in the use of foci. Although \nmages are encouraged to use foci in the tabletop game, many foci are just impractical \nas props for live-action. It won’t do to carry around a sword, a gun or a bone rattle \n(in public, even), so how does a mage player get a handle on foci? Item cards just lack \nthe panache, although there isn’t much choice ofwhether or not to use them. Doing \naway with foci altogether deadens a lot of the game’s flavor. \nI TURNTHB \nBUILDINC~TO \n$LASS. ” \nOh yeah. Need we mention the ‘‘I turn the vampire into a lawn chair” syndrome \nof True Magic’s flexibility? Frankly, when given time, a mage can pull off stunts that \nseriously screw with game continuity. It does little good to play in a mirror of your \nhome city if that Marauder wannabe just reduced downtown to a sinkhole. Ifyou run \nthe inevitable crossover, having a mage reduce the opposition to small heaps of \nstuffed toys gets tiresome very quickly. Managing high-end power is a real concern \nwhen Masters can rend the fabric of reality and then fold, spindle and mutilate \nanything in their way. \n66 \nLAWS 01 ASCENSION \nI \n"

      "text": "SYSTEMS \nAs far as the systems for simulating magical Effects, Paradox and Foci g \nwon’t even begin to take a stab at it. These areas are best left toyour house rules \nwe come up with a workable system of our own. Any simulation we propost \nwould be an invitation for such a never-ending enfilade of e-mail and letter \nwe’d never forgive ourselves. Ifwe’re going to open ourselves up to that, we’ll roll the \ndice on a full-production, $15 Laws of Ascension book, thank you very much. \nMore generally, however, we can give you an idea of how to simulate the rest \nof MET play where mages are concerned. We can give you how to build a mage, \nwhen to play R-P-S and what the various mage-only Traits might do. Again, these \nrules aren’t MET canon, but they’re a step in that direction. \nMost everybody out there has a few systems for simulating Mage. If you need a \nsimple, quick-and-dirty way to simulate Arete, casting and so on, just try out the \nfollowing guidelines: \nCreate your mage character with seven primary Traits, five secondary and three \ntertiary. You get five Abilities and seven Backgrounds (Influence, AVU~LZT, \nMentor, \nand so on). You get three Willpower Traits. \nYou start with one Trait of Arete. When you perform an Effect, it requires a test \nwith a Static difficulty determined by Sphere and level. You can use an Arete Trait \nfor a retest, once per night per Trait. You can never have more levels in a Sphere than \nyou have Arete Traits. Also, for each Arete Trait that you have, your maximum \nTraits in each Attribute category go up by one from the base nine for a supernatural \nhuman. Thus, with Arete one, you can have up to 10 Traits, while Arete five allows \nup to 14 Traits. \nYou get five levels of Spheres, chosen from the Basic levels. You also get a free \nlevel in your Tradition Sphere, even if that Trait takes you to the Intermediate level. \nIf you’re an Orphan, you just get a sixth Basic level in a Sphere of your choice. \nThe difficulty for magic is typically the Effect level +4 Traits if it’s detectahle, \n+3 Traits if it’s not. Thus, using a Sense Forces (first level undetectable Effect) is \ndifficulty 4, while a lightning bolt (Forces 3, definitely detectable and improbable) \nis difficulty 7. You can make a retest with an Ability if it’s appropriate to your \nparadigm and focus (using Linguistics if you’re a Hermetic mage speaking Enochian, \nor Do if you’re an Akashic Brother, for instance). \nAnytime you want to inflict aggravated damage or create something out of \nnothing, you must expend a Trait of Quintessence. You can also spend a Trait of \nQuintessence to lower a magical difficulty by one. You start with Quintessence \nTraits equal to your Avatar Background rating (bought as a normal Background for \njust this purpose), and you get more from Nodes or Tass (see the Mage book for \ndetails). \nWhenever you fail an Effect Test and the difficulty is twice your number of \nTraits or whenever you fail a retest on an Effect, you suffer Paradox. \nAs a rule of thumb for combat, a level-two Sphere can inflict one level of \ndamage, a level-three Sphere can avoid or absorb one level of damage, a level-four \nSphere can negate an enemy’s point of special power (Blood, Willpower, Gnosis, \netc.), and a level-five Sphere can inflict two levels of damage. \n"

The Four Magistrates and their assistants administer the routine chores of govem- \nment. Smaller towns may have fewer magistrates, or the population might be forcibly relocated \nto larger communities. A few wraith families usually provide most of the officials, as they did in \nlife. \nDistrict magistrates oversee groups of town and rural areas. Families have to work harder to \nmaintain dominance at the district level, and individual service - \nor lack thereof - \ncomes to \nmatter more than family connections. City magistrates, overseeing large Necropoli, operate as \npeers of district magistrates. They divide cities into sectors and neighborhoods, each with its own \nFour Magistrates. Sometimes a few families achieve dominance, but, more often, high population \ndensity leads to constant upheaval and little continuity of lineage among the staff. \nCommanderies oversee several towns and the surrounding rural districts. District command- \ners scrutinize their subordinates throughout the area. It’saprestigious positionwithfewdemands.. . \nmost of the time. \nThe Jade Kingdom consists of 34 provinces, each with a Governor chosen directly by the \nEmperor and provincial representatives of the Four Branches. Governors have final authority in \nprinciple; whether they use it, delegate it or find it manipulated away from them depends on the \nindividuals involved. The Emperor can review and negate governors’ decisions, but he seldom \ndoes so. \nThe imperial court itself occupies the Jade Palace, a sprawl of more than 200 separate \nbuildings deep within the Tempest. A single prominent jade road connects the palace with the \nShadowlands. Yu Huang moves his residence and chambers fromone building to the next without \nwarning, driven by constant paranoia and fear. A separate staff unit specializes in keeping track \nof his whereabouts for urgent reports. The Four Branches maintain their headquarters in the Jade \nPalace as well. \nOfficials at all levels receive salaries, but they’re not paid enough to cover their actual \nexpenses, let alone the social displays expected of them. Ironclad custom requires subordinates to \ngive “gifts” to their superiors, and citizens offer “gifts in appreciation for service” to officials. This \nuniversal pattern of bribery isn’t considered immoral unless it gets really, profoundly out of hand \nor officials take payments without providing appropriate service in response. \nTHOSE \nWHO RULE \nThe specific proper names given for the branch leaders in this section come fromDark \nKingdom of Jade. Feel free to change them for your own chronicle, if you want to give a \ndifferent flavor to the relations between branches and their respective styles of operation. \nT H E  \nEOUR BRANCHES \nThe Jade Censors keep track of the resources of the kingdom. They supervise Reaping, tally \nArtifacts and relics and review the allocation of raw materials. The Emperor guarantees families \nthe right to Reap their own kin, but in practice an endless network of regulations and judgments \nmakes it impossible to maintain consistency.

Likewise, every relic theoretically \ncarries an imperial stamp of approval and authorization before ending up in someone’s hands for \nvery long. The Censors get busiest in times of war and natural disaster in the Skinlands; crises bring \nout both the worst and the best in the Branch. Hu Ji, a woman of unknown mortal antecedents, \nruns the Branch. She’s personally wealthy and therefore free from most temptations to yield to \npowerful families, but she’s not so secure as to be entirely sure she enjoys the Emperor’s support. \nThe Judges of the Dead make sure that Jade laws apply fairly and consistently. As Han Fei’s \nprinciples suggest, justice itself isn! te t a primary concern: Any system applied consistently suffices \nto create a Legalist social order. The Judges monopolize law enforcement among civilians, but they \nmay be required to yield to the Military in wartime and crisis. In accordance with Chinese \ntradition, the judge conducts his own investigation, combining the functions that Westem justice \nseparates out among judges, prosecutors and police. The Judge also holds the authority to carry out \nhis recommended punishment, though appeal up the chain of command is possible. Judges require \nmore assistants as their territory widens, and commandery and provincial judges personally try \nonly the most important (or interesting) cases. Li Gao has directed the Judges for three centuries \nand enjoys the closest relations with the Emperor. He’s known for punishing and purging Judges \nwho show too much sympathy or other incompetence. \nThe Protectorate of the Prosperous Realm seeks out sedition among citizens and corrup- \ntion among officials. Protectors enjoy very broad authority to investigate anything that looks like \na possible violation of Jade law. Since almost everything is a violation of some sufficiently obscure \nedict, Protectors can punish nearly anyone at any time. Nobody can keep them out, and lying to \nthem constitutes an admission of guilt. They cannot impose sentence - \nthat’s the realm of the \nJudges, Censors or Military depending on the nature of the offense - \nbut their recommendations \nusually find acceptance. Formal trials don’t always happen. Everything from Buddhist proselytiz- \ning to questioning the divinity of the Emperor can bring Protector attention down on lowly souls. \nFan Wushang has directed the Protectorate for 1500years. While he enjoys the Emperor’s support, \nhe also keeps himself personally at adistance so that the Protectorate does not seem merely an arm \nof imperial whim. \nThe Military makes the Emperor’s wishes known by corporeal force. Military units include \ninfantry, cavalry, navy and (in more recent times) mechanized forces of all kind. Most soldiers \nvolunteer for terms of a few years, as being a veteran opens doors for the rest of a wraith‘s existence \nand brings honor to one’s family. Some duties, like patrolling major highways in the heart of &e \nkingdom, pass without stress or risk. Others, like policing bad neighborhoods in the Occupied \nTerritories, consume tremendous numbers of soldiers, which makes even the compensatory \nopportunities for personal looting look less desirable. Peng Xin, hero of the wars with Stygia, \noversees all military force in the empire ... except the Immortal Guard, who answer only to the \nEmperor. \nE A M I L I E S  \nFamily provides the basis of identity in the Yellow Springs. In the face of a vast imperial \nhierarchy, family provides shelter, purpose, protection and support. Family members look after \neach other’s interests - \none well-placed official can arrange contracts and patronage for many \nneedy relatives. Yellow Springs “families” were all actually composed of true family members in \nolder times, but in the modemday, these families comprisegatherings ofwraiths linked by attitude, \nworldview or interest rather than lineage. The Communist campaign against traditional supersti- \ntion and the chaos of modernization separated many wraiths from their lineages.

Even though Chinese tradition \ngenerally encourages subservience or at least passive dissent and withdrawal, rebellion has old \nroots as well. Challengingrulers who no longer enjoy Heaven’s mandate to govern is anestablished \nrole for the virtuous rebel, and few rebels rush to think of themselves as anything other than \nvirtuous. Any citizen with a grievance might become an outlaw, though the vast majority don’t. \nThe Occupied Territories host more organized resistance movements. Japan and Tibet in \nparticular challenge imperial power, and they require constant suppression. See World of \nDarkness: Tokyo for a detailed discussion of Japanese efforts to throw off Jade rule. In addition, \npersistent rumors about the Emperor’s nature encourage dissent that might turn violent. It’s a \nmatter of history that early in his reign, Yu Huang descended into the Tempest and fought the \nMalfean Lung Wang. The official story is that Yu Huang triumphed, seizing Lung Wang’s power \nand possessions for his own. Persistent rumor says that Lung Wang won and uses the Emperor’s skin \nfor his own nefarious agenda, whatever it may be. Everyone agrees that the Emperor’s might \ntranscends that of any other wraith. The question is simply whether that’s because of his powers \ntaken by conquest or because he’s actually a master demon in human disguise. \nThe Jade Kingdom and Stygia do not get along well. Ever since the Russo-Japanese War at \nthe beginning of the 20th century, there’s been nearly constant conflict. In the 193Os, minor \nskirmishes escalated to all-out war, with the Jade fleet invading along unsuspected Byways to sack \nBoston. The war ended not long before the outbreak of the Fifth Great Maelstrom and weakened \nboth governments’ ability to respond to the storm. Tensions have risen steadily ever since, and \nobservers on all side predict a fresh conflict soon \nTo Jade wraiths, Stygians seem barbarous at best. They have little social order, no proper \nappreciation of family, no sense of piety. It’s easy for a cultured inhabitant of the Yellow Springs \nto see the typical Stygian !as little better than an articulate kueis .

In Part One (“Ambassador”), the circle met TadashiNakagawa, aYellow Springs emissary \ncarryingarelicwakizmhiand anoddlist ofnamesofStygianHeretics (bothoutspokenandcovert). \nHowever, Nakagawa mysteriously dropped into a Harrowing before he could divulge any \ninformation on why he was carrying the relic or the list. The only clue to his real mission was a \nscrap of paper reading, “Find optimal points; solidify alliances; look for the unblinking.” The \ncharacters may have even discovered that the relic was somehow tainted, infecting its user with \ntemporary Angst. \nIn Part Two of the chronicle (“Deployment”), the circle discovered that the list of names \nof Heretics that Nakagawa was carrying comprised a Heretic cult acting in collusion with the Dark \nKingdom ofJade. The cult, with members scattered throughout the Dark Kingdom of Iron, has laid \nthe groundwork for an invasion, and that invasion is imminent and inevitable. In discovering this \ninformation, the circle may have gone to the Hierarchy, the Renegades beyond the walls of the \nNecropolis or even the Heretics themselves. No matter where they’ve gone, the wraiths are likely \nto have stepped on some toes and made some enemies. \nNow the wakizmhi is still on the loose, the Jade forces are at the gates, and an ill wind has \nbegun to blow and scrape outside the citadel walls.. .. \nS O M E  \nTECHNICAL \nNOTES \nNo ready-made adventure could possibly account for player creativity, Narrator preference, \nor even pure chance; there are just too many variables to make for a single story that will work for \neveryone. Flexibility is essential. Keeping that in mind, each installment of the adventure is \nbroken into individual scenes. The scenes are then divided into two sections: Hard Info and \nChoices. \nHard Info is just what it might appear: facts, events, and information that must, somehow, \noccur or be revealed for the adventure to run as planned. How you work it into the story is largely \nup to you as Storyteller, but it needs to get in there. Feel free to use existing social structures, \nNarrator characters or your favorite plot devices to deliver this information. \nChoices are, again, just what they might appear. They spell out some of the things wraith \ncharacters might do in reaction to the Hard Info, plus some of the ways the story would be affected \nby character actions. The Choices account for the story’s flexibility as characters, both Narrator \nand player, drive the plot. As long as the skeleton of the adventure a3 the Hard Info ae is intact, \ndon’t worry about forcing the flesh into any particular shape. Let the players play their characters. \nYour only job is to emphasize drama and suspense. \nBy the way, the rest of this information is for Storyteller’s only, unless you want to spoil the \nsurprise of what’s going to happen next. \nPART \nTHREE: \nINVASION \nS U g g E S T I O N S  \nUnless your own version of this story calls for them, you won’t need any special props to \nadvance the plot, other than the relic wukizashi delivered by Nakagawa in Part One of the \nchronicle. You might consider re-introducing Nakagawa to the action, but unless you can come \nup with a convincing reason for how he has managed to make it all the way back to the location \nof your game from the Shadowlands of Japan (to which he returned after his Harrowing), you don’t \n"

You could bring back Joseph Sauvant (the Hierarchy agent assigned to monitor the \nwraiths after they approached Hierarchy representatives with their information or suspicions - \nif they did so) as well, although he plays no special role in the events as they’re written. \nS C E N E  \nONE \nHard Info: \nBefore the scene gets started, characters may notice the wind picking up and the screaming \nbehind that wind. Perception-based Static Challenges may be made, or Narrators may decide \narbitrarily who notices. What savvy observers should be able to figure out is that there’s a \nMaelstrom brewing, and it’s going to be big. At the same time, the armies of the Yellow Springs, \nlong on the march, are finally within striking-distance of the Stygian empire. Forces are aimed at \nStygia itself, and the air of growing tension should be palpable. Everyone’s waiting for something \nto happen, and the Maelstrom is getting closer.. .. \nChoices: \nIf one of the characters recognizes the brewing Maelstrom for what it is, the Circle might \nchoose to hole up in a strong Haunt early and try to hide from the Jade invaders. Should there be \nno Pardoner in the Circle or in the group’s allies, the characters may be able to reason with a \nRenegade Pardoner or a friendly Hierarchy one. \nIf the characters are outside their city, they might be faced with entire warships popping out \nof Nihils. Also, if there are city gates, the first line of defense against a Maelstrom or invasion is \ngoing to be that wall and those gates. The wraiths better hurry if they want to get inside. If they \nfeel like it, let them try to convince Renegades or Heretics outside to join them inside where it’s \n“safe.” They may have trouble talking their way past the city guards, but base the amount of static \nthey get on how well they roleplay. \nSome enterprising (or suicidally insane) characters may even try to bargain/ negotiate with \nrepresentatives of the Jade army, but do not let this tactic succeed unless the speaker happens to \nbe carrying the relic wakimshi Nakagawadelivered in Part One. Under no other circumstances will \nthe Jade wraiths listen, and the relic will only keep the Jade wraith troops from slaying those \ncharacters immediately present. They will still be kept prisoner in the army’s camp. \nS C F N E  Two \nHard Info: \nThis scene serves as exposition for whatever information the characters may have missed \nthus far. It should come out in the wash that Nakagawa was nothing more than a Jade-Kingdom \nspy, on the lookout for the Heretic cult responsible for opening the city to invasion. The relic \nwakizashi he carried was to be delivered to a stronghold of that cult and displayed as a symbol for \nJade troops to pass over that location in their attack. Ferret out any cult spies who may have \ninfiltrated the Hierarchy (and who, likely, have been trying to get rid of the characters who “know \ntoo much”). Set this discovery scene against the rising tide of the Maelstrom winds and the \nrevelation that something huge and unexpected has just happened to upset the boundary between \nthe Labyrinth and the Tempest (see Ends of Empire to find out exactly what it is). \nChoices: \nThe choices in this scene revolve around how you deliver this information. If your characters \nare in the camp of the invading army, perhaps a too-proud captain of the military spills the beans. \nA series of interrogations and/ or torture sessions can reveal the necessary gems within the safety \nof the Hierarchy. Outside the walls, a crusty Renegade veteran of the Underworld may have \ndiscovered the conspiracy and have been all too happy to tell the characters about it, in exchange \nfor their putting a good word in for him with the Hierarchs. (After all, it was the Renegades who \ndestroyed one of Nakagawa’s fetters in Part One, hoping to stop him before he accomplished his \nmission.) \nHowever, once all this information has been relayed, there’s no time left to do anything \nabout it. \n"

      "text": "S C E N E  \nTHREE \nHard Info: \nThe other shoe drops, the last straw falls and all hell breaks loose. The timing of this scene \nis ultimately up to you, but starting it as soon after the preceding scene as possible is best. What \nhappens is simply this: All that hangs in the balance comes crashing down in waves of destruction \nand violence. \nThe Jade armies march on the StygianNecropoli, destroying the walls, the buildings and any \nwraiths the troops can get a hold of. Any prisoners taken will be soulforged, and any building left \nstanding will be occupied by Jade forces. The only building left alone will be the one displaying \nNakagawa’s wukizashi, which is only recognizable by the taint it carries. \nWorse yet, the Maelstrom begins shortly on the heels of the invasion. However, this storm \nis no scattered shower on the Stygian front. The howling winds (and concomitant Spectre hordes) \nherald the coming of the Sixth Great Maelstrom. Nihils the size ofcandlestick Park rip open, and \nthe worst of unimaginable foes flood the Underworld from the very mouth of Oblivion. The events \nleadingupto thestartoftheMaelstromhave beenset inmotionoff-stageand areunstoppable (see \nEnds of Empire), and now it’s right in the characters’ lap. \nThere has never been a Maelstrom this big before, so play it to the utmost. Destruction rains \n(or reigns) everywhere, playing havoc with both sides of the Stygia-Jade Kingdom battles. The \nscreams are deafening, and the silence is ear-splitting. There is nowhere to run. \n. \nChoices: \nThe greatest choices in this scene revolve around your descriptions of the carnage wrought \nby the two-fold invasion. Find out what forces ofnature scare your players and unleash those forces. \nGreat Maelstroms are destruction incarnate, so make them feel it. Make themfear it. If they can’t \nfind somewhere to hide in a reasonable amount of time, wipe them out. Make them choose who \nthey’ll count on to survive, who’ll they’ll cut off from safety if needs be and which ports they’ll run \nto in the storm. \nIf they try to hole up in a Haunt, how will they defend it from Jade wraiths and Spectres? If \nthey run to the Hierarchy, will they aid in defending the walls, or will they aid in the fighting that \nwill inevitably go on in the streets? Or will they simply hide in a deep, dark hole until the violence \npasses? \nIt’s also possible to run a scenario in which members of the Hierarchy have discovered the \nsignificance of Nakagawa’s wakizashi, and different factions are scrambling to get possession of it \nbefore the Jade army breaches the walls. \nAnd finally, you may even consider scenes of cooperation between the Stygian forces and \nJade forces. Not every Jade Kingdom wraith on the attack is expecting a horde of Spectres at their \nbacks, and in panic, they may side with their erstwhile adversaries to ride out the storm. \nS C E N E  \nEOUE \nHard Info: \nAfter some indeterminate amount of time (days, weeks, hours, years?) the Great Maelstrom \nwinds subside. The Spectres slink back into their holes, and the wave of destruction dies down. \nAt some point, the characters who have survived should crawl from wherever they’ve holed up to \nsurvey what’s Left of their world. \nChoices: \nAt this point, the choices are all yours. Decide how long the Great Maelstrom has lasted. \nDecide how muchof the setting is left intact. Decide who hassurvived. Decide if the Jade Invasion \nFleet is still on the move. It’s all up to you. \nIf you need help deciding what to do now, see Rich Dansky’s article on that subject on page \n63 of this issue of the Journal. \n"

After all, if you’ve spent months setting up plot \nlines that revolve around the characters’ involvement in one of the Smiling Lord’s \nmultifarious plots, it’s going to be profoundly unsatisfying for your players to have all \nof that swept away. They’ve put in the time, the effort and the passion of unraveling \nthe plot, and they deserve the chance to resolve it. \nThat doesn’t mean, however, that it’s necessarily a good thing to hold back the \ntide of time indefinitely. \nWhile it’s a good idea to allow any existing plot lines that would be truncated \nby Ends of Empire to wind down gracefully, it’s an even better one not to Start up \nnew threads that will pose the same problem down the road. Instead, think about \nplots that can survive or even be enhanced by the coming Great Maelstrom. Even \nif you don’t have any concrete ideas for stories that can be extended that way, you \ncan lay the groundwork for post-Maelstrom chronicles. \nStart introducing Narrator characters who’ll be important once the fertilizer \nhits the rotary ventilation device. Good ideas include Renegades with good survival \nskills for hostile conditions. Harbingers who’ll be able to get characters through \nMaelstrom conditions, or even a tough-as-nails Legionnaire who can be counted on \nto defend the Necropolis against Spectres, regardless of who’s in charge. Lay in in- \ngame ways for characters to get their hands on the necessities of unlife - \nrelics, \nArtifacts, soulfire - \nonce things get crazy. (Indeed, this concept can make for a \nwonderful lead-in plot thread: The Grim Legion is hoarding stockpiles of all sorts of \ngoodies; where are all the supplies going, and why?) Omens, signs and portents are \nyour friends - \nFatalism offers a handy way to start laying on the foreshadowing \neffectively. Having a bunch of wraiths who call themselves “Oracles” around can’t \nhurt matters, either, when it comes to lining up news of the future. Increase Spectral \nactivity - \nor have it disappear altogether and watch everyone get nervous. Send a \nFerryman into towndispensing knowledge or even gifts that have no obvious bearing \nnow, but which will be very useful once the walls come tumbling down (and in the \nmeantime, no doubt there will be a mad scramble between characters to figure out \nwho got what and why). Send out more Narrators to Shadowguide and have them \nplay matters a trifle more excited than usual. A Jade wraith who’s in the Necropolis \nto scout for the upcoming invasion can make an excellent Narrator character as well. \nTurn her loose and see if anyone catches her. All of these ideas can lead plots and \ncharacters toward the events of Ends of Empire before the actual storm, both literal \nand figurative, hits. \n11. HOLD ONTOTHE \nMOMENT \nThe fall of Enoch and the events after it take, at most, a few days. Once the \nStygian fleet anchors off the coast of the mysterious black city, the sequence of \ncalamities becomes both inevitable and swift. However, it’s highly unlikely that you \nor your Storytelling team is going to want to gear up for a 96-hour continuous \nOblivion marathon session, one which ranges from Enoch to the Necropoli to Stygia \nand beyond. (I mean, if you really really want to, I’m not going to stop you, but you’re \nresponsible for the Vivarin, the Jolt! and the nervous tics that you and your Narrators \nrack up.) \nOn the other hand, those 96 hours or so are pretty jam-packed with action.

      "text": "return of Charon, the revelation of the Mnemoi, the end of the Deathlords and more. \nThat’s a whole lot of plot. Do you really want to have all of that happening offstage? \nInstead, why not get your game involved in the epic events that are reshaping \nthe Underworld? You don’t necessarily have to run all of the pivotal moments - \nafter all, it’s going to be hard to find a rationale to shift your entire troupe from Enoch \nto a Necropolis to Stygia in the time frame available - \nbut you can pick and choose \nyour spots. If your chronicle has been set in a Necropolis, there’s no reason that you \ncan’t divert some of the Jade invasion of Stygia to your game’s gates. Furthermore, \nthere’s nothing that says that the entire invasion has to be wrapped up in a single \nsession. This is a pivotal moment in the history of the Underworld, and, to quote \nLittle Nell, “Slowly, slowly, it’s too nice a job to rush.” An invasion is rarely the sort \nof thing that gets wrapped up in a couple of hours. There’s plenty of material - \nguerilla combat, active resistance, infiltrating enemy command, sabotage, deal- \nmaking and more - \nto keep the plot simmering for session after session. After all, \nthe Sixth Great Maelstrom arrives on your schedule, not ours. \nFurthermore, no one says you have to stop at one high point. If the defense-of- \nthe-Necropolis plot is going well, maybe your players are indicating that they’d like \nto keep the action at home. There are plenty of ways, from counterattacks to going \nunderground to having characters sell out, to extend the moment. There’s no reason \nto move past a setting that’s working well, after all. You can drag this out as long as \nyou need to in order to satisfy your players. \nOn the other hand, perhaps the local wraiths might be interested in marching \noff to Stygia to defend the seat of Empire. That development would allow you to set \nup encounters in the Tempest on the way to the Isle of Sorrows as well as integrating \nthe later events of Ends of Empire into your story line. There are plenty of exciting \nscenes in the story “The Last Danse Macabre” that can be integrated into Oblivion \ngames easily enough. Why not give them a shot? \nI I I .  THE LAST DANSE \nMACABRE \nEnds of Empire does include an extended story entitled “The Last Danse \nMacabre,” which details the return of Charon to the Underworld, the coming of the \nSixth Great Maelstrom and the final fate of Stygia. The story is designed for tabletop \nplay, but there is certainly a great deal of material in it that can be lifted and \nconverted into a live-action scenario. In other words, it is entirely possible to run an \nOblivion chronicle through the events of the tabletop story. \nThere really is only one major hang-up with translating “The Last Danse \nMacabre” directly, that being the fact that the story is written for a maximum of six \ncharacters. If you’ve got a 40 person game, trying to squeeze all of them into the \nconference room at the top of the Onyx Tower to witness Charon’s re-assumption \nof power (Oops? Was that another spoiler? Silly me) might be a little difficult to \nnarrate. On the other hand, if you have a small game, or even just a small core of \nplayers who want to put some extra time in, you can very easily let them tread the \npath laid out in Ends of Empire. \nBear in mind, however, that if you do want to translate “The Last Danse \nMacabre” over, it’s going to be a fair bit of work for you and your Narrators. There \nare quite a few Narrator characters who need to be onstage or at least accounted for \nat various points in the plot, ranging from Deathlords to Jade Empire soldiers to \nCharon himself. It’s also a scene-intensive story. The setting moves from Necropolis \nLondon (or whatever city you want to use) into the Tempest and then to Stygia. If \n"

      "text": "in time? Did the Jade Empire invade, or were you on the list of bypassed targets? If \nthere was damage to the Necropolis, what’s left, what was destroyed, and how did it \nget knocked down? Answering all of these questions and others like them (Who was \nlost in the defense? What resources were expended? Above all, what happened?) \nbefore you start play is a necessity. Otherwise, you’re confronted with the daunting \ntasks of making up history on the fly and keeping it straight every time someone asks \na question. Unless you start your setting with a strong foundation, everything you \nbuild on it is going to be suspect. If you start with a clear, logical outline of your \nsetting’s recent history, you keep all of your Narrators on the same page. Further- \nmore, you make it easy to build on what’s already there. If you’re unsure of how badly \nthe Necropolis was damaged during the Maelstrom, you’re going to have a hard time \nwriting plots about Spectres hiding in the wrecked portions of the city. If you don’t \nknow if the city was invaded by the Jade Empire or not, you’re up the creek when your \nplayers start demanding to know where they can find 1eftoverTrue Jade Artifacts and \nlearn imperial Arcanoi, and so it goes. If you don’t know what’s happened, it’s that \nmuch harder to figure out what’s going to happen without tripping over your own \nfeet. \nAfter you’ve decided on the immediate history of your setting, you have to \npopulate it. Decide which wraiths are left as well as who was swept away by the tide \nof history. This question actually breaks down into other, equally vital ones. \nSpecifically, asking who’s left leads directly to asking who’s in charge, which does \nmore to set the tone of your game than perhaps anything else. Is the local Hierarchy \nstill in place, trying desperately to hold the pieces together? Have Renegades or \nHeretics taken over? Is there a Spectral presence in local politics, overt or covert? \nAnd what about refugees from Stygia? With the Isle destroyed, they have to go \nsomewhere. What are the odds that a bunch of high-and-mighty Gaunts pick your \ncity to start over in? Figuring out who’s in charge - \nwhich is primarily a function \nof which wraiths are left after the dust settles - \ndetermines how the Necropolis \noperates. A bunch of Hierarchs trying to maintain the status quo is going to insist \non a Dictum Mortuum, regulated Reaping or even more unsettling practices. If \nRenegades are in place, they may want none of these things - \nor they may discover \nthat being the new boss turns them into the old boss. Spectral authorities may lead \nto mysterious disappearances and the like. It’s up to you; there’s no right or wrong \nway to do it. Just make sure you have a clear idea of what you are doing before going \nany further. \nThe other aspect of figuring out the post-bellum population of your Necropolis \nis the general populace. Who’s left? Have the surrounding wraiths huddled into the \nCitadel for protection, or do they choose to brave the storm on their own? Is there \nastrong loyal-or disloyal-opposition to the current governing body?What about \nsmall factions like Guilds, Renegade gangs or Heretic cults? Are they present, and \nin what strength? By the same token, you need to figure out who isn’t there anymore. \nIf the city used to be a stronghold of the Grim Legion, but most of those soldiers were \nwiped out in one way or another, how are the survivors going to react? Will they \nrecruit desperately, cut deals with former subordinates or try to bluff it out?And how \nwill everyone else, especially those groups who have been waiting for those arrogant \nsonsabitches from the Grim Legion to get cut down to size, react with the newly \ndownsized military presence? Will there be an attempt at compromise until the \nNecropolis is strong enough to stand without every wraith standing shoulder to \nshoulder, or will old hatreds and jealousies boil over? \n"

Has the foxhole mentality of “put ’em through hell together and they’ll \ncome out bestest buddies” taken over for the duration of the crisis, or is each faction \ntaking the opportunity to pounce on weakened rivals? Certainly characters’ Shad- \nows should be taken into account when you’re pondering this question. A society \nliterally fueled by strong feeling is a prime breeding ground for vendettas. Remember \nalso that politics is not strictly a vertical exercise. There’s plenty of side-to-side \nconflict and maneuvering to play with as well. If the group on top is weak, odds are \nthat any ambitious factions are going to work on neutralizing or destroying the \ncompetition before making a play for the brass ring.

Freed fromcharon’s ban, \nthe survivors of various Guilds do come out from under cover as their skills are \ndesperately needed, but lingering suspicion does remain. Five centuries of \npropaganda is a hard thing to overcome. \nNo Mnemoi are sighted after Stygia falls. \nDoomslayers \nMuch reduced in ranks, they’re on the defensive. A great many are \ndestroyed when the Martyr Knight commandery goes up in a cloud of Spectres, \nbut the survivors try desperately to get their orders back together. Few have the \nopportunity to go back into the Labyrinth, so they content themselves with \nputting their knowledge to work defending Necropoli. They are treated with a \nmixture of admiration and undisguised loathing. The former comes from \nwraiths who still see them as daring heroes; the latter comes from those who saw \nwhat their arrogance wrought on Stygia. \nThe Legions \nNot surprisingly, the Legions are greatly reduced in strength. The Deathlords \nare gone, and many Legionnaires have gone to their final reward defending the \nNecropoli or fighting among themselves when the Smiling Lord’s treachery is \nuncovered. Many wraiths have abandoned the Legions for fear of reprisal while \nothers have clung to their identity in the face of potential adversity. All of the \nremaining Legions recruit heavily where they may for obvious reasons. \nRenegades \nRenegades are hard hit, not by the Jade invasion, but rather by the Great \nMaelstrom. Most shelter in Haunts that are not strong enough to withstand the \nstorm winds, and casualties are immense. Many Renegades move into the \nNecropoli, either establishing Renegade governments or trying to blend in with \nthe local citizenry.

That isolation also limits your potential in- \nplay origins for new characters. (If they’re not dying in town, how are they getting \nthere?) By the same token, you’re getting a ready-built plot generator in the form of \nthe Maelstrom winds. Anything from ancient relics to an endless supply of Spectres \ncan be dashed up against the Necropolis walls to provide conflict, antagonists and \nstory hooks. \nJust bear in mind that Great Maelstroms are serious stuff, not to be turned on \nand off at whim. If your players lose their respect for the power of the storm outside \nby being able to cavort in the great unliving outdoors at will, they’re going to lose \nmuch of the flavor of the setting. If, however, you just give them brief breaks in the \nstorm, small windows of opportunity for new arrivals or escapees to appear on the \nscene, then you can keep the tone of Ends of Empire-era Wraith much better. \nAlso, bear in mind that certain Arcanoi - \nArgos leaps to mind, as does the \nDark Arcanos Tempest-Weaving - \nare going to become problematical in a storm- \nbound setting. Think about these and other potential concerns that players may \nhave, especially if their entire character concepts were built around Helldiving or \nconveying souls through the Tempest, and they now find themselves left on the \nsidelines. There’s plenty for everyone to do in the post-apocalyptic Shadowlands. \nThe trick is making sure that people find it. \n"

      "text": "A NFW BRFFD \nOE HUNTFRS \nby Ken Cliffe \nHUNTER: THE R E C K O N I N C ~ M L ~ ~ S M I N D ’ S  \nEYE THEATEE \nThe title Drew much says it all: There’s a new breed of hunters abroad in the World \ntestament to the transformation that has overcome them. \n-\n,\n \nof Darkness. They’re human beings who have suddenly discovered the existence of real- \nlife blood drinkers, wolfmen, wizards, ghosts, zombies and goblins. These people have \nbeen confronted with the realization that humanity is not at the top of the order or even \nin charge of things. They’ve learned the hard way that the lives they’ve always lived have \nbeen lies, spoon-fed to them by monsters intent on keeping humanity blind, deaf and \ndumb. These ordinary-turned-enlightened people now know that they are a subjugated \nrace, mere cattle or playthings in unfathomable supernatural games. \nWith knowledge comes power and with all these revelations, hunters arise as a \nseemingly new force to be reckoned with. They will not stand idly by while family and \nfriends are oppressed or killed. They will not allow people to be dominated by unearthly \nbeings. They will not rest until humanity is free. By strength or will or reason, they will \ninherit the Earth they thought they always had but, in truth, have always been denied. \nHunter: The Reckoning is the latest Storyteller game set in the modem World of \nDarkness. It breaks the mold of previous White Wolf games in that the common man is \nnow empowered to rise up against the forces of darkness that have reigned since the dawn \nof history. Creatures are the antagonists, not the protagonists, of this game. Sure, you’ve \nalways had the opportunity to play mortal humans before, whether with The Hunters \nHunted, The Inquisition or Laws of the Hunt for Mind’s Eye Theatre. However, \nHunter is not a second edition or update of any of those books. The characters of this \ngame are completely new to the World of Darkness. Not that they were born yesterday, \nof course - \nthey’ve always been here among the human masses. Yet cosmologically \nspeaking, they were born yesterday. \nIn recent months, everyday people - \nsteelworkers, temps, teachers, brick layers - \nhave suddenly and shockingly awoken to the fact that monsters lurk in the shadows. \nThese horrifying discoveries always come unexpectedly with no warning other than a \nbizarre sensation such as hearing a voice when no one is around or seeing a street sign \nchange inexplicably from “Walk” to “Run.” In that moment of disorientation, certain \nindividuals find themselves face-to-face with the most hideous things they have ever \nwitnessed - \nwalking abominations, affronts to nature itself. How each person responds \ndepends on her identity, but most endowed with such terrifying clarity act, whether to \nattack the creature, protect oblivious bystanders or to confront the thing to simply \nunderstand it. The fact that such people now wield bizarre powers of various stripes is \n"

      "text": "At the moment of apotheosis, called the “imbuing,” a hunter is created - \na person \nseemingly chosen to witness the truth of the world and empowered by some unknown \nforce to contend with it forever after. Once a person is imbued, she possesses the \ncapability to perceive monsters wherever they hide. Their illusions fade, their disguises \npeel away, their true faces are made manifest. The world is no longer what it was - \nit is \nnow home to nightstalkers, beasts and horrors. \nHow a newly imbued hunter deals with all this information is, as before, based on \nher identity: on her will to remain sane, her capacity to accept what she learns and her \nability to acknowledge that her world is not the real one. Many go mad. Others kill \nthemselves rather than face facts. A determined few piece together their new existence \nand set out to do something about it. These last are the source of Hunter: The \nReckoning. \nHowever, these kinds of people can also belong to your Mind’s Eye Theatre games. \nThe imbued offer an excellent change of pace -and surprise -for a new or ongoing live- \naction chronicle. Imagine a chapter in which various players are assigned the roles of \nmortals. Players portraying anything from vampires to changelings must interact among \nand around the usual “cattle.” Nothing new. In fact, it’s just what the Supernatural are \naccustomed to after ages of practice. Now imagine that, without warning, a handful of \nthose mortals suddenly “wake up” - \nthey see vampires hidden in shadows, they stand \ndefiant against Garou in Crinos form, they look straight into the eye of the restless dead, \nor they pierce directly through to changelings’ fae mien. Not only that, these people, the \nscales tom from their eyes, have powers never seen before. And whether directed by an \nunseen hand, granted divine grace or invested with instinctive understanding, these \nmortals know how to use their newfound capabilities to deadly effect. That’s when the \nshit really hits the fan. \nWhat becomes of these imbued people and the creatures they oppose is ultimately \nup to you and your troupe. Would-be hunters might be decimated. Monsters may be slain. \nIt all depends on the kinds of characters who participate in your ongoing game. However, \nin the long run, a new kind of protagonist is introduced to live-action roleplaying. This \nkind of human might be intent on destroying all creatures and delivering the fate of any \nsupernatural who fails to cover his tracks carefully. Or an imbued could be sympathetic \nto monsters, suspecting that they might have been human once and could be again; it’s \njust a matter of bringing the creatures back over from the other side. Either way, players \nof vampires or werewolves are forced to be wary, either to stay alert for fear of unprovoked \nattack from a once-docile humanity, or for fear of being confronted with memories or \nthoughts of a life left behind long ago when days were still numbered or the mundane \nworld was reality. \nMind’s Eye is also an ideal tool with which to depict the development of a hunter. \nThe days and weeks following her change are torment for one of the imbued. These \ncharacters witness monsters everywhere - \non the street, at work, at church, even in the \nhome. The worst part is that no one else sees these things, nor do they understand what \nyour character is talking about. Is she cracking up? Has she gone mad? Suspicious co- \nworkers look at her askance. Loved ones grow distant. Trying to explain what your \ncharacter sees and knows just drives everyone away - \nand maybe, just maybe, your \nfriends and family avoid you because they are not human! \nRoleplaying this isolation and decline offers amazing dramatic opportunities. \nImagine a seemingly crazed person making “random” appearances in an otherwise normal \nMasquerade game. Is she a newly sired Malkavian, perhaps? Clearly not when the \n"

      "text": "“madwoman” reappears in the next chapter, now reconciled with reality and prepared to \ncontend with the beings she has seen over and over and finally understands. \nConfronting solo imbued in your live-action game is just one option. Although \nhunters have powers and the ability to see the supernatural, they are still mortal, and they \ncan be killed - \nespecially solitary ones. Consider this: Questioning their own sanity, the \nrecently imbued turn to friends and loved ones, perhaps even the police to tell their story. \nTheir responses are shock, pity and maybe even more trouble, such as incarceration “for \ntheir own good.” The rest of humanity just doesn’t understand. \nSo who do you, witness to monstrosities and endowed with unfathomable capabili- \nties, turn to? Some find solace among the others at the scene of the change, the other \n“ordinary people” who saw that first creature and wielded amazing power, too. Maybe \nthey will understand. \nWhether you return to the scene of the crime in hopes of finding the others, go \nonline in search of people like you or simply search the city for your “companions.” you \nmight eventually discover fellow imbued. The result is typically a group of hunters: people \nwho initially seek reassurance that they’re sane but who suddenly realize that they must \nstick together. After all, if they’re not insane, the world must be. \nImagine agroup ofplayers with mortal characters who are imbued in one live-action \nevent. Then, two or three sessions later, they return, this time unified, trained in their \ncapabilities and with a potentially extreme prejudice against the creatures of the night. \nBy introducing this element, Hunter: The Reckoning can make for a significant \naddition to your live-action roleplaying experiences. The game allows you to expand \nbeyond the possibilities of mortal characters. It also lets you change the terms by which \nsupernatural characters play. Not all mortals are mere pawns and food anymore. Some \ncan turn and fight back - \nwith amazing powers. \nOf course, Hunter only exists in tabletop format. However, its setting is the same \nas that of all the other Storyteller games, Mind’s Eye included. Thus, you can always \nadapt Hunter’s unique rules and powers over for use in your live-action games, and presto: \na whole new kind of character to stalk the night. Then again, it might only be a matter \nof time before official live-action rules for the imbued come to light.. .. \nFor now, consider translating Hunter characters as introducing a new kind oflive- \naction experience. The imbued are the common people faced with the brutal extremity \nof the World of Darkness. That’s the real fun of the game. They’re not secret agents or \nmembers of some occult secret society. They’re regular Toes and Janes thrust into \nsituations way beyond their comprehension. When was the last time your live-action \ntroupe had fun playing regular people? \n"

For those of you who are new to the publication, let me take a second \nto acquaint you with just what you’ve got here. (For those who’ve read this \nbefore, you may skip ahead to “Deadguy Speaks” on the next page.) \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gaps in \nyour White Wolf LARP environment. We offer rules for new character types, \noriginal storylines to work into your chronicles, guides for keeping your games \nunder control and running smoothly and rules updates you won’t find in any \nother Mind’s Eye release. Plus, you’ll find answers to the questions that have \nplagued you, original World of Darkness fiction and columns from people \nwho’ve been LARPing or working here at White Wolf (or both) for years. \nIn this issue, we take a look at the wraiths of the Yellow Springs, the \nimplications of Hunter: The Reckoning for your Mind’s Eye chronicles and \na short treatise on live-action mages from the Mage developer himself. And \nthat’s just a sample ofwhat’s in store for you here. We’ll also take a look at what \nyou’ve missed in previous issues (if you’re joining us late) and what to expect \nin the future of Mind’s Eye Theatre and White Wolf in general. \nIn future issues of the Journal, we’ll present an entirely new LARP \nadventure, a look back through history at some historical expansions to our \nmost popular games, a look ahead at a possible future of the World of Darkness \nand more MET rules conversions. \nAnd you can help make the Journal even better. Send us letters on your \nopinions about the state of live-action roleplaying today. Send us questions \nabout the features and rules you see here, as well as notes about the broken rules \nyou come across in different MET publications. Send us horror stories about \ngames gone wrong and how your player characters fixed them. We’re inter- \nested in all aspects of live-action roleplaying, and we want to know what you \nthink. \nStick around. The Journal is on the cutting edge of the live-action genre; \nwe’ve got something for everybody. And if we don’t have it yet, let us know. \nWe’ll get it for you. \nCurl Bowen \nDeveloper \ncurl@white-wolf. corn \nWhite Wolf \nAttn: Mind’s Eye Theutre Journal Developer \n735 Park North Blvd, Suite 128 \nChrkston, GA 30021 \nUSA \n\n\nDFADCjUY SPFAKS \nHowever, Dame Fortune smiles Onme, and this column \nwill continue to showcase Rich’s unique insight, h \nhis observutions on life in general and his view \ndzvelopment of Mind’s Eye Theatre, though \nlanner be directly in the middle of the action \nA C~REAT ONUS I S  PLACED \nUPONTHEE \nThis one’s going to be a little different, folks. Bear with me. I’m sitting here, not too \nlong after the Columbine High Schoolshootings, pondering what it is that we do that makes \nus such easy targets for scapegoating in the wake of tragedy. More importantly, I have to ask \nwhat we - \nyou and I - \ncan do about it. \n(Author’s note: I have nothing but sorrow for the families, friends and classmates of the \nchildren cut down in Columbine. My mother works in amiddle school, and every time I hear \nabout another outrage in a public school somewhere, my first irrational thought is to call \nand make sure that she’s all right. Nothing I say here is intended to diminish the shock and \nhorror of incidents like that at Columbine, even now, when so much time has passed.) \nHere’s a revelation for you: America does not necessarily like live-action roleplaying. \nIt does not necessarily like people who pretend to be vampires or werewolves cavorting \naround the local coffeehouse or state park and frightening the paying customers with vicious \nrounds of Rock-Paper-Scissors. A hundred thousand people will cram themselves into a \nconcrete toilet bowl with tiny seats on a weekend afternoon, painting team logos on their \nwell-developed beer bellies and screaming for someone to rip a quarterback‘s or referee’s \nhead off, but it’s those weirdoes who skulk around in black and quote Shelley that people \nthink you have to watch out for. \nIn other words, depending upon how understanding your local community is, it can \nreally, really suck to be an MET player. \nThat’s just the way it is, at least at the moment. You and I know it, and one of the \nfavorite conversational topics that comes up whenever players of MET get together (besides \ndiscussing characters, making fun of those idiots at White Wolf who clearly don’t know \nwhat they’re doing and comparing prices on fake fangs) is the fact that the world just doesn’t \nlike LARPers. It’s a sad state of affairs, yes, but something about it nags at me. LARPing may \nnot be loved by all walks of life, but at the same time, that does not excuse the self-martyred \n“woe betide us for having an unpopular hobby” attitude that seems to exist in certain \nquarters. Yes, there are places where MET games get it hard. Believe me, all the stories come \nback to us here at the office sooner or later, and we do what we can to help. But there are \nother places where a little effort on the part of players and Storytellers, a little willingness \nto teach and explain rather than an insistence on feeling persecuted, can do a world of good. \nSo let’s talk about responsibility here. \nSpecifically, let’s talk about yours. \n\n\nintrinsically that LARPing is a friendly social activity that is enjoyable for a great many \npeople, and not some sort of weird pseudo-mystical immersion in the nether realms of the \nhuman psyche. If life were fair, you wouldn’t have to explain to your folks or your faculty \nadvisor that it’s just a costume and you don’t really think that you’re Mircea the Ravenous, \nTzimisce Overlord of the Borgo Pass. They would just get it, wish you good luck storming \nthe castle and - \nif you were really lucky -comment \non the nice trim you’d added to your \ncloak since the last game. \nBut life’s not fair. You know that, I know that, and the rest of the world knows that. \nLike it or not, our hobby is simply not something that much of “mainstream” society gets. \nIt requires leaps of faith. It requires suspension of disbelief. It requires spending time as \nsomeone else, and, on occasion, it requires saying funny words and wearing funny clothes. \nNone of these things are necessarily intuitive to perfectly nice folks whose idea of a game \nis building hotels on Baltic Avenue before someone else beats them to Free Parking. Sad as \nit may be, you simply cannot rely on the goodwill of the universe to make people understand \nthat Mind’s Eye Theatre, or any type of roleplaying, is nothing more or less than a game. \n(Time for a sidebar rant here: One of the most frequent complaints I get when I hear \nfrom people whose parents or teachers or store owners or whatever have shut down their \nLARPs is that whoever is doing the shutting down is “wrong.” Well, duh. Of course they’re \nwrong. It is just a game, nothing more and nothing less, even if they’re convinced it’s going \nto turn you into Sabrina the Teenaged Witch. However - \nand this is the part that matters \n-it \ndoes not matter one teeny little bit that they are wrong, as long as they’re the ones holding \nthe big stick. Being right and a buck will get you a small cup of lousy cappuccino these days. \nAs long as the folks with the power think they’re right, it doesn’t matter what the facts of the \ncase actually are. That’s the way it is, pure and simple. \nYeah, they’re wrong, but you know what: They could think that LARPing promotes \nwatching the Teletubbies and joining the alien conspiracy at Roswell, and your game would \nstill get shut down because They Have the Big Stick. Again, I state that it is categorically, \nunmitigatedly, unabashedly unfair. But that’s just too bad. It was unfair that Belgian \nneutrality got violated in 1914 too, but the universe doesn’t much care about fair. All you \ncan do is try to make the unfairness of it all work in your favor - \nor at least work against \nyou less emphatically. The more time you spend kvetching about life being unfair, the less \nyou’re going to get done. It’s that simple.) \nAll of this brings us back to the most important person in the whole equation: You. \nYou have to make a difference, one person at a time. You have to take a moment and \nsit down with your parents to explain what you’re doing and why it’s just a game. They’re \nyour parents. Odds are they’re not irretrievably evil. Odds are that if they’ve expressed \ndisapproval over that game you’re playing, it’s because they’re worried about you. They may \nnot be doing the world’s greatest job of expressing that concern in a palatable or even open- \nminded way, but it’s there, nonetheless. Remember, also, where their information is coming \nfrom. The treatment of roleplaying in the traditional media has been, to be blunt, anywhere \nfrom mildly to wildly inaccurate on many occasions. However, your folks don’t know that. \nThey just know that it says right there, in black and white, in the Upper Herkimer Herald- \nDemocrat-Observer-Picayune that an occult expert from Sheboygan, Michigan, has decided \nthat your game is naughty and evil, and it must be that you’re “immersed in the occult” - \nwhatever that means. Personally, I’ve always resisted being immersed in the occult because \nA) the stains are hard to get out of mv boxers, and B) I’m actuallv a former vouth group \n\n\nOn a more serious note, I know that you don’t have to immerse yourself in the occult \nto play Masquerade. You know that you don’t need to immerse yourself in the occult to play \nMasquerade. God help anyone who tries to claim that there’s something Satanic about \ninvoking the images of rock, paper and scissors, because, if you ask me, that’s the final twist \nof the loosest of all possible screws. But that occult expert out there (and how does one make \na career out of being an occult expert, anyway? It doesn’t strike me as the sort of thing one \nputs on a rtsumt) is sure that the game does mandate such goofiness, and the harried reporter \nlooking for a quote from an expert may not know any better. The quote gets printed, sitting \nthere in black and white for all the world to see. And because that information is there in \nthe paper - \nand they wouldn’t print it in the paper if it weren’t true - \nthat’s where your \nfolks’ idea of your hobby may well be coming from. \n(An aside: The newspaper ain’t always right. That little “corrections” item they tuck \naway where it’s hard to find is there for a reason - \nand that’s just the stuff someone caught \nand yelled about. You might want to bear that in mind. Just because it’s in agate type on a \npiece of a dead tree doesn’t mean it’s gospel. After all, this got printed too, didn’t it?) \nWhat all that means, however, is that there’s a window of opportunity here for you to \neducate your folks - \nand by extension, your teachers, professors, faculty advisors and so on. \nShow them the books up close and personal so that they read the big words that say “No \ntouching,” “No running,” “No drinking” and “It’s only a game.” You may even want to think \nabout running a little demo, showing off a staged scene complete with challenges. Let’s face \nit, it’s kind of hard for anyone with any common sense to work themselves into a self- \nrighteous frenzy over even the most heated exchange of R-P-S. If you really want to push \nyour luck, you can even sell it as a vocabulary-building exercise. After all, who uses the words \n“brawny” or “lithe” in their daily conversation? Come to think of it, how many of your \nfriends knew what “obfuscate” meant before 1991? \nIs this sort of common-sense approach going to work every time? Of course not. Some \nfolks don’t want to be convinced. Some folks would rather rant and rave than face honest, \nsimple facts. There’s nothing you can do about them. However, the vast majority of \nconcerned parents, teachers and so on ate concerned because they’ve been told they should \nbe concerned. Show them and tell them differently, and you may see some remarkable \nresults. \nNow think about your community, be it a college campus, a town or a city. A basic fact \nof Mind’s Eye Theatre play is that you need space and lots of it. You need comers to plot \nin, shadows to hide in, coat rooms to cut deals in - \nwhatever. You need room, and by \nspreading out your contingent of players over a lot of room, you increase your chances of \nhaving your players bump into someone who isn’t playing. When that happens, those who \naren’t playing may well be curious as to why that guy over in the comer (you know, the one \nplaying the Nosferatu) has Rice Krispies and Karo syrup all over his face. \nSo is this a crisis or an opportunity? Well, if Gordo the Nosferatu decides to drip \nbreakfast cereal all over the innocent bystanders, yeah, you just might get some negative \nfeedback here. But if you take a minute and explain what you’re doing - \nand it’s always a \ngood idea to talk with all of your players before starting the game about what to say if asked \nabout what’s going on - \nyou can go a long way toward building some goodwill and maybe \neven recruiting a new player or two. It’s just common sense, after all. No matter how \nalienated or antisocial your character might be, bringing that attitude into discussions with \nfolks who don’t know diddly about what you’re doing is a great way to make them antisocial \ntoward you. And believe it or not, there are a lot more of them out there than there are of \nyou. Social Traits don’t matter too much when you get tossed off site for trespassing or told \nby Public Safety to bust it up because you’re freaking the mundanes. \n\n\nIn a broader sense, it behooves you to let the community around where you’re playing \nknow what you’re doing ahead of time. Call the local police station and explain that there’s \na game happening there. Take the time to reassure them that there’s no touching or actual \ncombat. That way, when the Hitchcock refugee of a paranoid neighbor calls down to the \nprecinct in a panic over the black-clad hooligans running wild in the streets, the gendarmes \nalready know its you (and that you’re harmless). If you’re going to be meeting at a coffee \nhouse, let the proprietor know that there are 30 vampires coming, and encourage your \nplayers to patronize the shop while they’re there. Thirty vampire players wandering in and \ndrinking lots of coffee once a week is a stable customer base; 30 vampire players wandering \nin and taking up tables without buying anything is great way to shut that coffeehouse down. \nAnd if you are so classless as to bring your food or drink from elsewhere into an \nestablishment dedicated to serving the same, I’ll personally hold you down long enough for \nthe proprietor to kick your ass. Commoncourtesy is not optional. I know of at least one group \nthat lost its space because some chuckleheads decided that they’d bring McDonalds Happy \nMeals to the site - \nwhich happened to be a cafe that sewed dinner. The phrase “dumber \nthan a sack of sand” does not begin to do justice to this sort of nonsense. If you can’t afford \nthe coffee-house prices, at least have the basic decency to eat your McThing McOutside or \nbefore you get to the McGame. Either that, or get ready to volunteer your basement. \nNo, you don’t have a constitutional right to obstruct commercial floor space, so be \nconsiderate. Recognize that your game does impact the community around you, even in \nsmall ways, and try to make that impact positive. That way, if some yobbo writes a nasty \neditorial about those darn vampires, your local coffeehouse owner sees the call to shut down \nthe game as the potential loss of 30 of his best (and hopefully best-behaved) customers. \nThree guesses which way he’ll hop in response. Profit motive outweighs fear of a black cloak \nevery time. \nBy the same token, think about what your game can give to the local community to \ndemonstrate tangibly that you’re not a bunch of bloodsucking freaks: blood drives, cleaning \nup parks and stretches of local highways, food drives, adopting local families at holiday \ntime.. . . You get the idea. None of these things is terribly difficult to arrange; there are dozens \nof charities out there in place who will be glad for a few more hands (even pale, tremulous \nhands with black-painted fingernails. Honest). Furthermore, the sight of a bunch of \n“vampires” doing a blood drive is often the sort of thing that’s irresistible to local news \nmedia. It makes for a great visual, allows the writers to haul out the one-liners they generally \nget to use only at Halloween, and most importantly, it shows your troupe off to the \ncommunity in a positive tight. Just make sure that it’s not the guy with Rice Krispies glued \nto his face who gets interviewed by the cub reporter - \nand definitely not the guy who thinks \nit will be fun to play a Malkavian and calls himself “Count Fruitbatula.” He might think it’s \nfunny to do his little tribute to Gene Simmons on camera, but remember, that’s the image \nthat everyone in your local viewing area is going to have of you and your troupe. It often \nmakes life easier if the entire world doesn’t think you’re a tongue-flapping drool spigot who \ngets his ya-yas licking a camera lens. Instead, you’ve got a perfect opportunity to be well- \nspoken and interesting for the public, even if it’s a virtual certainty that whatever you say \nwill be reduced to anine-second sound bite. Do be careful with what you say; don’t bog down \nin detail or get esoteric because there’s always the chance that something you say could be \ntaken out of context. It’s sad but true. On the other hand, you can look at it this way: Those \nnine seconds will help you reach a lot more potential new players all at once than any flyer \nin a game store ever could. A lot of groups even have a designated individual who gets \npropped up out front every time the media comes calling. This tactic might not be a bad idea \nif you’ve got someone particularly eloquent on hand. \n\n\njackhammer manicure. If it happens, there isn’t a lot you can do about it. Take some time \noff until the furor cools down and use that time to plot a truly kick-ass game. Find someplace \nquieter to play. Find a good convention nearby with a LARP and get your fix there. Swap \nto live-action Changeling and tell everyone you’re doing Shakespeare. But don’t yell and \nscream for the sake of yelling and screaming; it won’t make matters easier down the road. \nJust find out who your real allies and enemies are and plot your comeback - \npreferably in \naccordance with what’s already been discussed here. \nIn the end, it’s not fair. It’s something else that both you and I know. But just because \nit’s not fair doesn’t mean you can’t do anything about it. It’s worth the effort to diminish the \nchances of having your game or your participation in your game ended. It’s worth the effort \nto get out there and teach people about the good points of what you’re doing because the \nmore of that you do, the less time you spend wondering when the hammer’s going to fall. \nAnd the less time you spend wondering about that, the less time you have to spend \nexplaining to the umpteenth reporter or concerned parent that no, you really don’t drink \nblood or think you’re the immortal spawn of darkness, the better your game is going to be. \nIn the end, isn’t that what it’s really all about? \n\n\nTHF CURRFNT \nTHINKINCj \nAh, the old’s falling by the wayside all Over the place in this issue of the \nJournal. In this feature, I’ve combined the letters to the develoger and \n“Frequently Asked Questions’’ into one vozhd-like mass dedicated to what’s on \nthe minds of today’s MET players. The ideas and opinions herein expressed are \nin no way those of the management or intended to represent an overview of the \nopinions of those who play Mind’s Eye Theatre games, unkss you find them \nparticularly witty and worth taking to heart. Otherwise, the writers (some of \nwhom appeared on the Forum section of White Wolfs website) are compktely \non their own. \n~ \n~ \n~ \n~~~~ \nA discussion started on the White Wolf website some months ago about the \nviability of mixed LARPs (i.e., games in which character types from various \nindependent game lines participate in the same story). Considering that different \nthemes, moods and ideologies apply to each individual White Wolf game, how easily \ncould characters representing those themes (etc.) be meshed into one game? The \noriginal poster received a plethora of advice (some good, some decidedly not), and \nsince this topic is one that recurs in Mind’s Eye Theatre play (and will continue to \ndo so throughout this game line’s long future), I decided to reprint some of the best \n(and worst) responses. This first letter, though sloppy in presentation, is well- \nintentioned in meaning. \nWe have had a problem running an independent LARP with many people \nwanting to play many different things. First things first. \nNumina: Certain numina are so rare that you have to use common sense. How \nmany people in your LARP will have Telepyrokinesis, or Telepathy? \nGarou: Make sure the players of the Garourealize their characters either work with \nor against the vampires. In our game, our area is heavily BSD-dominated. The Garou \nknow their life span is that of a zit. They have to work with vamps or against them. We \nallow players to play other werecreatures according to rarity. It is perfectly fine for one \nGurhal to appear in West Virginia. However, 10 Bastet in one town in West Virginia \nis not good. \nMages: Don’t touch them, they just cause problems. Just say no. Mummies: There \nare 47 in the world. How many of them are likely to come to your town? \nRisen: Don’t touch this one with a 20-foot pole unless you want a walking battle \ntank. \nRemember, the Storyteller’s best friend is the ability to say, “NO.” \n-Nurain \n(nurain@hotmail.com) \n\n\nUnless the Storyteller hooks you up with an interesting and somewhat logical plot \n-moth \nline, I still can’t understand the reasoning behind your role. \nWhile this next guy is no Baz Lerman (remember him?), he does make some \ninteresting points. However, apply salt-grains liberally when reading. \nI’ve been playing Garou for quite a few years and I’ve been there, I can feel your \npain. Come to think of that, I’m in the same boat. My Garou characters are constantly \nsurrounded by vampires. The best advice I can offer is simple: Read Your hws! There \nare many, many, many neat little tricks Garou can pull to save their necks if they get \nin trouble, which are provided in Laws of the Wild. The rest of these tips are ones I’ve \nfound that can really swing the balance in you favor. \n-Avoid your Crinos form; it scares the hell out of vampires. They will attack you \nif you use it openly. Stay in Homid; it’s less threating. \n- \nGangrel can be your best buddies, and they’re not Wyrtn-tainted. Bonus! Get \non speaking terms with them. \n- \nIf you are crafty and discreet, you can masquerade as a vampire (Gangrel are \nbest). A Trait or two of Meditation could conceivably let you lower you heart rate and \nthe temp in you hands, for instance. \n-You \ncan enter the Umbra from any reflective surface, even the reflection in a \nperson’s eyes (it says so in LotW). Don’t forget a Gnosis Trait will get you into the \nUmbra without a test. Which is to say: If you have to, run. \n-Spirits are you friend! Summon them properly, and they’ll help you do various \nthings (dependent on the spirit type). Awaken them and they’re even more useful. Even \nif you kill them, they can serve as an instant Gnosis-battery! \n- \nUse Gifts creatively. Take Create Element for example. You can create a fire \nwith thisGift thenmake it biggerbyaddingair.Orbetteryet,encase thatpesky Brujah‘s \nhead in a block of stone as you make good your next action. Sure, he’ll pummel himself \nfree eventually, but it’ll buy you some well-deserved time. Other good Gifts of note: Jam \nTechnology, Clap of Thunder, Control Simple Machine, Sense Wyrm, Truth of Gaia, \nPersuasion, Luna’s Armor, Cyber-senses, Scent of Sweet Honey, The Fulling Touch, \nParalyzing Stare and Scent of Sight. \n-Thatbringsme \nto thenextbit offun:TheUmbra.UseIt!!!!! ScrewBlurofthe \nMilky Eye and that stuff. You can peek out of the Umbra with a Simple Test against half \nthe Gauntlet. And the best part is that damn near all vampires can’t see you. \n- \nOne claw, two claw, three claw, four, plus your teeth. Each appendage does \naggravated damage. \n-Get \na Totem!!!!!!! I can’t stress this enough. Having a pack helps as well. \n- \nYes you are a savage beast full of Rage, but acting like one will only get 20 or \nso vampires hunting you for your hide. Be cool, calm and collected. Yes kindred are of \nthe Wyrm, and they must be destroyed to save Gaia, but it would be much better if you \ncould live to see that day. Besides, you loose Renown for stupid acts of bravery, unless \nyou play a Get of Fenris. \n- \nDon’t play Get of Fenris. \n- \nManipulate. \n\n\nI am speaking now to the people who understand improvisational acting, mood, \ntone and texture; those who are allergic to rocks, paper and scissors. Sick of the twinks \nin your game? Sick of the hour-long time freezes while a pack of wannabe-goth boys tries \nto affirm its manhood by playing a child’s game? Tired of being the only one with \nsomething to say that isn’t “I’m Brutal enough to blah blah blah...”? Do you often find \nyourself wondering where your game went wrong? Know the answer? \nIt’s the twinks. They suck. You know they suck. Everyone else knows they suck ... \nbut they have the biggest gun-bunny characters around .... What do you do? Well, leave \nit to Zhavric to come up with the answer. \nBuy them a copy of Aberrant. \nWhite Wolfs first venture into the world of the superhero and superpowers was \nnot meant to be the Brujah Elder. It is here and it is now in this new book. Round up \nall your twinks when they show up, force them into a room, lock it and slide a copy of \nthis book under the door. Let them get all that Mega-nonsense out of their system over \na tabletop, and maybe -just maybe -they will get bored of playing characters that \ncan juggle tanks. Maybe they will figure out that there is more to live-action gaming \nthan number-crunching. \nIf they don’t figure it out, leave them there. \n-Zhavric \n(zhavric@hotmail.com) \nOkay, so even all-knowing Zhavric has ably demonstrated his capacity to miss \nthe point behind the Aberrant game, but his point about live-action gaming is solid. \nI’m going to switch to a different font here for a minute and throw my own editorial \ninto the ring. \nThere exists in live-action gaming (in all roleplaying, really) a dichotomy between \nthose who play for the stories, themes and moods inherent in the game, and those who \nplay because being the biggest, baddest [insert fruity character concept here] you can \nbe isahellofalotoffun.AnyWhiteWo1fgame (especially in the live-actionline) lends \nitself to just that sort of dichotomy quite easily. In fact, some would say that that \ndichotomy is just what makes these games so popular in the first place. \nHowever, having both types of players in a game (unless the game is exceedingly \nwell-populated) is going to result in players from one camp getting in the way of (and \nlargely pissing off) the players from the other camp. It just happens; it’s the way of \ngaming life. Thus the proposition of giving both factions what they want is the best way \nto go about solving a lot of the friction that crops up between live-action players. \nDoes your game have a significant contingent of players who just like to build \nindestructible doom-bots and overtake their enemies with effusive protestations of how \nBrutal, Dexterous, Ferocious or Vigurous they are? If so, get them together and work with \nthem to give them the kind of plots they want. Throw slavering packs of Sabbat, Black \nSpiral Dancers, Unseelie redcaps (or whatever) at them, and let them do what they do \nbest. If they have fun because you’ve made the “plot” for the evening engaging, you’re \ndoing your job. \nAre you instead beset by tragically hip gothic youths who want to explore the \nboundaries of their fabricated [characters’] personalities, face moral dilemmas and use \ntheir brains to solve a conflict rather than relying on how many times they thought to \nwritedown theRobwt Trait atcharactercreation?Youfindsomeofthemineverygame, \n\n\nand if you don’t want to lose them (or have your game unravel because that’s all there \nare), you have to account for them in your plots as well. Give them clues to process and \nmysteries to solve. Give them the work of cleaning up the messes caused by the clashes \nof the Stalwart hordes. Give them a reason to glower imperiously from the battlements \nas the others duke it out, but keep them involved. \nBy working with both factions of the LARP crowd, you (as a player, Narrator or \nStoryteller) create a more well-rounded game that caters to all of your players instead \nof creating cliques among them. \nAs for what to do when you’ve tried to work with your players, Narrators and \nStorytellers to no avail (maybe no one’s listening, or no one understands what you have \nto say), don’t be discouraged. Sometimes the best you can do is to lead by example. \nCreate a character who interacts with (and has interests that take into account) the \ncharacters of both “real roleplayers” and “twinks.” Get involved with (or try to create) \nplots for both types of player. Talk to fellow players after game sessions about what you \nliked and disliked about the game, then bring up the topic with the staff once some \ndowntime has passed. \nJust be aware that sometimes, no matter how reasonable you are, some games do \nbegin that slow spiral into oblivion. If you’ve done all you can to save it or re-acclimate \nyourself to it, yet nothing helps, there’s no shame in finding a new game more suited \nto your style of play. Just make sure you’ve done all you can. \nAnd that’s all I’ve got to say about that. This last bit is a more specific form of \nQ&A which has flooded us since the release of h w s  of the Night’s revised edition \nhit the shelves. \nQuestion: Aaaaarrrrrrrgh!! Where are the character sheets for this book!?!? \nAnswer: Fear not, you can find said character sheet right here in the back of your \nfaithful Journal. We’ll reprint it in the next few issues as well, just to make sure nobody’s \nleft out. \nE U R T H E B  EUBL \nLet me hear from you! \nYou can e-mail your answers to these points, questions that repeatedly \nplague yourgames, or your opinions on subjects of your choosingm carl@white- \nwolf.com or mail them to: \nWhite Wolf Publishing Inc. \nAtm: Mind’s Eye Theatre Journal \n735 Park North Blvd. \nSuite 128 \nClarkston, GA 30021 \nYou can also post new threads for discussion to the MET forum on our \nwebsite (http://www.white-Wolf.com,) \n. \n\n\nKWBIF BOOT CAMP \nby James Stewart \n$is f m r  \nwhite wolf intern-tumd-employee has heardull the jokes about \nNS name mat there can possibly be - \nhe didn’t ewen blink when I told him 1 wanted \nto name this artick “Mister Smith Goes LARPing” - \nbut despite the abuse, he still \nagreed to this ratherpeculiar assignment.

Alfred Prufroclc” \nLike all first times, my first LARP experience was special and scary. I can say proudly \nthat I survived and even had fun, but I wasn’t really sure what to expect. So, for those \nabout to make their first appearance on the MET scene and the established troupes that \nmust absorb these new players, here’s a brief survival guide to help you through that first \nnight. \nThe most important thing to remember is that, during the game, a lot of real-world \ninteraction goes on that has little to do with the invented reality of the characters. \nInvented personas don’t always relate to each other on their own terms; the player - \nthe \npuppeteer pulling the character’s strings - \nis never too far away. People who crave the \nspotlight push their characters to the center of the stage. Friends in real life tend to be \nfriends in the game. \nWhile this camaraderie might not always be true to the spirit of the game, it’s \nunavoidable and largely appropriate. After all, the characters and their imaginary world \nexist so that real players can have fun. But when new faces appear in the crowd, an \nattitude arises which is equally true in both the game and real life: Strangers are unknown \nquantities. Will this new character prove a threat? Will this new player screw up our \ngame? \nConfronting this attitude might make you feel left out, but fear not. There are some \nthings you can do to prepare yourself. \nPBE- \nQAME STFIATE~Y \nFirst, expectations: If you’re already familiar with the tabletop version of the game \nyou’re about to play, realize that the live-action version’s a little different. While tabletop \ngames move along with one major plot and a few subplots, LARPs are collections of \nsubplots with the larger plot proceeding somewhere in the background. Mind’s Eye \nTheatre is often compared to community theater or theatrical improvisation, but it’s \nmore like a costume party. Don’t anticipate a more intensive tabletop experience. While \n\n\nthe tabletop versions of the White Wolf games certainly emphasize character-develop- \nment, characters are everything in MET. Rather than acting out a plot in which \ncharacters respond to external situations that are the sole purview and domain of the \nStoryteller, LARP characters respond to each other, each with his or her own agenda. \nThis interaction creates story threads that thrust some characters together while \nexcluding others completely. Getting involved with LARP plots takes a proactive \ncommitment on the part of the players, whereas plots are all but spoon-fed to tabletop \ncharacters. \nWith that in mind, design your first character as a social being. While your character \ndoesn’t have to be a complete conformist or even an especially nice person, misanthropes \nwho glare at the room in silent judgement and introverts afraid of everyone present are \nbad choices. That is, of course, unless your idea of a good time is leaning against a wall \nand not talking to anyone. At the same time, if you create a character who’s too aggressive \nor generally obnoxious, you’ll be keeping the wallflowers company on the sidelines as \nwell. \nCreate an individual capable of conversation. Since most MET play involves \ntalking to other characters, invent someone up to the task and remember that a good \ncharacter is a person who wants something. Give him some goals and reasons to interact \nwith others. If you’re in a Masquerade game, for example, you’ll probably start out as a \nneonate newly created or new to town, and your character must seek out potential allies \nif she hopes to survive. \nwhile you can come up with your character’s background and personality without \na rulebook, do get your hands on the rules a few days before the game is scheduled, if it’s \nat all possible, in order to build your character. If you can’t get the rules beforehand, show \nup for the game a little early. Any open LARP worth its salt will have someone available \nto walk you through the character-creation process. That’s the most complicated part of \nthe game by far - \nthe basic rules (apart from character creation) can be explained in five \nminutes. You’ll need your own copy of the rules eventually, but for the first night, \nconcentrate on making the best character (the most real person) you can. \nFinally, exploit the connections you have with other players. If you have friends \nalready involved with the game, make your character’s background somehow involve \ntheir characters so you’ll have some reason to hang close to them when you’re not makmg \nmuch progress with others. If you’re joining a game without knowing any of the other \nplayers, make sure you at least introduce yourself to the Storyteller over e-mail or on the \nphone. Make sure he knows you’re coming and that you’ve never LARPed before. Ask \nhim about the general mood of the game and how best to get involved with existing plot \nlines. Most Storytellers are friendly people who have plenty of experience with introduc- \ning new people to existing troupes. Plus, most Storytellers love it when new people \nexpress interest in their games, and they can be persuaded to answer questions and \ndescribe the themes and mood of the game with little effort. \nWHATTODO \nD U B I N ~ T H E  \nEIBST *ME \nThe game will begin and here’s what it will look like: A bunch of people will be \nstanding around, some in fairly elaborate costume, talking to each other. Don’t panic- \nmost of these folks are approachable. While it might be rude to slither up to a \nconversation and begin eavesdropping, keep in mind that your character is new and \nintroductions are appropriate. Have answers ready for questions about who you are, where \nyou’re from, and what you’re doing here. Who should you talk to first? In most LARPs, \n\n\nthere’s an established hierarchy. Ask around, then seek out whomever you’re account- \nable to - \nyour primogen, a local noble, a ranking Legionnaire or whatever. \nThe important thing is to be bold. Where angels fear to tread, you must leap. Most \nLARPs are populated by cliques that tend to stick together, so expect to feel a little \nexcluded at first. Don’t count on anyone to hold your hand or lead you through the \nevening. Get out there and interact. Otherwise, expect a long, dull night. \nAt the same time, don’t find one person who will tolerate your presence and cling \nto him or her for the entire night. For your first game, get out there and try to meet as many \npeople as you can. Don’t monopolize another’s time. If your character isn’t exactly asocial \nbutterfly, ask ”ut-of-character to be introduced to a few people. Of course, there are \nalways two safe bets for conversation: those who are like you (your clan, guild, kith, tribe \netc.) and those who are standing alone, wishing they had your courage to go out and \nmingle. Befriending other new characters often makes good sense, especially in intrigue- \noriented games. While individual new characters have little power, a gang of neonates \nor cubs is sure to frighten the establishment. Even better, it gives you a “home base,” a \ngroup to talk with during lulls in the action. \nAs the game progresses, you’ll probably see people doing strange things with their \nhands. Don’t panic. These gesturesusually mean the character is using some supernatural \npower that the player is incapable of producing. In Blackened Hearth (an Atlanta \nCamarilla chapter LARP, on which I cut my newbie teeth), for instance, crossing your \narms over your chest means that your character is obfuscated (that is, using the vampiric \npower of invisibility). Pointing at your eyes means you’re using Ampex (a supernatural \nheightening of the senses). These gestures vary from LARP to LARP, and not all of them \nsignify the use of powers. Ask someone before the game how to signify that you’re out- \nof-character (like when you’re looking for a bathroom or having asnackbetweenscenes). \nUsually, crossing your fingers does the trick. \nDuring the evening, there will probably come a time when you’ll need a rule \nexplained. If you don’t understand what’s happening, signify that you’re out of character \nand ask someone to tell you what’s going on. Everyone’s needed a rule explained at some \npoint, so most players are willing to slow down the action long enough to fill you in. \nIn the end, there’s a simple way to determine if you’re doing the right thing at your \nmaiden LARP: Ask yourself, “Am I havingfun?” Ifthe answer is yes, you’re doing the right \nthing. If you sit in a chair the whole night, looking at all the costumes without ever \nopening your mouth, and you’re actually having fun, more power to you. But if the answer \nis no, you’re not having fun, you probably need to change your approach. Talk to different \npeople, consider anew character, or get your existing one into trouble. If you sticksilently \nto the wall, your character will probably survive as long as you do. But where’s the fun in \nthat? The exciting aspect of MET, besides getting to be someone (and something) else \nfor a few hours, lies in achieving the goals you set for your character. Taking the plunge \nand talking to people is risky, in the game and in life, but it’s ultimately well worth it. \nSome final advice: Get to know the people you’re LARPing with. For some, \nLARPing is just a fun pastime, and for others it’s life. In the latter group, there are people \nfor whom it’s life because it’s fun, and people for whom it’s life because they’re nuts. Avoid \nthe nuts - \nthere’s no pleasing those people. \nFortunately, most MET-types are sane and indistinguishable from the rest of the \nhumanity, and they probably have stronger opinions about the nuts than you do. I went \ninto the Blackened Hearth game with an extremely cynical attitude about what sort of \n\n\npeople would he there. I expected to encounter the psycho confederacy, complete with \nscrew-in fangs and their clan symbols tattooed on their foreheads. Happily, I was proven \ncompletely wrong. \nT H E  NEXT C~AME, A N D T H E  NEXT \nStick with a LARP, and you’ll be a familiar face before you know it. The best advice \nis just to use common sense. Have fun, and allow others to have fun as well. Don’t be a \nRules Lawyer, don’t cheat, don’t be any of the varieties of Twinkus METus that Charles \nBailey and Rich Dansky have described in previous issues of the Journal. \nMost importantly, don’t be afraid to play what you want to play. Your character can \nbe a total bastard but still welcome in the game, because his presence provides achallenge \nfor others. Also, don’t be daunted by the petty politics that seem to surround some \nLARPs. Make your opinions known but don’t be one of the folks who drive perfectly fun \ngames to ruin by talking behind people’s backs and staging bimonthly secret revolutions. \nAt the same time, don’t let the fear of that sort of out-of-game dynamic keep you from \nplaying and enjoying yourself. Simply put, do what you want to do, but don’t ruin other \npeople’s good time along the way. \nPOSTSCRIPT: \nBE NICETOTHE \nNEWBIES \nGetting involved with a LARP would be easier if the experienced players made their \ngames more accessible to new players. So for you folks already involved in a game, here \nare a few suggestions to make things better for the tyros. \nUnless you want to keep your LARP small, inbred, poor and newbie-free, you need \nto incorporate new players in such a way that they’ll have fun and stick with the game. \nMake a point of talking to the new people at least once during the course of the evening. \nSure, your character’s the most important being in the city, far too important to actually \nacknowledge a new face. Can’t you send a lackey over to find out a little about the \nnewcomer? In a larger game, it simply isn’t practical to talk to all the new people. If \nnothing else, avoid discounting them out of hand. At least give them a nod and an \nacknowledgement before you get on with your life. \nAlso, don’t whip out too many arcane rules on the beginners. They’re still trying to \nfigure out what all the crazy gestures mean. Saying, “I don’t care if your sheet’s done, I \nwant to see you write up a treatment of your character history using the Prelude \nFlowcharts in the Masquerade Players Kit,” doesn’t quite convey the friendly welcome \nyou should give newbies for showing up to your game. And if you absolutely must \ndominate a newbie’s character into standing still so you can destroy her with your \nAdvanced Stormbringing and the Windmill Dance of the Never-Ending Bloodbath, at \nleast explain to her out-of-character what’s going on. After the game, you should shake \nher hand and tell her sincerely that you enjoyed the scene and that you hope to see her \nagain next time in more genteel circumstances. The newbie will, no doubt, come blazing \nback onto the scene with a new character ready to avenge the recently deceased, but at \nleast she’ll come back. \nThose involved in organizing the game or Storytelling should pay particular \nimportance to the new folks. Yeah, you’re busy. At least come up to them after the game \nand ask if they had fun and invite them to the next game. If you’re running an invitation- \nonly game, you’ve probably already figured out that most of this advice doesn’t apply to \nyou. But for most LARPs, new players are precious - \ntry not to scare away too many. \n\n\nINSIDF THF CLOSFT: \nEASHION TIPS FOR THF \nBLOODLORN \nby Auntie Csilla \nGood evening, kiddies, and welcome to another edition of Auntie Csilla’s wit and \nwisdom. How’s it hanging? Mine’s currently in mothballs for the season, but that’s \nanother story. \nwhile there aren’t any Elysium fashion police, there are times when they sure would \nbe helpful. How many times have you been able to spot every Tremere walking in simply \nbecause they’re all wearing black capes and accessorizing with pentacles and canes? How \nmany Toreador insist on showing up in the same black lace ensemble? Consider this \narticle, then, the equivalent of the Elysium Fashion Highway Patrol. \nFirst, let’s start with color. There’s no denying that black is a nice basic to build on. \nIt matches everything, it looks classy and mysterious, just about everyone can wear it \n(very slimming, you know), and it’s timeless, while colors vary from season to season. At \nSay you’ve never been to a Masquerade event - \n01 you don’t attend regularly \nenough - \nand you can’t put your finger on exactly why you feel out of p h e .  The \nreason for that may be the way you’re dressed. Whik it‘s okay to smnd out from the \ncrowd, there are some accepted conventions of vampiric fashion that have become the \nwrm and even passed on into the realm of stereotype. For tips on recognizing those \nstereotypes (and breaking the mold with class and fir), read on. Auntie Csilla‘s got \njust the right advice.. . \n~ \nk \nthe same time, if everyone around you is wearing black, you don’t stand out from the \ncrowd. For all you Toreador, isn’t that a fate worse than being tacky? If you want to go \nfor the “I’m dark and mysterious” bit, consider other deep colors, such as crimson, forest \ngreen, teal, navy, burgundy, purple or charcoal gray. You don’t even have to go all red or \ngreen or whatever. Just a few little bits (like the buttons, a scarf, a boutonniere, a vest, \njewelry) can make somebody’s eyes give you more than a once-over. \nSecondly, fit. In short, if you can’t zip it/ button it/ tie it without seriously sucking \nit in-and you haven’t beenable toforyears-put \nit in theGoodwil1 bin. Whenclothes \ndon’t fit, you look uncomfortable and certainly not your best. It’s one thing to be \nhermetically sealed in satin if you’re built like a toothpick or you have the sort of figure \nthat gets your picture slapped onto the “Dangerous Curves Ahead” signs, but honey, if \nyou’re neither, reconsider. \nThirdly, gimmick or shtick. Call it what you will, the most memorable characters \nalways have something that makes them stand out when they wear it. Indiana Jones had \nhis fedora, Fred Astaire had his tux, the Black Dahlia had the original head-to-foot all \nin black -er, bad kind of unforgettable on that one. At any rate, think about something \nyou can do that will be your particular signature. It doesn’t need to be wearing the same \ndang thing over and over. It could be a Toreador neonate who wears grunge or a Gangrel \nin chain mail. What about a Ventrue whose main business is manufacturing surf boards? \n\n\nWhoa, dude, he shows up to the primogen meetings in a body glove! (I’m of course \npresuming that said Ventrue has considered provision number two.) \nNow I know some of you out there have to work when you attend court. Sheriffs, \nwe all know what trashing unruly diablerists can do to that nice suit, and far be it from \nme to encourage you to ruin your Sunday-go-to-Elysium clothes. If you have to work, you \nknow best what you should do. Consider what follows to be the law for all the rest of the \nlayabouts. \nYour average Brujah tends to look like a punk-era relic that got nibbled on by moths \nwhile in storage. Black leather, tom denim lots of piercings, tattoos and dangerous hair \n-gag me with a spoon. Hey, you guys make a big deal about how they’re all independent \nand whatnot, right? So dress like it! Who said you gotta show up in tom jeans and a black \nleather jacket? I wanna see their faces when you trot in with black pants and a clean shirt! \nSisters, watch them collect their jaws when you wear velvet or silk! Hey, what good is \nbeing a rebel if you all look the same? \nI know, I know - \nwhen you look more and more like an animal and spend a lot of \ntime with animals that don’t give two bits what you look like, fashion becomes a \nsecondary concern, and that’s the way it is with your average Gangrel. Still, it’s polite to \nwear clothes to Elysium; if nothing else, the city’s decency laws will be all over you like \nwhiteonrice ifyou don’t. Goodwill bins, St. Vincentde Paulshops, the local Army-Navy \nsurplus store - \nall are very good for restocking your wardrobe when you find yourself in \na pinch. One fine-looking specimen was partial to collecting the occasional bit of jewelry \nfrom his travels and wearing it to court. He had a set of silver Tibetan bracelets that he \nwore on special occasions; I’m holding them for him right now while he’s visiting the \nYukon. \nBefore we go any further, I’d like to register a complaint against whoever it was it \nwho said that Malkavians needed to accessorize with stuffed animals and fuzzy rabbit \nslippers. Come clean now, and I’ll kill you befure I string you up. But first things first - \nleave Mr. Bear at home, unless you redy need him. Your average homicidal maniac, serial \nkiller or otherwise serious nut job usually looks normal to the point of nerdiness. Some \ndo what the voices in their heads tell them to do (including wearing every single piece \nof clothing they own to keep it from getting stolen), some wear special helmets to block \nout the mind-control rays, and some go for the antique look. I’ve seen mystics in filmy \ndrapes, wack-job loners in their old varsity jackets, and an elder who wore commedia \nmasks for special occasions. One of the most seriously twisted cases I ever spotted at court \nwas Douglas Netchurch. I would give my left tit not to be left alone with this man (and \nsowouldyouifyouknewhim), but ifyousawhimonthestreet anddidn’tknowotherwise, \nyou’d think he was just another doctor getting away from the hospital for a bit. \nYes, even the Sewer Rats merit attention. Call this lesson: “Names can be \ndeceiving.” Not every one looks like he’s been sewer-crawling, not to mention that sewers \naren’t always waist-deep in waste water. I’ve seen a lot of Sewer Rats scrounge their gear \nout of dumpsters when they need something to work the Obfuscate over. Some like to \nfudge their clothes in addition to their faces; I know one Nos who liked to show up \nwearing a tux. Point of order, kiddies - \nif you think it’s fun to sneak around in your \naltogether and “dress” yourself with Mask of a Thousand Faces, I’ve got one word for you: \nCameras! Do you really want to chance that your best girl/guy is going to find out a) that \nyou look like road pizza outta the suit, and b) that your puss is less than you’ve been \nmaking it out to be? Besides, the heart attack that your average schmoe will have when \nhe gets a load of you in your deathday suit will not endear Hizzoner to you. \n\n\nToreador - \nGawd, here’s the real fashion parade! Kids, do yourselves a favor and \ndon’t ever get between two preeners who are trying to one-up each other that night. If \nyou really want to watch the fur fly, watch two poseurs show up in the same outfit. I ran \nthat scam for a costume ball - \ntwo cats wearing the same Scarlett O’Hara dress, and did \nthey ever get into it. Poor Princey-poo got hauled into the discussion, which put him on \nthe hot seat since he owed favors to one’s sire and the other was a primogen. Anyway, your \naverage artistes eithergofor the whole “back in black” with silver jewelry, or they stumble \nout of the studio in a shirt they were probably using for the drop-cloth. I’ve seen a few \ngoing for the Romantic look - \npoofy shirts, velvet vests, general ethereal look. Too bad \nthat swooning has gone out ofstyle; most of these twits would improve the Elysium if they \nspent it unconscious. Overall, when in doubt, go for class over trash. \nNow I’ve been told that all new Tremere do not in fact receive black capes, pentacle \npendants and canes when they get initiated. Horse shit - \nthey must be, because they \ncan’t d \nbe that inept at accessorizing. Do they wear those pointy hats with stars on them \nwhen they’re working wizardly wonders in the chantry? Let’s start with the pentacle/ \npentagram/prettystar. Oh, please, there have got to be other mystic symbols youcanwave \naround to freakout the Bible-thumpers. I mean, there’s that wonderful Seal of Solomon \n(which actually comes in handy should you encounter a wandering demon), the Eye of \nHorus, Tarot cards (one of the few warlocks I can actually stand wears the Magician) - \neven crystals, if you feel like showing off how young you are. Then there’s those canes - \ncarry a sword cane only if you can use it, bubeleh. Most of the nasties who give you reason \nto carry one of those will make ground round out of you while you’re still trying to figure \nout how to make the button work. And last, but not least, the cape: Skip it. Wanna slash \napart your aura of nocturnal majesty?Try answering the question, “So, are you in a play?” \nwith some degree of dignity. It’s the same argument with regard to the all-blackensemble. \nVentrue- Wow. If they’ve got money, it shows. The best Ventrue wear clothes that \nnot only look good (whatever it is and for whatever occasion), but which compliment \nthem and should put their personal shoppers at the top of all the socialite lists. If they were \nroyalty, they still have their old crowns and robes of state (cedar storage, please, unless \nyou get a buzz on mothballs). Unfortunately, if you spill something on Hizzoner, you’d \nbest sell all your worldly goods and hope that the stain is dry-cleanable. If they don’t have \nthe money, they at least have the taste to pull a pretty good act (“Hey, wasn’t that your \nprimogen I spotted at the Off-Fifth outlet?”). Too bad taste and money don’t always go \ntogether. Nothing can make you wince like a nouveau-rick Ventrue trying to out- \nToreador a Toreador. \nAnd now, last but not least, all you poor little bloodlorn readers: Let your Mommy \ndress you, especially if you’re saddled with a Toreador. Some won’t give a shit how you \nlook, just so long as you’re there and you do your job. Ventrue, Tremere, anyone who’s \ninto business will probably insist you wear a clean shirt and tie, at the least (if you can’t \nafford the dry-cleaning, give these folks a miss). Malks may do anything from putting \ncurlers in your hair to making you wear long sleeves in the dead of summer to hide the \n“accidental” cuts. But the Toreador are a whole other case. Something about how the \nhired help should not outshine the mistress. Pity the poor secretary disfigured by her \nmistress to ensure that Madame would always get picked for the kickball team first. \nThat’s all for now, chicas. Check your flies before you get to the door, and take care \nuntil next time. \n\n\nPRONOUNCFMFNTS EROM \nON HIGH \nby the Mind’s Eye Theatre developer \nIt’s time onceagainfor Cynthia tosay herpiece on thestate of liere-actiongaming \nand Mind’s Eye Theatre. This time around, she giwes you the skinny on \nincorporating the ewents of White Wolfs table-top World of Darkness books into \nyour Mind’s Eye games. Basically, this column is the definitiwe guide un what you \nhawe to do with information you don’t hawe to use unless you want to. This advice \nstands for table-top material, but it’s ewen m e  applicable to live-action play. \nWHITE \nWOLE \nCONTINUITYAND \n‘You \nRecently, with the changes to the story lines that drive the White Wolf table- \ntop books, there’s been a great hue and cry from Mind’s Eye Theatre Storytellers \nand players, and a bigger one is anticipated. Every time a table-top book advances \nthe meta-story of one of our games, we hear, “Hey, do we have to do that?!” \nThe short answer is, no, it’s your game. Now go have fun. \nToo short? All right, here’s the more detailed answer: \nThere are grand story-arcs in the various game lines. Some are coming to \nsmashing ends, some are just beginning, and others are getting a jump-start that \nsends them off the deep end in their various “Year of the Reckoning” books. In part, \nthese arcs help focus the books and build momentum to carry things forward. Our \nown real world isn’t static, and neither is the World of Darkness. Things change, \nand not necessarily for the better. Even as table-top games come and go, the stories \nmarch ever, ever on. \nAfter all, remember why a Storyteller sits around beating her head against the \nwall trying to think up new things for the players to do - \nshe’s telling stories. A \nstory-arc is but one more story out of the thousands that populate the World of \nDarkness. These arcs, however, are not scripts. In the end, the choice of whether \nto deal with the fallout or backlash of a particular story thread is the Storyteller’s. \nIf you don’t want to incorporate the various arcs into your plot lines, there’s \nnothing wrong with that. We’re not going to bring the mountain in to beat your \ngame into line. If you want Stygia to be standing in the deadlands (what’s this!) or \nthe Camarilla Malkavians to miss the “fun” of Dementation, that’s up to you. You \nknow what makes your game tick and what would take a sledgehammer to it. Just \nmake sure your players know that you’re running in a “nonstandard direction, and \nthat they’re aware of all that comes with doing so (as in, “No, you can’t have that \nnew Discipline - \nwe’re running a different scenario.”). \nNow if you do decide to go with the grand arc, you have a number of options. \nYou may choose to throw your players in the middle of things (starting with the \nevacuation of Stygia or the Sixth Great Maelstrom, for instance), or to let events \ncome to them (Stygian refugees show up at the door of their Necropolis). You may \nchoose the “pond ripple” effect (in the wake of High King David’s disappearance, \nthe throne factions start pressuring local nobles to pick sides), or the “home-front” \nPBONOUNCEMENTS \nEBOM O N  H I ~ H  \n\n\ns \ne \nidea (under the fist of a Morwenist duke, the Eiluneds and commoners find \ncommon cause). \nOr throw your players a curve. If you’re running a game full of players who \nknow White Wolf “canon” backward and forward, pull a fast one on them. Start \nsending Malkavian Narrator characters into the game professing that they’re no \nlonger able to command men’s minds. All they can do is spread their madness like \na contagion. Your characters may know that only Sabbat Malkavians can do what \nthese newcomers are claiming, but the players will probably have heard of the \nrecent changes to Vampire: The Masquerade andLaws of the Night. But, say you \naren’t incorporating those changes into your game at all, and these newcomers are \nthe forefront of a bold Sabbat incursion. By playing with expectations and \nchanging the “canon” in your game, you make your game that much more exciting \nand dynamic. Mix up the information we give you, play around with it, and give \nthe players something they don’t expect. Do whatever works to make your stories \nbetter and keep your players happy. \nAnd now, as always, the refrain (sing along, friends): “Whatever you do, \nhowever you do it, it’s your game. Now go have fun.” \nM I N D ’ S  \nE Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \ne \n\n\nA PLACF EOR FVFR’YTHINCj \nby Peter Woodworth \nIt’s that time again fur an illustrative piece of MET-inspired fiction.

As long as ewerything \ngoes according to plan.. . . \n“Mister Frost! Mister Frost!” \nThe sound of the children’s voices wasn’t what made Mr. Frost look up from his \nwell-thumbed paperback to glare over the thick glass of the main display case. Rather, \nit was the harsh sound of the front door slamming behind the children as they came that, \nin turn, caused the antique bronze chimes he had neatly tied to the top of the door to \njangle discordantly instead of chiming in their usual harmony. \nIf there was anything at all that made Mr. Frost upset - \nand not many things in \nlife had received this honor- it was witnessing an item being misused. That was simply \nunacceptable, and he elaborated this opinion at great length to anyone around him who \nhad the misfortune to be caught abusing a possession of theirs in such a fashion. It was \nprecisely this habit of his, in fact, which had earned his tiny curiosity shop a reputation \nfor.. . eccentricity among the city’s antiques and collectibles crowd, a reputation which \nserved to keep away the more “respectable” collectors - \nat least when they thought \nanyone was watching them, that is. \nNot that Mr. Frost cared for such petty matters of public esteem. Customers who \nneeded him came to him, and that sort of business had always been more than enough \nto keep the shop in the black and fund his annual excursions to London and Cairo. \nBesides, as these children had proven ably, the bulk of his transactions were with \nanother sort of customer entirely. \nThey had come to him the night before, just as he had been about to close the store \nfor the night, looking ten times more bedraggled and positively frantic. It had taken him \nseveral minutes to calm the five children down, but when he finally heard their story, \nit had set even his chill blood to boiling. According to the eldest, a satyr childling \nnamed Jesse, the short version of their adventure went something like this: \nThe five of them had snuckout of their houses and been roaming around after dark, \nwhen they decided it would be fun to go and see the old abandoned Jervais Mansion. \nOf course, Mr. Frost knew of the place himself - \nafter all, no fae could grow up in this \ntownwithout hearing tales about the “haunted house” that stood like adamnedsentinel \nat the outer edge of the Garden District. The little motley had nerved themselves up \nwith flashlights and a couple of good ghost stories, then gone over to the house to poke \nin the closets and raise some spooks. \nNervous and giggling as they were, they hadn’t seen any obvious ghosts as they \napproached, but the laughter had quickly faded when they entered the house itself. \nThere was precious little dust for an “abandoned” house, and going from room to room, \n\n\nthe walls, even laid into the kitchen tile. A lot of the symbols looked new, but some \nlooked like they’d been there for a long time, painted in faded paint or scuffed over by \nthe marks of many feet. Most of the furniture was gone, but every room had a sinister- \nlooking ebony statue crouching in at least one comer, watching them with narrow eyes. \nThere were bookcases too, piled high with strange black books and objects, from tiny \nsilver knives to big crystal balls and ominously human-looking skulls. They were all \ngrowing more scared as they went, but they were also convinced (as only children can \nbe) that this place was just a “regular old haunted house,” so they were in no real danger. \nConvinced, that is, until they finally entered the back pantry by the cellar. \nThere they found chairs, a pile of new magazines, a walkie-talkie, a half-empty cup \nof soda and a shiny pistol staring at them forlornly from where it lay on top of a glossy \nnew Time magazine. Despite the heat, there was still ice in the cup, as if it had been left \nonly a short time ago, and the sight of the gun brought the whole message home in a \nway the other, more exotic objects couldn’t: There are peopk in this house. Red peopk, \nandred badpeopkat that. Andifthey’remtheremw, then youcan bet they’llbe backsoon. \nIn fact, water was running behind a door not far away, meaning that the someone who \nowned the gun was probably in the bathroom, bound to return any second. \nTrembling with fear, the children &wore that they had been about to go home \nwhen they heard voices in the basement. Chanting, to be precise. The children all \nlookedembmassed at this part of the story. Even with such obvious danger staring them \nin the face, such noises were too much to resist investigating, especially in a haunted \nhouse like the Jervais place. But when they went down the stairs they saw not some \ncollection of innocent bed-sheeted specters, but a group of 12 pale, dark-robed figures \nperforming what even children could see was some sort of dark ritual. \nInvestigating was Mistake Number One. \nMistake Number Two came when one of them (no one would remember who) \nscreamed at the sight. The robed figures had turned immediately, baring wicked fangs \nand chasing the children out of the building hollering all manner of vile curses. The \nchildren had run as fast as they could, leaping fences and ducking under hedges to get \naway, but even once they were out of range, the monsters called after them. They yelled \nthat the children had already been caught by their spells, that there was nowhere they \nwould be safe now. The monsters called the children by name to show the truth behind \nthese threats, then promised to drink their blood and inflict other hideous forms of \nrevenge. \nNow the children were too scared to go to the Duke, and they had heard there was \nonly one other person to turn to insuch asituation, one personwhocouldset everything \nright -for a tidy fee, that is. Mr. Frost had graciously accepted that compliment, asked \nthem each to return the next morning with an item they valued and sent them on their \nway once he reassured them that daylight would render the monsters powerless for the \ntime being. Now here they had returned. \n“Mister Frost,” Jesse panted, her disheveled hair glowing like banked embers. \n“We.. . we have.. .” She trailed off, gulping air like a landed catfish. Mr. Frost’s scowl \ndeepened. A person’s body was her ultimate possession, after all, and seeing such a \npretty one so mistreated didnothing for his disposition. He swallowed hisdistaste as best \nhe could, though. These children were badly frightened, and thus such minor lapses \nwere excusable. This time, anyway. \n\n\n“Hush, child,” Mr. Frost murmured, not unkindly, slipping a bookmark into the \nbattered spine of Needful Things and sliding out from behind the counter with the \ncuriously eerie grace the sluaghwere known for. He steppedlightly to the front door and \npulled down the shade, pausing only to turn the deadbolt and change the store sign over \nto “Closed.” Suitably arranged, he returned to his high stool. The wide eyes of the young \nmotley followed him intently all the while, the payments he’d asked them to bring \nclutched tightly in five pairs of hands. He knitted his pale, slender fingers - \nso like the \ntalons of a hunting bird, or so many customers had noticed - \ntogether under his chin, \nfixed his deep obsidian eyes on them and began to close the deal he had bartered with \nthem only the night before. \n“School?” \n“We played hooky.” \n“I’ll see what I can do about that. What have you brought me?“ \nJesse, whose full fae name was Jesselayth, turned to the other children and looked \nat them pleadingly, her own hand closed tightly around something Mr. Frost couldn’t \nquite make out. “Guys. ..” \nMichael, a little eshu boy, came forward first, looking up at Mr. Frost with calm \ngreen eyes. ‘‘I got a book for you,” he said, his initial hesitation disappearing as his kith \nconfidence with the spoken word reasserted itself. “It’s an old one that I got from the \nlibrary last year. Mrs. Jacobs said I could keep it cause they were gonna throw it out \nanyway, so I took it home. It’s really cool and it’s got all kindsa wicked gross pictures \nin it, too.’’ He produced a tattered, coverless paperback whose yellowing title page \nproclaimed it Dr. Rando’s Amazing World ofthe Occult and Bizarre! Mr. Frost picked it \nup, careful not to damage it, and began flipping through the pages. “There’s a picture \nof a guy’s cut-off head in the middle,” Michael added helpfully. \n“Thank you, Michael,” Mr. Frost said with a grave nod of his head, concealing a \nsmile. He turned to the others. “What else do you have?” \n“I found this in my dad’s closet next to his spaceship,” ventured Kenny, the tow- \nhaired pooka boy, putting a box on the counter. It was a build-it-yourself model car kit, \nseemingly untouched despite the words “Made in the USA 1959” printed on one side. \n“He said I could have it, so I took it.” Kenny scratched his nose nervously, setting his \nthin whiskers and heavy cheeks shaking in tandem. “It’s pretty new though, so I don’t \nthink it’s worth anything.” \nMr. Frost waved the concern away, ideas for the kit’s use already spinning in his \nmind. “You’re a born trader, my boy. This will do fine.” The pooka’s ears twitched with \npride at the compliment. “What else?” \nA pile of black feathers - \nwhich once might have been acrow but could now only \ncharitably be called a mess -slapped down on the counter with a wet sqoosh. ‘‘I was \nsaving it for lunch, but you can have it.” Jacque (pronounced “Jock” by anyone who \nwanted to avoid a giant wedgie or killer Indian bum) grinned his irregular shark‘s smile \nup at Mr. Frost. His eyes dared a refined gentleman like Mr. Frost to touch such a gross \nthing without throwing up, dared him in the leering fashion even the smallest redcaps \nlearn. \n“Delightful,” Mr. Frost declared, sweeping the wrecked carcass up to inspect it. ‘‘I \nknow just the person who might make some use of this item.” He looked carefully from \nchild to child, seeing that hope had started to dawn on their faces. Excellent. Still, he \nhad a part to play, and he stuck to it. “Thii can’t be all of it, can it?” \n\n\nbroach in a silver setting lay poised on her palm. “My mom gave this to me when I was \nreally little,” she said quietly. “It’s fake, but it’s really pretty, and it’s always brought me \ngood luck.” She seemed near tears but laid the broach on the counter anyway, drawing \nher mouth in a thin, strong line. “Is it good enough?” All the children looked to Mr. \nFrost, crossing their fingers. \nShe’U be a strung one, Mr. Frost thought with admiration. He took the broach and \nexamined it gravely. A grand idea was already forming in his mind, but it was lacking \none crucial piece. He hoped the last offering would complete the set. “Have no fear, \nyoung Jesse. It shall not be wasted. Thank you.” The children all breathed relief \nsimultaneously. He raised one final speculative eyebrow. “Anything else!” \n“Yes, Mister Fross,” came the tiny, whispered reply. Peep stepped forward, his \noversized dark eyes and mousy mop of hair a sharp contrast to his pale skin. Easily the \nyoungest, the little sluagh had to stand on his toes just to reach the countertop, and Mr. \nFrost suspected that the boy must’ve been carried by someone during the getaway the \nnight before. Nonetheless, he seemed to fit in with the others just fine. “I rescued these \nfrom the post office last spring. It was really cold in there, and I got scared.” With great \ncare, the boy slid a folded sheet of white paper across the glass top. “Are they okay?” \nMr. Frost picked up the sheet, on which were stuck five brightly colored butterfly \nstamps. He frowned for a moment, then a slight smile flickered across his lips like a \nshadow at the edge of candlelight. “They’re perfect, child. Just perfect. And you’re very \nbrave.” \nMr. Frost sat for a moment more in silence, then rose to his feet, pulling down his \nblackgreatcoat and carefully sweeping each item into a pocket. “Come,children. I shall \ntake care of your monster problem for you, but there are many things I need to do, and \nthe day is short. Let’s go.” \nAs they followed the enigmatic sluagh out into the early morning light, Kenny \nturned to Jesse and said, with no small amount of admiration, “I think he’s gonna get \nus all killed after all.” \n“Come on, Kenny,” Jesse said, tugging the pooka along. \n“I can’t believe we’re in a TV studio!” Jesse exclaimed. \nThe office was small but colorful, its walls slathered in garish movie posters and \nshelves teeming with odd knickknacks, and the children gaped comically at the array \nof memorabilia before them. Old movie posters from fifties B-movies vied with pictures \nof alleged Bigfoot tracks and blown-up reproductions offamous UFO photos. Mr. Frost’s \nstore and its prized collectibles were one thing, but this collection was far more \ncontemporary and thus struck a more active nerve. Mr. Frost didn’t care one way or \nanother - \nit was the office’s occupant, Emory Dodge, they’d come to see. \nDodge rose from his rolling chair, extending a hand across the desk with a wide \nsmile for his old contact, sparing a slightly puzzled but affable expression for the group \nof children Frost brought with him. The pooka’s loud yellow blazer and neon green tie \nwent well with the decor, though they would’ve staggered sensible fashion designers \nfrom miles away against any other backdrop. Mr. Frost could see where the makeup had \nbeen applied to remove the natural dark circles under the man’s eyes, the only touch \nof the pooka’sraccoon nature that mortals could see. To him and the children, ofcourse, \nthe bandit-mask marks shone through gloriously, along with the furry ears and a tiny \n* \n* \n* \n\n\ntail emerging from a tasteful slit in the back of his deep purple pants. “Frosty, you old \ncheapskate, how’re you doing? What brings you to my neck of the woods? Love troubles \nagain?” He gestured to the children and smiled engagingly. “And what’s with the senior \ncitizen brigade here? Day off at the old folk‘s home?“ The children giggled. \nMr. Frost did not smile back. “Nothing of the sort.” He put his arm around Jesse. \n“These children have a story I want you to tape for this Friday’s episode of your \nprogram.” He gestured to the large Weekly Weirdness News poster behind Dodge’s desk. \n‘‘I can assure you, your audience will absolutely adore it.” He smirkedknowingly. “It has \neverything good tabloid television needs: children in distress, monsters on the loose, \neven a local angle. Everything.” \nDodge looked politely skeptical. “I’d love to help you, Frosty,” he began, “and I’m \nsure their story is absolutely fascinating, but the viewers of Weekly Weirdness News are \na very intellectual, very discerning market. Unless these children have something really \ndifferent to say, I’m afraid we have a lot of other segments ready to air along those lines \nalready. I don’t know about ...” \nMr. Frost had reached into his jacket as Dodge began to trail off into the vague \nexcuses of the entertainment industry, producing the battered occult book Michael had \ngiven to him earlier. Wordlessly, he extended it to the young reporter. Dodge fell silent \nimmediately, his eyes goggling comically at the sight of it. He snatched the book away \nand began thumbing through it eagerly, immediately absorbed. “Ofcourse,” began Mr. \nFrost with false hesitation, “if you still feel that this story isn’t worth your time, I could \ntake them elsewhere.. .” \nDodge’s head snapped up, his eyes darting from ashelf of similar old-fashioned pulp \noccult books behind his desk to the other changelings before him. \n“Did I say we had a lot of other segments like this already? I meant to say that this \nis just what we needed right now!” He looked back down at the book with loving eyes. \n“For an original Dr. Rando, you can host the show yourselves!” \nThe lean sluagh shook his head. “That won’t be necessary, but if you could take \nthem back to do the taping today, I’d much appreciate it. I’ll be back for them later, after \nI finish running some errands. Agreed?” Dodge merely nodded absently and began \nherding the children out of the room before him, still gazing raptly at the faded text \nbefore him. The kids looked back worriedly at Mr. Frost as they left, but he merely \nsmiled at them. “Don’t worry,” he mouthed, “I’ll return when my work is done. I \nMr. Frost gritted his teeth as he approached his next stop, stepping between rising \nsteel beams and trying to block out the high-pitched wailing of power tools rending the \nair around him. He sought out the changeling he knew was hidden among the human \nworkers: Kincaid, a nocker who drew his Glamour from transforming vacant lots into \ngleaming houses and crumbling mansions into glittering masterpieces. He’d traded \nKincaid a set of old-fashioned mason’s tools and a few chimerical knickknacks before, \nand he knew the nocker to be fair, if decidedly obstinate in the worst times. \nThe negotiations were short, as they always are with nockers. Frost presented the \nvintage model kit Kenny had brought him and a black-and-white picture of the Jervais \nhouse that he had taken soon after the kids had left his store the night before. The sluagh \noffered the former to Kincaid in exchange for a promise to accept a contract to restore \nthe latter pro bono -on behalf of the city’s Historical Preservation Society, of course. \n\n\nguarantee a list of wealthy clients well into the new millennium. \n“Where’d you get this?” Kincaid said, gesturing gently with the model kit box. \n“It came through the shop earlier this week,” Frost whispered back calmly, hoping \nthe nocker could make out the words over the din of construction. “Why? Is it \nvaluable ?” \n“Not at all, Frost,” Kincaid said, arching a sardonic eyebrow. “Not to someone \nwho’s been looking for a model from this series made in this year to complete a life- \nspanning collection. Hardly worth the concrete foundation under our feet.” \nThe flat, poured base chd look a little uneven to Frost, but he neglected to mention \nit in deference to Kincaid’s feelings. \n“Sure, I’ll do the job,” Kincaid shouted over the noise at last, his rough hands \ncaressing the smooth contours of the box like a lover’s curves. “But are you really sure \nabout this? You’re talking about the old Jervais place, right? I haven’t heard anything \nabout the city handing out a contract on it.” \n“That’s because it hasn’t been issued yet,” countered Mr. Frost. “The day’s still \nyoung. I’ll call you with the specifics tomorrow morning.” \n* \n* \n* \nAfter punishing his rarefied senses at the construction site, Mr. Frost allowed \nhimself a moment to revel in the quiet, subdued atmosphere of the Baroness’s salon. He \nthen announced himself politely to the pleasant kinain girl behind the counter and \ntook stock of his surroundings. \nEthereal Fashions was the kind of upscale clothing store that appeared more like \na private residence than a place of business, with the clothes tastefully displayed off to \nthe side and small tables set for serving tea instead of crude, glaring metal racks and \ncouches for waiting husbands and boyfriends. Mr. Frost - \nseldom a caller in this part \nof town-was still admiring the tasteful decor when the kinain reappeared to usher him \ninto the back of the store for an audience with the Baroness. \nThe Baroness appeared as he had always known her: a boggan of uncommon grace \ndressed in a simple blue-satin outfit that nonetheless teased out every aspect of her \nbeauty. She was still bent over a fine silk dress with a needle in one hand and a spool \nof thread in the other when he coughed softly to announce himself. Even at court, she \nseldom left her knitting far from her hands, always altering some item or weaving \nanother as she entertained guests or weighed cases brought before her. \nThis scene was a familiar one to Frost. He’d seen the beginnings of this particular \ndress at court two weeks before, when it was nothing more than a rough sketch, a few \nbolts of fabric and a dream borne on the Baroness’s hands. Now, it was amarvel in itself, \nan innocent wish captured in cream-colored silk and fine silver thread. But even as Mr. \nFrost entered, the Baroness threw away her needle in despair, as if facing a puzzle she \nsimply couldn’t solve. Hearing him approach, the Baroness looked up and smiled \nthinly, the frustration evident at the comers of her lips. \n“My Lady Rhiannon,” Mr. Frost said, nodding slightly. \n“Come and be welcome, Cyrus Frost,”she replied, waving his politeness away. She \nMr. Frost looked innocent. “Trouble?” \nlooked down at the dress and sighed. “Accept my apologies for my abruptness.” \n\n\nconsequence.” She appraised him with her eyes. “Now, why have you asked for an \naudience on such short notice? I hadn’t thought of you as the type who needed favors \nfrom others, Cyrus.” \n“As D h  would have it, that is just what I require, Lady Rhiannon,” Mr. Frost \nbegan humbly, producing a copy of the picture he had shown to Kincaid not half an hour \nearlier. ‘‘I know you hold sway over the city’s Historical Preservation Society, Lady, and \nI would like to ask you to use your influence over that body to have this building claimed \nand restored.” \nLady Rhiannon looked sharply at him. “And why should we do that?” \n“The building is abandoned, and in dire need of repair before it-” \nThe comely boggan shook her head. “That much is already plain. Do not toy with \nme, Frost. You have as much interest in old buildings as I do in polyester culottes. We \nboth know the lease on the Jervais house has been held in trust for dozens years longer \nthan we’ve been alive, even if the.. . current owners have decided to let it go a bit.” \nRhiannon looked as if she was about to stop speaking, then shrugged resignedly. “I’ll be \nplain with you - \nit’s an absolute tragedy what they’ve allowed that house to become, \nand we at the Society have been trying to get our hands on the mansion since even \nbefore I took over as chair. However, we’ve never been able to get past the paperwork \nprocess with the owners and their lawyers, city association or not. What makes you so \nsure that situation would begin to change now?” \n“Call it a hunch,” Mr. Frost insisted. “It will work, my lady, believe me.” \n“Even if I do, why should I assume the headache right now?” In response, Mr. Frost \ndelved into his outside pocket and produced the broach Jesse had given him, tumbling \nit across his palm to twinkle in the store’s muted lights. The Baroness lifted an eyebrow. \n“A bribe? With costume jewelry? Oh, really, Cyrus.” \n“Not a bribe, Lady Rhiannon,” said Mr. Frost persuasively, rolling the pearls slowly \nin his fingers. “No, think of it as gesture of good faith, a way of compensating you for \nassuming the inconvenience of pursuing the matter with the Jervais house on my \nbehalf.” He smiled ever so slightly. “I believe the Society’s monthly meeting is due any \nday now, is it not?”The Baroness nodded cautiously. “How fortuitous. Then please, take \nthis little token,” he pressed the broach into her palm, “and accept my gratitude.” He \npaused for just a heartbeat. ‘‘I believe it might just complete the image you’re looking \nfor with that dress, if I may say so.” \nSurprised, Baroness Rhiannon compared the broach to the dress, at first hesi- \ntantly, then with more interest. She clucked her tongue, held them both up to the light, \nthen nodded almost imperceptibly and turned back to the waiting sluagh, a bemused \nlookon her face. “Alright, Cyrus, I’ll call the Society and bring it up with them tonight. \nIf anything comes of it, I’ll let you know. I don’t know what your interest in this matter \nis - \nand frankly I’m not sure if I want to - \nbut restoring that house would truly be a \nbeautiful deed, a blessing to kith and kinain alike. So I will take it on.. . faith that your \nintentions are noble.” \nMr. Frost looked deadly serious. “You have my word on it, Lady Rhiannon.” \nShe held his gaze a moment longer, then nodded once more. “Then go in peace, \nCyrus Frost. I only hope your hunch is as impeccable as your fashion sense.” Mr. Frost \nmerely smiled in response and rose to leave. He had not yet crossed the threshold, \nhowever, when the Baroness called after him. \n\n\n‘‘I feel I should warn you, Cyrus. Our budget has been very tight this year. Even if \nwe did succeed, I don’t know that we have the means to order such an extensive \nrestoration.” \nMr. Frost turned, the grin on his face spreading like crystals on an icy window. “As \nit turns out, My Lady Rhiannon, I believe I know just the man for the job.” \n* \n* \n* \nThe last meeting of the day was nearly as short as the time spent with the nocker, \nfor Mr. Frost cared even less to meet with this last contact than he did to spend time \nnegotiating with a hard case like Kincaid. He simply waited outside the old mausoleum \nin which the contact slept until the last rays of daylight were dying on the horizon, \npositioned himself carefully in front of the door and knocked three times briskly on the \nheavy marble. A shuffling arose from within, and the marble groaned aside a few inches. \nFrost could see no more than the pale, delicate curve of the tomb‘s inhabitant’s cheek. \n“Some dream comes to tempt me,” the bored, cultured and very old voice said \nquietly from within. “It wants something. What does it want?” \n“I need the address of one of your kind,” Mr. Frost said very carefully, making sure \nto keep his voice respectful and calm. “More specifically, I need you to deliver \nsomething to that one before the night gets under way.” \n“What insight does this dream bring me?” the voice asked in smooth, even tones. \n“Your word first,” Frost whispered, knowing he played a dangerous game. The \nseductive caress of Banality already tickled his skin like cold water. \n“And why shouldn’t I just wake from this dream?” the voice said, lowering in \ntimbre and humming with thinly repressed anger. “And in waking, dream it no more.” \nThe shape within stepped forward, revealing a silken fall of black hair before Frost \nstepped aside. The last, dying rays of sunlight on the western horizon (which Frost’s \nshadow had been blocking off) fell into the tomb. The figure inside made no sound, but \ndarted back instantly. Frost stepped back into place. \n“I’ll dream a while longer,” the voice said tightly, after a very long, tense pause. \n“Tell of your insight. I will indulge the dream its message.” \n\n\n“Best to see for yourself,” Frost said, handing the ruined carcass of Jacque’s crow \n(which he was all too glad to remove from his unlined coat pocket) in through the \nmausoleum door. \n“A harbinger.. .” the voice said in an odd mixture ofconfusion and interest. “I have \nnot eyed the fall of a sparrow in some time.” The voice fell silent a moment, and frost \nheard sickening sounds of tearing and scraping that finally resulted in the figure within \nthe tomb gasping in undisguised shock. \n“The dream tells of dire portents.. .” the creature inside said. “Castles falling to \nruin ... warring kingdo ms... times of fire ... a trial ... the birth of a star... a hunt for \narrogant usurpers.. .” \n“So you’ll deliver my message?” Frost asked as the voice trailed off. He held out a \nbulging manila envelope, sealed and marked with only a name and a title of nobility. \n“Time is of the essence.” \nHysterical laughter erupted from within the tomb, and Frost had to force himself \nnot to take a step back. Tides of Banality surged and swelled around him. \n“I’ll deliver it,” the voice whispered, still laughing. “Now, fill me with your \nportent.” \nFrost saw a pale, perfect hand emerge from the tomb, and he put the envelope into \nit. \n“And Frost,” the voice said, banishing all traces of mirth as quickly as blowing out \na cand’.?. Frost looked up into a pair of eyes that had never seen the sun in all of Frost’s \nlong life. Frost stood pinned, like a bird before a viper. “Disturb not the sleeper again.” \nWith that, the mausoleumdoor whisked shut, and Frost stood alone. All too happy \nto comply with the last wish, the gaunt sluagh walked away, hoping that a mad being’s \nwhim would not ruin an otherwise perfectly orchestrated day. \n* \n* \n* \n“Package for you, sir,” the retainer whispered, scuttling into the presence of his \nundead master. “The Seer in the lowlands just dropped it off. He didn’t say what it is.” \n“The Seer, eh?” Prince Marcel asked with languid curiosity. “Bring it here.” He \nexamined the plain manila package, the spidery formal handwriting on the front clearly \nmarking it as intended for him alone; four bright butterfly stamps the only splash of \ncolor. Definitely the Seer’s work, he thought with a mental sigh. The stamps hadn’t even \nbeen postmarked. Then again, the Seer had never really understood the contrivances \nof modem bureaucracy. \nWaving the butler away offhandedly, he slit the package open with sharpened \nfingemails. A video cassette marked “Weekly Weirdness News Show 149” fell out, \nalong with a small, handwritten note in the same old-fashioned script that graced the \nenvelope the package had come in. \nHe skimmed the note distractedly at first, then read it again with greater \nconcentration. The language of the note betrayed modem colloquialisms and patterns \nof thought vastly different from the Seer’s timeless linguistic flavor. All of the prince’s \nearlier good humor faded during the third reading, replaced by a widening scowl as \ndangerous as any fault line. By the time he had finished his fifth reading, any vestigial \npretense of humanity was long gone, the ashen hue of his undead state unmistakably \napparent in his rage. It was all he could do to fight the urge to twist the tape into plastic \nribbons as he slid it into the VCR. He did not want to believe what he had just read, \nbut he could not take the chance that it might actually be serious as opposed to one very \nsic!<, very unfunny joke. \n\n\nshredded into thin strips of wood. With a bestial shout, the prince overturned his \nexpensive steel desk in one fluid motion. At the sound of the crash, the butler came \nscurrying in. \n“Is everything all right, milord?” he asked as obsequiously as he could manage, \neyeing the upended desk nervously. “Shall I call the guards?” \nMarcel glared at him without recognition for a long moment - \na killing fury \nclouding his wide almost feral eyes. The butler knew his death was staring him in the \nface. He closed his own eyes, waiting, but when an agonizing amount of time passed and \nhe remained untouched, he cautiously opened them again. Marcel was still perched in \nhis ruined chair, his body taut, his eyes burning. The near-mindless rage of moments ago \nhad passed, replaced instead with an intense, focused look of hatred. When he spoke, \nthe effort to remain calm merely punctuated every syllable with barely restrained \nmalice. \n‘‘I wish. To see. The Tremere. And the Seer. Bring them. All of them.” \nThe retainer hesitated. “My.. . my lord?” \n“Now!” \nJesse got the envelope in the mail the next morning, the butterfly stamp on it \nunmarked by any post office marker. Even though she had found it in her room, it was \naddressed to all the others too. So even though she was dying to know what was in it, \nshe waited until she could assemble them all before she opened it. The motley sat \naround on the floor of her parent’s attic, hushed and waiting. Except for the time they \nspent in the studio with Dodge, they’d all been too scared to do much of anything \nyesterday, instead following Mr. Frost’s instructions andstaying home. At that age, such \ntime - \nespecially time spent looking out for monsters - \nseemed like an eternity, and \nthey were all anxious. If this letter was good news, it was possibly their only chance to \navoid spending every day like that, and they all felt it. Jesse drew out a piece of paper \ncovered in Mr. Frost’s long, spidery handwriting. \n* \n* \n* \n\n\nthe words. \n“Shhh, you dummy, I’m reading!” Jesse hushed him. The others glared appropri- \nately until Michael stopped fidgeting. “Mr. Frost says hi to everyone,” she began, \npicking up speed asshe went, “and he wants us to know that it’s safe to go outside again.” \nThere was an audible sigh of relief. “He says that the monsters have been taken away, \nand that we don’t have to worry about them ever bothering us again, or we can tell him \nand he’ll make sure that their.. . their.. . prince - \nthat’s weird - \nwill get really mad \nat them and send them away forever and ever.” \n“Their prince?” Jacque asked, not understanding. \nJesse shrugged. “Do I look like I know what monsters do? Maybe it’s another kind \nof noble we don’t know about. Anyway, he says to let him know if absolutely anything \nelse happens with those monsters, ever, even just in our dreams and stuff.” \n“Nah, \nI don’t think I will,” Kenny said, rolling his eyes. \n“Dork.” Jesse stuck out her tongue. “He does say, though, that we’re not supposed \nto go near the old Jervais house, at least not for a while, cause its under ... reno... \nrenner.. .” she looked for a word the younger kids would understand “They’re gonnabe \nrebuilding it, so it won’t be so scary anymore. The Baroness and some of the other \ngrumps are fixing it. He says it’ll be all nice when it’s open again, and we’ll be invited \nto the first party there, even if it goes past our bedtimes.” \n“Yea! A party!” Peep whisper-giggled excitedly. \n“You’re not going, you’re too young,” Michael retorted. \n“Says who?” Peep bridled to his full three feet two. \n“Says me!” Michael replied, laughing. \n“Quiet, you guys, there’s still some left!” Jesse commanded. The others fell silent. \nShe finished her reading in a silence more suited to a library than a motley of childlings. \n“He says in conch . . . to finish up, that he’s really sorry, but the show we did with Dodge \nwon’t be on TV after all.” She silenced the protests with a look before they could start. \n“He says it was part of the plan to stop the monsters, but if they show it now, the \nmonsters will be really mad, and they might try to come hurt us again no matter what. \nDodge says we can come back any time and see the studio if we want, though.” \n“Well, that’s wonderful,” Kenny sighed sadly. “TV didn’t look like any fun \nanyway.” \n“Did he say anything else?” Michael asked hopefully. \n“Mister Frost says that if we ever need him again, we can just stop by his store any \ntime, as long as we bring something to trade him.” She frowned. “He also says the \nBaroness thinks I’m going to like my Saining present when I see it.” Jesse shrugged. “He \nsigned it, ‘Sincerely, Mister Frost.’” She grinned broadly. “Oh, cool! He has a P.S. at the \nbottom!” \n“What’s it say?” the others shouted in unison. \n“Mister Frost says we paid him too much for his services, so he saved the change \n“What change?“ Jacque asked, still looking confused. In response, Jesse turned the \nTwo battered crow feathers drifted to the ground and came to rest between them. \nleft over and sent it to us.” She looked up at the others, puzzled. “That’s all.” \nenvelope upside down and shook it. \n\n\nLAWS OE ASCFNSION \nby Jess Heinig \n~ \n~ \n~ \n~ \n~~ \nBefore you decide to either carry me around OTI \n- , \nyour shoulders praising my name for including this \nmaterial OT curse me to the pits ofthe darkest \nnetherworldfur openinga whole new can of \nworms, let me explain.

More or less. \nsort of. \nWell, not really. \nRequests and submissions for MET Mage rules are among the most common \ntype of mail I receive here at the desk of Mage-Central. Most everybody has a home \nversion of live-action Mage, and I’ve got about eight billion copies in my desk here \n(it has an extradimensional space for that sort of thing). Even those who don’t take \nup the burden of building their own Mage material inevitably get around to asking \n“Why hasn’t White Wolf done this, especially given the incredible popularity and \ndemand?” \nGiven that White Wolf is, after all, a business and that we do like to make \nmoney, one would think that we’d have long ago published MET Mage materials. \nHowever, in our never-ending (and often frustrating) commitment to quality, we’ve \nleft this project undeveloped for the time being. We haven’t, in fact, touched it with \na 10-foot pole. \nTHE PBOBLEMSWITH \nLIVE-ACTION \nM A ~ F  \nBasically, Mage depends on several core concepts that are very difficult to \ntranslate accurately into live-action play. The big problem lies in maintaining a \nfaithful image of the game while simultaneously making it playable. If it’s not Mage \nand it doesn’t have the themes of redemption, triumph, hubris and power, then it \nwould be a misnomer and a disservice to slap a Mage label on it and try to sell it as \nsuch. Conversely, Mage’s powers and themes are so broad that they are extremely \ndifficult to represent in live-action play. \nSince we have given thought to the problems of Mage, though, I’m going to lay \nout the typical problems, and then some possible solutions. Just remember that this \narticle is in no way a license to allow mage characters into your games or a lower- \n\n\ncirculation play-test version of True Magic rules. Consider this feature damage- \ncontrol against pre-existing LARP mages you’ve already into your game. \nALLTHB POWERINTHE \nUNIVERSE \nPerhaps the most pressing problem with live-action mages is the incredible \nflexibility of the table-top magical system. With the right control of the nine \nSpheres, a mage can do just about anything. That being the case, how does one \ntranslate this broad variety into live-action play? You need an impartial Narrator to \ndetermine what a mage can and can’t do, and having a Narrator for every mage player \nis just too unwieldy, even in games where the mage population is relatively low. \nUsing an Effect-based system of established rotes is one idea, but it limits what \nmages can do and runs counter to the Mage philosophy of altering the universe \naccording to your will. Given enough time and knowledge, mages are supposed to \nbe able to perform unbelievable feats at the slightest of thoughts! A list of permissible \nEffects is like, well, a list of spells out of a game by that other company. \nTHE PARADOX \nPROBLEM \nParadox isn’t just a problem for mages, it’s a problem in games, too. Paradox \ntends to strike according to the resonance that a mage has picked up - \nweird events \nand happenings that mess around with her individual style of magic and intent. \nObviously, forming such an intensely individualized threat requires Narrator inter- \nvention, and you’re back to the problem of having a Narrator to follow every player \naround. A point-based backlash system is possible, but it lacks the flexibility and \nrandomness of true Paradox behavior. You could always make up Paradox backlashes \non the spot, but the problem then becomes one of consistency and duration. Until \nthe effect wears off (if it does), you would have to assign a Narrator to follow the \ncharacter around to a.) make sure he’s roleplaying amage beset by such a n  effect, and \nb.) inform onlookers of what bizarre effect they see when the mage player neglects \nto do so. \n~ o c I ?  \nWHAT ~ o c I ?  \nAnother typical problem for Mage LARPers lies in the use of foci. Although \nmages are encouraged to use foci in the tabletop game, many foci are just impractical \nas props for live-action. It won’t do to carry around a sword, a gun or a bone rattle \n(in public, even), so how does a mage player get a handle on foci? Item cards just lack \nthe panache, although there isn’t much choice ofwhether or not to use them. Doing \naway with foci altogether deadens a lot of the game’s flavor. \nI TURNTHB \nBUILDINC~TO \n$LASS. ” \nOh yeah. Need we mention the ‘‘I turn the vampire into a lawn chair” syndrome \nof True Magic’s flexibility? Frankly, when given time, a mage can pull off stunts that \nseriously screw with game continuity. It does little good to play in a mirror of your \nhome city if that Marauder wannabe just reduced downtown to a sinkhole. Ifyou run \nthe inevitable crossover, having a mage reduce the opposition to small heaps of \nstuffed toys gets tiresome very quickly. Managing high-end power is a real concern \nwhen Masters can rend the fabric of reality and then fold, spindle and mutilate \nanything in their way. \n66 \nLAWS 01 ASCENSION \nI \n\n\nSYSTEMS \nAs far as the systems for simulating magical Effects, Paradox and Foci g \nwon’t even begin to take a stab at it. These areas are best left toyour house rules \nwe come up with a workable system of our own. Any simulation we propost \nwould be an invitation for such a never-ending enfilade of e-mail and letter \nwe’d never forgive ourselves. Ifwe’re going to open ourselves up to that, we’ll roll the \ndice on a full-production, $15 Laws of Ascension book, thank you very much. \nMore generally, however, we can give you an idea of how to simulate the rest \nof MET play where mages are concerned. We can give you how to build a mage, \nwhen to play R-P-S and what the various mage-only Traits might do. Again, these \nrules aren’t MET canon, but they’re a step in that direction. \nMost everybody out there has a few systems for simulating Mage. If you need a \nsimple, quick-and-dirty way to simulate Arete, casting and so on, just try out the \nfollowing guidelines: \nCreate your mage character with seven primary Traits, five secondary and three \ntertiary. You get five Abilities and seven Backgrounds (Influence, AVU~LZT, \nMentor, \nand so on). You get three Willpower Traits. \nYou start with one Trait of Arete. When you perform an Effect, it requires a test \nwith a Static difficulty determined by Sphere and level. You can use an Arete Trait \nfor a retest, once per night per Trait. You can never have more levels in a Sphere than \nyou have Arete Traits. Also, for each Arete Trait that you have, your maximum \nTraits in each Attribute category go up by one from the base nine for a supernatural \nhuman. Thus, with Arete one, you can have up to 10 Traits, while Arete five allows \nup to 14 Traits. \nYou get five levels of Spheres, chosen from the Basic levels. You also get a free \nlevel in your Tradition Sphere, even if that Trait takes you to the Intermediate level. \nIf you’re an Orphan, you just get a sixth Basic level in a Sphere of your choice. \nThe difficulty for magic is typically the Effect level +4 Traits if it’s detectahle, \n+3 Traits if it’s not. Thus, using a Sense Forces (first level undetectable Effect) is \ndifficulty 4, while a lightning bolt (Forces 3, definitely detectable and improbable) \nis difficulty 7. You can make a retest with an Ability if it’s appropriate to your \nparadigm and focus (using Linguistics if you’re a Hermetic mage speaking Enochian, \nor Do if you’re an Akashic Brother, for instance). \nAnytime you want to inflict aggravated damage or create something out of \nnothing, you must expend a Trait of Quintessence. You can also spend a Trait of \nQuintessence to lower a magical difficulty by one. You start with Quintessence \nTraits equal to your Avatar Background rating (bought as a normal Background for \njust this purpose), and you get more from Nodes or Tass (see the Mage book for \ndetails). \nWhenever you fail an Effect Test and the difficulty is twice your number of \nTraits or whenever you fail a retest on an Effect, you suffer Paradox. \nAs a rule of thumb for combat, a level-two Sphere can inflict one level of \ndamage, a level-three Sphere can avoid or absorb one level of damage, a level-four \nSphere can negate an enemy’s point of special power (Blood, Willpower, Gnosis, \netc.), and a level-five Sphere can inflict two levels of damage. \n\n\nI\nI 1\n-\n \nSPHERE/ TRAIT \nALIGNMENTS \nI ~ X P B B I B N C E  \nE O B  M A ~ E S  \nI \nSphere: Four Experience Traits for a Basic level, eight for an Intermediate \nlevel, 12 for an Advanced level.

TheimportanceofwraithsfrwntheJ~Kingdominthatlastbook, infact, \nThere are realms of the dead beyond the Dark Kingdom of Iron. The most populous and \npowerful is the Jade Kingdom, or the Dark King!dom of Jade. Though few Stygians know much \nabout it (or vice versa), the Asian afterlife offers new challenges and opportunities. A chronicle \ncan run a very long time befote exhausting the possibilities in Asia, andcrossover with the Stygian \nempire offers an equally wide range of possibilities. This article is (and can be only) an introduction \nto the existence of wraiths in the Middle Kingdom - \nChina and the surrounding countries. For \nfull details on everything from the condition of wraiths in the occupied Japanese Shadowlands to \nthe distinctions between civil and criminal cases in the Jade Kingdom, see Dark Kingdom of Jade. \nBECOMING \nA WRAITH \nEvery person has two souls, the hun and the p’o. The fiun comes into being at conception and \ngoverns the mental and spiritual life of an individual while the p’o originates at! birth and controls \nthe physical aspects of life. At death, the two souls separate. The p’o lingers to see that the proper \nburial rights are performed, then drifts off into the void. The hun advances to paradise, aided by \nthe prayers and sacrifices of still-living family members. \nSometimes, however, something goes wrong. The p’o does not separate from the hun, and \nboth stay trapped in the Underworld. Premature death sometimes causes it, as does inauspicious \nburial, and sometimes it happens for no readily discemable reason at all. The p’o resents its \nsubordinate role, and it attempts to separate itself by destroying the hun if lesser means cannot \nserve. Paradise comes seldom, if at all, to trapped souls. The void of Oblivion swallows many. \nDestruction reaches out to gra!sp souls that cannot direct themselves so as to avoid the lure of \nnothingness. The best most wraithscan hope for is continued existence in theyellow Springs, the \nintermediateiealmofexistenceStygianwraithscal1 theShadowlands. Within theyellow Springs, \nwraithsfindsome fleeting contactwith the livingworldandopportunities todevelop their abilities \n.. \nin this twilight existence. \nSometimes the separation of the soul goes even more wrong. 1 \nremains near the living world, generally in the vicinity of its M y .  \nakueiorhungryghost.

In game mechanics, \nthe p’o and Shadow work the same way, accumulating Angst and drawing on Thorns and \nDark Arcanoi, even though Jade wraiths feel differently about the p’o. To most wraiths in \nthe Yellow Springs, the p’o is a natural and proper part of their soul given too much power \nin the afterlife rather than an innately dangerous force. \nJ A D E  \nWraiths of the Yellow Springs refer to various substances found in the Underworld as “jade.” \nAll jade buried along with a body in the Skinlands comes into the Yellow Springs in relic form. \nThis True Jade is worth more than anything else in the Kingdom, including most souls. Skilled \nar!tisans can shape it into objects which never fade from existence, and True Jade stores Pathos. \nWhite Jade, created by the Way of the Artisan, lacks True Jade’s durability. \nL \nT H E  MECHANICS \no E TRUE \nJ A D E  \nATrue Jade blade slices through any White Jade Artifact when its wielder wins astatic \nPhysicalTestagainst the target’stotalofTraits.CuttingthroughTrue JadewithaWhite Jade \nblade gives the wielder a three-Trait penalty. \nT H E  \nJ A D E  KINGDOM \nTrapped souls also find government. Qin Shihuang, the First Emperor of a unified China, \ndied 23 centuries ago. He’d prepared himself out of a great fear of (and fascination with) death, \nand he promptly took control of the afterlife corresponding to his empire in life. He ordered \nartisans to build and bury around clay statues around his tomb, and these statues emerged as vessels \nfor the souls that became his nearly unstoppable Immortal Guardsmen. They gleam as if freshly \npainted even today. With these and other unique spiritual tools and weapons, Qin Shihuang \nsecured his empire and proclaimed himselfYu Huang. He spread his rule across Korea, Japan, Tibet \nand other lands around China. The wraiths of the Occupied Territories suffer under heavy military \noccupation, their inhabitants enslaved and forged so that Yu Huang’s Chinese subjects may exist \nin relative comfort. \nIn life, Yu Huang used eunuchs for sensitive missions, as did emperors before and after him. \nEmperors reasoned that eunuchs could be trusted not to let concerns about their own family \ninterfere with loyalty to the throne. (In practice, enough eunuchs found other ways to promote \ntheir personal dynasties that the wicked eunuch giving bad advice became a cliche of popular \nstorytelling.) In the afterlife, early ministers presented Yu Huang with something comparable. \nJade Empire Eunuchs are individuals with erased memories and semi-mechanical jade machinery \nimplants. An authorized official touches a lever to make the Eunuch record everything it sees and \nhears, another to make the Eunuch play back a particular passage. Some Eunuchs retain a vaguely \nhuman appearance, others not, depending on the preferences of their makers. Eunuchs circum- \nvent the problemsofincomplete andunreliable records thatp1agueotherShadowlandsgovemment.s. \nThe short-lived Skinlands Qin dynasty applied the philosophy of Legalism, developed by \nHan Fei in the fifth century B.C. -about the same time Confucianism and Daoism emerg \nSkinlands China, Legalism merged with many other philosophies, becoming just one elem \nthe philosophy of governance, but in the Yellow Springs, Legalism still reins supreme. Le \nmakes no assumptions of innate goodness or moral power in the universe. Instead, HI \nrecommends seven principles for rulers: \nKnow and compare the various possibilities. \nPunish failure with unvarying severity. \nT H E  DAEK \nK I N D O M O ~  \nJ A D E  \n8 \n\n\nReward success with unvarying generosity. \nListen to all views and hold the proposer accountable for every word. \nConceal your intent behind unfathomable orders and deceptive assignments. \nConceal your knowledge when making inquiries of a minister. \nSpeak in opposites and act in contraries. \nYu Huang’s government includes four distinct branches, each sending a representative to \nmost towns. The Four Magistrates and their assistants administer the routine chores of govem- \nment. Smaller towns may have fewer magistrates, or the population might be forcibly relocated \nto larger communities. A few wraith families usually provide most of the officials, as they did in \nlife. \nDistrict magistrates oversee groups of town and rural areas. Families have to work harder to \nmaintain dominance at the district level, and individual service - \nor lack thereof - \ncomes to \nmatter more than family connections. City magistrates, overseeing large Necropoli, operate as \npeers of district magistrates. They divide cities into sectors and neighborhoods, each with its own \nFour Magistrates. Sometimes a few families achieve dominance, but, more often, high population \ndensity leads to constant upheaval and little continuity of lineage among the staff. \nCommanderies oversee several towns and the surrounding rural districts. District command- \ners scrutinize their subordinates throughout the area. It’saprestigious positionwithfewdemands.. . \nmost of the time. \nThe Jade Kingdom consists of 34 provinces, each with a Governor chosen directly by the \nEmperor and provincial representatives of the Four Branches. Governors have final authority in \nprinciple; whether they use it, delegate it or find it manipulated away from them depends on the \nindividuals involved. The Emperor can review and negate governors’ decisions, but he seldom \ndoes so. \nThe imperial court itself occupies the Jade Palace, a sprawl of more than 200 separate \nbuildings deep within the Tempest. A single prominent jade road connects the palace with the \nShadowlands. Yu Huang moves his residence and chambers fromone building to the next without \nwarning, driven by constant paranoia and fear. A separate staff unit specializes in keeping track \nof his whereabouts for urgent reports. The Four Branches maintain their headquarters in the Jade \nPalace as well. \nOfficials at all levels receive salaries, but they’re not paid enough to cover their actual \nexpenses, let alone the social displays expected of them. Ironclad custom requires subordinates to \ngive “gifts” to their superiors, and citizens offer “gifts in appreciation for service” to officials. This \nuniversal pattern of bribery isn’t considered immoral unless it gets really, profoundly out of hand \nor officials take payments without providing appropriate service in response. \nTHOSE \nWHO RULE \nThe specific proper names given for the branch leaders in this section come fromDark \nKingdom of Jade. Feel free to change them for your own chronicle, if you want to give a \ndifferent flavor to the relations between branches and their respective styles of operation. \nT H E  \nEOUR BRANCHES \nThe Jade Censors keep track of the resources of the kingdom. They supervise Reaping, tally \nArtifacts and relics and review the allocation of raw materials. The Emperor guarantees families \nthe right to Reap their own kin, but in practice an endless network of regulations and judgments \nmakes it impossible to maintain consistency. Ideally, a local Censor takes part in every decision \nabout a wraithrquote s fate before its Caul comes off. Corruption, ambition, greed and laziness all \ncomplicate the reality. The Censor can assign a wraith to its family, another group in the \n\n\nadministrative region or even take it into personal custody. Likewise, every relic theoretically \ncarries an imperial stamp of approval and authorization before ending up in someone’s hands for \nvery long. The Censors get busiest in times of war and natural disaster in the Skinlands; crises bring \nout both the worst and the best in the Branch. Hu Ji, a woman of unknown mortal antecedents, \nruns the Branch. She’s personally wealthy and therefore free from most temptations to yield to \npowerful families, but she’s not so secure as to be entirely sure she enjoys the Emperor’s support. \nThe Judges of the Dead make sure that Jade laws apply fairly and consistently. As Han Fei’s \nprinciples suggest, justice itself isn! te t a primary concern: Any system applied consistently suffices \nto create a Legalist social order. The Judges monopolize law enforcement among civilians, but they \nmay be required to yield to the Military in wartime and crisis. In accordance with Chinese \ntradition, the judge conducts his own investigation, combining the functions that Westem justice \nseparates out among judges, prosecutors and police. The Judge also holds the authority to carry out \nhis recommended punishment, though appeal up the chain of command is possible. Judges require \nmore assistants as their territory widens, and commandery and provincial judges personally try \nonly the most important (or interesting) cases. Li Gao has directed the Judges for three centuries \nand enjoys the closest relations with the Emperor. He’s known for punishing and purging Judges \nwho show too much sympathy or other incompetence. \nThe Protectorate of the Prosperous Realm seeks out sedition among citizens and corrup- \ntion among officials. Protectors enjoy very broad authority to investigate anything that looks like \na possible violation of Jade law. Since almost everything is a violation of some sufficiently obscure \nedict, Protectors can punish nearly anyone at any time. Nobody can keep them out, and lying to \nthem constitutes an admission of guilt. They cannot impose sentence - \nthat’s the realm of the \nJudges, Censors or Military depending on the nature of the offense - \nbut their recommendations \nusually find acceptance. Formal trials don’t always happen. Everything from Buddhist proselytiz- \ning to questioning the divinity of the Emperor can bring Protector attention down on lowly souls. \nFan Wushang has directed the Protectorate for 1500years. While he enjoys the Emperor’s support, \nhe also keeps himself personally at adistance so that the Protectorate does not seem merely an arm \nof imperial whim. \nThe Military makes the Emperor’s wishes known by corporeal force. Military units include \ninfantry, cavalry, navy and (in more recent times) mechanized forces of all kind. Most soldiers \nvolunteer for terms of a few years, as being a veteran opens doors for the rest of a wraith‘s existence \nand brings honor to one’s family. Some duties, like patrolling major highways in the heart of &e \nkingdom, pass without stress or risk. Others, like policing bad neighborhoods in the Occupied \nTerritories, consume tremendous numbers of soldiers, which makes even the compensatory \nopportunities for personal looting look less desirable. Peng Xin, hero of the wars with Stygia, \noversees all military force in the empire ... except the Immortal Guard, who answer only to the \nEmperor. \nE A M I L I E S  \nFamily provides the basis of identity in the Yellow Springs. In the face of a vast imperial \nhierarchy, family provides shelter, purpose, protection and support. Family members look after \neach other’s interests - \none well-placed official can arrange contracts and patronage for many \nneedy relatives. Yellow Springs “families” were all actually composed of true family members in \nolder times, but in the modemday, these families comprisegatherings ofwraiths linked by attitude, \nworldview or interest rather than lineage. The Communist campaign against traditional supersti- \ntion and the chaos of modernization separated many wraiths from their lineages. When they \nemerged in theshadowlands, they formed their owngatherings toprovide thesamesort ofservices \nthat the oldfamiliesdid. Tension betweenoldfamiliesandnew drivespolitical agendas at all’---’- \nof government and in society at large. \nT H C  \nDABK K I N D O M O ~  \nJ A D E  \n6b \n\n\nC O N E L I C T S  \nEvery government faces some discontent among its subjects. Even though Chinese tradition \ngenerally encourages subservience or at least passive dissent and withdrawal, rebellion has old \nroots as well. Challengingrulers who no longer enjoy Heaven’s mandate to govern is anestablished \nrole for the virtuous rebel, and few rebels rush to think of themselves as anything other than \nvirtuous. Any citizen with a grievance might become an outlaw, though the vast majority don’t. \nThe Occupied Territories host more organized resistance movements. Japan and Tibet in \nparticular challenge imperial power, and they require constant suppression. See World of \nDarkness: Tokyo for a detailed discussion of Japanese efforts to throw off Jade rule. In addition, \npersistent rumors about the Emperor’s nature encourage dissent that might turn violent. It’s a \nmatter of history that early in his reign, Yu Huang descended into the Tempest and fought the \nMalfean Lung Wang. The official story is that Yu Huang triumphed, seizing Lung Wang’s power \nand possessions for his own. Persistent rumor says that Lung Wang won and uses the Emperor’s skin \nfor his own nefarious agenda, whatever it may be. Everyone agrees that the Emperor’s might \ntranscends that of any other wraith. The question is simply whether that’s because of his powers \ntaken by conquest or because he’s actually a master demon in human disguise. \nThe Jade Kingdom and Stygia do not get along well. Ever since the Russo-Japanese War at \nthe beginning of the 20th century, there’s been nearly constant conflict. In the 193Os, minor \nskirmishes escalated to all-out war, with the Jade fleet invading along unsuspected Byways to sack \nBoston. The war ended not long before the outbreak of the Fifth Great Maelstrom and weakened \nboth governments’ ability to respond to the storm. Tensions have risen steadily ever since, and \nobservers on all side predict a fresh conflict soon \nTo Jade wraiths, Stygians seem barbarous at best. They have little social order, no proper \nappreciation of family, no sense of piety. It’s easy for a cultured inhabitant of the Yellow Springs \nto see the typical Stygian !as little better than an articulate kueis . Jade wraiths usually strike \nStygians as confusing, elitist and deeply, offensively smug. \nJ A D E B Y T H E  NUMBERS \nThis sectioncovers the actualmechanicsofcreatingandplaying Jadewraiths.For additional \nsetting material, refer to Dark Kingdom of Jade.

Security forces tighten traffic across the borders, and suspected \nspies face angry mobs in addition to official interrogation. Levies on relics and souls for the \nforges rise constantly - \nin the Occupied Territories whole Necropoli become depopulated \nto fuel the war machine. Reserve military units all go to active status and fresh draft levies \nsweep more and more able-bodied wraiths into the army. \nThen comes the invasion itself. After that. ... \nIf you want to use the “official” White Wolf story line, the empire falls into chaos. Yu \nHuang loses much of his army and nearly all of his best forces, thanks to defective transports \nand the outbreak of the Great Maelstrom. Suddenly overwhelmed and outnumbered, \ngarrisons in the OccupiedTerritories crumble in the face of slave revolts. Within the Yellow \nSprings, threats to the integrity of the realm may lead Yu Huang to inadvertently reveal his \ntrue nature. If that happens, it’sall over for the Emporer. Even ifYu Huang’s identity remains \nintact, rebel movements exploit the invasion’s failure as a sign that Heaven no longer favors \nhim. \nYour chronicle can develop in other ways. Perhaps the invasion succeeds gloriously. \nPerhaps it still ends in failure but the troops manage an orderly withdrawal. Perhaps the \nGreat Maelstrom hits the Yellow Springs harder or more lightly than in “canon.” The time \nis ripe forchange, but youshould make thechanges suit your chroniclerather than force your \ngame into a single mold. \n\n\nT H E  W A Y O E T H E  \nSCHOLAR \nWraiths practicing the Way of the Scholar develop their hun so to understand and control \nthe minds of others.

Ifsuccessful, the wraithcan tell ifher target lies during the next \nInquiry: The Scholar can force the subject to answer one questiontruthfully. The subject \nmay use some misdirection and partial truths, but no direct falsehoods. \nSystem: Spend one Pathos and make a Social Test to get an honest answer to one question. \nPrecision in phrasing counts. \nIntermediate Abilities \nWord of Yu Huang: The Scholar may issue a single command to the subject. As with \nInquiry, the formulationmatters, as the subject may exploit loopholes and ambiguity. The subject \nmay not be ordered to perform a self-destructive act. \nSystem: Spend one Pathos and make a Social Test. Ifsuccessful, the Scholar may issue aone- \nword command. This command can be “Hold” or something of the sort, making the subject stand \nstill long enough to use Word of Yu Huang again at a cost of one Pathos. If this second attempt \nsucceeds, the Scholar may give a one-sentence order for each point of his current temporary \nWillpower. The subject must make a separate Mental Test to notice the command being given. \nOtherwise, the instructions seem to arise from within. \nFilial Duty: The Scholar instills an urge to cooperate into the subject, making the Scholar \nas valued to the subject as a dear and honored family member. The subject won’t abandon previous \nconvictions, but he will help the Scholar in all other ways. \nSystem: Spend three Pathos and one Willpower, and make an Extended Social Test. The \nScholar’s command remains in effect for three hours, plus one for each success on the extended \ntest. The subject does realize what’s been done to him once the effect wears off. \nto learn all other subjects. \nAdvanced Ability \nThe Emperor’s Servant: The Scholar masters the intricacies of manipulating the hun, and \ncan control the minds of others fully. This art allows her to implant permanent orders. \nSystem: The Scholar must spend a full day with the subject (usually represented over the \ndowntime between games), spend three Pathos and one Willpower and make a Social Test. If \nsuccessful, the target may implant an idea that can be summarized in one sentence. The Scholar \nmay make successive tests to increase the complexity of the idea implanted: A paragraph requires \ntwo tests, a page’s worth of material requires three tests, a chapter’s worth requires four tests and \na whole book‘s worth of instructions requires five tests.

A11 Artisan arts carry a risk of failure. If the Artisan fails in the initial challenge, he must \nmake a Simple Test. If he fails that test, then the material he’s working with acquires flaws that \nmake it useless for any task. \nInnate Ability \nHear Jade’s Tale: The Artisan begins by learning how to evaluate an Artifact’s powers \nSystem: Win a Simple Test to learn this information. \nBasic Abilities \nShape True Jade: Only Artisans know how to work with True Jade, widely thought to be \npart of the Universe’s soul in solid form. \nSystem: Make a Mental Test against a difficulty determined by the Storyteller to reshape a \npiece of True Jade into any simple form. Very complex or precise forms may require further \nchallenges, at the Storyteller’s discretion. \nWork White Jade: White Jade, made of transformed human souls, lacks True Jade’s \nstrength and malleability. Working with it requires extra care and three times as much material \nto produce the same result. \nand the condition of its soul before forging. \nSystem: Same as for Shape True Jade. \nIntermediate Abilities \nRework Relics: More experienced Artisans can rework material that was never a soul. \nSystem: Make a Static Physical Test against a difficulty determined by the Storyteller to \nchange a relic’s form. Changing the relic’s material requires three consecutive successes. \nEmpower Jade: The Artisan can draw forth latent potential from her material and imbue \nit with Pathos and Arcanoi. The Artisan can store the powers of one Arcanos and the Pathos to \nuse it. Unless she knows the Way of the Merchant, she can use only her own Arcanoi and Pathos. \nSystem: Spend three Pathos, plus the Pathos to be stored in the item, and make a Static \nMental Test against a set difficulty. True Jade retains its powers indefinitely; White Jade loses its \npowers over time. Each month the Artisan must repeat the challenge (without Pathos cost) to \nprevent the stored powers from beginning to leak out. Once the leak starts, the Artifact loses one \nPathos and one level of ability per month. \nAdvanced Ability \nCreate White Jade: The pinnacle of the Artisan’s skill is the creation of White Jade from \ncaptive souls. First, the subject’s Willpower and Pathos must he reduced to zero, then the Artisan \nspends three days transforming the subject’s Corpus into White Jade. The Artisan must decide in \nadvance whether the subject will become hard (suitable for weapons, containers and armor) or soft \n(suitable for parchment, furniture and clothing). \nSystem: Make a series of 15 Social Tests, representing a total of three days of work. If the \nArtisan accumulates a total of 10 or more successes, the subject becomes White Jade. Ea!ch level \nof Corpus yields about three pounds of White Jade. \nTHE \nWAYOETHE \nEABMEE \nWhile Scholars work on the hun, the Farmer learns to cultivate the p’o.

The mortal can \nspend one point to reduce the difficulty of a single challenge by two Traits, two points for a retest \non asingle challenge and three points to regain a point of Willpower. A mortal can gain only three \npoints of Pathos at any given time through this art. \nSystem: The Merchant must be within five feet of the mortal target but need not be manifest \nin theskinlands. SpendaPathosandaWillpowerandmakeaStaticSocialTestagainst adifficulty \nof the local Shroud rating + the number of Pathos points to be transferred. \nAdvanced Ability \nMint Money: The Merchant can convert her own Pathos into corporeal form: strings of \ncoins, wads of paper money and other tokens of value. Some Merchants create unique manifes- \ntations so as to build up a “house reputation” for their work. \nSystem: Spend two Pathos and one Willpower, and make a Social Test with a difficulty of \nsix Traits + the Pathos points being converted. The money lasts one day per point of Pathos the \nMerchant possesses after completing the challenge. \nTHE \nWAYOETHE \nSOUL \nThe other standard Jade Arcanoi draw on Confucian beliefs; the Way of the Soul expresses \nDaoist ideas. Jade denizens turn inward to subdue the noubledp’o rather than summoning outside \nassistance as Stygians do with Castigators. \nTHE \nDAEK \nK I N D O M O P  \nJ A D E  \ne \n\n\nInnate Ability \nNegotiation: Students of the Way of the Soul learn how to calm the p’o by persuasion as \nwell as force. It’s risky, as efforts at calm may backfire and rile the p’o that much more. \nSystem: When a wraith feels himself about to lose control of his hun, he can engage in \nNegotiation. Make astatic WillpowerTest against thep’o’spermanent Angst. Successmeans that \nthe p’o loses a point of temporary Angst and cannot attempt to seize control until gaining another. \nFailure grants the p’o a point of temporary Angst. \nBasic Abilities \nCoax: This art lets the wraith modify the number of Shadow Traits her p’o offers. \nSystem: Make an opposed test of the wraith’s Social Traits against the p’o’s current Angst. \nIf successful, the wraith forces the p’o to make a Shadow Bid (see Oblivion, p. 172). On failure, \nthe p’o need spend no Angst. \nNullify Thorns: The wraith can deny his p’o access to a particular Thorn temporarily. \nSystem: Spend a point of Pathos and make a Physical Test against the p’o’s current Angst. \nIf successful, the wraith picks a single Thorn that the p’o cannot use for the next half hour. The \nwraith can repeat this Challenge every half hour without further Pathos cost. \nIntermediate Abilities \nGive Higher Passions: The wraith infuses some ofher own passions into the p’o, replacing \nSystem: SpendtwoPathos and make anExtended SocialTest against thep’o’scurrent Angst \nplus two Traits. If successful, the wraith can pick one Dark Passion to be replaced by one of the \nwraith‘s own passions for one day per success. The wraith doesn’t lose access to the passion during \nthis time. \nAlter Demeanor: The wraith can force the p’o to adopt a new pattern of behavior, either \na different Shadow Archetype or even a Psyche Nature. By a combination of persuasion and \nintimidation, the wraith briefly ele!vates the p’o’s attention. \nSystem: Spend three Pathos and make a Static Social Test against a difficulty of the p’o’s \ncurrent Angst plus four. If successful, the wraith forces a new nature onto the p’o that remains in \neffect for one hour per point of current Pathos. On failure, the p’o gains one Angst, and the player \nmakes a Simple Test. If that test fails, the p’o gains three temporary Angst and one permanent \nAngst. \none of its Dark Passions. \nAdvanced Ability \nInner Peace: The wraith joins forces with the p’o, subverting the p’o’s own agenda in the \nprocess of yielding some Psyche control. \nSystem: Make a Willpower Test against the p’o’s current Angst. If successful, the hun \npartially fuses itself with the p’o. It can gain Pathos from Dark Passions as well as Passions, and it \ncan use the 0’0’s Thorns and Dark Arcanoi as well as it’s own Arcanoi. The hun can spend both \nAngst and Pathos as necessary. The fusion ends when the p’o’s current Angst reaches zero. If the \nhun fails the initial test, make a Simple Test. If that test fails, the p’o takes immediate control and \ngains three temporary Angst. \nC H A I N S O P T H E  \n€ M P E B O B  \nThe Immortal Guard uses this Arcanos to help maintain their discipline. Its arts subdue \nrather than destroy, allowing Yu Huang’s administration to enforce the harshest justice. Only the \nGuardsmen learn this Arcanos, though ru!mors sometimes circulate to the contrary. \nInnate Ability \nSoul Anchor: Chains of the Emperor conflicts directly with Argos, and Guardsmen learn \nto sense uses of Argos within 50 feet of themselves. \n\n\nSystem: Make a Mental Challenge to detect another wraith's use of Argos within 50 feet. \nIt provides a general sense of the Enshrouded individual's whereabouts and pinpoints any other \nArgos user. \nBasic Abilities \nBrilliance: The Guardsman's painted skin glows even more vividly than usual, filling the \nShadowlands' darkness with an inhuman rendition of the glories of day. \nSystem: Spend one Pathos. The Guardsman brightens over the course of three turns. At full \nbrilliance, everyone in the area who looks anywhere near the Guardsman must win or tie a Static \nPhysical Test to avoid blindness. Attacks against the Guardsman are at a Trait penalty of one for \nthe first two rounds, and an additional two every round thereafter. Brilliance lasts for only five \nturns, but the Guardsman can renew it at his discretion. \nShackles: The Guardsman transforms some of his own Corpus into bindings for the feet \nor hands of an immobilized opponent. They cannot be removed by anyone but a Guardsman \nexcept through Moliate. \nSystem: Spend two Corpus and one Pathos. It takes one round to put Shackles on a foe \nimmobilized by one means or another; the target must be stationary while the Guardsman fits the \nshackles. \nIntermediate Abilities \nSnare: A Guardsman can reach out to cancel Argos arts used by others. \nSystem: While in corporeal contact with a Guardsman, a wraith must first win a Physical \nLariat: This art is similar to Shackle, but it can be used at distances up to 50 feet. \nSystem: Spend two Corpus and one Pathos and take a turn to prepare. Then make a Physical \nAdvanced Ability \nNet: This effect extends Shackles even further, encompassing a whole group of targets up \nto 20 feet away from the Guardsman. \nSystem: Spend three Pathos to create a colorful webbing 12 feet in diameter. The \nGuardsman then throws it. Anyone within the targeted area must make a Physical Test to avoid \ngetting entangled. Once caught, a victim must win four Physical Challenges in a row against the \nGuardsman. True Jade cuts the net, but White Jade does not. \nTest before using any Argos art. \nChallenge. If successful, the Guardsman's target falls trapped as if by Shackles. \nTHE \nDARK \nK I N D O M O P  \nJADE \n@ \n_ _  \n.. \n_. \n_.__I_ - \n\n\nMAY DAY! \nby Lindsay Woodcock \nAN OBLIVION \nA D V E N T U R E  I N  T H R E E  PARTS \nPRELUDE \nEvents that began their inexorable course in Parts One and Two of this story are finally \ncoming to a head. This chapter lets your Oblivion troupe participate in the making of Shadowlands \nhistory. In Part One (“Ambassador”), the circle met TadashiNakagawa, aYellow Springs emissary \ncarryingarelicwakizmhiand anoddlist ofnamesofStygianHeretics (bothoutspokenandcovert). \nHowever, Nakagawa mysteriously dropped into a Harrowing before he could divulge any \ninformation on why he was carrying the relic or the list. The only clue to his real mission was a \nscrap of paper reading, “Find optimal points; solidify alliances; look for the unblinking.” The \ncharacters may have even discovered that the relic was somehow tainted, infecting its user with \ntemporary Angst. \nIn Part Two of the chronicle (“Deployment”), the circle discovered that the list of names \nof Heretics that Nakagawa was carrying comprised a Heretic cult acting in collusion with the Dark \nKingdom ofJade. The cult, with members scattered throughout the Dark Kingdom of Iron, has laid \nthe groundwork for an invasion, and that invasion is imminent and inevitable. In discovering this \ninformation, the circle may have gone to the Hierarchy, the Renegades beyond the walls of the \nNecropolis or even the Heretics themselves. No matter where they’ve gone, the wraiths are likely \nto have stepped on some toes and made some enemies. \nNow the wakizmhi is still on the loose, the Jade forces are at the gates, and an ill wind has \nbegun to blow and scrape outside the citadel walls.. .. \nS O M E  \nTECHNICAL \nNOTES \nNo ready-made adventure could possibly account for player creativity, Narrator preference, \nor even pure chance; there are just too many variables to make for a single story that will work for \neveryone. Flexibility is essential. Keeping that in mind, each installment of the adventure is \nbroken into individual scenes. The scenes are then divided into two sections: Hard Info and \nChoices. \nHard Info is just what it might appear: facts, events, and information that must, somehow, \noccur or be revealed for the adventure to run as planned. How you work it into the story is largely \nup to you as Storyteller, but it needs to get in there. Feel free to use existing social structures, \nNarrator characters or your favorite plot devices to deliver this information. \nChoices are, again, just what they might appear. They spell out some of the things wraith \ncharacters might do in reaction to the Hard Info, plus some of the ways the story would be affected \nby character actions. The Choices account for the story’s flexibility as characters, both Narrator \nand player, drive the plot. As long as the skeleton of the adventure a3 the Hard Info ae is intact, \ndon’t worry about forcing the flesh into any particular shape. Let the players play their characters. \nYour only job is to emphasize drama and suspense. \nBy the way, the rest of this information is for Storyteller’s only, unless you want to spoil the \nsurprise of what’s going to happen next. \nPART \nTHREE: \nINVASION \nS U g g E S T I O N S  \nUnless your own version of this story calls for them, you won’t need any special props to \nadvance the plot, other than the relic wukizashi delivered by Nakagawa in Part One of the \nchronicle. You might consider re-introducing Nakagawa to the action, but unless you can come \nup with a convincing reason for how he has managed to make it all the way back to the location \nof your game from the Shadowlands of Japan (to which he returned after his Harrowing), you don’t \n\n\nhave to. You could bring back Joseph Sauvant (the Hierarchy agent assigned to monitor the \nwraiths after they approached Hierarchy representatives with their information or suspicions - \nif they did so) as well, although he plays no special role in the events as they’re written. \nS C E N E  \nONE \nHard Info: \nBefore the scene gets started, characters may notice the wind picking up and the screaming \nbehind that wind. Perception-based Static Challenges may be made, or Narrators may decide \narbitrarily who notices. What savvy observers should be able to figure out is that there’s a \nMaelstrom brewing, and it’s going to be big. At the same time, the armies of the Yellow Springs, \nlong on the march, are finally within striking-distance of the Stygian empire. Forces are aimed at \nStygia itself, and the air of growing tension should be palpable. Everyone’s waiting for something \nto happen, and the Maelstrom is getting closer.. .. \nChoices: \nIf one of the characters recognizes the brewing Maelstrom for what it is, the Circle might \nchoose to hole up in a strong Haunt early and try to hide from the Jade invaders. Should there be \nno Pardoner in the Circle or in the group’s allies, the characters may be able to reason with a \nRenegade Pardoner or a friendly Hierarchy one. \nIf the characters are outside their city, they might be faced with entire warships popping out \nof Nihils. Also, if there are city gates, the first line of defense against a Maelstrom or invasion is \ngoing to be that wall and those gates. The wraiths better hurry if they want to get inside. If they \nfeel like it, let them try to convince Renegades or Heretics outside to join them inside where it’s \n“safe.” They may have trouble talking their way past the city guards, but base the amount of static \nthey get on how well they roleplay. \nSome enterprising (or suicidally insane) characters may even try to bargain/ negotiate with \nrepresentatives of the Jade army, but do not let this tactic succeed unless the speaker happens to \nbe carrying the relic wakimshi Nakagawadelivered in Part One. Under no other circumstances will \nthe Jade wraiths listen, and the relic will only keep the Jade wraith troops from slaying those \ncharacters immediately present. They will still be kept prisoner in the army’s camp. \nS C F N E  Two \nHard Info: \nThis scene serves as exposition for whatever information the characters may have missed \nthus far. It should come out in the wash that Nakagawa was nothing more than a Jade-Kingdom \nspy, on the lookout for the Heretic cult responsible for opening the city to invasion. The relic \nwakizashi he carried was to be delivered to a stronghold of that cult and displayed as a symbol for \nJade troops to pass over that location in their attack. Ferret out any cult spies who may have \ninfiltrated the Hierarchy (and who, likely, have been trying to get rid of the characters who “know \ntoo much”). Set this discovery scene against the rising tide of the Maelstrom winds and the \nrevelation that something huge and unexpected has just happened to upset the boundary between \nthe Labyrinth and the Tempest (see Ends of Empire to find out exactly what it is). \nChoices: \nThe choices in this scene revolve around how you deliver this information. If your characters \nare in the camp of the invading army, perhaps a too-proud captain of the military spills the beans. \nA series of interrogations and/ or torture sessions can reveal the necessary gems within the safety \nof the Hierarchy. Outside the walls, a crusty Renegade veteran of the Underworld may have \ndiscovered the conspiracy and have been all too happy to tell the characters about it, in exchange \nfor their putting a good word in for him with the Hierarchs. (After all, it was the Renegades who \ndestroyed one of Nakagawa’s fetters in Part One, hoping to stop him before he accomplished his \nmission.) \nHowever, once all this information has been relayed, there’s no time left to do anything \nabout it. \n\n\nS C E N E  \nTHREE \nHard Info: \nThe other shoe drops, the last straw falls and all hell breaks loose. The timing of this scene \nis ultimately up to you, but starting it as soon after the preceding scene as possible is best. What \nhappens is simply this: All that hangs in the balance comes crashing down in waves of destruction \nand violence. \nThe Jade armies march on the StygianNecropoli, destroying the walls, the buildings and any \nwraiths the troops can get a hold of. Any prisoners taken will be soulforged, and any building left \nstanding will be occupied by Jade forces. The only building left alone will be the one displaying \nNakagawa’s wukizashi, which is only recognizable by the taint it carries. \nWorse yet, the Maelstrom begins shortly on the heels of the invasion. However, this storm \nis no scattered shower on the Stygian front. The howling winds (and concomitant Spectre hordes) \nherald the coming of the Sixth Great Maelstrom. Nihils the size ofcandlestick Park rip open, and \nthe worst of unimaginable foes flood the Underworld from the very mouth of Oblivion. The events \nleadingupto thestartoftheMaelstromhave beenset inmotionoff-stageand areunstoppable (see \nEnds of Empire), and now it’s right in the characters’ lap. \nThere has never been a Maelstrom this big before, so play it to the utmost. Destruction rains \n(or reigns) everywhere, playing havoc with both sides of the Stygia-Jade Kingdom battles. The \nscreams are deafening, and the silence is ear-splitting. There is nowhere to run. \n. \nChoices: \nThe greatest choices in this scene revolve around your descriptions of the carnage wrought \nby the two-fold invasion. Find out what forces ofnature scare your players and unleash those forces. \nGreat Maelstroms are destruction incarnate, so make them feel it. Make themfear it. If they can’t \nfind somewhere to hide in a reasonable amount of time, wipe them out. Make them choose who \nthey’ll count on to survive, who’ll they’ll cut off from safety if needs be and which ports they’ll run \nto in the storm. \nIf they try to hole up in a Haunt, how will they defend it from Jade wraiths and Spectres? If \nthey run to the Hierarchy, will they aid in defending the walls, or will they aid in the fighting that \nwill inevitably go on in the streets? Or will they simply hide in a deep, dark hole until the violence \npasses? \nIt’s also possible to run a scenario in which members of the Hierarchy have discovered the \nsignificance of Nakagawa’s wakizashi, and different factions are scrambling to get possession of it \nbefore the Jade army breaches the walls. \nAnd finally, you may even consider scenes of cooperation between the Stygian forces and \nJade forces. Not every Jade Kingdom wraith on the attack is expecting a horde of Spectres at their \nbacks, and in panic, they may side with their erstwhile adversaries to ride out the storm. \nS C E N E  \nEOUE \nHard Info: \nAfter some indeterminate amount of time (days, weeks, hours, years?) the Great Maelstrom \nwinds subside. The Spectres slink back into their holes, and the wave of destruction dies down. \nAt some point, the characters who have survived should crawl from wherever they’ve holed up to \nsurvey what’s Left of their world. \nChoices: \nAt this point, the choices are all yours. Decide how long the Great Maelstrom has lasted. \nDecide how muchof the setting is left intact. Decide who hassurvived. Decide if the Jade Invasion \nFleet is still on the move. It’s all up to you. \nIf you need help deciding what to do now, see Rich Dansky’s article on that subject on page \n63 of this issue of the Journal. \n\n\nIT’S THF F N D  Ofi THF \nWORLD! WHAT RO I DO \nby Rich Dansky \nA subtle word of warning: This article is rife with spoilers. Left, right and center, \nyou can’t throw a dart at this article without hitting some piece of information specific \nto Wraithcontinuity thatjustmybeyoudidn’twantto know. When youreadthe book \nEnds of Empire, you’ll see what I mean. If you’d rather wait and see what happens \nin Wraith continuity first (before you declde to foist it onto your poor, unsuspecting \nplayers), read that book before you read this article. Some serious goings-on are afoot \nthere, and this article relates them in digest form. \nNow, with that proviso in mind, you may skip this box and proceed to the rest of \nthe article. Jwt don’t say I didn’t warn you. \n\n\nOn a more serious note, delaying the events of Ends of Empire indefinitely can \nbe an eminently workable solution. After all, if you’ve spent months setting up plot \nlines that revolve around the characters’ involvement in one of the Smiling Lord’s \nmultifarious plots, it’s going to be profoundly unsatisfying for your players to have all \nof that swept away. They’ve put in the time, the effort and the passion of unraveling \nthe plot, and they deserve the chance to resolve it. \nThat doesn’t mean, however, that it’s necessarily a good thing to hold back the \ntide of time indefinitely. \nWhile it’s a good idea to allow any existing plot lines that would be truncated \nby Ends of Empire to wind down gracefully, it’s an even better one not to Start up \nnew threads that will pose the same problem down the road. Instead, think about \nplots that can survive or even be enhanced by the coming Great Maelstrom. Even \nif you don’t have any concrete ideas for stories that can be extended that way, you \ncan lay the groundwork for post-Maelstrom chronicles. \nStart introducing Narrator characters who’ll be important once the fertilizer \nhits the rotary ventilation device. Good ideas include Renegades with good survival \nskills for hostile conditions. Harbingers who’ll be able to get characters through \nMaelstrom conditions, or even a tough-as-nails Legionnaire who can be counted on \nto defend the Necropolis against Spectres, regardless of who’s in charge. Lay in in- \ngame ways for characters to get their hands on the necessities of unlife - \nrelics, \nArtifacts, soulfire - \nonce things get crazy. (Indeed, this concept can make for a \nwonderful lead-in plot thread: The Grim Legion is hoarding stockpiles of all sorts of \ngoodies; where are all the supplies going, and why?) Omens, signs and portents are \nyour friends - \nFatalism offers a handy way to start laying on the foreshadowing \neffectively. Having a bunch of wraiths who call themselves “Oracles” around can’t \nhurt matters, either, when it comes to lining up news of the future. Increase Spectral \nactivity - \nor have it disappear altogether and watch everyone get nervous. Send a \nFerryman into towndispensing knowledge or even gifts that have no obvious bearing \nnow, but which will be very useful once the walls come tumbling down (and in the \nmeantime, no doubt there will be a mad scramble between characters to figure out \nwho got what and why). Send out more Narrators to Shadowguide and have them \nplay matters a trifle more excited than usual. A Jade wraith who’s in the Necropolis \nto scout for the upcoming invasion can make an excellent Narrator character as well. \nTurn her loose and see if anyone catches her. All of these ideas can lead plots and \ncharacters toward the events of Ends of Empire before the actual storm, both literal \nand figurative, hits. \n11. HOLD ONTOTHE \nMOMENT \nThe fall of Enoch and the events after it take, at most, a few days. Once the \nStygian fleet anchors off the coast of the mysterious black city, the sequence of \ncalamities becomes both inevitable and swift. However, it’s highly unlikely that you \nor your Storytelling team is going to want to gear up for a 96-hour continuous \nOblivion marathon session, one which ranges from Enoch to the Necropoli to Stygia \nand beyond. (I mean, if you really really want to, I’m not going to stop you, but you’re \nresponsible for the Vivarin, the Jolt! and the nervous tics that you and your Narrators \nrack up.) \nOn the other hand, those 96 hours or so are pretty jam-packed with action. A \nlot happens: Two nuclear detonations, a Great Maelstrom, a pair of invasions, the \n\n\nreturn of Charon, the revelation of the Mnemoi, the end of the Deathlords and more. \nThat’s a whole lot of plot. Do you really want to have all of that happening offstage? \nInstead, why not get your game involved in the epic events that are reshaping \nthe Underworld? You don’t necessarily have to run all of the pivotal moments - \nafter all, it’s going to be hard to find a rationale to shift your entire troupe from Enoch \nto a Necropolis to Stygia in the time frame available - \nbut you can pick and choose \nyour spots. If your chronicle has been set in a Necropolis, there’s no reason that you \ncan’t divert some of the Jade invasion of Stygia to your game’s gates. Furthermore, \nthere’s nothing that says that the entire invasion has to be wrapped up in a single \nsession. This is a pivotal moment in the history of the Underworld, and, to quote \nLittle Nell, “Slowly, slowly, it’s too nice a job to rush.” An invasion is rarely the sort \nof thing that gets wrapped up in a couple of hours. There’s plenty of material - \nguerilla combat, active resistance, infiltrating enemy command, sabotage, deal- \nmaking and more - \nto keep the plot simmering for session after session. After all, \nthe Sixth Great Maelstrom arrives on your schedule, not ours. \nFurthermore, no one says you have to stop at one high point. If the defense-of- \nthe-Necropolis plot is going well, maybe your players are indicating that they’d like \nto keep the action at home. There are plenty of ways, from counterattacks to going \nunderground to having characters sell out, to extend the moment. There’s no reason \nto move past a setting that’s working well, after all. You can drag this out as long as \nyou need to in order to satisfy your players. \nOn the other hand, perhaps the local wraiths might be interested in marching \noff to Stygia to defend the seat of Empire. That development would allow you to set \nup encounters in the Tempest on the way to the Isle of Sorrows as well as integrating \nthe later events of Ends of Empire into your story line. There are plenty of exciting \nscenes in the story “The Last Danse Macabre” that can be integrated into Oblivion \ngames easily enough. Why not give them a shot? \nI I I .  THE LAST DANSE \nMACABRE \nEnds of Empire does include an extended story entitled “The Last Danse \nMacabre,” which details the return of Charon to the Underworld, the coming of the \nSixth Great Maelstrom and the final fate of Stygia. The story is designed for tabletop \nplay, but there is certainly a great deal of material in it that can be lifted and \nconverted into a live-action scenario. In other words, it is entirely possible to run an \nOblivion chronicle through the events of the tabletop story. \nThere really is only one major hang-up with translating “The Last Danse \nMacabre” directly, that being the fact that the story is written for a maximum of six \ncharacters. If you’ve got a 40 person game, trying to squeeze all of them into the \nconference room at the top of the Onyx Tower to witness Charon’s re-assumption \nof power (Oops? Was that another spoiler? Silly me) might be a little difficult to \nnarrate. On the other hand, if you have a small game, or even just a small core of \nplayers who want to put some extra time in, you can very easily let them tread the \npath laid out in Ends of Empire. \nBear in mind, however, that if you do want to translate “The Last Danse \nMacabre” over, it’s going to be a fair bit of work for you and your Narrators. There \nare quite a few Narrator characters who need to be onstage or at least accounted for \nat various points in the plot, ranging from Deathlords to Jade Empire soldiers to \nCharon himself. It’s also a scene-intensive story. The setting moves from Necropolis \nLondon (or whatever city you want to use) into the Tempest and then to Stygia. If \n\n\nyou run a game that relies on actually setting up game space to look appropriate for \nthe action, you’re letting yourself in for a ton of work here. That’s not to say don’t \ndo it, but be prepared for what “The Last Danse Macabre” requires from the people \nrunning it. \nIV. PALLDOWN \n90 BOOM \nBut let’s say you’re daring (or you’ve got a Spectre like Maxwell Carpenter \nlooking over your shoulder as you read this). Let’s say that you’ve got an appetite for \ndestruction, a yen for wreckage and way too strong an identification with the first \ntwo Road Warrior films. In other words, you want to blow up Enoch, zoom past the \nEnds of Empire and set up your Oblivion chronicle in the still-twitching wreckage \nof the Underworld. What then? \nThat’s when things get interesting. \nThe best thing about running a post-Enoch Oblivion chronicle is that you can \nmix and match whatever elements from traditional Wraith that you want to keep \nwith entirely new material. By the same token, you can throw out whatever bits of \nwraithly back-story don’t fit your idea of a game. Don’t like the Hierarchy? In your \nNecropolis, it’s gone, swept away by the storm. Hate the Dictum Mortuum? \nWhatever powers that be might well drop the ban, now that it’s unlikely that \nenforcers from the Isle of Sorrows are showing up to turn violators into ashtrays. \nDon’t like soulforging itself? The new regime outlaws it. And so it goes - \nthe post- \ndisaster Underworld is not a heterogeneous place. Each Necropolis is an island, and \nit can have its own rules, regulations and customs now that there’s no overseeing \nbody in place to enforce standards and practices. You just have to pick and choose \nwhat you want to keep. \nT H E  SETTING \nIf you’re going to run a game set apes ks deluge, you have to decide precisely \nwhat happened in your setting. Did the storm utterly lay waste to your Necropolis, \nor did the walls hold? Were there many casualties, or did everyone get under cover \n\n\nin time? Did the Jade Empire invade, or were you on the list of bypassed targets? If \nthere was damage to the Necropolis, what’s left, what was destroyed, and how did it \nget knocked down? Answering all of these questions and others like them (Who was \nlost in the defense? What resources were expended? Above all, what happened?) \nbefore you start play is a necessity. Otherwise, you’re confronted with the daunting \ntasks of making up history on the fly and keeping it straight every time someone asks \na question. Unless you start your setting with a strong foundation, everything you \nbuild on it is going to be suspect. If you start with a clear, logical outline of your \nsetting’s recent history, you keep all of your Narrators on the same page. Further- \nmore, you make it easy to build on what’s already there. If you’re unsure of how badly \nthe Necropolis was damaged during the Maelstrom, you’re going to have a hard time \nwriting plots about Spectres hiding in the wrecked portions of the city. If you don’t \nknow if the city was invaded by the Jade Empire or not, you’re up the creek when your \nplayers start demanding to know where they can find 1eftoverTrue Jade Artifacts and \nlearn imperial Arcanoi, and so it goes. If you don’t know what’s happened, it’s that \nmuch harder to figure out what’s going to happen without tripping over your own \nfeet. \nAfter you’ve decided on the immediate history of your setting, you have to \npopulate it. Decide which wraiths are left as well as who was swept away by the tide \nof history. This question actually breaks down into other, equally vital ones. \nSpecifically, asking who’s left leads directly to asking who’s in charge, which does \nmore to set the tone of your game than perhaps anything else. Is the local Hierarchy \nstill in place, trying desperately to hold the pieces together? Have Renegades or \nHeretics taken over? Is there a Spectral presence in local politics, overt or covert? \nAnd what about refugees from Stygia? With the Isle destroyed, they have to go \nsomewhere. What are the odds that a bunch of high-and-mighty Gaunts pick your \ncity to start over in? Figuring out who’s in charge - \nwhich is primarily a function \nof which wraiths are left after the dust settles - \ndetermines how the Necropolis \noperates. A bunch of Hierarchs trying to maintain the status quo is going to insist \non a Dictum Mortuum, regulated Reaping or even more unsettling practices. If \nRenegades are in place, they may want none of these things - \nor they may discover \nthat being the new boss turns them into the old boss. Spectral authorities may lead \nto mysterious disappearances and the like. It’s up to you; there’s no right or wrong \nway to do it. Just make sure you have a clear idea of what you are doing before going \nany further. \nThe other aspect of figuring out the post-bellum population of your Necropolis \nis the general populace. Who’s left? Have the surrounding wraiths huddled into the \nCitadel for protection, or do they choose to brave the storm on their own? Is there \nastrong loyal-or disloyal-opposition to the current governing body?What about \nsmall factions like Guilds, Renegade gangs or Heretic cults? Are they present, and \nin what strength? By the same token, you need to figure out who isn’t there anymore. \nIf the city used to be a stronghold of the Grim Legion, but most of those soldiers were \nwiped out in one way or another, how are the survivors going to react? Will they \nrecruit desperately, cut deals with former subordinates or try to bluff it out?And how \nwill everyone else, especially those groups who have been waiting for those arrogant \nsonsabitches from the Grim Legion to get cut down to size, react with the newly \ndownsized military presence? Will there be an attempt at compromise until the \nNecropolis is strong enough to stand without every wraith standing shoulder to \nshoulder, or will old hatreds and jealousies boil over? \n\n\n.  . . \n. . . . . \nNaturally, this decision leads into the following question: How do the survivors \n(and I use the term loosely; we are talking about dead people here, after all) feel about \none another? Has the foxhole mentality of “put ’em through hell together and they’ll \ncome out bestest buddies” taken over for the duration of the crisis, or is each faction \ntaking the opportunity to pounce on weakened rivals? Certainly characters’ Shad- \nows should be taken into account when you’re pondering this question. A society \nliterally fueled by strong feeling is a prime breeding ground for vendettas. Remember \nalso that politics is not strictly a vertical exercise. There’s plenty of side-to-side \nconflict and maneuvering to play with as well. If the group on top is weak, odds are \nthat any ambitious factions are going to work on neutralizing or destroying the \ncompetition before making a play for the brass ring. That means that if you’ve got \nsurvivors of three Guilds that didn’t particularly get along in town, you may find \n- \nA QUICK \n~ U I D E T O  WHAT’S L E E T A E T E R T H E  \nSTORM \n.The Guilds \nMany of the Guilds lose their top leadership in the battle for Stygia, and \nthus, they are left somewhat aimless in the aftermath. Freed fromcharon’s ban, \nthe survivors of various Guilds do come out from under cover as their skills are \ndesperately needed, but lingering suspicion does remain. Five centuries of \npropaganda is a hard thing to overcome. \nNo Mnemoi are sighted after Stygia falls. \nDoomslayers \nMuch reduced in ranks, they’re on the defensive. A great many are \ndestroyed when the Martyr Knight commandery goes up in a cloud of Spectres, \nbut the survivors try desperately to get their orders back together. Few have the \nopportunity to go back into the Labyrinth, so they content themselves with \nputting their knowledge to work defending Necropoli. They are treated with a \nmixture of admiration and undisguised loathing. The former comes from \nwraiths who still see them as daring heroes; the latter comes from those who saw \nwhat their arrogance wrought on Stygia. \nThe Legions \nNot surprisingly, the Legions are greatly reduced in strength. The Deathlords \nare gone, and many Legionnaires have gone to their final reward defending the \nNecropoli or fighting among themselves when the Smiling Lord’s treachery is \nuncovered. Many wraiths have abandoned the Legions for fear of reprisal while \nothers have clung to their identity in the face of potential adversity. All of the \nremaining Legions recruit heavily where they may for obvious reasons. \nRenegades \nRenegades are hard hit, not by the Jade invasion, but rather by the Great \nMaelstrom. Most shelter in Haunts that are not strong enough to withstand the \nstorm winds, and casualties are immense. Many Renegades move into the \nNecropoli, either establishing Renegade governments or trying to blend in with \nthe local citizenry. Renegade politics is still highly factionalized, especially \nwithout a unifying enemy to give cause to override disagreements. \nHeretics \nHeretics suffer from the storm as Renegades do. Many set out to find the \nFar Shores. Others move into theNecroDolienmasse where thev form coherent \ncommunities - \nand power blocs. \n\n\nyourself Storytelling a tricornered gang war before anyone makes a play to unseat the \nlocal Hierarchy leftovers. Then again, freed from the Hierarchy’s laws, groups may \nfind common cause with strange bedfellows. Pardoners and Heretic groups may ally, \nfor example, or a strong surviving Legion might take Artificers and Alchemists \nunder its wing. Not everything needs to be reductio ad absurdum. After all, there’s \nevery chance that the local wraiths are working together to build the Necropolis \nbackup. Just make sure you’ve decided which way things are going and who’s headed \nin which direction. \nWHAT’S HAPPEN IN^. ? \nOnce you’ve established what happened and who’s left, the other major \nquestion is “What’s going on now?” Is the city beset by external or internal strife? Are \nthere Spectres at the gate - \nor inside the Citadel? Is there fighting in the streets, or \norder? What alliances have been formed and what enmities kindled? In other words, \nthis is where you lay the seeds for all of your plots. By doping out what’s actually \nhappening in the Necropolis, you set up what’s going to happen. If you decide that \nthe Spectral forces haunting the outside of the city are going to infiltrate, you \nestablish “find the traitor” and “who can be trusted?” plot lines. If you decide that \nthere’s a power vacuum at the top and various groups vying for control, you set up \nalliance-making and political stories. \nAnd so it goes. By answering these questions, you’re setting up your chronicle. \nYou know where it is, where it’s been and where it’s going. After that, it’s all just in \nthe details. \nV. THOSE \nPESKY \nDETAILS \nThere are certain other things you will need to take into account, aside from \nyour setting. If you’re running a game set while the Sixth Great Maelstrom is still \nhowling outside the door, you have to take that into account with your plot lines. \nOdds are, your Necropolis will be isolated, which means that plotlines about \nsquabbles with neighboring Necropoli and setting up peaceful communes outside \nthe walls will be difficult to maintain. That isolation also limits your potential in- \nplay origins for new characters. (If they’re not dying in town, how are they getting \nthere?) By the same token, you’re getting a ready-built plot generator in the form of \nthe Maelstrom winds. Anything from ancient relics to an endless supply of Spectres \ncan be dashed up against the Necropolis walls to provide conflict, antagonists and \nstory hooks. \nJust bear in mind that Great Maelstroms are serious stuff, not to be turned on \nand off at whim. If your players lose their respect for the power of the storm outside \nby being able to cavort in the great unliving outdoors at will, they’re going to lose \nmuch of the flavor of the setting. If, however, you just give them brief breaks in the \nstorm, small windows of opportunity for new arrivals or escapees to appear on the \nscene, then you can keep the tone of Ends of Empire-era Wraith much better. \nAlso, bear in mind that certain Arcanoi - \nArgos leaps to mind, as does the \nDark Arcanos Tempest-Weaving - \nare going to become problematical in a storm- \nbound setting. Think about these and other potential concerns that players may \nhave, especially if their entire character concepts were built around Helldiving or \nconveying souls through the Tempest, and they now find themselves left on the \nsidelines. There’s plenty for everyone to do in the post-apocalyptic Shadowlands. \nThe trick is making sure that people find it. \n\n\nA NFW BRFFD \nOE HUNTFRS \nby Ken Cliffe \nHUNTER: THE R E C K O N I N C ~ M L ~ ~ S M I N D ’ S  \nEYE THEATEE \nThe title Drew much says it all: There’s a new breed of hunters abroad in the World \ntestament to the transformation that has overcome them. \n-\n,\n \nof Darkness. They’re human beings who have suddenly discovered the existence of real- \nlife blood drinkers, wolfmen, wizards, ghosts, zombies and goblins. These people have \nbeen confronted with the realization that humanity is not at the top of the order or even \nin charge of things. They’ve learned the hard way that the lives they’ve always lived have \nbeen lies, spoon-fed to them by monsters intent on keeping humanity blind, deaf and \ndumb. These ordinary-turned-enlightened people now know that they are a subjugated \nrace, mere cattle or playthings in unfathomable supernatural games. \nWith knowledge comes power and with all these revelations, hunters arise as a \nseemingly new force to be reckoned with. They will not stand idly by while family and \nfriends are oppressed or killed. They will not allow people to be dominated by unearthly \nbeings. They will not rest until humanity is free. By strength or will or reason, they will \ninherit the Earth they thought they always had but, in truth, have always been denied. \nHunter: The Reckoning is the latest Storyteller game set in the modem World of \nDarkness. It breaks the mold of previous White Wolf games in that the common man is \nnow empowered to rise up against the forces of darkness that have reigned since the dawn \nof history. Creatures are the antagonists, not the protagonists, of this game. Sure, you’ve \nalways had the opportunity to play mortal humans before, whether with The Hunters \nHunted, The Inquisition or Laws of the Hunt for Mind’s Eye Theatre. However, \nHunter is not a second edition or update of any of those books. The characters of this \ngame are completely new to the World of Darkness. Not that they were born yesterday, \nof course - \nthey’ve always been here among the human masses. Yet cosmologically \nspeaking, they were born yesterday. \nIn recent months, everyday people - \nsteelworkers, temps, teachers, brick layers - \nhave suddenly and shockingly awoken to the fact that monsters lurk in the shadows. \nThese horrifying discoveries always come unexpectedly with no warning other than a \nbizarre sensation such as hearing a voice when no one is around or seeing a street sign \nchange inexplicably from “Walk” to “Run.” In that moment of disorientation, certain \nindividuals find themselves face-to-face with the most hideous things they have ever \nwitnessed - \nwalking abominations, affronts to nature itself. How each person responds \ndepends on her identity, but most endowed with such terrifying clarity act, whether to \nattack the creature, protect oblivious bystanders or to confront the thing to simply \nunderstand it. The fact that such people now wield bizarre powers of various stripes is \n\n\nAt the moment of apotheosis, called the “imbuing,” a hunter is created - \na person \nseemingly chosen to witness the truth of the world and empowered by some unknown \nforce to contend with it forever after. Once a person is imbued, she possesses the \ncapability to perceive monsters wherever they hide. Their illusions fade, their disguises \npeel away, their true faces are made manifest. The world is no longer what it was - \nit is \nnow home to nightstalkers, beasts and horrors. \nHow a newly imbued hunter deals with all this information is, as before, based on \nher identity: on her will to remain sane, her capacity to accept what she learns and her \nability to acknowledge that her world is not the real one. Many go mad. Others kill \nthemselves rather than face facts. A determined few piece together their new existence \nand set out to do something about it. These last are the source of Hunter: The \nReckoning. \nHowever, these kinds of people can also belong to your Mind’s Eye Theatre games. \nThe imbued offer an excellent change of pace -and surprise -for a new or ongoing live- \naction chronicle. Imagine a chapter in which various players are assigned the roles of \nmortals. Players portraying anything from vampires to changelings must interact among \nand around the usual “cattle.” Nothing new. In fact, it’s just what the Supernatural are \naccustomed to after ages of practice. Now imagine that, without warning, a handful of \nthose mortals suddenly “wake up” - \nthey see vampires hidden in shadows, they stand \ndefiant against Garou in Crinos form, they look straight into the eye of the restless dead, \nor they pierce directly through to changelings’ fae mien. Not only that, these people, the \nscales tom from their eyes, have powers never seen before. And whether directed by an \nunseen hand, granted divine grace or invested with instinctive understanding, these \nmortals know how to use their newfound capabilities to deadly effect. That’s when the \nshit really hits the fan. \nWhat becomes of these imbued people and the creatures they oppose is ultimately \nup to you and your troupe. Would-be hunters might be decimated. Monsters may be slain. \nIt all depends on the kinds of characters who participate in your ongoing game. However, \nin the long run, a new kind of protagonist is introduced to live-action roleplaying. This \nkind of human might be intent on destroying all creatures and delivering the fate of any \nsupernatural who fails to cover his tracks carefully. Or an imbued could be sympathetic \nto monsters, suspecting that they might have been human once and could be again; it’s \njust a matter of bringing the creatures back over from the other side. Either way, players \nof vampires or werewolves are forced to be wary, either to stay alert for fear of unprovoked \nattack from a once-docile humanity, or for fear of being confronted with memories or \nthoughts of a life left behind long ago when days were still numbered or the mundane \nworld was reality. \nMind’s Eye is also an ideal tool with which to depict the development of a hunter. \nThe days and weeks following her change are torment for one of the imbued. These \ncharacters witness monsters everywhere - \non the street, at work, at church, even in the \nhome. The worst part is that no one else sees these things, nor do they understand what \nyour character is talking about. Is she cracking up? Has she gone mad? Suspicious co- \nworkers look at her askance. Loved ones grow distant. Trying to explain what your \ncharacter sees and knows just drives everyone away - \nand maybe, just maybe, your \nfriends and family avoid you because they are not human! \nRoleplaying this isolation and decline offers amazing dramatic opportunities. \nImagine a seemingly crazed person making “random” appearances in an otherwise normal \nMasquerade game. Is she a newly sired Malkavian, perhaps? Clearly not when the \n\n\n“madwoman” reappears in the next chapter, now reconciled with reality and prepared to \ncontend with the beings she has seen over and over and finally understands. \nConfronting solo imbued in your live-action game is just one option. Although \nhunters have powers and the ability to see the supernatural, they are still mortal, and they \ncan be killed - \nespecially solitary ones. Consider this: Questioning their own sanity, the \nrecently imbued turn to friends and loved ones, perhaps even the police to tell their story. \nTheir responses are shock, pity and maybe even more trouble, such as incarceration “for \ntheir own good.” The rest of humanity just doesn’t understand. \nSo who do you, witness to monstrosities and endowed with unfathomable capabili- \nties, turn to? Some find solace among the others at the scene of the change, the other \n“ordinary people” who saw that first creature and wielded amazing power, too. Maybe \nthey will understand. \nWhether you return to the scene of the crime in hopes of finding the others, go \nonline in search of people like you or simply search the city for your “companions.” you \nmight eventually discover fellow imbued. The result is typically a group of hunters: people \nwho initially seek reassurance that they’re sane but who suddenly realize that they must \nstick together. After all, if they’re not insane, the world must be. \nImagine agroup ofplayers with mortal characters who are imbued in one live-action \nevent. Then, two or three sessions later, they return, this time unified, trained in their \ncapabilities and with a potentially extreme prejudice against the creatures of the night. \nBy introducing this element, Hunter: The Reckoning can make for a significant \naddition to your live-action roleplaying experiences. The game allows you to expand \nbeyond the possibilities of mortal characters. It also lets you change the terms by which \nsupernatural characters play. Not all mortals are mere pawns and food anymore. Some \ncan turn and fight back - \nwith amazing powers. \nOf course, Hunter only exists in tabletop format. However, its setting is the same \nas that of all the other Storyteller games, Mind’s Eye included. Thus, you can always \nadapt Hunter’s unique rules and powers over for use in your live-action games, and presto: \na whole new kind of character to stalk the night. Then again, it might only be a matter \nof time before official live-action rules for the imbued come to light.. .. \nFor now, consider translating Hunter characters as introducing a new kind oflive- \naction experience. The imbued are the common people faced with the brutal extremity \nof the World of Darkness. That’s the real fun of the game. They’re not secret agents or \nmembers of some occult secret society. They’re regular Toes and Janes thrust into \nsituations way beyond their comprehension. When was the last time your live-action \ntroupe had fun playing regular people? \n\n\nHouse of the Sanguine Moon; Tampa, FL \nHope Summerall, zandria@hotmail.com \nOnyx Illuminatus; Charleston, SC \nIan Betts, alisterlegare@hotmaiI.com \nOTHERS \n( U N S ~ E C I E I E D A N D  \nMIXED ~ A M E S )  \nEast of the River; Vernon, CT \nhttp://www.geocities.com/-narrator \nkatzmeowQkalama.com \nD.
