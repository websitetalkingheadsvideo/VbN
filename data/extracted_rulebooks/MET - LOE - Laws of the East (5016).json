At this \nstage, take the concepts that you’ve emphasized and develop a story for your \ncharacter. Look for explanations to why the character learned certain things, failed \nin others and developed as she did. Think about the sort of person that you’re \nplaying and the motives of the individual. \nThese considerations are especially important for players in Laws ofthe East, \nmost of whom are generally unfamiliar with Asian culture.

Even so, simple suffering is not \nenough - \nwhat moment, what purpose finally gave your character the strength to \nescape Hell itself in order to return to his body? What does he remember of his time \nin Yomi? How does his experience there color his outlook on existence? Did it rob \nhim of any joy, or did it simply sharpen his appreciation for life that much more? \nThe Second Breath - \nFleeing Hell is but the beginning. How did your \ncharacter first view life as a vampire? Was it a curse, a blessing or something else \nentirely? When did you first encounter others of your kind? Who was your sifu, and \nhow did she train you? Was she cruel, kindly or simply indifferent?

Do \nyou have any secret regrets? Hopes? Ambitions? Do you know something that \nyou shouldn’t? \nMotivations - \nDharma is one thing, but also take time to figure out why \nyour character interacts withother Kuei-jin and how hedeals with vampire society \nin general. Do you seek personal gain? Are you hunting someone or running from \npersecution? Perhaps you want to impress your sifu or find a mortal companion.

Skilled necromancers and natural \nliaisons with the Underworld, it is Yin vampires who frequently work to appease \nangry ancestor spirits and tend to the neglected graveyards of the Middle Kingdom. \nFreed of human standards they held in life, Yin Kueidjin pride themselves on their \nefficiency, pragmatism and their contemplative natures. The fact that other beings \nwould classify thase same traits as merciless, unfeeling and morbid means little to them. \nweakness: Vampires of Yin are vulnerable to the element of wood, which \nrepresents Yang. Wooden stakes paralyze them just the same as Western vampires. \nThe challenges required to do so are identical, as are the effects. Note that metal \nstakes do not affect Yin vampires, only wooden ones. \n.Rum \nThose Kuei-jin whose Chi Virtues are equal, or close to equal, are said to be \naspected to Balance. They are all things their fellow vampires are not: equal parts \ndead and alive, Yin and Yang, light and dark. With such a philosophical standing \nin unlife, it is only natural that some of the finest sages among the Kuei-jin are \nfound among the Balanced, since this state fosters many meditations on the nature \nof vampirism and the place of the Kuei-jin under Heaven. Many fine warriors \nfollow the path of Balance as well, since that philosophy stresses the perfection of \nbeing and mastery over the divided self that the vampire has become. Kuei-jin of \nBalance are perhaps the easiest of their kind to approach, since they are typically \nthe most comfortable with what they have become, and they see their state not as \na curse to endure but a riddle to puzzle out. Yet, paradoxically, by having the best \ngrasp of what it is to be Kuei-jin those of Balance are perhaps the most desirous to \ntranscend that state. \nWeakness: Vampires of Balance cannot be staked. That’s the good news. The \nbad news is that Balance is a delicate condition, and therefore the Kuei-jin is \nconsidered temporarily imbalanced any time that he possesses two or more Traits \nof any one type of Chi than its opposite. When thus imbalanced, any use of Chi \nhas the potential to provoke a bad reaction. \nYAW \nThese “scarlet dragons” embrace all things living with the characteristic \npassion of Yang, and they are the most lifelike of the Kuei-jin, determined to cross \nthe Wall into the living world once more. Their flesh is hued, they eat and drink \nnormally, and they can even consummate a union with a mortal (though whether \nthat mortal lives to tell of it is unlikely). Despite all their new powers and \nsensibilities, however, they are still unable to enjoy the pleasures of life the same \nway they once did, which is a source of endless frustration for them. For this reason, \nvampires of Yang are the Kuei-jin most likely to regard their state as a curse or some \nform of karmic punishment, a sentiment for which they are teased constantly by \ntheir more Yin-aspected cousins. The “hot blood” of Yang also makes them \ndangerous to be around at times, since these Kuei-jin are quick to fly into rages and \ndemonstrate other lapses of self-control. However, when the zeal of Yang is focused \ntoward attaining a specific goal, the scarlet dragons become ferocious figures \nindeed, and their warriors are legendary among the Kuei-jin for their bravery \nand determination. \nWeakness: Yang vampires are vulnerable to metal, the element of Yin. A \nmetal blade or shaft thrust through their heart disrupts their Chi balance and \nparalyzes them just as a wooden stake does for Kin-jin.

One of the primary means of determining the celestial obligation of \na particular Kuei-jin is her direction, the astrological sign which points to the \nduties she is to carry out along the Road Back. Direction is assigned as part of the \ninitiation ceremony into Kuei-jin society and is passed around the cardinal points \nof the compass, with each point corresponding to different predispositions and \nduties. While some directions are traditionally associated with certain Chi \nbalances-north and west toYin, south and east to Yang- the turmoil of the Fifth \nAge has seen even those ancient laws fall by the wayside. \nDirection should not be seen as a straitjacket on roleplaying, but rather a \ngentle suggestion of how a character is expected to act, especially by superstition- \nprone elders. In this manner it is similar to the auspices of the hengeyokai or the \nWestern Garou - \nother characters will view a character's behavior through the \nlens of direction, but that is all. How seriously the vampire regards the duties of her \ndirection is up to her, her wu and the court involved. A vampire of the east need \nnot always work among mortals, nor should one of the west always be plumbing the \nspirit worlds.

This fact puzzles those Kuei-jin who try to pinhole their \nDharma into “to-do” lists and otherwise uphold the letter rather than the spirit of \nits teachings, not realizing that a Dharma has as many gray areas as life itself and \ncannot be confined to mere words on a page. Countless variations have appeared \nthroughout the ages, and disputes can - \nand do - \narise among followers of the \nsame Dharma as to the “correct” way of pursuing enlightenment. Ultimately, each \nKuei-jin is responsible for following his own path, no matter what others might say. \nFortunately, most Kuei-jin recognize the Dharma that is right for them \ninstinctively, and thus, they are better suited to understand the philosophy behind \nits teachings as well as what is said outright. It should be noted that while most \nKuei-jin choose their Dharmas during their re‘ period, sometimes Heaven itself \nexpresses which Dharma a Kuei-jin should follow, resulting in what others might \nconsider some bizarre pairings. (This case is especially common for those Kuei-jin \nwith high ratings in the Horoscope Background.) For example, a former Buddhist \nmonk might return as a Resplendent Crane to continue his old ways, but he might \njust as easily find that he is destined to follow the Howl of the Devil-Tiger in order \nto make up for his past disdain for all things physical and wicked. Such is joss; while \nit is possible for a vampire to change Dharma, it is far from common even in the \nFifth Age. To reject one’s previous Dharma is to say that all a vampire once stood \nfor was wrong, and that is a difficult thing for anyone to admit. \nNote: A character who chooses a different Dharma immediately drops down \nto Dharma 1 in his new path, he may never again follow his old Dharma, and he \nloses his old Dharmic Strength in favor of his new one. However, the old Dharmic \nWeakness remains even as the character acquires the Weakness for his new \nDharma (although the old one may now be bought off as usual).

Likewise, Devil-Tigers view true demons as the surgeons \nwho bring such pain to creation, increasing suffering only to improve the eventual \nproduct. Make no mistake, however - \nvampires on this path are often sado- \nmasochists of the highest order, welcoming the same type of anguish they so readily \ninflict on others for the wisdom that comes of it. Yet many of their younger \nmembers have lost sight of the true goal of the Dharma, and they simply bring \nsuffering with no eye toward enlightenment. Such brings great shame to their \nelders, who do their best to “awaken” these headstrong youths with excruciating \nlessons. The Fifth Age is a great playground to them, for never before has pain been \nso accepted - \nso mass-produced - \nand never have so many implements for \ndelivering agony been easily available. At the same time, though, most mortals \nnow believe they are used to pain and suffering, and so revealing the wisdom of true \nagony becomes that much harder. But oh, the fun of opening their eyes! \nThe Searing Wind (another name for this sect) was supposedly created when \nthe Grand Arhat Xue first learned the wisdom to be gained in suffering. Since then, \nDevil-Tigers have embraced this original goal gleefully and committed all manner \nof conceivable atrocities on themselves and others. Devil-Tigers prefer dragon \nnests in locations that sicken and horrify other vampires, and so their sites often \nseethe with evil spirits and unclean practices. The Chi gathered there is often \ntainted with the anguish of countless victims. Lesser beings sometimes take such \nhorrors as signs that these Kuei-jin are devil-worshippers, but few live to repeat \nsuch misconceptions to them, as foolish infernalists who begin talks with such \novertures learn (in the seconds before their flesh is seared away and scattered to the \nnight winds). Devil-Tigers seek to become demons, not serve them, and they have \nnothing but contempt for those who would settle for the lesser goal of serving a \ndemonic master. In this fashion, if none other, the Devil-Tigers are better than \nmany of their fellows in remembering the original purpose of the Wan Xian -to \nprotect humanity from the Yama Kings. Indeed, Heaven surely smiles at the irony \nof this Dharma comprising one of the largest forces actively seeking to thwart the \nambition of the Yama Kings. (Of \ncourse, in battling demons, most Devil-Tigers are \nsimply trying to eliminate potential rivals more than protect humanity, but at least \nthey recognize their purpose.) \nAs the Sixth Age dawns, the Devil-Tigers prepare to take their place at the \nhead of creation, and they enjoy letting other Kuei-jin know it. The Searing Wind \ncan be found in nearly every comer of the Middle Kingdom teaching mortals the \nmantra of pain, but they are just as often found eliminating those who understand \nthe lesson too well, as the surgeon must cauterize disease to keep it from spreading \nunchecked.

These Kuei-jin and their philosophy may \nmake Sabbat vampires look like a Sunday school choir, but that doesn’t mean they \nare as blatant in their means. \nTraining: \nDevil-Tigers learn from pain. Each scream is a new insight learned; \neach trial endured anew level of strength. As a sudden lightning flash leaves deeper \ndarkness, so too does a brief agony engender a greater calm. Most Masters abduct \ntheir charges and torture them in a variety of indescribable ways, seeking to force \nthem to accept their new existence and begin learning the mantra of anguish. \nMany Devil-Tigers endured lives of great pain and conflict (and more than a few \nadded to the violence in their own way), but nothing can prepare one for the \ntorments of Yomi and the razor-keen lessons of this Way. Skill and finesse are \ntreasured in this Dharma, while raw carnage and brutishness are disparaged. Even \na monkey can be taught to fire a gun, but it takes an artist to teach with pain.

Once they realize that another being has fallen \nunder the influence of the dark side of her nature, the vampire’s player may attempt \nto appeal to the target’s “dark side” by spending a Social Trait and making a Social \nChallenge. If successful, the wicked being will be inclined to view the vampire as \na friend for the remainder of the scene (longer if she is treated well).

This talent may work only on beings \nwhose dark nature is very close to the surface.

Maybe once \nthe Wan Xian were noble and glorious protectors of the Middle Kingdom, the \nResplendent Cranes reason, but they shamed their posts long ago, and even a fool \ncan see that their modem descendants have slid even farther from the favor of \nHeaven. Duty is still duty to the vampires of this Dharma, and they carry out what \nthey perceive as their ordained role to the best of their ability, but they are often \ndriven more by a sense of grim determination than true confidence of purpose. \nBecause of these perceived failings, many Resplendent Cranes also practice \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

After a long period of meditation, he wandered until \nhe came upon a frozen pond. There he saw a crane pluck a frog from the ice and \nset it aside. The frog became a butterfly, and in a flash, Xue was enlightened. \nUnfortunately, too many Resplendent Cranes have lost track of the true lesson to \nbe found in the tale of their origin, focusing on their own unworthiness instead. If \nthe Shining Ice Guardians are to have any hope in reversing the coming of the \nSixth Age and restoring an Age of Heaven to the Middle Kingdom, they must \nscourge the corruption that afionts the August Personage of Jade instead of \nconcentrating ceaselessly on their own souls. The corruption in the Middle \nKingdom has spread to the point where not all of creation can be saved - \nmaybe \neven not the Resplendent Cranes themselves - \nbut if that’s what it takes, then so \nshall the will of Heaven be served! \nTraining: Resplendent Cranes must purge their own impurities through \nrigorous exercises of both the body and the mind. Mortification is considered \nimproper, but asceticism is encouraged, and pupils are expected to be both prudent \nand frugal when conducting their temporal affairs. Having shamed their ancestors \n(or believing they have), the Resplendent Cranes practice generosity, benevo- \nlence and other charitable habits in the hopes of righting their past sins. \nThe Eightfold Lotus Path is another crucial part of training - \neach Lotus is \na lesson that the Kuei-jin must recognize and practice if he wishes to attain \nsalvation. The First Lotus recognizes hope, while the Second Lotus demands a \nvirtuous existence. The Third Lotus involves nurturing the good of the world, the \nFourth Lotus demands the purgation of the wicked, and the Fifth Lotus encourages \nthe instruction of others on the proper way of being. The Sixth Lotus requires law \njust as the Seventh Lotus shows mortal law giving way to harmony, and the Eight \nLotus completes the cycle and unites the living world with the spirit. By consid- \nering the Eight Lotus Path in addition to the Fivefold Way, the Resplendent Crane \ncan determine what the virtuous course of action might be at any given time. \nDharmic Strength: Strength of the Oversoul \nResplendent Cranes learn early on that the P’o is their enemy in the eternal \nstruggle for enlightenment, and while they know it cannot be entirely banished if \ntheir Dharma is to be truly realized, that doesn’t mean they have to like it. In \nparticular, Resplendent Cranes learn how to shake off the yoke of the P’o in times \nof dire distress, calling on their devotion to the Hun and its laws to give them a burst \nof resolve. Once per story (not per session), an Ice Guardian may address his Po \naloud, reminding it of its foul nature in the eye of Heaven. The player may then \nspend a Willpower Trait to receive an automatic victory when resisting shadow \nsoul, or to avoid taking one action that the P‘o desires, if the P’o has already taken \ncontrol. The Crane can do so only at a time appropriate to the Kuei-jin’s Nature, \nand the act should be a point of high personal drama if at all possible. At the very \nleast, the speech should be quite commanding and poetic in its descriptions of the \nP’o’s foulness. \nDharrnic Weakness: Unbending Bonds of Law \nIn theory, the Resplendent Cranes are enlightened rulers dispensing Heaven’s \njustice.

Indeed, they are considered meticulous even by the \nsuperstition-prone spirits they deal with, and no fact passes by them without being \ncarefully examined for its connection to anything else the Bone Flower knows. \nThis sifting weeds out useless data and sometimes yields amazing results from what \nis apparently a collection of trivia, but it also tends to try the patience of more \ndynamic beings, who view the Bone Flowers as cold and distant. \nFor the most part, Bone Flowers lived unfulfilled lives as mortals, often \nneglecting family ties and relationships in their quest for academic or artistic \nexcellence. Many of them committed suicide or suffered from terrible illnesses. \nWhile the Second Breath cures the scars of the latter, it cannot heal the emptiness \nthat many Bone Flowers feel regarding the pleasures of life that they passed by. The \nlonging engendered by such regrets is powerful, and those of this Dharma who \nsuccumb to their desires do so with the urgency of a hundred abandoned dreams. \nSuch moments are as rare as a midnight sunrise, though the powerful Yin bonds of \nthe Bone Flowers tends to make such pleasures of the flesh seem fleeting and \ntemporal; unworthy of exploration. Only the hunger for knowledge seems to \nsurvive, and thus, the reason many of these Kuei-jin are such avid historians. It is \nthe only hunger that they still recognize as worthy offeeding. Even as flesh fails and \ngoods fall apart, truth preserved is truth eternal. Oddly enough, it is this same \ncuriosity that leads Bone Flowers to seek out their fellow shen, making them the \nmost common ambassadors of the Kuei-jin not only to the Jade Kingdom but the \nother supernatural denizens of the Middle Kingdom as well. They even serve as \nguides to those who seek out the paths of the Yin and Yomi Worlds, though such \nguidance does not come cheaply or easily, as negotiating with an elder Bone Flower \nis a long, delicate process at best. \nPerhaps the most critical duty of this Dharma in the turbulent Fifth Age is \npreserving the ancient traditions of honoring the dead, which are rapidly being \nignored out of existence in the hectic rush of modem life. Angry ghosts howl at the \ninjustices that their thoughtless descendants are visiting upon them, and other \nwraiths wail piteously for the living to take even the slightest notice of them, \nreduced to begging for attention instead of receiving their due honorably. In some \ncircles the old ways are even mocked openly, a blasphemy that the Bone Flowers \nwill not tolerate. Offenders are first “persuaded” to amend their ways by the tender \nmercies of the Bone Flowers representing their ancestors. Those mortals who \ncontinue disrespectful or derelict in their duties are introduced to the truth of the \nafterlife firsthand. Other Dharmas are concerned with the material world, con- \nvinced it is the linchpin of existence, but the Bone Flowers know better. The spirit \nworlds are in chaos, and whatever happens in realms beyond has direct repercus- \nsions on the Middle Kingdom. A chain reaction capable of ushering in the Sixth \nAge may finish in the material realm, but it does not have to begin there, and the \nBone Flowers are constantly alert to the threats posed by wicked spirits and other \nmalign creatures. If the other Kuei-jin cannot be made to see the truth of this \ndanger, they are only getting in the way. \nTraining: Many Bone Flowers are taken on long spirit journeys by their sifus, \nespecially through the Y in and Yomi Worlds, where they can witness the existence \nof the spirits firsthand.

Finally (and perhaps most importantly), the \nvampire must immunize herself to the pains of the living world and the spirit realm \nalike, for doing so is the only protection against the immense suffering that arises \nfrom dealing with both realms at once. Some Bone Flowers welcome such \nnumbness and embrace it to an inhuman degree, but others try to fill the emptiness \nwithin them that this training creates by pursuing other passions than simply the \nstudy of death. \nDharmic Strength: Mantle of Tears \nBone Flowers are keenly sensitive to the events of the many spiritual realms \naround them, especially the Dark Kingdom of Jade. As such, Bone Flowers have \nlittle trouble attracting the attention of kuei and other wraiths. With the expen- \nditure of a single Mental Trait, the Bone Flower may cause any spirits of the dead \nin the area to notice her. (Wraith characters should be notified by aNarrator as to \nthe vampire’s exceptional presence.) This talent, while occasionally dangerous if \nmalignant spirits are nearby, is often very useful to the vampire, since it allows \nwraiths to find and interact with her more easily. Furthermore, by dropping her \nvoice to a whisper the Kuei-jin may be clearly heard in the Yin World, although \nshe cannot hear any responses without the benefit of Disciplines or the wraiths \nemploying their own powers. Those wraiths who do attempt to contact the \nvampire while she uses the Mantle of Tears are two Traits up on all related \nchallenges to communicate with her. \nDharmic Weakness: Hell‘s Freezing Talons \nAttuned as they are to Yin, most Bone Flowers appear cold, pale, icy and \ninhuman to those withwhom they interact.

And no matter how romantic their detached unlives may seem to others, \nthe truth is that most Bone Flowers are as impassive to the joys of existence as they \nare to its pains, and few indeed are those beings who care to make close \nacquaintances with these inhuman creatures. (Even Devil-Tigers at least have \nsome wicked charm going for them.) Due to their perceived heartlessness and the \nrigorous lessons that these Kuei-jin undergo, which are designed to desensitize \nthem, Bone Flowers may never have more than three permanent Social Traits \nrelating to warm, friendly relationships (such as Empathetic, Friendly, Genial).

Not all Kuei- \njin choose this way of arrogance, however. Some vampires seek instead to emulate \nthe hollow reed, which sustains itself on water and yet remains empty, grounded \nin earth and reaching to the sky at the same time. Enlightenment for these Kuei- \njin comes from seeing old truths from a new perspective, from learning to balance \nthe conflicting urges of the vampiric self into one functioning whole. It is said that \nXue compared three insects he saw along his journey - \nthe jumping grasshopper, \nthe flying wasp, and the humble trundling centipede. Unlike its prouder cousins, \nthe centipede moved slowly, but each of its 100 segments moved in harmony with \nthe others, and each segment contained its own legs, shell, even heart.

While most beings seek to establish their identity and hold fast to it \nabove all else, the Whispers forsake just one life for maintaining three or four \nidentities at once, identities that are often as different as the vampire can make \nthem in order to encourage multiple insights.

Needless to say, this adherence to the Dharma means that \na vampire eventually feels the need to leave her court and even her wu in pursuit \nof a new perspective on existence, making other Kuei-jin hesitant to trust those \nWhispers they know. After all, who is to say if they will be around when they are \nneeded?

Furthermore, they place special emphasis on \nmaintaining a balance in all things: Hun and P’o, Yin and Yang, fury and calm. This \ncareful tending of their soul keeps Rootless Trees from losing their minds in the \nendless identity shifts they undertake, and it makes them surprisingly stable and \nconfident for those with such a transitory lifestyle. \nOfcourse, it is not only the demands of time and talent that make this Dharma \nthe rarest - \nvampires are not creatures of intrinsic balance by any means, and \nkeeping up such a delicate state requires great self-mastery. Many are the Whispers \nwho are blown off the narrow path, and on top of that, the Rootless Trees tend to \nfall harder than other Kuei-jin when they lose their Dharmic Way. The luckiest \nof these vampires merely stumble about until they have regained their focus, but \nmany more fall into madness or other permanent imbalance as a result. Even when \nundertaken correctly, gathering insights from different lives and personalities \nrequires a great deal of time, more than most young Kuei-jin are willing to spend \nfor such a high-risk philosophy. However, true Whispers understand that vampires \nhave nothing else but time, and are willing to wait as long as it takes to achieve even \nthe smallest moments of enlightenment. In the meantime, they dispense the \nwisdom learned of living multiple lives to any who will listen and hone their skills \nin preparation for donning the next pair of eyes they will wear. \nTraining: Kuei-jin on this path must endure continuous symbolic death and \nrebirth, and followers of this Dharma are buried for a time after the “death” of each \nidentity, during which time they contemplate the lesson to be learned from that \nlifetime. This practice begins during the re‘ period but continues beyond that time, \nbecoming ingrained into the Kuei-jin as she travels, and it often marks the times \nwhen the vampire chooses to leave her wu or court as well. The first introduction \nto the Broken Mask technique comes when the master assigns his pupil her first \nthree identities and an impossible question to answer for each, then sets her free \nto learn what she may. Necessary skills, funds, sutras and other tools are provided \nfor these identities, although all future lives are the vampire’s responsibility. After \nthose three lives have been completed, the pupil is free to pursue her own destiny. \nIdentities of a Whisper do not included taking on new Dharmas, or even the \nsemblance of them. After all, one already has a Dharma to consider and fulfill. \nDharmic Strength: Ten Thousand Whirling Thoughts \nMaintaining so many identities at once is very exacting, but it also lends the \nvampire certain benefits when it comes to resisting mental domination, especially \nagainst those unfamiliar with the ways of these strange Kuei-jin. When another \nsupernatural creature attempts to read or manipulate the thoughts of one of these \nKuei-jin, the defending Whisper may attempt to confuse the probing party by \nmixing in details of other lives in a nonsensical torrent. This tactic translates in \ngame terms as one free retest per different identity the Whisper is currently \nmaintaining. Once one of these retests is used, however, it is not regained until a \nnew story begins. A Whisper must already have been using an identity for at least \na few weeks before it can add to the Ten Thousand Whirling Thoughts. If in doubt, \nconsult a Storyteller about which identities are “involved” enough to be useful. \nThis talent works only against powers which attempt to read thoughts, manipulate \nmemories and otherwise investigate or alter the mind of the Kuei-jin. Powers that \naffect emotions or auras or that control the mind directly without seeking to \nexplore it (such as Obligution or Dominate) are not affected by use of this Strength. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

Many \nDragons denied laughter and physical delight during their lifetimes, and only since \ntheir death and rebirth have they begun learning how to enjoy themselves in the \nworld of the flesh. Now they do so with a lust so strong it blasts aside all mortal \nstandards. Of course, sex is not the only means these vampires use to explore the \nlife-force around them - \nany pleasurable activity, no matter how perverse it may \nseem to outsiders, will eventually draw the eyes of the Dragons. \nIndeed, this same appetite is the basis for the primary flaw infecting the \nDharma - \nno matter how much Yang energy a Thrashing Dragon may possess, it \nis still stolen energy, a pale shadow of the life-force that once flowed naturally \nthrough his veins. Most Dragons thirst secretly to be alive again, but no matter how \nmuch life-energy the vampire consumes, his curse cannot be undone - an \nunpleasant truth that makes even the most brazen Dragons falter in their endless \nquest for pleasure. This same reason leads the vampire to explore ever more twisted \nand alien pleasures in the hopes of finding one that will reverse his condition. \nWhile this Dharma is not necessarily evil in and of itself, many of its members \nbecome hedonists to such a degenerate degree that other Kuei-jin do their best to \navoid contact with them and their “temples.” Buddhist Kuei-jin bear a particular \ndisgust for the Laughing Rainbows, and they often bar them from their courts. As \nmight be expected, though, Dragons have little use for societal taboos, and enjoy \nshocking mortals out of their daily routines by cavorting about naked or nearly so, \nindulging their passions openly in the streets and otherwise destroying the \npropriety and decorum of an occasion. Many Laughing Rainbows are also expert \nshapeshifters, since flesh is just one more medium and those who wish to become \nanimals had best learn how to run alongside them. No matter how degenerate the \nDragons become, however, they are careful to honor the kami of their animal and \nelemental companions.

Cities are their playgrounds and humanity is the clay in their expert \ncraftsmen’s hands. Most other vampires are unaware of just how much sway the \nDragons would have if they chose to exercise it, but for their part, the Laughing \nRainbows have yet to deem such action necessary. Instead, they play the part of the \ncapering fool, dancing with the Scarlet Queen while they figure out new ways to \nbeat the Ebon Dragon into submission at every turn.

Each new story (not each session), the Dragon \nis assigned one hedonistic activity-sex, drinking, drugs, etc. -in which he must \nindulge at least once per session. If the Dragon fails to indulge his vice during the \nsession, he gains the temporary Negative Traits: Impatient and Oblivious, indicating \nhis distraction until he takes care of the matter. This hedonistic impulse must \nchange from story to story, as the Laughing Rainbows are experimenting with new \nmeans of pleasure-seeking all the time.

Though a charac- \nter is more than a simple set of drives, an Archetype provides a basic springboard \nfrom which the character’s motives and behaviors can develop. An archetypal \nNature shows the underlying elements making up a personality, while archetypal \nDemeanor is the face the character shows to the world around him. \nIn the course of play, a character’s Nature Archetype serves to provide \nconcrete goals and codes of behavior, which means that a player can call for a retest \non a Virtue Test automatically if a frenzy would violate the character’s Nature. \nHowever, if someone discovers your character’s Nature, it can be used against you \nin the same way a Negative Trait might be, forcing you into a challenge. \nExample: Lao Yuen, a Thrashing Dragon with a Bravo Nature and a seething \nhatred of the tongs who caused his death, is leadinga Scarlet Screen offiwe mortals against \nhis killers’tong. Oneofthe thugs brandishesaMolotowcocktailatYuen, whoseplayertests \nfor wave soul and fails. Howewer, Yuen’s player calls for a retest based on Yuen’s Nature \n-he’s too bent on dealing some grievous bodily harm to let some tattooedFnk scare him \naway from his rewenge. The player makes a second test and wins. Yuen pauses only for \na moment at the sight of the Molotow before sneeringslightly and launching himself at the \nterrified goon. \nLater, Yuen is wounded and low on Chi, and the jina owerseeing the raid asks him \nto charge into another den of killers in a clean-up action. Yuen is in no shape to do so, and \nhe refuses. The jina scolds him angrily: “You swore on your honor to do away with these \nimpudentfools, and I’m too Commandingfor you to refuse so easily. ” The jina then adds \nmockingly, “Has the mighty Bravo let his prey escape him so easily?” The jina’s player \ncalls for a Social Challenge, and because he guessed Yuen’s Nature correctly, Yuen’s \nplayer must advance two Traits. The chalknge is made, and Yuen loses. Wearily, the \nLaughing Rainbow rises to his feet and prepares for the next assault. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

      "text": "The Traits that describe your character’s innate capabilities are called \nAttributes. You use these Attributes in the game to perform actions and overcome \nobstacles. While certain situations may also require Abilities, such matters are a \nfunction of training. Even with the appropriate training, you must call on your own \nstrengths to finish the tasks set before you. \nWhen you enter a situation with a questionable outcome, you bid a Trait \nappropriate to the challenge. If you are trying to knock someone over, for instance, \nyou might bid the Physical Trait Brawny as you use your strength. The nature of \nthe challenge determines the Trait used - \nPhysical, Social or Mental. \nYou should try to bid a Trait appropriate to the nature of each given challenge. \nThat is, using your strength may call on the Brawny Trait but not the Dexterous \nTrait. If you and your opponent agree, you can use other Traits, but in general, \nchoose Traits fitting the challenge. \nWhen you bid a Trait for a challenge, remember that you risk that particular \nTrait. If you fail the challenge, you may lose the use of the Trait temporarily, as you \nexhaust your resources and lose your confidence. Some situations may require the \nuse of an additional Trait or more. Any time that you are considered “bids down,” \nyou must risk additional Traits. Conversely, if you are listed as “Traits up” or “Traits \ndown,” you modify your current number of Traits when comparing for overbids or \nties. \nFor the purposes of determining what kinds ofTraits are appropriate to specific \nchallenges or Disciplines, the Trait listings include a run-down of what sorts of \nTraits fit into what specialized categories. For example, the Physical Trait Tough \nmay be appropriate for the Discipline of Black Wind because it is a strength-related \nTrait. Of course, you can ignore these categories if you wish, in favor of speeding \nthe game. Remember, unique situations may allow Traits to be used in unusual \nways. \nNew players may find it easier to bid a generic Trait from the appropriate pool \ninstead of picking a specific one. Doing so allows them time to get the hang of the \nsystem. When they’re more comfortable with bidding, then start having them \nchoose Traits. \nStrength-related: Brawny, Brutal, Ferocious, Stalwart, Tough, Wiry \nDexterity-related: Dexterous, Graceful, Lithe, Nimble, Quick \nStamina-related: Enduring, Resilient, Robust, Rugged, Tireless \nMiscellaneous Physical: &le, Energetic, Steady, Tenacious, Vigurous \nAgile: You have a well-honed and flexible body.

By choosing a specialization in an Ability, you hone \nyour skills with a particular facet of that talent. \nAbility Specializations are a wholly optional rule. Remember to ask your \nStoryteller before taking a specialization. \nTaking a specialization requires that you spend one Experience Trait or Free \nTrait on an Ability that you already have. Then, you can declare a particular \nspecialization. Whenever you perform a task with that specialization-even if you \ndo not expend the Ability - \nyou gain a one-Trait bonus on resolution of \nchallenges, as long as you have at least one level of the Ability left. You may only \nhave one specialization in any given Ability. You cannot take Firearms: Pistols and \nFirearms: Rifks together, for instance. You also can never gain more than one \nBonus Trait at a time from specializations, even if more than one would be \nappropriate to a given challenge. That is, even if you have Medicine: Physiology and \nScience: Biology Research, you only get a one-Trait bonus on a test of biochemistry, \ndespite your multiple specializations. \nA specialization is a fairly narrow \ntice. You cannot, for \ninstance, take a Melee specialization in “swords,” nor could you have an Occult \nspecialization of “writing.” An appropriate specialization refers to one small class \nof items or to one type of practice within the Ability, such as Melee: Katana or \nYou may take a specialization in an Ability with an area of study. In such a \ncase, you concentrate your research in one particular facet of that sub-Ability, or \nin one application of it. Thus, you could have Crafts: Woodworking with a \nspecialization in Hidden Panels, or Science: Botany with a specialization in Bonsai. \nNote that the Bonus Trait from a specialization does not have an adjective, \nand it is not bid or used like other Traits.

You \npossess a level of education and general knowledge beyond rudimentary schooling. \nWith Academics, you can express artistic criticism, debate the classics, consider \nphilosophy and indulge in studies of culture. This broad Ability covers all sorts of \nhumanities in learning. \nAcademics allows you to recognize historical, art and cultural references. You \ncan use Academics when working in such fields, when developing a critique or \nresearching.

Characters \nwith this Ability can not only live normally alongside animals and predict their \nactions, but they can also calm or enrage them. \nGiven time, you may train an animal to perform simple tasks like fetching, \nguarding and attacking. When a command is given, the animal must make a \nMental Challenge to understand and carry out the order. In order to give a \nsuccessful command, you must bid between one and three Traits, depending on the \ndifficulty of the task. You may also attempt to calm an injured, attacking or \nfrightened animal by defeating it in a Social Challenge. \nAthletics \nWhether due to a background in sports or just personal talent, you are skilled \nin all manner of athletic endeavors. You can throw a ball, sprint, climb, jump and \nswim. This last can be especially useful to vampires, who do not float naturally. \nYour Athletics Ability is used for retests on most forms of raw physical activity: \nacrobatics, swimming, jumping, throwing, climbing and running.

Those who wish to c \nin another language (but cannot actually \ndo so) should hold up one hand with the first finger and thumb making an L-shape \nto indicate to other players the characters are not speaking English.

Furthermore, you can translate data \nfor yourself or others, though a Static Mental Challenge may be required to do so. \nLinguistics also allows for identifying accents, reading lips, picking up slang and a \ncertain amount of linguistic mimicry. \nFinally, since many Eastern languages have wildly different dialects or \nalphabets, a character may spend one “language” level to become familiar with one \nwhole language family. For example, a character whose native tongue is \nShanghainese could take one level of Linguistics and select “Chinese” for her \nlanguage, thus becoming fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese and all other dialects of \nChinese. The Storyteller has final discretion over what constitutes a language \nfamily. \nNote: Yes, the “language family” rule is somewhat simplistic, but in the \ninterests of game-play some shortcuts must be made. This version of Linguistics can \nalso be considered to supersede the rules for Linguistics given in all previous Mind’s \nEye Theatre games. \nMartial Arts \nPerhaps no other Ability matches the path of Dharma \nlosely as Martial Am \ndoes. Those trained in this Ability learn how to perfect themselves and how to \nharness that perfection to achieve dramatic results in the world around them. \nHowever, such training is extremely demanding, requiring countless hours spent \nin training and testing, making this Ability accordingly expensive to purchase. \nMartial Arts costs two Traits per level to purchase at character creation.

Aikido, judo, jujutsu and tai chi chuan are all examples of soft styles. \nWeapon styles are just that - \ntraining in the use of a melee weapon which goes \nbeyond the basic techniques of the Meke Ability into true mastery of one’s weapon. \nA single, specific type of weapon (katana, bo, nunchaku, etc.) must be declared for \nevery two levels of a weapon style when it is purchased. Only these weapons receive \nthe appropriate training bonuses. Wushu and ninjitsu are just a few of the many \nstyles that contain weapon training. Many Kuei-jin see the hard styles as Yang- \nbased, full of action and activity, and the soft styles as rooted in Yin, outwardly \npassive but inexorably efficient. \nMartial Arts replace Brawl. A character cannot possess both Abilities. A \ncharacter may still purchase the different styles of Martial Arts. Each new style is \ntreated as a different skill, and it must be paid for and advanced accordingly. (Thus, \nit is possible for a character to have three levels of hard-style Martial Arts and two \nlevels of soft-style Martial Arts, two levels of hard style and one level of weapon \nstyle, or some similar arrangement.) With the exception of weapon styles, \nhowever, a character cannot “double up” on a style. He cannot learn two levels of \ntae kwon do and three levels of karate, for example, since both count as “hard” \nstyles for the game purposes. In the case of weapon styles, the character may still \npossess the Meke Ability as a reflection of general armed talent, but he cannot use \nit for any retests with weapons for which he possesses a Martial Arts weapon style. \nA character who has three levels of Meke and one level of Martial Arts with the \nkatana, for example, cannot use his Meke levels to retest any challenges he \nundertakes with his katana. That weapon is now solely the domain of his Martial \nArts Ability. \nBenefits of Martial Arts \nBoth Styles: Characters using their chosen style add their current level of \nMartial Arts to their Physical Traits for the purposes of resolving ties and overbids. \nThis factor reflects the edge that martial-artists have over average brawlers. This \nbonus applies only if the martial-artist is using Martial Arts and attempting a \nchallenge that falls within his style. A hard stylist delivering a kick, for example, \nor a soft stylist attempting to grapple an opponent. It would not apply, however, \nif the former was attempting to dodge an opponent or if the latter was trying to \npunch his foe, and it never applies to a character trying to simply soak damage. If \nin doubt, consult a Narrator as to whether a martial-artist’s bonus applies to a \nparticular test he is undertaking. \nHard Style: Practitioners of a hard style may expend one level of Martial Arts \nto attempt to deliver a lightning fast strike at the end of a normal combat turn, even \nif they lose the regular challenge itself. (Think of it as a blazingly quick strike that \nfollows up another hit, or when a fighter gets hit with a kick only to smash the foe’s \nankle in return.) This attack is conducted like a regular Physical Challenge except \nthat the opponent may not attempt to harm the martial-artist as a result of the \nchallenge, only attempt to soak the attack, unless he too expends a level of Martial \nArts. This follow-up/ counterattack is resolved before a new round begins or any \nextra actions due to supernatural powers are taken, although pre-emptive powers \n(such as Alacrity) may be used to try to prevent this strike. Only one follow-up/ \ncounterattack may be delivered per turn, and it cannot be retested with Abilities \nby the martial-artist (although he may attempt to overbid, if applicable). \nSoft Style: Many soft styles stress trips and throws.

Accordingly, the benefits of asoft style are harder \nto enact than a hard style, but more potent once secured. First the martial-artist \nmust specifically declare that he is attempting a hold or lock of some kind and win \na Physical Challenge to that effect (which does not inflict damage). If successful, \nhowever, the stylist may spend a level of Martial Arts to fully assert the powerful \nadvantage he now holds. His opponent must first win a Physical Challenge to break \nfree of the hold before she may make any attempt to injure him. Furthermore, he \nmay choose to spend a level of Martial Arts to inflict damage as outlined in the \ndescription of hard styles. This damage does not come from a lightning-fast reprisal, \nbut instead from the martial-artist ripping nerves and twisting limbs. \nWeapon Style: The player may add his current levels of Martial Arts to his \nPhysical Traits for the purposes of resolving ties and overbids for challenges using \nhis chosen weapons (and only those weapons). These Traits ad to any bonus Traits \nthe weapon may have. In addition, opponents may not block the character’s retests \nwith his weapon unless they too expend a level of Martial Arts to do so. The \ncharacter is simply too skilled with his weapon to be so easily thwarted. \nRequirements of Martial Arts \nTraining: \nUnlike the Brawl or Melee Abilities, characters cannot learn Martial \nArts without a tutor. While many courts have a few warriors willing to teach the \nfighting arts, such training is seldom free, and it requires a great deal of time and \ndiscipline in any event. No teacher can teach a student a higher level of Ability \nthan he himself possesses. A sensei with three levels of Martial Arts cannot train a \nstudent to the fourth level ofMartial Arts. Whole stories can be constructed around \nthe search for advanced masters to study from, and the Storyteller is free to forbid \nadvancement in this Ability to any character who cannot meet the proper \nrequirements of time and teacher. \nFurthermore, once a degree of mastery in the martial arts is obtained, it must \nbe maintained with regular training and exercise. As a rule of thumb, at least one \nhalf-hour of practice per level of Martial Arts is required per night if the character \nwishes to retain his fighting edge. Characters who use weapon styles are likewise \nexpected spend the necessary time keeping their weapons in top condition. \nStorytellers should feel free to reduce the levels of Martial Arts available to a \ncharacter temporarily if some sort of regular training schedule is not met. Obvi- \nously, a character should not be docked levels if he just skips one or two nights at \nthe dojo, but a character who misses practice constantly should expect his skills to \ngrow a little “rusty” before long. This fact should be especially clear as characters \nreach the higher levels of Martial Arts, since such mastery requires constant \nattention to keep in top form. \nPresence of Mind: Martial Arts absolutely may not be used while a character \nis in a state of fire or wave soul. Characters in those states have been reduced to \ntotal, primal instinct, and they do not have the patience or presence of mind for \nproper martial arts techniques. (Note: This applies to other character types as well. \nHengeyokai, Western shapeshifters and Cainites in frenzy are likewise banned \nfrom employing Martial Arts.) \nRetests: With the exception of the special style abilities outlined above, \nopponents may still use Brawl, Melee, Dodge or even Firearms normally to block or \nretest any Martial Arts Challenge whenever applicable. Martial-artists are tough \nfoes, but a student with only one level of Martial Arts still has little chance of \nbesting a veteran fighter with five levels of Brawl. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

The difficulty of \nthis challenge can be subject to many factors, such as obscurity, amount of existing \ndata and the character’s individual scope of understanding (Kuei-jin know more \nabout their own rites than they do those of the Sabbat, for example.). \nPerformance \nThis Ability actually covers the gamut of artistic expression, including \nsinging, acting, dancing, playing musical instruments and similar skills. It grants \nyou the gift to make your own original creations and/ or express these creations to \nyour peers, in a chosen medium. The genius of your creativity or the power with \nwhich you convey it is determined by a Static Social Challenge. Some particularly \nsensitive types, such as Thrashing Dragons and Toreador Kindred, can even \nbecome entranced by the use of this skill - \nafter first being defeated in a Social \nChallenge. \nIn addition to actual performing ability, this Ability also measures how well \nyou know the society surrounding your particular art form and how you fit in with \nthat crowd. Advanced levels of Performance always involve some form of special- \nization. This Ability can also be used to critique the works of others. \nPolitics \nThe world of influence-trading and favors is extensive enough among mortals. \nIn the courts of Kuei-jin society, where one must struggle to balance outward \nobedience with inner ambition, the game of Politics is pervasive, if a bit more subtle \nthan among the decadent Westerners. Through observation, intrigue and a bit of \nspin-doctoring, you’ve learned how to handle appearances, understand what a \nspeech really means, and know where the deal-making is going on. In short, it’s \nPolitics as usual. \nThe Politics Ability is useful primarily in dealings with mortal society ot \nInfluence. You may be able to manipulate the outcome of local political actions, \nwith the proper Influence and some well-placed Social Challenges. Politics Ability \nensures that matters proceed in the direction that you desire. Politics is also used to \ndiscern hidden motives and broker deals, and as such, it can prove invaluable in \ndetecting a double-cross or power play. The hierarchies of power are also often \nvisible as well: You can discover which of the mandarins holds true authority, for \nexample, and which ate largely figureheads at their posts. Politics can also makes \nyou aware of who’s in favor and who’s out. You can determine roughly how much \nfaith a court entrusts in aparticular vampire, given advance knowledge of the local \ncourt scene and a successful Social Challenge. \nA knowledge of Politics includes, by extension, an understanding of the \nbureaucratic levels of power. You know how to cut through red tape, or how to \nobstruct others with it. By determining who’s important in a given social situation, \nyou can usually avoid wasting time and go straight to the person with the power to \ndo what you want. \nRepair \nYou possess a working understanding of what makes things tick. This Ability \ncovers everything from fixing cheap watches to overhauling expensive luxury cars, \nassuming, of course, that you have the time, tools and parts.

You happen to be \ntrained in using and understanding these modem arts of miracle-working: You \nhave a degree of factual and practical expertise in a single field of the hard sciences. \nThis Ability measures not only theoretical knowledge but also how well you can \nput it to practical use. This knowledge allows you to identify properties of your field, \nperform experiments, fabricate items, bring about results and access information \na player could not utilize normally.

Materials acquired \nwith Scrounge aren’t always brand new or exactly right, and they often require some \ntime to come by, but this Ability sometimes works where Finance and outright theft \nfail. A Static Mental or Social Challenge is necessary to use Scrounge. Some factors \nthat influence the difficulty of the challenge include rarity and value of the item \nsought, as well as local supply and demand. \nSecurity \nWhichever side of the law you’ve worked on has granted you experience in \nSecurity techniques. You know about police operations and guard work, how they \nmake their schedules and how they undertake their business. (Not to mention how \nto disrupt such operations.) Locks, traps, security systems and alarms are all within \nyour purview. With a little time, you can put together security measures for a \nlocation. You can also defeat such measures. \nUse the Security Ability with Mental Traits to set up a secure area or network, \nor to formulate aplanfor breachingsuchanetwork.

You know how best to take advantage \nof surrounding cover and how to use light and shadow. Opportunities for unnoticed \nmovement are not lost on you, as you understand the uses of timing and diversion. \nWith an appropriate Physical Challenge, you can sometimes sneak past the \nnotice of guards and searchers (who contest your Ability with their Mental Traits \nand Investigation Ability).

Your Storyteller will probably require \nyou to define how you keep your allies and their relations to you. \nEach Allies Trait possessed represents one person that you can call on for aid. \nUnlike Influence, your allies have special talents that make them better than the \naverage person on the street. Though your allies may not be aware of your vampire \nnature, they can be quite useful if directed properly. \nIn general, your allies do not show up in play directly. Instead, you can use \nthem for certain services between play sessions, by notifying your Storyteller: \nAn ally can be directed to follow up on research or activities that you have \nstarted. If you undertook a specific task previously, like tailing someone, research- \ning a project or building a device, your allies can continue the work, doing so with \none Ability Trait’s worth of expertise. As long as they work on the project, your \nAllies Trait for the individual is tied up. \nIf you need a particularly competent ally, you can expend multiple Traits to \ngain access to a mortal with multiple levels of an Ability or Influence. Each Allies \nTrait that you spend after the first gives an extra level of expertise to your allies. \nThey may use this expertise on your behalf, though rarely with your own skill, and \nthey only help as long as you tie up your Allies Background Traits in this manner. \nAn ally can help you to hunt, though obviously, it’s not a good idea to rely \non your allies as Chi sources, or to even tell them exactly what they’re doing when \nthey bring people to you. Each Trait of Allies that you use for hunting lets you make \na Simple Test. A win or tie grants you one additional Chi Trait.

When you call on your contacts, you make a few phone calls, check \nwith likely snitches and grease a few palms.

(You must use three Traits to perform an action listed at the third level of \nan Influence chart, for instance.) Thus, with high levels of Influence, you can \nperform many small actions, or a few significant ones. \nCertain levels of Influence gift you with items, money or aides.

Characters with highYin ratings are simply \ntoo calm and collected to fall victim to such petty concerns as rage. \nAwakening - \nThe Kuei-jin may spend a Trait of Yin to awaken at \nsundown. Once spent, the Kuei-jin is considered “black cycled,” and she need not \nspend Chi to awaken for another 10 days! However, the dark energies animating \nher give her a more corpselike pallor than normal. She is considered one Trait \ndown on all Social Challenges with mortals except those involving intimidation, \nand she must describe her pallid visage to those who would notice the change (such \nas close associates or those who normally see her charged by Yang energy, for \nexample). She must still spend Chi for Disciplines and other things. \nGhostsight - \nBy spending an appropriate Chi Trait, the Kuei-jin can \nattune himself to his inner Yin, allowing him to view the effects of Yin all around \nhim. Doing so has the following game effects: \nFirst, the character extends his sight beyond the Wall into theYin World, thus \nallowing him to see Yin-spirits such as wraiths and Spectres. To do so, the \nCathayan’s player must concentrate for one minute and win or tie a Simple Test \n(retested with the Occult Ability). This vision lasts for one hour or until the end \nof the scene, whichever is longer. \nSecond, the character may scan objects or living prey (undead and Risen \ncount, ghosts don’t) for weaknesses. The player must spend at least three turns \nwatching his target (no combat or fast movement), then make a Static Yin \nChallenge against eight Traits. If successful, the next attack the Kuei-jin makes \n(hit or miss) inflicts an extra level of the appropriate type of damage if it lands. \nOnce that attack is made, the Kuei-jin must reattune himself to the target to \nreceive the bonus again. \nThird, the vampire can study the mystic marks on a target’s aura for signs of \nweakness and decay, thus allowing him to deduce any physical ailments plaguing \nher. Doing so requires a Static Mental Challenge against a difficulty of the target’s \nMental Traits, but if successful, it tells the Kuei-jin if the target is injured, any \ndiseases she is suffering from or how much blood she’s lost. Note that unless the \nKuei-jin has at least two levels of the Medicine Ability, he will understand complex \nailments only in simple terms: a target is “weak,” “feverish” or “wasting away.” \nFinally, the vampire may use Ghostsight to look at broken objects and deduce \nhow they once went together by tracing the lines of decay. Doing so requires a win \nor tie on a Simple Test with the Crafts or Repair Ability to function, and it gives \nthe vampire a good idea of how to repair the object (if possible). \nYang is the energy of dynamism, of change and of renewal. Despite the \npositive connotations given to it by many Westerners, it is something of a perverse \nforce. Yang gives the Kuei-jin the energy to draw their Second Breath, but it also \nfuels the ravenous hunger that sends many Kuei-j in spiraling into depravity. As the \nCathayans say, Yang is simply the energy that powers a Kuei-jin’s actions; whether \nthose actions are “good” or “bad” is up to the Kuei-jin himself to determine. Yang \nenergy is important when resisting fear and connecting with other living things. \nKuei-jin with high Yang ratings are often very human in appearance, the kind of \nundead who arose to avenge families or hold fast to a love they cannot bear to leave. \nHowever, they are sometimes all too human in action.

The permanent \nYang rating is used to resist wave soul. \nHealing - \nDead as they are, Kuei-jin may use either type of Chi to heal \nthemselves. (See the healing section on p. 180 for details.) However, the Kuei-jin \nmay also heal others by preparing an elixir with her own Yang Chi. Each Trait \ninvested in the mixture heals one level of lethal damage or two levels of \nbashing damage. \nAwakening- \nSpending a Yang Trait for this purpose causes the character \nto enter a “scarlet cycle.” She appears more human than normal for the duration \nof the night, and she endures no penalty to Social Tests. While not entirely lifelike, \nthe vampire displays enough mortal traits (blinking, coughing, cold but passable \nskin) so that only those who are trained to search out the undead will usually ever \nsuspect anything is amiss. Of course, the vampire must spend a Chi Trait every \nnight to remain in scarlet cycle, which makes such benefits quite costly in the \nlong run. \nLifesight - \nBy spending an appropriate Chi Trait, the Kuei-jin can attune \nherself to her inner Yang, allowing her to view the endless tapestry of Yang all \naround her. Doing so has the following game effects: \nFirst, the character extends her sight beyond the Wall into the Yang World, \nthus allowing her to see Yang-entities such as kami and other natural spirits, as well \nas detect physical beings with abnormally high amounts of Yang energy (such as \nhengeyokai and hsien). To do so, the Cathayan’s player must concentrate for one \nminute and win or tie a Simple Test (retested with the Occult Ability). This vision \nlasts for one hour or until the end of the scene, whichever is longer. \nSecond, the character may sense the emotional “flares” that occur when two \nor more beings meet each other, thus often sensing their true feelings about their \nrelationship. For example, the Kuei-jin might observe two lovers meeting and see \nthat one flares feelings of love and devotion, while the other projects nothing but \nnervousness and guilt over an affair he’s having behind his partner’s back. To use \nthis talent, the character must succeed at a Simple Test against each target she \nwishes to scan. If successful, she may ask the target to provide a brief summary of \nhis true feelings about the person he just met with. Shen may spend a Willpower \nTrait to dim their reactions and render this power useless against them, although \nthey may only do so if they are aware that they’re being watched by another party \n(not necessarily the character). This power is best reserved for mortals alone, since \nusing it on shen and other Kuei-jin is considered a serious insult and breach of \netiquette. However, Kin-jin and other barbarians may be scanned at will. \nFinally, the vampire can use her attunement with life energies to “home in” \non a particular overriding passion in the surrounding area. The range of this power \nis 20 paces plus one pace per Mental Trait the vampire possesses. The passion \nchosen must be a strong one. Momentary annoyance or casual flirtation is not \nstrong enough for this talent to detect, but deep hatreds and true love are certainly \nfair game.

She may then ask \n(out of character) any character she passes if he is currently experiencing the \nemotion she is searching for, and the subject must answer honestly. If used for \nhunting, the player may subtract five minutes from his hunting time for each Trait \nof Yang he possesses (minimum five minutes). \nTraditional Chinese thought divided the soul into two halves: the lower, \nanimalistic soul (the Po), and the higher, rational soul (the Hun). While Kuei-jin \nof other cultures know them by different names, for the most part all Hungry Dead \naccept this dichotomy as representative of their condition. \nThe Hun reflects a character’s spirituality and sense of duty, her capacity for \nabstract thinking, aesthetic thought and her remaining empathy for humanity. \nHun is sometimes seen as a sense of conscience, but that description is not quite \nright (at least not in the sense of goodness and “Christian charity” that most \nWesterners attach to that word). Rather, Hun is a measure of a character’s sense \nof honor and devotion to duty - \nwhether that duty is the lawful administration \nof the Resplendent Cranes or the wicked ministrations of the Devil-Tigers is \nirrelevant. A Kuei-jin with a high P‘o and low Hun, for example, is little more than \nan animalistic killer, while one with high P o  and strong Hun rating is far more \nrefined - \na demon, but an honorable one nonetheless. Characters with high Hun \nratings seem very “in control,” and they possess a great deal of spiritual strength in \nthe face of adversity. Their rational side is well cultivated, and they seldom feel any \npull to give in to momentary urges or selfish impulses. Characters with low Hun \nratings tend to view existence in a very brutish and animalistic way. \nUsing Hun \nDemonAhs--eninvokingoneoftheDemonArtDisciplinesoftheP’o, \nthe Hun may be used to harness the P’o into a controlled frenzy. After (and only \nafter) the Demon Art is activated, the Kuei-jin’s player may make a Static Hun \nChallenge against a difficulty equal to her P o  score. Success enables her to evoke \nthe Demon Art while retaining her own Nature. Failure means the P o  takes over \nthe body while the Demon Art is used. \nEmpathy - \nA Kuei-jin may never have more empathy-related Attribute \nTraits (Empathetic, Compassionate, etc.) than he has Traits of Hun. \nShadow S U I -  Hun is the Trait used when resisting the takeover of the P’o \nduring shadow soul. Characters with high Hun ratings are too disciplined to let the \nanimalistic P’o take control on a whim. \nSharpened Senses - \nThis power is identical to the Auspex Discipline’s \npower of Heightened Senses. The Kuei-jin may spy on distant conversations, detect \ninvisible foes and otherwise enjoy the same benefits as that Discipline, although \nstrong stimuli such as bright lights or sudden loud noises may likewise incapacitate \nthe character temporarily. All this power requires is a minute of concentration to \nenact. In particularly chaotic circumstances, the Narrator may rule that a win or \ntie on a Simple Test is required to focus the Kuei-jin’s sharpened senses. This power \nlasts for a scene or until the Kuei-jin shuts off her increased sensitivity willingly. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

      "text": "Spirit Speech - \nA Kuei-jin may make a Static Hun Challenge against a \ndifficulty of the local Wall to speak with a spirit, provided she can detect it in the \nfirst place. \nTempering the P’o - \nA Kuei-jin who succumbs to shadow soul is not \nentirely at the mercy of the P’o. While her higher side is powerless to stop the \nrampages of the Demon during this time, characters with enough resolve may \nremember the actions of the P’o and even subtly influence its behavior. The Kuei- \njin’s player must win a Static Hun Challenge against nine Traits to temper the P’o. \nSuccess does not prevent the shadow soul change, but it allows the Kuei-jin to \nremember the actions that the Demon takes during this time. Furthermore, the \ncharacter may spend a Willpower Trait to modify an action the P’o takes (such as \nmaiming a target instead of killing him) or delay one action the P’o wishes to take \nuntil the next turn, such as hesitating to allow an innocent victim time to escape. \nFinally, a Kuei-jin whose Hun soul stays aware during shadow soul may spend a \nWillpower Trait to speak one lucid sentence (such as yelling “Run, you fool!” at \nthe innocent victim from earlier, assuming he didn’t get the point already). \nAll Kuei-jin bear the taint of Yomi, an exaggeration of the darkest aspects of \ntheir own soul that rides their shoulders like a demonic imp, urging them toward \nself-destruction constantly and occasionally (or not so occasionally, depending on \nthe strength of the Kuei-j in in question) taking the reins to perpetrate unspeakable \nrampages of cruelty and perversity. The P’o is animalistic but fiendishly clever as \nwell, not like the mindless Beast of the Kin-jin, and the lures of the Demon are \noften as subtle as they are wicked. The P’o is the force that turns minor irritation \ninto killing fury, but the strength of the Demon is often also the only thing that can \nsave the Kuei-jin from certain destruction, a fact the Demon uses to its full \nadvantage. \nIt is important to remember that the Kuei-jin have studied the Demon for \nmillennia, and they do not seek only to contain and suppress it as the Kindred do \nwith the Beast. The P’o is as much a part of the character’s soul as anything else, \nmaybe not apart to be proud of, but a part nonetheless. It is not some alien presence \nto be destroyed, but the character’s own voice as heard through the winds of Hell. \nAs the greatest teachers of the shen teach their students, the P’o must be understood \nand assimilated if enlightenment is to be achieved, and characters who see the \nDemon within only as their enemy are doomed to a narrow existence indeed. The \nP’o does offer its Hun side some potent advantages, but always with a price that \nmost Kuei-jin would do well to inspect carefully before they pay, lest they become \nnothing more than pawns to their own depraved urges or worse. \nusing P’o \nBerserk Rage - \nThe character may attempt to prod his P’o into a berserk \nrage. Doing so is risky at best, but it can sometimes turn the tide of a desperate \nbattle. A Static P’o Challenge against a difficulty of the character’s Hun rating + \n3 (max 10) is required. If successful, the character enters fire soul immediately (see \nthe systems chapter for the benefits/ drawbacks of fire soul). He also gains access \nto Demon Chi during this time. \nDemon Arts - \nA character cannot possess a higher level of a Demon Art \nthan his P’o rating, which translates in the following manner. Characters with 1- \n4 Po Traits are limited to Basic Demon Arts; those with 5-7 P’o Traits can have \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

For each Trait of permanent Po, the character is \nconsidered to have one Trait of Demon Chi. Demon Chi may be spent in a similar \nmanner to the Black WindDemm Art, even if the character doesn’t actually possess \nthat Discipline. Each Chi Trait spent in this fashion counts as a temporary level \nof the Black Wind for the turn. (Thus, the character could spend three Demon Chi \nand receive three extra actions or three temporary levels of supernatural strength.) \nTo gain access to Demon Chi for a scene, the player must make a Static P o  \nChallenge against a difficulty equal to his Hun Virtue + 3. \nOnce spent, Demon Chi is gone for the night, although feeding at some \ndefiled sites may restore Demon Chi earlier at the Storyteller’s discretion. Upon \nawakening each evening, the character may make a number of Simple Tests equal \nto his permanent P’o rating. Each success indicates a Trait of Demon Chi regained. \nFangs - \nUnlike the Kin-jin, Cathayans have no natural fangs, but by \nspending a Trait of Demon Chi they may sprout fangs that are, in all respects, \nidentical to those of a Western vampire. By spending two Demon Chi Traits, they \nmay sprout a hideous fanged maw. The character is two Traits up on all biting \nattacks, and he inflicts aggravated damage with his bite, but the maw cannot be \nhidden. Both such uses of Demon Chi last for one scene. \nNature Shift - \nThe P’o is usually the Virtue used to determine if the \ncharacter enters fire, shadow or wave soul. See the individual descriptions of these \nstates for more details. \nResistance - \nIf the Kuei-jin suffers from magical mind control, he may \nattempt to use the savagery of the P’o to break the bond. The player must win a \nStatic P’o Challenge against nine Traits. Success means the control is broken, but \nthe player must also test for shadow soul immediately. \nShadow Soul - \nThe most feared power of the P’o is to take over the Kuei- \njin’s body, subsuming the Hun nature to carry out its darkest desires. When the Po \nis dominant, the character’s P’o Archetype replaces the character’s normal nature, \nand the player must roleplay the dominance of his character’s dark side appropri- \nately. If the player is incapable of doing so, the Storyteller is free to step in and \ndictate the P’o-dominated character’s actions. Shadow soul typically lasts for one \nscene, at which time the Hun may reassert itself, although the Storyteller may \nmodify that time according to the nature of the incident that provoked the change \nand the relative strength of the character’s P’o. It is also important to note that \nunless the character uses his Hun to temper the Po, the Hun remembers nothing \nof what happens during the time of the Po’s control. The character must find out \nfrom other sources what his Demon made him do during this time, and the answers \noften aren’t very pretty. More than one Kuei-j in has gone mad or even spiraled back \ninto Yomi after “awakening” to discover slain loved ones or see centuries of \nplanning undone in a single moment of darkness. \n(For more on roleplaying shadow soul, see the systems chapter on p. 195.) \nIf none of these Archetypes seems appropriate, work with the Storyteller to \ndesign your own P’o. Wraith: The Oblivion and the Shadow Play- \nGuide have \na number of suggestions that could easily be adapted for P’o Archetypes. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

The Bandit can force a test for shadow soul whenever anyone \norders the Kuei-jin to do anything or tries to put him “in his proper place.” Bandits \nascendant are out to smash and destroy, less for sheer pleasure like the Demon, but \nto invite chaos and destroy order. Many enjoy committing crime, and it is not \nuncommon to find a Bandit at work in a tong or some other criminal organization. \nThe BQtbarian-The \nBarbarian prefers the relative freedom of the West over \nwhat it sees as the stifling confines of useless, antiquated Eastern formality, and it \nnever fails to take any opportunity to compare Cathayan and Cainite ways. A test \nfor shadow soul is in order whenever adhering to some traditional practice would \ncause the Kuei-jin pain or other hardship. The Barbarian may also attempt to \nmanifest if it encounters Kin-jin. Once in shadow soul, a Barbarian may deal freely \nwith Kin-jin, trample on traditional beliefs or even dare to disrespect to the elders. \nThe Deceiver -The Deceiver has no use for the truth in any form. It lies for \nthe sake of practice, occasionally sprinkling in flattery, followed with wild \nfalsehood, all to render the Hun unable to trust himself or move without the advice \nof his Po. The Deceiver seeks to take over whenever an opportunity to lie would \nbe more advantageous, usually after the Hun has tried and failed to solve the \nsituation through truth. A Deceiver in control merely has a larger field in which \nto spread his lies, often laying a number of unpleasant surprises for the Hun to find. \nThe Demon - \nAll that the Demon sees exists for its own whim, to devour \nand destroy as it sees fit. There is no other need but its own, no other pleasure but \nits own. Western eyes would see the Demon as a sociopath. The Demon attempts \nto take over when it sees an opportunity to make itself stronger by the destruction \nof another. Demons ascendant can be terrifying. Some are out-and-out destructive, \nseeking to slake their hungers in the most gruesome manner (such as through \ntorture or murder - \nserial killers are often sociopathic). Others are more insidious \nand cunning, looking for pleasure in stalking, psychological games or traps laid for \nthe Hun. Demons, however, prefer to be their own masters, and even the most \ndepraved Demon is disinterested in a deal with the Yama Kings. \nThe Fool - \nThe Fool is, to put it kindly, simple-minded.

The Fool can attempt to take over whenever \nthe Hun finds itself at a loss for words or in an awkward situation. Once in shadow \nsoul, the Fool usually demonstrates why he is called the Fool - \nupsetting careful, \nlong-range plans for immediate action, saying exactly the wrong thing, and trying \nto find the easy way out of any situation. \nThe Legaliit -The opposite of the Bandit, the Legalist is order to the point \nof rigidity. There is a correct way to do everything, and the Legalist will give the \nHun no peace about mistakes or “insults” to the divine order ofthings. The Legalist \nthreatens takeover if an inferior is disrespectful of the Hun (and the Legalist alone \nknows who’s inferior), or if the Kuei-jin herself is disrespectful.

The Monkey attempts to take over when it \nsees a diversion that would distract the Hun from its business, particularly one that \nthe Hun would be interested in normally. A Monkey in shadow soul is exhausting \nto keep up with, running hither and thither, letting anything remotely important \nto the Hun fall into ruin. Many’s the Hun who’s awakened from shadow soul to \ndiscover himself with a small hoard of trinkets and his plans in shambles. \nThe Slave -The \nSlave has no belief in the Kuei-jin, and it seeks constantly \nto place the Kuei-jin under the control of another, because obviously the Kuei-jin \ncan barely take care of himself. It questions the Kuei-jin’s judgement continuously, \nforcing him to admit that he has no self-worth and is incapable. Even worse, the \nSlave wishes to serve the Yama Kings, and a Cathayan with a Slave Po risks \nbecoming akuma. The Slave attempts to take over whenever the Hun is in the \npresence of someone older, stronger or wiser, or if a plan of the Kuei-jin’s goes \ndisastrously wrong. When the Slave achieves shadow soul, it sets about its primary \ngoal of finding masters to yoke the Kuei-jin; many times, the Slave uses such times \nto attempt to further contracts with the Yama Kings. \nChi is the energy that fuels all vampires. Unable to enjoy the pleasures of \nmortal flesh or the comfort of more mundane gratification, only Chi itself offers \nsustenance to Cathayans. Most Kuei-jin must consume blood or flesh to survive, \nalthough elder vampires are rumored to be able to subsist on other things. It is with \nthe Chi contained in blood that a vampire draws on the strengths of the \nundead condition. \nChi Traits do not have adjectives. Rather, each Trait simply represents a \nquantity of energy. Chi Traits can be represented with cards. When a character \ngains Chi Traits by feeding, take the cards from the victim. When Chi Traits are \nspent, give the cards to a Narrator or Storyteller. \nYour starting ChiTrait total is determined by your Dharma. When you come \ninto play for an evening’s game, make a test with a Narrator as you pick up your \ncharacter sheet. If you win, you come into play with all of your Chi Traits, as \ndetermined by Dharma. If you tie, you have half your Dharma limit of Chi Traits, \nrounded up. If you lose, you come into play with only four Chi Traits. Certain \nMerits, Flaws, Dharma disadvantages or other circumstances may alter your \nnumber of Chi Traits at the beginning ofplay. Possession of the Herd Background, \nhowever, allows you to come into play with more Chi Traits, up to your Dharma \nlimit (see the appropriate Background descriptions on p. 95 for Herd). \nWhen you have expended a great deal of Chi, you become hungry. A hungry \nvampire is susceptible to the Demon’s urges and to fire soul due to the ravenous lust \nfor sustenance. You are considered hungry if at five or fewer Chi Traits. You may \nbe susceptible to fire soul at the sight, smell or taste of blood or other applicable \nsources of nourishment (see “Chi Virtues” on p. 108). If you have two or fewer Chi \nTraits, you are ravenous, and your difficulty to resist fire soul due to hunger goes up \nby one Trait, making it very likely that you enter fire soul at the first opportunity \nto feed. \nFeeding is the only way to replenish Chi. You can take Chi Traits from \nmortals, other vampires or other creatures with Chi energy, such as animals or \nhengeyokai.

Healing in this fashion requires your concentration and a full turn. It \ncannot be done in the same turn that the character makes an attack. \nSpending one Chi Trait grants an extra Physical Trait for the duration of \na conflict. You can bid this Trait like any other (“by the blazing power of Yang”), \nand you can count this Trait in ties and overbids. You can spend Chi in this way \nas a reflexive action at any time, not counting as your turn, though you still obey \nthe limits of Chi-expenditure according to Dharma level.

You can heal only one level of aggravated \ndamage per day in this fashion, though, unless you also spend a Willpower Trait for \neach extra wound healed in the same rest period. \nMany Disciplines require the expenditure of Chi Traits, as listed in their \nindividual descriptions. If a particular Discipline costs multiple Chi Traits but your \nDharma prohibits you from spending all of the blood at once, you must spend the \nblood on successive turns. Spending blood in this fashion is usually reflexive, \nthough the Discipline itself may require an action. For instance, activating Black \nWind is reflexive. You spend a Chi Trait and still get your normal action, plus extra \nactions or other benefits from Black Wind. \nWillpower Traits measure the strength of your character’s resolve and sense \nof self. By exerting your Willpower, you can withstand otherwise untenable \nconditions, renew your commitment to a course of action and empower certain \ndifficult Disciplines. \nWillpower Traits are not described with adjectives.

Uncomfortable as you are with this new \nframe, you shift and fidget constantly, and you even exhibit some of the body’s old \nmannerisms or physical tics from time to time. Most Kuei-jin with this Flaw will \ngo to great lengths to “establish” their identity with their clothing or other external \nmodifications.

Defiled vampires are \nin constant pain from the burning, boiling Chi within them, and they suffer terrible \nnightmares as well (that Flaw is included in the cost of this one). Thus, their wound \npenalties are treated as one level less than they are actually suffering unless they \nare reduced below Incapacitated, since defiled vampires are used to constant \nsuffering. However, the benefits end there. Any time the Kuei-jin’s player fails a \nchallenge directly involving Chi or Willpower, he must make a Simple Test \nimmediately. On a win or a tie, nothing happens. On a failure, the character gains \na “Defiled Trait,” which should be recorded by the Narrator. Once the character \ngains enough Defiled Traits to equal his permanent Hun rating, he vomits up three \nChi Traits and loses a permanent health level as the defiled Chi bums away his \ninsides. If he does not have enough ChiTraits, substitute Willpower Traits instead. \nFew Kuei-j in with this Flaw live very long unlives, and while some bodhisattvas are \nsaid to know a cure, no one has ever proven one to exist.

Players seeking to play kanbujian characters \nshould remember that their characters must be of pure (or very nearly so) Asian \nlineage, no matter where they hail from, and that they will likely be treated as \npariahs by both East and West if they are ever discovered. However, those looking \nfor a challenge or who seek to play among a group of unsuspecting Westerners may \nfind that kanbujian are right up their alley, provided they secure Storyteller \npermission first, of course.

Not that strangers will attack you on the street at every turn, \nbut you are unwelcome, and the native population will do its best to make sure you \nknow it. You have a two-Trait penalty on any non-supernatural Social Challenges \nwith mortal natives of the area, it costs roughly twice as much to live in the area \nas it would for a native, and all uses of Influence that are locally based take twice \nas much time as normal. Otherwise, the real nuances of this Flaw are largely up to \nthe Storyteller to enforce, but they should be a constant irritation at the least. Note \nthat this Flaw is not based on your actual personality in any way, but on the native \nperception of foreigners. You may be a kind and gentle soul, but the fact of your \norigin has marked you as unwanted from the beginning. \nTaking this Trait as a Merit means that you have undertaken the painstaking \nprocess of acclimating yourself to the native accents, points of etiquette and other \nfine cultural nuances that separate those merely familiar with a culture to those \nwho truly live in it. What’s more, you have mastered them to a degree where you \nhave earned the acceptance of the natives and are treated as an honored equal in \nmost situations.

Characters of Asian descent but Western upbringing, or natives who \nhave been “Westernized” and then returned, may take this Flaw with Storyteller \npermission, but even so, it is only worth half as much to them. (They cannot take \nthe Merit, since they are assumed to fit in well enough unless otherwise specified.) \nSome enlightened individuals may go from having the Flaw to possessing the Merit \nover time.

As far as the court is concerned, you are a true \nmember, and you may enjoy the full measure of its justice and protection from any \nwho would attempt to harm you. You may even have a voice in court affairs, albeit \nusually a rather small one. \nNaturally, the Cathayans do not extend such permission lightly. Simply \ndeciding to drop by the area for a spell is not enough justification for this Merit. \nRather, a court appointment is typically granted in exchange for some duties or \nother benefits you agree to provide the court, and the court is well within its power \nto renounce its recognition if you prove deceitful or otherwise unwilling to fulfill \nyour obligations. Bear in mind as well that one court’s protection may not save you \nfrom the wrath of another court, nor necessarily insulate you from the intrigues of \nyour “home” court. Most Kuei-jin would have no qualms about sacrificing a \nforeigner if it meant saving the court as a whole. Likewise, other Kin-jin will almost \ncertainly consider appointment to such a post high treason, even if you are not \nactually betraying the secrets of other Western undead, and they will take steps to \nremove such a dangerous informant from the presence of the Cathayans. Court \nappointees therefore walk a dangerous line between two cultures, but they stand \nto gain much in the shadows if they are strong enough. \nThis Merit differs from the Merit: Gaijin/ Gweilo in that the former concerns \nKuei-jin politics alone, while the second addresses mostly mortal society. You do \nnot need to purchase the Merit: Gaijin/ Gweilo to purchase this Merit, though it \nwould certainly help. However, it is extremely unlikely that you can possess this \nMerit ifyou have purchased the Flaw: Gaijin/ Gweilo; the court would have tostand \nto gain something extrmdinary to justify putting up with such an obnoxious \nforeign devil! \nNote: Cainites without this Merit are not necessarily killed on sight, but they \nare considered to have no voice in court and no recourse in the eyes of Kuei-jin \njustice. They exist even more at the whim of the mandarins than most. Unrecog- \nnized Kin-jin also tend to make excellent scapegoats/ target-practice for a court \nwhen things go wrong, so while they may take tea with whoever will have them, \nsuch Kin-jin had best step lightly indeed and keep one eye on the exit at all times. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

      "text": "Unlike the fractious lives of the Westerners and their paranoid coteries, the \nKuei-jin are bound together on many levels by powerful ties of loyalty. Perhaps \nnone are so binding, however, as those which hold a Kuei-jin wu together, a bond \nwhich is known as w n x i  by the Kuei-jin. It is the result of a Reciprocity spell cast \non the wu by the elders of the court when the wu is recognized. In game terms, the \nguunxi acts exactly like a Sabbat Vaulderie score, cementing the bonds of the wu \nto something mystic and nearly unbreakable. A character arrives at his guanxi \nrating with each of his wu-mates by means of the following formula: 5 + (wu-mate’s \nCharisma-related Social Traits) - (your character’s P‘o or Yin score, whichever is \nhigher). The final score is considered the character’s guanxi rating toward that \nparticular Kuei-jin. Note that agwnxi rating can and likely will change over time. \nCharacters who acquire more Yin or P’o Traits start becoming too callous or self- \ncentered to feel a strong bond, while a character who blossoms into a charismatic \nleader over time attracts more favorable attention from her fellow wu members. \nNote, however, that unless their bond is somehow broken, even characters with \nlittle or nogumxi rating are still bound to all their wu brethren. They simply have \nmuch less trouble than the others might about acting against their fellows. Only \nif the bond is specifically dissolved do all the emotional attachments and feelings \nof loyalty disappear. \nFor those unfamiliar with the Vaulderie system, more information can be \nfound in the Sabbat section on p. 224-225 in Laws ofthe Night. A brief summary \nof relevant points is as follows, however. The guanxi is a bond as strong as any blood \nbond of the Kin-jin, and it carries all the relevant emotional and intellectual \nweight. In effect, Kueiejin view those vampires that they share aguanxi with as old, \ntrue friends, and they should act accordingly around them. These are not simply \ngood buddies or fellow soldiers. They are the ones acharacter turn to when he needs \nhelp the most, no matter what their Dharma or direction might be. To be sure, \ncharacters who share gwanxi may still argue, think ill of each other and even spar \non occasion, but they stand as one against any outside threat or coercive force, no \nmatter what. In order to actually plot against someone for whom the character has \naguunxi rating of 3 ot higher, the player must spend one Willpower Trait. In order \nto plot against someone for whom the character has aguanxi rating of 6 or over, the \nplayer must spend two Willpower Traits. It is one thing to vent one’s frustrations \nabout how pig-headed or obnoxious a wu member may be; it’s quite another to plot \nto disgrace or assault someone that the character knows at heart to be a close and \ntrusted friend. \nTo attempt the destruction of someone for whom the character has a guanxi \nrating at all, the player must bum two Willpower. Without the burned Willpower, \nthe character finds herself realizing the person she hates is loyal to the wu and \ntherefore worthy of respect. Characters with aguanxi rating of 6 or over must bum \na Willpower Trait e v q  turn they wish to assault their wu member, so strong is their \nbond of friendship. In other words, while the characters may even come to blows \nunder harsh circumstances, it is nigh impossible in the Kuei-jin’s mind to find \ncircumstances that justify actually destroying a wu member. Even if they discover \nthe unthinkable - \nthat a wu member has betrayed them - \nmost Kuei-jin still \ncannot bring themselves to kill their former friend, overwhelmed as they are by \nmemories of better days and moments of emotional solidarity with the traitor. Such \nwrenching scenes should be moments of impassioned high drama if there ever were \nany. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

While most Kuei-jin treasure their wu as a prime source of friendship \nand support in their unlives, they all agree that those who do not wish to be part \nof such a group do both sides a favor by removing themselves from it. All that is \nrequired to remove one or more wu members from their guanxi is to petition the \ncourt to lift the Reciprocity spell in question. It is within the power of the court to \nquestion and even veto such a request, although the latter is seldom the case unless \nthe court truly suspects foul play. It is also rumored that the Yama Kings can free \none of the bonds of guanxi, though the whispers say that one must become akuma \nto be granted this “privilege.” If the request is approved, though, theguanxi ratings \nin question are dissolved and the character is free to choose his own path. However, \nsuch feelings do not fade so quickly, and players whose characters leave the bonds \nof guanxi are strongly encouraged to roleplay the fact that while they are no longer \nbound to their former wu-mates mystically, they typically still harbor some strong \nfeelings for them, good or bad. \nOverall, it is not unusual to find a wu composed of individuals with vastly \ndiffering Dharmas, directions and Natures who fight with each other like cats in \na sack on their own time, but who band together with frightening efficiency in the \nfield.

After checking with Evan, the \nStoryteller, he decides he wishes to play one of the Kuei-jin. Jim puts on an \ninspirational CD while the two of them take a copy of the rulebook and sit down \nto create a character. \nSTEP ONE: &WcrW \nJim begins by looking for a concept, a basic idea around which he can build \nhis character. Knowing that Kuei-jin frequently return to life to settle old scores, \nJim thinks for a while before coming up with an idea. He imagines a simple laborer \nand devoted family man who was murdered by a vicious tong for failing to pay \nprotection money, and who was forced to watch his children be murdered before \nhis own death came. Now his character seeks to punish his killers and defend any \nhelpless children he finds. Such a powerful and wrenching motive could easily \ninspire a soul to return from Yomi, and Evan approves the idea. Looking further \ninto the concept, Jim settles on Yang for his character’s Chi balance (he came back \nbecause of his deep love of life), as well as choosing the eastern direction (also a \nnatural choice for a character devoted to protecting mortals). Weighing several \npossibilities, Jim settles on the Dance of the Thrashing Dragon Dharma for his \ncharacter. Seeing Evan’s curious look, Jim explains that while the hedonistic \ntendencies of the other Laughing Rainbows disturb his character, their deep \nconnection to the pulse of life is more important to him than anything else. \nThinking about how he wishes to play the character, Jim selects a Trickster \nDemeanor and a Caregiver Nature. While fun-loving and accessible around \nchildren, his character is actually quite nurturing and caring at heart. To balance \nthis concept, Jim selects the Fool as his P’o Archetype. His Demon is forever trying \nmock his gentle ways and exaggerate the simple goodness ofhis nature into failure. \nFor the last part, Jim consults a name book and selects a good Chinese name for his \ncharacter - \nJo-Loung. Jim is ready to move on to the next step. \nsmrio: \nJim now has to prioritize Jo-Loung’s Attribute categories, to determine his \nbasic strengths and weaknesses. He takes Physical as Jo-Loung’s primary Trait \ncategory, Social as his secondary, and Mental as his tertiary. Jim explains that Jo- \nLoung was a construction worker by day, building the high rises of Hong Kong \n(Physical), and that he has always had a good sense of humor and related well to \npeople (Social), but that sometimes his wit runs ahead of his smarts (Mental). Now \nJim must choose individual Traits for each category, beginning with seven Physical \nTraits. He picks Nimble, Robust, Wiry, Quick, Robust, Enduring and Steady. That \nselection reflects Jo-Loung’s construction background and conjures an image of a \nsturdy worker who’s still pretty quick on his feet when he has to be - \nnot a bad \nthing when you’re 70 stories up! Next is Social, with five Traits, and Jim chooses \nthe Traits Charismatic, Empathetic, Witty, Persuasive and Empathetic, demonstrat- \ning Jo-Loung’s strong sense of humor and his easygoing appeal to others, as well as \nhis natural respect for the feelings of others. Finally comes Mental, with only three \nTraits. Jim selects Clever, Creative and Wily - \nJo-Loung is pretty sharp when it \ncomes to a con or a story, but a bit out of his league when it comes to book-learning \nand perception skills. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

He decides that hanging around \nwith the rough-and-tumble lot of construction workers rubbed off on Jo-Loung a \nbit during his life, and he selects the Brawl, Dodge and Athletics Abilities. These \nskills should prove helpful along the Road Back as well. However, he wants to make \nsure that he details Jo-Loung’s sensitive side as well. Jim picks a level of Empathy \nand Medicine, reflecting the care the vampire has taken to learn to mend as well as \ninjure. There are some other Abilities Jim would like Jo-Loung to have, but that’s \nall the levels he gets for now, so Jim makes a note to return to this section during \nthe Free Trait stage and continues. \nDisciplines come next; Jim decides that rather than focusing his powers in one \nparticular area, Jo-Loung has learned a wide variety of powers from his Thrashing \nDragon teachers. With only three levels of Disciplines to use (and at least one of \nwhich must be a Demon Art), Jim examines the choices carefully before selecting \none level of the Flesh Shintai, one level of the Yang Prana Discipline, and for his \nDemon Art he chooses a level of Black Wind. Jim rationalizes the first two choices \nas natural extensions ofhis character’s love of and mastery over the living, dynamic \nform, while the Black Wind is a reminder of the sometimes grim nature of Jo- \nbung’s Road Back. Evan looks the choices over and approves them, liking what \nhe’s seeing develop before him. \nJo-Loung’s has five levels of Backgrounds to spend. Jim selects more mundane \nones first, taking Contacts x 2 (local street urchins who keep him informed) and a \nlevel of AUies (a dedicated child services worker who knows the nature of his quest \nand who often cuts through red tape on his behalf). Looking to add a more exotic \ntwist to his character than the “average Joe” image that started coming across, Jim \nspends the last two levels on the Horoscope Background. Jo-Loung may think his \nquest is humble enough, but certaincelestial powers have taken notice ofhis efforts \nso far, for better or worse. Such a mysterious thread is bound to make for some \ninteresting stories later on. Finally, Jim must assign Jo-Loung’s Chi Virtues (he \nbegins with one Trait in each type automatically). He assigns three Traits to Yang \nand one to Yin, giving him permanent ratings of four Yang Traits and two Yin \nTraits. Once play begins, he will have to be careful if he wishes to avoid \nimbalancing himself with Chi energies, but otherwise, the choice makes perfect \nsense for the lie-driven Jo-bung. Jim is now finished with this stage of character creation. \nJim must now record Jo-Loung’s starting Soul Virtues, Willpower, Dharma \nand beginning Chi Traits. He begins with the Soul Virtues. All Kuei-jin begin play \nwith one Trait of Hun and three P’o Traits, so he indicates these on his sheet. All \nKuei-jinalso beginwith three WillpowerTraits andone DharmaTrait, sohewrites \nthese down dutifully as well. As for his beginning Chi, Jo-Loung starts with a \nnumber of temporary Chi traits equal to his ratings in each Chi Virtue - \nin his \ncase, that is four Yang Traits and two Yin Traits. Not bad, but not excellent either. \nJim also records the effects of his Dharma Strength and Dharma Weakness on his \nsheet at this time. The ability to restore Yang will no doubt prove helpful, but Jim \nwill have to work with Evan to help figure out his beginning vice, since none spring \nto mind for someone like Jo-Loung.

Jim \nexplains that Jo-Loung has come to realize just how poorly many children in the \nMiddle Kingdom are treated since his Second Breath, and as such, he has \ndeveloped a seething hatred of adults who mistreat children. The Flaw is detrimen- \ntal because, while such individuals typically deserve some justice, Jo-Loung bears \nsuch a strong animosity that it can get in the way of his reason. It may even threaten \nhis Dharma as he indulges in terrible punishments against the offenders he catches. \nEvan feels the threat posed by the Flaw is being properly approached and approves \nit. Finally, Jim selects the Flaw: Phobia (Chustrophobia), worth two Traits. While \nmany Kuei-jin are at least mildly claustrophobic due to their time in the grave, Jo- \nLoung was murdered and left in a small closet with the bodies of his children. \nEntering any such confined area forces him to resist wave soul as he remembers the \nstaring eyes of his dead sons. \nAfter taking one more look, Jim is satisfied by his choice of Flaws and moves \non.

Of'course, many Kuei- \njin in the Fifth Age forget their holy mission to battle the Yama Kings and indulge \ntheir darkest whims, feeling above punishment when it comes to taking whatever \nthey wish from the mortals around them. That means that these lonely hunters are \nmore pressed than ever to keep the Kuei-jin in line. Fortunately, if there are any \nmortals up to the challenge, the Shih are just such warriors. \nFounded by Yi, a Chinese warrior-mage during the Age of Legends, the Shih \nare solitary hunters who are drawn from the ranks of mortals touched by the hand \nof the supernatural at some time in their past. Many are orphans of one kind of shen \nrampage or another, although the mentors who choose new Shih are careful to \ntemper revenge with proper discipline to avoid needless deaths in the field. Shih \ntrain for a minimum of 15 years, during which time they are required to master a \nvariety of subjects ranging from martial arts and weapon combat to occult lore and \ncourtly etiquette.

Traveling alone, as is their \nancient custom, only toughens this resolve, since they know the chances of any \nkind of reinforcements arriving are slim at best. When they are finally released from \ntheir master’s side, having studied the shen firsthand and trained exhaustively for \nnearly two decades, the Shih are more than capable opponents for even experi- \nenced supernatural creatures. More than one cocky kyonshi has met Final Death at \nthe hands of one of these nomads after refusing to change his arrogant ways. \nFor their part, most Shih really do try to give shen that they see as out of line \na chance to redeem themselves. While they do not bother to parlay with chih-mei \nand other mindless abominations, Shih often put themselves in a great deal of \ndanger in order to redeem a particular shen before resorting to combat, if they feel \nthere is a even a slight chance of success. Of course, once sentence has been \npronounced, the Shih are grimly efficient in carrying it out, no matter the cost to \nthemselves. Shih are also typically a hardy and pragmatic lot who will go from \nnobly defending apeasant village from a rampaging chih-mei to picking the pockets \nof the dead monster in order to pay for their next meal. They justif, their way of \nlife by the sacred charge they uphold, but they are also worldly enough to realize \nthat generous rewards for their work will be few and far between, and so they do \nwhat they must to survive. Considering that many communities in this day and age \ndo their best to forget about the monsters walking among them, including the \nhunters who vanquish them, the Shih are seldom motivated by a desire for fame \nand praise anyway. Instead, the Shih live and die between the cracks of modem \nsociety in the hopes that their efforts help restore some balance to the grand \nexpanse of Heaven. \nShih discipline offers several tangible benefits to those who choose to adhere \nto its strict training regimen: the Qiao (the Chinese word for “bridge”). Qiao are \nsupernatural powers that help balance the scales between the dread powers of the \nshen and the hunters who dare stalk them. \nQiaOo-lSrmU \nUsing Yang Chi, the Shih may prepare special prayers on silk or paper, which \nthen become capable of hindering and harming demons in various ways. These \nprayers may be prepared hours in advance of their use, and they retain their magic \nfor up to one day. Unless otherwise noted, each prayer requires one Yang Trait and \n15 minutes per level of the Qiao to create. The prayers may be thrown at any target \nthe Shih can see (including invisible foes sensed through various Qiao powers), \nand once thrown, the prayers fly around obstacles-making all but complete cover \nuseless-andotherwisedefy physics toreach their target. Hittingatargetwith the \nprayers still requires a successful Melee Challenge, however. \nNote: Most of these powers must be dodged if the target wishes to avoid their \neffect. In other words, some speed- or agility-related Trait (such as Quick or Agile) \nmust be bid if the target wishes to defend against them. Traits such as Enduring or \nBrawny do not function as a defense against these powers, although of course the \ntarget may choose to attack in response instead of merely defending. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

(It is \nhighly recommended that Shih intensify their combat training as much as \npossible. They are on their own, after all, and the shen are the deadliest of \nfoes.) Shih may also begin play with more than two levels of Martial Arts, \ndue to their focused training. Thus, Shih characters start with extremely \nhoned talents, but at a cost to player flexibility. \nShih automatically receive the Background: Mentor x 3. \nAll Shih begin play with one level in each of the following Chi \nPowers: Ruu, of the Mo Kung, Qiao of the 1 Shen and Qiao of the Yu An. \nAdditional levels cost four Free Traits during character creation, and the \nfollowing number of Experience Traits apply once play begins: three for \nBasic Qiao, five for Intermediate and eight for Advanced. \nAs players will no doubt have noticed by now, Shih are extremely \nstrong for beginning characters. That unbalance is due to two factors. First, \nall Shih have spent a great deal of time being trained by masters well-versed \nin the arts of demon-hunting, and (more importantly) Shih characters are \nintended to work alone. Even in a larger troupe, the Shih is expected to carry \nhis own weight, tend his own wounds and otherwise avoid any needless \npersonal entanglements. That life may seem very cool and rugged at first, \nbut loneliness should begin to take its toll as time goes by and the Shih \nrealizes some of the disadvantages of going solo. Of course, Shih aren’t \nfoolish. If taking down a particular shen requires teamwork, they’ll play \nalong, but players who always try to band together like a bunch of kung-fu \nSuper Friends bent on kicking Kuei-jin butt are doing their characters a \ngrave disservice. The Shih have walked their solitary roads for millennia, \nd they see no reason to change their ways now. \nBasic \nCelestial Punishment - \nBy casting these prayers at his target, the Shih may \ncause demons pain and even injure certain shen. Demons suffer extreme agony \n(two-Trait penalty on all challenges for five minutes), but vampires and wraiths \nalso suffer a single aggravated wound.

This power does not \naffect incorporeal beings. \nIntermediate \nHeavenly Flames - \nUpon hitting their target, these prayers burst into \nsupernatural blue flames, igniting and inflicting aggravated wounds. This power \nmay be soaked with conventional means as well as supernatural ones, but it inflicts \nthree levels of aggravateddamage. Furthermore, the target must win or tie a Simple \nTest every turn to try to extinguish the flames ifhe is wearing anything combustible \n(fur counts). The flames inflict one additional aggravated wound every turn that \nthey continue to bum. \nCelestial Fires -This power is identical to Heavenly Flames, except that the \nfires caused may only be soaked by supernatural means. \nAdvanced \nHeaven’s Thunder - \nThis awesome power seldom leaves a demon standing, \nsince it vents the very wrath of Heaven in one spectacular display. A Shih who uses \nthis power is assured of doing at least some damage to his target, but the cost is \ncorrespondingly high. Thus, this power is used most sparingly by the demon- \nhunters who know it. These prayers blaze from the Shih‘s hand like lightning once \ncast, seeking out the demon she has chosen, and they hit their target automatically. \nNothing less than divine intervention can keep these prayers from their target, \nalthoughcertain Advancedsupernatural powers might be helpful at the Storyteller’s \ndiscretion. (This is the wrath of Heaven, after all.) These prayers inflict a base of \nfour aggravated wound levels, plus an additional aggravated wound for each Simple \nTest the Shih wins against his target. Compare Mental Traits in the event of ties; \nthe first test won by the target ends the challenge. These wounds cannot be soaked, \nbut regardless of the outcome of this power, the Shih suffers one unsoakable wound. \nThis power costs two Yang Traits.

By \nspending one Yang Trait, the Shih gains a free retest on all strength-related \nchallenges and the Physical Traitx &amy x 2 and Wiry for the remainder of the scene. \nCelestial Eyes - \nClearing his mind of all distractions, the Shih may focus his \nsenses to detect minute, even virtually nonexistent phenomena. Spending one \nYang Trait, the Shih gains the Mental Traits: Discerning, Observant, Attentive and \nthe Danger Sense Merit (as his senses catch the tiny warning signs around him). The \nShih also gains a free retest on any Investigation or Enigmas Challenges related to \nsense perception. This power lasts for the remainder of the scene. \nAdvanced \nBody ofthe Dragon-Though \nincredibly draining, this potent power allows \nthe Shih to boost his body’s capabilities to truly superhuman levels for a time. This \npower costs one Willpower Trait and twoYang Traits to activate, but it doubles the \nShih‘s Physical Traits for the remainder of the scene. (Bonus Traits due to other \npowers are added after the doubling is calculated, not before.) The Shih also wins \nall ties in Physical Challenges unless his opponent possesses a similar power, in \nwhich case, the winner is determined normally. Once the scene is over, the Shih \nmust rest for several hours before he can do more than walk a few steps, and the \nbenefits of this power are reversed until such rest takes place. \nQtpo OFTHE Xu Aq \nThe Bndge ofjade Hamny allows a Shih to resist the “mind tricks” of the shen \nand to see them for what they truly are. At higher levels of mastery, it allows the \ndemon-hunter to consult and battle the spirits on their own plane, although such \nmethods are as dangerous as they are potentially rewarding. For uses beyond the \nBasic level, the Unseen Master should be present to play the role of the spirits and \nadjudicate any combats or other interactions. A character must carry jade in some \nform to use this Qiao. \nBasic \nOpened Eyes - \nElegant in its function, this power reveals supernatural \nbeings in their true forms. The Shih can see wraiths, perceive hsien and Kuei-jin \nfor what they are, even detect hengeyokai in their mortal forms. Simply put, any \ncreature that tries to hide its true nature from the Shih is incapable of doing so, and \nthe player may ask any other players out of character what type of supernatural \ncreature they are (if they are one at all). Note, however, that this power does not \nwork against those actively using magic to hide themselves (such as characters \nunder the effects of Shrouded Moon or Unseen Presence) or change their shape. This \npower lasts for one scene, and it also renders the character immune to the Delirium \nduring that time. \nDivine Perceptions -This power allows the Shih to see into a target’s soul, \nusually to determine if they are lying but also to see if they are possessed by demons \nor otherwise under supernatural influence. Detecting lies requires that the Shih‘s \nplayer defeat the target in a Static Mental Challenge (difficulty of the target’s \nMental Traits); success tells the character if the target was indeed lying. The Shih \nmay also detect possession or other supernatural influence by winning an identical \nStatic Mental Challenge. If successful, the Shih‘s player may expend two Mental \nTraits to discern exactly who/ what is responsible for the influence.

The player must spend one Chi Trait of the type of spirits he wishes to \noverhear (Yin for ghosts, Yang for natural spirits) and concentrate for 30 seconds. \nDuring that time, the character hears the voices of the spirits growing louder until \nthey reach a normal conversational level. As soon as that occurs, the character may \nspeak freely with the spirits or simply listen to them as he sees fit. This ability lasts \nfor one scene. \nCelestial Window - \nContinuing on the path of spiritual discourse, the Shih \nmay now attune himself to one spirit, effectively joining its plane of existence. The \nShih may touch, hurt, help or fight the spirit as if both of them were in the same \nplace, and the spirit may return such treatment in kind. This power affects only the \nShih in regards to one spirit. Other spirits may not engage him in the same manner \nunless they possess powers of their own to do so. By the same token, the Shih cannot \nfollow if the spirit flees the character’s presence. This power costs one Chi Trait of \nthe type appropriate to the spirit and lasts for once scene. \nAdvanced \nCelestial Doorway - \nThis grand but often foolhardy power allows the Shih \nto open himself up to interaction with spirits ofboth the Yin and Yang Worlds. The \neffects are the same as those of Celestial Window, but now the Shih may interact \nwith all the spirits in the area from both realms, despite the fact that he remains \non the physical plane of existence. Of course, the spirits may interact with him \nright back, and considering the enmity many of them have toward the Shih, this \npower often results in a swift demise unless the demon-hunter is extremely careful. \nThe doorway requires the expenditure of one Yin Trait and one Yang Trait, and \nit lasts for one scene or until the Shih chooses to close it (which is often very quickly). \nThe Bridge ofthe Phoenix is a simple tool in the Shih‘s employ, but a powerful \nand useful one, for it is the way of healing. With so many foes that deliver so many \nkinds of devastating attacks, the Shih cannot wait for or trust modem medicine to \ncure their many injuries. They rely instead on this Bridge and other natural means \nof healing. It should be noted that by spending Chi, a character is essentially \nexpending her life-force to rebuild her body. It is much easier and more relaxing \nto heal the damage done by spending several Chi Traits than it would be to heal \nthe damage done by a bakemono’s flaming breath. It should also be noted that this \nBridge leaves scars in its wake, which most Shih are very proud of, considering \nthem a mark of their ability to survive. \nQia 0 m - q  \nBasic \nBarriet uf Pain - \nBy spending one Yin Trait, the Shih renders herself immune \nto pain for the remainder of the scene. The character suffers no wound penalties, and \nshe may continue to act normally until she is reduced below Incapacitated. \nTheclosing Wound-Channeling \nYin Chi through her body, the character \nmay repair some of the damage done to her. This power does not function on burns, \nsevered nerves or broken bones, but it will heal all other wounds as well as poisons \nand minor diseases.

At the Narrator’s discre- \ntion, this healing may also remove Lame Negative Traits and other baneful results \nof crippling attacks. \nEscape from Death - \nAll manner of wounds may be healed through use of \nthis power, even bums or the ravages of supernatural foes. This process is efficient \nbut extremely time-consuming - \nrequiring one hour per health level to be healed \n- \nbut even aggravated wounds may be healed by use of this power. The Shih‘s \nplayer must succeed in a Static Mental Challenge against a difficulty of the number \nof health levels she wishes to heal and spend three Y in Traits to activate this power. \nOnce underway, the character must eat enormous amounts of food to replace the \nenergy used in the healing process. If the Shih is disturbed in any serious way \n(combat and other adventuring are straight out), the process ends, and any \nremaining damage remains unhealed. \nAdvanced \nFlames ofthe Phoenix - \nShih with this ability may effectively rebuild their \nbodies on a cellular level, curing the effects of cancer, radiation exposure, severe \ntrauma and even old age. Few of the Shih adept in this knowledge readily attempt \nit, however, for it places an enormous drain on their bodies that can easily kill those \nnot in perfect health and possessed of perfect discipline. The Shihmust spend three \nY in Traits, three Yang Traits and two permanent Willpower Traits to invoke Flames \nof the Phoenix, and she must succeed at a Static Physical Challenge against a \ndifficulty of nine Traits (this challenge may be retested with the Occult Ability). \nFailure means all the listed costs are paid, but nothing happens. Success indicates \nthat the character is rebuilt from the ground up - \ncancer and other ill effects \nvanish, scars fade, fingerprints change, retinal structures alter, bones shift and the \ncharacter may even experience a change in height. In essence, the character is \nrebom into a whole new body. Obviously, the player should adopt some new garb \nor descriptive tag to indicate the change in her character’s appearance, since it is \nnext to impossible for even those closest to her to recognize her for who she truly \nis.

Once the scene is over, the Shih is exhausted, and he must rest \nfor a considerable amount of time (Storyteller’s decision on how long is needed). \nUntil such rest is attained, the Shih is reduced to no more than one Physical Trait. \nHe also loses all ties on Physical Challenges. \nThe Bndge ofthe Mirror is a vital part of a demon-hunter’s arsenal, as it protects \nher Chi and allows her to manipulate the Chi of her enemies. Since no Shih wants \nto risk being contaminated by such energies, however, many uses of this Bridge \ninvolve a weapon of some kind.

The \nShih must spend a Yang Trait and declare that she is redirecting the attack, then \nengage her foe in the appropriate challenge (the Shih uses her Physical Traits in \nthis challenge, no matter what might normally be required). The Shih may retest \nthis challenge with the Occult Ability. Success means the attack has been \nredirected, and the player may make a Firearms Challenge immediately to attempt \nto strike her foe with the redirected attack.

Success means the target is unable to gain \nChi for five minutes, although he may spend any Chi he still has normally. \nClutch of the Wan Kuei - \nBy executing a special strike with her chosen \nweapon, the Shih may attempt to steal some of the target’s Chi, which is then \nabsorbed into the weapon itself. The Shih cannot make use of this stolen Chi, but \nneithercan the target.

For each successful challenge, one Chi Trait of the \ncharacter’s choice is stolen from the target of her next successful Meke attack. \nAdvanced \nBite of the Mu - \nThis rare technique allows the Shih to steal Chi from her \nopponent and use it in an attack against him. The Shih must first defeat her \nopponent in a number of Mental Challenges (no Traits risked); the Shih may \ncontinue to test until she loses.

For obvious \nreasons, it is very popular with older Shih whose bodies have begun to fail them, \nor physically slight Shih who enjoy beating the shen at their own game. \nBasic \nEyes ofthe Dragon - \nAn intimidated opponent is defeated before a single \nblow is struck, and Shih who use this power are capable of stopping many fights \nbefore they begin. The character must stare straight at his foe, spend one Yin Trait \nand defeat his opponent in a Social Challenge. Lesser opponents are cowed and \neven superior foes are taken aback at such ferocity, but the end result is the same. \nThose defeated by this power must count out 15 seconds during which time they \nare effectively stunned and may take no offensive action (though they may defend \nthemselves if need be). The Shih may use this power as a means of Fair Escape in \nsome situations. \nDark Retlection - \nThis ability forces one of the shen to realize the conse- \nquences of his actions, and it is used primarily as a means of reinforcing the justice \nof the Shih on errant supematurals. The Shih must defeat his target in a Mental \nChallenge and spend one Yin Trait to use this power, and those so defeated are two \nTraits down on all aggressive actions for the remainder of the scene as the weight \nof their actions bears down on them.

This task must be something the spirit can do, although it need \nnot be something the spirit would normally like to do. Spirits may not be \ncommanded to destroy themselves, though they can be told to attack others. \nAbove all, the command must be simple and direct, and most Shih are very careful \nin choosing how to word their commands, since most spirits will follow only the \nletter and not the intent of the order.

The Shih also learns how to correct such imbalances. Meditation is \noften the answer (one day of uninterrupted meditation corrects one point of Chi \nimbalance), but herbs, chants and other means may also be used. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

The player must make two Static Mental \nChallenges with the Meditation Ability to use this power, the first to detect the \nproblem memory and the second to remove its burden; both these challenges are \nagainst adifficulty of eight Traits. Successfully completing both of these challenges \nand expending a Yang Trait renders the memory harmless, although the character \nmust relive it in vivid detail before it finally leaves her. Obviously, the effects of this \nability are largely a matter of roleplaying, although the Storyteller may rule that \nthis power can be used to reduce the cost of buying off a Flaw such as Nightmares \nor Phobia. A player may even cure a derangement attached to a memory by \nspending a Willpower Trait in addition to the Yang Trait required. \nSelf-Exorcism - \nSometimes a demon is able to get past the strict mental \ndefenses of a Shih and inhabit her body. By invoking a psychic contest with the \ninvading force, this power gives the demon-hunter a second chance to throw off \nsuch a malevolent influence before it inflicts any further harm. The Shih must \nmake a Mental Challenge (no Traits risked) against the demon’s P’o or Rage rating \nand spend two Yang Traits. Success means the demon is cast out, while failure \nmeans the demon holds fast. \nAdvanced \nMental Dominion- With this potent talent, the Shih is able to fully restore \nher Willpower and even weaken her P’o (if it is active).

This method of \ntravel leaves no tracks or scent to mark his passing, and allows the Shih to travel \nin complete silence.

The Faerie Crushing Fists technique may sound \ngood, but if all it does is allow Shih to pound unopposed on the hsien in the \nchronicle, it’s probably not a good idea to allow it. Always use game balance as the \nultimate guideline. If any or all of these special techniques threaten to upset the \ngame too much, remove them. (The Shih are quite strong enough without them, \nafter all!) \nSnout Strike - \nThe shapeshifting hengeyokai all have a particular weak \nspot, typically in the nose area, where many nerve ganglia are focused in one spot. \nTargeting that spot and executing a successful strike, the Shih can place the target \nin a great deal of pain, thus distracting him and keeping him off-balance. The Shih \nmust declare this technique and make asuccessful attack. Not only does the target \nsuffer the normal damage, but the intense pain puts him down two Traits for the \nnext three combat turns as well. The only downside is that excessive use of this \ntechnique may cause the target to frenzy, at which point the benefit of the \ntechnique is lost. \nTraits Down: 2 \nChi Breaker - \nThis move, used almost exclusively against the Kuei-jin, \nallows the Shih to disrupt the natural Chi flow in his target. The Shih must declare \nthat he is using the technique, spend a Y in Trait and then strike his target. He need \nnot cause any damage (though often he chooses to); he needs only touch the \nvampire to be affected. If successful, the Shih‘s player may spend a variable number \nof Mental Traits. The Kuei-jin cannot spend any Chi Traits for as many turns as \nthe number of Mental Traits spent. This technique has saved more than one \ndemon-hunter from certain death, as their undead foe retreated to regroup or lost \ntheir winning edge at a crucial moment. This attack inflicts normal damage in \naddition to its disruptive benefits. \nTraits Down: 2 \nJaw Hammer - \nMany shen use their teeth as weapons, and this technique is \ndesigned to remove just such an attack from the shen’s arsenal. It is dangerous at \nbest, however. By doing so, the Shih leaves himself open to retribution the next \nturn, so most get it right on the first try. The Shih must declare the technique and \nstrike his foe precisely right. Not only must he score a successful hit, but he must \nwin an additional Simple Test to actually break the jaw correctly. Failure on the \nSimple Test means the target may still bite normally, albeit at a one-Trait penalty \ndue to the odd alignment of its teeth. Success means the target may not use biting \nattacks until the damage is fully regenerated. If the Shih fails on the initial attack, \nhe cannot use the Dodge Ability the next turn - \nhis positioning makes him too \nvulnerable to his opponent. This attack inflicts the standard amount of damage, \nwhether the jaw is actually broken or not. \nTraits Down: 2 \nFading Light Strike - \nThe Shih must use a long weapon such as a sword or \nstaff for this technique. Simple hand-to-hand combat will not suffice, as the risk \nof infection by dark energy is too great. This potent technique allows the Shih to \nsteal the energies of his target and use those forces against her - \nChi is taken from \nKuei-jin, while Rage is taken from hengeyokai, and so on. This attack does not \ninflict any physical damage, but the metaphysical effects can be devastating.

This technique \nrequires an exceptional knowledge of the target to be successful: The Shih must \npossess at least three levels each of Medicine and Occult to perform this maneuver, \nand each effort costs the Shih himself one Yang Trait. \nTraits Down: 3 \nhe/Cripple Fighting - \nMany older Shih disguise themselves as crippled, \nwizened beggars, and even the best of hunters occasionally finds himself knocked \non his butt or otherwise fighting from a bad spot. Shih with this training can spend \na Willpower Trait to ignore any penalties arising from such inauspicious circum- \nstances for the remainder of the scene, allowing them to ignore their apparent \ndisadvantage. While they cannot ignore wound penalties or such severe flaws as \nblindness or multiple missing limbs, they may fight normally from prone positions \nand ignore any hm, \nDecrepit or similar Negative Traits they might possess. Such \nis the origin of legends of one-armed or one-legged Shih who still somehow manage \nto defeat scores of Kuei-jin in a single melee. Such tales may still be a bit \nexaggerated, but trained warriors can learn to overcome amazing flaws if the need \nis great. \nStealing Eagle Wings - \nVery few Shih are skilled enough to pull this \ntechnique off, but those that are can be counted among the most frightening and \neffective demon-hunters in the Middle Kingdom. Using an instinctive grasp of \npressure holds and lightning-fast reflexes, the Shih may grab hold of ashen who is \nunleashing a burst of supernatural speed and essentially ride the enemy’s own \nmomentum, allowing the Shih to keep up with his opponent step for blazing step. \nA Shih must have at least five levels of Martial Arts and four levels of Akrmess to \nperform this technique, and he must have scored a successful grappling strike \nagainst his opponent on the turn in question. If his opponent then chooses to use \nextra actions that turn (Blackwind, Rage, Celerity, etc.), the Shih may respond by \nspending a Yang Trait to activate this technique. Essentially, the Shih is then \nconsidered to gain an equal number of extra actions in response, povlded he \ncontinuestoholdontohistargetanddoesn’tattackanyoneelse. Inotherwords, theshih \nmay not only continue to try to injure his opponent during the course of the extra \nactions, but he receives a one-Trait bonus for every extra action he “steals” in this \nfashion. Normally, characters without extra actions can only soak the attacks - \nthey can’t dodge or harm the attacker. Thus, if a Shih with this technique grabs \nhold of a hengeyokai and it spends three Rage Traits for extra actions that turn, the \nShih receives a one-Trait bonus on the first action, two Traits on the second, and \nso on as he turns his opponent’s movements against him. Smart opponents will \nattempt to disentangle themselves completely from the Shih, thus negating this \ntechnique, but few are thinking that clearly at the time. They only know that the \nfaster they move, the more control the Shih seems to have over them! \nTraits Down: None. Using this technique is considered a reflexive response, \nnot an action. \nWhile the Shih try to maintain the purity of purpose that Heaven intended \nfor the shen, there are others who see the supernatural as without place in this or \nany other world, and who do their best to ensure that the Unseen World is burned \naway wherever they can find it.

It deals primarily with the \ngaki and other native shen of that nation, although its operatives are granted \nfrequent special permission to travel abroad through backroom deals with neigh- \nboring nations (usually in exchange for ridding the host country of a “little \nproblem” or two).

Zero teams are never less than five members, each \nwirh a particular area of expertise - \nassassin, bombardier, cyber-rat, pilot and \nsnoop. The teams are typically close-knit and extremely loyal, (since they know \nthat the slightest hesitation in the field might cost one or all of them their lives), \nand agents train extensively together to hone their reactions to peak efficiency. \nSince Zero agents are taken away from their former lives, the team usually \nfunctions as a surrogate family of sorts as well, making for even closer bonds and \na more personal stake in the greater cause against the shen. Though it may cost \nthem their lives, Strike Force Zero agents are prepared to uncover and destroy the \nshen menace wherever it may be found.

Remember that each SFO agent begins play \nwith at least two of these enhancements already, and they all may purchase more. \nEmotion Suppressers -This enhancement releases powerful chemicals into \nthe agent’s bloodstream during moments of terror, effectively rendering the \ncharacter immune to panicking and to effects such as the Delirium, the Veil, the \nMists and so on. Essentially, the agent is distantly aware of the fact that he should \nbe terrified, but he remains able to act normally. Note that the memories of these \nevents aren’t removed either. Thus, many SFO agents suffer from chronic night- \nmares after their encounters with the shen. This device costs one Yang Chi per day. \nGills - \nPlaced at strategic points throughout a character’s body, these filters \nextract and store oxygen for use during underwater operations or in hostile \nenvironments. The agent becomes immune to most toxic gases simply by holding \nher breath. A Yang Trait is required every time the character must rely on her gills \nfor an extended period of time (more than a minute). \nNight Eyes - \nThese mechanical eyes allow the character to function at no \npenalty in complete darkness. There is no cost for using night eyes, although \nsudden bright lights may blind the character for a turn before the eyes adjust \n(Storyteller’s discretion). \nVideo Eyes - \nThis device allows the character to record up to one hour of \ncolor sound and video. Retrieval of the data requires removal of the eye, which in \nturn requires surgery - \nquick and painless work, but surgery nonetheless. Video \neyes cost one Yang Trait every time they’re used. A character with this enhance- \nment can ask those whose actions he’s recorded to “replay” their actions for him \nout of character to simulate what the video eye “witnessed.” \nSpy Eyes - \nEssentially a detachable camera, spy eyes are equipped with six \ntiny legs for motion, and they can be left by an agent in a location to observe events \ntaking place there. Thus, the character may observe any events his eye is \nwimessing. During the time the eye is detached, however, the character develops \na nasty case of double vision if attempting other actions. He incurs a two-Trait \npenalty to combat and other involved activities as long as the spy eye is active.

It is important to note that while Strike Force Zero \ndoctors are capable of placing most of these enhancements in any limb the patient \ndesires, doing so may inhibit the proper usage of the enhancement in question in \nsome cases. A pulse cannon in your leg may make an excellent weapon of \ndesperation, but it’s quite awkward to aim under normal circumstances (to say the \nleast). Storytellers should feel free to impose penalties on characters whose \nenhancements are located in difficult or inconvenient places for the task at hand. \nFurthermore, each related enhancement has several security features to \nensure that the agent doesn’t accidentally shoot his foot off with a plasma cannon \nor release his cyberclaws while picking his nose (ouch). An agent must concentrate \non the enhancement as well as speak, loudly and clearly, a command phrase before \nthe enhancement will activate. Naturally, the phrase should be something fairly \nexotic if one wishes to avoid accidentally discharging a taser in public. For \nexample, phrases like “Hello” and “Fine, thank you” are notably poor choices, \nwhile “Burning Plasma Cannon!” and “Six4troke Slashing Claws!” are more \nappropriate. The doctors say these measures are all necessary for security reasons, \nalthough many agents think privately that the experts are just pulling a prank on \nthem or even that they are overeager fans of anirne. Needless to say, such command \nphrases can make for some difficulty in stealth situations. Then again, it’s pretty \nhard to muffle the report of a pulse cannon, anyway. \npulse Cannons - \nThese weapons are reliable and lethal, storing bioenergy \nand delivering it in a lethal bolt of radiation designed to disrupt the bioelectrical \nfield of anything it strikes. Firing a pulse cannon is treated the same as any other \nFiream Challenge. Pulse cannons give three bonus traits, have the Negative \nTrait: Loud and deliver three levels of lethal damage on a successful hit. Pulse \ncannons cost two Yin Traits with each use, making them weapons of last resort \nindeed. Even with their high cost, however, pulse cannons are preferred over tasers \nby most SFO agents. While the cannons may not do as much serious damage, tasers \nrequire an agent to get in close with their target, and all but the most green recruits \nknow that close combat with the shen is a quick ticket to suicide. \nTasers - \nThese microfine wire implants only work in close combat with a \ntarget. Actual contact isn’t necessary, but the target can be no further away than \nnormal melee range. They are used almost exclusively against shen, as the charge \ndelivered (500 volts at 100 amps, roughly enough to quick-fry a bull elephant) will \nkill almost any human target. Tasers give two bonus Traits and have the Negative \nTrait: Short. A successful use of the tasers inflicts three health levels of aggravated \ndamage on the target. In addition, the Narrator is encouraged to rule that normal \nmortals - \nnot player characters or critical villains! -are simply killed outright by \nthe intense electricity.

Many agents have sheaths installed to hide \nstriker guns, though such sheaths must be placed in the leg due to the size of the \nweapon. The sheaths even shield the pocket from x-rays and metal detectors, and \nthey are completely invisible and undetectable when closed. Opening the sheath \ndoes not count as an action, although reaching for something inside might depend \non where the sheath is located. Sheaths cost nothing to use, although shielding \nthem from electronic detection costs one Yang Trait per scene. \nCyberclaws - \nIdeal close-combat weapons, cyberclaws extend a full eight \ninches from the body. The ankles, wrists, elbows and knees are favorite places to \ninstall these claws. Cyberclaws give their wielder two bonus Traits during combat, \ncannot be disarmed and possess the Negative Trait: Short.

The communicator itself runs from the \nleft ear to the left side of the jaw, and it is activated by touching a spot on the jaw. \nDespite the name, no psionic talent is involved, although at the Narrator’s \ndiscretion certain beings with the Telepathy Numina or similar powers may \nsometimes detect the use of psi-band radios nearby. There is no Chi cost to use psi- \nband radio. In game terms, all team members using the radio are allowed to \ncommunicate privately any time their radio is active (even telepaths cannot \nactually “overhear” the conversations, only detect their presence).

Snake fangs \nare implants in the agent’s palm which allow them to deliver poisons via tiny air \nguns during melee combat. To use the snake fangs, a character must strike his \nopponent successfully with his fists and spend one Yin Trait. The target must then \nmake a Static Physical Challenge against adifficulty based on the intended severity \nand effect of the poison the agent is using. The fast-acting, nonlethal neurotoxins \nmost agents use are difficulty six, while stronger or more lethal substances would \nhave accordinglyhigher difficulties to resist. In order to smooth game-play later on, \nplayers should approach their Storytellers before the session and tell them what \npoison their character is using, then write down on an item card the difficulty to \nresist its effects and/ or any damage it may cause to the target.

Upon the use \nof the proper code phrase, the agent is three Traits up on all strength-related tests \nwith that limb (including relevant combat tests) and he inflicts an extra level of \nlethal damage (or two levels of bashing) on attacks made with that limb. At the \nNarrator’s discretion, the agent may also use his strength to punch or kick through \nwalls and other obstacles, but players should remember that the tissue surrounding \nthe limbs is not enhanced.

On a loss, the launcher jams, and it must be \nunjammed with the Firearms Ability. Otherwise, the launcher’s statistics are as \nfollows: two Bonus Traits, the Negative Trait: Awkward and damage/ effect \naccording to grenade type. The limb used also must be straightened completely \nbefore firing, in order to ensure a straight launch. The grenade may be fired or \nthrown, according to the agent’s preference. When it comes to damaging a large \ngroup (as with incendiary grenades), treat the test the same as the special weapon \nability: Spay. (See the combat section, p. XX, on how this ability is handled.) \nSome grenades, particularly smokers and flash-bangs, may also require a Narrator \nto describe the events in the area to characters involved. \nInternal Tracking Gear - \nThis revolutionary bit of technology allows an \nagent to track a target effectively even after being blinded, deafened or dazzled, \ncontrolling the agent’s reflexes and motor centers to keep the agent’s hand locked \nonto the target. Even if not impaired, the ITG helps improve the agent’s reflexes, \nbettering her aim. As long as the agent’s body chemistry indicates a combat \nsituation, the ITG continues to track a target. The character may ignore the \npenalties of blindness or deafness for the purposes of attacking her target, and if not \nimpaired, the ITG puts the agent one Trait up on all Fireawns and Meke tests \nagainst a tracked target. Activating the ITG costs one Yang Trait. \nWeb Spinners - \nNozzles in the character’s fingers are designed to emit a \nstream of fast-drying, steel-hard paste which can be used either as a short-range \nrestraint or a long-range snare according to the agent’s desires.

The web glue can be dissolved only by a special chemical \ncompound contained in the agent’s pinkie finger. Activation costs one Yin Chi, \nand the effective range is 10 paces. \nField Armor - \nThe rare Series IV Portable Analysis and Assault Station (or \n“field armor,” as agents insist on calling it) is a custom-designed suit of armor \nequipped with state-of-the-art sensor arrays, a communications linkup that allows \nfor mental activation of the suit’s functions and strength-enhancing gloves and \nboots. The sensors onboard allow an agent to analyze fingerprints, fiber samples, \nblood samples and genetic information discovered at the scene. A modem hookup \nallows for secure communication with SFO headquarters, a wide band radio scans \nlocal communications, and the suit contains visual and auditory enhancements for \ndiscerning additional information (agents effectively gain Sharpened Senses while \nthose systems are employed). The armor counts as a ballistic vest for purposes of \nabsorbing damage. Finally, the physical enhancers in the gloves and boots add an \nadditional level of damage in close combat. Each suit is crafted for a specific agent \n(including space for an agent’s own bionic enhancements), and it will not function \nfor anyone else. These suits are still being refined - \ndamage can easily upset the \nsuit’s delicate sensors at this stage of development. Most SFO agents don’t even \nthose know these suits exist, much less have a chance of being issued one. This \nenhancement cannot be selected without Storyteller approval. The suit costs no \nChi to use unless the wearer activates the enhancers in the gloves and boots -such \nusage costs one Yin Trait. \nKeypads - \nThese built-in bits of cyberware give the user access to secured \nsystems, allowing the character to analyze and bypass both computer systems as \nwell as physical or electronic defenses. Descramblers wired into the equipment are \ncapable of cracking most known codes easily, as well as adding new codes as they \ncrack the old. Keypads are implanted into a user’s hands, and they are always \nworking. Characters with this enhancement receive a free retest on all Security and \nComputer tests related to defeating a target’s defenses. Keypads cost one Yin Chi \nper day, but only if in “active mode”; otherwise, power-drain is minimal. \nKabuki Masks - \nThis enhancement allows a character to alter such subtle \nbut important factors as the length and width of their nose, the shape of their eyes, \nthe height of their cheekbones and even the length of their jawline in order to \ncreate a different appearance. Increasing or decreasing skin tension can even \nsimulate a different age, and manipulating the vocal chords can create a different \nvoice. The modifications are not complete enough to allow the agent to imperson- \nate someone else (unless they just happen to look a lot like their target already), \nbut may be used to blur the agent’s identity so that they are unrecognizable to those \nwho are looking for them. The change costs one Yang Trait, takes several (painful) \nminutes of adjustment and lasts until the agent decides to take on another face or \nresume her old appearance. Players using this advantage should adopt a posture or \nuse a description card to show their altered appearance. Since the change is an \nactual physical process, this disguise cannot be seen through by Heightened Senses \nor other powers, although the agent may still give herself away in other ways if not careful. \nb o D W O W ~ E u ( t  SnYK!! \n(iUW \nStriker Pistol - \nThe signature weapon of SFO, striker guns are built like \nnormal heavy pistols, but they are lighter, stronger and specially designed to \nfunction only for the agent to whom they’re issued.

This device allows a target to be tracked up to 100 miles \naway, and it is impossible to detect by normal means. It is otherwise quite harmless, \nand it will be ignored by the body’s immune system. Kuei-jin bodies, however, \nreject the device after 24 hours. \nEctoplasmic Disrupters: These bizarre rounds track the electromagnetic \nsignatures given off by wraiths and explode in a pulse of energy designed to disrupt \nthe wraith’s form. A successful hit from an ectoplasmic disrupter inflicts two levels \nof damage to a wraith‘s Corpus. Living beings are unharmed by disrupter rounds. \nRubberbullets: These rounds are treated exactly like normal rounds, except \nthey inflict bashing damage instead of lethal. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

They may be purchased normally during character creation (except \nwhere noted), and some will likely change quite a bit during play. \nStrike Force Zero agents can access wetware and other technology beyond the \nwildest dreams of contemporary scientists and technicians, allowing them to \nenhance their physical prowess, cognitive abilities and even alter their body \nstructure in outstanding ways. Every SFO agent begins with two such implants \nautomatically, and many opt for at least one or two more, although few agents have \nmore than three levels of this Background- the cost to them and their personality \nis just too steep after that. However, few agents debate their worth out in the field. \nEach level of this Background allows for the character to select an additional \nimplant. It is rare for agents to request new implants once play begins, since surgical \nrecovery times are high, and the Storyteller is well within her rights to ask a \nsubstantial amount of downtime be required for those characters who undergosuch \nsurgery. \nBackers \nAll SFO characters have this Background. It allows the character to gather \nresources to pay bribes, purchase weapons, extract herself from political trouble \nand otherwise grease the wheels of everyday life. Please note that this Background \nis not an instant cure-all, however. It may take quite a bit of time to get a character \nreleased from jail even if the warden is bribed, and while SFO characters are licensed \nto kill, they must still explain themselves to local law enforcement. A tricky job \nthat gets harder and harder the farther they are from home. The amount of this \nBackground indicates how much money is usually on hand for bribes and the \namount of political sway the character can muster. While uncommon among the \nShih, it is not unheard of for some of them to gather this kind of influence if they \nremain in a region long enough, carry over contacts from their old lives, or even \nearn the patronage of grateful citizens with means to aid them. \n1 - \nAllowance of 200 yen per day for bribes, minor political sway (avoid \nparking tickets) \n2 -Allowance of 400 yen per day for bribes, can avoid almost anything less \nthan a felony charge.

Licensed to assist local law enforcement in emer- \ngency situations. \n5 - Allowance of 1000 yen per day for bribes, can call on local law \nenforcement for backup (watch what you tell them, though) or take command of \nlocal law enforcement in emergency situations.

Under such circumstances, intensity can lead to disagreement and \narguments, and neither of these things is conducive to having a good time. Listed \nhere are some important extra guidelines to help keep tempers in check and the \nstory flowing smoothly. Do your part to make everything work. \nDon’t go wild - \nThe idea here is not to get carried away and hurt yourself. \nYou should never pretend to attack anyone physically, and you should never do \nanything remotely dangerous. Describe and mimic any action that could be \nconsidered even slightly dangerou \nBe a teacher - \nAchieving \nry by taking advantage of someone’s lack \nof knowledge is completely without class. Teach the poor sucker every trick and \nnuance beforehand, and then beat him anyway. Now that’s a triumph worth \nbragging about. \nDon‘t use weapons - \nWe’ve said it before, we’ll say it again. Don’t even \ncarry representations of weapons, not even if your character needs them for his \nspecial Hundred Lashing Tails of the Angry Storm Dragon nunchaku technique. \nprotect the Veil - \nDon’t perform illegal-seeming activities in public \nplaces, and make sure you use prop cards for any unusual or dangerous items that \nyour character possesses. \nDon’t overact - \nDon’t act out strong emotions unless everyone present is \naware of what’s going on, and always be ready to simmer down if someone asks to \ntake a breather from a particularly intense scene. It may be wonderful to be \nimmersed in the passion of an exchange with another character, but always \nremember that the real person behind that character has to be comfortable for it \nto be really great. Unnerving them or tiring them out just doesn’t do that. \nStay in character - \nStep out of character only if you have to. Respect \nothers’ needs to step out of character, for whatever reason. Never abuse this \ncourtesy by saying you are out of character just to avoid an encounter. \nExperienced players learn to weave the system of challenges into their \nconversations and be rather sly about it. They can avoid alerting the “mundanes” \nthat anything is happening. Doing so is the linchpin of Mind’s Eye Theatre. Real \npeople try to solve things calmly and collectively, not by kung fu strikes every five \nseconds. Characters should follow their example. \nDon’t debate the rules - \nNobody likes a rules lawyer. Don’t start rules \narguments during the game. Call for a Narrator. If you have a problem with a \nNarrator’s call, wait until after the game to argue your case. In the meantime, don’t \nhold up the rest of the plot. \nFoster intrigue - \nDon’t ever limit yourself to the goals and motivations \nthat a Narrator gives you at the start of a session; take control. Get involved! After \nall, it’s your story. \nCreate your own plots - \nCreate your own story and work other characters \ninto it one by one. Characters are made to act, not to react. \nWatch out for other players - \nKeep an eye out for players who look bored. \nA bored player is the perfect assistant Narrator. Remember that some players who \nget really bored tend to have their characters start killing other characters for no \nother reason than to have something to do. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"

Request their help only when you really \nneed it, and thank them whenever they do come to the rescue. \nRoleplay, roleplay, roleplay - \nNot everything has to come down to a \nchallenge. Avoid “rulesmongering”; roleplay things out instead. A challenge \nshould be a last resort, when players cannot agree on what should happen. It’s much \neasier and more fun to agree and tell a story than it is to play Rock-Paper-Scissors. \nIf you use the rules only as acontingency to fall back on, you emphasize storytelling. \nEnjoy the surprises - \nBe ready for surprises and learn to enjoy them. Don’t \nthrow a fit because the ancestor happened to show up right when you were about \nto make your move. The world your character occupies is full of mysteries; you \nshouldn’t know how everything is going to work out. Treat each situation as a \npuzzle, and attempt to deduce a solution. That’s what your Narrator hopes you will \ndo. \nDon’t bring out-of-game knowledge to your character.

Bringing outside \nknowledge in game is called “ninja sense” or “metagaming,” which are polite names \nfor “cheating.” \nBe patient with changes - \nBe patient when things change in midstream. \nTell the Narrator about your plot ideas before the game starts, so she has time to \nprepare for your plot’s effects.

These powerful creatures command \nimmense realms where they collect and torture the souls they have snared in their \nevil designs. These realms are often twisted beyond imagination, serving only to \ninflict pain on others at the amusement of the reigning demon lord. These realms \nvary in size according to the power of the demon lord and the number of lesser \ndemons in its service, but now smaller demons are finding defiled areas to call their \nown in this modem age of suffering. This trend bodes ill indeed for the Middle \nKingdom, as the spread of Yomi poses a direct threat to the balance of Yin and Yang \nthat keeps the universe in harmony. Eternal enemies of demons, most Kuei-jin \nwork to stop the spread of Yomi, if for no other reason than to exact revenge for \nthe time their souls spent being tortured before reanimating their bodies. \ncnt \nThe direct representation of Yin and Yang in the Middle Kingdom is k \nas Chi, a spiritual force \nconcept to grasp, especi \nbattery” or equate it to \nmovies.

For all but the most exceptional mortals, the amount of Chi \nthey can use is minimal, as is their awareness of it. Many shen - \nespecially \nhengeyokai and hien- are potent cultivators of Chi, and they work to ensure that \ntheir supplies are maintained.

The greedy immortals, who hungered \nso much for the Chi of others, would live no other way, cut off from the universal \nflow of Chi. Not truly dead, but never to be truly alive again either, theirs was a \npunishment to make the pillars of Heaven shake with its terrible weight. Having \nlevied this great indictment against the Wan Xian, the August Personage turned \nhis gaze from the Middle Kingdom, and as he did, the walls between worlds \nthickened and cries to spirits went unheeded. Only spirits of great savagery and \nhate could break through to become Kuei-jin, and thus, those who had been meant \nto guard humanity became its burden. They had become the Wan Kuei - \nthe Ten \nThousand Demons. \nNow, the Fifth Age (the Age of Darkness) encircles the world, and the debt \nto the gods looms large overhead, crushing modem Kuei-jin beneath its burden. \nMost Kuei-jin give in to selfishness and short-sighted pursuits, and only the wisest \nand most dedicated souls have the ability to pursue their true state, be it god or \ndemon.

Those who resist capture too savagely, or who \nare deemed unworthy of the trouble of training, are destroyed on the spot, their \nsouls sent spinning forever into the Yin or Yomi realms. Those who are considered \nworthwhile are immediately assigned to a mentor, or sifu, to begin their training, \noften along with a group of other young Kuei-jin. This mentor is a pivotal figure \nin the life of one of the Hungry Dead, as the lessons she imparts and the methods \nshe uses to teach them will remain with a Kuei-jin long after a hundred mortal \nlifetimes. \nThis training period is known as the re‘. Training takes place for a minimum of \none year, typically five and sometimes even up to 10 years. Many elder Kuei-jin \nruminate on how this study used to take two entire cycles of the zodiac (24 years) \nbefore the arrival of the short attention spans that accompanied the Age of \nDarkness.

Regardless of instruction, however, finding or \nchoosing a Dharma is a crucial time for a hin, because although a Dharma may be \nchanged due to tremendous events in a student’s life, it is never a decision made \nlightly. Changing one’s Dharma is tantamount to saying that one’s actions until \nthen have been misguided at best - \noutright foolish at worst - \nand it results in \nhaving to relearn vampiric existence from the ground up once more. \nFive Dharmas, each associated with afundamental part of Kuei-jin existence, \nare commonly recognized: the Howl of the Devil-Tiger (Po), the Way of the \nResplendent Crane (Hun), the Song of the Shadow (Yin), the Path of a Thousand \nWhispers (Balance) and the Dance of the Thrashing Dragon (Yang). \nr=dL \nOnce a Kuei-jin has received her Dharma, direction and recognition in the \neyes of her fellows, she enters a period of freedom called the bu, \nduring which she \nis allowed to revel in her vampiric state somewhat and come to terms with her \nmortal days.

It’s fine to break stereotypes, of course, but the decision of \nbalance affects how your character looks at unlife in a very primal way, so choose \ncarefully. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nThe choice of direction is also an important choice in a character’s develop- \nment. Direction adds a sense of role to a concept - \ncontinuing with the scholar \nconcept from before, a scholar of the north direction is likely a meticulous and \ndemanding researcher who thrives on objectivity and perfection. A scholar of the \nsouth direction, on the other hand, is more likely to be a subversive writer who \nchallenges established doctrine with her work. A scholar of the east would be more \ninclined to seek out eyewitnesses as opposed to dry book research, while one of the \nwest direction would probably be interested in the spiritual and philosophical \nquestions raised by her work. One of the center would look toward the value that \nshe and others can gain from her field. Again, it’s fine to break stereotypes, but \nremember that most Kuei-jin find that their directions suit them well - \nif not \nalways in the way they expected. \nFinally - \nand most important to playing the game - \nyou must answer the \nquestion of Dharma, the philosophy that guides the character’s actions toward \nredemption on the karmic cycle. While some Kuei-jin have their Dharmas forced \non them by fate or authority, they arise more than likely from the expression of \nfeelings the Kuei-jin instinctively knows to be true as soon as she begins her Road \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nBack. A Dharma is more than just a set of ideas to which one gives lip service. It \nis the very essence of the character and her outlook on her place under Heaven. \nNever choose it lightly. \nNatural capabilities use Attributes for descriptions. Every character has \ncertain innate qualities. Attributes describe these qualities, marking a character’s \nparticular areas of intrinsic talent. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\n, w  \nI \n-0sYYq \nlknvsum \nEach character has areas of modest skill and other areas of excellence. You \ndetermine your character’s natural talents, selecting whether your character is to \nbe physically adroit, mentally agile or socially adept. The character’s concept \nshould guide these choices, so a martial-artist is likely to be physically exceptional \nwhile an investigative reporter probably has more social development. \nPhysical Attributes measure your character’s general health, stamina, \nagility and power. A character with modest Physical Attributes is probably not very \nathletic, while a character with high Physical Attributes is exceptionally strong, \ndexterous or tough. \nSocial Attributes determine the force of a character’s personality and her \nability to interact well with others. If your character has few Social Traits, she may \nbe awkward, shy or just plain-looking. A socially potent character is attractive, \ncompelling or smooth. \nMental Attributes help in problem-solving, learning, deduction and gen- \neral alertness. With limited Mental Attributes, a character is not particularly \nwell-educated, quick-thinking or perceptive. Conversely, a mentally focused \ncharacter is attentive, logical or intuitive. \nChoose the priority of your character’s Attributes. Each character is stronger \nin some areas than in others, at least at first. Obviously, Dharma and concept shape \nthese Attributes to some degree, but only a broad outline is needed in this step. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nW O S ~ Y ~  rw= \nOnce you’ve decided on your character’s inherent strengths, you should \ndescribe exactly the sorts of exceptional characteristics he possesses. In your \nprimary area of Attribute development, choose seven Traits; in your secondary, \nchoose five; in your tertiary area, select three Traits. Traits are adjectives describ- \ning the character, just like the descriptions in a novel or play. Thus, a Mentally \nfocused character might be more Intuitive than Rational, or a strong Physical \ncharacter could be Brawny and Tough but not very Quick or Nimble. \nA complete list of Traits starts on p. 71. Pick Traits that describe your \ncharacter as if you wanted to write down the particular qualities of the individual. \nYou can pick a particular Trait multiple times, if you like, to denote spectacular \ndepth in an area. \ns m r i = t a v W M  \nNo character begins play unformed and without education. The skills and \ntraining picked up in the course of life, and the friends made among various fields \nof work, all gift a character with special resources. Furthermore, vampiric powers, \ncalled Disciplines, come from the Chi energy powering all Cathayans, granting \nthem superhuman capabilities. Collectively, these advantages are learned or \ndeveloped benefits not inherent to one’s raw potential. \nAdvantages are divided into several categories. Abilities represent skills or \ntraining, allowing characters to perform tasks. Backgrounds are connections \namong the mortal and immortal communities, representing such diverse facets as \nfriends, social standing or Cathayan patrons. Disciplines are powers derived from \nChi, arts carefully cultivated during a character’s r6 period. Lastly, Chi Virtues \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nrepresent part of the composition of a character’s soul, how the positive and \nnegative energies balance within him. \nc+t-siYg h i w w  \nSelect five Abilities that represent your character’s education and training. \nWhether learned in mortal days or honed after death, Abilities set apart your \ncharacter by letting her attempt tasks that less skilled compatriots cannot under- \nstand or complete. You can choose an Ability multiple times, if desired, to show \ngreater expertise. A complete list of Abilities starts on p. 80. Note that your \nStoryteller may restrict some Abilities. \n-0SlYg \nDPciPrlYM \nSelect three Basic Disciplines for your vampire character. You must select \nthem in the order listed (that is, you must take the first Basic level before taking \nthe second Basic level in any given Discipline), and you can only take the Basic \nlevels at this time. Remember, at least one of the first Disciplines you take must be \na Basic Demon Art - \nrepresentative of the legacy of darkness already inherent in \nevery Kuei-jin. \nKuei-jin Disciplines are divided into several categories. Shintai Disciplines \nseek to master the immortal form and its relation to the world. Chi Disciplines tap \ninto and alter the universal energies at play all around. Soul Disciplines allow the \nKuei-jin to control his dichotomous natures and dominate the spirits of others. \nDemon Arts express the talents of the character’s dark side. \nA complete description of Disciplines is found in Chapter Four. See the \nprevious table for a quick list of the Disciplines in each category. \n- o s i Y g ~ q r ( o ~ Y D s  \nYou may take five Background Traits for your vampire. Each Background \nrepresents a tie to a particular agency, organization or resource, whether mortal or \nCathayan. You can have up to five Traits in any Background, though your \nStoryteller may prohibit certain Backgrounds based on your concept. Most \nStorytellers will scrutinize heavily any Background above three Traits. \nBackground descriptions start on p. 93. \nYour character begins play with four Traits to divide among her Yin and Yang \nscores (characters begin with one Trait in each Virtue already). Remember that a \ncharacter is considered permanently imbalanced toward a particular virtue if their \ncw v h =  \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\npermanent ratings are three or more Traits apart. (Yin 5 and Yang 2, for example, \nindicates a permanent Yin imbalance.) \nCharacters whose Yang rating is out of balance in relation to their Yin rating \ntend to appear very much alive, and they shake off wave soul easily. They can also \nfall prey to killing rages due to their high emotional levels, and they have trouble \nconcentrating on long-term goals. \nCharacters withy in ratings much higher than their Yang tend to appear much \nmore corpselike and indifferent to the suffering of those around them. Due to their \nemotional detachment, they also have little trouble quenching fire soul when it \narises. \nCharacters whose Yin and Yang ratings are fairly close may exhibit signs of \nboth ends of the spectrum (especially if their temporary Chi levels differ greatly), \nbut almost never to extremes. \nFor more on Chi imbalance and its effects, see pg. 206. \nSTEP Ruy: ~ ~ o u u + E s  \nThe final character Traits come together once concept, direction, balance, \nDharma, Attributes and advantages are chosen. Your last touches include Soul \nVirtues, Chi Traits, Willpower Traits and Dharma Traits. They also offer a time \nto personalize your character further through the selection of Free Traits, Merits, \nFlaws and Negative Traits. \nSoulv!qrurs: mq P9'0 \nBeginning characters receive one Trait in their Hun category and three Traits \nin their P'o category - \na mark of the savage drive required to rend the Wall and \nreturn to the living lands. \nBoth Traits may be improved by spending Free Traits, but beware of raising \none too far in favor of the other. A soul stifled by order is just as impaired as one \nriding high in the grip of the Demon. \nThese starting totals may seem to favor Po-oriented Dharmas such as the \nDevil-Tigers, but there is a difference between controlling the Demon and having \nit control you. As they cultivate the darkness within themselves, Devil-Tigers must \nalways strive to stay one step ahead of the Demon, since their own plansstrengthen \nits hold. \n*rRpirs \nEach vampire has a certain number of Chi Traits, or energy at hand. This \nenergy can be used for avariety of different tasks, from temporarily improving one's \nphysical prowess to healing wounds to powering Disciplines. You may hold up to \n10 Traits of each type of Chi at a time, but be warned that habitually holding more \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nenergies than your character’s body can handle often has extremely irritating (if \nnot outright lethal) side effects. For more on Chi imbalances, see p. 206. \n3/yWOWWii+ \nWhen you exhaust all other avenues, your Willpower measures your innate \ndrive for self-preservation, your sense of mental fortitude and your ability to resist \ntemptation and defeat. You can use Willpower Traits for a variety of tasks, like \nredoubling your efforts in a task or resisting supernatural coercion. \nYou come into play with two Willpower Traits, since it takes a tough soul to \nreturn from the ravages of Yomi. The maximum Willpower available to a character \nis determined by the Dharma. Characters cannot purchase more than four \nWillpower Traits until their Dharma Traits have reached a correspondingly high \nlevel - \na character with six Dharma Traits may have up to six permanent \nWillpower Traits, for example. \nYou may choose to have a card for each Trait of Willpower you possess, and \nyou must turn the card over to a Narrator or Storyteller when you expend \nWillpower. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nDW-mWn \nYou begin play withone trait in your character’s chosen Dharma, representing \nthe first faltering steps your character has taken toward enlightenment and karmic \nfreedom. If joss flows in your favor, you may find yourself acquiring more Dharma \nTraits following certain auspicious occasions. Besides enlightenment, Dharma \noffers certain game benefits as well, from higher Willpower totals to being able to \nabsorb Chi from different sources than simple flesh and blood. \nIf moments of blindness strike and your Dharma Traits ever fall to zero, you \nare reduced to a chih-mi, a mindless flesh-eating monster, and the character must \nbe given over to Storyteller control until either a Dharma Trait is restored or the \nmonster is destroyed. \nY w * r w  \nSome characters have particular weaknesses or shortcomings. Others just \nnever developed in some fashion, or they suffered injuries that set back otherwise \nstrong attributes. Such hindrances are represented with Negative Traits. Though \nNegative Traits are not required, they represent a deficiency or injury in your \ncharacter. \nSince few people actually want to play a character with handicaps and \nproblems, Negative Traits grant bonuses in other areas of character creation. Each \nNegative Trait taken is good for one Free Trait later. You may take up to five \nNegative Traits, though you should not take more than three Negative Traits in \nany one Attribute category. \nUnlike other Attributes, you should only take Negative Traits from the list \nhere. Although there are certainly other adjectives that would describe a character’s \ndrawbacks appropriately, nobody can be expected to guess aTrait that isn’t covered \nin the rules. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nRemember to take Negative Traits that you can roleplay accurately and well. \nThe Storyteller may force you to “buy off Negative Traits that you ignore \nconsistently. \nA complete listing ofNegative Traits, and how they affect play, begins on p. 11 7. \nRepresenting specific deficiencies or drawbacks aside from inherent weak- \nnesses common to many people, Flaws showcase particular problems. As with \nNegative Traits, Flaws grant additional Traits to the user. Each Flaw is rated in \nterms of its value, ranging from one to seven Traits. The higher the value, the more \ndebilitating the Flaw. A character may total up to seven Traits of Flaws, though \nelder characters may have more Flaws. After all, age takes its toll.. .. \nc+toos~y~ \nw\ns\n \nFlaws begin on p. 1 17 . \nBecause no two Cathayans are alike, each character gets an allotment of Free \nTraits to spend on any area of development desired. If you want your character to \nbe socially adept but also intelligent, for instance, you can use Free Traits to \nimprove your Attributes so that you have a high number of Traits in both \ncategories. You could decide to use Free Traits for extra Backgrounds if your \ncharacter has strong mortal connections, or for Disciplines if she has studied her \nvampiric powers especially well. \nEach character gets five Free Traits at this stage. Additional Free Traits come \nfrom Negative Traits, Flaws or derangements taken earlier. One Negative Trait \ngrants a single Free Trait. Flaws have variable values listed individually. \nFfwmv \nOne Free Trait can be spent to take an additional Attribute Trait. \nOne Free Trait allows for an additional Ability Trait. \nAsingleFreeTrait allows you todeclare aspecialization inone Ability Trait. \nOne Free Trait converts to an additional Background Trait, though subject \nOne Free Trait can be used for an extra Po Trait. \nThree Free Traits can be used for an extra Chi Virtue or Hun Trait. \nThree Free Traits allow for an extra Willpower Trait, subject to Dharma \nFour Free Traits can be used to purchase the Basic level of any one \nMerits have a variable Free Trait cost, depending on the individual Merit. \nRemember that each Ability can only have one specialization. \nto normal Storyteller approval. \nlimits. \nDiscipline, in the usual progression, subject to Storyteller approval. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nMerits, the antitheses of Flaws, represent special bonuses and capabilities \nbeyond the norm. Each Merit is rated in terms of its Trait value. To take a Merit, \nyou must expend Free Traits equal to the Merit’s value. You can take no more than \nseven Traits of Merits, though some older vampires may have more. \nMerits start on p. 11 7. \nYour character is more than a summation of Traits and adjectives. At this \nstage, take the concepts that you’ve emphasized and develop a story for your \ncharacter. Look for explanations to why the character learned certain things, failed \nin others and developed as she did. Think about the sort of person that you’re \nplaying and the motives of the individual. \nThese considerations are especially important for players in Laws ofthe East, \nmost of whom are generally unfamiliar with Asian culture. While one is not \nrequired to become a cultural expert in order to play the game, some basic thought \nis required to avoid descending into crude stereotypes and broad character \ngeneralizations. Players are encouraged to look into the regions and cultures their \ncharactets will be drawn from. Not only does this research help them step more \nfully into their roles and understand their character’s point of view, it also helps \nother players get more into character themselves while increasing the overall \nambiance of the game. \nMortal Background - \nThink about the mortal life from which your \ncharacter came. Where and when were you born? How were you raised? What sort \nof education did you have, if any? Did you believe in the occult from an early age \nor dismiss it as mere superstitious fantasy?Did you have any particularlyspectacular \nsuccesses, failures, romances or businesses? If a character’s past is shallow and \nhastily drawn, chances are good that the final character will be too. \nYomi - \nYou died, and when you did, you spent time in Hell. Sit back a \nminute and let this really sink in. Your character has experienced worse tortures \nthan any living mind could possibly comprehend. Even so, simple suffering is not \nenough - \nwhat moment, what purpose finally gave your character the strength to \nescape Hell itself in order to return to his body? What does he remember of his time \nin Yomi? How does his experience there color his outlook on existence? Did it rob \nhim of any joy, or did it simply sharpen his appreciation for life that much more? \nThe Second Breath - \nFleeing Hell is but the beginning. How did your \ncharacter first view life as a vampire? Was it a curse, a blessing or something else \nentirely? When did you first encounter others of your kind? Who was your sifu, and \nhow did she train you? Was she cruel, kindly or simply indifferent? Did your \ncharacter fit into the rigid hierarchy of Kuei-jin society naturally, or does it still \nchafe him? When did you first meet your fellow wu members, and why did you \nchoose to be with them (or did you have a choice)? A character’s introduction to \ncourt and the world of the Kuei-jin should be a time of great ceremony and \nmystique, andnoKuei-jingraduates intosociety without someopiniononthematter. \nTheRoadBack-Like it ornot, allKuei-jinmustadmit tosomegreaterplan \nthan the mundane world. What does your character think of direction and \nastrology in general? How did your character first decide on the Dharma he follows? \nWas it forced on him by his teacher, revealed to him in a dream or simply an \nextension of his existing attitudes? Does he tolerate those of other Dharmas, or are \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nthere some he simply cannot stomach? As Dharma and direction often form the \nbackbone of all the character’s other motivations, it is important to consider how \nhe views each of them in relation to himself. A character who follows his path out \nof a sense of cosmic destiny behaves much differently than one who believes he is \nlaboring under a divine punishment. \nSecrets - \nSecrets are one of the major commodities of Kuei-jin society. Do \nyou have any secret regrets? Hopes? Ambitions? Do you know something that \nyou shouldn’t? \nMotivations - \nDharma is one thing, but also take time to figure out why \nyour character interacts withother Kuei-jin and how hedeals with vampire society \nin general. Do you seek personal gain? Are you hunting someone or running from \npersecution? Perhaps you want to impress your sifu or find a mortal companion. If \nyou have trouble figuring out why your character would show up in the game, ask \na Narrator or Storyteller for a couple of possible motives. \nAppearance -The Road Back is seldom kind to a character’s appearance. \nYimaspected vampires are usually chilling to behold, and even the most lifelike of \nYang-aspected Kuei-jin often exhibit some subtly monstrous traits. On a mundane \nlevel, consider also how your character stands, walks, holds a cigarette or dresses. \nEquipment - \nYour character’s Backgrounds may grant access to certain \npieces of special gear. Whether you have a silk kimono, a katana or a jade necklace, \nyou should talk to your Storyteller to make sure that your character’s gear is \naccounted for. You can have a card for each special item that you carry, represent- \ning the object in question (especially for weapons, armor and other conspicuous \ndevices that you shouldn’t be lugging around in real life). \nQuirks - \nEverybody has distinctive behaviors. These things can be \nanything from constantly pushing hair from your eyes to saying a prayer before \nevery battle. Such a mannerism serves to show off your character’s uniqueness. A \nquirk can even be used to distinguish you when in disguise or using Disciplines to \npossess another body. Or you could copy someone else’s quirks.. .. \nA character’s personality is affected a great deal by his Chi Virtues. A \ncharacter whose Yang rating outstrips his Yin is likely to be edgy and constantly on \nthe go, while a character with a Yin rating surpassing her Yang will typically be far \nmore cool and collected, even callous. A vampire who favors neither extreme \noverly much is said to be Balanced, her living and dead aspects in harmony. \nAlthough the Trait ratings for the Chi Virtues are not assigned until later, a \ncharacter’s Chi balance is chosen early on because of the effect it has on the \nremainder of the character creation process. A character’s Chi balance should \ninfluence every step, from choosing Traits (a character with a high Yin isn’t very \nlikely to have many Energetic or Quick Traits) to Disciplines (a Yang vampire is \nobviously more likely to choose the Yang Pram Discipline). \nYiN \nCalled “ebon worms” (though seldom to their faces), vampires with high Y in \nscores are at home with all things dead and dying, and a quiet moonlit night is like \na balm on their troubled souls. They make no pretense at being the least bit human \n- \nthough many are attractive in a pale, Goth-ish way - \nand they perform many \nof the unpleasant tasks their more squeamish cousins shun, a reason many other \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nKuei-jin find them uncomfortable to be around. Skilled necromancers and natural \nliaisons with the Underworld, it is Yin vampires who frequently work to appease \nangry ancestor spirits and tend to the neglected graveyards of the Middle Kingdom. \nFreed of human standards they held in life, Yin Kueidjin pride themselves on their \nefficiency, pragmatism and their contemplative natures. The fact that other beings \nwould classify thase same traits as merciless, unfeeling and morbid means little to them. \nweakness: Vampires of Yin are vulnerable to the element of wood, which \nrepresents Yang. Wooden stakes paralyze them just the same as Western vampires. \nThe challenges required to do so are identical, as are the effects. Note that metal \nstakes do not affect Yin vampires, only wooden ones. \n.Rum \nThose Kuei-jin whose Chi Virtues are equal, or close to equal, are said to be \naspected to Balance. They are all things their fellow vampires are not: equal parts \ndead and alive, Yin and Yang, light and dark. With such a philosophical standing \nin unlife, it is only natural that some of the finest sages among the Kuei-jin are \nfound among the Balanced, since this state fosters many meditations on the nature \nof vampirism and the place of the Kuei-jin under Heaven. Many fine warriors \nfollow the path of Balance as well, since that philosophy stresses the perfection of \nbeing and mastery over the divided self that the vampire has become. Kuei-jin of \nBalance are perhaps the easiest of their kind to approach, since they are typically \nthe most comfortable with what they have become, and they see their state not as \na curse to endure but a riddle to puzzle out. Yet, paradoxically, by having the best \ngrasp of what it is to be Kuei-jin those of Balance are perhaps the most desirous to \ntranscend that state. \nWeakness: Vampires of Balance cannot be staked. That’s the good news. The \nbad news is that Balance is a delicate condition, and therefore the Kuei-jin is \nconsidered temporarily imbalanced any time that he possesses two or more Traits \nof any one type of Chi than its opposite. When thus imbalanced, any use of Chi \nhas the potential to provoke a bad reaction. \nYAW \nThese “scarlet dragons” embrace all things living with the characteristic \npassion of Yang, and they are the most lifelike of the Kuei-jin, determined to cross \nthe Wall into the living world once more. Their flesh is hued, they eat and drink \nnormally, and they can even consummate a union with a mortal (though whether \nthat mortal lives to tell of it is unlikely). Despite all their new powers and \nsensibilities, however, they are still unable to enjoy the pleasures of life the same \nway they once did, which is a source of endless frustration for them. For this reason, \nvampires of Yang are the Kuei-jin most likely to regard their state as a curse or some \nform of karmic punishment, a sentiment for which they are teased constantly by \ntheir more Yin-aspected cousins. The “hot blood” of Yang also makes them \ndangerous to be around at times, since these Kuei-jin are quick to fly into rages and \ndemonstrate other lapses of self-control. However, when the zeal of Yang is focused \ntoward attaining a specific goal, the scarlet dragons become ferocious figures \nindeed, and their warriors are legendary among the Kuei-jin for their bravery \nand determination. \nWeakness: Yang vampires are vulnerable to metal, the element of Yin. A \nmetal blade or shaft thrust through their heart disrupts their Chi balance and \nparalyzes them just as a wooden stake does for Kin-jin. Bullets, metal-tipped arrows \nand the like do not cause this effect - \nit takes an impaling hit from an all-metal \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nweapon at least a foot in length. Otherwise, the tests required to stake are identical \nto those for staking a Cainse, as are the results. \nOne of the reasons the Kuei-jin know that they are superior to the Western \nrabble is that no vampire of the Middle Kingdom floats around without purpose. \nEvery being has a role under Heaven, and the Kuei-jin take their assigned duties \nvery seriously. One of the primary means of determining the celestial obligation of \na particular Kuei-jin is her direction, the astrological sign which points to the \nduties she is to carry out along the Road Back. Direction is assigned as part of the \ninitiation ceremony into Kuei-jin society and is passed around the cardinal points \nof the compass, with each point corresponding to different predispositions and \nduties. While some directions are traditionally associated with certain Chi \nbalances-north and west toYin, south and east to Yang- the turmoil of the Fifth \nAge has seen even those ancient laws fall by the wayside. \nDirection should not be seen as a straitjacket on roleplaying, but rather a \ngentle suggestion of how a character is expected to act, especially by superstition- \nprone elders. In this manner it is similar to the auspices of the hengeyokai or the \nWestern Garou - \nother characters will view a character's behavior through the \nlens of direction, but that is all. How seriously the vampire regards the duties of her \ndirection is up to her, her wu and the court involved. A vampire of the east need \nnot always work among mortals, nor should one of the west always be plumbing the \nspirit worlds. However, many Kuei-jin find over time that their direction suits \nthem in surprising ways, even if they bridled at the suggestion that their personality \nmight be dictated by the stars. Heaven knows the truth of a Kue \nNorth - \nThese Kuei-jin are the magistrates, arbiters and tradition-keepers \nof vampire society, passing judgment on their fellows and upholding the Fivefold \nWay. Typically, though not always, attuned to Yin, these Kuei-jin are seen as cold \nbut fair and given a wide berth by other vampires. They take a very dim view of \nthose who flout Kuei-jin tradition, and they have even less regard for outsiders who \ninterfere in vampire affairs. Woe to anyone, mortal or shen, who violates a law laid \ndown by one of the north. North's color is black, and its lucky number is six. \nCommon Nannes: Curmudgeon, Director, Fanatic, Judge, Traditionalist \nWest - \nThose vampires of the west are the tie between the worlds, \nmaintaining relations with the dead and exploring the many spirit realms. Even in \nthe bizarre world of the Kuei-jin, these vampires tend to be regarded as eccentric, \nsince their extended contact with spirits typically gives them many curious habits \nand superstitions. In the Middle Kingdom, these Kuei-jin act as the messengers and \nagents of the mandarins, and they carry out their dictates vigorously. They are also \nresponsible for seeing that the will of the spirits is interpreted and enforced, even \nif it means acting as executioner from time to time. Their color is white, and their \nnumber is nine. \nCommon Natures: Autocrat, Conformist, Deviant, Loner, Survivor \nCenter-Vampires at the center of the Great Wheel are the essence of Kuei- \njin society, those who look inward while their fellows attend to the matters of \nMiddle Kingdom. These Kuei-jin explore their own nature, and they help guide \nothers to finding their place under Heaven. Many vampires of the center direction \nhelp in the training of younger Kuei-jin, which makes them are more attuned to \nthe concerns of the young than their contemporaries and offers them a better \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\npicture of the grave state of the Fifth Age than most. Some center vampires shun \nthe company of their kind and quest into the wilderness or the spirit worlds to seek \nenlightenment, but whatever their path other Kuei-jin respect their insight. Their \ncolor is yellow, and their number is five. \nComma Natures: Deviant, Loner, Martyr, Trickster, Visionary \nEast - \nThese Kuei-jin are the “harvesters,” those who walk among mortals, \nseeing to it that all is harmonious. They ensure that an ample food supply exists for \ntheir fellow Kuei-jin, maintain Scarlet Screens, preserve the secrecy of the shen, \npunish those who overstep their bounds (including overzealous Kuei-jin) and \notherwise monitor the mortal population. Vampires of the east direction typically \nfeel very at home with mortals, and they are adept at manipulating them to achieve \nthe results they desire. However, they are also the Kuei-jin most likely to try to \nreturn to their old lives, which invariablyresults in disaster. Their color is blue, and \ntheir number is eight. \nCommon Natures: Architect, Bon Vivant, Caregiver, Conniver, Director \nSouth- Wild and unpredictable, Kuei-jin of the south direction are the force \nthat keeps the Wheel of Ages turning with their ceaseless activity. This duty puts \nthem at odds with more traditional elders, but even the stodgiest mandarin will \nadmit that when it comes to creating breathtakingly original art, winning impos- \nsible battles or deciphering an inscrutable enemy, one need look no further than \na vampire of the south direction. Their duties give them a high casualty rate \ncompared to other Kuei-jin, but those south vampires who survive long enough to \ntemper their actions with wisdom become some of the most formidable minds in \nCathayan society. These Kuei-jin lead vampire society - \nand destroy it. Their \ncolor is red, and their number is seven. \nCommon Natures: Bravo, Gallant, Martyr, Rebel, Visionary \nBe, do not Do, for in Doing there exists fault, but in Being, none. \n- \nZen saying \nWithout question, the single most important factor in the Road Back is a \nKuei-jin’s choice of Dharma, for it is the path that guides his every action from the \nfirst moment of unlife to its ultimate conclusion. A vampire who follows the \nDharma of his destiny may still be cut down by the dictates of joss, but one who fails \nto follow his Dharma will never reach his goal, even if he sees the passing of ten \nthousand years. \nWestern vampires of the “Camarilla” cling to their humanity and regard their \nunlives as a constant struggle to preserve what once was. The Kuei-jin regard this \npractice as pitiable, even laughable, for such vampires are denying all the evidence \nof their very senses - \nthey are no longer human, and never will be again, so why \ntry to preserve a state they can only lose in the end? By the same token, the Kuei- \njin have nothing but disdain for the mindless monsters of the “Sabbat,” who seek \ntoride their “Beast” insteadoftrulyunderstanding it. A Dharma is muchmore than \nfeeling sorry for oneself or reveling in one’s monstrous nature. It teaches its \nadherents which actions are wise and which to avoid, it colors their attitudes and \ndealings with others, and it even offers them a taste of the enlightenment necessary \nto regain the good graces of Heaven. It is not a simple series of rules (though each \nri-vvSr 0\n~\n8\n~\n~\n9\n \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nDharma has basic guidelines followers would do well to heed), but a Way of the \nsoul, a Way of being. This fact puzzles those Kuei-jin who try to pinhole their \nDharma into “to-do” lists and otherwise uphold the letter rather than the spirit of \nits teachings, not realizing that a Dharma has as many gray areas as life itself and \ncannot be confined to mere words on a page. Countless variations have appeared \nthroughout the ages, and disputes can - \nand do - \narise among followers of the \nsame Dharma as to the “correct” way of pursuing enlightenment. Ultimately, each \nKuei-jin is responsible for following his own path, no matter what others might say. \nFortunately, most Kuei-jin recognize the Dharma that is right for them \ninstinctively, and thus, they are better suited to understand the philosophy behind \nits teachings as well as what is said outright. It should be noted that while most \nKuei-jin choose their Dharmas during their re‘ period, sometimes Heaven itself \nexpresses which Dharma a Kuei-jin should follow, resulting in what others might \nconsider some bizarre pairings. (This case is especially common for those Kuei-jin \nwith high ratings in the Horoscope Background.) For example, a former Buddhist \nmonk might return as a Resplendent Crane to continue his old ways, but he might \njust as easily find that he is destined to follow the Howl of the Devil-Tiger in order \nto make up for his past disdain for all things physical and wicked. Such is joss; while \nit is possible for a vampire to change Dharma, it is far from common even in the \nFifth Age. To reject one’s previous Dharma is to say that all a vampire once stood \nfor was wrong, and that is a difficult thing for anyone to admit. \nNote: A character who chooses a different Dharma immediately drops down \nto Dharma 1 in his new path, he may never again follow his old Dharma, and he \nloses his old Dharmic Strength in favor of his new one. However, the old Dharmic \nWeakness remains even as the character acquires the Weakness for his new \nDharma (although the old one may now be bought off as usual). It’s costly to \nchange one’s fundamental philosophy. Kuei-jin who fall from all the Dharmic \npaths in this manner are sent screaming into Yomi, their soul forever adrift. \nEach Dharma description fits this basic format: \nV i e :  The Virtue that this path embraces, and the Trait employed during \nany Dharma Tests. (If a Discipline calls for a Dharma Test, the permanent rating \nof this Trait applies.) \nOverview: A brief description of the path, its origins and its Ways. \nTraining: The trials and teachings that all students of this path experience, \nas well as common skills members possess. \nDharrnic Strengeh: A talent that arises from the studies and training of this \nDharma, and which is unique to members of this Way. This talent does not cost \nanything to acquire, although it may cost something to use. \nDharrnic Weakness The philosophical or material “blind spot” of the Way, \nor a common error its members make in pursuing their goals. Note: Characters do \nnot receive compensation for any Flaws or Negative Traits gained from \ntheir Weakness. \nGmcepts: The type of people drawn to the path - \nor shaped by it. \nTenets: Eight lessons imparted to students of this Way, the “ground rules” of \nthe Dharma. Pursuing these lessons should be a primary goal of adherents. \nMliations: The elements connected to the Way. Most followers style their \ndress, behavior and practices after the elements they revere, and they employ \nsamples of these materials in their meditations and rites. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nAuspicious Omens and Symbols: Important signs to watch for and keep \naround. Many followers of the Way integrate these symbols into their homes and \ntemples. Bodhisattvas manifest such phenomena - \ncold breezes, blooming plants, \netc. -whenever \nthey appear. \nQuote: A comment that sums up the attitude of the Way. \nri HOWLO- \nR D E ~ L = V ~ ~ ~  \nMRl‘UEZP’O \nNot every soul fears the torments of Hell. Some even come to enjoy Yomi, and \nthey bring that suffering with them on the Road Back. Pain is the greatest truth of \nthis wicked Dharma, the scourge that clears the mind, destroys imperfections and \nallows healing to begin. Likewise, Devil-Tigers view true demons as the surgeons \nwho bring such pain to creation, increasing suffering only to improve the eventual \nproduct. Make no mistake, however - \nvampires on this path are often sado- \nmasochists of the highest order, welcoming the same type of anguish they so readily \ninflict on others for the wisdom that comes of it. Yet many of their younger \nmembers have lost sight of the true goal of the Dharma, and they simply bring \nsuffering with no eye toward enlightenment. Such brings great shame to their \nelders, who do their best to “awaken” these headstrong youths with excruciating \nlessons. The Fifth Age is a great playground to them, for never before has pain been \nso accepted - \nso mass-produced - \nand never have so many implements for \ndelivering agony been easily available. At the same time, though, most mortals \nnow believe they are used to pain and suffering, and so revealing the wisdom of true \nagony becomes that much harder. But oh, the fun of opening their eyes! \nThe Searing Wind (another name for this sect) was supposedly created when \nthe Grand Arhat Xue first learned the wisdom to be gained in suffering. Since then, \nDevil-Tigers have embraced this original goal gleefully and committed all manner \nof conceivable atrocities on themselves and others. Devil-Tigers prefer dragon \nnests in locations that sicken and horrify other vampires, and so their sites often \nseethe with evil spirits and unclean practices. The Chi gathered there is often \ntainted with the anguish of countless victims. Lesser beings sometimes take such \nhorrors as signs that these Kuei-jin are devil-worshippers, but few live to repeat \nsuch misconceptions to them, as foolish infernalists who begin talks with such \novertures learn (in the seconds before their flesh is seared away and scattered to the \nnight winds). Devil-Tigers seek to become demons, not serve them, and they have \nnothing but contempt for those who would settle for the lesser goal of serving a \ndemonic master. In this fashion, if none other, the Devil-Tigers are better than \nmany of their fellows in remembering the original purpose of the Wan Xian -to \nprotect humanity from the Yama Kings. Indeed, Heaven surely smiles at the irony \nof this Dharma comprising one of the largest forces actively seeking to thwart the \nambition of the Yama Kings. (Of \ncourse, in battling demons, most Devil-Tigers are \nsimply trying to eliminate potential rivals more than protect humanity, but at least \nthey recognize their purpose.) \nAs the Sixth Age dawns, the Devil-Tigers prepare to take their place at the \nhead of creation, and they enjoy letting other Kuei-jin know it. The Searing Wind \ncan be found in nearly every comer of the Middle Kingdom teaching mortals the \nmantra of pain, but they are just as often found eliminating those who understand \nthe lesson too well, as the surgeon must cauterize disease to keep it from spreading \nunchecked. Devil-Tigers may relish agony, but they much prefer it when they \ncontrol its applications rather than some impudent mortal bully with a weapon. It \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nshould be noted that a Devil-Tiger does not walk around shooting random \npassersby and kicking puppies. While often far from subtle, this Dharma teaches \nthat targets should become more enlightened as a result of their “lesson.” Random \ncruelty and violence generally precludes Dharmic advancement (though many \nDevil-Tigers still indulge on occasion). These Kuei-jin and their philosophy may \nmake Sabbat vampires look like a Sunday school choir, but that doesn’t mean they \nare as blatant in their means. \nTraining: \nDevil-Tigers learn from pain. Each scream is a new insight learned; \neach trial endured anew level of strength. As a sudden lightning flash leaves deeper \ndarkness, so too does a brief agony engender a greater calm. Most Masters abduct \ntheir charges and torture them in a variety of indescribable ways, seeking to force \nthem to accept their new existence and begin learning the mantra of anguish. \nMany Devil-Tigers endured lives of great pain and conflict (and more than a few \nadded to the violence in their own way), but nothing can prepare one for the \ntorments of Yomi and the razor-keen lessons of this Way. Skill and finesse are \ntreasured in this Dharma, while raw carnage and brutishness are disparaged. Even \na monkey can be taught to fire a gun, but it takes an artist to teach with pain. If the \nstudents of the Fifth Age are slower to learn the value of exquisite suffering, that \nthickness just makes their teachers work harder to impart the lesson (at an ever- \ngreater cost to the students’ minds and bodies). \nDharmic Strength: Evil’s Entrancing Eyes \nAttuned as they are to the P’o within, Devil-Tigers have a keenunderstanding \nofwhat drives the Demon within other beings, and they can speak to the evil halves \nof others in an enticing manner. Once they realize that another being has fallen \nunder the influence of the dark side of her nature, the vampire’s player may attempt \nto appeal to the target’s “dark side” by spending a Social Trait and making a Social \nChallenge. If successful, the wicked being will be inclined to view the vampire as \na friend for the remainder of the scene (longer if she is treated well). This state ends \nif the character is attacked or otherwise abused directly, and the target likely \nbecomes extremely enraged at the Kuei-jin. This talent may work only on beings \nwhose dark nature is very close to the surface. Some examples include wraiths with \nactive Shadows, Spectres, Kuei-jin in shadow soul, Kin-jin with low Humanity \nratings, some werewolves and very violent or degenerate humans. Due to their \nancient enmity, this talent never works on demons. \nDhannic Weakness: Sharpening the Soul-Knife \nMost Devil-Tigers are far too impulsive for their own good, and even their \nelders have trouble creating long-term plans if the opportunity for a quick scream \nis readily available. These vampires aspire to be &mons, after all, and humility and \nrestraint are in very short supply. To reflect this Dharmic predisposition, vampires \nof the Devil-Tiger sect must take one of the following Negative Traits, which \ncannot be bought off short of reaching dah: C-, \nImptiem, T&s \nor Vbknt. \nconcepts: Philosopher, demon-fighter, assassin, entertainer, torturer, wan- \ndering stranger, enforcer, prostitute, bureaucrat, fallen monk. \nAffiliations: Fire, the number two, the color red and the south direction. \nAuspicious Omens and Symbols: Tigers, thunderstorms, lightning strikes, \nQuote: “I’m a friend, remember?” \nhuge fires, burning lotuses (often represented by floating flower-candles). \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nThere are those who submit in the inevitability of the Sixth Age, and then \nthere are those who fight back, striving to purge corruption and set the world back \non a path harmonious with the will of Heaven. The Shining Ice Guardians - \nas \nmany Resplendent Cranes dub themselves - \nare just such a force, seeking to bring \norder from chaos and right the terrible imbalances of the world before it is too late. \nBeing a bringer of law is a lonely existence and one that demands absolute \ndiscipline. Adherence to both the Fivefold Way and the Eight Lotus Path (a series \nof laws developed by the Dharma) is a must, lest the vampire succumb to the same \nevils that led to his inauspicious return as one of the Hungry Dead. Like Legalists \nand Confucians, the Resplendent Cranes see evil as flowing from imperfection, \nand therefore, harmony is restored and the Middle Kingdom prospers only if \nenlightened rulers can set examples for the people. Unfortunately, there are few \nsuch enlightened leaders in the Fifth Age, and most of the Kuei-jin are too busy \nbattling over Chi scraps to right the situation. Therefore, it falls to the Shining Ice \nGuardians to remember the original purpose of the Wan Xian, the defenders of \nhumanity, and set the examples their mortal leaders cannot. \nAs noble as their goals sound, most Resplendent Cranes suffer from acrippling \nsense of guilt over their very return to the world. After all, if evil flows from \nimperfection, then they must have been imperfect in life indeed! Resplendent \nCranes are said to be as honest, cold and merciless as the winters they love. With \nthe exception of the Thrashing Dragons, the Shining Ice Guardians are the most \nlikely Dharma to view their very existence as a curse or punishment, since Kuei- \njin violate so many laws of harmony and Heaven simply by existing. Maybe once \nthe Wan Xian were noble and glorious protectors of the Middle Kingdom, the \nResplendent Cranes reason, but they shamed their posts long ago, and even a fool \ncan see that their modem descendants have slid even farther from the favor of \nHeaven. Duty is still duty to the vampires of this Dharma, and they carry out what \nthey perceive as their ordained role to the best of their ability, but they are often \ndriven more by a sense of grim determination than true confidence of purpose. \nBecause of these perceived failings, many Resplendent Cranes also practice \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\n“penance” in whatever way they see fit, and the punishments they assign to the \ntransgressors they find typically reflect their own lack of pity for themselves. \nThe Resplendent Cranes are said to have originated when Xue pondered why \nHeaven had not destroyed those it had evidently found unworthy, bur rather left \nthem to ponder their curse. After a long period of meditation, he wandered until \nhe came upon a frozen pond. There he saw a crane pluck a frog from the ice and \nset it aside. The frog became a butterfly, and in a flash, Xue was enlightened. \nUnfortunately, too many Resplendent Cranes have lost track of the true lesson to \nbe found in the tale of their origin, focusing on their own unworthiness instead. If \nthe Shining Ice Guardians are to have any hope in reversing the coming of the \nSixth Age and restoring an Age of Heaven to the Middle Kingdom, they must \nscourge the corruption that afionts the August Personage of Jade instead of \nconcentrating ceaselessly on their own souls. The corruption in the Middle \nKingdom has spread to the point where not all of creation can be saved - \nmaybe \neven not the Resplendent Cranes themselves - \nbut if that’s what it takes, then so \nshall the will of Heaven be served! \nTraining: Resplendent Cranes must purge their own impurities through \nrigorous exercises of both the body and the mind. Mortification is considered \nimproper, but asceticism is encouraged, and pupils are expected to be both prudent \nand frugal when conducting their temporal affairs. Having shamed their ancestors \n(or believing they have), the Resplendent Cranes practice generosity, benevo- \nlence and other charitable habits in the hopes of righting their past sins. \nThe Eightfold Lotus Path is another crucial part of training - \neach Lotus is \na lesson that the Kuei-jin must recognize and practice if he wishes to attain \nsalvation. The First Lotus recognizes hope, while the Second Lotus demands a \nvirtuous existence. The Third Lotus involves nurturing the good of the world, the \nFourth Lotus demands the purgation of the wicked, and the Fifth Lotus encourages \nthe instruction of others on the proper way of being. The Sixth Lotus requires law \njust as the Seventh Lotus shows mortal law giving way to harmony, and the Eight \nLotus completes the cycle and unites the living world with the spirit. By consid- \nering the Eight Lotus Path in addition to the Fivefold Way, the Resplendent Crane \ncan determine what the virtuous course of action might be at any given time. \nDharmic Strength: Strength of the Oversoul \nResplendent Cranes learn early on that the P’o is their enemy in the eternal \nstruggle for enlightenment, and while they know it cannot be entirely banished if \ntheir Dharma is to be truly realized, that doesn’t mean they have to like it. In \nparticular, Resplendent Cranes learn how to shake off the yoke of the P’o in times \nof dire distress, calling on their devotion to the Hun and its laws to give them a burst \nof resolve. Once per story (not per session), an Ice Guardian may address his Po \naloud, reminding it of its foul nature in the eye of Heaven. The player may then \nspend a Willpower Trait to receive an automatic victory when resisting shadow \nsoul, or to avoid taking one action that the P‘o desires, if the P’o has already taken \ncontrol. The Crane can do so only at a time appropriate to the Kuei-jin’s Nature, \nand the act should be a point of high personal drama if at all possible. At the very \nleast, the speech should be quite commanding and poetic in its descriptions of the \nP’o’s foulness. \nDharrnic Weakness: Unbending Bonds of Law \nIn theory, the Resplendent Cranes are enlightened rulers dispensing Heaven’s \njustice. In practice, however, many are regal monsters who enforce the law when \nand where they see fit. Conversely, some Resplendent Cranes lose sight of the \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nelegant simplicity behind the Eightfold Lotus Path and the Fivefold Wav. writine \n, I  \nvolumes of laws and bylaws describing the “proper” code of behavior in a htic \nattempt to codify enlightenment on parchment. In either event most of them have \nlittle tolerance for any kind of deviation, let alone outright rebellion, and Ice \nGuardians are swift to punish those who dare to question their laws. In particular, \neach Resplendent Crane receives the Flaw: Intolerance for a particular type of crime \nor other activity of which they disapprove, usually one that reminds them of their \nownpast sinsor that they considerresponsible for thecormptionofthe world. They \nare one Trait down to resist fire soul in any situation involving their Intolerance, \nin addition to the regular effects of the Flaw. This Flaw cannot be bought off short \nof reaching dah. \nConcepts: Policeman, priest, soldier, lawyer, teacher, martial-artist, honor- \nable outlaw, technician, paramedic \nMliations: Water, the number one, the color yellow and the north direc- \ntion. \nAuspicious Omens and Symbols: Eight-petaled lotus flowers, cranes, butter- \nflies, cold wind, ice and snow. \nQuote: “Those who wish to become heroes must defeat the Demon within a \nhundred times before they can claim a single victory against an enemy without.” \nr i s O N 9  o - s ~ o u v  \nViqTllE: Y[jy \nOnce, long ago, Xue fell in love with a ghost of the forest and traveled to the \nYin World to be at her side. Unwelcome in the land of the dead, Xue was turned \nto dust, but born again from the tear the ghost shed upon hearing him declare his \neverlasting love for her. The Song of the Shadow Dharma came into being that \nsame hour, born from the knowledge that a fragile bridge exists between the land \nof the dead and the realm of the living, and these Kuei-jin have maintained that \ndelicate link ever since. Ambassadors of the dead, punishers of the disrespectful \nand historians of Cathayan society, the Bone Flowers (so nicknamed for a passage \nin one of their crucial texts, The MidnightJewel) attend to all their duties with an \neerie grace that unnerves most other shen. They see it as only natural that the Kuei- \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\njin-dead \nthings that live still- act as the caretakers of the passage between both \nworlds, and they take great stock in gathering information from both worlds, \nensuring that truth endures. Indeed, they are considered meticulous even by the \nsuperstition-prone spirits they deal with, and no fact passes by them without being \ncarefully examined for its connection to anything else the Bone Flower knows. \nThis sifting weeds out useless data and sometimes yields amazing results from what \nis apparently a collection of trivia, but it also tends to try the patience of more \ndynamic beings, who view the Bone Flowers as cold and distant. \nFor the most part, Bone Flowers lived unfulfilled lives as mortals, often \nneglecting family ties and relationships in their quest for academic or artistic \nexcellence. Many of them committed suicide or suffered from terrible illnesses. \nWhile the Second Breath cures the scars of the latter, it cannot heal the emptiness \nthat many Bone Flowers feel regarding the pleasures of life that they passed by. The \nlonging engendered by such regrets is powerful, and those of this Dharma who \nsuccumb to their desires do so with the urgency of a hundred abandoned dreams. \nSuch moments are as rare as a midnight sunrise, though the powerful Yin bonds of \nthe Bone Flowers tends to make such pleasures of the flesh seem fleeting and \ntemporal; unworthy of exploration. Only the hunger for knowledge seems to \nsurvive, and thus, the reason many of these Kuei-jin are such avid historians. It is \nthe only hunger that they still recognize as worthy offeeding. Even as flesh fails and \ngoods fall apart, truth preserved is truth eternal. Oddly enough, it is this same \ncuriosity that leads Bone Flowers to seek out their fellow shen, making them the \nmost common ambassadors of the Kuei-jin not only to the Jade Kingdom but the \nother supernatural denizens of the Middle Kingdom as well. They even serve as \nguides to those who seek out the paths of the Yin and Yomi Worlds, though such \nguidance does not come cheaply or easily, as negotiating with an elder Bone Flower \nis a long, delicate process at best. \nPerhaps the most critical duty of this Dharma in the turbulent Fifth Age is \npreserving the ancient traditions of honoring the dead, which are rapidly being \nignored out of existence in the hectic rush of modem life. Angry ghosts howl at the \ninjustices that their thoughtless descendants are visiting upon them, and other \nwraiths wail piteously for the living to take even the slightest notice of them, \nreduced to begging for attention instead of receiving their due honorably. In some \ncircles the old ways are even mocked openly, a blasphemy that the Bone Flowers \nwill not tolerate. Offenders are first “persuaded” to amend their ways by the tender \nmercies of the Bone Flowers representing their ancestors. Those mortals who \ncontinue disrespectful or derelict in their duties are introduced to the truth of the \nafterlife firsthand. Other Dharmas are concerned with the material world, con- \nvinced it is the linchpin of existence, but the Bone Flowers know better. The spirit \nworlds are in chaos, and whatever happens in realms beyond has direct repercus- \nsions on the Middle Kingdom. A chain reaction capable of ushering in the Sixth \nAge may finish in the material realm, but it does not have to begin there, and the \nBone Flowers are constantly alert to the threats posed by wicked spirits and other \nmalign creatures. If the other Kuei-jin cannot be made to see the truth of this \ndanger, they are only getting in the way. \nTraining: Many Bone Flowers are taken on long spirit journeys by their sifus, \nespecially through the Y in and Yomi Worlds, where they can witness the existence \nof the spirits firsthand. Also stressed during training are the unraveling of complex, \nsymbolic enigmas and long periods of meditation, since so much of the spirit world \nrelies on the vampire centering her thoughts and interpreting what she sees. All \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nBone Flowers must learn at least the basic rules of etiquette governing interaction \nwith the spirits, a time-consuming and extremely meticulous process that must be \nperformed with tact and precision. Finally (and perhaps most importantly), the \nvampire must immunize herself to the pains of the living world and the spirit realm \nalike, for doing so is the only protection against the immense suffering that arises \nfrom dealing with both realms at once. Some Bone Flowers welcome such \nnumbness and embrace it to an inhuman degree, but others try to fill the emptiness \nwithin them that this training creates by pursuing other passions than simply the \nstudy of death. \nDharmic Strength: Mantle of Tears \nBone Flowers are keenly sensitive to the events of the many spiritual realms \naround them, especially the Dark Kingdom of Jade. As such, Bone Flowers have \nlittle trouble attracting the attention of kuei and other wraiths. With the expen- \nditure of a single Mental Trait, the Bone Flower may cause any spirits of the dead \nin the area to notice her. (Wraith characters should be notified by aNarrator as to \nthe vampire’s exceptional presence.) This talent, while occasionally dangerous if \nmalignant spirits are nearby, is often very useful to the vampire, since it allows \nwraiths to find and interact with her more easily. Furthermore, by dropping her \nvoice to a whisper the Kuei-jin may be clearly heard in the Yin World, although \nshe cannot hear any responses without the benefit of Disciplines or the wraiths \nemploying their own powers. Those wraiths who do attempt to contact the \nvampire while she uses the Mantle of Tears are two Traits up on all related \nchallenges to communicate with her. \nDharmic Weakness: Hell‘s Freezing Talons \nAttuned as they are to Yin, most Bone Flowers appear cold, pale, icy and \ninhuman to those withwhom they interact. While some beings are attracted to this \nalien charm, most are repelled by the palpable aura of death that surrounds the \nvampire. And no matter how romantic their detached unlives may seem to others, \nthe truth is that most Bone Flowers are as impassive to the joys of existence as they \nare to its pains, and few indeed are those beings who care to make close \nacquaintances with these inhuman creatures. (Even Devil-Tigers at least have \nsome wicked charm going for them.) Due to their perceived heartlessness and the \nrigorous lessons that these Kuei-jin undergo, which are designed to desensitize \nthem, Bone Flowers may never have more than three permanent Social Traits \nrelating to warm, friendly relationships (such as Empathetic, Friendly, Genial). In \naddition, due to the touch of the grave these vampires carry with them, most \nhengeyokai instinctively bristle as one of these Kuei-jin passes by. Shapeshifters’ \nplayers receive a free retest on all Gifts and Abilities used to detect the presence \nof a Bone Flower in the area. \nConcepts: Artist, archivist, priest, detective, wandering sage, necrophiliac, \ngraveyard weirdo, ambassador to other shen \nAffiliations: Metal, the color black, the number four and the west direction. \nAuspicious Omens and Symbols: Bones, cool springs of water, autumn leaves, \ntheater masks, chill breezes, withering plants, dead flowers, funerals. \nQuote: “There, there, do not worry so. Your uncle rests peacefully, I assure you, \nand he has forgiven you for the harsh words that you spoke to him the last time you \nsaw him. How do I know? Well, let’s just say I spoke to him not long after you did.” \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nMany Kuei-jin, like their Cainite counterparts, puff themselves up with pride \nin their powers, their immortality, even their so-called “place under Heaven.” \nThey use the ancient legends of the Wan Xian as proof of their superiority over \neverything in the Middle Kingdom and enforce their laws arbitrarily, becoming the \nvery sort of tyrant they were created to defend against so long ago. Not all Kuei- \njin choose this way of arrogance, however. Some vampires seek instead to emulate \nthe hollow reed, which sustains itself on water and yet remains empty, grounded \nin earth and reaching to the sky at the same time. Enlightenment for these Kuei- \njin comes from seeing old truths from a new perspective, from learning to balance \nthe conflicting urges of the vampiric self into one functioning whole. It is said that \nXue compared three insects he saw along his journey - \nthe jumping grasshopper, \nthe flying wasp, and the humble trundling centipede. Unlike its prouder cousins, \nthe centipede moved slowly, but each of its 100 segments moved in harmony with \nthe others, and each segment contained its own legs, shell, even heart. While \nconsidering the centipede’s design, Xue became enlightened. The Path of a \nThousand Whispers seeks to enact the lesson handed down by Xue long ago, its \nfollowers still practicing the lesson of perpetually changing their point of view in \norder to achieve enlightenment. \nEasily the rarest of the Dharmas, the Path of a Thousand Whispers puzzles \nmany shen. While most beings seek to establish their identity and hold fast to it \nabove all else, the Whispers forsake just one life for maintaining three or four \nidentities at once, identities that are often as different as the vampire can make \nthem in order to encourage multiple insights. When a Rootless Tree (so dubbed for \nthe peculiar wandering existence common to this Dharma) feels that she has \nlearned all that she can from a particular identity, she stages a tragic death and \nmoves on to a new life. Needless to say, this adherence to the Dharma means that \na vampire eventually feels the need to leave her court and even her wu in pursuit \nof a new perspective on existence, making other Kuei-jin hesitant to trust those \nWhispers they know. After all, who is to say if they will be around when they are \nneeded? After all, running one life alone is a full-time ordeal, and the time required \nfor maintaining three or four is nothing less than incessant, especially when one \ncan only come out at night! To compensate for the most obvious demands their \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nDhilosoDhvdaces on them, WhisDers make up some of the most talented actors and \nI \nI -  \nshapeshifters among the Kuei-jii, and they can slide through a bewildering array \nof personalities with little trouble. Furthermore, they place special emphasis on \nmaintaining a balance in all things: Hun and P’o, Yin and Yang, fury and calm. This \ncareful tending of their soul keeps Rootless Trees from losing their minds in the \nendless identity shifts they undertake, and it makes them surprisingly stable and \nconfident for those with such a transitory lifestyle. \nOfcourse, it is not only the demands of time and talent that make this Dharma \nthe rarest - \nvampires are not creatures of intrinsic balance by any means, and \nkeeping up such a delicate state requires great self-mastery. Many are the Whispers \nwho are blown off the narrow path, and on top of that, the Rootless Trees tend to \nfall harder than other Kuei-jin when they lose their Dharmic Way. The luckiest \nof these vampires merely stumble about until they have regained their focus, but \nmany more fall into madness or other permanent imbalance as a result. Even when \nundertaken correctly, gathering insights from different lives and personalities \nrequires a great deal of time, more than most young Kuei-jin are willing to spend \nfor such a high-risk philosophy. However, true Whispers understand that vampires \nhave nothing else but time, and are willing to wait as long as it takes to achieve even \nthe smallest moments of enlightenment. In the meantime, they dispense the \nwisdom learned of living multiple lives to any who will listen and hone their skills \nin preparation for donning the next pair of eyes they will wear. \nTraining: Kuei-jin on this path must endure continuous symbolic death and \nrebirth, and followers of this Dharma are buried for a time after the “death” of each \nidentity, during which time they contemplate the lesson to be learned from that \nlifetime. This practice begins during the re‘ period but continues beyond that time, \nbecoming ingrained into the Kuei-jin as she travels, and it often marks the times \nwhen the vampire chooses to leave her wu or court as well. The first introduction \nto the Broken Mask technique comes when the master assigns his pupil her first \nthree identities and an impossible question to answer for each, then sets her free \nto learn what she may. Necessary skills, funds, sutras and other tools are provided \nfor these identities, although all future lives are the vampire’s responsibility. After \nthose three lives have been completed, the pupil is free to pursue her own destiny. \nIdentities of a Whisper do not included taking on new Dharmas, or even the \nsemblance of them. After all, one already has a Dharma to consider and fulfill. \nDharmic Strength: Ten Thousand Whirling Thoughts \nMaintaining so many identities at once is very exacting, but it also lends the \nvampire certain benefits when it comes to resisting mental domination, especially \nagainst those unfamiliar with the ways of these strange Kuei-jin. When another \nsupernatural creature attempts to read or manipulate the thoughts of one of these \nKuei-jin, the defending Whisper may attempt to confuse the probing party by \nmixing in details of other lives in a nonsensical torrent. This tactic translates in \ngame terms as one free retest per different identity the Whisper is currently \nmaintaining. Once one of these retests is used, however, it is not regained until a \nnew story begins. A Whisper must already have been using an identity for at least \na few weeks before it can add to the Ten Thousand Whirling Thoughts. If in doubt, \nconsult a Storyteller about which identities are “involved” enough to be useful. \nThis talent works only against powers which attempt to read thoughts, manipulate \nmemories and otherwise investigate or alter the mind of the Kuei-jin.

Obviously, such \nbehavior does little to endear Whispers to their fellow vampires and shen alike, for \nwho knows if a Whisper won’t suddenly turn on friends in order to maintain her \nown internal harmony? To reflect the suspicion with which they are met by their \nfellow Kuei-jin, all Whispers receive a permanent Unm*stcuorthy Negative Trait, \nand many of them accumulate more such Traits if they stay in one place too long \n(or betray those dear to them one too many times). Narrators should also be alert \nto the mental health of Whispers and make sure the rules regarding insanity and \nderangements are followed carefully.

Bursting as they are with life-force, most Dragons seem too vivid \nto be real to those around them, like the forces of nature to which they pay homage. \nThis Dharma’s origin is said to have been found when Xue was resting during a \nrainstorm, and the despair that so often clouded his thoughts became cast aside in \nthe favor of the soothing embrace of the rain. Sitting there in the middle of the \nstorm, Xue saw the insects crawling around him, the birds taking shelter in the \ntrees, the earth drinking deep of the storm - \nno matter what he did, he could not \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\ndenv the vibrant pulse of life all around him. When the storm passed and birds \nbeg& flying throigh the rainbow that followed, Xue laughed andin that moment \nhe was awakened. The Laughing Rainbows follow this example as literally as \npossible, never shutting out a new life experience or a new perspective they come \nacross no matter what may come of it, and their carnal appetites are legendary \n(perhaps infamous would be a better term for it) among their fellow Kuei-j in. Many \nDragons denied laughter and physical delight during their lifetimes, and only since \ntheir death and rebirth have they begun learning how to enjoy themselves in the \nworld of the flesh. Now they do so with a lust so strong it blasts aside all mortal \nstandards. Of course, sex is not the only means these vampires use to explore the \nlife-force around them - \nany pleasurable activity, no matter how perverse it may \nseem to outsiders, will eventually draw the eyes of the Dragons. \nIndeed, this same appetite is the basis for the primary flaw infecting the \nDharma - \nno matter how much Yang energy a Thrashing Dragon may possess, it \nis still stolen energy, a pale shadow of the life-force that once flowed naturally \nthrough his veins. Most Dragons thirst secretly to be alive again, but no matter how \nmuch life-energy the vampire consumes, his curse cannot be undone - an \nunpleasant truth that makes even the most brazen Dragons falter in their endless \nquest for pleasure. This same reason leads the vampire to explore ever more twisted \nand alien pleasures in the hopes of finding one that will reverse his condition. \nWhile this Dharma is not necessarily evil in and of itself, many of its members \nbecome hedonists to such a degenerate degree that other Kuei-jin do their best to \navoid contact with them and their “temples.” Buddhist Kuei-jin bear a particular \ndisgust for the Laughing Rainbows, and they often bar them from their courts. As \nmight be expected, though, Dragons have little use for societal taboos, and enjoy \nshocking mortals out of their daily routines by cavorting about naked or nearly so, \nindulging their passions openly in the streets and otherwise destroying the \npropriety and decorum of an occasion. Many Laughing Rainbows are also expert \nshapeshifters, since flesh is just one more medium and those who wish to become \nanimals had best learn how to run alongside them. No matter how degenerate the \nDragons become, however, they are careful to honor the kami of their animal and \nelemental companions. Most of these vampires offer a thoughtful thanksgiving \nafter stealing the life-force of a mortal - \nafter all, the Yang would be useless \nwithout a vessel to concentrate it. \nWith so many other problems in the world as the Sixth Age approaches, other \nKuei-jin look on the antics of the Laughing Rainbows and shake their heads in \nsorrow. Why do they waste their time inventing more and more pleasurable \npursuits when so much important work needs to be done? For their part, the \nDragonsrefuse to dignify suchspeculation with an answer-as \nthose Kuei-jinmost \ncomfortable dealing with mortals, they have their finger on the pulse of the world \n(literally!). Cities are their playgrounds and humanity is the clay in their expert \ncraftsmen’s hands. Most other vampires are unaware of just how much sway the \nDragons would have if they chose to exercise it, but for their part, the Laughing \nRainbows have yet to deem such action necessary. Instead, they play the part of the \ncapering fool, dancing with the Scarlet Queen while they figure out new ways to \nbeat the Ebon Dragon into submission at every turn. After all, reality may be \nnothing more than a rainbow - \nillusory and colorful - \nbut those who know each \ncolor inside-out are still best suited to be its masters. It remains to be seen if this \nDharma will understand the lessons learned of ten thousand impassioned nights \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nand take hold of the rainbow at last, or whether they will simply laugh as the colors \nslip away. \nTraining: Business is pleasure for these hedonistic Kuei-j in, and their training \nperiod is a hectic rush of pleasures followed by strict physical training regimens. \nMartial arts and Tantrik yoga practices are common, but other strenuous pursuits \nare encouraged as long as the vampire pushes his body to the limit. Especially \ntalented students may also receive instruction in the arts of shapeshifting or spirit- \ntravel, but attracting the eye of a worldly elder Laughing Rainbow can be difficult \nindeed. The culmination of many Dragons’ training comes with an exhaustive \nnight-long revel designed to test their endurance as well as their expertise in their \nchosen passions, and only the most aggressive and good-humored Dragons pass. \nDharmic Strength: Typhoon of Lotus Petals \nAs dancers with the Scarlet Queen, the Dragons seem to many of their \ncontemporaries to be the embodiment of dynamism itself. They perform actions \nwith a living grace unseen among their fellow undead. Though the voice of the \nQueen calls to them in myriad ways, often pulling them in two directions at once, \neach Dragon learns to trust one inner voice that expresses his connection to the \nYang energy of the cosmos more deeply than any other. Essentially, the Laughing \nRainbow’s player must choose one dynamic activity - \nmartial arts, vigorous \nsports, dance, etc. - \nthat she feels best captures the joy of life that her character \nstrives to maintain. Once per story (not per session), the Dragon’s player can \nrefresh her character’s Yang Chi pool up to the level of her permanent Willpower \nTraits by performing an energetic display of her chosen form and spending a \nWillpower Trait. This performance can never be the same twice, and should be \nbreathtaking to behold - \na successful Performance or other Ability Challenge is \nalso required for a vampire attempting the Typhoon, and it should never be too \neasy. (In other words, a use of the Typhoon should always add something to the \nmood or atmosphere of the game, and not just be used as a quick “recharge.”) \nDharmic Weakness: Honeyed Touch of Sinful Flesh \nEven as this Dharma gains strength from its dynamic lifestyle, it is also far too \neasy for Kuei-jin along this path to lose sight of their goal in favor of the diversions \nfound along the way. Just as each of the Laughing Rainbows has a favorite means \nof expressing his Yang drive, so too does this constant exposure to pleasure \nengender certain unhealthy vices. Each new story (not each session), the Dragon \nis assigned one hedonistic activity-sex, drinking, drugs, etc. -in which he must \nindulge at least once per session. If the Dragon fails to indulge his vice during the \nsession, he gains the temporary Negative Traits: Impatient and Oblivious, indicating \nhis distraction until he takes care of the matter. This hedonistic impulse must \nchange from story to story, as the Laughing Rainbows are experimenting with new \nmeans of pleasure-seeking all the time. Players and Storytellers are encouraged to \nbe creative in designing these vices and to try to weave them from the context of \na character’s personal story line, although the Storyteller’s word is final on what \nvice is assigned. This Flaw does not always have to involve a degenerate pleasure \n(though many are, especially those of elder Dragons), but the behavior is very \ncompulsive and the need for such desires cannot be escaped before attaining dah. \nConcepts: Artist, yoga master, extreme sports enthusiast, doctor, farmer, \nentertainer, prostitute, daredevil, activist, Tantrika, cannibal, martial artist, eco- \nterrorist, hengeyokai ambassador \nAffiliations: Wood, the number three, the color green and the east direction. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nAuspicious Omens and Symbols: Rainbows, thunderstorms, blooming flow- \ners, blood, yoni and lingam symbols. \nQuote: “What does it say of you that my dead flesh has seen far more \nsensations than your living skin will ever know?

Though a charac- \nter is more than a simple set of drives, an Archetype provides a basic springboard \nfrom which the character’s motives and behaviors can develop. An archetypal \nNature shows the underlying elements making up a personality, while archetypal \nDemeanor is the face the character shows to the world around him. \nIn the course of play, a character’s Nature Archetype serves to provide \nconcrete goals and codes of behavior, which means that a player can call for a retest \non a Virtue Test automatically if a frenzy would violate the character’s Nature. \nHowever, if someone discovers your character’s Nature, it can be used against you \nin the same way a Negative Trait might be, forcing you into a challenge. \nExample: Lao Yuen, a Thrashing Dragon with a Bravo Nature and a seething \nhatred of the tongs who caused his death, is leadinga Scarlet Screen offiwe mortals against \nhis killers’tong. Oneofthe thugs brandishesaMolotowcocktailatYuen, whoseplayertests \nfor wave soul and fails.

The player makes a second test and wins. Yuen pauses only for \na moment at the sight of the Molotow before sneeringslightly and launching himself at the \nterrified goon. \nLater, Yuen is wounded and low on Chi, and the jina owerseeing the raid asks him \nto charge into another den of killers in a clean-up action.

The jina scolds him angrily: “You swore on your honor to do away with these \nimpudentfools, and I’m too Commandingfor you to refuse so easily. ” The jina then adds \nmockingly, “Has the mighty Bravo let his prey escape him so easily?” The jina’s player \ncalls for a Social Challenge, and because he guessed Yuen’s Nature correctly, Yuen’s \nplayer must advance two Traits.

You use these Attributes in the game to perform actions and overcome \nobstacles. While certain situations may also require Abilities, such matters are a \nfunction of training. Even with the appropriate training, you must call on your own \nstrengths to finish the tasks set before you. \nWhen you enter a situation with a questionable outcome, you bid a Trait \nappropriate to the challenge. If you are trying to knock someone over, for instance, \nyou might bid the Physical Trait Brawny as you use your strength. The nature of \nthe challenge determines the Trait used - \nPhysical, Social or Mental. \nYou should try to bid a Trait appropriate to the nature of each given challenge. \nThat is, using your strength may call on the Brawny Trait but not the Dexterous \nTrait. If you and your opponent agree, you can use other Traits, but in general, \nchoose Traits fitting the challenge. \nWhen you bid a Trait for a challenge, remember that you risk that particular \nTrait. If you fail the challenge, you may lose the use of the Trait temporarily, as you \nexhaust your resources and lose your confidence. Some situations may require the \nuse of an additional Trait or more. Any time that you are considered “bids down,” \nyou must risk additional Traits. Conversely, if you are listed as “Traits up” or “Traits \ndown,” you modify your current number of Traits when comparing for overbids or \nties. \nFor the purposes of determining what kinds ofTraits are appropriate to specific \nchallenges or Disciplines, the Trait listings include a run-down of what sorts of \nTraits fit into what specialized categories. For example, the Physical Trait Tough \nmay be appropriate for the Discipline of Black Wind because it is a strength-related \nTrait. Of course, you can ignore these categories if you wish, in favor of speeding \nthe game. Remember, unique situations may allow Traits to be used in unusual \nways. \nNew players may find it easier to bid a generic Trait from the appropriate pool \ninstead of picking a specific one. Doing so allows them time to get the hang of the \nsystem.

You have trouble remembering \nGullible: A con man’s dream, you tend to be overly trusting of others and \nand you can wait out both stress and boredom. \nand otherwise accomplishing mental feats with efficiency and finesse. \nnot relax your guard often. \nthan for attack. \non short notice, and you always seem to find room to weasel out of tough spots. \nYHpmMfyTlKrRpI= \nthings, even very important ones. \nbelieve what is said to you, even if it’s not always in your best interest. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nIgnorant: You never seem to know anything, and elders sneer at your inability \nto display any wisdom at all. \nImpatient Restless, edgy and rude to those whostand in your way, you want your \nway and you want it now! Common Trait for those with an overly strong Yang side. \nOblivious: You tend to miss important details, and you often seem very “out \nof it” to those around you. \nPredictable: As the Wheel of Ages turns ever onward, never varying, so do \nyou go night to night without a change in your routine. This failing makes your \nactions easy to guess even for those who barely know you. It is not an excellent Trait \nfor aspiring generals. \nShortsighted: Let the Sixth Age come and burn away the rest of the world. \nIf you’ve got a roof over your head and a source of Chi for the night, you’re happy. \nPlanning of any kind is alien to you. \nSubmissive: You are the proverbial nail that’s been hammered down, and \nnow you don’t even bother to stand up anymore. Retreat, repent and surrender are \nyour watchwords, as long as they keep you from having to stand up for yourself. \nViolent: Fire flares in your soul at the slightest provocation, and you have a \ngreat deal of trouble keeping your temper in check. Considering the destructive \npower of an angry Kuei-jin, this can be very bad indeed. This is a Mental Trait \nbecause it represents mental instability. \nWitless: In times of stress you’re slow to react, and you tend to be ill-informed \non current events both living and undead. \nThe particular bits of knowledge learned over the years, the tricks of the trade \nand the hard-won secrets of crafts are all Abilities. A character’s Ability Traits \nrepresent special training or talent, and as such, they often allow performance of \ntasks that would be otherwise impossible. Even with more mundane situations, \nAbilities allow for a much improved chance of success. \nWhen a character performs a risky or uncertain action, Abilities aid the \noutcome. If you try a task and fail, you can expend one of your appropriate Abilities \ntemporarily, to gain an immediate retest. You lose the Ability used and the initial \nTrait(s) bid for the task (if any) because you lost the initial test, but you can still \novercome the challenge. Abilities used thus are recovered at the next game session. \nA character with multiple levels in a given Ability is certainly more experi- \nenced and proficient than an individual with just one. Most characters will fall into \none to three levels of Ability. Greater amounts are very rare, and anything beyond \nfive levels is almost certainly superhuman (and limited to elder vampires and their \nilk). The total level of Ability in agiven field corresponds roughly to the character’s \nprofessional capabilities: \nCompetent (Able to earn a living) \nprofessional (Licensed, capable of supervision) \nJourneyman (Bachelor’s degree or instructor) \nExpert (Master’s degree or researcher) \nMaster (Doctorate or true innovator) \nSome tasks are simply too difficult, or they require too much skill, to be \nattempted by a character without the requisite Abilities. The Storyteller may \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\noccasionally require the possession or use of an Ability Trait to perform a specific \ntask. In this case, characters without the Ability, or who have already used all of \ntheir levels of the Ability, cannot attempt the task at all. \nWhen an Ability is used against a set scenario or object (such as using Security \nto pick a lock), the feat usually has a difficulty assigned by the Storyteller. In such \na Static Challenge, you may be required to risk a Trait for a trivial task, or even be \nasked to bid two or more Traits for a difficult, risky or frustrating undertaking. \nSome Abilities can be used against an opponent instead of facilitating a \nregular task. In this case, the Ability is expended to gain a retest in a challenge with \nthe opponent. See the rules for challenges and retests on p. 175 for complete details. \n~ C u S t q  \nWlmM \nA few Abilities specifically require a concentrated area of study. One cannot \nstudy all Crafts or Sciences at once. These Abilities are noted specifically in their \ndescriptions. When you take such an Ability, you must choose an area of study, a \nspecific topic that you have concentrated on. Each area is considered a separate \nAbility, so Science: Biology counts completely separately from Science: Metallurgy, \nfor instance. \n~ Y l t f W ~ r c l ~ ~ O W  \nWithin a given area of expertise, some practit \nfurther hone their \nknowledge to a razor’s edge. By choosing a specialization in an Ability, you hone \nyour skills with a particular facet of that talent. \nAbility Specializations are a wholly optional rule. Remember to ask your \nStoryteller before taking a specialization. \nTaking a specialization requires that you spend one Experience Trait or Free \nTrait on an Ability that you already have. Then, you can declare a particular \nspecialization. Whenever you perform a task with that specialization-even if you \ndo not expend the Ability - \nyou gain a one-Trait bonus on resolution of \nchallenges, as long as you have at least one level of the Ability left. You may only \nhave one specialization in any given Ability. You cannot take Firearms: Pistols and \nFirearms: Rifks together, for instance. You also can never gain more than one \nBonus Trait at a time from specializations, even if more than one would be \nappropriate to a given challenge. That is, even if you have Medicine: Physiology and \nScience: Biology Research, you only get a one-Trait bonus on a test of biochemistry, \ndespite your multiple specializations. \nA specialization is a fairly narrow \ntice. You cannot, for \ninstance, take a Melee specialization in “swords,” nor could you have an Occult \nspecialization of “writing.” An appropriate specialization refers to one small class \nof items or to one type of practice within the Ability, such as Melee: Katana or \nYou may take a specialization in an Ability with an area of study. In such a \ncase, you concentrate your research in one particular facet of that sub-Ability, or \nin one application of it. Thus, you could have Crafts: Woodworking with a \nspecialization in Hidden Panels, or Science: Botany with a specialization in Bonsai. \nNote that the Bonus Trait from a specialization does not have an adjective, \nand it is not bid or used like other Traits. You simply are one Trait upon challenges \nwithin the specialization. \nOccult: superstitions. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nAcademics \nKuei-jin see themselves as beings on a divine mission for Heaven itself. \nAccordingly, they place a great deal of importance on education, since ignorance \nonly serves to slow the Road Back. In addition, the tests required to obtain \nmandarin and ancestor status often require a great deal of intellectual vigor. You \npossess a level of education and general knowledge beyond rudimentary schooling. \nWith Academics, you can express artistic criticism, debate the classics, consider \nphilosophy and indulge in studies of culture. This broad Ability covers all sorts of \nhumanities in learning. \nAcademics allows you to recognize historical, art and cultural references. You \ncan use Academics when working in such fields, when developing a critique or \nresearching. Calling on Academics Ability may require a Mental or Social Chal- \nlenge to determine your exact level of competence. \nYou may further direct your studies by choosing a specific field, such as Art \nCriticism, ClassicalSrwlies, HistoryJoumalism, Theology or anything else that could \nbe studied with higher education. \nAlertness \nYou’re never caught unaware. You pay attention to your surroundings, and \neven if you aren’t particularly perceptive, you’ve learned to pick up on subtle cues. \nThe information your senses gather gets processed immediately for danger signs \nand unusual signals. \nWhen you are surprised, you may expend a Trait of Ahmess to negate the \nsurprise. You may then respond normally, although you still do not have enough \nforewarning to use any sort of supernatural speed until the next turn. \nAnimal Ken \nAs beings cut off from the Great Cycle, Kuei-j in are alienated from nature, and \nconsequently most animals tend to become very nervous or hostile in their \npresence. This Ability allows one to understand the actions of animals and \ninfluence their behavior. Taking this skill represents a character having carefully \nre-established the bond between herself and the animals of the world (or perhaps \nshe never lost that talent to begin with, unlike most other vampires). Characters \nwith this Ability can not only live normally alongside animals and predict their \nactions, but they can also calm or enrage them. \nGiven time, you may train an animal to perform simple tasks like fetching, \nguarding and attacking. When a command is given, the animal must make a \nMental Challenge to understand and carry out the order. In order to give a \nsuccessful command, you must bid between one and three Traits, depending on the \ndifficulty of the task. You may also attempt to calm an injured, attacking or \nfrightened animal by defeating it in a Social Challenge. \nAthletics \nWhether due to a background in sports or just personal talent, you are skilled \nin all manner of athletic endeavors. You can throw a ball, sprint, climb, jump and \nswim. This last can be especially useful to vampires, who do not float naturally. \nYour Athletics Ability is used for retests on most forms of raw physical activity: \nacrobatics, swimming, jumping, throwing, climbing and running. You may choose \nto focus on something you do especially well. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nYou know how to fight bare-handed, down-and-dirty style. This skill includes \na general aptitude for punching, kicking, grappling, throttling, throwing, gouging, \nclawing and biting, techniques that come to all creatures instinctively. This skill \ndoes not cover martial arts. Rather, Brawl serves as a catchall term for any form of \nunarmed combat, not necessarily untrained (boxing falls under this skill, after all) \nbut not on the level required of true martial arts. For example, street thugs and \nmindless extras in kunp-fu movies have Brawl, while Shaolin monks and the main \nvillains in kunefu movies have Martial Arts. \nBureaucracy \nBureaucracy, a.k.a. the System, is theoretically an organization for getting \nthings done more efficiently. Bureaucracy can allow you to access to appropriate \nlicenses, use contractual agreements to your advantage, and recover, alter or \ndestroy records. Bureaucracy often requires a Static Mental or Social Challenge, \ndepending on the type of roleplaying performed, or as a Storyteller sees fit. In an \nage where even a minor corporation generates a sea of paperwork every day, the \nability to track particular items in the mess - \nor manipulate the mess itself - \nis \na subtle but extremely potent talent. \nMany places protect their computer records with paranoid degrees of security, \nbut very few are able to keep their paperwork closely under wraps to those who \nknow what they’ve doing. Difficulty depends on such factors as security, accessi- \nbility, nature and cooperativeness of the target or information. \nComputer \nSome Kuei-jin have difficulty adapting to modem innovations. As a result, an \nunderstanding of cutting-edge technology makes for dangerous knowledge. With \nthe Computer Ability, you understand how to use, program and access computers \nof all sorts. \nUse Computer with a Mental Challenge (difficulty determined by the Story- \nteller or Narrator) to break into systems, alter data, write programs or figure out \nunfamiliar operations. \nCrafts \nWhether sculpting beautiful objects from jade or processing machine parts on \nan assembly line, the urge to craft and create runs strong even in an undead heart. \nMany mortals in the Middle Kingdom are skilled in at least one manual trade, if \nnot several, and dependence on these crafts is still fairly high in many countries. \nA character with the Crafts Ability has the know-how to fashion and critique \nobjects within a single field of expertise, which must be chosen at the time the \nAbility is taken. Most tests involving this Ability require either Mental or Physical \nChallenges, with a difficulty depending on such factors as materials at hand, tools \navailable and time taken to complete a project. \nSome fields of Crafts include sword-making, engraving, tanning, carpentry \nand blacksmithing. Of course, this Ability may be taken more than once to reflect \ntraining in multiple fields of craftsmanship. \nNote: While fudging times for Crafts project a bit in the interest of playability \nis recommended, very few craftsmen can work with serious distractions, and some \nprojects - \nlike forging a superior katana - \nshould remain outright impossible to \ncomplete in just a few hours. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nWhen trouble rears its ugly head, you know how to get out of the way. \nUnhesitating reactions let you evade blows and shots, getting out of the way of \ninjury. You can use Dodge against any attack that you’re aware of: diving for cover \nas someone fires a gun or twisting away from a sword, for instance. Dodge may be \nused as a retest when defending against an attack that you can see or otherwise \nsense coming. \nDrive \nThough most people can drive in the modem age, you can drive well. You’re \nequally at home with a stick-shift or an automatic, rush hour is no concern, and you \ncan evade traffic or even use your vehicle as a weapon. Bear in mind though that \nyou can’t exactly drive a semi with the greatest of ease just because you can parallel \npark a station wagon on a slant. A Mental Challenge may be required to allow you \nto figure out where everything is in an unfamiliar vehicle. \nDrive Tests most often involve a Physical Challenge of your reflexes. \nEmpathy \nYou are sensitive to the moods and emotions of people around you. When you \nlisten to someone, you understand her feelings. You can identify with others and \ntell when people are lying or holding back while talking to you. \nWith a Social Challenge and the expenditure of an Empathy Ability, you can \ndetermine if the last thing that someone said was a lie (although Subterfuge can \ndefend against this Ability). Alternately, you can attempt to determine the \nsubject’s current Demeanor. \nEnigmas \nThis Ability concerns solving mysteries and puzzles. In essence, it is a \nmeasurement of your problem-solving skills and how well you combine scattered \ndetails into a coherent solution. Enigmas comes in handy when navigating mazes, \nanswering riddles and the like. It is also a crucial tool along the path of enlighten- \nment in deciphering the riddles and koans of bodhisattvas, or when trying to \ndetermine the path that’s best for your Dharma when you’re faced with a difficult \ndecision. This Ability applies to Mental Challenges designed to see if you can \nfigure out a problem set before you. \nThe Storyteller may require a variable number of Traits to be risked, depend- \ning on the relative difficulty and the character’s familiarity with the enigma in \nquestion. This Ability should not substitute for actual puzzle-solving, but it allows \nplayers to receive some help from the Storyteller when they’re stumped. \nEtiquette \nKnowing the taboos of different cultures is essential in many parts of Asia, \nwhere typical Western manners quickly label one as uncouth and unclean. Among \nthe refined courts of the Kuei-jin, such social grace is demanded, and characters \nwho step on the wrong toes find themselves in a great deal of trouble. Characters \nare assumed to know basic etiquette for their home culture (even if the players do \nnot), but when itcomes to travelingabroadandcreating areal impression, Etiquette \nis often the only way to go. Characters with this skill know the proper way to greet \nsomeone, when to rise and how to make introductions in a variety of different \ncultures. You can keep your cool in any social scenario, from a bodhisattva’s blood \ntea ritual to a back alley tong party. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nThe Etiquette Ability can be used with Social Tests to impress or blend in at \nparties. If you make a social faux pas, you may immediately expend an Etiquette \nAbility tonegate the gaffe-your \ncharacter knew better than tomake the mistake. \nExpression \nWords and feelings flow freely from you. When the muse strikes, you put pen \nto paper and pour out a torrent of emotion and stirring imagery. You can convey \nmessage and meaning in your art, from novels to haiku, and whatever you write is \nboth clear and moving. \nWhen writing or composing, you can sink true Expression into the work. \nWorks created with Expression x 3 or more have the potential to entrance \nespecially sensitive onlookers. \nFinance \nYou can manage money, and you even have some limited resources to draw \non. Major companies employ hordes of accountants to keep track of their books, \nand so do a surprising number of triads, especially those in very lucrative fields of \nbusiness. This Ability allows you to follow money trails, verify accounting and \nunderstand such concepts as investments, shares and bonds. \nThese actions are a function of a Mental Challenge, the difficulty of which \ndepends on any precautions taken by the subject, the amount of money in question \nand the availability of information. Storytellers should set reasonable totals for \nmonies that can be gained through the use of this Ability each session, although \ncombining this Ability with the Finance Influence can make for a wealthy \ncharacter in no time. \nFirearms \nThis Ability covers both how well you can shoot and your skill at maintaining, \nrepairing and possibly making minor alterations to firearms. In the two-fisted, \npulse-pounding, twin hand-cannons blazing world of modern underworld violence \n(not to mention action films), this Ability is essential, although many elders \ndespair over the dependence younger vampires have on their firearms rather than \ntheir wits. \nThe most common use of this Ability is in combat, but a Storyteller can also \nallow you to attempt a Mental Challenge in order to perform other functions (such \nas hunting or repair). Those with the Firearms Ability may choose to use Mental \nTraits instead of Physical Traits during a challenge in which a firearm is involved. \nHobby/Professionamxpert Ability \nIn a certain area of expertise not covered by another Ability, you have \nachieved some level of skill. You may have a small grasp of a trade due to some work \non the side, or perhaps you’ve specifically studied a topic. \nHobby/ Professional/ Expert Ability is a catchall category for highly unusual \nAbilities like Akuma Lure, Yomi Geography, Demolitions and so on. Any Ability of \nthis type must be approved specifically by the Storyteller, and the Storyteller must \ndefine its capabilities. \nIntimidation \nIntimidation represents any of a broad variety of techniques for terrifying \npeople into compliance. These techniques include anything from relying on \nphysical size, to having a particularly frightening grin, to knowing which emo- \ntional buttons to push. It can also aid in staring down opponents without actually \nneeding to harm them. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nYou can use Intimidation when trying to scare someone via a Social Challenge, \nor with certain Disciplines (such as showing off the horrors of one’s Demon Shintai \nform). \nInvestigation \nWhether a hard-boiled cop, an avid fan of detective novels or even someone \nwho’s been on the wrong side of the law often enough, you are familiar with the \nproper methods of conducting an investigation, from going over the scene of the \ncrime to interviewing witnesses and analyzing clues. You are able to get to the real \ncause and determine the most likely suspect of many minor crimes in no time \n(although catching the guilty party is something else entirely). Even masterful \ncriminal works are not beyond your capabilities to puzzle out. \nBy succeeding at a Mental Challenge (no Traits are at risk for either party), \nyou can even tell if a person is carrying a concealed weapon or the like. When \ndealing with plots, you may also request a Static Mental Challenge against a \nStoryteller to see if any clues have been overlooked, piece together existing clues \nor uncover information through formal investigation. Unfortunately, many hunt- \ners also employ this Ability to track down shen. \nLaw \nThis Ability is the measure of how well you understand the legal system in \nwhich you are entangled. In the world of humans, you can use the Law Ability to \nwrite up binding contracts, defend clients and know the rights of yourself and \nothers. In the complicated courts of the Kuei-jin, this Ability represents a \nknowledge of the many interpretations - \nboth classic and popular - \nof the \nFivefold Way, as well as other important concepts of undead law. It just might be \nyour only chance to avoid being branded akuma by an unfriendly court. \nThe difficulty of the Mental Challenges necessary to accomplish these tasks \ndepends on factors like the precedents for and severity of the crime, not to mention \nlegal complexity of the subject or legal action desired. \nLeadership \nLeadership is a function of confidence, bearing and a profound understanding \nof what motivates others. It is more than barking orders. It measures how well you \ncan get others to obey your decisions. It also covers how willingly people accede to \nyour wishes, as reluctant followers are worth far less than willing ones. To use this \nAbility, they must first be under your command or in some way your subordinates, \nlike the relationship between a wu leader and her wu-mates, a triad boss and his \nmen or a CEO and his underlings. \nYou may use this Ability to cause others to perform reasonable tasks for you. \nThese requests may not endanger the subjects or violate the subjects’ Natures or \nDemeanors. Leadership works with a Social Challenge. This Ability should not be \nallowed to override a player character’s free will, but if a character is uncertain \nabout following an order, the outcome of the challenge can assist in roleplaying \ntheir eventual decision. \nLinguistics \nOne fact many Americans have trouble understanding is just how multilin- \ngual the rest of the world is. In Hong Kong alone one can easily find people fluent \nin Cantonese, Mandarin, English, Japanese and French, and that’s just the \nbeginning. This Ability represents your skill at comprehending various spoken or \nwritten languages. Its common use is to represent tutelage in one or more languages \nother than your native tongue. The language(s) learned can be anything from \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nancient hieroglyphics to common national languages to complex dialects. It may \neven be the ancient stylized script of the Kuei-jin, known as kaja. In the caSe of \nlanguages known, they must be specified when the Linguistics Ability is chosen. \nOne level of Linguistics allows a character one language in addition to her native \none, two levels allow two additional languages, a third trait allows four languages, \nfour levels indicate eight languages, and five levels of Linguistics means a character \ncan know up to 16 languages. \nThis skill allows you and \ne who also knows the language to speak \nprivately. Those who wish to c \nin another language (but cannot actually \ndo so) should hold up one hand with the first finger and thumb making an L-shape \nto indicate to other players the characters are not speaking English. Those who \nwish to listen in must also possess the language. Furthermore, you can translate data \nfor yourself or others, though a Static Mental Challenge may be required to do so. \nLinguistics also allows for identifying accents, reading lips, picking up slang and a \ncertain amount of linguistic mimicry. \nFinally, since many Eastern languages have wildly different dialects or \nalphabets, a character may spend one “language” level to become familiar with one \nwhole language family. For example, a character whose native tongue is \nShanghainese could take one level of Linguistics and select “Chinese” for her \nlanguage, thus becoming fluent in Mandarin, Cantonese and all other dialects of \nChinese. The Storyteller has final discretion over what constitutes a language \nfamily. \nNote: Yes, the “language family” rule is somewhat simplistic, but in the \ninterests of game-play some shortcuts must be made. This version of Linguistics can \nalso be considered to supersede the rules for Linguistics given in all previous Mind’s \nEye Theatre games. \nMartial Arts \nPerhaps no other Ability matches the path of Dharma \nlosely as Martial Am \ndoes. Those trained in this Ability learn how to perfect themselves and how to \nharness that perfection to achieve dramatic results in the world around them. \nHowever, such training is extremely demanding, requiring countless hours spent \nin training and testing, making this Ability accordingly expensive to purchase. \nMartial Arts costs two Traits per level to purchase at character creation. Addition- \nally, absolutely no character may start with more than two levels of Martial Arts \nwithout an excellent reason for doing so and the express permission of the \nStoryteller. It costs three Experience Traits to buy a new level of MartiaIArts once \nplay begins, and new levels may be purchased only with Storyteller permission. \nMartial Arts is more than simple fighting practice. It reflects a learned system \nof attacks and defenses that give the student the benefit of trained, effective \nreactions to danger rather than mere instinctual flailing. There are countless \nvarieties ofmartial arts, many ofwhichhave sub-schools andsplinter groups within \nthem. However, for game purposes, a character must declare only whether they \nhave learned a “hard,” “soft” or “weapon” style. While players are encouraged to \nresearch specific styles for fun and authenticity, they need not to be martial arts \nexperts to play their characters correctly. The immortal Kuei-jin have combined \nand invented many forms of martial arts unknown to the mortal world, after all. \nHard styles focus on swift, powerful strikes delivered by any number of \nmethods: fists, feet, knees, forearms, elbows, even the head. Karate, tae kwon do, \nkickboxing and many kung fu forms would be considered hard styles. Soft styles \nfocus on defense, redirection and incapacitating a foe through nerve locks or joint \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nholds. Aikido, judo, jujutsu and tai chi chuan are all examples of soft styles. \nWeapon styles are just that - \ntraining in the use of a melee weapon which goes \nbeyond the basic techniques of the Meke Ability into true mastery of one’s weapon. \nA single, specific type of weapon (katana, bo, nunchaku, etc.) must be declared for \nevery two levels of a weapon style when it is purchased. Only these weapons receive \nthe appropriate training bonuses. Wushu and ninjitsu are just a few of the many \nstyles that contain weapon training. Many Kuei-jin see the hard styles as Yang- \nbased, full of action and activity, and the soft styles as rooted in Yin, outwardly \npassive but inexorably efficient. \nMartial Arts replace Brawl. A character cannot possess both Abilities. A \ncharacter may still purchase the different styles of Martial Arts. Each new style is \ntreated as a different skill, and it must be paid for and advanced accordingly. (Thus, \nit is possible for a character to have three levels of hard-style Martial Arts and two \nlevels of soft-style Martial Arts, two levels of hard style and one level of weapon \nstyle, or some similar arrangement.) With the exception of weapon styles, \nhowever, a character cannot “double up” on a style. He cannot learn two levels of \ntae kwon do and three levels of karate, for example, since both count as “hard” \nstyles for the game purposes. In the case of weapon styles, the character may still \npossess the Meke Ability as a reflection of general armed talent, but he cannot use \nit for any retests with weapons for which he possesses a Martial Arts weapon style. \nA character who has three levels of Meke and one level of Martial Arts with the \nkatana, for example, cannot use his Meke levels to retest any challenges he \nundertakes with his katana. That weapon is now solely the domain of his Martial \nArts Ability. \nBenefits of Martial Arts \nBoth Styles: Characters using their chosen style add their current level of \nMartial Arts to their Physical Traits for the purposes of resolving ties and overbids. \nThis factor reflects the edge that martial-artists have over average brawlers. This \nbonus applies only if the martial-artist is using Martial Arts and attempting a \nchallenge that falls within his style. A hard stylist delivering a kick, for example, \nor a soft stylist attempting to grapple an opponent. It would not apply, however, \nif the former was attempting to dodge an opponent or if the latter was trying to \npunch his foe, and it never applies to a character trying to simply soak damage. If \nin doubt, consult a Narrator as to whether a martial-artist’s bonus applies to a \nparticular test he is undertaking. \nHard Style: Practitioners of a hard style may expend one level of Martial Arts \nto attempt to deliver a lightning fast strike at the end of a normal combat turn, even \nif they lose the regular challenge itself. (Think of it as a blazingly quick strike that \nfollows up another hit, or when a fighter gets hit with a kick only to smash the foe’s \nankle in return.) This attack is conducted like a regular Physical Challenge except \nthat the opponent may not attempt to harm the martial-artist as a result of the \nchallenge, only attempt to soak the attack, unless he too expends a level of Martial \nArts. This follow-up/ counterattack is resolved before a new round begins or any \nextra actions due to supernatural powers are taken, although pre-emptive powers \n(such as Alacrity) may be used to try to prevent this strike. Only one follow-up/ \ncounterattack may be delivered per turn, and it cannot be retested with Abilities \nby the martial-artist (although he may attempt to overbid, if applicable). \nSoft Style: Many soft styles stress trips and throws. However, the real strength \nof such styles is the ability to put submission holds or nerve locks on enemies, thus \ngreatly reducing their ability to fight effectively. This process is more difficult than \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nthe aggressive action of hard styles, but if executed successfully, it allows much \ngreater control over one’s enemy. Accordingly, the benefits of asoft style are harder \nto enact than a hard style, but more potent once secured. First the martial-artist \nmust specifically declare that he is attempting a hold or lock of some kind and win \na Physical Challenge to that effect (which does not inflict damage). If successful, \nhowever, the stylist may spend a level of Martial Arts to fully assert the powerful \nadvantage he now holds. His opponent must first win a Physical Challenge to break \nfree of the hold before she may make any attempt to injure him. Furthermore, he \nmay choose to spend a level of Martial Arts to inflict damage as outlined in the \ndescription of hard styles. This damage does not come from a lightning-fast reprisal, \nbut instead from the martial-artist ripping nerves and twisting limbs. \nWeapon Style: The player may add his current levels of Martial Arts to his \nPhysical Traits for the purposes of resolving ties and overbids for challenges using \nhis chosen weapons (and only those weapons). These Traits ad to any bonus Traits \nthe weapon may have. In addition, opponents may not block the character’s retests \nwith his weapon unless they too expend a level of Martial Arts to do so. The \ncharacter is simply too skilled with his weapon to be so easily thwarted. \nRequirements of Martial Arts \nTraining: \nUnlike the Brawl or Melee Abilities, characters cannot learn Martial \nArts without a tutor. While many courts have a few warriors willing to teach the \nfighting arts, such training is seldom free, and it requires a great deal of time and \ndiscipline in any event. No teacher can teach a student a higher level of Ability \nthan he himself possesses. A sensei with three levels of Martial Arts cannot train a \nstudent to the fourth level ofMartial Arts. Whole stories can be constructed around \nthe search for advanced masters to study from, and the Storyteller is free to forbid \nadvancement in this Ability to any character who cannot meet the proper \nrequirements of time and teacher. \nFurthermore, once a degree of mastery in the martial arts is obtained, it must \nbe maintained with regular training and exercise. As a rule of thumb, at least one \nhalf-hour of practice per level of Martial Arts is required per night if the character \nwishes to retain his fighting edge. Characters who use weapon styles are likewise \nexpected spend the necessary time keeping their weapons in top condition. \nStorytellers should feel free to reduce the levels of Martial Arts available to a \ncharacter temporarily if some sort of regular training schedule is not met. Obvi- \nously, a character should not be docked levels if he just skips one or two nights at \nthe dojo, but a character who misses practice constantly should expect his skills to \ngrow a little “rusty” before long. This fact should be especially clear as characters \nreach the higher levels of Martial Arts, since such mastery requires constant \nattention to keep in top form. \nPresence of Mind: Martial Arts absolutely may not be used while a character \nis in a state of fire or wave soul. Characters in those states have been reduced to \ntotal, primal instinct, and they do not have the patience or presence of mind for \nproper martial arts techniques. (Note: This applies to other character types as well. \nHengeyokai, Western shapeshifters and Cainites in frenzy are likewise banned \nfrom employing Martial Arts.) \nRetests: With the exception of the special style abilities outlined above, \nopponents may still use Brawl, Melee, Dodge or even Firearms normally to block or \nretest any Martial Arts Challenge whenever applicable. Martial-artists are tough \nfoes, but a student with only one level of Martial Arts still has little chance of \nbesting a veteran fighter with five levels of Brawl. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nApplicability: The Storyteller is the final arbiter of when martial arts benefits \nmay aiay. For example, soft styles may not work well against some non-humanoid \ncreatures (where are the pressure points on a rampaging Mukade?), while hard \nstyles often have trouble with the vaporous nature of many spirits. \nMedicine \nThis Ability represents your skill at treating the injuries, diseases and various \nailments of living creatures, as well as how well you understand undead physiology \nand ailments. It also (naturally) includes Eastern medicinal practices such as \nacupuncture or even Taoist alchemy. Narrators can allow a living being under the \ntreatment with someone with the Medicine Ability to recover a single health level \nper night with time and a Mental Challenge. The severity and nature of the \ndamage, the equipment at your disposal and any assistance or distractions nearby \nall influence the difficulty of the challenge. \nOther uses of this Ability include some basic forensic information, diagnosis \nand pharmaceutical knowledge. Of course, knowledge of healing also implies a \nknowledge of what is harmful to the human form as well. \nMeditation \nOften considered absolutely essential to the Dharmic process, especially in its \nadvanced stages, this Ability is the talent to focus and center one’s thoughts, \ncalming the emotions, controlling the mind and relaxing the body. Kuei-jin may \nuse this Ability to channel their thoughts and renew their resolve. To meditate, \none does not necessarily need to be in any special position or have any special \nphilosophy. While many schools exist that teach meditation postures and mantras, \nthis Ability is ultimately very personal, and one for which you must develop your \nown technique. \nAt the Storyteller’s discretion, a player who has prepared herself with a \nsuitable period of meditation - \nat least half an hour of uninterrupted contempla- \ntion, with no combat, conversation or heroics - \nand a successful Meditation \nMental Challenge may put herself two Traits up on all tests to resist fire soul. \nLikewise, the Kuei-jin’s player may put herself two Traits down, if she wishes it to \nbe easier to enter the battle state. \nMelee \nLearning from time spent running with vicious tongs, spending countless \nnights breaking bottles and chairs over the heads of others in seedy bars, or \nundergoing lethally efficient government training - \nwhatever it took, you are \nnow versed in a wide variety of armed combat skills. You can pick up just about \nanything, from a katana to a broken bottle to a billy-club, and use it effectively. The \nMeke Ability comes with knowledge of proper care for your weapons as well. A \ncharacter without this Ability may not use any of the advantages of Abilities in \narmed combat, including retests. Note that highly specialized training in a \nparticular weapon is the territory of the Martial Arts Ability. \nOccult \nThe Middle Kingdom is a treasure trove of occult information derived from \nan explosive mix of cultures, and with the Occult Ability, some of these secrets are \nyours. Occult implies a general knowledge of things such as curses, feng shui, \nfortune-telling and dragon lines as well as information more specific to the \nsupernatural beings that inhabit the world. Examples of applications include \nidentifying the use and nature of visible magics, rites and rituals, understanding \nbasic fundamentals of the occult and having knowledge of cults, tomes and artifacts. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nMost uses of the Occult Ability involve a Mental Challenge. The difficulty of \nthis challenge can be subject to many factors, such as obscurity, amount of existing \ndata and the character’s individual scope of understanding (Kuei-jin know more \nabout their own rites than they do those of the Sabbat, for example.). \nPerformance \nThis Ability actually covers the gamut of artistic expression, including \nsinging, acting, dancing, playing musical instruments and similar skills. It grants \nyou the gift to make your own original creations and/ or express these creations to \nyour peers, in a chosen medium. The genius of your creativity or the power with \nwhich you convey it is determined by a Static Social Challenge. Some particularly \nsensitive types, such as Thrashing Dragons and Toreador Kindred, can even \nbecome entranced by the use of this skill - \nafter first being defeated in a Social \nChallenge. \nIn addition to actual performing ability, this Ability also measures how well \nyou know the society surrounding your particular art form and how you fit in with \nthat crowd. Advanced levels of Performance always involve some form of special- \nization. This Ability can also be used to critique the works of others. \nPolitics \nThe world of influence-trading and favors is extensive enough among mortals. \nIn the courts of Kuei-jin society, where one must struggle to balance outward \nobedience with inner ambition, the game of Politics is pervasive, if a bit more subtle \nthan among the decadent Westerners. Through observation, intrigue and a bit of \nspin-doctoring, you’ve learned how to handle appearances, understand what a \nspeech really means, and know where the deal-making is going on. In short, it’s \nPolitics as usual. \nThe Politics Ability is useful primarily in dealings with mortal society ot \nInfluence. You may be able to manipulate the outcome of local political actions, \nwith the proper Influence and some well-placed Social Challenges. Politics Ability \nensures that matters proceed in the direction that you desire. Politics is also used to \ndiscern hidden motives and broker deals, and as such, it can prove invaluable in \ndetecting a double-cross or power play. The hierarchies of power are also often \nvisible as well: You can discover which of the mandarins holds true authority, for \nexample, and which ate largely figureheads at their posts. Politics can also makes \nyou aware of who’s in favor and who’s out. You can determine roughly how much \nfaith a court entrusts in aparticular vampire, given advance knowledge of the local \ncourt scene and a successful Social Challenge. \nA knowledge of Politics includes, by extension, an understanding of the \nbureaucratic levels of power. You know how to cut through red tape, or how to \nobstruct others with it. By determining who’s important in a given social situation, \nyou can usually avoid wasting time and go straight to the person with the power to \ndo what you want. \nRepair \nYou possess a working understanding of what makes things tick. This Ability \ncovers everything from fixing cheap watches to overhauling expensive luxury cars, \nassuming, of course, that you have the time, tools and parts. You can fix or slightly \nalter most of the trappings of modem society. This Ability also allows you to excel \nat sabotage, should you choose to do so. Using this Ability usually calls for a Static \nMental Challenge, the difficulty of which depends on such factors as the subject \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nof your attention’s complexity, the tools and parts available, the extent of the \ndamage and the time spent on the repairs. \nScience \nThe modem world invokes different mystic formulas to accomplish tasks than \nthose used in previous Ages. Now, most of these spells are not found in tea leaves \nor dusty tomes, but in the precision and dedication of science. You happen to be \ntrained in using and understanding these modem arts of miracle-working: You \nhave a degree of factual and practical expertise in a single field of the hard sciences. \nThis Ability measures not only theoretical knowledge but also how well you can \nput it to practical use. This knowledge allows you to identify properties of your field, \nperform experiments, fabricate items, bring about results and access information \na player could not utilize normally. A Static Mental Challenge is necessary for all \nbut the most trivial uses of this skill. The difficulty of the challenge depends on \nresources (equipment, data and so forth) available, complexity of the task and \ntime. \nA field of study must be chosen when the Science Ability is taken. A few \nexamples include physics, biology and chemistry. Other fields can be allowed at the \nStoryteller’s discretion. \nScrounge \nScrounge allows you to produce items through connections, trading, wits and \ningenuity. While most people think all purchases are a matter of cash or credit, you \nknow otherwise. You have a talent for acquiring items through less conventional \nchannels, and while your means and suppliers may be less than reliable sometimes, \nthere isn’t much you can’t get your hands on with enough time. Materials acquired \nwith Scrounge aren’t always brand new or exactly right, and they often require some \ntime to come by, but this Ability sometimes works where Finance and outright theft \nfail. A Static Mental or Social Challenge is necessary to use Scrounge. Some factors \nthat influence the difficulty of the challenge include rarity and value of the item \nsought, as well as local supply and demand. \nSecurity \nWhichever side of the law you’ve worked on has granted you experience in \nSecurity techniques. You know about police operations and guard work, how they \nmake their schedules and how they undertake their business. (Not to mention how \nto disrupt such operations.) Locks, traps, security systems and alarms are all within \nyour purview. With a little time, you can put together security measures for a \nlocation. You can also defeat such measures. \nUse the Security Ability with Mental Traits to set up a secure area or network, \nor to formulate aplanfor breachingsuchanetwork. At thediscretionof aNarrator, \nyou may be required to use a Physical Trait related to dexterity when attempting \nto bypass a physical lock or alarm. \nStealth \nBy blending into cover, blurring your lines and moving carefully and quietly, \nyou can evade notice or sneak past people. You know how best to take advantage \nof surrounding cover and how to use light and shadow. Opportunities for unnoticed \nmovement are not lost on you, as you understand the uses of timing and diversion. \nWith an appropriate Physical Challenge, you can sometimes sneak past the \nnotice of guards and searchers (who contest your Ability with their Mental Traits \nand Investigation Ability). You also use Stealth to augment certain Disciplines, such \nas the Basic level of the Yin Pram. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nYou are well-versed in dealing with the underside of society, and you are able \nto walk in relative safety through neighborhoods and situations most people would \nrather avoid. This Ability is especially vital if one wishes to avoid a bullet in the \nhead when dealing with tongs and triads, but it is also helpful when dealing with \nmundane criminal activity as well. Some uses of Streetwise, such as rumor- \ngathering, require a Social Challenge, the difficulty of which is influenced by such \nthings as composition of the local community and the current situation (hot with \ncrime or cool with indifference). \nSubterfuge \nSubterfuge is the art of deception and intrigue, and it relies on a social backdrop \nto work. When participating in a social setting or conversation with a subject, you \ncan attempt to draw information out of him through trickery and careful probing. \nInformation, such as one’s name, nationality, Negative Traits, friends and enemies \ncan be revealed by a successful use of Subterfuge. \nThe first requirement of gleaning information in this way involves getting \nyour target to say something dealing with the desired knowledge, such as entering \na conversation about foreign culture when you are really itching to find out where \nhe comes from. If you can draw him out, you may then propose your true question \nand initiate a Social Challenge. If you win, then your target must forfeit the \ninformation (hopefully by roleplaying his faux pas). To use the Ability again, you \nmust once again lure the target into a conversation. Subterfuge can be used to scent \nout acharacter’sNegativeTraits, but may not revealmore than OneNegativeTrait \nper session. Furthermore, it may be used to defend from others with Subterfuge. \nConversely, the Subterfuge Ability may also be used to conceal information or \nlie without detection. \nSurvival \nNot all places in the Middle Kingdom have been swallowed by the hectic \ncrush of the cities. Indeed, the Wilderness beyond the urban lights remains vast and \nfrightening in many places, especially for those unversed in surviving the elements. \nYou have the knowledge and training to find food, water and shelter in a variety \nof wilderness settings. (While Kuei-jin have no need of conventional food and \nwater, a source of Chi is still a must, as is a place to hide from the sun each day.) \nEach successful Static Mental or Physical Challenge allows you to provide the basic \nnecessities for yourself or a single living creature for one day. This Ability can also \nbe used to track down someone in a Wilderness setting. The Storyteller sets the \nnature and difficulty of the challenge. \nach time you take this Ability, such as \ndesert, arctic, plains or forest. While you your training allows you to know the \nessentials of surviving any clime, you’re most likely better acquainted with one or \ntwo familiar ones, which is a factor in determining the difficulty of the Survival \nChallenge. Other important factors include the abundance or scarcity of resources, \ntime of year, equipment and type of wilderness. \nYou should choose a concentrat \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nMelee, in the case ot those learning weapon styles) to Murnal Arts simply \ndivide their existing score in half (round up). The result is their new Martial \nArts rating. In the case of weapons styles, the character may divide his \n4: current Meke rating in half (round up), and distribute the result between \nMartial Arts levels in his chosen weapon style and regular Meke levels. \n. .  \n-t \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nYour character’s Backgrounds help to flesh out ties with mortal agencies, role \nin vampire society and beneficial resources available. Each Background is used \ndifferently. In general, having multiple Traits in a given Background allows for \nbetter or more common use of that benefit. Some Backgrounds affect your \ncharacter’s creation and development directly; others come in o play later during \nthe game. \nk\\ \n4- \nA few friends, either kept from your mortal days or made after the Road Back \nbegan, help you out in your endeavors. You can make a few calls and cut a few deals \nto get assistance in a wide range of activities. Your Storyteller will probably require \nyou to define how you keep your allies and their relations to you. \nEach Allies Trait possessed represents one person that you can call on for aid. \nUnlike Influence, your allies have special talents that make them better than the \naverage person on the street. Though your allies may not be aware of your vampire \nnature, they can be quite useful if directed properly. \nIn general, your allies do not show up in play directly. Instead, you can use \nthem for certain services between play sessions, by notifying your Storyteller: \nAn ally can be directed to follow up on research or activities that you have \nstarted. If you undertook a specific task previously, like tailing someone, research- \ning a project or building a device, your allies can continue the work, doing so with \none Ability Trait’s worth of expertise. As long as they work on the project, your \nAllies Trait for the individual is tied up. \nIf you need a particularly competent ally, you can expend multiple Traits to \ngain access to a mortal with multiple levels of an Ability or Influence. Each Allies \nTrait that you spend after the first gives an extra level of expertise to your allies. \nThey may use this expertise on your behalf, though rarely with your own skill, and \nthey only help as long as you tie up your Allies Background Traits in this manner. \nAn ally can help you to hunt, though obviously, it’s not a good idea to rely \non your allies as Chi sources, or to even tell them exactly what they’re doing when \nthey bring people to you. Each Trait of Allies that you use for hunting lets you make \na Simple Test. A win or tie grants you one additional Chi Trait. Doing so counts \nas a project that lasts for the entire time between game sessions. \nBe wary of calling on your allies too often. An ally may call on you for mutual \naid or refuse to help if pressed into dangerous or illegal activities. \ncow== \nWith the right contacts in all walks of life, you can get a line on all sorts of \nuseful information. Although having an “ear to the wall” doesn’t necessarily \nprovide you with good help or loyal servants, it does mean that you know who to \nask when looking for the movers and shakers behind the scenes. \nIn game terms, your rating in Contacts allows you to discern rumors and \ninformation. When you call on your contacts, you make a few phone calls, check \nwith likely snitches and grease a few palms. In return, you get rumors and \ninformation as if possessed of a certain amount of Influence. Doing so lets you find \nout exactly what’s going on in the city within a particular area. You can get \ninformation of a level equal to however many contacts you use. If you use Contacts \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nx 3 on Industry, for instance, you get information as if digging up dirt with Industry \nx 3 Influence. The advantage of the Contacts Background is that contacts can be \nswitched from place to place each game, getting information in different areas at \nyour demand. \nUsing Contacts for especially dangerous or secret information may require you \nto spend some money or perform a few favors, at the discretion of a Storyteller. On \noccasion, accidents can cause contacts in one area to dry up, such as a strike that \naffects your Industry contacts, or a particularly unlucky astronomical conjunction \nsends your Occult contacts running for the hills. Your contacts will not generally \nfunction as aides or lackeys. That behavior is the purview of the Allies and \nRetainers Backgrounds. \nExample: Uncle Chu, a Westernized Bone Flower heimin, knows someone just \nabout everywhere in Hong Kong (i.e., he has Contacts x 5). This month, his player, \nPhong, decides that Chu is going to engage in a little local rum-mongering. Phong \nallocates Contacts x4 to Media, leanzingabout localnews stories that haven’t quite made \nthe papers and who has their hands in the those pies still on the shelf. He leaves one level \nof Contacts in reserve, for unlife’s unexpected crises. Next month, he plans to we his \ncontacts to find a few High Society types who would be happy to pay for a little dirt on \ntheir rivals. . . . \nFm \nSome Kuei-jin were famous during their breathing days, ripped from the ranks \nof the wealthy or talented elite by their death. As a result, many Cathayans can \nmake a claim to some distinction in their mortal years. Though such notoriety \noften fades with the years, your Fame lingers on to influence mortal society. \nFame allows you to exercise your connections over a longer distance than \nusual. Certainly, if you’ve got the right Influence, you can push things around on \na provincial or even national scale, but with Fame, you can just make a few calls \nand get your Contacts, Influence or Resources exerted over a greater range without \nany impediment. Not that you must have Fame to get anything done, only that it \nmay help. Your total Fame determines your maximum range for unimpeded use of \nyour Contacts, Influence and Resources. \nWhen you make an effort to exert your Contacts, Influence or Resources over \na long range, you lean on your popularity and image, thus expending your Fame \nTraits until the next game session. Fame is most often used in the downtime \nbetween sessions to facilitate long-range plans. \nIn a less mechanical fashion, your Fame also dictates how recognizable you are \nto mortals, for one reason or another. The Storyteller will certainly make the \neffects of your Fame apparent, and mortals may take notice of you at bothersome \ntimes. Having your likeness known to all the local police or being spotted at the \nprime minister’s estate does things to one’s reputation, after all. \nFame does have its limitations. It makes little sense for you to have this \nBackground if you’re known to be dead in the mortal world, unless you somehow \nacquired your Fame after the Second Breath (and have managed to keep your \nvampiric nature secret). Also, Fame does not always indicate widespread instant \nname recognition. You may be known to only a subset of a particular group or a \nrecognized expert in a field who’s unknown to those outside. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nWhether surrounding yourself with mortal cultists (as do many Kuei-jin), or \njust making sure that you have regular access to fresh Chi reserves, your herd gives \nyou a guaranteed volume of Chi for sustenance. You don’t have to go very far to \nhunt. When available to you, your herd offers you a safe and easy way to sustain your \npowers. \nYou should work with your Storyteller to describe the exact nature of your \nherd, since these Traits can be lost through hazards or deliberate sabotage. You \ncould have mortals who have come to enjoy elaborate blood tea ceremonies, access \nto medical blood supplies outside of the normal channels or a religious cult that \ngives you blood freely. Each Trait of Herd can be used to gain one extra Chi Trait \nonce per session. You can partake of your herd immediately on entering the game \nto represent that you have fed previously, thus improving your blood from your \nstarting Traits for the evening. You can also take 15 minutes out of play to call on \na herd and gain a Chi Trait. You can split up Herd Traits if you wish, so you may \nuse some Traits to start with extra blood, then use more later to replace spent \nreserves. \nMembers of your herd (assuming it is composed of people and not plastic bags) \nare not necessarily particularly competent or loyal - \nthey simply let you feed from \nthem, for whatever reason. You must take Allies or Reminers if you want them to \ndo other tasks for you. Note also that the type of Chi gained can vary widely \ndepending on the herd itself - \nfresh, Yang-laced blood of ecstatic cultists is quite \ndifferent from Yin-laden medical supplies - \nand the Storyteller is free to change \nthe type of Chi received depending on the circumstances of your feeding. \nYou were born under especially auspicious - \nor baleful - \nstars. Many \nvampires treat such omens very seriously, and new Kuei-jin are often subjected to \na thorough astrological analysis before they are presented to the court formally. \nOne’s horoscope is often equated with one’s destiny, and those with high ratings \nin this Background often find themselves the beneficiaries (or victims) of strange \ncoincidences, dew ex machina events and other oddities, which provide ideal \nmaterial for a clever Storyteller. \nIn game terms, a character who wishes to invoke his Huroscojx rating must \ncomer the Storyteller, expend a level of Horoscope and perform a test. In this test, \nboth parties display a number of fingers from zero (show a fist) to five, adding the \ntwo numbers together to get a result between zero to 10. If the result is one of the \nvampire’s “lucky numbers,” she receives some boon from fate. The Storyteller has \nthe final say on what occurs, but it should be beneficial for the vampire, and it can \nbe quite dramatic. (This is Heaven talking, after all.) Some examples of Horoscope \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nbenefits include: a Fair Escape, a surprise, an automatic success on one challenge \nor a few temporary levels of Influence. Storytellers are encouraged to go beyond \nsimple numbers and game mechanics when invoking Horoscope, however. A \nvampire’s lucky numbers are determined by his direction and his Dharma as \nfollows: North 6, West 9, Center 5, East 8, South 7; Devil-Tiger 2, Bone Flower 4, \nResplendent Crane 1, Thousand Whispers 0, Thrashing Dragon 3. If a “10” is the \nresult, shoot again at no cost to the vampire. \nExample dPlay Kun A h ,  cornered by a vicious tong, spends a lewel of Horoscope \nand caUs on joss to help him.

As humans raise their cities, they form \ngatherings of expertise that are manipulated by the Cathayans hiding in their \nmidst. If you have Influence, you can sway the direction of some areas of mortal \nsociety, pushing cities to grow as you direct. Your Influence can be used to strike \nindirectly at your foes while protecting your own assets, or to gain information and \nspecial resources. Kuei-jin may have some relaxed restrictions on dealing with \nmortals compared to the Westerners and their Masquerade, but raw supernatural \nmight will only carry one so far. After a certain point, knowing where to turn to \nget things done is far more important than shaking down clerks and otherwise \nthrowing one’s weight around. \nInfluence comes in many different areas. You must allocate Traits separately \nto each Influence; thus, if you have Legal x 4, you could still have Police x 3 \nindependently but you would have to spend the Traits for each. \nYou cannot manage more Influence than the sum of your permanent Physical, \nSocial and Mental Traits combined. This limit counts against all of your total \nInfluence - \nyour combined levels cannot exceed this total. After all, there are \nonly so many things you can do in a night. \nWhen you exercise Influence, you expend temporary Influence Traits. The \ntables for various Influence areas detail what you can do with a specific number of \nTraits. Performing an action requires a number of Traits equal to the level of the \naction. (You must use three Traits to perform an action listed at the third level of \nan Influence chart, for instance.) Thus, with high levels of Influence, you can \nperform many small actions, or a few significant ones. \nCertain levels of Influence gift you with items, money or aides. Unlike the \nResources Background, money and equipment garnered with Influence does not \ncome automatically each month. If you want a steady income from Influence, you \nmust direct your Influence in that direction continually, and this income does not \ncome with any associated trappings of wealth (you’d have to buy a house and car \nseparately, for instance).

For instance, \nHong Kong has a great deal of Finance Influence, because it is one of the \ncommercial centers in Asia, while Shanghai would have a lot of Transportation and \nIndustry Influence. A rural city, on the other hand, might have very little Influence \nto go around. You can only squeeze so much from a community of farmers and \ntradesmen, after all. \nStorytellers should map out the total amount of each type of Influence to be \nhad in the city. Once all of the Influence of a given type is used up, the only ways \nto get more are to grow that area of society (making new projects or sponsoring \ninvestment), to destroy someone else’s Influence in order to free up those resources \nor to acquire an adversary’s Influence in an area.

Such pieces are very rare, and you may have to fend off jealous rivals, especially \nif it is very powerful. Charging the talisman is accomplished by traveling to an area \nwhere the Wall is thin (rated 6 or lower) and making a number of Simple Tests of \nthe talisman’s rating against the Wall’s rating, one Simple Test for each level of the \ntalisman. For each Simple Test you win, the talisman gains one point of Chi. You \nmay attempt to do so only once per night. \nTo use the stored Chi, you need only touch the talisman and concentrate \n(putting you two Traits down if you are attempting actions such as combat at the \nsame time). When you do so, the desired amount of Chi enters your body to be used \nnormally, to power Disciplines, heal wounds or engage in other activities. Note: \nThis talisman does not allow you to use more Chi per turn than your Dharma rating \nallows. \nThe myths and legends of the Middle Kingdom are full of items that possessed \nmystical power and legendary histories, and many courts pass such artifacts down \nto their younger members as a tangible means of handing down tradition, provided \nthe young ones seem worthy.

You may attempt to persuade the Storyteller with an \nexcellent story as to why your character would have a particular item, but in the \nend, her decision is final. \nAn older or more experienced Cathayan looks after you and comes to your aid \noccasionally. Whatever the case, you can get assistance from your mentor, though \nhis favor may be fickle. \nWhen you call on your mentor, you risk a certain number of Traits to achieve \nagiven effect. A lowly one-Trait mentor probably knows only little more than you, \nwhile a five-Trait mentor may well have luminous standing within your court and \na wide range of potent powers. Regardless, taking up your mentor’s valuable time \nis costly. You must engage in a Simple Test when you call on your mentor. If you \nsucceed, your mentor deigns to aid you. If you tie, your mentor grants you \nassistance, but then requires something in return. If you fail, your mentor demands \nthe favor first before helping. In any case, your mentor can be called on only once \nin any given game session, and only if you have an appropriate way to contact him \nor her. In tradition-bound Kuei-jin society, abusing one’s mentor without a trace \nof gratitude is a fast way to lose that mentor. \nThe level of aid that your mentor can give depends on the number of Traits \nin this Background (and Storyteller approval, of course): \nFor one Trait, your mentor is privy to a single piece of specialized \ninformation at a level above your own. If you have Kuei-jin Lore x 2, for instance, \nyour mentor can be called on to gift you with one piece of information from Kuei- \njin Lore x 3. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nFor two Traits, you can borrow one level of Contacts, Influence, Resources \nor Status from your mentor for the duration of the game. If your mentor is very \npowerful (four or five Traits), you can borrow two levels. \nTwo Traits allow your mentor to instruct you in a Basic Discipline that you \ndo not know. \nFor three Traits, your mentor can instruct you in an Intermediate Discipline \nthat you do not know. \nYour mentor can also train you in the ways of a special Hobby/ Professional/ \nExpert Ability that is outside your normal ken (such as Hsien Lore) at a cost of three \nTraits. \nFor four Traits, your mentor can train you in an Advanced Discipline \nbeyond your grasp. \nFor five Traits, your mentor can train you in the phenomenal powers of the \nelders, if you are up to the challenge. \nSince mentors can prove unbalancing by providing too many different powers \nover the course of a long game, the Storyteller may lower your total Mentor Traits \nas you call on his knowledge. This decrease represents the fact that as your \ncharacter learns the mentor’s secrets, the mentor has less left to teach. \nNus* \nYou (or your wu) has a nushi spirit that watches over you.

Unlike the Allies Background, your retainers are nearly \nalways around, overseeing your personal effects, defending your property and \nfurthering your goals. They may not have the specialized knowledge of allies, but \nthey are mostly loyal to your cause, and they serve your needs first. \nYou should work with your Storyteller to determine how you managed to \nsecure a loyal retainer. Your retainer’s exact capabilities are up to the Storyteller. \nA retainer may be skillful but unmotivated, or loyal but inept. No retainer is ever \nperfect, but they all can be a great help. \nA retainer can be assigned to watch over a particular location. Generally, \nif someone attempts to break into your house, the retainers there will attempt to \nstop the intruder. In this case, they are treated as normal humans, run by Narrators. \nA retainer can be used to manage your assets and perform tasks. Retainers \ntied up in this fashion allow you to manage more Influence than normal; they add \nto the number of Attribute Traits that you possess for purposes of counting your \ntotal Influences. Each retainer directed in this fashion adds one to your maximum \nInfluence Traits. If retainers are later lost, killed or reassigned, the excess Influence \nTraits are lost, starting with the highest levels of Influence held. \nAretainer can perform other menial functions, as allowed by the Storyteller. \nYou can get someone else to pick up your character’s dry-cleaning. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nThe Kuei+jin have many mysteries, rites and celebrations, and thanks to this \nBackground, you know some of them intimately. You are versed in the traditions \nand order of these rites, and you can identify them by drawing on your knowledge \nof them (the player must win or tie a Static Mental Challenge to do so). \nFurthermore, you may have been taught how to perform a few of these rites. \nOne Trait: \nHas knowledge of Basic Rites and can perform one Basic Rite. \nTwo Traits \nHas knowledge of Basic Rites and can perform two Basic Rites. \nThree Traits \nHas knowledge of Basic and Intermediate Rites, and can \nperform three Basic Rites. \nFour Traits: \nHas knowledge of Basic and Intermediate Rites, and can \nperform four Basic Rites \nFive Traits: \nHas knowledge of Basic, Intermediate and Advanced Rites, \nand can perform five Basic Rites and one Intermediate Rite. \nIndividual rites may be learned by any Kuei-jin who can find a \nwilling teacher and is willing to pay the appropriate experience \ncost. Teachers often ask would-be students for hefty favors or \nrequire difficult quests before passing on their guarded \nknowledge. But in these troubled days, the truly wise realize the \nimportance of making sure the ancient rites are remembered \nand passed on. \nNote: What this Background purchases is the ability to learn and perform rites \neventually - \nnot immediately. Rites is a measure of a Kuei-jin’s potential at the \nbeginning of the game, not her current skill, although at her discretion the \nStoryteller may allow her to have learned one or two very basic rites already, \nespecially if doing so would facilitate playing the game. \nYin records the character’s facility for absorbing and controlling dark, nega- \ntive energies. Yin aids in resisting fire soul, using Yin-aspected Disciplines and \nwhen dealing with ghosts and other Yin-spirits. Vampires with high Yin ratings \ncommonly master Disciplines relating to death and decay. Because they are \nrepositories for such dark energies, they often seem eerie and repellent to mortals, \nalthough some humans with high Yin scores themselves find the Kuei-jin oddly \nattractive. Vampires who have imbalanced themselves with Yin tend to be even \nmore extreme, often appearing corpselike or even putrescent. Such undead are \nknown as ch’ing shih. \nKuei-jin have two Yin ratings. The permanent Yin rating measures the \ncharacter’s total control over negative energies, while the temporary Yin rating \nmeasures how many Chi Traits of Yin energy the character has currently for \npowering Yin Disciplines and the like. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nFire Soul - \nWhenever fire soul threatens to overcome the vampire, she \nresists using her permanent Yin rating. Characters with highYin ratings are simply \ntoo calm and collected to fall victim to such petty concerns as rage. \nAwakening - \nThe Kuei-jin may spend a Trait of Yin to awaken at \nsundown. Once spent, the Kuei-jin is considered “black cycled,” and she need not \nspend Chi to awaken for another 10 days! However, the dark energies animating \nher give her a more corpselike pallor than normal. She is considered one Trait \ndown on all Social Challenges with mortals except those involving intimidation, \nand she must describe her pallid visage to those who would notice the change (such \nas close associates or those who normally see her charged by Yang energy, for \nexample). She must still spend Chi for Disciplines and other things. \nGhostsight - \nBy spending an appropriate Chi Trait, the Kuei-jin can \nattune himself to his inner Yin, allowing him to view the effects of Yin all around \nhim. Doing so has the following game effects: \nFirst, the character extends his sight beyond the Wall into theYin World, thus \nallowing him to see Yin-spirits such as wraiths and Spectres. To do so, the \nCathayan’s player must concentrate for one minute and win or tie a Simple Test \n(retested with the Occult Ability). This vision lasts for one hour or until the end \nof the scene, whichever is longer. \nSecond, the character may scan objects or living prey (undead and Risen \ncount, ghosts don’t) for weaknesses. The player must spend at least three turns \nwatching his target (no combat or fast movement), then make a Static Yin \nChallenge against eight Traits. If successful, the next attack the Kuei-jin makes \n(hit or miss) inflicts an extra level of the appropriate type of damage if it lands. \nOnce that attack is made, the Kuei-jin must reattune himself to the target to \nreceive the bonus again. \nThird, the vampire can study the mystic marks on a target’s aura for signs of \nweakness and decay, thus allowing him to deduce any physical ailments plaguing \nher. Doing so requires a Static Mental Challenge against a difficulty of the target’s \nMental Traits, but if successful, it tells the Kuei-jin if the target is injured, any \ndiseases she is suffering from or how much blood she’s lost. Note that unless the \nKuei-jin has at least two levels of the Medicine Ability, he will understand complex \nailments only in simple terms: a target is “weak,” “feverish” or “wasting away.” \nFinally, the vampire may use Ghostsight to look at broken objects and deduce \nhow they once went together by tracing the lines of decay. Doing so requires a win \nor tie on a Simple Test with the Crafts or Repair Ability to function, and it gives \nthe vampire a good idea of how to repair the object (if possible). \nYang is the energy of dynamism, of change and of renewal. Despite the \npositive connotations given to it by many Westerners, it is something of a perverse \nforce. Yang gives the Kuei-jin the energy to draw their Second Breath, but it also \nfuels the ravenous hunger that sends many Kuei-j in spiraling into depravity. As the \nCathayans say, Yang is simply the energy that powers a Kuei-jin’s actions; whether \nthose actions are “good” or “bad” is up to the Kuei-jin himself to determine. Yang \nenergy is important when resisting fear and connecting with other living things. \nKuei-jin with high Yang ratings are often very human in appearance, the kind of \nundead who arose to avenge families or hold fast to a love they cannot bear to leave. \nHowever, they are sometimes all too human in action. The life-force they have is \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nsecondhand at best, nothing more than stolen life, and when their pretense of \nhumanity fails, it often leads Yang-aspected vampires to great fits of rage \nand destruction. \nUsing Yang \nWave Soul-Those with high Yang ratings are simply too brave - \ntoo full \nof the fire of creation - \nto bow to such ignoble motives as terror. The permanent \nYang rating is used to resist wave soul. \nHealing - \nDead as they are, Kuei-jin may use either type of Chi to heal \nthemselves. (See the healing section on p. 180 for details.) However, the Kuei-jin \nmay also heal others by preparing an elixir with her own Yang Chi. Each Trait \ninvested in the mixture heals one level of lethal damage or two levels of \nbashing damage. \nAwakening- \nSpending a Yang Trait for this purpose causes the character \nto enter a “scarlet cycle.” She appears more human than normal for the duration \nof the night, and she endures no penalty to Social Tests. While not entirely lifelike, \nthe vampire displays enough mortal traits (blinking, coughing, cold but passable \nskin) so that only those who are trained to search out the undead will usually ever \nsuspect anything is amiss. Of course, the vampire must spend a Chi Trait every \nnight to remain in scarlet cycle, which makes such benefits quite costly in the \nlong run. \nLifesight - \nBy spending an appropriate Chi Trait, the Kuei-jin can attune \nherself to her inner Yang, allowing her to view the endless tapestry of Yang all \naround her. Doing so has the following game effects: \nFirst, the character extends her sight beyond the Wall into the Yang World, \nthus allowing her to see Yang-entities such as kami and other natural spirits, as well \nas detect physical beings with abnormally high amounts of Yang energy (such as \nhengeyokai and hsien). To do so, the Cathayan’s player must concentrate for one \nminute and win or tie a Simple Test (retested with the Occult Ability). This vision \nlasts for one hour or until the end of the scene, whichever is longer. \nSecond, the character may sense the emotional “flares” that occur when two \nor more beings meet each other, thus often sensing their true feelings about their \nrelationship. For example, the Kuei-jin might observe two lovers meeting and see \nthat one flares feelings of love and devotion, while the other projects nothing but \nnervousness and guilt over an affair he’s having behind his partner’s back. To use \nthis talent, the character must succeed at a Simple Test against each target she \nwishes to scan. If successful, she may ask the target to provide a brief summary of \nhis true feelings about the person he just met with. Shen may spend a Willpower \nTrait to dim their reactions and render this power useless against them, although \nthey may only do so if they are aware that they’re being watched by another party \n(not necessarily the character). This power is best reserved for mortals alone, since \nusing it on shen and other Kuei-jin is considered a serious insult and breach of \netiquette. However, Kin-jin and other barbarians may be scanned at will. \nFinally, the vampire can use her attunement with life energies to “home in” \non a particular overriding passion in the surrounding area. The range of this power \nis 20 paces plus one pace per Mental Trait the vampire possesses. The passion \nchosen must be a strong one. Momentary annoyance or casual flirtation is not \nstrong enough for this talent to detect, but deep hatreds and true love are certainly \nfair game. The main advantage of this talent is for hunting (searching for lust when \nlooking for a mortal who will be easy to seduce, for example), although it also acts \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nas a good general detector for individuals with strong emotional enerm. To use this \npower, the Kuei-jin’s player must first pick a particular emotion. She may then ask \n(out of character) any character she passes if he is currently experiencing the \nemotion she is searching for, and the subject must answer honestly. If used for \nhunting, the player may subtract five minutes from his hunting time for each Trait \nof Yang he possesses (minimum five minutes). \nTraditional Chinese thought divided the soul into two halves: the lower, \nanimalistic soul (the Po), and the higher, rational soul (the Hun). While Kuei-jin \nof other cultures know them by different names, for the most part all Hungry Dead \naccept this dichotomy as representative of their condition. \nThe Hun reflects a character’s spirituality and sense of duty, her capacity for \nabstract thinking, aesthetic thought and her remaining empathy for humanity. \nHun is sometimes seen as a sense of conscience, but that description is not quite \nright (at least not in the sense of goodness and “Christian charity” that most \nWesterners attach to that word). Rather, Hun is a measure of a character’s sense \nof honor and devotion to duty - \nwhether that duty is the lawful administration \nof the Resplendent Cranes or the wicked ministrations of the Devil-Tigers is \nirrelevant. A Kuei-jin with a high P‘o and low Hun, for example, is little more than \nan animalistic killer, while one with high P o  and strong Hun rating is far more \nrefined - \na demon, but an honorable one nonetheless. Characters with high Hun \nratings seem very “in control,” and they possess a great deal of spiritual strength in \nthe face of adversity. Their rational side is well cultivated, and they seldom feel any \npull to give in to momentary urges or selfish impulses. Characters with low Hun \nratings tend to view existence in a very brutish and animalistic way. \nUsing Hun \nDemonAhs--eninvokingoneoftheDemonArtDisciplinesoftheP’o, \nthe Hun may be used to harness the P’o into a controlled frenzy. After (and only \nafter) the Demon Art is activated, the Kuei-jin’s player may make a Static Hun \nChallenge against a difficulty equal to her P o  score. Success enables her to evoke \nthe Demon Art while retaining her own Nature. Failure means the P o  takes over \nthe body while the Demon Art is used. \nEmpathy - \nA Kuei-jin may never have more empathy-related Attribute \nTraits (Empathetic, Compassionate, etc.) than he has Traits of Hun. \nShadow S U I -  Hun is the Trait used when resisting the takeover of the P’o \nduring shadow soul. Characters with high Hun ratings are too disciplined to let the \nanimalistic P’o take control on a whim. \nSharpened Senses - \nThis power is identical to the Auspex Discipline’s \npower of Heightened Senses. The Kuei-jin may spy on distant conversations, detect \ninvisible foes and otherwise enjoy the same benefits as that Discipline, although \nstrong stimuli such as bright lights or sudden loud noises may likewise incapacitate \nthe character temporarily. All this power requires is a minute of concentration to \nenact. In particularly chaotic circumstances, the Narrator may rule that a win or \ntie on a Simple Test is required to focus the Kuei-jin’s sharpened senses. This power \nlasts for a scene or until the Kuei-jin shuts off her increased sensitivity willingly. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nSpirit Speech - \nA Kuei-jin may make a Static Hun Challenge against a \ndifficulty of the local Wall to speak with a spirit, provided she can detect it in the \nfirst place. \nTempering the P’o - \nA Kuei-jin who succumbs to shadow soul is not \nentirely at the mercy of the P’o. While her higher side is powerless to stop the \nrampages of the Demon during this time, characters with enough resolve may \nremember the actions of the P’o and even subtly influence its behavior. The Kuei- \njin’s player must win a Static Hun Challenge against nine Traits to temper the P’o. \nSuccess does not prevent the shadow soul change, but it allows the Kuei-jin to \nremember the actions that the Demon takes during this time. Furthermore, the \ncharacter may spend a Willpower Trait to modify an action the P’o takes (such as \nmaiming a target instead of killing him) or delay one action the P’o wishes to take \nuntil the next turn, such as hesitating to allow an innocent victim time to escape. \nFinally, a Kuei-jin whose Hun soul stays aware during shadow soul may spend a \nWillpower Trait to speak one lucid sentence (such as yelling “Run, you fool!” at \nthe innocent victim from earlier, assuming he didn’t get the point already). \nAll Kuei-jin bear the taint of Yomi, an exaggeration of the darkest aspects of \ntheir own soul that rides their shoulders like a demonic imp, urging them toward \nself-destruction constantly and occasionally (or not so occasionally, depending on \nthe strength of the Kuei-j in in question) taking the reins to perpetrate unspeakable \nrampages of cruelty and perversity. The P’o is animalistic but fiendishly clever as \nwell, not like the mindless Beast of the Kin-jin, and the lures of the Demon are \noften as subtle as they are wicked. The P’o is the force that turns minor irritation \ninto killing fury, but the strength of the Demon is often also the only thing that can \nsave the Kuei-jin from certain destruction, a fact the Demon uses to its full \nadvantage. \nIt is important to remember that the Kuei-jin have studied the Demon for \nmillennia, and they do not seek only to contain and suppress it as the Kindred do \nwith the Beast. The P’o is as much a part of the character’s soul as anything else, \nmaybe not apart to be proud of, but a part nonetheless. It is not some alien presence \nto be destroyed, but the character’s own voice as heard through the winds of Hell. \nAs the greatest teachers of the shen teach their students, the P’o must be understood \nand assimilated if enlightenment is to be achieved, and characters who see the \nDemon within only as their enemy are doomed to a narrow existence indeed. The \nP’o does offer its Hun side some potent advantages, but always with a price that \nmost Kuei-jin would do well to inspect carefully before they pay, lest they become \nnothing more than pawns to their own depraved urges or worse. \nusing P’o \nBerserk Rage - \nThe character may attempt to prod his P’o into a berserk \nrage. Doing so is risky at best, but it can sometimes turn the tide of a desperate \nbattle. A Static P’o Challenge against a difficulty of the character’s Hun rating + \n3 (max 10) is required. If successful, the character enters fire soul immediately (see \nthe systems chapter for the benefits/ drawbacks of fire soul). He also gains access \nto Demon Chi during this time. \nDemon Arts - \nA character cannot possess a higher level of a Demon Art \nthan his P’o rating, which translates in the following manner. Characters with 1- \n4 Po Traits are limited to Basic Demon Arts; those with 5-7 P’o Traits can have \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nIntermediate Demon Arts; those with 8+ P’o Traits can possess Advanced Demon \nArts. \nDemon Chi - \nThe character may attempt to channel the strength of his \nDemon into his actions, though doing so leaves him vulnerable to falling into \nshadow soul during this time. For each Trait of permanent Po, the character is \nconsidered to have one Trait of Demon Chi. Demon Chi may be spent in a similar \nmanner to the Black WindDemm Art, even if the character doesn’t actually possess \nthat Discipline. Each Chi Trait spent in this fashion counts as a temporary level \nof the Black Wind for the turn. (Thus, the character could spend three Demon Chi \nand receive three extra actions or three temporary levels of supernatural strength.) \nTo gain access to Demon Chi for a scene, the player must make a Static P o  \nChallenge against a difficulty equal to his Hun Virtue + 3. \nOnce spent, Demon Chi is gone for the night, although feeding at some \ndefiled sites may restore Demon Chi earlier at the Storyteller’s discretion. Upon \nawakening each evening, the character may make a number of Simple Tests equal \nto his permanent P’o rating. Each success indicates a Trait of Demon Chi regained. \nFangs - \nUnlike the Kin-jin, Cathayans have no natural fangs, but by \nspending a Trait of Demon Chi they may sprout fangs that are, in all respects, \nidentical to those of a Western vampire. By spending two Demon Chi Traits, they \nmay sprout a hideous fanged maw. The character is two Traits up on all biting \nattacks, and he inflicts aggravated damage with his bite, but the maw cannot be \nhidden. Both such uses of Demon Chi last for one scene. \nNature Shift - \nThe P’o is usually the Virtue used to determine if the \ncharacter enters fire, shadow or wave soul. See the individual descriptions of these \nstates for more details. \nResistance - \nIf the Kuei-jin suffers from magical mind control, he may \nattempt to use the savagery of the P’o to break the bond. The player must win a \nStatic P’o Challenge against nine Traits. Success means the control is broken, but \nthe player must also test for shadow soul immediately. \nShadow Soul - \nThe most feared power of the P’o is to take over the Kuei- \njin’s body, subsuming the Hun nature to carry out its darkest desires. When the Po \nis dominant, the character’s P’o Archetype replaces the character’s normal nature, \nand the player must roleplay the dominance of his character’s dark side appropri- \nately. If the player is incapable of doing so, the Storyteller is free to step in and \ndictate the P’o-dominated character’s actions. Shadow soul typically lasts for one \nscene, at which time the Hun may reassert itself, although the Storyteller may \nmodify that time according to the nature of the incident that provoked the change \nand the relative strength of the character’s P’o. It is also important to note that \nunless the character uses his Hun to temper the Po, the Hun remembers nothing \nof what happens during the time of the Po’s control. The character must find out \nfrom other sources what his Demon made him do during this time, and the answers \noften aren’t very pretty. More than one Kuei-j in has gone mad or even spiraled back \ninto Yomi after “awakening” to discover slain loved ones or see centuries of \nplanning undone in a single moment of darkness. \n(For more on roleplaying shadow soul, see the systems chapter on p. 195.) \nIf none of these Archetypes seems appropriate, work with the Storyteller to \ndesign your own P’o. Wraith: The Oblivion and the Shadow Play- \nGuide have \na number of suggestions that could easily be adapted for P’o Archetypes. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nThe Bandit - \nThe Bandit sees no use in the Great Cvcle. It ignores the \nmandates of Heaven and Hell, preferring chaos to order, and any servant of order \nmakes a fine target. The Bandit can force a test for shadow soul whenever anyone \norders the Kuei-jin to do anything or tries to put him “in his proper place.” Bandits \nascendant are out to smash and destroy, less for sheer pleasure like the Demon, but \nto invite chaos and destroy order. Many enjoy committing crime, and it is not \nuncommon to find a Bandit at work in a tong or some other criminal organization. \nThe BQtbarian-The \nBarbarian prefers the relative freedom of the West over \nwhat it sees as the stifling confines of useless, antiquated Eastern formality, and it \nnever fails to take any opportunity to compare Cathayan and Cainite ways. A test \nfor shadow soul is in order whenever adhering to some traditional practice would \ncause the Kuei-jin pain or other hardship. The Barbarian may also attempt to \nmanifest if it encounters Kin-jin. Once in shadow soul, a Barbarian may deal freely \nwith Kin-jin, trample on traditional beliefs or even dare to disrespect to the elders. \nThe Deceiver -The Deceiver has no use for the truth in any form. It lies for \nthe sake of practice, occasionally sprinkling in flattery, followed with wild \nfalsehood, all to render the Hun unable to trust himself or move without the advice \nof his Po. The Deceiver seeks to take over whenever an opportunity to lie would \nbe more advantageous, usually after the Hun has tried and failed to solve the \nsituation through truth. A Deceiver in control merely has a larger field in which \nto spread his lies, often laying a number of unpleasant surprises for the Hun to find. \nThe Demon - \nAll that the Demon sees exists for its own whim, to devour \nand destroy as it sees fit. There is no other need but its own, no other pleasure but \nits own. Western eyes would see the Demon as a sociopath. The Demon attempts \nto take over when it sees an opportunity to make itself stronger by the destruction \nof another. Demons ascendant can be terrifying. Some are out-and-out destructive, \nseeking to slake their hungers in the most gruesome manner (such as through \ntorture or murder - \nserial killers are often sociopathic). Others are more insidious \nand cunning, looking for pleasure in stalking, psychological games or traps laid for \nthe Hun. Demons, however, prefer to be their own masters, and even the most \ndepraved Demon is disinterested in a deal with the Yama Kings. \nThe Fool - \nThe Fool is, to put it kindly, simple-minded. It demands \nexplanations for even the most self-evident action, and it is incapable of planning \nand executing anything but short-term plans with no complications. A Fool also \nis rarely silent, continually prattling, wanting explanation and generally trying to \nget the Hun to take the easy way out. The Fool can attempt to take over whenever \nthe Hun finds itself at a loss for words or in an awkward situation. Once in shadow \nsoul, the Fool usually demonstrates why he is called the Fool - \nupsetting careful, \nlong-range plans for immediate action, saying exactly the wrong thing, and trying \nto find the easy way out of any situation. \nThe Legaliit -The opposite of the Bandit, the Legalist is order to the point \nof rigidity. There is a correct way to do everything, and the Legalist will give the \nHun no peace about mistakes or “insults” to the divine order ofthings. The Legalist \nthreatens takeover if an inferior is disrespectful of the Hun (and the Legalist alone \nknows who’s inferior), or if the Kuei-jin herself is disrespectful. Legalists in shadow \nsoul can be unpleasant to deal with, haranguing other Kuei-jin about their bad \nbehavior and seeking the power to enact punishment against those so “disrespect- \nful.” \nThe Monkey- Capricious, easily distracted, full of grandiose ideas for very \nlittle gain - \nthat is the Monkey. If the Kuei-jin has an overarching goal for her \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nreturn to the Middle Kingdom, the Monkey doesn’t care, preferring pleasures and \nnovel distractions to serious matters. The Monkey attempts to take over when it \nsees a diversion that would distract the Hun from its business, particularly one that \nthe Hun would be interested in normally. A Monkey in shadow soul is exhausting \nto keep up with, running hither and thither, letting anything remotely important \nto the Hun fall into ruin. Many’s the Hun who’s awakened from shadow soul to \ndiscover himself with a small hoard of trinkets and his plans in shambles. \nThe Slave -The \nSlave has no belief in the Kuei-jin, and it seeks constantly \nto place the Kuei-jin under the control of another, because obviously the Kuei-jin \ncan barely take care of himself. It questions the Kuei-jin’s judgement continuously, \nforcing him to admit that he has no self-worth and is incapable. Even worse, the \nSlave wishes to serve the Yama Kings, and a Cathayan with a Slave Po risks \nbecoming akuma. The Slave attempts to take over whenever the Hun is in the \npresence of someone older, stronger or wiser, or if a plan of the Kuei-jin’s goes \ndisastrously wrong. When the Slave achieves shadow soul, it sets about its primary \ngoal of finding masters to yoke the Kuei-jin; many times, the Slave uses such times \nto attempt to further contracts with the Yama Kings. \nChi is the energy that fuels all vampires. Unable to enjoy the pleasures of \nmortal flesh or the comfort of more mundane gratification, only Chi itself offers \nsustenance to Cathayans. Most Kuei-jin must consume blood or flesh to survive, \nalthough elder vampires are rumored to be able to subsist on other things. It is with \nthe Chi contained in blood that a vampire draws on the strengths of the \nundead condition. \nChi Traits do not have adjectives. Rather, each Trait simply represents a \nquantity of energy. Chi Traits can be represented with cards. When a character \ngains Chi Traits by feeding, take the cards from the victim. When Chi Traits are \nspent, give the cards to a Narrator or Storyteller. \nYour starting ChiTrait total is determined by your Dharma. When you come \ninto play for an evening’s game, make a test with a Narrator as you pick up your \ncharacter sheet. If you win, you come into play with all of your Chi Traits, as \ndetermined by Dharma. If you tie, you have half your Dharma limit of Chi Traits, \nrounded up. If you lose, you come into play with only four Chi Traits. Certain \nMerits, Flaws, Dharma disadvantages or other circumstances may alter your \nnumber of Chi Traits at the beginning ofplay. Possession of the Herd Background, \nhowever, allows you to come into play with more Chi Traits, up to your Dharma \nlimit (see the appropriate Background descriptions on p. 95 for Herd). \nWhen you have expended a great deal of Chi, you become hungry. A hungry \nvampire is susceptible to the Demon’s urges and to fire soul due to the ravenous lust \nfor sustenance. You are considered hungry if at five or fewer Chi Traits. You may \nbe susceptible to fire soul at the sight, smell or taste of blood or other applicable \nsources of nourishment (see “Chi Virtues” on p. 108). If you have two or fewer Chi \nTraits, you are ravenous, and your difficulty to resist fire soul due to hunger goes up \nby one Trait, making it very likely that you enter fire soul at the first opportunity \nto feed. \nFeeding is the only way to replenish Chi. You can take Chi Traits from \nmortals, other vampires or other creatures with Chi energy, such as animals or \nhengeyokai. However, each Chi Trait drained inflicts a level of lethal damage on \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nthe victim. Up to three Chi Traits may be drained each turn. You can close the \nwound by licking it to seal up traces of your feeding. You may only heal such wounds \nthat were made by your fangs, which means that most Cathayans must be careful \nwhen feeding, since fangs do not come naturally to them as they do to the Kin-jin. \nYou can expend Chi Traits for a variety of functions: \n*YoumustspendaChlTraiteachnightatsunset,forsimplesustenance. \nSeethechi \nVirtue descriptions for the effects of each type of Chi when used for animation. \nOne Chi Trait heals two health levels of bashing damage or one level of \nlethal damage. You are still limited to your Dharma limits of blood expenditure (so \nmost young vampires cannot heal more than one or two health levels of damage \nin a turn). Healing in this fashion requires your concentration and a full turn. It \ncannot be done in the same turn that the character makes an attack. \nSpending one Chi Trait grants an extra Physical Trait for the duration of \na conflict. You can bid this Trait like any other (“by the blazing power of Yang”), \nand you can count this Trait in ties and overbids. You can spend Chi in this way \nas a reflexive action at any time, not counting as your turn, though you still obey \nthe limits of Chi-expenditure according to Dharma level. You can raise your \nPhysical Traits up to the limit of your Dharma for one conflict. Any additional \nTraits added with Chi beyond that remain only for the duration of a single challenge. \nNote: You may use this benefit only if you possess a Shinta’ Discipline which \nallows you to improve your Physical Traits (it’s listed in the Discipline descrip- \ntions}, and you may gain only Traits appropriate to the type listed in the shintai. \nIf your shintai specifies strength, for example, you cannot bid the Trait gained in \nchallenges related to speed or stamina, unless you possess another shintai that \nwould allow such usage. \nThree Chi Traits can be spent to heal one level of aggravated damage. This \ndamage heals over the day, as the vampire sleeps. Chi Traits spent this way can be \naccumulated. That is, you need not spend the three Traits all at once, or even all \nin the same day. You should note Traits expended in this fashion with marks next \nto your level of aggravated damage. Once you have spent three Chi Traits on the \ninjury, it heals the next time the sunsets. You can heal only one level of aggravated \ndamage per day in this fashion, though, unless you also spend a Willpower Trait for \neach extra wound healed in the same rest period. \nMany Disciplines require the expenditure of Chi Traits, as listed in their \nindividual descriptions. If a particular Discipline costs multiple Chi Traits but your \nDharma prohibits you from spending all of the blood at once, you must spend the \nblood on successive turns. Spending blood in this fashion is usually reflexive, \nthough the Discipline itself may require an action. For instance, activating Black \nWind is reflexive. You spend a Chi Trait and still get your normal action, plus extra \nactions or other benefits from Black Wind. \nWillpower Traits measure the strength of your character’s resolve and sense \nof self. By exerting your Willpower, you can withstand otherwise untenable \nconditions, renew your commitment to a course of action and empower certain \ndifficult Disciplines. \nWillpower Traits are not described with adjectives. You simply have perma- \nnent Willpower - \nyour normal limit of Willpower Traits - \nand temporary \nWillpower, your expendable Traits. Your Dharma also determines the maximum \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nlevel to which you can improve your permanent Willpower. When you expend \ntemporary Willpower Traits or raise your permanent Willpower, you regain \ntemporary Traits at a rate of one per game session (although your Storyteller may \nvary this pace to suit the needs of her game or to simplify bookkeeping). \nExpending a Willpower Trait allows for one of any number of effects. \nGenerally, Willpower Traits allow you to keep self-determination and to empower \nextremely difficult or complex actions. Using Willpower is almost always a \nreflexive action, and it does not count as your turn. \nA Willpower Trait can be spent to refresh all of your lost Traits in one \nAttribute category- Physical, Social or Mental. You may do so once per category \nper game session. \nExpenditure of a Willpower Trait allows you to gain aretest when defending \nagainst a Mental or Social Challenge. Trait loss works as normal for such retests. \nNote that certain Disciplines or powers may override this stipulation. \nSpending one Willpower Trait enables you to enter a challenge for which \nyou lack an appropriate Ability. Thus, you can make a test even if you would \nnormally require a specific Ability that you don’t have (or have used up). \nYou can spend a Willpower Trait to try to control yourself briefly while in \nfire, wave or shadow soul. You are able to act normally for one turn when you spend \nWillpower in this fashion, though you otherwise keep all the other stipulations of \nsuch states - \nignoring wound penalties and so on. You do not actually regain \ncontrol so much as you fight mightily to direct yourself for a few moments in the \nface of overwhelming rage, terror or inner corruption. Roleplay your actions \nappropriately. \nYou can expend a Willpower Trait to ignore all wound penalties, up to and \nincluding Incapacitated, for the duration of one full turn. \nCertain Disciplines or powers require the expenditure of Willpower. \nAs listed previously under Attributes, you can take Negative Traits to specify \nparticular weaknesses inherent to your character. The listings of Negative Traits \nare included with the other Traits on p. 7 1-78. \nWhen someone guesses your Negative Trait successfully in a challenge, you \nare forced to risk an additional Trait to continue with the challenge. Thus, if you \nenter a Mental Challenge but your opponent guesses one of your Negative Mental \nTraits successfully, you must bid and risk an additional Trait to continue with the \nchallenge. If you do not have any more Traits to risk, you lose the \nchallenge automatically. \nAs optional Traits to flesh out your character, Merits and Flaws allow you to \nspecify particular advantages or disadvantages that are not covered by Attributes, \nAbilities or Backgrounds. All Merits and Flaws are organized into specific catego- \nries, according to their type. To purchase a Merit, you must expend Free Traits \nequal to the cost of the Merit. Conversely, taking a Flaw hinders you with a \nhandicap of some sort, but it offers additional Free Traits for character creation. \nYou can take up to seven Traits each of Merits and Flaws. Some elder characters \nmay have more. Certainly, very old vampires may develop potential capabilities \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nand resources outstripping their younger counterparts, or they may succumb to \nmore terrible illnesses of body and mind. \nNormally, you must purchase Merits and Flaws during character creation. \nHowever, with an appropriate story, you may be able to buy a new Merit (with \nExperience equal to double its value) or overcome a Flaw (again, with Experience \nequal to double its value). \nfqE@OuSW 4- MWTS SyD W\nS\n \nIn the interests of time and space, not all of the Merits and Flaws listed in Lam \nofthe Night and other books are reprinted here.

A few (Enemy, Notoriety) may \nalso be appropriate, but be careful. \nMortal Society \nRecommended- Nightclub, Hunted (by Shih or Strike Force Zero especially) \nDisallowed - \nNone \nPhysical \nRecommended - \nHuge Size, Allergic, Disfigured, Child, Deformity, Monstrous \nDisallowed - \nBaby Face (automatic for Yang vampires, impossible for Yin), \nMisplaced Heart, Efficient Digestion, Sekctiwe Digestion, Thin-Blooded \nItUW-JlY rirs \nAkuma (3 Trait Flaw) \nWhether because you have been revealed to be a servant of one of the Yama \nKings, or because you have violated Kuei-jin tradition once too often, you have \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nbeen branded duma, a devil-infested exile. Any Kuei-jin may hunt you down and \ndestroy you without fear of retribution, and you are a true outcast, beneath \nconsideration of the laws and practices of Cathayan society (even the Fivefold \nWay). Due to the immense size of the Middle Kingdom, akuma can occasionally \ntravel ahead of their reputation for quite some time, or maybe even set up a new \nidentity. It is unlikely, however, that you will have an easy unlife in any case, as your \nsecret could be revealed at any moment. If and only if you actually do serve one of \nthe Yama Kings, you may purchase the Demon Mentor Merit (5 Traits). Your \ndemonic master visits you often in nightmares with orders and advice, and while \nhe may gift you with a magic talisman from time to time, most demons are \nnotoriously intolerant of failure. In any event, the Narrator is responsible for \nplaying the Yama King. See p. 21 1 for more on “true” akuma. \nS W r S p L  \nDifferent Body (1 Trait Flaw) \nMost Kuei-jin return in their original bodies, even if they have to scrape them \nfrom the Ocean floor or piece them together from blackened fragments, but for \nsome reason, you came back in another person’s body. Perhaps it’s karmic \nretribution, or maybe Heaven is just having a joke at your expense, but this \ncondition is a source of great shame and embarrassment to most Kuei-jin, not to \nmention constant minor annoyances. Uncomfortable as you are with this new \nframe, you shift and fidget constantly, and you even exhibit some of the body’s old \nmannerisms or physical tics from time to time. Most Kuei-jin with this Flaw will \ngo to great lengths to “establish” their identity with their clothing or other external \nmodifications. Of course, if the body’s original spirit is still around, things can get \ninteresting indeed.. . . \ns~rqwpruF= \nDefiled (6 Trait Flaw) \nYou have ingested corrupt or infected Chi at some point, and this inauspicious \naction will haunt you until your - \nlikely untimely - \ndeath. Defiled vampires are \nin constant pain from the burning, boiling Chi within them, and they suffer terrible \nnightmares as well (that Flaw is included in the cost of this one). Thus, their wound \npenalties are treated as one level less than they are actually suffering unless they \nare reduced below Incapacitated, since defiled vampires are used to constant \nsuffering. However, the benefits end there. Any time the Kuei-jin’s player fails a \nchallenge directly involving Chi or Willpower, he must make a Simple Test \nimmediately. On a win or a tie, nothing happens. On a failure, the character gains \na “Defiled Trait,” which should be recorded by the Narrator. Once the character \ngains enough Defiled Traits to equal his permanent Hun rating, he vomits up three \nChi Traits and loses a permanent health level as the defiled Chi bums away his \ninsides. If he does not have enough ChiTraits, substitute Willpower Traits instead. \nFew Kuei-j in with this Flaw live very long unlives, and while some bodhisattvas are \nsaid to know a cure, no one has ever proven one to exist. Most defiled Kuei-jin are \nlabeled akuma. This Flaw is most common to those Cathayans who feed near \nHiroshima and Nagasaki, but any defiled site can give off defiled Chi. \nVengeful Ancestors (4 Trait Flaw) \nYour very existence is a mark of shame on your family honor, and your ancestor \nspirits are not content to let your conscience be the only reminder of that sad fact. \nIndeed, one or more of them often appear to you and plague you with visions of your \nmiserable existence and their deep sorrow at what you have become. Some of them \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\neven try to ruin your feeding habits by scaring off prey or committing other \nannoying acts. By behaving piously and otherwise appeasing their wishes, you may \nsatisfy them temporarily, but they will always return until this Flaw is bought off. \nThose Kuei-jin wise in the ways of spirit manipulation beware: Those who try to \ndeal forcefully or disrespectfully with their own ancestors are severely punished by \nthe spirit worlds for such a grave breach of etiquette. Optionally, you may take this \nFlaw in the form of a former lover or other soul dear to you who disapproves of your \nstanding as one of the Hungry Dead. \nfsrcnologjcsl \nSuperstitious (1 or 3 Trait Flaw) \nMany legends Westerners commonly associate with vampires actually origi- \nnated in the East, and you have inherited a potent belief in more than a few of them. \nPerhaps the sifu who taught you had a twisted sense of humor, or maybe you clashed \nwith a mortal who had the power to actually enforce these old chestnuts, but \nwhatever it is, you believe absolutely in the validity of common mortal supersti- \ntions. The number of traditions you are bound by and the commonality of their \nOccurrence determines the value of this Flaw. For example, vampires who recoil \nfrom mirrors or are unable to enter holy sites suffer from a one-Trait Flaw, while \nthose who compulsively count grains of rice thrown in their path or recoil from \nhuman saliva suffer from a three-Trait Flaw. \n-D= \nIlliterate (3 Trait Flaw) \nYou cannot read or write, no matter how many levels of the Linguistics Ability \nyou might possess. Furthermore, you may not learn to read until this Flaw has been \nbought off. \nciiumxw soylm \nNote: With rare Storyteller exceptions, these Traits are only available to \nWestern characters playing in Middle Kingdom games, and they are intended to \nact as flavor for the chronicle, not to allow every Western character to pick up some \nextra Negative Traits just by hopping a plane to Hong Kong for the weekend. \nKanbujian (4 Trait Flaw) \nThis Flaw is somewhat deceptive, since kanbujian (“unable to see,” derived \nfrom their Dharmic blindness) are not actually Westerners, but rather Kuei-jin \nwho have arisen outside of the Middle Kingdom, typically amidst the Chinatowns \nand Little Indias of the world. This Flaw is considered a Cathayan Society Flaw \nbecause of the disadvantages they suffer there. Kanbujian are extremelyrare, to say \nthe least, and most never surpass the chih-mi stage before being destroyed by the \narea’s supernatural population, but those that do survive present an interesting \npuzzle to Kin-jin and Kuei-jin alike. Players seeking to play kanbujian characters \nshould remember that their characters must be of pure (or very nearly so) Asian \nlineage, no matter where they hail from, and that they will likely be treated as \npariahs by both East and West if they are ever discovered. However, those looking \nfor a challenge or who seek to play among a group of unsuspecting Westerners may \nfind that kanbujian are right up their alley, provided they secure Storyteller \npermission first, of course. Kanbujian characters are created exactly the same as \nregular Kuei-jin, with a few important exceptions: \nKanbujian have no Dharma; they start with Humanity, much as Kin-jin do. \n(See Laws ofthe Night for details.) Only with the training of a Kuei-jin mentor \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\ncan kunbujian hope to begin their Dharmic journey, although if they manage to \nbegin such training, they advance normally. \nKanbujian cannot learn any complex Disciplines: Tapestry, Yin or Yang \nPram, Chi’iu Muh or any others the Storyteller deems require too much knowledge \nof traditional Kuei-jin ways. Of course, the kanbujian still cannot learn Kin-jin \nDisciplines, no matter who takes them in. Kanbujian pay for Disciplines as do \nregular Kuei-jin, provided they have a Kuei-jin mentor to teach them. \nKanbujian cannot take Mentor, Rites or other Backgrounds specific to \nCathayan society during character creation. They may be learned at normal cost \nlater on, provided again that a suitable teacher can be found. \nKanbujian know nothing of Kuei-jin society, and they are typically treated \nas nonpersons by other Kuei-jin, meaning they have no standing in court. They \nmust often endure long hours of instruction and training before they can hope to \nbe accepted into one. \nGaijidGweilo (6 Trait Fla \nBy taking this Flaw, you are marked as thoroughly Western by everyone you \nmeet. Whether it’s your dress, manners, accent, looks or some other factor, you are \nperceived as very unappealing by the native population, and they tend to make \ntheir dealings with you as quick and unpleasant as possible. At best, you typically \nget polite but curt responses and inflexible prices. At worst, you are picked as easy \nprey by criminals and otherwise taken advantage of whenever the natives feel they \ncan get away with it. Not that strangers will attack you on the street at every turn, \nbut you are unwelcome, and the native population will do its best to make sure you \nknow it. You have a two-Trait penalty on any non-supernatural Social Challenges \nwith mortal natives of the area, it costs roughly twice as much to live in the area \nas it would for a native, and all uses of Influence that are locally based take twice \nas much time as normal. Otherwise, the real nuances of this Flaw are largely up to \nthe Storyteller to enforce, but they should be a constant irritation at the least. Note \nthat this Flaw is not based on your actual personality in any way, but on the native \nperception of foreigners. You may be a kind and gentle soul, but the fact of your \norigin has marked you as unwanted from the beginning. \nTaking this Trait as a Merit means that you have undertaken the painstaking \nprocess of acclimating yourself to the native accents, points of etiquette and other \nfine cultural nuances that separate those merely familiar with a culture to those \nwho truly live in it. What’s more, you have mastered them to a degree where you \nhave earned the acceptance of the natives and are treated as an honored equal in \nmost situations. While a great deal of stigma is attached to foreigners, an equally \ngreat sum of respect is accorded to those foreigners who take the time to learn the \nnative ways and honor them. You are one Trait up on non-supernatural Social \nChallenges with natives, your lifestyle costs a normal amount (perhaps even a little \nless), and Influence use takes the standard time. Furthermore, in a group of \nWesterners you are probably the only character who would be allowed to exist in \nan Eastern court, much less be taken seriously when addressing one. If anyone has \nachance at getting the other Westerners forgiven for their barbaric mistakes before \nthey’re extinguished, you’re the one. Otherwise, it’s up to the Storyteller and other \ncharacters to fill in the details of how well you’re treated, but it should be quite \ndifferent from Westerners without this Merit (much less the Flaw). Naturally, you \nmust keep up on your manners if you wish to retain this Merit. Doing so typically \nmeans possessing several Etiquette and Linguistics Traits, though not always - \nand \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nthe Storyteller may revoke it if he finds you have been acting in an overly \nWesternized manner. \nNote:Not every Western character must take this Merit/Flaw. Those without \neither are assumed to fit in adequately, not so well that they attract a great deal of \nrespect but not so poorly they are lumped in with the great mass of boorish \nWesterners. Characters of Asian descent but Western upbringing, or natives who \nhave been “Westernized” and then returned, may take this Flaw with Storyteller \npermission, but even so, it is only worth half as much to them. (They cannot take \nthe Merit, since they are assumed to fit in well enough unless otherwise specified.) \nSome enlightened individuals may go from having the Flaw to possessing the Merit \nover time. The Pilot character from Shogun is a perfect example of a foreigner who \nbegan as anonperson but wound up learning the native ways and eaming their respect. \nCourt Appointment (2 Trait Merit) \nA rare specimen indeed, not only have you been recognized as a full person \nby a particular court of the Kuei-jin, but unlike other Kin-jin, you can expect to be \ntreated as an insider by the local undead, even if their fairness and respect is \nsometimes delivered a bit coolly. As far as the court is concerned, you are a true \nmember, and you may enjoy the full measure of its justice and protection from any \nwho would attempt to harm you. You may even have a voice in court affairs, albeit \nusually a rather small one. \nNaturally, the Cathayans do not extend such permission lightly. Simply \ndeciding to drop by the area for a spell is not enough justification for this Merit. \nRather, a court appointment is typically granted in exchange for some duties or \nother benefits you agree to provide the court, and the court is well within its power \nto renounce its recognition if you prove deceitful or otherwise unwilling to fulfill \nyour obligations. Bear in mind as well that one court’s protection may not save you \nfrom the wrath of another court, nor necessarily insulate you from the intrigues of \nyour “home” court. Most Kuei-jin would have no qualms about sacrificing a \nforeigner if it meant saving the court as a whole. Likewise, other Kin-jin will almost \ncertainly consider appointment to such a post high treason, even if you are not \nactually betraying the secrets of other Western undead, and they will take steps to \nremove such a dangerous informant from the presence of the Cathayans. Court \nappointees therefore walk a dangerous line between two cultures, but they stand \nto gain much in the shadows if they are strong enough. \nThis Merit differs from the Merit: Gaijin/ Gweilo in that the former concerns \nKuei-jin politics alone, while the second addresses mostly mortal society. You do \nnot need to purchase the Merit: Gaijin/ Gweilo to purchase this Merit, though it \nwould certainly help. However, it is extremely unlikely that you can possess this \nMerit ifyou have purchased the Flaw: Gaijin/ Gweilo; the court would have tostand \nto gain something extrmdinary to justify putting up with such an obnoxious \nforeign devil! \nNote: Cainites without this Merit are not necessarily killed on sight, but they \nare considered to have no voice in court and no recourse in the eyes of Kuei-jin \njustice. They exist even more at the whim of the mandarins than most. Unrecog- \nnized Kin-jin also tend to make excellent scapegoats/ target-practice for a court \nwhen things go wrong, so while they may take tea with whoever will have them, \nsuch Kin-jin had best step lightly indeed and keep one eye on the exit at all times. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nUnlike the fractious lives of the Westerners and their paranoid coteries, the \nKuei-jin are bound together on many levels by powerful ties of loyalty. Perhaps \nnone are so binding, however, as those which hold a Kuei-jin wu together, a bond \nwhich is known as w n x i  by the Kuei-jin. It is the result of a Reciprocity spell cast \non the wu by the elders of the court when the wu is recognized. In game terms, the \nguunxi acts exactly like a Sabbat Vaulderie score, cementing the bonds of the wu \nto something mystic and nearly unbreakable. A character arrives at his guanxi \nrating with each of his wu-mates by means of the following formula: 5 + (wu-mate’s \nCharisma-related Social Traits) - (your character’s P‘o or Yin score, whichever is \nhigher). The final score is considered the character’s guanxi rating toward that \nparticular Kuei-jin. Note that agwnxi rating can and likely will change over time. \nCharacters who acquire more Yin or P’o Traits start becoming too callous or self- \ncentered to feel a strong bond, while a character who blossoms into a charismatic \nleader over time attracts more favorable attention from her fellow wu members. \nNote, however, that unless their bond is somehow broken, even characters with \nlittle or nogumxi rating are still bound to all their wu brethren. They simply have \nmuch less trouble than the others might about acting against their fellows. Only \nif the bond is specifically dissolved do all the emotional attachments and feelings \nof loyalty disappear. \nFor those unfamiliar with the Vaulderie system, more information can be \nfound in the Sabbat section on p. 224-225 in Laws ofthe Night. A brief summary \nof relevant points is as follows, however. The guanxi is a bond as strong as any blood \nbond of the Kin-jin, and it carries all the relevant emotional and intellectual \nweight. In effect, Kueiejin view those vampires that they share aguanxi with as old, \ntrue friends, and they should act accordingly around them. These are not simply \ngood buddies or fellow soldiers. They are the ones acharacter turn to when he needs \nhelp the most, no matter what their Dharma or direction might be. To be sure, \ncharacters who share gwanxi may still argue, think ill of each other and even spar \non occasion, but they stand as one against any outside threat or coercive force, no \nmatter what. In order to actually plot against someone for whom the character has \naguunxi rating of 3 ot higher, the player must spend one Willpower Trait. In order \nto plot against someone for whom the character has aguanxi rating of 6 or over, the \nplayer must spend two Willpower Traits. It is one thing to vent one’s frustrations \nabout how pig-headed or obnoxious a wu member may be; it’s quite another to plot \nto disgrace or assault someone that the character knows at heart to be a close and \ntrusted friend. \nTo attempt the destruction of someone for whom the character has a guanxi \nrating at all, the player must bum two Willpower. Without the burned Willpower, \nthe character finds herself realizing the person she hates is loyal to the wu and \ntherefore worthy of respect. Characters with aguanxi rating of 6 or over must bum \na Willpower Trait e v q  turn they wish to assault their wu member, so strong is their \nbond of friendship. In other words, while the characters may even come to blows \nunder harsh circumstances, it is nigh impossible in the Kuei-jin’s mind to find \ncircumstances that justify actually destroying a wu member. Even if they discover \nthe unthinkable - \nthat a wu member has betrayed them - \nmost Kuei-jin still \ncannot bring themselves to kill their former friend, overwhelmed as they are by \nmemories of better days and moments of emotional solidarity with the traitor. Such \nwrenching scenes should be moments of impassioned high drama if there ever were \nany. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nUnlike the Sabbat, however, who actively frown on the destruction of a \nVaulderie, Kuei-jin do not automatically distrust those who choose to leave a wu \n(though habitual deserters are often labeled heimin and regarded with great \nsuspicion). While most Kuei-jin treasure their wu as a prime source of friendship \nand support in their unlives, they all agree that those who do not wish to be part \nof such a group do both sides a favor by removing themselves from it. All that is \nrequired to remove one or more wu members from their guanxi is to petition the \ncourt to lift the Reciprocity spell in question. It is within the power of the court to \nquestion and even veto such a request, although the latter is seldom the case unless \nthe court truly suspects foul play. It is also rumored that the Yama Kings can free \none of the bonds of guanxi, though the whispers say that one must become akuma \nto be granted this “privilege.” If the request is approved, though, theguanxi ratings \nin question are dissolved and the character is free to choose his own path. However, \nsuch feelings do not fade so quickly, and players whose characters leave the bonds \nof guanxi are strongly encouraged to roleplay the fact that while they are no longer \nbound to their former wu-mates mystically, they typically still harbor some strong \nfeelings for them, good or bad. \nOverall, it is not unusual to find a wu composed of individuals with vastly \ndiffering Dharmas, directions and Natures who fight with each other like cats in \na sack on their own time, but who band together with frightening efficiency in the \nfield. Such are the bonds that hold Kuei-jin society together. Without the unity of \nthe wucontributing to the stability ofthe whole, the Cathayans claim, their society \nwould be as fractious and squabbling as that of the petty Kin-jin. \nAs sentient beings, we collate the information that is presented to us in our \ndaily lives and hopefully become better people for our experiences. During our life, \nwe learn from the mistakes of yesterday and prepare for the challenges of tomorrow. \nExperience in Laws of the East is represented by giving each character one \nto three ExperienceTraits at the end of each session. The number ofTraits awarded \nis based on how well a character performed during the course of the story and how \nactive a player was in the game. The Narrator decides how many Traits each player \nreceives on completion of the session. All players receive a standard one Trait. \nExceptional roleplayers, those who played an exceptionally memorable part, \nshould receive two. Three Traits should be awarded to those characters who \nperformed acts of incredible insight and courage, making the game truly memo- \nrable for everyone involved. On a normal night, each player will receive one \nExperience Trait. \nIf you are a Narrator, you should be consistent and fair in awarding Experi- \nence. Do it in the open, and be prepared to explain the rationale for your decisions \nin accordance with the rules. If the players disagree, hear them out and make sure \nyou know the whole story, then award Experience to those who have earned it. \nBe careful, as awarding too many Experience Traits can make characters too \npowerful too quickly and give players lax attitudes toward working for their goals. \nHowever, awarding too few disheartens the players and damages their sense of \nachievement. \nAwarding Experience Traits, therefore, requires a delicate balance between \nsatisfying players and maintaining the integrity of the game. If you follow the \nguidelines listed here, you probably won’t get into too much trouble. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nAutomatic - \nEach character receives one Experience Trait Der game. \n-\n-\n \nrepresenting the acquisition of common, everyday knowledge. \nRoleplaying-Narrators \nshould encourage roleplaying.

Someone who got involved, and propelled the plot by \nher efforts, deserves a third Trait. It should be noted that if more than one of the \nplayers were integral to the progression of the story, each of the players who showed \nsuch leadership should be awarded a Trait. \nwwq ~*HUHIcL- \nExperience Traits may be spent to purchase new Abilities, Traits and \nDisciplines, improving a character and giving the player a sense of satisfaction as \nhe watches his character grow more potent.

After checking with Evan, the \nStoryteller, he decides he wishes to play one of the Kuei-jin. Jim puts on an \ninspirational CD while the two of them take a copy of the rulebook and sit down \nto create a character. \nSTEP ONE: &WcrW \nJim begins by looking for a concept, a basic idea around which he can build \nhis character. Knowing that Kuei-jin frequently return to life to settle old scores, \nJim thinks for a while before coming up with an idea. He imagines a simple laborer \nand devoted family man who was murdered by a vicious tong for failing to pay \nprotection money, and who was forced to watch his children be murdered before \nhis own death came. Now his character seeks to punish his killers and defend any \nhelpless children he finds. Such a powerful and wrenching motive could easily \ninspire a soul to return from Yomi, and Evan approves the idea. Looking further \ninto the concept, Jim settles on Yang for his character’s Chi balance (he came back \nbecause of his deep love of life), as well as choosing the eastern direction (also a \nnatural choice for a character devoted to protecting mortals). Weighing several \npossibilities, Jim settles on the Dance of the Thrashing Dragon Dharma for his \ncharacter. Seeing Evan’s curious look, Jim explains that while the hedonistic \ntendencies of the other Laughing Rainbows disturb his character, their deep \nconnection to the pulse of life is more important to him than anything else. \nThinking about how he wishes to play the character, Jim selects a Trickster \nDemeanor and a Caregiver Nature. While fun-loving and accessible around \nchildren, his character is actually quite nurturing and caring at heart. To balance \nthis concept, Jim selects the Fool as his P’o Archetype. His Demon is forever trying \nmock his gentle ways and exaggerate the simple goodness ofhis nature into failure. \nFor the last part, Jim consults a name book and selects a good Chinese name for his \ncharacter - \nJo-Loung. Jim is ready to move on to the next step. \nsmrio: \nJim now has to prioritize Jo-Loung’s Attribute categories, to determine his \nbasic strengths and weaknesses. He takes Physical as Jo-Loung’s primary Trait \ncategory, Social as his secondary, and Mental as his tertiary. Jim explains that Jo- \nLoung was a construction worker by day, building the high rises of Hong Kong \n(Physical), and that he has always had a good sense of humor and related well to \npeople (Social), but that sometimes his wit runs ahead of his smarts (Mental). Now \nJim must choose individual Traits for each category, beginning with seven Physical \nTraits. He picks Nimble, Robust, Wiry, Quick, Robust, Enduring and Steady. That \nselection reflects Jo-Loung’s construction background and conjures an image of a \nsturdy worker who’s still pretty quick on his feet when he has to be - \nnot a bad \nthing when you’re 70 stories up! Next is Social, with five Traits, and Jim chooses \nthe Traits Charismatic, Empathetic, Witty, Persuasive and Empathetic, demonstrat- \ning Jo-Loung’s strong sense of humor and his easygoing appeal to others, as well as \nhis natural respect for the feelings of others. Finally comes Mental, with only three \nTraits. Jim selects Clever, Creative and Wily - \nJo-Loung is pretty sharp when it \ncomes to a con or a story, but a bit out of his league when it comes to book-learning \nand perception skills. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nNow Jim has to choose Jo-Loung’s Abilities. He decides that hanging around \nwith the rough-and-tumble lot of construction workers rubbed off on Jo-Loung a \nbit during his life, and he selects the Brawl, Dodge and Athletics Abilities. These \nskills should prove helpful along the Road Back as well. However, he wants to make \nsure that he details Jo-Loung’s sensitive side as well. Jim picks a level of Empathy \nand Medicine, reflecting the care the vampire has taken to learn to mend as well as \ninjure. There are some other Abilities Jim would like Jo-Loung to have, but that’s \nall the levels he gets for now, so Jim makes a note to return to this section during \nthe Free Trait stage and continues. \nDisciplines come next; Jim decides that rather than focusing his powers in one \nparticular area, Jo-Loung has learned a wide variety of powers from his Thrashing \nDragon teachers. With only three levels of Disciplines to use (and at least one of \nwhich must be a Demon Art), Jim examines the choices carefully before selecting \none level of the Flesh Shintai, one level of the Yang Prana Discipline, and for his \nDemon Art he chooses a level of Black Wind. Jim rationalizes the first two choices \nas natural extensions ofhis character’s love of and mastery over the living, dynamic \nform, while the Black Wind is a reminder of the sometimes grim nature of Jo- \nbung’s Road Back. Evan looks the choices over and approves them, liking what \nhe’s seeing develop before him. \nJo-Loung’s has five levels of Backgrounds to spend. Jim selects more mundane \nones first, taking Contacts x 2 (local street urchins who keep him informed) and a \nlevel of AUies (a dedicated child services worker who knows the nature of his quest \nand who often cuts through red tape on his behalf). Looking to add a more exotic \ntwist to his character than the “average Joe” image that started coming across, Jim \nspends the last two levels on the Horoscope Background. Jo-Loung may think his \nquest is humble enough, but certaincelestial powers have taken notice ofhis efforts \nso far, for better or worse. Such a mysterious thread is bound to make for some \ninteresting stories later on. Finally, Jim must assign Jo-Loung’s Chi Virtues (he \nbegins with one Trait in each type automatically). He assigns three Traits to Yang \nand one to Yin, giving him permanent ratings of four Yang Traits and two Yin \nTraits. Once play begins, he will have to be careful if he wishes to avoid \nimbalancing himself with Chi energies, but otherwise, the choice makes perfect \nsense for the lie-driven Jo-bung. Jim is now finished with this stage of character creation. \nJim must now record Jo-Loung’s starting Soul Virtues, Willpower, Dharma \nand beginning Chi Traits. He begins with the Soul Virtues. All Kuei-jin begin play \nwith one Trait of Hun and three P’o Traits, so he indicates these on his sheet. All \nKuei-jinalso beginwith three WillpowerTraits andone DharmaTrait, sohewrites \nthese down dutifully as well. As for his beginning Chi, Jo-Loung starts with a \nnumber of temporary Chi traits equal to his ratings in each Chi Virtue - \nin his \ncase, that is four Yang Traits and two Yin Traits. Not bad, but not excellent either. \nJim also records the effects of his Dharma Strength and Dharma Weakness on his \nsheet at this time. The ability to restore Yang will no doubt prove helpful, but Jim \nwill have to work with Evan to help figure out his beginning vice, since none spring \nto mind for someone like Jo-Loung. He makes a note to record one before play \nbegins and then moves on to the next part of this stage. \nJim now has the option to choose Flaws and Negative Traits for his character. \nLooking over the Negative Traits, he gains an extra Trait by taking Gullible. Jo- \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nLoung is a sucker for a hard-luck story, and he will have to work hard to overcome \nthis weakness if he doesn’t want to get walked all over by the other Kuei-jin. Jim \nthen takes the Flaw: Hatred (Child Abusers), worth threeTraits. Evan pauses at this \npoint, asking Jim to justify a Flaw that might not be encountered often. Jim \nexplains that Jo-Loung has come to realize just how poorly many children in the \nMiddle Kingdom are treated since his Second Breath, and as such, he has \ndeveloped a seething hatred of adults who mistreat children. The Flaw is detrimen- \ntal because, while such individuals typically deserve some justice, Jo-Loung bears \nsuch a strong animosity that it can get in the way of his reason. It may even threaten \nhis Dharma as he indulges in terrible punishments against the offenders he catches. \nEvan feels the threat posed by the Flaw is being properly approached and approves \nit. Finally, Jim selects the Flaw: Phobia (Chustrophobia), worth two Traits. While \nmany Kuei-jin are at least mildly claustrophobic due to their time in the grave, Jo- \nLoung was murdered and left in a small closet with the bodies of his children. \nEntering any such confined area forces him to resist wave soul as he remembers the \nstaring eyes of his dead sons. \nAfter taking one more look, Jim is satisfied by his choice of Flaws and moves \non. The combination of Negative Traits and Flaws has now given him six extra \nTraits to spend on top of the five Free Traits he normally receives, for a grand total \nof 11 Traits. Right away Jim goes back to the Abilitiessection and purchases a level \neach of Streetwise, lntimkfatim and Brawl, rounding out his rough edges a bit and \nmaking him more of a formidable fighter as well. Next Jim spends four Traits to buy \nan extra Discipline, selecting to take a second level of Yang Pram, connecting Jo- \nLoung deeply to the life-force within himself. Jim then spends a Trait each to \npurchase the Traits Friendly, Determined, Tenacious and Expressive - \nthese extra \ntouches add some depth to his personality in play, as well as bolster a few areas of \nhis character that he wasn’t able to cover completely before. Since he hasn’t met \nthe other players of his w yet, Jim makes a note to record his W n x i  ratings toward \nthem as soon as he finally meets them. Jim looks his sheet over, making sure he’s \ngot what he wants, then hands it to even for inspection. After making sure all the \nnumbers add up, Evan approves it, and there’s only one more stage to go. \nS w  tfvt: S P ~ C O F ~ F E  \nAll the game mechanics, Traits, powers and skills are now laid out. Jim has \ndeveloped a much better image of Jo-Loung than when he first started, but these \nare still some things not covered, things that can’t be captured by rules and \ncharacter sheets; specifically, the details that make Jo-Loung live and breathe to \nthe other players. Jim has to think about ways to convey his character’s personality \nto the other players, to create a host of little identifying quirks that come with \nroleplaying him. Does Jo-Loung still wear the stained work clothes of his mortal \ndays, or has the Road Back garbed him in more traditional attire? Is he usually gruff, \nhappy, pleasant or simply indifferent? Does he have a certain smile that comes \nthrough when he’s thinking of a prank, or a habit of snorting instead of laughing? \nDoes he tend to talk with his hands and otherwise exhibit extra levels of nervous \nenergy, or does he sit more passively than his Yang tendencies would indicate? \nThere are countless subtleties that can be added to make a character seem more \nreal, and which make for an entertaining and memorable personality for everyone \nin agame to interact with. More character history also can’t hurt - \nJim has already \ngone beyond a stereotypical Thrashing Dragon hedonist to create an intriguing \npast, but more detail is still possible. Has he actually avenged his children’s murders \nyet, or is he still searching for the parties responsible? Did his sifu approve of his \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nmore mundane interests, or are they now bitterly parted? How does his wu look on \nhis habit of protecting children? Does he have anyone particularly close to him \nnow, or are his “adopted” children his only real friends? What would he do if he saw \nanother Kuei-jin feeding from a child? Or for that matter, what would he do to \nhimself if he awoke from shadow soul to find a drained child’s body next to him? \nExploring all of these questions and more will help Jim further define Jo-bung and \nhis vampiric existence, but for now, Jim is satisfied with the progress he’s made, and \nhe knows that a character is only fully realized once play begins. After he and Evan \nwork out the details of his introduction at the next game session, Jim’s all ready to \nbegin, and Jo-Loung will stride by the sides of his fellow wu members into the \nmysteries of the Middle Kingdom. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\neir return from death, \nand potent supernatu \nthey believe come fro \nheir unique dual soul. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nprepare this devastating move, they spare \nental Traits and \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nwer lasts.

After all, if you’re going for \na mood of contemplation, a chop-socky plot (and characters to match) won’t make \nmuch sense. \nr c  \nThemes are central ideas of a chronicle, ones that help define the shape of the \naction.

In some \ngames, this is just another aspect of the self-generating plots players contrive on \ntheir own. In other games, you may plan the characters’ search for power from the \nbeginning. In either case, you need to learn what long-term goals your players want \nto accomplish in the chronicle. You can then tailor an occasional session to these \ngoals, but don’t give the players everything they want.

Many of the \nprop ideas already suggested can be used to reorient players.

You can then apply thes \nnew stories. Ideally, you, the Narrators and players should all file some sort o \ninformal report after each story.

A change of locale, even if for only one scene, can help \nrevive a dying chronicle. Most locations (or “sets”) can be decorated to convey a \nspecific mood. You must seek out sites that cater to the style of your game and \nnature of its plot. For best results, the setting should have a basis in reality. In other \nwords, if it’s a high-energy social atmosphere you seek, stage your story in a \nnightclub (and find a place with loud music, low lighting and other trappings that \nlend themselves easily to the setting). If you’re looking for a calm and reflective \nsetting, perhaps a clearing by a forest pool (a sparsely decorated area, preferably \nwith lots of natural features and some small body of water) would be best.

The main plot of a story should be all-encompassing, in that all \ncharacters should be affected by it in at least a minor fashion. The main plot should \nilluminate every other aspect of the story.

A story gives players ample opportunities to explore \nsubplots, and due to the unique nature of this sort of game, subplots can be taken \nas far as the players want to take them.

Even if the player knows there is no supernatural accuracy behind such \nreadings, his character is still likely to put some faith in the results. \n4) The Future Is Your Tool, Not Your Burden. When you give out \nprophecies, write them with an eye toward the major plots and themes you have \nin mind for the chronicle as a whole. When you send omens, use them to sharpen \nthe mood you want for the session at hand.

Simply introduce a character \nwho has the tools to help solve the problem, but for a price. \nProlonging play time is a little more tricky than reducing it. Prolonging play \ntime means prolonging the story, but if the story is complete, you have to make up \nnew events in the spot. However, instead of creating an entirely new plot, you \nmight be able to extend the “finished” story by going on past its logical conclusion. \nExtending stories works very well if you have a group of Narrators who are flexible, \ncreative and who like to work “on the run.” If you foresee the story ending early, \nthere are ways ofprolonging it by distracting players. Essentially, you can introduce \nsubplots in order to pull characters off the beaten path. If you have a chance, work \nout one or two subplots for every story. Try not to overuse any particular devices \nfor prolonging a story, or people will get bored, but an ever-new batch of red \nherrings can prove amusing. The best way to slow players down is to present them \nwith something new. Bring in a Big Evil Nasty Thing (B.E.N.T.), or have the local \nhengeyokai threaten, and you can be certain that the linear plot will be set aside \nin the face of the incipient threat. \nOne of the more unusual tricks to use while improvising is to create a \nevents with no obvious explanation. Then listen to the explanations your p \npropose and choose one to be the case, or base your explanation on the theory you \nlike best. While this tactic may seem cheesy, some absolutely amazing stories can \nbe developed this way. \nIn Mind’s Eye Theatre, the Storyteller and Narrators \ncontrol over what occurs in the story. While you can often predi \nto know where a story might lead, things never work out as plann \na tendency to ignore old goals, creating new plot lines without a \nfor your hours of preparation and cunningly laid plans. \nWhile such situations can be disconcerting, it’s not always ab \nplayers to improvise. Unforeseen plot turns are, in fact, what M \nis all about. The trick is to use what the players give you, inste \nthem. If players generate new plots, you can continue them in the next s \nproviding you with new material on which to build. If you let players run with what \nthey come up with, your story may go in entirely unexpected - \nbut rewarding - \ndirections. While the story may go off on a tangent, headed toward no foreseeable \nconclusion, you can usually apply finesse to work things out.

Also, the \ndowntime will allow you to introduce plot elements via email or conversations \nwith players that will serve to prevent recurrences of trouble situations. \nLariw b o w  rm Lavv \nIt’s your responsibility to ensure that players are not a hazard to others, \nincluding people who are not involved in the game. It is mandatory that the normal \nrules of social interaction be strictly adhered to. Most players will probably work \nwith you in this regard. However, from time to time, there are those who prove \ndisruptive to other players and the environment where the game is being played. \nThis disruption often occurs by accident. However, there may be instances when \nplayers get out of hand on purpose. If such a situation presents itself, it’s not \nconsidered bad taste to remove the offender from your game. I t  is, after all, your \ngame and your creation. The integrity of your game should be preserved for the \nenjoyment of other players. The integrity of the game should also be upheld in the \nminds of those who do not play or understand Mind’s Eye Theatre. \nRESOLMW brtqum- \nAs Storyteller (and to a lesser degree as a Narrator), you have final word in any \ndispute that may arise between players.

The novelist Richard Bach \nonce said, “Argue for your limitations, and sure enough, they’re yours.” Do not \nlimit yourself to this set of rules. Your concept of the way Laws ofthe East should \nbe played may change constantly. Bend or break the rules to your liking. The rules \nserve the story; the story does not serve the rules. \nIf you come to a situation that isn’t covered by the rules, don’t panic - \nimprovise. Improvising rules involves nothing more than applying common sense \nto a situation. Don’t be afraid of going against the grain in such cases. Just do what \nmakes the most sense for your story and your characters, and things will work out \nfine. After all, if it comes down to a question of rules versus story, story should win \nevery time. \n6mFX I D E M  \nIf you’ve never run an Eastern story before, \nto develop.

Of'course, many Kuei- \njin in the Fifth Age forget their holy mission to battle the Yama Kings and indulge \ntheir darkest whims, feeling above punishment when it comes to taking whatever \nthey wish from the mortals around them. That means that these lonely hunters are \nmore pressed than ever to keep the Kuei-jin in line. Fortunately, if there are any \nmortals up to the challenge, the Shih are just such warriors. \nFounded by Yi, a Chinese warrior-mage during the Age of Legends, the Shih \nare solitary hunters who are drawn from the ranks of mortals touched by the hand \nof the supernatural at some time in their past. Many are orphans of one kind of shen \nrampage or another, although the mentors who choose new Shih are careful to \ntemper revenge with proper discipline to avoid needless deaths in the field. Shih \ntrain for a minimum of 15 years, during which time they are required to master a \nvariety of subjects ranging from martial arts and weapon combat to occult lore and \ncourtly etiquette. They also learn special techniques to channel their personal Chi \nreserves and otherwise hone their bodies to levels of perfection beyond the dreams \nof most mortals. For their part, the Shih know that while their purpose may be \nS/L€NTK!!YS o-Burur= \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nhonorable under Heaven, it is seldom a welcome intrusion, and therefore, they \nmust be ready for the worst the shen can throw at them. Traveling alone, as is their \nancient custom, only toughens this resolve, since they know the chances of any \nkind of reinforcements arriving are slim at best. When they are finally released from \ntheir master’s side, having studied the shen firsthand and trained exhaustively for \nnearly two decades, the Shih are more than capable opponents for even experi- \nenced supernatural creatures. More than one cocky kyonshi has met Final Death at \nthe hands of one of these nomads after refusing to change his arrogant ways. \nFor their part, most Shih really do try to give shen that they see as out of line \na chance to redeem themselves. While they do not bother to parlay with chih-mei \nand other mindless abominations, Shih often put themselves in a great deal of \ndanger in order to redeem a particular shen before resorting to combat, if they feel \nthere is a even a slight chance of success. Of course, once sentence has been \npronounced, the Shih are grimly efficient in carrying it out, no matter the cost to \nthemselves. Shih are also typically a hardy and pragmatic lot who will go from \nnobly defending apeasant village from a rampaging chih-mei to picking the pockets \nof the dead monster in order to pay for their next meal. They justif, their way of \nlife by the sacred charge they uphold, but they are also worldly enough to realize \nthat generous rewards for their work will be few and far between, and so they do \nwhat they must to survive. Considering that many communities in this day and age \ndo their best to forget about the monsters walking among them, including the \nhunters who vanquish them, the Shih are seldom motivated by a desire for fame \nand praise anyway. Instead, the Shih live and die between the cracks of modem \nsociety in the hopes that their efforts help restore some balance to the grand \nexpanse of Heaven. \nShih discipline offers several tangible benefits to those who choose to adhere \nto its strict training regimen: the Qiao (the Chinese word for “bridge”). Qiao are \nsupernatural powers that help balance the scales between the dread powers of the \nshen and the hunters who dare stalk them. \nQiaOo-lSrmU \nUsing Yang Chi, the Shih may prepare special prayers on silk or paper, which \nthen become capable of hindering and harming demons in various ways. These \nprayers may be prepared hours in advance of their use, and they retain their magic \nfor up to one day. Unless otherwise noted, each prayer requires one Yang Trait and \n15 minutes per level of the Qiao to create. The prayers may be thrown at any target \nthe Shih can see (including invisible foes sensed through various Qiao powers), \nand once thrown, the prayers fly around obstacles-making all but complete cover \nuseless-andotherwisedefy physics toreach their target. Hittingatargetwith the \nprayers still requires a successful Melee Challenge, however. \nNote: Most of these powers must be dodged if the target wishes to avoid their \neffect. In other words, some speed- or agility-related Trait (such as Quick or Agile) \nmust be bid if the target wishes to defend against them. Traits such as Enduring or \nBrawny do not function as a defense against these powers, although of course the \ntarget may choose to attack in response instead of merely defending. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\night \nShihdonot get tochoose Abilitiesduringcharactercreation; \nrather, \nthey receive the following Abilities: Martial Arts x 2, Meke x 2, Dodge x 2, \nOccult x 2 and Suruiuaf. Any additional Abilities desired must be purchased \nwith Free Traits during the Merit/ Flaw portion of character creation. (It is \nhighly recommended that Shih intensify their combat training as much as \npossible. They are on their own, after all, and the shen are the deadliest of \nfoes.) Shih may also begin play with more than two levels of Martial Arts, \ndue to their focused training. Thus, Shih characters start with extremely \nhoned talents, but at a cost to player flexibility. \nShih automatically receive the Background: Mentor x 3. \nAll Shih begin play with one level in each of the following Chi \nPowers: Ruu, of the Mo Kung, Qiao of the 1 Shen and Qiao of the Yu An. \nAdditional levels cost four Free Traits during character creation, and the \nfollowing number of Experience Traits apply once play begins: three for \nBasic Qiao, five for Intermediate and eight for Advanced. \nAs players will no doubt have noticed by now, Shih are extremely \nstrong for beginning characters. That unbalance is due to two factors. First, \nall Shih have spent a great deal of time being trained by masters well-versed \nin the arts of demon-hunting, and (more importantly) Shih characters are \nintended to work alone. Even in a larger troupe, the Shih is expected to carry \nhis own weight, tend his own wounds and otherwise avoid any needless \npersonal entanglements. That life may seem very cool and rugged at first, \nbut loneliness should begin to take its toll as time goes by and the Shih \nrealizes some of the disadvantages of going solo. Of course, Shih aren’t \nfoolish. If taking down a particular shen requires teamwork, they’ll play \nalong, but players who always try to band together like a bunch of kung-fu \nSuper Friends bent on kicking Kuei-jin butt are doing their characters a \ngrave disservice. The Shih have walked their solitary roads for millennia, \nd they see no reason to change their ways now. \nBasic \nCelestial Punishment - \nBy casting these prayers at his target, the Shih may \ncause demons pain and even injure certain shen. Demons suffer extreme agony \n(two-Trait penalty on all challenges for five minutes), but vampires and wraiths \nalso suffer a single aggravated wound. Vampires may attempt to soak this damage \nwith a Physical Challenge, but they still suffer pain. Wraiths mav not soak this \ndamage, although they may repair it with appropriate Arcanoi. \nDivine Bindings - \nDesigned to slow down mighty foes and render weaker \nones entirely helpless, these prayers shine with eerie green light and expand \nrapidly, entrapping the target shen. On a successful hit, the shen is incapable of any \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nphysical action except attempting to break free, and the pain caused by the \nbindings makes using mental powers or Disciplines impossible without the expen- \nditure of a Willpower Trait. Breaking free requires that the shen succeed at three \nStatic Physical Challenges, each difficulty six. Only one attempt may be made per \nturn unless the shen possesses some kind of supernatural speed. This power does not \naffect incorporeal beings. \nIntermediate \nHeavenly Flames - \nUpon hitting their target, these prayers burst into \nsupernatural blue flames, igniting and inflicting aggravated wounds. This power \nmay be soaked with conventional means as well as supernatural ones, but it inflicts \nthree levels of aggravateddamage. Furthermore, the target must win or tie a Simple \nTest every turn to try to extinguish the flames ifhe is wearing anything combustible \n(fur counts). The flames inflict one additional aggravated wound every turn that \nthey continue to bum. \nCelestial Fires -This power is identical to Heavenly Flames, except that the \nfires caused may only be soaked by supernatural means. \nAdvanced \nHeaven’s Thunder - \nThis awesome power seldom leaves a demon standing, \nsince it vents the very wrath of Heaven in one spectacular display. A Shih who uses \nthis power is assured of doing at least some damage to his target, but the cost is \ncorrespondingly high. Thus, this power is used most sparingly by the demon- \nhunters who know it. These prayers blaze from the Shih‘s hand like lightning once \ncast, seeking out the demon she has chosen, and they hit their target automatically. \nNothing less than divine intervention can keep these prayers from their target, \nalthoughcertain Advancedsupernatural powers might be helpful at the Storyteller’s \ndiscretion. (This is the wrath of Heaven, after all.) These prayers inflict a base of \nfour aggravated wound levels, plus an additional aggravated wound for each Simple \nTest the Shih wins against his target. Compare Mental Traits in the event of ties; \nthe first test won by the target ends the challenge. These wounds cannot be soaked, \nbut regardless of the outcome of this power, the Shih suffers one unsoakable wound. \nThis power costs two Yang Traits. This power has been known to fail if the target \nis innocent of the crimes the Shih believes them guilty of, or it may even rebound \non wicked Shih who attempt to destroy shen they know to be blameless. \nQ i u  O-MO KUY~ \nThe Bridge of the Devil Fighter is a very direct path, but one of the most useful \nconsidering how often the Shih come to blows with the shen they are sent to \ncorrect.

By \nspending one Yang Trait, the Shih may gain either one additional Bruised health \nlevel or the Physical Traits: Tough, Resilient, Enduring for the remainder of the \nscene. Each different use of this power may be used only once per scene. \nDragon’s Speed - \nSpeed is of the essence when battling demonic entities, \nand this power grants the Shih steady hands and lightning reflexes. By spending \none Yang Trait, the Shih may either gain a pre-emptive action (a la vampiric \nAlanity) or the Physical Traits: Dexterous, Quick, Nimble for the remainder of the \nscene. Each different use of this power may be used only once per scene. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nTiger’s Strength - \nThrough sheer force of will, the Shih is able to increase \nhis physical strength to match that of the strongest mortal (and many shen). By \nspending one Yang Trait, the Shih gains a free retest on all strength-related \nchallenges and the Physical Traitx &amy x 2 and Wiry for the remainder of the scene. \nCelestial Eyes - \nClearing his mind of all distractions, the Shih may focus his \nsenses to detect minute, even virtually nonexistent phenomena. Spending one \nYang Trait, the Shih gains the Mental Traits: Discerning, Observant, Attentive and \nthe Danger Sense Merit (as his senses catch the tiny warning signs around him). The \nShih also gains a free retest on any Investigation or Enigmas Challenges related to \nsense perception. This power lasts for the remainder of the scene. \nAdvanced \nBody ofthe Dragon-Though \nincredibly draining, this potent power allows \nthe Shih to boost his body’s capabilities to truly superhuman levels for a time. This \npower costs one Willpower Trait and twoYang Traits to activate, but it doubles the \nShih‘s Physical Traits for the remainder of the scene. (Bonus Traits due to other \npowers are added after the doubling is calculated, not before.) The Shih also wins \nall ties in Physical Challenges unless his opponent possesses a similar power, in \nwhich case, the winner is determined normally. Once the scene is over, the Shih \nmust rest for several hours before he can do more than walk a few steps, and the \nbenefits of this power are reversed until such rest takes place. \nQtpo OFTHE Xu Aq \nThe Bndge ofjade Hamny allows a Shih to resist the “mind tricks” of the shen \nand to see them for what they truly are. At higher levels of mastery, it allows the \ndemon-hunter to consult and battle the spirits on their own plane, although such \nmethods are as dangerous as they are potentially rewarding. For uses beyond the \nBasic level, the Unseen Master should be present to play the role of the spirits and \nadjudicate any combats or other interactions. A character must carry jade in some \nform to use this Qiao. \nBasic \nOpened Eyes - \nElegant in its function, this power reveals supernatural \nbeings in their true forms. The Shih can see wraiths, perceive hsien and Kuei-jin \nfor what they are, even detect hengeyokai in their mortal forms. Simply put, any \ncreature that tries to hide its true nature from the Shih is incapable of doing so, and \nthe player may ask any other players out of character what type of supernatural \ncreature they are (if they are one at all). Note, however, that this power does not \nwork against those actively using magic to hide themselves (such as characters \nunder the effects of Shrouded Moon or Unseen Presence) or change their shape. This \npower lasts for one scene, and it also renders the character immune to the Delirium \nduring that time. \nDivine Perceptions -This power allows the Shih to see into a target’s soul, \nusually to determine if they are lying but also to see if they are possessed by demons \nor otherwise under supernatural influence. Detecting lies requires that the Shih‘s \nplayer defeat the target in a Static Mental Challenge (difficulty of the target’s \nMental Traits); success tells the character if the target was indeed lying. The Shih \nmay also detect possession or other supernatural influence by winning an identical \nStatic Mental Challenge. If successful, the Shih‘s player may expend two Mental \nTraits to discern exactly who/ what is responsible for the influence. This power \ncosts one Yang Trait, and it lasts for one scene. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nWind Talk - \nBy attuning himself to the appropriate Chi force, the Shih \ngains the ability to converse with spirits of that type, although they are under no \nparticular compunction to obey him or even hang around if they choose to do \notherwise. The player must spend one Chi Trait of the type of spirits he wishes to \noverhear (Yin for ghosts, Yang for natural spirits) and concentrate for 30 seconds. \nDuring that time, the character hears the voices of the spirits growing louder until \nthey reach a normal conversational level. As soon as that occurs, the character may \nspeak freely with the spirits or simply listen to them as he sees fit. This ability lasts \nfor one scene. \nCelestial Window - \nContinuing on the path of spiritual discourse, the Shih \nmay now attune himself to one spirit, effectively joining its plane of existence. The \nShih may touch, hurt, help or fight the spirit as if both of them were in the same \nplace, and the spirit may return such treatment in kind. This power affects only the \nShih in regards to one spirit. Other spirits may not engage him in the same manner \nunless they possess powers of their own to do so. By the same token, the Shih cannot \nfollow if the spirit flees the character’s presence. This power costs one Chi Trait of \nthe type appropriate to the spirit and lasts for once scene. \nAdvanced \nCelestial Doorway - \nThis grand but often foolhardy power allows the Shih \nto open himself up to interaction with spirits ofboth the Yin and Yang Worlds. The \neffects are the same as those of Celestial Window, but now the Shih may interact \nwith all the spirits in the area from both realms, despite the fact that he remains \non the physical plane of existence. Of course, the spirits may interact with him \nright back, and considering the enmity many of them have toward the Shih, this \npower often results in a swift demise unless the demon-hunter is extremely careful. \nThe doorway requires the expenditure of one Yin Trait and one Yang Trait, and \nit lasts for one scene or until the Shih chooses to close it (which is often very quickly). \nThe Bridge ofthe Phoenix is a simple tool in the Shih‘s employ, but a powerful \nand useful one, for it is the way of healing. With so many foes that deliver so many \nkinds of devastating attacks, the Shih cannot wait for or trust modem medicine to \ncure their many injuries. They rely instead on this Bridge and other natural means \nof healing. It should be noted that by spending Chi, a character is essentially \nexpending her life-force to rebuild her body. It is much easier and more relaxing \nto heal the damage done by spending several Chi Traits than it would be to heal \nthe damage done by a bakemono’s flaming breath. It should also be noted that this \nBridge leaves scars in its wake, which most Shih are very proud of, considering \nthem a mark of their ability to survive. \nQia 0 m - q  \nBasic \nBarriet uf Pain - \nBy spending one Yin Trait, the Shih renders herself immune \nto pain for the remainder of the scene. The character suffers no wound penalties, and \nshe may continue to act normally until she is reduced below Incapacitated. \nTheclosing Wound-Channeling \nYin Chi through her body, the character \nmay repair some of the damage done to her. This power does not function on burns, \nsevered nerves or broken bones, but it will heal all other wounds as well as poisons \nand minor diseases. The Shih must spend one Yin Trait, in order to heal two non- \naggravated health levels. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nSpiritual Healing - \nNow the character is capable of healing even broken \nbones or severed nerves, although bums, acid wounds or damage caused by direct \nenergy/ Chi attacks are still beyond the scope of this power. This ability takes at \nleast five minutes of concentration and rest to use, and costs two Yin Traits. Once \nused, the Shih heals four non-aggravated health levels. At the Narrator’s discre- \ntion, this healing may also remove Lame Negative Traits and other baneful results \nof crippling attacks. \nEscape from Death - \nAll manner of wounds may be healed through use of \nthis power, even bums or the ravages of supernatural foes. This process is efficient \nbut extremely time-consuming - \nrequiring one hour per health level to be healed \n- \nbut even aggravated wounds may be healed by use of this power. The Shih‘s \nplayer must succeed in a Static Mental Challenge against a difficulty of the number \nof health levels she wishes to heal and spend three Y in Traits to activate this power. \nOnce underway, the character must eat enormous amounts of food to replace the \nenergy used in the healing process. If the Shih is disturbed in any serious way \n(combat and other adventuring are straight out), the process ends, and any \nremaining damage remains unhealed. \nAdvanced \nFlames ofthe Phoenix - \nShih with this ability may effectively rebuild their \nbodies on a cellular level, curing the effects of cancer, radiation exposure, severe \ntrauma and even old age. Few of the Shih adept in this knowledge readily attempt \nit, however, for it places an enormous drain on their bodies that can easily kill those \nnot in perfect health and possessed of perfect discipline. The Shihmust spend three \nY in Traits, three Yang Traits and two permanent Willpower Traits to invoke Flames \nof the Phoenix, and she must succeed at a Static Physical Challenge against a \ndifficulty of nine Traits (this challenge may be retested with the Occult Ability). \nFailure means all the listed costs are paid, but nothing happens. Success indicates \nthat the character is rebuilt from the ground up - \ncancer and other ill effects \nvanish, scars fade, fingerprints change, retinal structures alter, bones shift and the \ncharacter may even experience a change in height. In essence, the character is \nrebom into a whole new body. Obviously, the player should adopt some new garb \nor descriptive tag to indicate the change in her character’s appearance, since it is \nnext to impossible for even those closest to her to recognize her for who she truly \nis. F h s  ofthe Phoenix takes one sessiodday of uninterrupted meditation toperform. \nMany Shih delight in presenting an apparently helpless foe to their opponent, \nand then smashing her with a surprise attack or sudden Chi surge. In this respect, \nthe Bridge of the Serpent serves them well, as it makes a Shih even deadlier with his \nbare hands than most foes are when armed to the teeth. \nqiroo-sni \nBasic \nThousand Fists - \nSpending one Yang Trait, the character inflicts additional \ndamage equal to his permanent Martial Arts rating with all successful Martial Arts \nattacks for the duration of one turn. Thus, the Shih is often able to deliver blows \nas devastating as those from a firearm or melee weapon with just a flurry of punches. \nThe character may declare this power’s use at any time before the outcome of a \nchallenge is resolved. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nSpear Hand - \nUsing special focusing techniques, the Shih may set one hand \nafire with blazing Chi en&&. As long as &e Shih attacks with that appendage, all \ndamage dicted is aggravated. This power costs one Yang Trait and lasts for one scene. \nIntermediate \nBumingGhosts- Summoning his Chi around him in ashining golden aura, \nthe Shih becomes capable of striking wraiths and other spirits just as if they were \nEmbodied or Materialized, although they must use such powers themselves if they \nwish to return the favor. This power costs one Yang Trait and one Physical Trait \nto enact, and it lasts for one scene. Note that the Shih‘s body does not actually \nstrike the spirits, the aura surrounding him does. \nSteel M y -  Suffusing his essence with Yin energies, the character tightens \nhis muscles to an inhuman degree, making his flesh like steel. He becomes tougher \nto harm and the blows he inflicts do amazing amounts of damage. This ability costs \ntwo Yin Traits and lasts for one scene, during which time, the Shih gains two \nBruised health levels and inflicts aggravated damage with all Brawl or Martial Arts \nattacks. \nAdvanced \nThousand Swords - \nChanneling a surge of Chi within his body, the Shih \nfocuses inward for a moment before unleashing a vicious flurry of strikes that split \nskin asunder and sound like steel striking against flesh. This ability costs two Yin \nTraits and two Yang Traits to activate, and while in this state, the character \ndelivers aggravated damage with all Martial Arts attacks and gains two additional \nattacks per turn. Once the scene is over, the Shih is exhausted, and he must rest \nfor a considerable amount of time (Storyteller’s decision on how long is needed). \nUntil such rest is attained, the Shih is reduced to no more than one Physical Trait. \nHe also loses all ties on Physical Challenges. \nThe Bndge ofthe Mirror is a vital part of a demon-hunter’s arsenal, as it protects \nher Chi and allows her to manipulate the Chi of her enemies. Since no Shih wants \nto risk being contaminated by such energies, however, many uses of this Bridge \ninvolve a weapon of some kind. Traditionalty, this weapon was an eight-sided \nmetal mirror, but all manner of weapons or other items may be used, especially if \nthey contain jade somewhere on them. \nBasic \nFrozen River -This \nability allows the Shih to defend her life-force against \ntheft by one of the shen. With the expenditure of one Yang Trait, all such attempts \nare three Traits down for the remainder of the scene (including attempts to feed \non the character by such Chi parasites as Kuei-jin). \nStolen Serpent - \nUsing this potent but dangerous technique, the Shih may \nattempt to redirect aranged supernatural attack back at the enemy who cast it. The \nShih must spend a Yang Trait and declare that she is redirecting the attack, then \nengage her foe in the appropriate challenge (the Shih uses her Physical Traits in \nthis challenge, no matter what might normally be required). The Shih may retest \nthis challenge with the Occult Ability. Success means the attack has been \nredirected, and the player may make a Firearms Challenge immediately to attempt \nto strike her foe with the redirected attack. Failure, however, means the Shih \nsuffers the full damage/ effects of the attack, against which no soak possible. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nCelestial Jjarrier - \nThis handy talent allows the Shih to block a shen from \ngaining Chi for a short time, and it’s an ideal way to press the advantage against a \ntired foe. The player must spend a Yang Trait and defeat the shen’s player in a \nWillpower Challenge (noTraits risked). Success means the target is unable to gain \nChi for five minutes, although he may spend any Chi he still has normally. \nClutch of the Wan Kuei - \nBy executing a special strike with her chosen \nweapon, the Shih may attempt to steal some of the target’s Chi, which is then \nabsorbed into the weapon itself. The Shih cannot make use of this stolen Chi, but \nneithercan the target. To use this ability, the player must spend one Yang Trait and \nmake a number of Static Mental Challenges against six Traits; she may continue \nto challenge until she loses. For each successful challenge, one Chi Trait of the \ncharacter’s choice is stolen from the target of her next successful Meke attack. \nAdvanced \nBite of the Mu - \nThis rare technique allows the Shih to steal Chi from her \nopponent and use it in an attack against him. The Shih must first defeat her \nopponent in a number of Mental Challenges (no Traits risked); the Shih may \ncontinue to test until she loses. For each successful challenge, one Chi Trait is \nstolen from her target. With the next successful Melee attack against that target, \nthe Shih may expend the stolen Chi to do additional levels of aggravated damage \non a one-for-one basis. This power is as addictive as it is devastating, though, and \ndemon-hunters who use it on a regular basis risk awakening their Po. The Shih \nmust spend twoYang Traits andsacrifice one Humanity Trait to use this power, and \nit lasts for the duration of the combat. \nQi- \n0- \nb w q  4 ~ 9  \nThe Bridge of the Dragon Rukr was created in response to the many “mind \ntricks” of the shen, and it allows a wily Shih to conquer enemies through \nintimidation and domination rather than raw physical prowess. For obvious \nreasons, it is very popular with older Shih whose bodies have begun to fail them, \nor physically slight Shih who enjoy beating the shen at their own game. \nBasic \nEyes ofthe Dragon - \nAn intimidated opponent is defeated before a single \nblow is struck, and Shih who use this power are capable of stopping many fights \nbefore they begin. The character must stare straight at his foe, spend one Yin Trait \nand defeat his opponent in a Social Challenge. Lesser opponents are cowed and \neven superior foes are taken aback at such ferocity, but the end result is the same. \nThose defeated by this power must count out 15 seconds during which time they \nare effectively stunned and may take no offensive action (though they may defend \nthemselves if need be). The Shih may use this power as a means of Fair Escape in \nsome situations. \nDark Retlection - \nThis ability forces one of the shen to realize the conse- \nquences of his actions, and it is used primarily as a means of reinforcing the justice \nof the Shih on errant supematurals. The Shih must defeat his target in a Mental \nChallenge and spend one Yin Trait to use this power, and those so defeated are two \nTraits down on all aggressive actions for the remainder of the scene as the weight \nof their actions bears down on them. Furthermore, players of characters affected by \nthis power should roleplay out the guilt and uncertainty associated with it to the \nbest of their ability. This power can lead even virtuous characters to spend a tough \nnight searching their own soul. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nHaunted Eyes - \nWith this power, the Shih is able to torment the Hungry \nDead and Restless Dead alike with memories of the time they spent in the Yomi \nWorld. The character must defeat his target with a Mental Challenge and spend \none Yin Trait. Success means the target is flooded with the worst memories of her \nexistence and cannot take any aggressive action for the remainder of the scene, \nalthough this power is immediately nullified if the target is attacked. Kuei-j in who \nfall victim to this ability must test immediately for wave soul as well. Needless to \nsay, no character under the effects of this power is much fun to be around, and those \nwith appropriate derangements (Catatonia, Depression, etc.) will find their de- \nrangements especially active during this time. This punishment is one of the \ngravest of the Shih, reserved for reminding the appropriate shen why they are \nso tormented. \nVoice of the Yama Kings - \nShih may use this ability to command a spirit to \nperform one task. This task must be something the spirit can do, although it need \nnot be something the spirit would normally like to do. Spirits may not be \ncommanded to destroy themselves, though they can be told to attack others. \nAbove all, the command must be simple and direct, and most Shih are very careful \nin choosing how to word their commands, since most spirits will follow only the \nletter and not the intent of the order. The player must spend a Yin Trait and a Yang \nTrait and defeat the spirit in a Social Challenge versus the spirit’s permanent \nWillpower for the command to take hold. Obviously, the Unseen Master should \nbe present to test on behalf of the spirit and to record the letter of the arrangement, \nif necessary. \nAdvanced \nDivine Ordinance - \nBy summoning the righteous wrath of Heaven itself, as \nwell as all the rage felt by fallen Shih and past victims of supernatural exploitation, \nthe Shih may attempt to drive the shen from the area through by inspiring the fear \nof Heaven itself in them. To invoke the Divine Ordinance, the Shih’s player must \nspend two Yang Traits and a Willpower Trait. Once that is done, all those in the \narea, including shen, suffer an effect identical to the Delirium (see Laws of the Wild \np. ZOO). For those of you without Laws of the Wild, assume that all the characters \nin the area flee in terror unless they are extremely strong-willed, and that even \nthose who remain are extremely nervous and cautious when it comes to dealing \nwith the Shih in question. \nQrao 0-M-q \nThe Bridge ofDreams is invaluable to the Shih, for it allows them to heal their \nhurting spirits and cleanse their minds of the taint and anguish that comes with \nhunting demons for a living. This Qiao is largely a matter of roleplaying, and since \nso many rich opportunities for in-depth gaming exist in this Bridge, a Storyteller \nshould be quick to capitalize on them and make sure players realize the emotional \ntoll this power extracts even as it helps purge a character’s soul. \nBasic \nBalance ofthe Spirit - \nWith a successful Mental Challenge, the character \ncan discern a target’s internal Chi flow and detect any imbalances or other Chi \nafflictions. The Shih also learns how to correct such imbalances. Meditation is \noften the answer (one day of uninterrupted meditation corrects one point of Chi \nimbalance), but herbs, chants and other means may also be used. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nFocus ofthe Mind - \nBattling the excesses of the suDernatura1 world takes a \nheavy toll on a Shih‘s resolve, andthis technique allows ier to refresh her mental \nreserves. By reaching a relaxed state and spending one Yang Trait, the Shih may \nmake a Static Mental Challenge with the Meditation Ability against six Traits. \nSuccess means one Willpower Trait is regained. \nIntermediate \nNightmare Exorcism - \nSome Shih turn to vices in order to quell the pain \nof their difficult memories, but Shih using this power take a more direct approach, \nerasing the emotional significance of a problem memory and thus (hopefully) \nremoving the mental scars it causes. The player must make two Static Mental \nChallenges with the Meditation Ability to use this power, the first to detect the \nproblem memory and the second to remove its burden; both these challenges are \nagainst adifficulty of eight Traits. Successfully completing both of these challenges \nand expending a Yang Trait renders the memory harmless, although the character \nmust relive it in vivid detail before it finally leaves her. Obviously, the effects of this \nability are largely a matter of roleplaying, although the Storyteller may rule that \nthis power can be used to reduce the cost of buying off a Flaw such as Nightmares \nor Phobia. A player may even cure a derangement attached to a memory by \nspending a Willpower Trait in addition to the Yang Trait required. \nSelf-Exorcism - \nSometimes a demon is able to get past the strict mental \ndefenses of a Shih and inhabit her body. By invoking a psychic contest with the \ninvading force, this power gives the demon-hunter a second chance to throw off \nsuch a malevolent influence before it inflicts any further harm. The Shih must \nmake a Mental Challenge (no Traits risked) against the demon’s P’o or Rage rating \nand spend two Yang Traits. Success means the demon is cast out, while failure \nmeans the demon holds fast. \nAdvanced \nMental Dominion- With this potent talent, the Shih is able to fully restore \nher Willpower and even weaken her P’o (if it is active). The character must fast \nand meditate uninterrupted for a full week to use this power, during which time, \nshe contemplates the sins she has committed and the necessity of committing those \nsins. Once these preparations are complete, the player must make a Static Mental \nChallenge against nine Traits and spend two Yang Traits and two Yin Traits. If \nsuccessful, all Willpower Traits are regained, and the character’s effective P‘o \nrating is reduced by one. \nQim onmZw Mko \nThe Bmlge of the Resilient Cat allows Shih to focus their Chi for movement and \ndefense. Note: Many uses of these powers permit a character to travel to exotic \nlocales or otherwise make movements that aren’t quite normal. In most cases, a \ntime-out should be called as characters move to new positions, and players should \nnever forget the rules governing Mind’s Eye Theatre when it comes to where they \nwish to stand (or how they plan on getting there). \nBasic \nCloud Walking - \nBy spending one Yang Trait and attuning himself to the \nwinds, the Shih is able to move just slightly above the ground. This method of \ntravel leaves no tracks or scent to mark his passing, and allows the Shih to travel \nin complete silence. All attempts to track him incur a three-Trait penalty at least, \nand his silent movement might even grant him surprise or Fair Escape in combat \nunder the right circumstances. This power lasts for one scene. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nWater Treading - \nUsing this versatile power, the Shih is capable of treading \neasily on unstable surfaces such as water, fog or quicksand and climbing any surface, \neven just the leaves of a tree. After spending aYang Trait, the character may travel \nat a normal rate of movement across any unstable surface, and he can climb any \nsurface without penalty. This power lasts for one scene, although successful attacks \nor other blatant distractions cancel this ability. \nIntermediate \nWind Strike - \nCombining basic martial arts techniques with an extra boost \nof Chi energy, the Shih can use an attacker’s own momentum to throw her \nincredible distances. The player must declare that he is throwing his opponent \nwith a Martial Arts challenge and spend a Yang Trait. Success means that he may \nthrow his opponent up to 75 feet away, inflicting two health levels of bashing \ndamage on top of the regular damage of the throw. A time-out should be called \nwhile the target travels to her new position. \nMountain Stance - \nRedirecting the force of incoming attacks into the \nground itself, the Shih is able to avoid immense amount of punishment as long as \nthe floor holds out. The player must make a Static Physical Challenge and spend \none Yang Trait. Success means that all incoming health levels of damage from one \nattack are redirected into the ground at the character’s feet. This tactic is normally \nsafe, although performing this technique on wooden surfaces or loose soil can have \nunpleasant effects when it collapses beneath the character’s feet. A Narrator \nshould be consulted if a question as to the amount of punishment a particular area \nof ground can take arises. \nAdvanced \nCelestial Wind - \nWith this incredible ability, the Shih is able to rob one \nincoming object - \nattacker, speeding car, bullet - \nof its momentum and perhaps \neven send it back the way it came. The player must spend one Yang Trait and \nsucceed at a Static Mental Challenge against six Traits. Success means the object \nis halted immediately and the Shih takes no damage (if any was to be inflicted). \nWith the expenditure of two Mental Traits, the Shih may even send the object \nback at the same speed it was approaching, inflicting a minimum of two health \nlevels of damage if it should strike something behind it. Due to the bizarre physics \ninvolved in this power, players may want a Narrator to be present to sort out what \nobjects are flying which way and what effect that has. \n& W M h M i j Q U E S  \nM o  % Kuwq \n(DW~ju~qwryr) \nBeyond simple uses of the Martial Arts Ability, the Shih have developed \nseveral potent techniques in order to disarm and disable their shenopponents. Each \nbeginning Shih character may select one of these techniques, and an additional \none is earned for each level of Martial Arts beyond those they begin with. A list of \nthese techniques and their special benefits/ drawbacks follows, along with the \nnecessary Chi cost (if any). Also listed with each technique is the number of Traits \ndown a character attempting the maneuver is considered to be. This penalty occurs \nin order to simulate the difficulty of the move in question, since the most potent \ntechniques are also the most difficult to execute. \nThese are but the most common and well-known techniques. Storytellers \nshould feel free to come up with more as they see fit, although players must still \nreceive Storyteller permission before purchasing a particular special technique. \nWhen creating such maneuvers, remember that they stem from the experience the \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nShih have accumulated fighting the shen over the centuries; they are not just tools \nto give players an unbeatable edge. The Faerie Crushing Fists technique may sound \ngood, but if all it does is allow Shih to pound unopposed on the hsien in the \nchronicle, it’s probably not a good idea to allow it. Always use game balance as the \nultimate guideline. If any or all of these special techniques threaten to upset the \ngame too much, remove them. (The Shih are quite strong enough without them, \nafter all!) \nSnout Strike - \nThe shapeshifting hengeyokai all have a particular weak \nspot, typically in the nose area, where many nerve ganglia are focused in one spot. \nTargeting that spot and executing a successful strike, the Shih can place the target \nin a great deal of pain, thus distracting him and keeping him off-balance. The Shih \nmust declare this technique and make asuccessful attack. Not only does the target \nsuffer the normal damage, but the intense pain puts him down two Traits for the \nnext three combat turns as well. The only downside is that excessive use of this \ntechnique may cause the target to frenzy, at which point the benefit of the \ntechnique is lost. \nTraits Down: 2 \nChi Breaker - \nThis move, used almost exclusively against the Kuei-jin, \nallows the Shih to disrupt the natural Chi flow in his target. The Shih must declare \nthat he is using the technique, spend a Y in Trait and then strike his target. He need \nnot cause any damage (though often he chooses to); he needs only touch the \nvampire to be affected. If successful, the Shih‘s player may spend a variable number \nof Mental Traits. The Kuei-jin cannot spend any Chi Traits for as many turns as \nthe number of Mental Traits spent. This technique has saved more than one \ndemon-hunter from certain death, as their undead foe retreated to regroup or lost \ntheir winning edge at a crucial moment. This attack inflicts normal damage in \naddition to its disruptive benefits. \nTraits Down: 2 \nJaw Hammer - \nMany shen use their teeth as weapons, and this technique is \ndesigned to remove just such an attack from the shen’s arsenal. It is dangerous at \nbest, however. By doing so, the Shih leaves himself open to retribution the next \nturn, so most get it right on the first try. The Shih must declare the technique and \nstrike his foe precisely right. Not only must he score a successful hit, but he must \nwin an additional Simple Test to actually break the jaw correctly. Failure on the \nSimple Test means the target may still bite normally, albeit at a one-Trait penalty \ndue to the odd alignment of its teeth. Success means the target may not use biting \nattacks until the damage is fully regenerated. If the Shih fails on the initial attack, \nhe cannot use the Dodge Ability the next turn - \nhis positioning makes him too \nvulnerable to his opponent. This attack inflicts the standard amount of damage, \nwhether the jaw is actually broken or not. \nTraits Down: 2 \nFading Light Strike - \nThe Shih must use a long weapon such as a sword or \nstaff for this technique. Simple hand-to-hand combat will not suffice, as the risk \nof infection by dark energy is too great. This potent technique allows the Shih to \nsteal the energies of his target and use those forces against her - \nChi is taken from \nKuei-jin, while Rage is taken from hengeyokai, and so on. This attack does not \ninflict any physical damage, but the metaphysical effects can be devastating. The \nShih essentially removes one Trait of the appropriate energy from his target for \nevery level of damage he would inflict normally with the weapon. Thus, if the Shih \nstrikes a Kuei-jin with this technique while using a sword that typically inflicts \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nthree levels of damage, three Chi Traits are removed instead. Note that Shih \nhimself cannot use the energy, but at least his foe can’t either! This technique \nrequires an exceptional knowledge of the target to be successful: The Shih must \npossess at least three levels each of Medicine and Occult to perform this maneuver, \nand each effort costs the Shih himself one Yang Trait. \nTraits Down: 3 \nhe/Cripple Fighting - \nMany older Shih disguise themselves as crippled, \nwizened beggars, and even the best of hunters occasionally finds himself knocked \non his butt or otherwise fighting from a bad spot. Shih with this training can spend \na Willpower Trait to ignore any penalties arising from such inauspicious circum- \nstances for the remainder of the scene, allowing them to ignore their apparent \ndisadvantage. While they cannot ignore wound penalties or such severe flaws as \nblindness or multiple missing limbs, they may fight normally from prone positions \nand ignore any hm, \nDecrepit or similar Negative Traits they might possess. Such \nis the origin of legends of one-armed or one-legged Shih who still somehow manage \nto defeat scores of Kuei-jin in a single melee. Such tales may still be a bit \nexaggerated, but trained warriors can learn to overcome amazing flaws if the need \nis great. \nStealing Eagle Wings - \nVery few Shih are skilled enough to pull this \ntechnique off, but those that are can be counted among the most frightening and \neffective demon-hunters in the Middle Kingdom. Using an instinctive grasp of \npressure holds and lightning-fast reflexes, the Shih may grab hold of ashen who is \nunleashing a burst of supernatural speed and essentially ride the enemy’s own \nmomentum, allowing the Shih to keep up with his opponent step for blazing step. \nA Shih must have at least five levels of Martial Arts and four levels of Akrmess to \nperform this technique, and he must have scored a successful grappling strike \nagainst his opponent on the turn in question. If his opponent then chooses to use \nextra actions that turn (Blackwind, Rage, Celerity, etc.), the Shih may respond by \nspending a Yang Trait to activate this technique. Essentially, the Shih is then \nconsidered to gain an equal number of extra actions in response, povlded he \ncontinuestoholdontohistargetanddoesn’tattackanyoneelse. Inotherwords, theshih \nmay not only continue to try to injure his opponent during the course of the extra \nactions, but he receives a one-Trait bonus for every extra action he “steals” in this \nfashion. Normally, characters without extra actions can only soak the attacks - \nthey can’t dodge or harm the attacker. Thus, if a Shih with this technique grabs \nhold of a hengeyokai and it spends three Rage Traits for extra actions that turn, the \nShih receives a one-Trait bonus on the first action, two Traits on the second, and \nso on as he turns his opponent’s movements against him. Smart opponents will \nattempt to disentangle themselves completely from the Shih, thus negating this \ntechnique, but few are thinking that clearly at the time. They only know that the \nfaster they move, the more control the Shih seems to have over them! \nTraits Down: None. Using this technique is considered a reflexive response, \nnot an action. \nWhile the Shih try to maintain the purity of purpose that Heaven intended \nfor the shen, there are others who see the supernatural as without place in this or \nany other world, and who do their best to ensure that the Unseen World is burned \naway wherever they can find it. Strike Force Zero is just such an organization, \ndedicated to ridding the world of the supernatural menace that has perpetrated a \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\ncampaign of terror and genocide since the beginning of recorded history. Where \nthe Shih use long hours of training and meditation to even the odds between \nthemselves and the shen, Strike Force Zero takes a speedier route. Agents are \nmodified with cutting-edge technology, using bionic implants and other artificial \nenhancements to create deceptively ordinary-looking humans who can actually \npunch through walls, send radio transmissions with a thought or hide a plasma \ncannon in their forearm. While their methods are often quite brutal and their \nattrition rate shockingly high, Strike Force Zero never lacks for recruits in these \ndesperate days. Once their eyes are opened to the hidden world of the shen and their \nvarious evils, few mortals can turn down the duty of riddq the world of such monsters. \nConceived of and headed by Geichin Okamoto, a former Japanese secret \nagent whose family had a long tradition of ninja warfare, Strike Force Zero is an \nultra-secret agency within the Japanese government. It deals primarily with the \ngaki and other native shen of that nation, although its operatives are granted \nfrequent special permission to travel abroad through backroom deals with neigh- \nboring nations (usually in exchange for ridding the host country of a “little \nproblem” or two). In exchange for agreeing to sever all ties to their previous lives, \nsign on for a lengthy and intensive term of service and undergo surgery to alter their \nappearance and identifying marks, prospective SFO agents are offered a chance to \nenjoy biotechnology “upgrades” decades ahead of what is known in the public \nsector. In fact, at least a few such upgrades are required by the agency, in order to \nensure that the operative has at least a fighting chance against the fearsome \nopponents the organization does battle with every day. The main problem with \nStrike Force Zero is that its intelligence is frequently riddled with hearsay and \ninaccuracy, with results ranging from slight misconceptions about a particular \ntarget to deadly gaps in the team’s knowledge. While the Shih have studied the \nshen and their weaknesses for thousands of years, Strike Force Zero is only a little \nover half acentury old and thus struggling mightily to learn more about its enemies. \nAgents are even encouraged to bring back targets alive for vivisection, if possible! \nThe agency is also handicapped by the fact that it is secretly being manipulated by \nvarious factions of the Japanese shen, usually to silence a rival or advance some \nother shadowy goal. \nNevertheless, Strike Force Zero agents themselves are far from helpless. Aside \nfrom their own personal biological enhancements, they are also given a carte \nblanche when it comes to weapons, supplies and other mundane expenses, as well \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nas a proverbial “license to kill” as long as they keep such “sanctions” appropriately \ndiscreet. The only thing the agency hates worse than the shen is the possibility of \nbeing discovered by the world at large, and the agency will not hesitate to take any \nmeasures necessary to preserve its secrecy, including cutting off its own agents if \ntheir actions become too public. Zero teams are never less than five members, each \nwirh a particular area of expertise - \nassassin, bombardier, cyber-rat, pilot and \nsnoop. The teams are typically close-knit and extremely loyal, (since they know \nthat the slightest hesitation in the field might cost one or all of them their lives), \nand agents train extensively together to hone their reactions to peak efficiency. \nSince Zero agents are taken away from their former lives, the team usually \nfunctions as a surrogate family of sorts as well, making for even closer bonds and \na more personal stake in the greater cause against the shen. Though it may cost \nthem their lives, Strike Force Zero agents are prepared to uncover and destroy the \nshen menace wherever it may be found. Faced with such ruthless determination, \nmany Kuei-jin elders are growing more and more concerned about this renegade \nagency and its lethal combination of cold zeal and high technology. \nJw \nHllmy-fWm \nThe following is a list of the enhancements that can be added at a cost of one \nlevel of the Arsenal Background each. Remember that each SFO agent begins play \nwith at least two of these enhancements already, and they all may purchase more. \nEmotion Suppressers -This enhancement releases powerful chemicals into \nthe agent’s bloodstream during moments of terror, effectively rendering the \ncharacter immune to panicking and to effects such as the Delirium, the Veil, the \nMists and so on. Essentially, the agent is distantly aware of the fact that he should \nbe terrified, but he remains able to act normally. Note that the memories of these \nevents aren’t removed either. Thus, many SFO agents suffer from chronic night- \nmares after their encounters with the shen. This device costs one Yang Chi per day. \nGills - \nPlaced at strategic points throughout a character’s body, these filters \nextract and store oxygen for use during underwater operations or in hostile \nenvironments. The agent becomes immune to most toxic gases simply by holding \nher breath. A Yang Trait is required every time the character must rely on her gills \nfor an extended period of time (more than a minute). \nNight Eyes - \nThese mechanical eyes allow the character to function at no \npenalty in complete darkness. There is no cost for using night eyes, although \nsudden bright lights may blind the character for a turn before the eyes adjust \n(Storyteller’s discretion). \nVideo Eyes - \nThis device allows the character to record up to one hour of \ncolor sound and video. Retrieval of the data requires removal of the eye, which in \nturn requires surgery - \nquick and painless work, but surgery nonetheless. Video \neyes cost one Yang Trait every time they’re used. A character with this enhance- \nment can ask those whose actions he’s recorded to “replay” their actions for him \nout of character to simulate what the video eye “witnessed.” \nSpy Eyes - \nEssentially a detachable camera, spy eyes are equipped with six \ntiny legs for motion, and they can be left by an agent in a location to observe events \ntaking place there. Thus, the character may observe any events his eye is \nwimessing. During the time the eye is detached, however, the character develops \na nasty case of double vision if attempting other actions. He incurs a two-Trait \npenalty to combat and other involved activities as long as the spy eye is active. The \nspy eye costs one Yang Trait to use, and must be sterilized before it is replaced in \nthe socket. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nDespite the title, limb replacements seldom involve entire limbs being \nremoved. Rather, they involve a significant portion of the limb being replaced due \nto injury or agency need. It is important to note that while Strike Force Zero \ndoctors are capable of placing most of these enhancements in any limb the patient \ndesires, doing so may inhibit the proper usage of the enhancement in question in \nsome cases. A pulse cannon in your leg may make an excellent weapon of \ndesperation, but it’s quite awkward to aim under normal circumstances (to say the \nleast). Storytellers should feel free to impose penalties on characters whose \nenhancements are located in difficult or inconvenient places for the task at hand. \nFurthermore, each related enhancement has several security features to \nensure that the agent doesn’t accidentally shoot his foot off with a plasma cannon \nor release his cyberclaws while picking his nose (ouch). An agent must concentrate \non the enhancement as well as speak, loudly and clearly, a command phrase before \nthe enhancement will activate. Naturally, the phrase should be something fairly \nexotic if one wishes to avoid accidentally discharging a taser in public. For \nexample, phrases like “Hello” and “Fine, thank you” are notably poor choices, \nwhile “Burning Plasma Cannon!” and “Six4troke Slashing Claws!” are more \nappropriate. The doctors say these measures are all necessary for security reasons, \nalthough many agents think privately that the experts are just pulling a prank on \nthem or even that they are overeager fans of anirne. Needless to say, such command \nphrases can make for some difficulty in stealth situations. Then again, it’s pretty \nhard to muffle the report of a pulse cannon, anyway. \npulse Cannons - \nThese weapons are reliable and lethal, storing bioenergy \nand delivering it in a lethal bolt of radiation designed to disrupt the bioelectrical \nfield of anything it strikes. Firing a pulse cannon is treated the same as any other \nFiream Challenge. Pulse cannons give three bonus traits, have the Negative \nTrait: Loud and deliver three levels of lethal damage on a successful hit. Pulse \ncannons cost two Yin Traits with each use, making them weapons of last resort \nindeed. Even with their high cost, however, pulse cannons are preferred over tasers \nby most SFO agents. While the cannons may not do as much serious damage, tasers \nrequire an agent to get in close with their target, and all but the most green recruits \nknow that close combat with the shen is a quick ticket to suicide. \nTasers - \nThese microfine wire implants only work in close combat with a \ntarget. Actual contact isn’t necessary, but the target can be no further away than \nnormal melee range. They are used almost exclusively against shen, as the charge \ndelivered (500 volts at 100 amps, roughly enough to quick-fry a bull elephant) will \nkill almost any human target. Tasers give two bonus Traits and have the Negative \nTrait: Short. A successful use of the tasers inflicts three health levels of aggravated \ndamage on the target. In addition, the Narrator is encouraged to rule that normal \nmortals - \nnot player characters or critical villains! -are simply killed outright by \nthe intense electricity. Each use of the taser requires one Yin Trait, and characters \nwhomisswith the taserstrikemust immediatelywinor tieaSimpleTest (retestable \nwith the Brawl or Martial Arts Ability) or suffer the taser’s damage themselves. \nNote: Kuei-jin and other undead suffer only lethal damage from this weapon, \nsince they do not require their internal organs to survive. Wraiths suffer no damage \nat all from tasers. \nRejuvenators - \nThis brilliant piece of wetware is a small army of nanites \ndedicated to rebuilding a character after he has suffered grievous bodily harm. It \ncan perform all manner of medical miracles, from reknitting nerves and bones to \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\ndraining punctured lungs and restarting wounded organs. Each health level \nrepaired costs one Yang Trait, and the limitation on how much Yang Chi can be \nspent still applies. A character with four Courage Traits can heal up to four health \nlevels, and no more. \nNote: Using the nanites requires no conscious action on the character’s part; \nthey ready themselves automatically when the character is injured. More than one \nunconscious Zero agent has been saved from bleeding to death (or asimilarly nasty \nfate) by the intervention of this wetware. \nSheath - \nThese enhancements are simply cleverly designed “pockets” built \ninto an agent’s arm or leg, which can be used to hide all manner of items that would \notherwise be confiscated on sight. Many agents have sheaths installed to hide \nstriker guns, though such sheaths must be placed in the leg due to the size of the \nweapon. The sheaths even shield the pocket from x-rays and metal detectors, and \nthey are completely invisible and undetectable when closed. Opening the sheath \ndoes not count as an action, although reaching for something inside might depend \non where the sheath is located. Sheaths cost nothing to use, although shielding \nthem from electronic detection costs one Yang Trait per scene. \nCyberclaws - \nIdeal close-combat weapons, cyberclaws extend a full eight \ninches from the body. The ankles, wrists, elbows and knees are favorite places to \ninstall these claws. Cyberclaws give their wielder two bonus Traits during combat, \ncannot be disarmed and possess the Negative Trait: Short. Extending the claws \ncosts one Yin Trait, and doing so enables the wielder to inflict lethal damage in \nhand-to-hand combat instead of the usual bashing damage. \nPsi-Band Radio - \nThis favorite piece of wetware allows a Zero team to \ncommunicate silently up to one mile apart. The communicator itself runs from the \nleft ear to the left side of the jaw, and it is activated by touching a spot on the jaw. \nDespite the name, no psionic talent is involved, although at the Narrator’s \ndiscretion certain beings with the Telepathy Numina or similar powers may \nsometimes detect the use of psi-band radios nearby. There is no Chi cost to use psi- \nband radio. In game terms, all team members using the radio are allowed to \ncommunicate privately any time their radio is active (even telepaths cannot \nactually “overhear” the conversations, only detect their presence). These messages \ncannot be intercepted by any known means. Players in particularly large playing \nareas may wish to carry actual walkie-talkies or other devices in order to facilitate \ngame-play, rather than constantly employing Narrators or stopping play to ferry \nmessages back and forth. \nSnake Fangs - \nThis term is actually something of a misnomer. Snake fangs \nare implants in the agent’s palm which allow them to deliver poisons via tiny air \nguns during melee combat. To use the snake fangs, a character must strike his \nopponent successfully with his fists and spend one Yin Trait. The target must then \nmake a Static Physical Challenge against adifficulty based on the intended severity \nand effect of the poison the agent is using. The fast-acting, nonlethal neurotoxins \nmost agents use are difficulty six, while stronger or more lethal substances would \nhave accordinglyhigher difficulties to resist. In order to smooth game-play later on, \nplayers should approach their Storytellers before the session and tell them what \npoison their character is using, then write down on an item card the difficulty to \nresist its effects and/ or any damage it may cause to the target. As an added bonus, \nthe snake fangs release an antidote into the character’s bloodstream if he acciden- \ntally injects himself. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nEnhancers - \nThese devices are cybernetic limbs designed to mimic regular \nlimbs, but with an added bonus or two. Such limbs have no pulse, they are a few \ndegrees cooler than the rest of the body, and they cannot recognize the same depth \nof sensation they once did, but they offer great strength in exchange. Upon the use \nof the proper code phrase, the agent is three Traits up on all strength-related tests \nwith that limb (including relevant combat tests) and he inflicts an extra level of \nlethal damage (or two levels of bashing) on attacks made with that limb. At the \nNarrator’s discretion, the agent may also use his strength to punch or kick through \nwalls and other obstacles, but players should remember that the tissue surrounding \nthe limbs is not enhanced. Lifting half a ton certainly might be possible with an \nenhanced arm, but only at the cost of tearing every single related natural muscle \nwith the effort! For that reason, enhancers are typically usedonly for attacking and \nbattering down objects. Characters who attempt other feats with them may suffer \ndamage and other consequences. \nVibroblades - \nThese razor-sharp, microfine blades are capable of cutting \nthrough nearly anything with very little effort. They’re excellent for turning foes \nto jerky strips in short order, but also an easy way for a careless agent to wind up \nmissing a limb or two as well. Agents facing superior martial artists are also likely \nin a great deal of trouble. Vibroblades work so quickly and cut so deeply the target \ndoesn’t actually feel pain until several seconds later. That is, all wound penalties \ninflicted by vibroblades (excluding Incapacitated and beyond) are delayed until \nthe turn after they should take effect. Vibroblades give two Bonus Traits, have the \nNegative Trait: Awkward (to avoid cutting oneself) and inflict two health levels \nof lethal damage. \nGrenade Launchers - \nAn agent can have a grenade launcher installed \ndirectly into his body. The type of grenade fired varies by preference, although each \nlauncher is fitted for a single type at creation. Using other types requires the agent \nto make a Simple Test before firing. On a loss, the launcher jams, and it must be \nunjammed with the Firearms Ability. Otherwise, the launcher’s statistics are as \nfollows: two Bonus Traits, the Negative Trait: Awkward and damage/ effect \naccording to grenade type. The limb used also must be straightened completely \nbefore firing, in order to ensure a straight launch. The grenade may be fired or \nthrown, according to the agent’s preference. When it comes to damaging a large \ngroup (as with incendiary grenades), treat the test the same as the special weapon \nability: Spay. (See the combat section, p. XX, on how this ability is handled.) \nSome grenades, particularly smokers and flash-bangs, may also require a Narrator \nto describe the events in the area to characters involved. \nInternal Tracking Gear - \nThis revolutionary bit of technology allows an \nagent to track a target effectively even after being blinded, deafened or dazzled, \ncontrolling the agent’s reflexes and motor centers to keep the agent’s hand locked \nonto the target. Even if not impaired, the ITG helps improve the agent’s reflexes, \nbettering her aim. As long as the agent’s body chemistry indicates a combat \nsituation, the ITG continues to track a target. The character may ignore the \npenalties of blindness or deafness for the purposes of attacking her target, and if not \nimpaired, the ITG puts the agent one Trait up on all Fireawns and Meke tests \nagainst a tracked target. Activating the ITG costs one Yang Trait. \nWeb Spinners - \nNozzles in the character’s fingers are designed to emit a \nstream of fast-drying, steel-hard paste which can be used either as a short-range \nrestraint or a long-range snare according to the agent’s desires. In close range, treat \nthe web foam the same as the effects of a steel form grenade, except only a single \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\ntarget can be affected. The foam has only six health levels and the difficulty to \nescape is 10 Traits. The web glue can be dissolved only by a special chemical \ncompound contained in the agent’s pinkie finger. Activation costs one Yin Chi, \nand the effective range is 10 paces. \nField Armor - \nThe rare Series IV Portable Analysis and Assault Station (or \n“field armor,” as agents insist on calling it) is a custom-designed suit of armor \nequipped with state-of-the-art sensor arrays, a communications linkup that allows \nfor mental activation of the suit’s functions and strength-enhancing gloves and \nboots. The sensors onboard allow an agent to analyze fingerprints, fiber samples, \nblood samples and genetic information discovered at the scene. A modem hookup \nallows for secure communication with SFO headquarters, a wide band radio scans \nlocal communications, and the suit contains visual and auditory enhancements for \ndiscerning additional information (agents effectively gain Sharpened Senses while \nthose systems are employed). The armor counts as a ballistic vest for purposes of \nabsorbing damage. Finally, the physical enhancers in the gloves and boots add an \nadditional level of damage in close combat. Each suit is crafted for a specific agent \n(including space for an agent’s own bionic enhancements), and it will not function \nfor anyone else. These suits are still being refined - \ndamage can easily upset the \nsuit’s delicate sensors at this stage of development. Most SFO agents don’t even \nthose know these suits exist, much less have a chance of being issued one. This \nenhancement cannot be selected without Storyteller approval. The suit costs no \nChi to use unless the wearer activates the enhancers in the gloves and boots -such \nusage costs one Yin Trait. \nKeypads - \nThese built-in bits of cyberware give the user access to secured \nsystems, allowing the character to analyze and bypass both computer systems as \nwell as physical or electronic defenses. Descramblers wired into the equipment are \ncapable of cracking most known codes easily, as well as adding new codes as they \ncrack the old. Keypads are implanted into a user’s hands, and they are always \nworking. Characters with this enhancement receive a free retest on all Security and \nComputer tests related to defeating a target’s defenses. Keypads cost one Yin Chi \nper day, but only if in “active mode”; otherwise, power-drain is minimal. \nKabuki Masks - \nThis enhancement allows a character to alter such subtle \nbut important factors as the length and width of their nose, the shape of their eyes, \nthe height of their cheekbones and even the length of their jawline in order to \ncreate a different appearance. Increasing or decreasing skin tension can even \nsimulate a different age, and manipulating the vocal chords can create a different \nvoice. The modifications are not complete enough to allow the agent to imperson- \nate someone else (unless they just happen to look a lot like their target already), \nbut may be used to blur the agent’s identity so that they are unrecognizable to those \nwho are looking for them. The change costs one Yang Trait, takes several (painful) \nminutes of adjustment and lasts until the agent decides to take on another face or \nresume her old appearance. Players using this advantage should adopt a posture or \nuse a description card to show their altered appearance. Since the change is an \nactual physical process, this disguise cannot be seen through by Heightened Senses \nor other powers, although the agent may still give herself away in other ways if not careful. \nb o D W O W ~ E u ( t  SnYK!! \n(iUW \nStriker Pistol - \nThe signature weapon of SFO, striker guns are built like \nnormal heavy pistols, but they are lighter, stronger and specially designed to \nfunction only for the agent to whom they’re issued. A small sensor in the grip \nresponds to special sensors implanted in the agent’s hands; without such confirma- \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\ntion, the pistol locks up and will not fire. This recognition system is also a safety \nfeature, since the gun will not activate for a possessed agent, thus alerting team \nmembers to trouble in their midst. \nBonus Traits: 2 \nNegative Traits: Loud \nConcealability: Jacket \nDamage: Two health levels \nAvailability: Strike Force Zero agents only; no exceptions. (SFO is very \nprompt to reclaim any striker guns stolen or “lost” during service, no matter what \nthe cost.) \nSpecial Ability: Custom-Fitted: Each striker pistol is attuned to its owner, and \nit will not fire for anyone else. The same is true if the owner is possessed by spirits, \nbut not if the character is under mind control or similar domination. Unique \nAmmunition: Striker guns can use several different types of exotic ammunition \nwith varying special benefits. Some of the most common types used are listed here. \nEach agent receives four clips ofstandard-issue ammo and one clip ofeachspecialty \ntype (color-coded for ease of reference). Further rounds must be procured through \nthe standard agency channels. \nStandard-Issue: These rounds are normal bullets that give the striker gun \nthe special ability: High-Caliber. \nSilver bullets: These rounds are treated as normal rounds, but they can cause \naggravated wounds on certain targets, as well as conferring the benefit: High- \nCaliber. \nSounders: These rounds emit a high-pitched whine inaudible to humans, \nbut which causes discomfort and disorientation in hengeyokai, Kuei-jin, Kin-jin \nwith Heightened Senses and other sensitive types. A vulnerable target becomes two \nTraits down for the rest of the scene due to distraction, and other such beings \nwithin losteps ofthe target mustwinaSimpleTest or suffer asimilardisadvantage. \nSounders inflict no other damage. \nTrackerbullets: Tracker rounds do not receive the High-Caliber benefit, but \nthey not only inflict damage on a successful hit, but they inject a tiny intramuscular \ntracking device as well. This device allows a target to be tracked up to 100 miles \naway, and it is impossible to detect by normal means. It is otherwise quite harmless, \nand it will be ignored by the body’s immune system. Kuei-jin bodies, however, \nreject the device after 24 hours. \nEctoplasmic Disrupters: These bizarre rounds track the electromagnetic \nsignatures given off by wraiths and explode in a pulse of energy designed to disrupt \nthe wraith’s form. A successful hit from an ectoplasmic disrupter inflicts two levels \nof damage to a wraith‘s Corpus. Living beings are unharmed by disrupter rounds. \nRubberbullets: These rounds are treated exactly like normal rounds, except \nthey inflict bashing damage instead of lethal. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nsacr;Gqo UYM \n~SHIIK(SnUK!! F!waw 1 \nThe following are new Background Traits available only to Shih and SFO \ncharacters. They may be purchased normally during character creation (except \nwhere noted), and some will likely change quite a bit during play. \nStrike Force Zero agents can access wetware and other technology beyond the \nwildest dreams of contemporary scientists and technicians, allowing them to \nenhance their physical prowess, cognitive abilities and even alter their body \nstructure in outstanding ways. Every SFO agent begins with two such implants \nautomatically, and many opt for at least one or two more, although few agents have \nmore than three levels of this Background- the cost to them and their personality \nis just too steep after that. However, few agents debate their worth out in the field. \nEach level of this Background allows for the character to select an additional \nimplant. It is rare for agents to request new implants once play begins, since surgical \nrecovery times are high, and the Storyteller is well within her rights to ask a \nsubstantial amount of downtime be required for those characters who undergosuch \nsurgery. \nBackers \nAll SFO characters have this Background. It allows the character to gather \nresources to pay bribes, purchase weapons, extract herself from political trouble \nand otherwise grease the wheels of everyday life. Please note that this Background \nis not an instant cure-all, however. It may take quite a bit of time to get a character \nreleased from jail even if the warden is bribed, and while SFO characters are licensed \nto kill, they must still explain themselves to local law enforcement. A tricky job \nthat gets harder and harder the farther they are from home. The amount of this \nBackground indicates how much money is usually on hand for bribes and the \namount of political sway the character can muster. While uncommon among the \nShih, it is not unheard of for some of them to gather this kind of influence if they \nremain in a region long enough, carry over contacts from their old lives, or even \nearn the patronage of grateful citizens with means to aid them. \n1 - \nAllowance of 200 yen per day for bribes, minor political sway (avoid \nparking tickets) \n2 -Allowance of 400 yen per day for bribes, can avoid almost anything less \nthan a felony charge.

Licensed to carry a concealed firearm. \n4 - \nAllowance of 800 yen per day for bribes, can avoid being arrested for \nanything less than espionage. Licensed to assist local law enforcement in emer- \ngency situations. \n5 - Allowance of 1000 yen per day for bribes, can call on local law \nenforcement for backup (watch what you tell them, though) or take command of \nlocal law enforcement in emergency situations.

Listed \nhere are some important extra guidelines to help keep tempers in check and the \nstory flowing smoothly. Do your part to make everything work. \nDon’t go wild - \nThe idea here is not to get carried away and hurt yourself. \nYou should never pretend to attack anyone physically, and you should never do \nanything remotely dangerous. Describe and mimic any action that could be \nconsidered even slightly dangerou \nBe a teacher - \nAchieving \nry by taking advantage of someone’s lack \nof knowledge is completely without class. Teach the poor sucker every trick and \nnuance beforehand, and then beat him anyway. Now that’s a triumph worth \nbragging about. \nDon‘t use weapons - \nWe’ve said it before, we’ll say it again. Don’t even \ncarry representations of weapons, not even if your character needs them for his \nspecial Hundred Lashing Tails of the Angry Storm Dragon nunchaku technique. \nprotect the Veil - \nDon’t perform illegal-seeming activities in public \nplaces, and make sure you use prop cards for any unusual or dangerous items that \nyour character possesses. \nDon’t overact - \nDon’t act out strong emotions unless everyone present is \naware of what’s going on, and always be ready to simmer down if someone asks to \ntake a breather from a particularly intense scene. It may be wonderful to be \nimmersed in the passion of an exchange with another character, but always \nremember that the real person behind that character has to be comfortable for it \nto be really great. Unnerving them or tiring them out just doesn’t do that. \nStay in character - \nStep out of character only if you have to. Respect \nothers’ needs to step out of character, for whatever reason. Never abuse this \ncourtesy by saying you are out of character just to avoid an encounter. \nExperienced players learn to weave the system of challenges into their \nconversations and be rather sly about it. They can avoid alerting the “mundanes” \nthat anything is happening. Doing so is the linchpin of Mind’s Eye Theatre. Real \npeople try to solve things calmly and collectively, not by kung fu strikes every five \nseconds. Characters should follow their example. \nDon’t debate the rules - \nNobody likes a rules lawyer. Don’t start rules \narguments during the game. Call for a Narrator. If you have a problem with a \nNarrator’s call, wait until after the game to argue your case. In the meantime, don’t \nhold up the rest of the plot. \nFoster intrigue - \nDon’t ever limit yourself to the goals and motivations \nthat a Narrator gives you at the start of a session; take control. Get involved! After \nall, it’s your story. \nCreate your own plots - \nCreate your own story and work other characters \ninto it one by one. Characters are made to act, not to react. \nWatch out for other players - \nKeep an eye out for players who look bored. \nA bored player is the perfect assistant Narrator. Remember that some players who \nget really bored tend to have their characters start killing other characters for no \nother reason than to have something to do. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nRespect theNarratm-Remember \nthat the Narrators have gone to a huge \neffort to create the story. Be nice to them. Request their help only when you really \nneed it, and thank them whenever they do come to the rescue. \nRoleplay, roleplay, roleplay - \nNot everything has to come down to a \nchallenge. Avoid “rulesmongering”; roleplay things out instead. A challenge \nshould be a last resort, when players cannot agree on what should happen. It’s much \neasier and more fun to agree and tell a story than it is to play Rock-Paper-Scissors. \nIf you use the rules only as acontingency to fall back on, you emphasize storytelling. \nEnjoy the surprises - \nBe ready for surprises and learn to enjoy them. Don’t \nthrow a fit because the ancestor happened to show up right when you were about \nto make your move. The world your character occupies is full of mysteries; you \nshouldn’t know how everything is going to work out. Treat each situation as a \npuzzle, and attempt to deduce a solution. That’s what your Narrator hopes you will \ndo. \nDon’t bring out-of-game knowledge to your character. Just because you’ve \nread every Year of the Lotus supplement from cover to cover doesn’t mean that your \nnew Kuei-jin character has any idea of what’s happening to her. Bringing outside \nknowledge in game is called “ninja sense” or “metagaming,” which are polite names \nfor “cheating.” \nBe patient with changes - \nBe patient when things change in midstream. \nTell the Narrator about your plot ideas before the game starts, so she has time to \nprepare for your plot’s effects. If your ideas are good, the Narrator will probably \nthank you and write your plot into the next story. \nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\n‘2/Al\\lq c?41 \n0000000000 \ncloooooooo0 \nVf;)EMOhl CFTI \n0000000000 \n0000000000 \nVFTAEPW \n0000000000 \n0000000000 \n0000000000 \n- \nOOROOOROOO \nhlIUF’OkdEE \n-robert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #36511)\n1\n"
