For those of you who are new to the publication, let me take \na second to acquaint you with just what you’ve got here. \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gap in your White \nWoIfLARPenvironmen~ Weofferdesfornewcharactertypes,origmlstorylinestowork \ninto your chronicles, guides for keeping your games under control and running smoothly \nand rules updates you won’t find in any other Mind’s Eye release. Plus, you’ll find answm \ntothequestionsthathaveplaguedyou,origmalWorldofDarknessfictionandcolumnsf \npeople who’ve been W i n g  or workmg here at White Wolf (or both) for years. \nAt least, that’s been the pattern thus far. Now, however, I’m sad to say that this \nvery issue is the last one that will be available for the foreseeable future. As we ramp \nup and fine-tune our fronthe Mind’s Eye Theatre releases, the Journal has simply \nbecome less and less necessary. Every resource that goes into making the Journal what \nitis isaresourcethatcouldjustaseasilygointoaLawsof ... booktomakeit thatmuch \nbetter. That being the case, it ftankly just doesn’t make much sense to continue to \ndivideourresourcesaswehavebeen.Althoughmanyofuswillbesadtoseethe \nJournal \ngo, the Mind’s Eye Theatre line will emerge stronger for the change. Its books will get \nbigger, its rules will get sharper, and it will become more inclusive in the long run. \nBut let’s forget about that for a moment and take a look at what’s actually in \nthis issue. There’s no sense drawing the curtain before the end of the first page.. .. \nIn this issue of the Journal, we take a look into the future of MET. Richard \nDansky gives advice on what to do when your game has run its course. Cynthia \nSummers talks about the future of the game line she develops so tirelessly and about \nthe genre itself. Steve Balfour, the president of the Camarilla fan club, foreshadows \na future MET release with an article on some of the concern surrounding chronicles \nthat are larger than the average chronicle. Newcomer David Tancredi also makes \na good showing with an article on creating convincing antagonists, and Peter \nWoodworth gives tips on personalizing the supernatural World of Darkness experi- \nence. And, asalways, you’llfindalittle Worldofhrknessfictionandanevent listing \nthat’s as accurate as it can be, considering the circumstances. \nAnd even though the Journal is going away, you can still contribute to the \nfuture of MET. Send letters on your opinions about the state of live-action \nroleplaying today. Send questions about the features and rules you’ve seen here, \nas well as notes about the broken rules you come across in different MET \npublications. Send horror stories about games gone wrong and how your players’ \ncharacters fixed them. Check out the Forum section of our web site and post your \nobservations there.

      "text": "THF CURRFNT THINKINCj \nWhen something you’ve worked on for a long time has to go away for \nreasons that are beyond your control, it’s tempting to point fingers and lay \nblame. When I heard that the Journal was being cancelled, I felt that \ntemptation. Instead of going onapetulant useless rampage, though, I decided \nto look back at how the Journal had been received thus far throughout its run. \nI paged through old emails and posts I had saved from our old online forum \n- \nyou know, the one that worked - \nand I found these collected comments. \nThe Journal I think is a great idea, though I have to say I’ve been a bit \ndisappointed in the way it’s turned out. Some of the information in the Journals \nis very useful, while some of it I can’t help but feel is just filler. Some of the things \nwould be useful, but there just isn’t enough information. \nFor example, a useful bit that came out of the Journals were the listings of \nwhat levels ofLore provided what information (and what misconceptions!). On \nthe other hand, we don’t need a section detailing Asian wraiths. The section on \nBastet would have been useful if it had included information on more tribes, or \na more complete listing of the Pumonca powers even. \nI would like to see something giving definitive information on Ghouls. Liber des \nGoulesisawasteofpaper and thenewer booksare both incomplete andalsocontradictory \nat points. Translations of more Werewolf material to MET would also be very useful. \nOverall, the Journal is a great idea that has had mediocre follow-through. It would \nbe a terrific forum to have official FAQs published and release MET information that \ndoesn’tfit into thestandardbooks. It needs lessfictionandfldandmore solidmaterial. \n-Tanuki \n(tanuki st@hotmail.com) \nI must say that, over all, the entire concept and run of the Mind’s Eye Theatre \nJournal has been a good one. There have only beena few small problems that I have \npersonally had with the Journals. Well, one really. One very big problem that \ncontinually pisses me off everytime I see that copy of the Journal. It’s about the \nLores ... Now, many of you out there might be happy that White Wolffinally came \nout and downright said what each level of each of the most predominant Lores \ndoes. But let me tell you something about those levels. They suck. If I spend more \nthan fourteen seconds in an actual LARP game with one of those creature types, \nchances are I will be able to learn more about said creature type than someone with \na Kindred Lore of 40. How do I know it’s 14 seconds? I timed it. \nIn short, the system screws anyone who wants to come into agame knowing \nmore than a first-night Embrace/Changed/Dead/Faerie-stuffed/whatever be- \ncause spending three minutes with characters of that type will give you more info \nthan any level of the “Lores” will. Maybe the Lores should be called “Lies and \nUseless Info.” It’s much more accurate, and I could stop putting quotes around \nit because that name would be far more fitting. \nYeah.. . \n-Unagodd \n(frederick@csus.edu) \n"

      "text": "I’m very fond of the concept of a magazine as support for a game. Games \nWorkshop does the same, TSR does (did ?? i don’t fallow them anymore) the \nsame. when issue 1 and 2 came out, i was very enthousiastic, but i’m somewhat \ndissapointed by the amount of useful1 info i find in them. half of the time, there \nis not a single item of use in them to me. \nthe things i’m after is metaplot and rules( clarification). a magazine gives the \npossibility to influence the WOD, a bit like the updates on the WOD in books \nlike TOTB & NOP. a magazine is a perfect tool to bring the changes on a regular \ntimed base. example : issue 10 talks about the changes in California, issue 11 \nabout the takeover by the cama from ny, issue 12 about ... you get the picture. \nalso, things like (much more) FAQ’s are something that i would like to see \nin the magazine. \nI suppose all in all these are good publications, but they don’t offer what \ni’m looking for. \n-Xavier \nMuylaert (Muvlaert@mail.com) \nFor me, I enjoy the MET Journal. The additional rules for minor bloodlines and \nupdates to the METgameworld (like Hunters, recent events in Wraith matters, etc.) \nare a welcome bonus. Articles detailing history and/or exposing metaplot informa- \ntion are wonderful as well, because not all LARPers follow the tabletop game. \nMuch to White Wolfs chagrin, I suspect! \nI would like to see more FAQ’s, official updates and perhaps optional rules. \nThe MET Journal is the perfect place to publish Oblivion updates to 3rd Edition \nVampire MET core rules, additional character types, and even direction on \ncostuming or helpful Storytelling guidelines. Granted, some rules will probably \nneed to be saved for a future book, but hints and tips - \nlike the recent Mage \narticle - \ngo far to help fill in those gaps until the official versions are printed. \nWhat I do not like to see published in the pages of the MET Journal are \n“ultra kewl powerz” that only serve to have players BEG for them, at least those \npowers that are not tempered in some fashion. I am also not a fan of fiction \nwithin the pages. I know, I know, just because it’s not my cup of tea I shouldn’t \nbe too harsh to judge. But, the beauty of toleplaying is that WE get to create the \nstories. I don’t want to read about your ideas, I want to make my own. \n“But James, some people aren’t that creative and they need some ideas!” Absolutely, \nbut there is plenty of theme, flavor and fiction within the rulebooks to get us started, \ngenerally found at the begmning of a rulebook and often between the chapters. \nWhile the World of Darkness isn’t about rules and systems but about \nStorytelling, this is not the World of Darkness Journal. This is a journal \ndedicated to one specific set of rules and one specific line of rulebooks. If I want \nfiction set in the World of Darkness, I’ll go pick up any number of paperbacks \npublished by The Wolf. I don’t buy rulebooks or supplemental material for the \ngripping fiction. I don’t believe many people do. \nIf you must, use the fiction to illustrate an MET scene. Don’t simply provide a \ngripping tale that only exists to entertain. Let the Storytellers do that for their players. \nThat’s why we buy the rulebooks. \nAdditionally, the MET Journal could be the best place to publish errata that \ngoes beyond mere FAQ level.

      "text": "Page XX should have said” errata. No one likes admitting mistakes but we all \nmake them: customer, author and publisher alike. Unfortunately for the authors \nand publishers, the customer is traditionally right. Make us happy and give us the \nclarifications and updates we seek in a timely fashion. \n-James A. Hussiere (drjamez@maine.rr.com) \nI like the MET Journal for a number of reasons, some of which I’ll describe \nbelow. However, I must clarify a point before I list my pros/cons. \nI am a mature role-player who prefers the richness of the World of Darkness \nsetting and the Mind’s Eye Theater rule system. \nI do not consider myself a “Mindless Fanboy”. I do not purchase a periodical \n“just because it’s cool!” I do not purchase every single White Wolf product that \ncomes along, “A Vampire cigerette lighter?No thanks, I don’t smoke.” I do not \npreach about my characters, past and present, to unsuspecting game developers. \nI do consider myself an “MET Evangelist” and I try to set a good example \nof our hobby. I do purchase a product when its content is good and the MET \nJournal gives me the content that I want by providing MET setting and rules \nclarifications that enrich my chronicle. \nWhatdoIlikeabuttheMETJournal?HerearemytopthreeDesertIslandanswers. \n1. The MET Journal has a sense of humor. Unlike other trade publications \nthat shall go nameless, the MET Journal is grounded enough to poke fun at \nthemselves and the product they create. When was the last time a certain \ncompany of upper-west coast of magic-users actually warned their players about \nthe risks of overindulgence in their product. Bye Rich, 1’11 miss the wit! \n2. The MET Journal is not a sales engine, but is an advertisement free \npublication focused on the Mind’s Eye rule system. I don’t have to wade through \narticles, ads or reviews of other systems that I’m not interested in. I like my \ncontent to be direct and I get that with the Journal. \n3. The MET Journal is inexpensive. Heck, I’ve paid more for graphic novels \nor user guides that have been far less informative or enjoyable. \nWhat would I like to see improved in the MET Journal? \n1. I would like to see the MET Journal published on a more timely basis, perhaps \nevery two months, instead of quarterly. Given the large volume of new material \nbeing published by White Wolf, we - the MET Storytellers, Players and retailers - \nneed a more reliable schedule for purchasing and stocking your fine periodical. \n2. I would like to see the most current MET rules clarifications (especially \nthe increasing cross-over questions) addressed and published in a timely fashion. \nInstead of having to wait and then buy a new MET Rules book to see the current \nFAQ, I would like to find it, indexed and accurate, in the MET Journal. It would \nsave me and my players from having to search through the various MET rules \nbooks to find the approprate data, and time saved means more time to play! \n3. I would like to see more articles focused on improving our Live Action \nhobby. While you already have a number of articles formatted for the Journal, \nI would like to see a few more columns on such topics as, chronicle creation, \nstorytelling techniques and pitfalls, legal aspects such as waivers and insurance, \nand how to handle the press without digging your own roasting pit. \nXybertec (Cybertec@cyberdude.com) \n"

      "text": "Mind's Eye Theater Journal is a great idea, but there are a few problems that \nI have seen with the Journal itself. \n1. Too Expensive. I can buy a book for the price of two journals. If there is \nany way to write this and make it cheaper, or if there is anyway you can make \nsubscriptions for the year, that would be the best thing. \n2. Too Much. There is too much on the things that are not played much and \nnot enough on the things that are. How about crossover rules for Garou to the \nnew 3rd ed. We have a mixed venue vampkgarou game and it would be nice to \nfigure out how to even the balances. \n3. FAQ's. Would be nice. (It would be nice to know if the designers \nintended for speed of thought and speed beyond thought to be used in the same \nsequence, and if it was, it would be nice to question them as to why they believe \nGarou should be able to be able to take up to 60 steps a turn for 8 hours.) Things \nlike that question plague every Larp. \n4. Storylines ... Nuff Said ... some MET SL's for beginning ST's \n5. TOO MUCHCHANGELING ANDWRAITH..,Iknow that Changeling \nand Wraith need a boost in the MET world, but most people play Vampire or \nWerewolf. I would like to see a little more about them in the future. All we've seen \non Vampires are (True Black Handkind of useful} Stuff on Camarilla and OWBN \n{Semi Useful} Types of players {Twice and not useful except for a laugh} Lores \n{Usefull but I would like an expanded section of Lores so we don't get into fights, also \nwhat does one start out with. I.E. does a Garou have werewolf 5 and Garou 2?} \nOther than that, I've liked the editorials, and gotten a good laugh from some of \nthe articles. Also, it's great that you take suggestions from people. It makes lie easier. \n-Nurain \n(nurain@hotmail.com) \n"

      "text": "SO LON%, EARFWFLL, \nBY€-BY€ \nby Cynthia Summers, Mind’s Eye Theatre developer \nWell, for starters, Mind’s Eye Theatre isn’t going anywhere, although the \nJournal is falling by the wayside. Don’t all jump for joy at once.. .. \nMind’s Eye Theatre still has places to go, things to do and people to meet. \nThe upcoming Changing Breeds Book 1 and Vampire Storytellers Guide will \ncontinue to blaze new trails for LARPers of all stripes. Looking to the future, I \ndefinitely want the game line’s focus to be on telling stories and giving folks the \nbest tools with which to do so. \nTypically, last issues are considered a place to air prophecies, predictions \nand similar vaporware. Based on what I’ve been seeing in the course of my job, \nI’ll venture to put on my foresight cap and play at prophet. I think the live-action \ngenre is in for some interesting times ahead. This hobby has been around for at \nleast a decade, if not a little longer. The LARPing world of today is not the same \nas it was when Masquerade first came out. Some of the conventions of modern \nLARPing will change, and all of them will have to face up to the times. Exactly \nhow audiences’ tastes will change as days go by is up to social scientists (and our \nmarketing department) to figure out, but you can be sure that MET books will \nadapt to fit them. \nThe folks who’ve been engaging in live-action roleplaying for several years \nnow, like myself, are admittedly getting a bit long in the tooth. The folks who \nsaw Masquerade come into being are getting married, having kids and experi- \nencing various other grown-up rites of passage. But now that we’re doing all this \ngrowing up, will we need to give up “playing pretend”? Will new games give rise \nto “e1ders”mourningfor the good old days and wondering what’s the matter with \nkids today, while the “kids” wonder when those “fogies0 are going to retire to the \nold LARPers’ home? Those OG’s (original garners) who have continued to press \non often have more collective roleplaying experience under their belts than \ntheir new (and younger) Storytellers do. \nThis potential conflict could go several ways. It could result in clashes of age \nwhere those who reach a certain age find themselves increasingly unwelcome or \nwhere a youth must spend time in entry-level positions (both in and out of \ncharacter) for a long time. On the other hand, old chronicles might enjoy a \nresurgence in popularity and vitality as fresh new players infuse the scene with \ntheir enthusiasm. A coterie of experienced power-players might rise to promi- \nnence in an aging game and alienate the young, inexperienced players who \nwould otherwise keep the game alive. Conversely, a group of old hands who are \nthe Storyteller’s most mature and competent players might take mentor roles \nand help integrate bright-eyed young LARPers into the game in such a way that \nthe game goes on and continues to strive. \nPrediction: They’re not quite the Geritolset, but olderplayers are becomingafact \nof life. We’re only beginning to see the impact they’ll have on the hobby, and it will be \nan important factor in its future. \n"

      "text": "Those coming in fresh to the games are entering with less knowledge of the \nmaterial under their belts. They’re less likely to have encountered the World of \nDarkness in a tabletop format than to have been recruited via a friend’s \nrecommendation, word of mouth or just happening upon a Laws of ... book in \na local store. This concern has already been addressed tentatively with the \nchanges to the books that give new Mind’s Eye readers a glimpse of the setting. \nNew rulebooks now start with ambient fiction and setting material that puts the \nrules material in some kind of context. \nThe newer generations of gamers are also coming in with wildly different \nbackground materials. We came to the games with impressions of The Crow and \nInterview with a Vampire, and we wanted to play what we saw. Our younger \nsiblings, however, are more familiar with Buffy and The Matrix. This difference \nisn’t necessarily destructive to the hobby, but it will become a factor as groups \ntry to create stories that pander to both sets of creative expectation. \nPrediction: Stormy waters lie ahead for those who are plotting the courses of \nchronicles. Storytelkrs will have to find a happy medium between brooding anti-hero \nstones and post-industrial epic taks of success against seemingly insurmountable odds. \nSpeaking of youth, what about those kids that the older players now have. \nAre we looking at the real next generation of LARPers? Is LARPing going to be \none more activity to juggle in between Little League games and ballet lessons? \nWhile much of the new gamers coming into the hobby are in their late teens and \nearly 20s (as many of us were when we started), a growing group of youngbloods \nis made up of elementary-school age kids who want to know what Mom and Dad \nare doing when they head out for the night dressed up in laced shirts or green \nvelvet. Certainly the enthusiasm surrounding the Harry Potter books suggests \nthat a wealth of youngsters are thirsty for fantasy and they just need the \nopportunity to take the next step. Simply ignoring this group or rebuffing its \ninterest may be one of the more ill-considered moves the LARP community \ncould make. \nPrediction: Groups may need to reconsider their approach to young peopk \nbeyond a blanket policy of non-admission. \nAnd that’s all that my psychic powers can endure for now. Now we sit back \nand see what the future brings. \nClosing out also means that you give out thanks to everyone who spent time \nworking on the thing. So -thanks to Carl for putting this puppy together from \na few harebrained ideas and turning out a silk purse from the sow’s ear. Thanks \nto the remarkable crop of writers who gave us so much to play with and think \nabout, taking roleplaying beyond a few sheets of paper and playing “let’s \npretend” down in the basement. And of course, thanks to you, the loyal readers, \nwho’ve followed us thus far. We wouldn’t be here at all without you. \nTake care, have fun, and we’ll see you around Elysium. \n"

Although he’s no \nlonger with us -the \ncompany, that is, not the living- \nhis presence has had a resounding influence on this game \nline and this hobby. In fact, I wouldn’t even have a job \nhere if it wasn’t for Richard. When you see this man, shake \nhis hand, thank him for all the hard work, and kt him know \nthat the contributions he’s made will not be forgotten. \nYears and years ago, back when vinyl was the best form of music you could get (as \nopposed to a statement about your retro chic muso cred like it is now), the Alan Parsons \nProject recorded a song called “Where Do We Go From Here?” For those of you who \ndon’t know who the Alan Parsons Project was, they’re the band best known for that \nthunderous instrumental that gets played before most sporting events these days. For \nthose of you who do know about APP and are currently sneering because let’s face it, \nVulture Culture was probably not one of the cooler albums ever recorded, relax. There’s \nalways someone out there who thinks your taste in music sucks. And for those few of \nyou who actually own Alan Parsons Project CDs - \nor even albums - \nwell, we’re \ngetting old, guys. Still, it could be worse: I could be leading off the column by discussing \nwhat LARP plot lines can be extracted from Emerson, Lake and Palmer’s Tarkus album. \nCount your blessings, folks. \nBut, as usual, I digress. My point, or at least my moderately blunt conversational \nobject, is that it’s always time to think about what comes next. What do you do when \nyour game crashes and burns, or it gets taken over by no-talent munchkins? What \nhappens if your favorite game system (*cough* Wraith *cough*) gets canceled. In \nshort, what do you do if the status quo of your gaming universe, Deo prohibe, changes? \nMind you, this notion isn’t one that the gaming industry-or \nthe gaming audience \n- \nnecessarily takes to heart with a whole lot of love. The phenomenon that I call \n“gaming crystallization” that takes place an awful lot, and it hits players, writers and \ndevelopers with equal frequency. In so many words, gaming crystallization is the notion \nthat when someone finds gaming for the first time, he seizes on the first good game he \nplays as the Platonic ideal of roleplaying. Nothing else can ever measure up to that first \nsublime experience, and any changes to the game line are a betrayal of that one, shining, \nmagical moment when the dice first hit the table. \nUnfortunately, everyone crystallizes at different times and with different systems. \nThat’s why you get edition wars on UseNet and mailing lists, for one thing. It’s also why \nsome folks get verrrrry nervous or dismissive about games and styles of play that are \ndifferent from the ones they’re used to. Not everyone crystallizes thus, certainly - \nnot \nby a long shot - \nbut it does happen, and it’s something to watch out for. After all, if \n"

I just don’t look out at my players from across the \nBuried Secrets screen, sniff in best Etonian fashion and announce that no gaming \nexperience henceforth can possibly compare. You love what you love, but you shouldn’t \nallow it to keep you from enjoying something new. \nSo what does that pithy bit of wisdom mean for you? And no, this doesn’t mean \nthat MET is going to be canceled. MET is going to grow and thrive for agood long time, \nand that’s great. It’s also going to change as things go along -hopefully there won’t \nbe another Laws of the Night, but there might be - \nand you’ll have the choice of how \nyou’re going to take it. In my opinion, at least, the best thing you can do is recognize \nthat change is coming and inevitable, and do your level best to make sure that the \nchange is for the better. So write cards and letters with feedback and critique. (And \nmake them polite ones, damn it. Nothing turns someone off toyour feedback faster than \nsaying, “You screwed up, but I, in my infinite armchair wisdom, know how to fix \neverything.”) Make sure you mention what you like in your letters as well. Positive \nfeedback helps immensely, believe it or not. \nBut, to quote Monty Python, that’s as may be: It’s still a frog. Some of you folks are \ngoing to crystallize in your gaming with MET as it stands, and there’s nothing wrong \nwith that. If it works for you, it works. It’s that simple. Nobody’s saying that you always \nhave to jump on the newest, hottest thing to come along just because it’s new and it \nseems to be all the rage. Just because it’s new and hot doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s \nany damn good, or that it’s something you’ll enjoy as much as what you’re doing now. \nI keep my old Villains and Vigilantes books easily accessible for a reason, and it’s not \njust so I can haul out “Organized Crimes” for purposes of taunting my erstwhile \nmanager, Ken Cliffe. It’s because I have fun with the game, even despite the fact that \nthe system is simplistic and the book‘s falling apart. Ten years from now, some of you \nare liable to be saying the same thing about your shabby, dog-eared copies of Laws of \nthe Night. And last time I checked, that’s what this whole thing is about. \n(I’m also fully cognizant of the fact that some of you are going to be systematically \nburning every picture you can find of yourself in character costume and bemoaning the \ntime you wasted on such a childish hobby, but such is life. Remember what happened \nto Susan at the end of the Chronicles ofNarnia. Different folks take different roads, and \nthey’re perfectly happy with them.) \nBut that’s the big picture, or at least one panel of it.

Take, \nfor example, the horrifying, soul-shattering moment when you suddenly realize that.. . \n. ..you’re bored to freakin’ death with your game as it now stands. So, to borrow a \nline from Dennis Hopper, whaddaya do, whaddaya do? \nThe easy step to take is the boldest: Quit. Write a snide or angry or regretful email \n- \nyour choice - \nto the Storyteller, the Narrators, your fellow players and random \npassersby announcing your departure and enumerating your reasons for jumping ship. \nDoing so provides no small measure of catharsis, but it also pretty much eliminates the \npossibility of ever returning to the game. Phrases like “bloated, flaccid storytelling style” \nand “emotionally dishonest bouts of Rock-Paper-Scissors” may seem fun to write, but \nthey do a wonderful job of ensuring that you’re never going to be welcomed back. \nOf course, if you’re feeling particularly spiteful, you can quit and try to start your \nown game, with the express purpose of putting the old one out of business. This idea \nis bad on any number of levels, not the least of which are A.) it’s a hell of a lot of work \nto do just to put a dull stick in someone’s figurative eye, and B.) if you do succeed in \nkilling the other game, all of the players you felt compelled to leave behind will then \nseek to while away their evenings in your chronicle because there’s nowhere else for \nthem to go. Oops. \nA more sensible approach is to sit down and dope out what exactly bothers you \nabout the game as it’s currently configured. Writing it out helps. If nothing else, doing \nso forces you to formalize and organize what your thoughts on the matter actually are. \nAlso, putting those thoughts in black and white (or green or red or whatever color ink \nyou’re using, although I recommend against crayon) is a great way to see if you’ve got \nlegitimate concerns or if you’re just being pissy. For instance, “My character is getting \nslapped around,” isn’t a legit concern. “My character is getting stomped like the 1998 \nMinnesota Twins because the Storyteller gives his buddies all sorts of kewl powerz and \nignores the rest of us,” is. \nOnce you’ve got those concerns mapped out, you can look at them with a \nsufficiently jaundiced eye and decide what’s called for next. Maybe quitting - \nor just \ntaking some time off - \nis the appropriate solution. The trick is remembering that it’s \na solution, not a grandiose gesture of defiance. In the grand scheme of things, quitting \na LARP is not quite on the same level as, say, standing in front of a tank in Tiananmen \nSquare. Maybe a little time off is all you need to get your batteries recharged, or maybe \nyou’re done with that game for good, but it’s still just a game you’re talking about. \nWhat that means is, if you’re going to go, go. Do it. Don’t make speeches about how \nit pains you to leave, don’t wait for your adoring ghouls to beg you to come back and \nsave the game, don’t expect the world to end just because you’re walking away. Just go, \nand move on. Nothing is more annoying (including the brain surgeons who throw \nsomething that looks like an obscene hand gesture from a deranged gibbon during R- \nP-S and claim that it’s alternately a scrawny rock, curved scissors or really thin sheets \nof paper) than an ex-player who tries to imitate Banquo’s ghost by sticking around for \nthe feast. Who knows? Maybe once you’re away for a bit, you’ll decide that you want \nto come back. Maybe you’ll want to start your own game after all. And maybe you’ll \ndecide vou’ve iust had enoueh. and vou’11 close the book on that Darticular amect of \nI \n"

      "text": "Then again, there are times when the big shakeup isn’t your doing. Games have \nbeen known, for any number of reasons, to fall down and go boom. Maybe the main \nStoryteller moves, quits or (Deoprohibe! -again \nwith the Latin! It means“God forbid, \nin case you’re wondering, but let’s face it, Gladiator made this stuff cool again.) acquires \nanother commitment that requires a sizable time investment. (Kids, for example. Kids \nare a big one.) Sometimes the game just winds down of its own accord, as the story line \nwraps up and nothing arises to take its place. Player attrition is another killer, especially \nif the game is one that relies on existing community to the extent that it rarely draws \nnew blood. (In case you’re wondering, that’s a nice way of saying “Someone kills off all \nthe newbies’ characters until the players stop coming back.”) And sometimes you just \nshow up and the only people there are the Storyteller’s SO and the janitor, swapping \nwar stories and comparing their favorite vintages of chardonnay. Hey, it happens. \nWhen it happens, though, you have to figure out what you’re going to do next. The \neasiest approach is just to sit on your thumbs and hope someone else decides to start \nanother game up. The flaw with this approach, however, is twofold: One, you’re at the \nmercy of someone else’s gaming style and choice of material. Two, as one of my \ncoworkers says, “Hope is the beginning of unhappiness.” \nOf course, if you feel disinclined to sit around and wait for someone else to bite the \nbullet, you can go the opposite route and start a game yourself. (There’s actually a third \nroute, which can best be summed up as “guilt/ manipulate/ sucker someone else into \ndoing it for your pleasure,” but we don’t condone that sort of thing here. Well, not often, \nand not when management is looking.) By doing so, you’re making sure that the game \nyou want to play is getting run, and you’re taking squarely on your shoulders the \nresponsibility for continuing the gaming community in your area. (Note: If you actually \ndo decide to run a game, you have my respect, sympathy and admiration. You also \nprobably have a need to hit yourself on the forehead with a large brick five or six times, \njust to prepare yourself for what’s coming next. It pretty much accurately simulates the \nunpleasant aspect of running a LARP, but with less photocopying.) Just make sure that \nif you do decide to run a game, you’re prepared for all of the hard work and the criticism \nthat comes with it. If you value your life, sanity and stomach lining, do not expect \npeople to kowtow before you in swooning admiration because you saved the game. \nInstead, be prepared for endless kvetching about how the old game was better, how they \ncould do it better and quite possibly how a one-legged bullfrog who moonlights as a \nbanjo player at the local Dukes of Hazzurd-themed watering hole could do it better. \nHowever, I can also state with some confidence that a storytelling staff composed of \nTaliesin, Sam Clemens, Senchan Torpeist and some balding dude named Bill would get \nthe identical reaction. It’s when you don’t get any griping that you have to worry. That \nmeans they don’t care enough to bitch. \nIn the end, it all boils down to this: It’s going to change. All of it. Your gaming \ngroup, your chronicle, even the very game you’re playing. Get over it. It’s going to \nhappen. There’s no sense playing Canute and trying to hold back the waves, because \nit’s just not going to work. (No, I can’t tell you what clan Canute was, though I’m sure \nhe’s in a book somewhere. Don’t blame me; I stuck to minor British nobility and people \nwho were dead already. It seemed safest.) The inevitable end result is that you’ll end up \nall wet, with lots of people asking you who the heck Canute was. \nUltimately, you have two responsibilities. The first is to yourself, and it’s a \nresponsibility to have fun. Otherwise, why bother playing the game?

We want a rich chronicle with a history and story that evolves and \nchanges as our characters plot, scheme and act. A slightly smaller set of us are \ninto large games in chronicles or at conventions. Have you ever been to a live- \naction game with over 300 players dressed to the nines and roleplaying their \nhearts out? Oh, it’s a unique experience! Your character is always at risk. The \nbiggest-name characters are there. A scene done right opens a dozen doors, and \na scene done poorly closes them all. It’s astounding. \nBig games and long chronicles are not just different and desirable for the \nplayers, they’re a real challenge for the Storytellers and organizers. Game sites \nmust be found, plots must be interwoven, characters must be directed, teams of \nStorytellers need coordinating, and all of the rest of the stuff we all help with to \nget these huge albatrosses to soar and swoop like eagles must be done. They are \noutrageous fun when everything goes well. They are mind-splitting headaches \nwhen they do not. \nSo, do you want to play in or host a huge game? Have you ever wanted to \nstorytell or play in a sprawling multi-city chronicle?How about just adding a few \nmore ideas and possible solutions for that big game you already enjoy or run? \nWell, that’s why I’m writing. \nPartially. I couldn’t address all the things that make large games and \nchronicles fantastic successes, but I can cover some of the most important \nelements that will help you shine as a Storyteller or player - \nthe rules and the \ndynamics of large games. And no, this article shouldn’t prove unhelpfully \nesoteric; I’ve become a practical guy since I started coordinating larger LARPs \nin 1994. I’ve seen a lot after being a Storyteller at several of bigger conventions \nlike Dragon*Con and being on the production and storytelling teams of many \nof the Camarilla’s large games (White Wolf’s fan club called the Camarilla, not \nthe fictional vampire sect). As far as tips go, I’ve worked and roleplayed with \nsome of the best in the World of Darkness LARP scene. Plus, I have a secret \nweapon that helps me make sense out of some of the odd problems we face in \nlarge LARPs and international chronicles: I have a few degrees in psychology. \nSo, WHAT’S \nT H E  BI \ncj DEAL. \n? \nBig games and long chronicles cause rules to break, plots to break, players \nto break and Storytellers to break.

      "text": "large games each year, ranging from 150 to 350 players and one really enormms \ngame with close to 1000 players at the annual International Camarilla Conven- \ntion (ICC). Some people find my lower boundary of 150 players too high, of \ncourse; a 70-person game is too large for some. Whatever the case is for you, I’ll \nstick to describing the game and plot logistics that I’ve learned in the school of \nhard knocks, because that’s what’s relevant to the majority of large games. You’re \nprobably not too interested about how to rent out an entire hotel for three nights \nlike the ICC does. \nI think of a long+running MET chronicle as one that’s been running for at \nleast a year and has some pretty good continuity-reinforcing mechanisms in \nplace, such as email lists, a solid group of core players or some long-lived \ncharacters. Although long chronicles can take place in just one city, several \ngroups - \nincluding the Camarilla (club not sect), One World by Night and \nShared Universe - \nhost multi-city chronicles. The Camarilla’s chronicle, for \ninstance, has about 250 cities on four continents playing in a 6000-person \nchronicle that started in 1992. The Camarilla runs weekly or biweekly events \nwith 20 to 100 players and maintains numerous email lists to keep Storytellers \ncoordinated and everybody roleplaying to their hearts’ content. \nHow Brg C ~ A M E S  B R E A K A N D  \nWHY \nBig games and long chronicles cause rules to break, plots to break, players \nto break and Storytellers to break. Smaller games allow for more personal \ninteraction between Storytellers, players, plots and the rules. If your MET \nchronicle consists of seven players and one Storyteller, you can run it very much \nlike a table-top game with the Storyteller describing the reactions of the World \nof Darkness and helping everyone through challenges that they perform. The \nfeel is personal, the plots can be grand and world-changing, and the mechanics \nof the rules can be governed by consensus. The Storyteller has a good idea of \nwhat each character is doing, and he can work on character development, \npersonal horror and intriguing plot twists from each character’s past. \nAs the game gets larger, more players end up in conflict with each other so \nthat the chronicle shifts subtly away from the Storyteller describing the World \nof Darkness to the players defining the World of Darkness for each other. Even \nif the ratio of Storytellers to players is the same as it is in a smaller game, the larger \ngame becomes less personalized to each character. Unlike a game with one \nStoryteller and seven players, a game with 10 Storytellers and 70 players means \nthat no one Storyteller knows the general plans of each and every character and \nthat lots of player actions and challenges take place outside of the Storytellers’ \nview. Social dynamics also become a factor in the 70-person game, whereas \npersonal dynamics are more prominent in the seven-person game, so the \npsychological rules of play change for everyone involved. \nWhen a game branches out to multiple cities, a whole new level of \ncomplexity occurs. All of the sudden, the plots have to shrink in scope to \naccommodate the diverse views of the Storytellers in different cities. Yes, the \nplots have to shrink. In a seven-person game, for instance, the Storyteller can \ndictate that the characters burned Atlanta to the ground. Even in a 70-person \ngame in one city, it’s not that big of a deal (logistically) to have some monstrous \nforce sink Vancouver or wipe out an entire supernatural character type. But, as \n"

      "text": "soon as two different cities join the same Chronicle, the Storytellers and players \nhave to deal with what each other city does. The Storytellers and players cannot \nwrite and perform plot lines with worldwide effects without having all the \nStorytellers (and the majority of players) in all the cities agree and accept them. \nFor instance, the Brujah justicar cannot both hold a conclave in one city \nand be diablerized in another at the same time. High King David cannot disband \nthe Parliament of Dreams in one city but charge the Parliament with a task in \nthe other. Therefore, the possible plots for multi-city chronicles must shrink in \nscope as the number of cities in a chronicle increases, and that shrinking changes \nplayers’ opportunities and Storytellers’ plot tools. \nMulti-city games also put more stress on the Storytellers and the rules, because \nit is much harder to coordinate information for two or more teams than it is for only \none. What happens if a character destroys a police station in one city and then \nplays in another nearby city the next night? How quickly do police respond in the \nWorld of Darkness? How is everyone with Police and Media Influence informed? \nDoes that character’s action impact the levels of Influence (or danger) in each city? \nWere the Willpower Traits that the character spent last night in the other city \nmarked off for play tonight? Many of these questions are easy to answer in a one- \ncity game, but they become problems when two or more cities are involved. When \nyou add the elements of players with email or ICQ, you start to see how the \nStorytellers can be outpaced by the players in two or 250 cities. \nH o w  RULES \nBREAK \nLet’s go back to large games for a while. The goal of the MET system is to \nhelp players have fun roleplaying and acting out stories. In larger games, some \ncategories of rules begin to fray. The first category of rules that break in a large \ngame is that which encourages lots of tests. As an example, an Elysium scene \nwith 100 players in the same room descends into across-the-room testing hell \nwhen a single obfuscated Malkavian walks into the room among its security- \nparanoid court officials and supernaturally observant spectators. What happens \nwhen two or three such characters walk in at the same or different times? \nAnother example relevant to all MET rules is mass combat. In a room of 70 \nplayers, mass combat requires a charismatic Storyteller and a few assistants to \ncoordinate. The problem is compounded if only 35 of those 70 players in the \nroom are actually in the combat while the other 35 are trying to roleplay other \nscenes occurring in the same place. \nAnother category of rules that break in large games involves those rules that \nrely on Storyteller interpretation. Large-game Storytellers are not part of a hive \nmind. They will inevitably make different rulings about the way bonus Traits from \nsupernatural powers work, the amount or type of information that supernatural \ndetection gives or what effects some powers have. Aside from the complaints that \ncan generate among players, this inconsistency causes incongruities in the story. \nMost of these sorts of problems are not a concern in games with up to five \nStorytellers. Adding any more Storytellers, though, makes every little ambiguity \na possible frustration for everyone that can lead to a break from roleplaying. \nThe last category of rules that break in large games comprises rules that \nintroduce complexity to the game or record keeping for the game. In a room of \nseven, it’s not a big deal to mark a Trait off a character sheet or even track \n"

      "text": "temporary Trait totals. In a room of 70, the game changes. Large games have \nmore action going on all the time. Players have to attend to and remember a lot \nmore information, and the information is often less organized or predictable \nthan information in a smaller game. The nuances of rules end up being \nannoyances in large games. The larger the game is, the greater its need becomes \nfor fewer rules, simpler rules and rules that are easy to memorize. Also, it is much \nbetter to eliminate rules that require dragging out character sheets in large \ngames. Stopping the action for one player can potentially affect the rest of the \nplayers in the room negatively. \nMulti-city chronicles face most of the large-game problems, but with a \nhigher negative-impact potential. Two additional concerns that arise in those \ngames impact rules for multi-city chronicles. First, the frequency of character \ndeath should be minimized for the sake of both player satisfaction and chronicle \ncontinuity. It is often to the advantage of a chronicle to power down offensive \nsupernatural abilities and Merits while giving a character’s defensive capabilities \nmore weight. Second, keeping records and managing rules for refreshing used \nAbility and Background Traits becomes difficult in multi-city games. Consis- \ntent, easy- to-remember rules about refresh rates can lighten the burden of record \nkeeping and decrease the chance of player mistakes in multi-city chronicles. \nH O W  PLOTS \nBREAK \nThe stresses on rules in large games can sometimes be smoothed over by a \ndynamic Storyteller attending to the story and circumstances at the time. \nHowever, stresses on plots in large games can ruin any chance of creating a \nchronicle or allowing for meaningful character development. A challenge for \nany game with many Storytellers lies in coordinating plot lines over space and \ntime. Just the layout of the place where a large game is held can make \ncommunication between Storytellers easier or harder. Technology can help. So \ncan regularly scheduled meetingsduring the course of play. (But beware, though, \nthat Storytellers cannot just walk away from certain situations because they \nhave a meeting to attend.) \nAs games increase in size, players begin to define the World of Darkness for \neach other more than they rely on the Storytellers to define it for them. This \neffect occurs partially because more players are introducing their characters’ \nagenda into the game, adding a multitude of character-driven plots to the story. \nAs the game increases in size, some players grow more independent of the \nStorytellers and the rest of the players, so their character’s plots also begin to \ndiverge from what can reasonably be expected. \nWhile this divergence makes larger games more interesting, it poses a \nsignificant challenge to Storytellers writing plots. On one hand, character- \ndriven plots can be the focus of a large game (with a little Storyteller facilitation \nand moderation). On the other hand, character-driven plots can evaporate \nrapidly as the characters achieve their goals and begin to look for something else \nto do. In smaller games, it is much easier to understand where the characters are \ngoing and provide the necessary elements in the plot to deepen the roleplaying \nexperience. In larger games, not only is it harder to track and understand where \nthe characters are going, but having more characters means opening the door for \nmany more character-driven plots.

      "text": "slightly different style of working with character-driven plots and you can see \nwhy games with more and more Storytellers, such as multi-city chronicles, face \nmany different challenges for moderating character-driven plots and writing \ntheir own plots. \nPlot lines have to be satisfying to the players, something that a Storyteller \ncan build into a plot he writes, but that character-drivenplots do not necessarily \ninclude. However, each degree of uncertainty introduced by increasing the \nnumber of players or Storytellers makes writing plots more challenging. In a \ngame governed principally by character-driven plots, Storytellers need a set of \nstock plot lines that can be implemented quickly when the character-driven \nplots dry up. A set of stock plots may sound less interesting or challenging to \nwrite than tailored plots, but such i s  not the case. A set ofstock plots must cover \nthe range ofplayers that may be attending agame. The plots must be interesting, \nsatisfying and linked into the chronicle in an understandable way, rather than \nrandomly throwing a treasure-laden Judas goat out for the characters to fight \nover. Shrewd storytelling teams in multi-city chronicles weave lots of plot line \nhooks into the chronicle so that they can put a plot into play at the most \nopportune time . \nIn large LARPs, players do not always create their characters’ agenda with \na concern for entertaining the assembled group. Moderating character-driven \nplots can seem as difficult as negotiating trade rights between hostile countries. \nPlayers, you can help by keeping the group in mind as you decide what your \ncharacter will do each night. Storytellers, you have to balance the enjoyment \nthat the group is drawing from all the combined plots in play and the desire for \nplayers to have their characters in the spotlight just enough to make their \nroleplaying experience. \nH O W  PLAYERS \nBREAK \nSmall games are based on personal dynamics and regulated by friendship \nand understanding. Large games are less personal, and they begin to rely on \nlarger-scale social dynamics. For instance, it is much harder for a character to be \nleft out of a small game. The players or Storytellers involved can reintegrate any \nneglected characters quickly. In large games, players and Storytellers feel less \naccountable to each other and take less action to help each other. This effect is \ncalled the “bystander effect” in social psychology, named after the fact that \npeople will act like bystanders if they consider themselves anonymous parts of \na large group. Larger games present each player and Storyteller with a zillion \nthings to attend to and do, more than enough to feel less accountable to the \nentire game than a group of seven would. Players and Storytellers have to be \naware of the bystander effect and how it affects a LARP. \nIt is also true that people feel that they need to do less individually as the \ngroup size grows. One reason is “social loafing.”That is, the players feel less likely \nto be evaluated by others because they are in a larger group. Another reason is \nthe “free rider effect” in which people believe that someone else is likely to solve \nthe problem first so they do not try themselves. Both of these behaviors increase \nthe percentage of players who rely on Storytellers for providing plots in larger \nand larger games. This claim seems at odds with the fact that having more \ncharacters leads to more character-driven plots. What is really happening in a \n"

Furthermore, \nsimplifying the rules, decreasing the number of challenges called for by the rules, \ndecreasing the complexity of rule-to-rule interaction and making rules easy to \nmemorize can decrease the need of players to rely on Storytellers. \nAnother social dynamic that governs large games is the “risky shift effect.” \nWhen excitement gets high, people in large groups tend to feel that their actions \nwill meet with fewer consequences, so they attempt to do more outlandish stuff. \nIn live-action roleplaying, this behavior results in more challenges per player in \nlarger groups than smaller groups. The number of challenges increases exponen- \ntially as both the number of players and challenges per player goes up. Each of \nthe challenges has the potential to require a Storyteller or require looking up \nrules or require many other breaks in roleplaying. Therefore, it is better to \ndecrease the potential number of challenges to improve game flow for larger \ngroups. The risky shift effect also causes players to act in less predictable and \nmore diverse ways with their characters in large games or on large email lists. It \nalso means that some characters will hop on the fast-moving bandwagon just for \nthe thrill. Storytellers and other players have to plan and compensate for the fact \nthat larger groups give rise to more diverse and bolder reactions than they would \nencounter in small groups. \nH o w  STORYTELLERS \nBREAK \nThe two problem areas for Storytellers lie in setting up the chronicle and \nrunning the game. That covers just about everything, right? Setting up a large \ngame or a multi-city chronicle is a difficult task. In small LARPs, the players can \nselect what they want within the Storyteller’s comfort zone. Because the players \nand Storytellers in a seven-person game are able to negotiate and define the \nentire world themselves, character creation and setting are much different than \na game with many cities. When 70 players are involved, the World of Darkness \nratios play a role in character creation. The conventions of the genre start to \nunravel when the Lasombra untitribu outnumber the Brujah two-to-one. Simi- \nlarly, any deviation from the actual place and time in which the players are \ninvolved has to be explained meticulously to large groups. Imagine the out-of- \nplay disaster that happens when the group patrolling the park accidentally \ncomes into the same play area as the group hunting in the forest, and it takes \nseveral rounds to figure out that the groups are not in the same place in character. \nMulti-city chronicles require an even higher level of attention to initial \ncharacters and setting, especially if the chronicle adds players as it goes. Rules \nfor character type distribution, setting variations and using places that are not \nin any of the participating cities have to be worked out between all the \nStorytellers. It is terribly embarrassing when a new city joins a multi-city \nchronicle with a great background only to find out that the new city was a war \nzone in the existing chronicle. \n"

      "text": "Large games also seem to suck Storytellers into the most protracted \nproblems and challenges. As the number of players increases, the diversity of \nproblems that are possible also increases. Instead of regulating story flow, the \nhigher number of challenges and higher chance for mass combat in large games \nstakes a claim on the Storytellers’ time. \nC A N  \nYou REALLY \nEIX ALL THIS \nSTUEE? \nYes. To be completely honest, and with apologies to Murphy, not everything \nthat can go wrong will go wrong. Most of the problems for large games or multi- \ncity chronicles stem from two sets of core elements. The first set of problems can \nbe addressed with a supplement to the MET rules. These problems are the \ncomplexity of the rules, the escalating number of challenges in a large game, \nambiguity in the rules and inconsistencies in the expectations of the participants. \nThe second set of problems can be addressed with procedures and technology. \nThese problems include lack of information management, lack of support for \nStorytellers’ auxiliary needs and lack of planning for plot contingencies. \nM O R E  RULES? \nNo. Fewer. Before I get too much further along, I want to say that I’m not \nwriting the actual supplement for your specific game or chronicle. That’s for you \nto do. I want to show you the areas in which you can eliminate or simplify rules \nwhile still using the MET system. The Camarilla club has a supplement that \naddresses its needsfor the global, 24/7, live-action and internet chronicle it runs \nbetween 250 cities on four continents. That supplement might not be too \nhelpful if you are planning a 120-person one-shot convention LARP. The thing \nto keep in mind, whether you are thinking about the Camarilla supplement or \nyour own, is that new players will expect to recognize the rules you are using. In \nsome cases, they’ll ask you to justify why you are using those rules, and it’s good \nto be able to answer. (Hint: Show them this article!) \nSo, here is the punch line on rules: \nLarge games should use a few, simple, easy-to-memorize rules that minimize \nthe number of challenges and minimize offensive power. \nNeed a few examples of where you can trim? Anything that can be done to \neliminate the need for referring to a character sheet should be done. Players in \ncomplex costumes who are engaged in roleplay should not have to drag character \nsheets out of their pockets, let alone have to find a pencil to mark on those sheets. \nAn ingenious character sheet design can make things that have to be marked off \nlike Blood, Willpower, Gnosis and Glamour Traits, not to mention health levels, \neasy to mark off without unfolding. Other things necessary for challenges should \nbe easy to remember, such as using numbers instead of Trait names or relying on \npermanent Trait totals for challenge-resolution instead of temporary Trait totals. \nGame mechanics that interrupt roleplaying should be minimized. For \nexample, the Camarilla uses White Wolfs table-top rules as a basis for Auspex \nversus Obfuscate challenges in its vampire LARPs; the higher level of Auspex \npierces the lower level of Obfuscate automatically. This change minimizes the \nnumber of across-the-room challenges because players hold up the number of \nfingers for the level of Obfuscate or Auspex they’re using, and everyone knows \nwith minimal challenges who can see whom, or who cannot be seen. This idea \n"

      "text": "____ - \n~ \nTry to reduce the number of tests that the rules require. Streamline mass \ncombat when the outcome looks clear. For instance, the 50-on-five mob scene \ncan be resolved with everyone pointing once and holding up a sign once. The \nStoryteller then narrates the results of the entire battle without further chal- \nlenges save death blows. Combat in the MET system is always slow, and it takes \na charismatic ST to control the room and get things done efficiently any time \n15+ characters are involved. \nStandardization helps in large games. There are a few examplesof the way that \nMET rules can have multiple interpretations, so make rules calls so that all \nStorytellers will be consistent. Some of the problem points that the Camarilla has \nfound are the way that Awareness was written, the way Rapidity was written and the \nway Dominate was written. What is the Awareness retest? Does the multiple-action \npenalty still apply when a character uses Rapidity? Does the one retest mentioned \nin theDominate descriptionrefer only toone Willpowerretest, or one retestperiod? \nYou’ll find others as your Storytellers make rulings in your game. \nAlso, rules that help set the expectations of the participants are good \nadditions for large games. For instance, the character types, powers or Merits \nwith the best game effects will be the most numerous in large games, despite what \nthe World of Darkness calls for. If players make their own characters, simple and \nfair rules for regulating rarity are a must. \nIn multi-city chronicles, minimizing offensive power is generally a good \nthing. High offense is great for one-shot convention games, but it’s bad for a \nlong-running chronicle in which players travel through terrae incognitae four \ntimes a year. Cities or regular travel circuits tend to develop a pulse that helps \ntheir character interaction along. Often, the players have characters of about \nthe same power level, they understand each others’ habits, and they tolerate \neach others’ flaws. Going outside that travel circuit places those characters at \nserious risk, so it is best to take steps to see that the beating the characters can \nget will not be a fatal one. Eliminate one-shot kills. Select the least damaging \noptional rules in the MET books. Think about the weapons you allow in your \nchronicle. Don’t compound aggravated damage. Reduce the effects of powers \nand Merits that give certain characters excessive advantages over others, both \nto discourage every character having the same set of Merits and to discourage the \nrise of unbeatable Narrator characters. For instance, the Herd Background for \nvampires is incredibly powerful in a chronicle that runs 24 hours, seven dam a \nweek, and it should be toned down. \nOther things that can get difficult in multi-city chronicles are supernatural \neffects that work over a distance. Powers that allow clairvoyance effects should \nbe regulated because they can cause time freezes or delays in getting information \nthat characters should have immediately. \nO T H E R  HELPFUL PROCEDURES \nLarge games and multi-city chronicles need good policies and procedures for \nmanaging information, supporting Storytellers and handling plot contingencies. \nTechnology has provided many ways for Storytellers and players to distribute \ninformation quickly. In larger games, it is often a good idea for Storytellers to get \nLARGE \nGAMESAND \nL o ~ q  \nCHRONICLES \n"

Storytellers can set up email lists for Influence \ninformation and expenditures, rules-call archiving, actions that affect the World \nof Darkness; whatever information might be necessary for you to communicate to \nmany others. Web pages are great ways to keep all game participants up to speed. \nEverything from game times and places, character biographies to information \nabout setting and rules, and even tips about how to get more involved in the game \nare helpful additions to large games and chronicles. \nToo much information can also be a problem. As the person who has been \nwriting a quarterly summary of the North American chronicle for the vampire \ngenre of the Camarilla (about 4000 players), I can tell you about information \noverload. Finding the appropriate level of information for your Storytellers and \nplayers is very important. Some Storytellers will need more information about \nparticular things like Influences, plot details or monumental actions taken by \ncharacters. Reporting to each other becomes a necessity for multi-city chronicles. \nSpeaking of administration, auxiliary Storyteller support helps a great deal \nin larger games and chronicles. Having a person who helps settle disputes \nbetween players keeps all the Storytellers on the floor during the game. Other \ntypes of non-Storyteller assistance -finding sites, doing web work, writing and \ncommunicating - \ncan also help. \nUS IN^ PSYCHOLO~Y \nA N D  C U N N I N ~ T O  \nPLANEOR \nB V E R Y T H I N ~  \nUsing psychology and cunning to plan for everything is perhaps the best key \nto a great game. In large games, plans must include character-driven plots, lulls \nin the story, players who rely on the Storytellers to inspire them, risky character \nbehavior and other players jumping on the bandwagon that others set in motion. \nA common saying in large games is that a player must also act partially as a \nStoryteller. Character-driven plots take on great force in a larger game or multi- \ncity chronicle. The Storytellers lose direct control over the majority of plot lines \nthat enter the game. \nWith respect to character-driven plots, Storytellers become plot modera- \ntors. They watch and police, using the World of Darkness and its long-standing \ncharacters to regulate the machinations of the characters. Storytellers can divert \nand redirect character plots by introducing higher-priority tasks like a visiting \ndignitary or serious attack. Altering the priority of a character-driven plot is \nuseful if a player is not restraining her character well, but don’t do it too often. \nPlayers become resentful, and they may even stop trying to put their characters’ \nagenda into play if they get stonewalled too often. Try to listen to the discussion \nthat your players have before, after and long after the game. Are they getting \nwhat they want? \nStorytellers can use less overwhelming plots to regulate character plots. \nPutting a situation in play that competes for the plotting character’s attention \nis a nice tactic, and you can also learn something about the goals of the character \nand motivations of the player. Characters who usually attend to the Storyteller \nplots over their own plots can help build momentum for other characters. \n"

All it takes is \na little bit of material to move the character forward when a lull occurs. Be \nshrewd, learn the habits of the key players in your large game. You can also \nintroduce competing plots with the intention of drawing off some of the \ncharacters working for a lead character who is progressing too quickly. These \ntypes of “control-rod plots” are a great way to draw out stories based oncharacter- \ndriven plots that are sometimes fulfilled quickly. \nIf character-driven plots are moving the story along well, the Storyteller can \nsometimes introduce a minor side-plot to involve the few characters not already \ntaking part in the action. Introduce these “sweeper plots” carefully, though, so that \nthe characters without anything to do take the lead. You can then build that plot \ninto something that will take over in the inevitable lull that character-driven plots \nare so susceptible to. Just make sure that the secondary plot takes over the large- \ngroup action only when the character-driven plots are beginning to wane. \nCharacter-driven plots are delicate. They require a light touch and a strong \ncommitment to helping a large number of players get the most enjoyment out \nof the scenes. Be cautious that you are spending the most time moderating the \ncharacter-driven plots that incorporate lots of other players. It is easy to get \ncaught up in the development of a personal plot for a character because of the \nrewarding roleplaying and progress that you get to see, but Storytellers at large \ngames have to watch the whole game and foster the larger story. \nPlayers can also help keep a game interesting by developing character-driven \nplots. By taking the character’s goals and translating them into action in the game, \neach player becomes a catalyst for story. As more characters get involved in the \ncharacter-driven plots, the driving character will experience more roleplaying. \nBeware, though, that marching straight in with a new character and lots of 50- \nplayer plots in your character’s mind will be a disappointing experience. Take the \ntime to build some relationships between characters and form some ties that allow \nfor the larger plots. In some instances, it can take a year or more to integrate your \ncharacter’s agenda into a chronicle in such a way that he can interact effectively \nwith 50 other characters in one project. \nGETTING R I D  O E  LULLS \nAside from using moderation techniques on character-driven plots to \nalleviate lulls in the story at a large game, Storytellers can raise the intensity of \nbackground plots. Doing so is similar to the idea behind bringing a sweeper plot \ninto the limelight when character-driven plots slow down. Background plots \ncan come from a host of little plots that the characters in the game have \nforgotten about. It is good to make sure that each Storyteller at a large game has \none or two of those background plots in mind as well as a prop or character that \ncan kick off the plot. Using background plots in this way brings a sense of \ncontinuity to the game, and it results in a lot of players trying to remember what \nhappened before to set the plot in motion. \nTo set up background plots, have several Storytellers introduce plots in \nthrees for the first few games in a chronicle. Then, strengthen the plots that the \ncharacters respond to and let the ignored plots fall to the wayside deliberately. \nWrite down the forgotten plots.

If things went well, they’ll just shrug and move on, but if the \nsituation went poorly, regret sets in. Talking to players who messed up in front \nof a group if you have the chance. Help them to see how the setting world and \nthe other characters respond to that sort of thing. Usually, it just takes a positive \nperspective to help players see that, while their actions may seem like huge \nscrew-ups, they’re actually just giving birth to new stories. \nI call the phenomenon that arises from this perspective the “soap opera \neffect.” Nothing exciting would happen on a soap opera if the characters didn’t \nget caught doing all the bad stuff that they do. Similarly, the story in a LARP \nimproves for a number of characters when their characters’ machinations \nbecome the object of inquiry. People follow the muddiest political battles and \nthe most outrageous court cases because it interests them and gives them \nsomething to talk about. Characters making large mistakes in front of huge \ngroups can have this same, glorious effect. \nIn fact, some players believe in the soap opera effect so much that they make \nin-character mistakes with their favorite characters deliberately. They use their \ncharacters to drop hints about bigger plots and then backtrack with guilty \nobviousness at times. Some players advocate getting your character into all sorts \nof sordid little plots that could provide a minor scandal at a large game. After you \nteach yourself to appreciate the story that you can create, it’s kind of fun to stir \nup the mud on purpose. Oh, and your character has to catch a few others at their \ndastardly deeds and expose those rascals. It’s an obligation to the story, of course. \nThe bandwagon effect is a bit harder to manage, and it really requires that \nyou have contingency plans as Storytellers.

Such a role demands a correspondingly creative mind \nand some in-depth roleplaying on the player’s part. Obviously, meeting this demand \nisn’t always easy, even for the best garners. Sometimes, players come instead to see \ntheir characters as little more than tragically hip humans with a range of special \ntalents and a few really killer allergies. In turn, this misconception robs some of the \nmystery and drama from a character’s supernatural existence and generally turns the \ngame from modem myth to more of a Gothic superhero comic. \nThis article’s goal is to help give players a gut-level sense of what it really feels \nlike to walk as one of the Awakened.

Even fae magic still operates according to rules, however bizarre \nor arcane those rules might be. Most powers take some concentration or ritual; many \nrequire the expenditure of vital energies. Most importantly, aU powers require some \ntime to practice and master, even those that a character acquires instinctively. \nIf your character is a vampire or a wraith, he was once human, but now \nhe’s dead. He may linger on in some new, shadowy existence, but underneath it \nall lies the fact that he cheated final judgment; that he simply should not be. \nIf your character is a shapeshifter or a faerie, she was never human to \nbegin with. She looked like one for a while, and she might think like one \nstill, but like it or not, she was born of a different species.

By contrast, the vampire \nregisters a knife’s cut, but ordinary pain is replaced by a instinctive fear for his \nunlife combined with arising feeling of, “How dare she hurt me! ?” In game terms, \nboth are suffering the same Trait penalties due to the distraction of their wounds, \nbut the sensation vampires experience is quite different. \nPAIN \nDRINKING \nOnce he is able to overcome his revulsion and disgust at what he is doing, a \nvampire experiences each mortal from whom he drinks as a unique “vintage.” The \nyoung are energy embodied, and their blood flows sweet and bright, while the \nelderly are usually sluggish and heavy with an almost flat taste. Mortals who have \njust exercised (or run or fought) have an adrenaline tang to them, while those \nsleeping have a low warmth instead, like a soothing cup of tea.

What’s more, your senses all hit overload at once. You’re awash in smells you \nhadn’t caught, sounds you hadn’t heard, sights you couldn’t see before. The pain of \nshapeshifting is short but sharp. It’s a good pain that clears your head and sharpens \nyour will. It puts all senses on alert and readies you for battle or the hunt. Most of the \ntime, all of this happens in six seconds or less.

For one \nthing, your entire center oflalance is slung low and evenly distributed along your body, \nallowing for quick, coordinated movements, and making it very hard to budge you if \nyou’re so inclined. Also, all your limbs are equally important. Tool-users that they are, \nthis arrangement takes most humans a while to get used to. Sights are limited a bit by \nyour lower vantage point, but the rich scents and tastes found near the ground more \nthan make up for it.

However, the Garou must endure \nall the normal unpleasantness of healing, just in a much shorter amount of time than \nothers do. Bones grind and knit back together, punctured lungs drain fluid, guardian \ncells attack infections and diseases, tom muscles sew up, and new skin spreads to \ncover missing patches. It’s painful, but the pain fuels the Rage that helps the Garou \nheal. The pain is Gaia’s way of ensuring that her guardians stay as healthy as possible. \n“At first you think, ‘This is stupid, I’m just staring at my reflection,’ but then \nyou feel this cold shiver down your spine, you know?

Chimera seem frightening and strange; putting names \nto faces becomes a real chore, even with close friends and oathmates; reminisc- \ning on times past, be they good or ill, is an exercise in tearful frustration. \nFinally, the changeling can’t remember who sh is, what her place is in this \nstrange world or why she’s seeing the things she is, and she simply drops out of \nthe chimerical world. Her Banal mind chooses to ignore what she is no longer \ncapable of understanding. \nWRAITH: \nTHE OBLIVION \n~ A I N I N J L O S I N B  PATHOS \nGaining Pathos from positive feelings can only be compared to those sublime \nmoments in life when you feel like you could live on an emotion alone, that if you \nfelt it any more intensely your heart would simply soar away and burst into a \nbrilliant shower of fireworks. It’s a tangible pulse formed from the moment when \nyou look into someone’s eyes and think to yourself, “I think I could lift the world \nand live forever, if they asked me to.” Pathos gained from negative feelings, on the \nother hand, is a concentrated morsel of the icy, rotten surge of pleasure that you \nreceive when you drag a hated rival through the mud or witness the anguish on a \nformer lover’s face when your words open their old wounds afresh. \nLosing Pathos is just the opposite. It’s the empty, spent feeling that comes \nwhen you’ve given everything you have to give, or the chill, listless void that \nreplaces the heart when one’s beloved breaks the bond for the final time. \nMemory of the passion remains, at once comforting and painful, but that is all. \n~ A I N I N $  LOSING \nANGST \nAngst gained whispers, “You have come all this way and suffered and felt \nso much, but it’s all for nothing, nothing, NOTHING.” Different from the \nenergizing if wicked rush that is gained from negative Pathos, Angst is a \ncrippling, burning poison of the soul. It rockets through the character like a \nbullet train of sickening despair until it reaches the deepest recesses of the heart. \nThere it crashes in an explosion of defeat and shame, leaving a festering, oozing \nwound on the psyche. No matter how much Pathos you lose or gain, Angst \nremains the mocking voice of nothingness beneath it all. It laughs and reminds \nyou always that come rise or fall, the void is ever watching.. . and ever hungry. \nAngst lost surpasses in intensity only a dozen or so things: an eleventh-hour \npardon for the condemned, a joyous reconciliation for the broken-hearted, a \nChristmas armistice for the weary soldier, a child born to the previously barren. \nRegardless, the underlying truth is the same. The void can be defeated, the soul \ncan triumph, and existence can be everlasting and glorious. \nSTEP PIN^ T H R O U G H  SOMETHINC~ \nSOLID \n“It’s a weird mix, man. When you first touch something solid from the other \nside, there’s this really intense, really plastic feeling, like your skin’s trying to \nmorph around it instead of going through.

I went from too fat, too prudish, too \nnerdy and too casual to being too thin, too popular, too slutty and too snobby. \nStrange as it sounds, being Moliated is a lot like that. You watch as someone else’s \nhands take your soul and twist it into whatever shape they want.

Most \nI places in that area are rowhouses, though, so if you can’t find that specific one, see \nifyoucangetaplanforthattypeofhouse. We’llstructureourstrategy to workaround \nI any alterations it might’ve made if needs be. Valentine, escort him, same as before.” \nChambers was making his usual rounds, the casual authority they’d granted \n1 \nhim full in his voice. He’d been a Marine for 10 years before starting this \nludicrous crusade, and everyone deferred to him when it came to planning an \nactual attack. “Last but not least -Kurt, you and Kevin mind holding down the \nfort while we’re away?” Sounds of agreement all around. Chambers grinned, \nreaching for the last of the lo mein. “Alright then, I’d say we’re ready to go. Nine \n1 o’clock sound good to everyone?” \nThe others winced a little, but Martin and sleep were old enemies now. “Fine \nby me,” he agreed, and the others voiced their assent behind him, not wanting to \nbe shown up by their oldest (and newest) member. That brought the official \n1 meeting to a close, and out came the ceiebratory alcohol. They didn’t drink too \nI much, of course, but they had enough to bring on a temporary feeling of release. \nI \n"

Pour oldguy, he figured \nthey were thinking. He’s crippled, and he still does m e  than his share. He didn’t want \nor need their pity. The only thing he wanted from them - \na reliable way out of this \ninsane life they led - \nwas something they couldn’t give him, no matter how they \nmomised to be trying to find it. No matter how much they’d done for him since he \njoined them, he Auidn.t help but hate them all a little when they pitied him. He \nwanted to go home, but they kept telling him that it wasn’t safe. They kept relying \non him to help them while they protected him, and they tried only occasionally to \nfind out what he had done to attract the ill attention of one of the undead. They \nconvinced him not to leave, yet they pitied him for still wanting to. \nAfter lying in bed thinking along those lines for nearly an hour, Martin still \nfelt nowhere near sleepy. Instead, he found himself groping through his knap- \nsack until he found the notebook he’d been using earlier that day. He flicked on \nthe bedside light so he could make out his looping handwriting. \nFrank Clark, the notes read. Hmmm. Nice anonymous name for a monster \nto hide under, totally unaware that it had been discovered. Thanks to Martin’s \ndogged research, his people knew where Mister Clark lived. In 48 hours, they \nwere going to make their move, and the monster didn’t even suspect. They knew \nits defenses and its disguises, and they were going to kill it. They were informed, \narmed and ready. They had been tracking this particular creature since before \nthe Allentown fiasco, and they were finally in a position to strike. \nafter they had left Greg behind with half his face blown off. Instead of a sleeping, \nundead monster, they had found no less than 10 armed men waiting for them, \nand Greg had been the first through the thing’s haven door. The rest of them had \nfled instantly, spattered with their comrade’s blood, bone and hair, but their \nescape was a narrow one. After everyone regrouped at the temporary safe house, \nthey nearly disbanded their crusade, even over Chambers’ enraged protests. \nThey would have gone their separate ways entirely if not for the fear that they \nwould be hunted down individually. \nAnd there was truth to the fears; after Allentown, they had been unable \nto deny that at least one of the monsters was aware of who they were and was \ntracking them. Martin’s hindsight wondered at how they could’ve been so \nfoolish as to be believe that word of their efforts wouldn’t travel eventually. \nAllentown had been a trap, pure and simple, and although they’d managed to \nget everyone except Greg out alive, there was no need for anyone to point out \nthat they couldn’t possibly be so lucky next time. They didn’t even know what \nthey’d done to give themselves away the last time, and the one who’d \nuncovered them was still out there. \nWhat if this is your time? the nagging voice in Martin’s mind demanded. How \nsure are you that the information you found isn’t exactly what the monster wanted you \nto find? If you don’t kill this thing that calls itself Clark, you’ll all be dead. No use in \ndenying it. Even if you do destroy it, though, how long until another one picks up your \ntrail? You don’t even know how many are on to you. What, you think the other \ncreaturesaregoingtocorneout, shakehands, say ‘Wellplayed andlet youoffthefield? \nThat’s crazy and you know it. \n"

He knew it wasn’t too healthy, talking to himself like that, but ever \nsince Greg had died he’d worked through his feelings by making them into an \nadversarial inner dialogue. Besides, if a little indulgence like this helped keep \nhim mostly sane in the long term, he was more than happy to put up with it. “I’m L,- \nDon’t be an idiot.

He, Kevin and Valentine would go through the front door, \nwhile Kurt and Denise swept through the back exit and Martin would wait in the \nvan, which would be idling and ready to roll as soon as the last team member jumped \nin. Out of arrogance or stupidity, the monster lived alone, so they would go in before \nsundown, cut the thing’s head off and torch its home before it even woke up. \nAttacking in daylight upped their risk of being spotted and recognized, but the idea \nwas preferable to that of facing one of these things after dark.

All he had to do was ditch the van somewhere and call a cab to take him \nhome. Not a safehouse or a dingy hotel that accepted only cash. Home. His \nhome. He’d need a convincing lie to explain where he’d been for so long, but he \ncould think of that later.

As happy \nas he was, should he really go upstairs right then? He’d surely scare the life out \nof his wife and daughter if he did. He looked like a monster that was falling apart, \nand that was nothing to wake up to in the dead of night. Plus, what if Carol and \nJesse didn’t even want to see him?

At once Martin’s heart became a block of ice. He could \nactually feel the muscle clench like a stalled pendulum; pregnant with motion and \nyet unmoving. The voice was as hot as his blood was cold, and hate sparked from \nit like fire seeds drifting from a lava flow. The presence of such strong emotion was \nalien to the sound, but Martin recognized the voice immediately. \nIt was Valentine. \nWell shit, Martin, his voice of reason whispered lamely. \n“Wake them up now, give them heart failure?” Valentine continued, \ncoming no closer, “or sit on the porch and play with yourself until morning, \nhoping that the sight ofyou indaylight won’t drop yourpretty wife inher tracks?” \nValentine stepped forward into the pool of streetlight illumination that \ncame in through the window from outside.

A long, superficial cut trailed out from under the makeshift pressure- \nbandage and split his earlobe in half. Chambers appeared in the door behind \nhim, leaning on a shotgun as a crutch. A cinched belt squeezed his left leg just \nbeneath the crotch, choking off a bad cut in the middle of his thigh. Both men \ncame toward Martin with fire in their eyes. \n“Love of God,” Martin managed to gasp, speaking as slowly and softly as \npossible so as not to wake up his family. “I thought you were dead!

Chambers’ eyes were glassy and \nunfocused, but he held the shotgun steadily. He propped it up on the step beside \nhim and pointed the business end at Martin. \n“I’m going to kill him, Val,” the man said. \n“Quiet,” Valentine said over his shoulder. “I told you no.” \nMartin had never seen Valentine like this.

Now, he was a man possessed. \n‘Valentine listen,” Martin said, raising his good arm warily. “What I did-” \n“I said don’t lie to me!”Valentine shouted. Shouting ripped the inside of his \nsavaged throat raw, and he coughed up a wad of bloody phlegm for his effort. \nWhen he spoke again, it was in a whisper. “Clark told us everything, you piece \nof shit.

      "text": "ANTAGONISTS THAT MATTFR \nd \nby David Tancredi \nRegardless of its scope, depth or genre, every story has the same basic \ningredients. Each tale follows a viewpoint character. Every character strives to \nattain some goal. Some obstacle always stands in the way of any worthwhile goal. \nThe action of any story that can rightly call itself a story includes the character \novercoming the obstacle in order to achieve his goal. In many stories- especially \nin stories told through live-action roleplaying - \nthe obstacle in question is \nrepresented by a dynamic, thrilling antagonist. An antagonist makes an obstacle \nof himself by either striving to reach the viewpoint character’s goal first himself or \nby doing everything he can to keep the viewpoint character from reaching it at all. \nCreating thrilling adversaries on a regular basis isn’t easy, though. It takes \ntime to develop an opponent that can challenge players. Care must be taken to \nensure that antagonists don’t overrun the current story, overpower the troupe \nor draw the spotlight away from players. When you, as a Storyteller, bring an \nantagonist to life successfully, you add an intriguing new personality to the game. \nOne that will inspire interest in the current story and attract new players. \nIn recent years, a large number of types of antagonist have been converted \nto the Mind’s Eye Theatre system. Storytellers can choose from a variety of \ndenizens of the World of Darkness and inject into their games whichever ones \nwork best for the story. While it’s hardly exhaustive, the following list shows \ngives advice on how to use the various types of antagonists to their best effect in \nyour live-action chronicles. \n(Keep in mind, though that what type of monster an antagonist is shouldn’t \nbe what carries its importance to the story. A strong antagonist will carry itself \nwhether it’s a Sabbat vampire, a Spectre, a fomori or a mortal. A poorly \nconceived antagonist will not be redeemed as a story ingredient just because it \nis Kuei-jin or a Pentex employee. Determining the type of antagonist to use is \none of the last steps in the creation process, and many other choices must be \nmade long before any statistics get written.) \nVAM \np I R E S  \nCAMARILLA \nA N D  SAB \nB A T  \nOne of the main conflicts that exists in aLaws of the Night chronicle is that \nbetween the Camarilla and the Sabbat sects. The ideologies of these two societies \nare completely incompatible. The Sabbat revels in its inhumanity and believes \nfirmly that the Camarilla is a front for the manipulations of the Antediluvians. \nAlternatively, the Camarilla is convinced that vampires can survive the Final \nNights by hiding behind the Masquerade and holding onto some semblance of \nhumanity. On a more base level, Camarilla and Sabbat vampires oppose each \nother for resources like territory and food. Whoever controls the distribution of \nfood in a given area retains the power, and the sects come together internally more \nto protect their resources than to butt heads over ideological disagreements. \nThat aside, however, vampires are nothing if not masters of self-delusion. \nCenturies of conflict and top-down micro-management have created loneheld \n"

      "text": "stereotypes in each sect about the other. Since the Anarch Revolt centuries ago, \nsurviving Camarilla elders have been telling their new childer that the Sabbat \nare honorless hooligans who crave only elderblood and reprehensible diablerie. \nConversely, the Sabbat have always preached that participants in the Camarilla’s \nsystem feudal slavery are hypocritical pawns of the Antediluvians who would \njust as soon throw a beloved childe to the wolves as defend themselves and their \nchilder. These impressions are set so firmly in the vampiric experience, that they \naffect the way Sabbat and Camarilla antagonists react to members of their rival \nsect. While slavish devotion to type becomes predictable and boring, a Story- \nteller would be remiss to discount these impressions out of hand. \nSabbat vampires believe that they are monsters, but it is important not to \ntreat them as that alone. Sabbat packs are more than tools to incite combat. \nOnly physically oriented characters get involved in senseless fighting, and \nencouraging too much of that kind of conflict alienates the players who prefer \nless overt pursuits. As an antagonist force, the Sabbat is a much more complex \nand organized sect than would seem apparent from the behavior of the average \nWar Party. With proper preparation, Sabbat vampires can creep subtly into a \nCamarilla city, and then overrun it when the time is right. While their methods \nand perspective are different, canny Sabbat elders understand the value of using \nInfluence and manipulation against their mortal herds. They also know how to \nattack the holdings and resources of their enemy in such a way that leaves him \npowerless before an assault. Carefully staged attacks of Sabbat rabble-rousers \ndraw attention away from more subtle and insidious maneuvers. Those players \nthat decide to refrain from combat still have an opportunity to interact with the \nstory by discovering the real motivation for an attack. Those Camarillists who \nhave been treated poorly by the Camarilla hierarchy must also test their faith \nagainst cunning Sabbat recruiters who would rather make allies than enemies. \nCamarilla vampires make equally compelling antagonists as well. They do \nnot bide their time in their lavish havens, sitting in repose and drinking \nbloodewyne. Nor do they sit idly by while Sabbat vampires assault their cities. \nThey fortify their havens, manipulate mortal forces within cities for their \ndefense and even engage in counter-strikes against invading vampires. In \nsecuring resources and expanding their power base, ambitious (or ballsy) \nCamarilla Kindred are not averse to invading Sabbat territory themselves. They \ndo so differently (i.e., far more subtly) than Sabbat invaders do, but the threat \nis still very real. Defeating a Camarilla antagonist takes perception, wit, \ndetermination and ferocious cunning. \nK I N D R E D O E T H E  \nEAST \nA new enemy marches against the children of Caine in the World of \nDarkness.

When compared to Kindred and Sabbat, these Eastern \nvampires have a radically different philosophy on their place in the world. They \nfeed differently, they relate to one another differently, and they exist for a \npurpose that few western vampires can understand.

      "text": "appropriately, of course, in order to do it justice beyond the stereotype. \nINEBRNALISTS \nInfemalist vampire characters make occasional appearances in live-action \nvampire games as antagonists as well. The topic of Infemalism helps players and \nStorytellers explore issues of absolute good and evil, especially when the story calls \nfor a clear distinction between the two. Vampires of both sects and even the Kuei- \njin all have problems with those who have sold their souls to Hell’s legions, and \nInfemalists themselves have few redeeming qualities. Allied with the legions of \nHell, an Infemalist can truly put a character’s faith and conviction to the test. \nUnfortunately, conflicts against Infemalists reflect the broader issues of spiritual- \nity, humanity, corruption and common evil poorly. When an antagonist starts \nsprouting horns and singing the praises of Satan, it’s pretty easy to see what side \nshe’s on. While opposing evil for the sake of opposing evil does make for a fun \ngame, you can tell a more compelling and intense story by blurring the absolute \nboundaries of morality and forcing characters to choose where they stand. \n9 \nB N E  R I C  VAMP \nI R E  ANTAC~ONI \nSTS \nRegardless of their internecine distinctions, vampires make great antagonists \njust by virtue of being monsters. Boiled down to their essential story elements, \nvampires are undead monsters who drink human blood. They represent humanity’s \nfear of the dark and of the dark places in the human mind itself. While they seem \nhuman and even genteel to casual inspection, an uncontrollable feral half lurks \nbehind the predatory gleam in their eyes. They’ll stop at nothing to make themselves \nsafe and keep themselves fed. This self-serving determination and ruthless instinct \nmakes vampires of all stripes femme and deadly opponents in any chronicle. \nW E  \nREWO LVE s \nIn many werewolf chronicles, Fomori, Black Spiral Dancers, Banes and \nother Wyrm-spawn get lumped under one banner mistakenly. It’s important to \nlook at each type of antagonist a werewolf character might face, in order to use \nit to its best effect in a story. You should also keep in mind that “minions of the \nWyrm” are not the only compelling antagonists out there. \nBLACK SPIRAL \nDANCERS \nAs former members of the Garou Nation, Black Spiral Dancers have an \nintimate understanding of werewolf culture and lore. They know how to invoke \nfear in a steadfast Ahroun, and they can corrupt the purest Silver Fang. Black \nSpirals are not howling beasts that rise up from their tunnels, attack without any \nstrategy, then retreat back into the dark.

The company exists to spread the \ntaint of the Wyrm to the common man by wrapping it up in attractive packages. \nThe company provides modem luxury and convenience with nary an apparent \ndown-side, and yet every product carries a subtle hint of the Corrupter’s taint. \nBut how does one fight tooth and claw against paper and marketing?

They’re not strong enough individually to take on a \nCrinos Ahroun, but groups of them can still cause plenty of trouble. Alas, orcs \nin fantasy games get more character development than fomori. Fomori are \ntortured souls that go through unimaginable suffering. They’re desperate to \nsurvive in a world where their own lives have no value. This desperation makes \nthem truly dangerous. Fomori can become versatile antagonists. They can be \nmolded with different powers and abilities to get any job done. It is important \nnot to overlook the usefulness of fomori when creating long-term opponents \nagainst the Garou. \nSPIRITS \nMany different types of spirits exist in the Umbra. A few are helpful, others \nare mischievous, and even more aid the Wyrm’s corruption. Spirits fill specific \nniches in the Umbral ecology, and their story utility is more that of obstacles \nrather than specific antagonists. \n"

The magic they engage in involves \nconvincing the Masses that this view is correct and demonstrating as much \nthrough technological advances and miracle breakthroughs in all fields of \nscience. Since its inception, the Technocracy has done a superb job of making \nthe people of Earth accept its paradigm. \nDespite its noble goals, however, the Technocracy is responsible for agents \nwho make compelling antagonists. Part of creating a worldwide consensual \nparadigm lies in enforcing that world-view, which calls for the containment and \n“correction” of any element that defies that view. Unfortunately, all supernatural \ncreatures are unacceptable divergences from the norm, and Reality Deviant mages \nare even less welcome. The very existence of the supernatural defies scientific \ncodification, and as such, it must be eliminated from the consensual reality. \nIn fact, anyone who opposes the Technocratic paradigm (or any part of it) \nmust eventually be eliminated from the consensus. The Technocratic vision for \nthe future is one of complete conformity and cooperation, in which everyone is \nsafe and well cared for thanks to the infallible arms of science. \nGeneric Technocrat antagonists include field operatives who prowl in search \nof “unacceptable” levels of deviance from the paradigmatic norm, Control \nscientists who must test their theories and creations on expendable samples of the \npopulation and less-than-human constructs created to supplement the efforts of \nthe other two. For the most part, Technocrat antagonists are more concerned with \nthe bottom line and the greater good than the needs of the individual. In the \nUtopian future, the individual has no significance anyway, right? \nTHE \nTRADITIONS \nThe Traditions have grown their own fair share of monsters. Greed and \npower are strong motivators among Awakened willworkers. Without proper \napprenticeship, proud mages are more likely to abuse their magic regardless of \nthe consequences. Even experienced mages cause trouble when their spells fail \nspectacularly or they simply feel like flexing their mental muscles. \nWhat’s more, many Tradition mages are caught up in the age-old Ascension \nWar. They stand up against Technocratic “tyranny” and assert that humanity \nhas just as much a right to accept and rely on the Supernatural as they do on \nscience. Humans should be allowed to make up their own minds and open \nthemselves up to the infinity of possibility that True Magic offers. As such, \nhowever, these mages are forced to take on people’s long-held reliance on the \nfoundation of scientific thought, and they have to rock the boat constantly. \nCharacters who are comfortable with the status quo don’t usually appreciate \nactions that amount to terrorism for its own sake. \nFurther compounding the problem is the fact that not every magical \nTradition agrees on what would make an ideal world. Each Tradition does magic \nin a different way, some of which are opposed to each other directly. Inter- \nTradition maneuvering for advantage in the Ascension War can generate just \nas much conflict as the war itself. Especially as older mages realize more and more \nclearly that the war to which they’ve given so much of themselves is all but \nhopeless. These embittered spell-weavers have grown desperate and canny, \nwhich makes them all the more dangerous. \n"

      "text": "MORTALS \nAn antagonist doesn’t need supernatural powers to be an awesome foe. In \nmany situations, a human with the right amount of influence, abilities and \nmoney is much better suited to achieve a goal than a supernatural creature. \nHumanity is the force that runs the World of Darkness, and supernatural \ncreatures all exist outside that force. Humans have numbers as well. A large \nindustrial city could hold 40-50 vampires, but a mortal crime lord could have \nhundreds of people working for him alone. While one human being isn’t much \nof a threat to, say, a rampaging werewolf, a large group of smart, well-armed \nhuman beings who have time to plan can put a careless werewolf in a world of \nhurt. Any vampire who wants to stake a claim on a citywide sphere of influence \nmust first deal with the humans who make it up. No supernatural creature can \nafford to discount the power humanity has over the modem world. \nC RBATI o N C ~ U  \nI DE LI N E  s \nWhen creating an antagonist for any genre or any chronicle, it’s important \nto give him areal personality. His personality determines how he does things and \nwhy and what lengths he’s willing to go to. An enemy who’s an enemy for the \nsake of enmity isn’t compelling or memorable - \nhe’s a monster of the week. \nCreating a complete person as an antagonist, one with whom some characters \ncan even sympathize, will establish that antagonist in the players’ memory as a \ncharacter rather than a collection of Traits with which to play Rock-Paper- \nScissors. Using the following guidelines will get you started. \nMOTIVATION \nIN- CHARACTER \nMOTIVATION \nDefining the motivation of an antagonist is the first step in his develop- \nment. The motives can be simple greed, envy, lust or self-preservation, or they \ncan be complex and hidden behind a web of deceit. The antagonist could be the \nunwitting pawn of a greater force, or he may be the greater force himself. \nWhatever the case is, the antagonist has no purpose without a motive. Real \npeople do things for reasons, no matter how bizarre, and the same is doubly true \nfor characters in stories. An antagonist’s purpose in a story is prevent the \ncharacters from reaching their goals, but he does not do so just for the sake of \ndoing so. His reasons for opposing the characters are what make him memorable \nas a character in his own right. \nThe motives also define the antagonist’s targets. It’s important to recognize \nearly in the creation process which opponents an antagonist will face. For \nexample, a vampiric Anarch bent on wreaking havoc in a Camarilla domain \nmay have to worry about the prince’s sheriff and deputies. By listing targets \nahead of time, the antagonist can prepare for future conflicts. The motivations \nof an antagonist help determine its targets as well. A simple lupine-hunting \nGangrel vampire should know better than to rush into a caern’s bawn and throw \ndown with the Warder. An Amalgam of Technocrat agents isn’t going to pursue \nvague suspicions that City Hall is run by vampires when the agents have veryreal \nproof that Reality Deviant mages are blowing up cancer-research laboratories. \n"

      "text": "Declaring the motivations of an antagonist helps determine its power level \nas well. An enemy who’s too strong for some might be too weak for others in the \nsame game, especially as the number of players gets larger. After creating a set \nof specific motives, think about how much power the antagonist needs to meet \nthose goals. Does a character need Methuselah-level vampiric Disciplines to \nstake his claim on the underworld? More likely, several levels of Influence and \nthe appropriate Abilities would be sufficient. \nDon’t go overboard assigning an antagonist’s power level as per his motiva- \ntion. Make antagonist characters powerful enough to have areasonable eqectation \nof achieving their goals; don’t stack powers upon powers to make the villain’s \nvictory a sure thing. Players deserve a fighting chance to overcome their \nadversary, after all. That’s where the action and drama in any good story comes \nfrom. The contest has to be close and always in question until the very end, \notherwise you won’t be able to maintain the players’ characters’ interest. \nO U T - O f -  C H A R A C T E R  MOTIVATION \nPopular opinion states that Storytellers create antagonists only to torment \nplayers. While that is an amusing benefit of the position, it is not the sole reason \nfor including adversarial characters. Storytellers have their own motivations \noutside of the needs of the story for incorporating antagonists in play. \nEach setting in the World of Darkness works on many levels and has a rich \nbackground. It is impossible for a Storyteller to incorporate everything in a \ngame, no matter how large the LARP is. However, antagonists can draw \nattention to certain aspects of a setting that may have been neglected up to that \npoint. In a Laws of the Wild chronicle, for instance, spirit antagonists focus a \nplayer’s mind on the Umbra as more than just an othenvorldy duck blind or \nshortcut, while Kinfolk antagonists deal with issues of community and fellow- \nship. When a theme has been missing from a game for too long, an antagonist \ncan bring it back to the forefront. Furthermore, an antagonist can emphasize the \ncore concepts within a setting by introducing players to ideas and possibilities \nthey wouldn’t normally consider. \nOther than directing the flow of agame as a whole, antagonists can alter the \ncourse of individual players and characters. By setting up situations that force \ncharacters to make tough decisions, an antagonist can direct the development \nand direction of certain players’ characters. If done well, players won’t even \nrealize that their characters are being set up to follow a particular path. \nInteracting with carefully selected types of antagonists can mold a player’s \nbehavior too. Given the option of butting heads against an antagonist or taking \na less attractive but easier route to success, most players choose the easy way out. \nGuiding players isn’t always a desirable option, but it can become necessary \nwhen they’re about to perform an act that would disrupt the game for everyone \nelse. Some players chafe at any type of restraint or scripting of events, but it goes \non all the time with players being none the wiser. Guidance and scripting are \nout-of-game keys to preventing long-running games from degenerating into \nchaos, and antagonists are excellent in-game tools for doing so. \nAntagonists are also good devices for introducing new, misused or unused \nsystem mechanics into a game. Having an antagonist exploit a game mechanic \npromotes the system in question and make her more difficult to defeat by conven- \n"

An antagonist who watches a chronicle’s vampire characters, learns their \nhabits and sore spots, then uses that information to play with the vampires’ minds \nin hopes of inciting self-destructive frenzies would present the system to players by \nforcing them to use it. Knowledge and understanding of these rules will then spread \nslowlyuntil they are commonknowledge. Given time, playerswillcome to recognize \nthese unfamiliar systems, freeing Narrators to work on other aspects of the game. \nThe only caveat about using antagonists in game to pursue out-of-game \nmotivations is to do so responsibly. While it is fair to plague a mage character \nwith the persistent attentions of an Amalgam of Technocrats when he’s going \ncrazy shooting fireballs around in public with no regard for safety or secrecy, it’s \nnot fair to create antagonists that hound a particular character just because you \nthink his player’s a jerk. Even if that player is a jerk, it’s still not fair to pick on \nhim. It’s also a bad idea to punish players’ characters with inordinately powerful \nbad guys because you think the players are playing their game the “wrong” way. \nAlways be fair when using in-game antagonists for out-of-game reasons. \nAfter determining the character’s motivation, it’s time to begin laying out \nthe particulars. Antagonists are people too, and they deserve to have as much \nattention lavished on them as any player’s character. What’s tricky about this \nstage of creating an antagonist is that it seems to fall out of sequence. You should \ndetermine the antagonist’s goal (i.e., his motivation) first so you’ll know where \nto put him in the story. Then, you have to go buck and create a background that \nlogically leads up to the character’s present state of mind. \nA detailed background is key to making the character appear realistic. It’s \nthe foundation on which everything about the antagonist is based. The \nbackground shapes the motivations, tactics, attitudes and appearance of the \nantagonist. Without a background to tie all of these sections together, the villain \nwon’t be muchof acharacter at all. Players won’t be able to understand how their \nfoe has developed if he’s just sprung half-formed from your mind into the game. \nIf players can’t understand their opponents, they certainly will not relate to \nthem or be able to interact with them in the meaningful, memorable ways you \nintend. What’s more, the person playing the antagonist will be lost without a \ngood sense of what made the character what he is. \nTACTICS \nWhen you’re plotting out what role an antagonist will play, you also need to \nspecify the ways an antagonist will pursue her goals. An antagonist can be \nconfrontational or subtle. She can take the hands-on approach or work through \nlackeys behind the scenes. The tactics a character uses depends on her motives, \nher targets and especially her abilities. An apostate troll is not going to walk into \na sidhe baron’s court and start randomly blasting away at the courtiers with twin \nColt .45s just so he can send everyone back home to Arcadia. He’d know that that \nis no way to accomplish his goal successfully. Define clearly the risks an antagonist \nwill take in pursuit of her motives. Antagonists don’t work in a vacuum either. \nWho are they willing to deal with and what can they offer potential allies? Does \nthe antagonist need a clear victory, or is partial success acceptable? \n"

Assassins prepare multiple escape routes in the event that one \nis compromised. Lawyers prepare multiple arguments against one another when \nthey battle in court. Technocrat agents study their enemies’ SOPS and arm \nthemselves accordingly. Put yourself in the mind of your antagonist and figure \nout what sort of friction he can reasonably expect from those who are likely to \nstand in his way. Then prepare him to face that friction to the best of his ability. \n(You should also consider out of game what friction your antagonist \ncharacter will face from the players themselves. Will they be resentful of being \nbeaten on occasion by a more powerful foe? Are certain players likely to shoot \nfirst and ask questions later, thus shafting your grand scheme before it begins? \nWill they accuse you of picking on them? Take all these considerations into \naccount when you’re making up an antagonist so you’ll be prepared for the \nplayers’ response. Don’t be afraid to send an antagonist into game just because \nthe players won’t like it - \nthey’re not supposed to like being challenged in \npursuit of their goals- but use your antagonists responsibly so that everyone can \nstill have fun.) \np RES e NTATI o N \nOne of the most overlooked components in creating an antagonist is the \npresentation. The performance of those playing the antagonist is generally given \nlittle thought. However, poor attention to the acting details can be the downfall \nof an otherwise great adversary. When players meet their opponent for the first \ntime, they’re not going to see the hours you spent creating his background and \nmotivations. The players are not going to know about the nefarious plots set \nagainst them. All they’ll have to go on is the first impressions the new character \nmakes. The word “theatre” wasn’t inserted into the title of the game system \naccidentally, after all. With the proper amount of practice, several tools can help \nconvey a convincing Performance. Two of the most important tools that are \noften overlooked are the character’s voice and his mannerisms. \nStart with thevoice. By choosingavoice, the antagonist has akeyfeature that \ndistinguishes it from other characters. Speak in a higher or lower tone. Add a \nforeign accent if it’s appropriate. Other than the sound of the voice, the way one \nspeaks is often noticeable. No one speaks perfect English, French or German for \nthat matter unless he has a reason for paying attention to his verbal grammar. A \nperson that has lived in the inner city will often have adifferent sentence structure \nand vocabulary than a character from suburbia. Think about a character’s \nbackground and consider how his life experiences make his voice distinctive. \nPaying attention to characters’ mannerisms is another facet of acting. Does \nthe character have a limp or other physical discrepancy from the norm? Does she \ntwitch when she gets nervous or pace when she’s forced to wait? Did that limp \nthe maniacal hunter walks with come from his first confrontation with a \nrampaging monster? Is that why he hunts monsters in the first place? Does that \nvampire smoke cigarettes like Andrew Dice Clay because he thinks it’s cool or \nbecause doing so reminds him of the one comedian who’s still able to make him \nlaugh since his violent embrace? Even a character’s most minor quirks come \nfrom somewhere, and making them noticeable makes the character’s themselves \n"

An even stranger twist on this scene is that of the occult scholar \nwho can explain the alien ways of any [World of Darkness] culture because \nhe’s “read about them before.” \nThe Squad: \nThis phenomenon has many names - \nthe whoop squad, the beat squad, \nthe gack squad, the hit squad -but \nit has one real meaning. What happens \nwhen one uses a squad in LARPing is that one character has a beef with \nanother character, so he rallies a group of like-minded thugs to his cause. \nHaving so rallied, the beefer then leads his thugs to wherever the beefee i s  \n(preferably under the power of Cloak the Gathering, or through a convenient \nUmbral shortcut), and he [and they] proceed to whip the ever-loving crap out \nof the beefee. The resulting nightmarish mass-combat scene takes about two \nhours to play out (depending on who jumps in on whose side), but the in-game \ntime the scene takes is about 15-45 seconds. \nThe Ratio: \nSupernatural creatures vastly outnumber the mundane denizens of the \nWorld of Darkness.

The Inquisition (unless the characters are supernatural creatures \nwho work for the Inquisition in their search for Golconda/ Transcendence/ \nAscension and have slipped in under the radar).

      "text": "LESSONS \nAnd what have I learned from these observations? Actually, I’ve learned \nquite a lot. (No, I didn’t just write all that in order to verbally lambaste the loyal \nreaders who’ve been helping pay my salary these last two years.) \nThe first is to never be too critical, especially in this “industry.” I first came \nat the Journal with the perspective that White Wolf is right, and other people \nare wrong. If somebody played the game differently than the way we recom- \nmended in a book, that person was wrong. If somebody ran a game that may as \nwell have been a dungeon-crawl of undead superheroes with fangs, that person \nwas wrong too. Basically, anyone who deviated in their gameplay from the \n“canonical” decrees of the home office (all in the name of villainous and \nilliterate “fun”) was a loser and a goob who deserved to be ostracized from the \nhut m o d  that is the gaming community. \nFortunately, I finally came around to realize that that attitude was the worst \nsort of undeserved snobbery. The people who are playing with our materials thus \nare still the people who are buying those materials. To say that they’re wrong \nimplies that they’re dumb. And it doesn’t take a team of rocket-scientist \nphilosopher kings to figure out that calling your customers dumb is a bad idea. \nIf they (or you, or I frankly) diverge from the printed text in a way that makes \na White Wolf game more fun, who are we behind the desks at this office to say \nthat that’s wrong?That’s the worst kind of corporate jack-assery, and it’s no basis \nfor developing a quarterly magazine. \nWithout that built-in condescension working against me, it’s easier to see \nthe good that’s hiding behind the otherwise judgmental observations that \nopened this essay. It’s easy to see that people approach LARPs with basically \ngood intentions and reasonably good ideas. \nThe biggest thing you notice is that LARPers want, expect and even \ndemand a unified World of Darkness setting. You can tell it from the crossover \nlunacy and the scenes of explanation and the choices of villains. The people \nwho buy our products, we can’t deny, don’t usually read one game line and one \ngame line only. They see how the varied pieces fit together from each game \nline, regardless of that line’s cloistered perspective, and they expect their \ncharacters to live in an inclusive setting. Granted, it’s difficult to wrap one’s \nmind around a world in which clockwork brass robot constructs shared land \nwith blood-sucking undead lords of the night, but that sort of cross-brand \ninconsistency is more the exception to the rule. People have been after us for \nyears to admit that the World of Darkness is a singular supernatural melting \npot, and they’ve got a point. \nThe other big revelation I’ve made is that LARPers generally have a \nstrong desire to be heroes and do what’s right. While they’re often cartoonish \ncaricatures rather than characters in their own right, LARP villains are \nalmost universally bad. They’re drug-dealers or gun-runners or corrupt \nbureaucrats or Hell-bound magicians or devil-spawn themselves, and they \nmust be destroyed for the good of the community, or even the entire world. \nCommon beat-squad rallying causes are those of freedom and justice; \nnothing gets a group of biddable head-thumpers together like the promise of \na relief from tyranny. While many methods characters in LARPs engage in \n"

      "text": "are extreme (such as short-range ambushes or sniper assaults), the core of \nmotivation is usually a noble one. \nPlus, LARPers are some of most dedicated adherents to the concept of \nmulti-cultural diversity you could hope to find. You see evidence of it in every \nGangrel Wyrm Foe and Tzimisce antitribu and Kinfolk ghoul vassal to the local \nsidhe lord. It makes sense to LARP players that a reasonable explanation of \noneself and a trustworthy practice of what you preach will gain one the trust \nand eventual respect of any culture - \nno matter how opposed to your own it \nmay be originally. While that hope may not prove true reliably in our real- \nworld experience, LARP players believe in it because that’s the way they feel. \nThat’s a special kind of idealism that it does a heart good to see. It helps me \nremember why 1 got hooked up with the gaming crowd in the first place \nwaaaaay back when. \nO T H E R  LESSONS \nThese last several lessons are the ones I’ve learned while doing this \njob. Consider them a peek behind the curtain, and keep them in mind if \nyou should ever decide to seek glorious and gainful employment in gaming \ndesign and publication. \nGaming is not an industry. No, despite the notoriety and acclaim you can \ngain by becoming a public figure in gaming, gaming will always be a niche of a \ngreater industry. As such, the concomitant pay one makes reflects that status. \nFreelance game writers kap at the opportunity to miss their deadlines. If our \naccounting department allowed me to supplement my paycheck with the \npenalty fees that are written into every White Wolf freelance contract for \nturning in work late or incomplete, I’d be sitting on a golden La-2-Boy watching \na 70-inch projection screen television and lighting my duty-free Cuban cigars \nwith rolled-up giant panda pelts while bellowing for Elian Gonzales and the \n“Whazzup! ?” guys to make me a sammich. \nThe writer-developer-editor triangle is not a self-supporting mechanism. It \nis, instead an autocannibalistic mess that somehow manages to work despite \nits own best efforts. Each point in the triangle is convinced of its own \nintellectual and creative superiority, as well as the relative incompetence of \nthe others. Unless the others happen to be right and able to prove it. Having \nbeen a part of each vertex of this triangle, I can state for a fact that this is \nunequivocally the case. \nIt is hard to be topical and clever in a quarterly publication that gets to stores \napproximately six months after it kaves your hands. It’s also pretty hard to coordinate \na coherent Event Horizon calendar on that schedule, as I’m sure you’ve noticed. \nA young editor with only three months of experience who’s thrust into the \nposition ofdeweloping a quarterly magazine should not “contribute” his own fiction to \nthat magazine. Hindsight is a painful teacher. I apologize for “A Position of \nStrength” and “Any Mother’s Child.” No, really. \nYou have to settle sometimes. No writer or artist or typesetter or editor \n(or developer) lives up to your ideals all the time. Fortunately, that’s okay, \nbecause this isn’t exactly brain surgery or UN translating. Usually when you \n“settle” for a finished product, it’s every bit as good as your ideal despite how \ndifferent the two are. \n"

For those of you who are new to the publication, let me take \na second to acquaint you with just what you’ve got here. \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gap in your White \nWoIfLARPenvironmen~ Weofferdesfornewcharactertypes,origmlstorylinestowork \ninto your chronicles, guides for keeping your games under control and running smoothly \nand rules updates you won’t find in any other Mind’s Eye release. Plus, you’ll find answm \ntothequestionsthathaveplaguedyou,origmalWorldofDarknessfictionandcolumnsf \npeople who’ve been W i n g  or workmg here at White Wolf (or both) for years. \nAt least, that’s been the pattern thus far. Now, however, I’m sad to say that this \nvery issue is the last one that will be available for the foreseeable future. As we ramp \nup and fine-tune our fronthe Mind’s Eye Theatre releases, the Journal has simply \nbecome less and less necessary. Every resource that goes into making the Journal what \nitis isaresourcethatcouldjustaseasilygointoaLawsof ... booktomakeit thatmuch \nbetter. That being the case, it ftankly just doesn’t make much sense to continue to \ndivideourresourcesaswehavebeen.Althoughmanyofuswillbesadtoseethe \nJournal \ngo, the Mind’s Eye Theatre line will emerge stronger for the change. Its books will get \nbigger, its rules will get sharper, and it will become more inclusive in the long run. \nBut let’s forget about that for a moment and take a look at what’s actually in \nthis issue. There’s no sense drawing the curtain before the end of the first page.. .. \nIn this issue of the Journal, we take a look into the future of MET. Richard \nDansky gives advice on what to do when your game has run its course. Cynthia \nSummers talks about the future of the game line she develops so tirelessly and about \nthe genre itself. Steve Balfour, the president of the Camarilla fan club, foreshadows \na future MET release with an article on some of the concern surrounding chronicles \nthat are larger than the average chronicle. Newcomer David Tancredi also makes \na good showing with an article on creating convincing antagonists, and Peter \nWoodworth gives tips on personalizing the supernatural World of Darkness experi- \nence. And, asalways, you’llfindalittle Worldofhrknessfictionandanevent listing \nthat’s as accurate as it can be, considering the circumstances. \nAnd even though the Journal is going away, you can still contribute to the \nfuture of MET. Send letters on your opinions about the state of live-action \nroleplaying today. Send questions about the features and rules you’ve seen here, \nas well as notes about the broken rules you come across in different MET \npublications. Send horror stories about games gone wrong and how your players’ \ncharacters fixed them. Check out the Forum section of our web site and post your \nobservations there. We’re always interested in the opinions and desires of our \nreaders, so don’t stop letting us know what you want to see. \nAfter all, where would we be without you? \nCarl Bowen \ncarlawhite-wolf.com \nWhite Wolf Publishing, Inc. \n735 Park North Blvd, Suite 128 \nClarkston, GA 30021 USA \n\n\nTHF CURRFNT THINKINCj \nWhen something you’ve worked on for a long time has to go away for \nreasons that are beyond your control, it’s tempting to point fingers and lay \nblame. When I heard that the Journal was being cancelled, I felt that \ntemptation. Instead of going onapetulant useless rampage, though, I decided \nto look back at how the Journal had been received thus far throughout its run. \nI paged through old emails and posts I had saved from our old online forum \n- \nyou know, the one that worked - \nand I found these collected comments. \nThe Journal I think is a great idea, though I have to say I’ve been a bit \ndisappointed in the way it’s turned out. Some of the information in the Journals \nis very useful, while some of it I can’t help but feel is just filler. Some of the things \nwould be useful, but there just isn’t enough information. \nFor example, a useful bit that came out of the Journals were the listings of \nwhat levels ofLore provided what information (and what misconceptions!). On \nthe other hand, we don’t need a section detailing Asian wraiths. The section on \nBastet would have been useful if it had included information on more tribes, or \na more complete listing of the Pumonca powers even. \nI would like to see something giving definitive information on Ghouls. Liber des \nGoulesisawasteofpaper and thenewer booksare both incomplete andalsocontradictory \nat points. Translations of more Werewolf material to MET would also be very useful. \nOverall, the Journal is a great idea that has had mediocre follow-through. It would \nbe a terrific forum to have official FAQs published and release MET information that \ndoesn’tfit into thestandardbooks. It needs lessfictionandfldandmore solidmaterial. \n-Tanuki \n(tanuki st@hotmail.com) \nI must say that, over all, the entire concept and run of the Mind’s Eye Theatre \nJournal has been a good one. There have only beena few small problems that I have \npersonally had with the Journals. Well, one really. One very big problem that \ncontinually pisses me off everytime I see that copy of the Journal. It’s about the \nLores ... Now, many of you out there might be happy that White Wolffinally came \nout and downright said what each level of each of the most predominant Lores \ndoes. But let me tell you something about those levels. They suck. If I spend more \nthan fourteen seconds in an actual LARP game with one of those creature types, \nchances are I will be able to learn more about said creature type than someone with \na Kindred Lore of 40. How do I know it’s 14 seconds? I timed it. \nIn short, the system screws anyone who wants to come into agame knowing \nmore than a first-night Embrace/Changed/Dead/Faerie-stuffed/whatever be- \ncause spending three minutes with characters of that type will give you more info \nthan any level of the “Lores” will. Maybe the Lores should be called “Lies and \nUseless Info.” It’s much more accurate, and I could stop putting quotes around \nit because that name would be far more fitting. \nYeah.. . \n-Unagodd \n(frederick@csus.edu) \n\n\nI’m very fond of the concept of a magazine as support for a game. Games \nWorkshop does the same, TSR does (did ?? i don’t fallow them anymore) the \nsame. when issue 1 and 2 came out, i was very enthousiastic, but i’m somewhat \ndissapointed by the amount of useful1 info i find in them. half of the time, there \nis not a single item of use in them to me. \nthe things i’m after is metaplot and rules( clarification). a magazine gives the \npossibility to influence the WOD, a bit like the updates on the WOD in books \nlike TOTB & NOP. a magazine is a perfect tool to bring the changes on a regular \ntimed base. example : issue 10 talks about the changes in California, issue 11 \nabout the takeover by the cama from ny, issue 12 about ... you get the picture. \nalso, things like (much more) FAQ’s are something that i would like to see \nin the magazine. \nI suppose all in all these are good publications, but they don’t offer what \ni’m looking for. \n-Xavier \nMuylaert (Muvlaert@mail.com) \nFor me, I enjoy the MET Journal. The additional rules for minor bloodlines and \nupdates to the METgameworld (like Hunters, recent events in Wraith matters, etc.) \nare a welcome bonus. Articles detailing history and/or exposing metaplot informa- \ntion are wonderful as well, because not all LARPers follow the tabletop game. \nMuch to White Wolfs chagrin, I suspect! \nI would like to see more FAQ’s, official updates and perhaps optional rules. \nThe MET Journal is the perfect place to publish Oblivion updates to 3rd Edition \nVampire MET core rules, additional character types, and even direction on \ncostuming or helpful Storytelling guidelines. Granted, some rules will probably \nneed to be saved for a future book, but hints and tips - \nlike the recent Mage \narticle - \ngo far to help fill in those gaps until the official versions are printed. \nWhat I do not like to see published in the pages of the MET Journal are \n“ultra kewl powerz” that only serve to have players BEG for them, at least those \npowers that are not tempered in some fashion. I am also not a fan of fiction \nwithin the pages. I know, I know, just because it’s not my cup of tea I shouldn’t \nbe too harsh to judge. But, the beauty of toleplaying is that WE get to create the \nstories. I don’t want to read about your ideas, I want to make my own. \n“But James, some people aren’t that creative and they need some ideas!” Absolutely, \nbut there is plenty of theme, flavor and fiction within the rulebooks to get us started, \ngenerally found at the begmning of a rulebook and often between the chapters. \nWhile the World of Darkness isn’t about rules and systems but about \nStorytelling, this is not the World of Darkness Journal. This is a journal \ndedicated to one specific set of rules and one specific line of rulebooks. If I want \nfiction set in the World of Darkness, I’ll go pick up any number of paperbacks \npublished by The Wolf. I don’t buy rulebooks or supplemental material for the \ngripping fiction. I don’t believe many people do. \nIf you must, use the fiction to illustrate an MET scene. Don’t simply provide a \ngripping tale that only exists to entertain. Let the Storytellers do that for their players. \nThat’s why we buy the rulebooks. \nAdditionally, the MET Journal could be the best place to publish errata that \ngoes beyond mere FAQ level. Official, authorized, “we screwed up, here’s what \n\n\nPage XX should have said” errata. No one likes admitting mistakes but we all \nmake them: customer, author and publisher alike. Unfortunately for the authors \nand publishers, the customer is traditionally right. Make us happy and give us the \nclarifications and updates we seek in a timely fashion. \n-James A. Hussiere (drjamez@maine.rr.com) \nI like the MET Journal for a number of reasons, some of which I’ll describe \nbelow. However, I must clarify a point before I list my pros/cons. \nI am a mature role-player who prefers the richness of the World of Darkness \nsetting and the Mind’s Eye Theater rule system. \nI do not consider myself a “Mindless Fanboy”. I do not purchase a periodical \n“just because it’s cool!” I do not purchase every single White Wolf product that \ncomes along, “A Vampire cigerette lighter?No thanks, I don’t smoke.” I do not \npreach about my characters, past and present, to unsuspecting game developers. \nI do consider myself an “MET Evangelist” and I try to set a good example \nof our hobby. I do purchase a product when its content is good and the MET \nJournal gives me the content that I want by providing MET setting and rules \nclarifications that enrich my chronicle. \nWhatdoIlikeabuttheMETJournal?HerearemytopthreeDesertIslandanswers. \n1. The MET Journal has a sense of humor. Unlike other trade publications \nthat shall go nameless, the MET Journal is grounded enough to poke fun at \nthemselves and the product they create. When was the last time a certain \ncompany of upper-west coast of magic-users actually warned their players about \nthe risks of overindulgence in their product. Bye Rich, 1’11 miss the wit! \n2. The MET Journal is not a sales engine, but is an advertisement free \npublication focused on the Mind’s Eye rule system. I don’t have to wade through \narticles, ads or reviews of other systems that I’m not interested in. I like my \ncontent to be direct and I get that with the Journal. \n3. The MET Journal is inexpensive. Heck, I’ve paid more for graphic novels \nor user guides that have been far less informative or enjoyable. \nWhat would I like to see improved in the MET Journal? \n1. I would like to see the MET Journal published on a more timely basis, perhaps \nevery two months, instead of quarterly. Given the large volume of new material \nbeing published by White Wolf, we - the MET Storytellers, Players and retailers - \nneed a more reliable schedule for purchasing and stocking your fine periodical. \n2. I would like to see the most current MET rules clarifications (especially \nthe increasing cross-over questions) addressed and published in a timely fashion. \nInstead of having to wait and then buy a new MET Rules book to see the current \nFAQ, I would like to find it, indexed and accurate, in the MET Journal. It would \nsave me and my players from having to search through the various MET rules \nbooks to find the approprate data, and time saved means more time to play! \n3. I would like to see more articles focused on improving our Live Action \nhobby. While you already have a number of articles formatted for the Journal, \nI would like to see a few more columns on such topics as, chronicle creation, \nstorytelling techniques and pitfalls, legal aspects such as waivers and insurance, \nand how to handle the press without digging your own roasting pit. \nXybertec (Cybertec@cyberdude.com) \n\n\nMind's Eye Theater Journal is a great idea, but there are a few problems that \nI have seen with the Journal itself. \n1. Too Expensive. I can buy a book for the price of two journals. If there is \nany way to write this and make it cheaper, or if there is anyway you can make \nsubscriptions for the year, that would be the best thing. \n2. Too Much. There is too much on the things that are not played much and \nnot enough on the things that are. How about crossover rules for Garou to the \nnew 3rd ed. We have a mixed venue vampkgarou game and it would be nice to \nfigure out how to even the balances. \n3. FAQ's. Would be nice. (It would be nice to know if the designers \nintended for speed of thought and speed beyond thought to be used in the same \nsequence, and if it was, it would be nice to question them as to why they believe \nGarou should be able to be able to take up to 60 steps a turn for 8 hours.) Things \nlike that question plague every Larp. \n4. Storylines ... Nuff Said ... some MET SL's for beginning ST's \n5. TOO MUCHCHANGELING ANDWRAITH..,Iknow that Changeling \nand Wraith need a boost in the MET world, but most people play Vampire or \nWerewolf. I would like to see a little more about them in the future. All we've seen \non Vampires are (True Black Handkind of useful} Stuff on Camarilla and OWBN \n{Semi Useful} Types of players {Twice and not useful except for a laugh} Lores \n{Usefull but I would like an expanded section of Lores so we don't get into fights, also \nwhat does one start out with. I.E. does a Garou have werewolf 5 and Garou 2?} \nOther than that, I've liked the editorials, and gotten a good laugh from some of \nthe articles. Also, it's great that you take suggestions from people. It makes lie easier. \n-Nurain \n(nurain@hotmail.com) \n\n\nSO LON%, EARFWFLL, \nBY€-BY€ \nby Cynthia Summers, Mind’s Eye Theatre developer \nWell, for starters, Mind’s Eye Theatre isn’t going anywhere, although the \nJournal is falling by the wayside. Don’t all jump for joy at once.. .. \nMind’s Eye Theatre still has places to go, things to do and people to meet. \nThe upcoming Changing Breeds Book 1 and Vampire Storytellers Guide will \ncontinue to blaze new trails for LARPers of all stripes. Looking to the future, I \ndefinitely want the game line’s focus to be on telling stories and giving folks the \nbest tools with which to do so. \nTypically, last issues are considered a place to air prophecies, predictions \nand similar vaporware. Based on what I’ve been seeing in the course of my job, \nI’ll venture to put on my foresight cap and play at prophet. I think the live-action \ngenre is in for some interesting times ahead. This hobby has been around for at \nleast a decade, if not a little longer. The LARPing world of today is not the same \nas it was when Masquerade first came out. Some of the conventions of modern \nLARPing will change, and all of them will have to face up to the times. Exactly \nhow audiences’ tastes will change as days go by is up to social scientists (and our \nmarketing department) to figure out, but you can be sure that MET books will \nadapt to fit them. \nThe folks who’ve been engaging in live-action roleplaying for several years \nnow, like myself, are admittedly getting a bit long in the tooth. The folks who \nsaw Masquerade come into being are getting married, having kids and experi- \nencing various other grown-up rites of passage. But now that we’re doing all this \ngrowing up, will we need to give up “playing pretend”? Will new games give rise \nto “e1ders”mourningfor the good old days and wondering what’s the matter with \nkids today, while the “kids” wonder when those “fogies0 are going to retire to the \nold LARPers’ home? Those OG’s (original garners) who have continued to press \non often have more collective roleplaying experience under their belts than \ntheir new (and younger) Storytellers do. \nThis potential conflict could go several ways. It could result in clashes of age \nwhere those who reach a certain age find themselves increasingly unwelcome or \nwhere a youth must spend time in entry-level positions (both in and out of \ncharacter) for a long time. On the other hand, old chronicles might enjoy a \nresurgence in popularity and vitality as fresh new players infuse the scene with \ntheir enthusiasm. A coterie of experienced power-players might rise to promi- \nnence in an aging game and alienate the young, inexperienced players who \nwould otherwise keep the game alive. Conversely, a group of old hands who are \nthe Storyteller’s most mature and competent players might take mentor roles \nand help integrate bright-eyed young LARPers into the game in such a way that \nthe game goes on and continues to strive. \nPrediction: They’re not quite the Geritolset, but olderplayers are becomingafact \nof life. We’re only beginning to see the impact they’ll have on the hobby, and it will be \nan important factor in its future. \n\n\nThose coming in fresh to the games are entering with less knowledge of the \nmaterial under their belts. They’re less likely to have encountered the World of \nDarkness in a tabletop format than to have been recruited via a friend’s \nrecommendation, word of mouth or just happening upon a Laws of ... book in \na local store. This concern has already been addressed tentatively with the \nchanges to the books that give new Mind’s Eye readers a glimpse of the setting. \nNew rulebooks now start with ambient fiction and setting material that puts the \nrules material in some kind of context. \nThe newer generations of gamers are also coming in with wildly different \nbackground materials. We came to the games with impressions of The Crow and \nInterview with a Vampire, and we wanted to play what we saw. Our younger \nsiblings, however, are more familiar with Buffy and The Matrix. This difference \nisn’t necessarily destructive to the hobby, but it will become a factor as groups \ntry to create stories that pander to both sets of creative expectation. \nPrediction: Stormy waters lie ahead for those who are plotting the courses of \nchronicles. Storytelkrs will have to find a happy medium between brooding anti-hero \nstones and post-industrial epic taks of success against seemingly insurmountable odds. \nSpeaking of youth, what about those kids that the older players now have. \nAre we looking at the real next generation of LARPers? Is LARPing going to be \none more activity to juggle in between Little League games and ballet lessons? \nWhile much of the new gamers coming into the hobby are in their late teens and \nearly 20s (as many of us were when we started), a growing group of youngbloods \nis made up of elementary-school age kids who want to know what Mom and Dad \nare doing when they head out for the night dressed up in laced shirts or green \nvelvet. Certainly the enthusiasm surrounding the Harry Potter books suggests \nthat a wealth of youngsters are thirsty for fantasy and they just need the \nopportunity to take the next step. Simply ignoring this group or rebuffing its \ninterest may be one of the more ill-considered moves the LARP community \ncould make. \nPrediction: Groups may need to reconsider their approach to young peopk \nbeyond a blanket policy of non-admission. \nAnd that’s all that my psychic powers can endure for now. Now we sit back \nand see what the future brings. \nClosing out also means that you give out thanks to everyone who spent time \nworking on the thing. So -thanks to Carl for putting this puppy together from \na few harebrained ideas and turning out a silk purse from the sow’s ear. Thanks \nto the remarkable crop of writers who gave us so much to play with and think \nabout, taking roleplaying beyond a few sheets of paper and playing “let’s \npretend” down in the basement. And of course, thanks to you, the loyal readers, \nwho’ve followed us thus far. We wouldn’t be here at all without you. \nTake care, have fun, and we’ll see you around Elysium. \n\n\nDFADGUY SPFAKS \nCHANC~ES, \n€ N D I N C ~ S ,  B F C ~ I N N I N ~ S  \nA N D  \nOTHER \n’ I N C ~ S  THAT \nSEEM PROEOUND \nby Richard Dansky \nLet me give one final round of praise to Richard for \neverything he’s done oyer the years. Although he’s no \nlonger with us -the \ncompany, that is, not the living- \nhis presence has had a resounding influence on this game \nline and this hobby. In fact, I wouldn’t even have a job \nhere if it wasn’t for Richard. When you see this man, shake \nhis hand, thank him for all the hard work, and kt him know \nthat the contributions he’s made will not be forgotten. \nYears and years ago, back when vinyl was the best form of music you could get (as \nopposed to a statement about your retro chic muso cred like it is now), the Alan Parsons \nProject recorded a song called “Where Do We Go From Here?” For those of you who \ndon’t know who the Alan Parsons Project was, they’re the band best known for that \nthunderous instrumental that gets played before most sporting events these days. For \nthose of you who do know about APP and are currently sneering because let’s face it, \nVulture Culture was probably not one of the cooler albums ever recorded, relax. There’s \nalways someone out there who thinks your taste in music sucks. And for those few of \nyou who actually own Alan Parsons Project CDs - \nor even albums - \nwell, we’re \ngetting old, guys. Still, it could be worse: I could be leading off the column by discussing \nwhat LARP plot lines can be extracted from Emerson, Lake and Palmer’s Tarkus album. \nCount your blessings, folks. \nBut, as usual, I digress. My point, or at least my moderately blunt conversational \nobject, is that it’s always time to think about what comes next. What do you do when \nyour game crashes and burns, or it gets taken over by no-talent munchkins? What \nhappens if your favorite game system (*cough* Wraith *cough*) gets canceled. In \nshort, what do you do if the status quo of your gaming universe, Deo prohibe, changes? \nMind you, this notion isn’t one that the gaming industry-or \nthe gaming audience \n- \nnecessarily takes to heart with a whole lot of love. The phenomenon that I call \n“gaming crystallization” that takes place an awful lot, and it hits players, writers and \ndevelopers with equal frequency. In so many words, gaming crystallization is the notion \nthat when someone finds gaming for the first time, he seizes on the first good game he \nplays as the Platonic ideal of roleplaying. Nothing else can ever measure up to that first \nsublime experience, and any changes to the game line are a betrayal of that one, shining, \nmagical moment when the dice first hit the table. \nUnfortunately, everyone crystallizes at different times and with different systems. \nThat’s why you get edition wars on UseNet and mailing lists, for one thing. It’s also why \nsome folks get verrrrry nervous or dismissive about games and styles of play that are \ndifferent from the ones they’re used to. Not everyone crystallizes thus, certainly - \nnot \nby a long shot - \nbut it does happen, and it’s something to watch out for. After all, if \n\n\nyou decide that Street Fighter is the ultimate RPG, the fact that they’re not making \nStreet Fighter any more probably puts a crimp in your enjoyment of the hobby. \nYou know what? That’s just plain silly. What we’re doing is - \nand I’m only going \nto say this once -a hobby. It is intended for enjoyment. Every other aspect of it -from \nthe educational, a la the bulk of the content in Charnel Houses of Europe, to the \nhumorous internal swipes you’ll find in Pentex - \nis secondary. It’s a game. You’re \nsupposed to have fun with it. You’re supposed to get together with people whose \ncompany you enjoy to do things you enjoy and, with any luck, acquire stories that will \nbore the living hell out of everyone you know upon their umpteenth recitation. \nThat being said, your primary responsibility to yourself is to allow yourself to enjoy \nthe gaming that you do. If you’re clinging to something that’s gone and not coming back \n- \nbe it a since-replaced edition or a since-canceled product line - \nyou’re doing \nyourself a disservice. Now, that’s not to say that just because a company kills a game, \nit’s time to stop playing that game. After all, I still haul out Ye Olde Wraithe Bookes \non occasion, and I enjoy doing so. I just don’t look out at my players from across the \nBuried Secrets screen, sniff in best Etonian fashion and announce that no gaming \nexperience henceforth can possibly compare. You love what you love, but you shouldn’t \nallow it to keep you from enjoying something new. \nSo what does that pithy bit of wisdom mean for you? And no, this doesn’t mean \nthat MET is going to be canceled. MET is going to grow and thrive for agood long time, \nand that’s great. It’s also going to change as things go along -hopefully there won’t \nbe another Laws of the Night, but there might be - \nand you’ll have the choice of how \nyou’re going to take it. In my opinion, at least, the best thing you can do is recognize \nthat change is coming and inevitable, and do your level best to make sure that the \nchange is for the better. So write cards and letters with feedback and critique. (And \nmake them polite ones, damn it. Nothing turns someone off toyour feedback faster than \nsaying, “You screwed up, but I, in my infinite armchair wisdom, know how to fix \neverything.”) Make sure you mention what you like in your letters as well. Positive \nfeedback helps immensely, believe it or not. \nBut, to quote Monty Python, that’s as may be: It’s still a frog. Some of you folks are \ngoing to crystallize in your gaming with MET as it stands, and there’s nothing wrong \nwith that. If it works for you, it works. It’s that simple. Nobody’s saying that you always \nhave to jump on the newest, hottest thing to come along just because it’s new and it \nseems to be all the rage. Just because it’s new and hot doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s \nany damn good, or that it’s something you’ll enjoy as much as what you’re doing now. \nI keep my old Villains and Vigilantes books easily accessible for a reason, and it’s not \njust so I can haul out “Organized Crimes” for purposes of taunting my erstwhile \nmanager, Ken Cliffe. It’s because I have fun with the game, even despite the fact that \nthe system is simplistic and the book‘s falling apart. Ten years from now, some of you \nare liable to be saying the same thing about your shabby, dog-eared copies of Laws of \nthe Night. And last time I checked, that’s what this whole thing is about. \n(I’m also fully cognizant of the fact that some of you are going to be systematically \nburning every picture you can find of yourself in character costume and bemoaning the \ntime you wasted on such a childish hobby, but such is life. Remember what happened \nto Susan at the end of the Chronicles ofNarnia. Different folks take different roads, and \nthey’re perfectly happy with them.) \nBut that’s the big picture, or at least one panel of it. (One suspects that the really, \nreally big picture looks a bit like Rodin’s Gates of Hell, complete with three scary, \n\n\n._- \nI \n- \ncome more personal moments when aiki’g “What now?” is entirely appropriate. Take, \nfor example, the horrifying, soul-shattering moment when you suddenly realize that.. . \n. ..you’re bored to freakin’ death with your game as it now stands. So, to borrow a \nline from Dennis Hopper, whaddaya do, whaddaya do? \nThe easy step to take is the boldest: Quit. Write a snide or angry or regretful email \n- \nyour choice - \nto the Storyteller, the Narrators, your fellow players and random \npassersby announcing your departure and enumerating your reasons for jumping ship. \nDoing so provides no small measure of catharsis, but it also pretty much eliminates the \npossibility of ever returning to the game. Phrases like “bloated, flaccid storytelling style” \nand “emotionally dishonest bouts of Rock-Paper-Scissors” may seem fun to write, but \nthey do a wonderful job of ensuring that you’re never going to be welcomed back. \nOf course, if you’re feeling particularly spiteful, you can quit and try to start your \nown game, with the express purpose of putting the old one out of business. This idea \nis bad on any number of levels, not the least of which are A.) it’s a hell of a lot of work \nto do just to put a dull stick in someone’s figurative eye, and B.) if you do succeed in \nkilling the other game, all of the players you felt compelled to leave behind will then \nseek to while away their evenings in your chronicle because there’s nowhere else for \nthem to go. Oops. \nA more sensible approach is to sit down and dope out what exactly bothers you \nabout the game as it’s currently configured. Writing it out helps. If nothing else, doing \nso forces you to formalize and organize what your thoughts on the matter actually are. \nAlso, putting those thoughts in black and white (or green or red or whatever color ink \nyou’re using, although I recommend against crayon) is a great way to see if you’ve got \nlegitimate concerns or if you’re just being pissy. For instance, “My character is getting \nslapped around,” isn’t a legit concern. “My character is getting stomped like the 1998 \nMinnesota Twins because the Storyteller gives his buddies all sorts of kewl powerz and \nignores the rest of us,” is. \nOnce you’ve got those concerns mapped out, you can look at them with a \nsufficiently jaundiced eye and decide what’s called for next. Maybe quitting - \nor just \ntaking some time off - \nis the appropriate solution. The trick is remembering that it’s \na solution, not a grandiose gesture of defiance. In the grand scheme of things, quitting \na LARP is not quite on the same level as, say, standing in front of a tank in Tiananmen \nSquare. Maybe a little time off is all you need to get your batteries recharged, or maybe \nyou’re done with that game for good, but it’s still just a game you’re talking about. \nWhat that means is, if you’re going to go, go. Do it. Don’t make speeches about how \nit pains you to leave, don’t wait for your adoring ghouls to beg you to come back and \nsave the game, don’t expect the world to end just because you’re walking away. Just go, \nand move on. Nothing is more annoying (including the brain surgeons who throw \nsomething that looks like an obscene hand gesture from a deranged gibbon during R- \nP-S and claim that it’s alternately a scrawny rock, curved scissors or really thin sheets \nof paper) than an ex-player who tries to imitate Banquo’s ghost by sticking around for \nthe feast. Who knows? Maybe once you’re away for a bit, you’ll decide that you want \nto come back. Maybe you’ll want to start your own game after all. And maybe you’ll \ndecide vou’ve iust had enoueh. and vou’11 close the book on that Darticular amect of \nI \n\n\nThen again, there are times when the big shakeup isn’t your doing. Games have \nbeen known, for any number of reasons, to fall down and go boom. Maybe the main \nStoryteller moves, quits or (Deoprohibe! -again \nwith the Latin! It means“God forbid, \nin case you’re wondering, but let’s face it, Gladiator made this stuff cool again.) acquires \nanother commitment that requires a sizable time investment. (Kids, for example. Kids \nare a big one.) Sometimes the game just winds down of its own accord, as the story line \nwraps up and nothing arises to take its place. Player attrition is another killer, especially \nif the game is one that relies on existing community to the extent that it rarely draws \nnew blood. (In case you’re wondering, that’s a nice way of saying “Someone kills off all \nthe newbies’ characters until the players stop coming back.”) And sometimes you just \nshow up and the only people there are the Storyteller’s SO and the janitor, swapping \nwar stories and comparing their favorite vintages of chardonnay. Hey, it happens. \nWhen it happens, though, you have to figure out what you’re going to do next. The \neasiest approach is just to sit on your thumbs and hope someone else decides to start \nanother game up. The flaw with this approach, however, is twofold: One, you’re at the \nmercy of someone else’s gaming style and choice of material. Two, as one of my \ncoworkers says, “Hope is the beginning of unhappiness.” \nOf course, if you feel disinclined to sit around and wait for someone else to bite the \nbullet, you can go the opposite route and start a game yourself. (There’s actually a third \nroute, which can best be summed up as “guilt/ manipulate/ sucker someone else into \ndoing it for your pleasure,” but we don’t condone that sort of thing here. Well, not often, \nand not when management is looking.) By doing so, you’re making sure that the game \nyou want to play is getting run, and you’re taking squarely on your shoulders the \nresponsibility for continuing the gaming community in your area. (Note: If you actually \ndo decide to run a game, you have my respect, sympathy and admiration. You also \nprobably have a need to hit yourself on the forehead with a large brick five or six times, \njust to prepare yourself for what’s coming next. It pretty much accurately simulates the \nunpleasant aspect of running a LARP, but with less photocopying.) Just make sure that \nif you do decide to run a game, you’re prepared for all of the hard work and the criticism \nthat comes with it. If you value your life, sanity and stomach lining, do not expect \npeople to kowtow before you in swooning admiration because you saved the game. \nInstead, be prepared for endless kvetching about how the old game was better, how they \ncould do it better and quite possibly how a one-legged bullfrog who moonlights as a \nbanjo player at the local Dukes of Hazzurd-themed watering hole could do it better. \nHowever, I can also state with some confidence that a storytelling staff composed of \nTaliesin, Sam Clemens, Senchan Torpeist and some balding dude named Bill would get \nthe identical reaction. It’s when you don’t get any griping that you have to worry. That \nmeans they don’t care enough to bitch. \nIn the end, it all boils down to this: It’s going to change. All of it. Your gaming \ngroup, your chronicle, even the very game you’re playing. Get over it. It’s going to \nhappen. There’s no sense playing Canute and trying to hold back the waves, because \nit’s just not going to work. (No, I can’t tell you what clan Canute was, though I’m sure \nhe’s in a book somewhere. Don’t blame me; I stuck to minor British nobility and people \nwho were dead already. It seemed safest.) The inevitable end result is that you’ll end up \nall wet, with lots of people asking you who the heck Canute was. \nUltimately, you have two responsibilities. The first is to yourself, and it’s a \nresponsibility to have fun. Otherwise, why bother playing the game? Trudging grimly \nalong to session after session doesn’t win you any metaphysical merit badges for \n\n\npersistence. There’s no great Pilgrim’s Progress-style reward for enduring the most \ngatherings of a game you’re not enjoying. So find a way to enjoy your gaming, or find \ngaming that you enjoy. \nThat’s because the second responsibility is to be something other than a pain in the \nass to everyone you’re playing with. You’ve got no right to keep others from having fun, \neven if you in your superior wisdom know that they’re playing the game wrong or by \ninferior rules or whatever. (And of course I’m not talking to you. I’m talking to that guy \nyou know who’d act that way. Yeah, you know the one I’m talking about. He’s a jerk, \nisn’t he? What a bastard.) If other folks are having fun, let them. What exactly do you \ngain from deflating the tire of their happiness, other than more angry, sweaty company \nby the side of the road? Back off and respect their enjoyment, even if you can’t share \nit. If, however, you’re only happy when other people are embedded in the same morass \nof misery wherein you pass your darkened existence, you need to find the local Oblivion \ngame and volunteer as a Shadowguide. To every thing there is a season, and all that. \nMake yourself useful. \nThat’s what it all comes down to, then. Find a way to have fun with the game, \nregardless of its incarnation or rules set or setting or whatever, and don’t step on anyone \nelse’s enjoyment. In the end - \nand Steve Wieck is going to kill me for daring to put this \nin print -you \ndon’t have to buy every new book that comes along. You just have to be \nwilling to have fun and to allow for the possibility that a new title or a new edition or a \nnew game (or even a new way of playing that game) might actually be enjoyable. Mind \nyou, I certainly hope you don’t give up on the old stuff. Those of us who worked on the \nold books will salute you for your loyalty, and then surreptitiously check the amazon.com \nsales rank of each of our titles when we think no one’s looking. You just can’t let your love \nof the old stuff preclude you from the possibility of having fun with the new. \nCome to thinkof it, that’sactually apretty good way to approach life. Give it ashot. \nStart small, say, with LARPing. After all, this cockamamie hobby just might be good \nfor something after all. \nI \nPS: It’s been fun, folks. Thanks for reading along, and here’s hoping you got a smile \nor two out of this column. Me, I generally got enough to go out for a really nice Chinese \ndinner about once a month, plus an audience. I’d call that a fair trade. Now go have fun, \nor else I start writing another one of these, and God knows none of us wants that. \n1 \n1 \n\n\nLARCjF 9AMFS \nAND LONG CHRONICLFS \nJ \nWHY THEY \nBRBAKAND \nHow PLAYERS \nA N D  STORYTELLERS \nCAN E I X  THEM \nby Steve Balfour \nMost of us are not into Mind’s Eye Theatre live-action roleplaying for one- \nshot games. We want a rich chronicle with a history and story that evolves and \nchanges as our characters plot, scheme and act. A slightly smaller set of us are \ninto large games in chronicles or at conventions. Have you ever been to a live- \naction game with over 300 players dressed to the nines and roleplaying their \nhearts out? Oh, it’s a unique experience! Your character is always at risk. The \nbiggest-name characters are there. A scene done right opens a dozen doors, and \na scene done poorly closes them all. It’s astounding. \nBig games and long chronicles are not just different and desirable for the \nplayers, they’re a real challenge for the Storytellers and organizers. Game sites \nmust be found, plots must be interwoven, characters must be directed, teams of \nStorytellers need coordinating, and all of the rest of the stuff we all help with to \nget these huge albatrosses to soar and swoop like eagles must be done. They are \noutrageous fun when everything goes well. They are mind-splitting headaches \nwhen they do not. \nSo, do you want to play in or host a huge game? Have you ever wanted to \nstorytell or play in a sprawling multi-city chronicle?How about just adding a few \nmore ideas and possible solutions for that big game you already enjoy or run? \nWell, that’s why I’m writing. \nPartially. I couldn’t address all the things that make large games and \nchronicles fantastic successes, but I can cover some of the most important \nelements that will help you shine as a Storyteller or player - \nthe rules and the \ndynamics of large games. And no, this article shouldn’t prove unhelpfully \nesoteric; I’ve become a practical guy since I started coordinating larger LARPs \nin 1994. I’ve seen a lot after being a Storyteller at several of bigger conventions \nlike Dragon*Con and being on the production and storytelling teams of many \nof the Camarilla’s large games (White Wolf’s fan club called the Camarilla, not \nthe fictional vampire sect). As far as tips go, I’ve worked and roleplayed with \nsome of the best in the World of Darkness LARP scene. Plus, I have a secret \nweapon that helps me make sense out of some of the odd problems we face in \nlarge LARPs and international chronicles: I have a few degrees in psychology. \nSo, WHAT’S \nT H E  BI \ncj DEAL. \n? \nBig games and long chronicles cause rules to break, plots to break, players \nto break and Storytellers to break. LARPs become large at about 150 players - \nthe kind of games you find at the larger conventions and some of the season \nfinales of the really big LARP groups. In the Camarilla, we run about a dozen \n\n\nlarge games each year, ranging from 150 to 350 players and one really enormms \ngame with close to 1000 players at the annual International Camarilla Conven- \ntion (ICC). Some people find my lower boundary of 150 players too high, of \ncourse; a 70-person game is too large for some. Whatever the case is for you, I’ll \nstick to describing the game and plot logistics that I’ve learned in the school of \nhard knocks, because that’s what’s relevant to the majority of large games. You’re \nprobably not too interested about how to rent out an entire hotel for three nights \nlike the ICC does. \nI think of a long+running MET chronicle as one that’s been running for at \nleast a year and has some pretty good continuity-reinforcing mechanisms in \nplace, such as email lists, a solid group of core players or some long-lived \ncharacters. Although long chronicles can take place in just one city, several \ngroups - \nincluding the Camarilla (club not sect), One World by Night and \nShared Universe - \nhost multi-city chronicles. The Camarilla’s chronicle, for \ninstance, has about 250 cities on four continents playing in a 6000-person \nchronicle that started in 1992. The Camarilla runs weekly or biweekly events \nwith 20 to 100 players and maintains numerous email lists to keep Storytellers \ncoordinated and everybody roleplaying to their hearts’ content. \nHow Brg C ~ A M E S  B R E A K A N D  \nWHY \nBig games and long chronicles cause rules to break, plots to break, players \nto break and Storytellers to break. Smaller games allow for more personal \ninteraction between Storytellers, players, plots and the rules. If your MET \nchronicle consists of seven players and one Storyteller, you can run it very much \nlike a table-top game with the Storyteller describing the reactions of the World \nof Darkness and helping everyone through challenges that they perform. The \nfeel is personal, the plots can be grand and world-changing, and the mechanics \nof the rules can be governed by consensus. The Storyteller has a good idea of \nwhat each character is doing, and he can work on character development, \npersonal horror and intriguing plot twists from each character’s past. \nAs the game gets larger, more players end up in conflict with each other so \nthat the chronicle shifts subtly away from the Storyteller describing the World \nof Darkness to the players defining the World of Darkness for each other. Even \nif the ratio of Storytellers to players is the same as it is in a smaller game, the larger \ngame becomes less personalized to each character. Unlike a game with one \nStoryteller and seven players, a game with 10 Storytellers and 70 players means \nthat no one Storyteller knows the general plans of each and every character and \nthat lots of player actions and challenges take place outside of the Storytellers’ \nview. Social dynamics also become a factor in the 70-person game, whereas \npersonal dynamics are more prominent in the seven-person game, so the \npsychological rules of play change for everyone involved. \nWhen a game branches out to multiple cities, a whole new level of \ncomplexity occurs. All of the sudden, the plots have to shrink in scope to \naccommodate the diverse views of the Storytellers in different cities. Yes, the \nplots have to shrink. In a seven-person game, for instance, the Storyteller can \ndictate that the characters burned Atlanta to the ground. Even in a 70-person \ngame in one city, it’s not that big of a deal (logistically) to have some monstrous \nforce sink Vancouver or wipe out an entire supernatural character type. But, as \n\n\nsoon as two different cities join the same Chronicle, the Storytellers and players \nhave to deal with what each other city does. The Storytellers and players cannot \nwrite and perform plot lines with worldwide effects without having all the \nStorytellers (and the majority of players) in all the cities agree and accept them. \nFor instance, the Brujah justicar cannot both hold a conclave in one city \nand be diablerized in another at the same time. High King David cannot disband \nthe Parliament of Dreams in one city but charge the Parliament with a task in \nthe other. Therefore, the possible plots for multi-city chronicles must shrink in \nscope as the number of cities in a chronicle increases, and that shrinking changes \nplayers’ opportunities and Storytellers’ plot tools. \nMulti-city games also put more stress on the Storytellers and the rules, because \nit is much harder to coordinate information for two or more teams than it is for only \none. What happens if a character destroys a police station in one city and then \nplays in another nearby city the next night? How quickly do police respond in the \nWorld of Darkness? How is everyone with Police and Media Influence informed? \nDoes that character’s action impact the levels of Influence (or danger) in each city? \nWere the Willpower Traits that the character spent last night in the other city \nmarked off for play tonight? Many of these questions are easy to answer in a one- \ncity game, but they become problems when two or more cities are involved. When \nyou add the elements of players with email or ICQ, you start to see how the \nStorytellers can be outpaced by the players in two or 250 cities. \nH o w  RULES \nBREAK \nLet’s go back to large games for a while. The goal of the MET system is to \nhelp players have fun roleplaying and acting out stories. In larger games, some \ncategories of rules begin to fray. The first category of rules that break in a large \ngame is that which encourages lots of tests. As an example, an Elysium scene \nwith 100 players in the same room descends into across-the-room testing hell \nwhen a single obfuscated Malkavian walks into the room among its security- \nparanoid court officials and supernaturally observant spectators. What happens \nwhen two or three such characters walk in at the same or different times? \nAnother example relevant to all MET rules is mass combat. In a room of 70 \nplayers, mass combat requires a charismatic Storyteller and a few assistants to \ncoordinate. The problem is compounded if only 35 of those 70 players in the \nroom are actually in the combat while the other 35 are trying to roleplay other \nscenes occurring in the same place. \nAnother category of rules that break in large games involves those rules that \nrely on Storyteller interpretation. Large-game Storytellers are not part of a hive \nmind. They will inevitably make different rulings about the way bonus Traits from \nsupernatural powers work, the amount or type of information that supernatural \ndetection gives or what effects some powers have. Aside from the complaints that \ncan generate among players, this inconsistency causes incongruities in the story. \nMost of these sorts of problems are not a concern in games with up to five \nStorytellers. Adding any more Storytellers, though, makes every little ambiguity \na possible frustration for everyone that can lead to a break from roleplaying. \nThe last category of rules that break in large games comprises rules that \nintroduce complexity to the game or record keeping for the game. In a room of \nseven, it’s not a big deal to mark a Trait off a character sheet or even track \n\n\ntemporary Trait totals. In a room of 70, the game changes. Large games have \nmore action going on all the time. Players have to attend to and remember a lot \nmore information, and the information is often less organized or predictable \nthan information in a smaller game. The nuances of rules end up being \nannoyances in large games. The larger the game is, the greater its need becomes \nfor fewer rules, simpler rules and rules that are easy to memorize. Also, it is much \nbetter to eliminate rules that require dragging out character sheets in large \ngames. Stopping the action for one player can potentially affect the rest of the \nplayers in the room negatively. \nMulti-city chronicles face most of the large-game problems, but with a \nhigher negative-impact potential. Two additional concerns that arise in those \ngames impact rules for multi-city chronicles. First, the frequency of character \ndeath should be minimized for the sake of both player satisfaction and chronicle \ncontinuity. It is often to the advantage of a chronicle to power down offensive \nsupernatural abilities and Merits while giving a character’s defensive capabilities \nmore weight. Second, keeping records and managing rules for refreshing used \nAbility and Background Traits becomes difficult in multi-city games. Consis- \ntent, easy- to-remember rules about refresh rates can lighten the burden of record \nkeeping and decrease the chance of player mistakes in multi-city chronicles. \nH O W  PLOTS \nBREAK \nThe stresses on rules in large games can sometimes be smoothed over by a \ndynamic Storyteller attending to the story and circumstances at the time. \nHowever, stresses on plots in large games can ruin any chance of creating a \nchronicle or allowing for meaningful character development. A challenge for \nany game with many Storytellers lies in coordinating plot lines over space and \ntime. Just the layout of the place where a large game is held can make \ncommunication between Storytellers easier or harder. Technology can help. So \ncan regularly scheduled meetingsduring the course of play. (But beware, though, \nthat Storytellers cannot just walk away from certain situations because they \nhave a meeting to attend.) \nAs games increase in size, players begin to define the World of Darkness for \neach other more than they rely on the Storytellers to define it for them. This \neffect occurs partially because more players are introducing their characters’ \nagenda into the game, adding a multitude of character-driven plots to the story. \nAs the game increases in size, some players grow more independent of the \nStorytellers and the rest of the players, so their character’s plots also begin to \ndiverge from what can reasonably be expected. \nWhile this divergence makes larger games more interesting, it poses a \nsignificant challenge to Storytellers writing plots. On one hand, character- \ndriven plots can be the focus of a large game (with a little Storyteller facilitation \nand moderation). On the other hand, character-driven plots can evaporate \nrapidly as the characters achieve their goals and begin to look for something else \nto do. In smaller games, it is much easier to understand where the characters are \ngoing and provide the necessary elements in the plot to deepen the roleplaying \nexperience. In larger games, not only is it harder to track and understand where \nthe characters are going, but having more characters means opening the door for \nmany more character-driven plots. Add in the fact that each Storyteller has a \n\n\nslightly different style of working with character-driven plots and you can see \nwhy games with more and more Storytellers, such as multi-city chronicles, face \nmany different challenges for moderating character-driven plots and writing \ntheir own plots. \nPlot lines have to be satisfying to the players, something that a Storyteller \ncan build into a plot he writes, but that character-drivenplots do not necessarily \ninclude. However, each degree of uncertainty introduced by increasing the \nnumber of players or Storytellers makes writing plots more challenging. In a \ngame governed principally by character-driven plots, Storytellers need a set of \nstock plot lines that can be implemented quickly when the character-driven \nplots dry up. A set of stock plots may sound less interesting or challenging to \nwrite than tailored plots, but such i s  not the case. A set ofstock plots must cover \nthe range ofplayers that may be attending agame. The plots must be interesting, \nsatisfying and linked into the chronicle in an understandable way, rather than \nrandomly throwing a treasure-laden Judas goat out for the characters to fight \nover. Shrewd storytelling teams in multi-city chronicles weave lots of plot line \nhooks into the chronicle so that they can put a plot into play at the most \nopportune time . \nIn large LARPs, players do not always create their characters’ agenda with \na concern for entertaining the assembled group. Moderating character-driven \nplots can seem as difficult as negotiating trade rights between hostile countries. \nPlayers, you can help by keeping the group in mind as you decide what your \ncharacter will do each night. Storytellers, you have to balance the enjoyment \nthat the group is drawing from all the combined plots in play and the desire for \nplayers to have their characters in the spotlight just enough to make their \nroleplaying experience. \nH O W  PLAYERS \nBREAK \nSmall games are based on personal dynamics and regulated by friendship \nand understanding. Large games are less personal, and they begin to rely on \nlarger-scale social dynamics. For instance, it is much harder for a character to be \nleft out of a small game. The players or Storytellers involved can reintegrate any \nneglected characters quickly. In large games, players and Storytellers feel less \naccountable to each other and take less action to help each other. This effect is \ncalled the “bystander effect” in social psychology, named after the fact that \npeople will act like bystanders if they consider themselves anonymous parts of \na large group. Larger games present each player and Storyteller with a zillion \nthings to attend to and do, more than enough to feel less accountable to the \nentire game than a group of seven would. Players and Storytellers have to be \naware of the bystander effect and how it affects a LARP. \nIt is also true that people feel that they need to do less individually as the \ngroup size grows. One reason is “social loafing.”That is, the players feel less likely \nto be evaluated by others because they are in a larger group. Another reason is \nthe “free rider effect” in which people believe that someone else is likely to solve \nthe problem first so they do not try themselves. Both of these behaviors increase \nthe percentage of players who rely on Storytellers for providing plots in larger \nand larger games. This claim seems at odds with the fact that having more \ncharacters leads to more character-driven plots. What is really happening in a \n\n\nlarger game, though, is that one set of players becomes more independent and \nbegins introducing character-driven plots while another set of players becomes \nmore dependent on the Storytellers or other players for plots. The combination \nof these effects makes it necessary to increase the ratio of Storytellers to players \nin large games without structured plots. Because doing so is often unfeasible, \nplayers can be educated to help other players if they are willing. Furthermore, \nsimplifying the rules, decreasing the number of challenges called for by the rules, \ndecreasing the complexity of rule-to-rule interaction and making rules easy to \nmemorize can decrease the need of players to rely on Storytellers. \nAnother social dynamic that governs large games is the “risky shift effect.” \nWhen excitement gets high, people in large groups tend to feel that their actions \nwill meet with fewer consequences, so they attempt to do more outlandish stuff. \nIn live-action roleplaying, this behavior results in more challenges per player in \nlarger groups than smaller groups. The number of challenges increases exponen- \ntially as both the number of players and challenges per player goes up. Each of \nthe challenges has the potential to require a Storyteller or require looking up \nrules or require many other breaks in roleplaying. Therefore, it is better to \ndecrease the potential number of challenges to improve game flow for larger \ngroups. The risky shift effect also causes players to act in less predictable and \nmore diverse ways with their characters in large games or on large email lists. It \nalso means that some characters will hop on the fast-moving bandwagon just for \nthe thrill. Storytellers and other players have to plan and compensate for the fact \nthat larger groups give rise to more diverse and bolder reactions than they would \nencounter in small groups. \nH o w  STORYTELLERS \nBREAK \nThe two problem areas for Storytellers lie in setting up the chronicle and \nrunning the game. That covers just about everything, right? Setting up a large \ngame or a multi-city chronicle is a difficult task. In small LARPs, the players can \nselect what they want within the Storyteller’s comfort zone. Because the players \nand Storytellers in a seven-person game are able to negotiate and define the \nentire world themselves, character creation and setting are much different than \na game with many cities. When 70 players are involved, the World of Darkness \nratios play a role in character creation. The conventions of the genre start to \nunravel when the Lasombra untitribu outnumber the Brujah two-to-one. Simi- \nlarly, any deviation from the actual place and time in which the players are \ninvolved has to be explained meticulously to large groups. Imagine the out-of- \nplay disaster that happens when the group patrolling the park accidentally \ncomes into the same play area as the group hunting in the forest, and it takes \nseveral rounds to figure out that the groups are not in the same place in character. \nMulti-city chronicles require an even higher level of attention to initial \ncharacters and setting, especially if the chronicle adds players as it goes. Rules \nfor character type distribution, setting variations and using places that are not \nin any of the participating cities have to be worked out between all the \nStorytellers. It is terribly embarrassing when a new city joins a multi-city \nchronicle with a great background only to find out that the new city was a war \nzone in the existing chronicle. \n\n\nLarge games also seem to suck Storytellers into the most protracted \nproblems and challenges. As the number of players increases, the diversity of \nproblems that are possible also increases. Instead of regulating story flow, the \nhigher number of challenges and higher chance for mass combat in large games \nstakes a claim on the Storytellers’ time. \nC A N  \nYou REALLY \nEIX ALL THIS \nSTUEE? \nYes. To be completely honest, and with apologies to Murphy, not everything \nthat can go wrong will go wrong. Most of the problems for large games or multi- \ncity chronicles stem from two sets of core elements. The first set of problems can \nbe addressed with a supplement to the MET rules. These problems are the \ncomplexity of the rules, the escalating number of challenges in a large game, \nambiguity in the rules and inconsistencies in the expectations of the participants. \nThe second set of problems can be addressed with procedures and technology. \nThese problems include lack of information management, lack of support for \nStorytellers’ auxiliary needs and lack of planning for plot contingencies. \nM O R E  RULES? \nNo. Fewer. Before I get too much further along, I want to say that I’m not \nwriting the actual supplement for your specific game or chronicle. That’s for you \nto do. I want to show you the areas in which you can eliminate or simplify rules \nwhile still using the MET system. The Camarilla club has a supplement that \naddresses its needsfor the global, 24/7, live-action and internet chronicle it runs \nbetween 250 cities on four continents. That supplement might not be too \nhelpful if you are planning a 120-person one-shot convention LARP. The thing \nto keep in mind, whether you are thinking about the Camarilla supplement or \nyour own, is that new players will expect to recognize the rules you are using. In \nsome cases, they’ll ask you to justify why you are using those rules, and it’s good \nto be able to answer. (Hint: Show them this article!) \nSo, here is the punch line on rules: \nLarge games should use a few, simple, easy-to-memorize rules that minimize \nthe number of challenges and minimize offensive power. \nNeed a few examples of where you can trim? Anything that can be done to \neliminate the need for referring to a character sheet should be done. Players in \ncomplex costumes who are engaged in roleplay should not have to drag character \nsheets out of their pockets, let alone have to find a pencil to mark on those sheets. \nAn ingenious character sheet design can make things that have to be marked off \nlike Blood, Willpower, Gnosis and Glamour Traits, not to mention health levels, \neasy to mark off without unfolding. Other things necessary for challenges should \nbe easy to remember, such as using numbers instead of Trait names or relying on \npermanent Trait totals for challenge-resolution instead of temporary Trait totals. \nGame mechanics that interrupt roleplaying should be minimized. For \nexample, the Camarilla uses White Wolfs table-top rules as a basis for Auspex \nversus Obfuscate challenges in its vampire LARPs; the higher level of Auspex \npierces the lower level of Obfuscate automatically. This change minimizes the \nnumber of across-the-room challenges because players hold up the number of \nfingers for the level of Obfuscate or Auspex they’re using, and everyone knows \nwith minimal challenges who can see whom, or who cannot be seen. This idea \n\n\n____ - \n~ \nTry to reduce the number of tests that the rules require. Streamline mass \ncombat when the outcome looks clear. For instance, the 50-on-five mob scene \ncan be resolved with everyone pointing once and holding up a sign once. The \nStoryteller then narrates the results of the entire battle without further chal- \nlenges save death blows. Combat in the MET system is always slow, and it takes \na charismatic ST to control the room and get things done efficiently any time \n15+ characters are involved. \nStandardization helps in large games. There are a few examplesof the way that \nMET rules can have multiple interpretations, so make rules calls so that all \nStorytellers will be consistent. Some of the problem points that the Camarilla has \nfound are the way that Awareness was written, the way Rapidity was written and the \nway Dominate was written. What is the Awareness retest? Does the multiple-action \npenalty still apply when a character uses Rapidity? Does the one retest mentioned \nin theDominate descriptionrefer only toone Willpowerretest, or one retestperiod? \nYou’ll find others as your Storytellers make rulings in your game. \nAlso, rules that help set the expectations of the participants are good \nadditions for large games. For instance, the character types, powers or Merits \nwith the best game effects will be the most numerous in large games, despite what \nthe World of Darkness calls for. If players make their own characters, simple and \nfair rules for regulating rarity are a must. \nIn multi-city chronicles, minimizing offensive power is generally a good \nthing. High offense is great for one-shot convention games, but it’s bad for a \nlong-running chronicle in which players travel through terrae incognitae four \ntimes a year. Cities or regular travel circuits tend to develop a pulse that helps \ntheir character interaction along. Often, the players have characters of about \nthe same power level, they understand each others’ habits, and they tolerate \neach others’ flaws. Going outside that travel circuit places those characters at \nserious risk, so it is best to take steps to see that the beating the characters can \nget will not be a fatal one. Eliminate one-shot kills. Select the least damaging \noptional rules in the MET books. Think about the weapons you allow in your \nchronicle. Don’t compound aggravated damage. Reduce the effects of powers \nand Merits that give certain characters excessive advantages over others, both \nto discourage every character having the same set of Merits and to discourage the \nrise of unbeatable Narrator characters. For instance, the Herd Background for \nvampires is incredibly powerful in a chronicle that runs 24 hours, seven dam a \nweek, and it should be toned down. \nOther things that can get difficult in multi-city chronicles are supernatural \neffects that work over a distance. Powers that allow clairvoyance effects should \nbe regulated because they can cause time freezes or delays in getting information \nthat characters should have immediately. \nO T H E R  HELPFUL PROCEDURES \nLarge games and multi-city chronicles need good policies and procedures for \nmanaging information, supporting Storytellers and handling plot contingencies. \nTechnology has provided many ways for Storytellers and players to distribute \ninformation quickly. In larger games, it is often a good idea for Storytellers to get \nLARGE \nGAMESAND \nL o ~ q  \nCHRONICLES \n\n\nhelp gathering information from the players. Players of harpies, Galliards, bards \nand many other character types can be encouraged to get a copy of their \nobservations to the Storytellers. Storytellers can set up email lists for Influence \ninformation and expenditures, rules-call archiving, actions that affect the World \nof Darkness; whatever information might be necessary for you to communicate to \nmany others. Web pages are great ways to keep all game participants up to speed. \nEverything from game times and places, character biographies to information \nabout setting and rules, and even tips about how to get more involved in the game \nare helpful additions to large games and chronicles. \nToo much information can also be a problem. As the person who has been \nwriting a quarterly summary of the North American chronicle for the vampire \ngenre of the Camarilla (about 4000 players), I can tell you about information \noverload. Finding the appropriate level of information for your Storytellers and \nplayers is very important. Some Storytellers will need more information about \nparticular things like Influences, plot details or monumental actions taken by \ncharacters. Reporting to each other becomes a necessity for multi-city chronicles. \nSpeaking of administration, auxiliary Storyteller support helps a great deal \nin larger games and chronicles. Having a person who helps settle disputes \nbetween players keeps all the Storytellers on the floor during the game. Other \ntypes of non-Storyteller assistance -finding sites, doing web work, writing and \ncommunicating - \ncan also help. \nUS IN^ PSYCHOLO~Y \nA N D  C U N N I N ~ T O  \nPLANEOR \nB V E R Y T H I N ~  \nUsing psychology and cunning to plan for everything is perhaps the best key \nto a great game. In large games, plans must include character-driven plots, lulls \nin the story, players who rely on the Storytellers to inspire them, risky character \nbehavior and other players jumping on the bandwagon that others set in motion. \nA common saying in large games is that a player must also act partially as a \nStoryteller. Character-driven plots take on great force in a larger game or multi- \ncity chronicle. The Storytellers lose direct control over the majority of plot lines \nthat enter the game. \nWith respect to character-driven plots, Storytellers become plot modera- \ntors. They watch and police, using the World of Darkness and its long-standing \ncharacters to regulate the machinations of the characters. Storytellers can divert \nand redirect character plots by introducing higher-priority tasks like a visiting \ndignitary or serious attack. Altering the priority of a character-driven plot is \nuseful if a player is not restraining her character well, but don’t do it too often. \nPlayers become resentful, and they may even stop trying to put their characters’ \nagenda into play if they get stonewalled too often. Try to listen to the discussion \nthat your players have before, after and long after the game. Are they getting \nwhat they want? \nStorytellers can use less overwhelming plots to regulate character plots. \nPutting a situation in play that competes for the plotting character’s attention \nis a nice tactic, and you can also learn something about the goals of the character \nand motivations of the player. Characters who usually attend to the Storyteller \nplots over their own plots can help build momentum for other characters. \n\n\nCharacters who stick to their guns when a competing situation is introduced can \nbe used to provide a second set of plots for players who are bored. All it takes is \na little bit of material to move the character forward when a lull occurs. Be \nshrewd, learn the habits of the key players in your large game. You can also \nintroduce competing plots with the intention of drawing off some of the \ncharacters working for a lead character who is progressing too quickly. These \ntypes of “control-rod plots” are a great way to draw out stories based oncharacter- \ndriven plots that are sometimes fulfilled quickly. \nIf character-driven plots are moving the story along well, the Storyteller can \nsometimes introduce a minor side-plot to involve the few characters not already \ntaking part in the action. Introduce these “sweeper plots” carefully, though, so that \nthe characters without anything to do take the lead. You can then build that plot \ninto something that will take over in the inevitable lull that character-driven plots \nare so susceptible to. Just make sure that the secondary plot takes over the large- \ngroup action only when the character-driven plots are beginning to wane. \nCharacter-driven plots are delicate. They require a light touch and a strong \ncommitment to helping a large number of players get the most enjoyment out \nof the scenes. Be cautious that you are spending the most time moderating the \ncharacter-driven plots that incorporate lots of other players. It is easy to get \ncaught up in the development of a personal plot for a character because of the \nrewarding roleplaying and progress that you get to see, but Storytellers at large \ngames have to watch the whole game and foster the larger story. \nPlayers can also help keep a game interesting by developing character-driven \nplots. By taking the character’s goals and translating them into action in the game, \neach player becomes a catalyst for story. As more characters get involved in the \ncharacter-driven plots, the driving character will experience more roleplaying. \nBeware, though, that marching straight in with a new character and lots of 50- \nplayer plots in your character’s mind will be a disappointing experience. Take the \ntime to build some relationships between characters and form some ties that allow \nfor the larger plots. In some instances, it can take a year or more to integrate your \ncharacter’s agenda into a chronicle in such a way that he can interact effectively \nwith 50 other characters in one project. \nGETTING R I D  O E  LULLS \nAside from using moderation techniques on character-driven plots to \nalleviate lulls in the story at a large game, Storytellers can raise the intensity of \nbackground plots. Doing so is similar to the idea behind bringing a sweeper plot \ninto the limelight when character-driven plots slow down. Background plots \ncan come from a host of little plots that the characters in the game have \nforgotten about. It is good to make sure that each Storyteller at a large game has \none or two of those background plots in mind as well as a prop or character that \ncan kick off the plot. Using background plots in this way brings a sense of \ncontinuity to the game, and it results in a lot of players trying to remember what \nhappened before to set the plot in motion. \nTo set up background plots, have several Storytellers introduce plots in \nthrees for the first few games in a chronicle. Then, strengthen the plots that the \ncharacters respond to and let the ignored plots fall to the wayside deliberately. \nWrite down the forgotten plots. Look at the characters’ Backgrounds, Flaws and \n\n\nNegative Traits to find a way to integrate the forgotten plots. Then, wait for the \nopportunity to re-introduce each plot. \nLong-running Storyteller characters that are either mentors or foils (or \neven both) are also good tools for getting rid of lulls. It is best to get a distinctive \ncostume, a real attention-grabber, for Storyteller characters such as this. Talk \nloudly or very softly, but speak distinctively when portraying the Storyteller \ncharacter. Use the Storyteller character to generate continuity and remind the \nplayers of what has happened in the past. Set up relationships with many \ncharacters, and use those relationships to introduce plot after plot when the \nstory needs it. \nI N V O  L V I  \nN cj EVERY \no N E \n... is very hard. Sometimes, players are at the game to watch it like television \nor just to socialize with friends. Having an out-of-character room at larger events \nis a godsend. Character creation can take place there, as can plenty of socializing. \nPlayers (and their characters) who are there to watch the game can be \nentertained by keeping a high level of interesting roleplaying going on among \nyour resident hams. Make sure that you are initiating sweeper plots every once \nin a while to see if the wallflowers will nibble, but if not, do what you can to keep \nthe center stage lively. \nPlayers who are interested in involving others should take the initiative and \napproach the quiet ones. Sometimes these players are new, and sometimes they \nare just playing quiet characters. Take one of your character’s goals and present \nit as a joint venture. Let the quiet ones get involved at whatever level is \ncomfortable for both of you. Have your character introduce them to your \nassociates. You can make a player’s night by bringing the game to him for just \na little while. \nNever forget that you have out-of-character mechanisms to help players \nstay involved. After the game is over, ask those who seemed to do little if they \nhad fun. Ask them what they are looking for and if they need some help getting \ninvolved. Make out-of-character suggestions to some of your movers and shakers \nthat there are a few who might like to get involved in some of the grander \nschemes. All in all, involving everyone is a significant challenge and takes the \naction of both Storytellers and players in large games. \nRISKY \nCHARACTER \nBEHAVIOR \nA N D T H F  B A N D W A ~ O N  \nEEEECT \nThe crowd of characters is getting worked up, and they reach that critical \nmoment. The acting is grand, the tensions reach their crescendo, and combat \nbeings! Now what? First, have an organization plan with afew other Storytellers \nto handle mass combats and big groups. Make sure that you have simple and fast \nprocedures to name a lead Storyteller for the group, and get a few supporting \nStorytellers for the inevitable branching off and group action. Know your mass- \ncombat rules, and be prepared to set the tempo for any such group action. In \nshort, be energetic, positive, fair and in control. \nWhen players make risky moves with their characters, evaluate what the \nstory might gain from the character’s actions and consequences. Sometimes, \n\n\ncapitalizing on these types of actions is the best way to make a game more fun. \nThe benefit rarely carries over longer than a single game, though. \nOne of the more troubling aspects about players taking risky actions with \ntheir characters is that they will often look back at what they did and wonder \nwhy they did it. If things went well, they’ll just shrug and move on, but if the \nsituation went poorly, regret sets in. Talking to players who messed up in front \nof a group if you have the chance. Help them to see how the setting world and \nthe other characters respond to that sort of thing. Usually, it just takes a positive \nperspective to help players see that, while their actions may seem like huge \nscrew-ups, they’re actually just giving birth to new stories. \nI call the phenomenon that arises from this perspective the “soap opera \neffect.” Nothing exciting would happen on a soap opera if the characters didn’t \nget caught doing all the bad stuff that they do. Similarly, the story in a LARP \nimproves for a number of characters when their characters’ machinations \nbecome the object of inquiry. People follow the muddiest political battles and \nthe most outrageous court cases because it interests them and gives them \nsomething to talk about. Characters making large mistakes in front of huge \ngroups can have this same, glorious effect. \nIn fact, some players believe in the soap opera effect so much that they make \nin-character mistakes with their favorite characters deliberately. They use their \ncharacters to drop hints about bigger plots and then backtrack with guilty \nobviousness at times. Some players advocate getting your character into all sorts \nof sordid little plots that could provide a minor scandal at a large game. After you \nteach yourself to appreciate the story that you can create, it’s kind of fun to stir \nup the mud on purpose. Oh, and your character has to catch a few others at their \ndastardly deeds and expose those rascals. It’s an obligation to the story, of course. \nThe bandwagon effect is a bit harder to manage, and it really requires that \nyou have contingency plans as Storytellers. Storytellers with a couple of plots in \ntheir pockets can use the departure of the bandwagon characters to turn a large \ngame into a small game for the remaining players. It is the perfect opportunity \nto build a wonderful roleplaying session with just a few characters - \nwhich is \na treat in any large game. \nWRAPPINC~ \nUp \nThere are so many more possibilities for what you can do with large games \nand multi-city chronicles as a player or Storyteller. Each large game or multi-city \nchronicle is a unique organism that’s very different from a smaller game because \nof the changing roles of Storyteller and player, the scope of the plots that are \npossible and the social factors that start to manifest. Storytellers, remember the \nGolden Rule: Use the rules and suggestions that promote the story and fun in \nyour game. The MET system is wonderful in its flexibility and the allowances \nit makes for the story over the rules. I hope that some of the insight into large \ngames has been valuable and will help you creating pleasing stories the next time \nyou run or play in one. \n\n\nHOW DOFS IT FFFL? \nby Peter Woodworth \nWhen you play Mind’s Eye Theatre, you usually take on the role of a character \nwhose daily life includes powers and states of being that are completely alien to \nnormal human experience. Such a role demands a correspondingly creative mind \nand some in-depth roleplaying on the player’s part. Obviously, meeting this demand \nisn’t always easy, even for the best garners. Sometimes, players come instead to see \ntheir characters as little more than tragically hip humans with a range of special \ntalents and a few really killer allergies. In turn, this misconception robs some of the \nmystery and drama from a character’s supernatural existence and generally turns the \ngame from modem myth to more of a Gothic superhero comic. \nThis article’s goal is to help give players a gut-level sense of what it really feels \nlike to walk as one of the Awakened. Read on for some points of reference on some \nof the more common powers and experiences for those looking to really step into \ntheir character’s shoes. Remember, as always, that none of this information is set \nin stone. It is all material for handy reference intended to spark the right creative \nfires. If you want Garou shapeshifting to be painless or faerie enchantment to be \npurely delightful, by all means, go right ahead. It’s your game, after all. \nBearing that in mind, it often helps to remember these basic rules for playing \na supernatural creature “accurately”: \nRepeat after me: “MycharacterisNOTjustahumanwithneatsuperpwers!” \nSupernatural powers are not accidental, and characters can’t simply learn \nthem from thin air. Even fae magic still operates according to rules, however bizarre \nor arcane those rules might be. Most powers take some concentration or ritual; many \nrequire the expenditure of vital energies. Most importantly, aU powers require some \ntime to practice and master, even those that a character acquires instinctively. \nIf your character is a vampire or a wraith, he was once human, but now \nhe’s dead. He may linger on in some new, shadowy existence, but underneath it \nall lies the fact that he cheated final judgment; that he simply should not be. \nIf your character is a shapeshifter or a faerie, she was never human to \nbegin with. She looked like one for a while, and she might think like one \nstill, but like it or not, she was born of a different species. She cannot escape \nwhat she truly is forever. \nNow that that’s out of the way, let’s see what the night has in store. ... \nVAMPIRE: \nTHE \nMASQUERADE \nAWAKEN IN^ A P T E R T H E  EMBRACE \n“They’ll tell you it’s like waking up. Uh-huh. Like being born is waking up, \nmaybe. First you have to die, remember, and that hurts. Sure, it’s blissful and sweet \nat first, but then the last of your blood goes, and you realize you’ve actually been \nclimbing to the top of a cold, dark mountain, with nothing but blackness below. \nYou slip, you fall, you feel numbness spreading as the blackness reaches out to suck \nyou in. Then you splash down, liquid all around, and everything is on fire. You hit \napool of gasoline two seconds ahead of a match. Your throat is scorched, your limbs \nare burning, your whole body is a block of ice thawing out in a crematorium, and \nHow DOES IT FEEL? \n4D \n\n\nbelieve me you feel every inch of it as the flames pass over you. It drives the best \nof us crazy with pain, let me tell you. Strangest thing, though: One of the first \nthoughts you have is I’m still cold. As much hot blood as you get then or ever, you’ll \nnever quite get back what you had when you were alive.” \n- \nAd, Brujah philosopher \nT H E  HUNGER \nThe Hunger is not the unpleasant ache of skipping lunch or dinner. A human \ngoing without food or water or sex or sleep for several weeks, now there’s someone \nwho is beginning to understand a glimmer of what the Hunger feels like. It is more \nthan just a gnawing, consuming physical pain, though it is that too. Indeed, the \nHunger is more aptly named because it is a drive that devours avampire’s thoughts, \none by one, until only the idea of feeding - \nfeeding NOW, without shame or \ncaution or conscience - \nremains. It is loud, it is impatient, it is savage, it is \neverything inhuman. What’s more, it always, always wins in the end. \nE R E N Z Y  \nThe world shifts to black and white, with just a few brilliant points of color. \nThreats-color. Prey -color. Everything else simply fades into thescenery. Speech \nis an aimless, unintelligible mess, and other noises sound like they’re distorted and \nfar away. That is, unless they indicate a threat of some kind, in which case even the \nsoftest noise is as loud as a pistol fired next to the vampire’s ear. To make matters \nworse, this black and white film changes speed constantly, without warning, going \nfiompainfullyslowmotion t o a h t i c  fluny ofimagesat theedgeofcomprehension. \nWithout living nerve endings, the pain of the undead isn’t a biological \nresponse anymore, more like outrage embodied. It’s a primal sense of fear and \nanger that something is actually threatening the vampire’s immortality. A \nhuman feels agony as nerves sever and blood flows. By contrast, the vampire \nregisters a knife’s cut, but ordinary pain is replaced by a instinctive fear for his \nunlife combined with arising feeling of, “How dare she hurt me! ?” In game terms, \nboth are suffering the same Trait penalties due to the distraction of their wounds, \nbut the sensation vampires experience is quite different. \nPAIN \nDRINKING \nOnce he is able to overcome his revulsion and disgust at what he is doing, a \nvampire experiences each mortal from whom he drinks as a unique “vintage.” The \nyoung are energy embodied, and their blood flows sweet and bright, while the \nelderly are usually sluggish and heavy with an almost flat taste. Mortals who have \njust exercised (or run or fought) have an adrenaline tang to them, while those \nsleeping have a low warmth instead, like a soothing cup of tea. Blood itself has a \nfaint metallic aftertaste and slightly thick texture as it is consumed. The victim’s \nemotions play a role in the experience as well. Fear comes through as a delicious \nsour twist, while pleasure has a round, comforting taste. Each mortal at each \nmoment has a slightly different flavor, and each should be savored accordingly. \nSPENDI \nNG” BLOOD \n“First there’s a kind of push inside, like trying a move an arm or a leg that’s fallen \nasleep. It’s not too much effort, but it’s not a purely unconscious action, either. Then \n6 6  \n\n\nthere’s warmth in the arm or leg or wherever it was you willed blood to go, but it’s not \na comforting heat. It’s more like the warmth you get when you throw the last log onto \nthe fire. Itmaykeepyoufora time,butyouknowit’sgonejustthesame.Youknowthat \nbefore long, the cold will drive you out to search for more. And our winter never ends.” \n- \nFavian, Elder Setite \nC H A N ~ I N ~  \nFORMS \nCertain wise Cainites can force their bodies to flow like blood, allowing \nthem to assume different shapes. Doing so requires great discipline to avoid \ndispersing oneself, which explains why most such vampires know only one or \ntwo other shapes. First blood saturates the vampire’s entire body, spreading a \nwarm, almost lifelike tingle along the skin as it travels. Next there’s a sickening, \nalmost helpless feeling of floating apart as the blood flows into its new shape. \nFinally, the blood recedes from the outer edges of the body, surrounding the \nvampire’s entire new form with a chill hardness. \nTHE MOMENTOE \nBEING STAKED \nSome say that the heart only finally stops when the weight of years becomes too \nmuch for it to bear. Now try to imagine what the weight of immortality must feel like. \nPierced through a heart unceasing, staked vampires feel first as if the world has fallen \nupon them, a dull, immense, unyielding pressure that smothers ever part of the body \nuntil the slightest movement becomes impossible. Sensation vanishes next, as if the \nnormal world has suddenly fallen away around them, dropping them down into an \nendless well of silence, where at last they sink into the cold waters of torpor. \nWEREWOLE: \nTHE \nAPOCALYPSE \ns H A P E S H I E T I N g  \nConsider what happens in the most popular shift, from Homid to Crinos. Your \nbones warp, lengthen and fuse together again. Your muscles ripple under your skin, \nswelling and straining. Your flesh stretches and splits apart as your size shifts and your \nclaws slice their way free. Fur grows, and each hair jabs up through the skin like a \nneedle. What’s more, your senses all hit overload at once. You’re awash in smells you \nhadn’t caught, sounds you hadn’t heard, sights you couldn’t see before. The pain of \nshapeshifting is short but sharp. It’s a good pain that clears your head and sharpens \nyour will. It puts all senses on alert and readies you for battle or the hunt. Most of the \ntime, all of this happens in six seconds or less. Even though the damage done during \nthe change heals up instantly, the experience is no less intense for it. \nAnd this happens every time. \nS ~ E N D I  \n~ g ”  \nRAG E A N D  C ~ N O S I S  \nOne doesn’t spend Rage so much as explode with it. It’s anger in its purest \nmolten form, vented outward in burning, barely controlled pulses of fury. It gives \nyou power, but it also leaves a scorched, sour taste in its wake, like the aftertaste \nof a marathon or a supremely powerful adrenaline rush. \nBy contrast, spending Gnosis is the same as those rare moments where it \nsuddenly feels like the Earth is breathing with you; the perfect synthesis of you \nand the world around you. When a Gift powered by Gnosis takes effect, it seems \nonly natural because for the briefest instant, you and the world truly are one. \nt t  \nH o w  DOES IT EEEL? \n\n\nEOUR- L ~ c j c j ~ ~  \nMOBILITY \n“Running on all your legs isn’t the same as crawling on hands and knees. For one \nthing, your entire center oflalance is slung low and evenly distributed along your body, \nallowing for quick, coordinated movements, and making it very hard to budge you if \nyou’re so inclined. Also, all your limbs are equally important. Tool-users that they are, \nthis arrangement takes most humans a while to get used to. Sights are limited a bit by \nyour lower vantage point, but the rich scents and tastes found near the ground more \nthan make up for it. And there’s nothing quite like feeling fresh earth on four paws.” \n-Sasha \nBloody-Trails, Silent Strider Ahroun \nR F ~ F N E R A T I N ~  \nLike shapeshifting, regeneration is essentially a natural rather than totally \nmystical process, although it works incredibly fast. However, the Garou must endure \nall the normal unpleasantness of healing, just in a much shorter amount of time than \nothers do. Bones grind and knit back together, punctured lungs drain fluid, guardian \ncells attack infections and diseases, tom muscles sew up, and new skin spreads to \ncover missing patches. It’s painful, but the pain fuels the Rage that helps the Garou \nheal. The pain is Gaia’s way of ensuring that her guardians stay as healthy as possible. \n“At first you think, ‘This is stupid, I’m just staring at my reflection,’ but then \nyou feel this cold shiver down your spine, you know? And then things start to \nget really blurry, like you’re looking up at everything from underwater.

But instead of \neverything coming back together the way it was, it comes back looking like the \nPenumbra.

Fangs are the most intimate \nand deadly of weapons, and when matters are personal, many Garou finish them \nwith fangs. The smell of the target’s hide, the tearing punch as the teeth break \nthrough, the bitter taste of blood in the jaws, the grinding push of a struggling \nenemy or the pulsing twitch of a dying one - fangs seldom leave any doubts. \nCHANC~ELINC~: \nTHE DREAMINC~ \nB N C O U N T E R I N ~  \nS O M B T H I N ~  \nBANAL \nEven from a distance, truly Banal things seem to be surrounded by a reverse \nheat haze, where instead of being all wavy and squiggly, things seem flat, colors \nare nondescript, and outlines are painfully clear. None of it has any mystery or \ncharm. As one gets closer, the mouth goes dry, the stomach bubbles with low- \nlevel nausea, and a dull headache sets in behind the eyes, making concentration \nhard and forcing the fae to struggle for any graceful movements or clever words. \n\n\nThose who actually manage a creative act feel absurd and self-conscious, as if \nbeing watched by a bored and disapproving audience. \nSPEND I ~g ” LAM O U R  \n“Imagine how it thrills the heart to make a wish and see it come true. Glamour \nis a wild, radiant burst of energy coursing through mind and body. Sometimes, even \nthe best of us start to wonder if we can control what we’ve called up, just because \nit’s always so powerful. Even once the Glamour is spent, its fades into pleasant \nexhaustion, a sense of beauty wrested from nothing.

Mortal creativity is a boundless rainbow of sensation, and no faerie ever \nexperiences quite the same sensation twice. \nWhenrewarding Glamour, Storytellers should takecare toremember where it’s \ncoming from, and describe it accordingly, even if only briefly.

The colors I see are \nbrighter; the sounds I hear are sweeter. The chimera aren’t afraid of me any more; \nthey gather around, even here.

You’re too late.” \n-John Doe, Devereux Foundation, Kennesaw, GA \nLO SIN^ YOURSELETO \nBANALITY \nDescribing this sensation is tricky, because the fae won’t remember sliding \ninto Banality. That’s kind of the point, actually. For those who have a little more \ntime to witness their own decline, though, the ride is no less horrifying. First, the \ncolors of the chimerical world start looking bleached, the sounds come across \nflat, the once-charming scents become tired and musty. Like a receiver picking \nup two stations at once, the mortal world begins to overlap the chimerical more \nand more often. The overlap from mere flickering seconds to several minutes at \na time, which can have predictably disastrous consequences in moments of stress \nH o w  DOES IT EEEL? \ne \n\n\n-- \n-. \n-. \nc\nor drama. Worst of all, the character starts forgetting the details of his faerie life \nas Banality climbs higher. Chimera seem frightening and strange; putting names \nto faces becomes a real chore, even with close friends and oathmates; reminisc- \ning on times past, be they good or ill, is an exercise in tearful frustration. \nFinally, the changeling can’t remember who sh is, what her place is in this \nstrange world or why she’s seeing the things she is, and she simply drops out of \nthe chimerical world. Her Banal mind chooses to ignore what she is no longer \ncapable of understanding. \nWRAITH: \nTHE OBLIVION \n~ A I N I N J L O S I N B  PATHOS \nGaining Pathos from positive feelings can only be compared to those sublime \nmoments in life when you feel like you could live on an emotion alone, that if you \nfelt it any more intensely your heart would simply soar away and burst into a \nbrilliant shower of fireworks. It’s a tangible pulse formed from the moment when \nyou look into someone’s eyes and think to yourself, “I think I could lift the world \nand live forever, if they asked me to.” Pathos gained from negative feelings, on the \nother hand, is a concentrated morsel of the icy, rotten surge of pleasure that you \nreceive when you drag a hated rival through the mud or witness the anguish on a \nformer lover’s face when your words open their old wounds afresh. \nLosing Pathos is just the opposite. It’s the empty, spent feeling that comes \nwhen you’ve given everything you have to give, or the chill, listless void that \nreplaces the heart when one’s beloved breaks the bond for the final time. \nMemory of the passion remains, at once comforting and painful, but that is all. \n~ A I N I N $  LOSING \nANGST \nAngst gained whispers, “You have come all this way and suffered and felt \nso much, but it’s all for nothing, nothing, NOTHING.” Different from the \nenergizing if wicked rush that is gained from negative Pathos, Angst is a \ncrippling, burning poison of the soul. It rockets through the character like a \nbullet train of sickening despair until it reaches the deepest recesses of the heart. \nThere it crashes in an explosion of defeat and shame, leaving a festering, oozing \nwound on the psyche. No matter how much Pathos you lose or gain, Angst \nremains the mocking voice of nothingness beneath it all. It laughs and reminds \nyou always that come rise or fall, the void is ever watching.. . and ever hungry. \nAngst lost surpasses in intensity only a dozen or so things: an eleventh-hour \npardon for the condemned, a joyous reconciliation for the broken-hearted, a \nChristmas armistice for the weary soldier, a child born to the previously barren. \nRegardless, the underlying truth is the same. The void can be defeated, the soul \ncan triumph, and existence can be everlasting and glorious. \nSTEP PIN^ T H R O U G H  SOMETHINC~ \nSOLID \n“It’s a weird mix, man. When you first touch something solid from the other \nside, there’s this really intense, really plastic feeling, like your skin’s trying to \nmorph around it instead of going through. Half a second, tops, but it’s scary. You \nthink you might just stretch and stretch and stretch until you just are that thing, \nyou know? Then this deep, hollow feeling eats your guts, and you get the serious \n\n\nitchy-crawlies, like little spiders are walking all over you. Then poof! You’re you \nagain, but a little less you, like some got left behind, you know?” \n- \nSkinny Jimmy, enfant Spook \nOne moment, thoughts are flitting by normally; the next, it’s like you’re pulling \neach one fromquick-dry cement. They’re still coming, but slower and with more and \nmore effort. That feeling keeps getting worse until you realize that your thoughts \naren’t getting stuck, something else is puulng from the other side. As thoughts slide \naway faster andfaster, fearpounces, asliding, lunging, gripping terror ofquite literally \nlosing your mind to this dung. You dig in as hard as you can, ripping your nails, tearing \nyour mind, but at last - \nin agony- you black out.. . and wake up to a nightmare. \nCrossing into the Tempest immediately swirls the senses into adizzy blur. You can \nsee sounds, smell textures and touch the darkness all around you. This disorientation \nlasts but a moment for experienced travelers, but for others it can easily prove their \nundoing. Moving is like walking at the dim bottom of a weightless sea, surrounded by \nan intangible, enveloping fluid, where sudden movements or bright lights seem alien \nand out of place. And although your other senses return to normal, the feeling of being \nable to touch the darkness around you never completely fades away. \nLOSING \nC O N T R O L T O  YOUR OTHER SIDE \nMOVINC~THROUGH \nT H E  TEMPEST \nBEING MOLIATED \n“Funny how the worst memories stick with you, even now. I remember being \nin high school, wanting so badly to fit in somewhere, but no matter what I did or \nhow I tried to change, I was always rejected. I went from too fat, too prudish, too \nnerdy and too casual to being too thin, too popular, too slutty and too snobby. \nStrange as it sounds, being Moliated is a lot like that. You watch as someone else’s \nhands take your soul and twist it into whatever shape they want. It doesn’t always \nhurt - \nnot physically - \nbut it’s always intrusive and clumsy, like someone trying \nto add a piece to your personality by slapping it on with bricks and mortar.” \n-Karen \nHarrington, Reaper \nFirst contact with the skin of the mortal to be ridden is electric. There’s a \nsharp, sizzling tingle, as if the soul inside is warning off its competition. Once \ninside, it’s like being wrapped in a warm, pulsing cocoon. The sights and sounds \nof the Underworld are blessedly indistinct, as if perceived through a thin, \nbreathing membrane. The sensations of the host, however, are vivid and clear, \nalthough they too sometimes feel as if they’re being received on a slight delay, \nwhich is a source of endless frustration to wraiths trying to vicariously relive the \npleasures of mortality. \nSKINRIDING \nHUMANS \nB E I N G  \nE E D P R O M B Y A  \nVAMPIRE \n“When you’re bitten, you have just enough time to think, ‘Hey, that hur- \n’before the ecstasy begins.

You could reach out and actually touch your soul \nif you wanted to. Of course, that’s because the bastard is stealing it from you, and \npart of you even knows it, deep down. But it’s so beautiful, so powerful, that the \nrest of you doesn’t even care. That’s the scariest part of all.” \n-Bethany, \nformer Blood Doll \nTHE DELIRIUM \n“When I was sixteen, I was in a car accident. I only saw the other car right \nbefore it hit. Time seemed to slow down, sure, but there was still this horrible \nsinking feeling in my stomach.

That’s \nwhat it feels like when you see one of these monsters start changin’. It’s big, it’s \nscary, it’s all happening far too fast to be real, but deep down your instincts know \nbetter, ’cause they take over. There’s no bravery or retreat or thought. You just \nrun until you can’t move, and you scream until your lungs want to collapse. \nThen, if you’re lucky, you’ll only remember that slow-time in your nightmares.” \n-Tasker \nGarrison, Chicago \nB E I N C ~  \nBNCHANTED \n‘‘‘I~s \nmagical!’ ‘It’s glorious!’ ‘It’s every dream I’ve ever had!’ Bulkhit!

Sure, it’s not too bad at first; \nyour heart races, there’s a fluttering in your stomach, and this bright, refreshing \nfeeling, like you’re finally using your senses for the first time in your life. And it \nis pretty damn amazing, especially the first time, like a storybook painting come \nto life, if you’ll pardon a cliche. Trouble is, deep down you know that this story \nwon’t go away when you want it to, and trust me, it doesn’t take much of creepy \nlittle feeling of unreality before you start sliding to the edge of the big cliff marked \n‘CRAZY.’ Especially when you remember how nasty the endings of most fairy \ntales are.” \n-Steve Rhodes, embittered Kinain \nB E I N 9  POSSESSED \n“It starts with a sudden shudder, rising from your toes and going up your \nspine and into your soul.

I’m flying!” \nJessica sailed into his arms in what seemed to be cinematic slow motion, her \nlong red hair and bright green sundress with its starburst pattern of sunflowers \nfanning out around her as she drifted through space. Laughing carelessly, Martin \ncaught her and spun around in dizzy circles. \n“OK, that’s enough of that,” he rumbled as his own stomach started to \nprotest, using his deepest Daddy voice. “I don’t want us to be all woogly before \nsmile across his face. He was not as young as he used to be -not by a long stretch \n- \nand the effort and the sun had given him a nice sheen of sweat. \n“Martin!” He didn’t need to feel his wife’s hand on his a n n  to know she was there. \nOn magical days like this, he thought, no one would. “Honestly, honey, I thought you \nwere going to make her sick, you spun her so hard!”There was no reproach in the words, \nCarol batted at his shoulders playfully. “OK, strong guy, put me down!” \n“Why should I?” He spun faster, and she redoubled her laughter. “I could do \n“you’ll wake up Jessica!” \nCarol’svoice was hot and scandalized in his ear. He just grunted in response, \nlowering his head to kiss the warmth at the nape ofher neck. She purred, digging \nher nails into his back with luxurious ease, their beat at once sweet and merciless \nas they fulfilled each other. \n“You were saying?” He whispered, not letting up. Her only response was to \nplant her hands on his chest and roll him over, their bodies slipping exquisitely \nacross the silk sheets they saved for occasions like this. His promotion, the one \nthey’d been waiting for, the one that would move them from the tiny apartment \nto the house by the park they’d been talking about since before Jessica even came \nalong. Two champagne flutes -both \nemptied about half an hour ago - \nstood \non the dresser by the bed, looking almost elegant in the candlelight. “DO you \nwant me to stop?” he teased, leaning up to kiss her. \n“Don’t you dare!” she hissed, pushing him back down with a wicked smile. \nShe moved, and he moved with her to keep the rhythm. She glanced over her \nshoulder at the trim white bassinet in the comer where Jessica was (hopefully) still \ndeep in the blessedly peaceful sleep she had slipped into at the start of the evening. \nA smile rounded her lips, the kind of smile he’d only seen since Jessica was born, \nand when she kissed him next, he could almost taste the love flowing between \nthem at the infinite bridge their lips made. I? just don’t know if we should be \nthis for hours, and besides, if you don’t stop making so much noise \nI I  \n\n\nA face like sculpted wax loomed out of the darkness, eyes burning like twin red Fw \ncandles, and Martin nodded as best he could, blinking the blood out of his good eye. \nAgainst his will, his pained, red-tinted gaze kept wandering to where Carol lay, not \nfive feet away, her eyes gazing at him purely by chance, a thin line of blood dripping \nfromthecornerofhermouthtoagrowingpuddleonthefloor. \nInhishead, apanicked \nvoice kept repeating the same phrase over and over, in disbelief: Her head can’t be like \nthat; it’s not a naturul angle. Her head can’t be like that; it‘s mt a natural angle. \nThe cadence continued until he felt like screaming again. He wanted to \nscream so loud that he couldn’t hear himself anymore, inside or out. \n“If I take my hand away, will you scream again?” the candle-man asked. \nMartin shook his head and hoped he was right. “Not that it much matters \nanyway. I doubt there’ll be much wind left in you when you see this next treat \nI have in store.”The other hyenas around him laughed, savoring their prey’s fear. \nOh God not Jessica please please God don’t let these animals take her too. God \nif there’s any mercy in Heaven please don’t please please please.. . \nThere she was before him, still in her pajamas with her arms pulled behind \nher. One muscled arm cinched around her neck, and those hideous eyes burned \njust over her shoulder. She was tall and beautiful - \nhis eyes, her mother’s hair, \nher very own face and form - \nand the fear in her eyes sent a fresh surge of pain \nand hatred through him. He tensed to spring, not caring about himself, but a \ndozen cold, iron hands snapped out and pulled him back. \n“Daddy?“ Jesse asked, her voice small and frightened, pleading and believing in the \nfather who had once spun her around so easily to carry her away from this nightmare. \nThen the creature angled his head, opened his mouth, his obscene fangs \nlong and deadly in the dim light, and Martin’s world collapsed. \n0 \n0 \ne \n“Sir? Sir, are you alright?” \nA hand grabbed his shoulder and shook him like a carrion-eater worrying \na warm body for signs of life. \nMartin blinked as a face - \nwoman, elderly, the head librarian if he recalled \ncorrectly - \nsharpened into focus. He sat up slowly, shaking his head as details of \nwhere and when he was started filtering back. Pittsburgh? Allentown? No, that \nhad been a while ago. Philadelphia? Yes. That was it. At the public library. He \nbrought his watch into view - \n6:30. So early? His body would’ve sworn it was \nmidnight. The dream came back to him as well, full on, and he felt his blood \nturning cold even as his breathing grew faster. The final scene ran in an obscene \nMoebius strip motion picture behind his eyes. Too much, too much, too much.. .. \nThat never happened, his inner voice of reason reminded him. 7% \nnever \nhappened. You’re taking their faces and putting them onto other people’s bodies, and \nyou have to stop. You’re afraid - \nand you better be - \nbut that never happened, and \nit never will. Carol andJessica are safe, away from this madness, just like you left \nthem. Martin had given this speech to himself every time he woke up for two \nyears, and it still brought tears to his eye. Left them. But he didn’t need that now. \nBesides, the litany had worked its familiar magic and he felt the tension begin \nto release its nervous grip. He began fumbling with his good hand for the sheaf \nof notes on the table; he was supposed to meet Valentine in 15 minutes. \n\n\n“Sir! Are you sure you’re alright ?” the librarian demanded. He could see in her \neyes that she was moments away from calling an ambulance. Or maybe the police. \nYes, Officer, there’s a suspicious-looking man here, and he seems to be having some kind \nof an episode. Well, I thought you should know because he looks like he’s been through \na war. That’s right. He’s got an eye patch on his left eye, and his right hand is a lump of \nshiny pink meat. Dangerous? Yes, he looks very dangerous. Come right away. \nPutting on the best smile his weary heart could manage, he said, “I’m sorry, \nma’am, I must’ve just dozed off.” With all the energy he had left, he stood up and \nstretched tired, cramped muscles. “Guess these old county records weren’t as \nfascinating as I thought, eh? Not exactly Ian Fleming, I have to say.” \nShe hesitated, standing well away now that Martin was wide awake and \nstanding. She gestured to the wide leather ledgers still splayed across the table, \navoiding direct eye contact. “DO you need to look at these some more, or.. . ?” \nMartin scanned the notes he’d made. At least it looked like he’d been productive \nbefore he slipped off. “No, that’s OK, I think I found what I was looking for.” She swept \nup the books and was about to walk away when he called to her. “There is one more \nthing I need, actually.” The librarian stopped warily. “I thd I need to find a nice hotel \nfor tonight,” he lied, smiling. “Do you have a city phone book?” \n0 \n0 \n0 \nValentine waited for him outside, sitting on the curb seemingly absorbed in \nwatching the traffic. His tall, lanky frame was lost in a heavy overcoat that puddled \nThat business trip would have been Martin’s last if not for Valentine and \nthe others. They had been stalking the creature for almost as long as it had been \nstalking Martin, but its bold early-evening attack had surprised them all. \nNeither they nor Martin had any idea why it wanted him so badly - \nMartin \nhadn’t even known that such horrible things existed, much less might be looking \nfor him -but his saviors never gave it a chance to explain. As a result of that \nnight, Martin had lost most of one hand, one of his eyes and any chance that he \nmight sleep soundly again. The others had convinced him to stay with them “for \nthe time being” until they could be sure that he and his family were safe from \nfurther depredation. Like a revenge-bent madman, he had given up everything \nto join a group of strangers who hunted monsters. \nYet despite everything he had given up, he was still alive now, and that \ncounted for something. His family was at least marginally safe as long as they \nstayed away from him. He and his partners were successful for the most part, and \nhe had not been wounded again. In fact, they had lost only one of their number \nsince Martin had joined them. Regardless of the madness of their lifestyle, \nMartin knew a strange sort of security that he wouldn’t have felt had he turned \nhis fellow hunters down that night a lifetime ago in Pittsburgh. \nMartin looked around - \nforce of habit once the sun went down - \nand \nhurried to where Valentine was waiting for him. “I thought I was meeting you \nCharacteristically, Valentine’s shrug said almost as much as his words did. \n“’Changed my mind. Didn’t feel like waiting.” He stood and brushed off the city \nat FDR Park,” he said when they joined up. \n\n\ngrime, and the two of them walked to where Valentine’s car was parked. Soon, I \nthey were just one more moving piece in the nightly commuter parade. Once \nthey were safely underway, the young man spared him a casual sideways glance. \n“Find what you were looking for?” \nMartin held up his notebook. “Fake name, old address and even a phone \nnumber. Took a damn bit of digging, but I finally found a deed that hadn’t been \nburied in legalese, and it looks like he - \nit - \nstill owns the place, judging by \nthe listing I came across. It was about 10 years old, but what’s 10 years to one \nof these things, right?” \nI \nI \nI \nI \n4 \n“Right,” Valentine said evenly. “Good job.” \nAs was usually the case, Valentine faced this mission with steely equanimity. \nHe never got excited before or during a hunt, he claimed, because giving in to \nexcitement made him sloppy. Since what had happened in Allentown, Valentine \nnever said much of anything anymore. Martin, on the other hand, remained quiet \nand outwardly calm for a different reason. The only excitement he felt on the hunt \nwas the ice-water pulse of clammy fear. It took his every reserve to marshal it and \nrein it in, even though he never faced the monsters in person. \n“Hilton. Kevin and Chambers are there now. Denise and \n“So where did we wind up this time?” he asked, hoping to change the subject. \nI \nI \n1 \n“Thanks.” \n1 \np‘ \n’ \ndinner. Your news should be nice for desert, yeah?” \nfingers on top of the steering wheel idly, but he might have been asleep for all \nthe excitement he showed. \nThe silence stretched out between them, and the song on the radio separated \nthem like an invisible wall. It was nothing Martin recognized, of course, but it had \na decent beat, so he watched the river, the city and then the busy anonymity of \nsuburbia flow by, trying not to see himself reflected in the glass. \n0 \n0 \n0 \nI \nI \n, \n“So tomorrow Denise and I will do some recon, learn the layout of the \nneighborhood, exit routes, anything else that we might need to know about,” \nChambers began once everyone had eaten and given their reports. “Martin, I’d like \nyou to go to city hall and see if you can get the plans for the building interior. Most \nI places in that area are rowhouses, though, so if you can’t find that specific one, see \nifyoucangetaplanforthattypeofhouse. We’llstructureourstrategy to workaround \nI any alterations it might’ve made if needs be. Valentine, escort him, same as before.” \nChambers was making his usual rounds, the casual authority they’d granted \n1 \nhim full in his voice. He’d been a Marine for 10 years before starting this \nludicrous crusade, and everyone deferred to him when it came to planning an \nactual attack. “Last but not least -Kurt, you and Kevin mind holding down the \nfort while we’re away?” Sounds of agreement all around. Chambers grinned, \nreaching for the last of the lo mein. “Alright then, I’d say we’re ready to go. Nine \n1 o’clock sound good to everyone?” \nThe others winced a little, but Martin and sleep were old enemies now. “Fine \nby me,” he agreed, and the others voiced their assent behind him, not wanting to \nbe shown up by their oldest (and newest) member. That brought the official \n1 meeting to a close, and out came the ceiebratory alcohol. They didn’t drink too \nI much, of course, but they had enough to bring on a temporary feeling of release. \nI \n\n\nExcept Martin. Pleading eyestrain from a day of paging through old records, he \nwanderedoff to bed, shrugging off their familiar pitying looks. Pour oldguy, he figured \nthey were thinking. He’s crippled, and he still does m e  than his share. He didn’t want \nor need their pity. The only thing he wanted from them - \na reliable way out of this \ninsane life they led - \nwas something they couldn’t give him, no matter how they \nmomised to be trying to find it. No matter how much they’d done for him since he \njoined them, he Auidn.t help but hate them all a little when they pitied him. He \nwanted to go home, but they kept telling him that it wasn’t safe. They kept relying \non him to help them while they protected him, and they tried only occasionally to \nfind out what he had done to attract the ill attention of one of the undead. They \nconvinced him not to leave, yet they pitied him for still wanting to. \nAfter lying in bed thinking along those lines for nearly an hour, Martin still \nfelt nowhere near sleepy. Instead, he found himself groping through his knap- \nsack until he found the notebook he’d been using earlier that day. He flicked on \nthe bedside light so he could make out his looping handwriting. \nFrank Clark, the notes read. Hmmm. Nice anonymous name for a monster \nto hide under, totally unaware that it had been discovered. Thanks to Martin’s \ndogged research, his people knew where Mister Clark lived. In 48 hours, they \nwere going to make their move, and the monster didn’t even suspect. They knew \nits defenses and its disguises, and they were going to kill it. They were informed, \narmed and ready. They had been tracking this particular creature since before \nthe Allentown fiasco, and they were finally in a position to strike. \nafter they had left Greg behind with half his face blown off. Instead of a sleeping, \nundead monster, they had found no less than 10 armed men waiting for them, \nand Greg had been the first through the thing’s haven door. The rest of them had \nfled instantly, spattered with their comrade’s blood, bone and hair, but their \nescape was a narrow one. After everyone regrouped at the temporary safe house, \nthey nearly disbanded their crusade, even over Chambers’ enraged protests. \nThey would have gone their separate ways entirely if not for the fear that they \nwould be hunted down individually. \nAnd there was truth to the fears; after Allentown, they had been unable \nto deny that at least one of the monsters was aware of who they were and was \ntracking them. Martin’s hindsight wondered at how they could’ve been so \nfoolish as to be believe that word of their efforts wouldn’t travel eventually. \nAllentown had been a trap, pure and simple, and although they’d managed to \nget everyone except Greg out alive, there was no need for anyone to point out \nthat they couldn’t possibly be so lucky next time. They didn’t even know what \nthey’d done to give themselves away the last time, and the one who’d \nuncovered them was still out there. \nWhat if this is your time? the nagging voice in Martin’s mind demanded. How \nsure are you that the information you found isn’t exactly what the monster wanted you \nto find? If you don’t kill this thing that calls itself Clark, you’ll all be dead. No use in \ndenying it. Even if you do destroy it, though, how long until another one picks up your \ntrail? You don’t even know how many are on to you. What, you think the other \ncreaturesaregoingtocorneout, shakehands, say ‘Wellplayed andlet youoffthefield? \nThat’s crazy and you know it. \n\n\nMartin did know it. He had said the same to the other hunters since the \nbeginning, and they just turned it around in his face as another reason that he \ncouldn’t go back to his family yet. \nYou’regettingold, Martin, and you’recrippkdon topofthat, hisvoice ofreason \npersisted. How mny more months can you live like this? Cold sweat beaded on his \nbrow. Always looking over your shoulder for things that you might not even be able EO \nsee coming at all anyway? Living on takeout food like a scavenging rat. Let’s be \nrealistic, Marty old boy - \nmaybe four or fiwe tops. \n“Stop it,” he whispered to himself, closing the notebook and turning over \nI \nfretfully. He knew it wasn’t too healthy, talking to himself like that, but ever \nsince Greg had died he’d worked through his feelings by making them into an \nadversarial inner dialogue. Besides, if a little indulgence like this helped keep \nhim mostly sane in the long term, he was more than happy to put up with it. “I’m L,- \nDon’t be an idiot. You’ll wind up dead somewhere -you and probably everyone \nwith you now -and for what? Do you honestly think this little group can destroy them \nall? What will it really mean that you gave up your life for this bloody crusade? One \nthat no one else even knows about anyway? Don’t try to kidme. You know the answer \nas well as I do. \n“But the others-” \nMartin rolled over, hearing the laughter and low tones \nof conversation in the room beyond. “I owe them for saving my life.” \n1 .  \ndoing this because it needs to be done. Because the monsters have to be stopped.” \n‘ \nI \nI \nYou’we repaid any debts 10 times over. Besides, they’re as good as dead now too \nGregwasn’tstupidorunpreparedorevenafraid, \nbut he’s stilldead. It’sgoingtohappen \nto all of you. You’re not going to save the world, Martin. \n2 II r a  \nC’ \nI \nI \nMartin began weeping softly, as he had so many nights before this. \nAnd knock that ojf. It’s distracting. Martin’s tears obediently hitched into \nshallow breaths as he listened. So you’re aU doomed, so what? It’s just time you faced \nit, that’s all. I don’t like it any more than you do, but while you just lie there and pine for \nCarol andJesse all the time, I’ve been thinking. I’ve been doing a lot of thinking, and I \nthink1 might havefounda way out after all. Now listenclosely Martin, andmaybe some \nday soon you won’t need afnend like me anyme. You’ve still got the thing’s phone \nnumber, and your little attack isn’t going to happen for two m e  whole days.. . \nL \n11 \nIn the darkness, Martin listened. \nTwo endless days passed. \nRecon came and went, watching the house for signs of dangers that might have \nbeen missed the first, second, even third time around. Chambers came up with the \nplan of attack, as usual. He, Kevin and Valentine would go through the front door, \nwhile Kurt and Denise swept through the back exit and Martin would wait in the \nvan, which would be idling and ready to roll as soon as the last team member jumped \nin. Out of arrogance or stupidity, the monster lived alone, so they would go in before \nsundown, cut the thing’s head off and torch its home before it even woke up. \nAttacking in daylight upped their risk of being spotted and recognized, but the idea \nwas preferable to that of facing one of these things after dark. Plus, they’d managed \nto avoid police entanglements thus far with no problems. \n0 \n0 \n0 \nI \nI \nI \n1 \nI \n\n\nMartin smiled at all the right points, nodded when it was his turn and \njoined the team prayer with true sincerity. Denise even commented on how \ncheerful he seemed for once, and Martin simply clapped her on the shoulder \nwith his healthy hand. \n“Each one we get is one step closer to going home, right?” he said, and they \nall shared a laugh at that. Valentine even grunted an affirmative, which was as \nclose to hearty approval as Martin expected to get from him. \nHalf an hour more passed, and Martin sat alone in a van two blocks from \nthe monster’s den. The others had crept to their places at either door of the \nhouse, and everyone wore radio earphones to remain in contact. \n“Everybody ready? Chambers asked quietly over the crackling, staticky frequency. \nEveryone murmured assent one by one. \nthe basement door creak open, and he saw the dark stairwell leading downward \nNo turning back now, Martin, his voice of reason told him. Start the car. Get \ngoing before you find out if that thing in there changed its mind since yesterday. \nMartin started the car, but he didn’t drive away right then. Before he could \nconvince himself otherwise, he folded down his radio mic and said, “I’m sorry \neveryone. There wasn’t any other way.” \nThe sound of heavy-caliber gunfire cut off his comrades’ sounds of confu- \nsion and thundered in his earphone. Someone screamed - \nChambers maybe, \nor Kevin - \nand Martin yanked the radio apparatus up off his head. He dropped \nit in his lap on top of his crippled hand, put the van in gear and peeled away in \na smoky squeal of tires. His voice of reason congratulated him on doing the right \nthing, finally, but the tinny, small shouts coming from the earphone in his lap \ndrove nails through his ears. He tossed the small piece of equipment into the \nback of the van, but even then, he believed he could still hear the confused and \nangry screams of people who have been betrayed. \n0 \nMartin could’ve made it home in under six hours if he’d been driving full- \ntilt, and indeed every time he ducked off the highway to take a detour down a \nback road, his heart cursed him for delaying his reunion with Carol and Jesse that \nmuch longer. Reason won out, though, and his paranoid habits were just too \nstrong. He hadn’t come this far just to let some two-bit flunky of “Mister Clark” \nfollow him home and renege on the deal, after all. So he kept to back roads as \noften as he could, checked his rearview mirror often and otherwise turned a six- \n\n\nhour trip into a full 22-hour trek. By the end, coffee was all that kept him \nawake.. . that and the voice in the back of his head. He wondered blearily if it \nwould stay with him forever, growing louder even as his current nightmares \nfaded in the renewed light of family life. \nBut the thoughts faded away as Martin turned off the highway for the last \ntime. All he had to do was ditch the van somewhere and call a cab to take him \nhome. Not a safehouse or a dingy hotel that accepted only cash. Home. His \nhome. He’d need a convincing lie to explain where he’d been for so long, but he \ncould think of that later. All he could think about now were two smiling faces \nhe hadn’t seen in a lifetime of fear. \nsmelled like? Martin couldn’t imagine, but there it was again, full force, the scent \nof his very own house and family. \nHe took a step toward the staircase, but froze in sudden indecision. As happy \nas he was, should he really go upstairs right then? He’d surely scare the life out \nof his wife and daughter if he did. He looked like a monster that was falling apart, \nand that was nothing to wake up to in the dead of night. Plus, what if Carol and \nJesse didn’t even want to see him? What if they thought he had run out on them, \nand seeing him only made them angry? The waiting was intolerable now that he \nhim back. Surely they’d be glad to see him again, but maybe.. . \n“Tough call, isn’t it?” a scratchy voice said from the shadows through the \ndoorway into his kitchen. At once Martin’s heart became a block of ice. He could \nactually feel the muscle clench like a stalled pendulum; pregnant with motion and \nyet unmoving. The voice was as hot as his blood was cold, and hate sparked from \nit like fire seeds drifting from a lava flow. The presence of such strong emotion was \nalien to the sound, but Martin recognized the voice immediately. \nIt was Valentine. \nWell shit, Martin, his voice of reason whispered lamely. \n“Wake them up now, give them heart failure?” Valentine continued, \ncoming no closer, “or sit on the porch and play with yourself until morning, \nhoping that the sight ofyou indaylight won’t drop yourpretty wife inher tracks?” \nValentine stepped forward into the pool of streetlight illumination that \ncame in through the window from outside. He clutched a thick wad of deeply \nstained cloth against his neck, and a dark beard of dried blood stained the front \nof his shirt. A long, superficial cut trailed out from under the makeshift pressure- \nbandage and split his earlobe in half. Chambers appeared in the door behind \nhim, leaning on a shotgun as a crutch. A cinched belt squeezed his left leg just \nbeneath the crotch, choking off a bad cut in the middle of his thigh. Both men \ncame toward Martin with fire in their eyes. \n“Love of God,” Martin managed to gasp, speaking as slowly and softly as \npossible so as not to wake up his family. “I thought you were dead! Thank God \nyou’re alive.” \nwas actually home, but he wanted to do this right so his family would welcome \nValentine’s eyes narrowed. \n\n\n“Don’t, old man,” he rasped fiercely. Talking screwed up his face with pain, \nbut he didn’t stop. “Don’t even.” \nChambers bumped into the banister rail and sat down on the bottom step. \nThe stairs led up to Martin’s family’s bedrooms. Chambers’ eyes were glassy and \nunfocused, but he held the shotgun steadily. He propped it up on the step beside \nhim and pointed the business end at Martin. \n“I’m going to kill him, Val,” the man said. \n“Quiet,” Valentine said over his shoulder. “I told you no.” \nMartin had never seen Valentine like this. Even after Greg had died, \nValentine had showed little emotion, despite the fact that he and Greg had been \nthe best of friends. He had cried with the rest of them, but he had gotten on with \nhis life and his mission afterward. Now, he was a man possessed. \n‘Valentine listen,” Martin said, raising his good arm warily. “What I did-” \n“I said don’t lie to me!”Valentine shouted. Shouting ripped the inside of his \nsavaged throat raw, and he coughed up a wad of bloody phlegm for his effort. \nWhen he spoke again, it was in a whisper. “Clark told us everything, you piece \nof shit. If you lie again, it’ll be the last thing you do.” \n“Clark?” Martin gawped. \n“Clark,” Valentine said. “Yes, he was there, waiting behind a line ofhis little \nrent-a-cop soldiers. That bastard stayed up all day waiting for us. He had an awful \nlot to say when the gunfire stopped and he was the only one left, though. He told \nus about your little phone call. He told us about Greg.” \n“Greg?” Martin whispered in horror. “What about Greg?” \nFrom the stairway, Chambers cocked the shotgun viciously and half rose \nfrom his seated position. The end of the barrel wobbled, but it pointed mostly \nin Martin’s direction. Valentine glared angrily at Chambers, while Martin \nlooked with rabbit eyes, but Chambers stood his ground. \n“I’m going to do it,” he said. “He’s lying.” \n“Put it down,” Valentine hissed at his partner. “Now.” \nChambers hesitated for a long time then finally sank back down on the step. \nHe still pointed the shotgun at Martin, though. \n“I told you, Martin,” Valentine said. His voice layered anger over a barely \nnoticeable hint of sorrow. “Don’t lie to us. Clark told us everything before we put \nhim down. He told us about how you set us up in Allentown and again yesterday. \nWe know everything already.” \n“Allentown?” Martin said. His jaw hung down, and ice ran in his \nveins. “I didn’t have anything to do with Allentown. I don’t care what \nClark told you, Valentine.” \nValentine just shook his head. “I almost want to believe you, old man. But \nthat’s what got us here. It’s really amazing how many of us you got rid of before \nwe figured you out.” \n“Valentine, please,” Martin said desperately. “You’ve got to believe me.” \n“We already made the mistake,” Valentine said. “We’re not listening any more.” \nHe went over to the stairwell and helped Chambers to his feet. \nChambers wobbled dangerously, and Valentine had to strain to support \nhim. They stood and made their way slowly back toward the kitchen and \n\n\nthe house’s back door. Martin stood mute in shock then took a tentative \nstep toward the two wounded men. \n“Where are you going?” he asked. “What are you going to do?” Why had \nthey even come, if not to kill him? \n“Nothing,” Valentine said thinly, breathing heavily in his effort to keep \nChambers moving. The light had gone out of Chambers’ eyes, but he shuffled \nforward zombie-like anyway. The shotgun hung limply from his hand by the \ntrigger guard that had caught around his finger. “We’re leaving. If you’re smart, \nyou’ll do the same.” \n“What?” Martin walked over and grabbed Valentine by the arm. “What \nare you saying?’ \nValentine shook free, nearly dropping Chambers as he did so. ‘Ws the best \nchance you’re going to get,” he said. “And it’s better than you deserve. We \nthought Clark was lying about you, but we looked through his stuff before we left. \nHe had your name and address and everything else he might want to know about \nyou printed out in his records. When the rest of the bloodsuckers come looking \nfor him, they’re going to find out about you, and they’re going to come looking \nfor some answers. They’re going to come here first, you can be sure.” \n“But.. . my family,” Martin said helplessly. “I’ve got to-” \n“They’re not here,” Chambers mumbled, seeming to fight for every second \n“What?” \nValentine scowled at his wounded comrade, but he turned back to Martin \n‘Where are they?” Martin half demanded, half pleaded. After what he’d \n“We moved them after you joined up with us.” \nT h a t ? ”  Martin said again stupidly. The muscles in his knees tried to stop \nworking, and he had to lean against the doorjamb just inside the kitchen. \n“We didn’t tell you because we didn’t want you running out to try and see \nthem before we figured out why the bloodsucker was stalking you in Pittsburgh,” \nValentine said. “Once we took care of that one, we were going to take you to see \nthem. We couldn’t risk it before then, though. That’s how we work.” \nof consciousness. “Dumb shit.” \nwith a pained sigh. “They’re not,” he confirmed at last. \ndone and how far he’d come.. . \nMartin started crying, and Valentine snorted in disgust. \n“They’re not here?” he said, mainly to himself. \n“Better follow their example,” Valentine said. He said it without turning \nback, now that he had gotten Chambers moving again. He paused at the back \ndoor just long enough to open it, but even then, he didn’t look back. “You’d best \nget going now, Martin. There are monsters everywhere, and they know where \nyou are. And if I ever see you again.. ,” \nValentine finished the threat and carried Chambers the rest of the way \noutside, but Martin didn’t hear it. He also didn’t hear the sound of Valentine’s \ncar pulling away into the night. He couldn’t even enjoy the silence now that he \nwas alone in what had been his home. His voice of reason was far too loud in his \nears. It laughed and laughed, drowning out all other sounds. \n\n\nANTAGONISTS THAT MATTFR \nd \nby David Tancredi \nRegardless of its scope, depth or genre, every story has the same basic \ningredients. Each tale follows a viewpoint character. Every character strives to \nattain some goal. Some obstacle always stands in the way of any worthwhile goal. \nThe action of any story that can rightly call itself a story includes the character \novercoming the obstacle in order to achieve his goal. In many stories- especially \nin stories told through live-action roleplaying - \nthe obstacle in question is \nrepresented by a dynamic, thrilling antagonist. An antagonist makes an obstacle \nof himself by either striving to reach the viewpoint character’s goal first himself or \nby doing everything he can to keep the viewpoint character from reaching it at all. \nCreating thrilling adversaries on a regular basis isn’t easy, though. It takes \ntime to develop an opponent that can challenge players. Care must be taken to \nensure that antagonists don’t overrun the current story, overpower the troupe \nor draw the spotlight away from players. When you, as a Storyteller, bring an \nantagonist to life successfully, you add an intriguing new personality to the game. \nOne that will inspire interest in the current story and attract new players. \nIn recent years, a large number of types of antagonist have been converted \nto the Mind’s Eye Theatre system. Storytellers can choose from a variety of \ndenizens of the World of Darkness and inject into their games whichever ones \nwork best for the story. While it’s hardly exhaustive, the following list shows \ngives advice on how to use the various types of antagonists to their best effect in \nyour live-action chronicles. \n(Keep in mind, though that what type of monster an antagonist is shouldn’t \nbe what carries its importance to the story. A strong antagonist will carry itself \nwhether it’s a Sabbat vampire, a Spectre, a fomori or a mortal. A poorly \nconceived antagonist will not be redeemed as a story ingredient just because it \nis Kuei-jin or a Pentex employee. Determining the type of antagonist to use is \none of the last steps in the creation process, and many other choices must be \nmade long before any statistics get written.) \nVAM \np I R E S  \nCAMARILLA \nA N D  SAB \nB A T  \nOne of the main conflicts that exists in aLaws of the Night chronicle is that \nbetween the Camarilla and the Sabbat sects. The ideologies of these two societies \nare completely incompatible. The Sabbat revels in its inhumanity and believes \nfirmly that the Camarilla is a front for the manipulations of the Antediluvians. \nAlternatively, the Camarilla is convinced that vampires can survive the Final \nNights by hiding behind the Masquerade and holding onto some semblance of \nhumanity. On a more base level, Camarilla and Sabbat vampires oppose each \nother for resources like territory and food. Whoever controls the distribution of \nfood in a given area retains the power, and the sects come together internally more \nto protect their resources than to butt heads over ideological disagreements. \nThat aside, however, vampires are nothing if not masters of self-delusion. \nCenturies of conflict and top-down micro-management have created loneheld \n\n\nstereotypes in each sect about the other. Since the Anarch Revolt centuries ago, \nsurviving Camarilla elders have been telling their new childer that the Sabbat \nare honorless hooligans who crave only elderblood and reprehensible diablerie. \nConversely, the Sabbat have always preached that participants in the Camarilla’s \nsystem feudal slavery are hypocritical pawns of the Antediluvians who would \njust as soon throw a beloved childe to the wolves as defend themselves and their \nchilder. These impressions are set so firmly in the vampiric experience, that they \naffect the way Sabbat and Camarilla antagonists react to members of their rival \nsect. While slavish devotion to type becomes predictable and boring, a Story- \nteller would be remiss to discount these impressions out of hand. \nSabbat vampires believe that they are monsters, but it is important not to \ntreat them as that alone. Sabbat packs are more than tools to incite combat. \nOnly physically oriented characters get involved in senseless fighting, and \nencouraging too much of that kind of conflict alienates the players who prefer \nless overt pursuits. As an antagonist force, the Sabbat is a much more complex \nand organized sect than would seem apparent from the behavior of the average \nWar Party. With proper preparation, Sabbat vampires can creep subtly into a \nCamarilla city, and then overrun it when the time is right. While their methods \nand perspective are different, canny Sabbat elders understand the value of using \nInfluence and manipulation against their mortal herds. They also know how to \nattack the holdings and resources of their enemy in such a way that leaves him \npowerless before an assault. Carefully staged attacks of Sabbat rabble-rousers \ndraw attention away from more subtle and insidious maneuvers. Those players \nthat decide to refrain from combat still have an opportunity to interact with the \nstory by discovering the real motivation for an attack. Those Camarillists who \nhave been treated poorly by the Camarilla hierarchy must also test their faith \nagainst cunning Sabbat recruiters who would rather make allies than enemies. \nCamarilla vampires make equally compelling antagonists as well. They do \nnot bide their time in their lavish havens, sitting in repose and drinking \nbloodewyne. Nor do they sit idly by while Sabbat vampires assault their cities. \nThey fortify their havens, manipulate mortal forces within cities for their \ndefense and even engage in counter-strikes against invading vampires. In \nsecuring resources and expanding their power base, ambitious (or ballsy) \nCamarilla Kindred are not averse to invading Sabbat territory themselves. They \ndo so differently (i.e., far more subtly) than Sabbat invaders do, but the threat \nis still very real. Defeating a Camarilla antagonist takes perception, wit, \ndetermination and ferocious cunning. \nK I N D R E D O E T H E  \nEAST \nA new enemy marches against the children of Caine in the World of \nDarkness. The Kuei-jin from the opposite side of the world have existed for ages \nbehind aveil of secrecy, but now they have begun to make their move on western \nvampiric territory. When compared to Kindred and Sabbat, these Eastern \nvampires have a radically different philosophy on their place in the world. They \nfeed differently, they relate to one another differently, and they exist for a \npurpose that few western vampires can understand. Kuei-jin consider western \nvampires barbaric and self-absorbed heathens without a proper respect for their \nplace in the world. Kin-jin who are aware of the existence of the Kindred of the \n\n\nappropriately, of course, in order to do it justice beyond the stereotype. \nINEBRNALISTS \nInfemalist vampire characters make occasional appearances in live-action \nvampire games as antagonists as well. The topic of Infemalism helps players and \nStorytellers explore issues of absolute good and evil, especially when the story calls \nfor a clear distinction between the two. Vampires of both sects and even the Kuei- \njin all have problems with those who have sold their souls to Hell’s legions, and \nInfemalists themselves have few redeeming qualities. Allied with the legions of \nHell, an Infemalist can truly put a character’s faith and conviction to the test. \nUnfortunately, conflicts against Infemalists reflect the broader issues of spiritual- \nity, humanity, corruption and common evil poorly. When an antagonist starts \nsprouting horns and singing the praises of Satan, it’s pretty easy to see what side \nshe’s on. While opposing evil for the sake of opposing evil does make for a fun \ngame, you can tell a more compelling and intense story by blurring the absolute \nboundaries of morality and forcing characters to choose where they stand. \n9 \nB N E  R I C  VAMP \nI R E  ANTAC~ONI \nSTS \nRegardless of their internecine distinctions, vampires make great antagonists \njust by virtue of being monsters. Boiled down to their essential story elements, \nvampires are undead monsters who drink human blood. They represent humanity’s \nfear of the dark and of the dark places in the human mind itself. While they seem \nhuman and even genteel to casual inspection, an uncontrollable feral half lurks \nbehind the predatory gleam in their eyes. They’ll stop at nothing to make themselves \nsafe and keep themselves fed. This self-serving determination and ruthless instinct \nmakes vampires of all stripes femme and deadly opponents in any chronicle. \nW E  \nREWO LVE s \nIn many werewolf chronicles, Fomori, Black Spiral Dancers, Banes and \nother Wyrm-spawn get lumped under one banner mistakenly. It’s important to \nlook at each type of antagonist a werewolf character might face, in order to use \nit to its best effect in a story. You should also keep in mind that “minions of the \nWyrm” are not the only compelling antagonists out there. \nBLACK SPIRAL \nDANCERS \nAs former members of the Garou Nation, Black Spiral Dancers have an \nintimate understanding of werewolf culture and lore. They know how to invoke \nfear in a steadfast Ahroun, and they can corrupt the purest Silver Fang. Black \nSpirals are not howling beasts that rise up from their tunnels, attack without any \nstrategy, then retreat back into the dark. Black Spiral Dancers are some of the \nmost cunning and dangerous adversaries a werewolf can face. They’re able to \nutilize every resource a Garou can access with the added support of the Wyrm. \nThey fight in packs, they organize, and they are just as skilled in seductive \nspiritual corruption as they are in physical combat. Worse yet, they are arguably \nA N T A ~ O N I S T S  \nTHAT MATTEB \n\n\nmore focused on their Wyrm-given spiritual mission than many uncorrupted \nGarou are in Gaia’s defense. Converting and cleansing a Black Spiral Dancer of \nhis taint is far more difficult than corrupting a Rage-filled Garou who’s sick and \ntired of fighting of what seems a losing battle. \nPENTEX \nAgents and supporters of the Wyrm-ridden Pentex corporation are enemies \nthat many Garou aren’t prepared to deal with. The company exists to spread the \ntaint of the Wyrm to the common man by wrapping it up in attractive packages. \nThe company provides modem luxury and convenience with nary an apparent \ndown-side, and yet every product carries a subtle hint of the Corrupter’s taint. \nBut how does one fight tooth and claw against paper and marketing? Even \nconnected Glass Walkers have difficulty dealing with this corporate monstros- \nity. Eager young recruits flock to Pentex every year in hopes of a good, \nhigh-paying job. Even if werewolves manage to take out a Pentex lackey, scores \nmore are waiting to fill the void of his passing. Even if werewolves put a stop to \none villainous goal on a Pentex agenda, numerous contingencies and other goals \nexist to see that the Wyrm’s work is done. As long as the corporation exists, \nwerewolves’ work to keep the Wyrm in check will never be finished. \nThe most compelling reason to use Pentex antagonists, however, is for the \nmoral dilemma they represent. Pentex and its subsidiaries have touched every \nmodern convenience in the World of Darkness, many of which homid-born \nGarou have relied upon all their lives. From the power that runs the lights at \nnight to the plastic bristles on the tip of a toothbrush, Pentex products make life \neasier. So what if a few trees are cut down or the carbon ratio rises in the \natmosphere? And what does it benefit apackor sept of Garou to remove Pentex’s \ninfluence entirely from an area, only to have the bereft citizens of that area riot \nandrevolt over its absence?Astory involvinga Pentex antagonist forces a troupe \nto examine how far werewolf characters are willing to go in their holy war against \nthe designs of the Wyrm. \nE O M O R I  \nThe much-maligned fomori are generally of small consequence in a live- \naction werewolf chronicle. They’re not strong enough individually to take on a \nCrinos Ahroun, but groups of them can still cause plenty of trouble. Alas, orcs \nin fantasy games get more character development than fomori. Fomori are \ntortured souls that go through unimaginable suffering. They’re desperate to \nsurvive in a world where their own lives have no value. This desperation makes \nthem truly dangerous. Fomori can become versatile antagonists. They can be \nmolded with different powers and abilities to get any job done. It is important \nnot to overlook the usefulness of fomori when creating long-term opponents \nagainst the Garou. \nSPIRITS \nMany different types of spirits exist in the Umbra. A few are helpful, others \nare mischievous, and even more aid the Wyrm’s corruption. Spirits fill specific \nniches in the Umbral ecology, and their story utility is more that of obstacles \nrather than specific antagonists. \n\n\nMost spirits do not set out to wreck characters’ goals on purpose, but ma \nspirits oppose said goals just by virtue of what kind of spirits they are. A tot( \nspirit may disagree with the actions of a sept and try to enact some form \npunishment. A Wyld-spirit may attempt to stop a pack from completing a qu \njust because. A Weaver-spirit might attack interlopers in the Umbra and mz \nthem part of the Pattern Web just to cut down on the unacceptable randomnc \nSpirits also have many different levels of power. Some spirits have exisl \nfor eons, and can be more than a match for a wise elder. Spirits are neitk \nsubservient nor automatically indebted to the Garou. Without the aid a \npowers of the spirit world, the Garou would be lost. Spirits teach rites and Gi: \nand they empower fetishes and talens. They must be propitiated and cham \nin order to convince them to be of assistance. Numerous stories can abound fr( \nthe interaction between werewolves and spirits. A werewolf troupe has dc \nnitely gone awry when it views spirits as weak or easily duped Gnosis batteri \n0 \nT H E  R WEREWOLVES \nEven with all of these forces working against them, werewolves are th \nown worst enemy. For centuries, the tribes have quarreled over territory, ra \nand prestige, and a complex system for resolving conflicts and disputes has gro \nfrom this bickering. When passions run so high among creatures to whc \ndominance and position are of paramount importance, conflict is sure to ari \nCreating rivals from within the ranks of a sept gives Storytellers t \nopportunity to explore social and political issues. The way in which Gal \ncrusade is carried out is just as important to some Garou as the crusade itself, a \ndisagreements of that nature have raged as long as the Garou have. Garou hz \nalways had trouble compromising on issues of how far they are willing to go a \nwhat amount of carnage equals an acceptable casualty figure. While t \ninfighting distracts the Garou from their Gaia-given role on Earth, it makes \nwonderful dramatic tension in a long-running chronicle. \n9 E N  E R I c WE \nR E  w o L E ANTAC~ \no N I ST s \nWerewolves are terrifying opponents in any chronicle. They live in i \nwoods, practice bizarre rites, eat flesh and fly into berserk rages of bloc \ndestruction with little provocation. They’re supernaturally strong and resilie \nbut even still they travel in packs. Fury bubbles inside them, waiting for the fi \nopportunity to explode. As story ingredients, werewolves represent all 1 \nunreasoning violence “out there” in nature that has frightened city-dwell. \nmen and women for so long. Furthermore, they seem bent on destroying so mL \nof what makes human life bearable for what it is. When you don’t understand \nor find yourself on the wrong side of - \nthe holy mission that drives World \nDarkness werewolves, these beasts are horrifying to behold. \nMAC~ES \nTHE \nTECHNOCRACY \nThe future of humankind is intricately linked with reason, technology a \nprogress, and Technocrats work day and night all over the world to see that tl \nlink remains unbroken. They hold that order and science can explain the wo \n~ \n~~ \nANTAC~ONISTS \nTHAT MATTER \n\n\n1 \nand make it safe for humanity in perpetuity. The magic they engage in involves \nconvincing the Masses that this view is correct and demonstrating as much \nthrough technological advances and miracle breakthroughs in all fields of \nscience. Since its inception, the Technocracy has done a superb job of making \nthe people of Earth accept its paradigm. \nDespite its noble goals, however, the Technocracy is responsible for agents \nwho make compelling antagonists. Part of creating a worldwide consensual \nparadigm lies in enforcing that world-view, which calls for the containment and \n“correction” of any element that defies that view. Unfortunately, all supernatural \ncreatures are unacceptable divergences from the norm, and Reality Deviant mages \nare even less welcome. The very existence of the supernatural defies scientific \ncodification, and as such, it must be eliminated from the consensual reality. \nIn fact, anyone who opposes the Technocratic paradigm (or any part of it) \nmust eventually be eliminated from the consensus. The Technocratic vision for \nthe future is one of complete conformity and cooperation, in which everyone is \nsafe and well cared for thanks to the infallible arms of science. \nGeneric Technocrat antagonists include field operatives who prowl in search \nof “unacceptable” levels of deviance from the paradigmatic norm, Control \nscientists who must test their theories and creations on expendable samples of the \npopulation and less-than-human constructs created to supplement the efforts of \nthe other two. For the most part, Technocrat antagonists are more concerned with \nthe bottom line and the greater good than the needs of the individual. In the \nUtopian future, the individual has no significance anyway, right? \nTHE \nTRADITIONS \nThe Traditions have grown their own fair share of monsters. Greed and \npower are strong motivators among Awakened willworkers. Without proper \napprenticeship, proud mages are more likely to abuse their magic regardless of \nthe consequences. Even experienced mages cause trouble when their spells fail \nspectacularly or they simply feel like flexing their mental muscles. \nWhat’s more, many Tradition mages are caught up in the age-old Ascension \nWar. They stand up against Technocratic “tyranny” and assert that humanity \nhas just as much a right to accept and rely on the Supernatural as they do on \nscience. Humans should be allowed to make up their own minds and open \nthemselves up to the infinity of possibility that True Magic offers. As such, \nhowever, these mages are forced to take on people’s long-held reliance on the \nfoundation of scientific thought, and they have to rock the boat constantly. \nCharacters who are comfortable with the status quo don’t usually appreciate \nactions that amount to terrorism for its own sake. \nFurther compounding the problem is the fact that not every magical \nTradition agrees on what would make an ideal world. Each Tradition does magic \nin a different way, some of which are opposed to each other directly. Inter- \nTradition maneuvering for advantage in the Ascension War can generate just \nas much conflict as the war itself. Especially as older mages realize more and more \nclearly that the war to which they’ve given so much of themselves is all but \nhopeless. These embittered spell-weavers have grown desperate and canny, \nwhich makes them all the more dangerous. \n\n\nMORTALS \nAn antagonist doesn’t need supernatural powers to be an awesome foe. In \nmany situations, a human with the right amount of influence, abilities and \nmoney is much better suited to achieve a goal than a supernatural creature. \nHumanity is the force that runs the World of Darkness, and supernatural \ncreatures all exist outside that force. Humans have numbers as well. A large \nindustrial city could hold 40-50 vampires, but a mortal crime lord could have \nhundreds of people working for him alone. While one human being isn’t much \nof a threat to, say, a rampaging werewolf, a large group of smart, well-armed \nhuman beings who have time to plan can put a careless werewolf in a world of \nhurt. Any vampire who wants to stake a claim on a citywide sphere of influence \nmust first deal with the humans who make it up. No supernatural creature can \nafford to discount the power humanity has over the modem world. \nC RBATI o N C ~ U  \nI DE LI N E  s \nWhen creating an antagonist for any genre or any chronicle, it’s important \nto give him areal personality. His personality determines how he does things and \nwhy and what lengths he’s willing to go to. An enemy who’s an enemy for the \nsake of enmity isn’t compelling or memorable - \nhe’s a monster of the week. \nCreating a complete person as an antagonist, one with whom some characters \ncan even sympathize, will establish that antagonist in the players’ memory as a \ncharacter rather than a collection of Traits with which to play Rock-Paper- \nScissors. Using the following guidelines will get you started. \nMOTIVATION \nIN- CHARACTER \nMOTIVATION \nDefining the motivation of an antagonist is the first step in his develop- \nment. The motives can be simple greed, envy, lust or self-preservation, or they \ncan be complex and hidden behind a web of deceit. The antagonist could be the \nunwitting pawn of a greater force, or he may be the greater force himself. \nWhatever the case is, the antagonist has no purpose without a motive. Real \npeople do things for reasons, no matter how bizarre, and the same is doubly true \nfor characters in stories. An antagonist’s purpose in a story is prevent the \ncharacters from reaching their goals, but he does not do so just for the sake of \ndoing so. His reasons for opposing the characters are what make him memorable \nas a character in his own right. \nThe motives also define the antagonist’s targets. It’s important to recognize \nearly in the creation process which opponents an antagonist will face. For \nexample, a vampiric Anarch bent on wreaking havoc in a Camarilla domain \nmay have to worry about the prince’s sheriff and deputies. By listing targets \nahead of time, the antagonist can prepare for future conflicts. The motivations \nof an antagonist help determine its targets as well. A simple lupine-hunting \nGangrel vampire should know better than to rush into a caern’s bawn and throw \ndown with the Warder. An Amalgam of Technocrat agents isn’t going to pursue \nvague suspicions that City Hall is run by vampires when the agents have veryreal \nproof that Reality Deviant mages are blowing up cancer-research laboratories. \n\n\nDeclaring the motivations of an antagonist helps determine its power level \nas well. An enemy who’s too strong for some might be too weak for others in the \nsame game, especially as the number of players gets larger. After creating a set \nof specific motives, think about how much power the antagonist needs to meet \nthose goals. Does a character need Methuselah-level vampiric Disciplines to \nstake his claim on the underworld? More likely, several levels of Influence and \nthe appropriate Abilities would be sufficient. \nDon’t go overboard assigning an antagonist’s power level as per his motiva- \ntion. Make antagonist characters powerful enough to have areasonable eqectation \nof achieving their goals; don’t stack powers upon powers to make the villain’s \nvictory a sure thing. Players deserve a fighting chance to overcome their \nadversary, after all. That’s where the action and drama in any good story comes \nfrom. The contest has to be close and always in question until the very end, \notherwise you won’t be able to maintain the players’ characters’ interest. \nO U T - O f -  C H A R A C T E R  MOTIVATION \nPopular opinion states that Storytellers create antagonists only to torment \nplayers. While that is an amusing benefit of the position, it is not the sole reason \nfor including adversarial characters. Storytellers have their own motivations \noutside of the needs of the story for incorporating antagonists in play. \nEach setting in the World of Darkness works on many levels and has a rich \nbackground. It is impossible for a Storyteller to incorporate everything in a \ngame, no matter how large the LARP is. However, antagonists can draw \nattention to certain aspects of a setting that may have been neglected up to that \npoint. In a Laws of the Wild chronicle, for instance, spirit antagonists focus a \nplayer’s mind on the Umbra as more than just an othenvorldy duck blind or \nshortcut, while Kinfolk antagonists deal with issues of community and fellow- \nship. When a theme has been missing from a game for too long, an antagonist \ncan bring it back to the forefront. Furthermore, an antagonist can emphasize the \ncore concepts within a setting by introducing players to ideas and possibilities \nthey wouldn’t normally consider. \nOther than directing the flow of agame as a whole, antagonists can alter the \ncourse of individual players and characters. By setting up situations that force \ncharacters to make tough decisions, an antagonist can direct the development \nand direction of certain players’ characters. If done well, players won’t even \nrealize that their characters are being set up to follow a particular path. \nInteracting with carefully selected types of antagonists can mold a player’s \nbehavior too. Given the option of butting heads against an antagonist or taking \na less attractive but easier route to success, most players choose the easy way out. \nGuiding players isn’t always a desirable option, but it can become necessary \nwhen they’re about to perform an act that would disrupt the game for everyone \nelse. Some players chafe at any type of restraint or scripting of events, but it goes \non all the time with players being none the wiser. Guidance and scripting are \nout-of-game keys to preventing long-running games from degenerating into \nchaos, and antagonists are excellent in-game tools for doing so. \nAntagonists are also good devices for introducing new, misused or unused \nsystem mechanics into a game. Having an antagonist exploit a game mechanic \npromotes the system in question and make her more difficult to defeat by conven- \n\n\ntional methods. Virtue Tests, for example, are new to many Laws of the Night \ngames. An antagonist who watches a chronicle’s vampire characters, learns their \nhabits and sore spots, then uses that information to play with the vampires’ minds \nin hopes of inciting self-destructive frenzies would present the system to players by \nforcing them to use it. Knowledge and understanding of these rules will then spread \nslowlyuntil they are commonknowledge. Given time, playerswillcome to recognize \nthese unfamiliar systems, freeing Narrators to work on other aspects of the game. \nThe only caveat about using antagonists in game to pursue out-of-game \nmotivations is to do so responsibly. While it is fair to plague a mage character \nwith the persistent attentions of an Amalgam of Technocrats when he’s going \ncrazy shooting fireballs around in public with no regard for safety or secrecy, it’s \nnot fair to create antagonists that hound a particular character just because you \nthink his player’s a jerk. Even if that player is a jerk, it’s still not fair to pick on \nhim. It’s also a bad idea to punish players’ characters with inordinately powerful \nbad guys because you think the players are playing their game the “wrong” way. \nAlways be fair when using in-game antagonists for out-of-game reasons. \nAfter determining the character’s motivation, it’s time to begin laying out \nthe particulars. Antagonists are people too, and they deserve to have as much \nattention lavished on them as any player’s character. What’s tricky about this \nstage of creating an antagonist is that it seems to fall out of sequence. You should \ndetermine the antagonist’s goal (i.e., his motivation) first so you’ll know where \nto put him in the story. Then, you have to go buck and create a background that \nlogically leads up to the character’s present state of mind. \nA detailed background is key to making the character appear realistic. It’s \nthe foundation on which everything about the antagonist is based. The \nbackground shapes the motivations, tactics, attitudes and appearance of the \nantagonist. Without a background to tie all of these sections together, the villain \nwon’t be muchof acharacter at all. Players won’t be able to understand how their \nfoe has developed if he’s just sprung half-formed from your mind into the game. \nIf players can’t understand their opponents, they certainly will not relate to \nthem or be able to interact with them in the meaningful, memorable ways you \nintend. What’s more, the person playing the antagonist will be lost without a \ngood sense of what made the character what he is. \nTACTICS \nWhen you’re plotting out what role an antagonist will play, you also need to \nspecify the ways an antagonist will pursue her goals. An antagonist can be \nconfrontational or subtle. She can take the hands-on approach or work through \nlackeys behind the scenes. The tactics a character uses depends on her motives, \nher targets and especially her abilities. An apostate troll is not going to walk into \na sidhe baron’s court and start randomly blasting away at the courtiers with twin \nColt .45s just so he can send everyone back home to Arcadia. He’d know that that \nis no way to accomplish his goal successfully. Define clearly the risks an antagonist \nwill take in pursuit of her motives. Antagonists don’t work in a vacuum either. \nWho are they willing to deal with and what can they offer potential allies? Does \nthe antagonist need a clear victory, or is partial success acceptable? \n\n\nr \nTry also to figure out what opposition the protagonists in your story will \nprovide the antagonist. Every good villain has contingency plans for the day his \nschemes run awry. Assassins prepare multiple escape routes in the event that one \nis compromised. Lawyers prepare multiple arguments against one another when \nthey battle in court. Technocrat agents study their enemies’ SOPS and arm \nthemselves accordingly. Put yourself in the mind of your antagonist and figure \nout what sort of friction he can reasonably expect from those who are likely to \nstand in his way. Then prepare him to face that friction to the best of his ability. \n(You should also consider out of game what friction your antagonist \ncharacter will face from the players themselves. Will they be resentful of being \nbeaten on occasion by a more powerful foe? Are certain players likely to shoot \nfirst and ask questions later, thus shafting your grand scheme before it begins? \nWill they accuse you of picking on them? Take all these considerations into \naccount when you’re making up an antagonist so you’ll be prepared for the \nplayers’ response. Don’t be afraid to send an antagonist into game just because \nthe players won’t like it - \nthey’re not supposed to like being challenged in \npursuit of their goals- but use your antagonists responsibly so that everyone can \nstill have fun.) \np RES e NTATI o N \nOne of the most overlooked components in creating an antagonist is the \npresentation. The performance of those playing the antagonist is generally given \nlittle thought. However, poor attention to the acting details can be the downfall \nof an otherwise great adversary. When players meet their opponent for the first \ntime, they’re not going to see the hours you spent creating his background and \nmotivations. The players are not going to know about the nefarious plots set \nagainst them. All they’ll have to go on is the first impressions the new character \nmakes. The word “theatre” wasn’t inserted into the title of the game system \naccidentally, after all. With the proper amount of practice, several tools can help \nconvey a convincing Performance. Two of the most important tools that are \noften overlooked are the character’s voice and his mannerisms. \nStart with thevoice. By choosingavoice, the antagonist has akeyfeature that \ndistinguishes it from other characters. Speak in a higher or lower tone. Add a \nforeign accent if it’s appropriate. Other than the sound of the voice, the way one \nspeaks is often noticeable. No one speaks perfect English, French or German for \nthat matter unless he has a reason for paying attention to his verbal grammar. A \nperson that has lived in the inner city will often have adifferent sentence structure \nand vocabulary than a character from suburbia. Think about a character’s \nbackground and consider how his life experiences make his voice distinctive. \nPaying attention to characters’ mannerisms is another facet of acting. Does \nthe character have a limp or other physical discrepancy from the norm? Does she \ntwitch when she gets nervous or pace when she’s forced to wait? Did that limp \nthe maniacal hunter walks with come from his first confrontation with a \nrampaging monster? Is that why he hunts monsters in the first place? Does that \nvampire smoke cigarettes like Andrew Dice Clay because he thinks it’s cool or \nbecause doing so reminds him of the one comedian who’s still able to make him \nlaugh since his violent embrace? Even a character’s most minor quirks come \nfrom somewhere, and making them noticeable makes the character’s themselves \n\n\nmemorable and real. What’s more, some quirk or odd habit might just holc \nkey to defeating the antagonist in the end. \nGUIDELINES \nIf you’re not portraying the antagonist you’ve created, make sure to sit d \nwith the player or Narrator taking on the role and sketch out some guide11 \nGuidelines should be simple, one-sentence explanations on how to rea( \ncommon situations, and these explanations should all be grounded in \ncharacter’s history and motivation. While there’s really no wrong way 1 \nplayer to play a protagonist character, an unprepared player can defin \nportray an antagonist character incorrectly. If you have specific out-of-g \nplans for what you want an antagonist to accomplish, make sure you spell t \nout to the person portraying the character for you. While the idea of maintai \nstrict control of a LARP is patently ludicrous, you should certainly take \nproper steps to keep it moving in the right general direction. \nS TATI STI c s \nOnce you’ve gone to all the preceding trouble, declaring the statistics fo \nantagonist should now be relatively easy. All of the previous steps in creation1 \nbuilt up to this point. The general power level, techniques, experiences \nmotivations of the character outline the stats. All that is left is to have t \nexplicitly written down on a character sheet. As far as this aspect of antagc \ncreationgoes, you can check inanyhws of... book‘s Character Creationcha \nWith so many steps in the creation process, it may seem if buildin \nantagonist takes a lot of work. Antagonists aren’t characters that can be wri \nin a couple minutes. They’re a precious resource requiring a large investme \ntime and ingenuity. An antagonist is a long-term character that can hope \nappear in several stories or many game sessions within a single story. Y \npreparation and effort, some truly insidious fiends can be concocted, as \nlasting characters that will carve a niche in their troupe and electrify a g2 \n~~ \nA N T A ~ O N I S T S  \nTHAT \nMATTEB \n\n\nM I N D  \nLo \nNew Orleans Nightfall; \nMark Leberecht, FrostC -,.,.., \n(504) 943-9814 \nM ABY LAN D \nRay of Blood; Baltimore, MD \nEd Adelsbergermailto:edla@erols.com , edla@erols.com \n1 \ni 1/ \n1 \n1 \n:t \n1 \n.I \nkitae Neternus; Hyattsville, MU \nMASSACHUSETTS \nHouse of the Crescent Moon; Boston, MA \ngiovanni@c ybercom.net \nSevered Sun; Boston, MA \nSean Donnelly \n(617) 576-1097 \n(617) 656-2891 \nM I S S O U R I  \nCoterie of the Crimson Night; St. Louis, MO \nJamie Schneider, jaclon@juno.com \nImpiorum Pecatta (“Sins of the Damned”); Warrensburg, MO \nStoryteller: Jason Hibdon, eugee@cyberjunkie.com \nhttp://www.cyberjunkie.com/eugee \n(314) 837-3640 \nN E B R A S K A  \nEbon Seraph; Omaha, NE \ndavosburgh@aol.com \nNEVADA \nBlood Moon Social Club; Las Vegas, NV \nhttp://www. bloodmoonsocialclub.com \n(702) 877-1813 \n60 \n\n\n2 N T  H O B I Z O N :  U P C O M l N q  L A R P  EVENTS \nN o a T H  C A R O L I N A  \nLibertas Aetema; Charlotte, NC \nTim Harris, harrist@cs.winthrop.edu \nO H I O  \nBlood Masks: Cincinnatus By Night; Cincinnati, OH \nBrian-Joseph Baker, Elomae@aol.com \n513-777-7778 \nDayton: Valley of the Shadow; Dayton, OH \nLee Highfield, schlgrmstr@aol.com \nA Stake in the Heartland 11; Northeast OH \nRyan S.

The other character \nusually understands right away, and they move along. A variant of the \ncrossover explanation scene involves the emissary (qv) explaining to \nmembers of his own people the alien ways of the people to whom he is an \nemissary. An even stranger twist on this scene is that of the occult scholar \nwho can explain the alien ways of any [World of Darkness] culture because \nhe’s “read about them before.” \nThe Squad: \nThis phenomenon has many names - \nthe whoop squad, the beat squad, \nthe gack squad, the hit squad -but \nit has one real meaning. What happens \nwhen one uses a squad in LARPing is that one character has a beef with \nanother character, so he rallies a group of like-minded thugs to his cause. \nHaving so rallied, the beefer then leads his thugs to wherever the beefee i s  \n(preferably under the power of Cloak the Gathering, or through a convenient \nUmbral shortcut), and he [and they] proceed to whip the ever-loving crap out \nof the beefee. The resulting nightmarish mass-combat scene takes about two \nhours to play out (depending on who jumps in on whose side), but the in-game \ntime the scene takes is about 15-45 seconds. \nThe Ratio: \nSupernatural creatures vastly outnumber the mundane denizens of the \nWorld of Darkness. Especially in small towns and college campuses. Fortunately, \nthough, these creatures maintain their intricate web of secrecy that veils them \nfrom prying eyes. If there are any. \nThe Umbra: \nI’m not sure why, but the Umbra is the most important aspect of the world \nas we know it, no matter what kind of MET LARP is going on. It is a protected, \nimpregnable haven. It’s a mystical gym locker for important things. It’s a great \nback door into any place on Earth. It cuts travel time radically. It’s the spy’s \nultimate hidey hole. It’s even full of biddable, naive spirits who will pretty much \ndo what you ask as long as you give them a unit of supernatural power. \nThe only bad thing about the Umbra is that unknowable, destructive \nmonstrosities seem to live there. And those monstrosities want nothing more \nthan to cross over to the physical world and wreak havoc. \nVillains: \nThe choice of villains that appear in LARPs say an awful lot about folks who \nplay LARPs as well. LARP bogeymen include: \nSetites. Tremere. Sabbat. Spectres. “Wyrm creatures.” Black Spiral \nDancers (whom many right-minded Gangrel have hunted in the past). \nFomori. Umbral monstrosities. Demons. Setites. Men in Black. Iteration X \ncyborgs. The Inquisition (unless the characters are supernatural creatures \nwho work for the Inquisition in their search for Golconda/ Transcendence/ \nAscension and have slipped in under the radar). Or any weird mixture of \nany/all of the preceding. \nThe use of these villains often has no relation to the LARP venue in which \nthey appear, oddly enough. Vampires often fight - \nand call them - \nBSDs. All \nGarou (not just the Silent Striders) are particularly offended by Setites. There’s \n\n\nLESSONS \nAnd what have I learned from these observations? Actually, I’ve learned \nquite a lot. (No, I didn’t just write all that in order to verbally lambaste the loyal \nreaders who’ve been helping pay my salary these last two years.) \nThe first is to never be too critical, especially in this “industry.” I first came \nat the Journal with the perspective that White Wolf is right, and other people \nare wrong. If somebody played the game differently than the way we recom- \nmended in a book, that person was wrong. If somebody ran a game that may as \nwell have been a dungeon-crawl of undead superheroes with fangs, that person \nwas wrong too. Basically, anyone who deviated in their gameplay from the \n“canonical” decrees of the home office (all in the name of villainous and \nilliterate “fun”) was a loser and a goob who deserved to be ostracized from the \nhut m o d  that is the gaming community. \nFortunately, I finally came around to realize that that attitude was the worst \nsort of undeserved snobbery. The people who are playing with our materials thus \nare still the people who are buying those materials. To say that they’re wrong \nimplies that they’re dumb. And it doesn’t take a team of rocket-scientist \nphilosopher kings to figure out that calling your customers dumb is a bad idea. \nIf they (or you, or I frankly) diverge from the printed text in a way that makes \na White Wolf game more fun, who are we behind the desks at this office to say \nthat that’s wrong?That’s the worst kind of corporate jack-assery, and it’s no basis \nfor developing a quarterly magazine. \nWithout that built-in condescension working against me, it’s easier to see \nthe good that’s hiding behind the otherwise judgmental observations that \nopened this essay. It’s easy to see that people approach LARPs with basically \ngood intentions and reasonably good ideas. \nThe biggest thing you notice is that LARPers want, expect and even \ndemand a unified World of Darkness setting. You can tell it from the crossover \nlunacy and the scenes of explanation and the choices of villains. The people \nwho buy our products, we can’t deny, don’t usually read one game line and one \ngame line only. They see how the varied pieces fit together from each game \nline, regardless of that line’s cloistered perspective, and they expect their \ncharacters to live in an inclusive setting. Granted, it’s difficult to wrap one’s \nmind around a world in which clockwork brass robot constructs shared land \nwith blood-sucking undead lords of the night, but that sort of cross-brand \ninconsistency is more the exception to the rule. People have been after us for \nyears to admit that the World of Darkness is a singular supernatural melting \npot, and they’ve got a point. \nThe other big revelation I’ve made is that LARPers generally have a \nstrong desire to be heroes and do what’s right. While they’re often cartoonish \ncaricatures rather than characters in their own right, LARP villains are \nalmost universally bad. They’re drug-dealers or gun-runners or corrupt \nbureaucrats or Hell-bound magicians or devil-spawn themselves, and they \nmust be destroyed for the good of the community, or even the entire world. \nCommon beat-squad rallying causes are those of freedom and justice; \nnothing gets a group of biddable head-thumpers together like the promise of \na relief from tyranny. While many methods characters in LARPs engage in \n\n\nare extreme (such as short-range ambushes or sniper assaults), the core of \nmotivation is usually a noble one. \nPlus, LARPers are some of most dedicated adherents to the concept of \nmulti-cultural diversity you could hope to find. You see evidence of it in every \nGangrel Wyrm Foe and Tzimisce antitribu and Kinfolk ghoul vassal to the local \nsidhe lord. It makes sense to LARP players that a reasonable explanation of \noneself and a trustworthy practice of what you preach will gain one the trust \nand eventual respect of any culture - \nno matter how opposed to your own it \nmay be originally. While that hope may not prove true reliably in our real- \nworld experience, LARP players believe in it because that’s the way they feel. \nThat’s a special kind of idealism that it does a heart good to see. It helps me \nremember why 1 got hooked up with the gaming crowd in the first place \nwaaaaay back when. \nO T H E R  LESSONS \nThese last several lessons are the ones I’ve learned while doing this \njob. Consider them a peek behind the curtain, and keep them in mind if \nyou should ever decide to seek glorious and gainful employment in gaming \ndesign and publication. \nGaming is not an industry. No, despite the notoriety and acclaim you can \ngain by becoming a public figure in gaming, gaming will always be a niche of a \ngreater industry. As such, the concomitant pay one makes reflects that status. \nFreelance game writers kap at the opportunity to miss their deadlines. If our \naccounting department allowed me to supplement my paycheck with the \npenalty fees that are written into every White Wolf freelance contract for \nturning in work late or incomplete, I’d be sitting on a golden La-2-Boy watching \na 70-inch projection screen television and lighting my duty-free Cuban cigars \nwith rolled-up giant panda pelts while bellowing for Elian Gonzales and the \n“Whazzup! ?” guys to make me a sammich. \nThe writer-developer-editor triangle is not a self-supporting mechanism. It \nis, instead an autocannibalistic mess that somehow manages to work despite \nits own best efforts. Each point in the triangle is convinced of its own \nintellectual and creative superiority, as well as the relative incompetence of \nthe others. Unless the others happen to be right and able to prove it. Having \nbeen a part of each vertex of this triangle, I can state for a fact that this is \nunequivocally the case. \nIt is hard to be topical and clever in a quarterly publication that gets to stores \napproximately six months after it kaves your hands. It’s also pretty hard to coordinate \na coherent Event Horizon calendar on that schedule, as I’m sure you’ve noticed. \nA young editor with only three months of experience who’s thrust into the \nposition ofdeweloping a quarterly magazine should not “contribute” his own fiction to \nthat magazine. Hindsight is a painful teacher. I apologize for “A Position of \nStrength” and “Any Mother’s Child.” No, really. \nYou have to settle sometimes. No writer or artist or typesetter or editor \n(or developer) lives up to your ideals all the time. Fortunately, that’s okay, \nbecause this isn’t exactly brain surgery or UN translating. Usually when you \n“settle” for a finished product, it’s every bit as good as your ideal despite how \ndifferent the two are. \n\n\nAll things being equal, you can’t really ask for a better job than doing what \nyou love for enough money to live on. Even without the duty-free Cuban cigars \nand the sammiches. \nSPECIAL \nTHANKS \nI can’t end this without giving credit (and my heartfelt gratitude) where it’s \nRichard Dansky \nJess Heinig \nCynthia Summers \nPeter Woodworth \nThe Mind’s Eye Theatre Journal wouldn’t be what it is without all the \nwork you four have put into it from the start. Others have come and gone to \nhelp keep the Journal aloft, but it wouldn’t have gotten off the ground without \nyou. It’s been an honor and a pleasure, and the fact that the Journal is going \naway despite your fine efforts thus far royally stinks. \nAnd lest I forget, let me thank you folks who have been buying and reading \nthe Journal all this time. You make the effort and the headache and the stress \nand the craziness worth it when all is said and done. I’m sorry it has to end, but \nI’m glad for the time we’ve had. \ndue. My special thanks go out to these folks: \n"
