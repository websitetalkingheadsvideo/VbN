      "text": "WELCOME! \nHello again, everybody, and welcome to the sixth issue of theMET \nJournal! For those of you who are new to the publication, let me take a \nsecond to acquaint you with just what you’ve got here. (For those of you \nwho already know, you may skip ahead to The Current Thinking.) \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gaps \nin your White Wolf LARP environment. We offer rules for new charac- \nter types, original story lines to work into your chronicles, guides for \nkeeping your games under control and running smoothly and rules \nupdates you won’t find in any other Mind’s Eye release. Plus, you’ll find \nanswers to the questions that have plagued you, original World of \nDarkness fiction and columns from people who’ve been LARPing or \nworking here at White Wolf (or both) for years. \nIn this issue, we finish taking a look at the wraithly environment of the \nGreat War era, including rulesfor Maelstromeffects and making Momvights \nplayable characters. You’ll also find advice from the Mind’s Eye Theatre \nline developer and rules for creating Yulan-]in and Dhamphyr characters \nfor your Laws of the East chronicle. And that’s just a sample of what’s in \nstore for you here. We’ll also take a look at what you’ve missed in previous \nissues (if you’re joining us late) and what to expect in the future ofMind’s \nEye Theatre and White Wolf in general. \nIn future issues of the Journal, we’ll present some more of the \nmaterial that had to be left out of Laws of the East, tips on acting and \nsome expanded information on the hideous fomori. \nAnd you can help make the Journal even better. Send us letters on \nyour opinions about the state of live-action roleplaying today. Send us \nquestions about the features and rules you see here, as well as notes about \nthe broken rules you come across in different MET publications.

      "text": "THF CURRFNT T H I N K I N 9  \nIt hasn’t been long since the revised edition of Laws of \nthe Night has hit the shelves, and already the deluge has \nbegun! So, in the interests of world peace (or at least, peace \nin your game), here are the answers to some questions that \nhave started cropping up. \nQ: I don’t like the new Virtue system, where vampires can be sent to \nfrenzy just by lighting a cigarette. What can I do about this? \nA: First, remember that any stimulus under the vampire’s control doesn’t \ncause a Virtue Test. Therefore, you needn’t make a Courage test just to light your \nown cigarette or throw a Flame Bolt. \nSecond, the circumstances for Virtue Tests are determined by the Narrator \nor Storyteller. A player can call for his character to make a Virtue Test if he thinks \nthat his character would be affected by a situation (testing for frenzy due to an \ninsult, for example), which is recommended as good roleplaying. It’s up to \nNarrators to keep players honest if some big-time scene breaks out, such as pillars \nof flame landing in your character’s yard. Of course, chances are good that there’s \nalready a Narrator on hand if there are pillars of flame landing in your yard.. . . \nLast, if you think that it’s just too easy for vampires to lose control, and your \ngame has degenerated into a mass of screaming, frenzied Cainites, you can strip \nout the stimuli for one- and two-Trait Self-Control/ Instinct and Courage Virtue \nTests. Therefore, characters will only frenzy when something really egregious \ncomes up. This mechanic does numb the “personal horror” angle of Vampire a \nbit, so be careful with it. Under such a system, vampires will be likely to frenzy \nor enter Rotschrek only when they face direct sunlight, starvation and the sight \nof blood, or actual fire damage. It’s important to make sure that the Morality \nscales stay intact just to keep people honest to their Humanity/ Path rating. \nQ I noticed that characters never suffer a loss of Virtue Traie under the system \npresented. What should I do if a player is buying up his hcience/- \nSelf- \ncontrdl Instiwt and Courage to maximum levels, since they never drop? \nA: At his or her discretion, the Storyteller may always choose to strip a \ncharacter of a Virtue Trait for particularly severe events. A vampire who suffers \ntoo many shattering defeats of his Courage may lose a Courage Trait perma- \nnently. This loss is part and parcel of the degeneration into inhumanity and the \nfight with the Beast. However, losing Virtue Traits is not acommon event, since \nit can easily wreck characters rapidly if it occurs too often. At the very least, a \nplayer should have to lose a Virtue Test, risk a retest and lose that as well before \nhaving the possibility of losing a permanent Virtue Trait. \nIf you do decide to strip a character’s Virtue Trait, then you probably shouldn’t \ninflict the temporary Derangement, just to keep the player from getting t o d y  \nhammered. Note that if a character is stripped down to having no Virtue Traits in \na given Virtue, then the player can’t even enter Virtue Challenges of that type. He \nsuffers the appropriate effects automatically. In such a case, the Derangement \nassigned should probably be permanent (although it could be overcome normally). \n"

      "text": "When using the compressed scale, all Blood and Willpower Traits are halved \nfrom the normal scale. Thus, a thirteenth-generation vampire, who would \nnormally have 10 Blood Traits and two Willpower Traits, instead has five Blood \nTraits and one Willpower Trait. \nA couple of things to keep in mind with the compressed scale: First, all \nBlood Trait expenditures are also halved, rounded up. Thus, using the Feral \nChws Discipline, which normally costs one Blood Trait, still costs a single Blood \nTrait. Healing an aggravated wound costs two Blood Traits (half of three is one \nand a half, rounded up to two). Healing a normal wound still costs one Blood \nTrait. Waking up in the evening costs one Blood Trait. You get the idea. \nThe limits on expended Blood Traits are also halved in the compressed \nscale. Therefore, only an eighth or better generation vampire can spend more \nthan one Blood Trait in a turn. \nIf you use the compressed Blood/ Willpower scale, you should probably also \nuse a compressed Health scale. Under that system, all vampires have one level \neach of Healthy, Bruised, Wounded and Incapacitated, after which they’re in \ntorpor or they hit Final Death. Fortitude and Potence work normally, but all \nweapons only cause half damage, rounded up, in such a system. Therefore, most \nattacks do only a single level of damage. \nQ: How many Blood Traits do mortals have? \nA: A mortal has 10 Blood Traits under the normal blood system. Each one \nremoved causes a health level of lethal damage to the mortal (and yes, this injury \nwill kill a mortal before the individual completely runs out of blood). If you use \nthe compressed scale, then mortals have five Blood Traits, but each one lost still \ncauses one level of lethal damage. Remember that mortals take additional \ndamage when Giovanni vampires feed from them. \nGhouls have normal Blood Traits like humans, although they replace one of \ntheir human Blood Traits with a Trait of ghoul blood in order to become ghouls \nin the first place. This Trait of blood can power Disciplines and the like, although \nits use causes injury to the ghoul just as if the blood had been lost through other \nmeans. Ghouls can still be overfed; see Liber des Goules for ideas on giving aghoul \nextra blood to convert his human Blood Traits into ghoulish Blood Traits. \nQ: What are the relative strengths/ speeds/ endurance levels of the \nvarious levels of Celerity, Fortitude and Potence? \nA: Try this for comparison: \nPower level Celerity \nFortitude \nPotence \nBasic \nOutrun a bike Take a punch \nThrow a large television \nIntermediate I\nAdvanced \nOutrun a car Take a blowtorch Throw a small car \nOutrun a horse Take a baseball bat Throw a refrigerator \nQ: I’m having trouble with the Vanish from Mind’s Eye power of \nObfuscate. It’s cumbersome to test against everyone every time I want to say \na simple sentence! \nA: You always risk detection if you interact with your surroundings while \nObfuscated. If you need a simpler system, you can simply expend a Mental Trait \neach time you speak a full sentence while Obfuscated, as long as you have Vanish \n"

      "text": "from Mind’s Eye or better. However, this system is up to the approval of your \nStoryteller, and it applies to everyone - \nincluding those pesky enemies you’ve \nbeen trying to catch. \nQ: The new limits on Thuumaturgy, particularly the Path of Bloal, seem \npretty restrictive. What can I do to make sure that Thaumuturgy still has utility? \nA: Thaumaturgy is a powerful Discipline, but its strength lies in its flexibiliry. \nIf you are really having aproblem with the fact that P o w  ofBlood is now limited \nso that a 13th generation vampire can’t pretend to be fifth, that Theft ofvitae can \nno longer rip away enough blood to keep a vampire from using Celerity or that \nCauldron of Blood can no longer kill someone in a single blow, you can always \nincrease or waive the limits on expenditures for Thaumaturgy. Don’t do so without \na careful look at the consequences across the game, though. Thaumaturgy should \nnot create a “one-shot kill” any more than any other power. Remember, too, that \nThaumaturgy ’s success in tabletop relies on the rolls of the player. AVampire: The \nMasquerade player cannot expect to automatically tear away 10 blood points from \nan individual, and the live-action version is no different. At most, we recommend \nan upper limit of five Traits on the various limited expenditures, unless you want \nthe Tremere to get really gross. (Cauldron of Blood in particular, with its aggravated \ndamage, can be extremely dangerous if misused.) \nQ: The example of breaking Obfuscate with Auspex is confusing. The \nexample in theObfuscate Discipline says a one-for-one Trait bonus to the \nhigher Discipline, but the description only gives two Traits for a character \nusing Vanish from Mind’s Eye against Heightened Senses, which would be a \ndifference of three levels. How should this work? \nA: You get a two-Trait bonus for eachpower class that exceeds your opponent’s. \nThat is, if you have the Intermediate power and your opponent has the Basic power, \nyou get two extra Traits against him. If you have the Advanced power and your \nopponent has the Basic power, you get four extra Traits. These Traits cannot be used \nfor bidding, but they can be used for resolving ties and for calculating overbids. \nQ: Now that Thuumaturgy and Necromunq rituals cost Experience \nTraits, what should I do with characters who already have lots of rituals? \nA: Don’t worry about it. You can always adjudicate that a character can \nlearn a ritual through hard effort and study with appropriate Influence. If you \nwant to be strict, you can charge such players a small fraction of their earned \nexperience (say, one point each month) until they’re “paid up.)’ If they complain \nabout it, point out that you’re not taking away all of their experience, and that \nthey have already had all of these rituals for free for some time. \nQ: The Thanatosis power of Withering makes it impossible to use \nCelerity, Fortitude and Potence if it strikes the head. Shouldn’t it affect \nMental Disciplines and not Physical ones? \nA: Whoops! That sentence should read “Doing so kills mortals instantly \nand causes vampires to suffer the Negative Traits Oblivious and Witless in \naddition to rendering them unable to use any Disciplines except Celerity, \nFortitude and Potence.” Note that a vampire with a withered head can still use \nother non-Discipline powers such as healing or boosting Physical Traits. \nQ: The Summun power is causing me problems. People are summoning \ntheir enemies from several miles away, and forcing them to travel during the \nday, killing them! What should I do? \n"

      "text": "A: The Summon power dissipates at dawn at the victim’s location. Also, the \npower cannot place someone in a dangerous situation. A summoned individual will \ntake steps to avoid danger and mitigate risk, and the summoning is broken if there \nis no way to reach the summoner except through dangerous or fatal territory (such \nas walking through flame or traveling through gang territory alone and unarmed). \nQ: The suggested Ability retests don’t make sense for some of the \nDisciplines. Why would I use Leadership instead of Intimidation, for \ninstance, with Dread Gaze? \nA: At your Storyteller’s option, you can specify different Abilities for each \nDiscipline, but doing so gets nightmarishly complex and requires each player to \nremember exactly what Ability is used for a retest with each level of every \nDiscipline. If you do so, we recommend that you make up cards for the \nDisciplines, so that the players can remember what Ability is appropriate. In any \ncase, no Discipline should get aretest frommore than one Ability. You shouldn’t \nbe able to use Leadership or Intimidation with Dread Gaze, for instance. Use one \nor the other for all uses of the power. \nQ: Where are the Sabbat Paths of Enlightenment? Kiasyd? Children of \nOsiris? Ahrimanes? \nA: Later book. We only had so many pages. \nQ: The Disciplines section mentions “eight common Disciplines,” but \nonly lists seven. Which one is missing? \nQ: How do caitiff work in the new version? \nA: A caitiff picks three Disciplines as primary Disciplines. Unless the \nStoryteller says otherwise, these should come from the “common eight.” The \ncaitiff advances in these at “clan costs.” Caitiff cannot begin play with Status, \nand they generally are of very weak Generation. More information on caitiff will \nbe forthcoming in a later book. \nQ: How do I use other Mind’s Eye Theatre games with the new rules? \nA: If you use the compressed scales, your games should work just fine. Under \nsuch a system, everybody keeps the same health levels, and the relative balance \nof power is maintained. \nShould you use the full Blood/ Willpower/ Health scales, you’ll need to \naccommodate with the other games. Werewolves, changelings and mortals should \nuse the health level scales listed in the revised edition rules. (Wraiths always had \ntheir own Corpus scale, and it doesn’t change.) Their Trait ratings can stay the \nsame; a vampire with five Blood Traits is still in trouble when running into a \nwerewolf with four Rage Traits. Under this system, a werewolf heals one lethal or \nbashing health level of damage every h ~ r n  \nthat he’s not in a challenge. \nUse your best judgment when arbitrating the effects of powers. Razor Claws, \nfor instance, probably stays the same, but some of the higher-level Gifts might \nautomatically do two levels of damage in the full-scale system. \nQ: On page 11 1, time in involuntary torpor is measured in game sessions \nbased on Morality. On page 199, there’s a chart with concrete (generally \nlonger) times. Which is it? \nA: Use the chart on page 11 1 so that you can scale torpor times according \nto your own game’s schedule. \nT H E  \nCURRENT \nTHINKING \n"

      "text": "Q: Willpower must be spent to attempt a challenge if you don’t have the \nappropriate Ability. Does this include challenges like Brawl and Melee? \nA: No; you only spend Willpower to attempt a challenge without the \nAbility if the Ability would normally be required for the action. You can always \nfire a gun, swing a sword or attempt a similar action. You can’t necessarily read \nSanskrit without the right training. \nQ: Under the Awareness Ability, it mentions usingretests for the Ability \nwith the Occult Ability. Why would someone retest an Ability with a \ndifferent Ability? \nA: This is probably a little unclear. When you use the Awareness Ability, \nyou’re sensitive to unusual supernatural things going on in your vicinity. However, \nyou may not actually know what they are without the Occult Ability. Thus, your \nAwareness may tell you that something magical just happened, but you’d need \nOccult Ability to recognize it as, say, Thaumaturgy if you didn’t actually see exactly \nwhat happened or weren’t familiar with the effect in question. \nQ: The Flaw Intolerance shows up under the example of character \ncreation on p. 129. Where is it? \nA: Technically, this Flaw no longer exists. However, the Storyteller may \nalways adjudicate the use of additional Merits and Flaws. \n"

The most enduring one above and beyond, “Cripes, why did they give you \nthe job? Were there no trained lemurs available?” that is. \nNo, the one thing everyone wanted to know about my work on MET was, oddly \nenough, the whereabouts of the one book I never did tackle, a book that’s absence mandated \nthat MET would never be a letter-perfect translation of the tabletop World of Darkness. \nIn the chat rooms, on the newsgroups and forums, at conventions and in \ndisturbingly phrased phone messages left on my intermittently checked voice mail, the \nquestion was always the same: Where’s MET Magez? \nAfter all, it would seem like an obvious next book at any given juncture. All the other \nWorld of Darkness games had gotten their translations, even that icky Wraith thin$. \nWhy not Mage, which was more popular, and quite likely to sell rather well as a result? \nWhy was that rat bastard Dansky so intent on never, ever doing live-action Mage? \nWell, for the first time, you’re going to get the real, honest-to-Murgatroyd answer, \nright here in these pages. At last, the terrible secret that swallowed so many submissions \nis about to be revealed. The time for secrecy and discretion is over. You can learn the \ntruth now. You’re ready. \nThe truth is, soylent green is made of people. Oh, hang on, that’s not it. Sorry about that. \nThe real reason I never developed Laws of Magic (or Laws of Magick or Ascension \nor Laws of My God I Hope For Once in Their Bloody Lives Our Artists Don’t Feel \nCompelled to Turn in Shots of Bare Breasts for a Book with a Purple Cover, Because \nI Really Don’t Want to f i v e  to Try to Explain this One to the 700 Club and My \nMother) was always a very simple one. And it wasn’t one that anyone ever guessed. \nOh, sure, there were theories. There were guesses. There were cries of outrage4 \nabout how all of those umpty-gazillion live-action Mage players were being cruelly \nignored out of sheer spite5. In truth, I spent a not-so-brief period collecting various \nconspiracy and other theories as to why the book never got made. I heard that then- \nMage developer Phil Brucato refused to allow it. I heard that Phil wanted to develop \nit and that I wouldn’t let him. I heard that people at White Wolf knew that various folks \nof the neo-pagan persuasion would curse us if the book ever saw print and that we were \ndetermined to save our own skins by killing the book. I heard that various branches of \nthe Religious Right were getting ready to march on the White Wolf offices like extras \n"

      "text": "from Young Frankenstein, waving their torches and demanding that the book be burned. \nI even heard from one sadly deluded chap who dug up a fossilized April Fools’ Day post \nwherein I promised live-action tantric sex rules for Mage, complete with a bound \nParadox spirit and one pair of edible undies6. The poor guy thought that I was A) serious \nand B) about to run afoul of various federal statutes by doing so. \nIn short, I heard every possible reason for my refusal to produce Laws of the Purple \nCover on demand short of someone insisting that the Secret Masters had forbidden me \nto do so. After all, with all of those compelling reasons (or “REA$ON$7” as some not- \nterribly-clever folks felt the need to phrase it) to do the book, there had to be some \nhorrible secret behind the fact that it wasn’t seeing print. \nNow, to their eternal credit, some folks out there decided to put their money where \ntheir collective mouth (and good Lord, isn’t that an image out of Bosch?) was, and submit \nproposals for rules sets for MET Mage. Sending in a submission to a publisher is a work of \nutmost bravery, and I have respect for anyone who dares to attempt it. After all, it’s one thing \nto have your friends tell you how great your ideas are or your game is, but it’s quite another \nto put it out there under the cold, critical eye of someone who doesn’t know you from Adam \n(and who has absolutely no compunctions about telling you that the 400-page submission \nyou’ve spent two years cobbling together is Not Good Enough). It’s hard, putting your work \nout where you can’t be there to shepherd it, to smooth over the rough spots and explain the \nplaces where you might have been unclear. Once you put the manuscript in the envelope, \nit’s out of your hands. It stands or falls on its own merits, and it goes before a judge as \nlegendarily harsh as Minos or Rhadamanthus - \nthe developer. It takes a lot of courage to \nsubmit your work to an impartial judging from someone who is bound to be -because of \ntime constraints, if nothing else - \nswift, merciless and impartial. Furthermore, by \nsubmitting your work, you’re implicitly accepting the responsibility of writing the book \nshould your proposal be accepted, and as any professional writer can tell you, writing to \ndeadline is hard, intense labo?. So those people who sent in proposals for their particular \nversions of MET Mage did and still do have my respect for making that attempt. \nAnd so, the submissions came rolling in. Some were done in the format I’d \nrequested a hundred times-cover \nletter, outline, writing sample, SASE-while \nsome \nwere complete manuscripts the size of the latest Clive Barker literary Dagwood. Some \nwere incredibly professional, while others lacked basics like SASEs and cover letters or \nhadn’t been proofread. Some were very good, some, well, weren’t. A couple approached \nexcellence. But every single one got rejected, put in the pile and turned over to my \nsuccessors for their perusal when the time came to hand off the reins. \nWhy? \nThe answer to this long-running conundrum is, unfortunately, a blunt one. In so \nmany words, none of them worked, and after certain incidents early in my tenure as MET \ndeveloper, I swore that I was never going to let a book that didn’t work - \nthat would \ndestroy moregames than itwouldcreate-out withmynameonit9.Andsoas eachMET \nMage submission came in, I dutifully unwrapped it, read it and then broke it. \nBroke the rules, that is. Found ways in which the particular rules set could be contorted \nuntil it cried for its mama, and game-play went out the window. Then the submission would \nget put on the ferry to the Island of Misfit Toys, or more accurately, on top of the towering, \nteetering stack of unsuccessful Mage MET proposals, and wait for the next one to come along. \nUnfortunately, most of the submissions came in sharing one fatal flaw - \nthe \nassumption that since this particular batch of rules worked with a local group, it would \nwork, period. Sadly, that was never the case. \n"

      "text": "The three main pitfalls of doing MET Mage were always playability, faithfulness and \nbalance. The first was exemplified by the dreaded “I Brutally assault you/ I Wisely teleport \nto Saturn” dilemma. To do Mage properly was to invite all sorts of incidents, transforma- \ntions, teleportations and so on that the imagination was better suited to handle than the \nlive-action arenalo. If a proposal turned Mage loose in all of its wild, rambunctious glory, \nall Hell would no doubt break loose five minutes into the first session as characters turned \nother characters into lawn furniture, jaunted around the various levels of reality and \notherwise made the Storyteller’s life something out of Dante’s best book. \nFurthermore, there was always the matter of Paradox. Assigning it correctly would \ncall for far too many Narrators - \na one-to-one player/ staff ratio would have been \noptimal - \nlest players get away with vulgar murder (and magic) when no one was \nlooking. On the flip side, some proposals did away with Paradox entirely as being too \nmuch trouble. These rules systems promised utter chaos. They also made rude gestures \nin the general direction of faithfulness, the second major hurdle any proposal would \nhave to get across. After all, Mage without Paradox isn’t Mage. It’s a mid-period \nAvengers comic, with the pillars of heaven shaking on a regular basis because there isn’t \nanything in place to keep them from doing so. \nOther proposals abandoned Spheres in favor of making an entirely rote-based \nsystem, which was, in my opinion, contrary to the spirit of the game. After all, MET \nhas always been about translating existing material, not creating new things. Hacking \nmajor bits of the game system out would have, I felt, been rather contrary to that \nmission. \nFinally, the question of balance always came up. Would some characters be too \npowerful or not powerful enough? Would everyone get a fair shake from the get-go? \nMoreover, would a live-action version of Mage play well with others? Would a single \nMage character be able to walk into a Masquerade game and turn all of the elders into \npapasan chairs without working up a sweat, and was that fair to the Vampire players”? \nFor all of the insistence on pure venues here, there and everywhere, we all know that \ncrossovers happen. Ten minutes after Laws of Magick hit the stands, someone, \nsomewhere would stroll into an Elysium with a Euthanatos character and try to reduce \neveryone to little piles of dust just ’cause he could. That sort of thing tends to distress \nplayers, and I always felt that distressing players unduly was a bad ideal2. \nThe real problem, however, ran a bit deeper. It ties into the same root reason that \nJustin Achilli’s eyes spit thin jets ofbloodevery time someone sends inanother proposal \nfor My Extremely Small Suburb by Night, which features 35 vampires living in a \nbedroom community that sports two gas stations, a single strip mall and a high school \nthat isn’t necessarily large enough to field a decent football team. \nThe thing that so many people forget when sending in proposals (and indeed, it’s \nalmost heartbreaking sometimes to see the labor lavished on proposals for books that \nsimply cannot see print) is that the books have to befmeveeryone. They can’t just be for “god \nroleplayers,” whoever that is. They can’t just be for people who play a certain style or \npeople who know not to abuse the rules in a certain way because that’s not the way it \nworks. Just as a would-be writer loses control of her submission the instant she puts it in \nthe mail, the developer loses control of the book the instant it gets shipped out to stores \nand distributors and -De0 prohibe -players. That means that the book has to speak for \nitself. It has to cover all of the bases. It has to be useful from the get-go for everyone from \nthe most immersive roleplayer to the rampaging gunbunny twink who wants to play a \nHIT-Mark just so he can blow stuff up real good. The book has to be accessible to everyone \n"

The notion of putting a snobbish disclaimer reading, “Buy this book only if you’re \na good roleplayer!” is beyond ludicrous. Instead, it has to be usable by everyone, so that \nanyone can get anything he wants from the setting and genre out of it. \nSo that meant that rules sets that were only good for small-troupe play had to go \nbye-bye. That meant that proposals that relied on superior roleplaying and personal \nassessments of Paradox had to go out the window because, let’s face it, you may not \ncheat, but you know someone who does. It meant that systems that relied on too many \nNarrators or too many this or that had to be put aside. Most of all, it meant that games \nthat worked perfectly for a particular group, with a particular Storyteller and Narrator \nstaff, had to get chucked because you’re just not going to get that dynamic anywhere \nelse. What works perfectly for one game almost inevitably hits some bumpy spots with \nany other group of players because they don’t play the way you do, and the delicate \nchecks and balances that come from a tight-knit group with a guiding hand on the rules \ntiller just don’t translate. \nSo that’s the real reason I never did Mage for MET.

The trouble was I could never see them \nworking quite well for all circumstances and, in the long run, that’s what the book had \nto be in order to make it out the door. And since none of those submissions, and not \neven any combination of those submissions, was going to be able to be transformed into \nthat sort of book, that’s as far as the project went. Had a suitable proposal come in, 1 \nwould have done it in a heartbeatI3, but sadly, that was never the case. \nAnd that, sad to say, is the truth of the matter. If folks really want, I’ll swear up and \ndown that it was alien mind control that made me not do it, but sad to say, it was a lot \nless complicated than that. Will there ever be an MET Mage?

Part One, printed last issue, included: \nAn overview of the @eat War era, including the Insurrection. \nThe Legions and Guilds during the Fourth Great Maelstrom, along with ageneral \nsense of existence during the @eat War. \nCharacter creation, includingnew Archetypes, Abilities, Thorns and the like for \nthe era, along with period versions of some Arcanoi. \nPart Two includes: \nRules for Maelstrom behavior and survival. \nGuidelines on using Charon in @eat War games. \nArcanoi of other Dark Kingdoms, for use by wraiths stranded in Stygian \nterritory by the storm. \nMortwights as characters, including revised versions of some Dark Arcanoi. \nSome prominent places and people of the era. \nSTORM \nCLOUDS \nH I ~ H E R  \nTHANTHE \nMOON: \nT H E  GREAT MAELSTROM \n- \nA Great Maelstrom is an event and a condition. It’s a storm cast up out of \nthe Labyrinth, blasting through the Tempest to the Shadowlands, battering \nagainst the Shroud itself. It carries the inanimate debris of the Labyrinth and \nTempest, and it carries vast legions of Spectres, forced from their Oblivion- \ntainted homes, constantly wounded by the vibrancy of the upper lands of the \ndead and eager to inflict compensatory pain on others. \nCumulative pain and suffering in the Skinlands feeds the cycle of change \nwithin the Labyrinth. The more the material world feeds Oblivion, the more \nservants of Oblivion rise up to reap the dark harvest. Spectres don’t want to be \nthere, however; they yearn for the day when the storm clouds settle and they can \nreturn to the now-deserted Labyrinth. In the meantime, there are souls to destroy. \nThe storm begins with gale-force winds pouring through Nihils or ripping \ntheir own passages from Tempest to Shadowlands. The stronger the storm, the \nsharper its onset. The Fourth Great Maelstrom began with miles-high geysers of \nblack sludge erupting at the Somme. Within days, clouds carrying shards of dead \nsoldiers’ dreams and the poisonous remains of dead soldiers’ tears towered over \nthe moon. It took more than a decade for the last of them to subside. \nThe strength of a Great Maelstrom ebbs and flows. Sometimes the storm is \nalmost as intense as in the initial outbreak. Other times, it’s nearly calm. Wraiths can \nfind no rhythm or pattern to these changes. Experience shows that wraiths must \nsimply watchcarefully, take advantage of lulls and act swiftly when the storm returns. \nFighting the storm requires wraiths to act on several fronts. Airborne, ground- \nbased and seafaring soldiers set forth to fight the Spectres the storm carries. Arcanoi \nand force of will can drive back the storm itself. Finally, the Skinlands conditions \nthat feed the storm must change to reduce the flow of passion into the void. Doing \nany of that in the midst of civil war (as is the case during and after the Great War) \nis hard, and it breeds unusual alliances. Some wraiths join forces against the storm \n"

      "text": "no matter what else their fellow warriors may be doing while others would rather let \nthe storm prevail than allow the wrong opponents to succeed. \nWraiths depend on Citadels and Haunts for shelter during the years of a Great \nMaelstrom. Unfortunately, corporeal structures aren’t always much good. The stron- \ngest walls don’t help when the enemy comes from the skies, for instance, and stout roofs \ndon’t help when defenders become demoralized. Oblivion’s generals routinely mobi- \nlize newly created Spectres as shock troops because the spectacle of one’s former friends \nand allies having become ravening creatures of the enemy weakens any wraith’s will \nto resist. A wraith who can turn off his feelings and deal with the problem without \nemotional burden is a wraith well on the way to becoming Shadow-Eaten himself. \nWraiths caught outside shelter when the storm winds pick up must \nimprovise as best they can. Some put hooks into the ground to keep themselves \nfrom blowing away. Others link their armor together to form a single unit \nmassive enough to resist most efforts at displacement. \nThe Great Maelstrom carries pieces of wraiths and of souls that never became \nwraiths, along with a lot of generic plasm and countless Plasmics. Fragments of bone, \nshards of memories and the occasional relic bullet fall from the sky during a storm. The \nScavenger Folk specialize in following storm fronts and harvesting whatever looks \nuseful. Most are skilled craftsmen and relic maintainers. They maintain a complex \nlanguage of their own, much like wandering nomadic traders in the Skinlands, and \nthey are rumored to possess special arts in Fa&, \nPhanm, fifeweb and Usury. \nLimb markets flourish in every Necropolis after a particularly strong storm blows \nthrough. Relic and Artifact limbs, whose owners are now so much shredded plasm, are \nalways in demand. Some wraiths enter the Shadowlands missing one or more limbs \nwhile more lose them in the course of the war. Gleaners must be quick: Severed limbs \ndissipate unless kept wet in plasm until a master Moliator can stabilize them. The \nresulting trade encourages all sorts of official and unofficial deals for sponsorship, \nprotection rackets and even (sometimes) peaceful, mutually profitable commerce. \nMAELSTROM \nFORCE LEVELS \nThe Beaufort-Granogrec Scale, developed by members of the Iron Legion’s \nOffice of Maelstrom Preparedness, classifies storms on a 1-5 scale. \nForce One. Winds blow to 40 mph, with occasional gusts higher. The storm \nconsists mostly of water-like liquids brought up from the Tempest. The little solid \ndebris that falls includes few pieces more than an inch or so long, almost none of it with \nsharp edges or other dangerous features. Dead and dying Plasmics sometimes fall. Few \nSpectres travel in Force-One storms. Exposed wraiths take no more than a maximum \nof four levels of damage per hour, generally no more than one. Two levels of armor \nprovide complete protection, as do even minimal walls and ceilings. Haunts reduce \ndamagebytwolevelsperHauntrating, evenwhenthestructureitselfis physically weak. \nForceTwo. Windsblow to8Omph, withsomestrongergusts.~in~llsco~tantly \nandgenerally containssmelly, strangely coloredliquidsandlive,wrig&ng Plasmics. Solid \ndebris, ranging from divots of Shadowlands ground to wind-polished shards of bone and \nStygian steel, falls constantly. Spectres move routinely through the storm. Wraiths take \na one+Trait penalty to movement-related challenges while exposed, and they suffer four \nto six levels of damage per hour outside. Some or all of this damage is aggravated about \none-quarter of the time. Armor provides its usual protection, while Haunts reduce \ndamage by one level per Haunt rating. The storm breaks windows, rips away loose roofs \nand the like, but it cannot blow through solid structures. \nForce Three. Winds blow to 120 mph or more.

Rain and debris slashes in from \nall angles to penetrate any space not tightly sealed off. Spectres converge on \nexposed wraiths in as little as a minute. Wraiths take a three-Trait penalty to all \nchallenges while outdoors. Exposed wraiths suffer eight to 12 levels of damage \nevery hour. One or more levels of this damage i s  aggravated half the time. Armor \nprovides one less level of protection than usual, and Haunts block one less level \nof damage than usual.

Souls of foreign soldiers that would \nnormally go to another Dark Kingdom are stuck in Stygian lands for the duration, \njust as the souls of Europeans and Americans who die elsewhere seldom make it back \nto their own homes. The presence of these exiles creates social tensions. \nSoldiers from the various colonies in Asia and Africa fight in Europe on behalf \nof their colonial masters, and some die. Wraiths from Africa generally hide, \nparticularly after the Ivory Trail begins. The wraiths in the Bush of Ghosts work a \npowerful ritual that compels trapped wraiths who’d normally go to Stygia to walk- \nwithout rest - \nfrom Africa to Europe. A great many Stygian wraiths perish in the \nstorms or from other adversaries, and those who survive generally suffer permanent \ninjuries. Wraiths capable of imposing such acurse seem monstrous and fearsome, and \nthey risk capture by the Hierarchy or destruction at the hands of hghtened mobs. \nIndian wraiths face a much less dire situation. They don’t know the full \nscope of the horror that waits for them back home, and many suffer from \nprofound disillusionment at finding how little of Buddhist, Hindu or other faith \nseems true in the Underworld. Some Indian wraiths exhibit a special Arcanos, \none valuable in many contexts. Some become enslaved, but others find comfort- \nable patronage. Those who can’t go home pursue an independent existence. \nBEHEST \nStygian observers speak of the Bush of Ghosts as if the African Shadowlands \nwere a single thing. Some would-be scholars take words from a single language and \nassume that all African wraiths use them. In truth, Africa is a continent with \nhundreds of peoples. Their languages vary, as do their concepts of the nature of the \nsoul, the afterlife and the role of the dead. The reality of the Underworld doesn’t \nprecisely match any mortal’s teachings; all African wraiths face surmises. \n"

The storms sustain \nMortwights, however. While Maelstrom winds blow, make a Static Angst Test \nagainst a difficulty of nine Traits, minus one per level of the storm. If this test \nsucceeds, reduce the day’s damage by one if the storm level is Force Three or less. \nCancel the day’s damage altogether if the Maelstrom force level is four or five. \nC R E A T I N ~ A  \nM O R T W I ~ H T  \nCHARACTER \nConcept. Choose a Nature and Demeanor from the Shadow Archetypes \nthat appear in Oblivion and part one of this article (Mind’s Eye Theatre \nJournal: Issue 5 ,  p. 45). Remember that a living person becomes a Mortwight \nby dying in some particularly terrible and unpleasant way. \nAttributes and Abilities. Assign Attribute and Abilities levels as usual. \n*ArcanoiGmtWar-eraMortwightsbeginwithonelevelinHive-Mmd,onelevel \nin Tempest Wavingand five levels of other Dark Arcanoi. Mortwights created when the \nGreat Maelstroms don’t blow begin with one level of Hive-Mind and five levels of other \nDark Arcanoi. Mortwights can only learn reg& Arcanoi in the course of play. \nBackgrounds. Assign five levels of Backgrounds. Mortwights cannot \nacquire Eulolon, Notoriety or Status. \nDark Passions and Fetters. Choose four Dark Passions and four Fetters \nas usual. Most Mortwights have the place of death as a Fetter, and all the Fetters \nrelated to painful or otherwise unpleasant moments. Mortwights cannot resolve \nFetters, but they can lose them to destruction. \nAngst and Being. Your character begins with five Angst Traits and three \nBeing Traits, as given in Oblivion. \nCorpus. Your character begins with 10 Corpus. Each time the Mortwight \nfails a challenge, make two Simple Tests. If both fail, the Mortwight loses a level \n"

The whole point of his traveling in disguise is that \nhe wants to see what others say when they’re not compelled to treat him as Imperator. \nWhen he deems it necessary to act, though, nobody doubts who he is.

Very occasionally he tries to issue a warning to someone \nhe’s become fond of, but experience shows that his doing so almost never works out well. \nAn appearance by Charon should be avery special moment in the chronicle. \nHe doesn’t spend very long in any given place.

He doubts that he’s built his \nempire wisely, and he wants to see just what they do. He usually presents himself \nas a soldier of the Emerald Legion weary of the war, uncertain of his loyalties and \nseeking sanctuary. Once in place, he listens to what others say about the officials, \nand he compares it with what the officials say and what he sees them doing. \nShadows.

My name is Laura Hanson, and I work as a part-time \ncostumer in New York City (among other things).

I also included some tips on how to \ndress and where to shop for items that would help to emulate that period without \nfalling back on stereotypes for inspiration. \nWhen I turned in my first article, our illustrious developer said “Great! It’s \njust what I wanted! Now, could you please reverse all of that for your next \npiece? Maybe something about identifying headwear and accessories, and a bit \nwith a dog. People love dogs.” \n“Sure,” I said, smiling. You always smile when talking to your developer. \nEven when he can’t see you. Even through clenched teeth. “I’d be happy to.” \nSo, this time, I take a look at some of the more common (and accurate) character \nstereotypes from each of these three time periods. I also discuss ways to emulate them \neasily using evocative headgear, accessories, jewelry and so forth. Hopefdly these \nsuggestionswill workasvisualcues to youralter-ego’srole insocietysoothersdon’thave \nto spend the first half-hour of play asking, ‘‘What is it your character does, again?“ \nConsider this article sort of a “fast-and-dirty” guide to costuming. \nMention the Dark Ages to most people, and most of them (who know what \nyou’re talking about) will bring up some fairly common stereotypes. Figures such \nas King Arthur and his knights, Guinevere and her ladies-in-waiting, court \njesters, monks and Robin Hood tend to get mentioned the most. Those figures \ndo actually have some basis in fact, although not always to the full extent to \nwhich they appear in media today.

Her \nLadyship was the only person on the estate who held keys to all of the locks in the \ncastle or manor house, making her ring of keys a significant visual cue to the power \nshe held. To emulate this station with a prop, find the largest metal ring that you \ncan and thread keys onto it. Antique keys work best, of course, but if you aren’t \nlucky enough to have an eccentric aunt with an attic full of nifty props, you can \noften purchase modem copies (of the keys) from craft or do-it-yourself jewelry or \nbead shops. After you have your ring assembled, tie it to a length of ribbon, cord \nor chain, then allow it to dangle authoritatively from your waist over your skirts. \nWithout question, the most distinctive piece of costuming you can invest in \nis the jester hat. This hat is the definitive article of clothing for a court jester, and \nit comes in a variety of styles, all of which have several basic things in common. \nFor instance, jester hats have multiple points that either hang down like floppy dog \nears or have stuffing so that they stand away from the head. They come in multiple \ncolors, and they often have bells sewn on at the points and a stiff brim cut to \nresemble a crown (something that developed from the fools mockery of kings and \nprinces). These hats are fairly easy to find at costuming shops or Renaissance \nFestivals (or even those funky hat shops that show up in malls). \nThe rest of the costume of the fool is also quite distinct and very brightly colored. \nOften, his clothes were the cast-offs of his betters, pieced together from worn out suits \nof clothing so that he might have one legging in one color, one in another and a tunic \nfrom still a third outfit, none of which matched. The best way to evoke this look for \nyour jester character is to make sure that nothing matches; avoid co-ordination \ncompletely. Even if the clothes are modern, if you think like a little kid getting dressed \non her own for the first time, you can look pretty clownish. After that, add jingle bells. \nTie them onto your clothing at your wrists, ankles, knees, elbows (anywhere really) \nwith ribbons in bright, obnoxious colors. Okay, so you can’t sneak up on anyone with \nbells tied allover your body, but hey, you’re a fool; nooneshouldbeafraidofyouanyway \n(or should they?). One final effective touch is that of the mock scepter or wand. This \nprop can be as simple as a painted wooden dowel rod with ribbons and bells tied around \nthe top or as fancy as the jester-headed styles sold in gift shops and at fairs. \nT H E  \nC O U R T J E S T E R ,  O R  THE \nEOOL \nO T H E R  O E E I C E R S O E T H E  C O U R T ,  I N C L U D I N G  LORDS \nThe ranks of office were all in the jewelry. During the Dark Ages, wealthy \nmen often wore as much jewelry as (if not more than) their female counterparts. \nChains of office were decorations rather like oversized necklaces that draped \nover the shoulders. They could be as simple as a thick, unadorned gold or silver \nchain or as elaborate as linked medallions covered in gemstones. (Think of \n1970s disco belts for an approximate visual.) \nAlso, go heavy on the rings. If you can find really heavy bands with large \n“gemstones,” you’ll be on the right track. If you can wear enough of them, even \nclass and fraternity rings give you the right look. I have had a lot of luck in the \nC O S T U M I N ~ E O B  \nLIVE-ACTION \nPLAY \n@ \n"

This accouterment was a fashion that seems to \nhave picked up when Europeans came in closer contact with “Eastern” cultures, \nso if you wish to wear them during play, don’t, or keep them small. \nM O N K S  \nThe costume of the monk has never really changed, much. It consists of a \nlong, plain robe with full sleeves and a cowl or hood. Tie the robe at the waist \nwith a length of rope that has been knotted at eachend. In addition, these monks \nwore plain leather or rope sandals similar to the Birkenstock brand of today. And \nthat’s it, folks. Some might also have carried a wooden cross or rosary beads, but \nnothing more. Unfortunately, there really aren’t any short-cuts or easy visual \ncues here. You really do need the robes. However, if you just can’t come up with \nthem, dress very plainly, in loose clothing of all one color. Avoid black in favor \nof gray or brown, or even white or off-white. Then track down a length of rope \nlong enough to tie around your waist with the ends hanging down to about knee- \nlength. And, if your character is very penitent, you can add a wooden cross to \nwear around your neck or hanging down from the rope belt on a leather thong. \nT H E  WILD \nWEST \nThe old days of the American Wild West are stuffed full of stereotypes that \nmost of us have been familiar with since we were children. Gunslingers, gamblers, \nold prospectors, saloon girls, dandies and soldiers are just a few of the many cast \nmembers found in the Wild West. The basic Western man’s outfit consisted of a \ncollarless shirt, wool pants or denim jeans (blue only), a belt or suspenders, boots \nand sometimes a vest and a coat or jacket of some sort. The two other common and \nvital elements were a wide-brimmed hat and some sort of kerchief to keep the sun \noff your head and neck. Women were still tightly corseted, and they went about \nin long skirts, fitted jackets and high-necked, long-sleeved blouses. While most \nstock outfits of the time are fairly complex, each normally had one or two \nsignificant pieces of equipment that define the wearer’s role in society. \nC ~ U N S L I N C ~ B E S  \nLets face it, the most visual cue for a gun-slinger is his (or her, thank you \nSharon Stone) gun. This cue presents a problem in live-action play, of course, \nbecause carrying actual firearms or even decent replicas in public is pretty much \nthe height of folly. It’s also not the easiest task to find guns of the appropriate \ngenre at short notice. My solution is to skip the guns and wear the belts. Wear \none as a regular belt; wear the other as a gun belt substitute. Make the substitute \nsomething wide and leather, slung low over one hip(or low on both if you want \nthe double-holster effect). Throw a long coat or duster over the whole outfit and \nhide the fact that your guns are missing. Or wear empty holsters and stuff your \nitem cards for your pistol(s) into them so that the ends show prominently. Then \nadd a bandana (tied bandit style) around your neck. \nC ~ A M  \nB L E E S  \nThese characters wear a look close to that of the gun-fighter, but with a \ntouch more style.

Dandy types are proper little Victorian-era clerks, \nof modern geeks. A quick fix here should include some of \nhat, marking your character as someone either just visitin \nknow any better (since seasoned Westerners wore broad-bi \nstronger western sun off their faces and necks); wire-rin \ngarters (elastic bands worn just above or below the elbow dllU U S ~ U  LO IWIU WIUK \nsuit sleeves out of your work); and finally a pocket-watch, or at least a chain \ndangling from pocket to pocket to give the appearance of a watch. If you don’t \nactually have the watch, don’t worry. A lot of the actual dandies didn’t either! \nTHE \nSALOON \nGIRL \nThis archetype represents one of the most stereotyped characters of the \nWild West. Usually presented in the movies as a pretty young thing, or at least \na still-attractive matron, a real saloon girl was not quite so glamorous. There was \nno standard uniform, other than bright, gaudy colors and as little fabric as could \nbe gotten away with in public. This standard produced dresses that had the \nsleeves cut off and the top cut down, and the full, petticoat skirts of the day were \ncut short to show off the legs. Sometimes (in very rough establishments), the \ngirls simply wore bloomers, chemises and their corsets. \nBut who cares? I’d rather take my cue from the movies, especially since that’s \nwhat people are most familiar with. So do the following: Wear something tight and \ncorset-like on top and ah11 skirt that you can gather up over your knees. Then add \nfishnet hose, with a garter around your exposed knee, and lace-up ankle boots. Pile \nyour hair up on your head, then tuck in ostrich plumes (available in most craft \nstores) and tie a length of black satin ribbon around your neck as a choker. Voila! \nAfter the Civil War (as well as during), many soldiers wanted nothing more \nthan to get away fromthe bloodshed and badmemoriesof the eastern United States. \nIn so doing, they went west to build new lives for themselves, often with nothing \nmore than the clothes on their backs. Those clothes were highly likely to be the \nuniforms they had deserted in. To emulate this look, start with either dark blue or \ndarkgray pants (chooseaside), awhiteshirt,suspendersandblackboots (ridingstyle, \nno laces). The uniform jackets are a bit harder to come by, but they aren’t necessary. \nIf you can, check out costuming supply stores for the combat uniform caps. \nSOLDIERS \nT H E   REA AT WAR \nThe most difficult thing about fast-and-easy dressing for this period is that there \nsimply aren’t many stereotypes to copy. The only solid, stable images from this time \nare those from the military services. Civilian men’s clothing was not that markedly \ndifferent from that of the Victorians who came before or the swingers of the ’20s who \nfollowed after. Women’s fashions, on the other hand, ranged all over. A woman who \nbegan the war era as a corseted Edwardian (wearing a floor-length dress covered in \n"

And that was just at the beginning and the \nend of the time period. In the years between, there was no set style at all. \nMILITARY \nSERVICES \nBy far the most prevalent image associated with the Great War is that of \nmilitary service personnel. Many modem uniforms either saw their start with \nthis war or even now are at least in the “tradition” of the uniforms introduced \nhere. So the following is a short run-down of each American branch‘s uniform \nand some (hopefully) quick steps you can take to dress accordingly. \nSoldiers (or doughboys, as they were called) wore khaki-green uniforms \nthat resembled the modem dress uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted \nPolice in a more subdued color scheme. When not in the midst of battle, soldiers \nwore “campaign hats,” rather like a khaki version of a Canadian mounty’s hat. \nDuring combat, they wore metal helmets that looked rather like an upside-down \nsoup bowl with a chin strap. \nSailors dressed in navy blue bell pants with a matching “middy” shirt that had \nfull sleeves and a white collar, square at the back and coming to a point at the front \nof the blouse. In addition, they wore the standard white sailor hat and a solid black \nkerchief tied around the neck. Sailors’ shoes were black, and this costume is \nabsolutely the only one with which it might be okay to wear black athletic shoes. \nPilots were a new breed who flew for both the Army and the Navy, as the \nAir Force did not exist yet. In addition to the well-known brown leather jacket, \ngoggles, tight-fitting leather flight helmet and white silk scarf, the uniforms’ \nshirts, ties and pants were tan in color, and the boots were dark brown. A dark \nbrown baseball jacket (no logo) would work well as a substitute for the bomber \njacket. Leather winter hunters caps (with the ear flaps) suffice as flight helmets, \nand some of the sturdier swim goggles on the market will masquerade well as \nflight goggles as long as you keep them on the helmet. \nCIVILIAN \nD R E S S ~ O R  \nMEN \nThings to look for: Men sported bowler hats, fedoras and straw “boaters” (think \nbarbershop quartets) in the summer. The silk top hat was still in vogue for evening, \nas was the walking stick. Pocket watches were still in use, and they often had small \n“Swiss Army” knives suspended from their chains. Wristwatches had also become \npopular as the war demonstrated their practicality. If you decide to wear one, go for \nthe “classic” styles that included utilitarian metal faces on leather straps. \nMen wore gloves for both day and evening. They wore thin kidskin or \nleather during the day and white fabric in the evening. They still carried \nhandkerchiefs of colored fabric (or white with a colored border) during the day \nand plain white ones during the evening. Leather wallets and billfolds had \nreplaced the earlier pocket change purse. And last, but certainly not least, the \ncigarette made it’s appearance, replacing the pipe and making way for all sorts \nof nifty cigarette carrying-cases made of polished metal or leather. Just make sure \nyou realize that it was only the cases that were cool and stylish at the time, not \nthe actual cigarettes. (Okay, sermon over.) \n"

      "text": "C I V I L I A N  \nDRESS \nE O R  WOMEN \nAs I believe I mentioned earlier, women’s fashions of this period were all \nover the place. The corset had finally fallen out of fashion in about 1912, helped \nalong no doubt by the need to use steel for more military purposes. The \nfashionable silhouette then changed from the “S” curve (bust pushed forward, \nrear pushed backward) to a more relaxed reverse curve with shoulders comfort- \nably slouched back and the hips forward in a permanent leaning posture. \nBasic rules of dress for the look of this time are as follows: Skirt lengths should \nbe about six to eight inches above the ankle for both day and evening wear except \nfor the most formal of fashions. The tunic dress became popular at this time, so any \nsort of straight, sleeveless dress should work to emulate this style. Just remember \nthat women were glad to be rid of structured clothing, so the fashion moved away \nfrom anything form-fitting. Fabrics were soft, and they draped easily. The only \ndefinition of figure on the tunic dresses came from occasional scarves or belts at \nthe waist, usually closer to hip level than the true waistline. Many tunicdresses had \nstraight skirts and tops that bloused over the belt. \nPearl jewelry was very much in style as well. You can wear both choker and \nlong varieties of pearl or bead necklaces, and pearl and dangling earrings. \nFolding fans and paper parasols are also great accessories. Because the clothing \nbecame so simple, both jewelry and accessories became more elaborate, and that \nis the visual idea you should follow when costuming yourself for play. \nIn conclusion, there are just a couple of things I would like to add to enhance \nplaying with props. First, if you have something that you know would be just perfect \nfor your character, but you don’t want to lose it, don’t take it to the game. Leave stuff \nthat you care about at home where it’s safe and it won’t get lost. Even if you know \nyou’re careful with your stuff, sh*t happens, and it’s better to be safe than sorry. \nSecond, most of the things that I mentioned in this article can be found at \nthe following kinds of stores: craft shops (even Hobby Lobby or A.C. Moore), \nfabric stores (such as So-Fro or Northwest) and, my personal favorites, antique \nmalls, flea markets and garage sales. These stores are a goddess-send to any \ncostume designer, and I highly recommend going to as many of them as possible. \n"

In the immediate years to come, European \ncities will expand in both population and technological advancement. Hungry \nempires will cross the threshold of the Atlantic Ocean to conquer the indig- \nenous tribes of the Americas, slaughtering thousands of Wendigo Kinfolk. The \nprogress of mankind will empower the Wyrm in ways yet undreamed while \npushing Mother Gaia to the brink of Apocalypse. \nBut for now, the Wyrm is relatively hidden and the Black Spiral Dancers gather \ntheir strengths in secret. The greatest dangers for the werewolf come from the \nexpanding human population and eachother. The Church still controls the daily lives \nof all humans, from commoner to nobility. As a result, most humans are generally \nsuperstitious and suspicious of anything that seems foreign to the status quo. Anything \nfrom strange travelers from foreign lands to learned studies of medicine and astronomy \ncan be branded “the devil’s own” in these highly religious times. \nBut the greatest threat to Garou at this time comes from their fellow Garou. \nAlthough the Litany is enforced, tribes still clash violently over political issues \nlarge and small. With the exception of the Red Talons, the End Times are a \ndistant dream, uncertain at best. For now, the Garou revel in their heroic deeds \nand tales of glory, unaware the true battle lies ahead of them. . . . \nT H E  TRIBES \nAt this time, the Garou Nation is firmly led by the Silver Fang Tribe, a fact \nthat irritates the Shadow Lords to no end (and will continue to do so well into \nmodern day). Most Garou will yield judgment to the Silver Tribe simply for \nexpedience and because the Fangs will probably demand it anyway. The Shadow \nLords wait patiently for any political error or sign of weakness on the part of the \nSilver Fangs in order to unseat them from their traditional role. \nThe Fenrir maintain a healthy dislike for the Shadow Lords, feeling their \nscheming ways are a sign ofweakness. There is also bad blood between the Fenrir \nand the Fianna, who blame the Fenrir for much of their kin’s woes. Indeed, the \nFianna harbor deep-rooted resentment towards the Nordic tribe and would \nprefer nothing better than its demise. \nIn the cities, the Warders have begun to build ties with the Bone Gnawer \ntribe, finding a common bond in their mutual preference for human settlements. \nAlthough the Warders are still mistrusted and the Bone Gnawers reviled, this \nburgeoning friendship will prove more and more useful as time carries on. \nThe other tribes revere the Red Talons, although the Talons themselves have \ndeveloped a deeper dislike for the city-bound Warders. Warders smell too much \nlike humans in the Talons’ estimation, and very little good can come of that. \nFinally, all of the tribes still harbor lingering suspicions about the nomadic \nSilent Striders, unsure of their wayward travel and lack of permanency in this day. \n"

This piece \ncomesinfromPeter Woodworth, who’s madeammefor himselfwritingMind’s \nEye TheatrematerialsuchasTheShiningHost andLawsoftheEast. Now, \nPete shows that he can write fiction as well as gamespeak, with this tale about the \ndifference between idealism and activism in the World of Darkness. \nNo one else cared. That was what really bothered him. \nNo one cared, God damn it! \nMichael flowed gracefully out of the muddy ocean of people washing down \nthe dirty avenue and into the dark, swirling tidal pool of the alley. Only one other \nperson seemed to visibly notice, and that one only gave him a look of complete \nincredulity. Seduced by the lullaby whispers of their television screens, most \npeople didn’t believe such places still exist - \nif they ever did. They thought that \nback-alley crimes existed only in film noir and clich6 television scripts. \nBullshit. \nMichael’s trained eyes adjusted to the gloom as easily as another person would to \nturning on the lights in a room, bringing the familiar scene into its full, pitiful clarity. \nThree actors this time: a gangly reed of a boy lurking inside his battered leather and \nborrowed pride, an obviously dope-sick girl standing two paces behind him and a \ncringing mess of bloody denim Michael took to be male from the sound of the cries. \nThe girl was holding a shaking knife as her boy gave their victim a vicious kick to the \nribs, not seeming to notice even as Michael increased his pace to intervene. That was \nanother comfortable fiction of popular culture. People assume that girlfriends of even \nthe worst sorts of scum would always hang back from an attack, pulling on their \nboyfnend’s arm and saying stupid things like, “We got the money, Brett, just let him \ngo,” or “Stop it, Slash, you don’t need to hurt him that badly.” \nNor was their victim the usual poor-but-noble old lady or hapless wide-eyed \ntourist. By the look of him, he knew the intimate thrill of the needle better than \nhis attackers. His skin stretched like lifeless white parchment pockmarked with \nfresh bruises and old needle tracks like a masochist’s map. That was exactly why \nit was so easy for everyone else to ignore them, really. They were no one anyone \nwould miss, doing things no one approved of, and if they fought and killed each \nother doing it, so what? Best instead to just keep your feet moving, keep your \nhead down, cross your fingers and pray to God that when your time came, you \nwouldn’t be the one everyone else pretended not to have heard. \nBut Michael always heard. \nWhen he finally reached the scene, he didn’t try to stop and reason with \nanyone. One of the first things he’d learned when he’d joined the Guardian \nAngels was that if the perpetrators were this far gone, pat little speeches and \nplatitudes were less than useless. No, this was a different sort of intervention. \nIn his more darkly introspective moments, Michael liked to think that this \naction was the last resort of civilization.

So when the boy finally noticed him and turned with fists raised, Michael \nsimply took one step forward, grabbed the kid’s wrist and performed a deft magic \ntrick with it. One second the boy was on his feet and yelling, and the next he was \nlying on his back clutching his fractured forearm. \nIgnoring the boy’s surprised wailing, Michaelusedone hand to toss aside the \ngirl’s dirty knife, and he sent the other solidly into her solar plexus. She went \ndown with a thin cough, gasping for air. Sparing a speculative glance at her \nhowling boyfriend, Michael knelt by her side. Taking her chin in his hands, \nMichael burned his gaze deep into her eyes, willing her to see the righteous fury \nand absolute disgust she inspired in him. It had an immediate effect. Her eyes \nwidened, first in shock, then in absolute, naked terror. \n“DO you have any drugs?” he demanded. “Money?” \nThe girl nodded. Michael held out his hand, and she put a small bag of coke \n(just residue really) and a pair of crumpled twenties in it. Michael tore the money \nin half with a practiced twist and ground the baggie to pieces beneath his boot. \n“Him?“ She shook her head violently. He couldn’t tell if she was lying or not, but \nhe wagered she wouldn’t risk it in her condition. He’d made his pint now anyway. \n“Leave,” Michael said, his voice as calm and measured as the morning news \nanchor reading the weather report. “If either of you ever comes back to this \nneighborhood, I’ll know, and this pain will be a skinned knee compared to what \nyou’ll feel. Understand me? I’ll be wuiting.” The girl nodded with tears running \ndown her cheeks. “Now go.” \nShe stumbled crazily to her feet, paused just long enough to haul her boy up \nwhere she could shoulder his weight. The two of them limped out of the alley \nand away into the night, hopefully never to return. Michael listened to the \nsounds of them fading, then headed over to their victim. The boy was younger \nthan he’d thought at first and had been plenty sick on something before they’d \ngotten to him. He barely seemed to register anything at all, even as Michael \ncalled for the ambulance on his cell phone. \n‘Ws okay, buddy,” he said gently.

His left eye -the one \nthat wasn’t swollen shut - \nwas glazed, but it still tried to cling to lucidity. Michael \nsaw real and immediate fear growing there. The kid whimpered like a rabbit, and his \npurple, dislocated jaw kept trying to move.

Something came up that I had \nto take care of.” He bowed his head, and shame burned him. \nTo his relief, Marsilio waved the matter away. “NO matter, Michael, no \nmatter. I was just discussing some ventures with an associate anyway.” \nMichael couldn’t suppress a quick frown at that. He had seen Nigel - \nthe wiry \nEnglishman who had started keeping the company books a little over two weeks ago \n- \nleaving as he was coming in, and he had gotten the same false smile and dead eyes \nfrom Nigel that he always did. Of course a man in Nigel’s position had every right \nto be in conference with Marsilio whenever the latter so chose, but something about \nNigel’s look unsettled Michael just the same. Jealousy, maybe? Somehow, Michael \ndidn’t doubt it, but he’d also never had much time for those games before. \nPersonal politics always irritated him. He’d originally joined the Guardian \nAngels because they offered a chance to make a real, concrete difference in people’s \nlives instead of simply adding to the corrupt web of red tape that neatly entangled \nand eviscerated the so-called “social initiatives” that the city council was always \npushing. The trick was using one’s fists effectively and not adding to the violence. \nHaving learned to do so, Michael’s skill and tolerance for social maneuvering had \ndriedup, leaving him edgy and tense whenever he suspected that it was at work. Now \nthat he worked for Marsilio, however, petty politicking had become a necessary skill. \nEveryone in the organization wanted the boss’ ear or a piece of his time. \n“Is something upsetting you?” Marsilio asked, looking at him closely. \n“There is, sir.” Michael licked his lips. He felt like he was doing something \ndirty, but he couldn’t ignore what was building up in the back of his mind any \nlonger. “A problem.” \nOne fine eyebrow went up. “Oh? And what might that be?” \n“The real reason I was - \nthat is, I’ve been - \nI mean-” \nMichael shifted \nnervously from foot to foot under the weight of Marsilio’s gaze, took a deep \nbreath, and pulled his focus back together. “I’ve heard some rumors lately, sir. \nI was checking into them when I was delayed.” \nMarsilio leaned forward with a concerned frown on his face. “‘Checking into \nthem’? What does that mean? What kind of things are you talking about, Michael?“ \nIt took all of his will, but Michael didn’t break eye contact. “I’ve started \nhearing word on the street, sir, that says this company isn’t just running renovation \nefforts anymore.” Marsilio looked at him blankly, waiting. His tongue grew \nsluggish, unwilling to pronounce the words he was compelling it to say. \n“Sir, what I’m saying is that I’ve heard there are all sorts of things going on: \nextortion, loawsharking, prostitution, bribery.” He shook his head. “I’ve even \nheard that some kind of cult has started kidnapping people off our streets!” His \ntone became even more sincere, pleading for acceptance. “Growing up in the \ncity, I learned something about rumors, sir. Hear something once, ignore it. Hear \nit twice, remember it. Hear it three times.. .?” \n“Is this laundry list supposed to be an accusation of some kind?” Marsilio’s \ntone was measured, but menace simmered beneath its surface, barely restrained. \nMichael flinched away from the force of the emotion. \n“Not against you specifically, sir,” Michael said quickly, horrified that he \nmight have implied as much. “But it’s just that there have been a lot of new faces \nMIND’S EYE THEATRE \nJOURNAL \n"

Michael had strongly \nsuspected some of the new employees were up to no good from the first moment he saw \nthem. It was the most forceful charge he could manage under that burning stare, however. \nMarsilio held his gaze a moment longer, then sighed and leaned back in his \nchair. “Michael, do you suppose you are the sole reason that this neighborhood \nhas gone from one of New York‘s worst to one of its fastest-growing enterprise \nzones in the year my company has been here?” \nHumiliation touched his cheeks. “No, sir, but-” \nMarsilio held up a hand. “Please. I didn’t mean to insult you.” A wry smile \ntwitched at the comers of his mouth. “You’re my most trusted lieutenant, Michael, \nand I hope you know that. Without your expert assistance and the aid of your other \nGuardian Angel friends, I never would have known where to start in a place like this \nneighborhood used to be, let alone been able to purge it of the filth that infested it.” \nEven as Michael’s heart swelled with pride, however, Marsilio’s smile fell \naway. “But as my representative to the community, your presence is required \nthere most of the time. Where does that leave me?Or the times when I need help \nwith something more esoteric, like a federal tax form?” Marsilio shrugged. “DO \nyou see where this is leading, Michael? We’re agrowing company. I need to bring \nin new people to make it work.” The smile returned. “I always need new people.” \nThat just about sealed thediscussion, but part o fMichael’s mindstillwouldn’t relent. \n“Yes, sir, I understand, but there haw been a lot of new projects, and as far as I can see, \nnot all of them seem to be in line with what the company goals have been in the past.“ \nHe paused, realizing his hands were shaking. “For instance, why did the company \nbuy the Jackson Apartments? I thought we were just supposed to renovate them.” \nTo Michael’s surprise, Marsilio actually laughed. “Well, you didn’t think we’d \njust keep putting up new storefronts and locking up hoodlums forever, did you?The \ncity’sdone that for ages, andlookat how little progress has beenmade! No, my friend, \nthat’s just the beginning. Ifwe’re going to make adifference here, we’regoing to have \nto start investing in other areas.” He gestured to the door. ‘That’s why Nigel was just \nhere, in fact. We were discussing diversifytng our assets, getting more involved in \nday-to-day life instead of just putting up buildings for people to fill.” \nHe rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “Still, perhaps I should’ve been more \ncautious in hiring. I’ll tell you what, I’ll personally do a review of all our \nemployees and their current projects, and if anything comes up suspicious, I’ll \nlet you know and we can work out a solution. Does that sound good?” Michael \nnodded slowly, and Marsilio gave him a radiantly apologetic smile. “I’m sorry if \nI haven’t kept you as updated as I should have.” \n“No, really, sir, don’t worry about it,” Michael said, hanging his head. What \nwas he thinking, bringing this up without all the facts? “I just wanted to make \nsure things weren’t being overlooked, that’s all.” \n“Don’t worry about it. It’s that kind of dedication I selected you for, Michael.” \nWith the matter apparently concluded, Marsilio rose and went to the window, \nwhich overlooked one of the many restoration projects the company sponsored in \nthe neighborhood.

Very important business.” \nMichael drew himself up straighter. “What is it?” \n“Rumors have arisen of another gang trying to move into this neighborhood. \nThey call themselves the ‘Midnight Killaz,’ or some such nonsense, and they have \nmade it clear that they wish to begin pushing poison in this territory.” A hint of \nanger crept into Marsilio’s voice, and Michael took a step back. That was more \nemotion than nearly anything ever evoked in his reserved superior, and the \nthought of Marsilio’s full fury shook him with fright. “Perhaps they assume that the \nneighborhood is free for them to claim since we disposed of the last bunch.” His \neyes, hard before, took on the cold sheen of gun barrels as he looked across his desk \nat his favorite lieutenant. “Prove them wrong, Michael. Before this happens \nagain.” Long fingers pushed a newspaper clipping across the table. \nMichael didn’t need to see what it was. Two nights ago, a poor couple and their \nthree young children had been found shot to death, apparently for complaining to \nthe police about men who were dealing out of the apartment down the hall. Michael \nhad known the couple himself; they had been early supporters when Marsilio began \nthe plan to revitalize the neighborhood and drive out the criminal element it \ncontained. New York at large had relegated the killing to the isn’t-that-horrible \nworld of page three in the press, quick to chalk it up to the daily horrors of the \nnotorious South Bronx. Michael himself had even believed it to be a random act of \nviolence, brutal and deserving of the full extent of the justice they could muster, but \nessentially an isolated, senseless, horrible and still all-too-common incident. \nBut this news changed everything. \n“I’ll take care of it, sir,” he said. “Don’t worry.” \nHe felt the familiar righteous fury building within, tempered by the \nknowledge that now he knew where to direct it. A plan of action began forming \nas he contemplated the different tactics he’d have to use. This many enemies \nmight call for some outside help, but he knew where to get that, too. He found \nhimself gazing at the tiny golden cobra that adorned Marsilio’s finger and \nthinking that was exactly the right symbol for their operation: fast, decisive and \nvery, very deadly. “They don’t have long now.” \nMarsilio smiled at him, and Michael’s spirit soared with pride. “Very good. \nTake these with you, then, and give them to your allies before the battle. It will \nhelp fortify them for the rigors of combat, as it does for you.” \nMarsilio extended a hand, revealing a number of small vials filled with dark \nred liquid, and Michael felt the craving within him leap even as he pocketed \nthem. Marsilio hitched off his suit jacket languidly and rolled up the sleeve of \nhis silk shirt. He then pierced his wrist with the stylized fangs on his ring and \noffered the crimson wound to Michael as casually as a mortal might offer a tray \nof hors d’oeuvres at a party. “Of course, you must be thirsty as well.” \nHe hadn’t even finished before Michael fell upon his wrist, drinking deeply \nof the blood he had missed and wondering how he had gone so long without it. \nSomething within Michael wanted to hesitate, wondering at the justice of \ngiving his friends such a gift without their knowledge, but such concerns were \ninsignificant next to his need for the blood. He’d do whatever Marsilio wanted, \nas long as he could keep coming back like this. \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \nMIND’S \nBYE THEATRE \nJOURNAL \n@ \n"

The entire briefing and planning had taken well over two hours, and he felt like \nhe imagined a sergeant must feel before asking his men to overtake an intimidating \nenemy position. “I know just about everyone here, and I know that together we’ve \nall seen some rough places before, but everybody has a breaking point, and I respect \nthat. Recon work is one thing, but this is a lot rougher. If anyone wants out now, feel \nfree to go. There’s no shame in knowing when the water’s gotten too hot for you.” \nHe looked out at the assembled Guardian Angels, but none of them quite \nmet hisgaze. In fact, they haddone very littleduring the presentationofthe plan, \nexcept to murmur a few questions here and there. Michael frowned; solemnity \nwas fine in the face of danger, but this reticence wasn’t like them. Had he \nembarrassed them when he offered them an out? \n“Well? Anyone?” \nNobody budged. \n“C‘mon, guys, talk to me.” He tried to make his words friendly, and a few pairs \nof eyes swiveled his way, but none of them held his own for more than a second. \nMichael felt his temper rising, and he clenched his fists at his side. “Nobody?” \nThis was crazy. Sure, he hadn’t been around as often since taking Marsilio’s \njob offer, but he couldn’t imagine a response like this. “OK! If no one here is \nwilling to commit to finishing this, then I guess I’ll just have to go to the \ncompany and ask them for help. How about that?” \nAfewheadsjerkedupinresponse, wide-eyed,andhecouldfeelthereferencesizzle \nthrough the rmm like electricity. There was another moment of shuffling silence at \nthat, but this time all the eyes returned to him. At last, Pat - \nwho’d been Michael‘s \nfriend since they joined the Angels together - \nstood up. All eyes turned his way. \n“If it’s that important,” Pat said, not holding eye contact with Michael for \nmore than a second, “we’re in. Right?” He looked at the other Angels one by one, \nand they all gave Pat the grudging assent they had been withholdingfromMichae1. \n“Well, thank you, guys,”Michael said, glad that everyone seemed to be back \nin his camp. He checked his watch. “OK! We’ll plan on arriving at just before \none and getting out of there by quarter after one at the latest. Sound good?” \nEveryone nodded, if not overly eagerly. \n“Now, how about a little hot toast before we go out into the cold night, eh?” \nHis own loud laugh drowned out the desultory response from the others, but \nMichael wouldn’t have cared either way. This phase was too critical to allow a \nlukewarm reaction to spook him. He produced and passed around the prepara- \ntory nip of hot cider he’d brought along. \nAs they drank, Michael found himself on the verge of mentioning something \nabout the toast being really “special” - \nconsidering what he’d spiked the cider with \n-but he caught the thought before it could escape his lips. He knew what Marsilio \nwould think of him revealing his nature to others, and his cheeks colored in shame \nat how he nearly let Marsilio down yet again. A part of him distantly felt bad about \nnot telling these men about what he was doing to them, but that part fell silent soon \nenough. After all, he thought, this was war of a kind, and that meant he was morally \nobligated to do anything necessary for his soldiers to stay alive.

Walking through a rough neighborhood with \na weapon on your belt not only begs any number ofproblems with police, possibly being \nmistaken for a criminal yourself, but it also makes you an immediate lethal threat to \nany criminals you come across. A gun’s a gun, after all, and not many criminals have \na problem drawing on someone who’s also strapped. But walk through unarmed, and \nnot only are you daring them to pull their weapon on an unarmed opponent, you’re \nalso makiig a statement about how committed you are to what you’re doing. \nKeeping that factor in mind, Michael and Pat had spent that much extra time \nplanning, making sure the Angels would have the advantage of surprise long \nenough to get to close quarters with the gang members as fast as possible. At that \nrange, the chances of any of the Angels suffering serious injury were as low as they \nwere going to get. Operating unarmed is one thing, but going into danger \ndefenseless is something else entirely. Fortunately, like a lot of young, overconfi- \ndent toughs, the building the Midnight Killaz had picked to occupy was a poorly \ndefensible structure. A quick recon of the area showed that not only had they left \na back entrance poorly guarded by one slack and restless sentry, but the rest of them \nwere either thoroughly stoned or well on their way there by one o’clock. \nOnly one complication arose. Two of the gang members weren’t there - \nprobably out checking on dealers or the like - \nbut the Angels would simply have \nto let that slide. Two Angels out of the 10 stayed out front as lookouts and drivers, \nand the entire force was equipped with walkie-talkies for constant communica- \ntion. Michael further divided the group into two teams, each responsible for a \nfloor, and he outlined their plan of attack in blocks as small as 10 or 20 seconds \neach, making the plan as precise and airtight as possible. Time frame for the whole \noperation: ten minutes maximum, then they were gone, just in case any unex- \npected company decided to drop in or anything else went wrong. They went over \nit enough that when the plan actually went into effect, it was almost routine. \nThe true irony of a well-planned combat situation is that there’s usually not much \nto see.

Marsilio had taught him \nhow to add a supernatural degree of intimidation to his words if he concentrated, and \nhe used it to full effect that night.

Justice had been served, and he was as certain as he was sitting there \nthat they’d never see any of those kids again- and quite probably no other gangs \nlike them, either. As dawn crept up and Michael retreated to his apartment to \nsleep, the vivid afterglow of victory kept from his mind the dark, nagging \nthoughts of what he had done to his friends, and he thought nothing of it. \nAfter all, a win’s a win, right? \nAfew nightslater, Michael tookanunscheduledpatrol, just walking and reveling \nin the feeling of freedom that always accompanied defeating another menace to the \nsanctity of the neighborhood. He was in such a good mood that he didn’t even notice \nthe strange emptines of the streets. An old reflex simply chalked it up to the perpetual \nhostility most residents displayed as a natural defense mechanism. It was such an \ningrained instinct, in fact, that he never even questioned why they would still have \nsuch an outlook when he had been helping make their neighborhood safe all this time. \nOld habits born from self-preservation died hard, and Michael didn’t begrudge the \nneighborhood people any of them. He actually whistled a little as he walked. \nEven when the first lookout bolted at the sight of him, he didn’t think too much \nof it. He simply focused his thoughts and followed the kid’s footsteps down a pair of \nalleys and side streets. The boy was obviously a green recruit; experienced lookouts \ndidn’t budge from their posts until absolutely certain they had been made. And most \nrelayed their messages by walkie talkie thesedays insteadofbywordofmouth. So when \nthe boy ducked through a network of rotting boards into a decaying brownstone, \nMichael didn’t hesitate to follow, convinced he’d ruin the night of agroup of huddled \npipeheads or, at most, a small-time dealer. He did notice that he passed the faded sign \nannouncing he was welcome to the Jackson Apartment building - \n“soon to be re- \nopened by the friendly community builders at New Horizon Enterprises” - \nbut that \nfactjustmadehimmoredeterminedandlescautious.Someverminhadactual1ymade \na nest in the very building Marsilio had just bought for renovations.

Brushing it aside, \nMichael managed only a handhlofadditional stepsbeforecoming to a thunderstruck \nhalt. His fists, raised high and ready, wavered, faltered and finally fell to his sides. \nThere were renovations going on inside this building all right, but not any \nMichael suspected would be on any construction invoice. The downstairs \ndividing walls had been ripped away to create one large common room that was \nnow alight with dozens of tiny red candles. The candles cast shadows in a shifting \nphantasmagoria around the room, and a black altar stood at the far end, flanked \nby two tall poles stylized to resemble giant, golden serpents. \nDozens ofpeople knelt in rows before the altar, dressed in simple white robes \nintermittently streaked with red.

Even the junkie boy he had saved from muggers less than a week \nago peered at him with bored anticipation. Their faces were blankly curious, like \nchildren teasing animals at the zoo. \nOther people were arrayed around the kneeling crowd, seemingly watching \nthem. These individuals wore sickly green robes with gold trim, and each had a \nhood drawn down to hide his face. It was behind one of these latter types that \nthe lookout was cowering. The figure advanced on him slowly, and his nearness \nfinally roused Michael from his stunned fugue. \n“What the hell is going on?” he yelled, raising his arms defensively but \nfeeling his words fall oddly flat even as he let them fly. “What do you think you’re \ndoing to these people?” \nThe figure before him said nothing in response. He only raised his hands and \nlet his hood fall limply back. Michael felt his reaction like a punch to the gut; \nPat’s face stared expressionlessly at him, still touched by the signs of life but pale \nas a dying junkie’s and utterly calm. A spot of fresh blood lay on the comer of \nhis mouth, and he licked his lips, obviously savoring the taste. When the others \nremoved their hoods as well, Michael saw the faces of his former Angel \ncomrades. They surrounded him like a damned Greek chorus. \n“How?” was all he could manage, looking at the familiar faces and wonder- \ning whether this nightmare would dissolve into wakefulness soon. \n“This neighborhood needed a new beginning,” another voice said. It came from \nacross the room, from yet another hooded figure perched behind the altar like some \ndemented caricature of a televangelist. The room’s - \nthe mpk’s - \nacoustics \ndistorted the voice into an oddly echoing bass that Michael had never heard before. \n“These people were going nowhere. They live in decaying buildings, \ndestroying themselves with drink and drugs, allowing gangs to rule them like \nfeudal lords. It was time for a change, and thanks to the tireless efforts of you and \nyour friends, they finally got one.” Silence reigned for just a fraction of asecond, \nbut in that time, Michael could swear he felt the darkness smile. \n“NOW their streets are cleared of scum and crime, their buildings are being \nrenovated, andtheirbodiesgrowstrongon \nthe offerings Igive them. Only the most \nfoolhardy would dare to intrude on this territory after your.. . examples.

It’s not \nso much to ask after all that we’ve done for them, don’t you think?” \nMichael stood still, unable to think, let alone respond. \n“So come join us, Michael. You’re due for a promotion, if anything, and \nyou’ve been such a help so far, it would be a shame to have to release you now.” \nThe figure gestured, and Michael felt the tug in his blood drawing him near. One \nlast pause, one that set his teeth on edge, ready to loose a scream. “No secrets \nanymore, right, Michael?” But Michael didn’t look as the figure pulled back his \nhood. Michael didn’t need to see the figure behind the altar to know who it was. \nHe had already recognized the ring on his finger. \nt \ni \nMIND’S Erg THFATBF \nJOUBNAL \n"

However, conservation ofspace \n(and trees) often forb& us from doing so. With the advent of the Journal, \nhowever, we can - \nas the back cover proclaims - \npick up where our other \nbooks leave off. In this article, we take a look at some of the m e  \nunusual shen \nwho didn’t make it into Laws of the East. \nD H A M P Y R S  \nC H I L D R E N O Z T H I  LIVINC~ \nDEATH \nWhile such an event is rare, the union of a Kuei-jin and a mortal sometimes \nprcduces a child. Born of work both living and dead, these beings grow up with a \nmeasure of the blessings Heaven has conferred upon their vampiric parent.. . as well \nas a touch of the curse. Known as dhampyrs, these creatures typically grow up in a \nshadowy worldbetween theeveryday ltfeof their mortalparent andthesavage splendor \nof the courts of the Kuei-jin, fully accepted by neither. Their long life spans, touch of \nsupernatural power and residual evil of the P’o withii set them apart from ordinary \nmortals from a relatively early age. And yet, the Kuei-jin view them as vastly lesser \nbeings and seldom take notice of them except to exploit their daylight capabilities. \nFurthermore, when one or more parents isn’t available during the daytime \nand has a good chance of tearing apart a friend or playmate from time to time, \ndhampyrs tend to grow up in a bizarre environment simultaneously filled with \nintense fear and overpowering love. Such a polarized upbringing is hard on \ndhampyrs, and many of them only become more bitter as time goes on. They \nwatch their mortal friends age and die before their eyes, and they turn away from \nall emotions in hopes of finding some means of stemming the pain of the loss. \nMost dhampyrs do not wish to take part in the games of the Kuei-jin, but after \nthey witness the dissolution of everything mortal they once knew, they take \ntheir place in the courts. They realize that the immortal plots of the vampires are \nthe only constant they can ever expect to last. \nFor their part, the Kuei-j in often employ capable dhampyrs as servants, spies \nand even assassins. (A killer who walks the day has a real advantage over \nvampires!) They even grant some dhampyrs the title of heimin both as \nrecognition for their service and a means of calling on them for aid. Like their \ncounterparts in the West, the ghouls and revenants, dhampyrs often exist in the \nshadow of their more powerful relatives. Yet, unlike the pathetic lap dogs of the \nKin-jin, a dhampyr who comes of age needs not rely on any undead patron to \nsecure her destiny; she is free to walk her own path. \n(At least in theory. Some Kuei-jin seek the creation of dhampyr children \nfor just such daylight services, and they have strong opinions about letting their \nprogeny simply walk away from them!) \n"

No matter how well they may \nthink the Kuei-jin esteem them, all dhampyrs must remember that their position is \never a hair’s breadth from disaster. The Kuei-jin are notoriously unforgiving, \nespecially with those they consider to literally embody the concept of “half-person.” \nIt’s no wonder, then, that many Shade Walkers strike out on their own in some \nform or another, selling their services to the highest bidder or even simply seeking to \nfind the solution to the problems raised by their unique state. In many ways, dhampyrs \nfind themselves in analogous situations to children of extremely wealthy means. They \nare distanced from most ordinary folks by the very circumstances of their birth, and yet, \nthey must also deal with “parents” who have little consideration for the their own \nambitions and dreams. Indeed, conceived as mere tools, dhampyrs must struggle hard \nto establish themselves and their own identity away from the courts. They must learn \nhow to cope with passion when almost everything they see around them is fleetmg. \nThey must manage the powers they have without encouraging the Demon to new \nheights of evil. It is a constant struggle just figuring out how to place themselves m a \nworld that always seem to be either moving too quickly or too slowly for them. \n(Andbefore anyone asks, no, there havenever beenanydhampyr Shih, and there \nnever should be unless the Storyteller is in the mood to add a ridiculously powerful and \noverly cinematic character to the game. For those still interested, the screening \nprocesses of SFO would detect a dhampyr early on, which would mean a short trip to \nthe vivisection chamber for the unfortunate Shade Walker caught in their clutches.) \nHowever, for players seeking a change of pace or who wish to explore some \nof the dark alleys and hidden places of the Kuei-jin world, dhampyrs present an \ninteresting dimension to any Laws of the East game. \nFor more on dhampyrs and their relations to the Kuei-jin, see the Kindred \nof the East Companion. \nDHAMPYR \nCHARACTER \nCREATION \nDhampyrs should use the rules for creating mortals found in Laws of the \nHunt, with the following alterations: \nDhampyr characters receive 7/5/3 for their starting Attributes; the blood \nof the immortals within them makes them slightly stronger than most beings. \nDhampyrs may have a maximum of 10 Traits in an Attribute category. \nDhampyrs receive one level of a Kuei-jin Discipline, provided it is a Shintai \nDiscipline or Demon Art (the other Disciplines are beyond their ken). They may \nlearn Disciplines during play at double the usual cost. A dhampyr’s age in centuries \ndetermines how many levels of a single Discipline he can possess (round up). \nTherefore, a 269-year-old dhampyr may leamup to three levels of a given Discipline. \nDhampyrs must choose normal Virtues (Courage, Self-Control, etc.), and \nthey do not have a Dharma rating - \nthey possess Humanity instead. (See Laws of \nthe Night for details on these Virtues.) When it comes to determining things like \neffective Chi Virtue ratings and how much Chi they may access and so on, use the \nsame rules for Chi expenditure as given for Shih and SFO agents in Laws of the East. \nDhampyrs begin play with one P’o Trait. Their Demons are not awakened \nas are those of the Kuei-jin, and they cannot initiate shadow soul. Theirs is more \nof a barely noticeable urge toward monstrosity. Dhampyrs may access Demon \n"

Any time the character loses his last Humanity \nTrait from committing an evil act, she gains a P’o Trait along with the standard \nderangement. A dhampyr can have no more Humanity Traits than five minus \nher Po rating, so those who slide into monstrosity rarely regain much human \nempathy. Dhampyrs with three or more P‘o return as Kuei-jin when they die. \nDhampyrs cannot access Kuei-jin powers such as Ghostsight or Lifesight. They \nare not truly reborn souls in dead flesh, but half-living, half-dead beings. However, \nDhampyrs may use their Chi to heal themselves in the same manner as Kuei-jin, at \na rate of one health level of lethal or two health levels of bashing damage per Chi \nTrait. Dhampyrs require normal mortal amounts of food, drink, sleep, etc., although \nthe need for these things can be staved off for a day with the expenditure of a Chi \nTrait. Dhampyrs also do not suffer from Chi imbalance as Kuei-jindo, although they \nmay certainly become imbalanced as the result of supernatural manipulation. \nDhampyrs regain Chi normally, as mortals do. They may also regain Chi by \neating flesh (they lack the enlightenment necessary to gain sustenance from blood \nor breath). Each health level offers one Trait of Chi. Of course, gaining Chi in this \nfashion is sure to provoke a Conscience test in all but the most depraved of dhampyrs. \nDhampyrs are hardy creatures. Once they mature, they effectively age at \na rate of one year for every 10 years that pass. Furthermore, dhampyrs are more \ndifficult to kill than normal mortals. Not only can they heal themselves with \ntheir Chi, but dhampyrs’ players may also make a Static Physical Challenge \nagainst six Traits whenever their characters are reduced below Incapacitated by \nlethal damage (aggravated still kills normally). If successful, the dhampyr \neffectively hovers at the brink of death for one scenehour, during which time \nhe appears dead to all normal and supernatural probing (thus typically fooling \nhis attackers into believing they’ve destroyed him). At the end of this time, the \ndhampyr may begin spending Chi to heal normally. If no Chi is available, the \ncharacter is considered Incapacitated, and must heal normally (i.e., very slowly). \nYU \nLAN-J I N \nWHIRLWINDS \nO P  TATTERED \nBODIES \nNot all souls survive the Road Back with the same resilience that the Kuei-jin \ndo. The lacerating winds of Hell cripple some souls, and those souls have trouble \nholding on to their mortal forms when they return to the Middle Kingdom. These \nunfortunates must leap from body to body constantly as they try in vain to hold onto \nsome sense of identity. Yulan-jin - \nor Soul Jumpers as the younger Kuei-jin call \nthem - \nare tragic creatures indeed, for the ceaseless transition between bodies \nmakes Dharmic advancement next to impossible, dooming most of these poor souls \nto a brief, confused stay in the Middle Kingdom before sliding back to Yomi once \nmore. It takes a truly determined and focused soul to make any kind of unlife out of \nsuch difficult circumstances, and many more Yulan-jin slip back into Yomi than \nremain. However, those Yulan-jin that somehow manage to curb their constant \nwandering become some of the most focusedsoulsunder Heaven, determined as they \nare to battle off the might of Hell itself to retain their identity. \nAs if their unlives weren’t difficult enough already, Kuei-jin society rejects \nthose Soul Jumpers it uncovers.

Of course, \na Yulan-jin is essentially identical to a Kuei-jin in the beginning, and some are \neven inducted into a court or a wu. At their first “death,” however, the vampire’s \ntrue nature becomes apparent. Instead of hovering near the body during the Little \nDeath, theYulan-jin’ssoulwhisksoff \ninsearchofanothercorpse to inhabit. Yulan- \njin are thus forced to live alone or in small communities of their own kind. Most \nSoul Jumpers adopt a single name that they retain from lifetime to lifetime (often \nprefaced with “Yulan” so that it can be distinguished from a Kuei-jin - \n“Yulan+ \nLei” or “Yulan-Wang,” for example). This practice is often their only means of \nretaining some sense of identity, for they may awaken in a new body hundreds of \nmiles from friends and allies each time they ‘‘pass on,” and material possessions \ndon’t accompany the change. Thus, Yulan-jin seldom form lasting attachments, \nand they deal with each other on the basis of reputation. Those who accomplish \ngreat deeds or hold onto their forms for a long time are accorded much respect. \nSince their constant body-shifting can pose intense demands on a Storyteller \n(who wants to have a character who drops in wearing a different face every few \nsessions and who sometimes must come from a hundred miles away or more?), \nplayers should secure permission before creating Yulan-jin characters. They \nshould also be aware that while it is possible for some of these vampires to rise to \ngreat station and standing, it’s far more likely that they will have a much shorter \nstay in the Middle Kingdom than normal Kuei-jin. If playing this kind of tragic \ncharacter suits them, then fine, but if they’re not comfortable with the long odds \nstacked against them, perhaps they’re better off playing another type of character. \nYULAN-JIN \nCHARACTER \nCREATION \nYulan-jin are created and played identically to regular Kuei-jin, with the \nfollowing alterations: \nYulan-jin start with one fewer Willpower Traits than normal Kuei-jin, a \nmark of the terrible damage done by the lacerating winds of Yomi. \nYulan-jin may have any Dharma, although they seldom progress very far. \nAsanote, theseKuei-jindon’ttend todowellevenwith theThousand Whispers \nDharma. That path requires that a life be studied until everything possible has \nbeen learned from it, and Yulan-jin are frequently forced to discard an identity \nbefore learning everything they can. \nBody swapping - \nA Yulan-jin is forced to leave her current body from \ntime to time. During such times, her soul is forced to endure the torment of Yomi \nfor days or even weeks until another suitable body has been found to host the \nspirit. (Storytellers are encouraged to describe such periods, if not actually \nroleplay them out with the player.) Once the Yulan-jin leaves the body, it \nimmediately becomes entirely dead and decays as appropriate for a corpse of its \nage. A Soul Jumper passes on whenever any of the following conditions occur: \nTemporary Willpower is reduced to zero \nTemporary Chi of either type is completely exhausted \nShe suffers torpor.

Success means the character suffers some disorien- \ntation but is otherwise all right. Failure means the character suffers more severe \namnesia (only the barest details remain clear) and must remove one Ability level \npermanently. In addition, players who fail must immediately win or tie a Simple \nTest. Failing this test means the character loses a permanent Willpower Trait as \nher soul frays even further from the stress of the change. Characters reduced to zero \nWillpower this way pass into Yomi for good, the soul dissipating in the winds of \nHell. All guunxi previously established are also broken on assuming a new body. \nYulan-jin lose a Dharma Trait automatically when they pass on, which \nmakes it difficult to hold on to enlightenment for any period of time. Yulan-jin \nwho pass on with no Dharma Traits are blasted back to Yomi permanently. \nIt should be noted that while the player of the Yulan-jin must still make \nsure other players know of any differences in their character’s appearance as they \nmove from body to body, the vampire’s soul seldom chooses a body radically \ndifferent from its original. Therefore, unless the Storyteller rules otherwise, \nYulan-jin do not change Attributes, Attribute totals or Abilities when they shift \nbodies. They may look different, but it’s the same soul within. \nYulan-j in are normally indistinguishable from regular Kuei-jin, unless one \nwitnesses them pass on (watching their soul flee), or successfully uses one of the \nfollowing Disciplines on them: the Cultivation Discipline of Scrutinixe, the Obliga- \ntion Discipline of Soul Bridge or the Chi’iu Muh power Pu~$~atiun. \nNote that the \ncharacter may not know exactly what he’s looking at unless he possesses a few \nlevels of the Occult Ability.

She’s been developing Mind’s Eye Theatre for \nmore than a year now, and she’s been playing Mind’s Eye Theatre since she \nstarted working for White Wolf in 1994. She’s one of the resident JARPing \nexperts in house here, and as an observer of the dynamics of live-action \nrokplaying society, she is without peer. \nDEAL IN^ WITH CHARACTER \nDEATH \nIt’s only natural that when you engage in something that has you figura- \ntively climbing into the skin of another person, you get attached to that person. \nLikewise, when you’re spending a great deal of time and energy on something \nthat’s a close part of your life, you get used to that activity as part of the order of \nthings. Therefore, when a character dies, it can throw you for a real loop. Some \nplayers grouse, but they go fetch out the back-up character they created for just \nsuch an emergency. Some leave the site in a rage to find a beer to bitch into and \na computer by which to spread the news. Very rarely, some are not sorry to see \nthe character go at all. Maybe they weren’t crazy about some aspects that \ndeveloped over time, and the death was a neat exeunt into the final night. And \nthen there are those folks for whom the event is a wallop upside the head that \nleaves them floundering around trying to figure out what happened. \nR I 9 H T WAY \ns \nThe first thing to remember is that the death of a character isn’t the end of \nthe world. All stories end. Some take longer roads than others, but eventually, \nthe tale comes to an end. Still, if you’ve had a long run with a character, or you’re \nparticularly fond of it, a sudden end of the road can be hard. So what should you \ndo? Here are some ideas to grab onto during those first few days: \nTake some time off. Consider taking a break to just chill out and rediscover \nthose hobbies you enjoy when you’re not LARPing. As that favorite button \nslogan goes, sometimes death is Nature’s way of telling you to slow down. You \nmay find this advice helpful to give yourself a little distance in creating a new \ncharacter or to ensure that you don’t gravitate automatically toward your old \ncharacter’s former allies and friends. If you want to keep playing, consider \nseeking out a different venue to get your “fix.” \nDo a 180 in your next character. Consider death a new beginning when \ncreating your next character. If you played a combat-active former Navy SEAL, \ntry playing a scholar who gets green at the mere idea of a fight. If you previously \nthrew all your energy at a Vampire chronicle, redirect it toward Changeling. At \nthe very least, such a change-up ensures that you won’t be mistaken for your old \ncharacter. You’ve got a clean slate - \nmake the most of it. \nT T ~  \nyour hand at storytelling. So you want to take some time off from playing, \nbut you don’t want to sit at home in front of the tube or the computer? Maybe this \n"

If you \never had a gripe about how things ran, now is the time to do something about it. \nFind closure. Finding a way to gently draw the curtain on something you \nwere close to is tough. You may attend your character’s funeral (very surrepti- \ntiously, of course). You may vent throughvarious mediums, like art or sports. You \nmay pause to consider your own mortality. You may feel weepy when you hear \na song you associated with your character. You may bawl through your favorite \nmovie while devouring a whole box of chocolates. There’s no real wrong way to \nfind closure, provided you approach it with maturity. \nRealize it’s not the end of the world. The world won’t stop turning because \nCount Marmaduke came to an unfortunate demise at the end of an assassin’s cold \niron knife or your Silver Fang Ahroun went down while fighting a Thunderwyrm. \nTheneat thing about storytelling games is that when one runs out, there are always \nmore waiting. There will always be more games to play and stories to tell. \nW R O N g  W A Y S  \nNow, of course, for every right way to do things, there exists a wrong way \nto do them. Losing characters does sometimes seem to cause people to lose their \nheads and do things that they might find reprehensible in other circumstances. \nSo, while I’m not saying that you would rush off and do something so silly, it’s \ngood to remember what are the wrong things to do: \nCreate a new character exactly like the old one. Oh, come on now. If you’re \ngoing to do that, then why are you reading this? Doing this sort of thing gets you \nresponses like, “Get over it.” Sequels that are just a rehash of the first story get \nsneered at. Don’t be a sequel. Only rarely are they as good as the original. \nCome in with a vendetta against your old character’s killers. Creating a \ncharacter who’s the relative of your late character and whose only purpose is to \nkill off the ones who screwed your original character over the first time is a \nhallmark of the sore loser and the immature player. Should you have a m e  \ngrievance, take it to the proper authority and let vengeance be the Storyteller’s. \nThrow a tantrum. To put it bluntly, throwing a tantrum is immature. \nWe’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again - \nwhen you play this game, you decide \nwhat risks to accept or decline. If you don’t like the odds, don’t play. It’s that \nsimple. If your character takes the risk of becoming an infemalist and doesn’t \ncover his tracks while he busily destroys lives, then few people are going to have \nmuch sympathy for you when your character is hunted down like a dog. You took \nthe risk; accept the consequences gracefully. Words spoken in anger, particu- \nlarly threats and curses, can last for a lot longer than anger itself, and they will \ncertainly impact your return to the game. \nSTOBYTFLLEBS \nNow what if you’re a Storyteller on the “other side of the fence,” as it were? \nSome circumstances come up that the books just can’t tell you about because we \ncan’t guess at all the experiences you’ll run into. Consider these words to be like \nthe ones that all funeral-home directors have: \nBe prepared to see the player vanish for a while. Unwelcome memories can \nbe burdensome in the midst of a game, and she may not want to deal with things \nTHE M O U B N I N ~  \nAPTER \n"

      "text": "for a while. Give her some space, and don’t demand she return to the game. Just \nlet her know she’s welcome when she’s ready. \nBe prepared to listen to some venting. When a player’s character dies, you’ll \nprobably hear some griping about the unfairness of it all - \nit’s a given. When \nthings devolve into tantrums and other unpleasantness, however, put your foot \ndown and don’t give it any more credence. \nMake sure everything is on the level. If there’s evidence that character death \nwas brought about solely due to cheating, out-of-character knowledge or dislike \nof the player, you’ve got a problem. While you may not be able to bring the lost \ncharacter back, you can ensure that justice is done. \nDon’t be mean. Admit it - \nwe’ve all had those characters or players who \nhave been thorns in our sides, and we find ourselves hoping that said character \nwill go away (and take the player with him). Should you have such a player, then \ndon’t celebrate when the day comes. There are still people who are unhappy \nabout the event, and gloating about it just makes you look like a weasel. \nMEMENTO \nMORI \nOne of the biggest fears of death is that we will be forgotten by the living \nonce we are no longer around to assert our presence. It’s part of why we erect \ngravestones and monuments, to ensure against such an outcome. Legacies of one \nsort or another are a possible way to cheat Death. Many a building has been built, \na library founded or a patronage made to ensure that someone’s name was not \nforgotten. This tradition isn’t limited to the real-life living. \nConsider having a character write a will at some point, perhaps with the idea \nthat he’s providing for his dependents (be they ghouls, childlings, Kinfolk etc.) or \nseeing that his resources and possessions are disposed of properly. Check with your \nStoryteller to see ifshe will allow Backgrounds 1ikeResources to be distributed. The \nlast requests of a will (“Bury my ashes in Poland,” “Make sure my daughter can \nfinish school”) could send characters into the arms of new plot while carrying out \nthe late character’s wishes or provide some exciting roleplaying opportunities. \nWhat if someone contests the will, or your character chooses an unlikely executor \nthat many disagree with (a Fianna entrusts her will to a Bone Gnawer)? The \nresulting plot will have the recipients certainly thinking about your late character, \nalthough whether it’s to take his name in vain or to praise him is another matter. \nLet the Storyteller know that should your character be declared dead, there’s a \nlawyer or lawyer-type with a letter for someone, which may be interesting in and \nof itself if a character has a public persona you weren’t aware of. \nAnother ideaistoleavedocumentsinasecretcacheforsomeluckyplayer.Examp1es \nof such might be the letters a Nosferatu was writing to the Tremere he loved from afar \n(which give some hints about his impending death), a set of very spiritual Gaia poems \ncreatedby aKinfolk (which give someobservations that prick thesept’science alittle \ntoo fiercely) or an eshu’s travel journal written in Farsi (complete with comments \nregarding other courts). Uncovered documents can be fodder for smaller, more personal \nplot lines. (Who might the documents embarrass, or what secrets will they reveal?) \nAgain, it takes pre-planning. Start workmg on such thingsw, even if you don’t thmk \nthat your character’s in trouble. Once your character passes on, give the phys-reps to the \nStoryteller and give her the complete scoop on where the items are so she knows what \nto do when someone finds the secret pasage or discovers the magic box. \n"

      "text": "Another option that some might look at is to become a wraith. Depending \non the character, this progression could be an entirely natural. Vampires who \ndidn’t reach Golconda, mortals, Kinfolk, kinain and ghouls are all likely \ncandidates for the Underworld, but remember that the souls of werewolves, \nchangelings and mages get “recycled” for later generations. This transformation \nmay lead into interactions with the Giovanni, sluagh or other speakers with the \ndead. One interesting example of such a change was of a mortal nun who was \nmurdered by the Inquisition and became a wraith. Rather than haunt her killers, \nshe chose to watch over several vampires she had known while she lived, \nencouraging them to maintain their Humanity and becoming a sort of guardian \nangel. Later, she became a Storyteller vehicle to introduce a new plot that had \nties to the Underworld. Just make sure that your character’s transformation into \na wraith is not an excuse to make other players miserable. It’s one thing for a \nwraith to have the Passion of haunting her murderer, but it’s another altogether \nto harangue a player non-stop throughout the evening. Such errant ones should \nbe rewarded with frisky Shadows or a quick trip into the Maelstrom. \nLastly, remember that talk is free, and it costs you no actions during combat \n(unless you’re reduced to unconsciousnw or torpor). The final farewells to one’s \nbeloved, the gasped-out confessions, the curses made with dying breath and the need \nfor forgiveness before death are the moments that high drama is made of. From the \nmost famous lines (“It is finished”) to the not-quite as famous ones (“Friends, \napplaud! The comedy is over.”), last words place your character in the annals of the \ngame memory. If your character has a sadistic streak, you could choose to make your \npassing even more memorable by revealing a secret that affects those left behind. A \nprime example occurs in Tolkien’s Silmmillion, where the dying dragon Glaurung \ninforms the maiden Niniel that her husband Turambar (who is Glaurung’s slayer) \nis in fact the brother who was separated from her as a child. Tender or terrible, last \nwords can make a vivid final impression on the survivors. \nDeath in LARP is pretty unavoidable unless your character chooses to hide \nunder arock indefinitely. Eventually, it will find him in some form, whether it’s \nhis own or a valued comrade’s. When staring down its barrel, remember the \nwords of one pragmatist: “Who wants to live forever, anyway?” \nIn pace requiescat. \n"

For those of you who are new to the publication, let me take a \nsecond to acquaint you with just what you’ve got here. (For those of you \nwho already know, you may skip ahead to The Current Thinking.) \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gaps \nin your White Wolf LARP environment. We offer rules for new charac- \nter types, original story lines to work into your chronicles, guides for \nkeeping your games under control and running smoothly and rules \nupdates you won’t find in any other Mind’s Eye release. Plus, you’ll find \nanswers to the questions that have plagued you, original World of \nDarkness fiction and columns from people who’ve been LARPing or \nworking here at White Wolf (or both) for years. \nIn this issue, we finish taking a look at the wraithly environment of the \nGreat War era, including rulesfor Maelstromeffects and making Momvights \nplayable characters. You’ll also find advice from the Mind’s Eye Theatre \nline developer and rules for creating Yulan-]in and Dhamphyr characters \nfor your Laws of the East chronicle. And that’s just a sample of what’s in \nstore for you here. We’ll also take a look at what you’ve missed in previous \nissues (if you’re joining us late) and what to expect in the future ofMind’s \nEye Theatre and White Wolf in general. \nIn future issues of the Journal, we’ll present some more of the \nmaterial that had to be left out of Laws of the East, tips on acting and \nsome expanded information on the hideous fomori. \nAnd you can help make the Journal even better. Send us letters on \nyour opinions about the state of live-action roleplaying today. Send us \nquestions about the features and rules you see here, as well as notes about \nthe broken rules you come across in different MET publications. Send us \nhorror stories about games gone wrong and how your player characters \nfixed them. We’re interested in all aspects of live-action roleplaying, and \nwe want to know what you think. \nStick around. The Journal is on the cutting edge of the live-action \ngenre; we’ve got something for everybody. And if we don’t have it yet, let \nus know. We’ll get it for you. \nCurl Bowen, Developer \ncurl@white-wolf. corn \nWhite Wolf \nAttn: Mind’s Eye Theatre Journal Developer \n735 Park North Blvd, Suite 128 \nClarkston, GA 30021 \nUSA \n\n\nTHF CURRFNT T H I N K I N 9  \nIt hasn’t been long since the revised edition of Laws of \nthe Night has hit the shelves, and already the deluge has \nbegun! So, in the interests of world peace (or at least, peace \nin your game), here are the answers to some questions that \nhave started cropping up. \nQ: I don’t like the new Virtue system, where vampires can be sent to \nfrenzy just by lighting a cigarette. What can I do about this? \nA: First, remember that any stimulus under the vampire’s control doesn’t \ncause a Virtue Test. Therefore, you needn’t make a Courage test just to light your \nown cigarette or throw a Flame Bolt. \nSecond, the circumstances for Virtue Tests are determined by the Narrator \nor Storyteller. A player can call for his character to make a Virtue Test if he thinks \nthat his character would be affected by a situation (testing for frenzy due to an \ninsult, for example), which is recommended as good roleplaying. It’s up to \nNarrators to keep players honest if some big-time scene breaks out, such as pillars \nof flame landing in your character’s yard. Of course, chances are good that there’s \nalready a Narrator on hand if there are pillars of flame landing in your yard.. . . \nLast, if you think that it’s just too easy for vampires to lose control, and your \ngame has degenerated into a mass of screaming, frenzied Cainites, you can strip \nout the stimuli for one- and two-Trait Self-Control/ Instinct and Courage Virtue \nTests. Therefore, characters will only frenzy when something really egregious \ncomes up. This mechanic does numb the “personal horror” angle of Vampire a \nbit, so be careful with it. Under such a system, vampires will be likely to frenzy \nor enter Rotschrek only when they face direct sunlight, starvation and the sight \nof blood, or actual fire damage. It’s important to make sure that the Morality \nscales stay intact just to keep people honest to their Humanity/ Path rating. \nQ I noticed that characters never suffer a loss of Virtue Traie under the system \npresented. What should I do if a player is buying up his hcience/- \nSelf- \ncontrdl Instiwt and Courage to maximum levels, since they never drop? \nA: At his or her discretion, the Storyteller may always choose to strip a \ncharacter of a Virtue Trait for particularly severe events. A vampire who suffers \ntoo many shattering defeats of his Courage may lose a Courage Trait perma- \nnently. This loss is part and parcel of the degeneration into inhumanity and the \nfight with the Beast. However, losing Virtue Traits is not acommon event, since \nit can easily wreck characters rapidly if it occurs too often. At the very least, a \nplayer should have to lose a Virtue Test, risk a retest and lose that as well before \nhaving the possibility of losing a permanent Virtue Trait. \nIf you do decide to strip a character’s Virtue Trait, then you probably shouldn’t \ninflict the temporary Derangement, just to keep the player from getting t o d y  \nhammered. Note that if a character is stripped down to having no Virtue Traits in \na given Virtue, then the player can’t even enter Virtue Challenges of that type. He \nsuffers the appropriate effects automatically. In such a case, the Derangement \nassigned should probably be permanent (although it could be overcome normally). \n\n\nWhen using the compressed scale, all Blood and Willpower Traits are halved \nfrom the normal scale. Thus, a thirteenth-generation vampire, who would \nnormally have 10 Blood Traits and two Willpower Traits, instead has five Blood \nTraits and one Willpower Trait. \nA couple of things to keep in mind with the compressed scale: First, all \nBlood Trait expenditures are also halved, rounded up. Thus, using the Feral \nChws Discipline, which normally costs one Blood Trait, still costs a single Blood \nTrait. Healing an aggravated wound costs two Blood Traits (half of three is one \nand a half, rounded up to two). Healing a normal wound still costs one Blood \nTrait. Waking up in the evening costs one Blood Trait. You get the idea. \nThe limits on expended Blood Traits are also halved in the compressed \nscale. Therefore, only an eighth or better generation vampire can spend more \nthan one Blood Trait in a turn. \nIf you use the compressed Blood/ Willpower scale, you should probably also \nuse a compressed Health scale. Under that system, all vampires have one level \neach of Healthy, Bruised, Wounded and Incapacitated, after which they’re in \ntorpor or they hit Final Death. Fortitude and Potence work normally, but all \nweapons only cause half damage, rounded up, in such a system. Therefore, most \nattacks do only a single level of damage. \nQ: How many Blood Traits do mortals have? \nA: A mortal has 10 Blood Traits under the normal blood system. Each one \nremoved causes a health level of lethal damage to the mortal (and yes, this injury \nwill kill a mortal before the individual completely runs out of blood). If you use \nthe compressed scale, then mortals have five Blood Traits, but each one lost still \ncauses one level of lethal damage. Remember that mortals take additional \ndamage when Giovanni vampires feed from them. \nGhouls have normal Blood Traits like humans, although they replace one of \ntheir human Blood Traits with a Trait of ghoul blood in order to become ghouls \nin the first place. This Trait of blood can power Disciplines and the like, although \nits use causes injury to the ghoul just as if the blood had been lost through other \nmeans. Ghouls can still be overfed; see Liber des Goules for ideas on giving aghoul \nextra blood to convert his human Blood Traits into ghoulish Blood Traits. \nQ: What are the relative strengths/ speeds/ endurance levels of the \nvarious levels of Celerity, Fortitude and Potence? \nA: Try this for comparison: \nPower level Celerity \nFortitude \nPotence \nBasic \nOutrun a bike Take a punch \nThrow a large television \nIntermediate I\nAdvanced \nOutrun a car Take a blowtorch Throw a small car \nOutrun a horse Take a baseball bat Throw a refrigerator \nQ: I’m having trouble with the Vanish from Mind’s Eye power of \nObfuscate. It’s cumbersome to test against everyone every time I want to say \na simple sentence! \nA: You always risk detection if you interact with your surroundings while \nObfuscated. If you need a simpler system, you can simply expend a Mental Trait \neach time you speak a full sentence while Obfuscated, as long as you have Vanish \n\n\nfrom Mind’s Eye or better. However, this system is up to the approval of your \nStoryteller, and it applies to everyone - \nincluding those pesky enemies you’ve \nbeen trying to catch. \nQ: The new limits on Thuumaturgy, particularly the Path of Bloal, seem \npretty restrictive. What can I do to make sure that Thaumuturgy still has utility? \nA: Thaumaturgy is a powerful Discipline, but its strength lies in its flexibiliry. \nIf you are really having aproblem with the fact that P o w  ofBlood is now limited \nso that a 13th generation vampire can’t pretend to be fifth, that Theft ofvitae can \nno longer rip away enough blood to keep a vampire from using Celerity or that \nCauldron of Blood can no longer kill someone in a single blow, you can always \nincrease or waive the limits on expenditures for Thaumaturgy. Don’t do so without \na careful look at the consequences across the game, though. Thaumaturgy should \nnot create a “one-shot kill” any more than any other power. Remember, too, that \nThaumaturgy ’s success in tabletop relies on the rolls of the player. AVampire: The \nMasquerade player cannot expect to automatically tear away 10 blood points from \nan individual, and the live-action version is no different. At most, we recommend \nan upper limit of five Traits on the various limited expenditures, unless you want \nthe Tremere to get really gross. (Cauldron of Blood in particular, with its aggravated \ndamage, can be extremely dangerous if misused.) \nQ: The example of breaking Obfuscate with Auspex is confusing. The \nexample in theObfuscate Discipline says a one-for-one Trait bonus to the \nhigher Discipline, but the description only gives two Traits for a character \nusing Vanish from Mind’s Eye against Heightened Senses, which would be a \ndifference of three levels. How should this work? \nA: You get a two-Trait bonus for eachpower class that exceeds your opponent’s. \nThat is, if you have the Intermediate power and your opponent has the Basic power, \nyou get two extra Traits against him. If you have the Advanced power and your \nopponent has the Basic power, you get four extra Traits. These Traits cannot be used \nfor bidding, but they can be used for resolving ties and for calculating overbids. \nQ: Now that Thuumaturgy and Necromunq rituals cost Experience \nTraits, what should I do with characters who already have lots of rituals? \nA: Don’t worry about it. You can always adjudicate that a character can \nlearn a ritual through hard effort and study with appropriate Influence. If you \nwant to be strict, you can charge such players a small fraction of their earned \nexperience (say, one point each month) until they’re “paid up.)’ If they complain \nabout it, point out that you’re not taking away all of their experience, and that \nthey have already had all of these rituals for free for some time. \nQ: The Thanatosis power of Withering makes it impossible to use \nCelerity, Fortitude and Potence if it strikes the head. Shouldn’t it affect \nMental Disciplines and not Physical ones? \nA: Whoops! That sentence should read “Doing so kills mortals instantly \nand causes vampires to suffer the Negative Traits Oblivious and Witless in \naddition to rendering them unable to use any Disciplines except Celerity, \nFortitude and Potence.” Note that a vampire with a withered head can still use \nother non-Discipline powers such as healing or boosting Physical Traits. \nQ: The Summun power is causing me problems. People are summoning \ntheir enemies from several miles away, and forcing them to travel during the \nday, killing them! What should I do? \n\n\nA: The Summon power dissipates at dawn at the victim’s location. Also, the \npower cannot place someone in a dangerous situation. A summoned individual will \ntake steps to avoid danger and mitigate risk, and the summoning is broken if there \nis no way to reach the summoner except through dangerous or fatal territory (such \nas walking through flame or traveling through gang territory alone and unarmed). \nQ: The suggested Ability retests don’t make sense for some of the \nDisciplines. Why would I use Leadership instead of Intimidation, for \ninstance, with Dread Gaze? \nA: At your Storyteller’s option, you can specify different Abilities for each \nDiscipline, but doing so gets nightmarishly complex and requires each player to \nremember exactly what Ability is used for a retest with each level of every \nDiscipline. If you do so, we recommend that you make up cards for the \nDisciplines, so that the players can remember what Ability is appropriate. In any \ncase, no Discipline should get aretest frommore than one Ability. You shouldn’t \nbe able to use Leadership or Intimidation with Dread Gaze, for instance. Use one \nor the other for all uses of the power. \nQ: Where are the Sabbat Paths of Enlightenment? Kiasyd? Children of \nOsiris? Ahrimanes? \nA: Later book. We only had so many pages. \nQ: The Disciplines section mentions “eight common Disciplines,” but \nonly lists seven. Which one is missing? \nQ: How do caitiff work in the new version? \nA: A caitiff picks three Disciplines as primary Disciplines. Unless the \nStoryteller says otherwise, these should come from the “common eight.” The \ncaitiff advances in these at “clan costs.” Caitiff cannot begin play with Status, \nand they generally are of very weak Generation. More information on caitiff will \nbe forthcoming in a later book. \nQ: How do I use other Mind’s Eye Theatre games with the new rules? \nA: If you use the compressed scales, your games should work just fine. Under \nsuch a system, everybody keeps the same health levels, and the relative balance \nof power is maintained. \nShould you use the full Blood/ Willpower/ Health scales, you’ll need to \naccommodate with the other games. Werewolves, changelings and mortals should \nuse the health level scales listed in the revised edition rules. (Wraiths always had \ntheir own Corpus scale, and it doesn’t change.) Their Trait ratings can stay the \nsame; a vampire with five Blood Traits is still in trouble when running into a \nwerewolf with four Rage Traits. Under this system, a werewolf heals one lethal or \nbashing health level of damage every h ~ r n  \nthat he’s not in a challenge. \nUse your best judgment when arbitrating the effects of powers. Razor Claws, \nfor instance, probably stays the same, but some of the higher-level Gifts might \nautomatically do two levels of damage in the full-scale system. \nQ: On page 11 1, time in involuntary torpor is measured in game sessions \nbased on Morality. On page 199, there’s a chart with concrete (generally \nlonger) times. Which is it? \nA: Use the chart on page 11 1 so that you can scale torpor times according \nto your own game’s schedule. \nT H E  \nCURRENT \nTHINKING \n\n\nQ: Willpower must be spent to attempt a challenge if you don’t have the \nappropriate Ability. Does this include challenges like Brawl and Melee? \nA: No; you only spend Willpower to attempt a challenge without the \nAbility if the Ability would normally be required for the action. You can always \nfire a gun, swing a sword or attempt a similar action. You can’t necessarily read \nSanskrit without the right training. \nQ: Under the Awareness Ability, it mentions usingretests for the Ability \nwith the Occult Ability. Why would someone retest an Ability with a \ndifferent Ability? \nA: This is probably a little unclear. When you use the Awareness Ability, \nyou’re sensitive to unusual supernatural things going on in your vicinity. However, \nyou may not actually know what they are without the Occult Ability. Thus, your \nAwareness may tell you that something magical just happened, but you’d need \nOccult Ability to recognize it as, say, Thaumaturgy if you didn’t actually see exactly \nwhat happened or weren’t familiar with the effect in question. \nQ: The Flaw Intolerance shows up under the example of character \ncreation on p. 129. Where is it? \nA: Technically, this Flaw no longer exists. However, the Storyteller may \nalways adjudicate the use of additional Merits and Flaws. \n\n\nDFADGUY SDFAKS \nJ \nI \nWHY \nI HAD \nEOUR MILLION \nM A ~ F  \nSUBMISSIONS \nIN MY OEEICE \nNow that Jess and Carl have opened the can of worms I spent four years trying to \nbury in ferroconcrete, I suppose that now is the best time possible to shed some light \non what some called the most enduring mystery of my tenure developing Mind’s Eye \nTheatre’. The most enduring one above and beyond, “Cripes, why did they give you \nthe job? Were there no trained lemurs available?” that is. \nNo, the one thing everyone wanted to know about my work on MET was, oddly \nenough, the whereabouts of the one book I never did tackle, a book that’s absence mandated \nthat MET would never be a letter-perfect translation of the tabletop World of Darkness. \nIn the chat rooms, on the newsgroups and forums, at conventions and in \ndisturbingly phrased phone messages left on my intermittently checked voice mail, the \nquestion was always the same: Where’s MET Magez? \nAfter all, it would seem like an obvious next book at any given juncture. All the other \nWorld of Darkness games had gotten their translations, even that icky Wraith thin$. \nWhy not Mage, which was more popular, and quite likely to sell rather well as a result? \nWhy was that rat bastard Dansky so intent on never, ever doing live-action Mage? \nWell, for the first time, you’re going to get the real, honest-to-Murgatroyd answer, \nright here in these pages. At last, the terrible secret that swallowed so many submissions \nis about to be revealed. The time for secrecy and discretion is over. You can learn the \ntruth now. You’re ready. \nThe truth is, soylent green is made of people. Oh, hang on, that’s not it. Sorry about that. \nThe real reason I never developed Laws of Magic (or Laws of Magick or Ascension \nor Laws of My God I Hope For Once in Their Bloody Lives Our Artists Don’t Feel \nCompelled to Turn in Shots of Bare Breasts for a Book with a Purple Cover, Because \nI Really Don’t Want to f i v e  to Try to Explain this One to the 700 Club and My \nMother) was always a very simple one. And it wasn’t one that anyone ever guessed. \nOh, sure, there were theories. There were guesses. There were cries of outrage4 \nabout how all of those umpty-gazillion live-action Mage players were being cruelly \nignored out of sheer spite5. In truth, I spent a not-so-brief period collecting various \nconspiracy and other theories as to why the book never got made. I heard that then- \nMage developer Phil Brucato refused to allow it. I heard that Phil wanted to develop \nit and that I wouldn’t let him. I heard that people at White Wolf knew that various folks \nof the neo-pagan persuasion would curse us if the book ever saw print and that we were \ndetermined to save our own skins by killing the book. I heard that various branches of \nthe Religious Right were getting ready to march on the White Wolf offices like extras \n\n\nfrom Young Frankenstein, waving their torches and demanding that the book be burned. \nI even heard from one sadly deluded chap who dug up a fossilized April Fools’ Day post \nwherein I promised live-action tantric sex rules for Mage, complete with a bound \nParadox spirit and one pair of edible undies6. The poor guy thought that I was A) serious \nand B) about to run afoul of various federal statutes by doing so. \nIn short, I heard every possible reason for my refusal to produce Laws of the Purple \nCover on demand short of someone insisting that the Secret Masters had forbidden me \nto do so. After all, with all of those compelling reasons (or “REA$ON$7” as some not- \nterribly-clever folks felt the need to phrase it) to do the book, there had to be some \nhorrible secret behind the fact that it wasn’t seeing print. \nNow, to their eternal credit, some folks out there decided to put their money where \ntheir collective mouth (and good Lord, isn’t that an image out of Bosch?) was, and submit \nproposals for rules sets for MET Mage. Sending in a submission to a publisher is a work of \nutmost bravery, and I have respect for anyone who dares to attempt it. After all, it’s one thing \nto have your friends tell you how great your ideas are or your game is, but it’s quite another \nto put it out there under the cold, critical eye of someone who doesn’t know you from Adam \n(and who has absolutely no compunctions about telling you that the 400-page submission \nyou’ve spent two years cobbling together is Not Good Enough). It’s hard, putting your work \nout where you can’t be there to shepherd it, to smooth over the rough spots and explain the \nplaces where you might have been unclear. Once you put the manuscript in the envelope, \nit’s out of your hands. It stands or falls on its own merits, and it goes before a judge as \nlegendarily harsh as Minos or Rhadamanthus - \nthe developer. It takes a lot of courage to \nsubmit your work to an impartial judging from someone who is bound to be -because of \ntime constraints, if nothing else - \nswift, merciless and impartial. Furthermore, by \nsubmitting your work, you’re implicitly accepting the responsibility of writing the book \nshould your proposal be accepted, and as any professional writer can tell you, writing to \ndeadline is hard, intense labo?. So those people who sent in proposals for their particular \nversions of MET Mage did and still do have my respect for making that attempt. \nAnd so, the submissions came rolling in. Some were done in the format I’d \nrequested a hundred times-cover \nletter, outline, writing sample, SASE-while \nsome \nwere complete manuscripts the size of the latest Clive Barker literary Dagwood. Some \nwere incredibly professional, while others lacked basics like SASEs and cover letters or \nhadn’t been proofread. Some were very good, some, well, weren’t. A couple approached \nexcellence. But every single one got rejected, put in the pile and turned over to my \nsuccessors for their perusal when the time came to hand off the reins. \nWhy? \nThe answer to this long-running conundrum is, unfortunately, a blunt one. In so \nmany words, none of them worked, and after certain incidents early in my tenure as MET \ndeveloper, I swore that I was never going to let a book that didn’t work - \nthat would \ndestroy moregames than itwouldcreate-out withmynameonit9.Andsoas eachMET \nMage submission came in, I dutifully unwrapped it, read it and then broke it. \nBroke the rules, that is. Found ways in which the particular rules set could be contorted \nuntil it cried for its mama, and game-play went out the window. Then the submission would \nget put on the ferry to the Island of Misfit Toys, or more accurately, on top of the towering, \nteetering stack of unsuccessful Mage MET proposals, and wait for the next one to come along. \nUnfortunately, most of the submissions came in sharing one fatal flaw - \nthe \nassumption that since this particular batch of rules worked with a local group, it would \nwork, period. Sadly, that was never the case. \n\n\nThe three main pitfalls of doing MET Mage were always playability, faithfulness and \nbalance. The first was exemplified by the dreaded “I Brutally assault you/ I Wisely teleport \nto Saturn” dilemma. To do Mage properly was to invite all sorts of incidents, transforma- \ntions, teleportations and so on that the imagination was better suited to handle than the \nlive-action arenalo. If a proposal turned Mage loose in all of its wild, rambunctious glory, \nall Hell would no doubt break loose five minutes into the first session as characters turned \nother characters into lawn furniture, jaunted around the various levels of reality and \notherwise made the Storyteller’s life something out of Dante’s best book. \nFurthermore, there was always the matter of Paradox. Assigning it correctly would \ncall for far too many Narrators - \na one-to-one player/ staff ratio would have been \noptimal - \nlest players get away with vulgar murder (and magic) when no one was \nlooking. On the flip side, some proposals did away with Paradox entirely as being too \nmuch trouble. These rules systems promised utter chaos. They also made rude gestures \nin the general direction of faithfulness, the second major hurdle any proposal would \nhave to get across. After all, Mage without Paradox isn’t Mage. It’s a mid-period \nAvengers comic, with the pillars of heaven shaking on a regular basis because there isn’t \nanything in place to keep them from doing so. \nOther proposals abandoned Spheres in favor of making an entirely rote-based \nsystem, which was, in my opinion, contrary to the spirit of the game. After all, MET \nhas always been about translating existing material, not creating new things. Hacking \nmajor bits of the game system out would have, I felt, been rather contrary to that \nmission. \nFinally, the question of balance always came up. Would some characters be too \npowerful or not powerful enough? Would everyone get a fair shake from the get-go? \nMoreover, would a live-action version of Mage play well with others? Would a single \nMage character be able to walk into a Masquerade game and turn all of the elders into \npapasan chairs without working up a sweat, and was that fair to the Vampire players”? \nFor all of the insistence on pure venues here, there and everywhere, we all know that \ncrossovers happen. Ten minutes after Laws of Magick hit the stands, someone, \nsomewhere would stroll into an Elysium with a Euthanatos character and try to reduce \neveryone to little piles of dust just ’cause he could. That sort of thing tends to distress \nplayers, and I always felt that distressing players unduly was a bad ideal2. \nThe real problem, however, ran a bit deeper. It ties into the same root reason that \nJustin Achilli’s eyes spit thin jets ofbloodevery time someone sends inanother proposal \nfor My Extremely Small Suburb by Night, which features 35 vampires living in a \nbedroom community that sports two gas stations, a single strip mall and a high school \nthat isn’t necessarily large enough to field a decent football team. \nThe thing that so many people forget when sending in proposals (and indeed, it’s \nalmost heartbreaking sometimes to see the labor lavished on proposals for books that \nsimply cannot see print) is that the books have to befmeveeryone. They can’t just be for “god \nroleplayers,” whoever that is. They can’t just be for people who play a certain style or \npeople who know not to abuse the rules in a certain way because that’s not the way it \nworks. Just as a would-be writer loses control of her submission the instant she puts it in \nthe mail, the developer loses control of the book the instant it gets shipped out to stores \nand distributors and -De0 prohibe -players. That means that the book has to speak for \nitself. It has to cover all of the bases. It has to be useful from the get-go for everyone from \nthe most immersive roleplayer to the rampaging gunbunny twink who wants to play a \nHIT-Mark just so he can blow stuff up real good. The book has to be accessible to everyone \n\n\nup in the same game, they can play nice together. A book can’t be designed for jist some \nplayers. The notion of putting a snobbish disclaimer reading, “Buy this book only if you’re \na good roleplayer!” is beyond ludicrous. Instead, it has to be usable by everyone, so that \nanyone can get anything he wants from the setting and genre out of it. \nSo that meant that rules sets that were only good for small-troupe play had to go \nbye-bye. That meant that proposals that relied on superior roleplaying and personal \nassessments of Paradox had to go out the window because, let’s face it, you may not \ncheat, but you know someone who does. It meant that systems that relied on too many \nNarrators or too many this or that had to be put aside. Most of all, it meant that games \nthat worked perfectly for a particular group, with a particular Storyteller and Narrator \nstaff, had to get chucked because you’re just not going to get that dynamic anywhere \nelse. What works perfectly for one game almost inevitably hits some bumpy spots with \nany other group of players because they don’t play the way you do, and the delicate \nchecks and balances that come from a tight-knit group with a guiding hand on the rules \ntiller just don’t translate. \nSo that’s the real reason I never did Mage for MET. It wasn’t because the \nsubmissions were bad because many of them were quite good, and I could certainly see \ncircumstances under which they’d work well. The trouble was I could never see them \nworking quite well for all circumstances and, in the long run, that’s what the book had \nto be in order to make it out the door. And since none of those submissions, and not \neven any combination of those submissions, was going to be able to be transformed into \nthat sort of book, that’s as far as the project went. Had a suitable proposal come in, 1 \nwould have done it in a heartbeatI3, but sadly, that was never the case. \nAnd that, sad to say, is the truth of the matter. If folks really want, I’ll swear up and \ndown that it was alien mind control that made me not do it, but sad to say, it was a lot \nless complicated than that. Will there ever be an MET Mage? Who knows? I haven’t \nseen the revised edition ofMage yet, and that just might make it possible. But that’s the \nfuture; I’m talking about the past. \nI know, the conspiracy theories were a lot more fun. But that’s just who I am, the \nmean guy determined to ruin everyone’s good time.. . \n. . .at least, until I Wisely teleport to Saturn. \n\n\nF ~ N D N O T E S  \nNo, it’s not “Why did you spell that last word ‘Theatre?’ It looks kind of pretentious, \nman.” Although I must admit, that one got asked a lot, too. (If you really must know, it was \nin place before I got there, and inertia is a powerful thing. I didn’t dare change the name of \nthe Angst stat in Wraith, either.) \n1 was always tempted to answer “Poughkeepsie” when asked, but I realized that no one \nactually knows where Poughkeepsie is. \n3 G ~  \nahead.

It’s a storm cast up out of \nthe Labyrinth, blasting through the Tempest to the Shadowlands, battering \nagainst the Shroud itself. It carries the inanimate debris of the Labyrinth and \nTempest, and it carries vast legions of Spectres, forced from their Oblivion- \ntainted homes, constantly wounded by the vibrancy of the upper lands of the \ndead and eager to inflict compensatory pain on others. \nCumulative pain and suffering in the Skinlands feeds the cycle of change \nwithin the Labyrinth. The more the material world feeds Oblivion, the more \nservants of Oblivion rise up to reap the dark harvest. Spectres don’t want to be \nthere, however; they yearn for the day when the storm clouds settle and they can \nreturn to the now-deserted Labyrinth. In the meantime, there are souls to destroy. \nThe storm begins with gale-force winds pouring through Nihils or ripping \ntheir own passages from Tempest to Shadowlands. The stronger the storm, the \nsharper its onset. The Fourth Great Maelstrom began with miles-high geysers of \nblack sludge erupting at the Somme. Within days, clouds carrying shards of dead \nsoldiers’ dreams and the poisonous remains of dead soldiers’ tears towered over \nthe moon. It took more than a decade for the last of them to subside. \nThe strength of a Great Maelstrom ebbs and flows. Sometimes the storm is \nalmost as intense as in the initial outbreak. Other times, it’s nearly calm. Wraiths can \nfind no rhythm or pattern to these changes. Experience shows that wraiths must \nsimply watchcarefully, take advantage of lulls and act swiftly when the storm returns. \nFighting the storm requires wraiths to act on several fronts. Airborne, ground- \nbased and seafaring soldiers set forth to fight the Spectres the storm carries. Arcanoi \nand force of will can drive back the storm itself. Finally, the Skinlands conditions \nthat feed the storm must change to reduce the flow of passion into the void. Doing \nany of that in the midst of civil war (as is the case during and after the Great War) \nis hard, and it breeds unusual alliances. Some wraiths join forces against the storm \n\n\nno matter what else their fellow warriors may be doing while others would rather let \nthe storm prevail than allow the wrong opponents to succeed. \nWraiths depend on Citadels and Haunts for shelter during the years of a Great \nMaelstrom. Unfortunately, corporeal structures aren’t always much good. The stron- \ngest walls don’t help when the enemy comes from the skies, for instance, and stout roofs \ndon’t help when defenders become demoralized. Oblivion’s generals routinely mobi- \nlize newly created Spectres as shock troops because the spectacle of one’s former friends \nand allies having become ravening creatures of the enemy weakens any wraith’s will \nto resist. A wraith who can turn off his feelings and deal with the problem without \nemotional burden is a wraith well on the way to becoming Shadow-Eaten himself. \nWraiths caught outside shelter when the storm winds pick up must \nimprovise as best they can. Some put hooks into the ground to keep themselves \nfrom blowing away. Others link their armor together to form a single unit \nmassive enough to resist most efforts at displacement. \nThe Great Maelstrom carries pieces of wraiths and of souls that never became \nwraiths, along with a lot of generic plasm and countless Plasmics. Fragments of bone, \nshards of memories and the occasional relic bullet fall from the sky during a storm. The \nScavenger Folk specialize in following storm fronts and harvesting whatever looks \nuseful. Most are skilled craftsmen and relic maintainers. They maintain a complex \nlanguage of their own, much like wandering nomadic traders in the Skinlands, and \nthey are rumored to possess special arts in Fa&, \nPhanm, fifeweb and Usury. \nLimb markets flourish in every Necropolis after a particularly strong storm blows \nthrough. Relic and Artifact limbs, whose owners are now so much shredded plasm, are \nalways in demand. Some wraiths enter the Shadowlands missing one or more limbs \nwhile more lose them in the course of the war. Gleaners must be quick: Severed limbs \ndissipate unless kept wet in plasm until a master Moliator can stabilize them. The \nresulting trade encourages all sorts of official and unofficial deals for sponsorship, \nprotection rackets and even (sometimes) peaceful, mutually profitable commerce. \nMAELSTROM \nFORCE LEVELS \nThe Beaufort-Granogrec Scale, developed by members of the Iron Legion’s \nOffice of Maelstrom Preparedness, classifies storms on a 1-5 scale. \nForce One. Winds blow to 40 mph, with occasional gusts higher. The storm \nconsists mostly of water-like liquids brought up from the Tempest. The little solid \ndebris that falls includes few pieces more than an inch or so long, almost none of it with \nsharp edges or other dangerous features. Dead and dying Plasmics sometimes fall. Few \nSpectres travel in Force-One storms. Exposed wraiths take no more than a maximum \nof four levels of damage per hour, generally no more than one. Two levels of armor \nprovide complete protection, as do even minimal walls and ceilings. Haunts reduce \ndamagebytwolevelsperHauntrating, evenwhenthestructureitselfis physically weak. \nForceTwo. Windsblow to8Omph, withsomestrongergusts.~in~llsco~tantly \nandgenerally containssmelly, strangely coloredliquidsandlive,wrig&ng Plasmics. Solid \ndebris, ranging from divots of Shadowlands ground to wind-polished shards of bone and \nStygian steel, falls constantly. Spectres move routinely through the storm. Wraiths take \na one+Trait penalty to movement-related challenges while exposed, and they suffer four \nto six levels of damage per hour outside. Some or all of this damage is aggravated about \none-quarter of the time. Armor provides its usual protection, while Haunts reduce \ndamage by one level per Haunt rating. The storm breaks windows, rips away loose roofs \nand the like, but it cannot blow through solid structures. \nForce Three. Winds blow to 120 mph or more. Torrents of rainfall, mixed half- \nand-half (or more) with bizarre and dangerous liquids, unknown living creatures and \nhazardous debris. Smtres move through the storm and convexe on wraiths out from \n\n\nevery hour, and this damage is aggravated up to half the time. Armor provides one less \nlevel of protection than usual. Haunts reduce damage by one level per Haunt rating. \nWraiths take a two-Trait penalty to all physical activities while outdoors. The storm \nsmashes through flimsy doors, roofs and walls, leaving occupants vulnerable. \nForce Four. Winds blow 200 mph or more. Rain and debris slashes in from \nall angles to penetrate any space not tightly sealed off. Spectres converge on \nexposed wraiths in as little as a minute. Wraiths take a three-Trait penalty to all \nchallenges while outdoors. Exposed wraiths suffer eight to 12 levels of damage \nevery hour. One or more levels of this damage i s  aggravated half the time. Armor \nprovides one less level of protection than usual, and Haunts block one less level \nof damage than usual. Structures that are not reinforced collapse in short order. \nForce Five. No means exist to measure wind speeds, which far exceed \nthose of Skinlands hurricanes. Anyone outside gets whisked away, never to be \nseen again. Spectres converge in seconds on anyone outside. Exposed wraiths \ntake 14 or more levels of damage every hour; some or all of this may become \naggravated at the Storyteller’s discretion. Armor and Haunts provide half their \nusual protection. Only the best-prepared structures survive intact. \nForce-Five winds blow only at the outbreak of a Great Maelstrom or in the \nmost dire conditions. Force-Four storms occur occasionally in response to \nmassive genocide and other horrors and in the early years of a Great Maelstrom. \nForce-Three winds strike most Necropoli every few decades, and Force-Two \nwinds do so every few years. Most Necropoli experience a Force-One wind at \nleast once a year and almost continuously during a Great Maelstrom. \nT H E  OTHERARTSOETHE \nDEAD \nThe Great Maelstrom makes long-distance travel very difficult and dangerous. \nIt disrup tsthe ties that bindwraiths to faraway FetterssothatevenaHarrowingwon’t \nsuddenly take a wraith back to the motherland. Souls of foreign soldiers that would \nnormally go to another Dark Kingdom are stuck in Stygian lands for the duration, \njust as the souls of Europeans and Americans who die elsewhere seldom make it back \nto their own homes. The presence of these exiles creates social tensions. \nSoldiers from the various colonies in Asia and Africa fight in Europe on behalf \nof their colonial masters, and some die. Wraiths from Africa generally hide, \nparticularly after the Ivory Trail begins. The wraiths in the Bush of Ghosts work a \npowerful ritual that compels trapped wraiths who’d normally go to Stygia to walk- \nwithout rest - \nfrom Africa to Europe. A great many Stygian wraiths perish in the \nstorms or from other adversaries, and those who survive generally suffer permanent \ninjuries. Wraiths capable of imposing such acurse seem monstrous and fearsome, and \nthey risk capture by the Hierarchy or destruction at the hands of hghtened mobs. \nIndian wraiths face a much less dire situation. They don’t know the full \nscope of the horror that waits for them back home, and many suffer from \nprofound disillusionment at finding how little of Buddhist, Hindu or other faith \nseems true in the Underworld. Some Indian wraiths exhibit a special Arcanos, \none valuable in many contexts. Some become enslaved, but others find comfort- \nable patronage. Those who can’t go home pursue an independent existence. \nBEHEST \nStygian observers speak of the Bush of Ghosts as if the African Shadowlands \nwere a single thing. Some would-be scholars take words from a single language and \nassume that all African wraiths use them. In truth, Africa is a continent with \nhundreds of peoples. Their languages vary, as do their concepts of the nature of the \nsoul, the afterlife and the role of the dead. The reality of the Underworld doesn’t \nprecisely match any mortal’s teachings; all African wraiths face surmises. \n\n\nINNATE \nABILITY \nLink. The wraith senses areas, individuals and objects connected to some \ntarget wraith. He medicates and exhales a cloud of smoke, which condenses into \na series of images that show points that the target regards as significant. The \nimages don’t provide clues as to scale or distance. \nSystem: Make a Mental Challenge against the target. If s u d l ,  the wraith using \nBehest sees an image of a place the target recently visited, or an object important to the \ntarget. Spend one mental trait to see a signhcant relic or Amfact, two Mental Traits to \nsee the target‘s chief Haunt and three Mental Traits to see one of the target’s Fetters. \nUsing Link with a skinmask or severed extremity of the target gets a Mental Trait \nbonus ofone. The user gainsnodfficulty mdifier for using Lmk in the target’schiefHaunt \nor while handting one of his Fetters. Using Lmk with just some object the target recently \nhandled or in a place the target’s been recently imposes a Mental Trait penalty of one. \nDelve. The wraith enters a trance state and senses part of the target’s recent \nexprience.Debdoesn’trevealwhatthetargetthought, \njust what theenvironmentwas. \nSystem: Spend one Pathos and make a Social Challenge against the target. \nIf successful, the Delver learns the target’s recent mood. Spend a Mental Trait \nwhile roleplaying being in trance state to receive impressions from one sense \nabout the target’s surroundings. With three or more senses activated, the Delver \nreceives a vivid and complete re-creation of the environment in those senses, as \ndetails from one sense complement those in another. Spend another Mental \nTrait to learn when the target had this experience. \nTrace. If the wraith grasps an object belonging to the target or occupies a space \nthe target recently vacated, she can determine where the target is. The wraith expels \na cloud of smoke which illuminates strands of Fate. The one leading to the target glows. \nSystem: Spend one Corpus, take one level of damage and make a Mental \nChallenge. If successful, the wraith knows the direction in which the target lies. \nSpend one Mental Trait to learn the target’s general distance or two for a precise \nlocation. If the tracer spends two Mental Traits thus, the target can make a \nMental Challenge to be aware of being watched. The glowing strand remains \nvisible to the tracer for one hour per level of Behest he knows. \n(Note: Behest includes two distinct paths of development at the Interme- \ndiate level. Wraiths must learn the Right-Hand Path arts of Scly and Divine first. \nThey can then turn to the Left-Hand Path arts of Twitch, Murmur and Veer. \nThere is no known Advanced ability for the Right-Hand Path. If it once existed, \nit’s been lost now, or its teaching has long been guarded closely. No Stygian \nwraith has ever encountered an African wraith who knew it.) \nINTERMEDIATE \nABILITIES: \nBIC~HT- \nHAND PATH \nBASIC \nABILITIES \n\n\nagainst eight Traits. Failure disperses the smoke so that the wraith can’t examine it any \nfurther. Spend a Mental Trait to bring the scene into clear focus and avoid the need for \nseparate challenges. The Smoke lasts for one turn per level of Behest the wraith knows. \nTwitch. The wraith must first use Scry on a target, and he can then move \nthe target’s Corpus in small ways. A rolled eye, a peculiar tingle or a stumble may \nnot seem like much, but at the right time, they can be devastating. \nSystem: First use Scry, as usual. Spend one Pathos and gain one Angst, then \nmake a Physical Challenge. If successful, the wraith can give the target one \nminor nudge in some specific way, plus one per Physical Trait spent. The target \ncan resist each by spending a Trait of Willpower to cancel the action. \nMurmur. This art lets the wraith speak through the target’s mouth, using \nthe victim’s own voice. \nSystem: First use Scry as usual. Spend two Pathos, gain one Angst and make \na Mental Challenge. If successful, the wraith can make the target speak one \nspecific sentence, plus one per MentalTrait spent. The target may resist each by \nspending a point of Willpower to cancel the action. \nADVANCED \nABILITY: \nLEET HAND PATH \nI N T E R M E D I A T E  ARTS: LEET- HAND \nP A T H  \nVeer. The wraith can direct the target like a puppet, controlling the \ntarget’s motor skills. \nSystem: First use Scry as usual. Spend two Pathos and one Willpower and \ngain one Angst. Make a Physical Challenge. If successful, the wraith controls the \ntarget for one turn, plus one turn per Physical Trait spent. The target can resist \nthe wraith‘s direction for one turn by spending a Willpower Trait. \nThis Arcanos combines elements of Kinesis, Moliute and Usury to create the \n“foods” and other decorations that make Swar, the Dark Kingdom of India, seem \nso lifelike. No Stygian can learn this art. \nThe Tvashtriya, the practitioners ofDcjplace, organize themselves into something \nlike a Guild. The Hierarchy maintains no treaties with Swm, so local authorities set \npolicy as they wish. Ingeneral, knownpractitionersofDisphce withinstygian territory \nface enslavement, or - \nif they’re lucky - \nrecruiting pitches they’d be unwise to turn \ndown. The Artificers’, Usurers’ and Masquers’ Guilds seek Tvashtriya just as enthusi- \nastically as the Hierarchy, hoping to master the Arcanm themselves. \nInnate Abilities \n\n\nSystem: Make a Static Physical Challenge against the number of hours the \nwraith wishes to remain hidden. If successful, the wraith merges with his target. \nOnly the Artificer ability Sense Rider can detect him. Destruction of the object \ninflicts one level of damage and reveals him back in the Shadowlands. \nSense Rider. The wraith may detect other wraiths in her vicinity who are \nStraddling material objects or Wraithriding the Corpus of someone else (or herself). \nSystem: Make a Static Mental Challenge against six Traits. If successful, \nthe wraith learns whether a target material object or wraithly Corpus is being \nridden. Spend one Mental Trait to determine the number and general nature of \nthose using Struddle or Wraithride and another Mental Trait to determine \nwhether a currently vacated target has been ridden recently. \nBasic Abilities \nWraithride. The wraith makes contact with another wraith’s Corpus and \nslips inside for an indefinite period. She finds herself in a dark, quiet place, and she \ncan sense nothing of her environment except knowing when the host is in Slumber \nor when someone is trying to detect her (which produces a faint buzzing noise). She \ncannot control or influence the host; she suffers equally whenever the host takes \ndamage, and she can be dragged with the host into Harrowings. Likewise, if she does \nsomething to trigger a Harrowing for herself, the host gets dragged with her. \nSystem: Make a Mental Challenge against the target wraith to invade his \nCorpus. If successful, the Wraithrider merges until she chooses to leave. Another \nwould-be Wraithrider must win a Physical Challenge to displace her. Sense R~der \nand Sense Kinesis may detect the Wraithrider, as may Transfer and other Usury arts \nif the user of these arts wins a Mental Challenge against the Wraithrider. \nDeflect. The wraith learns to conceal himself more thoroughly and to \ndeflect damage his host suffers. The host still suffers said damage, but the \npassenger may escape by using Defkct. \nSystem: ThewraithmustfirstuseStr& or Wraiduide. To avoiddetection, thewraith \nmust notice someone probing for him (intentionally or otherwise). Make a Mental \nChallenge against the examining wraith. If successful, the wraithusing JAjktwins on ties \nin upcoming challenges by the examiner, and he may reduce the examiner’s Mental or \nSocial Trait total for a single challenge by one for each point of Pathos spent (The wraith \nmust commit h \nenergy wme resolving the designad challenge.) To avoid takmg \ndamage, the wraith must touch a target who can receive i t  Make a Socd Challenge. If \ns u d ,  the wraith transfers one level of damage per level ofJ&dace the wraith knows. \nIntermediate Abilities \nTransfuse. The Wraithriding wraith lends Pathos to (or takes Pathos \nfrom) her host. The host notices this transaction if he is not in Slumber, and \nbystanders see a brief scintillation when the Wraithrider lends Pathos. Likewise, \nthey notice a brief wave of darkness when the Wraithrider takes Pathos. \nSystem: First use Wraithride. Make a Physical Challenge. If successful, the \nTransfuser can give or take one level of Pathos, plus one per Physical Trait spent. \nIt costs one Angst to take Pathos, none to give it. \n~\nT\nh\ne\nw\nc\na\nn\nm\n~\n~\n~\nh\n~\ns\n~\n~\n.\nH\ne\nc\na\nn\n~\ntrampent or conductive to sound, or he can rework it as ifbyM&. \nMinor alterations \nthat don’t change the wraith’s corporeal configuration can take place during Slumber \nwithout rousin~ the host More serious work alwaw attracts the hast’s attention. \nSystem:l%stuse Wraidmde.SpendonePathk.GainoneAngstifthehostiswilling, \ntwo if the host resists.

Changes comparable to the Moliate art of Sculpt require \n\n\nAdvanced Ability \nTransmogrify. The master ofDisplace can change a host’s Corpus into almost \nanything, including forms suitable for consumption as Pathos “nourishment.” \nSystem: First use Wraithride. Spend two Pathos and gain three Angst. Make \nan Extended Mental Challenge against the host. A single success lets the wraith \nwork general transformations. Three or more successes let the wraith turn the \nhost into an edible form, often a pile of fruit in which each fruit holds one Trait \nof the host’s Pathos. Transmogrify creates permanent changes. \n0 BLIVION ’ s EOOT- SOLDIERS \n: M ORTWI ~ H T S  \nEvery pyramid has a bottom. The Mortwights are the lowest of the Shadow-Eaten, \nthe ones that all other Spectres despise. Until modem times, only a few Mortwights \nappeared in the Shadowlands in any year. However, the psychic traumas of mass life and \nmass death make more of them every year. Other Spectres see this population boom as \nan infestation of vermin. Cut off from the living, from the Restless Dead who aren’t yet \nShadow-Eaten and from the mass of Spectral societies, Mortwights form communities \nof their own or pass a solitary time until Oblivion claims them altogether. \nPlaying a Mortwight isn’t easy, and Storytellers should feel free to go very slowly in \napproving Mortwight characters for their chronicles. Some Mortwights band together \nto strike out at their enemies on both sides of the Shroud. Some pursue Spectral status \nandauthority.Someseekredemption.. . asaformofsuicide,hopingtotumthemindthey \nnowhaveintonothingmorethananechointhebackofthehead,afadingmemorymn \nlost as the Psyche goes on to some condition far from the Shadow. All three of these \nmotives can play serious havoc with a chronicle. Plan carefully. \nEach Mortwight normally takes two levels of damage for eachday spent in the \nShadowlands from the spiritual stresses of being so close to life. The storms sustain \nMortwights, however. While Maelstrom winds blow, make a Static Angst Test \nagainst a difficulty of nine Traits, minus one per level of the storm. If this test \nsucceeds, reduce the day’s damage by one if the storm level is Force Three or less. \nCancel the day’s damage altogether if the Maelstrom force level is four or five. \nC R E A T I N ~ A  \nM O R T W I ~ H T  \nCHARACTER \nConcept. Choose a Nature and Demeanor from the Shadow Archetypes \nthat appear in Oblivion and part one of this article (Mind’s Eye Theatre \nJournal: Issue 5 ,  p. 45). Remember that a living person becomes a Mortwight \nby dying in some particularly terrible and unpleasant way. \nAttributes and Abilities. Assign Attribute and Abilities levels as usual. \n*ArcanoiGmtWar-eraMortwightsbeginwithonelevelinHive-Mmd,onelevel \nin Tempest Wavingand five levels of other Dark Arcanoi. Mortwights created when the \nGreat Maelstroms don’t blow begin with one level of Hive-Mind and five levels of other \nDark Arcanoi. Mortwights can only learn reg& Arcanoi in the course of play. \nBackgrounds. Assign five levels of Backgrounds. Mortwights cannot \nacquire Eulolon, Notoriety or Status. \nDark Passions and Fetters. Choose four Dark Passions and four Fetters \nas usual. Most Mortwights have the place of death as a Fetter, and all the Fetters \nrelated to painful or otherwise unpleasant moments. Mortwights cannot resolve \nFetters, but they can lose them to destruction. \nAngst and Being. Your character begins with five Angst Traits and three \nBeing Traits, as given in Oblivion. \nCorpus. Your character begins with 10 Corpus. Each time the Mortwight \nfails a challenge, make two Simple Tests. If both fail, the Mortwight loses a level \n\n\n*FreeTraits.YouhavefiveFreeTraitstoallocateasyouwkh. UsethechartinLaws \nof the Night, p. 71. Basic Arcanoi cost four Traits to acquire at this time; Intermediate \nArcanoi cost seven Traits, and you cannot begrn play with Advand Arcanoi. \nCONTAMINATE \nThis Dark Arcanos feeds the power of Oblivion in others. It manifests in \nmany ways, much like Castigation does: Some Spectres practice a sick form of \nbattlefield medicine, while others peddle Spectral booze or drugs. Each Spectre \nhas a distinctive style to Contaminate. \nBasic Abilities \nDissect. The Spectres discerns the target’s Nature by examining its \nSystem: Make a Mental Challenge to learn the target’s Nature. \nContamination of the Tongue. The Spectre can speak directly to a wraith’s \nShadow, and the Shadow can provide brief answers even when not in Catharsis. \nSystem: Make a Social Challenge. If successful, the Spectre can ask the \ntarget one question or make a one-sentence statement and get a one-sentence \nresponse. Each Mental Trait spent lets the Spectre add another question or \nstatement. The Shadow takes momentary control of the target, speaking with \nthe wraith‘s voice and mouth, which is both obvious and disconcerting. \nechoes in the target’s Shadow. \nIntermediate Abilities \nContamination of the Soul. The Spectre drains her own Angst (usually as a \ndark noxious fluid) and pours it into the target, strengthening the target’s Shadow. \nSome Spectres spit the liquefied Angst; some open wounds and “bleed” into them; \nsome inject the Angst with a Moliated syringe; others use even less pleasant methcds. \nSystem: Spend one Angst and make a Static Physical Challenge against the \ntarget’s Willpower. The Spectre transfers one point of Angst, plus one per \nMental Trait spent. The Spectre’s Psyche gains a point of Composure. The \nAngst remains fluid for one minute to allow time for injection or other handling. \nContaminationof theMind.TheSpectrehe1psanother’sShadowintoCatharsis. \nSystem: Spend twohgst and make a Physical Challenge. If successful, the target’s \n\n\nThe temporary Abilities last for one hour, orperhapsmore. Attheendofthe hour, \nthe target makes a Static Willpower Test for each Ability gained against a total of 10 \nTraits, minus the Maelstrom force level. On a tie or loss, the target loses that Ability. \nThis art is the Spectral analogue to Puppetry - \ntechniques for turning a \nmortal’s soul into something sufficiently tuned to the Spectre so that the dead \nmanipulator can take control without ever seeming obvious about it. \nCORRUPTION \nInnate Abilities \nSense Likeness. The Spectre looks for the signs of Oblivion already \nworking in mortal targets. \nSystem: Make a Static Mental Challenge against the local Shroud rating, \nminus the Maelstrom force level. Success lets the Spectre find a suitable mortal \nvictim in the area, receptive to manipulation. The Storyteller defines the nature \nof the target: a villain, an ambitious but weak soul, someone in the grip of a Dark \nPassion or whatever suits the story. \nSoul Leech. This art is the Spectral version of possession, more powerful \nand more dangerous than Puppetry. \nSystem: Spend one Angst and make a Social Challenge. If successful, the Spectre \nslips unnoticed into his target, and he can use the other arts 0fC-h. \nThe Spectre \nexperiences the target’s senses, losing all thedistinctively wraithly senses like Deathsight. \nThe limitations of Puppetry, such as vulnerability to electroshock, apply to SoulLeech. \nThe possession lasts for one hour, plus one for each Social Trait spent. \nNote: The Basic, Intermediate and Advanced abilities of Corruption all \nrequire the Spectre to first use Soul Leech on the target. \nBasic Abilities \nLucid Visions. The Spectre inflicts a momentary, violent flash of \nimagination on the target. The information content of the vision must fit in a \nsingle simple sentence, like “Go through the fire escape door,” but the emotional \ncontent and associations in memory can be very complex. \nSystem: Spend one Angst and make a Social Challenge to inflict a single \nvision on the target. \nUnbidden Hands. The Spectre makes the target’s physical bcdy do something \nwithout the target realizing it consciously. The task cannot be lethal or self-destmctive. \nSystem: Spend three Angst and make a Physical Challenge. If successful, the \nSpectre gains covert control of the target’s body for 10 minutes, plus 10 minutes for \neach Trait by which the Spectre’s Being is greater than the target’s Willpower. The \ntarget cannot spend Willpower to resist Unlrdden H a d .  Example tasks include \nwriting, “The bastard must die!” over and over while thinking about an ex-lover, or \ntying nooses while thinking about how much fun it will be to play with a new dog. \nIntermediate Abilities \nUrges. The Spectre forces the target to take asingle action which satisfies one \nof the Spectre’s Dark Passions and which, on some level, the target would like to do. \nSystem: Spend two Angst and make a standard Passion Test. If the Spectre \nwould gain Angst from the intended action, then make a Social Challenge to \nforce the target to act that way. If the Social Challenge succeeds, the Spectre \ngains the Angst indicated in the Passion Test; otherwise the two Angst just go \ndown the drain. The target may spend Willpower to resist the compulsion. If the \nSocial Challenge fails, make two Simple Tests. If both tests fail, the target feels \na deep revulsion toward the command, and the Spectre can’t try to Urge the \ntarget to any other action based on the chosen Dark Passion for the next full day. \n\n\nBlissful Unity. The Spectre makes a permanent place for herself in the \ntarget’s soul. The target retains self-awareness, but he carries out the Spectre’s \ninstructions without realizing that they come from someone else’s will. \nSystem: The Spectre must first attune the target as a Consort (seeoblivion, \np. 98). Spend five Angst and one permanent Being, and make a Social \nChallenge, with no modifications for Consort status. If successful, the Spectre \nplants the first hooks. If the test fails, make two Simple Tests. If both fail, the \nSpectre botches and can never again attempt Blissful Unity with that target. \nOnce established, the Spectre wears down the target’s resistance by accu- \nmulating successes on Extended Social Challenges equal to the target’s Willpower. \nThe Spectre may make one such challenge per day, at the cost of two Angst and \none temporary Being. If the Spectre accumulates no successes at all on a \nparticular Extended Challenge, the next effort costs an additional point of \nAngst. Once the Spectre does get the necessary challenges, the target is hers to \ndo with as she pleases. The target counts as a Fetter, and the Spectre can use Soul \nLeech against her automatically, at the cost of one Angst but without achallenge. \nMost victims of Blissful Unity go immediately to Oblivion when they die. A \nfew become Mortwights. \nHIVE- MIND \nDistress Signal. The Spectre sends out a non-verbal call for help; it carries \nonly the message “I’m in trouble!” \nSystem: Make a Static Social Challenge against seven Traits (or six Traits if the \nMaelstrom level is from three to five). If successful, the Spectre summons one Spectre \nwho appears within a few turns via Nihil or Arcanos use, plus another Spectre for each \nSocial Trait spent. Storytellers may delay the summoned help a few minutes on some \noccasions, but Distress Signal is supped to be useful. Spectres who arrive after the crisis \ndo no good, and players shouldn’t feel that they’re wasting their effort. \nBasic Abilities \nSilent Whispers. The Spectre sends a mental message to any other \nSpectre within line of sight. This ability only sends messages; it does not grant \nthe recipient the power to reply without also using Hive-mind. \nSystem: Make a Social Challenge. If successful, the Spectre can transmit \none simple sentence, plus one per Social Trait spent. \nDistant Whispers. The Spectre engages in a two-way telepathic conver- \nsation with any other Spectre known to the one using Distant Whispers, \nregardless of the distance between them. \n\n\nSystem: Spend one Angst and make a Mental Challenge. If successful, the \nSpectre and the recipient can each send one simple sentence, plus one each per \nMental Trait either chooses to spend. \nIntermediate Abilities \nRecall the Known. The Spectre can access information he once knew but \nhas since forgotten, or learned only in passing. \nSystem: Spend one Angst and make a Static Mental Challenge against \neight Traits (or seven Traits if the Maelstrom level is from three to five). If \nsuccessful, the Spectre recalls one specific piece of information (and he can \nattempt one specific use of an Ability), plus one per Mental Trait spent. \nRecall the Unknown. The Spectre can probe through the Hive-Mind into other \nSpectres’ thoughts and memories, including those who’ve smce gone on to Oblivion. \nSystem: Spend two Angst and make a Static Mental Challenge against eight \nTraits. If successful, the Spectre recalls a particular piece of information for one \nturn, plus one turn per mental Trait spent. Recall the Unknown cannot teach the \nuse of Arcanoi, but pretty much everything else is accessible through this art. \nAdvanced Ability \nRacial Memory. The Spectre can draw on all knowledge in the Hive- \nMind, including Arcanoi and Dark Arcanoi she hasn’t learned herself. \nSystem: Spend two Angst and one Being, and gain one temporary Compo- \nsure. Make an Extended Static Mental Challenge against nine Traits. If \nsuccessful, the Spectre learns one Arcanos or Dark Arcanos at one level per two \nMental Traits (rounded up). He retains knowledge of the Arcanos for one turn \nper success in the challenge. \nSHROUD- \nRENDINC~ \nOnly Mortwights learn this Dark Arcanos; other Spectres lack the lingering \nties to the mortal world that make it possible, and in fact most other Spectres \ndon’t even suspect it exists. Spectres of other castes cannot see Mortwights \nwho’ve entered the Skinlands via Shroud-Rending. \nSystem: Spend two Angst and one Being; the Psyche gains one Composure. Make \nastatic Challenge ofthe Mortwight’s Physical Traits plus 1evelsofShroud-Rendingagainst \nthe local Shroud rating minus the Maelstrom force level (minimum difficulty of five \nTraits). If s u c d l ,  the Mortwight rips open a hole in the Shroud and plunges through, \ntaking a level of damage while crossing the Shroud. The Mortwight exists in the \nSkinlands in intangible form. She can use all Arcanoi and Dark Arcanoi that affect the \nSkinlands, but not ones that normally work only in the Underworld. The Mortwight’s \nsafe timeintheSkinlandsandhowoftentheMortwightcanuseShroud-Rendingdepend \nthe levels of Shroud-Rendmg the Mortwight knows. \nThe Mortwight can travel freely, but must he return to the exact spot she \ncrossed the Shroud to return to the Underworld. Shroud-Rending works only \nwhen initiated from the Underworld, so a Mortwight unable to return to the \npoint of entry is in serious trouble until she can return or some other Mortwight \nopens a hole through which she can return. \nAfter the safe time passes, the Mortwight loses one Trait of Angst per hour, \ndown to a minimum of one Trait. Exercising Dark Passions adds new Angst, \nwhich also drains away. After Angst reaches one, Being falls by one Trait per \nhour to a minimum of one. Then Mental and Social Traits drain away one per \nhour, in whatever order the player chooses, down to zero. At this point, the \nMortwight is a mindless hulk driven only by its Dark Passions. The Dark Passions \ndrop away, one per day, leaving behind only the one that last generated Angst \n\n\nPermanent Being falls by one, as a mark of the trauma. \nArcanos Level \nHow Much Time \nonce per two weeks \nTEMPEST \nWEAVINC~ \nThe art of Tempest-exploitation comes naturally to Mortwights. Spectral \nscholars theorize some hidden connection or covert plan of Oblivion’s greatest \nservants, without (so far) any evidence to support their speculations. \nInnate Abilities \nStorm-Horn. The Spectre can hearthe distinctive voice of everyNihi1 m the area \nso as to recognize each one in the future. (The Shadowlands and Tempest or Labyrinth \nends of a Nihil sound recognizably the same.) The Spectre can also speak to a Nihil, \nquietingitsownvoicesothattheSpectrecanhearthesoundscomingfromtheotherend. \nSystem: Make a Static Mental Challenge against six Traits. If successful, \nthe Spectre hears the nearest Nihil, plus one more (in order of increasing \ndistance) per level of Maelstrom force level over Force One. The ability has no \nupper limit on range. The Spectre’s player may make a Static Mental Challenge \nagainst four Traits to recognize a Nihil she’s heard before, and she may make a \nStatic Social Challenge against four Traits to quiet the Nihil for one hour. \nDuring this time, she hears whatever’s said at the other end. \nHole in the World. After identifying a Nihil with Storm-Horn, the \nSpectre can travel through it, even if it’s been sealed off. \nSystem: Make a Static Physical Challenge against eight Traits, minus the \nlocal Maelstrom level. If successful, the Spectre opens a closed Nihil for one turn \nand can even jump through. It takes a few turns, at the Storyteller’s discretion, \nto emerge at the other end. \nBasic Abilities \nStorm-Lash. The Spectre draws strength from the Maelstrom. She steps \nbare, free of all clothing, equipment and other encumbrances, into the storm and \nemerges invigorated. \nSystem: Spend one Angst and make a Static Physical Challenge against 10 \nTraits, minus the local Maelstrom level. If successful, the Spectre regains one point of \nCorpusortemporary AngstperlevelofMaelstromrating. Ifthespectre hasfullCorpus \nur Angst (not necessarily both), extra points may raise temporary Being. The process \ntakes one turn per Trait regained, and the Spectre can use it as often as she likes. \nThread of Corruption. The Spectre infects a relic with Maelstrom force. The \ntaint of Oblivionrequires anyone not yet Shadow-Eaten to gain Angst in the course \nofusing the relic. Tainted relics emit unique notes that Tempest Weavers can track. \n\n\nSystem: Make a Static Mental Challenge agamt sevenTraits, plus the relic’s rating, \nminus the local Maelstrom force level. If successful, the Spectre corrupts the relic. \nThereafter, anyone except a Spectre or a wraith rn Catharsis gains one point of Angst \nupon using the relic. All ans that detect Oblivion’s presence reveal the corruption. \nIntermediate Arts \nUnweave the Self. The Spectre unravels her Corpus into storm-carried threads. \nSystem: Spend one Angst and make Static Physical Challenge against nine Traits, \nminus the local Maelstrom level. If suae.sfi.11, the Spectre becomes a small collection of \nMaelstrom debris resembling ashredded gament, capable of moving wherever the wind \nblows. The Spectre can remain unwoven for one hour per level of Maelstrom rating. It \ntakes one turn of concentrated effort for the Spectre to weave or unweave hedf. \nReweaving. The Spectre pulls pieces of objects from the storm or \nDestruction Harrowings and reassembles them, albeit without much control \nover what the storm delivers. \nSystem: Spend one Angst, gain one Composure and make an Extended \nStatic Physical Challenge against seven Traits minus the local Maelstrom level \n(minimum difficulty of four Traits). \nOne success produces a small object without combat applications - \na \nfavored toy or other small Fetter of a wraith now lost to Oblivion, for instance. \nTwo successes let the object carry a Trait of Dark Passion, which the Spectre can \nsuck out and convert into Angst. Three successes produce the pieces of a one- \nor two-Trait relic, generally one destroyed recently in the storm. \nThe Spectre can attempt to find some specific sort of object. A broad class of \nobjects, like any pistol or any pocket watch, raises the base difficulty of the challenge \nto eight traits, while the hunt for a particular object raises the base difficulty to LO. \nReweaving takes one turn in any event. The object lasts for one hour per success in \nthe challenge unless the Spectre chooses to let it collapse earlier. \nAdvanced Ability \nCarve the Chaos. The Spectre imposes his will on the Tempest, turning \nit into a solid form. It works in the Labyrinth and the Tempest all the time, and \nin the Shadowlands when the Maelstrom level is Force One or more. \nSystem: Spend two Angst and one Being, gain two Composure, and make a \nStatic Mental Challenge. The difficulty is seven Traits in the Labyrinth or \nTempest, nine Traits during ForceThree (and greater) storms or lOTraits inForce \nOne or Two storms. If successful, the Spectre can make whatever he chooses out \nof a space 20 feet on a side. Only the Spectre’s imagination limits the range of \npossible creations. The carved chaos reverts to its normal form in one hour. \nO T H E R  D A R K  ARCANOI \nThis list is not an exhaustive one of all available Dark Arcanoi. See \nDoomslayers: Into the Labyrinth and Wraith: The Great War for more. Use \nthe given Dark Arcanoi as guidelines for conversions. In general, when the \ntabletop rules provide so much result per success rolled, make a Simple Test and \nprovide extra result per Trait spent of whatever sort the challenge requires. \nT H E  \nK I N C ~ O E T H E  \nDEAD: CHARON \nOne of the most distinctive features of the Great War era is that Charon, \nfounder of the Stygian Empire, still exists in the Shadowlands. He’s absent from \nhis public duties, traveling incognito through his territory. He’s filled with \ndoubts in the early 20th century. Did he do the right thing in founding and \n\n\nAs the single most powerful individual in the empire, Charon doesn’t really \nneed statistics. He can, within very broad limits, do what he wants. Therefore, \nStorytellers who want to use him in their chronicles must do so very carefully \nbecause he can easily destroy characters and everything meaningful to them. \nCharon the man doesn’t wish to shatter his empire but to understand it. You \nmust make sure that Charon the character doesn’t wreck your chronicle. \nThe Imperator travels incognito, Moliated by the very best of the Masquers’ Guild \nand assisted with the mental powers of the Mnemoi. Work out the statisticsfor the cover \nidentity, and expect that Charon stays within his chosen boundaries mat of the time. \nIn his own form, Charon is asomewhat small manofGreek appearance. (Average \nhuman height rises over time thanks to improved medicine and nutrition.) He’s quiet \nmost of the time, but intensely alert. His accumulated power manifests as a subliminal \npull. Like him or hate him, nobody can ignore his presence unless he makes a constant \ncalculated effort to appear average. The whole point of his traveling in disguise is that \nhe wants to see what others say when they’re not compelled to treat him as Imperator. \nWhen he deems it necessary to act, though, nobody doubts who he is. Only later do \npeople realize that he commands a great deal more power than commanding \nappearance, and conflicting stories of his actual appearance circulate. \nRemember that Charon knows his fate. The Lady of Fate explained it to him long \nago. HeknowswhenthisGreatMaelstromendsandhowtheInsurrectionends; \nheknows \nwhen the next Great Maelstrom begins and the tangled web of his last moments in the \nShadowlands. He won’t tell anyone else their fates, but he knows far more than anyone \ncould and still remain happy. Very occasionally he tries to issue a warning to someone \nhe’s become fond of, but experience shows that his doing so almost never works out well. \nAn appearance by Charon should be avery special moment in the chronicle. \nHe doesn’t spend very long in any given place. Introduce him in disguise and \ngradually make it clear that he knows far more than he should if he were no more \nthan he claims. When he’s understood what’s going on where the characters are, \nhe may reveal himself to them all, to a chosen few or even just to one soul. Then \nhe’s on his way to somewhere else, in a new persona. In his wake, he should leave \nawe, perhaps a renewed determination to protect the Restless Dead in accordance \nwith his driving dream and maybe a touch of confusion among the wicked. \nCharon has a lot of things in mind, and he may interact with the characters \nin many ways. These suggestions ate just some of the possibilities. \nThe State of the Empire. Charon pays particular attention to the \nAnacreons and other officials in a Necropolis. He doubts that he’s built his \nempire wisely, and he wants to see just what they do. He usually presents himself \nas a soldier of the Emerald Legion weary of the war, uncertain of his loyalties and \nseeking sanctuary. Once in place, he listens to what others say about the officials, \nand he compares it with what the officials say and what he sees them doing. \nShadows. Charon often travels as a typical Pardoner, plying his craft and \nstudying the Shadows of his subject. He sometimes intervenes to stop particu- \nlarly sadistic Pardoners. Depending on the circumstances, this action can \nunleash a complex network of ramifications among the local Pardoners and the \ngroups for whom they provide services. \nCustodians. When he finds wraiths whose spirit he admires, Charon \n\n\nsome compensatory benefits, such as a one-time grant from Charon of a boost \nin an Arcanos, or some other gift that helps them perform the task. \nTesting Hearts. Charon sometimes disguises himself to resemble an escaped \nThrall seeking the help of some random Circle of wraiths. He tells a story of escaping \nvile slavers; later he fakes Catharsis and tells a story of being enslaved for horrible \ncrimes. Do the characters help, and if so how? He doesn’t think there’s any single \nright answer, and he wants to see just what some random subjects of his empire do. \nRescuers. Charon introduces himself as a Hierarch in exile seeking to \nreturn captured wraiths of other Dark Kingdoms to their homes. He wants to \nremove the rescued slaves as tools for the Hierarchy and the Grim Legion to fight \nover, and he needs the characters’ help in getting the wraiths on their way. \nSecretly, Charon also wants to tell the wraiths to tell their respective masters of \nhis desire for a peaceful, honorable end to their antagonisms. He wishes to avoid \nthe doom he sees coming for his empire. \nT H E  LANDSOETHE \nDEAD: \nPEOPLEAND \nPLACES \nThe following is just aquick overview to suggest the range of settings possible \nIn the Skinlands, the glory days of the Spanish empire are long gone. As \nlong as their memory remains, however, the Necropolis in Barcelona will \ncontinue to glitter with the gold extracted for centuries from the Americas. \nOld-school Roman Catholicism flourishes openly and rumors circulate that \nFishers aren’t hard to find. The influenza pandemic hits Europe in Spain, and \nSkeletal Legion forces are particularly strong here. \nChancellor Bismarck presides over the safest Necropolis in Europe. Every \nwraith in the Necropolis spends one day a week in his assigned “Day Corps,’’ \nsupplementing the permanent troops in patrol and guard duties. Bismarck isn’t \na hidebound reactionary. In life, he sponsored educational and social reforms to \nagainst the storm and against the Grim Legion’s revolt. Stygian troops use this city \nas their base for operations throughout the region, including Wolseley’s multi- \nLegion force fighting Coldheart’s Spectral army in Russia, and traders cluster here \nunder the troops’ protections. Existence continues here much as always. \n\n\nChicago \nPenitent Anacreon Joseph P. \nAltgeld presides (or tries to) over a \nNecropolis in disarray. Some neigh- \nborhoods are calm and peaceful.

The city’s living gangs get \nsupernatural assistance; after all, it’s \nall Pathos for the harvesting. \nNew York City \nThe Grim Legion holds sway.

The Spooks’ Guild \noperates openly, trading the first fruits \nof Maelstrom gleaning for official pro- \ntection. On the other hand, a small \nenclave remains in the hands of the \nLegion of Fate and another in the \nHands of the Hierarchy’s Fifth Legion. \nIndependent wraiths move back and \nforth as they see opportunities, and they dodge the incessantly shifting frontier. \nGraft and corruption define all administrations in the area. \nParis \nParis isacity inlove withrevolution, and thesteady death tollofwar andplague \nkeeps the Necropolis well-populated. The Smiling Lord finds a willing audience for \nhis message at first, until the populace grows bored and decides that restoration \nwould be more interesting than the Smiling Lord’s earnest regime. Anacreons come \nand go every few months. Heretics of all sorts flourish, with Christian and other \nreligious movements clustered around the city’s cathedrals while Renegades build \nfragile utopias in the sewers and catacombs. The only constant for Paris is change. \n\n\nby Laura D. Hanson \nThis article is the second in a limited series on the hows and wherefores of \nhistoricalLARPcostuming. W e  foundhuraat the 1999 Gen-Con, and we’re \nglad we did so. And for those astute readers out there who caught issue #4 of \nthe Journal, no, Laura is not “Auntie Csilla.” \nGreetings once again! My name is Laura Hanson, and I work as a part-time \ncostumer in New York City (among other things). I have been costuming myself \nand others for various Renaissance festivals and LARP’s for about 10 years, and \nsomewhere along the way, I managed to pick up a degree in medieval history that \nhas given me all kinds of insight into various amounts and kinds of research. \nIn my last column, I discussed costuming concerns in Dark Ages Europe, the \nAmerican Wild West and the Great War, and I gave a very brief overview of the \nfashions and clothing styles of each time. I also included some tips on how to \ndress and where to shop for items that would help to emulate that period without \nfalling back on stereotypes for inspiration. \nWhen I turned in my first article, our illustrious developer said “Great! It’s \njust what I wanted! Now, could you please reverse all of that for your next \npiece? Maybe something about identifying headwear and accessories, and a bit \nwith a dog. People love dogs.” \n“Sure,” I said, smiling. You always smile when talking to your developer. \nEven when he can’t see you. Even through clenched teeth. “I’d be happy to.” \nSo, this time, I take a look at some of the more common (and accurate) character \nstereotypes from each of these three time periods. I also discuss ways to emulate them \neasily using evocative headgear, accessories, jewelry and so forth. Hopefdly these \nsuggestionswill workasvisualcues to youralter-ego’srole insocietysoothersdon’thave \nto spend the first half-hour of play asking, ‘‘What is it your character does, again?“ \nConsider this article sort of a “fast-and-dirty” guide to costuming. \nMention the Dark Ages to most people, and most of them (who know what \nyou’re talking about) will bring up some fairly common stereotypes. Figures such \nas King Arthur and his knights, Guinevere and her ladies-in-waiting, court \njesters, monks and Robin Hood tend to get mentioned the most. Those figures \ndo actually have some basis in fact, although not always to the full extent to \nwhich they appear in media today. Kings, queens, knights, ladies, merchants, \nserfs and farmers all populated the period. \nThe basic costume of the time was relatively simple. It consisted of long- \nsleeved, long-skirted dresses (sometimes in multiple layers) for the women, \nbelted at the waist with a girdle of metal or cloth and with a veil of linen worn \nover the hair, which was worn long, often looped and braided into elaborate \nhairstyles. For the most part, men wore either short, thigh-length tunics with \n\n\ntights covering their legs or floor-length robes in much the same style as the \nwomen. Sumptuary laws governed who could wear what sorts of fabric, fur and \ncolors so that clothing clearly defined each layer of the social strata. \nTHE \nCHATELAINE, \nO R  L A D Y W I T H T H E K E Y S  \nDue to the fact that the Lord of the manor was often away at war under the \nbanner of whomever he owed fealty to, the Lady of the estate would often find \nherself in charge of the general upkeep of the estate and its surrounding lands. Her \nLadyship was the only person on the estate who held keys to all of the locks in the \ncastle or manor house, making her ring of keys a significant visual cue to the power \nshe held. To emulate this station with a prop, find the largest metal ring that you \ncan and thread keys onto it. Antique keys work best, of course, but if you aren’t \nlucky enough to have an eccentric aunt with an attic full of nifty props, you can \noften purchase modem copies (of the keys) from craft or do-it-yourself jewelry or \nbead shops. After you have your ring assembled, tie it to a length of ribbon, cord \nor chain, then allow it to dangle authoritatively from your waist over your skirts. \nWithout question, the most distinctive piece of costuming you can invest in \nis the jester hat. This hat is the definitive article of clothing for a court jester, and \nit comes in a variety of styles, all of which have several basic things in common. \nFor instance, jester hats have multiple points that either hang down like floppy dog \nears or have stuffing so that they stand away from the head. They come in multiple \ncolors, and they often have bells sewn on at the points and a stiff brim cut to \nresemble a crown (something that developed from the fools mockery of kings and \nprinces). These hats are fairly easy to find at costuming shops or Renaissance \nFestivals (or even those funky hat shops that show up in malls). \nThe rest of the costume of the fool is also quite distinct and very brightly colored. \nOften, his clothes were the cast-offs of his betters, pieced together from worn out suits \nof clothing so that he might have one legging in one color, one in another and a tunic \nfrom still a third outfit, none of which matched. The best way to evoke this look for \nyour jester character is to make sure that nothing matches; avoid co-ordination \ncompletely. Even if the clothes are modern, if you think like a little kid getting dressed \non her own for the first time, you can look pretty clownish. After that, add jingle bells. \nTie them onto your clothing at your wrists, ankles, knees, elbows (anywhere really) \nwith ribbons in bright, obnoxious colors. Okay, so you can’t sneak up on anyone with \nbells tied allover your body, but hey, you’re a fool; nooneshouldbeafraidofyouanyway \n(or should they?). One final effective touch is that of the mock scepter or wand. This \nprop can be as simple as a painted wooden dowel rod with ribbons and bells tied around \nthe top or as fancy as the jester-headed styles sold in gift shops and at fairs. \nT H E  \nC O U R T J E S T E R ,  O R  THE \nEOOL \nO T H E R  O E E I C E R S O E T H E  C O U R T ,  I N C L U D I N G  LORDS \nThe ranks of office were all in the jewelry. During the Dark Ages, wealthy \nmen often wore as much jewelry as (if not more than) their female counterparts. \nChains of office were decorations rather like oversized necklaces that draped \nover the shoulders. They could be as simple as a thick, unadorned gold or silver \nchain or as elaborate as linked medallions covered in gemstones. (Think of \n1970s disco belts for an approximate visual.) \nAlso, go heavy on the rings. If you can find really heavy bands with large \n“gemstones,” you’ll be on the right track. If you can wear enough of them, even \nclass and fraternity rings give you the right look. I have had a lot of luck in the \nC O S T U M I N ~ E O B  \nLIVE-ACTION \nPLAY \n@ \n\n\npast shopping at antique malls and flea markets for these sorts of props. I have \nalso been known to invest in “real” jewelry in this style, but doing so can get \npricey. It also helps to have stuff that you don’t care about losing. At this time, \nmen did not really wear earrings. This accouterment was a fashion that seems to \nhave picked up when Europeans came in closer contact with “Eastern” cultures, \nso if you wish to wear them during play, don’t, or keep them small. \nM O N K S  \nThe costume of the monk has never really changed, much. It consists of a \nlong, plain robe with full sleeves and a cowl or hood. Tie the robe at the waist \nwith a length of rope that has been knotted at eachend. In addition, these monks \nwore plain leather or rope sandals similar to the Birkenstock brand of today. And \nthat’s it, folks. Some might also have carried a wooden cross or rosary beads, but \nnothing more. Unfortunately, there really aren’t any short-cuts or easy visual \ncues here. You really do need the robes. However, if you just can’t come up with \nthem, dress very plainly, in loose clothing of all one color. Avoid black in favor \nof gray or brown, or even white or off-white. Then track down a length of rope \nlong enough to tie around your waist with the ends hanging down to about knee- \nlength. And, if your character is very penitent, you can add a wooden cross to \nwear around your neck or hanging down from the rope belt on a leather thong. \nT H E  WILD \nWEST \nThe old days of the American Wild West are stuffed full of stereotypes that \nmost of us have been familiar with since we were children. Gunslingers, gamblers, \nold prospectors, saloon girls, dandies and soldiers are just a few of the many cast \nmembers found in the Wild West. The basic Western man’s outfit consisted of a \ncollarless shirt, wool pants or denim jeans (blue only), a belt or suspenders, boots \nand sometimes a vest and a coat or jacket of some sort. The two other common and \nvital elements were a wide-brimmed hat and some sort of kerchief to keep the sun \noff your head and neck. Women were still tightly corseted, and they went about \nin long skirts, fitted jackets and high-necked, long-sleeved blouses. While most \nstock outfits of the time are fairly complex, each normally had one or two \nsignificant pieces of equipment that define the wearer’s role in society. \nC ~ U N S L I N C ~ B E S  \nLets face it, the most visual cue for a gun-slinger is his (or her, thank you \nSharon Stone) gun. This cue presents a problem in live-action play, of course, \nbecause carrying actual firearms or even decent replicas in public is pretty much \nthe height of folly. It’s also not the easiest task to find guns of the appropriate \ngenre at short notice. My solution is to skip the guns and wear the belts. Wear \none as a regular belt; wear the other as a gun belt substitute. Make the substitute \nsomething wide and leather, slung low over one hip(or low on both if you want \nthe double-holster effect). Throw a long coat or duster over the whole outfit and \nhide the fact that your guns are missing. Or wear empty holsters and stuff your \nitem cards for your pistol(s) into them so that the ends show prominently. Then \nadd a bandana (tied bandit style) around your neck. \nC ~ A M  \nB L E E S  \nThese characters wear a look close to that of the gun-fighter, but with a \ntouch more style. If you think about the vital visual cues here, four come to the \n\n\nforefront: the fancy brocade vest that can be easily acqu \nshop, the bolero style cowboy hat, the string tie and some \naddiction. A deck of cards, pair of dice or a coin the cha \ngive instant hints to your character’s walk of life. \nT H E  DANDY, o R CITY- \nSLICKER \nThis common character is usually, but not always, the \nfiction. Dandy types are proper little Victorian-era clerks, \nof modern geeks. A quick fix here should include some of \nhat, marking your character as someone either just visitin \nknow any better (since seasoned Westerners wore broad-bi \nstronger western sun off their faces and necks); wire-rin \ngarters (elastic bands worn just above or below the elbow dllU U S ~ U  LO IWIU WIUK \nsuit sleeves out of your work); and finally a pocket-watch, or at least a chain \ndangling from pocket to pocket to give the appearance of a watch. If you don’t \nactually have the watch, don’t worry. A lot of the actual dandies didn’t either! \nTHE \nSALOON \nGIRL \nThis archetype represents one of the most stereotyped characters of the \nWild West. Usually presented in the movies as a pretty young thing, or at least \na still-attractive matron, a real saloon girl was not quite so glamorous. There was \nno standard uniform, other than bright, gaudy colors and as little fabric as could \nbe gotten away with in public. This standard produced dresses that had the \nsleeves cut off and the top cut down, and the full, petticoat skirts of the day were \ncut short to show off the legs. Sometimes (in very rough establishments), the \ngirls simply wore bloomers, chemises and their corsets. \nBut who cares? I’d rather take my cue from the movies, especially since that’s \nwhat people are most familiar with. So do the following: Wear something tight and \ncorset-like on top and ah11 skirt that you can gather up over your knees. Then add \nfishnet hose, with a garter around your exposed knee, and lace-up ankle boots. Pile \nyour hair up on your head, then tuck in ostrich plumes (available in most craft \nstores) and tie a length of black satin ribbon around your neck as a choker. Voila! \nAfter the Civil War (as well as during), many soldiers wanted nothing more \nthan to get away fromthe bloodshed and badmemoriesof the eastern United States. \nIn so doing, they went west to build new lives for themselves, often with nothing \nmore than the clothes on their backs. Those clothes were highly likely to be the \nuniforms they had deserted in. To emulate this look, start with either dark blue or \ndarkgray pants (chooseaside), awhiteshirt,suspendersandblackboots (ridingstyle, \nno laces). The uniform jackets are a bit harder to come by, but they aren’t necessary. \nIf you can, check out costuming supply stores for the combat uniform caps. \nSOLDIERS \nT H E   REA AT WAR \nThe most difficult thing about fast-and-easy dressing for this period is that there \nsimply aren’t many stereotypes to copy. The only solid, stable images from this time \nare those from the military services. Civilian men’s clothing was not that markedly \ndifferent from that of the Victorians who came before or the swingers of the ’20s who \nfollowed after. Women’s fashions, on the other hand, ranged all over. A woman who \nbegan the war era as a corseted Edwardian (wearing a floor-length dress covered in \n\n\nlace, with long, tight sleeves, high collar and a hat the size of a wagon wheel) could \nend it baring her arms and ankles in loose, flowing gowns that left her unrestricted. \nThe hair of the “modem” woman changed as well, moving from the long “Psyche” \nknot styles of graceful curls around the face and a loose bun wom at the back of the \nneck to chin length in permanent waves. And that was just at the beginning and the \nend of the time period. In the years between, there was no set style at all. \nMILITARY \nSERVICES \nBy far the most prevalent image associated with the Great War is that of \nmilitary service personnel. Many modem uniforms either saw their start with \nthis war or even now are at least in the “tradition” of the uniforms introduced \nhere. So the following is a short run-down of each American branch‘s uniform \nand some (hopefully) quick steps you can take to dress accordingly. \nSoldiers (or doughboys, as they were called) wore khaki-green uniforms \nthat resembled the modem dress uniform of the Royal Canadian Mounted \nPolice in a more subdued color scheme. When not in the midst of battle, soldiers \nwore “campaign hats,” rather like a khaki version of a Canadian mounty’s hat. \nDuring combat, they wore metal helmets that looked rather like an upside-down \nsoup bowl with a chin strap. \nSailors dressed in navy blue bell pants with a matching “middy” shirt that had \nfull sleeves and a white collar, square at the back and coming to a point at the front \nof the blouse. In addition, they wore the standard white sailor hat and a solid black \nkerchief tied around the neck. Sailors’ shoes were black, and this costume is \nabsolutely the only one with which it might be okay to wear black athletic shoes. \nPilots were a new breed who flew for both the Army and the Navy, as the \nAir Force did not exist yet. In addition to the well-known brown leather jacket, \ngoggles, tight-fitting leather flight helmet and white silk scarf, the uniforms’ \nshirts, ties and pants were tan in color, and the boots were dark brown. A dark \nbrown baseball jacket (no logo) would work well as a substitute for the bomber \njacket. Leather winter hunters caps (with the ear flaps) suffice as flight helmets, \nand some of the sturdier swim goggles on the market will masquerade well as \nflight goggles as long as you keep them on the helmet. \nCIVILIAN \nD R E S S ~ O R  \nMEN \nThings to look for: Men sported bowler hats, fedoras and straw “boaters” (think \nbarbershop quartets) in the summer. The silk top hat was still in vogue for evening, \nas was the walking stick. Pocket watches were still in use, and they often had small \n“Swiss Army” knives suspended from their chains. Wristwatches had also become \npopular as the war demonstrated their practicality. If you decide to wear one, go for \nthe “classic” styles that included utilitarian metal faces on leather straps. \nMen wore gloves for both day and evening. They wore thin kidskin or \nleather during the day and white fabric in the evening. They still carried \nhandkerchiefs of colored fabric (or white with a colored border) during the day \nand plain white ones during the evening. Leather wallets and billfolds had \nreplaced the earlier pocket change purse. And last, but certainly not least, the \ncigarette made it’s appearance, replacing the pipe and making way for all sorts \nof nifty cigarette carrying-cases made of polished metal or leather. Just make sure \nyou realize that it was only the cases that were cool and stylish at the time, not \nthe actual cigarettes. (Okay, sermon over.) \n\n\nC I V I L I A N  \nDRESS \nE O R  WOMEN \nAs I believe I mentioned earlier, women’s fashions of this period were all \nover the place. The corset had finally fallen out of fashion in about 1912, helped \nalong no doubt by the need to use steel for more military purposes. The \nfashionable silhouette then changed from the “S” curve (bust pushed forward, \nrear pushed backward) to a more relaxed reverse curve with shoulders comfort- \nably slouched back and the hips forward in a permanent leaning posture. \nBasic rules of dress for the look of this time are as follows: Skirt lengths should \nbe about six to eight inches above the ankle for both day and evening wear except \nfor the most formal of fashions. The tunic dress became popular at this time, so any \nsort of straight, sleeveless dress should work to emulate this style. Just remember \nthat women were glad to be rid of structured clothing, so the fashion moved away \nfrom anything form-fitting. Fabrics were soft, and they draped easily. The only \ndefinition of figure on the tunic dresses came from occasional scarves or belts at \nthe waist, usually closer to hip level than the true waistline. Many tunicdresses had \nstraight skirts and tops that bloused over the belt. \nPearl jewelry was very much in style as well. You can wear both choker and \nlong varieties of pearl or bead necklaces, and pearl and dangling earrings. \nFolding fans and paper parasols are also great accessories. Because the clothing \nbecame so simple, both jewelry and accessories became more elaborate, and that \nis the visual idea you should follow when costuming yourself for play. \nIn conclusion, there are just a couple of things I would like to add to enhance \nplaying with props. First, if you have something that you know would be just perfect \nfor your character, but you don’t want to lose it, don’t take it to the game. Leave stuff \nthat you care about at home where it’s safe and it won’t get lost. Even if you know \nyou’re careful with your stuff, sh*t happens, and it’s better to be safe than sorry. \nSecond, most of the things that I mentioned in this article can be found at \nthe following kinds of stores: craft shops (even Hobby Lobby or A.C. Moore), \nfabric stores (such as So-Fro or Northwest) and, my personal favorites, antique \nmalls, flea markets and garage sales. These stores are a goddess-send to any \ncostume designer, and I highly recommend going to as many of them as possible. \n\n\nWFRFWOLE: THF DARK AGFS \nJ \nby David “The Deuce” Kizzia \nROLEPLAYINC~ \nC~AROU \nI N T H E  DARKAC~ES \nThe Dark Ages represent the final hours of glory in the sun before the \ntwilight of the oncoming Apocalypse. In the immediate years to come, European \ncities will expand in both population and technological advancement. Hungry \nempires will cross the threshold of the Atlantic Ocean to conquer the indig- \nenous tribes of the Americas, slaughtering thousands of Wendigo Kinfolk. The \nprogress of mankind will empower the Wyrm in ways yet undreamed while \npushing Mother Gaia to the brink of Apocalypse. \nBut for now, the Wyrm is relatively hidden and the Black Spiral Dancers gather \ntheir strengths in secret. The greatest dangers for the werewolf come from the \nexpanding human population and eachother. The Church still controls the daily lives \nof all humans, from commoner to nobility. As a result, most humans are generally \nsuperstitious and suspicious of anything that seems foreign to the status quo. Anything \nfrom strange travelers from foreign lands to learned studies of medicine and astronomy \ncan be branded “the devil’s own” in these highly religious times. \nBut the greatest threat to Garou at this time comes from their fellow Garou. \nAlthough the Litany is enforced, tribes still clash violently over political issues \nlarge and small. With the exception of the Red Talons, the End Times are a \ndistant dream, uncertain at best. For now, the Garou revel in their heroic deeds \nand tales of glory, unaware the true battle lies ahead of them. . . . \nT H E  TRIBES \nAt this time, the Garou Nation is firmly led by the Silver Fang Tribe, a fact \nthat irritates the Shadow Lords to no end (and will continue to do so well into \nmodern day). Most Garou will yield judgment to the Silver Tribe simply for \nexpedience and because the Fangs will probably demand it anyway. The Shadow \nLords wait patiently for any political error or sign of weakness on the part of the \nSilver Fangs in order to unseat them from their traditional role. \nThe Fenrir maintain a healthy dislike for the Shadow Lords, feeling their \nscheming ways are a sign ofweakness. There is also bad blood between the Fenrir \nand the Fianna, who blame the Fenrir for much of their kin’s woes. Indeed, the \nFianna harbor deep-rooted resentment towards the Nordic tribe and would \nprefer nothing better than its demise. \nIn the cities, the Warders have begun to build ties with the Bone Gnawer \ntribe, finding a common bond in their mutual preference for human settlements. \nAlthough the Warders are still mistrusted and the Bone Gnawers reviled, this \nburgeoning friendship will prove more and more useful as time carries on. \nThe other tribes revere the Red Talons, although the Talons themselves have \ndeveloped a deeper dislike for the city-bound Warders. Warders smell too much \nlike humans in the Talons’ estimation, and very little good can come of that. \nFinally, all of the tribes still harbor lingering suspicions about the nomadic \nSilent Striders, unsure of their wayward travel and lack of permanency in this day. \n\n\nBLACK \nEURIES \nfiercely defending the \nChurch.

Fae remain whimsical \nand tricky to deal with, both as useful allies and problematic foes. \nThe Church: The power of the Church is both the greatest ally and foe to the \nGarou. The Church controls the Dark Medieval world completely, from its peasants \nto its royalty. High-ranking church officials wield powerful political influence and \nsway, often dictating the policy and edicts in the name of the Church's interests.

Such\"divine\" intervention, \nhowever, can easily be turned upon a band of traveling Garou as well. \nT H E  \nWYRM \nTHE DELIRIUM \nIn these days of superstitious belief, the commoner does not explain supematu- \nral encounters with the same sort of rationalizations of a modem mind. Monsters do \nindeed exist in the dark, and the Delirium does not make such encounters fade away. \nInstead, their minds react with abject terror or berserk rage, and survivors will have \na hazy, albeit skewed, retention of the encounter. The descriptions listed inLaws of \nthe Hunt remain the same, although with a different percentage rating. \n\n\nTHE UMBRA \nAlthough the rules of the spirit world have not changed much from the \nDark Ages to modem day, the Umbra of the Dark Medieval world is a much \nstronger entity. The spirits of Gaia are more populous and active, and Banes are \nfar rarer. In this pre-industrial age, the Weaver has yet to go mad in its creation \nand the Wyrm remains quiet. Thus, the spirits are in full bloom at this time. \nThe Gauntlet stands, yet its walls aren’t as thick as they eventually will be. \nMagic and mystery still populate the hidden places of the Earth that retain a \nclose bond with the spirit world. Everywhere, from the backend streets of the \nlargest European cities to the strongest of caerns, Gauntlet ratings are lowered \nby one, compared to the ranking in modern day. \nT H E  BREEDS \nH O M I D  \nHomid-born Garou walk thr \nprying and superstitious e \na hamlet or village, secrets \nGarou’s safety.

You still assign \nAttribute Traits and Ability Traits as stated on p. 28 of Laws of the Wild from \nthe lists that begin on pages 36 and 42 respectively. Obviously, some Abilities \nlisted in that book are inappropriate to a Dark Ages chronicle (such as Computer \nor Drive). CheckThe Long night forperiod-specific Abilities and Backgrounds. \n\n\nADDITIONAL \nMERITSAND \nELAWS \nChurch Rank (1-3 Trait Merit): You have become part of ranks of the \nHoly Church - \nalthough you do not necessarily share its beliefs - thereby \npossessing some of the advantages of rank. You can influence local politics to \nsome extent, and locals respect you as a representative of God. One Trait of this \nMerit might mean the character is a summoner or deacon; two would be a monk, \nnun or pardoner; three traits represent a local priest or ranking monk. Higher \nrank (abbess, bishop and so on) should only be allowed with the Storyteller’s \npermission (and at an even higher cost) - \nthese ranks carry a greater amount \nof influence and responsibility. Red Talons cannot take this Merit. \nNobility (1-3 Trait Merit): Due togdbirthing, youpossessanoble’stitleand \nenjoy the advantages thereof. One trait of this Merit translates roughly as a minor \ntitle with little prestige (like a knight). With two traits, you could be the younger \nchild of a ranking noble, and with three you might be a baron. Greater titles should \nonly be given to players at Storyteller discretion. In the Dark Medieval world, such \ntitles wield great power, but also require an equally great amount ofwork to maintain. \nThe Silver Fang Tribe expects its members to be of some sort of noble lineage and \nare often judged within their own tribe by their family’s nobility and their personal \nrank within the land. Red Talons cannot take this Merit. \nManse (2 traitMerit):Youmayownalargemanor-ahome with25 ormore \nrooms, as well as the surrounding estate. The servants, if you have any, are provided \nfor you if you have the Merit, although they cannot be Kinfolk unless additional \npoints are spent. Nobility and great tracks of land often go hand in hand. \nSpy Network: ( 2  trait Merit) You begin play with access to a group of \nhumans who frequently bring you information. Their information is up-to-date \nand fairly reliable. Many Shadow Lords groom such networks specifically to \nmaintain control over their territories. \nSecond-Class Citizen ( 2  trait Flaw): The simple happenstance ofbirth has \nmade you a second-class citizen in Medieval Europe. This tends to appear in two \nforms. First, you might be female: Mortal men treat you as a natural inferior, and \nmany Garou may also discriminate against you. \nAlternately, you might be a member of a disliked or persecuted social group, \nand your appearance, speech or local reputation marks you as a member of this \ngroup. You are excluded from local politics and are distrusted by most locals. \nBear in mind, with the exception of the Black Furies, you need not take this \nFlaw. Take this Flaw only if you want to roleplay a Garou at a social disadvan- \ntage. Silver Fangs cannot take this Flaw. \nDark Prophecy (2 point Flaw): Like the Red Talon tribe, you experience \nvisions of the horrors to come in future days when the Wyrm runs rampant across \nGaia and the Garou are helpless to stop the gradual degeneracy of all humanity. \nRed Talons cannot take this Flaw. \nDARK \nA ~ E S  \nGUTS \nMany of theGifts inuseduringthemodemperiodhaveexistedsin~timeoutofmind. \nTherefore,thmeGlftsapplyjustaseasilytoaDarkAgeschronicle.Tnechangmgtim~d \nsee most of these Gifts replaced or adapted. Most modem Gifts (excludmg ones that affect \nor rely on modem technology) in Laws of the Wild are available to Dark Ages Garou. \n\n\nB R E E D  \nC ~ I E T S  \nLupus \nBasic \nSense Prey: This Gift allows the Garou the ability find prey for feeding purposes \nafter the player wins or ties a Static Mental Test against five Traits. This Glft can only \nbe used in the forest setting, and humans are not considered “prey” for feeding purposes. \nThe Gifts available to this cursed and scorned breed are no different than \nMETIS \nthose available to modern-day metis Garou. \nHOMID \nIntermediate \nSpeech of the World This slft allows the Garou to speak any human language she \nencounters, albeit with a slight accent, as long as the player spends one Mental Trait. \nAUSPICE \nC ~ I E T S  \nSince the responsibilities of the auspices have not undergone significant change, \nthe Gifts allotted to the auspices have not done so either. The Theurge and Philcdox \nGifts, for example, are entirely the same now as they were during the Dark Ages. \nRAGABASH \nBasic \nSnow Running: Heavy snow can immobilize an entire village or even stop \na traveling wolf pack. With this Gift, a Garou may run across ice or snow as if \nit were solid ground, neither sinking nor leaving tracks. The player must spend \none Gnosis Trait in order to activate this Gift. \nIntermediate \nReynard’s Lie: With this gift, even the greatest of the Ragabash’s blatant \nlies will believed (at least for a while). The Ragabash’s player must beat the \nlistener in a Mental Challenge after telling a lie. If the speaker does so, the \nlistener will believe the lie he just heard, no matter how predisposed he might \nhave been to distrust the speaker beforehand. \nSALLIARD \nAdvanced \nCall for Vengeance: Rather than the modem Gift: Head Games, Dark Ages \nGarou learn this Gift. When a traitor to Gaia is to be punished, the Galliard howls this \ncall to all Garou who’ll listen. The player spends a Rage Trait and a Willpower Trait, \nthen engages the traitor in a Social Challenge. If the traitor loses the test, he cannot \nspend Willpower Traits for the rest of the session (or the next week ofgame time), and \nhe is one Trait down in all Social Challenges. Loyal The call does not compel loyal \nGarou who hear it to hunt down the traitor, but the invitation to do so is plain. \nAHROUN \nIntermediate \nGift of the Salamander: Since silver is not as ubiquitous a threat as it is \ntoday, the Ahroun auspice has not yet developed the Gift: Sense Silver. Instead, \nMany Ahroun Garou learn this Gift. With it, an Ahroun becomes virtually \n\n\nimpervious to flame. After the player spends a Rage Trait, the invulnerability \nlasts the duration of the scene. Withstanding extremely intense flames (such as \nhaving a burning building collapse on a character) may require the expenditure \nof further Traits, at the Storyteller’s discretion. \nTRIBE \nGIFTS \nBLACK FURIES \nMan’s Skin: The \ntional” stereotypes for the \nan onlooker to pierce the illu \nIntermediate \nctivate thisGift.

This piece \ncomesinfromPeter Woodworth, who’s madeammefor himselfwritingMind’s \nEye TheatrematerialsuchasTheShiningHost andLawsoftheEast. Now, \nPete shows that he can write fiction as well as gamespeak, with this tale about the \ndifference between idealism and activism in the World of Darkness. \nNo one else cared. That was what really bothered him. \nNo one cared, God damn it! \nMichael flowed gracefully out of the muddy ocean of people washing down \nthe dirty avenue and into the dark, swirling tidal pool of the alley. Only one other \nperson seemed to visibly notice, and that one only gave him a look of complete \nincredulity. Seduced by the lullaby whispers of their television screens, most \npeople didn’t believe such places still exist - \nif they ever did. They thought that \nback-alley crimes existed only in film noir and clich6 television scripts. \nBullshit. \nMichael’s trained eyes adjusted to the gloom as easily as another person would to \nturning on the lights in a room, bringing the familiar scene into its full, pitiful clarity. \nThree actors this time: a gangly reed of a boy lurking inside his battered leather and \nborrowed pride, an obviously dope-sick girl standing two paces behind him and a \ncringing mess of bloody denim Michael took to be male from the sound of the cries. \nThe girl was holding a shaking knife as her boy gave their victim a vicious kick to the \nribs, not seeming to notice even as Michael increased his pace to intervene. That was \nanother comfortable fiction of popular culture. People assume that girlfriends of even \nthe worst sorts of scum would always hang back from an attack, pulling on their \nboyfnend’s arm and saying stupid things like, “We got the money, Brett, just let him \ngo,” or “Stop it, Slash, you don’t need to hurt him that badly.” \nNor was their victim the usual poor-but-noble old lady or hapless wide-eyed \ntourist. By the look of him, he knew the intimate thrill of the needle better than \nhis attackers. His skin stretched like lifeless white parchment pockmarked with \nfresh bruises and old needle tracks like a masochist’s map. That was exactly why \nit was so easy for everyone else to ignore them, really. They were no one anyone \nwould miss, doing things no one approved of, and if they fought and killed each \nother doing it, so what? Best instead to just keep your feet moving, keep your \nhead down, cross your fingers and pray to God that when your time came, you \nwouldn’t be the one everyone else pretended not to have heard. \nBut Michael always heard. \nWhen he finally reached the scene, he didn’t try to stop and reason with \nanyone. One of the first things he’d learned when he’d joined the Guardian \nAngels was that if the perpetrators were this far gone, pat little speeches and \nplatitudes were less than useless. No, this was a different sort of intervention. \nIn his more darkly introspective moments, Michael liked to think that this \naction was the last resort of civilization. It was a demonstration that lawlessness \nc \nM I N D ’ S  EYE T H E A T R E  JOURNAL \n@ \n\n\nsimply will not be permitted; the punishment for violation would be swift and \novert. So when the boy finally noticed him and turned with fists raised, Michael \nsimply took one step forward, grabbed the kid’s wrist and performed a deft magic \ntrick with it. One second the boy was on his feet and yelling, and the next he was \nlying on his back clutching his fractured forearm. \nIgnoring the boy’s surprised wailing, Michaelusedone hand to toss aside the \ngirl’s dirty knife, and he sent the other solidly into her solar plexus. She went \ndown with a thin cough, gasping for air. Sparing a speculative glance at her \nhowling boyfriend, Michael knelt by her side. Taking her chin in his hands, \nMichael burned his gaze deep into her eyes, willing her to see the righteous fury \nand absolute disgust she inspired in him. It had an immediate effect. Her eyes \nwidened, first in shock, then in absolute, naked terror. \n“DO you have any drugs?” he demanded. “Money?” \nThe girl nodded. Michael held out his hand, and she put a small bag of coke \n(just residue really) and a pair of crumpled twenties in it. Michael tore the money \nin half with a practiced twist and ground the baggie to pieces beneath his boot. \n“Him?“ She shook her head violently. He couldn’t tell if she was lying or not, but \nhe wagered she wouldn’t risk it in her condition. He’d made his pint now anyway. \n“Leave,” Michael said, his voice as calm and measured as the morning news \nanchor reading the weather report. “If either of you ever comes back to this \nneighborhood, I’ll know, and this pain will be a skinned knee compared to what \nyou’ll feel. Understand me? I’ll be wuiting.” The girl nodded with tears running \ndown her cheeks. “Now go.” \nShe stumbled crazily to her feet, paused just long enough to haul her boy up \nwhere she could shoulder his weight. The two of them limped out of the alley \nand away into the night, hopefully never to return. Michael listened to the \nsounds of them fading, then headed over to their victim. The boy was younger \nthan he’d thought at first and had been plenty sick on something before they’d \ngotten to him. He barely seemed to register anything at all, even as Michael \ncalled for the ambulance on his cell phone. \n‘Ws okay, buddy,” he said gently. The rage he’d felt a moment before evaporated, \nrevealing nothing but caring concern beneath. “Help is on the way, I promise.” \nThe boy turned to look at him as Michael leaned down. His left eye -the one \nthat wasn’t swollen shut - \nwas glazed, but it still tried to cling to lucidity. Michael \nsaw real and immediate fear growing there. The kid whimpered like a rabbit, and his \npurple, dislocated jaw kept trying to move. He clutched Michael’s arm with thin \nfingers, his lips moving ever so slightly, rasping words that were not quite sound. \n“Don’t let them take me.” \nW s  all right, friend,” Michael assured him between the directions he gave \nThe kid shook his head, fighting to keep his eyes open. “They’re watching.” \n“You’re going to be fine,” Michael said again, hanging up on the operator. \n“Those two won’t be back to bother you any more.” \nWithout responding, the boy relaxed against the wet concrete and closed \nhis eye. Unconsciousness had finally taken him. Just for safety’s sake, Michael \nkept looking around for the attackers’ return until the ambulance arrived. \nthe emergency operator on the phone. “They’re gone now.” \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \nO N  T H E  SIDE of T H E  ANGELS \ne \n\n\n“You’re late,” Marsilio chided him half an hour later. \nMichael looked away, embarrassed. “Sorry. Something came up that I had \nto take care of.” He bowed his head, and shame burned him. \nTo his relief, Marsilio waved the matter away. “NO matter, Michael, no \nmatter. I was just discussing some ventures with an associate anyway.” \nMichael couldn’t suppress a quick frown at that. He had seen Nigel - \nthe wiry \nEnglishman who had started keeping the company books a little over two weeks ago \n- \nleaving as he was coming in, and he had gotten the same false smile and dead eyes \nfrom Nigel that he always did. Of course a man in Nigel’s position had every right \nto be in conference with Marsilio whenever the latter so chose, but something about \nNigel’s look unsettled Michael just the same. Jealousy, maybe? Somehow, Michael \ndidn’t doubt it, but he’d also never had much time for those games before. \nPersonal politics always irritated him. He’d originally joined the Guardian \nAngels because they offered a chance to make a real, concrete difference in people’s \nlives instead of simply adding to the corrupt web of red tape that neatly entangled \nand eviscerated the so-called “social initiatives” that the city council was always \npushing. The trick was using one’s fists effectively and not adding to the violence. \nHaving learned to do so, Michael’s skill and tolerance for social maneuvering had \ndriedup, leaving him edgy and tense whenever he suspected that it was at work. Now \nthat he worked for Marsilio, however, petty politicking had become a necessary skill. \nEveryone in the organization wanted the boss’ ear or a piece of his time. \n“Is something upsetting you?” Marsilio asked, looking at him closely. \n“There is, sir.” Michael licked his lips. He felt like he was doing something \ndirty, but he couldn’t ignore what was building up in the back of his mind any \nlonger. “A problem.” \nOne fine eyebrow went up. “Oh? And what might that be?” \n“The real reason I was - \nthat is, I’ve been - \nI mean-” \nMichael shifted \nnervously from foot to foot under the weight of Marsilio’s gaze, took a deep \nbreath, and pulled his focus back together. “I’ve heard some rumors lately, sir. \nI was checking into them when I was delayed.” \nMarsilio leaned forward with a concerned frown on his face. “‘Checking into \nthem’? What does that mean? What kind of things are you talking about, Michael?“ \nIt took all of his will, but Michael didn’t break eye contact. “I’ve started \nhearing word on the street, sir, that says this company isn’t just running renovation \nefforts anymore.” Marsilio looked at him blankly, waiting. His tongue grew \nsluggish, unwilling to pronounce the words he was compelling it to say. \n“Sir, what I’m saying is that I’ve heard there are all sorts of things going on: \nextortion, loawsharking, prostitution, bribery.” He shook his head. “I’ve even \nheard that some kind of cult has started kidnapping people off our streets!” His \ntone became even more sincere, pleading for acceptance. “Growing up in the \ncity, I learned something about rumors, sir. Hear something once, ignore it. Hear \nit twice, remember it. Hear it three times.. .?” \n“Is this laundry list supposed to be an accusation of some kind?” Marsilio’s \ntone was measured, but menace simmered beneath its surface, barely restrained. \nMichael flinched away from the force of the emotion. \n“Not against you specifically, sir,” Michael said quickly, horrified that he \nmight have implied as much. “But it’s just that there have been a lot of new faces \nMIND’S EYE THEATRE \nJOURNAL \n\n\nin the building lately, and I’m not sure if, well, maybe all of them have been \nchecked out as thoroughly as they should have been.” \nThat wasn’t nearly as strong as he’d wanted to make it. Michael had strongly \nsuspected some of the new employees were up to no good from the first moment he saw \nthem. It was the most forceful charge he could manage under that burning stare, however. \nMarsilio held his gaze a moment longer, then sighed and leaned back in his \nchair. “Michael, do you suppose you are the sole reason that this neighborhood \nhas gone from one of New York‘s worst to one of its fastest-growing enterprise \nzones in the year my company has been here?” \nHumiliation touched his cheeks. “No, sir, but-” \nMarsilio held up a hand. “Please. I didn’t mean to insult you.” A wry smile \ntwitched at the comers of his mouth. “You’re my most trusted lieutenant, Michael, \nand I hope you know that. Without your expert assistance and the aid of your other \nGuardian Angel friends, I never would have known where to start in a place like this \nneighborhood used to be, let alone been able to purge it of the filth that infested it.” \nEven as Michael’s heart swelled with pride, however, Marsilio’s smile fell \naway. “But as my representative to the community, your presence is required \nthere most of the time. Where does that leave me?Or the times when I need help \nwith something more esoteric, like a federal tax form?” Marsilio shrugged. “DO \nyou see where this is leading, Michael? We’re agrowing company. I need to bring \nin new people to make it work.” The smile returned. “I always need new people.” \nThat just about sealed thediscussion, but part o fMichael’s mindstillwouldn’t relent. \n“Yes, sir, I understand, but there haw been a lot of new projects, and as far as I can see, \nnot all of them seem to be in line with what the company goals have been in the past.“ \nHe paused, realizing his hands were shaking. “For instance, why did the company \nbuy the Jackson Apartments? I thought we were just supposed to renovate them.” \nTo Michael’s surprise, Marsilio actually laughed. “Well, you didn’t think we’d \njust keep putting up new storefronts and locking up hoodlums forever, did you?The \ncity’sdone that for ages, andlookat how little progress has beenmade! No, my friend, \nthat’s just the beginning. Ifwe’re going to make adifference here, we’regoing to have \nto start investing in other areas.” He gestured to the door. ‘That’s why Nigel was just \nhere, in fact. We were discussing diversifytng our assets, getting more involved in \nday-to-day life instead of just putting up buildings for people to fill.” \nHe rubbed his chin thoughtfully. “Still, perhaps I should’ve been more \ncautious in hiring. I’ll tell you what, I’ll personally do a review of all our \nemployees and their current projects, and if anything comes up suspicious, I’ll \nlet you know and we can work out a solution. Does that sound good?” Michael \nnodded slowly, and Marsilio gave him a radiantly apologetic smile. “I’m sorry if \nI haven’t kept you as updated as I should have.” \n“No, really, sir, don’t worry about it,” Michael said, hanging his head. What \nwas he thinking, bringing this up without all the facts? “I just wanted to make \nsure things weren’t being overlooked, that’s all.” \n“Don’t worry about it. It’s that kind of dedication I selected you for, Michael.” \nWith the matter apparently concluded, Marsilio rose and went to the window, \nwhich overlooked one of the many restoration projects the company sponsored in \nthe neighborhood. He clasped his hands behind his back like a lecturing professor, \nrubbing the impressive gold ring on his right hand idly. The ring was the only display \nO N  T H E  S I D E  O f  T H E  ANGELS \n@ \n\n\nof anything approaching ostentation that Marsilio ever allowed himself. “I have \nsome business I want you to attend to, Michael. Very important business.” \nMichael drew himself up straighter. “What is it?” \n“Rumors have arisen of another gang trying to move into this neighborhood. \nThey call themselves the ‘Midnight Killaz,’ or some such nonsense, and they have \nmade it clear that they wish to begin pushing poison in this territory.” A hint of \nanger crept into Marsilio’s voice, and Michael took a step back. That was more \nemotion than nearly anything ever evoked in his reserved superior, and the \nthought of Marsilio’s full fury shook him with fright. “Perhaps they assume that the \nneighborhood is free for them to claim since we disposed of the last bunch.” His \neyes, hard before, took on the cold sheen of gun barrels as he looked across his desk \nat his favorite lieutenant. “Prove them wrong, Michael. Before this happens \nagain.” Long fingers pushed a newspaper clipping across the table. \nMichael didn’t need to see what it was. Two nights ago, a poor couple and their \nthree young children had been found shot to death, apparently for complaining to \nthe police about men who were dealing out of the apartment down the hall. Michael \nhad known the couple himself; they had been early supporters when Marsilio began \nthe plan to revitalize the neighborhood and drive out the criminal element it \ncontained. New York at large had relegated the killing to the isn’t-that-horrible \nworld of page three in the press, quick to chalk it up to the daily horrors of the \nnotorious South Bronx. Michael himself had even believed it to be a random act of \nviolence, brutal and deserving of the full extent of the justice they could muster, but \nessentially an isolated, senseless, horrible and still all-too-common incident. \nBut this news changed everything. \n“I’ll take care of it, sir,” he said. “Don’t worry.” \nHe felt the familiar righteous fury building within, tempered by the \nknowledge that now he knew where to direct it. A plan of action began forming \nas he contemplated the different tactics he’d have to use. This many enemies \nmight call for some outside help, but he knew where to get that, too. He found \nhimself gazing at the tiny golden cobra that adorned Marsilio’s finger and \nthinking that was exactly the right symbol for their operation: fast, decisive and \nvery, very deadly. “They don’t have long now.” \nMarsilio smiled at him, and Michael’s spirit soared with pride. “Very good. \nTake these with you, then, and give them to your allies before the battle. It will \nhelp fortify them for the rigors of combat, as it does for you.” \nMarsilio extended a hand, revealing a number of small vials filled with dark \nred liquid, and Michael felt the craving within him leap even as he pocketed \nthem. Marsilio hitched off his suit jacket languidly and rolled up the sleeve of \nhis silk shirt. He then pierced his wrist with the stylized fangs on his ring and \noffered the crimson wound to Michael as casually as a mortal might offer a tray \nof hors d’oeuvres at a party. “Of course, you must be thirsty as well.” \nHe hadn’t even finished before Michael fell upon his wrist, drinking deeply \nof the blood he had missed and wondering how he had gone so long without it. \nSomething within Michael wanted to hesitate, wondering at the justice of \ngiving his friends such a gift without their knowledge, but such concerns were \ninsignificant next to his need for the blood. He’d do whatever Marsilio wanted, \nas long as he could keep coming back like this. \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \nMIND’S \nBYE THEATRE \nJOURNAL \n@ \n\n\nThree days passed, but not idly. \n“It’s a dangerous mission, no doubt about it,” Michael concluded, stretching a \nbit. The entire briefing and planning had taken well over two hours, and he felt like \nhe imagined a sergeant must feel before asking his men to overtake an intimidating \nenemy position. “I know just about everyone here, and I know that together we’ve \nall seen some rough places before, but everybody has a breaking point, and I respect \nthat. Recon work is one thing, but this is a lot rougher. If anyone wants out now, feel \nfree to go. There’s no shame in knowing when the water’s gotten too hot for you.” \nHe looked out at the assembled Guardian Angels, but none of them quite \nmet hisgaze. In fact, they haddone very littleduring the presentationofthe plan, \nexcept to murmur a few questions here and there. Michael frowned; solemnity \nwas fine in the face of danger, but this reticence wasn’t like them. Had he \nembarrassed them when he offered them an out? \n“Well? Anyone?” \nNobody budged. \n“C‘mon, guys, talk to me.” He tried to make his words friendly, and a few pairs \nof eyes swiveled his way, but none of them held his own for more than a second. \nMichael felt his temper rising, and he clenched his fists at his side. “Nobody?” \nThis was crazy. Sure, he hadn’t been around as often since taking Marsilio’s \njob offer, but he couldn’t imagine a response like this. “OK! If no one here is \nwilling to commit to finishing this, then I guess I’ll just have to go to the \ncompany and ask them for help. How about that?” \nAfewheadsjerkedupinresponse, wide-eyed,andhecouldfeelthereferencesizzle \nthrough the rmm like electricity. There was another moment of shuffling silence at \nthat, but this time all the eyes returned to him. At last, Pat - \nwho’d been Michael‘s \nfriend since they joined the Angels together - \nstood up. All eyes turned his way. \n“If it’s that important,” Pat said, not holding eye contact with Michael for \nmore than a second, “we’re in. Right?” He looked at the other Angels one by one, \nand they all gave Pat the grudging assent they had been withholdingfromMichae1. \n“Well, thank you, guys,”Michael said, glad that everyone seemed to be back \nin his camp. He checked his watch. “OK! We’ll plan on arriving at just before \none and getting out of there by quarter after one at the latest. Sound good?” \nEveryone nodded, if not overly eagerly. \n“Now, how about a little hot toast before we go out into the cold night, eh?” \nHis own loud laugh drowned out the desultory response from the others, but \nMichael wouldn’t have cared either way. This phase was too critical to allow a \nlukewarm reaction to spook him. He produced and passed around the prepara- \ntory nip of hot cider he’d brought along. \nAs they drank, Michael found himself on the verge of mentioning something \nabout the toast being really “special” - \nconsidering what he’d spiked the cider with \n-but he caught the thought before it could escape his lips. He knew what Marsilio \nwould think of him revealing his nature to others, and his cheeks colored in shame \nat how he nearly let Marsilio down yet again. A part of him distantly felt bad about \nnot telling these men about what he was doing to them, but that part fell silent soon \nenough. After all, he thought, this was war of a kind, and that meant he was morally \nobligated to do anything necessary for his soldiers to stay alive. And to win. \nEven if they didn’t know exactly what kind of aid he was offering. \nO N  T H E  S I D E  O I  T H E  A N ~ E L S  \n\n\n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \nAs a rule, the Guardian Angels never carry weapons. That decision was as much \na point of pride as it was practical, really. Walking through a rough neighborhood with \na weapon on your belt not only begs any number ofproblems with police, possibly being \nmistaken for a criminal yourself, but it also makes you an immediate lethal threat to \nany criminals you come across. A gun’s a gun, after all, and not many criminals have \na problem drawing on someone who’s also strapped. But walk through unarmed, and \nnot only are you daring them to pull their weapon on an unarmed opponent, you’re \nalso makiig a statement about how committed you are to what you’re doing. \nKeeping that factor in mind, Michael and Pat had spent that much extra time \nplanning, making sure the Angels would have the advantage of surprise long \nenough to get to close quarters with the gang members as fast as possible. At that \nrange, the chances of any of the Angels suffering serious injury were as low as they \nwere going to get. Operating unarmed is one thing, but going into danger \ndefenseless is something else entirely. Fortunately, like a lot of young, overconfi- \ndent toughs, the building the Midnight Killaz had picked to occupy was a poorly \ndefensible structure. A quick recon of the area showed that not only had they left \na back entrance poorly guarded by one slack and restless sentry, but the rest of them \nwere either thoroughly stoned or well on their way there by one o’clock. \nOnly one complication arose. Two of the gang members weren’t there - \nprobably out checking on dealers or the like - \nbut the Angels would simply have \nto let that slide. Two Angels out of the 10 stayed out front as lookouts and drivers, \nand the entire force was equipped with walkie-talkies for constant communica- \ntion. Michael further divided the group into two teams, each responsible for a \nfloor, and he outlined their plan of attack in blocks as small as 10 or 20 seconds \neach, making the plan as precise and airtight as possible. Time frame for the whole \noperation: ten minutes maximum, then they were gone, just in case any unex- \npected company decided to drop in or anything else went wrong. They went over \nit enough that when the plan actually went into effect, it was almost routine. \nThe true irony of a well-planned combat situation is that there’s usually not much \nto see. In fact, if a plan goes really well, chances are that nobody else around will know \nexactlywhat’shapeneduntilmuch, \nmuch later. In thiscase, it wasover ineghtminutes, \nthuty-four seconds, including the time spent gemng to and from the two old vans the \nAngels had borrowed for transportation. Even the bnef “chat” Michael had with the \nassembled Killaz - \nonce they had been properly sutxlued, of course - \nended swiftly. \nIt had gone off almat entirely without a hitch; one gang member, apparently less \nstoned than his friends, had actually managed to pull his pistol out and disengage the \nsafety before Michael got to him and wrestled him to the ground. The punk wound up \neamingashattmedwrist, adislocatedkneeandamouthfuloflcae teethforhisalemess. \nOther than that one flash of danger, however, the entire experience was simply \na rush of reeking rooms, moldy hallways, yelling gang members, shrieking gang \ngirlfnends and a flurry of confiscation and destruction of drugs and drug money. The \nother Angels kept a scowling guard as Michael summoned every shred of anger and \noutrage he had and turned it loose on the kneeling Killaz. Marsilio had taught him \nhow to add a supernatural degree of intimidation to his words if he concentrated, and \nhe used it to full effect that night. The weeping, terrified young men confessed \neverything and swore on their own souls that they would let the Angels turn their \nguilty members in to the police while the others left the neighborhood for good. \nM I N D ’ S  E Y E  T H E A T n E  JOURNAL \n\n\nAfter some judicious extra punches and kicks - \nnot too much but enough to drive \nthe point home - \nthe Angels were gone back into the night, escorting two broken \nmen and leaving behind a crowd of staggering, weeping criminals. \nAll in all, agood night’s work, Michael thought as he left the two Killaz with \nthe police. Justice had been served, and he was as certain as he was sitting there \nthat they’d never see any of those kids again- and quite probably no other gangs \nlike them, either. As dawn crept up and Michael retreated to his apartment to \nsleep, the vivid afterglow of victory kept from his mind the dark, nagging \nthoughts of what he had done to his friends, and he thought nothing of it. \nAfter all, a win’s a win, right? \nAfew nightslater, Michael tookanunscheduledpatrol, just walking and reveling \nin the feeling of freedom that always accompanied defeating another menace to the \nsanctity of the neighborhood. He was in such a good mood that he didn’t even notice \nthe strange emptines of the streets. An old reflex simply chalked it up to the perpetual \nhostility most residents displayed as a natural defense mechanism. It was such an \ningrained instinct, in fact, that he never even questioned why they would still have \nsuch an outlook when he had been helping make their neighborhood safe all this time. \nOld habits born from self-preservation died hard, and Michael didn’t begrudge the \nneighborhood people any of them. He actually whistled a little as he walked. \nEven when the first lookout bolted at the sight of him, he didn’t think too much \nof it. He simply focused his thoughts and followed the kid’s footsteps down a pair of \nalleys and side streets. The boy was obviously a green recruit; experienced lookouts \ndidn’t budge from their posts until absolutely certain they had been made. And most \nrelayed their messages by walkie talkie thesedays insteadofbywordofmouth. So when \nthe boy ducked through a network of rotting boards into a decaying brownstone, \nMichael didn’t hesitate to follow, convinced he’d ruin the night of agroup of huddled \npipeheads or, at most, a small-time dealer. He did notice that he passed the faded sign \nannouncing he was welcome to the Jackson Apartment building - \n“soon to be re- \nopened by the friendly community builders at New Horizon Enterprises” - \nbut that \nfactjustmadehimmoredeterminedandlescautious.Someverminhadactual1ymade \na nest in the very building Marsilio had just bought for renovations. Michael moved \nforward, determined to teach them the error of their ways. \ne \ne \ne \ne \ne \nWhich is precisely how he ran into something most unexpected. \nHe had scarcely taken two steps into the darkness of the building when he \ncame across a thick, moldering maroon curtain, which someone had apparently \ndrawn across the hallway in an attempt to block out the chill. Brushing it aside, \nMichael managed only a handhlofadditional stepsbeforecoming to a thunderstruck \nhalt. His fists, raised high and ready, wavered, faltered and finally fell to his sides. \nThere were renovations going on inside this building all right, but not any \nMichael suspected would be on any construction invoice. The downstairs \ndividing walls had been ripped away to create one large common room that was \nnow alight with dozens of tiny red candles. The candles cast shadows in a shifting \nphantasmagoria around the room, and a black altar stood at the far end, flanked \nby two tall poles stylized to resemble giant, golden serpents. \nDozens ofpeople knelt in rows before the altar, dressed in simple white robes \nintermittently streaked with red. The smell ofblood hit him so strongly he nearly \nstaggered. As he entered, the people turned to face him, and Michael saw the \n~~ \nON T H E  SIDE O P  T H E  ANGELS \n\n\nfamiliar faces of a score of neighborhood families and business owners gazing \nback at him. Even the junkie boy he had saved from muggers less than a week \nago peered at him with bored anticipation. Their faces were blankly curious, like \nchildren teasing animals at the zoo. \nOther people were arrayed around the kneeling crowd, seemingly watching \nthem. These individuals wore sickly green robes with gold trim, and each had a \nhood drawn down to hide his face. It was behind one of these latter types that \nthe lookout was cowering. The figure advanced on him slowly, and his nearness \nfinally roused Michael from his stunned fugue. \n“What the hell is going on?” he yelled, raising his arms defensively but \nfeeling his words fall oddly flat even as he let them fly. “What do you think you’re \ndoing to these people?” \nThe figure before him said nothing in response. He only raised his hands and \nlet his hood fall limply back. Michael felt his reaction like a punch to the gut; \nPat’s face stared expressionlessly at him, still touched by the signs of life but pale \nas a dying junkie’s and utterly calm. A spot of fresh blood lay on the comer of \nhis mouth, and he licked his lips, obviously savoring the taste. When the others \nremoved their hoods as well, Michael saw the faces of his former Angel \ncomrades. They surrounded him like a damned Greek chorus. \n“How?” was all he could manage, looking at the familiar faces and wonder- \ning whether this nightmare would dissolve into wakefulness soon. \n“This neighborhood needed a new beginning,” another voice said. It came from \nacross the room, from yet another hooded figure perched behind the altar like some \ndemented caricature of a televangelist. The room’s - \nthe mpk’s - \nacoustics \ndistorted the voice into an oddly echoing bass that Michael had never heard before. \n“These people were going nowhere. They live in decaying buildings, \ndestroying themselves with drink and drugs, allowing gangs to rule them like \nfeudal lords. It was time for a change, and thanks to the tireless efforts of you and \nyour friends, they finally got one.” Silence reigned for just a fraction of asecond, \nbut in that time, Michael could swear he felt the darkness smile. \n“NOW their streets are cleared of scum and crime, their buildings are being \nrenovated, andtheirbodiesgrowstrongon \nthe offerings Igive them. Only the most \nfoolhardy would dare to intrude on this territory after your.. . examples. We’re free \nto move to the next step of the process.” The figure gestured broadly at the roomful \nof huddled supplicants, revealing slowly bleeding wounds in his palms as he did so. \nAt the sight of the blood, the crowd moaned with longing, and even the other \nrobed figures appeared entranced. “This is just the next phase in their evolution; \na new spirituality, to replace the one that failed them so miserably before. It’s not \nso much to ask after all that we’ve done for them, don’t you think?” \nMichael stood still, unable to think, let alone respond. \n“So come join us, Michael. You’re due for a promotion, if anything, and \nyou’ve been such a help so far, it would be a shame to have to release you now.” \nThe figure gestured, and Michael felt the tug in his blood drawing him near. One \nlast pause, one that set his teeth on edge, ready to loose a scream. “No secrets \nanymore, right, Michael?” But Michael didn’t look as the figure pulled back his \nhood. Michael didn’t need to see the figure behind the altar to know who it was. \nHe had already recognized the ring on his finger. \nt \ni \nMIND’S Erg THFATBF \nJOUBNAL \n\n\nO T H F R  CHILDRFN Of!

However, conservation ofspace \n(and trees) often forb& us from doing so. With the advent of the Journal, \nhowever, we can - \nas the back cover proclaims - \npick up where our other \nbooks leave off. In this article, we take a look at some of the m e  \nunusual shen \nwho didn’t make it into Laws of the East. \nD H A M P Y R S  \nC H I L D R E N O Z T H I  LIVINC~ \nDEATH \nWhile such an event is rare, the union of a Kuei-jin and a mortal sometimes \nprcduces a child. Born of work both living and dead, these beings grow up with a \nmeasure of the blessings Heaven has conferred upon their vampiric parent.. . as well \nas a touch of the curse. Known as dhampyrs, these creatures typically grow up in a \nshadowy worldbetween theeveryday ltfeof their mortalparent andthesavage splendor \nof the courts of the Kuei-jin, fully accepted by neither. Their long life spans, touch of \nsupernatural power and residual evil of the P’o withii set them apart from ordinary \nmortals from a relatively early age. And yet, the Kuei-jin view them as vastly lesser \nbeings and seldom take notice of them except to exploit their daylight capabilities. \nFurthermore, when one or more parents isn’t available during the daytime \nand has a good chance of tearing apart a friend or playmate from time to time, \ndhampyrs tend to grow up in a bizarre environment simultaneously filled with \nintense fear and overpowering love. Such a polarized upbringing is hard on \ndhampyrs, and many of them only become more bitter as time goes on. They \nwatch their mortal friends age and die before their eyes, and they turn away from \nall emotions in hopes of finding some means of stemming the pain of the loss. \nMost dhampyrs do not wish to take part in the games of the Kuei-jin, but after \nthey witness the dissolution of everything mortal they once knew, they take \ntheir place in the courts. They realize that the immortal plots of the vampires are \nthe only constant they can ever expect to last. \nFor their part, the Kuei-j in often employ capable dhampyrs as servants, spies \nand even assassins. (A killer who walks the day has a real advantage over \nvampires!) They even grant some dhampyrs the title of heimin both as \nrecognition for their service and a means of calling on them for aid. Like their \ncounterparts in the West, the ghouls and revenants, dhampyrs often exist in the \nshadow of their more powerful relatives. Yet, unlike the pathetic lap dogs of the \nKin-jin, a dhampyr who comes of age needs not rely on any undead patron to \nsecure her destiny; she is free to walk her own path. \n(At least in theory. Some Kuei-jin seek the creation of dhampyr children \nfor just such daylight services, and they have strong opinions about letting their \nprogeny simply walk away from them!) \n\n\nundead kin may even find themselves declared akuma, necessitating a quick flight \nto avoid an unpleasant fate at the hands of the undead. No matter how well they may \nthink the Kuei-jin esteem them, all dhampyrs must remember that their position is \never a hair’s breadth from disaster. The Kuei-jin are notoriously unforgiving, \nespecially with those they consider to literally embody the concept of “half-person.” \nIt’s no wonder, then, that many Shade Walkers strike out on their own in some \nform or another, selling their services to the highest bidder or even simply seeking to \nfind the solution to the problems raised by their unique state. In many ways, dhampyrs \nfind themselves in analogous situations to children of extremely wealthy means. They \nare distanced from most ordinary folks by the very circumstances of their birth, and yet, \nthey must also deal with “parents” who have little consideration for the their own \nambitions and dreams. Indeed, conceived as mere tools, dhampyrs must struggle hard \nto establish themselves and their own identity away from the courts. They must learn \nhow to cope with passion when almost everything they see around them is fleetmg. \nThey must manage the powers they have without encouraging the Demon to new \nheights of evil. It is a constant struggle just figuring out how to place themselves m a \nworld that always seem to be either moving too quickly or too slowly for them. \n(Andbefore anyone asks, no, there havenever beenanydhampyr Shih, and there \nnever should be unless the Storyteller is in the mood to add a ridiculously powerful and \noverly cinematic character to the game. For those still interested, the screening \nprocesses of SFO would detect a dhampyr early on, which would mean a short trip to \nthe vivisection chamber for the unfortunate Shade Walker caught in their clutches.) \nHowever, for players seeking a change of pace or who wish to explore some \nof the dark alleys and hidden places of the Kuei-jin world, dhampyrs present an \ninteresting dimension to any Laws of the East game. \nFor more on dhampyrs and their relations to the Kuei-jin, see the Kindred \nof the East Companion. \nDHAMPYR \nCHARACTER \nCREATION \nDhampyrs should use the rules for creating mortals found in Laws of the \nHunt, with the following alterations: \nDhampyr characters receive 7/5/3 for their starting Attributes; the blood \nof the immortals within them makes them slightly stronger than most beings. \nDhampyrs may have a maximum of 10 Traits in an Attribute category. \nDhampyrs receive one level of a Kuei-jin Discipline, provided it is a Shintai \nDiscipline or Demon Art (the other Disciplines are beyond their ken). They may \nlearn Disciplines during play at double the usual cost. A dhampyr’s age in centuries \ndetermines how many levels of a single Discipline he can possess (round up). \nTherefore, a 269-year-old dhampyr may leamup to three levels of a given Discipline. \nDhampyrs must choose normal Virtues (Courage, Self-Control, etc.), and \nthey do not have a Dharma rating - \nthey possess Humanity instead. (See Laws of \nthe Night for details on these Virtues.) When it comes to determining things like \neffective Chi Virtue ratings and how much Chi they may access and so on, use the \nsame rules for Chi expenditure as given for Shih and SFO agents in Laws of the East. \nDhampyrs begin play with one P’o Trait. Their Demons are not awakened \nas are those of the Kuei-jin, and they cannot initiate shadow soul. Theirs is more \nof a barely noticeable urge toward monstrosity. Dhampyrs may access Demon \n\n\nChi and use it for the same benefits that Kuei-jin get from it. Of course, this dark \nside can grow stronger over time. Any time the character loses his last Humanity \nTrait from committing an evil act, she gains a P’o Trait along with the standard \nderangement. A dhampyr can have no more Humanity Traits than five minus \nher Po rating, so those who slide into monstrosity rarely regain much human \nempathy. Dhampyrs with three or more P‘o return as Kuei-jin when they die. \nDhampyrs cannot access Kuei-jin powers such as Ghostsight or Lifesight. They \nare not truly reborn souls in dead flesh, but half-living, half-dead beings. However, \nDhampyrs may use their Chi to heal themselves in the same manner as Kuei-jin, at \na rate of one health level of lethal or two health levels of bashing damage per Chi \nTrait. Dhampyrs require normal mortal amounts of food, drink, sleep, etc., although \nthe need for these things can be staved off for a day with the expenditure of a Chi \nTrait. Dhampyrs also do not suffer from Chi imbalance as Kuei-jindo, although they \nmay certainly become imbalanced as the result of supernatural manipulation. \nDhampyrs regain Chi normally, as mortals do. They may also regain Chi by \neating flesh (they lack the enlightenment necessary to gain sustenance from blood \nor breath). Each health level offers one Trait of Chi. Of course, gaining Chi in this \nfashion is sure to provoke a Conscience test in all but the most depraved of dhampyrs. \nDhampyrs are hardy creatures. Once they mature, they effectively age at \na rate of one year for every 10 years that pass. Furthermore, dhampyrs are more \ndifficult to kill than normal mortals. Not only can they heal themselves with \ntheir Chi, but dhampyrs’ players may also make a Static Physical Challenge \nagainst six Traits whenever their characters are reduced below Incapacitated by \nlethal damage (aggravated still kills normally). If successful, the dhampyr \neffectively hovers at the brink of death for one scenehour, during which time \nhe appears dead to all normal and supernatural probing (thus typically fooling \nhis attackers into believing they’ve destroyed him). At the end of this time, the \ndhampyr may begin spending Chi to heal normally. If no Chi is available, the \ncharacter is considered Incapacitated, and must heal normally (i.e., very slowly). \nYU \nLAN-J I N \nWHIRLWINDS \nO P  TATTERED \nBODIES \nNot all souls survive the Road Back with the same resilience that the Kuei-jin \ndo. The lacerating winds of Hell cripple some souls, and those souls have trouble \nholding on to their mortal forms when they return to the Middle Kingdom. These \nunfortunates must leap from body to body constantly as they try in vain to hold onto \nsome sense of identity. Yulan-jin - \nor Soul Jumpers as the younger Kuei-jin call \nthem - \nare tragic creatures indeed, for the ceaseless transition between bodies \nmakes Dharmic advancement next to impossible, dooming most of these poor souls \nto a brief, confused stay in the Middle Kingdom before sliding back to Yomi once \nmore. It takes a truly determined and focused soul to make any kind of unlife out of \nsuch difficult circumstances, and many more Yulan-jin slip back into Yomi than \nremain. However, those Yulan-jin that somehow manage to curb their constant \nwandering become some of the most focusedsoulsunder Heaven, determined as they \nare to battle off the might of Hell itself to retain their identity. \nAs if their unlives weren’t difficult enough already, Kuei-jin society rejects \nthose Soul Jumpers it uncovers. Destroying these creatures is considered a mercy \n\n\nkilling, as the Kuei-jin believe that the Yulan-jin only pose a threat to others with \ntheir unstable lifestyle and since their Dharmic difficulty makes them more likely \nto become murderous chihmei or even seek out the Yama Kings for aid. Of course, \na Yulan-jin is essentially identical to a Kuei-jin in the beginning, and some are \neven inducted into a court or a wu. At their first “death,” however, the vampire’s \ntrue nature becomes apparent. Instead of hovering near the body during the Little \nDeath, theYulan-jin’ssoulwhisksoff \ninsearchofanothercorpse to inhabit. Yulan- \njin are thus forced to live alone or in small communities of their own kind. Most \nSoul Jumpers adopt a single name that they retain from lifetime to lifetime (often \nprefaced with “Yulan” so that it can be distinguished from a Kuei-jin - \n“Yulan+ \nLei” or “Yulan-Wang,” for example). This practice is often their only means of \nretaining some sense of identity, for they may awaken in a new body hundreds of \nmiles from friends and allies each time they ‘‘pass on,” and material possessions \ndon’t accompany the change. Thus, Yulan-jin seldom form lasting attachments, \nand they deal with each other on the basis of reputation. Those who accomplish \ngreat deeds or hold onto their forms for a long time are accorded much respect. \nSince their constant body-shifting can pose intense demands on a Storyteller \n(who wants to have a character who drops in wearing a different face every few \nsessions and who sometimes must come from a hundred miles away or more?), \nplayers should secure permission before creating Yulan-jin characters. They \nshould also be aware that while it is possible for some of these vampires to rise to \ngreat station and standing, it’s far more likely that they will have a much shorter \nstay in the Middle Kingdom than normal Kuei-jin. If playing this kind of tragic \ncharacter suits them, then fine, but if they’re not comfortable with the long odds \nstacked against them, perhaps they’re better off playing another type of character. \nYULAN-JIN \nCHARACTER \nCREATION \nYulan-jin are created and played identically to regular Kuei-jin, with the \nfollowing alterations: \nYulan-jin start with one fewer Willpower Traits than normal Kuei-jin, a \nmark of the terrible damage done by the lacerating winds of Yomi. \nYulan-jin may have any Dharma, although they seldom progress very far. \nAsanote, theseKuei-jindon’ttend todowellevenwith theThousand Whispers \nDharma. That path requires that a life be studied until everything possible has \nbeen learned from it, and Yulan-jin are frequently forced to discard an identity \nbefore learning everything they can. \nBody swapping - \nA Yulan-jin is forced to leave her current body from \ntime to time. During such times, her soul is forced to endure the torment of Yomi \nfor days or even weeks until another suitable body has been found to host the \nspirit. (Storytellers are encouraged to describe such periods, if not actually \nroleplay them out with the player.) Once the Yulan-jin leaves the body, it \nimmediately becomes entirely dead and decays as appropriate for a corpse of its \nage. A Soul Jumper passes on whenever any of the following conditions occur: \nTemporary Willpower is reduced to zero \nTemporary Chi of either type is completely exhausted \nShe suffers torpor. (Final Death sends the Yulan-jin to Yomi for good.) \nAfter settling in a body, the Soul Jumper is always disoriented and may even \nexperience some permanent memory loss, thus sliding the vampire closer to \n\n\n’ oblivion with every leap. The Yulan-jin’s player must make a Static Willpower \nChallenge against four Traits. Success means the character suffers some disorien- \ntation but is otherwise all right. Failure means the character suffers more severe \namnesia (only the barest details remain clear) and must remove one Ability level \npermanently. In addition, players who fail must immediately win or tie a Simple \nTest. Failing this test means the character loses a permanent Willpower Trait as \nher soul frays even further from the stress of the change. Characters reduced to zero \nWillpower this way pass into Yomi for good, the soul dissipating in the winds of \nHell. All guunxi previously established are also broken on assuming a new body. \nYulan-jin lose a Dharma Trait automatically when they pass on, which \nmakes it difficult to hold on to enlightenment for any period of time. Yulan-jin \nwho pass on with no Dharma Traits are blasted back to Yomi permanently. \nIt should be noted that while the player of the Yulan-jin must still make \nsure other players know of any differences in their character’s appearance as they \nmove from body to body, the vampire’s soul seldom chooses a body radically \ndifferent from its original. Therefore, unless the Storyteller rules otherwise, \nYulan-jin do not change Attributes, Attribute totals or Abilities when they shift \nbodies. They may look different, but it’s the same soul within. \nYulan-j in are normally indistinguishable from regular Kuei-jin, unless one \nwitnesses them pass on (watching their soul flee), or successfully uses one of the \nfollowing Disciplines on them: the Cultivation Discipline of Scrutinixe, the Obliga- \ntion Discipline of Soul Bridge or the Chi’iu Muh power Pu~$~atiun. \nNote that the \ncharacter may not know exactly what he’s looking at unless he possesses a few \nlevels of the Occult Ability. He just knows that whatever it is, it isn’t a Kuei-jin. \n\n\nTHF MOURNING AETFR \nJ \nby Cynthia Summers \nCynthia knows things. She’s been developing Mind’s Eye Theatre for \nmore than a year now, and she’s been playing Mind’s Eye Theatre since she \nstarted working for White Wolf in 1994. She’s one of the resident JARPing \nexperts in house here, and as an observer of the dynamics of live-action \nrokplaying society, she is without peer. \nDEAL IN^ WITH CHARACTER \nDEATH \nIt’s only natural that when you engage in something that has you figura- \ntively climbing into the skin of another person, you get attached to that person. \nLikewise, when you’re spending a great deal of time and energy on something \nthat’s a close part of your life, you get used to that activity as part of the order of \nthings. Therefore, when a character dies, it can throw you for a real loop. Some \nplayers grouse, but they go fetch out the back-up character they created for just \nsuch an emergency. Some leave the site in a rage to find a beer to bitch into and \na computer by which to spread the news. Very rarely, some are not sorry to see \nthe character go at all. Maybe they weren’t crazy about some aspects that \ndeveloped over time, and the death was a neat exeunt into the final night. And \nthen there are those folks for whom the event is a wallop upside the head that \nleaves them floundering around trying to figure out what happened. \nR I 9 H T WAY \ns \nThe first thing to remember is that the death of a character isn’t the end of \nthe world. All stories end. Some take longer roads than others, but eventually, \nthe tale comes to an end. Still, if you’ve had a long run with a character, or you’re \nparticularly fond of it, a sudden end of the road can be hard. So what should you \ndo? Here are some ideas to grab onto during those first few days: \nTake some time off. Consider taking a break to just chill out and rediscover \nthose hobbies you enjoy when you’re not LARPing. As that favorite button \nslogan goes, sometimes death is Nature’s way of telling you to slow down. You \nmay find this advice helpful to give yourself a little distance in creating a new \ncharacter or to ensure that you don’t gravitate automatically toward your old \ncharacter’s former allies and friends. If you want to keep playing, consider \nseeking out a different venue to get your “fix.” \nDo a 180 in your next character. Consider death a new beginning when \ncreating your next character. If you played a combat-active former Navy SEAL, \ntry playing a scholar who gets green at the mere idea of a fight. If you previously \nthrew all your energy at a Vampire chronicle, redirect it toward Changeling. At \nthe very least, such a change-up ensures that you won’t be mistaken for your old \ncharacter. You’ve got a clean slate - \nmake the most of it. \nT T ~  \nyour hand at storytelling. So you want to take some time off from playing, \nbut you don’t want to sit at home in front of the tube or the computer? Maybe this \n\n\nis the time to think about storytelling. Find out if your Storyteller could use a hand, \nor write up a plot to submit. You may discover some previously hidden talents. If you \never had a gripe about how things ran, now is the time to do something about it. \nFind closure. Finding a way to gently draw the curtain on something you \nwere close to is tough. You may attend your character’s funeral (very surrepti- \ntiously, of course). You may vent throughvarious mediums, like art or sports. You \nmay pause to consider your own mortality. You may feel weepy when you hear \na song you associated with your character. You may bawl through your favorite \nmovie while devouring a whole box of chocolates. There’s no real wrong way to \nfind closure, provided you approach it with maturity. \nRealize it’s not the end of the world. The world won’t stop turning because \nCount Marmaduke came to an unfortunate demise at the end of an assassin’s cold \niron knife or your Silver Fang Ahroun went down while fighting a Thunderwyrm. \nTheneat thing about storytelling games is that when one runs out, there are always \nmore waiting. There will always be more games to play and stories to tell. \nW R O N g  W A Y S  \nNow, of course, for every right way to do things, there exists a wrong way \nto do them. Losing characters does sometimes seem to cause people to lose their \nheads and do things that they might find reprehensible in other circumstances. \nSo, while I’m not saying that you would rush off and do something so silly, it’s \ngood to remember what are the wrong things to do: \nCreate a new character exactly like the old one. Oh, come on now. If you’re \ngoing to do that, then why are you reading this? Doing this sort of thing gets you \nresponses like, “Get over it.” Sequels that are just a rehash of the first story get \nsneered at. Don’t be a sequel. Only rarely are they as good as the original. \nCome in with a vendetta against your old character’s killers. Creating a \ncharacter who’s the relative of your late character and whose only purpose is to \nkill off the ones who screwed your original character over the first time is a \nhallmark of the sore loser and the immature player. Should you have a m e  \ngrievance, take it to the proper authority and let vengeance be the Storyteller’s. \nThrow a tantrum. To put it bluntly, throwing a tantrum is immature. \nWe’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again - \nwhen you play this game, you decide \nwhat risks to accept or decline. If you don’t like the odds, don’t play. It’s that \nsimple. If your character takes the risk of becoming an infemalist and doesn’t \ncover his tracks while he busily destroys lives, then few people are going to have \nmuch sympathy for you when your character is hunted down like a dog. You took \nthe risk; accept the consequences gracefully. Words spoken in anger, particu- \nlarly threats and curses, can last for a lot longer than anger itself, and they will \ncertainly impact your return to the game. \nSTOBYTFLLEBS \nNow what if you’re a Storyteller on the “other side of the fence,” as it were? \nSome circumstances come up that the books just can’t tell you about because we \ncan’t guess at all the experiences you’ll run into. Consider these words to be like \nthe ones that all funeral-home directors have: \nBe prepared to see the player vanish for a while. Unwelcome memories can \nbe burdensome in the midst of a game, and she may not want to deal with things \nTHE M O U B N I N ~  \nAPTER \n\n\nfor a while. Give her some space, and don’t demand she return to the game. Just \nlet her know she’s welcome when she’s ready. \nBe prepared to listen to some venting. When a player’s character dies, you’ll \nprobably hear some griping about the unfairness of it all - \nit’s a given. When \nthings devolve into tantrums and other unpleasantness, however, put your foot \ndown and don’t give it any more credence. \nMake sure everything is on the level. If there’s evidence that character death \nwas brought about solely due to cheating, out-of-character knowledge or dislike \nof the player, you’ve got a problem. While you may not be able to bring the lost \ncharacter back, you can ensure that justice is done. \nDon’t be mean. Admit it - \nwe’ve all had those characters or players who \nhave been thorns in our sides, and we find ourselves hoping that said character \nwill go away (and take the player with him). Should you have such a player, then \ndon’t celebrate when the day comes. There are still people who are unhappy \nabout the event, and gloating about it just makes you look like a weasel. \nMEMENTO \nMORI \nOne of the biggest fears of death is that we will be forgotten by the living \nonce we are no longer around to assert our presence. It’s part of why we erect \ngravestones and monuments, to ensure against such an outcome. Legacies of one \nsort or another are a possible way to cheat Death. Many a building has been built, \na library founded or a patronage made to ensure that someone’s name was not \nforgotten. This tradition isn’t limited to the real-life living. \nConsider having a character write a will at some point, perhaps with the idea \nthat he’s providing for his dependents (be they ghouls, childlings, Kinfolk etc.) or \nseeing that his resources and possessions are disposed of properly. Check with your \nStoryteller to see ifshe will allow Backgrounds 1ikeResources to be distributed. The \nlast requests of a will (“Bury my ashes in Poland,” “Make sure my daughter can \nfinish school”) could send characters into the arms of new plot while carrying out \nthe late character’s wishes or provide some exciting roleplaying opportunities. \nWhat if someone contests the will, or your character chooses an unlikely executor \nthat many disagree with (a Fianna entrusts her will to a Bone Gnawer)? The \nresulting plot will have the recipients certainly thinking about your late character, \nalthough whether it’s to take his name in vain or to praise him is another matter. \nLet the Storyteller know that should your character be declared dead, there’s a \nlawyer or lawyer-type with a letter for someone, which may be interesting in and \nof itself if a character has a public persona you weren’t aware of. \nAnother ideaistoleavedocumentsinasecretcacheforsomeluckyplayer.Examp1es \nof such might be the letters a Nosferatu was writing to the Tremere he loved from afar \n(which give some hints about his impending death), a set of very spiritual Gaia poems \ncreatedby aKinfolk (which give someobservations that prick thesept’science alittle \ntoo fiercely) or an eshu’s travel journal written in Farsi (complete with comments \nregarding other courts). Uncovered documents can be fodder for smaller, more personal \nplot lines. (Who might the documents embarrass, or what secrets will they reveal?) \nAgain, it takes pre-planning. Start workmg on such thingsw, even if you don’t thmk \nthat your character’s in trouble. Once your character passes on, give the phys-reps to the \nStoryteller and give her the complete scoop on where the items are so she knows what \nto do when someone finds the secret pasage or discovers the magic box. \n\n\nAnother option that some might look at is to become a wraith. Depending \non the character, this progression could be an entirely natural. Vampires who \ndidn’t reach Golconda, mortals, Kinfolk, kinain and ghouls are all likely \ncandidates for the Underworld, but remember that the souls of werewolves, \nchangelings and mages get “recycled” for later generations. This transformation \nmay lead into interactions with the Giovanni, sluagh or other speakers with the \ndead. One interesting example of such a change was of a mortal nun who was \nmurdered by the Inquisition and became a wraith. Rather than haunt her killers, \nshe chose to watch over several vampires she had known while she lived, \nencouraging them to maintain their Humanity and becoming a sort of guardian \nangel. Later, she became a Storyteller vehicle to introduce a new plot that had \nties to the Underworld. Just make sure that your character’s transformation into \na wraith is not an excuse to make other players miserable. It’s one thing for a \nwraith to have the Passion of haunting her murderer, but it’s another altogether \nto harangue a player non-stop throughout the evening. Such errant ones should \nbe rewarded with frisky Shadows or a quick trip into the Maelstrom. \nLastly, remember that talk is free, and it costs you no actions during combat \n(unless you’re reduced to unconsciousnw or torpor). The final farewells to one’s \nbeloved, the gasped-out confessions, the curses made with dying breath and the need \nfor forgiveness before death are the moments that high drama is made of. From the \nmost famous lines (“It is finished”) to the not-quite as famous ones (“Friends, \napplaud! The comedy is over.”), last words place your character in the annals of the \ngame memory. If your character has a sadistic streak, you could choose to make your \npassing even more memorable by revealing a secret that affects those left behind. A \nprime example occurs in Tolkien’s Silmmillion, where the dying dragon Glaurung \ninforms the maiden Niniel that her husband Turambar (who is Glaurung’s slayer) \nis in fact the brother who was separated from her as a child. Tender or terrible, last \nwords can make a vivid final impression on the survivors. \nDeath in LARP is pretty unavoidable unless your character chooses to hide \nunder arock indefinitely. Eventually, it will find him in some form, whether it’s \nhis own or a valued comrade’s. When staring down its barrel, remember the \nwords of one pragmatist: “Who wants to live forever, anyway?” \nIn pace requiescat. \n\n\nM I N D ’ S  \n\n\nYORIZON: \nUPCOMIN~ \nL A R P  EVENTS \n. \n.vuyc \nL.lc uala6ULL.e \nMoon; \nOnyxIlluminatus; Charleston, SC \nTampa, FL \nIan Betts, alisterlegare@hotmail.com \nHope Summerall, zandria@hotmail.com \nSOUTHWESTERN \nU S  \nRage Against the Darkness; \nTempe, AZ \nCybertec@c yberdude.com \nSong of Sonora; Tucson, AZ \nKevin Lynch 11, KWLynchBao1.com \nCollin Toohey, \n(520) 722-2688 \n(602) 942-4994 \nO T H E R S  ( UNSPECIEIEDAND \nMIXED \n~ A M E S )  \nDark Carpathia, Portland, ME \nh t t p : / I  ho m e. m a i n  e. r r. c o m /  \ndarkcarpathia/darkcarp.html \nplay tests upcoming supplements) \nEast of the River, Vernon, CT \nD.
