When you’re sitting at home with your friends playing Vampire: The Masquer-
ade, or any other tabletop game, the assembled group consists of your Storyteller and
about half-a-dozen players, including yourself. Your characters interact with numerous
Storyteller characters throughout the course of the game, all of whom are filtered
through the imagination and portrayal of the Storyteller.
When you step into a live-action roleplaying game, however, everything
changes. In a tabletop chronicle, your Storyteller represents all the roles that you
encounter, be they pivotal to the story or not. Now, it’s possible that of the dozens
of people milling about the venue, any could be a Storyteller character, could be vital
to your character’s plot, could be irrelevant, could be… anything. Real one-to-one
numbers represent the creatures of the setting, at least insofar as any given scene is
concerned. You’re now face-to-face with the situation, and you no longer have a
central single person presenting the worldview to you.
We all prefer different styles of gaming. Some prefer one-shot games involving
immediate plots and resolutions. Some of us prefer smaller, more personal chronicles
that focus on the characters and their internal issues and in which the external
politics are merely a background to the central characters’ lives. Smaller games allow
for more personal interaction between Storytellers, players, plots and the rules. If
your chronicle consists of seven players and one Storyteller, it can be run like a
tabletop game, describing the reactions of the World of Darkness and helping
everyone through the challenges they perform. The feel is personal, the plots can be
grand and world-changing, and the mechanics of the rules can be governed by the
consensus of the players. In a game of this size, the Storyteller has a good idea of what
each character is doing, and he can work on character development, personal horror
and intriguing plot twists from each character’s past.

Most of us play our games for the long haul, however. We want a chronicle that
is rich in history and a story that evolves in response to our characters’ actions. We
want to create something lasting and memorable that we can revisit time and again.
Because so many roleplayers have these desires, they share their games with each
other, intertwine their stories and invite others to experience the interactivity of this
hobby. The numbers in a chronicle swell, and the Storyteller has to take up the slack.
Some Storytellers prefer to keep their chronicles small, choosing to emphasize
intimacy and ensuring a comfortable workload for their staff and themselves. Placing
a limit on the number of players is a reasonable method of controlling the scope of
the game, in and out of character.
Others embrace the growth of the chronicle and work hard to produce the best
roleplaying environment possible for the swelling mass of players that they must
accommodate. Additionally, a popular chronicle may go on for years as old stories
develop, characters grow and new ideas and new people keep the game fresh. Any
Storyteller will find that tweaks to the rules and systems with which they are familiar
will eventually be necessary.
As the game grows larger, conflicts between more players subtly shift the
chronicle away from a situation in which the Storyteller describes the World of
Darkness to one in which the players define the World of Darkness for each other.
Even if the ratio of Storytellers to players is the same as that of a smaller game, the
larger game becomes less personalized for each character. Unlike a game with one
Storyteller and seven players, no one Storyteller can know the plans of each and
every character in a game with 10 Storytellers and 70 players. Many player actions
and challenges take place beyond the view of the Storytellers in a large game. Social
dynamics also become a factor in the 70-person game, whereas personal dynamics
are more prominent in the seven-person game. Therefore, the psychological rules of
play change for everyone involved.

The sheer scope of organizing a one-shot convention game, administering a
network of games or simply keeping a large chronicle going from month to month
all have their own challenges. Mind’s Eye Theatre provides a core system for event
resolution, basic information on genre-specific social dynamics and guidelines for
running an average game. The viability of some of these guidelines weakens when
they are stretched to accommodate a large number of characters over an extended
period of time, however.

The Laws of… books have been written with a single small game in mind. Such
a game includes one or two Storytellers, a handful of Narrators and perhaps 20 to 30
players in regular attendance over a few years.
The Storyteller’s load is still manageable at this level, but it is significant. If the
game has newsletters, rumor sheets, character sheets, item cards, Willpower tokens
and other paraphernalia to hand out during each session, these routine tasks can use
up time and resources that might be better spent on more important aspects of the
game, such as plot development, genre interaction and a Narrator’s character
portrayal. The Storyteller would be wise to delegate some of these tasks to her
Narrators or players.
The average number of people in any given scene is likely to remain low (less
than 10) for a small game, barring major gatherings such as a prince’s announcement

of judgment, or the arrival of visiting dignitaries. The players will tend to drift into
and between groups, staying in smaller, more discrete numbers (coteries, clans or
power blocs), until it is necessary for the city’s inhabitants to assemble.
With such small average scenes, it is much easier for players and Narrators to
follow rules designed to segue easily between roleplaying and so-called “ruleplaying.”
The detail available through the application of the Mind’s Eye Theatre rules is more
representative of in-game reality at this level. Mass challenges are likely to be
resolved quickly, and everyone in the scene can communicate easily to resolve any
difficulties or confusion.
The regular Mind’s Eye Theatre books can stretch comfortably to accommo-
date a game of up to 50 to 75 players with few problems if the Storytellers and
Narrators are capable of running the game smoothly while also handling the details
of the game between sessions. As the size of the game expands, the Storyteller may
find it difficult to juggle all of the information he requires in order to maintain the
game (such as character sheets, status, plots, backgrounds and character goals). No
single Storyteller can realistically be expected to remember everything, and keeping
records becomes more and more important.
Games usually need an administrative staff by the time they reach the 50- to 75-
player mark. One Storyteller might maintain the character database while another
handles Influence actions throughout the month, and yet another ensures that
newsletters and props are ready for Saturday night. Meanwhile, a Narrator contacts
all the players to let them know that the venue has been booked and that the game
this week will involve the Ventrue primogen’s deathnight celebrations. She then
updates the website with directions to the game and sends a copy to the group’s email
list. Sharing the load is a Good Thing.
If your game continues to grow, you’ll find that you need to adjust a few things
sooner or later. You’ll have to tweak some internal game systems to maintain balance
and deal with the growing administrivia, for example. Fortunately, that’s what this
book is here to help you do.

The standard Mind’s Eye Theatre book emphasizes the establishment of core
rules for playing the game. For example, Laws of the Night gives us a complete
system to cover the resolution of most situations that arise in an average Mind’s Eye
Theatre game. That book covers rules for character creation, challenge resolution,
a basic set of social structures and all the essential information you will need to run
a Mind’s Eye Theatre game. It establishes a central system around which more
detailed (or simplified) rules versions can be constructed, if necessary.
Expansion books, such as the Laws of the Night Camarilla Guide and the Laws
of the Night Sabbat Guide, are rich sources of material for developing your
chronicle’s background, resources, antagonists and the darker side of its history.
These books contain rules for dealing with elders, expanded options for character
concepts, more details on the specific societies upon which each book focuses and
guidelines for settings and plots. However, as helpful as these books are, they still
focus on a smaller game.
The remainder of the available background material for the World of
Darkness can be found in White Wolf’s tabletop supplements. The various clan-
, kith- and tribebooks provide players with more detail on the backgrounds of
their character types, and they supply plenty of ideas for new characters. The

question, and act as a springboard for ideas that can apply to any chronicle. Some
sourcebooks address creatures outside the mainstream, such as mummies. Each
has information and misinformation that can contribute to your chronicle or
network game. Additionally, supplements such as Nights of Prophecy deal with
the metaplot — the overall and ongoing history of the World of Darkness as it
has been laid out by White Wolf.
As a guide for network games that follow the World of Darkness, these resources
are invaluable. They provide a source of consistency that any chronicle can access
to stay on the same page as its neighbors. If discrepancies arise in the flow of play in
the network (if the Gangrel were treated nicely, for instance, and Xavier is sitting
down for tea and scones with Hardestadt tomorrow evening) then the network will
need to make those differences known to the rest of the member chronicles. The
member chronicles will also need to notify intended players of these differences so
that, again, everyone remains on the same page.
For large or convention games, these sourcebooks can be used to paint the
backdrop of the rest of the world, if needed. External consistency is less important
when your chronicle is not related to or affected by any others.

The Mind’s Eye Theatre books are designed to deal with short- to medium-
term chronicles lasting for a couple of years and in which games are held once or
twice a month. Usually, the chronicle will cover the development and conclusion
of one or two major story arcs, and the overarching theme will remain constant.
The growth of characters over that period of time in terms of Experience Traits
would be within the range of 20-30 Traits, depending on the rate of play and
advancement. As a slice of the character’s life, the chronicle is an active and exciting
one in which the character grows and learns.
The chronicle would also address the growth and experience of the city in
which it is set, but it is likely that such background evolution will be marked only
as the backdrop against which the characters strut their stuff.
It is possible to use the regular books for long-term chronicle play, but the
accelerated rate of character growth that derives from the standard rules can give rise
to characters who become too powerful too quickly. Games that play frequently
(once a fortnight, maybe more) but still award the usual one to three Experience
Traits per game will quickly notice the disparity between the rate of growth of a
Mind’s Eye Theatre character and that of a similar tabletop character.
Interconnected chronicle networks present their players with the opportunity
to visit other games, and thus to earn additional Experience Traits for their
characters. Storytellers must scrutinize the growth rate of those characters in
comparison with non-traveling characters in order to make sure that a balanced
progression takes place throughout the organization.

LARPs become large around the 75-player mark. That figure is fairly arbitrary,
but experience has shown it to be accurate as a guideline. You may consider a game
large if it hits only the 50-player mark, or you might consider a game of 200 players
to be perfectly comfortable. As in any generalized demographic, your mileage may
vary. The kind of games that you’d find at a convention or a gathering of chronicles
from within a LARPing network may have hundreds or thousands of players, which
certainly places them within the large category.

Introduction
Introduction
Of course, every game has its share of casual players — those who only turn
up occasionally, maybe only once — and those people skew the population
count somewhat. Players bring along their significant others to show them
what they’ve been involved in on Saturday nights, but the SO might play only
a couple of times and then drop out. People also drag friends along for
something to do for the evening, but those friends sometimes find that live-
action roleplaying is not for them. Some casual gamers may or may not turn up,
depending on what’s on TV that night. As far as the population figures for a
single ongoing chronicle go, we’re referring to regular players (i.e., those who
attend the game 75% of the time).
Games will grow to the aforementioned size if your local area has the gamer
population to support it and if the quality of the game is such that others
recommend it to their friends. Some games prefer to vet potential players in
order to ensure compatibility with their game styles. Others advertise for
interested individuals, and still others allow anyone to turn up to try the game.
In any case, players will stay if they have fun and if they see that the chronicle
is run fairly and well. They also need to know that the staff is capable of handling
the necessary paperwork. In the end, remember, it’s not the size of the game that
matters; it’s the quality that counts.

As a chronicle matures and develops, it will attract new players, whether they
are seasoned roleplayers, newly interested gamers or casual give-it-a-try types.
People come and go as their interest waxes and wanes. A game’s population is
typically dynamic and ever-changing.
Sometimes, the quantity of players in a popular chronicle rises to an over-
whelming number. If the game rocks, the population stays high, and the Storyteller
finds herself with more players than she knows how to handle or entertain. Roles and
plots expand, and the scope of the chronicle expands as well. The entire situation
would be a real challenge for any Storyteller to deal with.
Chronicles that enter this upward spiral will eventually encompass all levels of
their chosen genre on the city scale. Players will take the roles of elders and princes,
bishops and paladins, Garou elders or local dukes. Simultaneously, the lower
echelons expand to encompass the underdogs, all of whom are exciting and vibrant
characters in and of themselves.
Most of the players would play “average” citizens of the genre — the neonates,
ancillae, fosterns and wilders of the area — while a few may hold positions of
authority in the city’s power structure. If your chronicle is large enough, you may
have players’ characters holding primogen positions, or even portraying the prince
and his city officers.
So how does a Storyteller deal with organizing all of these people? The game
needs a site large enough to accommodate everyone comfortably. It needs plots that
will hold the interest of as many players as possible. It needs to develop sub-plots that
will keep the rest of the players happy as well, unless they’re comfortable dealing
solely with plots of their own creation.
These large games — let’s cement a lower boundary of 75 people to that label
— are amazing fun when they are run well. They can also be mind-splitting
headaches when they are run poorly.

Imagine the scope of a game that encompasses not just one city and its internal
political structure, but which represents the larger picture of the entire continent or
even the globe. Imagine a chain of interconnected chronicles that encompasses and
presents the World of Darkness and the machinations of the monsters that dwell
therein. Imagine a cohesive mega-chronicle of thousands of characters’ intertwining
stories that reach around the world and in which the potential repercussions are felt
for years to come.
Mind-boggling? Perhaps. An administrative nightmare? Maybe. But is it
possible? Very definitely. In fact, several such organizations already exist and have
been in operation for a number of years. New groups form and grow with their own
styles of administration and interaction, which ensures a wide range of options for
any isolated chronicle that might consider becoming a part of such a group.
These network groups consist of like-minded chronicles that have joined
together to present their view of the World of Darkness to their players on a local,
national or global scale. Sometimes, the groups focus primarily on one genre-group,
such as The Masquerade or The Shining Host. Others admit a cross-section of
genres, each of which exists alongside the others.
In a single chronicle, a Storyteller has the freedom to take his stories wherever
he wishes. He has complete autonomy, and the genre police are not going to come
knocking on his door if he decides that the Camarilla finally wiped out the
Giovanni in a fit of pique. A network, however, relies on chronicles working
together to remain on the same page. Therefore, the individual chronicles must be
prepared to sacrifice some of their autonomy in order to comply with the overall
vision of the network.
Individual chronicles within the network do not have to be large, but the total
number of players in a network certainly brings the count to staggering proportions.
Thousands of people worldwide share their roleplaying experiences under a commu-
nal umbrella, knowing that the actions that they take next Saturday night might
affect enemies and allies across the continent. The potential for interaction between
characters is enormous, whether that interaction occurs via the Internet or players
actually traveling to other member chronicles in order to further their own plots,
make allies and meet fellow players in person. Given the combined talents of
hundreds of Storytellers working together, you can be sure that the games remain
interesting and fresh. Every chronicle can touch the next with its plots, and every
character can reach the others with his stories.
Such groups rely on communication, compromise and courtesy, just as any
smaller single chronicle does, albeit on a larger scale. Networks need a central
support structure to guide members in their dealings with other chronicles. Smaller
networks (which comprise only a handful of member chronicles) may be able to
operate comfortably on a casual consensual basis, but the larger networks require a
set of rules to deal with the administration of the networks and the interactivity of
their members. An out-of-game council or committee reflects the organizational
needs of such groups, looking after the out-of-character maintenance that is
necessary for such a network to remain cohesive. In order for the communal game
to flourish as a whole, some degree of bureaucracy is required to represent and
monitor the interests of the individual chronicles in the network.
The internal structure of these organizations varies according to the desires of
those within. Some networks prefer a top-down structure, in which a central


11
Introduction
Introduction
storytelling team administers and directs the overall plot of the network’s chronicles,
while allowing the individual chronicles to handle sub-plots. Another group may
encourage the communal development of plots by representatives from each
member chronicle.
The Storyteller workload will vary according to the size of any individual
chronicle within the network. The degree of involvement of the network in the
usual maintenance of a member chronicle is minimal. The network administrators
oversee the shared and universal aspects of the World of Darkness, and they
coordinate their efforts with the chronicles involved as necessary.

Some roleplayers revel in convention games, large conglomerations of people
who meet annually to game the heck out of whatever scenario is thrown at them.
These massive gatherings are usually annual affairs, drawing hundreds of players
from around the world together to share their styles of gaming.
Even smaller convention gatherings of 100-200 people can be a challenge for
a Storyteller who is accustomed to dealing with a couple dozen of his friends every

An interesting subset of the network arises when a multi-genre chronicle’s
population grows too large. The split-genre local network consists of a series
of games run in parallel in the same setting, one game for each genre (i.e.,
supernatural creature type). Each game has a specialized set of Storytellers,
and the Storytellers from each of the games meet regularly to govern cross-
chronicle interactions.
Theoretically, minimal cross-genre interaction should occur on a player
level, so the major interaction would occur through the effects that the
characters have on their environment. Most types of characters can have the
Influence Background, so any individual can affect the Influence of another
creature in the same city directly. The responsibility of sorting out these
interactions falls upon the Storytellers, who resolve the interactions and report
the results back to the players affected.
It is very possible that players may play different characters in several or all
of these games, and policies must be made to deal with the potential of
overlapping interest or plots with these characters. Players of multiple charac-
ters should be able to separate the information and plots of each of their
characters, but at times a conflict of interest may arise.
If these games are in violent contention (in character) with each other,
then interaction may be more immediate, and rules of engagement on an out-
of-character level may need to be resolved by the collective Storytellers. Is it
acceptable for the werewolf characters to kill other players’ vampire charac-
ters during the day if they know where the vampires in question sleep? What
sort of impact will direct conflict have on the flow of the individual chronicles
and the entire network? Is it okay to wipe out a chronicle for reasons of genre?
Well, no, it’s not. Players should know better and plan more nefarious and fun
ways of dealing with their opponents. Conflict between two characters is
common, and it can be dealt with easily. Conflict between two species is to
be avoided unless you really enjoy hours of challenges and dealing with
embittered players in the aftermath.

third Saturday of the month. The logistics of pre-registering hundreds of players,
creating or vetting a similar number of characters and finding venues and accommo-
dations adds a considerable amount of work to the usual duties that a Storyteller
would perform in the course of a smaller game.
Stories for convention games often focus on a singular event or series of
events, the background for which is outlined for the players when they arrive at
the game. Similarly, the characters in play are generated by the convention staff,
rather than being the players’ regular characters. These one-shot events allow
players to exercise their acting skills in different roles than those they may be
accustomed to in their regular game.
Networks may also hold their own convention-style gatherings — conclaves
or moots or simply Halloween or Christmas gatherings — in which they invite
members to bring their regular characters together. These conventions help build
the sense of community within the network, and they can serve to play out pivotal
events in the network’s own metaplot. Due to their origins in the network, the
cohesive nature of these games makes the game easier for the Storytellers in terms
of constructing plot and characters. These conclaves will already be rife with
action from ongoing inter-chronicle plots, as well as personal character rivalries
and alliances. The workload decreases due to the valuable assistance of Storytell-
ers from other chronicles who can help with a number of matters.
Stand-alone conventions are a lot of hard work (and we’ll discuss them further
in the next chapter), but they are very rewarding if all goes well.

Almost the inverse of a network, an isolated chronicle draws in players from
neighboring areas because it is the only game in a large area due to either geographic
or demographic concerns. In a vast but sparsely populated area, players are unlikely
to live near each other, and would probably travel to a central location to play.
A considerable amount of communication is necessary for a widespread but
centralized game to remain cohesive, and the Storytellers will need to be adept
organizers. Available transportation and ease of travel may be a concern in some
places, and those in the isochronicle will assist each other as much as possible to
gather for the game.
If the interest (and therefore, population) in the game continues to grow, then
an isochronicle may evolve into a network. This occurs when players who live near
each other form their own games once their numbers grow to a level which they can
support a chronicle in their specific area.

While they are not the focus of this book, a number of online World of Darkness
games have been playing for quite some time and have amassed a large number of
players. While this style of game is not a live-action game per se, a huge number of
people are often involved in the chronicle, and many of the organizational and
networking matters that come up in this book may be of interest.
Most of these games revolve around email and require access to the Internet,
so they will already be set up in terms of communications. Players in this type of game
will be familiar with the concepts of e-scenes (in-character scenes that play out over
email or chat programs). As an alternative to a tabletop or live-action game, online

games can be a lot of fun. They also proceed at your leisure, rather than relying on
consensual meeting times. Rules of play will vary according to the game’s interpre-
tations of the Storyteller system’s rules and the systems the chronicle utilizes to
determine the outcome of challenges.

As games grow, players may discover a need to divide themselves into smaller
or more defined games, sometimes depending on personal taste or style, or depending
on how they’d rather see the game played.
Spin-offs are smaller, more focused games that originate from a larger parent
game. They tell stories of a group that is separate from the main parent, but these
games can quickly blossom into independent chronicles. Spin-off games sometimes
arise after a large multi-genre game splinters into smaller single-genre fragments, but
they maintain a network-style consistency of setting. A larger game may separate
into several neighboring smaller games (which are either networked or separate),
while maintaining the shared history of the earlier chronicle. Another permutation
is an intimate regular game involving only a handful of players from the parent game
who meet separately, but follow the same continuity as the original game.
Epilogues or aftershocks are games that sometimes stem from convention
games, portraying the aftermath in the lives of the convention characters. Some-
times players meet at a convention and decide to resume playing the characters that
they were given to play at the event. Players may wish to continue exploring these
characters after a chronicle officially ends.
Parallel games usually arise when a group of players splits into two factions over
a difference in style preference. The overall plot and history of the resulting parallel
games remain the same, but each game may take a different path. As with a spin-off,
this type of game may arise due to a split-up of a multi-genre chronicle. Parallel games
are not usually networked, and they share little other than a common background.

A long-running game can be defined as one that has run regularly over an
extended period of time. Okay, that’s nicely vague, without actually giving any
definitive reference points. Let’s clarify.
How often does a game have to run to be considered “regular”? You may play
your LARP monthly, fortnightly or every full moon. Your LARP may also be an
annual event that continues the story and plots from the previous year. You might
even play constantly throughout the week.
The duration and frequency of your game will have a marked impact upon its
growth and development. A regular game ensures a consistency of characteriza-
tion and permits a sense of tangible transition as the protagonists and their
environment change.
Think of an annual chronicle as a series of feature films, with recurring
characters and evolving plots. The same characters appear and take action, and large
gaps in time occur between each gathering. Annual chronicles deal with monumen-
tal events in the existences of these characters’ lives. An annual chronicle maintains
a consistent background and allows for considerably more detailed story work to be
done by the staff between the actual games. Meticulous care can be taken to maintain
theme, mood, plot, story consistency and quality, and back-stories can be written to
update the players on their characters’ activities throughout the intervening

downtime. Some danger of distancing players from their characters exists, since the
players are not interacting regularly as their characters. Additionally, it may be
difficult for some players to attend annually, so absent players’ characters may have
to be played by other people, which causes disparity in the consistency of character-
ization from one year to the next.
You can overcome some of these challenges by ensuring that the character
portfolio that you present to the players is comprehensive and that it includes strong
roleplaying guidelines. A few convention games follow an annual story, but it is more
common for a convention game to be a one-shot game rather than a chronicle.
Some chronicles run super-intensively, covering the actions of the characters
on an ongoing basis, and allowing for detailed (and possibly painful) roleplaying
acuity. The “24/7” chronicle is a very active style in which players are potentially in
character at any time of the day or (in a Masquerade setting) night. You may
encounter another player’s character at the local convenience store or at the movies,
or you can receive phone calls to deal with plot issues at any hour.
If such a game is to last more than a few weeks, the storytelling team must
develop methods for dealing with the rate of earning Experience Traits, resolving
conflicts in the absence of a Storyteller, standards of public play and display, how
to tell if a player is in or out of character and long-distance storytelling commu-
nications. Most importantly, the players and the Storytellers need to learn how to
deal with roleplaying overload. A game that requires essentially total immersion
can take a toll on a player’s everyday life. Remember to keep a reasonable
perspective and a sense of reality.
A normal chronicle runs once, maybe twice a month — possibly as often as
weekly. Our heroes are caught in summary without an in-depth exposition of their
daily routine, but in enough detail that we can appreciate their developing
personalities from month to month. We know that the characters are not
constantly at Elysium or the caern, and we can appreciate that the gatherings that
they have with the others of their kind in the city are sporadic occurrences rather
than the norm of an evening.
The long-running or stabilized chronicle can be identified by a number of
common elements. It has been in regular play for well over a year, and it has
established a strong set of house interpretations of the published Mind’s Eye
Theatre rules. A communications network (email lists and/or phone numbers) is in
place, and people are responsible for overseeing and maintaining it. Regular game
sites have been found, and a set of protocols for dealing with incoming new players
has been developed. The Storytellers have probably changed at some point,
although some of the original members may still be in their original position. It’s
likely that players have moved up to fill Narrator and Storyteller positions, and the
chronicle has worked out a way to deal with such transitions. In other words, the hard
work has been done, and the chronicle can settle in for the long haul. As long as the
stories remain fresh and interesting and the staff is prepared to handle the workload,
there is no reason why a chronicle cannot continue for many years.

Any game that plays regularly for a long time will evolve. Themes and moods
that were explored at the start of the chronicle may no longer be applicable to the
ongoing plot arcs, perhaps due to the actions of characters or because the plots that
pointed up those themes and moods have been resolved. The departure of regular
players and the arrival of new people can change the face of the chronicle. An

ongoing chronicle becomes a living entity to some extent. As the sum of the
contributions of everyone involved, the flow of the game will change depending
upon those contributions.

Your theme doesn’t have to vary from month to month, but it may do so. As a
Storyteller, you will need to decide whether you will allow the characters to
determine the theme and mood, or whether your subtle manipulations of plot, story
and Storyteller characters will maintain the prevailing feel of the game. You and your
team of Storytellers and Narrators can influence the atmosphere in a variety of ways.
With a large long-running game, multiple themes can arise, and it
becomes difficult with so many different characters (each with their own
motivations and goals) to maintain a strong predominant theme. It’s possible
that every theme that has ever been mentioned in a White Wolf book is in use
at any one time to some degree as the players take control of the action and
swing the chronicle into areas that the Storytellers had not considered.
Enthusiastic players will have their own ideas about how the theme of a
chronicle affects their characters, and their roleplaying will shape the overall
theme and mood of the chronicle in due course.
If a predominant theme of chaos, for example, kick-starts the chronicle — the
previous prince has been murdered, and the city must re-establish order — then
eventually the chaos will subside as the characters find a new prince and stabilize the
Camarilla presence. While this story arc is fine for a one-shot or short-term game,
that predominant theme will pass its use-by date very quickly in a long-running
chronicle, and another theme must be introduced or developed. However, with the
exit of one theme comes the entrance of another, and the motivations of the
characters will likely shape the theme of the next game. If one vampire becomes
prince to the detriment of another, revenge may be the next theme. If the choice is
unpopular, rebellion may become the flavor of the month.
HISTORY
ISTORY

ISTORY
Every event in a game becomes a slice of the chronicle’s communal story. All
the characters contribute to it, whether they do so as pivotal main characters, foils,
supporting roles or cameos. The history of the chronicle continues from the jump-
off point that the Storytellers provided initially, and the game then grows in its own
unique direction.
As a game ages, it is fun to look back over the prior months or years and
summarize the turning points in various characters’ development. Amusing anec-
dotes, rumors and tall tales all shape the history of any community, and the collation
of these memories gives the game a stronger sense of depth with each passing year.
The players are acquainted more intimately with the major story that they have
constructed — the story of the world in which their characters exist.
A common phenomenon among players of a chronicle that helps keep the
history of a game alive is the telling of “war stories” — remembrances of events in
games past. As with traditional storytelling, this verbal sharing of events can
educate new players in important events in the setting’s history and give them an
idea of the style of chronicle they are playing. The stories are typically of the, “No
shit, there I was…” variety, and they are biased from the character’s point of view;
but then what first-person view of any history wasn’t biased by the observer? Much
of the World of Darkness information in various tabletop books is biased from the


16
Dark Epics
Dark Epics
point of view of the “writer,” and disparate views of the “true history” are common.
Listeners are welcome to have their own opinions on the validity of any reiteration
of events past.
Having said that, a number of chronicles do keep records of their games’
histories with some degree of accuracy so that new players (and old-timers) can gain
a sense of the development of the chronicle over time.

As a game grows, it must develop strategies for dealing with new players,
whether those players are experienced roleplayers or complete novices. A new
player’s unfamiliarity with the nuances of your chronicle can disrupt the smooth flow
of roleplaying your regulars have come to expect.
Training novices can absorb a considerable amount of time, although the
majority of their learning will occur as they play the game. They need to learn at
least the basics of the genre and setting of the game, as well as some of the parlance,
how to handle simple challenge situations and how to interact with the other
gamers. A non-roleplayer’s first time at a LARP can be a very daunting experience,
and these new players will benefit from some careful attention and mentoring. If
the inexperienced player is inundated with information and thrown to the wolves,
he may not have a very rewarding experience, and he may not return. You lose
more players that way….
Experienced tabletop players may be old hands at roleplaying, but they have
never been in a LARP or in a World of Darkness game, they may need training in
the new rules and systems. They also need to be brought up to speed on the setting,
network protocols and any other situations that are particular to your chronicle. Any
player who presents herself to your chronicle thinking that she already knows
everything may have a good background in other people’s games and her own
interpretations of the rules or genre. However, she needs to be aware that she is
entering your unique chronicle, with its own variations and expected behaviors.
An established chronicle should have systems in place to deal with incoming
players, perhaps including training sessions (“Kindredgarten”) to introduce them to
the various aspects of the game. Even experienced players in your own chronicle may
benefit from such education. The more familiar your players are with your interpre-
tation of the World of Darkness, the higher the quality of roleplaying you can expect
from them will be. If people are well-trained in the rules systems you use, the burden
on your Storytellers and Narrators is less, since your players are more self-sufficient
in resolving challenges or rules disputes.

How do you handle the chronicle’s project coordination when dealing with
hundreds of players? What sort of things will you need to consider when planning
a convention? How does a network determine its structure and rules? There’s a lot
more to running a large game than initially meets the eye, and most of the work that
must be done occurs behind the scenes. The following chapter explores these areas
of concern in greater detail.

The goal of the Mind’s Eye Theatre system is to help players have fun
roleplaying and acting out stories. In larger games, some categories of rules begin to
fray, and sometimes the rules won’t fit the situation. House rules and spot-rules may
be suitable for a smaller-scale game, but they may also cause confusion among a mass
of visiting players who are not familiar with your personal style. Can you avoid half-
hour time stops while a whole room attempts to see through a Nosferatu’s Obfuscate?
What happens when a character attempts to spend Influence across a network to
affect a member chronicle located several states away? And just how do you run a 10-
second mob combat without stopping the game for an hour and a half? Chapter
Three answers these questions and collects some of the disparate basic information
that has appeared in various Mind’s Eye Theatre books thus far.

elements do you need to provide the players in order for them to do just that? Chapter

Say you’re organizing a huge game. Your players are champing at the bit to turn up and
tell larger stories than they’ve imagined before, and you’ve come up with the killer plot for
the chronicle. But you’ll need to sort out a few mundane details before you even get to the
game itself. These details comprise the kind of irritating stuff that obstructs your creativity,
stifles your plotting and crunches into your characterization time. Don’t ignore them,
however. The more attention you devote to these elements, the better your large game
experience will be, especially if you want your huge game to rock the players’ world.

In small LARPs, the players can select what they want to play within the
Storyteller’s comfort zone. In networks, a degree of compromise is required to
balance the playing field for all the chronicles involved. In large games, the present
population will have a bearing on the choices that are available to a player.
Because the players and Storytellers in a seven-person game are able to negotiate and
define the entire world themselves, character creation and setting are very different from
a game that incorporates many cities. When 100 players are involved, the established ratios
in the World of Darkness play a role in character creation. The conventions of the genre
start to unravel when the Lasombra antitribu outnumber the Brujah two-to-one. The World
of Darkness source material gives indications of the likelihood of X character type being
present in any given setting, and these guidelines should be followed to preserve the genre.
For example, the appearance of the Harbingers of Skulls has doubtless led to
players asking for access to them as a new and unique character type. The tabletop
Guide to the Sabbat suggests that Harbingers are most suitable as Storyteller
characters, due both to their strangeness and their rarity. While a Sabbat-based
chronicle may have a stronger argument for the presence of such beings, the tabletop
books clarify that their presence within the Sabbat is still small and that the Harbingers
“are all at least eighth generation, and hundreds (if not thousands) of years old.”
From the same source material, the Kiasyd interact rarely with other vampires,
and they devote their time to contemplation and research. Such an existence makes

them a poor choice for a live-action game, except perhaps as a Storyteller character
mentor or sage whom the characters may encounter eventually.
Would you expect to see a changeling in an Elysium? Not for very long, unless they
intend to be overcome by Banality. Then there’s the tradition of the Masquerade to
consider. Use some common sense when deciding what characters you will allow in your
chronicle, especially when it comes to cross-genre concepts. Werewolves and vampires do
not play nicely in the sandbox together, despite the common misconception that
werewolves are cozy with the vampires of Clan Gangrel. How many Corax or Bastet are
acceptable at a caern? If you are running a multi-genre chronicle, you may need to stretch
the conventions of each genre a little to allow for these exceptions. If you are in a stand-
alone game, this choice is a personal issue for the chronicle. If you are in a network, then
you must establish the compromise level in line with the worldview shared by the network.
How many elder-class characters will you allow in your chronicle? If you already have
15 elders in a 70-player game and another player presents you with his new eighth-generation
Tremere from 13th-century France, can you justify allowing another elder into play? Genre-
based demographics again can assist as a guideline. If you prefer a glib, face-saving line, try,
“Too many officers, not enough grunts.” In order for your game to portray a reasonably
accurate representation of the Jyhad, the Methuselahs have to have someone to toy with, the
elders need someone to manipulate, and the ancillae need someone to kick around. Is it vital
to the concept that the character’s generation be that low? Some Storytellers may prefer that
their players alternate their characters’ relative power levels when they switch from one
character to the next. In such an arrangement, not only is the potential for power shared
among the players, it also allows the individual player to experiment with different levels of
the political dynamics and expand his roleplaying capacity.
You should also consider the background and outlooks of the character concept
as they are presented to you and balance the suitability of the personality type with
the personality demographics that are already present within the chronicle. If you
already have half a dozen Brujah bikers, do you need another one? Why not make
the biker a rebellious Ventrue neonate? You’ve added a totally cool character twist
right off the bat. The archetypes of the clans and tribes allow for an incredible degree
of versatility in their membership, and it can be tiresome to reinforce the stereotypes
constantly. The flip side of this concern is that you do need to make sure that the
stereotype is maintained before the exception becomes the rule and all your
incoming Ventrue characters are gum-snapping street-rats.
Any aspect of a character concept can be altered slightly to create a distinctive
personality. While it is certainly easier for a new player to dive into an archetype,
more experienced players should be able to come up with interesting variances from
the norm that still conform to the common expectations.

Similarly, any deviation from the actual place and time in which the players are
involved has to be explained meticulously to large groups. This is especially true if you
play your game in an environment that is not identical to the in-game location.
Imagine the out-of-play disaster that happens when the group patrolling the park
accidentally comes into the same play area as the group hunting in the forest, and it
takes several rounds to figure out that the groups are not in the same place in character.
In a large game, you will probably have reached the demographic limit of your
supernatural population unless you’re living in a major city. For the Camarilla, the
Masquerade demands a low-impact presence. The common ratio is one Kindred to 100,000
mortals, so seven million people could support a population of roughly 70 vampires as long


21
Logistics
Logistics
as the vampires took extra care to keep a low profile. If only a few hundred thousand people
live in your town, then you should theoretically only have a handful of Kindred present.
Some games basing their chronicles on the town in which they play embellish
the in-game mortal population in order to accommodate more vampires. The World
of Darkness is more populous and more sprawled than our reality, and a population
boost of the faceless masses shouldn’t stretch a player’s imagination farther than it
already has been stretched to play a vampire in the first place.
You will also need to consider how much larger that decision makes the city in terms
of geography. You’ll want to consider drawing up a new map based on the expanded
numbers. Where are the schools and hospitals to support these additional people? How
has this expansion affected the economy of the region? Extrapolation of your current real-
life setting should provide you with most of the answers to these questions, but you’ll need
to have that information when your players want to start throwing Influence about.
Actually, Influence is another factor that you’ll need to consider, especially if it is
an important point of conflict between the characters in your chronicle. How much is
now available due to the enlarged population? How high are the standards of leadership
and law enforcement? Even if you do not have an expanded populace, consider how
much of the Influence available in the city is taken up by the characters, and how much
may be in the hands of mortals or other Storyteller characters. A city is not an ever-
expanding resource that gains an additional three Traits of Church Influence just because
another Tremere arrived in town. If you choose to place a limit on Influence, then you
will need to tell players who join the game that you are doing so.
If your city setting has been addressed in any of the World of Darkness books,
are you using the same information as is written, or have you altered certain pertinent
pieces of history or public knowledge that need to be clarified for someone who might
have read the source material? Is your Baltimore still a Camarilla city? Perhaps the
Ventrue truly rule your Las Vegas?
The chronicle should develop an information package to inform visitors and
new players of the notable differences between the real-life city setting and the
setting, as their characters will perceive it.

If you prefer to keep the city’s size within reasonable limits, but you also
wish to have a large player base, remember that players can have an equally
rewarding game playing ghouls or kinfolk. Having them do so also promotes the
internal hierarchical structures of the creatures in the World of Darkness and
develops a darker mood for the chronicle.
Sure, it might suck that your character can’t get kewl powerz and stuff and
you can die really easily, but with clever play, you can develop a character that
can challenge the more powerful supernatural creatures on a different playing
field. So you’re the legal advisor to the Ventrue Whip? How might she reward you
if you can use your Bureaucracy Influence to tie the hands of an opposing Kindred,
especially if you do it before she realizes that it needs to be done? Perhaps you’re
working for the Setites, and you can lay your hands on better dope than they can.
Players, why limit yourself to playing blood-sucking creatures of the night,
when the day can be your playground, and you still get Potence? Or rather, why
not consider a more dynamic character than a stuck-in-time predator? Con-
sider the potential for drama that is inherent in playing a servitor who both
loves and loathes the monster who grants them eternal youth… for a price.

Networks require an even higher level of attention to initial characters and setting. Rules
for character-type distribution, setting variations and using places that are not in any of the
participating cities have to be worked out between all the Storytellers in all the chronicles.
Networks must develop policies to deal with these sorts of issues before they arise.
A unified view of the genre will assist in determining acceptable character-entry
levels of power or rarity. If the network has established that the Ravnos antediluvian
has not died in India yet, then Clan Ravnos may be a freely accessible choice. If he has
died, and the clan was decimated as per the World of Darkness setting, then the
network may choose to restrict access to that clan since only a hundred or so are
supposedly left on Earth. Similarly, if the network decides that characters should be
limited to a specific power level (for example, a maximum of eighth generation, or 200
Experience Traits), then that decision must apply across the board.
How will you handle the exchange and manipulation of Influence between
networked chronicles? The Fame Background gives some basic ground rules for how
this sort of interaction could be handled, but you will need to be ready for the
possibility of people manipulating Influence that has already been taken by other
denizens. If no Street is left to tweak, whose toes will get stepped on if a neighboring
Glasswalker decides to help out his buddies with some loaned Influence?
Storytellers are advised to avoid making major decisions about how their plots affect
places that are not within their geographical area of jurisdiction, in case a game in that area
decides to join the network. It is terribly embarrassing when a new city joins a multi-city
chronicle with a great background only to find out that the new city was a radiation zone
in the existing chronicle. If you do need to do something external to your chronicle, bring
it up with the others of your network and make a communal decision to determine a “safe”
place for the external event to occur. What are the chances that the other chronicles might
pick up the plot and run alongside you with it? Pretty good, since you’re all on the same team.

While a strong character background is important in any chronicle, a network
provides wonderful opportunities for further cross-chronicle interaction through char-
acters in different cities sharing aspects of their backgrounds. If a character originates in
Saint Louis, and your network has a member chronicle there, then elements of that
chronicle’s setting should be reflected in the character’s own past. Rather than having
to create a background from whole cloth, the player can use highlights from events in the
chronicle’s past to enrich the character’s viewpoints and history.
For vampire characters, the opportunities abound to create detailed and structured lineages
that can interlink chronicles through broods. Considerable depth can be added to a character
if the vampire has a solid line of Kindred to look back on for examples. This is especially true for
familial clans, such as the Ventrue and Giovanni. It opens up possibilities for interaction on a
wider scale instantly if the lineage relates characters in several chronicles. Although those
characters need not be the best of friends, or even loosely allied, a thread still binds them, and
it can be plucked by the clever Storyteller to increase the drama in the network.

One of the largest and most immediate problems you may face in the ongoing
administration of your large game will be finding a place to accommodate everyone.
You can hold a smaller game at someone’s house, at the park or at a friendly nightclub
or cafeteria. Cramming a couple hundred caped carnivores into such a place may be
stretching the realms of plausibility, however.

A site for a large game needs multiple rooms for private meetings, centralized halls
for assemblies, outside areas for a bit of fresh air (and to allow your smokers some
breathing room), just like a smaller chronicle’s game site does. The site must be large
enough to handle your volume of players, yet small enough so the storytelling and
narrating team isn’t running the equivalent of a half-marathon each night. Consider
convention halls, hotels or large nightclubs. And yeah, it’s probably going to cost some.
Finding a site that will be suitable for your chronicle will take some legwork, but
you’re best to start off letting your fingers do some walking. The phonebook is a great
place to start, and it costs less than bus fare or gas. Check for hotels, rental
accommodation, clubs, convention centers, camping grounds, parks, schools, enter-
tainment venues, theatres, anyplace that might be able to handle the number of
people that you anticipate attending. Your local city council may be able to help, and
it may have personnel on staff to deal with just such matters.
While you’re looking for a game site, you will definitely benefit from drawing
upon the knowledge and experience of your players and staff. Someone may know
of a place that might be suitable or know someone who knows. Perhaps they even
know whom to contact for costs, availability and capacity.
By the way, this exercise also increases your area knowledge of your hometown,
which makes it a very useful research method for locations, areas of importance and
likely targets of story focus for your chronicle if it is based there.

Now that you’ve selected a handful of prime sites, check them out in person.
(Don’t just throw away all your options except the one that has the most Gothic-
Punk name.) Make an appointment with the site’s staff to walk over the site during
the day so that you can get a feel for the room and accessibility. A venue will always
feel smaller at night, but if it’s small from the outset, it will feel stifling and cramped.
Check the place out at night as well, if you intend to play during the darker hours.
Is the site one big hall? A bonus for crowd scenes, but it’s not so wonderful if it’s
the only room you have. It is very hard to run a large game in one open room due to
the noise level, if nothing else. Look for enough space to hold two thirds of your
players comfortably in the main hall, and enough space in other rooms to accommo-
date two thirds as well. If you have extra space, consider it a bonus. Treasure it. Silent,
deserted areas of large premises beg for covert scenes.
Keep an eye on ambience and layout. Dormitory-style rooms connected by long
corridors produce a different mood than partitioned offices. A theater has a different
room structure than a hotel. Consider where your props and/ or background music
will be best suited and which rooms will lend themselves to the various moods you
may wish to engender in your players during the game.
Ask which aspects of the premises you may be able to modify and what built-in facilities
might be used. It is unlikely that a venue used regularly by a number of different groups will
allow you to redecorate to any great extent. If you can get permission to twist out a few light
bulbs, however, or even use the PA system for the authority figure’s announcements, then you
have another set of setting tools for your Storyteller team. Always ask before burning candles,
however. The site’s fire standards may prohibit their use, or their sprinkler system may be very
sensitive. After all, nothing dampens a game like… well, okay.
Accessibility will be another concern. Make sure that you can give easy
directions to your players when you notify them of where the site is. Keep an eye out
for quick routes from major roads, and note nearby landmarks that will assist in


24

navigation, such as parks, monuments or large buildings. Also identify other
important local conveniences, such as the closest gas station and the local late-night
café for the inevitable after-game coffee and chat.
If you are expecting disabled players to show up, make sure that they will be able
to move about freely. If you have young players, check the host’s policy on their
presence. Check to see if any insurance matters must be dealt with in the rental of the
premises, or whether the rental fee covers that cost. As with any contractual
agreement, know your responsibilities and your rights. Consult a lawyer if you have to.
Privacy is always a concern, and you should cast an eye toward the neighbors when
selecting your game site. It may be beneficial to check with the owners of the venue to find
out what the patrons of the neighboring premises might think if it looks at all likely that
they may take note of the game. Your primary ally remains communication, and it will be
worthwhile to talk with those neighbors if you think that they’ll be concerned. You do not
need the local authorities casting baleful glares over your activities because an uninformed
witness is alarmed by the strange events he has seen taking place next door.
Finally, consider the cost of rentals. If you can get the place free, that’s all good, but
it’s likely that you’ll have to shell out. How you work out payment is really up to you and
beyond the scope of this book. We might suggest considering forming your game into an
incorporated club, but your game will need to find out what is required by local laws. If
it’s for a one-shot event (like a convention), then we seriously suggest financial advice.

If you have an ongoing large game, then you’re likely to want to hang on to the
ideal venue you’ve found. You will need to consider the viewpoint of the host or
landlord. On one hand, he’s ensuring the booking of his venue on a regular basis. On
the other hand, he may have others who want to reserve the venue for the same nights
you planned to play. Be prepared to negotiate such matters, and schedule your games
around his timetable as much as possible. Is there a difference between Friday and
Saturday for you and your players? How about the third Saturday instead of the first?
Are Sundays an option? Be flexible, and you will find your host flexible in return.
You’ll also need to be prepared to explain your hobby to this person who has no
idea of what you’re up to. While a convention of strangely dressed people throwing
arcane hand signals at each other may be a mild social blip as a once-off, regular
occurrences of such behavior may draw some concern from the management. You’re
better off explaining what you’re involved in so they and their staff understand what
you’re into is just a game. Heck, some of them might even want to join in now and then.
Encourage your players to respect the property. If the management doesn’t want
people leaving cigarette butts scattered around the premises, make sure that the smokers
pick up after themselves or use the appropriate receptacles. Don’t allow players to go
through “Staff Only” doors. Try to leave the place cleaner than it was when you arrived.
Remember that your hosts don’t have to rent to you, and you don’t want to have to go
looking for another place too often if you can help it. Actually, this little piece of rocket
science goes for any game at any venue. If you want to use the place again, look after it.
All games should observe a kind of out-of-character Masquerade when it comes to
dealing with the non-playing public. One of the primary rules of Mind’s Eye Theatre is Be
Mindful of Others. This rule becomes ultimately important when you have 400 Gothic-Punk
characters in everything from leather to lace milling about. Be aware that you are not just
responsible for the reputation of the game, but also the reputation of the venue. The owners
make their living from the property. To have it devalued due to the foolish antics of a few
misbehaving players can be disastrous to their cash flow. It may also lose you your site.

It will also be helpful to be on good speaking terms with local law-enforcement
authorities. In some cities, you may actually be required to register any assemblage
of people, especially if you are gathering in a public place.

Organizing a venue is a considerably easier task for a convention game than it
is for a long-term chronicle. You’ll only need the place for a night or a weekend, and
booking availability for a once-off is simpler to get than trying to persuade the
establishment to keep every second Saturday free for gaming.
If your game is being run alongside a large established gaming or sci-fi
convention, chances are you will be allotted space by the convention organizers in
accordance with your requested space and the number of players you project to
attend. Having the convention staff handling some of your work will also mitigate
considerations such as insurance, registration, security and publicity.
If you’re on your own, then here are a few things to consider:
You can never quite tell how many people may turn up at a convention, especially
if you have thrown it open to all comers. With a regular game, you have a more accurate
figure of how many are likely to be in attendance at any one time. You will need to make
an intelligent guesstimate as to how many people are likely to attend and thereby what
size venue you will require. You then need to balance the final selection of venue with
the cost overall and the cost-per-head you will be charging the gamers. Remember that
initial enthusiasm can dampen over time, and the flurry of “Hell yeah!” letters may die
off when the potential players see the registration fees.
Conversely, convention games can get really big really fast. You are better off
capping the number of people in attendance based on your venue rather than trying
to cram extra players in over and above fire safety regulations. While it may seem
impolite, pre-registering your players and refusing non-registered entry can alleviate
potential crowding issues if you have a comparatively small venue. If you advertise
your event by saying that pre-registration is required, you are less likely to offend
those who turn up on the spur of the moment when you have to turn them away.
Don’t rush your decision for a convention venue. Other considerations such as
accommodation for visitors (hotels versus crash-space), availability of late-night
refreshments, public transportation hours and routes all should be taken into
account before you sign on the dotted line.
If you’re expecting out-of-towners to arrive, you will need to make doubly sure that they
can find the site. Scout out multiple routes from each of the major entrances to the city. Publish
those directions online for the visitors. Make someone (or several people) with a cell phone
responsible for taking calls from lost players. Make sure they know the directions as well.

If you’re storytelling in an area that someone else has arranged for you, then make
sure you reconnoiter the site well in advance of the game. You will need to know your
territory, so that if you’re contacted to meet another Storyteller, you have a point of
reference and don’t get lost on the 14th floor while they await your arrival in reception.
Check out the site with your Storyteller/ Narrator team, and sort out which areas will
be appropriate for set-scenes you may have scripted. Decide which areas will be communal
gathering places that all the characters in the game can reach, which areas will be “secure”
(the Chantry, the sewers, the freehold, etc.) and which areas are designated for out-of-
character relaxation. Make signs so the players will know which areas are off limits. If you have
the staffing capabilities, assign Narrators who are familiar with the workings of the Chantry,
sewers, freehold, etc., to supervise those specific areas when play is in progress there.

Define in advance (and clear with the venue’s staff) the outside borders of your
game area. Players may wander out of the game zone and inadvertently disrupt staff
at work or others present in the venue.

When you run a large game, you’ll need to make sure you have the resources to
administer your group of players adequately. Booking venues, printing character
sheets and badges, website hosting… all these things take time and resources your
average mortal may not have available.
Your biggest issue is likely to be financing the ongoing expenses, such as rental
of the game venue, printer paper and ink. Of course, the upshot is that if you can’t
afford the location, you’re unlikely to be able to continue using it.
Generally, charging players for game attendance or club membership can cover
administrative costs. You are strongly advised to seek accounting advice before
embarking on any such mission. Your local accounting laws may require registration
of your game as a club, non-profit or not-for-profit organization. The finances may
be considered income for one or more of your members and therefore taxable. If you
have to fork out your own cash, you may need to obtain reimbursement from the
players. Money can be one of the biggest bugbears of a game, and proper handling
of the finances of a game will reduce tensions due to such matters.
Time is the other less-considered major resource. There’s never enough of it,
and if you’re trying to run a large game with a minimal staff, you’ll run out of it sooner
or later… normally sooner. If you’re holding down a day job and you find that the
chronicle may as well be a second form of employment because you’re topping 50
hours a week on it, it may be time to farm out some of the work.
Optimize the use of your storytelling team by arranging cohesive meetings and
sorting out issues as or before they arise. If your game is intensive, playing more than
twice a month, then weekly meetings become a must to keep on top of things.
Monthly games can probably survive on monthly meetings unless there is a
considerable amount of downtime activity by the characters to resolve.

All the suggestions in the other Mind’s Eye Theatre books in regards to
setting, ambience, lighting and music apply to large games as well, and you will
find that a bit of hard work in these areas is eventually rewarding. You are dealing
with a larger scale here, and you will find yourself with much more room to fill.
Don’t panic and be tempted to cram as many props as you can into each area.
Your rooms will fill with people quickly, and people obscure properties. You’re
probably better off focusing on a few well-placed and well-presented props in any
one area to establish the nature of that area. A cloth-draped throne on a dais
states “prince’s chamber” as eloquently as a dozen tapestries. A few strategically
placed candelabra will call up the feeling of a Chantry chamber more effectively
than dragging in the taxidermically stuffed alligator and all the glassware from
the local chemist. Allow the players to stretch their imagination without
overtaxing their attention.
If you are fortunate enough to have an established venue and a fair
assortment of regular props, you might be able to negotiate storing your
property with your host. It will certainly save you having to drag the damned
stuff across town every weekend.

With hundreds of people involved in your chronicle or network, it becomes
important that everyone is kept informed of any important events or news, both in
and out of character. You will need to be able to notify all your players of the dates
and locations of upcoming games, and they need to know where they can find other
information pertinent to the chronicle. Additionally, your Storytellers will need to
have methods of distributing information quickly to each other and to the players.
The storytelling team also needs to develop methods for handling plot contingencies
and for maintaining the internal records of the chronicle (such as character sheets).
You should consider your policies and procedures for managing such information with
care. Make sure that up-to-date information is available to anyone who needs it, and that
they can contact you (or your designated representatives) easily if they have any questions.
With the expanded options available with today’s technology, you have a
variety of methods for the dissemination of your chronicle’s information.

Perhaps the easiest way for a chronicle to maintain a central repository of game
information is through a website. If you’re not an Internet guru, you should delegate
responsibility of this site to one or two of your players who know how to handle a
website, and make sure that they are fed the necessary information to keep the site
current. One of the biggest killers of websites is stagnation, and if you want to keep
the interest of your Internet observers, you’ll need to update regularly.
Encourage the others in the game to contribute information to the website as
well. Have them submit character profiles, photographs, poetry or whatever else
they feel will be of assistance. A steady stream of player submissions can help reduce
the overall pressure on the Storyteller to create the site from whole cloth while still
handling the rest of the chronicle’s organization.
Setting information is vital. Your chronicle’s historical background, for ex-
ample, will contribute to both new and old players. If you are setting your chronicle
in the city in which you play, reference the differences that would be notable to a
resident. You should already have the majority of this information ready to go if
you’ve done your pre-chronicle set-up thoroughly. The Laws of the Night Camarilla
Guide can help you flesh out your setting if you need some hints.
Your gossip or the player of your harpy (or the Galliards or bards) could be encouraged
to write regular reports on recent important events and the elders’ announcements. They
may even wish to maintain a list of your characters’ status or renown, positions and rumors
or anecdotes about them so that a visitor to the website (and possibly to your chronicle)
can enter the game at least partially informed as to the city’s politics.

A number of free facilities exist on the Internet that allow you to set up email lists
with which you can keep subscribers informed as to the goings-on in your chronicle.
As with your website, you ought to post regularly and keep the information current.
You should schedule a regular posting of your game date and location, perhaps even
your house rules if the file size is small enough. Some of these facilities allow you to share
files via the Internet. If your house rules (or any other files you might share) are larger
than would be considered polite to post in an email (say, 20 kilobytes) you could
provide a link for people who wish to see the latest version when it is released by the
Storyteller team. Include a link to your chronicle’s website as well.

Players will inevitably wish to maintain communications between games,
either in or out of character, so perhaps separate email lists for announcements, in-
character and out-of-character conversations might be an option. As the network
of your game grows, you might even find players who are willing to assist. They might
run clan-, kith- or tribe-specific lists, a list closed to all but the city’s officers, coterie
or pack lists or whatever other kind of list they can come up with.
If you have a team of Storytellers and Narrators, consider running lists for these folks
as well. Having a well-informed staff will result in a slicker chronicle in the long run.

If you have the staff, finances and motivation, you can maintain regular contact with
your players by ringing around to notify them of upcoming games and recent events. However,
doing so can be a costly option, and it is more suitable for smaller chronicles. You could
encourage those players who are on your email lists to contact those without Internet access.
In any case, it is always handy to have a record of the phone numbers of your players
in case you do need to speak with them. Email can be such an impersonal method of
communication, since it lacks any real indication of tonal inflection other than emoticons
and font faces. Additionally, phone conversations are immediate, so you don’t have to rely
on people checking their email accounts regularly. Many people would prefer to deal with
a live voice in real time rather than have to translate an email letter’s potential nuances.
Examine the option of having an information hotline that people can call to
find out game dates and locations, and where they might be able to leave a message
for the Storytellers. If you can afford it, an 800 number (or similar messaging system)
makes a great repository for basic game and contact information for those who don’t
have access to the Internet.

The larger your game is (especially in the case of an interconnected network of
chronicles), the more email is likely to be swapped between players and staff.
Keeping track of all the pieces of information can become a nightmare, so be
prepared to delegate responsibility for separating the wheat from the chaff and
reporting the pertinent issues back up the chain to the storytelling team.
It is also very tempting for players to continue to further plots during downtime via email.
You will need to decide whether this practice is acceptable, or whether you would prefer for
all the action to take place during the actual game. E-scenes (which occur in chat rooms or
via email) may be permissible, but they can be difficult to adjudicate from a Storyteller’s point
of view, unless you are participating in or observing the scene electronically. Requiring players
to keep archives of conversations can help keep “he said/ she said” situations from arising.
Ultimately, the decision as to what actions are permissible via email or chat
rooms is up to you. Determine who is responsible for collating the downtime
information, presenting it to the storytelling team and for reporting any issues that
may have arisen that require urgent Storyteller attention. Keep an eye out for
characters releasing information they don’t justifiably possess. Notify the players of
which Storytellers are available at what times to supervise e-scenes.

If you are truly a Storyteller legend and you can run a 100-plus player game by
yourself, then we worship you. We might also wonder what you do with the rest of your

Storyteller burnout is a Bad Thing, and an entire game can suffer because of it.
Getting others involved in running the game expands your options as a Storyteller,
which allows you to delegate or share responsibility for the chronicle. You can give
specific roles to others, or you can opt to share the overall workload. Hey, doing so
frees up some spare time for eating, at least!

Managing a game and supervising a large number of players are mammoth tasks, and
many chronicles will find it beneficial to divide the Storyteller’s duties among multiple people.
A Storyteller in a small game has a million tasks and details to look after, including
Influence, Storyteller characters, plot arcs, character sheets, Experience Traits, venue
organization and contacting players. What a mission! Chances are good that even a
small chronicle will need to share the duties of handling the out-of-game organization.
The Storyteller team structure has many forms, depending on the preferences
of the people involved. Your preference may be different that the ones we discuss
here, but as long as your communication, compromise and courtesy issues are
addressed and your players are happy, we’re not going to hassle you.
A common team structure might consist of a head Storyteller and several assistant
Storytellers. The head Storyteller has the ultimate guiding control over the flow of the
chronicle, and she delegates areas of responsibility to her assistants. Perhaps one assistant is
in control of monitoring Influence expenditures and reporting plot developments along those
lines back to the head Storyteller, while another is responsible for the antagonists’ actions.
This structure is really just an expansion of the relationship between Storytellers
and Narrators, but with an intermediary step. Some games may prefer that the
Narrators simply assume such responsibilities. The advantages of this structure are the
facts that the buck stops somewhere and that an ultimate decision-maker is available

Your players can gain a large amount of in-character information each game,
whether they do so from Storyteller sources or from other characters in the chronicle.
In a network, in-character information can come from hundreds of other involved
players who presumably have gotten their information from similar sources.
Many of the “secrets” of the World of Darkness are written up in the various
books from White Wolf, and they will almost inevitably come into play at some
stage during the life of the network. It falls to the Storytellers and the administrators
of the network to ascertain whether or not it is acceptable for sensitive information
(such as the true story of the Cappadocians) to become publicly known. If a
character learns of the information in a valid manner — from a Storyteller, by
witnessing the events or from a reliable source — then it is almost certain that that
information will reach the ears of other characters, unless the character in question
is really good at keeping secrets. Such information then spreads like wildfire via
email and other avenues of modern communication, and it becomes “valid” for the
entire network to have it. Thus the value of that secret is reduced to doggerel.
If you wish to preserve the mystery, then simply don’t allow the information to
be released. Since you’re part of a network, other Storytellers will have decided
whether or not they want their characters to know piece of information. Respect their
decision to conceal information, and ask before you release it. Consultation on these
matters will benefit the entire network and prevent you from having to retract
information, negating several evenings of roleplay and a significant quantity of email.

to resolve any issues that may arise. It can result in the game being somewhat forced,
unless the head Storyteller is open to suggestions and discussion from his teammates.
Another viable team structure consists of equal-measure Storytellers. None
is dominant over the rest, and decisions are made by consensus. This structure
requires a team-development process that is similar to the authority structure, and
it involves considerably more trust and communication between the people
involved. However, it encourages a sharing and growth of ideas, which can be
beneficial to the game as a whole.
Regardless of the structure of your Storyteller team, it requires the acceptance
of the players in order to survive. If the players are not happy with the structure of
the game or the pecking order, then they have the right to vote with their feet and
play elsewhere. If you lose enough players, you won’t have much of a game.

Consider specific roles for each of the people in your team and how you will
determine their responsibilities. For example, you may decide that one Storyteller
is responsible for handling plots, Storyteller characters and Influence. Another
handles character sheets and Experience Traits between games, is in charge of rules
calls during the game, and supervises clans A, B and C. Meanwhile, a third
Storyteller adjudicates clans X, Y and Z, organizes venues and the website. A fourth
handles interaction with other games in a network and non-vampire concerns.
Inevitably, some overlap will occur between the roles and duties, but as long as
everyone knows who is responsible for what aspect of the game, things will run
smoothly. Players in a large game have more confidence when they know that people
have been appointed specifically to address their individual concerns.

You will need to schedule downtime meetings for your team in order to keep each
other abreast of situations that arise within each of your areas of responsibility. Stay on
the same page. If you each forge ahead without knowing what the other heads of the
hydra are doing, you will tear apart the team (and possibly the game). Maintaining
consistency and unity in the decision process will benefit the game in the long run.
Take time to bring everyone up to speed on current plots and character activity.
Consider the reactions of your setting to the plots in motion and how those reactions will be
reflected in your next game. If you have information that should be passed on to one of your
team specialists, this meeting is the time to do it, so that he can do his job more efficiently.

Your storytelling team will be very busy during a large game, and the members
will spend considerable time covering a large area cross-referencing scenes, adjudi-
cating important challenges and portraying Storyteller character. Unless you have
a strong game-plan as a team or you are all naturally telepathic, you need to settle
on a method of transferring information or questions between each other quickly
and efficiently, with minimal disruption to the game in progress.
One useful method is to invest in a set of short-range multi-channel walkie-talkies
or radio-telephones. Separate channels can be set for Storytellers or Narrators, open or
closed conversations, tactical talk or chatter, and so on. These items are somewhat pricey
(check your local electronics stores), but they can save a considerable amount of walking
or having to ask a Narrator to drop out of game to find a player on the other side of the
game site. Multiple people can chat on the same channel, which is very useful if you need
to assemble a team and update your Storytellers on developments. If your wallet can
handle it, cell phones are also useful for such communications. If you’re going to use them,


31

make sure that everyone who requires them has the correct numbers in the cell phone’s
memory and that the phones’ batteries are charged before the game.
Either way, it is useful to arrange meeting place and times for several gatherings of the
staff during the game to touch base on the game’s progress. Taking a few minutes away from
the game will not alter the flow too much, as long as your players are capable of continuing
without you present. Take the time to have a snack and a short rest, and refresh everyone
with any important plot developments, ideas and events that have come up thus far.

Although it may seem that they become less important due to numbers, primary
or long-running Storyteller characters become more pivotal in a large game.
Secondary Storyteller characters, such as incidental mortals or minor flavor charac-
ters, remain important, but the inherent size of the game dictates that the Storytellers
will be called on the play stronger roles.
In a smaller game, it is likely that the Storytellers and Narrators portray the
more powerful characters in a city. In a large game, players will possess most of the
authoritarian positions, so the characters that your team portrays are more likely to
be central plot devices or external authorities. Who handles these characters? Does
one person coordinate all of your Storyteller characters while the team portrays
them, or do you allow the individual team members to play the characters as they see
fit? If your team is coordinated around a central authority, it is likely that that person
will determine these characters’ reactions to events in the game. If you have a
decentralized team, each character will grow in its own direction. However, it
remains important for the team to remain in touch with the plot to determine the
required eventualities of the characters’ actions.
Storyteller characters are no more static than the players’ characters are. Most of the
members of your team are likely to be portraying these characters in the chronicle from
time to time (or on an ongoing basis if necessary). The actions of the players’ characters
will affect each of the Storyteller characters differently. Treat each character as an
individual, just as you would portray the character if you were a player. As in real life,
actions lead to repercussions, and there is no reason that a Storyteller character should
not react appropriately to a situation that challenges his own position. For example, if
you are portraying a Storyteller prince, and a vampire is caught breaching the Masquer-
ade, then you need to punish that character. To ignore the situation is to ignore one of
the conventions of the genre. Of course, the offending character may be able to swing
a deal to escape Final Death, but that’s all part of the in-character politics.

Eventually, one of your team members will become tired, jaded or just plain
burned out as a Storyteller. Storytelling is a lot of work, much of which goes on
behind the scenes, and sometimes it can seem thankless. However, a run-down
Storyteller will only drag the game down with him, and any large game should have
a policy in place when a Storyteller decides to step down.
Whether someone is groomed for replacement, is elected into the position, gravitates
there by general charisma or is just the only person available at the time, the new Storyteller
will need to be brought up to date on current plots and team decisions. He’ll be exposed to
an initial flood of information, much of which has been concealed from him as a player.
You will need to be prepared to bring the new team member up to speed in the areas
that she will be dealing with. The outgoing Storyteller should set aside some time to talk
with the incumbent and detail the necessary information. Transitional difficulties will
reflect themselves into the game, and can cause problems for the players. If a plot suddenly


32
Dark Epics
Dark Epics
turns through 180 degrees for no discernible reason other than a change of Storyteller,
then the suspension of disbelief required for a good game is shattered.
Storytellers who are stepping down have a challenging time ahead of them if
they intend to join in the game immediately as a player. They have a lot of
information about ongoing plots and other characters in the game, which gives them
an unfair advantage over other players. As long as the game is satisfied that the
former Storyteller can separate that knowledge from what his new character may
know, then all is good. If doubt persists, it can color the game experience. It is
advisable for the ex-Storyteller to create a character who is distinctly removed from
any of the plots that he supervised during his tenure.

As long as everyone is on the same wavelength within the team, it becomes
much easier for any member to make a snap decision in the middle of a game without
fear of stepping on another team member’s toes. A unity of purpose and vision gives
rise to additional freedom for interpretation within that vision without disrupting
the whole. When you all know the story, you can tell the story equally well.

If you are part of a larger convention, then it is likely that the convention’s organizers
will require registration for the overall event. If you have additional requirements for people
attending your game — such as character sheets and backgrounds — ask that they be
provided when the players register at the convention itself. If not, you will have to ask the
players themselves for the information in some manner. If the organizers will give you a list
of players and their contact details, get in touch with the players sooner rather than later
and inform them of your needs. If that is not possible, then make sure that the information
about your game in their literature includes your contact information.
It will be useful to compose a record of all the players who attend your game,
along with their contact information, in case you or other convention staff should
need to contact them after the event.

You may have constructed the whole game, including all of the character parts,
which you will assign to players at the convention. If so, you need to let the players
know this in advance. Avoid disappointing those players who turn up expecting to
be able to play their own characters.
If people want to play their own characters, and you are prepared to allow them
to do so, they should be prepared to present them to your Storyteller team prior to
the event. If you have foreknowledge of the characters that are going to be in
attendance and you have some basic information about their backgrounds and
driving goals, then you can tailor plots or sub-plots to suit.
You won’t have time on the night of the game itself for your team to be vetting
characters. You’re expecting several hundred people to walk past your registration desk,
each with a dozen questions. You won’t have time to be sifting through their hand-written
notes wondering how they learned out-of-clan Thaumaturgy or whether the item card for
their six-Trait broadsword is valid according to Laws of the… which book was it in?
Gather the players’ character information as soon as possible so that you can get a feel
for what sort of event you have looming before you. If you are part of a network, you’re more
likely to be familiar with the characters you see posting on the network’s email lists, or you
can deal easily with their Storytellers if you have any questions about the character or player.
If you throw wide the doors to your convention game, you’re in for a wild ride, and you
will need to seriously consider how to handle the likely interactions that will occur at the
event. The characters may have come from wildly disparate game types, and their character
histories might clash. The Camarilla might still recognize the Gangrel as a member clan
in one player’s game. Another might have a different Brujah justicar. Red Star or no Red
Star? If your game’s planned story differs significantly from the World of Darkness metaplot,
then be sure that you let the players know as much before they start playing.
Weigh up all the character submissions in terms of game balance. If something sticks out
like a sore thumb as not belonging, contact the player to discuss the matter. Don’t be afraid
to decline the character if it is likely to be detrimental to the game. The player may be willing
to negotiate some fine points of the character to bring it more in line with your vision. You
might find it useful to contact the player’s Storyteller to verify details of the character.
Even for an event that allows existing characters to attend, your team should
create a number of pre-generated characters for players who turn up short a sheet.
These characters need not be mainstream or headlining characters. You may not
know how many people to expect at the convention. Start with 30 spare sheets, and
keep a few blanks handy for emergencies.
Give your pre-gens more than just Traits. Create goals, plots and interaction
hooks so that the player has a kick-start into the game. You don’t want to get bogged
down in character creation and approval when you should be running the game or
portraying a plot-critical Storyteller character entrance. You certainly don’t want to
spend the rest of the evening answering, “So what was my motivation in this scene?”
Don’t be tempted into creating a stack of eighth-generation powerhouses. The World
of Darkness focuses more closely on the underlings of the various species. Create ghouls, high-
generation vampires, fosterns and adren. Resist the urge to scatter the sheets with extra Traits
unless that character’s age, history or experience absolutely demands it. A starting-level
neonate can have as much, if not more, roleplaying potential than a brooding but static elder
vampire, and a player is more likely to play such a character believably. If you need to have
powerful Storyteller characters in the game, then give those characters to your team to play.
Your Storytellers and Narrators will already know their expected roles and have rehearsed

them prior to the event. Besides, the more underdogs who are running around for the elders
to play with, the more representational of the society in question your game can be.

Before the event, establish who is in control of what aspects of the game. Meet
with your team well in advance and coordinate. Know which Storytellers will
control which physical areas of your venue and aspects of the overall game.
Nominate your Narrators. Designate those folks who will play your Storyteller charac-
ters, and make sure that they are aware of their required roles. Make sure that they are familiar
with any genre discrepancies or house interpretations of the standard rules that may apply to
the game so that everyone is on the same planet when the questions come flying.
Know your territory and your limits. Communicate with the other convention staff
(if you’re part of a larger convention) about their expectations, and don’t go beyond them.
Prepare the same information for presentation to the players. Know where you can play your
game and where you are trespassing. Learn the venue’s emergency procedures and your roles
in an emergency. Think for a moment about potential first-aid requirements. Having a few
hundred people in a confined area can lead to accidents, as much as we hope it won’t.
Conduct a thorough examination of the site as a team. Learn the quickest routes through
the game site so that you and your players won’t get lost. Identify any areas that you think
should be of concern in regards to safety and consider striking them from the game zone.
Think about how you will handle communication during the game. Consider
investing in some short-range, multi-channel walkie-talkies so that you can keep in
touch with each other from across the game site. Make sure they meet local radio
control specifications. These devices can be invaluable tools for plot coordination,
scene timing and even simple rules matters.

Encourage players to turn up as early as possible (or feasible) on the day of the
event. Deal with all of the bookkeeping and discussions in advance of the actual
game. Reserve the game time for the game itself. The front desk is not a hangout.
At this stage, players should receive a copy of their character sheets and any notes
that may have been prepared for them. Willpower and special Trait tokens can be
distributed alongside item cards. If you are concerned about players altering character
sheets, print them on event-specific letterhead, and accept information only from
sheets that have that letterhead during the game. Keep copies of all official sheets for
Storyteller reference. If you have access to a laptop computer and a portable printer,
bring them along so that you can print out more information (or copies) quickly.
Hand each player a copy of the house interpretations of the Mind’s Eye Theatre
rules that are in play for the night, as well as a basic information and rumor sheet so
that they have an idea of what they are facing in the hours to come. Take this
opportunity to inform the players of any special conditions of play and any out-of-
game rules that you (or the convention staff) expect them to abide by, and let them
know what might happen if they decide to break those rules.
As your Storytellers and Narrators arrive, hand them pre-printed badges to
denote their out-of-character position. Doing so makes them more easily recogniz-
able to players during the game should they be needed.

least the basics of the rules in order to minimize their potential disruption to the rest

Naturally, one would expect that any experienced roleplayer would be only too
happy to assist a new player in learning the rules as they come up, but having at least
a basic familiarity with challenges will make a world of difference.
It may be helpful to form the new players into small coteries or packs under the
watchful eye of a Narrator, so that they have a central personal resource for
information and rules assistance. Perhaps the Narrator can play an ancilla with her
brood of childer, or a den mother with her cubs. The Narrator can then mentor the
new players and act as a roleplaying buffer for them as need be.

Our games deal with mature and adult topics. With this fact in mind, make a policy
early in your pre-event organization about whether you will allow minors to attend. If the
game that you are planning to run will explore adult themes, consider your local laws on
exposing minors to such issues. If young players are going to be at the game, it is advisable
that you get a signed permission and disclaimer form from their parents. Of course, you
might like to invite the parents to come and play with their children.

Before the game starts, assemble all the players in a central area for some
Storyteller quality time. With a large number of players present, it will be too difficult
to give each person the individual attention he needs. Take half an hour to an hour
to cover any salient points that you need to address with the players.
At this time, introduce your Storyteller and Narrator staff, so that the players will
know whom they can deal with for out-of-character matters. Point out their nice badges.
Note that they are the officials for the event and that they have final say in any rules
interpretations or plot calls. Also introduce any administrative staff that will be available
for player queries or matters of emergency. Outline any safety issues and procedures.

It happens. Your convention game’s been rolling smoothly for the last four
hours, and now 15 players from the GeekCon’s Last Glooming — the LARP that
you heard about going on downstairs — have decided that they want to join
your game because it looks cooler. Meanwhile, the missing pre-registered
players whose car broke down on the freeway are finally pulling up outside. You
need to have a plan in place for dealing with these people.
If you have a strict pre-registration requirement, then non-registered
players are not getting through the door. If you have an open-door policy, then
you may choose to bring the stragglers up to date with the events of the evening,
or you might just throw them in to sink or swim. The latter option can be a lot
of fun for a player — after all, his character wouldn’t know what had gone down
if he had turned up late, would he?
You will also need to go over the rules of the convention game just as you did
with all the players who turned up on time. Sort out a character for them from your
pre-generated sheets, then introduce them into the game as smoothly as possible.
If people have come from another game to your game, you will need to
decide whether they can join in. It might pay to have a quick chat with the
Storytellers of the other game as to why these people have changed their minds,
and then make a decision. Let common sense prevail.

Introduce your plot and setting. Much of this information should be included on the
information sheets that you have already distributed to the players, but it is helpful to them
to reinforce that information verbally. Call forward your key characters so that they can be
identified easily. It’s not very helpful if the Garou of a caern can’t identify their sept’s Warder,
nor does it assist matters if the local established Kindred don’t know who the prince is.
Field reasonable questions and allow some time for chitchat. If the noise level rises too
high, call people back down to order and move the conversation along. People will by now
be champing at the bit to game on. Frantic roleplayers are a scary lot, and you’re already eating
into their game time. Deal with any lingering issues quickly and firmly, and move on to the
next question. Allow a few moments of comic relief, sure, but don’t waste too much time.
Announce the start and end times of your game, as well as any intermissions or
scheduled assemblies. If the game is to continue over several nights, talk about the
timing and procedures that pertain to the subsequent nights.
Split the players up into their respective coteries, cities, septs, social cliques, whatever.
They should spend the next half-hour or so getting to know each other’s characters and
faces. This is where your prepared background and information sheets come in handy again.
Then let them loose.

You’re going to be run ragged keeping track of dozens of scenes, coordinating
numerous Storyteller characters and tweaking an amorphous plot that will change

some semblance of control over the masses and making sure that people are having fun.

Deal with these people as quickly as you discover them. You will have laid out your
ground rules at the start, so all the players will be aware of the expected codes of
conduct. You have too many people to deal with and too few staff to be policing the
game constantly, and you will have no time to deal with cheese-heads, whiners, gun-
bunnies or whatever you want to call them. Make it a “one warning then you’re out”
situation. That said, deal with all such situations politely. Courtesy will not hurt the
situation, and it may defuse it before it escalates into a nasty situation. For example,
if a character is about to start a combat in a game that you have stated will be politically
based, and that will result in a huge time bubble for dozens of players, check the
character’s motivations. If it’s inconsistent with the character’s general personality,
advise the player of the likelihood of disruption and ask him to reconsider the action.
If a player is in breach of the core rules of Mind’s Eye Theater, handle him as you
would any other player. Just because you’re at a convention does not mean that the
rules of play or civility fly out the window. It’s easy for people to become a little over-
excited and make a few simple mistakes, but the core rules exist for a reason. When
people break said rules, you must deal with them firmly and immediately for the sake
of the game. For instance, if the player is engaged in an illegal or harmful activity, call
security and have him removed. You’re not the police, and the people in charge of the
convention or premises have the authority and ability to deal with criminals. Don’t
endanger yourself or others. Also, you don’t want yourself or your large friends being
brought up on assault charges for helping a troublesome miscreant find the door.

may have on other people’s games. If you’re running a stand-alone convention, remain
conscious of the neighbors, and avoid disrupting their normal lives. If you cause overt
disruption, you may find yourselves pointedly uninvited in the future.
It’s possible that your players will intermingle with other convention-goers who
are not involved in the game itself, which can add strain to your game. It can be very
difficult for a player to maintain an in-character posture if he is being distracted by an
elf babe showing more bosom than brassiere or if he’s being glowered at by a passing
Klingon. Encourage your players to keep away from the other non-players during game
play for everyone’s sake. Don’t let non-players get dragged into the game.

If you find that your plots are dying, have a back-up plan. You need to either
spark their interest further or be ready to replace the plot. You can conceivably
combine the two concepts by inserting a new, fresh and exciting plot device that
leads the characters back to the over-arcing story. If the plot is a dead duck, cook it
and eat it. There’s little point in letting it stink up the game. Have spare plot threads
available for such contingencies. Even red herrings can spark a whole new concept
for story that you might not have thought of. Be prepared to wing it.

Your players have come a long distance to play, so encourage them to remain in
character as much as possible. Although it is very tempting for players to sit around and
chat about what’s happened in their character’s histories, they are there for a reason,
and that reason is to play your game. Ask people to save their out-of-character
moments for non-game time. There is plenty of time afterward for chitchat.

Someone is going to complain about something somewhere along the line, be it
due to plot (“This is nuts! Since when did the Brujah know so much about the
Salubri?”), rules (“But we play Aura Perception like this back home.”) or events (“I don’t
think it’s in character for the Ventrue justicar to deal with that situation by killing the
prince”). If your Storyteller team is well organized, you should be prepared to deal with
all of these situations. If your convention is part of a network or ongoing chronicle,
then you have the contact information for the players involved in any specific scene
so you can sort issues out after the game is finished. To avoid situations of this sort, keep
your plots and character motivations simple, and keep your rules clear.

network’s rules. Get clearance for anything that requires it well in advance of the
event. Remember that the event is going to become part of the network’s communal
history, and it will affect the development of any network character who attends.
The appearance of any international-level Storyteller characters should be cleared
through the appropriate authorities. Any plots that will affect multiple member
chronicles in the network should be discussed with the Storytellers concerned.

While conventions and large games have much to offer, the potential for plot
and interaction that is available through network games surely overshadows them
both. With the expanded scope and scale of such organizations come a number of
issues that will need to be addressed. Many of the concerns that large games or
conventions need to address are equally applicable to networks, but such mega-
chronicles have considerations all their own.

In order for a network of chronicles to prosper and grow, three primary policies
need to be considered and developed.
COMMUNICATION
OMMUNICATION
OMMUNICATION
OMMUNICATION
OMMUNICATION
Networks need to establish systems of communication that will address the
needs of the organization adequately. While a few simple email lists will suffice for
a small local group of chronicles, when the network grows to encompass an
international audience, the sheer daily volume of email can quickly grow to be
overwhelming. Thousands of emails will pass between characters, either in private
or on established lists. The administrative staff will likewise be in constant commu-
nication as they develop systems and deal with situations as they arise.
Individual member chronicles will be responsible for monitoring local lists (those
that apply to their specific chronicle or geographic area of responsibility) and for
making sure that the quality of information distributed to their players or characters
is consistent with the network’s agreed rules and/ or genre. If it is not public knowledge
that the Assamites have lost their curse, then that information should not appear in
the network unless a justifiable reason exists for the character who releases that
information to have discovered it. Of course, the Storyteller that permitted that
character to have that information will have checked with the administration as to
whether it would be appropriate for the character to know the facts in the first place.
The network will have policies in place to monitor and prevent the release of
such genre-sensitive information, and contingencies planned for informing the
network of any falsely released “facts.” A simple fix for such situations is to require
the characters involved to have an appropriate level of Lore Ability in the specific
area before they are permitted to speak of such issues.
Regular information updates from chronicles to the administration staff are
required in order to monitor the overall status of the organization. Such chronicle
reports can serve to update the network on changes in Storyteller staff, plots or
events that may affect other chronicles, as well as any other matters that are of
specific relevance to the network. These updates allow the network staff to remain
in touch with the member chronicle and deal with any issues as they arise.
In return, reports from the various appointed officials in the network will keep
member chronicles abreast of their opinions and actions, so that the whole can work
as one. That ideal may sound a little airy-fairy, but if you can’t maintain communi-
cations, you can’t maintain a cohesive network.

An independent chronicle has the world at its fingertips. If the staff wants Tipperary

in the Tipperary chronicle may be a tad annoyed to find that their two-year old chronicle
has been demolished at the whim of the Storyteller in Kalamazoo. Member chronicles


39
Logistics
Logistics
need to be prepared to limit their impact on the world outside their immediate area.
Joining a network involves sacrifice, but the reward for that sacrifice is scope.
The degree of compromise will depend on the communal agreement that forms
the foundation of the network. If the network agrees to be guided by a central authority,
then the individual chronicles must be prepared to allow that authority to guide and
even override the Storytellers in how their game develops. If the network provides for
strong chronicle autonomy, then the entire network must be more flexible in order to
allow for variations in interpretation of the overall worldview.
Establishing the level of compromise during the creation of the network will
prevent a number of potential future disruptions. Not every level of compromise will
suit every chronicle that is considering joining a network. Be prepared to shop
around to find a group that suits your preferences.
COURTESY
OURTESY
OURTESY

Any community relies upon accepted social graces to survive. A chronicle has an
expected level of behavior, beyond which the individual can expect to be expelled from
that chronicle. Similarly, a network relies upon a communal agreement as to what
constitutes acceptable behavior. Those who decide to transgress those accepted norms and
who disrupt the unity of the organization in so doing can expect to be likewise dismissed.
In a single chronicle, personal problems can be dealt with on an intimate level, but allowing
those personal issues to spill into the community in a network can be very disruptive. No longer
are you dealing with a handful of people, you are presenting yourself to several hundred —
perhaps several thousand — who will expect you to be civil and understanding of others’
viewpoints. You sure as heck can’t please all of the people all of the time, however, and it’s
generally considered polite to know when to bow out of a contentious issue and agree to disagree.
When dealing with email through a network, the additional layer of “netiquette”
must be applied. Many of the folk who are familiar with email will already have
expectations of acceptable levels of behavior, and they will be quick to jump on those
who transgress. Game-related lists are not the place to send your favorite jokes or
surveys unless it is an in-character action. Also, be aware of the typical risks of the
Internet, such as viruses or the sharing of personal out-of-character information.

The majority of the internal administration of a network’s member chronicles
will fall to the chronicles themselves. It is unreasonable of a member chronicle to
expect that the network will handle all of its local affairs. The network will have
expectations of the member chronicles in terms of communications, and it will ask
that the member chronicle share some of the administrative load, especially as it
applies to them. The member chronicle is expected to share any issues that will affect
the network, even in part, and it agrees to abide by the network’s accepted rules and
code of conduct. Additionally, the chronicle is prepared to compromise in order to
conform to the unilateral views of the network in any given area.
The network should not, however, expect a member chronicle to simply be
slavishly devoted to following the party line, nor should the member chronicle be
without voice in matters that affect it. Representation of the chronicle’s interests to
the central authority is required in order to avoid the potential alienation of the


40
Dark Epics

chronicle. Compromise is a two-way affair, and the network must remain open to the
opinions of its members. Just as a Storyteller may vet the opinions of her players to
tweak her chronicle to improve the growth and flow of the game, a network should
approach the member chronicles for feedback on the development of the organization.
The process through which a network handles personal representation can be
immediate or filtered. A network may designate a single person to handle queries from
players, or it may prefer that the queries be presented through the chronicle’s represen-
tative to the administration. Either way, it remains important that any player’s concerns
are addressed, even if just to refer the player back to his chronicle’s staff for solutions.

As mentioned earlier, you will need to have established a defined administration
to handle the out-of-character aspects of your network. Define the roles that are
required and the duties that are attached to those roles. Decide what level of authority
any specific role grants in regards to the network or to any individual chronicle.
For example, the network’s staff, as opposed to any specific chronicle or the
collective mass of chronicles, will monitor the movement of the justicars or other
high-ranking elder vampires. It would be unfortunate if the Brujah justicar were
killed in one chronicle while dispensing justice in another on the other side of the
world! Likewise, the network staff would address issues of the continuity of the genre,
such as monitoring the progression of the metaplot within the World of Darkness
supplements and ascertaining the impact of those plots on the chronicles in the
network. At any time, that information needs to be available to the chronicles that
are interested in examining plots that involve those characters or situations.
Can a tribal coordinator dictate tribal policy without sanction from the
administration? Can someone administering elder-level Storyteller characters over-
ride a Storyteller and insist on involvement in plots? Can someone coordinating a
justicar at the network level insist that a chronicle submit a local archon character
for an investigation? What level of Storyteller veto is available in a given situation?
Deciding on the roles and their authority early in the growth of the network will
both relieve future potential pressure and shape the face of the network. It will also
help shape the decision of any potential applicant chronicle to join.

Consider also your criteria for admitting new chronicles and integrating them
into ongoing plots. They may also have plots that can contribute to the network. A
new member chronicle will go through a period of adjustment and orientation as it
becomes used to the peculiarities of the network. During this period, is the member
chronicle able to contribute to the administration of the network, or would you
prefer that it familiarize itself first?
It is helpful to have an admissions team who can help new chronicles orient
themselves and fill them in on the history of the network. This team will also be
conversant with the network’s rules, and it will be able to address any concerns that
the chronicle has in regards to those rules.
What sort of criteria might you consider for chronicles that wish to join your
network? Will you consider newly formed games, or should they be well established?
Stability may be a major concern if you are not prepared to deal with fly-by-night
chronicles that might not be around in six months. Could the network handle solo
characters that play solely by email, or do you prefer players to be members of an
established chronicle? Ultimately such a character is going to need to be answerable
to a Storyteller, surely.

will respect a firmly stated policy in regards to accepted levels of conduct if you
enforce that policy firmly.
Although this topic is an unpleasant one, problems can arise with people that
wish to consider themselves above and beyond the rules of the community. Having
systems in place to deal with these people can act as a deterrent to such behavior, as
well as giving the network a method of dealing with the situations when they do arise.

Ninety-nine percent of the time, character interaction between chronicles will
be amicable, and no major problems will arise. After all, that’s one of the primary
reasons people become involved in networks — to share their games. As the games
become more closely interrelated, it becomes possible for players to move between
them regularly, especially if those chronicles are geographically close to one another.
Situations may arise in which characters or players decide to move their base
from one chronicle to another for whatever reason. A network must be prepared for
these situations. Is a generic character based in a specific chronicle, or is it considered
to be a part of the network as a whole? If the former is the case, are Experience Traits
from chronicles that the character has visited viable, or should all Experience Traits
be awarded by a character’s “home” chronicle? If the latter is the case, who will award
the character Experience Traits, and who keeps track of the player’s character sheet?
If a character is considered to belong to a home chronicle, what sort of systems
might be needed to administer the transferal of that character to another chronicle,
ensuring consistency of plots in regards to that character? Is it acceptable for a
character to be based in one chronicle when he plays primarily in another? Consider
the impact that such rules will have on the other players in the network.

As a network grows, it will develop its own interpretations of the Mind’s Eye
Theatre systems and rules. It is important that these interpretations be readily
available to any member chronicle and player therein, perhaps through a website or
regular email system. Since you expect every member of your network to share in
your understanding of the published rules, it makes sense to make every effort to
make them available to those members.

Will you have a central set of game rules that every chronicle will use, or will
you allow member chronicles to tailor the Mind’s Eye Theatre individually? The
former will ensure consistency within the network whenever a player goes to visit
another chronicle, and it will reduce the confusion a player may encounter in regards
to her character sheet in such a situation. The latter will allow an individual
chronicle to have its own flavor and maintain its own internal balance.
Construction of a universal set of rules is a huge undertaking (although we’ve
done most of the work for you already), and it involves further compromise on behalf
of the member chronicles. Chronicles that intend to join need to be aware of your
rules when they consider joining. Also consider whether you, as a network, are
prepared to allow exceptions to your established rules. If such is the case, what
mechanisms do you have in place to monitor and permit such exceptions?

This chapter collects the disparate and inconsistent rules and systems from
preceding Mind’s Eye Theatre publications in an attempt to reconcile them with
the particular concerns of a large or long-running live-action chronicle. While
clearing up every lingering question or point of contention to which MET rules are
heir is beyond the scope of this book, this chapter brings together rules and systems
that are common to most kinds of live-action games. It also offers systemic solutions
to problems that are specific to large or long-running chronicles, it offers additional
systems for using the Influence Background, and it answers some sticky questions
that arise when live-action settings cross over.

In any live-action roleplaying game, the main ingredient is not plot or
Storyteller characters or even a realistic world background. The key ingredient is the
players’ characters. The group of characters active in the game will create the core
of stories that everyone who plays in it will be retelling when they all get together
out of game. It is the moments of beauty created between players that mark your game
as something special. A large part of the Storyteller’s responsibility and reward is
getting the players excited about their characters while still having those characters
fit within the larger world that you have created. The Storyteller builds the stage, but
the players are writing the speaking roles in the play.

Every group needs to decide what type of game it wants to play. They have to
decide if they would like to play within just one setting, such as Laws of the Night or
Laws of the Wild, or if they want to explore the possibilities of a fully integrated World
of Darkness, in which all types of creatures appear. Regardless of what the group
decides, some character types just don’t fit. Every setting has a few character types that
are rare or which simply don’t mix well with the standard choices. The obvious
examples are the rare creatures of each genre such as the Nagaraja, True Brujah and
Salubri in Laws of the Night, or the Thallain and Shadow Court in The Shining Host.
CHAPTER THREE:
NUTS AND BOLTS

Likewise, every game has a few players who will want to play those rare creatures.
It is perfectly natural to want to play the special characters, so don’t be surprised when
you get roughly half of any single game asking to play things like Daughters of
Cacophony or Siberakh. One of the best ways to combat this potential is to define your
game early and not be afraid to steer potential players toward similar concepts that fit
within the game’s bounds of reason. If the game is set up as a standard grouping of
Camarilla vampires in an Elysium-style game of politics, it usually doesn’t make sense
if the representation of non-standard clans outnumbers the standard clans.
Eventually, though, you will receive your fifth application for a modern-day Bunyip
or a Scathach Sidhe, and you will come to the point that every Storyteller dreads: telling
the player no. Take a moment to really analyze what the player is asking for. Frequently,
players request to play a special kind of creature, but the character concept that the player
has in mind can work just as well in another, much more reasonable character type. Try
to look at the application from the standpoint of helping the player realize his vision of
a character. Try to find out what that player really wants, then work with him to fit those
goals into the game. Make sure that you resist the urge to simply deny requests without
making suggestions or offering an alternative. No matter how large the game gets, it still
lives and breathes on the perceptions of the players. If the players feel that they will be
denied the opportunity to play what they want — or that the Storytellers are not
considering their wishes — they will find another game.
If Storytellers aren’t careful, they may look around one night and realize that they
have a Camarilla game with almost no Camarilla clans in play, or a Garou game with
more Fera than Garou. There enters into the game a dichotomy that the players may
not be able to voice, but that they will notice. If the game is intended to be a gathering
of the rare and unique, then it will likely go for some time without being a problem.
However, there is a very real risk of becoming known as a game where anything goes.
The opposite is also true, though. Games that keep the levels of rare characters
to very reasonable levels become known for their even-handed approach to
portraying the World of Darkness. If players look around and see only one public
vampire, who is obviously the odd man out, they will receive a very visible message
that your game takes the source material seriously and that you are going to use the
oddities of the setting to reinforce the normal.
When deciding how many rare birds are too many, the Storyteller needs to
examine the expected attendance of his game. Making such a decision is rarely as
simple as setting a straight ratio of one abnormal character for every 20 normal ones;
it’s more of a sliding scale. For a game of 20 or fewer members, one special approval
might be plenty. When the size of the game gets to 50, add in a second. At 75 or 100,
maybe one more. In general, you need to keep the special characters to less than 10%
of the game’s population.
With larger games, that percentage should go down, not up, because you will
not have full attendance at every session in a large game. You will, however, get
almost full attendance from anyone who has spent the time and effort to play a rare
character type. This phenomenon will create the illusion that the ratio of rare
characters to regular ones is far greater than it really is, because those odd ducks will
tend to be the more active characters.

The largest crush on any new game is the initial work and time one must spend
on character approvals. To make this daunting task less troublesome, we recommend
that you take the following few small steps.


45
Nuts and Bolts
Nuts and Bolts
First, decide what the demographics for your game will be. Decide your game’s
theme and mood, then set the limits of roughly how many rare characters will be allowed
in at the start. Make sure that both the players and any other Storytellers who are helping
understand the limits and expectations, and that they are prepared to adhere to them.
Second, try to complete the majority of your approvals as soon as possible. The
longer the task lingers, the less likely you are to be satisfied with the results. For any
game of 20 or more characters, the main Storyteller will likely want help from
Narrators or assistants. Before everything gets busy, meet with any Storytellers you
have and spend some time going over the players’ backgrounds and character sheets.
Turn the meeting into a planning session for your first game, setting aside anywhere
from one night to one week to accomplish the initial planning.
Third, have a character creation party for your group’s first meeting rather than
an actual game. Invite as many of the players as you can, and invite them to discuss
their characters’ connections to each other and to the game setting’s history. For
instance, are you having a Storyteller character portray the city’s prince and
primogen when the game starts, or are the players’ characters going to fill those roles?
Will the players’ characters be encouraged to play a big role in the governance of the
city, or are they trying to bring down the powers that be? Whatever background
you’ve written for the setting, use this first gathering of the players as an opportunity
to meet with them and generate ideas. Players’ characters who enter your game with
connections already in place have far more invested into the game than those players
who make a character with no pre-existing connections.
Finally, allot your storytelling team approximately one week to go through all
of the character sheets and backgrounds before the game. The more time you give
yourself the better, but try to stick to the same schedule you will be using for games.
If you play every other week, then try to get it all ready within a two-week timeframe.
Don’t let yourself procrastinate on these initial preparations, because it may infringe
on everyone’s enjoyment of playing the game.
When reviewing the backgrounds and sheets, look for plot hooks that can be
used in various stages of the game. Look for items, such as an Enemy, that can be
expanded to affect a sizeable portion of the game. Flaws and other hooks that you can
showcase will help draw the spotlighted characters into the chronicle. Players will
realize that the characters they’ve created have an impact on the world around them.
It is important for players to feel that their characters have significance within the
game, especially if you want them to keep coming back.
Once the game is underway, you will undoubtedly be asked to approve
characters during game-play while you are trying to attend to other business. If you
are faced with a player in need of immediate approval and you don’t have the time
to examine the character sheet in depth, scan the character sheet for obvious abusive
powers and fuzzy math. If the basics look all right, approve the character for the game.
Then make sure to tell the player that although the character is approved for this
session, he will need to leave it with you at the end of the session so that you can
examine it in more detail before the next session. Typically, these steps are sufficient
for in-game approval, since they enable you to deal with more pressing game issues.

The World of Darkness is rarely a level playing field. Most of the Mind’s Eye
Theatre and tabletop source material makes it clear that no player’s character is ever at
the top of the pecking order. Each supernatural setting has someone at the top looking
down upon the players’ characters, as well as an entire range of positions in between. A

game of vampiric politics in which the Ventrue prince has the same basic statistics as his
downtrodden Caitiff antagonists doesn’t offer quite the same dynamic as one can find in
the tabletop version of Vampire: The Masquerade. To remedy that disparity, you can
simply start some of the characters off with more free Traits than others.
At the beginning of a chronicle, the Storyteller needs to decide if he will allow
anyone to enter play with a more powerful character for the sake of the story. If so,
the Storyteller must then decide how he is going to pick who gets to play those more
powerful characters. This decision is important because the players chosen for these
more potent characters must agree to not abuse the power given to them. The
Storytellers need to keep an eye on the powerful characters and keep those players
informed about how they are doing, as well as what the chronicle needs from them.
Establishing the personal communications between Storyteller and player in these
situations can be a tremendous boon to the game’s flavor.
Over time, the longer-running characters will accumulate power in ways that
make raw statistics irrelevant. As time goes on then, the characters will redistribute the
power according to the way they roleplay. This approach works best in games that focus
on Laws of the Wild or The Shining Host, since both of those settings have mutable
in-game hierarchies through which the players’ characters can rise. Being an Elder
Garou is much more impressive if the character began as a cub and earned the renown
for the higher rank through hard experience. In this system, the Storyteller usually has
to use Storyteller characters to fill in leadership roles that the players’ characters do not
meet, then phase those Storyteller characters out as the players’ characters increase in
power. Vampire games rarely manage to benefit from this approach simply because one
of its main indicators of power — Generation — is not something that a character
generally earns through play. The problem here is that it does take time for this
approach to pay off. It can sometimes be a year or more of play before the players’
characters are truly ready to take over the full spectrum of a chronicle’s key characters.
If and when you make the decision to make some starting characters in your
chronicle more equal than others, your sense of fair play (or the players themselves) will
demand that you not make the concomitant decision arbitrarily. The following three
methods will help you choose which characters to boost or reward as the chronicle begins.
LOTTERY
OTTERY
OTTERY
OTTERY
OTTERY
If you throw a character creation party before your chronicle’s first session, you
might offer your players the chance to participate in a lottery-style drawing. Prepare
a deck of index cards before the party by writing a small bonus award on each and
shuffling the deck. These awards can range from an extra three to five free Traits to an
extra level of one Influence to one free Basic level of an out-of-category supernatural
power of that character’s creature type. Hold this drawing only once, and use it as an
incentive to attend the pre-chronicle character creation party. This method is the
most arbitrary and random of the three, but it remains fair for everyone involved.
AUDITIONS
UDITIONS

In chronicles in which the size and scope are still limited to approximately a dozen
close cities and well under a thousand members, you might hold auditions for key parts
and more powerful characters. Through the audition system, a Storyteller or a team of
Storytellers interviews the players for the privilege of playing rare or more powerful
characters. The dangers of this system are obvious — favoritism and workload.
Favoritism is a frequent problem, no matter what system you use, but it is a particularly
serious drawback to the audition method. To minimize this potential abuse of power,
it is recommended that auditions not rely on a single Storyteller but on a team.


47
Nuts and Bolts

The workload required to hold auditions also presents a real dilemma as the
chronicle’s number of participants increases. Once a chronicle’s size nears a thousand
players, it becomes extremely difficult to track the rising stars of a chronicle accurately.

This system can work for any size game, but the overhead devoted to supporting the
system becomes harder to manage as the game grows. This system allows its Storytellers
(past and present) to come into play with more powerful characters once they become
regular players themselves. The system might also benefit people who take on other
activities that the group wants to emphasize. Storytellers can award extra Experience
Traits for record-keeping work or for tracking the group’s funds and site fees.
The principal danger in this reward method becomes apparent when those players
who are doing the work are doing it simply to get a more powerful character rather than
looking after the health of the chronicle. Such players will make themselves readily
apparent, however, so spotting them shouldn’t be particularly difficult.

As the chronicle matures, characters will die off and be replaced by new ones.
When the chronicle isn’t expected to last any longer than a year, or if it’s confined to
a single group, this fact of life might not present an issue. In larger chronicles, however,
it can become a real hurdle. When a new player looks at the chronicle from the outside,
the chronicle can appear to be a daunting and dangerous setting in which he will be
overwhelmed by existing characters and plots. The successful chronicle will develop
ways to bring those new players into the fold and help them cope with the opportunities
presented in such a grand endeavor. Some suggestions follow on doing just that.
MENTORING
ENTORING
ENTORING
ENTORING
ENTORING
Every chronicle has its experts and experienced members. It is a good idea to
identify those players who enjoy helping out the new players and who are willing to
spend some extra time with someone who is still unfamiliar with the game and
system. Building an established network of mentors and then systematically linking
new members to them will have lasting positive effects on the chronicle.
Mentors can help with all aspects of integration. They offer newcomers a
method to learn about the ways in which the organization operates, and they keep
newcomers from feeling overwhelmed by the systems that keep such a large game
running smoothly. During the game itself, mentors help newcomers find an in-game
niche and establish the in-game contacts that will allow them to excel. In both
arenas, a well-done mentoring system can have a dramatically beneficial effect.
In Laws of the Night chronicles, for instance, a large number of subordinate
characters (such as ghouls and mortal retainers) typically make up the entourage of the
dead. In Laws of the Wild games, kinfolk and cubs are a great place to start out, because
they tend to be sheltered by the older characters by their very nature. Any character who
is attached to another in a way that removes the need to take a lot of independent action
— but which still allows the player to be around the action — is a good place to start.

A variant on the mentoring approach is to assign a set of Storytellers to each
deal with and track smaller portions of the ongoing chronicle. The Setting Storytell-
ers are responsible for maintaining a top-down view of their portion of the game and
helping any new members who interested in that part fit in. Therefore, as a new
character enters the game, he can check in with a Setting Storyteller and look for
key links that establish the character in the setting’s history.

These Storytellers then become “librarians” for the chronicle, storing informa-
tion about the current makeup of the chronicle and dispensing it to those who need
it. This information can be a valuable asset and tool for any new player who is trying
to understand the world he has just stepped into.

Flaws and Negative Traits come up often during character creation and
integration. They provide great hooks to pull the characters into the larger story and
game. Likewise, backgrounds can be a way for players to provide wonderful plot
points that everyone can share. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these hooks will
be ignored unless the Storyteller actively uses them against the players’ characters.
Therefore, your game may find it very useful to pick one Storyteller to be the
Consequences Storyteller.
This person reads through the players’ character sheets and brings to life the plots
and problems that the players have already written for their characters. Obviously, no
one can do so effectively for every character in a very large game, but it can be very
effective to pick perhaps five characters a month and make a point of focusing on those
characters throughout that month. If the Consequences Storyteller times his activities
correctly, these characters will be ones who are not otherwise engaged in the game
through more conventional plots and activities, and this can serve as a way to keep
characters involved who would otherwise be watching the action from the sidelines.

allows you to build, arm and disarm explosive devices.

subject (or a valid reason to learn the Lore Ability), even if the information passed
includes secrets known only to those with high levels in the Ability. Lore is meant
to allow characters to know certain important pieces of information from the World
of Darkness sourcebooks, such as the history of the Silver Fangs or the natural
weaknesses of changelings.
One level of Lore represents a more-than-passing knowledge of the subject, and
it is the lowest level of understanding that requires Lore to back it up. The character
can cite basic, widely known concepts within the lore’s area, such as the Escheat (for
Changeling Lore) or the Litany (for Garou Lore).
A second level of Lore represents a higher-than-basic understanding of the subject
in question. At this level, the character has heard of a few bloodlines, special societies
or other low-level secrets from within, but he has no expansive knowledge of them.
Having three levels of Lore represents a specialized study in the particular
subject. This level is generally more common to the leaders and powerful political
figures within the subject lore’s area. The character becomes more familiar with the
workings of many secret societies, and can probably name a few members. The
character understands higher-level politics better at this level, as well as some of the
truth behind the whispered secrets.
Those who attain four levels in a Lore are aware of the goals and the movements
of most of the secret factions within the lore’s area. Their knowledge of the subject’s
secrets lays bare the truths to which the elders and ancient texts only allude. Lore at
this level and higher represents many elements specific to your chronicle, so work
closely with your Storyteller to get the information.
Having five levels of Lore represents the pinnacle of understanding. You can
often expound upon ancient historical texts as though you’d been present at the time
in question. This level goes beyond the books and delves almost entirely into
chronicle-specific information.

You are able to center your thoughts, calm your emotions, control your mind and relax
your body. This Ability is useful for reaching the state of mind necessary for using Psychic
Phenomenon and regaining True Faith Traits. A Storyteller may allow a character to regain
Willpower or True Faith Traits by meditating out of play at a game session for an hour and
making a Simple Test for each level of Meditation Ability expended. A success or tie returns
a Willpower Trait (one maximum per session) or a Faith Trait.

and you may use this Ability to retest with thrown objects.

Within a given area of expertise, some practitioners further hone their knowl-
edge to a razor’s edge. By choosing a specialization in an Ability, you hone your skills
with a particular facet of that talent.
Ability specializations are wholly optional. Remember to ask your Storyteller
before taking a specialization.
Taking a specialization requires that you spend one Experience Trait or free Trait
on an Ability that you already have. Whenever you perform a task with that specializa-

How long should a level of the Lore Ability take to learn? Who should
have access to the higher levels? How should it be taught?
A character can attain a single level of a Lore in just a few months of diligent
study. Learning the second level is more substantial task that requires at least a
year of study and training. It is effectively the highest level that one can learn in
the course of a live-action chronicle unless the Storyteller does not follow a real-
time timeline, and he allows years to pass in the game world between sessions.
One attains the third level in a Lore through in-depth study for a decade or more.
The fourth level is available only to those who have made it a lifelong study, as
at least a lifetime is required to attain such a level of scholarly understanding. It
is effectively the highest level that non-immortal characters can achieve without
some means of greatly extending their life span. Attaining the fifth level in a Lore
is extremely difficult. Those who have achieved this level of expertise have spent
several lifetimes or more in pursuit of knowledge pertaining to the subject.
Therefore, the fifth level is only truly available to immortal or undead creatures.
For the Storyteller, laying down restrictions on the types of Lore available
to characters becomes more important the larger her game gets. She may wish
to restrict the number of characters that have access to high levels, or she may
restrict out-of-setting Lores. (For instance, a Storyteller in a Shining Host
chronicle might not allow her players to buy Wraith Lore.) Talk to your
Storyteller to see what levels and types of Lores she will let you start with.
After character creation, characters must be taught Lore in order to gain more
levels in it. Simple observation of the subject can hardly justify learning levels of
the Ability. Since it is difficult for one person to teach someone the entirety of her
knowledge on a subject (especially in an unbiased manner), a character must learn
Lore levels beyond the first from multiple teachers. The number of teachers
required is equal to the level of Lore being learned, and each teacher must have that
level of Lore to be able to teach it. For example, in a game where the Storyteller
advances the story line by 50 years or so between games, a character could learn
Brujah Lore to level four in “downtime” if he had four teachers that each had four
levels of that Lore. At your Storytellers discretion, Lore can be learned from tomes
and texts, but such a source should never count as being more than a single level,
regardless of how many ancient libraries the character sifts through.

tion — even if you do not expend the Ability — you gain a one-Trait bonus on resolution
of challenges, as long as you have at least one Trait of the Ability left. You may have only
one specialization in any given Ability. You cannot take Firearms: Pistols and Firearms:
Rifles together, for instance. You also can never gain more than one bonus Trait at a time
from specializations, even if more than one would be appropriate to a given challenge.
That is, even if you have Medicine: Physiology and Science: Biology Research, you get only
a one-Trait bonus on a test of biochemistry, despite your multiple specializations.
A specialization is a fairly narrow area of research or practice. You cannot, for instance,
take a Firearms specialization in “guns,” nor could you have an Occult specialization of
“writing.” An appropriate specialization refers to one small class of items or to one type of
practice within the Ability, such as Firearms: Antique Pistols or Occult: Superstitions.
You may take a specialization in an Ability with an area of study. In such a case,
you concentrate your research in one particular facet of that sub-Ability, or in one
application of it. Therefore, you could have Crafts: Woodworking with a specializa-
tion in Hidden Panels, or Science: Botany with a specialization in Exotic Flora.
Note that the bonus Trait from a specialization does not have an adjective,
and it is not bid or used like other Traits. You simply are one Trait up on
challenges within the specialization.
Example: Marcus von Schlagenhanz is an experienced fighter, but he is especially good
with fencing weapons. He has Melee x3 with a specialization in fencing. When Marcus engages
a foe in combat, he normally uses his 11 Physical Traits. With a fencing blade, however, he has
12 Physical Traits because of his intense training. Of course, if he gets tired out or wounded (after
losing several challenges), he may not have as many Traits, but as long as he has at least one level
of his Melee Ability left, he gets to add the one bonus Trait to his remaining Physical Trait total.

Your character’s Backgrounds help flesh out his ties with mundane human
agencies, as well as reflecting beneficial elements of your character’s history. Each
Background works differently. In general, having multiple Traits in a given Back-
ground allows for better or more common use of that benefit, but characters are
limited to having no more than five levels in any single Background. Some
Backgrounds affect your character’s creation and development directly. Others
come into play later during the game.
ALLIES

You have powerful or useful friends who help you out in your endeavors. You
can make a few calls and cut a few deals to get assistance in a wide range of activities.
Your Storyteller will probably require you to define how you keep your allies and
their relations to you.
Each Allies Trait possessed represents one person whom you can call upon for aid.
Unlike Influence, your Allies have special talents that make them better than the average
person on the street. Although your allies may not be aware of your supernatural nature
(if you have any), they can be quite useful if you direct them properly.
In general, your allies do not appear during game-play. Instead, you can use
them for certain services between play sessions, by notifying your Storyteller.
An ally can be directed to follow up on research or activities that you have
started. If you undertook a specific task previously (such as tailing someone,
researching a project or building a device), your allies can continue the work, doing
so with one Ability Trait’s worth of expertise. As long as they work on the project,
your Allies Trait for the individual is tied up.

Dark Epics

If you need a particularly competent ally, you can expend multiple Traits to gain
access to a mortal with multiple levels of an Ability or Influence. Each Allies Trait
that you spend after the first gives an extra level of expertise to your allies. They may
use this expertise on your behalf, though rarely with your own skill, and they help
only as long as you tie up your Allies Background Traits in this manner.
Be wary of calling on your allies too often. An ally may call on you for mutual
aid or refuse to help if you press him into dangerous or illegal activities.
CONTACTS
ONTACTS

With the right contacts in all walks of life, you can get a line on all sorts of useful
information. Although having an “ear to the wall” doesn’t necessarily provide you
with good help or loyal servants, it does mean that you know whom to ask when
looking for the movers and shakers behind the scenes.
In game terms, your rating in Contacts allows you to gather rumors and
information. When you call on your contacts, you make a few phone calls, check
with likely snitches and grease a few palms. In return, you get rumors and informa-
tion. Doing so lets you find out exactly what’s going on in the city within a particular
area. You can get information of a level equal to however many contacts you use. If
you use Contacts x3 on Industry Influence, for instance, you get information as if
digging up dirt with Industry Influence x3. The advantage of the Contacts Back-
ground is that contacts can be switched from place to place.
Contacts levels can also be spent as Influence to perform the Follow, Trace and
Watch endeavors.
Using Contacts for especially dangerous or secret information may require you to
spend money or perform a few favors, at the discretion of a Storyteller. On occasion,
accidents can cause contacts in one area to dry up, such as a strike that affects your
Industry contacts, or a particularly unlucky astronomical conjunction sends your
Occult contacts running for the hills. Your contacts will not generally function as aides
or lackeys. That sort of service is the purview of the Allies and Retainers Backgrounds.

Some characters come from the ranks of the wealthy or talented elite. Although such
notoriety often fades with the years, your Fame lingers on to influence mundane society.
Fame allows you to exercise your connections over a longer distance than usual.
Certainly, if you’ve got the right Influence, you can push things around on an
interstate or even a national scale, but with Fame, you can just make a few calls and
exert your Contacts, Influence or Resources over a greater range without any
impediment. You do not necessarily have to have Fame to get things done, but it
helps. Your total Fame determines your maximum range for unimpeded use of your
Contacts, Influence and Resources.

When you make an effort to exert your Contacts, Influence or Resources over a
long range, you lean on your popularity and image, which expends your Fame Traits
until the next game session. Fame is most often used in the downtime between
sessions to facilitate long-range plans.
In a less mechanical fashion, your Fame also dictates how recognizable you are
to members of mundane society, for one reason or another. The Storyteller will
certainly make the effects of your Fame apparent, and people may take notice of you
at bothersome times. Being profiled on America’s Most Wanted or spotted at the
Academy Awards does things for one’s reputation, after all.
Fame does have its limitations. Fame does not always indicate widespread
instant name recognition. You may be known to only a subset of a particular group,
or you might just be a recognized expert in a field who’s unknown to those outside.
MENTOR
ENTOR
ENTOR
ENTOR
ENTOR
An older or more experienced individual looks after you and comes to your aid
occasionally. Whatever the case is, you can get assistance from your mentor,
although his favor may be fickle.
When you call on your mentor, you risk a certain number of Traits to achieve a given
effect. A lowly one-Trait mentor probably knows only little more than you, while a five-Trait
mentor may well have luminous standing within your sect and a wide range of potent powers.
Regardless, taking up your mentor’s valuable time is costly. You must engage in a Simple Test
when you call on your mentor. If you succeed, your mentor deigns to aid you. If you tie, your
mentor grants you assistance, but he requires something in return. If you fail, your mentor
demands the favor first before helping. In any case, you can call on your mentor only once in
any given game session, and only if you have an appropriate way to contact him or her.
The level of aid that your mentor can give depends on the number of Traits you
have in this Background (and Storyteller approval, of course):
• For one Trait, your mentor is privy to a single piece of specialized information
at a level above your own. If you have Wraith Lore x2, for instance, your mentor can
be called on to gift you with one piece of information from Wraith Lore x3.
• For two Traits, you can borrow one level of Contacts, Influence, Resources or
Status from your mentor for the duration of the game. If your mentor is very powerful
(four or five Traits), you can borrow two levels.
• Having two Traits allows your mentor to instruct you in a Basic power that
you do not know.
• For three Traits, your mentor can instruct you in an Intermediate power that
you do not know.
• Also at a cost of three Traits, your mentor can train you in the ways of a special
Hobby/ Professional/ Expert Ability that is outside your normal ken, such as Mage Lore.
• For four Traits, your mentor can train you in an Advanced power beyond your grasp.
• For five Traits, your mentor can train you in the phenomenal powers of the
elders, if you are puissant enough to learn such secrets.
Since mentors can prove unbalancing by providing too many different powers
over the course of a long game, the Storyteller may lower your total Mentor Traits
as you call on his knowledge. This decrease represents the fact that as your character
learns the mentor’s secrets; the mentor has less left to teach.

resources are always readily available, and they come to you automatically due to
your investments, jobs and holdings.
Your number of Resources Traits determines the amount of money and capital
that you can secure. By expending temporary Resources Traits (which return at the
next game session), you can draw on your regular income, as shown in the
accompanying table. If you expend permanent Resources, you can divest yourself of
holdings, allowing access to 10 times the amount shown on the table. However, the
limits of what you can buy are always adjudicated by the Storyteller. Truly powerful
uses of Resources are best left to downtimes and moderation between game sessions.

ETAINERS
Whether out of personal loyalty, love, supernatural coercion or some other
means, you have managed to secure the fellowship of a person (or small group) who
obeys your every whim. Unlike your allies, your retainers are nearly always around,
overseeing your personal effects, defending your property and furthering your goals.
They may not have the specialized knowledge of allies, but they are mostly loyal to
your cause, and they serve your needs first.
You should work with your Storyteller to determine how you managed to secure
a loyal retainer. Your retainer’s exact capabilities are up to the Storyteller. A retainer
may be skillful but unmotivated, or loyal but inept. No retainer is ever perfect, but
he can be a great help nonetheless.
• A retainer can be assigned to watch over a particular location. Generally, if someone
attempts to break into your house, the retainers there will attempt to stop the intruder.
• A retainer can manage your assets and perform tasks. Retainers who are tied
up in this fashion allow you to manage more Influence than normal. They add to the
number of Attribute Traits that you possess for purposes of counting your total
Influences. Each retainer directed in this fashion adds one to your maximum
Influence Traits. If retainers are later lost, killed or reassigned, the excess Influence
Traits disappear, starting with the highest levels of Influence held you hold.
• A retainer can perform other menial functions, as allowed by the Storyteller.
If it becomes necessary to have a character sheet for a retainer, use the standard
mortal creation guidelines.

For the Storyteller, it is important to maintain the flavor of Influences when
using them in a game. Being descriptive when reporting the results of Influence
endeavors to the players is critical. Otherwise the interactions of Influences in a city
will degrade into a sub-game of number-crunching, in which no story is being told
at all. Much of the burden of this task falls upon the shoulders of the players
themselves. When a player wishes to perform an endeavor, the Storyteller should
have her give him a write-up of the activity, complete with a description of exactly
how her Influences are going about executing the desired task. Examples of
descriptive use of Influence are given with each new endeavor type.

You cannot manage more Influence than the sum of your permanent Physical,
Social and Mental Traits. This limit counts against all of your total Influence —
your combined levels cannot exceed this total. After all, there are only so many
things you can do in a day.
When you exercise Influence, you expend temporary Influence Traits. The tables for
various Influence areas detail what you can do with a specific number of Traits. Performing
an endeavor requires a number of Traits equal to the level of the action. Therefore, with
high levels of Influence, you can perform many small actions or a few significant ones. To
perform the new Influence endeavors presented here (such as Attack, Grow and Watch),
you must spend Traits just as you would for endeavors on the traditional charts.
Certain levels of Influence gift you with items, money or aides. Unlike the
Resources Background, money and equipment garnered with Influence does not come
automatically each month. If you want a steady income from Influence, you must direct
your Influence in that direction continually, and this income does not come with any
associated trappings of wealth. (You’d have to buy a house and car separately, for
instance.) Aides garnered with Influence generally help for only one specific task, and
they usually have the equivalent of only one level of Ability in their area of skill. For
more competent and readily available help, take the Allies Background.
Most cities have only a set amount of Influence in various areas. For instance,
Atlanta has a great deal of Transportation Influence, while Hollywood would have a lot
of High Society and Media Influence. A Rust-Belt city in which manufacturing and
heavy industry has all but disappeared would have very little to no Industry Influence.
Storytellers should map out the total amount of each type of Influence to be had in
the city setting. Once all of the Influence of a given type is used up, the only way to get more
is to use existing Influence to grow that area of society (making new projects or sponsoring
investment) or to destroy someone else’s Influence and free up those resources. Also, each
city may have different reflections of the Influences listed here. A city with a thriving
independent film community is going to have a different picture of Media or High Society
Influence than a city in which the arts are being literally starved out due to budget cuts.
Bureaucracy
You can manage various government agencies and bureaus. By dealing with social
programs and public servants, you can spin red tape, bypass rules and regulations or twist
bureaucratic regimentation to your advantage. Bureaucracy is useful in operating or
shutting down businesses, faking or acquiring permits and identification papers and
manipulating public utilities and facilities. Government clerks at the city and county level,
utility workers, road crews, surveyors and other civil servants are potential contacts or allies.

Although the modern church has arguably less control over temporal society

the direction of politics and communities. Knowing the appropriate people gives a
character insight into many mainstream religions, such as Christianity, Judaism,
Islam, Hinduism, Shinto or Buddhism. (Fringe or alternative groups, such as
Scientology, are the purview of the Occult Influence.) When you exercise Church
Influence, you can change religious policy, affect the assignment of clergy and access
a variety of lore and resources. Contacts and allies affected by Church Influence
would include ministers, priests, bishops, Church-sponsored witch-hunters, holy
orders and various attendees and assistants.

Police
“To protect and serve” is the motto of the police, but these days, many people
have cause to wonder who is being protected and served. That said, Police Influence
can be very handy in protecting one’s holdings or raiding the assets of another. Police
of all ranks, detectives, clerical staff, dispatchers, prison guards, special divisions
(such as SWAT or homicide) and local highway patrol officers make up these ranks.

In addition to the actions listed on the Influence charts in the various Mind’s
Eye Theatre source books, characters may perform the additional endeavors listed
here. It is important to note that Influence can generally only affect other Influences
of the same type. A character can use his Street Influence to aggress another player’s
Street Influence, but he would have a hard time getting it to interact with a player’s
High Society Influence successfully.
Attack
You can Attack another’s Influence with your own, provided you have
previously Traced the target Influence. To Attack, you assign a number of Influence
Traits, and that number becomes the level of the Attack endeavor. If the level


65
Nuts and Bolts
Nuts and Bolts
exceeds the victim’s Influence level, the victim drops a level of her Influence at the
end of the month. Traits banked for Growth are lost as well, even if they would have
given the victim a new, higher level Influence at the beginning of the next month.
Mechanics Example: Scott and Wade both have Media Influence, at levels five
and two respectively. Scott Traced Wade’s Influence successfully last month, and he
desires to make an Attack upon it this month. He spends four Traits on the endeavor,
meaning that the Attack’s level is four. Since the level of Scott’s Attack is greater than
the level of Wade’s Media Influence, Wade will only have a level-one Media to work
with next month. If Wade had been spending Traits for Growth, and had accumulated
three or more, he would immediately apply three of them to bring it back to level two.
Descriptive Example: When Scott made his character, he decided that his Media Influence
would be represented by his control over various media moguls through Blood Bonding and the use
of Dominate. To Attack Wade’s Influence, Scott performed the necessary prerequisite of
succeeding in a Trace on it. Having done so, Scott discovered that Wade’s Media Influence was
represented by his control over one of the city’s major newspapers. When writing an explanation
of the Attack endeavor for the Storyteller, Scott describes influencing his media mogul thralls to have
their networks broadcast a television news story about Wade’s newspaper. The television news story
highlights the paper’s “long history of poorly researched news articles” and describes a number of
incidents in which the paper was forced to print retractions. The television news story goes on to rate
the various other papers in the city, giving them a far more favorable rating than Wade’s paper.
When the Storyteller looks at the Influence numbers and decides that Scott’s Attack is successful,
he informs both Scott and Wade of the resulting decline in the paper’s circulation, which represents
Wade’s Media Influence dropping to level one at the beginning of the next month.
Block
You can use your Influence to prevent Influence endeavors from taking place for
that month. Any action from the other sourcebooks may be blocked, provided that
your Influence level is at least equal to the endeavor’s level on the chart. The Block’s
effective level is the total number actions spent toward it. A Block will affect all
attempts at the selected endeavor during that month; anyone attempting the Blocked
action in the city will not succeed unless they have added enough levels of Boost to the
endeavor. Multiple Blocks against the same endeavor type are not cumulative in effect.
If more than one Block is put in place on the same endeavor, use only the highest level
when calculating the success of those attempting the endeavor.
Mechanics Example: Jana has four levels of Legal Influence. Because she is
capable of arranging a parole, she is therefore able to put a Block on that endeavor
type as well. She decides to spend two of her Legal Influence Traits to create a level
two Block. Anyone wishing to arrange a parole in the city that month must spend
two or more additional Influence Traits into Boost in order to be successful.
Descriptive Example: When Jana made her character, she decided that an extensive
network of judges, lawyers and corrections facility officials who are accepting bribes from
her would represent her Legal Influence. Now that one of Jana’s character’s enemies has
just been arrested, she doesn’t want anyone to arrange for his parole. When writing an
explanation of the Block endeavor for the Storyteller, Jana describes bribing members of the
parole board to stop proceedings, or at least delay them until the end of the month.
Boost
Boost is simply a term used to describe spending additional unneeded Influence
Traits to perform an endeavor, just in case someone has put up a Block that needs
to be overcome. If the Traits spent into Boost equal the level of the Block, the action
is successful. The Block does not go away if one action beats it, though. It can still
be effective against any additional attempts at that endeavor in that month.

Dark Epics
Dark Epics
Mechanics Example: Mathew has used a Trait of his Health Influence put a
level one Block on getting mortal blood. Sue attempts to acquire a Blood Trait using
a Trait of her level-four Health Influence. When the Storyteller informs her that she
is not successful because of a Block, Sue tries it again, this time adding her last two
Traits into Boost, thereby raising the cost of her second attempt to three Health
Influence Traits. Since the level of the Boost is at least equal to the level of the Block,
Sue is successful, and she acquires the Blood Trait.
Descriptive Example: When Sue made her character, she decided that ownership of
a small, private clinic would represent her Health Influence. She uses her clout to have a
small amount of blood delivered to her while she is off-site. She finds out that there is a major
shortage of blood in the city and that her request for whole blood isn’t prioritized highly
enough to acquire it (thanks to Mathew’s Block). Sue’s second attempt is backed by an
urgent request from two of her clinic’s doctors, who falsely claim to need the whole blood
for an emergency surgery. This time, the request is granted.
Combine
Combine allows you to aid the Influence endeavor of another character. No action
on the Mind’s Eye Theatre sourcebook charts can be attempted by a character who doesn’t
have the required Influence level according to that chart. For every two Traits that you
spend on Combine, the character you are helping gains one action to use toward his
endeavor. Influence borrowed through the Allies and Mentor Backgrounds are also subject
to this rule. A character can spend no more than 20 Traits toward a single endeavor in any
given month, including all actions spent for modifications such as Combine.
Mechanics Example: Corey has four levels of Political Influence. He wants to enact
some minor legislation in the city, which would cost him all four of his Political Influence
Traits for the month. Corey has already used a Political Influence Trait this month, so he
doesn’t have enough. He asks a friend to Combine her Political Influence with his. Cynthia
has only two levels, but she loans them both to Corey. Since the number of Traits loaned
is effectively halved when using Combine, Corey nets only one extra Political Influence
Trait for the month, but that’s all he needs to enact the minor legislation.
Descriptive Example: When Corey made his character, he decided that blood bonding the
city’s mayor would represent his Political Influence. Since he’d already had the mayor ask the city
council for a small favor this month, he knows that getting him to push for the minor legislation would
be straining the mayor’s authority. Corey asks his ally Cynthia to help him with the endeavor, using
Combine. Cynthia manipulates a member of the city council through regular uses of Dominate,
and she has this council member propose the minor legislation. With the issue on the table, the mayor
can throw his full support into it without burdening his relationship with the council.
Conceal
Conceal can be used to hide your Influence from uses of Trace. The number of
actions spent toward Conceal generates that month’s Conceal level, which you pit
against attempts to Trace it.
Mechanics Example: Jess has heard a rumor that Tim is going to Trace his
University Influence. He spends all four of his University Traits to generate a level-
four Conceal over them. For three months in a row, he continues to spend his four
Traits on Conceal. On the fourth month, Jess hopes that Tim has lost interest in his
University Influence, and goes back to using it for Growth.
Descriptive Example: When Jess created his character, he decided that his University
Influence would be represented by the sway he has gained by providing major contributions to
the local universities in the past few years. Now that he fears that Tim will be able to follow the
paper trail of his donations (Tim’s Trace), Jess quickly uses his clout to convince the universities
that the records of his donations and other dealings should be suppressed for the time being.

Nuts and Bolts
Nuts and Bolts
Defend
You use the Defend endeavor when you fear that someone is going to Attack
your Influence. To employ this special endeavor, assign a number of Traits as the
level of the defense. The level of any Attacks directed at that Influence must exceed
the Defend level plus the level of your Influence in order to be successful.
Mechanics Example: Eric fears that someone is going to attack his Underworld
Influence this month, so he puts up a defense to protect it. He assigns three of his four
Underworld Traits to the defense. An incoming Attack must now be level eight or
higher to affect his Influence.
Descriptive Example: When Eric made his character, he decided that his Under-
world Influence would be represented by his control of the Lasciano Family, a major
organized crime syndicate. Fearing an Attack, Eric writes a description of his Defend
endeavor, detailing how he is having all of the family members lay low for a while, out of
the sight of other crime families and the authorities.
Follow
If you want to keep an eye on what someone is doing with his Influence, you can
attempt to Follow them with your own. Follow is similar to Watch, except that it only keeps
a lookout for actions performed by a single Influence. To Follow someone’s Influence, you
must have a successful Trace on it already. To use Follow, assign a number of Traits to
establish the level of the endeavor. The Follow endeavor will reveal all activities performed
by the targeted Influence, less any activities hidden with an equal or higher level of Stealth.
Mechanics Example: Jean successfully used her level-three Occult Influence to
perform a Trace on Toby’s Occult Influence several months ago. This month, Jean
is curious as to what Toby is up to, so she spends all three Traits of Occult Influence
to Follow Toby’s Occult activities. She finds out that Toby attempted to acquire a
minor magical item. If Toby had put three or more levels of Stealth on that endeavor,
Jean would not have been able to detect it.
Descriptive Example: When creating her character, Jean decided that her level-three
Occult Influence would be represented by her hold over a couple of millennium cults dedicated
to the research of mystical writings and prophecies. With the successful Trace, Jean discovered
that Toby’s Occult Influence is represented by his sway over an organized group of “psychics”
whose clientele are powerful and wealthy VIPs in the city. When Jean writes down her Influence
activities for the Storyteller, she describes how she will have the leaders of her cults direct their
followers to research groups of “psychics” in the city, specifically the group that Toby controls.
Growth
To raise one of your Influences to the next level, you must spend a number of
Traits equal to three times your current level. In general, you can gain a new level in
an Influence once every three months, provided you are using your Influence for
nothing else. Unlike other endeavors, Traits spent for Growth can be banked from
month to month. When you bank Traits thus, they accumulate until you reach the
number required for an increase. If you meet the number of Traits required to increase
to the next level, the Influence level improves by one at the end of the month.
Mechanics Example: Cheyana has three levels of Street Influence, meaning she
would need nine Traits spent to get to level four. In one month, she spends two of
her three Traits on Growth (two banked). In the next month, she spends two more
Traits on Growth (four banked). In the month following that, she spends all three
Traits on Growth (seven banked). In the fourth month, Cheyana spends two more
Traits on Growth, meeting the requirement to achieve level four. At the end of the
month, her Street Influence improves by one. Cheyana could have grown her Street
Influence a little faster if she had spent all of her actions on Growth each month.


68
Dark Epics
Dark Epics
Descriptive Example: Cheyana decided when she made her character that a network of
informants consisting of gang members, homeless people and prostitutes would represent her Street
Influence. When writing a description of her Growth activities for the Storyteller, Cheyana describes
encouraging her contacts in several gangs to push for mergers with other gangs across the city. The
next month, she describes organizing the homeless people into small “communities” for safer living,
which draws more homeless people into the area to spy for her. The month following, Cheyana
describes convincing the prostitutes that sometimes report to her to recruit more prostitutes to her
cause. In the fourth month, she describes working with the gangs again to direct their spare time
toward more high-profit activities such as the buying and selling of guns and other contraband. Now
that Cheyana has strengthened her contacts enough to warrant an increase in her Influence, the
Storyteller agrees to raise her Street to level four at the end of the month.
Stealth
Stealth is added to endeavors to counter the use of Follow and Watch. If the
number of Traits spent to add Stealth to an endeavor equals or exceeds the level of the
Follow or Watch, the endeavor is remains undetected. Stealth can be applied to any
of the actions on the charts, as well as to Attack, Block, Follow, Growth or Watch.
Mechanics Example: Donny wishes to use his Finance Influence to raise the capital
to purchase a small business. Doing so would normally only require two of his five Finance
Influence Traits, but because Donny doesn’t want anyone else to know what he’s up to,
he throws in the other three Traits for Stealth. If someone had instituted a Watch of level
three or less to notice that activity in the city, she would not detect Donny’s sneaky
acquisition of the capital. If the observer had put up a Watch of level four or higher,
Donny’s stealth would not have hidden him from her prying eyes.
Descriptive Example: When Donny made his character, he decided to have his
Finance Influence be represented by his controlling interest in a large acquisitions company.
When writing out his Influence activities for the Storyteller, Donny describes the added
Stealth as using a large network of dummy corporations through which to move the money
so that it could not be tracked back to him through his acquisitions company.
Trace
You can use this endeavor to establish the identity of a character whose Influence
you have come into contact with. You cannot simply guess that a character has an
Influence in a particular category and then attempt to Trace it. You must first have come
into contact with it in one of the several ways. This can be accomplished by suffering an
Attack from the target’s Influence, by noticing one of the target’s endeavors with the use
of Watch, by stopping one of the target’s endeavors with a Block, or by having one your
own endeavors stopped by the target’s use of Block. Additionally, if someone ever loans
you Influence Traits with Combine, you can Trace them. Finally, if the target ever tells
you in great detail about his Influence (i.e., agrees to let you Trace it), you can perform
the Trace. The total actions spent on the Trace define its level. If the level of this Trace
exceeds the highest level of Conceal or Stealth put up to guard the Influence that month,
the Trace is successful. Success tells you the Influence owner’s identity, and whether their
Influence level is higher than your own or not. It also gives you a general description of
the Influence and the ability to spend Traits to Attack it.
Using Trace is specific to one city. Therefore, if a character has Influence of the same
type in more than one city, your Trace only tells you about the Influence in the city you
are searching. If you have succeeded in a Trace on an Influence, you may not simply relay
that information to someone else for his or her Influence to make an Attack on. The
information is too complex for them to relay to their own Influence contacts without them
actually performing a Trace themselves. If you have performed a successful Trace, you can
relay enough information for someone else to perform a Trace with his or her own Influence.

Nuts and Bolts
Nuts and Bolts
Mechanics Example: Pauline has a level-four Police Influence. Recently her
attempt to access confiscated weapons was stopped by Carl’s level-two Block.
Having established contact, Pauline decides to Trace the influence. The next
month, she spends all four Traits to Trace. Carl, who has level-five Police
Influence, is spending two Traits to Block again this month, and because he fears
others will Trace him, he puts his remaining three Traits into Conceal. As the
level of Pauline’s Trace more than equals the level of Carl’s Conceal, Pauline
discovers that the Influence that blocked her endeavor last month belongs to Carl.
She discovers its general description (defined by Carl when he created his
character) and that its level is higher than hers.
Descriptive Example: When Pauline made her character, she decided that her bribery
and blackmail of the members of the local precinct would represent her Police Influence. To make
a Trace, Pauline writes up her Influences activities for the Storyteller as simply having every one
of her contacts poke around until they discover who tightened the security on the confiscated
weapons lock-up. After all, the police are supposed to be practiced investigators, right?
Watch
You use Watch when you want to notice a certain Influence action in a city from
the chart listed in the sourcebooks. Your Influence must be of sufficient level to
perform that action before you can Watch it. A Watch will let you know when and
how often the action is attempted in the city for that month, and you will even
discover uses of the action that occurred earlier in the same month before the Watch
was instituted. The total number of Traits spent on the Watch define its level. You
can also use Watch to look for the following endeavors: Attack, Block, Follow (only
those targeted at you), Growth and Watch.
Mechanics Example: Mark decides to spend one of his five Church Influence
Traits into a Watch this month. He decides to Watch for individuals attempting to
contact church-associated hunter groups. Because Mark is paranoid, he decides to
put up a level-two Watch on the Watch activity to see if anyone else is doing the
same thing. Mark’s Watch for individuals attempting to contact church-associated
hunter groups doesn’t get him anything. His second Watch (the one on the Watch
endeavor) notices his own Watch of course, and discovers that someone has put up
a Watch to notice anyone attempting to peruse general church records.
Descriptive Example: Mark decided when he created his character to have his
Church Influence be represented by an extensive network of blackmail against highly placed
members of the local churches. When writing up his activities for the Storyteller, Mark
describes how his blackmailed network of priests, deacons and elders are going on “crusades”
within their various churches to discover any corrupting Influences that might be at work.
They are using their authority to persuade other impressionable church members to report
any suspicious activities or requests to them immediately.

For the purpose of these rules, Influence Traits spent on endeavors return at the
beginning of the month after they are spent. The Storyteller may desire to extend
this time for large games that run less often than once a month. Either way, this
period of time should remain constant, giving all of the players the same opportunity
to employ their Influences on a regular basis.
Attack, Follow, Growth, Trace and Watch endeavors should only be resolved at
the end of the month. This limit gives everyone a chance to put up levels of Conceal,
Defense and Watch, and it lets the Storyteller take everyone’s Influence actions into
account so that he can produce better descriptive results of each person’s endeavors.

As stated previously, an Influence can only affect Influence from the same
category. In very rare circumstances, the Storyteller may allow Influences from one
category to assist endeavors in another, but only in the same city. In this case, each
action is spent as though it was only half of an action. In this way, it is even possible
for you to simulate the effects of Combine by loaning Influence to yourself from
another category. This type of cross-category Influence use should be rare, and it
should be regulated strictly lest it become a common thing. You may have Influences
in multiple cities (subject to local Storyteller approval), which are considered to be
entirely separate Influences even if they are of the same category.

Some endeavors on the Influence charts state that they can affect an area larger
than a city, but this can be difficult to run for large-scale games. In a network game,
you will need to clear an Influence action or endeavor that is intended to affect
another city with the Storyteller from the member chronicle who presides over the
city you are trying to affect.
If you wish to attempt an endeavor in a city other than the one in which your Influence
is located, you may attempt to do so, but each action is effectively halved. If you wish to affect
a city on another continent, then each Trait you spend functions as one quarter of a Trait.

A character may retest a single challenge only once from each of the following

Ability Trait to retest (as could his opponent), but he could not use a second Ability
for another retest. If he fails the challenge even after his Ability retest, he may still
call for another retest from another category, such as Willpower.
When a character calls for a retest to a challenge, his opponent can employ an
appropriate retest to negate it. The retest used to negate must be from the same
category. A retest called for with a Willpower Trait may not be negated in this manner.

Extended Challenges are often too cumbersome for quick play in large games.
When engaging in an Extended Challenge, the player may optionally perform the
first test as normal, gaining one “success” if he wins the test. If he gets that first
“success,” he can opt to spend up to four additional Attribute Traits from the
appropriate category to gain extra “successes.” For example, a wraith attempts to use
Mindspeak (Basic Mnemosynis). After winning the Mental Challenge, the wraith
may spend up to four Mental Traits for extra successes. With this system, or the
original system, no power that relies upon Extended Challenges to inflict varying
degrees of damage should be allowed to inflict more than three levels of damage per
application, regardless of the number of “successes.”

Melee, etc.), he may add one to the number of Bonus Traits given by the weapon he
is using. Characters using a weapon and a shield are required to have only one level
of Melee to make use of the shield’s additional Trait(s).
During the challenge, only one weapon is considered to have a damaging effect, while
the other simply aids with parrying or spraying. Therefore, a character with Incendiary
ammunition in one pistol and Armor-piercing rounds in the other may not take advantage
of both types of ammunition in the same attack (although rounds from both guns would
be expended). For another example, a character with Baal’s Caress on his sword, and a Ward
versus Kindred on his dagger could not apply both effects to the same attack.

In darkness, characters suffer a two-Trait Penalty on all combat challenges. In
the case of absolute darkness (or blindness) they must also retest any successful
challenges that they make (once per challenge), unless their opponent is suffering
the same penalty for darkness. Certain powers can affect the Trait penalty, while
others can allow the character to disregard darkness penalties altogether.

A character in a Mind’s Eye Theatre game has different health levels that represent
the amount of injury the character can endure. These levels include: Healthy, Healthy,
Bruised, Bruised, Bruised, Wounded, Wounded, Incapacitated, Torpor and/or Final
Death. If a Healthy character loses two health levels from a combat challenge, she
becomes Bruised. If she loses three more health levels, she becomes Wounded, and so on.
• Healthy — When a character is Healthy, he is virtually or completely
uninjured. He suffers no penalty aside from possibly being cosmetically scuffed up a bit.
• Bruised — A Bruised character is more seriously roughed up, and his injuries have
started to impair his viability a bit. He is considered one Trait down on all tied challenges.
• Wounded — When a character is Wounded, he is seriously injured in one
or more locations. To reflect this injury, he must risk an additional Trait to attempt
a challenge, and his opponent wins all ties, regardless of who has more Traits. If
the injured character has a power which normally allows him to win all ties, ties
are resolved through comparing Traits instead. Note: A character may always
attempt to overbid.

• Incapacitated — When a character is Incapacitated, he is completely out of
play for at least 10 minutes. Once awake, the character is still effectively immobile,
although he may whisper pained sentences. He may not enter into challenges until
he has healed at least one health level. He is at the mercy of other characters, and
he may do nothing more than heal himself.
• Mortally Wounded — Bleeding profusely and suffering from shock, a Mortally
Wounded individual has little time left. Mortally Wounded characters do not regain
consciousness normally. Instead, the character loses one Physical Trait every 20 minutes.
Once the character runs out of Physical Traits, he dies. Only the assistance of someone
with the Medicine Ability can halt this inexorable loss, and the character will not even
begin to heal unless he is treated by magic or full hospital resources. Vampires who are
injured beyond Incapacitated fall into a deathlike sleep known as torpor.
• Death — To kill a character in combat requires that the character first be brought
to the Mortally Wounded or Torpor health level. His attacker must then declare that he
is performing a “killing blow” and defeat him in a Physical Challenge. Vampires can be
killed thus only if the blow involves aggravated damage or decapitation.
If a character is at the Mortally Wounded/ Torpor health level and is left in a
position that would logically lead to his demise, such as in a flaming building or a
trash compactor, the Narrator will declare the character to be dead after the
appropriate amount of time.
Narrators should never allow an “instant kill” without the consent of the target
(i.e., he agrees to die for story purposes). An instant kill is any single challenge or
effect that takes a character from his first Healthy health level to Mortally Wounded
or Torpor. The Mind’s Eye Theatre rules are designed to be theatrical, not strictly
realistic, so emphasize story over combat.

When a power is used unsuccessfully upon a character, that character can
initiate a Static Mental Challenge to detect its use. (The difficulty equals the Mental
Traits of the character using the power.) The Awareness Ability may be used as a
retest in this challenge. If the original character wins the Static Challenge, he might
also recognize the power and/ or who used it on him (at Narrator discretion). Some
powers are obvious in their effect, target, and/ or source. The Narrator may rule that
any of the pertinent information is available without testing.

Any Narrator who has worked with a large group of players has probably noticed
the tendency for mob combats to develop into huge, time consuming affairs that can
turn a fun game into a boring session of rock-paper-scissors. This outcome can be
avoided, but the Narrator should be the one who controls the situation and keeps
the scene on track. Players will usually diverge into out-of-character conversations
and mill about waiting to find out what happens for as long as the Narrator allows.
Keeping Things Moving
The faster the characters move with speed-enhancing powers, the slower the
players move in reality. One of the most important goals to strive for when running
a mass combat is to keep things moving so that players can get through with the scene
while still maintaining their focus on the game. When combats drag out, the spirit
of the scene can easily be lost in a sea of hand signals.
With that goal in mind, the Narrator must take two more things into consider-
ation before employing any of the following techniques. The first thing to consider
is whether the results of this scene are likely to cause such harm to one of the


73
Nuts and Bolts
Nuts and Bolts
characters that you ought to follow each and every rule just to be fair. The second
question is whether the players involved are going to enjoy a quick, narrative scene,
or if they’d prefer a drawn-out, by-the-book scene. If you’re not sure, it’s okay to ask
the players directly. A good rule of thumb is that if any real out-of-character tension
arises between the players over the scene, you should likely just stick to a by-the-book
style and leave the more diplomatic negotiation-oriented styles for later.
Playing It Conservatively
If you have determined that the players really want a more structured approach
to the mob scene, this can be effectively accomplished if you stay focused throughout
the scene. The Storyteller needs to keep things moving at a reasonable pace
throughout the scene and not lose the players’ attention. It’s very easy in these
situations to let the focus drift away from the scene at hand or to become bogged
down in the minutiae of details that pertain to only a single challenge or retest.
When playing the scene using the straight-and-narrow approach, taking some basic
steps will help keep things moving in the proper direction.
Time spent arguing about the rules is time lost. Through the course of any long
mob combat, the Storyteller will have to make several rules calls. Don’t worry about
pleasing everyone, but focus instead on making the fairest call possible, given the
information you have. If a player wants to object after you make a call, let him. A single
objection is sometimes quite helpful, because the players may notice things that you
missed. However, if you still feel after hearing the objection that you made right call,
simply stick to the original call and move on. If the players still want to argue, tell them
to abide by the decision for the time being and to bring it up after the game for further
debate if they would like. This approach allows the players to voice their concerns, but
it also lets them know that no one is going to receive preferential treatment.
If the scene is in a public or high-traffic area, passersby will to want to get
involved. You can handle this eventuality in a number of ways, but it has to be
addressed, because the inclusion of new participants on any side of a fight can alter
the outcome dramatically. At the very beginning of the scene, establish who is in the
scene, then limit any outside inclusion strictly. You can either move the whole group
to a secluded area outside the general area, or simply record who is involved at the
beginning with a snapshot of the scene or a written list of participants. However you
record it, the scene should be considered closed until the mob combat is over.
Once the scene begins, it is recommended that you keep tight control on the
flow of the combat. Everyone should progress through the turns and Celerity/ Rage
actions at the same pace, with no one moving farther ahead of the group in time or
lagging behind. At the beginning of each turn, simply call for everyone’s stated
actions, then break the situation down into its smallest component parts. Work on
each of these components until everything is resolved, then start over for the next
turn. As long as you keep things moving at a steady pace and you strive to incorporate
everyone’s goals, the scene should play out without much difficulty.
The Narrative Approach
If the players are amenable to a more cooperative approach, then it might be
easier to take a more freeform style to completing the scene. In this style, the players
agree that the exact rules are not as important as the final outcome, and they agree
to some give and take. Obviously, this approach doesn’t work as well if everyone’s
goals are to kill their enemies mercilessly, but sometimes it can be very rewarding.
First off, the Narrator is responsible for making sure that things move forward
at a reasonable pace and that everyone is focused on completing the scene as
smoothly as possible. The Narrator needs to remember that even in using this style,


74
Dark Epics
Dark Epics
he is the final authority on how things proceed, and he should keep a close eye on
the negotiations to make sure that everyone is treated fairly.
For this scene to proceed, everyone participating needs to divulge what they
want out of the scene. Frequently, the answers to this simple question can provide
hints to the solution. If multiple or conflicting goals come up, it can be a good second
step to go back through the group after the first question and ask about each player’s
limits. In other words, the Narrator establishes each player’s best and worst
conclusion to the scenario and then sets about trying to negotiate a way to satisfy as
many players as possible without letting anyone’s worst-case scenario come up.
If any diametrically opposed goals arise, then it is suggested that the Narrator find a
way to meet (as much as possible) both goals without denying either outright. For instance,
a neonate has gravely insulted his elder, and the elder is attempting to kill the young upstart.
The neonate’s goal might be to simply get away, while the elder’s goal might be to kill the
neonate. The Narrator can easily suggest that the elder mitigate his goal down to putting
the neonate into torpor and sending him to his clan’s elders. The neonate may accede to
capture if it doesn’t result in his death. Therefore, both parties could have what they want,
while the path to get there may be different than either expected.
If the Narrator fails to reach an equitable solution between the groups, it is
recommended that the entire party default back to the conservative approach of
playing out every challenge as best as possible. The desired end of the narrative
approach is to keep the story moving as long as possible and to give each party just
enough closure to move on from this chapter without unnecessary problems. The
goal of the conservative approach, on the other hand, is to play out a single gambit
in the larger story to the bitter end. Neither approach is intrinsically any better than
the other, but both have their place in the Narrator’s arsenal.
A Cinematic Approach
A compromise between the conservative and narrative styles is a more cinematic
blend, which still attempts to pay close attention to the structure of the mob combat while
making each turn as narrative as possible. Like the straight narrative style, this approach
works best if the combatants are not all absolutely set on killing each other as the only
outcome. In this format, start as before by inquiring what everyone’s goals and limits are.
These answers should inform the individual turns as the scene moves forward. Then at each
turn, inquire again what everyone wants to do. If some goals can be met without problems,
simply narrate what happens instead of worrying about the challenges for everything.
Dealing with the Innocent Bystanders
In most mob combat situations, you will have a collection of onlookers who are
either there watching the scene in character and they chose not to get involved in
the chaos, or they have an out-of-character interest, and they are watching to see
how their friends do in the melee. Either case is usually fine, as long as the Narrator
makes it clear who is purely a spectator and who’s a participant. Regardless of the
method he uses, the diligent Narrator will likely want to keep these onlookers at least
informed as to what is happening in the scene so that everyone gets the most out of
it. The easiest way to do so is to call out what happens during each turn. Doing so
serves two purposes, since it not only informs and entertains the audience, but it also
will cue the participants that they have to decide what their next actions will entail.
Throughout the battle, it’s always good to keep track of roughly how much time
has passed in game, as well. Obviously this tally will never be exact, and it will never
sync up with the real time that has passed, but it’s important nonetheless. When
large combats break out, the local authorities tend to want to get involved to stop


75
Nuts and Bolts
Nuts and Bolts
things and restore order. It’s important to track how much time has passed inside the
scene so that the Narrator can understand when to allow outside agents to start
affecting things. Since most turns do not take longer than about four seconds, it’s
usually not feasible to allow outsiders into the combat until it is already over.
Another factor to watch for is the passerby. Players always just happen to be walking
by, and they will typically want to either watch what’s going on or join in. Just like the
authorities, you don’t want the random passerby joining in either, since it’s unlikely that
they would actually be able to get into the situation by pure chance unless they come by
during the very first turn. After that first turn, it is advisable that the Narrator not allow
anyone new to enter the combat who was not forewarned about it. If you notice that
several people are preparing to walk back to the rest of the game, simply inform them that
if they leave the area before the scene is over, they should refrain from making any
announcements or warnings to other players based on this situation. Frankly, it is not
realistic to have the general bystander walk leisurely by the site of a fracas, watch for a
moment, go tell other people about it, then come back with reinforcements or just more
onlookers. Doing so would take several minutes at the least, and the whole combat could
be over in that much game time. Therefore you have the time-bubble effect, which
usually traps people within its influence until the scene is done unless the bystander is
willing to walk away and pretend he really did not see any of the events taking place.
Often, you will find that players are quite happy to accept that condition if it means that
they do not have to wait out of character for an hour while the mob combat runs its course.

In large games, actual players’ characters often take the place of mentors and teachers
for other characters. As such, these additional rules on Discipline teaching will help
maintain balance in an environment in which free trading may detract from the overall
flavor of the setting by allowing characters too great an access to supposedly rare powers.
All teachers must be active characters, and they may teach up to one level less than
they possess of their in-clan Disciplines. For example, a vampire who possesses an
Intermediate level of his clan Disciplines may teach the Basic levels. With the exception
of those who are portraying characters’ mentors, Narrator may not teach Disciplines.
To teach Advanced Necromancy or Thaumaturgy, the teacher must be a sixth- or
seventh-generation vampire, and he must have the Advanced level in at least two paths
of the Discipline. A character who possesses the Advanced level of two paths may teach
the Advanced level in both paths, provided she is of the appropriate generation.

A Rage Trait allows a character to make a follow up attack after a successful

attack, the player declares his intention to do so and risks a Rage Trait in the follow-

by additional extra attacks. If an opponent is using follow-up attacks (i.e., Celerity,
Rage or similar powers), Rage may be spent to participate in these challenges as normal.

HARANO
ARANO
ARANO
ARANO
ARANO
Harano is an inexplicable gloom and inexpressible longing for unnamable
things. Some say it is caused by contemplation of Gaia’s suffering. Garou who suffer
from Harano are prone to depression, lassitude and sudden mood swings. They may
not act at all, or they may explode into intense but ill-advised activity. One never
knows. What is certain is that a Garou suffering from Harano is certainly not at his
best, and he may well be a liability to his pack, his sept and the fight to defend Gaia.
It is not common for a Garou to plunge into Harano, but it happens often enough
to make it a concern. At the Narrator’s discretion, any werewolf who has suffered some
sort of crushing defeat recently (failure of a plan, loss of a loved one, extended
humiliation) must make a Mental Challenge against 10 Traits. If he fails, he slips into
Harano. Although this condition is not permanent, the gloom of Harano is hard to lift.
A player whose character suffers from Harano must make a Willpower Test against
seven Traits each scene. If he fails, the Garou plunges into either of the following:
Fanatical, Desperate Activity — The Garou must succeed on a Simple Test to
avoid acting immediately on any impulse that comes to mind. Furthermore, he is
down three Traits on all Mental and Social Challenges, and loses all ties.
Deep Gloom and Depression — The Garou must succeed on a Simple Test to
act at all. Otherwise he simply curls up and hopes the world goes away. In addition,
he is down three Traits on all Mental and Social Challenges, and loses all ties.
These effects last for the duration of a scene. A new test must be made at the
beginning of the next scene.
Furthermore, the senses of any Garou in Harano are inevitably distorted by his
intense inner torment; all Garou in Harano are down one additional Trait in any
challenges involving sight, smell or hearing.
Those who suffer from Harano may have moments of lucidity after the expenditure
of a Willpower Trait. This expenditure lifts the gloom for as many hours as a character
has permanent Willpower. Harano is not necessarily permanent. Extraordinary Garou
may free themselves from its grip after exceptional travails (at Storyteller discretion).
Given the crippling effects of this condition, only extreme circumstances
should sink a player’s character into Harano.

character has two Renown Traits not previously dedicated to the learning of another Gift.
Tribal Gifts are treasured secrets. Spirits will not teach tribal Gifts unless an
athro or elder of that tribe (who is also a player’s character) authorizes it.
Fellow Garou Teaching Gifts
Any time your character teaches or is taught a Gift from another werewolf
without the approval of a spirit that could teach it, both teacher and student of the
Gift gain a Notoriety Trait. This penalty represents the jealous nature of spirits in
their role as teachers of Gaia’s Gifts.

Haunt
There are some places in the Skinlands where the Shroud is not as strong as it
should be. Whether the place is old and spooky or actually haunted, wraiths in that
place find it easier to cross the Shroud or use Arcanoi. A circle of wraiths can create
a haunt by crossing the Shroud repeatedly and using their Arcanoi to suspend the
disbelief of the Quick (usually by scaring them), but doing so takes many years. Most
haunts are either found by a lucky few, taken over by an ambitious circle or given to
a wraith by one of the factions.

Shadowlands), or you have an unusual or fortified haunt (A large house or

5
Your haunt’s in Deader Homes and Gardens (A mansion)
Each level of Haunt lowers the Shroud rating in the area by one. For example, if
the Shroud rating would normally be eight, a second-level haunt would lower it to six.
While performing Arcanoi in the haunt, a wraith gets one free retest per Haunt rating.
These retests can only be performed once per session. While anyone may receive the
benefits of the lowered Shroud rating, the retests can only be used by the haunt’s owner.
A circle of wraiths can share the benefits of a haunt, but each wraith must put
in enough Background Traits to make the Haunt rating equal to three or higher.
They must also provide ample background justification for it. While anyone in the
haunt can share the lowered Shroud rating, only those who put background points
into it can share the free retests for Arcanoi. In this case, the number of retests for
Arcanoi for any particular character is the number of Background Traits that that
character invested, plus one. If a player’s character donated Background Traits to
Haunt, and that character is destroyed or otherwise is put out of the game, then the
Haunt rating is made of the Background Traits of the remaining characters. If the
new Haunt rating or number of remaining circle members is less than three, then the
circle will not receive free retests for Arcanoi until the situation is remedied.
Legacy
People dedicate their lives to leaving something behind to mark their existence
after they’re dead and gone. A legacy is not the memories that people have about a
wraith or things that represent their ties to the Skinlands, but rather it is a measure
of the accomplishments that they have left behind. A wraith’s legacy can be just
about anything such as a work of art, a term of slang or a scientific formula.

Once per story, a wraith can travel to the site of her legacy (or some
representation of it) and engage in a Simple Test for each level of the Legacy. Each
success heals a normal wound instantly, or an aggravated wound (with an additional
half an hour spent at the legacy site). For example, a wraith with a Legacy rating of
two makes two Simple Tests, but wins only one. In this case, the wraith can only heal
one wound in that one sitting at his legacy.
A wraith can only use a legacy for himself; he can’t use the legacy to heal others.
Wraiths cannot combine Legacy Traits as they can those for the Haunt Background.
Relics
Relics are the ghosts of items that somehow crossed over to the Shadowlands
after being destroyed, or items that were so loved by their owners that they crossed
over after their owners died. Unlike Artifacts, Relics have no special powers, they’re
just useful in and of themselves.

example, relic guns need relic bullets.)

TTUNEMENT
Players’ characters should know automatically when a wraith is making them
into a Consort. There is no challenge to detect this activity, and they can feel it each
time the wraith expends a Willpower Trait for attunement.
Attunement benefits only apply to the wraith who successfully manifested, skinrode
(or otherwise hid in the Consort), and spent the Willpower for attunement. Therefore, if
a wraith attunes a mortal to itself, then only that wraith receives the benefits of attunement,
unless other wraiths spend the time and energy to attune the mortal as well. The process
of attunement takes time. Each successful manifestation and Willpower spent for attunement
must occur on different occasions, and they can occur no more than once per night. A
Consort can be attuned to more than one wraith at a time at Storyteller discretion. If a
wraith wishes to attune someone else’s Consort to itself, then the wraith must make a greater
number of manifestation attempts and spend a greater amount of Willpower to do so. A
Storyteller determines the specific number of attempts and the Willpower cost.
Mortals with True Faith cannot become Consorts. Wraiths tend to find the
presence of such people uncomfortable to say the least. An exorcism on a Consort
by a character with True Faith will remove the effects of being a Consort.

A freehold may be taken at the previous owner’s death, or the owner can give

someone with a lesser title by demanding a fior. If the person refuses the fior, the
freehold mystically transfers to the noble. The sidhe reclaimed many freeholds in
this way upon returning to Earth.
If a freehold owner becomes Undone, the freehold drops one level per year, and
the balefire gains a bluish light. It will dry up until the owner awakes or someone else
claims the freehold. Seelie typically believe that if the previous owner returns, the
freehold should go back to them, whereas Unseelie believe that the previous owner
was weak and has lost any claim to the freehold.
Gaining Glamour
If no one is using the freehold’s balefire to heal, one person per evening may gain an
amount of temporary Glamour Traits from the balefire equal to the level of the freehold.
REAVING

EAVING
Reaving is the act of sucking extra Glamour from a freehold. Anyone may do
so, but it is considered a terrible crime. A Simple Test must be won in the presence
of the balefire, giving the Reaver a point of temporary Glamour for every three points
of permanent Banality she has. On a tie, the character gains one point of temporary
Glamour for every two points of permanent Banality she has, and the freehold drops
one level permanently. On a loss, nothing happens. The owner of the freehold will
immediately become aware of the Reaving unless the Storyteller deems that he is too
far away or insufficiently in tune with his freehold.

HIMERA
HIMERA
The four basic types of Chimera include Incidental Chimera, Dreamed Chi-
mera, Crafted Chimera and Forged Chimera. Incidental Chimera are the most
common type found in the Enchanted World. They are stray dreams that have
popped up here and there, and they are almost always tied to a specific place or
person. While these Chimera may seem solid in their proper setting, they are actually
very frail, and they will crumble if removed. Most sentient Chimera in the real world
are Incidental Chimera.
Dreamed Chimera are the type that are found most commonly in the
Dreaming. They are those that are most generally turned into Crafted Chimera.
While these Chimera are much sturdier than Incidental ones, they are still likely
to dissolve if they are not crafted or forged properly. Sentient Chimera in the
Dreaming are usually this type of Chimera. Chimera or companions created with
Dream Weaving are of this type.
Crafted chimerical items are the kind that most Kithain are familiar with.
These Crafted Chimera are items such as leather, wood or metal that have been made
into something. Generally, Chimera cannot be crafted into items more complicated
than a simple mechanical device. Crafted Chimera are still as vulnerable to Banality
as Dreamed Chimera are.
Forged Chimera are the rarest type because generally only nockers can make
them. Forged Chimera have been altered on the most fundamental level. Forged
Chimera have an amazing resilience against Banality, and they are not connected
to a certain person or place like most other Chimera are. Through their Arts, nockers
can create a wide variety of forged mechanical monstrosities.
Creating Chimera
Incidental Chimera may be changed into Crafted Chimera as per the rules in
The Shining Host with the following changes. After all the Glamour has been spent,
a point of Willpower must be spent as well. A Simple Test must then be won allowing
the Chimera to last until it comes in contact with high levels of Banality (7+ Traits).
These Chimera may still erode over time, and they may need to be infused with
additional Glamour each session at the Storyteller’s discretion.
Dreamed Chimera may be changed into Crafted Chimera as per the rules in
The Shining Host. These Chimera are much sturdier than Incidental Chimera, but
they still may fade if they come into contact with high levels of Banality (9+ Traits).
This is up to the Storyteller who may call for a Challenge or Simple Test as desired.
Chimera Creation Time
The Storyteller has final say on how much time is required to create Chimera
and companions, but it generally ranges from six hours to one year (depending on
the Background level simulated).
Treasure Creation
Treasures are not Chimera, and they are not created like standard Chimera
or companions. The creation of a treasure is an epic undertaking, one that should
require an appropriate quest of some sort. There are no raw mechanics for making
treasures. Their creation should be a story in itself, and the Storyteller should
determine when (and if) the proper moment of completion has come. Treasures
are granted powers by the supervising Storyteller with approval restrictions
equivalent to the Treasures Background. Characters who quest for a treasure must
pay an amount in Experience Traits equivalent to the rating of the treasure before
being able to harness its magic.

Each weapon has a concealability rating. If the weapon is not concealable, or
if you do not have the proper amount of clothing or cover to conceal it, you must
display that card at all times. You cannot, for example, pull a broadsword out of your
pocket. Instead, you must carry that card in hand at all times or, optionally, you could
pin the card to your shirt, indicating that the weapon is slung over your shoulder.
Someone with the Investigation Ability who wins a Mental Challenge may
notice when a character is carrying concealed weapons or items. Searching the
carrier physically reveals hidden weapons automatically without a test in most cases.

VAILABILITY
Serious firearms and archaic melee weapons can take some time to locate. Obtaining
firearms also requires a permit, which involves undergoing background checks or waiting-
periods in some areas. A character can turn to more “colorful” channels in order to procure
equipment, but shopping the black market often means shady dealings and vastly inflated
prices. The Influence values listed under many weapons’ Availability indicate the level and
type of Influence required in order to procure the weapon through illicit channels.
Otherwise, a character must have some level of the Finance Ability or money-raising
Influence to procure exotic melee weapons and nearly all firearms.
Once a character has a weapon, he can’t necessarily keep it forever. Too often,
characters run about firing shotguns and large automatic weapons without facing the
massive police manhunts that such battles invariably provoke. Take care that
characters with powerful weapons understand the equally powerful repercussions
that follow irresponsible use. These consequences not only preserve game balance,
but they enforce a sense of realism and keep the game from turning into an arms race.

Armor-Piercing
Special rounds, which are generally Teflon-coated, are able to pierce armor
with ease. Although they do not inflict extra damage, armor-piercing rounds ignore
any defenses from armor. Such rounds are typically tricky to acquire, though, and
legal inquiries often follow their use.
Destroy Shield
Although they are rare in this day and age, certain Inquisitors and anachronistic
elder vampires still use shields. A weapon capable of destroying a shield penetrates
it automatically and renders it useless after three successful blows, no matter what
size or strength the shield may be.
Fully Automatic
A firearm with this ability is capable of emptying dozens of rounds into a single target
at close range. By expending 10 bullets in a single attack, this weapon inflicts an extra health
level of damage automatically due to the sheer volume of fire. Once the clip is empty, the
character must spend one action reloading the weapon before he may fire again.
High-Caliber
Firearms of particularly high caliber can cause crippling wounds with only a few
shots. When a high-caliber bullet hits a target, the attacker should make a Simple
Test immediately. A win or tie indicates that the target suffers an additional health
level of damage from the shot.
Incendiary
Burning weapons cause aggravated wounds to just about anything. Some, such as flame
throwers or Molotov cocktails, burn the target with streams or explosions of fire, while others
such as incendiary rounds (“hot loads”) burn the target with superheated ammunition.
Mass-Trauma
Certain weapons are so powerful that they inflict massive damage on a target,
literally tearing away portions of flesh. Such weapons score an extra health level of
damage when they are used appropriately.
Speed
In close combat with someone whose weapon has a Negative Trait of Slow,
Clumsy or Heavy, you gain one additional bonus Trait, provided you have at least one
level of the Melee Ability.
Spray
The weapon can strike up to three closely grouped targets at once, as long as they
are farther than five feet from the shooter. The shooter makes one test against all the
targets simultaneously. Each target who fails the test suffers the weapon’s damage, while
each target who succeeds avoids the weapon’s damage. The shooter risks only the Traits
required to test against each member of the group, and he loses only those Traits if any
of the defenders wins the test. Submachine guns and assault rifles expend 10 rounds to
spray, and the shooter cannot use this capability at the same time as Fully Automatic.
Staking
Staking weapons paralyze vampires when a successful blow penetrates one’s
heart. The attacker must win or tie two successive Simple Tests in order to stake the
vampire successfully.
Two-Hand Requirement
Characters must employ two-handed weapons with both hands regardless of
their strength, meaning that they may not also make use of a shield or second
weapon when doing so.

Since it stops incoming damage, armor effectively grants a character extra health
levels. These health levels are lost before the character himself suffers any damage in
combat. Of course, armor does not soak all attacks. A suit of chain-mail does little good
for a character whose blood is being boiled by Thaumaturgy, for instance.
Different types of armor can absorb different amounts of punishment before losing
their effectiveness. It should be noted that armor that has lost all its health levels is not
necessarily completely destroyed. It is more likely that it has been temporarily rendered
useless instead. Of course, some attacks may destroy armor beyond repair. Fixing armor
requires the proper tools and a Static Physical Challenge with the Crafts Ability.
Armor has two different traits for game purposes. Health levels indicate how
many levels of damage the armor can absorb before needing of repair. Negative Traits
are the drawbacks a wearer gains for donning a particular type of armor. Multiple
armor types cannot be layered.

The use of explosives rarely adds depth to the telling of stories. For the sake of
dramatization, the Storyteller may have explosives destroy large tracts of land, buses
full of helpless victims (Narrator-driven characters) and floors of skyscrapers if it
adds to the story. For use among the characters of players, bombs should not be
available as offensive weapons.
Storytellers should limit the availability of explosives to prevent them from
becoming commonplace. Attempting to use explosives without having the Demo-
lition Ability should result in bad things for the foolish character. Lost limbs, hands
and nasty scarring should all be consequences of handling explosives cavalierly.

Many of the powers and Backgrounds listed in MET sourcebooks provide a frame
of time during which they are active or a set of circumstances after which the power
ends. In the course of any single evening’s game, these definitions are often enough to
define the boundaries of the powers in use. However, when the scope of the game
extends past a single night or location, things get more complicated. A small set of
these powers becomes truly problematic as the effects begin to extend beyond even the
jurisdiction of a single Storyteller. When dealing with these powers, it’s usually best to
define the basics first and then expand the concepts from that starting point.
One of the important aspects of the Mind’s Eye Theatre rules is the idea of
husbanding resources. The system is built with this game of limited resources in mind. The
players have a pool of Attributes that decreases continuously over the course of a session,
a Willpower rating which is used to invoke a large number of powers and is very difficult
to refresh and a special Trait pool (be it Blood, Gnosis, Glamour or whatever) that takes
time and effort to replenish. Retaining these expendables correctly is a large part of the
game, so regulating the times over which they can be used effectively is a key tool in the
Storyteller’s arsenal for enforcing the tension of a game. The last few hours of any long game
weekend can be especially terrifying to the players if they haven’t been able to refresh some
of those pools and the Storytellers are enforcing the duration limits in creative ways.

Within any live-action session, the possibility of having a coherent scene with
an easily marked beginning and end is unlikely at best. Most sites have an open area
that ends up being the central gathering point, and the “scene” that takes place in
that room almost never actually ends. This approach is common enough that players
have grown to expect it as a focal point of activity in a game. As a consequence, the
Storytellers are left redefining the scope of their game.
In a traditional tabletop session, a scene is marked by the change of location or a
major shift in the action of the story. The demands of a live-action game alter this
expectation dramatically, as the number of participants rises. The Storytellers have less
and less direct control over the indicators of scene. Therefore, it is best to set a standard
that everyone knows and can rely on. In the case of the scene, wherever there is a doubt
about how long something should last, the scene duration defaults to one hour or one
scene, whichever is shorter. If characters get into such situations, we still want them to
act within the confines of the scene, and not have the effects of powers spilling over into
other scenes once the immediate need is over. For example, if the local anarchs make an
attack on the prince of the city and the prince invokes Majesty and manages to escape,
he won’t have that Majesty still active when he walks into the Elysium later on to rally
the primogen. He’d have to invoke it again and pay its corresponding cost again.

ESSION
The usual definition of a session includes the events of one night’s game,
starting at character check-in and ending with a wrap-up. Surprisingly, in a long-
running game, even this value needs to be evaluated and either reinforced or tossed
aside. In any serial game, one in which the overall chronicle runs through multiple
game sessions, then the standard definition works well until the group decides to run
a full weekend-long event with multiple evenings worth of play. The plots and stories
designed for such games almost always take the multiple nights into consideration,
but the rules still just say “session.”
There are several ways to handle this, and they can even be made to handle the
time between weekly or semi-weekly games as well. The largest issue is the
replenishment of Traits. The Storytellers need to decide the rates at which Traits are
replenished. For long-running games, the following is recommended:
Attributes are replenished at the end of each evening. In a game in which things
run 24 hours a day and seven days a week, it is recommended that these Traits be
replenished only after the character sits out of play for the equivalent of a night’s
sleep. At some conventions, this measure can be an effective prod to encourage the
more exuberant participants to get some much-needed sleep.
Willpower replenishes one Trait per week on its own. A character can replenish
one additional Trait per week for satisfying the requirements of her Nature.
All special Traits (such as Blood or Gnosis) have character-driven replenishment
methods. These methods can even form the basis for stories all on their own. The more
organized games find a lot of utility in the idea of an Influence and Feeding Center for
exactly this purpose. When using such a central Storyteller base, a game typically
establishes a small area that’s considered out-of-play and always has at least one
Storyteller on duty at all times. That on-call Storyteller is then responsible for running
the feeding challenges or Influence expenditures that happen during any game. In a
Laws of the Wild game, this position is sometimes combined with the Spirit Keeper
post. In an Oblivion chronicle, this Storyteller sometimes runs Harrowings.

Dark Epics
Dark Epics
In games lasting for a few days — usually in a convention style setting — the
Storytellers need to decide how quickly the characters can recover Traits. The choice they
make can reinforce the themes and moods of the overall game. For instance, if one of your
key issues in an event is the scarcity of resources, then you will likely want to limit and slow
the rate of recovery. You may even wish to keep characters from recovering Attribute Traits
until the entire event ends, thereby forcing the players to truly think about how they will
spend Traits, and what challenges are worth their effort. To establish a more cinematic and
action-oriented theme, you may wish to make Trait-replenishment happen much faster.
Willpower, for instance, is a key Trait for using some vampiric Disciplines, so if it is
replenished in full every morning, you will encourage people to use it far more often.
Sessions have yet another connotation. In a chronicle composed of numerous gaming
groups running separate sessions in which players can travel freely between them, it becomes
important to look at the possible frequency of sessions. Many powers and refresh rates are set
on a “per session” basis. For instance, a character overcomes Conditioning in six sessions minus
one session for each Willpower Trait spent. If one of the gaming groups of your chronicle runs
once a month and its neighbor runs every weekend, which time frame is the character
supposed to use? Inconsistency will leave the players feeling like there is an inherent bias
toward or against some of them, so you will want to set a standard that is not dependent upon
the actual sessions available, or on the frequency of the gaming groups gathering. Typically,
just as a scene can default to one hour, a session can default to one month.

The last, and largest, of the variable time durations used is the story. In its

limit may work very well, but in the rolling field of a game that never stops (or which
has multiple Storytellers running multiple stories), it can be very vague. The story
duration tends to be a long-term marker of time, and it is usually composed of several
sessions. If the session equals roughly one month of time, then it is recommend that
a story be either three months or six months of real time. This measure of time may
seem unusually long, but when discussing the long term items like gaining a new Path
Trait or Virtue Trait, such a frame of time is not uncalled for.

Few creatures in the World of Darkness welcome the idea of dealing and
mingling openly with other supernatural creatures. The denizens of the World of
Darkness all have secrets that they struggle to keep hidden. Every kind of monster,
after all, has some prohibition against revealing its true nature to anyone who is not
already in the know. This secrecy is an important aspect of the world, and it helps
the Storyteller establish a sense of mystery and exploration. The world is much more
frightening when the characters don’t understand the fine points of werewolves and
ghosts. Times come, though, when the crossover game is exactly what you want.
Most crossover games present a stylistic risk to the unprepared Storyteller. That
risk is that the crossover game, more so than any single setting on its own, tends to
devolve into one of three unfavorable scenarios. Note that there are generally
positive versions of all three of these scenarios, but the following represents the most
likely end when things don’t go the way you planned.

it inevitably results in one side losing — with all the accompanying hard feelings.
An example of this pitfall would be a Shadow Lord walking into an Elysium,
overbidding the prince’s Majesty and slaughtering him while a shocked court looks
on with no means of overcoming the beast’s frightful Icy Chill of Despair. As a plot
device, it could be great, but when the Shadow Lord was supposed to be a cunning
infiltrator until the player decided to branch out… well, that can get messy.

This pitfall occasionally is the result of vampire/ werewolf crossovers, but is just
as prevalent in the werewolf/ changeling dynamic. It typically leads to the free
exchange of lores and items that truly do not belong in the opposite setting, which
wreaks havoc on a Storyteller’s ability to control the flow of information in the game
and upsets the themes we strive to establish.

This is the typical result of wraith/ vampire crossovers, although it has been
known to characterize the results of almost any crossover combination. Typically
this pitfall occurs when an interaction fails to produce a definable result or add to the
host setting’s themes or plots. The interaction is reduced to background noise
subtracting from the inherent mood and ambiance of the host genre. For example,
your local game plays in a small bar and the wraith that you just approved for the
subtle shock and horror value is drowned out by the background noise of the club and
most of the other participants simply tune the intruder out.
A successful crossover requires that the Storytellers pay special consideration to
the two most basic tools at their disposal: plot and mechanics. Loss of plot leads either
to senseless violence and friction or to the lion and lamb lying down together. Loss of
mechanics inevitably ends in making players angry when they feel that they’ve played
at the expense of their character. While this can be said of almost any chronicle, it’s
particularly evident during the cross-genre event as creatures of vastly different aims
and abilities attempt to get the better of each other. Despite all the pitfalls of such an
endeavor, though, a successful crossover game can add immensely to the story. In any
crossover, you can limit the number of intruders into the host setting (such as a pack
of werewolves coming into a Camarilla Elysium), make the game a free-for-all
crossover with relatively equal portions of two or more supernatural creature types.

When two powers conflict, the Storyteller or Narrator should first decide who
is the more potent contestant. Compare the vampire’s Discipline level, werewolf’s
Rank, mage’s Sphere rating, wraith’s Arcanoi, or changeling’s Art level and
determine the higher level. If any question of effectiveness arises, decide in the favor
of the more potent contestant, as noted in the Power Interaction chart. Obviously
doing so is unnecessary in some cases (such as when a vampire tests damage down
with Fortitude), but it can save a lot of time in resisted efforts.
This approach will generally speed up the interactions and dispute resolutions
immensely, but it will have the side effect of favoring vampires, fae and wraiths, who
can buy up to Advanced powers without the accompanying hassle of buying up
expensive Arete Traits or Rank.
As an example, a vampire with Intermediate Obfuscate should be able to hide
from the Rank One or Two werewolf with Heightened Senses without much difficulty.
If the Garou is of Rank Three or Four, they should test as normal. If the Garou is Rank
Five, he would see through the vampire’s effect.

to the Storyteller in order to help control the flow of the story. The Storyteller should

Vampires are unchanging, immortal and mostly uncaring. In short, they are the
physical embodiments of a wraith’s Angst and a changeling’s Banality. They are
creatures of the Wyrm even if they have never heard of the Wyrm. Standing in a
roomful of vampires should be remembered as a frightening brush with Death’s
favorite agents. Changelings should walk out of the room clutching their coats
tightly against the cold, while the restless dead try desperately to remember what it
was they love without drowning in the oblivion these creatures exude. Garou caught
making deals with vampires over a long period of time should expect to at least be
challenged on the “rightness” of such dark dealings. No one wants to deal with
vampires, but they are the undisputed masters of the cities and the mortals. They do
not have as many of the innate tricks and advantages as the other types of
supernatural creatures do, but no one else blends in as well as the dead.
Few vampire-specific rules present problems between vampires and other supernaturals.
Simply keep the comparison chart in mind when dealing with opposed abilities.

The following is a short list of key issues:
The Gauntlet
Vampires tend to be rather static and unnatural creatures. In the Garou’s terms,
they are creatures of the Wyrm who are powered by the Weaver. As such, feel free
to make the Gauntlet in areas that vampires frequent fairly high. An 8 would not be
unreasonable for someplace such as Elysium. This limit alone will help cut down on
the tendency for Umbral incursions or strikes against vampires.
Fae, wraiths and mages all hold places of power, which are known as freeholds,
haunts and Chantries respectively. These places of power usually have lower
Gauntlet ratings except where a concerted effort has changed the Gauntlet. For
instance, a Technocracy lab is still going to have a Gauntlet rating of 9 or 10, but

the Gauntlet rating in a Dreamspeaker’s sweatlodge may be as low as it is in a

Banes and Vampires
Banes love vampires. Vampires are innately unnatural, and their existence is
dependent on inhumane and “evil” acts. They spawn feelings of pain and betrayal,
and they bring out the worst in people. Any Garou attempting to approach vampires
through the Umbra should expect to deal with several Banes as the spirits harvest
the ill will that surrounds vampires. After interacting with vampires, they may also
pick up a Bane that may plague them for days or weeks to come. Most Banes will not
bother to affect vampires. They recognize the fact that they both are on the same
side, even if the vampires don’t. Obviously, the larger the gathering of vampires is,
the more Banes will be attracted to the area. Therefore, a conclave of several
hundred Cainites might bring together hundreds of hungry Banes in a weekend long
feeding frenzy, of which the vampires themselves remain blissfully ignorant. If you
want to encourage the interaction between vampires and werewolves, then reduce
the number to a more manageable level, but this is one of the few limiting factors on
the abuse of the Umbra against Cainites.

Mixing wraiths and vampires is popular due to the similar themes expressed in
each setting. Special care needs to be taken in such a crossover, though. Vampires
have almost no natural defenses from wraiths, and the wraiths have several Arcanoi
that allow them to affect and harm a physical creature directly. Werewolves and the
fae are more evenly matched versus wraiths, although still not entirely so. When
judging an interaction between wraiths and anything in the Skinlands, keep the
following things in mind at all times:
The Shroud
This rating defaults to an 8, and it must be beaten in a Static Mental Challenge at
the start of every scene in which the wraith is attempting to affect something on the other
side. Using Embody to cross it physically will negate this challenge and allow the direct
usage of all other Arcanoi. Crossing the Shroud thus also leaves the wraith open to such
retaliations as Disciplines, Gifts and Physical Challenges. Note that particularly intense
scenes may require testing against the Shroud for every turn at the Storyteller’s discretion,
instead of every scene. If you would like to make things easier to cross between vampires
and wraiths, any gathering of vampires is bound to lower the Shroud slightly since a
gathering of the undead tends to lend a creepy and gothic feel to any place.
Right-Minded Wraiths Fear Angst
Any collection of vampires is a veritable festival of Angst. A good technique
to bring this point home: Have a wraith make a simple test every time he enters a
scene with more vampires than his permanent Angst rating, in order to resist gaining
a temporary Angst. Spectres, of course, are immune to this aspect of the collected
psychic baggage of a roomful of the dead, although they may attempt to harvest
Angst as normal. Conversely, Spectres in the presence of several Garou or fae should
likely test for temporary Composure in the same manner as wraiths for Angst.
Lifesight Works Against Vampires.
Lifesight will function as Aura Perception for the purposes of information yielded.
However, it is only an innate ability of wraiths, so any level of Obfuscate that the
vampire possesses will defeat it. For instance, while this ability will not allow a vampire
with only Unseen Presence to mask his true feelings (Soul Mask is still needed for that),
it will allow him to remain hidden when the wraith using Lifesight is looking for him.

Presence (including Majesty) and Dominate Cannot Cross the Shroud.
A wraith may act against a character with Majesty without testing. This also pertains
to gifts such as Roll Over and Icy Chill of Despair, Arts such as Sovereign, and the mortal
arts of Fascination. The wraith must embody in order to be affected by these powers.
Obtenebration is a Manifestation of Oblivion.
The vampiric Discipline of Obtenebration can be treated as if it accessed Oblivion
directly. Any wraith caught within the confines of an effect of Obtenebration should test
for a temporary Angst Trait as the Shadow siphons a small bit of Oblivion into itself.

The fae and vampires don’t interact much on widespread levels, although a few
very notable exceptions do occur. Mixing these two settings is a wonderful opportunity
to highlight all the things that vampires have lost. The undead can generally be
considered as walking manifestations of Banality and loss. The only exceptions to this
guideline are the Malkavians who have both relatively low Banality levels and an
affinity to the Dreaming. Therefore, they should not count against the total Banality
of a room. The Kiasyd have an affinity for the Dreaming, but normal Banality for a
Vampire. Ravnos vampires have a low Banality, but no affinity to the Dreaming.
Garou are more likely to interact with the fae, due to similarities of setting more than
anything else. While Garou do not inherently exude Banality as vampires do, they are
still fearsome creatures with an extremely quick temper, and care should be taken in the
interactions of the two groups. These interactions should highlight the similarities
between their struggles but make it clear that the struggles are not really compatible. A
good theme here is to play the differences of each race against the similarities.
The restless dead have little to do with the fae, or more precisely, the fae want
little to do with them.
The Mists
Everyone is subject to the Mists, with the sole exception of Malkavian vampires.
Banality
Most fae Arts are fairly fragile in that retests are almost unheard of, but they are also
unfettered in what they can accomplish. Banality is one of the few natural defenses that all
other creatures have against the fae Arts. Setting the Banality of the other creatures in the
chronicle is a great way to help limit or control interactions of a magical nature. The average
vampire, for example, has a Banality of approximately 8. However, if you would like the
interactions to be more difficult, feel free to raise the Banality to a 9 or even a 10.
Individual Powers
As far as powers go, several Arts can be rather heinous when used against
another creature type. Some examples are Elder-Form, Quicksilver and Flicker Flash.
A Storyteller should never feel out of line for stating that it is not possible to convert
the angry Get of Fenris into a toad by kissing it on the nose with Elder-Form/Dire
Enemy. Chicanery should be treated just like Obfuscate for purposes of testing against
Auspex, and Thaumaturgical countermagic does work against fae Arts.

All of the preceding suggestions are primarily tips aimed at allowing the Storyteller
to introduce controlled elements of another creature type into a host setting, such as
injecting a handful of Garou into a large vampire chronicle. It is entirely possible to
simply open the floodgates and allow all five main types of supernaturals into one
chronicle setting, though, either by running all of the various creatures in separate but
connected games or by simply allowing all of them to mix at the same game. In a free-

for-all game, you will need to decide ahead of time how special abilities are handled and
how the many genres will interact. The setting-specific scores that affect others need to
be assigned — such as giving all characters a Banality score and assigning a base Banality,
Shroud and Gauntlet rating for each major game area of your site. Decide if you will be
using the Power Interaction chart for competing powers or if you will be simply allowing
everyone to test. The first option speeds things up but puts more emphasis on the
Storyteller to make sure that weaker creatures don’t get completely run over. The second
option will likely seem more level, but it will result in far more challenges.

While the other supernatural creatures all hunt and stab at each other, the
mortals slide by unnoticed and try desperately to avoid being caught. A mortal in an
interaction with almost any other creature type will die in an outright fight. If he
plays intelligently and carefully, he has a much better chance of surviving in the long
run. Mortals should represent the best agents for the dissemination of information
between groups and one of the greatest security risks to each supernatural type. That
is, after all, why there’s a Veil, a Masquerade, a Dictum Mortuum and a Right to
Ignorance. Mortals risk their lives every time they enter even play with supernaturals,
simply because of what they are. It’s part of the thrill of being human.

Lores gained on subjects outside the host setting should almost always be purchased

a player to spend an Experience Trait on the odd lore is a show that he truly is devoting
time and effort to learning this information. It will also help cut down on extremely high
lores for characters outside of the setting. It is certainly not unreasonable to ask them to
spend points on information to reflect a level of true understanding.

In any chronicle in which there are multiple Storytellers or multiple games
running (not just multiple sessions), it is important to set a standard for Experience
Trait awards. If one chronicle runs twice as often as a chronicle in a neighboring area,
characters in the more commonly played chronicle will grow in power at twice the
rate of their neighbors. To facilitate a balance of power in networks made up of
multiple chronicles, the Storytellers should set a maximum possible award per each
given period of time. It is recommended that the number of Experience Traits one
can earn be capped with a per-month maximum. The exact number of Experience
Traits one can earn per month should be based upon the desired learning curve.

A large chronicle’s learning curve is one of the more important aspects to consider
before beginning. How powerful should the characters be at the start of the chronicle?
In the middle? Near the end? How quickly should a character be able to learn
something new? Should certain things (such as high level Lores or Superior Disci-
plines) be off-limits characters within the chronicle’s time span? When you have
answered these questions, you will be prepared to set the maximum for your monthly
Experience Trait cap or devise a similar system to regulate the power of the characters.

each month. You will find that the longer your chronicle runs, the greater the diversity
in power levels grows between the characters of such players and the players who attend
only occasionally. This diversity is not a bad thing. People will put into your chronicle
what they expect to get out of it. Often though, this escalation creates an arms race
among players as they build their characters to new heights in an attempt to keep up
with one another’s power levels. Experience Trait build-up leads to several problems.
The first and most important is that players lose track of the goal of the game, which
is to have fun in a live-action setting, not to build stats on a piece of paper.
Another problem is that if a player’s character is killed after the player spent the
last two years investing Experience Traits into it, she can be disheartened by her
reduced standing in the race. For similar reasons, players who have a lot of
Experience Traits invested into their character will be reluctant to retire their
character in favor of exploring fresh new concepts.
One way to get around this problem is to allow a player to use a portion of the
earned Experience Traits from her last character on her new character. It is
recommended that if you use this system, you set that amount at about 25 percent,
and certainly no more than 50 percent. Giving too much back encourages players
to make careless decisions with their characters, since they have little to lose if their
character is killed. Likewise, players may retire their characters too often, which
keeps a balance of power and politics from being developed in the game.
For chronicles that are intended to run in excess of several years, a more complex
system may be required to address the problem. Varying your chronicle’s Experience Trait
caps as they apply to each character individually (based upon total Traits earned) may be
the answer. For example, if a starting character can earn a certain amount of Experience
Traits in a month until the total reaches 50, and characters with over 50 Experience Traits
can earn only half that much, older characters still end up being more powerful. However,
the gap between old and new characters can be closed a bit. If the player of the new character
earns the maximum amount each month, she will find that she is not as far behind the other
characters as she would have been if everyone had the same cap.
For more finite control of this effect (with a touch more complexity), consider
applying this graduated Experience Trait cap in several tiers, gradually reducing the
maximums for characters as they increase in power. This system allows you to better
control the learning curve in your chronicle and extend its lifetime. Each month, the
player checks her total earned Experience Traits and compares it to your graduated
chart to find out what her maximum will be for that month. If you give extra
Experience Traits at character creation to some characters, do not consider these
Traits when calculating “earned” Experience for these purposes.

Sometimes the Storyteller may wish to exercise even more control over the
characters’ growth in a chronicle. In this case, it might simply be better to award
Experience Traits based on the desired rate of increase, rather than the standard
method. In chronicles that run with large periods of time between sessions (such as
an annual event), the Storyteller may wish to award Experience Traits in a similar
manner rather than relying on the standard method.

The World of Darkness is a constantly expanding and changing work, and many
players want to feel that they are in a chronicle that reflects the major changes in that world.
These changes are realized in two principle ways — through rules and through plot.

Nuts and Bolts
The rules evolve as the Storyteller system matures. New rules and creatures get
added in, and new powers are created. These new features are all additions to the
basics defined in the main rulebooks, which you can use or discard as your chronicle
warrants. The core mechanics of the systems stay relatively stable, while much of the
additional material is quite easily updateable and changeable.
The Storyteller is responsible for establishing the system for converting new
material into the chronicle in a fair and consistent manner. The goal of any
conversion is to make new material available to the players without upsetting the
balance of your existing game world. Where possible, it’s beneficial to try and
incorporate anything new with story lines that will explain the additions while
adding an element of mystery and surprise to the chronicle.
Adhering to the White Wolf metaplot is usually the best way to incorporate new
material if your game stays true to the published materials. Most of the published plot
points are far enough removed from the everyday activities of the characters to be run
as background elements which the characters can then investigate if they chose but
which still impact on the characters’ existence if they choose to ignore them. The
large-scale chronicle has to look at these points carefully since the events usually
assume that most of the world is composed of Storyteller characters, which is not

Here is an example of the graduated Experience Trait caps in use. The
Storytellers desire to run a chronicle for five years. They want the characters to
start out at the standard power level, then develop to about 100 earned

progression so that they will have earned no more than 150 by the end of the
chronicle.

usually the case in a truly large game. Therefore, it is sometimes useful to break the
changes down into changes that are justification for rules additions and changes that
are purely setting additions. Rules addition changes should be implemented if the
chronicle is going to use the new rule, while setting additions need to be evaluated on
the basis of the chronicle’s commitment to stay true to the White Wolf story line.
An example of a change implemented for the purpose of making a rules addition
is the advent of the plague which afflicted the Malkavian clan and left the clan with
Dementation instead of Dominate. Clearly, this event is something that you can run
in your chronicle to explain the change. It can have a positive impact on the stories
of every Malkavian in your chronicle and give them the reasoning to transition over
to Dementation.
The destruction of the Ravnos Antediluvian, on the other hand, does not
explain any changes in the rules since it is a more purely story-driven plot point. It
is a part of White Wolf’s published story line, and can be easily implemented through
the Time of Thin Blood sourcebook. However, if you aren’t following the official
story line, there’s little express need to run the story in that book, except that it would
be fun for the players involved.

New releases are part and parcel of the gaming experience. Players will
constantly ask if they can use the latest gadget or ability that was published in a new
supplement. Being prepared for this situation is essential to any long-time Story-
teller. As long as the Storyteller understands how the new rules fit into the chronicle,
and he sticks to a plan to implement them, there is no reason for such things to be
unduly painful to a game. Your game can implement new materials as soon as they
are available, which becomes less about Storytellers implementing changes accord-
ing to plots run in the chronicle, and more about when your players can purchase the
new books. You can also schedule points in the game when new rules will generally
be implemented. Scheduling regular intervals for updates will make anticipating
those updates easier for the players and minimize the negative impact of not having
a direct control over the game’s growth in this area, but it also can remove some of
the spontaneity of the constantly growing chronicle.
When making changes to a chronicle, decide whether the change needs to be
explained in the world with a plot that alters things to accommodate the new rule,
or if it simply needs to change and be done. Major system changes and rules that are
not tied to the setting are best to simply drop into place on a set date and be done
with, since doing so forces the players to change and everyone has to deal with it
together. Setting-related changes are best explained through a plot that the players
can experience for themselves.

While most of White Wolf’s core rules have been converted to MET — and
even many of the more obscure rules have been brought over to MET by now — your
players will always want to bring forward a few small rules to have them converted
for their characters. If you choose to allow this conversion, it is highly recommended
that you develop a small system for converting these tabletop rules to the MET. Our
recommendation would be to assign this duty to a specific Storyteller or team of
Storytellers and let them do it for the entire chronicle. Relying on this team will help
keep consistency high, which helps keep the converted rules fair and balanced in
relation to other, more established rules.

When converting rules from the tabletop sources, try to keep to a few simple
tips in mind:
Try to stay as true as possible to the original idea. If you didn’t like what the rule
or power was trying to accomplish, you wouldn’t be converting it. That sounds like
an obvious point, but as you try to translate ideas from one system to another, it’s
sometimes easy to warp the original intent of a rule beyond recognition.
Try to maintain definable benefits and flaws in your conversions. It’s great to
say that a certain power makes the character more attractive when activated and
that people can’t resist their presence, but that benefit alone doesn’t really describe
anything that can be enforced as a mechanic. It’s always better to include some form
of mechanics that will add or subtract defined Traits and abilities. Stating that a
power makes someone more attractive and adds the Social trait of Attractive and
gives a free retest on Presence Challenges is much more helpful.
Try to avoid powers that allow one character or character type to have a huge
statistical advantage. While it may seem great for a new discipline to have the ability
to stake anyone without a test, the people who are victims of that power won’t likely
be having much fun. Try to always allow for a way to counter the power, or at least
provide a test so that some element of escape is available.
Don’t make up completely new mechanics when existing ones will do. Part of
the danger of any new rule is that it won’t fit in well with the rules that are already
in play, or that it will needlessly complicate matters. Be familiar with other published
conversions and look for similar powers in supplements that can be modified slightly
to arrive at the goal you want. Doing so can relieve you of the necessity of making
up wholly new material, while assuring you that the new rule will fit in well with the
established material.
Activation costs such as Blood, Gnosis, Rage, Willpower and Glamour that
must be expended to initiate or fuel a power usually rely on a straight one-to-one
conversion. For instance, all Thaumaturgy powers cost one blood point to activate
in tabletop, and the same is true in the MET version.
Tabletop rules sometimes require a roll against a standard difficulty to activate
a power. Usually, this mechanic can be translated as an appropriate Static Test
against a difficulty slightly higher than the tabletop version. For instance, if the
original write up requires a Wits roll with a difficulty of 5, it is perhaps best translated
as a Static Mental Challenge against six traits. If the tabletop power called for a Wits
roll with a difficulty of 10, the translation should likely be against 12 to 15 Traits,
which simulates more accurately the difficulty of rolling 10s.
Powers that add successes to another roll or add dice to the roll should usually
be translated as a number of Traits added to the character’s total. It is unadvisable
to add more than three or four Traits for any single power; a two-Trait addition is
more reasonable. Another way to translate these powers is to provide a retest in a
failed challenge rather than extra Traits.
It is almost always best to translate extended challenges as expending Traits. For
instance, if the original write-up requires a success for each degree of damage done
or level of success in the power, it is advisable to have the translation require the
expenditure of the appropriate Traits to increase the damage done or level of success.

Having read the previous sections, you may be thinking, “Wow, large-scale
Mind’s Eye Theatre games sound like a whole lot of work!” It’s true that planning,
setting up and running large chronicles involves a great deal of time and effort.
However, this effort gives rise to story and entertainment possibilities that are
difficult to come by in traditional MET games. For this reason, becoming a large or
long-running game is usually the goal of a starting chronicle.
As with any other activity that requires great effort, having a plan is helpful.
What follows is an attempt to guide you in all aspects of the construction of your new
and (hopefully) successful dark epic, as well as an overview of the more common
questions you’ll need to answer as the game goes on. The Mind’s Eye Theatre books
that have been published already (as well as the tabletop books that inspired them)
contain plenty of seeds for specific stories, so you won’t find a specific subsection of
them here. What this chapter does contain is advice on overcoming hurdles that
stand in the way of creating long-lasting stories for a large group of people.

Every interesting story, no matter how complex or moving it is, is built in the same
fundamental way. From the way you relate what happened to you over the weekend
to the events in a high-tech spy novel to your average live-action roleplaying
sequences, all stories demonstrate three standard elements. The first such element is
that of the character. Without a character, you don’t have a story. The second element
is the goal. The character wants to reach that goal, and the story exists in order to show
whether the character achieves it or not. The final standard element of a story is the
obstacle. Whether it takes the form of an army of invading heathens, a vicious storm
in unfriendly territory or a debilitating shortcoming of the character’s own psyche, the
obstacle in a story exists to keep the character from achieving his goal.
Use these elements as you create plots in your live-action chronicle. Start by
examining your characters and thinking up a goal for them to strive for. Ask yourself
what it is that your players’ characters want. Do they want peace in a highly

contested piece of prime real estate? Do they want to overthrow a villainous
authority figure and establish a more egalitarian regime? Do they want to purge their
ranks of those characters who will not get with the program?
Once you find out what they want, provide some means of achieving those
goals. Have your Storyteller characters drop hints about certain current or upcoming
opportunities that the characters will have for pursuing those goals. If the players’
characters don’t bite right away, start to show them what will happen to the setting
(or in their personal lives) if they do achieve the goals in question. Give them plenty
of reasons to take action.
Once the characters are motivated, set up the obstacles. If the characters want
to achieve these goals so badly, who else might be interested in pursuing said goals?
When you’re setting up whatever the goal is, it’s a good idea to make it something
that both the protagonists and antagonists want.
After you’ve set up the goal, gotten the characters motivated and engaged the
obstacles in the characters’ path, your plot-creation work is all but finished. The rest
of the plot-related work that goes into a chronicle is that of making sure that the
characters remain on track until they have either achieved their goal or failed to do
so. Once the outcome of the players’ characters struggle (or the story arc) ends, it’s
up to you to set another goal up with which to tantalize the characters.
It’s awfully cavalier to make that kind of statement, though, and make the job
in question sound so easy. The toughest part of being a Storyteller and dealing with
plots in a large live-action game is that you have to perform the same process for
multiple stories of varying scope and complexity all at the same time in order to
incorporate as many players as possible. Fundamentally, however, the task of
creating a story is just that simple, and the text of this chapter goes over some of the
considerations that go into each step of story-creation. Once you get these basics
down, you should be just as ready to handle live-action plots in a dark epic chronicle
as you would be in a standard-size chronicle. The hardest part is really the legwork.

When considering a plot idea, remember to devote an amount of time to creating
the plot that’s proportional to the time you expect the plot to be active. If you want
a plot to run for months on into years, don’t think that you can scratch off an outline
over lunch. A common mistake Storytellers of large games make is to create plots
without fleshing them out. This mistake is usually revealed when an unforeseen action
on the part of the players causes the plot to unravel far earlier than the Storyteller would
have preferred. Trying to account for all the variables in the way a plot plays out
(especially a plot that involves a large number of characters) takes a long time. To
avoid this problem, consider the following questions when constructing a plot:
What is the time frame for this plot?
Do you intend to make this idea a centerpiece of your chronicle, or will it be a
short diversion or follow up to previous character actions? Depending on your
answers, you’ll need to budget your time both in and out of game to do justice to the
idea. There is nothing so annoying to a player as a plot that fizzles just as it’s getting
interesting or a fairly minor plot that drags on and on.
Is this plot idea something that would appeal to the player base?
You may think that the immortal globe-trotting veteran of the Finnish War that
you’ve been fleshing out since your seventh-grade World History class is the neatest
character concept since Hamlet. You may think that his search for his family’s lost signet

ring makes for the most heart-wrenching story since Schindler’s List. It is unlikely, however,
that your players will agree. Players are looking for substance in live-action stories, but that
substance must be of interest to them. Never rely on ideas that are too obscure or too tedious
to be of immediate interest to a majority cross-section of your players.
Can I tie character backgrounds into the plot?
Following up on the previous question, your players are much more likely to be
interested in a plot line that includes elements that affect their characters directly.
Tying your local underworld kingpin into a plot that has to do with a power play in
the arms-smuggling business via a long time friend (from his character history) is a
much better idea than having a random source in the player’s downtime report
relaying news to him anonymously.
What is the threat level of this plot?
Plot can kill, but it does not have to kill. Should you arrive at the conclusion that
characters can die in the course of your plot, you need to ensure that the story payoff will
be such that they will feel rewarded even if they do not come out alive. Having a character
die is painful, but knowing that his death was worth something lessens the blow
somewhat. Also, remember that not every antagonist should seek to kill a story’s
protagonist(s), even if a major difference of opinion on one or more issues separates them.
Can I involve characters of various potencies in this story?
Generally speaking, your plots should be accessible to all levels of players, from
those who are new to your game to those who have been around from day one. Granted,
certain plot lines do not lend themselves easily to upholding that ideal. Plots that set
the characters against minor threats are imminently accessible to weak or inexperi-
enced characters, but they are consequently uninteresting to more experienced ones.
The challenge of major threats may be perfect for higher-level characters, but they will
very likely destroy any low-level characters who have the gumption to tag along.
When you create stories for groups of characters of various strengths, try to
separate the characters’ identifiable goals into sub-goals of equal importance but
varying difficulty. Doing so can be as simple as making sure that antagonists in a mob-
combat scene attack protagonist characters of an equal or greater degree of power,
or as complex as arranging circumstances in such a way that the characters decide
to split up into internally consistent specialty groups.

Whether they are character-generated or Storyteller-generated, plots must fit
the chronicle that you are creating. Based on the earlier decisions you made when
setting up the chronicle, you should have some idea of how grandiose you want your
setting to be. Depending on your decisions, your chronicle will be one of three sizes.
Usually, chronicles will start at the local scale and progress to the mixed scale, where
they tend to stay. World-spanning chronicles are comparatively rare due to the
heavy plot involvement that is required of the Storytellers, but they are not so very
difficult if you give yourself plenty of time to prepare them.

Best suited for smaller player groups, the plot and world background of this
chronicle centers around the immediate political landscape. Plots involve local
problems created by local threats. The antagonists, while possibly tied to world-
spanning organizations (such as a nomadic Sabbat pack that operates out of the
barrens or a wandering collection of Banes that has drifted into the nearby Umbra)

will not rely on their connections to those organizations. Individual motivations are
especially important to both the antagonists and the protagonists, and the charac-
ters’ goals will be personal on almost every level.
Even at this basic scale, however, plots can be complex and have long-lasting
effects. A plot in which the leadership of the local sphere of influence changes can
change the entire dynamic of the chronicle. Member chronicles in a network tend
to tell stories of this scale, however, no member chronicle is an island.

When plots reach this scale, some elements of the local setting have begun
interacting with elements of the greater community to which they belong. Examples
include the local vampire prince who has achieved sufficient power and respect to
influence neighboring cities and states, or the wise Theurge of the Garou who now
accepts students and questing tribemates from nearby septs. Plots of this scale tend
to affect the heads of the society in question first then trickle down to smaller movers
on the local scene.
This scale is a very comfortable level for both players and Storytellers, since it
provides the variety of a connection to non-local events while retaining the focus
on local events that the previous level of involvement had. It is important, however,
to ensure that the stories of this scope that you tell are entertaining for all players.
Due to the monopolization of societal connections by more experienced players,
new players or lower point players may feel left out of the equation. To keep as many
people as possible busy in a mixed-scale plot, make sure that the larger events in the
story have a definite and immediate impact on the local scene.

Generally speaking, world-spanning settings are rare in live-action gaming, and
they are difficult to construct. One method of creating a world-spanning plot requires
that your player’s characters and your Storyteller characters possess sufficient political
and personal power to make them the center of the culture of which they are a part.
For this level of scale to serve as an ongoing chronicle, you must also see that you have
a sufficient reason for such powerful characters to be massed in one area. Resist the urge,
however, to trot out the All-Consuming End of the World Threat. Saving the world
once makes for a fine and fulfilling story; having to save the world time and again will
eventually bore your players and make you feel like a scriptwriter for Dragon Ball Z.
An easier way to create a world-spanning plot is to drop a key element of that plot
into your chronicle and make clear the chain of events that will result when your
players’ characters resolve that part of the plot. The scope of the action of your plot
remains local, but the ramifications of your characters’ actions resound throughout the
World of Darkness. Similarly, you can use the outcome of an individual chronicle’s
local plot as the genesis for a broader chain of events throughout a chronicle network.
Like knocking over dominoes, one chronicle’s actions will affect its neighboring
chronicles, and their reactions will affect still more neighboring chronicles until the
entire network feels the effects of what was originally a local story.

Before you can scout out potential players, create characters, construct plots or
determine the breadth of your version of the World of Darkness, you should
determine what sort of theme and mood you want your chronicle to uphold. Theme
and mood considerations affect all aspects of your chronicle. Deciding on a mood will


107
Plots
Plots
help you create advertising materials (should you be planning an open-access game),
determine what sites are best suited for your game, decorate the play areas and figure
out what day and time you will be running the event. An understanding of the
chronicle’s theme helps players create characters that will flourish in your game and
avoid types that will fail. Storytellers and Narrators will build plots and characters
based on these considerations, and the success of your story can be judged based on
how well it has stayed true to the theme and upheld its mood.
Books, magazine articles, plays or movies you’ve enjoyed can all provide ideas for you
to choose from. They need not even be supernatural in nature. The air of scholarly intrigue
and whodunit mystery in Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose would suit a number of
factions in the World of Darkness perfectly, ranging from the vampires of Clan Tremere
in Vampire: The Masquerade to the enlightened wizards of the Order of Hermes or
Celestial Chorus in Mage: The Ascension. Also, don’t be afraid that you’ll ruin a perfectly
good theme by pulling it out of its original context and applying it to a modern story. A good
theme appeals to something central in the human mindset, and it can be recast in any
number of settings and genres. A good example of how a theme (or even just a good story)
can last the ages would be Akira Kurosawa’s The Seven Samurai, which subsequently was
adapted in the United States as The Magnificent Seven. Despite major changes in setting and
time period (not to mention language), the theme still shone through.
The best place to start in your review is your potential player base. You could
choose a theme because it seems interesting to you, but will this same theme appeal
to those people you would like to see playing the game? For example, a player base
that is young, immature or new to MET might not appreciate (or even recognize)
a particularly subtle or complex theme. Such players might also have trouble
separating their appreciation for a well-constructed mood from the way they actually
feel when they are exposed to it. Creating a perfect mood of morbid despair with a
story is an impressive feat, for example, but your work won’t be worth anything if the
players are too depressed by your chronicle to come back for more. As players grow
in experience and artistic taste (should you even want them to), you can vary your
choice of theme and use more subtle means of evoking dramatic mood. Otherwise,
keep your theme basic and rely on direct action to get your mood across.
When considering which genre of Mind’s Eye Theatre game to play, don’t be afraid
to play against type in support of your theme and mood. While the core setting of a game
may present certain facts as gospel, you do not necessarily have to transfer these ‘facts’
faithfully. Rather than the standard themes of redemption or freedom that Masquerade
games are heir to, consider the theme of honor. What would the honorable action be
should a Camarilla neonate receive direct proof that the Sabbat sect is telling the truth and
that the Camarilla really is the tool of the eldest vampires? Playing with setting
conventions thus is an excellent way to give existing settings great new twists, and it will
go a long way toward increasing excitement and interest in your chronicle.
The final consideration when choosing themes and moods for your chronicle
is your logistical base. In other words, are the themes and moods that you are
considering ones that can be supported by your available site and the time you will
be able to devote to the game? If your potential play site is a series of unfurnished
basement rooms, trying to evoke the regal grandeur of Renaissance Europe will
probably not be successful. On the other hand, if your play site is out in the middle
of nowhere and well beneath the notice of overeager societal watchdogs, it will be
easier to explore the theme of the consequences of growing decadent. Your site will
encourage images in the mind of your players, and these images will determine what
they will bring both to their characters and to exploration of the theme and mood.

Even the greatest stories change direction now and then, and your chronicle
will be no different. The important thing to keep in mind is that themes and moods
can change for both good and bad reasons. It is your job as a Storyteller to
differentiate between the two.
These changes occur for a variety of reasons, the most common of which derive
from your player base. The characters in your chronicle are going to run with any
theme that is central to their existence, and they will eventually exhaust the central
theme. At this point, they will either explore related elements of different themes,
meld the existing theme with a new one or abandon the old theme entirely in favor
of a completely new one. When these things happen, consider these points as a
measure of the value of the change:
Is the change player-driven or character-driven?
A very fine line exists between these two forces, despite the fact that they both
originate from the same place. Character-driven change can best be described as
development or deviation from a what you (the Storyteller) had in mind, which is
due to the dictates of what a player has defined as his character’s motivations. This
sort of change in your theme is usually for the best, since it means that your chronicle
is supporting the sort of in-depth character development that is always enjoyable.
Player-driven change results when players make adjustments to their style or
the portrayal of their character for purely out-of-game reasons. This type of change
can involve either a desire to try something different or reflect a desire for an out-
of-game result, such as playing with a different subsection of the player base. The
effect of this kind of change on the theme and mood will usually be more abrupt and
direct than a character-based change, since it usually involves a fundamental
retooling of the current character’s goals and values. This type of change is less
desirable than one that derives from in-game changes in the characters’ lives.
However, it may also indicate that your players are not happy with the way you are
running the chronicle and that they’d have more fun doing something else.
Is the change due to dissatisfaction with the theme?
If your theme is changing due to player dissatisfaction with the current theme, there
is usually very little that you can do directly or forcibly to prevent that change. If it
happens, talk with your players. Are they generally dissatisfied (i.e., totally sick of the way
things are going)? If so, work with them to develop a theme and/ or mood that they will
enjoy playing and that you will enjoy supporting. You shouldn’t force your players to
suffer through a game that they don’t like, but you shouldn’t sacrifice the artistic
sensibility with which you create your stories just because they aren’t immediate hits.
Remember, any MET chronicle is founded on a guiding principle: People are
coming together to tell great stories and have a great time doing it. Getting upset
with each other defeats the purpose. When players and Storytellers are contentious
with each other out of game, the chronicle involved is in a great deal of trouble.

The single most important aspect of any story is the collection of characters who
populate it. Actions that will take place in a story and themes that will come out during
the telling of the tale are all well and good, but they are useless without characters to
carry out those actions or display those themes. As such, most of the Mind’s Eye
Theatre material that has been published to date revolves solely around characters and


109

the players who portray them. One could even argue that populating a large live-action
game with good characters is more important than making up good plots, since those
characters will end up creating stories just by virtue of being themselves. For the most
part, character quality is not even the Storyteller’s concern once the game is underway.
The way in which the character element of a story does concern the Storyteller,
though, lies in the overarching purpose that certain types of characters serve.
If you have had previous experience in constructing or running a small-scale
live-action roleplaying game, then you will already know that certain types of
characters appear time and again in manifold variety. Certain types of characters are
practically essential in a large chronicle that is just beginning. Should your players
not provide them, you may even need to supply these types of characters yourself in
the form of Narrator or Storyteller characters. Having these character archetypes in
a chronicle gives you a set of basic starting points on which to hang your plots.

This character will either be the total authority of the setting (e.g., a city’s
prince or the leader of the Garou sept), or he can be the point man and liaison for
the authority group (such as a representative for the Council of Nine or a visiting
Anacreon). Regardless of his actual title or his personal power, this character
represents the accepted laws and customs of the group around which your chronicle
is centered. This is not to imply, however, that this character’s power must be great
and terrible. Weak authority characters are perfect for a chronicle centered on a
theme of chaos, war or millennial disruptions.
Many chronicles will begin with a Storyteller character in this role, but the role
will usually pass on to a player’s character over time, either through Storyteller
design or through player action. You will likely find that your players will prefer to
have a one of their own in this role after a few games, since they will enjoy being able
to support or defend a fellow player.

The direct opposite of the authority archetype, the character who upholds the
opposition archetype does not necessarily have to be a violent anarchist. Rather, this
role is intended to provide a wrinkle in the social order, one that creates questions and
issues for the characters to deal with without plunging the setting into revolt. Unlike
an antagonist, the opposition character is accepted on some level by the society of the
player group. Opposition characters include disillusioned neonates, Hollow Ones and
Ragabash Garou. Their presence is intended to raise objections, not revolutionary
armies. In other words, characters of the opposition tend to approve of the general
status quo, but they object to the specific characters in charge of it.
Storytellers or Narrators can portray opposition characters, but you should
encourage the players to assume these roles. Generally speaking, players make more
convincing members of the opposition, since their separation from the Storyteller
community makes their arguments more convincing. Furthermore, some players
really enjoy playing members of the community whose quirks or philosophical
differences make them stand out.

Every chronicle is going to have a need for conflict, and the outside threat posed
by the antagonist character is the most common source of conflict in a roleplaying
setting. The antagonist is a threat to the social order, someone or something that
wishes to destroy the status quo rather than tinker with it and make it better.

Antagonists are considered anathema by the established society, and characters who
join the ranks of the antagonist will no longer be accepted by the society (unlike
persons allied with the opposition).
Regardless of whether your chronicle is new or ongoing, your players cannot portray
antagonist characters. Why? By the strictest definition of the word, each player’s
character represents a protagonist in your chronicle. That is, he pursues goals and endures
conflict based on his own motivations. In effect, every character is the main character.
Therefore, the antagonist archetype represents the characters that you (as a Storyteller)
put in the players’ characters’ way to prevent them from achieving their goals. As games
get larger and more characters get involved in your stories, the players themselves take
on the roles of antagonists as their characters come into conflict in the course of play.

When large numbers of supernatural creatures group together, a desire will arise
for things, and the merchant character fills that need. Merchant characters are dealers
in anything in which another character or group of characters has expressed an
interest. The desired things need not be physical items, although physical items such
as weapons, armor, cell-phones, computers, limousines and meeting areas are often the
most desired items. The merchant most often supplies the information needs of the
community as well, either openly or in secret. Regardless of the manner in which they
do business, merchants will always receive payment, either in hard goods or favors.
The merchant role is excellent for players’ characters, due to the networking
effect that their interactions with other players cause. Merchants create relationships
between disparate groups. In a starting game, merchant characters will need some
starting support from the Storytellers, since they will not be able to enter game with
the backing necessary to set up shop otherwise.

Players who enjoy the role of the socialite are interested in the subtle interac-

As in the case of the merchant role, the socialite archetype is a role best suited for
players’ characters. Unlike the merchant, however, Storyteller characters can work
well with players’ characters in this regard. The socialite’s player will probably want to
work with you on the decoration of your play site, since atmosphere is one of the great
aids for this character’s role. Working closely with the socialite’s player pays dividends,
in that you can get a good feel for how the players are enjoying the chronicle.

Many plot and background story elements in an MET setting have occult or arcane

MET game system you have selected, mystic characters can either be comparatively rare
or very widespread, such as they are in the Mage: The Ascension setting.
Mystics can either be Storyteller- or player-filled roles, as they will rarely take
a lead position in the plot. Advising the players as a Storyteller, however, should be
handled carefully. Your mystic should not have all the answers, but only those that
will point the players in the right direction.

take, and just asking players whether they’re having fun in a certain archetypal role.
The roles we’ve talked about are not set in stone, and they will fluctuate as players
try new things. As such, the temporary absence of a certain role from your game does
not necessarily indicate that disaster looms. However, should absences of a certain
character type develop, you might find it difficult to create certain types of plot. For
instance, you can’t very well tell a story about an internal play for power if you have
no opposition characters. You can’t engender in your characters deep soul-searching
about the ethics of their way of life if your chronicle has no antagonist characters to
provide conflict.
Should you find that your game lacks important archetypal characters and your
players don’t seem willing to take up the slack, you may want to consider inserting
a Storyteller or Narrator character into the mix. Once this character (or characters)
has become a recognizable fixture, you can use him to help tell the story that his
absence precluded.
Should you be unable to fill the archetypal gap, asking yourself the following
questions about the situation will help immensely:
Is the character climate of the chronicle to blame?
Having the right mix of characters is necessary for certain roles to succeed. When
too many players have chosen to play a particular type of character, the utility of other
types of characters will suffer. A socialite’s love of conversation and low-tension-level
character interaction will suffer in climates in which the vast majority of players are
portraying either violent characters (such as certain versions of the opposition role) or
characters who are cerebral but not talkative or sociable (such as the mystic archetype).
Socialites who lack people with whom to socialize become bored, and roleplaying suffers.
They may even add to the problem by jumping ship to the same faction that is already
overpopulated, just for the sake of interacting regularly with others.
It is possible that the problem will solve itself, as players move on to different
roles and the different roles become repopulated. Should this not happen, though,
you should encourage players gently to diversify their roles, either through develop-
ment of existing characters or by taking on new roles. Furthermore, you may want
to change you current plots or add new plots in order to encourage a return to a more
balanced atmosphere. The arrival of Storyteller or Narrator characters who have a
social emphasis can restart the atmosphere that a socialite thrives in and possibly
turn some of the attention of the players to the societal aspects of the game.
Is your plot encouraging an unfriendly atmosphere?
When the antagonist is running around with a gun in one hand and a torch in
the other, very few characters are going to have time to interact with the socialite.
Your ability to set the climate of the chronicle is a powerful tool for solving
imbalance in roles, but it very often can be the cause of that imbalance. Review what
you hope to accomplish with the plot, and change those elements that can be
changed to encourage a more balanced game.

All of the role types presented here have the potential for going over the line.
The desire for a character to seek total success in a role (i.e., to look for a way to
“win”) is a threat that you should watch out for constantly. If unchecked, that
desire can create chronicles in which only one or two types of characters are really
viable. Don’t be afraid to encourage the rise of other archetypal characters through
the use of Storyteller and Narrator characters as well as direct (though even-
handed) plot intervention.

Plot is the lifeblood of your game. Luckily for you, however, Storytellers are not
the only providers of plot. Assuming that you have quality players in your game, you
can rely on them to furnish you with characters whose motivations and backgrounds
will either provide elements for you to work with or which are fully formed plots in
and of themselves. However, you are not relieved of the responsibility to create a
world of plot for your players to interact with. After all, Storyteller plots and
character plots fulfill very different goals.
Character plot and background material provides a way for a self-directed player
to keep herself entertained over the course of several games. As such, the elements
of these plots are self-centered. Character plots are imminently fulfilling for the
player or players who created them, but they tend to lose appeal the further they grow
from the characters who set them into motion. Storytellers should endeavor to tie
these plots into the main plot line of the game as soon as possible.
The characteristics of great Storyteller-generated plots are mirror images of the
characteristics of character-created plots. Trying to visit a huge, world-spanning plot
upon a small group of characters is not the way to go. Start small, with a few minor
hints to a broad group of players. Throwing your net wide will ensure that the
maximum section of your game will be involved and entertained. Grow your plot
slowly, attaching appropriate character plots to the body of your plot. Eventually,
you will have created a plot in which many disparate characters are involved each
for their own reasons with varying levels of investment at stake. Once the characters
are motivated thus, the players will have all the more reason to roleplay and work
together against the obstacles in their characters’ way.

At some point, the character’s struggle to achieve his goal has to end one way
or another. No player will wait in line indefinitely to see if his characters’ schemes
will ever come to fruition, and no story is truly satisfying unless it concludes. The
same is true even in a long-running chronicle that you hope will still have years of
life left in it. Players may come to live-action games simply to be characters, but
characters get involved in stories in order to achieve something.
As a Storyteller, you must make sure that every story arc you create has some
way to play itself out. You need not feel inclined to make sure that the players’
characters always get what they want, but you must see that the struggle to get it
comes to a close. However, as in any novel or motion picture, a live-action story’s
resolution must always leave room for a follow-up tale. If you can, try to end every
story with a question that makes the characters want to know or find out more.
Answer the lingering questions that arose during the story arc itself, but leave
enough clues for the characters to realize that a whole new set of questions awaits.
Keep your players on the hook, and they’ll keep coming back to play in your game.
