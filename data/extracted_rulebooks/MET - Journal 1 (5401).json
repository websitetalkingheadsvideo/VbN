      "text": "actually swing the sword yourself,” they informed me. “And you throw beanbags \nat each other, too.” \nI, in my infinite wisdom at the time, responded, “AD@D? What’s that, a \nDungeons €4 Dragons knock-off? How obvious can you get?” \nDeciding then that perhaps sword-and-sorcery-type LARPs were not exactly my \nbag, my acquaintances told me that they participated in another game in which all \nconflicts and confrontations were resolved by playing Rock-Paper-Scissors -that \nthere wasn’t so much of the socking-each-other-with-the-padded-pipes business. \nThat type of game seemed a little more my speed, so they loaned me a battered copy \nof Vampire: The Masquerade as “reference material,” and off I went. \nUnfortunately, I fell out of touch with my two erstwhile gamer buddies shortly \nafter returning their book to them, and I didn’t do much roleplaying until college \n(though other friends of mine and I did make our own padded swords and hack at \neach other when the need - \nand our raging, unrequited hormones - \novertook us \nand we had to vent or die). \nIn college, I got a slightly better education in the fine points of tabletop \nroleplaying (“Boy, this When Will You Rage anthology iscool. I wonder what it’s like \nto be one of these werewolves.. ..”), and I discovered a troupe of live-action garners \non campus. I’d actually been in a Vampire tabletop game or two by this point, so \nnaturally I was ready to go. I spent my first couple of live-action games wandering \nfrom character concept to character concept until I happened upon something I \nliked and stuck with it. I was concurrently involved in increasingly more complex \nand mature tabletop roleplaying games, and I was thoroughly hooked by the end \nof my senior year. I loved the World of Darkness, favored Vampire and Werewolf, \nand adored the live-action expression of those two games. \nSo, after college, on a whim, I sent my r6sum6 to White Wolf (among other \npublishing companies across the state) and waited to see if there might be a job for \nme. As luck would have it, my gaming experience (and my preference for White \nWolfs material) complemented my editing skills, and I landed a job as an editor. \nThree short months later, my manager (or Derfishinkanadian, Hew Cliffe, as I call \nhim when he’s well out of earshot) offered me the chance to develop this quarterly. \nIt’s a perfect match, actually. I’ve come a long way from the “How in the world \ncould you have a die with only four sides?“ high schooler to the publisher-gamer I \nam now. Likewise, MET has come a long way from its boxed-set roots. The game \nand its systems will continue to change, and as I grow and change with it, I’ll keep \nyou all up to date. If you have questions, comments, advice, death threats (or pretty \nmuch whatever), let me know. I’m always here, 24 hours aday (though I only answer \ne-mail in an eight-hour block between 9:OO and 5:00), and I’d love to hear from you. \nCarl Bowen \ncarl@white-wolf.com \n"

Why not use some facade of “realism” \n(used in quotes because it is, after all, roleplaying) and get Camarilla-certified so you \ncan be intelligent roleplayers and not absurd rules-mongers? I know lots of great \nunsanctioned games that are good because the roleplaying is good, not because lots of \nbig vampires run around and diablerize each other. \nPaul Daniel Bond \nThe following responses folloru the basic e-mail reply format of cite the \noriginal text aside and arguing point by point. \nMister Bond, \nWhy in the name of all that is (or is not) holy have you adopted this over- \ncomplicated system that sacrifices the roleplaying (and thus the entire purpose \nof LARP ... )? \nSo we should jump on the Mind’s Eye Theatre bandwagon and just say to hell \nwith clearly defined rules? The live-action environment is, if anything, more \ncomplicated than tabletop. It demands a more comprehensive rules system. \nWhy not use some facade of “realism” (used in quotes because it is, after \nall, roleplaying) and get Camarilla-certified so you can be intelligent roleplayers \nand not absurd rules-mongers? \nSo since we’re not in the Camarilla, we’re not cool? \nTalk about complex. I for one don’t want to have to certify my plotlines just \nSteve McDonald - \nAthens by Night Storyteller \nso I can become one with White Wolfs fan club. \nAfter a personal e-mail back from Bond (in bold). \n[Daniel], \nI have played with both the Mind’s Eye Theatre system and our system. I \nunderstand that one of the reasons that Mind’s Eye combat is so poorly defined is \nbecause combat isdiscouraged. I think this is a bad idea, as combat is, in many ways, \ninevitable in the World of Darkness. Dark forces collide and destroy one another. \nPart of the problem here is that a lot of what would be background in a tabletop \ngame (behind-the-scenes strikes by underlings/ lackeys/ ghouls) must be carried \nout by players in live-action. \nYou can’t just stick your head in the sand and say “combat sucks” and hope it \nwon’t happen. Roleplaying is the center of anything we do. But if you leave a \nsection of the rules poorly defined simply because you don’t like it, then it will come \nback to haunt you. \nTehehe. You make me sound like an elitist and that makes me smile. The \nCamarilla wants you to certify plotlines so bullshit like rampant Masquerade- \nbreaches (and I KNOW you have a massive problem with that, to the point that \na justicar threatened to kick you out of the Camarilla if they weren’t stopped), \n"

      "text": "unrealistic gaming (your disproportionate number of Kindred, your Nosferatu \nprince, your propensity for including wererats, werespiders and lots of other \nrare creatures into your game), and general stupidity. \n1) We,asStorytellers,sentanarchon(notajusticar) \ninto thegame inthelast session. \n2 )  ( h e  of the things that makes Athens by Night an exciting and interesting \ngame is the fact that we break out of the form that every other Vampire LARP has \nset. How many times can you come into a seven-clan game with a Ventrue prince and \nlittle or no outside supernatural presence (which seems to be stock-in-trade for every \nother LARP in the whole wide world) and not get bored? \nWe’re an alternative. Part of being an alternative is doing things differently. \nOnce word of Steve and Daniel’s argument got out to the greater Athens by \nNight e-mail list, others registered their opinions. \n1’11 jump in here: \nThe point of a LARP is just that: to roleplay in live action. Period. The \npurpose is not to “beat shit up” (I’ll say this once again as you ignored it the first \ntime. If it were, you would be right. Since it is not, I am right. \nThe purpose [of Athens by Night] is not just to roleplay. Ifwe wanted that, we \nwould conduct a play. [ABN] is a game, as well as a roleplaying event. The goal is \nto balance the roleplaying and game aspects. This is hard, and different LARPs \nstrike a different balance. But that doesn’t make one LARP more “right” than \nanother. \nIt’s just different, that’s all. \nRichard Coleman \nI \nAnd so did others. \n[Mister Bond], \nRoleplaying is almost entirely based on the non-rules related aspects of the game. \nWhether the rules say I must play Rock-Paper-Scissors to do challenges, or play entire \ngames of Monopoly to do so, I can roleplay whatever I desire. I can be asmarmy Ventrue \ncar dealer or I can be a pissy, stupid Scottish kilt-wearin’ Brujah. \n... ( and thus the entire purpose of LARP.. . which contrary to popular belief \nis NOT to “beat shit up”) ... \nPurpose of a LARP? Who says so... Yahweh? What if in the course of \nroleplaying, I decide to beat shit up? Am I not allowed? It’s my shit, after all. \nBesides, being Camarilla-certified is no guarantee of being an intelligent roleplayer. \nRoleplaying (and rules-mongering) is in the individual player, not the rules. The \nMasquerade Second Edition and Laws of the Night are each twice the length of \nAIT’s rules [AIT is another independent LARP run in Atlanta], and I know we \nare at least neck and neck with ABN. If you need your rules to be custom tailored \nas your roleplayingcrutch, feel free to find agame that suits you. Meanwhile, I don’t \ntell the Iranians how to run their country.. . because I don’t live there and they \ndon’t directly affect any of my interests.

He has developed Mind’s Eye \nTheatre, Wraith: The Oblivion and Vampire: \nThe Dark Ages. Watchfor this column to showcase \nRich’s unique insight, wit, observations on life in \ngeneral, and (should we be so lucky) his views on \nMind’s Eye Theatre development. In his first col- \numn, Rich relates the tak of how Mind’s Eye came \ninto its current incamtion. \nCHAPTER \nONE: YOUR \nLAWS, \nMY TRICEPS \nIt all started because my arm got tired. Honest. I couldn’t make this stuff up if I wanted to. \nItwasNovember, 1995. I’d just come on board as the developer for Wraith: The Oblivion \nandMind’s Eye Theatre, and I was about to get shipped off to my first convention appearance. \nThe place: Kansas City. The convention: Shauncon. The reason I was there: I was the first \ndeveloper our con-support guy saw (the others having heard his ominous footsteps and gone \nto ground until he had seized another victim. Picture the dinosaur sequence in Fantasia - \nthe \none in which the stegosaurus gets it in the neck - \nand you’ve pretty much got the idea). \nThe folks at Shauncon were very friendly and helpful, and they got in touch with me well \nbefore the event to see what I’d be interested indoing, what I’d like to see, and so on; they were \nperfect hosts. As part of that conversation, they mentioned that they had a long-running \nMasquerade game, a chapter of which would take place at the convention, and that they’d \nwritten a special-guest part that they’d love to have me play. So if I could just see my way clear \nto popping into character for a few hours Saturday night.. .. \n“Sure,” I said. “It sounds great! Let me know what sort of character it is, so I can bring \nappropriate costuming.” \nWell, that’s what I said out loud. Internally, I was screaming. “What are you doing? What \nif you make a mistake? You’we newer played anything besldes a Tor& \nwith a goofy accent! What \nif you screw up - \nthey’ll lose all respect for you and the product line! AAAAAGGHHHH!” \n(Mind you, this whole thing took place before I was informed that White Wolfdevelopers \nare supposed to spend conventions drunk and surly at hotel bars, as opposed to playing in games. \nI have since had my misapprehension corrected and can now be found at most major \nconventions sitting in the corner of the local watering hole, guzzling various unidentifiable \nfluids and channeling my inner black-clad hooligan. He likes Amaretto Sours and Purpom hard \ncider, in case you feel like bribing him.) \nSo I fortified myself for the potentially traumatic experience. Armed with the proper \nequipment ( IO-foot pole, a dozen iron spikes, 50 feet of rope and a .22 automatic), I descended \ninto the “Out of Print” pile in the warehouse in hopes of excavating a copy of the Players Kit. \nWhy? Because I was going to be playing a Giovanni - \nand at the time we had no rules for \n"

      "text": "playing Giclvanni in print. Oops. “This is probably something I should rectify,” I said to myself, \neven as I hacked my way through the tentacled nasties who guarded the piles ofbooks I needed. \nEmerging victorious, I sat down in my office with my prize and a copy of Masquerade 2nd \nEdition (not to mention Antagonists and, for some unknown reason, The Book of Props) and \nstarted reading. My goal was to memorize every single word of all of those books before I got on \nthe plane for Kansas City. So I read. And I read. And then I read some more. My e-mail account \nclogged. My mailbox overflowed. Dirty dishes in my sink at home began breathing, developed \nlanguage skills and voted to secede from my apartment. In the end, though, it was worth it - \nI managed to get every single word of those suckers down. I was a walking encyclopedia of rules \nknowledge. Headheldhigh, I tookmyseaton theaircraft, settled inwithaThomasLigottishort- \nstory collection, and let the friendly skies convey me to where I was going. \nAnd somewhere over Tennessee, I managed to forget every blessed word I’d read. \nSo, to make a long story short (too late, I know), I arrived safely in KC, but as a virtual \ntabula rasa of live-action information. The game rolled around. I did the only thing I could. \nI tucked the entire MET library under my arm for reference, muttered a swift prayer and went \noff to play. (No one really needs to hear about the steakhouse meeting with the vegetarian \nwho’d thrown his front door onto the fireplace for warmth, the funky chickeneers at the \nwedding next door, the bar band‘s salsa-flavored rendition of Van Morrison’s Greatest Hits, \nor about the half-dozen or so gamers whom I found strewn across my hotel room, asleep, \nSaturday morning. Caveat: I’d never met any of them before, I haven’t seen any of them \nsince, I have no idea what any of their names were, and the only concrete fact I have about \nthe matter was the knowledge that at least three of them snored like a goddamned bandsaw \nfactory on swing shift.) \nFive hours later, I was back in my hotel room with one noticeable difference. (Okay, \ntwo - \nI’d cleaned the gamers out.) My right arm, the one I’d used to carry the books, was \nabout two inches longer than the left, and it felt like someone had emphatically and \nrepeatedly mistaken it for a large, pinkish piece of linguine. Oh, the game had gone well - \nI’d wandered into town, made my introductions, acquired the ridiculously powerful magical \nwhosits that I was supposed to remove from play, mucked with a few of the more uppity \nplayers and then strolled off into the night. My mission was accomplished, my work was \ndone, and I’d managed to avoid being asked any questions I couldn’t answer. \nBut boy, was my arm tired. The longer I sat there thinking about it, the more I realized \nthat the situation simply wasn’t satisfactory. The books were heavy and awkward, and they \nsimply looked out of place next to costuming. Players who had made the investment in \ntuxedos or evening gowns, or even just the investment of time and effort to look right for \ntheir characters, deserved better than to be weighted down with a stack of 8.5-by-1 I-inch \ngreen books. The old format was simply too obtrusive, and it did too much to shatter the \ngame’s illusion. \nBesides, my arm was tired. I had no intention of ever lugging that many books around \nfor that long in that heavy a jacket again. (Costuming note for all you would-be Giovanni \nout there: Black‘s a great color for dressing up, but when the only black clothes you have are \nwool, it’s okay to vary things a little. Even in November. Trust me.) \nSo I started thinking. Problem#l was that the books were physically awkward. Problem \n#2 was that necessary material wasn’t available to players. Problem #3 was that, and I have \nto be honest here, the rules didn’t work terribly well. (Yeah, I know, they’re still not perfect, \nbut we’re trying here. Honest.) Scattered over three books and two editions, drawn from \ndozens of sources, the rules often contradicted one another, making it necessary for folks to \ntote around hundreds of pages worth of Photoshop-bespangled reference material. \n"

      "text": "Something clearly had to be done. So Sunday night, I sat down with the two gentlemen who \nran the game I’d played in, and over friendly conversation, I floated the idea. “What would you \nguys think,” I said -“and this is just an idea, mind you - \nof a pocket-sized rulebook for Mind’s \nEye Theatre? None of the storytelling material, minimal background - \njust the rules in a size \nthat you could carry with you and that you could tuck into a pocket when you weren’t using it.” \nFor what it’s worth, they liked the idea. I can’t tell you exactly what they said (partially \nbecause I’m not sure I can quote it accurately, partially because the things I can remember to \nquote accurately aren’t necessarily printable in a family roleplaying journal), but they liked it. \nIf they hadn’t, I probably would have scrapped the whole idea and gone back to figure out how \nmany curls I would have needed to do in order to prep for the next game. But armed with a \nmandate from folks who were elbow-deep in the game, and who knew what they needed to \nmake their games run more smoothly, I could go back home and set up the project (that is, after \nthe incident with the massive hangover, the Star Wars‘ line designer, the ship’s bell and the \napproximately 4000 miniatures). \nIttookawhile, andit tooksomeconvincing.The ideaofapocketguide-justrules, nothing \nelse - \nwas so contrary to what we’d done before that some folks were skeptical of it. I knew the \nidea was a good one, though, and once I noted to People in High Places that we wouldn’t be \nincurring any new writing costs on the book, I got the green light. That’s when the fun started. \nInitially, the idea of the book was simply to cut and paste the rules files from the old books \ninto the new one. It would be easy, fast and useful - \nand it would save my sanity, because I was \nworking on Wraith 2nd Edition at the same time. Unfortunately, this simple plan ran into a few \nsnags. First of all, the files for the Players Kit were nowhere to be found. While I could do without \nthe print specs for the blood capsules that were included in the original box, I did sort of need the \nfiles for the lesser clans, their Disciplines and all of the other crunchy goodness that needed to go \ninto the book. Eventually the diskette with the required files turned up. (If I remember correctly, \nit was in the Marketing department, filed with the details of the White Wolf Microbrewery idea \nthat thankfully never got off the ground, and was labeled “I Gotcher Barney DoomWADs Right \nHere.” But I could be mistaken.) Pulling up the files led to problem number two: They were amess. \nI mean, I knew there were a few discrepancies between The Masquerade and the Vampire \nPlayers Guide, but once I started digging in, I realized that more work was needed. A lot more \nwork. As a matter of fact, so much work was needed that I had no idea where to start. There \nwas only one thing to do: Go back to the source. \nI bundled myselffor the Atlanta winter (yep, that meant a longsleeve shirt and jeans) and \nheaded off to the Red Light Caf6, where the local Vampire LARP crowd hung out on Tuesday \nnights. I sat down at a table and snagged random passersby, asking them what they felt needed \nchanging; scoping out which rules needed to be cleaned up or explicated better. \nHoo boy, did I get anearful. Three hours later, I staggeredoutunder theweightofmynotes. \nThen, masochist that I am, I fired up the computer and asked the same questions offriends who \nplayed MET all over the continent. The response was avalanche-like in its volume, intensity \nand ambient temperature. People had a lot of concerns. Even worse, a great many of those \nconcerns and proposed fixes contradicted each other. It was hopeless. So I did what any sane \nman would do in that sort of situation. I screamed for help. \nHelp arrived in the form of Editrix (no, that’s not a dirty word, and get your minds out of \nthe gutter, you filthy-headed brutes) Cynthia Summers, whose experience with actual Mind’s \nEye gameplay dwarfed mine, and who had long since set herself up as the Cerberus of MET. \nNothing that saw print for the line escaped her baleful gaze - \nwhich was a good thing for me. \nWe sat down with the old files, copious notes, e-mails and a healthy supply of caffeinated \n"

      "text": "beverages, and we decided which changes needed to be made, whose ideas for fixes were worth \nfollowing up on, and whom we were going to pummel senseless when the process was all over. \nI also had the unenviable task ofdecidingprecisely what material went into the book. The \nbasic clans and Disciplines? They had to be in there. The Sabbat? Sort of a necessity, I thought. \nMinor clans and bloodlines? Well, they weren’t available anywhere else. Other Disciplines? If \nthe clans were going to be in there, the appropriate rules had to be as well. Background? At least \nsome, for new players just picking up the book. The basics of the game? Indubitably. A little \nbit ofcommon-sense warning? A necessity, in light of all the rumbles about PTAs and religious- \nwatchdog groups hassling MET games. A FAQ? Considering the number of changes we’d \nmade, it sort of had to go in there. \nYou see how books get big, fast? Suddenly a 50,000-wordcut-and-paste job had turned into \na 110,000-word monstrosity. Some things got cut out of the draft - \nthere was no choice if we \nwanted it to fit between two covers- but still, it remained a towering, imposing pile of verbiage. \nA month or so later, a manuscript emerged. With much fanfare and other goofiness, it \nwent through the copy-editing process - \nmultiple times - \nand eventually emerged into the \nlight of Production and layout. \nThose ofyou with long memories might note that Laws of the Night was the first of the MET \nbooks to not have acover adorned with photographs and Photoshop. Rather, the book‘s cover has \na subdued gray marble background and little else - \njust logos (which are something of a design \nnecessity). That was deliberate. The idea (hashed out in many discussions with the talented Mr. \nLarry Snelly and Ms. Katie McCaskill, who laid out the book) was to create a book that acharacter \ncould carry - \nor even open - \nduring play, without having it look like, well, a game book. \nHopefully, we could put the rules in something that the most foppish Toreador or the most staid \nTremere wouldn’t feel awkward about whipping out in the midst of heavy roleplaying. \nDigression: I consider the illusion of the game world to be one of the most important \naspects of gameplay. I’m a big fan of deep immersion; every time a test goes off or dice hit the \ntable, it’s a forcible reminder that you are Just Playing A Game. I like my illusions, and I like \nthem with as little duct tape holding them together as possible. That means if I have to check \na rule during gameplay, I want to do so in a way that seems like part of the action. Ergo, the book \nthat gets pulled out for that check should look like an in-play prop, something my character \nwould have naturally. \nThat wasn’t the end of it, not by a long shot. The book was too long, which meant that \neven more material had to be cut or squeezed - \nKatie did heroic work shrinking headers, \nsmooshing sidebars and annexing borders so that everything that was vital would fit. Suddenly, \nfrom what had been a jumble, there emerged a book. \nFor all of its flaws - \nand I know the book has them, thank you- \nit does what it was intended \nto: It makes looking rules up in gameplay easier; it addresses the concerns of the people who helped \npoke at it. Most of all, it’s useful. \nAnd that, after all, is what I was after from the very beginning. \n"

The woman who had been hawing those terrible headaches.. .? \nThe forbidden experiments of the Tremere were not the only magical works \nto produce results. In the early days of the True Hand, a subsect of mages obsessed \nwith the secrets of death and the afterlife bent their collective will toward \nunderstanding vampirism. At last, convinced that their research granted them the \npower to manipulate the vampiric curse to their own ends, they conducted a great \nceremony to strike the life from their bodies and become undead forever. \nThe Nagaraja still exist, and they continue to study and develop the secrets \nof death and what lies beyond. Their command of necromantic arts is rivaled only \nby that of the Giovanni, and the Flesh Eaters have some secrets that not even the \nupstart Necromancers have discovered. Without the True Hand, the Nagaraja is \na directionless and dying bloodline; whether it survives the coming reckoning or \nfalls to the paranoid waltz of the Jyhad remains to be seen. \nClan Disciplines: Auspex, Dominate, Necromancy \nAdvantage: Instead of practicing the forms of Necromancy pioneered by the \nGiovanni, the Nagaraja use Vitreous Necromancy (sometimes called “Nihilistics”) \n- \na special path concerned with the energies of death and decay. Should your \ngame include the additionalNecromancy powers fromvampire, the Nagaraja use \nAsh Necromancy and are capable of learning Vitreous Necromancy after attain- \ning expertise to an Intermediate level. Otherwise, use Vitreous Necromancy as \ntheir primary Necromancy path, giving them access to unusual abilities unknown \nto other clans and bloodlines. Because of their sensitivity to the energies of the \ndead, Nagaraja can automatically sense the presence of any wraiths in their \nvicinity (about lofeet), although they cannot necessarily see or identify particular \nwraiths (at least, not without AshNecromancyor the Merits: Ghostsight or Speaker \nwith the Dead). \nDisadvantage: In addition to drinking blood, the Nagaraja must consume \nhuman flesh. A Nagaraja must devour two health levels’ worth of flesh each day, \npreferably fresh. A normal human corpse is considered to have three servings of \n“the other white meat.” Vampiric flesh will not do, as it rots and decays once it is \ndevoured. ANagaraja who fails to “get his pound of flesW’gains theNegative Trait: \nSickly for eachnight offasting; theseTraits disappear iftheNagarajalater consumes \nadditional flesh (one serving for each Trait). \nNagaraja have no special capacity for eating food other than raw flesh, unless \nthey take the Merit: Eat Food. \nI N C L U D I N C ~ T H E  \nNAC~ARAJAIN \nYOUR CHRONICLE \nAs a bloodline of perhaps adozen members from avampiric society now nearly \ndestroyed, the Nagaraja would seem to have limited potential for use as characters. \nWith the extent of the True Hand’s influence in vampiric society, though, such is \nhardly the case.

Obviously, other necromancers are \nthe most likely to know of the Nagaraja; the Giovanni family in particular considers \nthe Nagaraja a nuisance, but still casts a jealous eye toward the bloodline’s secrets. For \ntheir part, the Nagaraja take an interest in the larger movements of Kindred society. \nAny seemingly insignificant political or social change within either Camarilla or \nSabbat could conceal the maneuvers of the ancients; such chess matches draw the \nattention of the True Hand and its members. Without the safety of any secure haven \nor widespread allies, the Nagaraja must travel where their studies and needs take them \n- \nand so one or even two may appear just about anywhere, if only briefly. \nDue to their scarcity, Nagaraja shouldn’t arrive in a chronicle in droves. Rather, \nthey are harbingers of terrible portents, foreshadowing the schemes of ancient \nvampires playing in the Jyhad. Too much an unknown quantity to be actively \npersecuted, the Nagaraja are largely an enigma to the more common clans. \nPossible ideas for adding Nagaraja to your chronicle include: \nNagaraja follow up on hidden or lost necromantic secrets with an almost \nreligious fanaticism. A character unearthing an unusual bit of occult lore may \nattract the attention of a Nagaraja. \nThe movements of the ancients always draw the attention of the Tal’mahe’Ra. \nA Nagaraja agent may use his necromantic abilities to investigate unusual \nconspiracies or hidden influence in a city. \nSince veryfew Nagaraja exist-and \nas they are not exactly protected by the \nsheltering arms of the Camarilla or Sabbat - \nit makes sense for them to seek out \nplaces to hide, or allies on whom they can depend. A single Nosferatu contact or \na Brujah bodyguard can go a long way toward making unlife safer and more \nproductive, and the Nagaraja aren’t above making such contacts surreptitiously. \nWith their small bloodline size, Embracing potential recruits seems like a valid \nstrategy for Nagaraja. Of course, educating a brand-new vampire and teaching her to \navoid notice, unearth the secrets of unlife and defend against potential threats is a risky \nundertaking, so the Nagaraja seek out only the most talented and intelligent recruits. \nA mentor-student team might seek shelter with a small group of neonates or ancillae, \nso that the fledgling Flesh Eater can adjust to her new condition in relative security. \nThe forbidding workings of Vitreous Necromancy can be used to sense and \nmanipulate the dark energies ofentropy, decay and death. Formerly called “Nihilistics,” \nthis type of Necromancy is practiced almost exclusively by the now-vanished \nNagaraja bloodline. Other necromancers would give much to unearth this Discipline’s \nsecrets, for it is a powerful adjunct to the ability to control the Restless. Its true \ncapabilities, however, lie buried with its makers in the realm of the True Black Hand. \nV I  \nT R E o u s NE c R o M A N  CY \nB A S I C  \nEyes of the Dead \nTapping into the flow of death energy, you can see through the eyes of any \nwraiths who happen to be around you.

Then I can get buck to my real studies. \nAccording to the legends of the Kindred, the Brujah clan hails from the \nlineage of Troile, an upstart who diablerized the original Brujah Antediluvian. \nThough Troile stole the ancient’s power, he failed to usurp the entirety of the \nbloodline, and to this day several very old and very cunning descendants of the \noriginal Antediluvian are rumored to exist. Following the tradition of scholarship \nhanded down through their bloodline, the survivors’ logical minds and keen \nintellects focused on the acquisition of knowledge and the finer points of philoso- \nphy; their calm, rational natures led to a reputation as legendary thinkers and \nkeepers of wisdom. In addition to this wisdom, the True Brujah honed a keen sense \nof perception, leading them to develop unparalleled political machinations and an \nuncannv sense of history. Originally founding members of the True Black Hand, \nthe True Bruj ah - \nif, indeed, any remain - \nare said to control the perceptions of \ntime and even, among the eldest, the currents of the ages. \nA keen grasp of philosophy makes for a well-honed mind, but not necessarily an \nunderstanding or moral one. Indeed, the True Brujah as a whole left behind human \nmorality centuries before. In their quest for knowledge and their search for perfection \nof the mind, they delved into much forbidden lore. Bent to the purity of developing \nPlatonic ideals, they did not recognize the dangers of consorting with infernalists, and \nthey welcomed rites and sacraments most foul. With the patience of timesight and a \ndrive unfettered by emotions or morality, the True Brujah brought about their own \ndoom at Carthage and other places.

The victim is entranced, \ncarrying on his action long after he intended to stop. An individual taking a walk, \nfor instance, continues walking even after he has overshot his destination; a victim \ntrying to run away becomes so intent upon fleeing that he keeps trying to run even \nafter he has been captured. \nSystem: You must make a Social Challenge against the target to use this \npower. Once activated, the subject automatically attempts to repeat the same \naction performed in the current turn in the next turn. Thus, in the next turn, the \nvictim repeats what he was doing previously, as long as the action is repeatable. A \ncharacter who picks up a book, for instance, cannot be made to try to pick up the \nsame book once he’s already holding it; in the presence of several books, though, \nhe could be made to pick up an additional book. \nI N T F R M E D I A T F  \nZombie’s Curse \nWarping a target’s perception of time, you can make the victim take longer \nto do anything. The subject slows down, moving as if smothered in molasses, and \nhe has difficulty reacting to things happening at “normal speed.” \nSystem: You must engage in a Social Challenge with your victim in order to \naffect her perception of time. If successful, the subject is slowed for the next 15 \nseconds (four turns). A slowed victim may still use weapons and powers, but her \nactions always come after everyone else’s, and she may have difficulty in combat.

In effect, you are free to move for one turn - \ngenerally, to \na distance of three steps. However, if you can get out of reach of your opponent or find \na suitable hiding place, you may be able to use this power for a Fair Escape. You can also \nattack from surprise by using this power in combat, at least the first time you “blink.” \nADVANCED \nFrozen Object \nYou can literally warp the fabric of time around an object, causing it to exist \nin a pocket outside the flow of the seconds. Such an object retains any energy or \nproperties that it had when frozen, but it cannot be affected by interactions from \n:he normal time stream. As a result, you can throw a knife and then leave it in mid- \niir, or halt time for a grenade thrown at you long enough to escape. \n"

Although you \ndo not need to touch the item, you must be able to see it, and it cannot be in the \npossession of another individual. Therefore, you can freeze a knife, a bomb or a \nfalling object, but unless you have some means of seeing a bullet (such as by \nstepping outside time with the Cowalker power), you cannot affect it. Frozen \nobjects retain their energy but cannot interact with the physical world; thus, a \nthrown knife resumes flying once this power elapses, but it cannot be plucked from \nthe air while frozen. Activating this Discipline requires the expenditure of one \nPhysical Trait. \nMASTER \nControl Aging \nYou can alter the effects of time upon a particular subject. With a touch, you can \nrapidly speed up, slow down or even reverse the accumulation of time in your target. \nSystem: You must grasp your target physically in order to control time’s effects \nupon it; this may require al’hysical Challenge in the case of unwilling subjects. The \nobject can be no larger than roughly man-sized - \ngenerally, 500 pounds or so is \nthe upper limit. You must then expend one Physical Trait for each decade that you \nwish to add to or subtract from the victim’s age.

Once this \npower is used on a given individual, it may not be used again on the same subject \nin the same game session. \nDomain of Evernight \nBy dilating the perceived flow of time around yourself, you can make it appear \nthat time has sped up incredibly. Everyone in the area - \nincluding you - \nexperiences a highly altered flow of time. This power can be used to great effect \nwhen defending a haven, by causing night to come with rapidity or by exposing \nvampiric foes to daylight. \nSystem: This power affects only a single room at a time. You must win a Static \nMental Challenge (difficulty seven Traits) to cause one hour of time to pass in the \nspace of a single turn (about five seconds of real time or so, when not in combat). \nYou must have a Narrator present in order to use this power; all events in the given \nroom are taken “out of location” as the area steps outside of the normal time stream. \nThose who step into the area are immediately included in the perception- \ndistorting effects. If a room is affected with this power, those inside cannot return \nto the normal flow of the game until outside time “catches up” with their perceived \ntime frame. \nFor example, if Laocrines the True Brujah activates this power in a side room \nat seven o’clock, he can make a Mental Challenge to cause everyone in the area \nto experiencedilated time for an hour (althoughsubjectively the inhabitants ofthe \nroom experience only a single turn). No one who enters the room or is in the area \nof effect can leave the room until eight o’clock outside. \nDue to the potential disruptiveness of this power (possibly causing several \nplayers to wait for an hour or more before returning to play), Storytellers should \nexercise extreme caution in allowing its use in their games. \nE N OC  H IAN MYSTICISM \ne \n"

The cost is the same \nas for any Master-Level Discipline, however this level of Thaumaturgy does not impart any \nadditional powers; it simply allows the character to learn these closely guarded rituals. \nWe recommend that Storytellers require characters to pursue research into these rituals \nin-game (through the use of Influences and Abilities) to represent the rarity of this class of \nblood magic.

Many had died in the night, and those left had suffered griewously. \n“I want you to know,” the Fang continued, seeming to sag a bit where he stood, \nthough his voice picked up speed, “that you hawe done me aserwice as well. You hawe taken \ncare of those who would have been my greatest riwals. For that I will sing your praises. ” \nThe others raised confused eyebrows at that, but the Silver Fang only smiled and took an \nillustrious bow. The sky lightened in the east. When the Fang tumd, his skin was lined with even \nmore wrinkles than it had been a moment ago. His brow was heawy with concern, or so it seemed. \n“And now I go to rest , ” he said, suddenly full of life despite his appearance. \nHe raised his a m  in a fluid motion and shrugged mightily. With a sound like a sheet \ntearing, he stepped back and sloughed off the outer layer of his skin. Now, standing before \nthe remaining Garou was a thin, pale man with a long black ponytail and a vicious smik. He \nbowed again, stepped back into the s M w  of the trees and disappeared with the skin of \nKnows-His-Words danglingraggedfrom his hand. Before the Garou could rouse themselwes \nto give chase, they heard a sound like laughter in the forest surrounding the caem. All around \nthem, wague, twisted shapes clawed and squirmed out of the Umbra and crept closer.. . . \nThis potent ritual allows a vampire to actually become a Lupine for one \nevening. The material component is a cloak made from the skin of a werewolf. The \ntribe to which the vampire “belongs” depends upon the type of skin used in the \nritual; Auspice is always Theurge. \nWhile the ritual imparts the form of a Lupine, it does not bestow the vampire \nany Gifts, Rites or knowledge of how to act like a Garou. It behooves the vampire \nto have at least one level of Garou Lore before attempting this ritual. \nRequirements \nThe vampire must chant over the ill-gotten Lupine skin for an hour-and-a-half \nwhile sprinkling his own blood around it. At the end of that time, the vampire dons \nthe cloak, which fuses to his own skin for the remainder of the evening. Once this \nprocess is complete, the vampire becomes (for all intents and purposes) a Lupine. The \ncloak separates from the vampire at sunrise, and may be reused, although the ritual \nmust be repeated each time the vampire wishes to become a werewolf thereafter. \nSystem \nUpon completion of the ritual, the player engages in a Static Mental \nChallenge versus 14 Traits to determine if the ritual is successful. \nThe player needs to create a werewolf character and identity using his vampire \nas a basis. The Lupine is subject to all the advantages and limitations of a normal \nGarou. It may change forms and it is vulnerable to silver. \nThe werewolf begins with two Rage for each Beast Trait that the caster \npossesses, and one Gnosis. The player may attempt to raise these ratings asa normal \nLupine would. \nIf the caster reuses the cloak, the player must engage in a Simple Test to see \nif the skin is still viable for the ritual. \nThe Garou Gift: Scent of True Form detects that there is something amiss \nabout the “werewolf,” but it gives no specifics. \nThe Garou Gift: Sense Wyrm detects Wyrm-taint if the vampire possess more \nthan two Beast Traits. \nUnless the character has some level of the Ability: Garou Lore, he finds it nigh \nimpossible to interact with Garou society. \n"

This piece, in particular, serves as a look at how derangements driwe characters to \ndangerous, thoughtless deeds, yet can sometimes serwe to make them all too human. \nThe mother grabbed her daughter by the collar a bit too roughly and pulled her \nclose. People pressed in on all sides, crowding to get on the trains that would take them \naway from the war-blighted countryside to one of the ghetto-towns. The mother feared \nlosing her daughter in the crowd. They had been marched to the train yard days away \nfrom their home, and not once had the woman let her daughter out ofher sight. The girl \ntold her mother that she was supposed to get on a different train, but the mother didn’t \nlisten. She stoically led her daughter to her own train- the trainshe should be boarding \nwith her husband and son - \ndetermined that she would keep the girl with her. \nDmitri, the father, had to fight. He had to demand that the soldiers leave them alone. \nThe soldiers took the boy first; a soldier shot him through the head as Dmitri stared in mute \nhorror. Dmitri fell next as his wife and daughter looked on. It all happened so fast that the \nmother had no chance to do anything before the soldiers restrained her. They would \nprobably have killed Dmitri anyway, but if he hadn’t tried to fight them, perhaps.. .. \nNow, the mother would not be left alone. She clamped a vise-like hand on her \ndaughter’s shoulder and moved toward her own train. She would not raise her coming \nunborn child alone. The soldiers would not tell them why they were being herded and \nprodded. They were not even Jewish as many of the shouting, jeering soldiers seemed \nto think, but there seemed to be no reason other than random chance why she and her \ndaughter should be split up. Perhaps if she got her daughter onto the train with her \nbefore the soldiers noticed.. . . \nA sharp blow to the back sent the mother sprawling, dragging her daughter to \nthe ground with her. She turned to see a soldier towering over her with his rifle \nupraised, his body silhouetted in the last red rays of sunset. He shouted at her in his \nlanguage that sounded like barking dogs, then pointed at the girl. The mother \nclutched her daughter tighter with one hand and put the other to her stomach. \nThe soldier brought the rifle stock down on her again, sending screaming \nwhite non-images through her brain. He shouted and pointed again, looking even \nmore like a barking dog, his billowing winter-breath like an enraged canine’s froth. \nOthers of his pack gathered around, pushing back people who tried to see what was \ngoing on. One of the soldiers grabbed the woman’s daughter and tried to pull her \nto her feet. The girl clutched more tightly to her mother. \nA N Y  MOTHER’S CHILD \n@ \n"

The mother could not tell. \nv\nr\n \nThe woman almost catches the lone girl, but the orphan is clever and eludes \ncapture. The woman looks in trashdumpsters andglances occasionally at creaking fire \nescapes, but the girl is nowhere to be found. Surely she does not think that the woman \nwould hurt her? She only wants to take care of the child. To give her a home and family \nagain. To protect her. This is no place to be alone. \nv\nv\n \nThe mother awoke in a cold tent with a bandage above her left eye and a \nfrightening soreness beneath her stomach. She heard the muted sound of the \nsoldiers’ barking outside, and she could see that the sun had long since set. The air \nstill smelled like crowds and machine oil, so she knew she was in the train yard, but \nshe wondered why she had not been packed unconscious onto one of the trains. \nThe woman lifted her head stiffly and looked around for her daughter. The girl \nwas not in the tent. Perhaps that was why the woman had not been moved. Maybe \nher daughter had been sent on ahead. Alarmed, the woman called out the girl’s name. \n“She has not been harmed,” a voice assured her in broken Polish. “She is \nwaiting. Calm yourself.” \nThe woman turned, sore muscles protesting, to find a tall soldier slouching just \ninside the tent flap. He wore a long leather coat, belted at the waist, with a bent-edged \ncross on a red arm band below his left shoulder. He removed his hat, smoothed his \nclose-cut blond hair and crouched down beside her. Reluctantly, she calmed down. \n“You put up fight,” the man said, his sparkling blue eyes boring into her with \nan unsettling fascination. “Why?” \nCertainly, she hadn’t been the only one to do so.

Her daughter would be \nreturned to her and they would be spared whatever fate awaited those who rode the trains, \nbut they would survive on the mercy of this man. This man with his unsettling eyes. The \nwoman squirmed in the grasp he had on her leg. His hand was unnaturally cold, even in \nthe winter air.

It is not the first time -she has birthed \nmany children who fled her or fell from grace - \nbut each is still heart-breaking in \nits own way. Why must they always go? Why can none of them trust her and stay \nwith her when all she wants to do is protect them and take care of them? Not even \nher friends - \nthose too old to be her children- \nbelieve her capable of this. Why? \nAnd where is the child? Doesn’t she know that the soldiers are out there right \nnow, lying in wait to take her unawares? \nv\nv\n \nThe woman did not see the tall blond man again for several months. The \nmorning after she and her daughter were reunited, a truck full of leering, slavering \nsoldiers arrived and packed them off to an encampment miles from their home. \nWhen they arrived, a kapo - \na rail-thin, balding man who sneered behind the \nbacks of the soldiers, though he treated the prisoners no less roughly - \ntook them \nto a cramped tent behind a ramshackle barracks and ordered them to remain there \nuntil summoned. He spoke only the barking language, but his angry gestures and \nthe short cudgel he was allowed to carry said enough. \nThey stayed, clinging to each other wordlessly, until the kapo returned. He \nordered the mother to stand and follow him, which she did with trembling knees. \nShe whispered to her child to stay in the tent until she came back, and the kapo hit \nher across the mouth. Clamping a powerful hand around her elbow, he dragged her \naway from her child. Her unborn baby gave a feeble kick, and was still. \nThe woman stops and listens to the night wind. The barren street rustles with \ndiscarded litter and scurrying, furtive footsteps, but no one reveals himself in the \ngarish pink-orange of the streetlights. The child is gone, but now someone follows \nthe woman. Faint footsteps begin to grow louder and more distinct, and someone \ncalls her name from a great distance. Panicking, the woman darts away in the \ndirection she last saw the child. She must find the girl before the other one - \nthe \none in pursuit - \ntries to take her. The woman has done too much, suffered too \nmuch, to let anyone take the child now. She hears the crying of a lost and lonely \nsoul, and she homes in on it like an arrow. The child will be safe; she will see to that. \nv\nv\n \nFor the next few months, the woman lived in Hell. Every day, sometimes as many \nas five or six times, the kapo dragged her to yet another of the dog-soldiers to be abused. \nLife so far from the front, in the harsh winter climate, had stoked raging furnaces in the \nsoldiers’ hearts. When there were no men to kill, the woman served as that rage’s only \nvent. Aside from her daughter, she was the only female for miles, and “subhuman” (as \nthey told her she was) or not, she filled a niche. \nIn the first weeks, whenever she came into the presence ofa soldier who had not yet \nseen her, she would beg him to not hurt her. She pleaded on behalf of her unborn child; \nshe cried out of her own fear; she pleaded that if she died, no one would take care of her \ndaughter. Nothing changed the soldiers’ minds. Those who even understood her only \nlaughed or beat her. The woman eventually learned not to beg.

When the baby she was carrying died at the beginning of the \nthird month, she did not even shed a tear, though the pain and anguish wrenched her \ninto an immobile ball for days after the aborted delivery. She watched as the barking \nsoldiers casually tossed the dead thing that should have been a child into a refuse pile, and \nshe did not cry. When she heard the jokes the soldiers made - \nthe most popular one \nasking if the “roadblock” had been cleared - \nshe pretended she did not understand. \nThe only thing that still had any effect on her at all was the safety of her still-living \ndaughter. The girl was 14 and developing quickly for her age. The woman saw how the \nsoldiers leered at her. She commanded her daughter to remain in the filthy, flimsy tent \nthey shared at all costs, lest the soldiers’ glances result in something more serious. The \ndaughter - \nwithdrawing into her own shell of depression, fear and silence - \nalways \nagreed. However, the woman knew that the soldiers were getting tired of having their \nfun with her alone. Soon, she would be the one left behind cowering in the tent when \nthe kapo came. The woman knew she could not allow that. She had only to look at her \ndaughter’s hollow eyes, hear the stifled sobs she tried to hide as they slept on their \nunclean pallet, to know she must protect her child at all costs. \nThe pursuing footsteps are just two comers away as the woman catches up to the \nchild at last. The child sits looking up at her from the darkened front stoop of a \ncondemned tenement building. Her large green eyes stare out from a dirty face, wide \nand dancing in fear. The woman stops her crazed sprint and closes the last distance \nbetween herself and the frightened child at a cautious walk. The child has nowhere \nelse to run, so she huddles into a tight ball, scrawny knees clutched to her frail chest. \nThe woman comes closer slowly, her eyes still alight from the chase. The \nsoldier’s footsteps are near, but she proceeds with caution. If she scares the child \naway, she willsurely flush the frightened thing right into the soldier’s arms. She lifts \nher hands peacefully and speaks. \n“I will not let them harm you, precious one. They are coming, but they will \nnot take you.” \nThe woman’s daughter looked at her with undisguised fear. “What do you mean, \nmother?” Her mother had been sitting quietly for hours since the kapo last returned \nher to the tent. The sun had descended and set, yet the older woman had said nothing. \n‘‘I heard the soldiers laughing as I left their barracks. The kapo will come for \nyou in the morning.” \n“What do you mean?’ the girl whispers. She is too frightened to speak any louder. \n“DO not be afraid,” the woman says, placing a gentle hand on the girl’s dirty \nface and gazing at her with unspeakable pity. “They will not come before you and \nI have finished.” \nM I N D ’ S  \nB Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n4D \n"

Over the months, she had seen the toll such treatment had \ntakenon the older woman. The life had long since vanished from her mother’s eyes. \nThe girl shivered and huddled against the thin fabric of the tent. \n“Don’t be afraid,” her mother said, taking off her dirty, threadbare scarf. “Put this on.” \nThe orphan recoils as the strange woman takes the ancient shawl from around \nher shoulders and places it around the girl’s, but she cannot move away. The \nintensity of the woman’s brown eyes pins her. \n“What’s this for?

She wrapped it twice and laid the ends between the \nvague curves of the girl’s budding breasts. As her daughter sat uncomfortably looking \nat her, the woman held the ends lightly between her fingers. \nv\nv\n \n“You’re scaring me,” the girl says, swallowing and stretching her slender neck \nuncomfortably. She looks past the woman’s shoulder and sees someone come into \nview down the alley.

They can’t \nterrorize me any more, but they know you’re still afraid of them.” \nAt that moment, the girl was more afraid of her mother than any soldier, and \nshe leaned back, trying to put distance between the two of them.

The band on his arm blazed a fierce red, drawing her eyes to the bent-edged \ncross in the center. She was almost glad. \nThe soldier glanced into the tent at the body of the child and cocked a thin \nyellow eyebrow. His blue eyes sparkled with amazement. \n“A relation of yours?’! he asked. His accent was still horrible, but he seemed \nto have acquired a better grasp of Polish.

If any of the characters have Heretic status, they may \nmake Static Mental Challenges to see if they recognize any of the names. A few \nnames might be known to characters with high Hierarchy status. Again, not all of \nthe names should be those of recognized Heretics. However, the names are all those \nof Heretics. \nIf the Circle decides to investigate the names itself, trying to find out what’s \ngoing on, the Heretics should be difficult to find. Should the Circle find any of \nthem, the Heretics attempt to take the box and might well try to send the \ncharacters into Oblivion for “knowing too much.” \nShould the group decide to head to the Hierarchy for help, it’s in for a rough \ntime. Unless one or more of the wraiths has at least two, if not three, Hierarchy \nStatus Traits, the entire group is given the run-around until members explicitly \nrefer to the Heretics by name or show someone the list. The Hierarchy is extremely \nsuspicious: The functionary who sees the Circle takes the box and interrogates the \ncharacters intensely. If the characters play their cards right, the Hierarchy lets \nthem go z but not without setting a nigh-constant watch on them. Clumsy or \nbelligerent roleplaying gets the wraiths in serious trouble: a fight, perhaps, or \nattempts to imprison, enslave or even soulforge them. The trouble should be \nescapable, though, to keep the story moving. \nMAYDAY! \n"

      "text": "ERFQUFNTLY ASKFD \nQUFSTIONS \nThe constant evolution of Mind’s Eye Theatre bnngs new \nanddifferentquestions to thegame. Thismonth, we tacklequestions \nand comments about Laws of Elysium and the elder game, as well \nas a couple ofgeneral Trait questions. \nSend your Mind’s Eye Theatre questions to: \nWhite Wolf \nAttn: Mind’s Eye Theati-eloumal, Frequently AskedQuesaons \n735 Park North Blvd. \nClarkston, GA 30021 \ncarlawhite-wolf. com \nQ In JAWS \nof Elysium, Master-Level Dis- \nciplinesare available to eighth or lower generation \ncharacters. In the tabletop game, vampires get \nthe really powerful Disciplines only if they’re \nseventh generation or lower. What gives? \nA: Some troupes may wish to experiment \nwith the new Master-Level Disciplines without \nadding elder powerhouses to the game - \nfor \nthem, eighth- (or even ninth-) generation Kin- \ndred are good candidates for these powers. \nHowever, if a large game hosts a few true elders \n(seventh or lower generation), it’s generally a \ngood idea to keep the Master Disciplines in the \nhands of those puissant characters. These pow- \ners are supposed to be rare and forbidding, after \nall! The key is to make sure that the Disciplines \nare available if you want to use them, without \nmaking them commonly available to everyone. \nQ. The Thaumaturgy Path of Conjuring says that the vampire can’t summon \nanything larger or heavier than himself, including a LAW rocket, but LAW rockets \naren’t that big. Also, the Permanency power says that Conjured items must be returned \nphysically to their place of origin, when those items are really just created from nothing. \nA: The note about LAW rockets is pertinent to game balance. A conjurer can \ngenerate a stake, a sword or a vial of blood, but some things should be too difficult to \nmake (like high explosives or nuclear weapons). A good rule of thumb is to require the \nconjurer to have enough Abilities to actually build the item in question. Thus, the \nthaumaturge can’t conjure a pistol without a few levels of Repair and Firearms; he needs \na lot of Demolitions and Science to make explosives. Of course, simple items (like \nwooden stakes, metal bars and rocks) can be conjured without any special Abilities. \n"

      "text": "Permanently conjured items are fully real and solid. The confusion here comes \nfrom the fact that mortal Conjuring (see Laws of the Hunt) simply moves objects \nwithout creating things. An object moved with mortal Conjuring must be taken \nback to its place of origin if the conjurer intends to return it. Conversely, an object \ncreated with the Thaumaturgy Path of Conjuring has no “place of origin” since it \nwas created from nothing. \nQ: How come the new Discipline level for Chimerstry looks suspiciously \nlike one of the old ones in Laws of the Night? \nA: Because the minor difference is in motion. Illusions created with Fata \nMorgana (second Basic Chimerstry) cannot move; they are wholly static, though \nthey can affect all of the senses. Illusions made with higher levels ofchimerstry can \nappear to move and interact with their surroundings. \nQ: How come modem gargoyles can’t fly while Dark Ages ones can? \nA: Did we leave that line out? Silly us. Modem gargoyles do have wings, and \nthey can fly. The gargoyle’s flight speed depends on his level of the Visceratika \nDiscipline; each level of the Discipline allows the gargoyle to fly 5 mph. \nQ: Can an Assamite with high levels of Occult Influence use that capacity \nto leam other sects’ rituals to get Thaumaturgy rituals using his Quietus \nDiscipline? \nA: What a strange and convoluted path. No, Quietus is not sufficient to learn \nrituals aside from the special Assamite ones. Thaumaturgy does not allow someone \nto leam Assamite rituals without Quietus, for that matter. \nQ: Are Bladed Hands (from the ritual of the same name) visible? \nA: No. When you invoke Bladed Hands, you become capable of cutting \nthrough things with your hands, but your limbs do not appear to change at all. \nDon’t pick your nose. \nQ: So what’s the real skinny on Spirit Thaumaturgy? According to some sources, \nit works on wraiths. According to others, it’s Umbral spirits. Which one is it? \nA: Spirit Thaumaturgy is designed to contact and control Umbral spirits. Of \ncourse, only tainted spirits would ever deal willingly with a vampire. For the sake of \nexpanding possibilities, Storytellers may allow Spirit Thaumaturgy to function against \nwraiths, but in general that’s the purview of the Necromancy Discipline. \nQ: How come there’s no Master-Level Thaumaturgy in Laws of Elysium? \nA: Well, technically, there isnoMasterLeve1 in the DisciplineofThaumaturgy. \n“What, then-” \nyou may ask, “-is \nthe meaning of the article on page 41 ?” In that \narticle, we use the term Master-Level more as a representative stroke than as a \ntechnical term. A master thaumaturge (like a pontifex, for instance) is more likely \nto have branched out into several different Thaumaturgical paths (or even created \nhis own) rather than perfected one to a higher level. However, there are some \nrituals that are available to only the most trusted, the most wise and the most \nrespected scholars of the clan, and those scholars can be considered thaumaturges \nof the Master Level. \n"

      "text": "Q: OK, so if there are Lasombra antitribu, how come there are no Tzimisce \nuntitribu in Laws of Elysium, just Old Clan Tzimisce? \nA: Because there’s maybe something like one Tzimisce in the Camarilla. \nTzimisce antitribu are about as common as Salubri, and as such their differences \nfrom the main clan can’t be covered by generalities - \nthey are unique and \nextremely bizarre individuals. \nQ: Why didn’t the Ogham Discipline from The Long Night get an extra \nlevel in Laws of Elysium? \nA: Because Ogham is already a dying Discipline in 1198, and its powers are \nlimited. If you are absolutely fired up to have an additional level (perhaps for \nbalance purposes), try this: \nI N S C R I B E  T H E  C U R S E  ( S E C O N D  I N T E R M E D I A T E )  \nThe Lhiannan traces runic glyphs of a foe’s true name on her body, thus gaining \npower over that enemy. You must know your foe’s true name, and you must expend \ntwo Blood Traits to trace the unusual runes. The runes must be visible to the enemy \nin order to function, and you must make a Mental Challenge when you first engage \nyour opponent. The effects of the runes last until the runes are removed or until you \nsuffer two health levels of damage (thus obscuring them). \nYou may choose one of four effects for the runes: affecting the body renders the \nvictim impotent and unable to use Blood Traits; the mind causes the foe to suffer from \nthe Negative Traits: Oblivious x2; the voice makes the target mute; and affecting the \nsoul makes the opponent lose all ties in tests against frenzy. You may use only one rune \nat a time, so you can choose only one effect and impose it against one person. \n(Note: This power causes Ogham to have more Intermediate levels than Basic \nlevels. Such is the curse of trying to learn a dying Discipline - \nit’s hard!) \nQ: What are the Attribute Trait maximums for changelings and wraiths in \nThe Shining Host and Oblivion? \nA: In both cases, a character’s effective age comes into play. Obviously, most \nwraiths and changelings won’t beat up on elder vampires, so their Traits are not always \nas high.. . but an old and experienced character always has other tricks. \nFor changelings, the character’s seeming determines Trait maximums. \nChildlings are limited to 10 Traits in each category except Physical, for which they \ncan have no more than six Traits. Wilders can have up to 12 Traits in each \ncategory, and grumps may have up to 14 Traits in each category. A childling redcap \nwon’t bite any vampires in half, but watch out for elder trolls. \nWraiths are products of self-image. A wraith‘s personal characteristics are a \nreflection of the individual’s internalized self-perceptions. As a result, old wraiths \noften surpass the limits of their meat-bodies, taking themselves to new levels of \nability. Enfants (newly dead wraiths) are limited to 10 (just dead) or 11 (dead for \na few years) Traits in each category. Lemures (fairly old wraiths, maybe a few \ndecades in age) can have up to 12 or 13 Traits, while Gaunts (centuries-old \nwraiths) can have 14 or sometimes even more Traits. Players are unlikely to play \nwraiths older than young Lemures, though. A fair compromise is to allow a wraith \ncharacter to start with a limit of 10 Traits, but to improve to 11 and 12 after six \nmonths and one year of play, respectively. \n"

What’s that, a \nDungeons €4 Dragons knock-off? How obvious can you get?” \nDeciding then that perhaps sword-and-sorcery-type LARPs were not exactly my \nbag, my acquaintances told me that they participated in another game in which all \nconflicts and confrontations were resolved by playing Rock-Paper-Scissors -that \nthere wasn’t so much of the socking-each-other-with-the-padded-pipes business. \nThat type of game seemed a little more my speed, so they loaned me a battered copy \nof Vampire: The Masquerade as “reference material,” and off I went. \nUnfortunately, I fell out of touch with my two erstwhile gamer buddies shortly \nafter returning their book to them, and I didn’t do much roleplaying until college \n(though other friends of mine and I did make our own padded swords and hack at \neach other when the need - \nand our raging, unrequited hormones - \novertook us \nand we had to vent or die). \nIn college, I got a slightly better education in the fine points of tabletop \nroleplaying (“Boy, this When Will You Rage anthology iscool. I wonder what it’s like \nto be one of these werewolves.. ..”), and I discovered a troupe of live-action garners \non campus. I’d actually been in a Vampire tabletop game or two by this point, so \nnaturally I was ready to go. I spent my first couple of live-action games wandering \nfrom character concept to character concept until I happened upon something I \nliked and stuck with it. I was concurrently involved in increasingly more complex \nand mature tabletop roleplaying games, and I was thoroughly hooked by the end \nof my senior year. I loved the World of Darkness, favored Vampire and Werewolf, \nand adored the live-action expression of those two games. \nSo, after college, on a whim, I sent my r6sum6 to White Wolf (among other \npublishing companies across the state) and waited to see if there might be a job for \nme. As luck would have it, my gaming experience (and my preference for White \nWolfs material) complemented my editing skills, and I landed a job as an editor. \nThree short months later, my manager (or Derfishinkanadian, Hew Cliffe, as I call \nhim when he’s well out of earshot) offered me the chance to develop this quarterly. \nIt’s a perfect match, actually. I’ve come a long way from the “How in the world \ncould you have a die with only four sides?“ high schooler to the publisher-gamer I \nam now. Likewise, MET has come a long way from its boxed-set roots. The game \nand its systems will continue to change, and as I grow and change with it, I’ll keep \nyou all up to date. If you have questions, comments, advice, death threats (or pretty \nmuch whatever), let me know. I’m always here, 24 hours aday (though I only answer \ne-mail in an eight-hour block between 9:OO and 5:00), and I’d love to hear from you. \nCarl Bowen \ncarl@white-wolf.com \n\n\nTHF CURRFNT \nTHINKINCj \n\n\nsacrifices roleplaying (and thus the entire purpose of LARP ... which contrary to \npopular belief is NOT to “beat shit up”) for the ability to create characters who are more \ncomplicated than they are in the tabletop games? Why not use some facade of “realism” \n(used in quotes because it is, after all, roleplaying) and get Camarilla-certified so you \ncan be intelligent roleplayers and not absurd rules-mongers? I know lots of great \nunsanctioned games that are good because the roleplaying is good, not because lots of \nbig vampires run around and diablerize each other. \nPaul Daniel Bond \nThe following responses folloru the basic e-mail reply format of cite the \noriginal text aside and arguing point by point. \nMister Bond, \nWhy in the name of all that is (or is not) holy have you adopted this over- \ncomplicated system that sacrifices the roleplaying (and thus the entire purpose \nof LARP ... )? \nSo we should jump on the Mind’s Eye Theatre bandwagon and just say to hell \nwith clearly defined rules? The live-action environment is, if anything, more \ncomplicated than tabletop. It demands a more comprehensive rules system. \nWhy not use some facade of “realism” (used in quotes because it is, after \nall, roleplaying) and get Camarilla-certified so you can be intelligent roleplayers \nand not absurd rules-mongers? \nSo since we’re not in the Camarilla, we’re not cool? \nTalk about complex. I for one don’t want to have to certify my plotlines just \nSteve McDonald - \nAthens by Night Storyteller \nso I can become one with White Wolfs fan club. \nAfter a personal e-mail back from Bond (in bold). \n[Daniel], \nI have played with both the Mind’s Eye Theatre system and our system. I \nunderstand that one of the reasons that Mind’s Eye combat is so poorly defined is \nbecause combat isdiscouraged. I think this is a bad idea, as combat is, in many ways, \ninevitable in the World of Darkness. Dark forces collide and destroy one another. \nPart of the problem here is that a lot of what would be background in a tabletop \ngame (behind-the-scenes strikes by underlings/ lackeys/ ghouls) must be carried \nout by players in live-action. \nYou can’t just stick your head in the sand and say “combat sucks” and hope it \nwon’t happen. Roleplaying is the center of anything we do. But if you leave a \nsection of the rules poorly defined simply because you don’t like it, then it will come \nback to haunt you. \nTehehe. You make me sound like an elitist and that makes me smile. The \nCamarilla wants you to certify plotlines so bullshit like rampant Masquerade- \nbreaches (and I KNOW you have a massive problem with that, to the point that \na justicar threatened to kick you out of the Camarilla if they weren’t stopped), \n\n\nunrealistic gaming (your disproportionate number of Kindred, your Nosferatu \nprince, your propensity for including wererats, werespiders and lots of other \nrare creatures into your game), and general stupidity. \n1) We,asStorytellers,sentanarchon(notajusticar) \ninto thegame inthelast session. \n2 )  ( h e  of the things that makes Athens by Night an exciting and interesting \ngame is the fact that we break out of the form that every other Vampire LARP has \nset. How many times can you come into a seven-clan game with a Ventrue prince and \nlittle or no outside supernatural presence (which seems to be stock-in-trade for every \nother LARP in the whole wide world) and not get bored? \nWe’re an alternative. Part of being an alternative is doing things differently. \nOnce word of Steve and Daniel’s argument got out to the greater Athens by \nNight e-mail list, others registered their opinions. \n1’11 jump in here: \nThe point of a LARP is just that: to roleplay in live action. Period. The \npurpose is not to “beat shit up” (I’ll say this once again as you ignored it the first \ntime. If it were, you would be right. Since it is not, I am right. \nThe purpose [of Athens by Night] is not just to roleplay. Ifwe wanted that, we \nwould conduct a play. [ABN] is a game, as well as a roleplaying event. The goal is \nto balance the roleplaying and game aspects. This is hard, and different LARPs \nstrike a different balance. But that doesn’t make one LARP more “right” than \nanother. \nIt’s just different, that’s all. \nRichard Coleman \nI \nAnd so did others. \n[Mister Bond], \nRoleplaying is almost entirely based on the non-rules related aspects of the game. \nWhether the rules say I must play Rock-Paper-Scissors to do challenges, or play entire \ngames of Monopoly to do so, I can roleplay whatever I desire. I can be asmarmy Ventrue \ncar dealer or I can be a pissy, stupid Scottish kilt-wearin’ Brujah. \n... ( and thus the entire purpose of LARP.. . which contrary to popular belief \nis NOT to “beat shit up”) ... \nPurpose of a LARP? Who says so... Yahweh? What if in the course of \nroleplaying, I decide to beat shit up? Am I not allowed? It’s my shit, after all. \nBesides, being Camarilla-certified is no guarantee of being an intelligent roleplayer. \nRoleplaying (and rules-mongering) is in the individual player, not the rules. The \nMasquerade Second Edition and Laws of the Night are each twice the length of \nAIT’s rules [AIT is another independent LARP run in Atlanta], and I know we \nare at least neck and neck with ABN. If you need your rules to be custom tailored \nas your roleplayingcrutch, feel free to find agame that suits you. Meanwhile, I don’t \ntell the Iranians how to run their country.. . because I don’t live there and they \ndon’t directly affect any of my interests. Why does this seem to bother you so? \nScott McDaniel, Atlanta Interactive Theater \n\n\nF U R T H E R  FUEL \nTwo wery different wiewpoints; two opinions with the same \nanswer. Both say their system leaves the chaff behind andmakes \nway for roleplaying .... What’s your opinion? Are the MET rules \ntoo complicated, oversimplified or just right? How far can we \nreasonably expect you to stretch our “Cjolden Rule” to adapt the \nrules for your setting? How far is too far before you lose the \nroleplaying and Storytelling aspects that make our games what \nthey are?

He has developed Mind’s Eye \nTheatre, Wraith: The Oblivion and Vampire: \nThe Dark Ages. Watchfor this column to showcase \nRich’s unique insight, wit, observations on life in \ngeneral, and (should we be so lucky) his views on \nMind’s Eye Theatre development. In his first col- \numn, Rich relates the tak of how Mind’s Eye came \ninto its current incamtion. \nCHAPTER \nONE: YOUR \nLAWS, \nMY TRICEPS \nIt all started because my arm got tired. Honest. I couldn’t make this stuff up if I wanted to. \nItwasNovember, 1995. I’d just come on board as the developer for Wraith: The Oblivion \nandMind’s Eye Theatre, and I was about to get shipped off to my first convention appearance. \nThe place: Kansas City. The convention: Shauncon. The reason I was there: I was the first \ndeveloper our con-support guy saw (the others having heard his ominous footsteps and gone \nto ground until he had seized another victim. Picture the dinosaur sequence in Fantasia - \nthe \none in which the stegosaurus gets it in the neck - \nand you’ve pretty much got the idea). \nThe folks at Shauncon were very friendly and helpful, and they got in touch with me well \nbefore the event to see what I’d be interested indoing, what I’d like to see, and so on; they were \nperfect hosts. As part of that conversation, they mentioned that they had a long-running \nMasquerade game, a chapter of which would take place at the convention, and that they’d \nwritten a special-guest part that they’d love to have me play. So if I could just see my way clear \nto popping into character for a few hours Saturday night.. .. \n“Sure,” I said. “It sounds great! Let me know what sort of character it is, so I can bring \nappropriate costuming.” \nWell, that’s what I said out loud. Internally, I was screaming. “What are you doing? What \nif you make a mistake? You’we newer played anything besldes a Tor& \nwith a goofy accent! What \nif you screw up - \nthey’ll lose all respect for you and the product line! AAAAAGGHHHH!” \n(Mind you, this whole thing took place before I was informed that White Wolfdevelopers \nare supposed to spend conventions drunk and surly at hotel bars, as opposed to playing in games. \nI have since had my misapprehension corrected and can now be found at most major \nconventions sitting in the corner of the local watering hole, guzzling various unidentifiable \nfluids and channeling my inner black-clad hooligan. He likes Amaretto Sours and Purpom hard \ncider, in case you feel like bribing him.) \nSo I fortified myself for the potentially traumatic experience. Armed with the proper \nequipment ( IO-foot pole, a dozen iron spikes, 50 feet of rope and a .22 automatic), I descended \ninto the “Out of Print” pile in the warehouse in hopes of excavating a copy of the Players Kit. \nWhy? Because I was going to be playing a Giovanni - \nand at the time we had no rules for \n\n\nplaying Giclvanni in print. Oops. “This is probably something I should rectify,” I said to myself, \neven as I hacked my way through the tentacled nasties who guarded the piles ofbooks I needed. \nEmerging victorious, I sat down in my office with my prize and a copy of Masquerade 2nd \nEdition (not to mention Antagonists and, for some unknown reason, The Book of Props) and \nstarted reading. My goal was to memorize every single word of all of those books before I got on \nthe plane for Kansas City. So I read. And I read. And then I read some more. My e-mail account \nclogged. My mailbox overflowed. Dirty dishes in my sink at home began breathing, developed \nlanguage skills and voted to secede from my apartment. In the end, though, it was worth it - \nI managed to get every single word of those suckers down. I was a walking encyclopedia of rules \nknowledge. Headheldhigh, I tookmyseaton theaircraft, settled inwithaThomasLigottishort- \nstory collection, and let the friendly skies convey me to where I was going. \nAnd somewhere over Tennessee, I managed to forget every blessed word I’d read. \nSo, to make a long story short (too late, I know), I arrived safely in KC, but as a virtual \ntabula rasa of live-action information. The game rolled around. I did the only thing I could. \nI tucked the entire MET library under my arm for reference, muttered a swift prayer and went \noff to play. (No one really needs to hear about the steakhouse meeting with the vegetarian \nwho’d thrown his front door onto the fireplace for warmth, the funky chickeneers at the \nwedding next door, the bar band‘s salsa-flavored rendition of Van Morrison’s Greatest Hits, \nor about the half-dozen or so gamers whom I found strewn across my hotel room, asleep, \nSaturday morning. Caveat: I’d never met any of them before, I haven’t seen any of them \nsince, I have no idea what any of their names were, and the only concrete fact I have about \nthe matter was the knowledge that at least three of them snored like a goddamned bandsaw \nfactory on swing shift.) \nFive hours later, I was back in my hotel room with one noticeable difference. (Okay, \ntwo - \nI’d cleaned the gamers out.) My right arm, the one I’d used to carry the books, was \nabout two inches longer than the left, and it felt like someone had emphatically and \nrepeatedly mistaken it for a large, pinkish piece of linguine. Oh, the game had gone well - \nI’d wandered into town, made my introductions, acquired the ridiculously powerful magical \nwhosits that I was supposed to remove from play, mucked with a few of the more uppity \nplayers and then strolled off into the night. My mission was accomplished, my work was \ndone, and I’d managed to avoid being asked any questions I couldn’t answer. \nBut boy, was my arm tired. The longer I sat there thinking about it, the more I realized \nthat the situation simply wasn’t satisfactory. The books were heavy and awkward, and they \nsimply looked out of place next to costuming. Players who had made the investment in \ntuxedos or evening gowns, or even just the investment of time and effort to look right for \ntheir characters, deserved better than to be weighted down with a stack of 8.5-by-1 I-inch \ngreen books. The old format was simply too obtrusive, and it did too much to shatter the \ngame’s illusion. \nBesides, my arm was tired. I had no intention of ever lugging that many books around \nfor that long in that heavy a jacket again. (Costuming note for all you would-be Giovanni \nout there: Black‘s a great color for dressing up, but when the only black clothes you have are \nwool, it’s okay to vary things a little. Even in November. Trust me.) \nSo I started thinking. Problem#l was that the books were physically awkward. Problem \n#2 was that necessary material wasn’t available to players. Problem #3 was that, and I have \nto be honest here, the rules didn’t work terribly well. (Yeah, I know, they’re still not perfect, \nbut we’re trying here. Honest.) Scattered over three books and two editions, drawn from \ndozens of sources, the rules often contradicted one another, making it necessary for folks to \ntote around hundreds of pages worth of Photoshop-bespangled reference material. \n\n\nSomething clearly had to be done. So Sunday night, I sat down with the two gentlemen who \nran the game I’d played in, and over friendly conversation, I floated the idea. “What would you \nguys think,” I said -“and this is just an idea, mind you - \nof a pocket-sized rulebook for Mind’s \nEye Theatre? None of the storytelling material, minimal background - \njust the rules in a size \nthat you could carry with you and that you could tuck into a pocket when you weren’t using it.” \nFor what it’s worth, they liked the idea. I can’t tell you exactly what they said (partially \nbecause I’m not sure I can quote it accurately, partially because the things I can remember to \nquote accurately aren’t necessarily printable in a family roleplaying journal), but they liked it. \nIf they hadn’t, I probably would have scrapped the whole idea and gone back to figure out how \nmany curls I would have needed to do in order to prep for the next game. But armed with a \nmandate from folks who were elbow-deep in the game, and who knew what they needed to \nmake their games run more smoothly, I could go back home and set up the project (that is, after \nthe incident with the massive hangover, the Star Wars‘ line designer, the ship’s bell and the \napproximately 4000 miniatures). \nIttookawhile, andit tooksomeconvincing.The ideaofapocketguide-justrules, nothing \nelse - \nwas so contrary to what we’d done before that some folks were skeptical of it. I knew the \nidea was a good one, though, and once I noted to People in High Places that we wouldn’t be \nincurring any new writing costs on the book, I got the green light. That’s when the fun started. \nInitially, the idea of the book was simply to cut and paste the rules files from the old books \ninto the new one. It would be easy, fast and useful - \nand it would save my sanity, because I was \nworking on Wraith 2nd Edition at the same time. Unfortunately, this simple plan ran into a few \nsnags. First of all, the files for the Players Kit were nowhere to be found. While I could do without \nthe print specs for the blood capsules that were included in the original box, I did sort of need the \nfiles for the lesser clans, their Disciplines and all of the other crunchy goodness that needed to go \ninto the book. Eventually the diskette with the required files turned up. (If I remember correctly, \nit was in the Marketing department, filed with the details of the White Wolf Microbrewery idea \nthat thankfully never got off the ground, and was labeled “I Gotcher Barney DoomWADs Right \nHere.” But I could be mistaken.) Pulling up the files led to problem number two: They were amess. \nI mean, I knew there were a few discrepancies between The Masquerade and the Vampire \nPlayers Guide, but once I started digging in, I realized that more work was needed. A lot more \nwork. As a matter of fact, so much work was needed that I had no idea where to start. There \nwas only one thing to do: Go back to the source. \nI bundled myselffor the Atlanta winter (yep, that meant a longsleeve shirt and jeans) and \nheaded off to the Red Light Caf6, where the local Vampire LARP crowd hung out on Tuesday \nnights. I sat down at a table and snagged random passersby, asking them what they felt needed \nchanging; scoping out which rules needed to be cleaned up or explicated better. \nHoo boy, did I get anearful. Three hours later, I staggeredoutunder theweightofmynotes. \nThen, masochist that I am, I fired up the computer and asked the same questions offriends who \nplayed MET all over the continent. The response was avalanche-like in its volume, intensity \nand ambient temperature. People had a lot of concerns. Even worse, a great many of those \nconcerns and proposed fixes contradicted each other. It was hopeless. So I did what any sane \nman would do in that sort of situation. I screamed for help. \nHelp arrived in the form of Editrix (no, that’s not a dirty word, and get your minds out of \nthe gutter, you filthy-headed brutes) Cynthia Summers, whose experience with actual Mind’s \nEye gameplay dwarfed mine, and who had long since set herself up as the Cerberus of MET. \nNothing that saw print for the line escaped her baleful gaze - \nwhich was a good thing for me. \nWe sat down with the old files, copious notes, e-mails and a healthy supply of caffeinated \n\n\nbeverages, and we decided which changes needed to be made, whose ideas for fixes were worth \nfollowing up on, and whom we were going to pummel senseless when the process was all over. \nI also had the unenviable task ofdecidingprecisely what material went into the book. The \nbasic clans and Disciplines? They had to be in there. The Sabbat? Sort of a necessity, I thought. \nMinor clans and bloodlines? Well, they weren’t available anywhere else. Other Disciplines? If \nthe clans were going to be in there, the appropriate rules had to be as well. Background? At least \nsome, for new players just picking up the book. The basics of the game? Indubitably. A little \nbit ofcommon-sense warning? A necessity, in light of all the rumbles about PTAs and religious- \nwatchdog groups hassling MET games. A FAQ? Considering the number of changes we’d \nmade, it sort of had to go in there. \nYou see how books get big, fast? Suddenly a 50,000-wordcut-and-paste job had turned into \na 110,000-word monstrosity. Some things got cut out of the draft - \nthere was no choice if we \nwanted it to fit between two covers- but still, it remained a towering, imposing pile of verbiage. \nA month or so later, a manuscript emerged. With much fanfare and other goofiness, it \nwent through the copy-editing process - \nmultiple times - \nand eventually emerged into the \nlight of Production and layout. \nThose ofyou with long memories might note that Laws of the Night was the first of the MET \nbooks to not have acover adorned with photographs and Photoshop. Rather, the book‘s cover has \na subdued gray marble background and little else - \njust logos (which are something of a design \nnecessity). That was deliberate. The idea (hashed out in many discussions with the talented Mr. \nLarry Snelly and Ms. Katie McCaskill, who laid out the book) was to create a book that acharacter \ncould carry - \nor even open - \nduring play, without having it look like, well, a game book. \nHopefully, we could put the rules in something that the most foppish Toreador or the most staid \nTremere wouldn’t feel awkward about whipping out in the midst of heavy roleplaying. \nDigression: I consider the illusion of the game world to be one of the most important \naspects of gameplay. I’m a big fan of deep immersion; every time a test goes off or dice hit the \ntable, it’s a forcible reminder that you are Just Playing A Game. I like my illusions, and I like \nthem with as little duct tape holding them together as possible. That means if I have to check \na rule during gameplay, I want to do so in a way that seems like part of the action. Ergo, the book \nthat gets pulled out for that check should look like an in-play prop, something my character \nwould have naturally. \nThat wasn’t the end of it, not by a long shot. The book was too long, which meant that \neven more material had to be cut or squeezed - \nKatie did heroic work shrinking headers, \nsmooshing sidebars and annexing borders so that everything that was vital would fit. Suddenly, \nfrom what had been a jumble, there emerged a book. \nFor all of its flaws - \nand I know the book has them, thank you- \nit does what it was intended \nto: It makes looking rules up in gameplay easier; it addresses the concerns of the people who helped \npoke at it. Most of all, it’s useful. \nAnd that, after all, is what I was after from the very beginning. \n\n\nTimes prophesied in the Book ofNod. Far more successful than most Gehenna cults, the \nTrue Hand claimed exclusive dominion over rare powers and mysterious secrets. These \nelders infiltrated and manipulated Camarilla and Sabbat alike, sometimes sirnulta- \nneously. Their crusaders hunted and killed vampires with a skill worthy of the Assamites. \nHowever, even the most fervent fanaticism is no equal to the destruction \nunleashed in the Final Nights. The deaths of powerful vampires and the chaos of war \nhas split the True Hand from its former contacts and allies, forcing its former members \nto hide or be destroyed. Crushed under the weight of centuries and the inevitability \nof change, the True Hand is no more, its vampires little better than the squabbling \nCainites against whom they so recently fought and maneuvered. \nOnce, the True Hand sought to serve the will of the Antediluvians. Its holdings \nin the Shadowlands - \nthe realm of the dead - \nlay beyond the reach of its enemies, \nand its careful manipulations and unique abilities allowed it to control entire broods \nof vampires with ease. The hierarchy of the True Hand is now disrupted, and its \nresources are scattered and broken. Only by integrating themselves into Kindred \nsociety can the True Hand’s former members survive. \n(Note: The True Black Hand and its adherents are not necessarily suitable for \nall styles of play. Storytellers should choose whether or not they wish to acknowl- \nedge the existence of the Black Hand in their individual chronicles. Certainly, the \nbloodlines and Disciplines presented here diverge considerably from those of \n“mainstream” vampires, and can be unbalancing. \nAlso note that the Nagaraja as presented here differ slightly from their tabletop \nincarnation in Dirty Secrets of the Black Hand. This is an intentional result of \nupdating them to conform to the standards of the revised Vampire.) \nN ~q A RAJ A \nOf course mankind continues on after death, my childe. Our existence should be \nenough to prove that. But what of the others who do not share in our particular cursed \nblessing of immortality? Why, they continue on as well, 1 assure you. That man there, \n\n\nby the corner, is going to die in the next few nights, as a matter offact. I am quite sure \nthat we will see him again shortly thereafter. How can I tell? Suffice it to say, I can see \nsuch things. And yes, I can teach you as well, though your tutelage will begin a bit \ndifferently than mine. We don’t have quite so demanding a schedule ahead of us as I did \nwhen 1 was inducted into this world. \nBut come. We will return to this subject in time. You and I mwt dine tonight, and \nI hawe prepared a most succulent repast. Do you remember the woman I pointed out to \nyou a week ago? The woman who had been hawing those terrible headaches.. .? \nThe forbidden experiments of the Tremere were not the only magical works \nto produce results. In the early days of the True Hand, a subsect of mages obsessed \nwith the secrets of death and the afterlife bent their collective will toward \nunderstanding vampirism. At last, convinced that their research granted them the \npower to manipulate the vampiric curse to their own ends, they conducted a great \nceremony to strike the life from their bodies and become undead forever. \nThe Nagaraja still exist, and they continue to study and develop the secrets \nof death and what lies beyond. Their command of necromantic arts is rivaled only \nby that of the Giovanni, and the Flesh Eaters have some secrets that not even the \nupstart Necromancers have discovered. Without the True Hand, the Nagaraja is \na directionless and dying bloodline; whether it survives the coming reckoning or \nfalls to the paranoid waltz of the Jyhad remains to be seen. \nClan Disciplines: Auspex, Dominate, Necromancy \nAdvantage: Instead of practicing the forms of Necromancy pioneered by the \nGiovanni, the Nagaraja use Vitreous Necromancy (sometimes called “Nihilistics”) \n- \na special path concerned with the energies of death and decay. Should your \ngame include the additionalNecromancy powers fromvampire, the Nagaraja use \nAsh Necromancy and are capable of learning Vitreous Necromancy after attain- \ning expertise to an Intermediate level. Otherwise, use Vitreous Necromancy as \ntheir primary Necromancy path, giving them access to unusual abilities unknown \nto other clans and bloodlines. Because of their sensitivity to the energies of the \ndead, Nagaraja can automatically sense the presence of any wraiths in their \nvicinity (about lofeet), although they cannot necessarily see or identify particular \nwraiths (at least, not without AshNecromancyor the Merits: Ghostsight or Speaker \nwith the Dead). \nDisadvantage: In addition to drinking blood, the Nagaraja must consume \nhuman flesh. A Nagaraja must devour two health levels’ worth of flesh each day, \npreferably fresh. A normal human corpse is considered to have three servings of \n“the other white meat.” Vampiric flesh will not do, as it rots and decays once it is \ndevoured. ANagaraja who fails to “get his pound of flesW’gains theNegative Trait: \nSickly for eachnight offasting; theseTraits disappear iftheNagarajalater consumes \nadditional flesh (one serving for each Trait). \nNagaraja have no special capacity for eating food other than raw flesh, unless \nthey take the Merit: Eat Food. \nI N C L U D I N C ~ T H E  \nNAC~ARAJAIN \nYOUR CHRONICLE \nAs a bloodline of perhaps adozen members from avampiric society now nearly \ndestroyed, the Nagaraja would seem to have limited potential for use as characters. \nWith the extent of the True Hand’s influence in vampiric society, though, such is \nhardly the case. Agents of the True Hand from almost all clans infiltrate various \n\n\nlevels ofthe Camarilla and Sabbat, and even in the wake of recent upheavals, they \ncontinue to advance their own schemes while hiding within the other sects. \nFormidable necromantic prowess combines with the wisdomofgreat age tomake \nthe Nagaraja cunning and dangerous adversaries. Obviously, other necromancers are \nthe most likely to know of the Nagaraja; the Giovanni family in particular considers \nthe Nagaraja a nuisance, but still casts a jealous eye toward the bloodline’s secrets. For \ntheir part, the Nagaraja take an interest in the larger movements of Kindred society. \nAny seemingly insignificant political or social change within either Camarilla or \nSabbat could conceal the maneuvers of the ancients; such chess matches draw the \nattention of the True Hand and its members. Without the safety of any secure haven \nor widespread allies, the Nagaraja must travel where their studies and needs take them \n- \nand so one or even two may appear just about anywhere, if only briefly. \nDue to their scarcity, Nagaraja shouldn’t arrive in a chronicle in droves. Rather, \nthey are harbingers of terrible portents, foreshadowing the schemes of ancient \nvampires playing in the Jyhad. Too much an unknown quantity to be actively \npersecuted, the Nagaraja are largely an enigma to the more common clans. \nPossible ideas for adding Nagaraja to your chronicle include: \nNagaraja follow up on hidden or lost necromantic secrets with an almost \nreligious fanaticism. A character unearthing an unusual bit of occult lore may \nattract the attention of a Nagaraja. \nThe movements of the ancients always draw the attention of the Tal’mahe’Ra. \nA Nagaraja agent may use his necromantic abilities to investigate unusual \nconspiracies or hidden influence in a city. \nSince veryfew Nagaraja exist-and \nas they are not exactly protected by the \nsheltering arms of the Camarilla or Sabbat - \nit makes sense for them to seek out \nplaces to hide, or allies on whom they can depend. A single Nosferatu contact or \na Brujah bodyguard can go a long way toward making unlife safer and more \nproductive, and the Nagaraja aren’t above making such contacts surreptitiously. \nWith their small bloodline size, Embracing potential recruits seems like a valid \nstrategy for Nagaraja. Of course, educating a brand-new vampire and teaching her to \navoid notice, unearth the secrets of unlife and defend against potential threats is a risky \nundertaking, so the Nagaraja seek out only the most talented and intelligent recruits. \nA mentor-student team might seek shelter with a small group of neonates or ancillae, \nso that the fledgling Flesh Eater can adjust to her new condition in relative security. \nThe forbidding workings of Vitreous Necromancy can be used to sense and \nmanipulate the dark energies ofentropy, decay and death. Formerly called “Nihilistics,” \nthis type of Necromancy is practiced almost exclusively by the now-vanished \nNagaraja bloodline. Other necromancers would give much to unearth this Discipline’s \nsecrets, for it is a powerful adjunct to the ability to control the Restless. Its true \ncapabilities, however, lie buried with its makers in the realm of the True Black Hand. \nV I  \nT R E o u s NE c R o M A N  CY \nB A S I C  \nEyes of the Dead \nTapping into the flow of death energy, you can see through the eyes of any \nwraiths who happen to be around you. By examining auras with the ghostly sight \nof the dead, you can determine relative states of health, decay and injury. \n\n\nSystem: You must expend a Mental Trait to use this power. Once activated, you are \ncapable of using a wraith’s Deathsight for the remainder of the scene, or until you pull your \nperceptions back into your ownbcdy (your normalsight is coopted by this power). You see from \nthe wraith’s perspective, allowing you to view the decaying architecture of the Underworld. By \nlooking at a person or object, you can determine if the subject is damaged or diseased. You can \nalso see the ebb and flow of baleful magic (curses and binding enchantments). \nHour of Death \nLike Eyes of the Dead, this power lets you see with the perceptions of a wraith. You \ncan pick out auras using your own vision, and see the telltale marks of death on all things. \nSystem: Activating this power calls for the expenditure of a Mental Trait. \nLike Eyes ofthe Dead, you can determine injury and disease with this power, simply \nwith your normal sight (instead of borrowing a wraith‘s vision). You may be able \nto tell if a subject is about to die - \nif a character is dying, you may ask a Narrator \nhow long the subject has to live (as determined by the target’s remaining Physical \nTraits). You can also distinguish between different forms of entropy, so you can tell \nthe relative power of various curses and harmful spells. \nI N T E R M E D I A T E  \nSoul Judgment \nTapping into the Beast that resides even in ghosts, you can sense a wraith‘s \ndark passions, the emotions that give it strength but also feed its hatred of the \nliving. You can determine whether a wraith is in the thrall of its Beast (called the \n“Shadow”), allowing you to plan your dealings accordingly. Since many wraiths are \nunaware of what their Beasts do while in control, this power allows you to bargain \nwith them in ways that may not be immediately apparent. \nSystem: You must expend a Willpower Trait and make a Mental Challenge \nwith the wraith in question in order to determine whether its higher self, or \n“Psyche,” has been overridden by its Shadow. This power also allows you to \ndetermine whether the wraith is routinely dominated by its Shadow; such wraiths \nare called Spectres and are exceedingly dangerous. \nBreath of Thanatos \nDrawing entropic energy out of your own dead body, you can breathe a fine, \ninvisible mist of death over an area. This energy settles like a seething cloud that \nattracts the attention of malefic spirits. \nSystem: You must expend a Blood Trait and make a Simple Test (win or tie) to \nexhale the BreathofThunutos. Ifsuccessful, you can cause the ghostly cloud to settle over \nan area around you; Spectres will come to this area, very likely to harass anyone within. \nAlternately, you may breathe the mist at an individual (requiring a Mental Challenge \nto direct the gases successfully). In this case, the victim suffers one health level of \naggravateddamage and is afflicted with theNegative SocialTraits: Repugnant x2 for the \nremainder of the evening; the energies give the victim an eerie, pallid aura. Also, such \na victim registers as tainted by Oblivion and Wyrm-energies. Multiple uses of this \nDiscipline in the same evening are not cumulative on any one victim. \nADVANCED \nSoul Feasting \nThis puissant power allows you to literally drain the energy of ghosts and the dead, \nabsorbing it foryourownpurposes. Youcan thenuse thisenergy tofuel your undeadpowers. \n\n\nSystem: You must expend a Willpower Trait to activate this power for the \nduration of a conflict. You can attack wraiths with your bite, just as if feeding \nnormally. If you manage to bite successfully (with a Physical Challenge), your fangs \npenetrate into the Underworld and allow you to devour the wraith’s energy - \neach \nCorpus level (health level) stolen in this fashion gives you one Trait of Entropy. (If \nyou “drink the wraith dry” in this fashion, the unlucky spirit falls into a Destruction \nHarrowing.) Alternately, you may simply draw entropy from your surroundings, if you \nare in a cemetery, Haunt or other place of the dead; in this case, you gain one Entropy \nTrait for each Mental Trait that you expend, up to three Traits total from any given \narea. These Entropy Traits may then be used to power Disciplines in the place of \nBlood Traits, although they cannot be used for any other functions common to Blood \nTraits (such as healing, reviving someone from torpor or improving Physical Traits). \nEntropy Traits gained with this power last throughout the evening, until spent. \nTRUE \nBRUJAH \nIfinditmostineriguing, really, thatmoreofthe Rubbledon’t knowaboutus. Troile was \nso proud of his victory over our father, and the younger ones haw such a time controlling \nthemelves that it would seem obvious that those of Troile’s line would be different. It seem \nthat the self-proclaimed scholars should be able to make the connection easily enough and \nhypothesiTe our existence, at least. But the young one I.. . questioned.. . had never heard of \nmybrothersandI. Hekeptinsisting(evenwhenIap~liedwhite-hotbra~ \ntohim) thathe was \na “true Brujuh. ” He honestly did not see the difference between himselfand I. But he will learn \nsoon enough, I suppose. He waits now in the hopes that the coming of day will let him escape \nIt’s of no consequence, ultimately. I have an eternity of night to convince \nhim otherwise. Then I can get buck to my real studies. \nAccording to the legends of the Kindred, the Brujah clan hails from the \nlineage of Troile, an upstart who diablerized the original Brujah Antediluvian. \nThough Troile stole the ancient’s power, he failed to usurp the entirety of the \nbloodline, and to this day several very old and very cunning descendants of the \noriginal Antediluvian are rumored to exist. Following the tradition of scholarship \nhanded down through their bloodline, the survivors’ logical minds and keen \nintellects focused on the acquisition of knowledge and the finer points of philoso- \nphy; their calm, rational natures led to a reputation as legendary thinkers and \nkeepers of wisdom. In addition to this wisdom, the True Brujah honed a keen sense \nof perception, leading them to develop unparalleled political machinations and an \nuncannv sense of history. Originally founding members of the True Black Hand, \nthe True Bruj ah - \nif, indeed, any remain - \nare said to control the perceptions of \ntime and even, among the eldest, the currents of the ages. \nA keen grasp of philosophy makes for a well-honed mind, but not necessarily an \nunderstanding or moral one. Indeed, the True Brujah as a whole left behind human \nmorality centuries before. In their quest for knowledge and their search for perfection \nof the mind, they delved into much forbidden lore. Bent to the purity of developing \nPlatonic ideals, they did not recognize the dangers of consorting with infernalists, and \nthey welcomed rites and sacraments most foul. With the patience of timesight and a \ndrive unfettered by emotions or morality, the True Brujah brought about their own \ndoom at Carthage and other places. Even when forming the True Black Hand, they \nrefused to rectify their errors, and their demonic taint and ties continued to infect \nthem - \nand still do in modern nights. \n\n\nHaving fled the destruction of their sect, what True Brujah remain would \npresumably be solitary and independent figures, weighted by powerful blood and \ncenturies of age. Beyond vengeance, petty politics or material concerns, these \nintrospective Cainites have only their shared thirst for knowledge left. If any \nsurvive, they are surely ensconced in the furthest comers of the world, studying \nesoteric works beyond the ken of mankind or younger vampires. \nClan Disciplines: Potence, Presence, Temporis \nAdvantage: True Brujah are exceedingly controlled and unemotional. De- \nvoid of passion, they find it easy to resist the ravages of frenzy, as they are not easily \nmoved to displays of rage or terror. A True Brujah always gains one free test to \nattempt to avoid frenzy (generally at the standard Trait difficulty), even without \nexpending a Willpower Trait. True Brujah also gain a single retest against powers \nor Disciplines that would incite frenzy in lesser vampires. \nDisadvantage: Because of their detachment and coldness, True Brujah have \ndifficulty holding to moral or philosophical concerns. To them, such abstractions \nare intellectual exercises, nothing more. True Brujah are likely to gain Beast or Path \nTraits as a result of their inability to hold to a system of beliefs. Any time that a True \nBrujah would be called upon to test for a new Beast or Path Trait, the player must \nmake two tests and take the worst result. If astoryteller decides to assign anew Beast \nor Path Trait without a test, the player should make one Simple Test; failure \nindicates that the character gains two Beast or Path Traits instead of just one. \nI N C L U D I N ~ T H E  \nTRUE \nBRUJAH \nI N  YOUR CHRONICLE \nTime and contemplation weigh heavily on the True Brujah. Determined to \nreclaim their stolen destiny from the brood of Troile, they weave convoluted and \nlong-running plots to take revenge for their losses. Though slow to anger, their fury \nis as boundless as any vampire’s when they are roused. \nThe appearance of a True Brujah is not something publicly bandied about. \nIndeed, most Kindred are completely unaware of the existence of the bloodline proper. \nGenerally, aTrue Brujahmasqueradesas aVentrueor Lasombrawhenassociating with \nCamarilla or Sabbat groups, relying on age and experience to dissuade investigation \ninto the truth. After all, with their history at Carthage and their supposed betrayal by \nTroile, they are quite experienced in deception and hidden warfare. \nFor the most part, True Brujah are historical scholars, antiquated relics of a \nbygone age who mull over much philosophy but rarely act. The days of the bloodline’s \nprominence - \nif, indeed, they ever truly were the basis of the Brujah clan - \nare long \ngone, and they now concern themselves with memories of the past. As a result, True \nBrujah often cloister themselves from all but a few Kindred, seeking memories of their \nformer glory or the sleep of ages. Only a rare few actively involve themselves in the \npresent, and even they are hard pressed to keep up with the constant changes of the \nfrightening modem age. Whether or not the coming Final Nights will rouse the True \nBrujah to action - \nor lead to their ultimate destruction - \nremains to be seen. \nPossible ideas for adding True Brujah to a chronicle include: \nWith their time senses, True Brujah often have a good idea of important \nplaces in the unfolding of history. The ebb and tide of unusual events can draw a \nTrue Brujah to investigate. \nWith their scholastic knowledge and long history, True Brujahare always in search \nof new discoveries. When a piece of arcane lore is unearthed in a particular chronicle, a \n\n\nto the flow of time; you can keeptime with perfect \nprecision. Unnatural eddies in the flow of time are also sensed. Magical alterations of \ntime, or other uses of Temporis, are therefore quite apparent. \n\n\nSystem: No challenge or expenditure is necessary to use this Discipline; once \na practitioner becomes familiar with the ebb and flow of time, its rhythms are \nalways apparent. \nRamble On \nBy affecting a subject’s sense of the passage of time, you can force the \nindividual to continue performing a particular action. The victim is entranced, \ncarrying on his action long after he intended to stop. An individual taking a walk, \nfor instance, continues walking even after he has overshot his destination; a victim \ntrying to run away becomes so intent upon fleeing that he keeps trying to run even \nafter he has been captured. \nSystem: You must make a Social Challenge against the target to use this \npower. Once activated, the subject automatically attempts to repeat the same \naction performed in the current turn in the next turn. Thus, in the next turn, the \nvictim repeats what he was doing previously, as long as the action is repeatable. A \ncharacter who picks up a book, for instance, cannot be made to try to pick up the \nsame book once he’s already holding it; in the presence of several books, though, \nhe could be made to pick up an additional book. \nI N T F R M E D I A T F  \nZombie’s Curse \nWarping a target’s perception of time, you can make the victim take longer \nto do anything. The subject slows down, moving as if smothered in molasses, and \nhe has difficulty reacting to things happening at “normal speed.” \nSystem: You must engage in a Social Challenge with your victim in order to \naffect her perception of time. If successful, the subject is slowed for the next 15 \nseconds (four turns). A slowed victim may still use weapons and powers, but her \nactions always come after everyone else’s, and she may have difficulty in combat. The \nslowed target suffers from the Negative Traits: Clumsy x2 due to dulled reactions. \nCowalker \nBlinking outside of time, you can move briefly between ticks of the clock. A \nconcerted force ofwill allows you to step beyond the bounds of normal time, so that \nyou are able to act while the world is frozen around you. \nSystem: Expend a Willpower Trait to step betweenseconds, and you are able to take \none action (and only one, without any enhancements from Ceknty or other powers) \nbetween turns. You cannot affect anything else that is frozen in time - \nthus, you could \nbattle another individual who is also using this power, but you cannot open a door, punch \nsomeone or turn on a light. In effect, you are free to move for one turn - \ngenerally, to \na distance of three steps. However, if you can get out of reach of your opponent or find \na suitable hiding place, you may be able to use this power for a Fair Escape. You can also \nattack from surprise by using this power in combat, at least the first time you “blink.” \nADVANCED \nFrozen Object \nYou can literally warp the fabric of time around an object, causing it to exist \nin a pocket outside the flow of the seconds. Such an object retains any energy or \nproperties that it had when frozen, but it cannot be affected by interactions from \n:he normal time stream. As a result, you can throw a knife and then leave it in mid- \niir, or halt time for a grenade thrown at you long enough to escape. \n\n\nSystem: An object may be frozen for up to 15 seconds (four turns) of normal \ntime. You must decide how long to freeze the object when halting it. Although you \ndo not need to touch the item, you must be able to see it, and it cannot be in the \npossession of another individual. Therefore, you can freeze a knife, a bomb or a \nfalling object, but unless you have some means of seeing a bullet (such as by \nstepping outside time with the Cowalker power), you cannot affect it. Frozen \nobjects retain their energy but cannot interact with the physical world; thus, a \nthrown knife resumes flying once this power elapses, but it cannot be plucked from \nthe air while frozen. Activating this Discipline requires the expenditure of one \nPhysical Trait. \nMASTER \nControl Aging \nYou can alter the effects of time upon a particular subject. With a touch, you can \nrapidly speed up, slow down or even reverse the accumulation of time in your target. \nSystem: You must grasp your target physically in order to control time’s effects \nupon it; this may require al’hysical Challenge in the case of unwilling subjects. The \nobject can be no larger than roughly man-sized - \ngenerally, 500 pounds or so is \nthe upper limit. You must then expend one Physical Trait for each decade that you \nwish to add to or subtract from the victim’s age. Note that vampires altered \nchronologically with this power do not undergo physical changes (they are \nimmune to the ravages of time), but may suffer supernatural difficulties (such as \ninability to gain sustenance from the blood of animals or even humans). Once this \npower is used on a given individual, it may not be used again on the same subject \nin the same game session. \nDomain of Evernight \nBy dilating the perceived flow of time around yourself, you can make it appear \nthat time has sped up incredibly. Everyone in the area - \nincluding you - \nexperiences a highly altered flow of time. This power can be used to great effect \nwhen defending a haven, by causing night to come with rapidity or by exposing \nvampiric foes to daylight. \nSystem: This power affects only a single room at a time. You must win a Static \nMental Challenge (difficulty seven Traits) to cause one hour of time to pass in the \nspace of a single turn (about five seconds of real time or so, when not in combat). \nYou must have a Narrator present in order to use this power; all events in the given \nroom are taken “out of location” as the area steps outside of the normal time stream. \nThose who step into the area are immediately included in the perception- \ndistorting effects. If a room is affected with this power, those inside cannot return \nto the normal flow of the game until outside time “catches up” with their perceived \ntime frame. \nFor example, if Laocrines the True Brujah activates this power in a side room \nat seven o’clock, he can make a Mental Challenge to cause everyone in the area \nto experiencedilated time for an hour (althoughsubjectively the inhabitants ofthe \nroom experience only a single turn). No one who enters the room or is in the area \nof effect can leave the room until eight o’clock outside. \nDue to the potential disruptiveness of this power (possibly causing several \nplayers to wait for an hour or more before returning to play), Storytellers should \nexercise extreme caution in allowing its use in their games. \nE N OC  H IAN MYSTICISM \ne \n\n\nPUMONCA EOR \nWYLD W € S T  \nby Jess Heinig \n6 \nThe Nuwisha and the Cmax aren’t the only newcomers to Mind’s Eye \nst.

These \nare taught to only the most trusted of the clan, and those who \npossess these secrets are watched to ensure that said secrets do not find their way to outsiders. \nFor a player to purchase these rituals, the character must be of at least seventh \ngeneration and of exceptional standing with House and Clan Tremere. The cost is the same \nas for any Master-Level Discipline, however this level of Thaumaturgy does not impart any \nadditional powers; it simply allows the character to learn these closely guarded rituals. \nWe recommend that Storytellers require characters to pursue research into these rituals \nin-game (through the use of Influences and Abilities) to represent the rarity of this class of \nblood magic. Each ritual requires a rare component that should be gained through \nroleplaying; it isdoubtful that your local Chantrywould have, say, aLupine skin lying around. \n- \nR A I S B T H E  DEAD \nJohnny Dash had just sunk his fangs into the prostitute’s neck whena hand came down \non his shoulder from behind. “Always when I’mfeeding,” he thought. He tookaquickgulp \nthen pulled his head back, still keeping a grip on the whore’s hair. “This better be good.” \n“Lord Asteron requests your presence, ” the figure behind him stated. “Come with me. ” \nJohnny was about to slam-dunk the weirdo into anearby dumpster, but the name it invoked \ngave him pause. Asteron was one of the old Warlocks his sire was always muttering about. The \nfigure steppd forward, andJohnny saw a symbol carved or tattooed on its forehead - \nthat and \nthe fact rhat most of the “man’s” h r  was either white or gone, and that its eyes had sunk deeply \nbeneath its dohow brow. “Hurry. After this task, I am to be released from this bondage.” \nJohnny nodded and let the whore fall to her knees on the alley floor. He didn’t like \nthe Tremere, but he understood one thing.. . freedom. If his going with this walking corpse \nmeant its release , he was all fbr it. \nThis ritual allows the thaumaturge to resurrect a dead body. The corpse is not \ntruly the same person brought back from the dead; the body merely acts as the host \nfor a spirit that the thaumaturge coerces into inhabiting the corpse. \nThis existence is torturous for the spirit in question, and most spirits seek \nrelease from the bondage. Unfortunately, there is no way for the spirit to become \nfree unless the thaumaturge lifts the enchantment, or the body decomposes. The \nMASTER- \nLEVEL” \nTHAUMATUEtjY RITUALS \n4 4  \n\n\nWarlock most likely uses this fact as a bargaining tool to get the spirit to do his \nbidding. However, the spirit retains its free will and it can act as it wishes. \nRequirements \nThe thaumaturge must have a cadaver with flesh still on the bones - \nthe fresher \nthe corpse, the longer the ritual holds the spirit. If the caster wishes the corpse to interact \nwith the outside world, it is recommended that the body be less than a week old. \nHe must brand a symbol that translates as “debtor” on the corpse’s forehead, \nand must pour the wax from a black candle over the heart and throat of the subject. \nThe wax is the symbol that initially binds the spirit into the corpse. The room in \nwhich this ritual is performed must be completely devoid of light with the exception \nof the black candle used. The entirety of the ritual must also be conducted in a salt \ncircle with a diameter equal to the length of the body, from head to toe. \nSystem \nThe casting character should possess either Spirit Eyes (Basic Spirit \nThaumaturgy) or Spirit Slave (Intermediate Spirit Thaumaturgy) before purchas- \ning this ritual, as either allows the character to interact with the spirits necessary. \nThe character must defeat the spirit in a Static Mental Challenge versus 14 \nTraits to successfully coerce the spirit to enter the corpse. Once the spirit is bound \ninto the cadaver, the thaumaturge has no firm control over the actions of the \ncorpse, other than what is gained through roleplaying. \nThe corpse’s initial Physical/Mental/Social Traits should be determined by the \nStoryteller after the ritual is completed. The corpse possesses the same number of health \nlevels as a regular character. These levels can be lost to damage other than decomposi- \ntion, and cannot be healed back. However, the corpse is not subject to wound penalties. \nAt the beginning of each game session, the thaumaturge player must engage \nin a Static Physical Challenge versus 12 Traits. If the player loses, the corpse loses \na health level due to decomposition. \nOnce the corpse loses all of its health levels, the spirit is released and the ritual \neffect is ended. \nThe corpse of a vampire who has suffered Final Death cannot be used in this ritual. \nR I T U A L O P  \nHOLDING \nIt wasn’t easy, but Yusef had finally located his target. Carvel had been missing \nalmost half the night, but Yusef had not yet given up. And now he had found him, not two \nblocks from the target’s despicable “Chantry . ” Yusef had waited longfor the chance to spill \na Tremere’s blood, and now would be his chance. \nStealingfrom his hidingplace in the shadows ofa two-story parkingdeck, Yusef crept \nup on Carvel unawares. In a burst of speed that scattered litter and dust in its wake, Yusef \nswept Carvel into a darkened alley across the street from where he stood. The Tremere \nfought bneflr , but Yusef tackled him to the ground, blanketed the area in a heavy cloak \nof silence and pinned the vampire down with a knee on each of Carvel’s slim elbows. \nMouthing the words, “Welcome the sun,” he pulled two woodenstakesfrom beneath his \nplain wool jacket. As per his orders, he would leave the Tremere paralyzed until the sun \nrose overhead. Yet, the Tremere seemed more surgnsed than afraid or wurried. \nWithout even a shrug, Yusef plunged the first of his two stakes into the Tremere’s \nchest. Unsurprisingly, the shaft exploded into hamless chips when it touched Carvel’s \nskin. Yusef had been warned that many Tremere knew a ritual that protected them from \n\n\nminglestake, andhe hadcomeprepared. Smiling, he brought thesecondstakedownwhere \nthe first had disintegrated. Let the Tremere choke on his proud faith in his rituals. \nAma~ngly, the second shaft went the way of the first. Yusef sfingers closed on air, \nandhefalteredinshock.

Carvel put a handover Yusefs heart andmouthed the words, “Welcome \nthe Devil. ” A moment later, Carvel’s eyes danced as his hand erupted in flames. \nThis ritual enhances the effects of other rituals. The effects of this enhance- \nment differ according to the type of ritual with which it is used. \nRequirements \nPerforming this ritual adds six hours to the casting time of its partner ritual. \nThe material component of the Ritual of Holding is a solidTgold sphere. After \ncompletion of the initial ritual, the thaumaturge immerses the sphere in two points \nof his blood and spends six hours chanting over the sphere. After that time, the \nsphere absorbs the blood and the second ritual is considered complete. \nOnlv one ritual may be extended by a given casting of the Ritual of Holding \nSystem \nTo represent the concentration required for this ritual, the character must \nengage in a Static Mental Challenge against 14 Traits. If she loses, the Ritual of \nHolding fails and there is no change to the original ritual. \nThe benefit of the Ritual of Holding is specific to the ritual with which it is used. \nThe player may suggest the effect that she wishes to achieve, but the Storyteller is the \nfinal authority as to what actually happens. Some suggested effects include: \nBlood Walk: Extends the reach of the ritual to the progeny of the target, or \nto those whose blood the target has tasted. \nEngaging the Vessel of Transference: Exchanges only one Blood Trait for \nevery two taken. \nShaft of Belated Quiescence: Makes it impossible for Cleansing of the Flesh \nto remove the shaft. \nOnce the effect of the ritual is decided, the Storyteller should fill out a card \ndetailing the results, and give it to the player. \nThe player and Storyteller should discuss the effect that Holding has, and \nthey should conduct any tests involved in advance of the ritual. Doing so allows \nthe character to perform the ritual during downtime rather than miss an entire \ngame session. \nUTTER \nDBSTRUCTIONOE \nBONDS \nHere 1 am, locked in the back seat of a car, in the middle of the junkyard outside of \ntown, with less than 20 minutes before dawn.

The disturbance bored toward her from a cabin window and slammed \ninto her midsection like a locomtive. She hit the ground hard and realized that she couldn’t \nfeel her hind legs -which \nlay where she once stood. She could not even raise a howl of agony \nor defeat as the night sky slowly grew ominously darker. \n\n\nChill of the Windsaber is perhaps the most controlled of the antitribu ritual,, \nand for good reason. A Tremere that possesses this ritual has the ability to destroy \nan opponent from a distance without leaving a trace of the attacker \nThis ritual is very tightly regulated by the Tremere, to the extent that most of the \nclanstilldonot know that itexists. ForaTremere to be taught this ritual, hemust spend \nat least three months in Vienna where his loyalty to house and clan is tested. If he is \ndeemed worthy, the ritual is taught to him. The penalty for teaching this ritual to \nanyone who has not undergone this trial is Final Death for both teacher and student. \nRequirement \nBefore the ritual can begin, the vampire must possess something that belongs \nto the intended victim, such as a piece of clothing, a lock of hair or a Blood Trait. \nOnce this item has been obtained, the vampire must spend one hour using the item \nto create a doll that represents the intended victim. \nThe second item required is a small piece of glass. This glass is placed on the doll, \nand the cabter must spend another hour chanting over the doll to complete the ritual. \nThe vampire must be totally alone and undisturbed while intoning this ritual. \nIf his concentration is broken, he must begin again. \nTo activate the ritual, thevampiremust have bothdoll andglass in his possession \n(bothofwhichmustbe inthesamecondition theywereinwhen theritualwas enacted \nin order to preserve their magical properties), and he must be within 50 feet of the \nintended victim.

If the player wins, the ritual is successful; if \nnot, the ritual fails and the character must start all over with a new item from the victim. \nTo activate the ritual, the player must defeat the victim in a Mental \nChallenge. If the player wins the challenge, he decides how many Willpower to \nspend to fuel the effect. For each Willpower spent, the victim suffers one health \nlevel of damage. If the caster spends four Willpower, the full effect of the ritual is \nimposed and the victim’s head is severed from her body. \npersonal item of the victim’s before the ritual can begin. \nT H E  GIET \n“The infiltraaon was successful?” the weathered old woman asked, peenng int( \nrecruit’s soul (or so it felt). \n“Yes, Excellency,” the young Assamite nodded. “And I returned with the boa \nthe one you asked for. ” \n“Most amanng, Ramhi,” the old woman sad, as if she had sad the same worc \ncountless other recruits ame and again. “You are to be rewarded most handsomely.

The exact Disciplines and number are up to the thaumaturge. \nThis ritual was often used as a form of reward for service among the antttnbu. \nRequirements \nThe material component of this ritual is a silver mirror, a Trait of the caster’s \nblood and one Trait of the recipient’s blood. \nThe caster mixes the blood Traits together and writes the name of the \nDisciplines she wishes to transfer onto the surface of the mirror. Once this is \ncompleted, both parties touch the mirror for the prescribed time. \nSystem \nThe ritual requires 15 minutes of contact per Discipline transferred. \nThe Tremere player must succeed in a Mental Challenge versus 12 Traits. If \nshe wins, the character transfers exactly the amount of the Discipline she intended. \nIf the player ties, the caster transfers less than intended; if the player fails, the caster \ntransfers more than intended. In either case, it is up to the Storyteller to be the final \narbiter of exactly how much of the intended Discipline is transferred. \nYou may not use this ritual to give a character a level of a Discipline that he \ncould not normally achieve. In other words, you cannot use the ritual to give a \n13th-generation vampire a Master-Level Discipline. \nThe transfer of Disciplines affects the donor and recipient in the following \nway: The donor looses Disciplines from the highest level down, and the recipient \ngains Disciplines from the lowest level up. \nExample: Cassiodorus, an aged Tremere, uses The Gift on Bobby, a Brujah in \nhis service, to give Bobby Heightened Senses. Cassiodorus loses his highest level of \nthe Auspex Discipline - \nin this case Psychic Projectton - \nat the end of the ritual. \nTransferred Disciplines can be bought back by the donor at the normal \nExperience Trait costs. (See Laws of the Night, page 61.) \nIan looked doeon at the sobbing woman at his feet, then glanced around quickly to see \nifanyone could hear her cries fur help. He had always had a taste fur blondes, but they could \nnever seem to keep their mouths shut when he tried to feedfrom him. It was really annoying. \n“You bit me,” the woman sobbed, cowering her neck and sliding back up against the \nsteps of her apartment building. “Why did you bite me?” \nConcentratingjust as his sire had taught him, Ianreachedinto the woman’s eyes with \nhis own and said, “I never bit you, woman. You were mugged by two men.” The \nwoman grew quiet instantly as her mind processed the information Ian had planted there. \nHowever, he still had not had a chance to feed.. . . \n\n\n“Now close your eyes,” he said The woman obeyed. “Tilt back your head. The \nwoman did as lan commanded. “Now relax.” The woman’s shoulder’s slumped. \nConwinced that his victcm would gwe him no more problems, Ian closed his eyes and \nleaned close to the woman’s cold neck like a lover with- \ncold neck? \nSomething struck lan in the chest and he flew backward through the air. A moment \nlater, his back connected with afire-escape ladder and he crumpled to the ground, unable \nto move. Something was stuck through his chest.

She hoisted him painfully onto her shoulder with one hand and leaped \nup to catch the fire escape with the other. “At least it’llmake you easy to control. Bishop \nMark likes them easy. ” \nThis ritual is very useful when you do not wish to be spied upon through use of \nAuspex. O f  the anambu rituals, this one is used most frequently. However, use of this \nritual when dealing with others in the Tremere hierarchy is not looked upon kindly. \nRequirements \nThis ritual requires an object, such as a hatpin or earring, that is made entirely \nof iron, and a lodestone that has been soaked in the blood of the caster for three \nnights prior to the ritual. O n  the third night, the caster must spend an hour \nspeaking an incantation while rubbing the lodestone over the surface of the iron \nobject. At the end of the hour, the object takes on a reddish color and is ready to \nuse. The object must then be worn on the head in some fashion - \nas a hairpin, an \nearring, a tlara or whatever. \nWhile the ritual is in effect, the caster is virtually immune to Auspex. Anyone \nattempting to use this Discipline on the caster notices that something is wrong, but \nnot what. The effect of the ritual lasts until the next sunrise or until the object IS \nremoved from the caster’s head. \nSystem \nThe player must win a Static Mental Challenge versus 12 Traits. If the player \nwins, the ritual is a success; if not, the ritual fails. \nWhile under the effects of this ritual, the character receives the Mental Traits: \nIhscipkwd x5, which can only be used to defend against Auspex-related challenges. \nAdditionally, the character receives a free retest on each Auspex-related challenge he loses. \nWhile under the effects of this ritual, acharacter may not relent to any Au \nchallenge. Thus, you cannot choose to let an ally communicate with yo1 \nTelepathy; you would have to lose both the initial challenge and the free retc \ncommunicate telepathically. \nS H A D O  w o E T H  \nF: W o  \nL E  \n“Bretheren,” the ancient-looking Siker Fang called Knows-His-Words, said \nrily as dawn neared, “you have defended this place well agams t our enemies, the waml \nMany ofour kin have fallen this night, but their stories will be told throughout the a \nSome ofthe othersgrowled their agreement, but nos t p t  sat stdm exhaustion and list \n“Though the leeches’ treachery war most foul,” the Fang continued, “though \ntned to betray me under aflagof truce two nights ago, we hawe yet prewailed.

Many had died in the night, and those left had suffered griewously. \n“I want you to know,” the Fang continued, seeming to sag a bit where he stood, \nthough his voice picked up speed, “that you hawe done me aserwice as well. You hawe taken \ncare of those who would have been my greatest riwals. For that I will sing your praises. ” \nThe others raised confused eyebrows at that, but the Silver Fang only smiled and took an \nillustrious bow. The sky lightened in the east. When the Fang tumd, his skin was lined with even \nmore wrinkles than it had been a moment ago. His brow was heawy with concern, or so it seemed. \n“And now I go to rest , ” he said, suddenly full of life despite his appearance. \nHe raised his a m  in a fluid motion and shrugged mightily. With a sound like a sheet \ntearing, he stepped back and sloughed off the outer layer of his skin. Now, standing before \nthe remaining Garou was a thin, pale man with a long black ponytail and a vicious smik. He \nbowed again, stepped back into the s M w  of the trees and disappeared with the skin of \nKnows-His-Words danglingraggedfrom his hand. Before the Garou could rouse themselwes \nto give chase, they heard a sound like laughter in the forest surrounding the caem. All around \nthem, wague, twisted shapes clawed and squirmed out of the Umbra and crept closer.. . . \nThis potent ritual allows a vampire to actually become a Lupine for one \nevening. The material component is a cloak made from the skin of a werewolf. The \ntribe to which the vampire “belongs” depends upon the type of skin used in the \nritual; Auspice is always Theurge. \nWhile the ritual imparts the form of a Lupine, it does not bestow the vampire \nany Gifts, Rites or knowledge of how to act like a Garou. It behooves the vampire \nto have at least one level of Garou Lore before attempting this ritual. \nRequirements \nThe vampire must chant over the ill-gotten Lupine skin for an hour-and-a-half \nwhile sprinkling his own blood around it. At the end of that time, the vampire dons \nthe cloak, which fuses to his own skin for the remainder of the evening. Once this \nprocess is complete, the vampire becomes (for all intents and purposes) a Lupine. The \ncloak separates from the vampire at sunrise, and may be reused, although the ritual \nmust be repeated each time the vampire wishes to become a werewolf thereafter. \nSystem \nUpon completion of the ritual, the player engages in a Static Mental \nChallenge versus 14 Traits to determine if the ritual is successful. \nThe player needs to create a werewolf character and identity using his vampire \nas a basis. The Lupine is subject to all the advantages and limitations of a normal \nGarou. It may change forms and it is vulnerable to silver. \nThe werewolf begins with two Rage for each Beast Trait that the caster \npossesses, and one Gnosis. The player may attempt to raise these ratings asa normal \nLupine would. \nIf the caster reuses the cloak, the player must engage in a Simple Test to see \nif the skin is still viable for the ritual. \nThe Garou Gift: Scent of True Form detects that there is something amiss \nabout the “werewolf,” but it gives no specifics. \nThe Garou Gift: Sense Wyrm detects Wyrm-taint if the vampire possess more \nthan two Beast Traits. \nUnless the character has some level of the Ability: Garou Lore, he finds it nigh \nimpossible to interact with Garou society. \n\n\nT- \ns P I D E R ’ S  W E B  \nMarcel sliced the window pane away with hs glass-cutter and jimmied the lock open \nThe place ddn’t even hawe an alarm system, which was odd, consdenng how adamant the \nman who’d hired him - \na creepy old fart named Regrnald - \nhad been about not gettmg \ncaught Marcel med to tell the guy that nobody would go to so much trouble to protect a book, \nbut the old dude ddn’t listen.

The difference is that the webbing can fill an entire room and \nis strong enough to capture and hold victims immobile The webbing lasts until it \nis tom down, making it an excellent defense for a haven. \n~ \nRequirements \nBefore enacting this ritual, the vampire must obtain a black widow spider and \nfeed it vitae on seven consecutive evenings. O n  the final evening, \ncrushes the spider in a marble container and consumes it While invoking a chant, \nthe vampire begins to exude webbing from her hands. This webbing can be shnned \ninto any form and can cover up to 400 square feet. \nI \nSystem \nThe player must win a Static Mental Challenge versus 12 Traits to coml \nthis ritual successfully. \nThe character is immune to any webbing he creates; he can move fi \nthroughout it. This does not mean, however, that the character can climb or \nstrands. He simply does not get stuck as others do. \nIf a different character contacts the web, he is stuck. A victim may attem \ntear or cut himself free by winning three Static Physical Challenges versus t \nTraits. Potence retests are allowed. \nIf a character wishes to enter the web and avoid getting stuck, a test is reqi \nusing a dexterity-based Physical Trait (Nimble, Athletic) versus 12 Traits. \nMAST E R- LE v E L” THAW \nM ATU R cj Y RI T w A LS \n66 \n@ \n\n\n3 \nby Shane De Freeat \nEye Theatre characters in The h\ng\n \nNight \nhave an opportunity to get in on the actton! \nPresented here are several Discipline-com- \nbination powers that can be found in Vampire \nThe Dark Ages, built for use in The Long Night. .\" \nfuture Libellus Sanguinis releases showcase the unique \ncapabilities of the clans, expect more combination Disciplines to rise under the \nlight of the moon. \nLearning a combination Discipline requires a great deal of effort. In addition to \nrequiring certain levels of proficiency in various Disciplines, combination Disciplines \nhave their own Experience Trait costs. Furthermore, many of these powers are known \nto only a few scattered members of specific clans; such esoterica requires unusual \ndedication and study. A Storyteller is well within rights to limit the selection of \navailable combination Disciplines, requiring characters to seek out elder mentors and \nto undertake harrowing training and quests in pursuit of these unusual capabilities. \nA R M O R O E  \nDARKNESS \n(Basic Fortitude, Intermediate Obtenebration) \nWe lured the damned thing that used to be wise Lord Albert into the stables. The \nbrave lads who muck the stalk; barred the doors, locking the monster inside. Archibald, \nthe former squire to the unliving knight, ordered torches lightedandflame-arrows notched. \nAt his order, we rained our fire on the stables, turnzng the dry tinder to a beacon that \npushed back the night.

Archibaldfroze: Therein thedoorway, silhouetted \nby hungry flame and crashing ruin, stood Lord Albert m amor darker than nighted \nshadow. Albert advanced on his erstwhile squire, but I learned not the fate ofeither. Devil \nhound us all, the others and I fled, leaving Archibald to hu fate. \nCombining a vampire's preternatural resilience with the inky shadowstuff of \nObtenebration, some Magisters are able to cloak themselves in adarkness that resists \nthe pall of fire and sunlight. So armored, these fearsome Lasombra venture into \neven daylight to further their schemes. \n\n\n \nexpenditure of a Social Trait, you may choose to shape it into the guises of various \nforms of night-black clothing or armor. \nActivating Armor of Darkness requires the expenditure of a Willpower Trait, and the \nfurther expenditure of three Mental Traits for each level of protection. Maintaining the \narmor then requires concentration; all actions undertaken while garbed increase in diff iculty \nby one Trait. The armor lasts until destroyed by fire or sunlight; each level of protection \nabsorbs one level of damage from such sources, until the shadows are burned away. \nLearning this power requires commerce with one of the few and secretive Magisters \nwho practices it, and it costs eight Experience Traits. \nA U R A O E  \nINESCAPABLE \nTRUTH \n(Intermediate Dominate, Intermediate Presence) \n“Who invited you to my court?” the Ventrue Prince Valmont asked, peering lazily from \nhis oaken throne. The assassin thoughtfun’ously , silently recounting the details ofthe story he’d \npracticed time and again, and thanking the Maker that he could no longer sweat. The pnnce’s \nharpies and his wizened, scrawny seneschal leaned closer. They eyed the assassin like circling \nwultures--merely interestedat present, but in strikingdistance skould things turn to theirfawor . \n“I.. . ” the assassin stammered, his fingers twitching toward the poisoned knife in his sleewe- \nsheathe. Why couldn’t he just use his story? He could remember it; why couldn’t he just say it? \n“Tell me why you have come to my domain!” \n“I.. . the seneschal hired me to kill you,” the assassin gasped. \n“I see,” Valmont said, leaning back, glancing at his second as his harpies and guards \nclosed ranks. “How interesting.. . .” \nA favorite of Ventrue courts, this formidable power combines direct mental \ncontrol with subtle influence to force subjects to speak only the truth. Though taxing, \nthis power is unquestionably vital to the political battlefields of elder Cainites. \nWhen establishing the Aura of Inescapable Truth, you must expend a Will- \npower Trait, and then engage in a mass Social Challenge against everyone who can \nsee your face (risking one Social Trait for each target). If you win the challenge, \nnobody under the influence of the power may deliberately speak untruthfully; \nthose who attempt to do so simply find themselves unable to speak at all, though \na target may still speak an untruth if he behewes it to be true. \nThe Aura of Inescapable Truth does not force victims to remain within your \npresence, nor does it continue to function if they leave. The power’s activation and \ninfluence are automatically noticeable to anyone affected. As with all Dominate \npowers, vampires of lower generation than yourself are unhindered by this power, \nalthough this may not be immediately apparent. \nThis power costs 11 Experience Tram to dewelop. \nBLESSED RESILIENCE \n(Master Fortitude, Intermediate Mortis) \nIsawztall, begmnzngtoend.

Take my hand.. . . \nWith command of incredible resilience and unmatched insight into the secrets \nof death, the Cappadocians are the undisputed masters of death during the Long \nNight. For the truly dedicated Cappadocian, even the grave itself may be overcome. \nWhen extinguished- beaten, burned, cut or otherwise driven to Final Death \n- \nyou may draw upon your monumental reserves to pull yourself back across the \nthreshold of destruction. You immediately expend all of your remaining Blood \nTraits and two Willpower Traits (plus one additional Willpower Trait for each \nsevered limb that must re-attach to your body). If you do not have sufficient \nWillpower, you fail to rise. Otherwise, your body parts crawl back together and re- \nknit (as long as they are nearby - \nwithin about 10 paces or so). You then return \nto the Incapacitated health level. \nWhen you exercise Bkssed Resilience, you tax your supernatural reserves to \ntheir absolute limits. Effectively, your generation rises by one - \na seventh- \ngeneration Cappadocian using this power is considered eighth-generation afterward, \nwith all of the concomitant losses to Blood Traits, Willpower Traits, Attribute \nTraits and high-level Disciplines. This weakening is permanent, though you may \nstill lower your generation later through diablerie. \nUnearthing the masterful Blessed Resilience costs 18 Experience Traits. \nBLOOD P B A R L O E T H E ~ O M B U  \n(Basic Mortis, Basic Necromancy, Basic Thaumaturgy, and at least two \nIntermediate levels or one Advanced level in these Disciplines) \nI wasn’t good enough, they said.

For young members of the clan, the necessary expertise in the Mortis \nDiscipline is impossible to achieve due to the simple impediment of generation. \nHowever, by combining research of the recently inducted Giovanni with more \ngeneral magical knowledge, it is possible for even novices to develop a means to \ncreate unliving servants. \nBy distilling two Blood Traits into a special magical pearl-like sphere (a \nprocess requiring eight hours of work, and thus generally performed outside the \nconfines of game time), you may enchant your blood to animate a corpse.

A few quick seconds would put him in the woods and near enough to the \nriver where he’d h&n \nhis rowboat. He heard that the baron was no man to make an \nenemy of- \nsome rumurs ewen suggested that the lord devoured those who crossed him \n- \nbut Reinhart cared only for the ruby. It had belonged to his family before the baron had \nestablished his “domain” here. Let the peasants whisper about the “hellspawn” that \nguarded the baron’s gates; Reinhart had seen none when he sneaked in. Let the ignorant \nfanners believe that the nobleman drank blood and tortured his enemies for amusement; \nall Reinhart knew was that in another few moments he would reach his boat and be safely \naway with the means to restore his family’s fortune. \n“Ah, Hew Reinhart,” a thzckly accented voice said as a hand fell heavily on his \nshoulder. Reinhart turned to see the baron himself, dressed in all his lordly finery, peering \ndown at him. Reinhart had not ewen heard him approach. “I believe you are trespassing.” \nReinhartmadeasiftosay something, butanobjectinthe baron’shandgave himpawe. \nIt appeared to be a spade, but it seemed to grow and elongate, like watchingan icicle melt, \nuntil the baronappe~edtobeholdinga~kedly \nlongspearhead.

When the baron did so, Reinhart could \nsee that he held no object in his hand at d; \nthe insmment held aloft was the man’s hand. \nsorts of hand-held weapons. \nTurning a limb into a weapon with this power costs one Blood Trait, two \nTraits for two-handed weapons. Only hand weapons may be imitated - \nyou \ncannot fashion a bow and arrows out of your body. \nThis power costs nine Expenence Traits. \nDARK \nSTEEL \n(Intermediate Obtenebratiun, Intermediate Potence) \n“You hide from me in darkness, ” Adrienne sighed, her lilting voice carrying into the \nrocky niche where Michael hid, halfway up the cold mountainside. “How quaint.” \n\n\nMichael almost shot back that he would sooner be wed to a fishmonger’s spotty \ndaughter than to the blasphemous parody of a woman Adrienne had become, but a sound \noutside his hiding place stopped him. Something long and heawy slid along the ground \noutside. It sounded like someone dragging a tree. \n“But you denied me, Michael,” Adrienne went on. “You should hawe run sooner and \nfarther.” As she spoke, a column of ebon smoke (or so it seemed to Michael) snaked into his \nshelter and coiled around h ankle like an iron manacle. He shrieked, and the black tentacle \nhoisted him roughly out of the hole and into the air. He dangkd upside down like an animal \ncaught in a snare, blubbenng in terror as Adrienne - \nbeautiful, damned Adrienne - \nemergedfrm the shadows. The tentacle around Michael’s foot curried him closer w her. \n“Now, Michael, let us talk of Hell and the fury that only it can cowet.” \nPerhaps one of the most fearsome combination powers known, Dark Steel \nimbues the shades of Obtenebration with the unnatural might of Potence. Shade \ntentacles conjured with the Arms of Ahriman become frighteningly strong. \nShould you choose to use Dark Steel, you must expend a Blood Trait upon \nactivating Arms of Ahriman. Summoning the tentacles themselves proceeds as \nusual, but the tentacles have six Physical Traits, plus two more Physical Traits for \neach additional Blood Trait expended. \nLearning this power requires the expenditure of nine Expm‘ence Traits. \nHATCHTHE \nVIPER \n(Basic Protean, Intermediate Seeentis) \n“Bring him before me,” Gillem proclaimed, motioning the guards to stand back and \nlet the wisitorstepforward. “I will hear this blackguard’s message in the prince’s absence. \nIt is better than he deserwes, certainly.” \nThe wisitur, a suspected Follower of Set, strode forward, smiling audaciously at the \nprince’s seneschal, ewen winking at Gillem! The pnnce’s courtiers tittered at that, but \nnone of them showed the proper decorum by deigning to scoff. Gillem made a note to \nhimself that it was time for new attendants. The pnnce would have to be made aware of \nthat when he returned. \n“You have a message?” the seneschal asked, when the alleged Setite stopped boldly \nin front ofhim.

The Follower of Set \nconcentrates his vitae and forms it into a serpentine ghoul, which he vomits forth \nin a horrifying gout of scaly flesh. \n\n\nA full turn of concentration must precede the birth of a serpent, and you must \nexpend two Blood Traits. The serpent is considered a ghoul and exhibits the Foratude \nDiscipline at the level of Endurance. With a poisonous bite, the viper can be deadly \nto mortals; it is considered to possess the Physical Traits: Lithe x2 and Qwck x2. If the \nserpent is not fed one Blood Trait every week, it dissolves into poisonous blood-like \nbile that causes two health levels of damage to anyone foolish enough to drink it. \nYou may sustain more than one serpent, but each must be fed blood if it is to \nsurvive. Serpents created with this power typically display distinctive patterns and \npersonalities that may be traced to their creator. Your Storyteller can issue a card \nrepresenting your ghoulish serpents. \nThis power costs nine Expenence Traits. \nT H E  ILLNESS \nUNVEILED \n(Basic Ausgex, Master Fortitude) \n“Heismostgnevously ill,” the hermitsaid, leaningover thesickchild’s body tospeak \nto his mother. “You are wise to have brought hzm to me.” \n“I thankyou, but theysayyouservetheDevil,”Magdastammered, \nunsettledby thehermit’s \ngaze. “In the town, that is, sir. But not I.” The hermit only laughed at Magda’s dscomfort and \nlaul IS withered hands on her son’s forehead. He sard no prayers; he used no herbs; he dd not \neven light the fire beneath the iron pot in the comer of his cabin. The apothecary in topun s a d  that \nthts man could heal her son, but Magda grew m e  and more uneasy by the moment. \nThe boy suddenly broke out in a cold sweat, his legs twitching and kicking. His lips \nbared back from his teeth m a  snarl, and his back arched. Skll, the hermit said nothing; \nhe only stood with his gnarled, rootlike hands on the boy’s face. \nMagda’s eyes grew wzde - \nsurely this was not natural! The townsfolk were nght; \nthis hermit was in league with Satan. She wavered, then reached a tentatwe hand toward \nher son, the other makinga crude wardinggesture. The hermit’s wiry hands tlghtened on \nher son, and in one final gasp the boy lay silent. \n“Theworstispassing,” the hermitsadat last. Theoldmanlookedlikehehadexerted \nhimselfagreathal, but didnot seem to be breathinghard. “The boy willrecover in time.” \nThe hermit stood silent for a moment, then glanced up at Magda. As the woman put a \nhand on her son’s brow, the hermit grabbed her wnst. \n“And now,” he whispered, “kt us discuss my payment.” \nBy diagnosing a victim through the use of supernatural senses, and then sharing \nvampiric preternatural resilience, it is possible to help mortals through the throes of \ndangerous diseases. In an age rife with plagues and sickness, this is a very useful ability \nfor keeping one’s retainers alive (especially for the Cappadocians, whose Lamia \nservitors have an unfortunate tendency to pass on rather hideous and fatal infections). \nYou must make a Static Mental Challenge (difficulty eight Traits) in order to \ndiagnose a disease successfully; this diagnosis is subject to the limitations of your \nMedicine knowledge. Once you diagnose a disease, you may bolster the victim’s \nresistance with your own. Make a Static Physical Challenge with a difficulty \ndetermined by the nature of the disease: five Traits for a common cold, up to nine \nfor typhoid and 12,15 or more for particularly nasty afflictions such as Black Plague \n(the Lamia disease rates 18 Traits). A successful challenge allows the victim to \nbegin recovering, although the process may still take days or weeks. \nThis power costs 10 Expenence Trazts to learn. \n\n\nR E T A I N T H E  QUICK \nBLOOD \n(Intermediate Celerity, Intermediate Quietus) \nRight now, I am “feeding. ” I appeared in silence and scythed through the gwcrds and \nretainers ofthis city’s prince OM hour ago, only to use up the last ofmy vitae before laying \ninto my “true” quarry. I barely escaped the pnnce’s chambers before he called for \nreinforcements; the fact that I had to leave clues as to my destination only made matters \ndoubly difficult. Now the city’s “sheriff‘ - \none Eric Fit?-Walter - \ncomes for me, \nconfident in the assumption that I stalk the streets for kine blood before I can make good \nmy escape. He has beenstompingaroundjust out ofsight since his shockedprince ordered \nmeapgrehended. I have hadno chance tostopandfeed, and this sheriffdoubtlessly believes \nI am at the end of my reserves. He is so confident. Wouldn’t he be surprised to know that \neven as I slow to wait for him, my strength returns of its own accord? Wouldn’t he be \nsurpnsed to learn that his very prince hired me to “get the bothersome Mister Fit?-Walter \nout of the way”? I think he would. Ah, he approaches. Perhaps I will ask him. \nThe fearsome Assamites are capable of maintaining the power of their vitae, \neven after calling upon their blood for the preternatural speed of Celerity. An \nAssamite can cause the blood that energizes his limbs to trickle slowly back into \nhis system to be spent again. \nWhen using this power, all Blood Traits expended for Celerity in a given \nconflict return after an hour. Should you ingest additional blood during this period, \nany returning blood that would exceed your normal Blood Trait limit is lost. Thus, \nif a vampire with a full blood pool expends two Traits of blood for Celerity, then \ndrinks a single Blood Trait, the returning vitae simply grants one Blood Trait - \nthe second returning Trait is lost because the vampire is already at the limit of his \nblood capacity. Returning blood “wasted” in this fashion literally seeps out of the \nvampire’s pores and tear ducts - \na disturbing sight indeed. \nMastery of this power requires the expenditure of eight Experience Traits. \nSHADOWED \nBYES \n(Intermediate Auspex, Intermediate Obtenebration) \nRudolphandGeraldstudied the body that lay by the crossroads. It was Lord Albert’s, \nfor certain. They had been given the “demon’s” description in painstaking detail by the \nbishop. Rut rather thanfind the rampaging terror ofthe nighted countryside (as they’d been \ntold) , they found this lifeless, unmoving corpse. Apparently, either the rumms were all \nfalse or the villagers had dealt with their own probkm.

And why \ndidn’t anybody tell us when we got in? And why ha’en’t wolves been at the body if he’s \nbeen dead a while!” \nGerald stood next to his longtime partner. As they talked, neither noticed Lord \nAlbert’s “corpse” stir. The vampire sat up silently. The pools ofblackness fell away from \nhis eyes like water drainingfrom a bath. Outraged by Gerald’s insult, Albert wiped the \nspit from his face and stood to his full height, a blood-song singing in his ears. \n“Mighty hunters,” he sneered. “Here is your prey.” \nC O M B I N E D  DISCIPLINES \nEOR THE  LON^ N I ~ H T  \ne \n\n\nough any Magister can see through the blackness created with his own use \ntebration, the blinding and smothering effects of the darkness disorient foes. \nL Lasombra needs to discomfit an opponent without relying upon blatant \nof shadow-shaping, precise control is required, as evidenced by this power. \nien you invoke Shadowed Eyes (at the cost of one Physical Trait), you \n2 small patches of blackness that surround the eyes of your target.

They are filled withfaith in their only-god, and they believe that they willrout this \nvampire with nothing more than piety and torches. They are fools. \nWe crest the hill - \nthe mob and I - \nand the vampire pee ts us from the battlements \nofhis stronghold. He has the gall to wave as we come boilingover the crest likefire-bearing \nants; he has even left hisgate open in mockinginvitation. Were I like the others in this mob, \nI might be afraid at his cavalier fearlessness, but I am not like the others. I understand my \nenemy. I alone have any power over him. \nAs the mob comes within bowshot ofthe stronghold, the vampire suddenly s t a d  up \nstraight and lifts his a m ,  as if to welcome us. Many within the mob shout insults or \ncondemnations, and most gesture angrily with their torches. I do not. I carry no torch. \nMoments later, a mass of black shapes erupts from just behind the vampire and streams \ntowardus. Oneamongthemobshouts, “Bats,” but1 know better. The blackshapesarrow \nstraight for the torches, extinguishing the flames like vile black rain. \nInstantly, the night closes in on us and the mob erupts into chaos. Not I. I lift my \nhead and shout defiance. I needed the others to lead me here. Now I shift down to four \nclawed feet and dart through the mass of terrified humans to the open gate. The blood- \ndrinker will be mine. \nMobile, “living” shadows are the hallmark of the Obtenebration Discipline, but \nwith this power, you can send batlike shades to extinguish offending light sources \n- \ntorches, lamps, candles and such. The shadows flit about, surrounding and \nsmothering the brightest lights in the area, plunging the place into darkness. \nYou must see (or otherwise sense) the light source that you wish to extinguish \nwith this power. Each Mental Trait expended causes a shadow to seek out and \nextinguish one flame or light, up to the size of a torch. Particularly large flames may \nbe susceptible to multiple shadows, at the Storyteller’s discretion. These shadows \nhave actual physical substance. Though they cannot injure, they can certainly \nstartle and confuse; shadows summoned without a target flap about, causing noise \nand bumping into things for the duration of the conflict (or 10 minutes). \nThis power costs five Experience Traits to learn. \n\n\n* \ni \nt \nANY MOTHFR’S CHILD \nby Carl Bowen \nInspired by a Vampire character created by Hannah Curry \nWe intend to include a piece of World of Darkness fiction in every issue of the Journal. \nWe hope to showcase talented new writers (one of whom I am not - \nnew, that is) who might \nnot have a chance to appear elsewhere.

This piece, in particular, serves as a look at how derangements driwe characters to \ndangerous, thoughtless deeds, yet can sometimes serwe to make them all too human. \nThe mother grabbed her daughter by the collar a bit too roughly and pulled her \nclose. People pressed in on all sides, crowding to get on the trains that would take them \naway from the war-blighted countryside to one of the ghetto-towns. The mother feared \nlosing her daughter in the crowd. They had been marched to the train yard days away \nfrom their home, and not once had the woman let her daughter out ofher sight. The girl \ntold her mother that she was supposed to get on a different train, but the mother didn’t \nlisten. She stoically led her daughter to her own train- the trainshe should be boarding \nwith her husband and son - \ndetermined that she would keep the girl with her. \nDmitri, the father, had to fight. He had to demand that the soldiers leave them alone. \nThe soldiers took the boy first; a soldier shot him through the head as Dmitri stared in mute \nhorror. Dmitri fell next as his wife and daughter looked on. It all happened so fast that the \nmother had no chance to do anything before the soldiers restrained her. They would \nprobably have killed Dmitri anyway, but if he hadn’t tried to fight them, perhaps.. .. \nNow, the mother would not be left alone. She clamped a vise-like hand on her \ndaughter’s shoulder and moved toward her own train. She would not raise her coming \nunborn child alone. The soldiers would not tell them why they were being herded and \nprodded. They were not even Jewish as many of the shouting, jeering soldiers seemed \nto think, but there seemed to be no reason other than random chance why she and her \ndaughter should be split up. Perhaps if she got her daughter onto the train with her \nbefore the soldiers noticed.. . . \nA sharp blow to the back sent the mother sprawling, dragging her daughter to \nthe ground with her. She turned to see a soldier towering over her with his rifle \nupraised, his body silhouetted in the last red rays of sunset. He shouted at her in his \nlanguage that sounded like barking dogs, then pointed at the girl. The mother \nclutched her daughter tighter with one hand and put the other to her stomach. \nThe soldier brought the rifle stock down on her again, sending screaming \nwhite non-images through her brain. He shouted and pointed again, looking even \nmore like a barking dog, his billowing winter-breath like an enraged canine’s froth. \nOthers of his pack gathered around, pushing back people who tried to see what was \ngoing on. One of the soldiers grabbed the woman’s daughter and tried to pull her \nto her feet. The girl clutched more tightly to her mother. \nA N Y  MOTHER’S CHILD \n@ \n\n\nThe screaming soldier brought the rifle down again, still shouting his unintelligible \nlanguage, and the world went dark. Or perhaps the sun finally set. The mother could not tell. \nv\nr\n \nThe woman almost catches the lone girl, but the orphan is clever and eludes \ncapture. The woman looks in trashdumpsters andglances occasionally at creaking fire \nescapes, but the girl is nowhere to be found. Surely she does not think that the woman \nwould hurt her? She only wants to take care of the child. To give her a home and family \nagain. To protect her. This is no place to be alone. \nv\nv\n \nThe mother awoke in a cold tent with a bandage above her left eye and a \nfrightening soreness beneath her stomach. She heard the muted sound of the \nsoldiers’ barking outside, and she could see that the sun had long since set. The air \nstill smelled like crowds and machine oil, so she knew she was in the train yard, but \nshe wondered why she had not been packed unconscious onto one of the trains. \nThe woman lifted her head stiffly and looked around for her daughter. The girl \nwas not in the tent. Perhaps that was why the woman had not been moved. Maybe \nher daughter had been sent on ahead. Alarmed, the woman called out the girl’s name. \n“She has not been harmed,” a voice assured her in broken Polish. “She is \nwaiting. Calm yourself.” \nThe woman turned, sore muscles protesting, to find a tall soldier slouching just \ninside the tent flap. He wore a long leather coat, belted at the waist, with a bent-edged \ncross on a red arm band below his left shoulder. He removed his hat, smoothed his \nclose-cut blond hair and crouched down beside her. Reluctantly, she calmed down. \n“You put up fight,” the man said, his sparkling blue eyes boring into her with \nan unsettling fascination. “Why?” \nCertainly, she hadn’t been the only one to do so. Why had this soldier singled her out? \n“Where is my daughter?” \n“Yes, I see,” the man nodded, apparently understanding only the last two \n“My daughter ...” \n“Yes, yes,” the man said. He lay a hand absently on the woman’s leg, where it \nshowed through a rip in her skirt. “I keep you together somewhere else. You will \nnot go the bad towns with the cattles.” \nThe woman said nothing; she only shivered in dread. Her daughter would be \nreturned to her and they would be spared whatever fate awaited those who rode the trains, \nbut they would survive on the mercy of this man. This man with his unsettling eyes. The \nwoman squirmed in the grasp he had on her leg. His hand was unnaturally cold, even in \nthe winter air. What was more, his breath did not make white clouds when he spoke. \nwords of the woman’s answer. “Loyalty is most noble, no?” \nThe old woman stops her search and stands alone in the middle of the street. Young \npeople on either side pause to look at her (this strange, frantic creature wearing outdated, \nshapeless homespun). They move on without interest when she fails to amuse them. \nM I N D ’ S  \nE Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n\n\n-+? \ni \ne \nShe has lost sight of the orphan-child. It is not the first time -she has birthed \nmany children who fled her or fell from grace - \nbut each is still heart-breaking in \nits own way. Why must they always go? Why can none of them trust her and stay \nwith her when all she wants to do is protect them and take care of them? Not even \nher friends - \nthose too old to be her children- \nbelieve her capable of this. Why? \nAnd where is the child? Doesn’t she know that the soldiers are out there right \nnow, lying in wait to take her unawares? \nv\nv\n \nThe woman did not see the tall blond man again for several months. The \nmorning after she and her daughter were reunited, a truck full of leering, slavering \nsoldiers arrived and packed them off to an encampment miles from their home. \nWhen they arrived, a kapo - \na rail-thin, balding man who sneered behind the \nbacks of the soldiers, though he treated the prisoners no less roughly - \ntook them \nto a cramped tent behind a ramshackle barracks and ordered them to remain there \nuntil summoned. He spoke only the barking language, but his angry gestures and \nthe short cudgel he was allowed to carry said enough. \nThey stayed, clinging to each other wordlessly, until the kapo returned. He \nordered the mother to stand and follow him, which she did with trembling knees. \nShe whispered to her child to stay in the tent until she came back, and the kapo hit \nher across the mouth. Clamping a powerful hand around her elbow, he dragged her \naway from her child. Her unborn baby gave a feeble kick, and was still. \nThe woman stops and listens to the night wind. The barren street rustles with \ndiscarded litter and scurrying, furtive footsteps, but no one reveals himself in the \ngarish pink-orange of the streetlights. The child is gone, but now someone follows \nthe woman. Faint footsteps begin to grow louder and more distinct, and someone \ncalls her name from a great distance. Panicking, the woman darts away in the \ndirection she last saw the child. She must find the girl before the other one - \nthe \none in pursuit - \ntries to take her. The woman has done too much, suffered too \nmuch, to let anyone take the child now. She hears the crying of a lost and lonely \nsoul, and she homes in on it like an arrow. The child will be safe; she will see to that. \nv\nv\n \nFor the next few months, the woman lived in Hell. Every day, sometimes as many \nas five or six times, the kapo dragged her to yet another of the dog-soldiers to be abused. \nLife so far from the front, in the harsh winter climate, had stoked raging furnaces in the \nsoldiers’ hearts. When there were no men to kill, the woman served as that rage’s only \nvent. Aside from her daughter, she was the only female for miles, and “subhuman” (as \nthey told her she was) or not, she filled a niche. \nIn the first weeks, whenever she came into the presence ofa soldier who had not yet \nseen her, she would beg him to not hurt her. She pleaded on behalf of her unborn child; \nshe cried out of her own fear; she pleaded that if she died, no one would take care of her \ndaughter. Nothing changed the soldiers’ minds. Those who even understood her only \nlaughed or beat her. The woman eventually learned not to beg. It brought only more \nabuses and punishments, and the very mention of her daughter brought frightening, \nA N Y  M O T H E R ’ S  CHILD \n\n\nlascivious looks to the men’s faces. By the end of the second month, she had learned to \nnot cry or show fear at all. When the baby she was carrying died at the beginning of the \nthird month, she did not even shed a tear, though the pain and anguish wrenched her \ninto an immobile ball for days after the aborted delivery. She watched as the barking \nsoldiers casually tossed the dead thing that should have been a child into a refuse pile, and \nshe did not cry. When she heard the jokes the soldiers made - \nthe most popular one \nasking if the “roadblock” had been cleared - \nshe pretended she did not understand. \nThe only thing that still had any effect on her at all was the safety of her still-living \ndaughter. The girl was 14 and developing quickly for her age. The woman saw how the \nsoldiers leered at her. She commanded her daughter to remain in the filthy, flimsy tent \nthey shared at all costs, lest the soldiers’ glances result in something more serious. The \ndaughter - \nwithdrawing into her own shell of depression, fear and silence - \nalways \nagreed. However, the woman knew that the soldiers were getting tired of having their \nfun with her alone. Soon, she would be the one left behind cowering in the tent when \nthe kapo came. The woman knew she could not allow that. She had only to look at her \ndaughter’s hollow eyes, hear the stifled sobs she tried to hide as they slept on their \nunclean pallet, to know she must protect her child at all costs. \nThe pursuing footsteps are just two comers away as the woman catches up to the \nchild at last. The child sits looking up at her from the darkened front stoop of a \ncondemned tenement building. Her large green eyes stare out from a dirty face, wide \nand dancing in fear. The woman stops her crazed sprint and closes the last distance \nbetween herself and the frightened child at a cautious walk. The child has nowhere \nelse to run, so she huddles into a tight ball, scrawny knees clutched to her frail chest. \nThe woman comes closer slowly, her eyes still alight from the chase. The \nsoldier’s footsteps are near, but she proceeds with caution. If she scares the child \naway, she willsurely flush the frightened thing right into the soldier’s arms. She lifts \nher hands peacefully and speaks. \n“I will not let them harm you, precious one. They are coming, but they will \nnot take you.” \nThe woman’s daughter looked at her with undisguised fear. “What do you mean, \nmother?” Her mother had been sitting quietly for hours since the kapo last returned \nher to the tent. The sun had descended and set, yet the older woman had said nothing. \n‘‘I heard the soldiers laughing as I left their barracks. The kapo will come for \nyou in the morning.” \n“What do you mean?’ the girl whispers. She is too frightened to speak any louder. \n“DO not be afraid,” the woman says, placing a gentle hand on the girl’s dirty \nface and gazing at her with unspeakable pity. “They will not come before you and \nI have finished.” \nM I N D ’ S  \nB Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n4D \n\n\n“Finished with what?” her daughter asked, shaken by the strange look in her \nmother’s eyes. She did not know exactly where the kapo takes her mother each day, \nbut she knew why. Over the months, she had seen the toll such treatment had \ntakenon the older woman. The life had long since vanished from her mother’s eyes. \nThe girl shivered and huddled against the thin fabric of the tent. \n“Don’t be afraid,” her mother said, taking off her dirty, threadbare scarf. “Put this on.” \nThe orphan recoils as the strange woman takes the ancient shawl from around \nher shoulders and places it around the girl’s, but she cannot move away. The \nintensity of the woman’s brown eyes pins her. \n“What’s this for? I don’t know you.” \nv\nv\n \nThe woman flinched at that, but she did not back away. “It will be cold,” she \nsaid. “They’re coming for you. Put this on.” \nHer daughter obeyed meekly, and the woman slipped the scarf around her neck \nand under her dark-brown hair. She wrapped it twice and laid the ends between the \nvague curves of the girl’s budding breasts. As her daughter sat uncomfortably looking \nat her, the woman held the ends lightly between her fingers. \nv\nv\n \n“You’re scaring me,” the girl says, swallowing and stretching her slender neck \nuncomfortably. She looks past the woman’s shoulder and sees someone come into \nview down the alley. The woman doesn’t seem to notice. \n“They’re coming,” the woman says again. “They don’t want me this time. \nThey want you.” \n“Who?” the girl says. “Who are they?” \n“They’re devils,” the woman tells her, her hands closing over the ends of the \nscarf. “They’re through with me, and now they want to take you. They can’t \nterrorize me any more, but they know you’re still afraid of them.” \nAt that moment, the girl was more afraid of her mother than any soldier, and \nshe leaned back, trying to put distance between the two of them. Her mother only \nbent closer, pulling uncomfortably on the ends of the scarf. \n“They cannot take you.” \nv\nv\n \n“No one’s coming,” the girl says, gulping audibly under the edge of the \nwoman’s shawl. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. No one’s trying to take \nme anywhere.” \nThe strange woman with the flying, wild brown hair and the intense brown \neyes only sighs. \nA N Y  M O T H E R ’ S  CHILD \n\n\n“It’s all right, my dearest. I won’t let them.” She looks down, and absently lays \na hand aside her stomach. \nv\nv\n \n“Please,” the daughter said, her voice a bit thin. Her green eyes flashed and \n“Be quiet now, sweetheart.” \n“Everything will be fine.” \nThe girl’s eyes bulge and her hands shoot to her neck, but her fingers only \npluck at the fabric there before falling back to rest meekly in her lap. The woman \nhears a vague sound like running steps, but knows it is only her heartbeat \nthundering in her ears. Or perhaps her daughter’s heartbeat. It is so hard to tell. \nThe girl sits upright in one last spasm, and her chin jerks up to the hazy night \nsky. The mother wonders briefly if she can see the gates of Heaven as it is rumored \nthose trapped in Hell can do. \n“You are free, little one,” she whispers. “They will not find you. They cannot \ntake you.” She holds the child to her chest and cradles her, a tear of bitter triumph \ntracing a line down her nose and falling on the girl’s face. \nshowed the whites. She gulped even louder. \nv\nv\n \nv\nv\n \nThe mother covered her daughter’s cold body with the thin sheet they had to \nshare at night, and turned to leave her tent. The dog soldiers would probably kill \nher, but she was not afraid. She had not been for months. Maybe the kapo would \nbe the first one to find her and deal with her. The best part about being in Hell, she \nknew, was that there were always devils close by if you needed them. \nAs she exited the tent and took a deep, cold breath, the woman found herself \nproven right. There before her stood the tall, blond soldier she hadn’t seen in \nmonths. He looked exactly the same, down to the folds in his long, belted leather \njacket. The band on his arm blazed a fierce red, drawing her eyes to the bent-edged \ncross in the center. She was almost glad. \nThe soldier glanced into the tent at the body of the child and cocked a thin \nyellow eyebrow. His blue eyes sparkled with amazement. \n“A relation of yours?’! he asked. His accent was still horrible, but he seemed \nto have acquired a better grasp of Polish. Or maybe the mother had gained a better \nunderstanding of the dog soldiers’ barking language. \n“Most interesting.” He came a step closer to the woman and put a hand on her \nshoulder. He backed her easily into the tent and sat her down on the ground beside \nthe pallet. The woman only stared past the tall soldier into the night, as if unaware \nof where she was. \nThe soldier lifted the woman’s chin. She shivered at the unnatural cold of his \nskin, but moved her head as she was bid. This man was more gentle than the other \nsoldiers in the camp, but the woman didn’t notice. He leaned closer to her and \ntouched her neck with the tip of his dry tongue. The woman could feel her pulse \nwhere the man touched her. She was calm. Her daughter was safe. \nM I N D ’ S  \nE Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n\n\nThe soldier mumbled something like a blessing, and the woman’s neck \nburned. She closed her eyes. Maybe the man was an angel sent to take her from this \nplace to be with her family again. \nv\nv\n \nSomeone shakes the woman roughly from behind, and she opens her eyes. She \nturns to see a familiar man looking at her with anxiety. White clouds huff from his \nmouth as his breath freezes in the chill air. \n“I’ve been trying to find you for hours,” the man says. He runs his hand \nunconsciously through his long black hair and nervously tucks it into the collar of \nhis stylish overcoat. His cheeks flush red from exertion and the cold, and he looks \nover his shoulder continuously. “What are you doing in this part of town?” \n“She is safe,” the woman answers dreamily. ‘‘I had to protect her from the \nsoldiers. They would have come for her in the morning.” \nThe man stares at her in confusion, his eyebrows drawn down into one black \nline. He shakes her shoulders roughly and says, “English. Speak English.” \nThe woman blinks and tries to concentrate. Her friend hates it when she slips \ninto her native tongue. She glances over her shoulder at the heap sprawled in the \ntenement doorway. ‘‘I was making sure-” \nThe man, her friend Alex, the one who takes care of her as she sleeps, looks \npast her at the body. His brown eyes widen and his jaw goes slack. \n“Who is this child?” \n“My daughter,” the woman says, smiling with remembered pride. “She is so \nbeautiful and pure. She is safe now.” \nAlex only gulps audibly and shakes his head. “We have to leave before \nsomeone finds us. Or her.” \n“It doesn’t matter,” the woman says, focusing on Alex for the first time. “She \nis safe. That is all I care about.” \n“Come on,” Alex says, pulling the woman forward into astumbling walk. “We \nmay have to leave the city for good this time. Drake is tired of cleaning up after your \nmesses. Did I tell you he ordered me to put you to Final Death if you did something \nlike this again?” \n“If it is what you want, Alex,” the woman says, still looking back at the body. \n“I haven’t seen Dmitri for a while. It would be nice to talk to him again.” \nSighing, Alex pulls the woman deeper into the city, toward the nearest \nsubway entrance. He could no more kill her than he could kill himself. He would \nsooner face the wrath of all the city’s elders than live with the shame of causing the \nwoman any harm. \nHopefully Drake will be able to cover this up, he thinks. He has done so before in \nworse situations. I doubt he’ll even miss the two of us. \nThe woman shambles off after Alex dreamily. Alex will take care of her. He \nalways has. And she has taken care of him. She would never let anything happen to \nhim. No matter what dangers may come, she will make sure he stays safe with her. \nA N Y  MOTHER’S CHILD \ne \n\n\nof the central Circle; having familiar elements introduce or elaborate on new plot \nthreads increases the drama and believability of the game. Plus, employing existing \ncharacters to drive this plot offers direct motivation for the players’ characters to \nget involved, and it makes the players feel like active participants in the develop- \nment of events. Still, we include profiles for significant participants at the end of \neach installment in case you need to fill any holes. \nA final note: The three parts of Mayday! mix and match with your existing \ngame. You could wait until all three parts are released, then play them all together \nas a series, or you could play each part as it comes out in the Journal, separating \nepisodes with events from your own chronicle. \nPlayers, everythingpast this point IS Storyteller material. If youdon’t want to spoil \nthe surprise or clue yourself in before you actually play the game, read no further. \nP A R T  O N E :  AMBASSADOR \nS U ~ C ~ E S T I O N S  \nRunning this installment of Mayday! in your live-action chronicle requires only \none Storyteller character who does not already exist in your game: Tadashi Nakagawa. \nOther useful characters for this plot include an “acquaintance” - \nbe he a diplomatic \nenvoy to the Jade Kingdom or simply the first Necropolis guard to spot Nakagawa- \nwho introduces Nakagawa to the Circle; a secretive Heretic, should the Circle be able \nto locate the wraith from the “list” they find in the course of action; various members \nof officious Hierarchy bureaucracy; and even a Renegade or two. \nProps for this installment of Mayday! include representations of the box \nTadashi Nakagawa carries, as well as of the items in the box. \nS C E N E  O N E  \nHARD \nINEO \nThe Circle is introduced to (or comes across, if there are no existing allies or \nacquaintances to make introductions) Tadashi Nakagawa, a Jade wraith who claims to \nbe on an ambassadorial trip to the higher-ups of the Necropolis. Nakagawa appears \nyoung, andisunfailinglypolite. Hecarriesarelic boxabout thesizeofadepartment-store \ngift box. He does not open the box and does not give any information about its contents. \nAfter approximately 10 minutes of play (or if the characters become \ninexcusably rude), Nakagawa bows and walks away, leaving the characters alone. \nThe acquaintance (should there be one) leaves with Nakagawa. \nThe Circle might be polite and friendly; any courtesy or goodwill the \nwraiths show Nakagawa is reciprocated. \nDependingon the individual characters, they might offer to takeNakagawa \nto the Hierarchy. Nakagawa declines such help. \nIf the Circle is belligerent or antagonistic, the Jade wraith simply makes \ngraceful excuses and leaves quickly. No matter how rude the Circle wraiths \nbecome, their attempts to bully or intimidate Nakagawa are unproductive. \nM I N D ’ S  \nB Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n\n\nS C E N E  \nTwo \nH A R D  I N E O  \nShortly after leaving the Circle, the Jade wraith drops into a Harrowing as \none of his Fetters is destroyed suddenly (by an unknown attacker, as revealed in part \nthree of this chronicle). The box does not go with him into the Harrowing. \nThe box comes into the possession of the Circle, either delivered or found. \nIt contains a relic wakizasht (Japanese short sword) with a foreign sigil carved into \nthe hilt, a page of jotted notes and a list of names and locations. \nThe notes read: “Find optimal points; solidify alliances; look for the \nunblinking.” \nThe list of names and locations refers to local Heretics and their Haunts. \nMost of the Heretics on the list are both high-Status and high-secrecy. The \nrevelation that the names on the list are those of Heretics should come as \nsomething of a surprise to the wraiths, especially if the names are those of covert \nHeretics who already exist in your game. \nIf a character takes the waktzasht out of the box and keeps it on his person \nfor more than 10 minutes of game time, he begins to accumulate Temporary Angst \ndue to a strong taint on the weapon. This effect should not be immediately obvious \nto the character, since the taint is subtle and seductive. The character is eventually \nsubject to Catharsis. \nC H O I C E S  \nThe characters may choose to not open the box, taking it directly to the \nauthorities instead. \nThe Circle might wait until Nakagawa comes back from his Harrowing and \nmakes his way back to the Necropolis, and then try to interrogate him. This is \nsomewhat problematic, since Nakagawa’s Fetters are far away, and who knows \nwhat kind of red tape he’ll run into when he appears back in the Jade Empire? \nThey open the box. If any of the characters have Heretic status, they may \nmake Static Mental Challenges to see if they recognize any of the names. A few \nnames might be known to characters with high Hierarchy status. Again, not all of \nthe names should be those of recognized Heretics. However, the names are all those \nof Heretics. \nIf the Circle decides to investigate the names itself, trying to find out what’s \ngoing on, the Heretics should be difficult to find. Should the Circle find any of \nthem, the Heretics attempt to take the box and might well try to send the \ncharacters into Oblivion for “knowing too much.” \nShould the group decide to head to the Hierarchy for help, it’s in for a rough \ntime. Unless one or more of the wraiths has at least two, if not three, Hierarchy \nStatus Traits, the entire group is given the run-around until members explicitly \nrefer to the Heretics by name or show someone the list. The Hierarchy is extremely \nsuspicious: The functionary who sees the Circle takes the box and interrogates the \ncharacters intensely. If the characters play their cards right, the Hierarchy lets \nthem go z but not without setting a nigh-constant watch on them. Clumsy or \nbelligerent roleplaying gets the wraiths in serious trouble: a fight, perhaps, or \nattempts to imprison, enslave or even soulforge them. The trouble should be \nescapable, though, to keep the story moving. \nMAYDAY! \n\n\nIf the characters hold onto the box and tell no one about it, parties from both \nthe Heretics and the Hierarchy come looking for it - \nnews of relics, especially \ninteresting or powerful ones, travels fast - \nand interrupt anything the Circle might \nattempt. The Hierarchy wants the box from a purely materialistic standpoint; it doesn’t \nknow exactly what’s in it yet. The Heretics want the potentially damning list of names \ndestroyed and all wimesses eliminated. \nThe Circle could go to the Renegades for protection. This course of action \noccurs at the Storyteller’s discretion, but the Renegades may be the characters’ best \nhope for physical protection and allies. \nThis installment of the story should effectively end with the Circle’s decision \nabout what to do with the information and the resulting brouhaha. These events \ncan take all evening to play, given good roleplaying and strong characters. \nSo ends Part I of Mayday! Look for Part 11: Deployment in the next issue of the \nJournal. The following is a “skin and bones” cheat-sheet of suggested Traits and a \nbackground sketch for Tadashi Nakagawa. \nTHE \nAMBASSADOR \nT H E  SKIN \nTadashi Nakagawa either meets or is introduced to the Circle early in this \ninstallment of Mayday!, and his involvement in the wraiths’ afterlives has an effect \nonatlofStygia. Butwho ishe? Attheriskofgivingaway toomuch tooearly,Nakagawa \nis a Jade wraith on a unique and dangerous mission. He has been entrusted with a \nspecific responsibility, and he does not stop or be deterred by normal means. \nIn life, Nakagawa was little more than what we in the 20th century would call \na “number-cruncher” or a “bean-counter,” but he always took his work seriously \n(perhaps even a bit too seriously). In death, he is a pawn of a higher power, but his \nmission is of the utmost importance to him. Nothing sways him from his course; \nnot even the Harrowing he undergoes when one of his Fetters is destroyed. \nT H E  BONES \np E R s o N A L  INFO R M A T I  o N \nName: Tadashi Nakagawa \nLife: Minor Functionary \nDeath: Heart Disease \nNature: Bureaucrat \nDemeanor: Architect \nRegret: Never expressed love to his wife and son \nM I N D ’ S  \nE Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n\n\nA R C A N O I  \nIntimation (all innates): The Gleaming, Deep Desiring, The Craving \nMoliate (all innates): Sculpt, Martialry \nOutrage (all innates): Wraithgrasp \nUsury (all innates): Transfer, Charitable Trust, Exchange Rate \nProtect the Empire (Duty) \nAdvise Wife and Extended Family (Love) \nKeep Records of Court History (Duty) \nGain Power (Greed) \n[Note: One Fetter, the teacup, is destroyed during the course of the game.] \nBrush with which he wrote at work \nAncestor shrine in his home \nTeacup given by his great-grandfather \nJade Court Status 2 \nLiving Family 1 \nWraith Family 2 \nThe Perfectionist \nPASSIONS \nEETTFRS \nBACKC~ROUNDS \nNAKAC~AWA’S p ’0 (SHADOW) \nDARK PASSIONS \nDestroy Family (Hate) \nUndermine Empire (Spite) \nTHORNS \nSpectre Prestige \nShadow Trait: Brutal \n\n\nERFQUFNTLY ASKFD \nQUFSTIONS \nThe constant evolution of Mind’s Eye Theatre bnngs new \nanddifferentquestions to thegame. Thismonth, we tacklequestions \nand comments about Laws of Elysium and the elder game, as well \nas a couple ofgeneral Trait questions. \nSend your Mind’s Eye Theatre questions to: \nWhite Wolf \nAttn: Mind’s Eye Theati-eloumal, Frequently AskedQuesaons \n735 Park North Blvd. \nClarkston, GA 30021 \ncarlawhite-wolf. com \nQ In JAWS \nof Elysium, Master-Level Dis- \nciplinesare available to eighth or lower generation \ncharacters. In the tabletop game, vampires get \nthe really powerful Disciplines only if they’re \nseventh generation or lower. What gives? \nA: Some troupes may wish to experiment \nwith the new Master-Level Disciplines without \nadding elder powerhouses to the game - \nfor \nthem, eighth- (or even ninth-) generation Kin- \ndred are good candidates for these powers. \nHowever, if a large game hosts a few true elders \n(seventh or lower generation), it’s generally a \ngood idea to keep the Master Disciplines in the \nhands of those puissant characters. These pow- \ners are supposed to be rare and forbidding, after \nall! The key is to make sure that the Disciplines \nare available if you want to use them, without \nmaking them commonly available to everyone. \nQ. The Thaumaturgy Path of Conjuring says that the vampire can’t summon \nanything larger or heavier than himself, including a LAW rocket, but LAW rockets \naren’t that big. Also, the Permanency power says that Conjured items must be returned \nphysically to their place of origin, when those items are really just created from nothing. \nA: The note about LAW rockets is pertinent to game balance. A conjurer can \ngenerate a stake, a sword or a vial of blood, but some things should be too difficult to \nmake (like high explosives or nuclear weapons). A good rule of thumb is to require the \nconjurer to have enough Abilities to actually build the item in question. Thus, the \nthaumaturge can’t conjure a pistol without a few levels of Repair and Firearms; he needs \na lot of Demolitions and Science to make explosives. Of course, simple items (like \nwooden stakes, metal bars and rocks) can be conjured without any special Abilities. \n\n\nPermanently conjured items are fully real and solid. The confusion here comes \nfrom the fact that mortal Conjuring (see Laws of the Hunt) simply moves objects \nwithout creating things. An object moved with mortal Conjuring must be taken \nback to its place of origin if the conjurer intends to return it. Conversely, an object \ncreated with the Thaumaturgy Path of Conjuring has no “place of origin” since it \nwas created from nothing. \nQ: How come the new Discipline level for Chimerstry looks suspiciously \nlike one of the old ones in Laws of the Night? \nA: Because the minor difference is in motion. Illusions created with Fata \nMorgana (second Basic Chimerstry) cannot move; they are wholly static, though \nthey can affect all of the senses. Illusions made with higher levels ofchimerstry can \nappear to move and interact with their surroundings. \nQ: How come modem gargoyles can’t fly while Dark Ages ones can? \nA: Did we leave that line out? Silly us. Modem gargoyles do have wings, and \nthey can fly. The gargoyle’s flight speed depends on his level of the Visceratika \nDiscipline; each level of the Discipline allows the gargoyle to fly 5 mph. \nQ: Can an Assamite with high levels of Occult Influence use that capacity \nto leam other sects’ rituals to get Thaumaturgy rituals using his Quietus \nDiscipline? \nA: What a strange and convoluted path. No, Quietus is not sufficient to learn \nrituals aside from the special Assamite ones. Thaumaturgy does not allow someone \nto leam Assamite rituals without Quietus, for that matter. \nQ: Are Bladed Hands (from the ritual of the same name) visible? \nA: No. When you invoke Bladed Hands, you become capable of cutting \nthrough things with your hands, but your limbs do not appear to change at all. \nDon’t pick your nose. \nQ: So what’s the real skinny on Spirit Thaumaturgy? According to some sources, \nit works on wraiths. According to others, it’s Umbral spirits. Which one is it? \nA: Spirit Thaumaturgy is designed to contact and control Umbral spirits. Of \ncourse, only tainted spirits would ever deal willingly with a vampire. For the sake of \nexpanding possibilities, Storytellers may allow Spirit Thaumaturgy to function against \nwraiths, but in general that’s the purview of the Necromancy Discipline. \nQ: How come there’s no Master-Level Thaumaturgy in Laws of Elysium? \nA: Well, technically, there isnoMasterLeve1 in the DisciplineofThaumaturgy. \n“What, then-” \nyou may ask, “-is \nthe meaning of the article on page 41 ?” In that \narticle, we use the term Master-Level more as a representative stroke than as a \ntechnical term. A master thaumaturge (like a pontifex, for instance) is more likely \nto have branched out into several different Thaumaturgical paths (or even created \nhis own) rather than perfected one to a higher level. However, there are some \nrituals that are available to only the most trusted, the most wise and the most \nrespected scholars of the clan, and those scholars can be considered thaumaturges \nof the Master Level. \n\n\nQ: OK, so if there are Lasombra antitribu, how come there are no Tzimisce \nuntitribu in Laws of Elysium, just Old Clan Tzimisce? \nA: Because there’s maybe something like one Tzimisce in the Camarilla. \nTzimisce antitribu are about as common as Salubri, and as such their differences \nfrom the main clan can’t be covered by generalities - \nthey are unique and \nextremely bizarre individuals. \nQ: Why didn’t the Ogham Discipline from The Long Night get an extra \nlevel in Laws of Elysium? \nA: Because Ogham is already a dying Discipline in 1198, and its powers are \nlimited. If you are absolutely fired up to have an additional level (perhaps for \nbalance purposes), try this: \nI N S C R I B E  T H E  C U R S E  ( S E C O N D  I N T E R M E D I A T E )  \nThe Lhiannan traces runic glyphs of a foe’s true name on her body, thus gaining \npower over that enemy. You must know your foe’s true name, and you must expend \ntwo Blood Traits to trace the unusual runes. The runes must be visible to the enemy \nin order to function, and you must make a Mental Challenge when you first engage \nyour opponent. The effects of the runes last until the runes are removed or until you \nsuffer two health levels of damage (thus obscuring them). \nYou may choose one of four effects for the runes: affecting the body renders the \nvictim impotent and unable to use Blood Traits; the mind causes the foe to suffer from \nthe Negative Traits: Oblivious x2; the voice makes the target mute; and affecting the \nsoul makes the opponent lose all ties in tests against frenzy. You may use only one rune \nat a time, so you can choose only one effect and impose it against one person. \n(Note: This power causes Ogham to have more Intermediate levels than Basic \nlevels. Such is the curse of trying to learn a dying Discipline - \nit’s hard!) \nQ: What are the Attribute Trait maximums for changelings and wraiths in \nThe Shining Host and Oblivion? \nA: In both cases, a character’s effective age comes into play. Obviously, most \nwraiths and changelings won’t beat up on elder vampires, so their Traits are not always \nas high.. . but an old and experienced character always has other tricks. \nFor changelings, the character’s seeming determines Trait maximums. \nChildlings are limited to 10 Traits in each category except Physical, for which they \ncan have no more than six Traits. Wilders can have up to 12 Traits in each \ncategory, and grumps may have up to 14 Traits in each category. A childling redcap \nwon’t bite any vampires in half, but watch out for elder trolls. \nWraiths are products of self-image. A wraith‘s personal characteristics are a \nreflection of the individual’s internalized self-perceptions. As a result, old wraiths \noften surpass the limits of their meat-bodies, taking themselves to new levels of \nability. Enfants (newly dead wraiths) are limited to 10 (just dead) or 11 (dead for \na few years) Traits in each category. Lemures (fairly old wraiths, maybe a few \ndecades in age) can have up to 12 or 13 Traits, while Gaunts (centuries-old \nwraiths) can have 14 or sometimes even more Traits. Players are unlikely to play \nwraiths older than young Lemures, though. A fair compromise is to allow a wraith \ncharacter to start with a limit of 10 Traits, but to improve to 11 and 12 after six \nmonths and one year of play, respectively. \n\n\n_I_ \n_I \nPLAY \nCONCENTRATE ON TH \nENCHAN 1 MEN I AND Atih-OLD MYSTERY - \nTHE WOR \nN G  nfE DREAMING. \nVG I . .
