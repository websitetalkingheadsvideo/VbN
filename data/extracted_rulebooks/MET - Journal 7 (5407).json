      "text": "w E LCO M E! \nHello again, everybody, and welcome to the seventh issue of the MET \nJournal! For those of you who are new to the publication, let me take a second \nto acquaint you with just what you’ve got here. (For those of you who already \nknow, you may skip ahead to Cynthia’s article on staying in character.) \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gaps in \nyour White Wolf LARP environment. We offer rules for new character types, \noriginal story lines to work into your chronicles, guides for keeping your games \nunder control and running smoothly and rules updates you won’t find in any \nother Mind’s Eye release. Plus, you’ll find answers to the questions that have \nplagued you, original World of Darkness fiction and columns from people \nwho’ve been LARPing or working here at White Wolf (or both) for years. \nIn this issue, we delve into the acting side of live-action roleplaying. \nCynthia Summers and Matthew Hooper provide insight on how to truly make \nyour character come to life on the mobile stage of roleplaying. On the other end \nof the spectrum, I offer rules for fomori and slip in the heretical Dharma rules \nthat didn’t make it into Laws of the East. And that’s just a sample of what’s \nin store for you here. We’ll also take a look at what you’ve missed in previous \nissues (if you’re joining us late) and what to expect in the future of Mind’s Eye \nTheatre and White Wolf in general. \nIn the next issue of the Journal, we’ll finish up Laura Hanson’s series on \ncostuming, I’ll say a few words about running a LARP chronicle, and I’ll make \nan unrelated revelation you might not expect. \nUntil then, you can help make the Journal even better. Send us letters on \nyour opinions about the state of live-action roleplaying today. Send us \nquestions about the features and rules you see here, as well as notes about the \nbroken rules you come across in different MET publications. Send us horror \nstories about games gone wrong and how your player characters fixed them. \nWe’re interested in all aspects of live-action roleplaying, and we want to know \nwhat you think. \nStick around. The Journal is on the cutting edge of the live-action genre; \nwe’ve got something for everybody. And if we don’t have it yet, let us know. \nWe’ll get it for you. \nCurl Bowen \nDeveloper \ncarl@white-wolf. corn \nWhite Wolf \nAttn: Mind’s Eye Theatre Journal Developer \n735 Park North Blvd, Suite 128 \nClarkston, GA 30021 \nUSA \n"

      "text": "STAYING \nI N  CHARACTER \nby Cynthia Summers \nCynthia knows things. She’s been developing Mind’s Eye Theatre for \nmore than a year now, and she’s been pkzying Mind’s Eye Theatre since she \nstarted working for White Wolf in 1994. She’s one of the resident LARPing \nexperts in house. As an observer of the dynamics of he-action rokplayingsociety , \nshe is without peer. \nWhen you go to aMind’s Eye Theatre game, or any LARP for that matter, \none of the game’s greatest charms is the total immersion in the scene. For the \nnext several hours, you’re not who you are at home. You’re the dread prince of \nthe city or the brave knight questing for the treasure or the ghost that’s been \nterrorizing the kids on Lovers’ Lane. When you’re at the game, you have a \ncharacter. Unfortunately, there are numerous distractions that can make \nmaintaining that character challenging at best, impossible at worst. This is the \nchallenge of every actor and every roleplayer - \nhow to maintain character. \nThere are a number of reasons why you may have trouble in the first place, but \nfor every reason, there is certainly a solution. \nB E I N G  AROUND \nOTHERS \nW H O  \nA R E  OUTOE PLAY \nSometimes, you get a couple of folks who just saw the latest Star Wars and \nsimply must discuss it right there in the middle of the game (and they sure don’t \nsound like the Red Talons they’re supposed to be.. .). Or you have to deal with \nsome fool who insists on quoting you the entirety of Monty Python’s The Life of \nBrian to prove he can. Then you have the two who haven’t seen each other since \nthe panty raid at Gropecon’97, and they just reunited in the middle of the game. \nAsk your Storyteller about designating a spot in the game site as out-of- \nplay and announcing at the beginning of the night where it is. Those who are \nbeing noisy should be encouraged to take their discussion elsewhere. Don’t go \ninto the area unless you have to. If you’re having trouble maintaining \ncharacter, it’ll be that much harder around a bunch of folks who are there to \nsmoke, greet their long-lost buddies or whatever. \nTHE PHYSICAL \nTHINGS \nEating, drinking, and sleeping - \nlittle things that our alletoo-human \nbodies crave - \ncan sometimes run roughshod over the mood in a chronicle \n(particularly for those playing the non-living). People tend to drop character \n"

      "text": "fantasy works or going to the movies? If you don’t know how your character \nviews these things, that can really hamper staying in character when you’re \naround others who are discussing the movie that surely inspired a Chrysalis or \ntwo. Even Ghengis Khan took a break. \nDAMN, I’VE C ~ O T T O  S I T O O P  \nSometimes you’ve got to leave the action. Maybe you’re going to play \nanother character for the Storyteller, maybe you’ve been asked to sit away from \nthe in-play area while your character runs a ritual or drives somewhere, or \nyou’ve got to leave early for a real-life job. There are definitely more viable \noptions than making the out-of-play sign and leaving. \nIf you’re going to do something in another part of the game (playing a \nStoryteller character or helping at check-in), then consider excusing yourself \nin character to make a phone call, check email or do some other little thing \nthat should naturally occur off-stage. Before you return, take a moment to \nreorient yourself and re-enter to whatever chaos greets you. The same option \nis open if you’re leaving for a job or other event. Leave under some character \npretext (answeringapage, feeding thecat, writing thepontifex), make your in- \ncharacter farewells and depart. Doing so is a lot more story-friendly than simply \nbarging out and making a great deal of out-of-character noise. \nIn the case of driving, rituals or other tasks that have a time requirement, \nyou need not sit and twiddle your thumbs, nor fall into out-of-play conversa- \ntion you’re not interested in. Grab a book or something that your character \nmight actually be interested in, or think about what your character is doing \nwhile running the ritual, hacking the system or driving. Did she run a red light? \nDid she take extra care with drawing her circles? Storytellers may ask such \nthings as plot fodder, but even if they don’t, it can be a neat detail to bring back \nto play, in addition to keeping you focused. \nM O M ,  WE’RE \nBORED! \nThen, last but not least, there’s that great enemy of the roleplayer - \nboredom. Sitting by yourself doing nothing seems to be one of the greatest \ntemptations to all sorts ofnaughtiness. It can also be apowerful motive to slide \nout of character. After all, you’re not doing anything, so why bother? \nIf you foresee a slow evening for an in-play circumstance, or there’s a \nchance the event you were planning for doesn’t go off, bring things with you \nthat your character could do to keep busy, such as a book, the tools of your craft \nor a game. Chess seems to be the default sport of kings, but backgammon, go, \nmancala or mah jhong are equally valid. Plus there’s always a deck of cards. If \nyou must sit out, then you’ll have something to keep busy with. Ifyou’re in play, \n"

      "text": "seeing you with something in your hands may well bring over curious observers, \nand some of the best roleplaying can spring from in-play interest. It also \nsquashes the risk of sliding out of character and distracting those around you. \nIt could be that the character itself has gone a little stale. You may feel that \nthe character has reached its limits, and he has no more story to tell. Consider \na brief walkabout or time away - \neven the sweetest song can get old if it’s \nplayed too many times. Some downtime may bring you back refreshed and \nraring to go, or you may find that you really have reached the end of the road. \nIf the latter is the case, then go gracefully - \nwhether into the sunset or \nValhalla - \nand take what you learn into your next incarnation. \n"

If you’re one of the former (and the odds are, I think, \npretty good), then you’ve probably had a conversation that goes something like this: \nFRIEND \nHi there! Want to go catch a movie Friday? \nYOU \nUmm, sorry, I can’t. It’s Masquerade night, and I really have to be there. \nFRIEND \nYou said that two weeks ago. And two weeks before that. \nYOU \nI know, I know, but this is something I’ve been working towards for a long time, and I \nhave to be there tonight or the Ventrue primogen will ... \nFRIEND \nWhatever. Say hi to Count Chocula for me. \nSounds familiar, doesn’t it? Not only that, but it’s incredibly frustrating. After all, you \nwant to spend time with your friends who don’t play the game, but it seems like every time \nyou talk to them, they’re demanding that you give up a game session that invariably contains \nsome crucial chain of events. (And I hope I’m not going out on a limb here by assuming that \nyou do indeed have friends who don’t play.) \nYour friends, on the other hand, see every attempt to be social stymied because you’ve \ngot to go to the game. Even worse, they see all of your free time sucked up by this game to \nsuch an extent that they’re ready to hire Harvey Keitel to kidnap and deprogram you (on \nthe condition that he promises to keep his pants on at all times). \nIt’s not a pretty situation, and it’s one that can lead to a lot of strain on both you and \nyour non-gaming social circle. Left untended, that sort of dilemma can cause resentment, \nwreck friendships and generate enough angst to fuel every Oblivion chronicle on the \n(OK, the wise-ass who said, “Both of them?” is getting a stem talking-to when this \ncolumn is over. Count on it.) \nDealing with those who are “outside the tribe” of gamers has always been problematic, \nbut it gets even more so when you have problems dealing with non-LARPers who are at least \ninitially friendly to the idea of LARP.

      "text": "is not semantically equivalent to “Ripe fodder for recruitment into your little ghoul army.” \nA friend can appreciate that you have fun playing Masquerade without having the slightest \ninclination to do so herself, and repeated attempts to haul her into play willy-nilly will \nsquander that appreciation rapidly. \nLet’s put it this way: Many of my friends regard Arnold Schwarzenegger as a luminous \nparadigm of the thespian craft. I think he’s got the dramatic range of a kangaroo’s discus toss, \nbut I certainly don’t begrudge my friends their enjoyment. I wish them happiness when they \nget together for that boffo Commando/ Red Heat double feature playing down at the campus \ncinema series, but I’m not going to partake myself, thanks. \nThe same goes for LARPing. Just because someone doesn’t immediately condemn your \nvampireLARPasa toolofsatan (who, incidentally,reallyshouldhave kickedAmold’sassmuch \nharder in Endof Days), she’snot necessarily ready to dive whole-heartedly into the game. Maybe \nshe just appreciates the fact that you’re having a good time. There is middle ground. Honest. \nUnfortunately, there’s a steady, basic miscommunication between the LARP commu- \nnity and the rest of the world as to what exactly is going on once the capes come out and \nthe fangs appear. To all but the most closely proximate non-tribesman, that Vampire LARP \nthing you do is a “game.” On a certain level, they’re right. It’s a game, a simulation and an \nexercise that you do for the sake of fun and social interaction. \nHowever, where the problem comes in is your definition of a “game” versus theirs. After \nall, they think you’re playing a game in the same way that they’d play chess or Parcheesi or \nFrogger. You play, someone wins, and it’s over. That’s it, end of story, it’s time to move on. \nYou, however, are aware that you are instead partaking in a chronicle, a long-running \nseries of interconnected stories detailing character growth and conflict, and carried out over \na series of sessions that can last years. \nWhat we have here, as the man said, is failure to communicate. Oops. \nIs this anyone’s fault? Of course not - \nat least not initially. Most of the folks out there \nhave certain perceptions of what a game is, how it’s played and what its demarcations are. \nThere’s no reason for them to expect that MET behaves any differently, after all. On the \nother hand, you have every reason to expect your friends to be understanding of your need \nto devote time to something that you’ve invested a lot of work and emotional energy into. \nTherein, to be honest, lies the rub. A chronicle is not an episodic sort of thing. It’s \ncumulative. Plots evolve and move forward. Characters become more complex and more \nfully realized. Social interactions acquire depth. Plus, there are more and more people whose \ncharacters you have to consider as each session rolls past. \nThat sounds fairly generic, right? Every activity gets more complex with time. But you, \nyou’ve put innumerable hours into your plans and building your alliances. You’ve spent lots \nof downtime writing reports, sending in-character emails and arranging brief between- \nsessions roleplaying moments. You’ve laid out cash, at the very least, for costuming. You’ve \nput a ton of energy into maneuvering yourself into a position where you can grab power in \nthe city and learn that new Discipline you’ve had your eye on. Now you’re ready to put areal \nstick up your arch-rival’s butt, but it’s all going to depend on the next session, and you had \nbetter be there to make sure all goes according to plan. \nBesides, if you skip the session, that son of a bitch Ventrue suddenly jumps two points \nahead of you on the experience curve, which means he’s in that much better position to \ncrush everything you’ve worked for, kill your character, and render the long-winded setup \nin the previous paragraph moot. \n(Side note: Why is it that the most intense roleplayers, the ones who put in the absolute \nmost time plotting, scheming, building characters, acquiring experience, shmoozing fellow \nplayers and generally working to bend the game to their will are inevitably the guys you hate \n"

They’re willing to lose status, have plans come to naught and even kiss beloved \ncharacters good-bye - \nbut not if that asshole is the one who benefits. After all, that asshole \nwill, ifcrowned prince, ruin the game, killoff tons of characters and generally wreckeveryone’s \nfun. Unfortunately, to prevent this outcome, otherwise-well-balanced people are forced into \nan ever-widening spiral of commitment, just to keep pace with the schmuck du jour. \nOf course, to an outside observer, this phenomenon looks like a rapid descent into \nobsessive-compulsive behavior, and possibly an Academy Award-nominated role for \nWinona Ryder when they finally make that movie about you.) \nSo let’s take a step back to that hypothetical conversation we started things with. Your \nfriend sees everything you’re doing to culminate all of the work you’ve done for the character \nand cut off Ye Schmuck0 Grande, and he decides that you’ve gone LARP crazy and that you \nno longer have any use for people outside that special little world. After all, on those rare \noccasions when you do manage to hang out, you talk about what you’ve done recently - \nwhich is LARP. \n(Side Note #2: This sort of situation is usually not helped by infrequent sessions of \nhanging out. After all, at those moments you talk about what you’ve done recently, which \noften consists of ... what you’ve done at the LARP. It’s an affliction common to all \nenthusiastic hobbyists - \nyou should hear fantasy baseball players ramble on for hours about \nthe minutiae of the Cubs’ backup middle infielder situation - \nbut it’s inevitably really \nincredibly annoying to the non-hobbyists forced to endure it.) \nYou, on the other hand, have decided that your friend is an insensitive bastard for \ndemanding that you abandon everything you’ve worked for just to catch a movie that will \nno doubt be on video within the hour anyway. Plus, he’s showing an appalling lack of \nunderstanding of all the work, passion and probably money you’ve put into this, and exactly \nhow much will go down the drain if you miss the session. \nSo who’s at fault? Again, nobody is. It’s just a miscommunication. However, that \nmiscommunication will do a Godzilla-style number on your friendships with folks outside \nthe game that you’re in if it’s allowed to continue. This column isn’t me trying to be funny \nor get in a backhanded slam at folks who genuinely enjoy playing MET full-throttle. This \nstuff happens, and it happens a lot, which is a shame. After all, like I keep on saying, MET \nis a game. It’s supposed to add to your life and make it more fun. Stressing friendships does \nnot, by my definition of the word, add to anyone’s fun, and it behooves you and your friends \noutside the tribe to make some efforts to bridge that gap of communication before anything \nirrevocable occurs. \nThe most important step in achieving some sort of dktente between your LARPing and \nnon-LARPing lives is clearing up the misunderstanding over what sort ofgame it is. The best \nway to go about it is to couch it in terms that your friends will recognize and relate to. If they \nbowl, they’d be offended if you asked them to skip a league night for amovie, especially with \nthe league championship (and the coveted gold-plated ugly shoes trophy) on the line. \nTherefore, it’s only a short jump to comparing your showdown with Vinnie the Ventrue to \nhis showdown with the guys who normally hang out on lane 21. \nCouching the session in question in terms like that helps on several levels. First of all, \nit provides an easily understandable parallel for what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. \nYou’ve put a lot of time into the character, he’s put a lot of time into his game. You’ve put \na lot of money into costuming, he’s bought a strike ball, a spare ball and a pair of God- \ndamned ugly shoes. And so it goes. By bringing what you’ve done into close comparison to \nwhat he’s done, it suddenly makes more sense. \nI \n"

Those, however, are the \nrisks you have to take for the greater good.) \nIt’s a small step, but it’s a worthwhile one. You can’t mandate understanding on your \nfriends’ part; you can only provide the tools and opportunities by which they just might \nunderstand why exactly you do that wacky thing you do. Think of yourself as an enabler, and \nsuddenly you’ll feel much better about the process. \nThen again, there always remains the slim possibility that maybe, just maybe, your \nfriend is right and you actually are devoting too much time to the game.

If enough people are saying, “Gee, you’re playing that game an awful lot,” \nit’s worth a minute or two to do a mental check on exactly how much time, effort and money \nyou’re putting into play. If you can answer in the affirmative to more than half of these \nquestions, you might want to take a step back: \n1-Do you get your mail and find yourself vaguely annoyed that none of it is addressed \nto your character? \n2-Does your character have a larger wardrobe than you do? \n3-Does your email application have a separate folder for IC game correspondence that’s \nslightly larger than a scanned-in copy of War and Peace? \n4-Do the waitrons at the local 24 hour restaurants know you by your character name \nrather than your real one? \n5-Does the sight of a T-shirt emblazoned with the exhortation, “DO NOT TELL ME \nABOUT YOUR CHARACTER!” inspire sudden rage in you? \n6-Do you look forward to traveling to exotic locales because they’ve been described in \nWhite Wolf books and you can’t wait to have your character announce that he’s spoken to \nthe canonical White Wolf characters? \n7-Have you ever been in an uncomfortable discussion or situation and had someone \nsay, “Why are your arms folded across your chest all of a sudden?” \n8-Do you find yourself mentally assigning Negative Traits to people you don’t like? \n9-Have you ever seriously considered dating someone else’s character, even if you \nwouldn’t touch that particular player with a biohazard suit on? \n10-Have you ever screwed up at school or work and found yourself actually trying to \nexplain to your superior/ professor that it wasn’t your fault because the Nosferatu kept you \n11-Have you ever shown off your copy of the old Laws of the Night and proudly \nidentified it as a first printing because a.) the spine lettering is unreadable and b.) it doesn’t \nhave the typo on the back cover? \nIf you answered “Yes” to a majority of these questions, it’s probably time to slow down \na bit. If you answered“Yes, and your point is?” it’s definitely time to take a break, and possibly \ntime for another hobby. \nThis is not to say that because you play MET, you automatically play too much MET. \nAfter all, I like the fact that you’re playing the game.

I mean, come on, people. \nHowever, it’s easy to fall into the great trap of the continuing live-action chronicle, \nwhich is to say its cumulative nature. Yes, this week is when everything comes to a head - \nbut odds are, there’s going to be something just as vital at the next session, and the one after \nthat, and so on. There’s always another idiot or munchkin or asshole or twink who’s on the \nverge of ruining the game if you, personally, don’t interpose yourself. There’s always another \nemail to write, just to make sure that everything’s going according to plan, another XP to \npick up to ensure that you’re character will survive the next game. And so it goes - \nit’s no \nbetter or worse or different than computer gamers who hog-tie themselves to Ciuilizutiun so \nthey can build one more chariot unit before bed, except that there are other people involved, \nfor better or for worse. \nIf you lose sight of that, then just maybe your friend might have a point. After all, no \nmatter how many times you throw yourself on the grenade of El Twinko, every chronicle \nends sooner or later. Every game winds down. And when it does, you want to be able to dust \nyourself off, smile nostalgically at your much-marked character sheet, and walk off with your \nlife having been made better by the fact that you played. You don’t want to look around at \nthe wreckage with a wide-eyed expression of panic and start planning a new game just \nbecause you have no idea what the hell else to do with your time. \nYou have a responsibility, after all, a responsibility to yourself. You do not have a \nresponsibility to Save The Game. If Baron Von Twinkenstein is ruining it, you don’t \nnecessarily have to be the hero every time. If he’s really that bad, someone else will probably \ntry to help; if he isn’t, maybe you need to relax. And if worse comes to worst, you can always \nstart a new game. If the guy’s that much of a ninny, odds good that are the folks you actually \nwant to play with will come with you - \nand if you’re not going toe to toe with your pet \nschmuck, odds are you’ll have a little more time around the game. \nMore importantly, you have a responsibility to yourself to make yourself happy, and \neven the most avid player will - \nupon due reflection - \nagree that letting the rest of your \nlife atrophy for the sake of the game probably doesn’t cover that criterion too well. \nIn the end, it does come down to perspective. You have to help your friends achieve \na clearer perspective on what you’re doing and why it’s important to you. If they’re friends \nworth keeping, they’ll respect that, stick around and make an effort to get together around \nyour gaming schedule. By the same token, you owe it to yourself to re-examine your \nperspective on the whole thing, and make sure you’re happy with the role the game is playing \nin your life. Yes, it’s fun, and yes, it can happily suck up as much time as you want to give \nit. Just be sure you’re happy with how much time you’re giving it, and how much time you’re \ngiving everything else. \nIn the end, after all, it’s a game that you play - \nthat’s all. All in all, that’s a pretty \ndamned good thing for it to be. You’ll probably want to keep it from becoming anything \nmore. Your friends have no right to try to make it anything less. But in the meantime, that \nmiddle’s a heck of a place to be. \nAnd if not? There’s always room for one more at the bowling alley, if you can stand the \nshoes. \nI \n"

He \ncame to Atlanta, GA to become a starving actorlwaiter, only realizing late in life \nthat, while acting is cool, starving sucks. While some of the roles he played were \nimmense fun - \nespecially the lead in Romeo and Juliet - \neventually he hung \nup his tights and rapier and went to work in the mundane world. These days, he \nwrites freelance material for White Wolf, contributing to the cjuide to the \nCamarilla and Storytellers guide. He still feels the need to treud the boards \noccasionally, though. \n“So, what’s this weird hobby of yours you do on the weekends?” Most \nMind’s Eye Theatre players have faced this awkward question from well- \nmeaning friends or relatives at some point. It’s never aneasy one to tackle. How \ndo you explain to your dear Aunt Edna that you pretend to be a werewolf on \nalternate Tuesdays without making her cough up her dentures and give your \nfolks embarrassed glances? Do you lie and tell her you like to take long, soulful \nwalks in the woods? After all, you can leave out the part where you bay at the \nmoon. Do you just dodge the question by complementing her on her new \ncrocheted sweater? \nA lot ofplayers settle for this half-truth: “I’m in an improvisational theater \ntroupe.” It sounds nice and profound. The conversation can move on again \nsafely. After all, theater is a respectable hobby. And while improv comedy isn’t \nShakespeare, Clive Anderson and his friends had a huge hit with that Whose \nLine is it Anyway? show of theirs. Theater is an ancient, noble art where you \ndress up and pretend to be someone else in front of an audience, while live- \naction games, why, they’re some scruffy hobby where.. er.. . you do the same \nthing without an audience. And with some games of Rock-Paper-Scissors \ntossed in to boot. \nHmm. Maybe that convenient explanation isn’t so far from the truth \nafter all. \nLive-action gaming is a form of theater, pure and simple. Mind you, there’s \nno audience at a LARP, but that doesn’t mean that you aren’t acting when you \nassume the role. Acting and live-action gaming are both about playing make \n"

Acting focuses exclusively on taking that “make believe” as far as \npossible, while LARPers just settle for enjoying ourselves. \nSure, live-action roleplaying is just a game. So is chess. So is business. So \nis a love affair. So is art. A game is any activity with rules and a goal and a lot \nof joy involved with the process. Some of the best games - \nlike love or business \n- \nare deadly serious. Theater is as much a game as any LARP, in its own way. \nYou just don’t keep score the same way. \nTrust me. Ask any actor. They aren’t in it for the money. Why do you \nthink we’re called “starving artists”? \nActing in a LARP and acting on stage isn’t quite the same. You have to \nwork a lot harder on your concentration in a LARP than on stage. You have \nmore freedom - \nand more work - \nat a game than in front of the footlights. \nBut the raw pleasure of it all is the same. When you are In Character (in capital \nletters), you know it, and you never forget how good it feels. \nIt’s hard to explain what that feeling is like. It’s not a matter of “forgetting” \nyourself. You don’t suddenly develop Multiple Personality Disorder. You just \nfocus completely on the moment. Forget that you’re in a high school gym. \nForget that you’re speaking in sonnets. Forget that your tights itch. If you put \nall these things away and concentrate - \nreally concentrate - \non being \nsomeone else for an hour, it can be magic. You’re never going to “be” that \nperson, but you’re going to be more in tune with yourself by focusing on making \nthat role come to life. \nYou can feel it on stage all the time. At an MET game, it’s a lot more rare, \nbut those moments of clarity are present. The tests and the rules exist to make \nthose magic moments when the world comes alive happen. And with a little \npractice, those moments happen a lot more often. \nThis article is intended to help coach you through getting into character \nfor a LARP, using some basic theater techniques. You won’t be ready to star in \nthe Scottish play after reading these steps, but you will find it easier to enter \nand stay in character if you follow them. Before your next game, give them a \ntry and see what happens. With any luck, you’ll be able to find those In \nCharacter moments more easily, once you have an idea of how to get there. \nEocus: P U T T I N ~ T H E  \nDAY AWAY \nThe most important aspect of making a character is concentration. It’s all \nabout focus. You can’t convince anybody you’re an 18th century vampire if \nyou’re talking about the latest episode of Duwson’s Creek or catching up on the \nlatest gossip. Building a character takes work. If you’re not concentrating on \nthe job, it’ll slip away from you. \nBefore you start your next game, take a minute to walk away from the \ncrowd and get yourself ready. Take a few deep breaths.

Leave the stuff that’s outside the game, outside the game. \nThe biggest distraction any actor can face is stage fright. When you start \nto worry about what the audience thinks about you, your concentration is shot. \nIf you worry about what the other players think about you, you can’t focus. If \nyou can’t focus, you can’t do the job correctly. \nIf you’re afraid, you’re afraid. That’s fine. Focus on who you are and what \nyou’re doing. Ignore the spectators. Think about what you are doing right now. \nTake that fear, look at it a little bit, and then set it on the shelf with today’s \ntroubles. You’ve got something else to do for the next few hours.

That’s right, move around a bit. \nRoll your neck and stretch out your back. You’re going to be using your body \nas much as your brain for the next few hours.

Sir \nLawrence Olivier was playing a torturer, and Hoffman was his victim. \nHoffman really got into the role he was playing: He didn’t sleep for three \ndays before the shoot. He didn’t eat the day before. The day of the shoot, he \ndidn’t bathe. Finally, he showed up to the set, ready to go. \nSir LawrenceOlivierwaswaitingforhim. \nHestaredathis youngpartner and \nexclaimed, “Good Lord! You look terrible! What on earth happened to you?” \n‘‘I starved myself for the role,” Hoffman replied groggily. \nSir Lawrence stared at him a bit, and then replied crisply: “My dear boy. \nNext time try acting. It’s so much easier.” \nHoffman and Olivier both had very different techniques for getting into \ncharacter. Hoffman built on the “interior technique” of acting. He put himself \nthrough some really nasty experiences to learn what it felt like to be tortured. \nThen he took those personal experiences to his character. The end result was \na very realistic performance. (Maybe too realistic for those downwind of him.) \nA L L T H F  \nWORLD’S \nA STAGE \n"

      "text": "Sir Lawrence, on the other hand, used an older technique- \nthe “exterior \ntechnique.” He focused on how his character moved- how the tortured stood, \nhow he walked, how he stared at Hoffman. Then he listened to what those \nchanges in his body did to his voice and his heart, and he carried them through \nto the stage. The end result was just as good, and just as credible, as Hoffman’s. \nBoth techniques offer a window into getting inside a character. So which \ntechnique is best to use in Mind’s Eye Theatre? Both, of course. \n€ XTE R I  o R TECHNIQUE \nFirst and foremost, acting is an active process. Saying so sounds silly, but it’s \nanundeniable basicofthe art. You tell your audiencewho youarewith your body. \nYour posture defines your personality more than anything else about you. It \ndoesn’t matter how detailed your character background is. It doesn’t matter if you \ntell me that you’re a professional bodyguard who lived through the Punic Wars. \nIf I don’t see it in the way you walk, I don’t believe you, and nothing you say can \nconvince me. And if you can’t convince me, how can you convince yourself? \nActors often refer to their bodies as instruments. An actor “uses his \ninstrument” to convey a role to an audience. It sounds pretentious [or dirty, if \nyour mind works like that], but there’s a lot of truth there. Without an \nunderstanding of it, it doesn’t matter how much thought and research you put \ninto a role. If an audience doesn’t see your work, you’re as effective as a \ntrombonist who hums along to the orchestra. An entire philosophy of acting, \ncalled the Alexander Technique, is devoted to this idea of acting with your \nbody. We don’t have space for the thousands ofpages written about it, but here \nare some highlights. \nTry this on for size. Get up out of your chair and start walking. Don’t think \nabout walking, just walk like you were getting a coke from the fridge. Okay. \nNow speed up a little. Don’t run. Just pick up the pace. Concentrate, now. \nDon’t think about how silly you may look, just do it. \nWhile you’re walking, think about how you’re standing. When you walk \nthrough the door to the kitchen, what’s the first part of your body that passes \nthe doorframe? No, it’s not your feet - \nnot unless you’re taking giant steps. \nOdds are it’s your nose or your hips or your stomach. \nWhat happenswhen you leadwithyourchin?Don’tstickout Like youwere \ntaking a punch, just think about leading with your chin. Keep it small. Turn \naround. When you turn, what part of your body turns first? Try to move in such \na way that your chin is the first thing that moves when you decide to hang a \nleft into the kitchen. \nClench your jaw. Swing your arms. Clench your fists. Unclench them. \nSwing your head from side to side, like you were working a kink in your back out. \nStop. How do you feel? \nIf you said “Angry,” that’s good. You paid attention to what your body was \ntelling you. Congratulations. You just acted. \n"

      "text": ".______-- \n \nA lot of times, you can slip right into a role just by concentrating on how \na character moves. Bodyguards, scholars and slaves all stand still in completely \ndifferent ways. If you pay attention to this aspect of your character, you’ll go \na long way toward getting into his shoes. \nBody language is absolutely crucial for the more animalistic roles in the \nWorld of Darkness, like those of the Garou. Do you want to play a lupus-breed \nwerewolf? Do yourself a favor. Plant yourself in front of the Discovery Channel. \nWatch wolves for an hour or two. A wolf moves in a certain way. He reacts in \na certain way. How do you take your two-legged body and make yourself move \nlike that wolf on the television screen? Try it and find out. Eventually, you’ll \nnever have to say, ‘‘I’m a lupus,” to other players. They’ll know before you can \nShow the other players what you are. One of the worst sins you can commit \nat a game is to raise your fingers and explain yourself. Don’t say, “You can see \nthatI’mreallybeatenup.”Don’tsay, \n“Youcansee that I’mfurious.”Show these \nthings! How does someone move when they’ve been beaten to a pulp? How do \nyou look at someone when you’re ready to chew nails and spit baling wire? Part \nof you probably knows. At some time in your life, you’ve been that bruised. \nYou’ve probably been that angry as well. Feel those feelings all over again, and \nlet your fellow gamers see it. The fewer times you have to step out of character, \nthe stronger your character will be. \nBefore you enter your next game, spend some time thinking about how \nyour character moves. How does he walk? Is he sneaky? Lead with your nose. \nIs he arrogant? Lead with your chin. Try as many things as you like. Don’t just \nthink about these mannerisms, try them. If you are sitting in a chair pondering \nall of this stuff, you’ve missed the point. \nCostuming helps a great deal in figuring out the body language of your \ncharacter. An evening gown forces you move in a certain way. So does a tuxedo \nor a pair of blue jeans or a doublet and hose. It’s hard to slouch in a tuxedo or \ngown. You have to keep your back straight. As a result, you look more formal. \nAnd if you look formal, you feel more formal. Incorporate those restrictions \ninto your character’s movement. Every small cue informs your character \nchoices; they all help you decide what does and doesn’t fit in your game play. \nNow that you’ve got your character up on its feet, it’s time to turn your \nbrain on and start thinking through your role. \nINTERIOR \nTECHNIQUE \nStart going over your character history at this point. Run it through your \nhead like a good movie or a slideshow. Pick three events from your character \nhistory that you consider important. \nTake a good look at those important moments. Play them back in your \nhead. Go into detail. What did you see? What did you hear? What did you \nsmell? What did you touch? Try and drag all five senses into the mix. \nA L L T H E  \nWORLD’S \nA S T A ~ E  \n"

What was he feeling \nwhen these things happened? \nLet’s say that your character’s father was killed by the Sabbat. How would \nthat make your character feel? Angry? Sure. How about afraid? After all, your \nfather was far more powerful than you were once. How about disappointed? You \nalways thought your dad was stronger than this. How about happy? What did \nyour father do to you that would make you happy to see him dead? Hmmm.. . \nMaybe some answers are right. Maybe some aren’t. But ask every \nquestion you can, even the ones you think are wrong. Maybe you’ll be \nsurprised. People are capable of the most amazing things sometimes. Don’t \nsettle for the easy answers. \nAbove all, avoid saying no. Consider everything. Try everything. You owe \nit to yourself to look at every option. One of the greatest joys about this hobby \nis that you can be absolutely anyone or anything. You owe it to yourself to \nexplore every possibility, even the ones that you wouldn’t normally allow \nyourself to look at twice. \nNow that you’ve explored these emotions in your character, try and link \nthem to your own experiences in the world. It doesn’t matter if your character \nis a centuries old vampire or a bloodthirsty werewolf or whatever. You’ve had \nfeelings and experiences that are similar to that creature. If it was impossible \nto empathize with a character, he’d be boring. If you can imagine a character, \nyou can step into his shoes. It’s just a matter of trying. There are no such things \nas aliens in this world, only strangers. \nMaybe your parents haven’t been killed by anybody, but have you \nexperienced the feelings that your character felt when his father was killed? \nCan you remember what it was like to be afraid for you father? When were you \nangry with your father? Were you ever disappointed with your father? What did \nthose things feel like? Think of those moments. Think of your character \nhistory.

There are no \nwrong answers here -only \nanswers that you’re afraid to try. Dare it. Try them. \nRemember, it’s only a game. The world of make believe is a wonderful place \nto explore your heart. As long as you keep the line between fantasy and reality \nstrong, you can find some amazing things. \nOne final note: Make sure that your character’s Nature and Demeanor \nagree with the choices you’ve made about the character so far. You’ll be using \nthose two little words as a touchstone for your character’s innermost desires as \nthe game goes on.

You’re ready to get into the \ngame. Good. Now the work really begins. \nActing applies to your body, and it applies to your mind. When you start \nplaying the game, you need to make an active choice about what you’re going \nto get done that night. \nWe make choices every day, most of which aren’t terribly important. We \ndecide what to have for lunch. We decide what to wear. Theater, and acting, \nis all about making choices too. Big choices. The bigger, the better. Hamlet \nisn’t deciding on lunch, he’s deciding whether he should kill himself or murder \nhis stepfather. The choices you make need to be active choices, things that \nother people can see and hear, so that they can react to your actions and make \nthe story happen. \nWhat does your character want tonight? Before you answer that question, \nkeep the following guideline in mind: Don’t answer in the passive tense. \nActing is an active process, remember? Your goal can’t be “stay alive.” That’s \nboring. Try the goal “kill anyone who tries to hurt me.” Or maybe even “run \naway from anyone who tries to hurt me.” As long as you have something for \nyour character to do, you’re in good shape. \nHow about the goal “become prince”? Try harder. Become is a pretty \npassive word. How about the goal “kill the old prince,” or “discredit the old \nprince”? Those active goals are much better. \nMake sure that your choice is informed by all the work that you’ve done \nso far. Don’t choose to kill the prince for the heck of it. Choose it if your \ncharacter wants it, for reasons all his own. And don’t be afraid to set impossible \ngoals for yourself. It’s the choice that is important here, not your success or \nfailure. Your goal, as a player, is to create the most interesting story you can \ntonight. Your character’s goal should be chosen with that fact firmly in mind. \nKeep the choices big. Don’t make your goal for the evening “get an ice \ncream cone.” That’s too easy. Once you get it, you’ll be stuck for something to \ndo for the rest of the evening. A good story involves a big decision. Big \ndecisions entail big risks. Never settle for second best. Don Quixote didn’t \nbecome a librarian or a writer, he set out to restore the lost age of chivalry. Be \nambitious in setting your goals. Even if your character fails in his quest, you \nwon’t have failed to tell an epic story. \nStuck? Try looking at your character’s Nature and Demeanor.

If your Nature is Bravo, and your Demeanor is Critic, you may want \nto ruin someone’s self esteem by criticizing her at every turn. When all else fails, \nuse your Nature and Demeanor as the touchstones for your character’s desires. \nDon’t become obsessed with this one goal, however, unless your character \nis thusly deranged. Goals can change during the course of a game. You can want \ndifferent things. You can even want completely opposite things. After all, every \nvampire wants to let the Beast out, but at the same time, he wants to keep it in \ncheck. That internal conflict is a great way to bring depth and excitement to your \ncharacter. Be ready to go with major course changes when they happen. You can \nnever anticipate everything that can happen to a character. You can only react. \nWhat if your goal conflicts with another player’s goal? Good. That’s what \ngood roleplaying is all about. A conflict lies at the heart of all good theater. \nEvery single stagedproduction you can thinkof (fromNo Exit to Wrestlemania) \nhas a struggle of some kind in it. You get involved in LARPs to stage a \nproduction and tell a story, and conflict is what makes that story work. \nIf your goal conflicts with another player’s goal, try your damnedest to get \nyour way. You have every option in the book open to you - \nyou can beg, you \ncan whimper, you can threaten, you can bribe, and you can even kill. But don’t \nback down. At least, don’t back down until a more important goal comes across \nyour path. Most people try to suppress conflict in real life. They get along with \ntheir coworkers and their friends, so that we can all survive the day smoothly. \nYou aren’t required to play nice in the World of Darkness. Don’t be afraid to \nstop playing nice and go for the jugular. (Figuratively speaking, of course.) \nWhen you’re playing a supernatural creature like a vampire or a werewolf, \nyou have a lot of freedom. You can go to extremes that human beings can never \ndream of. The anger of a werewolf is legendary. The passions of a vampire dwarf \nregular emotions. When you play one of these characters, you have every right \nto jump in with both feet. Don’t hold back or make a halfhearted choice. Don’t \nlike something if you can love it. Don’t love it if you can obsess over it. And don’t \ndislike something. Hate it. Your choices need to be as bold and strong as possible. \nThe more you try for something, the stronger your character will be for it. \nThis last piece of advice comes with a very strong caveat, however: Don’t \nforget to respect the real world around you. Don’t bellow your inhuman fury \nat the top of your lungs if you’re in a banquet hall filled with people who aren’t \nplaying. If nothing else, remember that every supernatural wants to keep his \nor her nature hidden, for some very good reasons. \nMore to the point, however, you need to keep the flow of the game going. \nIf everyone has to step out of character to calm down irate hotel clerks and \nmothers, then all of that drama gets wasted. Theater only works when you have \nthe trust of your fellow actors. If the other players worry constantly that you’ll \ndisrupt the event and force everyone to break character, they’ll have a much \nharder time involving themselves in your work. \n"

Here are some tips \nabout the little pitfalls your characters can fall into, and how to make the best \nrole-play possible out of them. \nCombat is inevitable in every LARP. If you’ve been serious about chasing \nyour goals thus far, it’s very likely that your character will end up throwing a \npunch at someone at some point. Remember to keep roleplaying your charac- \nter even as he’s fighting for his life. It’s hard to keep character in mind while \nyou’re juggling numbers in the back of your head, but keep focused. Above all, \nsell the combat with your words and with your body. Combat can be fun. It’s \nexciting imaging your character performing stunts that make Jet Li in Romeo \nMust Die look like Marlon Brando in The Freshman. Long sessions of Rock- \nPaper-Scissors, however, are not fun. Focus on the story, not the hand signals. \nDescribe what your character is doing as much as possible. Paint the scene for \nyour opponent and your audience. If you can mime out your character’s actions \n(without engaging in stunts ur touching other people), do so. Remember that the \nsafety of those around you is always more important than the game. Above all, \ntry to get out of turns and into real time as soon as possible. \nIn the course of a game, it’s very likely that you’ll have a character die. \nAccept this fact and keep going. It can be very painful to lose a character that \nyou’ve spent a lot of time and energy creating, but at the same time, there’s \nnothing more powerful to play - \neither on stage or in a LARP - \nthan a good, \njuicy death scene. If you have chased your goals as character with such \ndevotion that you can only choose between their success and your character’s \ndeath, you’ve done very well as an actor in live-action play. If your character \nchooses death at the final hour, you’ve built a story that will change the nature \nof your chronicle for years. Remember, the goal of this game isn’t to build a \nnice, safe character that lives to a ripe old age. If that were the case, we’d play \ncouch potatoes, not vampires werewolves. You’re here to tell the most exciting \nstory you can. Don’t be afraid to risk everything your character has for the sake \nof making the story sing. \nIn the same vain, don’t be afraid to let your character fail occasionally. \nFailure is a powerful motivator for change.

Occasionally, that means letting the opposition win. It’ll make \nyour eventual comeback and victory that much sweeter. \nA number of powers in Mind’s Eye Theatre can force you to play your \ncharacter very differently from normal.

Don’t be afraid to \nstep out of character for a minute or two to walk back through your process if \nyou need to. What does your character want now? How is he going to get it? \nRemember that now supernatural power can fundamentally change who your \ncharacter is. It is your choice as a player how any effect is portrayed.

The choice is ultimately yours. \nTrust your fellow players. They’re here to tell the best story they can \ntonight, just like you.

However, don’t be surprised \nif, after trying on all of these different goals and emotions, you find that you \nhave changed and moved yourself somehow.

In this article, we take a look at some of the more unusual schools of \nKuei-jin thought that didn’t make it into Laws of the East. \nThese relatively young Dharmas are rejected as heretical by the Quincunx, \nbut many of them are gaining support in the tumultuous days of the Fifth Age \nas younger vampires look to make their own mark on the world. Bear in mind \nthat such freedom from established doctrine comes with a high price as well. \nFinding teachers for these paths is seldom easy, and open followers of these paths \ncan expect cold welcomes (at best) when it comes to dealing with traditional \nelders. Being branded akuma for espousing such radically different beliefs is \nnever far away for Kuei-jin on these paths, and the brightest of them never forget \nthat this threat hangs over their heads constantly. \nExisting as they do outside traditional Kuei-jin astrology, Kuei-jin who \nfollow a heretical Dharma do not receive a lucky number for their Dharma if they \npurchase the Horoscope Background. Such is the price of following such an \nunorthodox route. \nT H E  \nE L A M E O E T H E  R I S I N C ~  \nPHOENIX \nVIRTUE: HUNAND \nY A N ~  \nNot all vampires believe that they are set down on the Road Back in order \nto forge a new identity for themselves. Some believe that their responsibility lies \nin finishing the tasks they failed to accomplish during their breathing days; to \nset right what so obviously wouldn’t let them rest the first time. The reasoning \nis sound enough to their minds. If life was so short on karma that the Kuei-jin \nhad to return to life once more, then doesn’t it make sense that their old lives \nshould be the focus of their renewed attentions? The abilities of the Kuei-jin are \nonly tools that they are meant to use in order to set their lives straight once more, \nand Phoenixes struggle hard to overcome their P’os and rejoin the world of their \nliving relatives. At first, many of them are surprisingly successful, acting as \nguardian angels over the ones they considered dear to them in life and settling \nold accounts left unpaid on their death. Even the most jaded elder harbors the \nkind of thoughts that drive this Dharma, of returning to his family home or \nvisiting his old love once more. This secret sympathy is perhaps the only reason \nthat this Dharma is merely scorned and not actively hunted. \nHowever, try as they might, the compassion and optimism of the Phoe- \nnixes inevitably fades as time goes by. Relatives die, times change, and \nsometimes the Kuei-jin herself is even responsible for some great family \n"

Such events can \nunhinge even the most devoted members of this Dharma unless they possess \nabsolute devotion to their cause, and after a time most Phoenixes are far more \npragmatic than idealistic when it comes to restoring harmony to their old \nlives. Many also start looking for a bigger picture, tending to larger groups of \nmortals and sheltering them from the dark indulgences of other shen. They go \nfrom viewing their own lives as the key to their redemption to seeing all human \nlife as necessary to achieve enlightenment. Make no mistake, though. These \nKuei-jin are unholy terrors when they feel their protectorates are threatened. \nMore than one kyonshi has discovered that affinity for life and the higher soul \nby no means excludes warriors. \nThe strangest thing about this Dharma is that it has produced no known \nbodhisattvas. As soon as they reach a certain level of enlightenment, elder \nPhoenixes simply disappear into thin air, and even powerful divinations cannot \ndetermine their fate for certain. Naturally, the Quincunx and others are quick \nto use this fact as an example of how this Dharma must be fundamentally \nYlawed” in some way or another, and they step up persecution of this Dharma \naccordingly. Of course, the Phoenixes simply claim that it proves that their ways \nare correct. However, even they admit that the absence of bodhisattvas and \nother powerful elders makes their unlives more politically dangerous than those \nof other Kuei-jin. As for the missing elders themselves, perhaps the Sixth Age \nwill shed some light on their true fates.. . . \nTraining: Phoenixes typically “train” by spending as much time as they can \namong mortals, studying their interactions and learning what it takes both to \nheal them and stir their imaginations. Many take to the arts in some form or \nanother as a means of expressing their hopeful sentiments to mortals at large, and \nthere have been more than a few fairly reputable artists in the last century who \nwere actually counted among the members of this Dharma. \nDharmic Strength: Bonds of Living Harmony \nAll Phoenixes are exceptionally attuned to mortal emotions and manners. \nTheir players receive a free retest on all Empathy and Etiquette tests with mortals. \nAll Phoenixes also receive a free Compassionate Social Trait, which cannot be \nlost permanently as long as they remain on this Dharma. Most Phoenixes go to \ngreat lengths to avoid injuring mortals if it is at all possible in a given situation, \nalthough they receive no special benefits for doing so. \nDharmic Weakness: Tending Orchids \nPhoenixes are doomed to lose themselves among the teeming masses of \nhumanity, where the ravages of the Demon, the hunger and more eventually \ntake their toll on those the Kuei-jin cares about. As a result, most Phoenixes \nchoose one person in particular they wish to shelter from the ravages of their new \ncondition. They are extremely loyal guardians, but any harm to this chosen \nmortal brings down the terrible wrath of the Phoenix. All Phoenixes must take \nthe Flaw: Ward, representing a close friend or family member from their mortal \ndays whom they are especially dedicated to protecting.

Existence \nmay be a matter of moderation to the followers of Balance, but nothing said it \nhad to be moderation born of mediocrity! Indeed, many Tempests strive \nconstantly to raise their personal bars higher and higher, and a piece of \ninformation never leaves their hands once it passes their way. These Kuei-jin \nsimply strive not to overbalance themselves in one area or another. \nUltimately, the Tempests strive to find what lies in between mortal and \nvampire, spirit and matter, and this quest eventually leads them away from the \nmaterial, elemental aspects of Kuei-jin society and into deep contemplation of \nthe mysteries of the Kuei-jin soul. Many elder Tempests are masters of arts that \nallow for introspection and spiritual education, and they puzzle constantly about \nmatters both large and small concerning the undead condition and its relation \nto the universe around them. Their mastery of a multitude of subjects aside, these \nmasters claim to be searching for what lies beyond the gateway of enlighten- \nment. If the riddles and koans of this Dharma are correct, they surmise, the \nanswer can be nothing less than the universe itself, and so they seek to become \none with all things by denying any strong ties to a particular object or condition. \nTraining: Most Tempests fit nicely in the Western conception of a \n“Renaissance thinker.” They strive to master a wide variety of skills, from \nmundane labor to hidden occult lore to one more Kuei-jin Discipline. There- \nfore, their training is an eclectic affair designed to expose them to many different \nsubjects but immerse them innone, allowing them to choose their destiny freely. \nGreat measures are taken to balance the forces of Yin and Yang simmering \nbeneath the Kuei-jin’s skin, and while they take pains to study the Hun and its \ndevotion to duty, Tempests also probe and develop the Demon carefully. Some \nthink the Tempests are shallow, drinking deeply of nothing, but such modera- \ntion is what allows them to have the proper perspective between the clashing \nforces of the universe. \nDharmic Strength: Eye of the Storm \nExisting as they do in an unlife of moderation and temperance, the \nTempests are capable of remarkable feats of restraint when called for.

While their Dharma may espouse forbearance, many \nTempests become reactionary after a while, moving one step behind the world \nbecause they are too cautious to really embrace the chances that are given to \nthem. Because of their hesitant ways, all Tempests receive the Negative Trait: \nPredictabk, which cannot be bought off short of reaching dah. Furthermore, any \ntime the character feels he has overindulged in a particular activity, it ruins his \ncareful sense of balance. When such occasions come to pass, the Tempest is one \nTrait down on all challenges until such time as he has properly atoned for the \nindulgence with activities like long meditation or forbearance of material goods. \nThe Storyteller may enforce this penalty if the player does not. \n"

According to the sacred texts of the \nDivine Faces - \nthe Red Book of the Iron Bndge and The Celestial Nail - \nthe \nHeavens can be restored to their former glory only by the return of the gods who \nhave lost their way. The Godlings have no intention of disappointing. \nGiven the openness with which they hold their natures, it is unsurprising \nto discover that many Divine Faces have mortal cults flourishing around them, \nwhich the Faces administer with all the grace and horror that befits their divine \nstatus. (It takes a rare mortal to deny a god that walks among them bestowing \nfavors and influence in exchange for mere worship!) Not that most Godlings \ntruly care about their “parishioners.” Such mortals are a means to the end of \nreturning to Heaven once more, a font of Chi waiting to be tapped. Indeed, even \nin the relatively tolerant world of the Middle Kingdom, many Kuei-jin meet \nGodlings for the first time while carrying out a court mission to order the \nGodlings to stop demonstrating their powers in public. Of course, such actions \nare perfectly reasonable to their minds. When one aspires to godhood, after all, \nwho cares if the mortals catch a glimpse of your power along the way? \nTraining: The training of Divine Faces tends to be abrupt and to the point. \nAnother Godling finds the Kuei-jin and instructs him in the lessons of reincar- \nnation, divinity, deific values and the need to embrace both sin and virtue in \norder to reclaim the favor of Heaven and return once more. Many Godlings are \nalso taught the nuances of etiquette and courtly manners during this time.

Sometimes this face is full of the Divine Radiance of Heaven; \nsometimes it is the Eyes of Hell. Either way, the results are bound to impress. The \nGodling may use each visage once per story. Divine Radiance requires a Yang \nTrait to activate, while the Eyes of Hell requires a Trait of Demon Chi. When \nDivine Radiance is active, the Kuei-jin receives the Traits Compassionate, \nCommanding and Magnetic for the remainder of the scene, as well as a free retest \non all Social Tests related to empathy and courtly grace. By contrast, the Eyes \nof Hell is treated the same as the Delirium (see the Demon Shintai Discipline in \nLaws of the East for details), sending mortals scurrying or cowering in terror \nbefore the anger of the Godling. \nDharmic Weakness: Vanity of the Lotus \nConvinced of their own perfection, Godlings can be absolutely insufferable \ncompany at times, particularly around those they consider to be “lesser beings” \n(i.e., everyone but them). Divine Faces receive a permanent Condescending \nNegative Trait, and they are one Trait down to resist fire soul when it’s directly \nsparked by the actions of a lesser being.

Once you read \nthrough to the chilling, world-altering finale, you’ll see why. \nVague Threats \nUglyface Johnson loved the frog pond. Each night, before the Licks oozed \nout of Dallas and Fort Worth to buy his secrets, Uglyface studied himself in the \npond’s mirrored surface. There were many Nosferatu in this unattractive \nmetropolis; they all hated their reflections. \nThe Nosferatu looked over his shoulder. He didn’t want Iron Teeth \nMcGinty to walk up and witness his vanity. \nUglyface’s reflection smiled at him, and he smiled back. He saw the spots \non his face, mottled in such interesting patterns. And his reflection was trying \nto tell him something he couldn’t quite make out. Uglyface sounded out the \nwords with the ripples of the water. “You.. . must.. . taste.. . as.. . good as.. . as.. . \nyou look.” \nHe expected his reflection to spring out of the water and suck him down, \nbut his Final Death came at him from behind instead. Uglyface felt the blood \ndraining from his stomach. He looked down at the row of claws jutting from his \nbelly just below his heart. Wooden fingernails. Uglyface remembered what his \nsire had told him about wooden fingernails. \nHe saw teeth, then blackness. His mouth tasted like ash; then there was only \nbeauty. A vague darkness near oblivion; a beauty greater than his own. \nInformation Networks \nKing Roachman studied his appearance in the mirror. He centered his \nmonocle, sweeping the flakesofcrusty face-skinaway witha brush. His foot-long \nfingers knotted his tie, moving like spider legs. \nThe door to Roachman’s haven slammed shut as someone who was invisible \nbut now wasn’t entered. “Ready for a night of wining and dining with the undead \nof Dallas?” \nRoachman went back to his tie. “Hello, McGinty. Glad you’re coming with \nme. No one’s gonna try anything stupid with you there.” \n“I’ve got some juicy information to sell tonight anyway. Have you heard \nfrom Uglyface?” \n“Nope. Is he missing now too? Lots of us have turned up missing lately, \naccording to my sources. You think somebody’s offing Nosferatu? Maybe those \nhunter fellows I’ve been hearing about from my sources?” \n"

I was busy in my occult library \nreading up on the Wan Xian.” \nRoachman remembered the meeting because he had set it up himself. \nUglyface and McGinty were supposed to meet Hortense’s little crippled friend \ntonight after the Elysium meeting at the community center. A week prior - \nat \nthe previous Elysium meeting - \nthey were supposed to hammer out some lies \nto keep the cripple’s mistress off their backs. No big deal that the preliminary \nmeeting with Uglyface didn’t happen, though. \n“Go ahead and take the meeting with that wheelchair fellow and tell him \nthere’s a new BSD hive in Sherman,” Roachman said. ‘That should keep \nHortense jumping at shadows for a while. You know how she’s always trying to \nfight the designs of the Wyrm.” \nRoachman finished tying his tie, and he and Iron Teeth set out into the \ntunnels. McGinty protested that the king’s route would take forever, then \nsuggested taking the tunnel up to Grapevine then going southwest straight into \nthe city. Roachman didn’t want to use that tunnel because he didn’t want to \nwalk into Elysium with the shit of the cattle all over his shoes.

He said the monster had \nan Old and Hungry Resonance, though.” \nRoachman squinted his tiny little eyes and peered left and right, not \nremembering which way to turn. McGinty sorted through all the creatures in the \nworld of darkness that they inhabited, trying to imagine what kind might have \nsuch a Resonance. \n“It’s not.. . one of them, is it?” \n“Oh no. It couldn’t be. Absolutely not. Well.. . maybe.” \nMcGinty and Roachman turned right, and after stooping through a series \nof warrens and mazes that even the King of the Sewers could hardly navigate, \nthey arrived in one of the storm drains beneath Plano. \n(‘Roachman, what are we going to do about this monster from the Umbra?” \n“Sell the information, I guess.” \nIron Teeth liked the sound of that. “Maybe we could use it to solve our \nHortense problem. Make sure she hears it from the rumor mill. Then, after you \nsell the same info to her little gimp friend tonight, she’ll think it’s solid. She’ll \nthrow a fit, then the prince will get fed up and stick her out in the sun for a few \nminutes, if you know what I mean.

Hurry ahead and \ntake it to LSD.” \nImpotence and Ambition \nHortense of Clan Brujah came to Elysium to convince the Ventrue prince \nthat Dallas needed cleaning up, and that she was just the Lick to do it. She \nwarned him about the nascent Sabbat, she warned him about the encroaching \nwerewolves, she told him of the rumors she’d heard inNovember 1999 about the \nhunters whose auras shined like gold. Somewhere during her diatribe about \nNosferatu overcrowding in Dallas, she started screaming. \n“Those liars! The Nos are sewer-dwelling, shit-sucking liars! And I can \nprove it!” \nTheprince,forhispart,didhisbestto tuneherout. Justafewfeetaway, asmall \ncrowd listened to the Toreador primogen extemporize about some new form of \nfiction. “The whole enterprise is doomed,” the effete Toreador droned, “because \nit uses a comedic structure to tell a tragic tale.” The prince couldn’t keep up with \nthe conversation because of the crackpot Brujah shouting in his ear. \n‘This is all very interesting, Hortense, but I still don’t see why you should \nbe sheriff.” \n“I’m a Brujah.” \n“We’ve already got a Gangrel sheriff. He’s loyal even though his clan \n“He’s a dove. You need a Brujah hawk.” \n“No I don’t.” \n“I’ve got Fortitude and Protean that I learned in the Sabbat before I \nreformed and moved to Dallas. I’m ideally suited.” \nThe prince did some math in his head and determined that having spent so \nmuch time learning Disciplines, Hortense could not possibly have directed her \nexperience into learning how to use those Disciplines effectively, considering \nhow old she was. \n“I don’t think that’s a good idea, Hortense. Sometimes a sheriffs got to be \na diplomat instead of a cop. I’m not sure you possess the vision necessary to \nenforce our Traditions.” \nHortense rolled her eyes. “Fuck all that. The only way to keep us safe is to \nkill anyone who threatens the Masquerade. You might as well name me sheriff \nbecause that’s already what I do. Without me and my ally, Stumpy, this whole \ntown would’ve met its Final Death long ago.” \nThe prince pretended to notice something across the room and started \nwalking away. “Oh look.

Ludovici’s \nirredeemable madness suggested that there must be some connection. The \nstranger seemed oddly familiar with the prince as well, although she had never \nmet the Ventrue before tonight. \nElysium, Ludovici Sinistrati D’Ameno tasted a familiar voice. \n“L&! \n” \nHortense was talking to him. How best to explain what he was doing? In his \nmadness, he heard her staring at him. He remembered that he had something to \ntell her. \n“Ludo? What the fuck are you doing?” \nLudovici fled his perceptions and returned his sight to the Realm of \nWaking. He smiled at Hortense as ifhe had just noticed her. Her glare scared the \nlook from his face. He looked down at his shoes and mumbled. \n“I’m a weird cat,” he said. “I try not to romanticize it.” \n“Are you swimming in auras again?” \n“Yeah. I saw a good one, but it confused me.” \nThe Malkavian could tell Hortense was pissed off about something. That \nwas always a safe assumption with her, considering how hot-blooded her clan \nwas. She glowered about the room, edging closer to him. \n“The prince is trying to fire me again,” she whispered. \n“There’s no time for that now. I’ve heard something. Something big.” \nLudovici was disappointed that this provocative statement hadn’t cheered \nher up. Still, he told her about his conversation with Iron Teeth McGinty. Just \nafter sundown, they’d both arrived at Elysium. In exchange for a small boon, he \ntold her, McGinty had told him about the disappearance of several Nosferatu. \nSomething from the Umbra was up to no good. Again. \n“The End Times are here, just like it says in the Book of Nod, Ludo,” \nHortense said. “This thing from the Umbra, this thing killing Nosferatu, is \nclearly one of the Nictuku.” \n‘‘I think that’s a pretty crazy theory, Hortense.” \n“Good God, man, it’s the only one that makes sense! That clan is complicit \nin its own destruction.” \nLudo allowed his perceptions to catch up to him, and he swam back into \nthe auras. Somehow, it was no defense against Hortense’s designs. She was \nsucking him in like she did every time. Why did she have to have such an \ninteresting aura? \n“Here’s what we do, Ludo: We kidnap Iron Teeth McGinty and feed him \nto the Nictuku.

He took it slow, making patient turns andcoasting \ndown hills. The motor didn’t make much noise at such slow speeds. Although \nthe metis could see in pitchdarkness, he knew the path by heart. He’dcome here \nwith Hortense a hundred times. And aside from Hortense, he’d dealt with \nMcGinty more than any other Lick in town. \nHe found McGinty waiting for him. Always the same place, always on time. \n“We know about the thing from the Umbra that’s eating Nosferatu,” \n“Both your master and her insane friend owe me boons for this, you know.” \n“Agreed. They’ll owe you. Is it Nictuku?” \n‘‘Our Nosferatu sources think so. You know I’ll expect- Aieeeeee!” \nIron Teeth McGinty’s head burst into flame. He screamed as his flailing \nhands slapped at his face. Stumpy felt the elements lingering in the air, waiting \nfor him to realize them. He reached out to Gaia. McGinty’s eyeballs exploded \nfrom his head. The vampire collapsed to the ground. \nWith a whip of his back, Stumpy fell from his wheelchair and inched \nhimself over to the collapsed vampire. Stumpy thought about his missing feet, \nand his missing hands. The thoughts fueled his rage, and he changed form \nStumpy said. “We just want to know this: Is it Nictuku?” \n"

She heard the backdoor slide open and the hydraulic \nlift lowering Stumpy’s chair to the ground. The sound of his wheels came closer \nto them. Ludovici looked up at the sound and threw a few trash bags over their \nchangeling captive, his paranoia overwhelming the half-hearted Arcadian \nprotest. Stumpy rolled up on the pile of trash. \n“You didn’t tell me you’d be out back,” he said. \n“Did you get ... that big-teeth guy I sent you to get?” \n“Yeah, Hortense. He’s waiting in the van.

This Nictuku is no doubt \nvery dangerous.” \nBut Hortense was already walking to the van. “NO more dangerous than the \nthree BSDs I killed when I was in Montreal last year. Let’s go.” \nLudovici realized that, for tonight at least, Hortense was his clanmate. He \nvolunteered to drive. \nPopulation Control \nElysium had peaked by the time Hortense and Ludovici showed up. The \ncurrent scene was strictly post-mortem. The proclamation of the prince that \nthere would be no more Embraces in Dallas for the next 50 years hadn’t gone \nover well with the assembled Licks. Most of them had left in a huff, and the few \nwho remained stood around seeing who could prophecy the most utter doom. \nThe Toreador primogen, though, was still there, deep into the discussion he had \nbegun earlier that evening. His audience stood and snored. Stumpy, and the \ndisoriented fae boy in his lap, rolled past the keeper of Elysium, who figured it \nwas too late in the evening to start kickingout Lupines and changelings. Instead, \nhe invited them to join him at the bar. \nLudovici placed his hand on Hortense’s shoulder to steady himself as he \nprepared to surrender to his perceptions. With an explosion of color, the \nemotions and secret thoughts that lingered in the room revealed themselves to \nthe Malkavian. He looked at the young stranger who sat at the right hand of the \nprince whispering things unheard by Kindred ears. \n“It is just as I suspected,” Ludovici gasped. “Gehenna wears a purple dress \ntonight.” \n“I know.

Where the iron contacted the changeling blood in the beast’s system, a \nstrange spectral feedback began. The Nictuku’s aura became a negative of itself \nand started shrinking. The aura around McGinty seemed to vibrate, speeding up \nto some grand explosion. Then the beast bit his head off and spit out 12 iron \nspikes. They left colorful trails in the air as they fell. \nLudovici leaned over and whispered to Hortense. “That was fucking cool.” \nThe Nictuku staggered about the room, holding the spot McGinty had \nbitten into.

The addiction is so strong, \nhowever, that most Brain Eaters indulge more than once a week after they have \nindulged the first time. \nIn return for dining on this gruesome delicacy, the fomor develops the \npower to make people hallucinate, he no longer needs fear the Delirium, and he \ncan read people’s minds with ease. Worse yet, the fomor retains any psychic \npowers he may have had before being bound to his Bane. To top off all else, the \nbinding operation causes no noticeable physical change in the fomor, allowing \nhim to blend in with the rest of human society without so much as a ripple. \nENTICERS \nEnticers exist to bring out and exploit the worst, most base instinctual \nbehavior in human beings. They live and breathe such raw, powerful sexual \nmagnetism that only the most saintly and reserved victims can control \nthemselves. (And even their resistance ultimately folds.) Regardless of sex or \nsexual orientation, once an Enticer spots a victim, the victim is doomed to the \nfomor’s depredations. \nPentex uses Enticers as Judas goats or Jezebels, depending on the circum- \nstances. Many a valiant and driven werewolf has followed a stunning Enticer \ninto a trap, never realizing his mistake until it was too late. Many a pack of young \nhotheads has been torn apart as its members fought tooth and claw for the \n“affections” of the same fomor. More often than not, an Enticer needs only \nwhisper a few encouraging words in the right ears to accomplish its dire aims. \nShould physical confrontation be necessary, however, the Enticer’s only form of \ndefense is a row of wickedly barbed fangs. \nShould a character ever manage to see through an Enticer’s seductive \nillusion, he might be surprised to see an entirely normal-looking person \nunderneath. Enticer fomori are created by repeated exposure to a highly \naddictive chemical in a special brand of cosmetics distributed by a subsidiary of \nPentex. The chemical creates an intense high in the wearer, while transforming \nthe sweat glands in the wearer’s skin into high-output pheromone factories. \nThese pheromones attract members of either sex equally (regardless of the sex \nof the person wearing the makeup) by dredging up the image of sexual perfection \nin the victim’s mind and lowering the victim’s inhibitions accordingly. \nPentex keeps Enticer fomori compliant very simply by threatening to cut off \nthe Enticer’s supply of its addictive makeup if the Enticer does not do as it is told. \nTHE EOMOBI \n@ \n"

They look human and act human \nand have human motivations. To the casual observer, each appears entirely \nhuman (if a particularly vital and ruthless human). Even the Ferectoi’s formi+ \ndable powers remain concealed when they’re not in use. However, these fomori’s \nresemblance to humanity stops at the surface. Deep down, the Ferectoi are \nWyrmcreatures through and through. While some might struggle with their true \nnature, that nature always wins out eventually. \nIn the mean time, the Ferectoi enjoy all the pleasures of power and luxury \nlife on Earth offers. Banes and lesser Wyrm beings serve them, as do the \nunwitting humans the Ferectoi dominates in his human semblance. \nEOMORI EAMILIBS \nSometimes, groups of Banes choose the path of least resistance in bonding \nwith human hosts. These Banes congregate around blights or Hellholes in \nremote backwoods areas and infest the sequestered, inbred families that some- \ntimes also congregate in such isolated areas. Once they have become fomori \nthemselves, the older members of these families do most of the work for these \nBanes thereafter. When their offspring grow old enough, the parents take them \nto the site where the Banes wait and perform a twisted bastardization of the Rite \nof Passage. This rite makes the young adult part of the family “right and proper,” \nending the hellish existence the child has likely endured thus far. The child then \nreceives his first taste of the special Charm (and Taint) that runs in the family, \notherwise known as the “family gift.” \nERBAKEEBT \nThese beasts are almost comically monstrous. They scuttle along on long, \nmuscular arms and stunted legs. Their fingers and prehensile toes stretch out of \nproportion to their limbs. Their luminescent, unblinking eyes bulge grotesquely \nfrom the sockets. Liver spots stipple their slimy skin, and they communicate in \nporcine snorts and clicks. Morbidly obese “queen” Freakfeet lounge about laying \neggs and being served by the more able males of the species. \nOddly enough, not even the Pentex Corporation appreciates the existence \nof these disgusting beasts. Originally created by joining a Sludge Elemental \n(known as a H’ruggling Bane) with a human-amphibian genetic hybrid, the first \ngeneration of Freakfeet escaped from Pentex’s service after an explosion at the \nlab that created them. When given the opportunity, Pentex field operatives \n“sanitize” Freakfeet hives where they find them. Unfortunately, however, \nFreakfeet were designed to be prolific in any climactic conditions. The creatures \nmaintain subterranean hives all over the world, regardless of Pentex’s every \neffort to cull the expanding population. \nDespite the human DNA that led to their creation, Freakfeet young do not \ngestate within a Freakfeet queen. Rather, the queen injects her fertilized eggs \ninto the body of a living human being with a sharp stinger/ ovipositor at the base \nof her spine. Freakfeet males gather human hosts by venturing up through sewer \npipes in urban areas and abducting them.

Gorehounds revel in what they become, living up to whatever \nghastly potential they possess. The transformation into a Gorehound usually \nmarks the human’s achievement of a lifelong goal. \nDeranged loners brimming with repressed rage and sadistic fantasies make \nthe best prospective Gorehounds. To capitalize on this fresh pool of potential \nfomori, the Pentex Corporation distributes Bane-possessed slasher videotapes \nthrough a shell company called Slaughterhouse Video. Merely watching the \ntapes opens the viewer to possession by the Bane. Once in place, the Bane helps \nreduce the viewer’s inhibitions, opening the floodgates on the barely contained \nsadism. Inspired by the “heroes” of the slasher tapes he watcher, the young \nGorehound sets out to stake his own claim on trademarked over-the-top \nviolence. The serial torture and murder of which Gorehounds are capable and \nall too happy to indulge in knows no bounds. A new Gorehound might begin his \ncareer on a small scale (say by mutilating household animals in his neighbor- \nhood), but his ambition to indulge in more sensational violence grows as his \nconfidence grows. \nShould a Gorehound ever be caught or confronted, he will fight to escape \nfor as long as he can move, causing as much crippling pain and destruction as he \ncan. While unreliable as operatives or employees of Pentex, Gorehounds do the \nwork of the Wyrm with admirable zeal, and they provide an excellent distraction \nor scapegoat for actors undertaking more important Pentex initiatives. \nHOLLOW \nMEN \nAlthough no one is entirely certain of where the Hollow Men came from, \nmost speakers who have a reputable opinion on the subject agree that no other \nbreed of fomor has existed longer onEarth. These horrifying monsters have done \nmuch to bring about the destruction and ultimate corruption of Gaia. \nFrom the outside (and adistance), Hollow Men appear human, if somewhat \ndistracted and fidgety. Closer examination, however, reveals more hints to the \ntrue nature of just what a Hollow Man is. A Hollow Man’s skin bulges and ripples \nwhen he moves. His joints bend stiffly or with a too-fluid grace. His chest fails \nto rise and fall with the rhythm of respiration. Occasionally, a particularly alert \nviewer might even see a dark shape scuttling across the Hollow Man’s skin, \nclimbing out of one orifice to disappear into another. The Hollow Men appear \nthus because the bodies they wear on the outside are little more than convenient \nhomes for a horde of smaller animals possessed by a Scavenger Pack Bane. The \nspirit of the human shell remains intact enough to bond with the Bane, granting \nthe pitiful human a grotesque type of immortality in return for taking the \nScavenger Pack into his body and carrying out the urges of the Wyrm. \nThe types of animals most likely to make up a Scavenger Pack include rats, \nsnakes, bees, roaches and the larger species of spiders. \nT \nH E  EOMORI \n@ \n"

Should the fomor ever step out of line and try to do the right thing, \none or the other will assuredly make him pay. Fomori, as characters, have little \nto no redeeming value whatsoever. How then can you possibly hope to use such \na character in an ongoing chronicle? \nOn one hand, the easy answer to this question is to use fomori as Pentex and \nthe Wyrm intend: as the bad guys. Fomori make excellent villains, shock troops \nand Wyrm-beast mooks. No better evidence of the Corrupter’s presence on \nEarth than the existence of these monsters. Roleplaying a fomor offers a player \nthe chance to explore the deepest, most vile depths to which his imagination can \nsink then put that nastiness aside when the character meets his inevitable end. \nLetting your character give in wholly to his evil nature (for the sake of plot) is \none of the most cathartic experiences roleplaying has to offer. At the same time, \nthe character’s story demonstrates the price of power and the importance of \nkeeping your darker urges tightly in check. \nBy the same token, it’s just fun to play the bad guy sometimes. If you’re \nenjoying yourself by playing a right bastard, the other players should have just \nas much fun trying to put a stop to your nefarious schemes. Nothing is more fun \nthan overcoming an unrepentantly evil opponent, especially if that opponent \nis one’s equal in all but motivation. Playing the villain everyone loves to hate \nis an awful lot of fun, even when the good guys finally manage to pull together \nand conquer you once and for all. \nOn the other hand, one can tell a compelling story in which the fomori \ncharacters are the protagonists. This type of story, however, is not nearly as much \nfunas the preceding one. Fomor-centered stories are some of the most horrifying \nand tragic tales one can find in the World of Darkness. Consider the life-cycle \nof the standard fomor: A bleak, depressing or violent life leaves gaps in the soul \nof the potential victim. A spirit of corruption finds (or is directed to) those gaps, \nand it begins to attach itself to them. The hapless individual feels this intrusion, \nbut he is powerless to prevent it. After all, some part of him wants the spirit to \nfill the void within him. When the fusion is complete, the victim’s body warps \nand mutates to match the changes that go on in his mind. After the transforma- \ntion (or before, in many cases), a corporation driven by a force more sinister than \ngreed tries in every way to exploit the new monster in any way it can. Finally, \noften before the poor, pitiful wretch can come to grips with the horrifying \nchanges that have been so rudely thrust upon him, he runs afoulof vicious zealots \nwho want to tear him apart with tooth and claw for no better reason than the \nfact that he even exists. \n"

The Storyteller should assess the advantage the \nColony Powers grant the character and price them accordingly. \nCorrupted Visions (four Traits) \nWhen the player spends a Mental Trait and wins a Mental Test against his \nopponent, the fomor causes his victim to suffer from compelling hallucinations. \nFomori use this Power to prod victims into action or to drive them over the edge \ninto insanity. The victim’s player may banish these hallucinations by spending \na Willpower Trait. \nDarksight (two Traits) \nThe fomor can see in perfect darkness, and the player suffers no Trait \npenalties for impaired visibility.

Since \nevery wraith is an individual, complete with carefully plotted goals and driving Passions, it \nonly makes sense that their foibles, problems and advantages be similarly unique. \nEach wraith character has a personal set of Attributes, Abilities, Arcanoi, Passions and \nFetters. Some, though, have their own spins on such things, or peculiarities that aren’t \ncommon to other wraiths. Thus, we give you Merits and Flaws for Oblivion characters. \nRemember: A modifier to bidding affects the number of Traits required to enter a \nchallenge. A one-Trait bid penalty means that you must bid an extra Trait on a challenge. \nA modifier to resolution affects total Traits for resolving ties and overbids. \nCORPOREAL \nMERITSAND \nELAWS \nBOTCHED \nMOLIITION( 1-3 TRAIT \nTE LAW) \nSomething went horribly, horribly wrong during a Moliate attempt, and your character’s \nCorpus has resisted attempts to change it back. This deformity gives him problems, and it’s \nnot going to go away soon. Perhaps some guilty, dark part of your character’s psyche believes \nthat he really deserves to reflect the deformity, or maybe he’s just an unlucky punk who’s \nstuck with an extra tentacle for the rest of his existence. \nFor one Trait, your character has a relatively minor and annoying moliation “scar.” \nPerhaps he has an ugly-looking hunch, a discoloration or some other noticeable incongru- \nity. This incongruity makes him easily recognizable unless he takes steps to cover it, and it’s \nin an inconvenient place where it’ll take some work to conceal it. A funny color under one’s \narm doesn’t count. A hand that’s been moliated into a gnarled, inflexible lump is a much \nmore reasonable expression of this Flaw. \nFor two Traits, the moliation problem is fairly nasty. Maybe your character has a \nwithered arm, or his skin is scaly in patches due to a failed attempt at creating armor. When \nthe botched moliation isn’t concealed, the character suffers an extra negative Social Trait \nof Repugnant, for which you gain no extra Traits. Your character might be able to conceal \nthis problem, but it takes some real effort. \nFor three Traits, some terrible mistake inconveniences your character horribly. Not only \ndo you suffer a Negative Social Trait of Repugnant, but you also suffer a one-Trait penalty to \nall challenges where the specific moliation might hinder the character. For instance, if your \ncharacter’s legs are fused together above the knees, he will have trouble running or balancing. \nIf his head is sunk into the center of his torso, he’ll have difficulty seeing peripherally or \nspeaking to people.

Of course, you still suffer a \none-Trait coordination penalty if your character uses both hands at once, but you incur no \nadditional penalty for using an uncoordinated hand. \nInterestingly, many wraiths seem to slide toward ambidexterity over time.

For whatever reason, you suffer a two-Trait resolution penalty \nin all challenges with Deathsight (Oblivion, p. 160). \n~ o v N o ( 3  \nTRAIT  law) \nSome place or event holds such significance to your character that he can’t leave it. \nMaybe he can haunt only a house where he lived and died, or perhaps he haunts a particular \ntree. You cannot move more than 100 yards from this location, and you must take it as a \nFetter. \nNaturally, this Flaw can limit your story possibilities a great deal, so choose carefully! \nShould the character ever resolve this Fetter, you will be able to leave the area, thankfully. \nMost wraiths just have dark urges in their minds encouraging them to do nasty things. \nFor your wraith, though, those urges manifest in the form of asmall plasmic animal or object. \nIt can manifest at odd times, even moving around to interact with things as if it has one \nPhysical Trait. If it’s discorporated by force, the Shadow simply dissolves back into your \ncharacter’s head to torment him internally. (You can’t get away from it that easily!) While \nthe Shadow exists in this external form, you must speak aloud to address it. \nYou should carry a prop or card that represents this disembodied Shadow. From time \nto time, your Storyteller or Shadowguide may rule that it’s harassing someone or playing \naround with objects in the vicinity. \nDISEMBODIED \n! h A D O W ( 3  \nT R A I T  PLAW) \nU M B R A L  c O N N G C T I O N ( 3  T R A I T  PLAW) \nBy some quirk of chance, your character’s existence extends into the middle Umbra, \nthe mirror of the vibrant living lands. Although he cannot see or affect the Umbra, spirits \nthat wander there can see him as a pale shade. Werewolves or magicians can even use their \nmagical powers to affect such an unfortunate character, binding him or banishing him while \nhe remains unaware of what exactly is going on. \nDARE \ng A T E  (5 T R A I T  PLAW) \nYour character is doomed not only to an existence more horrid than this wraithly one, \nbut to a final end where all of his struggles come to naught. Worse still, he is aware of this \nfate through vague dreams, hunches or premonitions - \nor maybe just because some \nmalicious demon or Shadow told him about it. At some point, his struggles will end, and he \nwill go on to a fate more terrible than Oblivion, more repugnant than Spectrehood and more \ninevitable than death. Your Storyteller will design this final end, of which you may have \noccasional premonitions. \nU N K N O W N  d E T T E R ( 1 - 5  T R A I T  M E R I T )  \nSome connection ties your character to a place or object, but he has no idea what it is \nor why he’s connected. Certain Arcanoi might help one to identify this Fetter, but otherwise \nit’s a mystery. This Merit is actually quite handy, though, because nobody else is likely to \n"

Then \nagain, a wraith can’t protect a Fetter if he doesn’t know what it is. \nThe value of this Merit depends on the value and durability of the Fetter in question. \nIf the Fetter is unlikely to suffer from outside intervention, it costs more to be unknown. If \nneither your character nor his enemies ever discover it, it may exist forever! A Fetter that’s \nat risk of discovery or that is more easily disposable costs less. \nC O L D  ( B TRAIT MERIT) \nRemember those tales of ghosts causing “cold spots” in haunted areas! They’re true with \nyour character. When he walks through an area, the temperature drops noticeably in the \nliving lands. This drop can draw attention to the character’s presence, and it could even be \ntracked and measured with heat-sensing gear. On the other hand, most mortals will only \nshiver and try to get away. By applying the effects of this Merit carefully, a ghost can \nencourage people to leave a haunt or to pay attention to him, or even communicate crudely \nwith the living. (This cold spot is just a blob of low-temperature, though. The wraith with \nthis Merit does not appear as a ghostly silhouette if viewed through infrared goggles.) \n~ u c w ( 3  \nTRAIT MERIT) \nAll right, your character can’t be all that lucky - \nshe’s dead, after all -but \nFortune \ndoes seem to favor her. You have three Lucky Traits that you can use for retests on any \nchallenge. As usual, you can only use one such Trait on any given challenge. These Traits \nrefresh each game session. \nOTHER HALE (3 TRAIT MERIT) \nSome philosophers believe that each person is a half-soul, who can find completion \nonly by discovering its other half in another person. Well, your character did just that. This \nother half is just about anyone still living - \ncasual acquaintance, old friend, relative, \nwhatever - \nbut the depth of the connection is profound. Count this individual as one of \nyour wraith‘s Fetters (no, not as afree one). Whenever the character is near this individual \n(within, say, the same room), he regains one Corpus Trait per hour. Any bonuses that you’d \ngain for acting on the person are doubled, making it very easy for your character to attune \nthe individual and then use his Arcanoi on him. \nYou cannot take both this Merit and the Merit: True Love. \nB R I g H T ( 4  T R A I T  M E R I T )  \nEven the Shroud cannot staunch the intensity of your character’s drives. His desire to \nexist beyond life is so powerful that he practically radiates his emotions into the living lands. \n(Or, perhaps he doesn’t intend to do so, but for some reason, he finds that the Shroud doesn’t \nkeep him from interacting there.) You gain a one-Trait bonus to resolution of tests across \nthe Shroud, and any mortal who cares to interact with your character gains a similar one- \nTrait bonus on the test to notice him. Furthermore, all mortals gain a free retest against the \nFog when dealing with such a character. The emotions he generates are so intense that it \nimpresses him on their minds and memories. \nTRUE \nh V E ( 4  TRAIT \nM E R I T )  \nAt some point, in either life or death, your character found a true love. Memories of \nthis joy buoy him in difficult situations, and the thought of his love is enough to keep him \npressing on when the afterlife seems stacked against him. You gain a one-Trait bonus on all \nchallenges in which your character is acting to directly maintain his relationship with his \ntrue love (for as long as his true love reciprocates the feeling). \nYou cannot take both this Merit and the Merit: Other Half. \n"

For those of you who are new to the publication, let me take a second \nto acquaint you with just what you’ve got here. (For those of you who already \nknow, you may skip ahead to Cynthia’s article on staying in character.) \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gaps in \nyour White Wolf LARP environment. We offer rules for new character types, \noriginal story lines to work into your chronicles, guides for keeping your games \nunder control and running smoothly and rules updates you won’t find in any \nother Mind’s Eye release. Plus, you’ll find answers to the questions that have \nplagued you, original World of Darkness fiction and columns from people \nwho’ve been LARPing or working here at White Wolf (or both) for years. \nIn this issue, we delve into the acting side of live-action roleplaying. \nCynthia Summers and Matthew Hooper provide insight on how to truly make \nyour character come to life on the mobile stage of roleplaying. On the other end \nof the spectrum, I offer rules for fomori and slip in the heretical Dharma rules \nthat didn’t make it into Laws of the East. And that’s just a sample of what’s \nin store for you here. We’ll also take a look at what you’ve missed in previous \nissues (if you’re joining us late) and what to expect in the future of Mind’s Eye \nTheatre and White Wolf in general. \nIn the next issue of the Journal, we’ll finish up Laura Hanson’s series on \ncostuming, I’ll say a few words about running a LARP chronicle, and I’ll make \nan unrelated revelation you might not expect. \nUntil then, you can help make the Journal even better. Send us letters on \nyour opinions about the state of live-action roleplaying today. Send us \nquestions about the features and rules you see here, as well as notes about the \nbroken rules you come across in different MET publications. Send us horror \nstories about games gone wrong and how your player characters fixed them. \nWe’re interested in all aspects of live-action roleplaying, and we want to know \nwhat you think. \nStick around. The Journal is on the cutting edge of the live-action genre; \nwe’ve got something for everybody. And if we don’t have it yet, let us know. \nWe’ll get it for you. \nCurl Bowen \nDeveloper \ncarl@white-wolf. corn \nWhite Wolf \nAttn: Mind’s Eye Theatre Journal Developer \n735 Park North Blvd, Suite 128 \nClarkston, GA 30021 \nUSA \n\n\nSTAYING \nI N  CHARACTER \nby Cynthia Summers \nCynthia knows things. She’s been developing Mind’s Eye Theatre for \nmore than a year now, and she’s been pkzying Mind’s Eye Theatre since she \nstarted working for White Wolf in 1994. She’s one of the resident LARPing \nexperts in house. As an observer of the dynamics of he-action rokplayingsociety , \nshe is without peer. \nWhen you go to aMind’s Eye Theatre game, or any LARP for that matter, \none of the game’s greatest charms is the total immersion in the scene. For the \nnext several hours, you’re not who you are at home. You’re the dread prince of \nthe city or the brave knight questing for the treasure or the ghost that’s been \nterrorizing the kids on Lovers’ Lane. When you’re at the game, you have a \ncharacter. Unfortunately, there are numerous distractions that can make \nmaintaining that character challenging at best, impossible at worst. This is the \nchallenge of every actor and every roleplayer - \nhow to maintain character. \nThere are a number of reasons why you may have trouble in the first place, but \nfor every reason, there is certainly a solution. \nB E I N G  AROUND \nOTHERS \nW H O  \nA R E  OUTOE PLAY \nSometimes, you get a couple of folks who just saw the latest Star Wars and \nsimply must discuss it right there in the middle of the game (and they sure don’t \nsound like the Red Talons they’re supposed to be.. .). Or you have to deal with \nsome fool who insists on quoting you the entirety of Monty Python’s The Life of \nBrian to prove he can. Then you have the two who haven’t seen each other since \nthe panty raid at Gropecon’97, and they just reunited in the middle of the game. \nAsk your Storyteller about designating a spot in the game site as out-of- \nplay and announcing at the beginning of the night where it is. Those who are \nbeing noisy should be encouraged to take their discussion elsewhere. Don’t go \ninto the area unless you have to. If you’re having trouble maintaining \ncharacter, it’ll be that much harder around a bunch of folks who are there to \nsmoke, greet their long-lost buddies or whatever. \nTHE PHYSICAL \nTHINGS \nEating, drinking, and sleeping - \nlittle things that our alletoo-human \nbodies crave - \ncan sometimes run roughshod over the mood in a chronicle \n(particularly for those playing the non-living). People tend to drop character \n\n\nfantasy works or going to the movies? If you don’t know how your character \nviews these things, that can really hamper staying in character when you’re \naround others who are discussing the movie that surely inspired a Chrysalis or \ntwo. Even Ghengis Khan took a break. \nDAMN, I’VE C ~ O T T O  S I T O O P  \nSometimes you’ve got to leave the action. Maybe you’re going to play \nanother character for the Storyteller, maybe you’ve been asked to sit away from \nthe in-play area while your character runs a ritual or drives somewhere, or \nyou’ve got to leave early for a real-life job. There are definitely more viable \noptions than making the out-of-play sign and leaving. \nIf you’re going to do something in another part of the game (playing a \nStoryteller character or helping at check-in), then consider excusing yourself \nin character to make a phone call, check email or do some other little thing \nthat should naturally occur off-stage. Before you return, take a moment to \nreorient yourself and re-enter to whatever chaos greets you. The same option \nis open if you’re leaving for a job or other event. Leave under some character \npretext (answeringapage, feeding thecat, writing thepontifex), make your in- \ncharacter farewells and depart. Doing so is a lot more story-friendly than simply \nbarging out and making a great deal of out-of-character noise. \nIn the case of driving, rituals or other tasks that have a time requirement, \nyou need not sit and twiddle your thumbs, nor fall into out-of-play conversa- \ntion you’re not interested in. Grab a book or something that your character \nmight actually be interested in, or think about what your character is doing \nwhile running the ritual, hacking the system or driving. Did she run a red light? \nDid she take extra care with drawing her circles? Storytellers may ask such \nthings as plot fodder, but even if they don’t, it can be a neat detail to bring back \nto play, in addition to keeping you focused. \nM O M ,  WE’RE \nBORED! \nThen, last but not least, there’s that great enemy of the roleplayer - \nboredom. Sitting by yourself doing nothing seems to be one of the greatest \ntemptations to all sorts ofnaughtiness. It can also be apowerful motive to slide \nout of character. After all, you’re not doing anything, so why bother? \nIf you foresee a slow evening for an in-play circumstance, or there’s a \nchance the event you were planning for doesn’t go off, bring things with you \nthat your character could do to keep busy, such as a book, the tools of your craft \nor a game. Chess seems to be the default sport of kings, but backgammon, go, \nmancala or mah jhong are equally valid. Plus there’s always a deck of cards. If \nyou must sit out, then you’ll have something to keep busy with. Ifyou’re in play, \n\n\nseeing you with something in your hands may well bring over curious observers, \nand some of the best roleplaying can spring from in-play interest. It also \nsquashes the risk of sliding out of character and distracting those around you. \nIt could be that the character itself has gone a little stale. You may feel that \nthe character has reached its limits, and he has no more story to tell. Consider \na brief walkabout or time away - \neven the sweetest song can get old if it’s \nplayed too many times. Some downtime may bring you back refreshed and \nraring to go, or you may find that you really have reached the end of the road. \nIf the latter is the case, then go gracefully - \nwhether into the sunset or \nValhalla - \nand take what you learn into your next incarnation. \n\n\nI \nby Richard E. Dansky \nC ~ A B B A  HEY, \nGABBA \nHEY, \nNOT O N E O E  \nUs \nor \nP R E c r s E L r  WHY & L O #  YOUR \nN o N - L A R P I N ~  \nIRIENDS \nTHINK YOU’RE \nNUTS \nIf you’re reading this column, you fall into one of two classes of people: players of Mind’s \nEye Theatre or my immediate family. If you’re one of the former (and the odds are, I think, \npretty good), then you’ve probably had a conversation that goes something like this: \nFRIEND \nHi there! Want to go catch a movie Friday? \nYOU \nUmm, sorry, I can’t. It’s Masquerade night, and I really have to be there. \nFRIEND \nYou said that two weeks ago. And two weeks before that. \nYOU \nI know, I know, but this is something I’ve been working towards for a long time, and I \nhave to be there tonight or the Ventrue primogen will ... \nFRIEND \nWhatever. Say hi to Count Chocula for me. \nSounds familiar, doesn’t it? Not only that, but it’s incredibly frustrating. After all, you \nwant to spend time with your friends who don’t play the game, but it seems like every time \nyou talk to them, they’re demanding that you give up a game session that invariably contains \nsome crucial chain of events. (And I hope I’m not going out on a limb here by assuming that \nyou do indeed have friends who don’t play.) \nYour friends, on the other hand, see every attempt to be social stymied because you’ve \ngot to go to the game. Even worse, they see all of your free time sucked up by this game to \nsuch an extent that they’re ready to hire Harvey Keitel to kidnap and deprogram you (on \nthe condition that he promises to keep his pants on at all times). \nIt’s not a pretty situation, and it’s one that can lead to a lot of strain on both you and \nyour non-gaming social circle. Left untended, that sort of dilemma can cause resentment, \nwreck friendships and generate enough angst to fuel every Oblivion chronicle on the \n(OK, the wise-ass who said, “Both of them?” is getting a stem talking-to when this \ncolumn is over. Count on it.) \nDealing with those who are “outside the tribe” of gamers has always been problematic, \nbut it gets even more so when you have problems dealing with non-LARPers who are at least \ninitially friendly to the idea of LARP. Note, however, that “Friendly to the idea of LARP” \n\n\nis not semantically equivalent to “Ripe fodder for recruitment into your little ghoul army.” \nA friend can appreciate that you have fun playing Masquerade without having the slightest \ninclination to do so herself, and repeated attempts to haul her into play willy-nilly will \nsquander that appreciation rapidly. \nLet’s put it this way: Many of my friends regard Arnold Schwarzenegger as a luminous \nparadigm of the thespian craft. I think he’s got the dramatic range of a kangaroo’s discus toss, \nbut I certainly don’t begrudge my friends their enjoyment. I wish them happiness when they \nget together for that boffo Commando/ Red Heat double feature playing down at the campus \ncinema series, but I’m not going to partake myself, thanks. \nThe same goes for LARPing. Just because someone doesn’t immediately condemn your \nvampireLARPasa toolofsatan (who, incidentally,reallyshouldhave kickedAmold’sassmuch \nharder in Endof Days), she’snot necessarily ready to dive whole-heartedly into the game. Maybe \nshe just appreciates the fact that you’re having a good time. There is middle ground. Honest. \nUnfortunately, there’s a steady, basic miscommunication between the LARP commu- \nnity and the rest of the world as to what exactly is going on once the capes come out and \nthe fangs appear. To all but the most closely proximate non-tribesman, that Vampire LARP \nthing you do is a “game.” On a certain level, they’re right. It’s a game, a simulation and an \nexercise that you do for the sake of fun and social interaction. \nHowever, where the problem comes in is your definition of a “game” versus theirs. After \nall, they think you’re playing a game in the same way that they’d play chess or Parcheesi or \nFrogger. You play, someone wins, and it’s over. That’s it, end of story, it’s time to move on. \nYou, however, are aware that you are instead partaking in a chronicle, a long-running \nseries of interconnected stories detailing character growth and conflict, and carried out over \na series of sessions that can last years. \nWhat we have here, as the man said, is failure to communicate. Oops. \nIs this anyone’s fault? Of course not - \nat least not initially. Most of the folks out there \nhave certain perceptions of what a game is, how it’s played and what its demarcations are. \nThere’s no reason for them to expect that MET behaves any differently, after all. On the \nother hand, you have every reason to expect your friends to be understanding of your need \nto devote time to something that you’ve invested a lot of work and emotional energy into. \nTherein, to be honest, lies the rub. A chronicle is not an episodic sort of thing. It’s \ncumulative. Plots evolve and move forward. Characters become more complex and more \nfully realized. Social interactions acquire depth. Plus, there are more and more people whose \ncharacters you have to consider as each session rolls past. \nThat sounds fairly generic, right? Every activity gets more complex with time. But you, \nyou’ve put innumerable hours into your plans and building your alliances. You’ve spent lots \nof downtime writing reports, sending in-character emails and arranging brief between- \nsessions roleplaying moments. You’ve laid out cash, at the very least, for costuming. You’ve \nput a ton of energy into maneuvering yourself into a position where you can grab power in \nthe city and learn that new Discipline you’ve had your eye on. Now you’re ready to put areal \nstick up your arch-rival’s butt, but it’s all going to depend on the next session, and you had \nbetter be there to make sure all goes according to plan. \nBesides, if you skip the session, that son of a bitch Ventrue suddenly jumps two points \nahead of you on the experience curve, which means he’s in that much better position to \ncrush everything you’ve worked for, kill your character, and render the long-winded setup \nin the previous paragraph moot. \n(Side note: Why is it that the most intense roleplayers, the ones who put in the absolute \nmost time plotting, scheming, building characters, acquiring experience, shmoozing fellow \nplayers and generally working to bend the game to their will are inevitably the guys you hate \n\n\n-\n-\n \nof power for the sake of benefiting their characters or screwing over people he doesn’t like.] \nCombating this sort of thing often turns into a vendetta for even the most reasonable \nfolks. They’re willing to lose status, have plans come to naught and even kiss beloved \ncharacters good-bye - \nbut not if that asshole is the one who benefits. After all, that asshole \nwill, ifcrowned prince, ruin the game, killoff tons of characters and generally wreckeveryone’s \nfun. Unfortunately, to prevent this outcome, otherwise-well-balanced people are forced into \nan ever-widening spiral of commitment, just to keep pace with the schmuck du jour. \nOf course, to an outside observer, this phenomenon looks like a rapid descent into \nobsessive-compulsive behavior, and possibly an Academy Award-nominated role for \nWinona Ryder when they finally make that movie about you.) \nSo let’s take a step back to that hypothetical conversation we started things with. Your \nfriend sees everything you’re doing to culminate all of the work you’ve done for the character \nand cut off Ye Schmuck0 Grande, and he decides that you’ve gone LARP crazy and that you \nno longer have any use for people outside that special little world. After all, on those rare \noccasions when you do manage to hang out, you talk about what you’ve done recently - \nwhich is LARP. \n(Side Note #2: This sort of situation is usually not helped by infrequent sessions of \nhanging out. After all, at those moments you talk about what you’ve done recently, which \noften consists of ... what you’ve done at the LARP. It’s an affliction common to all \nenthusiastic hobbyists - \nyou should hear fantasy baseball players ramble on for hours about \nthe minutiae of the Cubs’ backup middle infielder situation - \nbut it’s inevitably really \nincredibly annoying to the non-hobbyists forced to endure it.) \nYou, on the other hand, have decided that your friend is an insensitive bastard for \ndemanding that you abandon everything you’ve worked for just to catch a movie that will \nno doubt be on video within the hour anyway. Plus, he’s showing an appalling lack of \nunderstanding of all the work, passion and probably money you’ve put into this, and exactly \nhow much will go down the drain if you miss the session. \nSo who’s at fault? Again, nobody is. It’s just a miscommunication. However, that \nmiscommunication will do a Godzilla-style number on your friendships with folks outside \nthe game that you’re in if it’s allowed to continue. This column isn’t me trying to be funny \nor get in a backhanded slam at folks who genuinely enjoy playing MET full-throttle. This \nstuff happens, and it happens a lot, which is a shame. After all, like I keep on saying, MET \nis a game. It’s supposed to add to your life and make it more fun. Stressing friendships does \nnot, by my definition of the word, add to anyone’s fun, and it behooves you and your friends \noutside the tribe to make some efforts to bridge that gap of communication before anything \nirrevocable occurs. \nThe most important step in achieving some sort of dktente between your LARPing and \nnon-LARPing lives is clearing up the misunderstanding over what sort ofgame it is. The best \nway to go about it is to couch it in terms that your friends will recognize and relate to. If they \nbowl, they’d be offended if you asked them to skip a league night for amovie, especially with \nthe league championship (and the coveted gold-plated ugly shoes trophy) on the line. \nTherefore, it’s only a short jump to comparing your showdown with Vinnie the Ventrue to \nhis showdown with the guys who normally hang out on lane 21. \nCouching the session in question in terms like that helps on several levels. First of all, \nit provides an easily understandable parallel for what you’re doing and why you’re doing it. \nYou’ve put a lot of time into the character, he’s put a lot of time into his game. You’ve put \na lot of money into costuming, he’s bought a strike ball, a spare ball and a pair of God- \ndamned ugly shoes. And so it goes. By bringing what you’ve done into close comparison to \nwhat he’s done, it suddenly makes more sense. \nI \n\n\nsignificantly. If your behaviors suddenly aren’t so different from his behaviors, he may well have \na more sympathetic view toward what you’re doing and how you’re going about doing it. \n(Then again, your buddy may just decide that he, too, is an irredeemable freak, and \nbegin the process of ritual self-immolation in the nearest crosswalk. Those, however, are the \nrisks you have to take for the greater good.) \nIt’s a small step, but it’s a worthwhile one. You can’t mandate understanding on your \nfriends’ part; you can only provide the tools and opportunities by which they just might \nunderstand why exactly you do that wacky thing you do. Think of yourself as an enabler, and \nsuddenly you’ll feel much better about the process. \nThen again, there always remains the slim possibility that maybe, just maybe, your \nfriend is right and you actually are devoting too much time to the game. Take a minute and \npopopenyourcopyofLawsof theNight. Somewhere in that bookisadisclaimer abouthow, \nif you’re calling the primogen at 327 in the morning to discuss who did what to whose socks \nat Elysium, you need to take a break. That one’s in there for a reason, folks, and it’s not to \npad word count. If enough people are saying, “Gee, you’re playing that game an awful lot,” \nit’s worth a minute or two to do a mental check on exactly how much time, effort and money \nyou’re putting into play. If you can answer in the affirmative to more than half of these \nquestions, you might want to take a step back: \n1-Do you get your mail and find yourself vaguely annoyed that none of it is addressed \nto your character? \n2-Does your character have a larger wardrobe than you do? \n3-Does your email application have a separate folder for IC game correspondence that’s \nslightly larger than a scanned-in copy of War and Peace? \n4-Do the waitrons at the local 24 hour restaurants know you by your character name \nrather than your real one? \n5-Does the sight of a T-shirt emblazoned with the exhortation, “DO NOT TELL ME \nABOUT YOUR CHARACTER!” inspire sudden rage in you? \n6-Do you look forward to traveling to exotic locales because they’ve been described in \nWhite Wolf books and you can’t wait to have your character announce that he’s spoken to \nthe canonical White Wolf characters? \n7-Have you ever been in an uncomfortable discussion or situation and had someone \nsay, “Why are your arms folded across your chest all of a sudden?” \n8-Do you find yourself mentally assigning Negative Traits to people you don’t like? \n9-Have you ever seriously considered dating someone else’s character, even if you \nwouldn’t touch that particular player with a biohazard suit on? \n10-Have you ever screwed up at school or work and found yourself actually trying to \nexplain to your superior/ professor that it wasn’t your fault because the Nosferatu kept you \n11-Have you ever shown off your copy of the old Laws of the Night and proudly \nidentified it as a first printing because a.) the spine lettering is unreadable and b.) it doesn’t \nhave the typo on the back cover? \nIf you answered “Yes” to a majority of these questions, it’s probably time to slow down \na bit. If you answered“Yes, and your point is?” it’s definitely time to take a break, and possibly \ntime for another hobby. \nThis is not to say that because you play MET, you automatically play too much MET. \nAfter all, I like the fact that you’re playing the game. It means, among other things, that you \nbuy MET-related products, and I get to keep churning out this nifty column for which they \npay me quite nicely. Having devoted an ungodly number of hours and an untold amount of \n\n\n-\n-\n \nstart decrying the evils of the game system. I mean, come on, people. \nHowever, it’s easy to fall into the great trap of the continuing live-action chronicle, \nwhich is to say its cumulative nature. Yes, this week is when everything comes to a head - \nbut odds are, there’s going to be something just as vital at the next session, and the one after \nthat, and so on. There’s always another idiot or munchkin or asshole or twink who’s on the \nverge of ruining the game if you, personally, don’t interpose yourself. There’s always another \nemail to write, just to make sure that everything’s going according to plan, another XP to \npick up to ensure that you’re character will survive the next game. And so it goes - \nit’s no \nbetter or worse or different than computer gamers who hog-tie themselves to Ciuilizutiun so \nthey can build one more chariot unit before bed, except that there are other people involved, \nfor better or for worse. \nIf you lose sight of that, then just maybe your friend might have a point. After all, no \nmatter how many times you throw yourself on the grenade of El Twinko, every chronicle \nends sooner or later. Every game winds down. And when it does, you want to be able to dust \nyourself off, smile nostalgically at your much-marked character sheet, and walk off with your \nlife having been made better by the fact that you played. You don’t want to look around at \nthe wreckage with a wide-eyed expression of panic and start planning a new game just \nbecause you have no idea what the hell else to do with your time. \nYou have a responsibility, after all, a responsibility to yourself. You do not have a \nresponsibility to Save The Game. If Baron Von Twinkenstein is ruining it, you don’t \nnecessarily have to be the hero every time. If he’s really that bad, someone else will probably \ntry to help; if he isn’t, maybe you need to relax. And if worse comes to worst, you can always \nstart a new game. If the guy’s that much of a ninny, odds good that are the folks you actually \nwant to play with will come with you - \nand if you’re not going toe to toe with your pet \nschmuck, odds are you’ll have a little more time around the game. \nMore importantly, you have a responsibility to yourself to make yourself happy, and \neven the most avid player will - \nupon due reflection - \nagree that letting the rest of your \nlife atrophy for the sake of the game probably doesn’t cover that criterion too well. \nIn the end, it does come down to perspective. You have to help your friends achieve \na clearer perspective on what you’re doing and why it’s important to you. If they’re friends \nworth keeping, they’ll respect that, stick around and make an effort to get together around \nyour gaming schedule. By the same token, you owe it to yourself to re-examine your \nperspective on the whole thing, and make sure you’re happy with the role the game is playing \nin your life. Yes, it’s fun, and yes, it can happily suck up as much time as you want to give \nit. Just be sure you’re happy with how much time you’re giving it, and how much time you’re \ngiving everything else. \nIn the end, after all, it’s a game that you play - \nthat’s all. All in all, that’s a pretty \ndamned good thing for it to be. You’ll probably want to keep it from becoming anything \nmore. Your friends have no right to try to make it anything less. But in the meantime, that \nmiddle’s a heck of a place to be. \nAnd if not? There’s always room for one more at the bowling alley, if you can stand the \nshoes. \nI \n\n\nALL THE \nWORLD’S \nA STAC~E \nA ROUGH C ~ U I D E T O  ACTING \nI N M E T play \nby Matthew Hooper \nMatthew 1 Hooper has spent over two decades chasing a career in theater. \nHe graduated from the Catholic University of America with a theater major. He \ncame to Atlanta, GA to become a starving actorlwaiter, only realizing late in life \nthat, while acting is cool, starving sucks. While some of the roles he played were \nimmense fun - \nespecially the lead in Romeo and Juliet - \neventually he hung \nup his tights and rapier and went to work in the mundane world. These days, he \nwrites freelance material for White Wolf, contributing to the cjuide to the \nCamarilla and Storytellers guide. He still feels the need to treud the boards \noccasionally, though. \n“So, what’s this weird hobby of yours you do on the weekends?” Most \nMind’s Eye Theatre players have faced this awkward question from well- \nmeaning friends or relatives at some point. It’s never aneasy one to tackle. How \ndo you explain to your dear Aunt Edna that you pretend to be a werewolf on \nalternate Tuesdays without making her cough up her dentures and give your \nfolks embarrassed glances? Do you lie and tell her you like to take long, soulful \nwalks in the woods? After all, you can leave out the part where you bay at the \nmoon. Do you just dodge the question by complementing her on her new \ncrocheted sweater? \nA lot ofplayers settle for this half-truth: “I’m in an improvisational theater \ntroupe.” It sounds nice and profound. The conversation can move on again \nsafely. After all, theater is a respectable hobby. And while improv comedy isn’t \nShakespeare, Clive Anderson and his friends had a huge hit with that Whose \nLine is it Anyway? show of theirs. Theater is an ancient, noble art where you \ndress up and pretend to be someone else in front of an audience, while live- \naction games, why, they’re some scruffy hobby where.. er.. . you do the same \nthing without an audience. And with some games of Rock-Paper-Scissors \ntossed in to boot. \nHmm. Maybe that convenient explanation isn’t so far from the truth \nafter all. \nLive-action gaming is a form of theater, pure and simple. Mind you, there’s \nno audience at a LARP, but that doesn’t mean that you aren’t acting when you \nassume the role. Acting and live-action gaming are both about playing make \n\n\nbelieve. Acting focuses exclusively on taking that “make believe” as far as \npossible, while LARPers just settle for enjoying ourselves. \nSure, live-action roleplaying is just a game. So is chess. So is business. So \nis a love affair. So is art. A game is any activity with rules and a goal and a lot \nof joy involved with the process. Some of the best games - \nlike love or business \n- \nare deadly serious. Theater is as much a game as any LARP, in its own way. \nYou just don’t keep score the same way. \nTrust me. Ask any actor. They aren’t in it for the money. Why do you \nthink we’re called “starving artists”? \nActing in a LARP and acting on stage isn’t quite the same. You have to \nwork a lot harder on your concentration in a LARP than on stage. You have \nmore freedom - \nand more work - \nat a game than in front of the footlights. \nBut the raw pleasure of it all is the same. When you are In Character (in capital \nletters), you know it, and you never forget how good it feels. \nIt’s hard to explain what that feeling is like. It’s not a matter of “forgetting” \nyourself. You don’t suddenly develop Multiple Personality Disorder. You just \nfocus completely on the moment. Forget that you’re in a high school gym. \nForget that you’re speaking in sonnets. Forget that your tights itch. If you put \nall these things away and concentrate - \nreally concentrate - \non being \nsomeone else for an hour, it can be magic. You’re never going to “be” that \nperson, but you’re going to be more in tune with yourself by focusing on making \nthat role come to life. \nYou can feel it on stage all the time. At an MET game, it’s a lot more rare, \nbut those moments of clarity are present. The tests and the rules exist to make \nthose magic moments when the world comes alive happen. And with a little \npractice, those moments happen a lot more often. \nThis article is intended to help coach you through getting into character \nfor a LARP, using some basic theater techniques. You won’t be ready to star in \nthe Scottish play after reading these steps, but you will find it easier to enter \nand stay in character if you follow them. Before your next game, give them a \ntry and see what happens. With any luck, you’ll be able to find those In \nCharacter moments more easily, once you have an idea of how to get there. \nEocus: P U T T I N ~ T H E  \nDAY AWAY \nThe most important aspect of making a character is concentration. It’s all \nabout focus. You can’t convince anybody you’re an 18th century vampire if \nyou’re talking about the latest episode of Duwson’s Creek or catching up on the \nlatest gossip. Building a character takes work. If you’re not concentrating on \nthe job, it’ll slip away from you. \nBefore you start your next game, take a minute to walk away from the \ncrowd and get yourself ready. Take a few deep breaths. Think about all the \nthings you did today, the good and the bad. Take a moment to look at them. \nThen breathe out. Put those things away. For the next couple of hours, you \n\n\na few hours, right? So get serious about it. Set the day’s worries aside. Above \nall, take your time. Leave the stuff that’s outside the game, outside the game. \nThe biggest distraction any actor can face is stage fright. When you start \nto worry about what the audience thinks about you, your concentration is shot. \nIf you worry about what the other players think about you, you can’t focus. If \nyou can’t focus, you can’t do the job correctly. \nIf you’re afraid, you’re afraid. That’s fine. Focus on who you are and what \nyou’re doing. Ignore the spectators. Think about what you are doing right now. \nTake that fear, look at it a little bit, and then set it on the shelf with today’s \ntroubles. You’ve got something else to do for the next few hours. You’re too \nThere is no hurry here. Take as much time as you need to get ready. If the \ngame starts without you, fine. It’s always better to be late and be 100 percent \nthere, than to do a poor job. \nNow try something really scary: Stretch. That’s right, move around a bit. \nRoll your neck and stretch out your back. You’re going to be using your body \nas much as your brain for the next few hours. Acting is as much a physical \nexercise as a mental one. You need to have both in gear. \nTake one more deep breath for luck. Ready? Good. All right, pick up your \ncharacter and start finding a way into him. \nGETTINS STARTED: \nI N S I D E  \nA N D  OUTSIDE \nThere’s an old story in theater about how Dustin Hoffman and Sir \nLawrence Olivier prepared for their roles in the movie Marathon Man. Sir \nLawrence Olivier was playing a torturer, and Hoffman was his victim. \nHoffman really got into the role he was playing: He didn’t sleep for three \ndays before the shoot. He didn’t eat the day before. The day of the shoot, he \ndidn’t bathe. Finally, he showed up to the set, ready to go. \nSir LawrenceOlivierwaswaitingforhim. \nHestaredathis youngpartner and \nexclaimed, “Good Lord! You look terrible! What on earth happened to you?” \n‘‘I starved myself for the role,” Hoffman replied groggily. \nSir Lawrence stared at him a bit, and then replied crisply: “My dear boy. \nNext time try acting. It’s so much easier.” \nHoffman and Olivier both had very different techniques for getting into \ncharacter. Hoffman built on the “interior technique” of acting. He put himself \nthrough some really nasty experiences to learn what it felt like to be tortured. \nThen he took those personal experiences to his character. The end result was \na very realistic performance. (Maybe too realistic for those downwind of him.) \nA L L T H F  \nWORLD’S \nA STAGE \n\n\nSir Lawrence, on the other hand, used an older technique- \nthe “exterior \ntechnique.” He focused on how his character moved- how the tortured stood, \nhow he walked, how he stared at Hoffman. Then he listened to what those \nchanges in his body did to his voice and his heart, and he carried them through \nto the stage. The end result was just as good, and just as credible, as Hoffman’s. \nBoth techniques offer a window into getting inside a character. So which \ntechnique is best to use in Mind’s Eye Theatre? Both, of course. \n€ XTE R I  o R TECHNIQUE \nFirst and foremost, acting is an active process. Saying so sounds silly, but it’s \nanundeniable basicofthe art. You tell your audiencewho youarewith your body. \nYour posture defines your personality more than anything else about you. It \ndoesn’t matter how detailed your character background is. It doesn’t matter if you \ntell me that you’re a professional bodyguard who lived through the Punic Wars. \nIf I don’t see it in the way you walk, I don’t believe you, and nothing you say can \nconvince me. And if you can’t convince me, how can you convince yourself? \nActors often refer to their bodies as instruments. An actor “uses his \ninstrument” to convey a role to an audience. It sounds pretentious [or dirty, if \nyour mind works like that], but there’s a lot of truth there. Without an \nunderstanding of it, it doesn’t matter how much thought and research you put \ninto a role. If an audience doesn’t see your work, you’re as effective as a \ntrombonist who hums along to the orchestra. An entire philosophy of acting, \ncalled the Alexander Technique, is devoted to this idea of acting with your \nbody. We don’t have space for the thousands ofpages written about it, but here \nare some highlights. \nTry this on for size. Get up out of your chair and start walking. Don’t think \nabout walking, just walk like you were getting a coke from the fridge. Okay. \nNow speed up a little. Don’t run. Just pick up the pace. Concentrate, now. \nDon’t think about how silly you may look, just do it. \nWhile you’re walking, think about how you’re standing. When you walk \nthrough the door to the kitchen, what’s the first part of your body that passes \nthe doorframe? No, it’s not your feet - \nnot unless you’re taking giant steps. \nOdds are it’s your nose or your hips or your stomach. \nWhat happenswhen you leadwithyourchin?Don’tstickout Like youwere \ntaking a punch, just think about leading with your chin. Keep it small. Turn \naround. When you turn, what part of your body turns first? Try to move in such \na way that your chin is the first thing that moves when you decide to hang a \nleft into the kitchen. \nClench your jaw. Swing your arms. Clench your fists. Unclench them. \nSwing your head from side to side, like you were working a kink in your back out. \nStop. How do you feel? \nIf you said “Angry,” that’s good. You paid attention to what your body was \ntelling you. Congratulations. You just acted. \n\n\n.______-- \n \nA lot of times, you can slip right into a role just by concentrating on how \na character moves. Bodyguards, scholars and slaves all stand still in completely \ndifferent ways. If you pay attention to this aspect of your character, you’ll go \na long way toward getting into his shoes. \nBody language is absolutely crucial for the more animalistic roles in the \nWorld of Darkness, like those of the Garou. Do you want to play a lupus-breed \nwerewolf? Do yourself a favor. Plant yourself in front of the Discovery Channel. \nWatch wolves for an hour or two. A wolf moves in a certain way. He reacts in \na certain way. How do you take your two-legged body and make yourself move \nlike that wolf on the television screen? Try it and find out. Eventually, you’ll \nnever have to say, ‘‘I’m a lupus,” to other players. They’ll know before you can \nShow the other players what you are. One of the worst sins you can commit \nat a game is to raise your fingers and explain yourself. Don’t say, “You can see \nthatI’mreallybeatenup.”Don’tsay, \n“Youcansee that I’mfurious.”Show these \nthings! How does someone move when they’ve been beaten to a pulp? How do \nyou look at someone when you’re ready to chew nails and spit baling wire? Part \nof you probably knows. At some time in your life, you’ve been that bruised. \nYou’ve probably been that angry as well. Feel those feelings all over again, and \nlet your fellow gamers see it. The fewer times you have to step out of character, \nthe stronger your character will be. \nBefore you enter your next game, spend some time thinking about how \nyour character moves. How does he walk? Is he sneaky? Lead with your nose. \nIs he arrogant? Lead with your chin. Try as many things as you like. Don’t just \nthink about these mannerisms, try them. If you are sitting in a chair pondering \nall of this stuff, you’ve missed the point. \nCostuming helps a great deal in figuring out the body language of your \ncharacter. An evening gown forces you move in a certain way. So does a tuxedo \nor a pair of blue jeans or a doublet and hose. It’s hard to slouch in a tuxedo or \ngown. You have to keep your back straight. As a result, you look more formal. \nAnd if you look formal, you feel more formal. Incorporate those restrictions \ninto your character’s movement. Every small cue informs your character \nchoices; they all help you decide what does and doesn’t fit in your game play. \nNow that you’ve got your character up on its feet, it’s time to turn your \nbrain on and start thinking through your role. \nINTERIOR \nTECHNIQUE \nStart going over your character history at this point. Run it through your \nhead like a good movie or a slideshow. Pick three events from your character \nhistory that you consider important. \nTake a good look at those important moments. Play them back in your \nhead. Go into detail. What did you see? What did you hear? What did you \nsmell? What did you touch? Try and drag all five senses into the mix. \nA L L T H E  \nWORLD’S \nA S T A ~ E  \n\n\n‘Try and really immerse yourself into the moment, at least for now. \nNow start taking a peek into your character’s head. What was he feeling \nwhen these things happened? \nLet’s say that your character’s father was killed by the Sabbat. How would \nthat make your character feel? Angry? Sure. How about afraid? After all, your \nfather was far more powerful than you were once. How about disappointed? You \nalways thought your dad was stronger than this. How about happy? What did \nyour father do to you that would make you happy to see him dead? Hmmm.. . \nMaybe some answers are right. Maybe some aren’t. But ask every \nquestion you can, even the ones you think are wrong. Maybe you’ll be \nsurprised. People are capable of the most amazing things sometimes. Don’t \nsettle for the easy answers. \nAbove all, avoid saying no. Consider everything. Try everything. You owe \nit to yourself to look at every option. One of the greatest joys about this hobby \nis that you can be absolutely anyone or anything. You owe it to yourself to \nexplore every possibility, even the ones that you wouldn’t normally allow \nyourself to look at twice. \nNow that you’ve explored these emotions in your character, try and link \nthem to your own experiences in the world. It doesn’t matter if your character \nis a centuries old vampire or a bloodthirsty werewolf or whatever. You’ve had \nfeelings and experiences that are similar to that creature. If it was impossible \nto empathize with a character, he’d be boring. If you can imagine a character, \nyou can step into his shoes. It’s just a matter of trying. There are no such things \nas aliens in this world, only strangers. \nMaybe your parents haven’t been killed by anybody, but have you \nexperienced the feelings that your character felt when his father was killed? \nCan you remember what it was like to be afraid for you father? When were you \nangry with your father? Were you ever disappointed with your father? What did \nthose things feel like? Think of those moments. Think of your character \nhistory. Splice them together. Now you’ve really got material to work with. \nA lot of material has been written about this internal technique for acting. \nIt’s called the Stanislavsky Technique, and again, we don’t have a thousand \npages to discuss it. The material you’ve got here is a good start, however. Don’t \nbe afraid to take risks, to make choices, and to ask questions. There are no \nwrong answers here -only \nanswers that you’re afraid to try. Dare it. Try them. \nRemember, it’s only a game. The world of make believe is a wonderful place \nto explore your heart. As long as you keep the line between fantasy and reality \nstrong, you can find some amazing things. \nOne final note: Make sure that your character’s Nature and Demeanor \nagree with the choices you’ve made about the character so far. You’ll be using \nthose two little words as a touchstone for your character’s innermost desires as \nthe game goes on. Don’t be surprised if, after all this work, you find that the \ncharacter’s Nature is completely different from what you thought it was going \n\n\nto be. When you start on a creative process like this, it tends to develop a \ndirection all its own. Change it around until the Nature and Demeanor fit \nagain, and get ready to move on. \nTAKINC~ \nACTION: \nACTINC~ \nWITHINTHE \n~ A M E  \nSo, you feel like you’re getting into character. You’re ready to get into the \ngame. Good. Now the work really begins. \nActing applies to your body, and it applies to your mind. When you start \nplaying the game, you need to make an active choice about what you’re going \nto get done that night. \nWe make choices every day, most of which aren’t terribly important. We \ndecide what to have for lunch. We decide what to wear. Theater, and acting, \nis all about making choices too. Big choices. The bigger, the better. Hamlet \nisn’t deciding on lunch, he’s deciding whether he should kill himself or murder \nhis stepfather. The choices you make need to be active choices, things that \nother people can see and hear, so that they can react to your actions and make \nthe story happen. \nWhat does your character want tonight? Before you answer that question, \nkeep the following guideline in mind: Don’t answer in the passive tense. \nActing is an active process, remember? Your goal can’t be “stay alive.” That’s \nboring. Try the goal “kill anyone who tries to hurt me.” Or maybe even “run \naway from anyone who tries to hurt me.” As long as you have something for \nyour character to do, you’re in good shape. \nHow about the goal “become prince”? Try harder. Become is a pretty \npassive word. How about the goal “kill the old prince,” or “discredit the old \nprince”? Those active goals are much better. \nMake sure that your choice is informed by all the work that you’ve done \nso far. Don’t choose to kill the prince for the heck of it. Choose it if your \ncharacter wants it, for reasons all his own. And don’t be afraid to set impossible \ngoals for yourself. It’s the choice that is important here, not your success or \nfailure. Your goal, as a player, is to create the most interesting story you can \ntonight. Your character’s goal should be chosen with that fact firmly in mind. \nKeep the choices big. Don’t make your goal for the evening “get an ice \ncream cone.” That’s too easy. Once you get it, you’ll be stuck for something to \ndo for the rest of the evening. A good story involves a big decision. Big \ndecisions entail big risks. Never settle for second best. Don Quixote didn’t \nbecome a librarian or a writer, he set out to restore the lost age of chivalry. Be \nambitious in setting your goals. Even if your character fails in his quest, you \nwon’t have failed to tell an epic story. \nStuck? Try looking at your character’s Nature and Demeanor. Your \ncharacter wants something very specific from life. If his Nature is Bravo, he \n\n\nwants to scare people. If it’s Judge, he wants to find the truth. Your character’s \nDemeanor lets you know how the character gets the things his Nature \ndemands. If your Nature is Bravo, and your Demeanor is Critic, you may want \nto ruin someone’s self esteem by criticizing her at every turn. When all else fails, \nuse your Nature and Demeanor as the touchstones for your character’s desires. \nDon’t become obsessed with this one goal, however, unless your character \nis thusly deranged. Goals can change during the course of a game. You can want \ndifferent things. You can even want completely opposite things. After all, every \nvampire wants to let the Beast out, but at the same time, he wants to keep it in \ncheck. That internal conflict is a great way to bring depth and excitement to your \ncharacter. Be ready to go with major course changes when they happen. You can \nnever anticipate everything that can happen to a character. You can only react. \nWhat if your goal conflicts with another player’s goal? Good. That’s what \ngood roleplaying is all about. A conflict lies at the heart of all good theater. \nEvery single stagedproduction you can thinkof (fromNo Exit to Wrestlemania) \nhas a struggle of some kind in it. You get involved in LARPs to stage a \nproduction and tell a story, and conflict is what makes that story work. \nIf your goal conflicts with another player’s goal, try your damnedest to get \nyour way. You have every option in the book open to you - \nyou can beg, you \ncan whimper, you can threaten, you can bribe, and you can even kill. But don’t \nback down. At least, don’t back down until a more important goal comes across \nyour path. Most people try to suppress conflict in real life. They get along with \ntheir coworkers and their friends, so that we can all survive the day smoothly. \nYou aren’t required to play nice in the World of Darkness. Don’t be afraid to \nstop playing nice and go for the jugular. (Figuratively speaking, of course.) \nWhen you’re playing a supernatural creature like a vampire or a werewolf, \nyou have a lot of freedom. You can go to extremes that human beings can never \ndream of. The anger of a werewolf is legendary. The passions of a vampire dwarf \nregular emotions. When you play one of these characters, you have every right \nto jump in with both feet. Don’t hold back or make a halfhearted choice. Don’t \nlike something if you can love it. Don’t love it if you can obsess over it. And don’t \ndislike something. Hate it. Your choices need to be as bold and strong as possible. \nThe more you try for something, the stronger your character will be for it. \nThis last piece of advice comes with a very strong caveat, however: Don’t \nforget to respect the real world around you. Don’t bellow your inhuman fury \nat the top of your lungs if you’re in a banquet hall filled with people who aren’t \nplaying. If nothing else, remember that every supernatural wants to keep his \nor her nature hidden, for some very good reasons. \nMore to the point, however, you need to keep the flow of the game going. \nIf everyone has to step out of character to calm down irate hotel clerks and \nmothers, then all of that drama gets wasted. Theater only works when you have \nthe trust of your fellow actors. If the other players worry constantly that you’ll \ndisrupt the event and force everyone to break character, they’ll have a much \nharder time involving themselves in your work. \n\n\nAfter the game’s over, ask yourself this question: Did I achieve my goal! \nMore importantly, did I have a good time? Now think ahead to the next game. \nWhat will be your goal then? How about the game after that? How about over \nthe next year? Be ambitious, and be bold. There are no bad choices, only half- \nhearted ones. \nEINAL NOTES: \nCOVERINC~THE \nODD MOMENTS \nThere are a lot of oddities to acting in a LARP the demand some specific \nadvice. “Real” theater rarely goes into masscombat, after all. Here are some tips \nabout the little pitfalls your characters can fall into, and how to make the best \nrole-play possible out of them. \nCombat is inevitable in every LARP. If you’ve been serious about chasing \nyour goals thus far, it’s very likely that your character will end up throwing a \npunch at someone at some point. Remember to keep roleplaying your charac- \nter even as he’s fighting for his life. It’s hard to keep character in mind while \nyou’re juggling numbers in the back of your head, but keep focused. Above all, \nsell the combat with your words and with your body. Combat can be fun. It’s \nexciting imaging your character performing stunts that make Jet Li in Romeo \nMust Die look like Marlon Brando in The Freshman. Long sessions of Rock- \nPaper-Scissors, however, are not fun. Focus on the story, not the hand signals. \nDescribe what your character is doing as much as possible. Paint the scene for \nyour opponent and your audience. If you can mime out your character’s actions \n(without engaging in stunts ur touching other people), do so. Remember that the \nsafety of those around you is always more important than the game. Above all, \ntry to get out of turns and into real time as soon as possible. \nIn the course of a game, it’s very likely that you’ll have a character die. \nAccept this fact and keep going. It can be very painful to lose a character that \nyou’ve spent a lot of time and energy creating, but at the same time, there’s \nnothing more powerful to play - \neither on stage or in a LARP - \nthan a good, \njuicy death scene. If you have chased your goals as character with such \ndevotion that you can only choose between their success and your character’s \ndeath, you’ve done very well as an actor in live-action play. If your character \nchooses death at the final hour, you’ve built a story that will change the nature \nof your chronicle for years. Remember, the goal of this game isn’t to build a \nnice, safe character that lives to a ripe old age. If that were the case, we’d play \ncouch potatoes, not vampires werewolves. You’re here to tell the most exciting \nstory you can. Don’t be afraid to risk everything your character has for the sake \nof making the story sing. \nIn the same vain, don’t be afraid to let your character fail occasionally. \nFailure is a powerful motivator for change. Characters that change are always \nmore interesting to watch and play. Don’t avoid plotting treachery against the \n\n\nprince just because you know as a player that some obfuscated spy is watching \nyou. Let yourself fail. Have fun fighting with the consequences. Remember, \nyour job as a player is not necessarily to succeed in the goal you set for your \ncharacter. Rather, it’s to tell the most compelling story you can in the course \nof the night. Occasionally, that means letting the opposition win. It’ll make \nyour eventual comeback and victory that much sweeter. \nA number of powers in Mind’s Eye Theatre can force you to play your \ncharacter very differently from normal. Dominate, Dementation and blood \nbonds can alter your character’s deepest emotions in ways you’d never \nanticipate. Don’t fight these changes. Try to embrace them. Don’t be afraid to \nstep out of character for a minute or two to walk back through your process if \nyou need to. What does your character want now? How is he going to get it? \nRemember that now supernatural power can fundamentally change who your \ncharacter is. It is your choice as a player how any effect is portrayed. A blood \nbond might feel like the greatest love affair a character has ever known. It \nmight also feel like the most powerful drug addiction imaginable. Is your \ncharacter a lover or a junkie? The choice is ultimately yours. \nTrust your fellow players. They’re here to tell the best story they can \ntonight, just like you. If you cooperate, you’ll be much more successful. \nRemember that while characters might butt heads, players can always make \nthe conflict more interesting if they work in harmony. Sometimes you’re the \nhero in your own story. Sometimes you’re the supporting character in someone \nelse’s tale. Share the spotlight with good grace. \nFinally, remember the most important questions anyone can ask about \ntheater: “Who cares? So What?” Why should you bother being a vampire? \nWho cares about werewolves? Theater only works if it moves and changes its \naudience somehow. In a live-action game, you are your own audience. It’s very \nlegitimate to say that you’re doing all this work just to be entertained. In fact, \nthat should always be the first goal of any game. However, don’t be surprised \nif, after trying on all of these different goals and emotions, you find that you \nhave changed and moved yourself somehow. An actor’s only real reward for his \nwork is the applause of the audience at the end of the show. When the game’s \nover, put the character away. Applaud yourself. Take your bow. Think about \nwhat you’ve done this night. \nWho knows.. . Perhaps you’ll have found that playing a monster for a \nnight has taught you something new about being human. \n\n\nHFRFTICAL DHARMAS \nby Peter Woodworth \nGiven the fulfillment of our wishes, we’d cram every ounce of information \nwe could into each book White Wolf publishes. However, conservation of space \n(and trees) often forbids us from doing so. With the advent of the Journal, \nhowever, we can - \nus the buck cover proclaims -pick \nup where our other books \nleave off. In this article, we take a look at some of the more unusual schools of \nKuei-jin thought that didn’t make it into Laws of the East. \nThese relatively young Dharmas are rejected as heretical by the Quincunx, \nbut many of them are gaining support in the tumultuous days of the Fifth Age \nas younger vampires look to make their own mark on the world. Bear in mind \nthat such freedom from established doctrine comes with a high price as well. \nFinding teachers for these paths is seldom easy, and open followers of these paths \ncan expect cold welcomes (at best) when it comes to dealing with traditional \nelders. Being branded akuma for espousing such radically different beliefs is \nnever far away for Kuei-jin on these paths, and the brightest of them never forget \nthat this threat hangs over their heads constantly. \nExisting as they do outside traditional Kuei-jin astrology, Kuei-jin who \nfollow a heretical Dharma do not receive a lucky number for their Dharma if they \npurchase the Horoscope Background. Such is the price of following such an \nunorthodox route. \nT H E  \nE L A M E O E T H E  R I S I N C ~  \nPHOENIX \nVIRTUE: HUNAND \nY A N ~  \nNot all vampires believe that they are set down on the Road Back in order \nto forge a new identity for themselves. Some believe that their responsibility lies \nin finishing the tasks they failed to accomplish during their breathing days; to \nset right what so obviously wouldn’t let them rest the first time. The reasoning \nis sound enough to their minds. If life was so short on karma that the Kuei-jin \nhad to return to life once more, then doesn’t it make sense that their old lives \nshould be the focus of their renewed attentions? The abilities of the Kuei-jin are \nonly tools that they are meant to use in order to set their lives straight once more, \nand Phoenixes struggle hard to overcome their P’os and rejoin the world of their \nliving relatives. At first, many of them are surprisingly successful, acting as \nguardian angels over the ones they considered dear to them in life and settling \nold accounts left unpaid on their death. Even the most jaded elder harbors the \nkind of thoughts that drive this Dharma, of returning to his family home or \nvisiting his old love once more. This secret sympathy is perhaps the only reason \nthat this Dharma is merely scorned and not actively hunted. \nHowever, try as they might, the compassion and optimism of the Phoe- \nnixes inevitably fades as time goes by. Relatives die, times change, and \nsometimes the Kuei-jin herself is even responsible for some great family \n\n\n~~~~~ \n~ \n~ \ntragedy (usually committed during a period of shadow soul). Such events can \nunhinge even the most devoted members of this Dharma unless they possess \nabsolute devotion to their cause, and after a time most Phoenixes are far more \npragmatic than idealistic when it comes to restoring harmony to their old \nlives. Many also start looking for a bigger picture, tending to larger groups of \nmortals and sheltering them from the dark indulgences of other shen. They go \nfrom viewing their own lives as the key to their redemption to seeing all human \nlife as necessary to achieve enlightenment. Make no mistake, though. These \nKuei-jin are unholy terrors when they feel their protectorates are threatened. \nMore than one kyonshi has discovered that affinity for life and the higher soul \nby no means excludes warriors. \nThe strangest thing about this Dharma is that it has produced no known \nbodhisattvas. As soon as they reach a certain level of enlightenment, elder \nPhoenixes simply disappear into thin air, and even powerful divinations cannot \ndetermine their fate for certain. Naturally, the Quincunx and others are quick \nto use this fact as an example of how this Dharma must be fundamentally \nYlawed” in some way or another, and they step up persecution of this Dharma \naccordingly. Of course, the Phoenixes simply claim that it proves that their ways \nare correct. However, even they admit that the absence of bodhisattvas and \nother powerful elders makes their unlives more politically dangerous than those \nof other Kuei-jin. As for the missing elders themselves, perhaps the Sixth Age \nwill shed some light on their true fates.. . . \nTraining: Phoenixes typically “train” by spending as much time as they can \namong mortals, studying their interactions and learning what it takes both to \nheal them and stir their imaginations. Many take to the arts in some form or \nanother as a means of expressing their hopeful sentiments to mortals at large, and \nthere have been more than a few fairly reputable artists in the last century who \nwere actually counted among the members of this Dharma. \nDharmic Strength: Bonds of Living Harmony \nAll Phoenixes are exceptionally attuned to mortal emotions and manners. \nTheir players receive a free retest on all Empathy and Etiquette tests with mortals. \nAll Phoenixes also receive a free Compassionate Social Trait, which cannot be \nlost permanently as long as they remain on this Dharma. Most Phoenixes go to \ngreat lengths to avoid injuring mortals if it is at all possible in a given situation, \nalthough they receive no special benefits for doing so. \nDharmic Weakness: Tending Orchids \nPhoenixes are doomed to lose themselves among the teeming masses of \nhumanity, where the ravages of the Demon, the hunger and more eventually \ntake their toll on those the Kuei-jin cares about. As a result, most Phoenixes \nchoose one person in particular they wish to shelter from the ravages of their new \ncondition. They are extremely loyal guardians, but any harm to this chosen \nmortal brings down the terrible wrath of the Phoenix. All Phoenixes must take \nthe Flaw: Ward, representing a close friend or family member from their mortal \ndays whom they are especially dedicated to protecting. They are two Traits up \non any challenge to resist harming this individual, but their increased attention \ntoward one mortal inevitably draws the notice of enemies willing to use the ward \n\n\nTraits down on all Social Tests) until she has taken suitable revenge against the \none who dared to harm her chosen mortal. Should the ward die, another must \nbe chosen within a month. This cycle of pain and protection cannot end short \nof reaching dah. \nTENETS: \n1: Return to the world from which you came. \n2: Repay the debts of your human life. \n3: Help others to find the unique value of humanity. \n4: Fight the Demon and deny monstrosity. \n5: Live not with extremes or balance, but simply well. \n6: Wake the sleeper who shuns experience.

It should make \nsense, then, that some vampires are dedicated to finding the perfection at the \ncenter of such eternal reactions. Kuei-jin who follow the Tempest Dharma are \nmodels of diversity and singular function in one stroke; their wide interests \nmatched only by their hunger for knowledge. Whereas the Rootless Trees \napproach Balance as a matter of finding lessons by hopping from life to life, \nTempests prefer to sit in the well of the chaos that is creation and draw their \nexperiences from the storm swirling all around them. Other Kuei-jin have \ntrouble puzzling their ways through the mysterious facades of the Tempests, \nunable to reconcile how Tempests can take tea with demons one day and dance \nin the halls of Heaven the next. For the Tempests, however, such seeming \ncontradiction only underscores the foundation of their Dharma - \nthat enlight- \nenment exists in the void between two poles. \nLike the Rootless Trees who share their Dharmic Virtue, the Tempests are \ninvariably wanderers either in truth or in ideal, always pushing on to another \ngoal in hopes of rounding out their soul ever more completely. All things are \nworthy of study, say the Tempests, but only if one remembers that study to the \nexclusion of all else is to deny the magnificence of creation itself. This is not to \nsay that the Tempests lack focus; quite the contrary, in fact. When a Kuei-jin of \nthis Dharma expresses an interest in a subject, he spares little expense to track \n\n\ndown everything he can about it until he becomes a master in his field. Existence \nmay be a matter of moderation to the followers of Balance, but nothing said it \nhad to be moderation born of mediocrity! Indeed, many Tempests strive \nconstantly to raise their personal bars higher and higher, and a piece of \ninformation never leaves their hands once it passes their way. These Kuei-jin \nsimply strive not to overbalance themselves in one area or another. \nUltimately, the Tempests strive to find what lies in between mortal and \nvampire, spirit and matter, and this quest eventually leads them away from the \nmaterial, elemental aspects of Kuei-jin society and into deep contemplation of \nthe mysteries of the Kuei-jin soul. Many elder Tempests are masters of arts that \nallow for introspection and spiritual education, and they puzzle constantly about \nmatters both large and small concerning the undead condition and its relation \nto the universe around them. Their mastery of a multitude of subjects aside, these \nmasters claim to be searching for what lies beyond the gateway of enlighten- \nment. If the riddles and koans of this Dharma are correct, they surmise, the \nanswer can be nothing less than the universe itself, and so they seek to become \none with all things by denying any strong ties to a particular object or condition. \nTraining: Most Tempests fit nicely in the Western conception of a \n“Renaissance thinker.” They strive to master a wide variety of skills, from \nmundane labor to hidden occult lore to one more Kuei-jin Discipline. There- \nfore, their training is an eclectic affair designed to expose them to many different \nsubjects but immerse them innone, allowing them to choose their destiny freely. \nGreat measures are taken to balance the forces of Yin and Yang simmering \nbeneath the Kuei-jin’s skin, and while they take pains to study the Hun and its \ndevotion to duty, Tempests also probe and develop the Demon carefully. Some \nthink the Tempests are shallow, drinking deeply of nothing, but such modera- \ntion is what allows them to have the proper perspective between the clashing \nforces of the universe. \nDharmic Strength: Eye of the Storm \nExisting as they do in an unlife of moderation and temperance, the \nTempests are capable of remarkable feats of restraint when called for. Once per \nsession, the Tempest’s player may receive a free retest on any fire, wave or \nshadow soul Test, making the Tempest much less likely to fly off the handle than \ntheir more temperamental brethren. \nDharmic Weakness: Faintly Fading Winds \nParadoxical as it seems, excessive moderation can do as much harm to the \nsoul as overindulgence can, and the Tempests are prime examples of this \nprinciple in action. While their Dharma may espouse forbearance, many \nTempests become reactionary after a while, moving one step behind the world \nbecause they are too cautious to really embrace the chances that are given to \nthem. Because of their hesitant ways, all Tempests receive the Negative Trait: \nPredictabk, which cannot be bought off short of reaching dah. Furthermore, any \ntime the character feels he has overindulged in a particular activity, it ruins his \ncareful sense of balance. When such occasions come to pass, the Tempest is one \nTrait down on all challenges until such time as he has properly atoned for the \nindulgence with activities like long meditation or forbearance of material goods. \nThe Storyteller may enforce this penalty if the player does not. \n\n\nTENETS: \n1: Pull all things near and make them part of yourself. \n2: Balance the needs and desires on all poles, that they strive \n3: Never stray from the core of your nature. \n4: Realize the potential to learn from all people. \n5: Remember the lessons of the past.

The followers of the \nFace of the Gods Dharma are prime examples of the latter philosophy. These \nKuei-jin see themselves as souls who once attained godhood, but then fell to a \nlesser status once more due to some great error. According to the Divine Faces, \ntheir new state is proof that they were once something more than mere mortal; \nthat their death was just a transition state, and that it is their joss to reclaim the \ntitle of gods once more. After all, the Godlings reason, why else would they have \nbeen given another chance in a form so assuredly marked by signs of godhood, \nbut at the same time is riddled with so many temptations as well? This new life \nmust be a test of some kind, a training ground for the place in Heaven they are \nmeant to achieve - \nand woe to the poor being who stands in the way of a \nGodling along the road to the Celestial Ministry! \nThe unlives of these bizarre and eerily compelling Kuei-jin center around \nthe nature of godly contradictions. They meditate ceaselessly on how their \nnature stands - \nbarely glimpsed omniscience side by side with the darkest lusts \noutside of Yomi - \nand think of ways to combine and strengthen both sides \nwithout losing oneself to either total duty or the Demon. To their minds, the \nDivine Faces must search out the source of this conflict between insatiable evil \nand infinite compassion and overcome it if they wish to reclaim their godhood. \nThus, they must experiment with all manner of situations and ideals in the hopes \nof finding the right way to unite their disparate halves once more. Other Kuei- \njin are often fooled into thinking that the Godlings seek some sort of blissful \ntransformation of their undead state. Such nalve vampires change their minds \n\n\nquickly when the Divine Face decides to explore the nature of demonic fury. \nGodlings do their best to be the best in ways both wise and wicked, and they \nmake no secret of the fact that they will demonstrate either side of their \npersonality as they see fit, Demon or not! According to the sacred texts of the \nDivine Faces - \nthe Red Book of the Iron Bndge and The Celestial Nail - \nthe \nHeavens can be restored to their former glory only by the return of the gods who \nhave lost their way. The Godlings have no intention of disappointing. \nGiven the openness with which they hold their natures, it is unsurprising \nto discover that many Divine Faces have mortal cults flourishing around them, \nwhich the Faces administer with all the grace and horror that befits their divine \nstatus. (It takes a rare mortal to deny a god that walks among them bestowing \nfavors and influence in exchange for mere worship!) Not that most Godlings \ntruly care about their “parishioners.” Such mortals are a means to the end of \nreturning to Heaven once more, a font of Chi waiting to be tapped. Indeed, even \nin the relatively tolerant world of the Middle Kingdom, many Kuei-jin meet \nGodlings for the first time while carrying out a court mission to order the \nGodlings to stop demonstrating their powers in public. Of course, such actions \nare perfectly reasonable to their minds. When one aspires to godhood, after all, \nwho cares if the mortals catch a glimpse of your power along the way? \nTraining: The training of Divine Faces tends to be abrupt and to the point. \nAnother Godling finds the Kuei-jin and instructs him in the lessons of reincar- \nnation, divinity, deific values and the need to embrace both sin and virtue in \norder to reclaim the favor of Heaven and return once more. Many Godlings are \nalso taught the nuances of etiquette and courtly manners during this time. The \nKuei-j in must present themselves as nothing less than divine! \nDharmic Strength: Mantle of Godhood \nThe Godlings are nothing if not majestic, and they learn early on how to \nproject a formidable otherworldly aura to the lesser beings around them when \nnecessary. Sometimes this face is full of the Divine Radiance of Heaven; \nsometimes it is the Eyes of Hell. Either way, the results are bound to impress. The \nGodling may use each visage once per story. Divine Radiance requires a Yang \nTrait to activate, while the Eyes of Hell requires a Trait of Demon Chi. When \nDivine Radiance is active, the Kuei-jin receives the Traits Compassionate, \nCommanding and Magnetic for the remainder of the scene, as well as a free retest \non all Social Tests related to empathy and courtly grace. By contrast, the Eyes \nof Hell is treated the same as the Delirium (see the Demon Shintai Discipline in \nLaws of the East for details), sending mortals scurrying or cowering in terror \nbefore the anger of the Godling. \nDharmic Weakness: Vanity of the Lotus \nConvinced of their own perfection, Godlings can be absolutely insufferable \ncompany at times, particularly around those they consider to be “lesser beings” \n(i.e., everyone but them). Divine Faces receive a permanent Condescending \nNegative Trait, and they are one Trait down to resist fire soul when it’s directly \nsparked by the actions of a lesser being. The Godlings find it difficult to control \nthemselves when they discover that “mere mortals and other rabble” are still \ncapable of upsetting their carefully laid plans. \n\n\nTENETS: \n1: Develop your divine nature. \n2: Expand both godly and demonic consciousness. \n3: Accept the veneration of mortals, but answer their prayers in return. \n4: Harness Chi to bring divinity back to your dead form. \n5: Act according to the tenets of your Godly Voice, and your Godly \n6: Visit the Heavens to remember what you have lost. \n7: Practice ritual and tradition to empower your own essence. \n8: Commune with the spirits; learn of their messages from Heaven. \nDesire shall be fulfilled. \nConcepts: Priest, cultist, criminal, magician, psychologist, traditionalist, \nAffiliations: The heavenly realms, the color violet and the south direction \nAuspicious Omens and Symbols: Temple ceremonies, stands of burning \nQuote: “Perfection is my birthright, wisdom my key.

These Kuei-jin strive to bring \nbalance to the natural world and peace to the shades of the departed, though \ntypically more of the former than the latter, since the Bone Flowers are quite \njealous of their trade with the dead. Early in their new existence, the Kuei-jin come \nacross the staggering array of spirits in the world and recognize their wisdom, \nhumbling themselves before the mighty lords of the Mirror Lands and seeking to \nserve the Earth as best they can. While Kuei-jin of animistic backgrounds \nunderstand and respect the goals of the Cerulean Veils, many others consider them \neither harmless eccentrics or dangerous eco-terrorists, depending on the indi- \nvidual in question, but the truth lies somewhere in between. \nVeils move in a strange and beautiful world, keeping the taboos of the spirits \n(which helps to explain a lot of their peculiar reputation) while tending to the \nmundane concerns of the environment around them. Following such guidelines \nmeans appeasing the spirits, and appeasing the spirits means another bit of the \nworld will be explained for the vampire - \nno small payment in an existence \nfraught with open questions and seeming philosophical dead-ends! These Kuei- \njin keep only a nominal interest in the mortal world, considering it transitory \nand unimportant next to the energies of the earth itself. They typically interact \nwith modem society only in order to feed or when the spirits command them to \ndo so. Other Kuei-jin sometimes see these vampires as little more than slaves to \nthe whims of the Mirror Lands, but that concept is overly simplistic. Cerulean \nVeils follow the dictates of the spirits because that is what they feel is expected \n\n\nof them in their new unlives. To them, such obedience is no more absurd than \nexpecting a child to obey its parents. Even when they do enter into regular \nsociety, the Veils are often marked by a kind, otherworldly air. While they are \nmore than capable of defending themselves and the spirits they hold dear, most \nVeils typically have so little concern for the perils of the mortal world that they \nrefuse to arm themselves against it as others do. \nIn the dark days of the Fifth Age, however, more and more Veils are being \ncalled into the modem world to right wrongs done to their beloved spirits and even \nto defend the land against those who would defile it. As such, they are becoming \na more and more common sight in courts across the Middle Kingdom. Ancestors \ndebate the value of allowing these wise Kuei-jin into their courts to battle the \nYama Kings against the threat presented by the loyalty these Kuei-jin give to the \nspirit worlds over their fellow undead. For their part, the Veils seek only what they \nalways have: an Earth in balance and an unlife guided by the will of the spirits. \nTraining: These Kuei-jin place agreat deal of emphasis on ritual, ceremony \nand the observance of taboos. However, aside from some basic grounding on \ndifferent issues, each Veil is generally left to his own devices when it comes to \ninventing rites to use and learning the ways of the spirit worlds. This individu- \nality serves only to confuse other Kuei-jin further, since - \nwhile every Veil \nfollows an elaborate system of chants and rituals - \nno two members of this \nDharma do things quite the same way! \nDharmic Strength: Clasping Hands with Heaven \nAttuned as they are to the invisible world, Veils gain several potent benefits \nwhen it comes to dealing with spirits and the spirit worlds. First of all, Veils \nignore the first level ofNotoriety they may receive every story automatically, as \ntheir reputation with the spirits defuses what would normally be a hostile \nsituation. Veils are up two Traits on all Social Tests with spirits except demons \nand other creatures of Yomi. Finally, the Veils receive a free level of the Rites \nBackground due to their ritualistic upbringing. \nDharmic Weakness: Lost In the Mists \nAbsorbed as they are in the spirit worlds, Veils have trouble relating to \nmortals, and they are two Traits down on all Social Tests with mortals unless \nthey have known the person in question for at least one story. They even have \ntrouble dealing with others of their own kind, and they are one Trait down on \nall Social Tests with unfamiliar Kuei-jin. Finally, the special place these Kuei- \njin hold in the eyes of some spirits only marks them in the eyes of others. Yomi \nspirits always make it their special task to attack, harass and otherwise badger \nthese Kuei-jin above any others in the area. \n\n\nTENETS: \n1: Obey the will of the spirits. \n2: Perform the proper ceremonies to remain pure. \n3: Shun the defiled. \n4: Tread across the Earth to absorb its full glory. \n5: Pass wisdom to others freely. \n6: Help others to surpass the shortcomings of the flesh. \n7: Renew your thanks and commitment to enlightenment each day. \n8: Observe your taboos rigidly, that you may overcome your curse. \n~ ~ ~ _ _ _ _ _ _  \nConcepts: Wanderer, ritualist, competitor, fang shih \nAffiliations: The spirit realms, the color blue and west direction \nAuspicious Omens and Svmbols: Shrines and statuettes. tea ceremonies. \ntorii arches, sacred groves and ponds, parades \nshame that mortals have forgotten such a glorious heritage.” \nQuote: “Between Yin and Yang, Heaven and Earth, lies humanity.

Each night, before the Licks oozed \nout of Dallas and Fort Worth to buy his secrets, Uglyface studied himself in the \npond’s mirrored surface. There were many Nosferatu in this unattractive \nmetropolis; they all hated their reflections. \nThe Nosferatu looked over his shoulder. He didn’t want Iron Teeth \nMcGinty to walk up and witness his vanity. \nUglyface’s reflection smiled at him, and he smiled back. He saw the spots \non his face, mottled in such interesting patterns. And his reflection was trying \nto tell him something he couldn’t quite make out. Uglyface sounded out the \nwords with the ripples of the water. “You.. . must.. . taste.. . as.. . good as.. . as.. . \nyou look.” \nHe expected his reflection to spring out of the water and suck him down, \nbut his Final Death came at him from behind instead. Uglyface felt the blood \ndraining from his stomach. He looked down at the row of claws jutting from his \nbelly just below his heart. Wooden fingernails. Uglyface remembered what his \nsire had told him about wooden fingernails. \nHe saw teeth, then blackness. His mouth tasted like ash; then there was only \nbeauty. A vague darkness near oblivion; a beauty greater than his own. \nInformation Networks \nKing Roachman studied his appearance in the mirror. He centered his \nmonocle, sweeping the flakesofcrusty face-skinaway witha brush. His foot-long \nfingers knotted his tie, moving like spider legs. \nThe door to Roachman’s haven slammed shut as someone who was invisible \nbut now wasn’t entered. “Ready for a night of wining and dining with the undead \nof Dallas?” \nRoachman went back to his tie. “Hello, McGinty. Glad you’re coming with \nme. No one’s gonna try anything stupid with you there.” \n“I’ve got some juicy information to sell tonight anyway. Have you heard \nfrom Uglyface?” \n“Nope. Is he missing now too? Lots of us have turned up missing lately, \naccording to my sources. You think somebody’s offing Nosferatu? Maybe those \nhunter fellows I’ve been hearing about from my sources?” \n\n\n“I guess. Glad I stood him up last night. I was busy in my occult library \nreading up on the Wan Xian.” \nRoachman remembered the meeting because he had set it up himself. \nUglyface and McGinty were supposed to meet Hortense’s little crippled friend \ntonight after the Elysium meeting at the community center. A week prior - \nat \nthe previous Elysium meeting - \nthey were supposed to hammer out some lies \nto keep the cripple’s mistress off their backs. No big deal that the preliminary \nmeeting with Uglyface didn’t happen, though. \n“Go ahead and take the meeting with that wheelchair fellow and tell him \nthere’s a new BSD hive in Sherman,” Roachman said. ‘That should keep \nHortense jumping at shadows for a while. You know how she’s always trying to \nfight the designs of the Wyrm.” \nRoachman finished tying his tie, and he and Iron Teeth set out into the \ntunnels. McGinty protested that the king’s route would take forever, then \nsuggested taking the tunnel up to Grapevine then going southwest straight into \nthe city. Roachman didn’t want to use that tunnel because he didn’t want to \nwalk into Elysium with the shit of the cattle all over his shoes. Their route \ndecided, Roachman and McGinty crawled deep beneath the city, past Roachman’s \ntraps and ghouled albino alligators, deep into the earthen tunnels of the \nNosferatu of Dallas in nights long forgotten. \n‘(Who you think‘s offing us, Roachman?” \n“Not sure. This is a rough town to be Nosferatu. Everyone’s got a thing \nagainst us. What’s one Sewer Rat more or less? That mage up from New Orleans \nsays the Gauntlet was all fucked up at the pond. He thinks something hopped \nout of the Umbra and ate Uglyface.” \n“HOW’S \nhe know that?” \n“True Magic is beyond my grasp, the mage told me. He said the monster had \nan Old and Hungry Resonance, though.” \nRoachman squinted his tiny little eyes and peered left and right, not \nremembering which way to turn. McGinty sorted through all the creatures in the \nworld of darkness that they inhabited, trying to imagine what kind might have \nsuch a Resonance. \n“It’s not.. . one of them, is it?” \n“Oh no. It couldn’t be. Absolutely not. Well.. . maybe.” \nMcGinty and Roachman turned right, and after stooping through a series \nof warrens and mazes that even the King of the Sewers could hardly navigate, \nthey arrived in one of the storm drains beneath Plano. \n(‘Roachman, what are we going to do about this monster from the Umbra?” \n“Sell the information, I guess.” \nIron Teeth liked the sound of that. “Maybe we could use it to solve our \nHortense problem. Make sure she hears it from the rumor mill. Then, after you \nsell the same info to her little gimp friend tonight, she’ll think it’s solid. She’ll \nthrow a fit, then the prince will get fed up and stick her out in the sun for a few \nminutes, if you know what I mean. We teach her how to fish, then we watch her \nhang herself.” \n“Good thinking, McGinty.” \nQ F H B N N A  Wtxns A PunpLE Dncss TONIGHT \n\n\n“But if there really is something hopping out of the Umbra and eating \nNosferatu, it’ll wipe out the whole clan before the city handles the damage \nshe’ll cause in the meantime. You know the Brujah. They’re one-man- \nwrecking crews.” \nRoachman smiled. “You’re half right, McGinty. Hortense is a trouble \nmagnet. She’ll step in this big pile ofdog shit, then after she draws this thing out, \nour plans will come to fruition. \n“But first, we must make sure the rumor makes it to her. Hurry ahead and \ntake it to LSD.” \nImpotence and Ambition \nHortense of Clan Brujah came to Elysium to convince the Ventrue prince \nthat Dallas needed cleaning up, and that she was just the Lick to do it. She \nwarned him about the nascent Sabbat, she warned him about the encroaching \nwerewolves, she told him of the rumors she’d heard inNovember 1999 about the \nhunters whose auras shined like gold. Somewhere during her diatribe about \nNosferatu overcrowding in Dallas, she started screaming. \n“Those liars! The Nos are sewer-dwelling, shit-sucking liars! And I can \nprove it!” \nTheprince,forhispart,didhisbestto tuneherout. Justafewfeetaway, asmall \ncrowd listened to the Toreador primogen extemporize about some new form of \nfiction. “The whole enterprise is doomed,” the effete Toreador droned, “because \nit uses a comedic structure to tell a tragic tale.” The prince couldn’t keep up with \nthe conversation because of the crackpot Brujah shouting in his ear. \n‘This is all very interesting, Hortense, but I still don’t see why you should \nbe sheriff.” \n“I’m a Brujah.” \n“We’ve already got a Gangrel sheriff. He’s loyal even though his clan \n“He’s a dove. You need a Brujah hawk.” \n“No I don’t.” \n“I’ve got Fortitude and Protean that I learned in the Sabbat before I \nreformed and moved to Dallas. I’m ideally suited.” \nThe prince did some math in his head and determined that having spent so \nmuch time learning Disciplines, Hortense could not possibly have directed her \nexperience into learning how to use those Disciplines effectively, considering \nhow old she was. \n“I don’t think that’s a good idea, Hortense. Sometimes a sheriffs got to be \na diplomat instead of a cop. I’m not sure you possess the vision necessary to \nenforce our Traditions.” \nHortense rolled her eyes. “Fuck all that. The only way to keep us safe is to \nkill anyone who threatens the Masquerade. You might as well name me sheriff \nbecause that’s already what I do. Without me and my ally, Stumpy, this whole \ntown would’ve met its Final Death long ago.” \nThe prince pretended to notice something across the room and started \nwalking away. “Oh look. I think that’s Ludovici waving to you. Go see what he \nwants, and I’ll be content to consider what you’ve told me tonight.” \nabandoned us.” \n\n\nHortense looked over at Ludo. The Malkavian wasn’t waving to her at all, \nbut staring at some stranger in a purple dress. Hortense put aside her clan’s long- \nstanding hatred for all Malkavians and approached her demented friend. \nDialogue Is Not Action \nSomewhere amid the swirls of the auras and tracers left by the drama of \n“Ludo ?” \nLudovici continued looking at the strange Kindred in the purple dress. \nHortense’s aura was a deep purple, just like the stranger’s dress. Ludovici’s \nirredeemable madness suggested that there must be some connection. The \nstranger seemed oddly familiar with the prince as well, although she had never \nmet the Ventrue before tonight. \nElysium, Ludovici Sinistrati D’Ameno tasted a familiar voice. \n“L&! \n” \nHortense was talking to him. How best to explain what he was doing? In his \nmadness, he heard her staring at him. He remembered that he had something to \ntell her. \n“Ludo? What the fuck are you doing?” \nLudovici fled his perceptions and returned his sight to the Realm of \nWaking. He smiled at Hortense as ifhe had just noticed her. Her glare scared the \nlook from his face. He looked down at his shoes and mumbled. \n“I’m a weird cat,” he said. “I try not to romanticize it.” \n“Are you swimming in auras again?” \n“Yeah. I saw a good one, but it confused me.” \nThe Malkavian could tell Hortense was pissed off about something. That \nwas always a safe assumption with her, considering how hot-blooded her clan \nwas. She glowered about the room, edging closer to him. \n“The prince is trying to fire me again,” she whispered. \n“There’s no time for that now. I’ve heard something. Something big.” \nLudovici was disappointed that this provocative statement hadn’t cheered \nher up. Still, he told her about his conversation with Iron Teeth McGinty. Just \nafter sundown, they’d both arrived at Elysium. In exchange for a small boon, he \ntold her, McGinty had told him about the disappearance of several Nosferatu. \nSomething from the Umbra was up to no good. Again. \n“The End Times are here, just like it says in the Book of Nod, Ludo,” \nHortense said. “This thing from the Umbra, this thing killing Nosferatu, is \nclearly one of the Nictuku.” \n‘‘I think that’s a pretty crazy theory, Hortense.” \n“Good God, man, it’s the only one that makes sense! That clan is complicit \nin its own destruction.” \nLudo allowed his perceptions to catch up to him, and he swam back into \nthe auras. Somehow, it was no defense against Hortense’s designs. She was \nsucking him in like she did every time. Why did she have to have such an \ninteresting aura? \n“Here’s what we do, Ludo: We kidnap Iron Teeth McGinty and feed him \nto the Nictuku. That shows it we’re serious. Then we help it round up the rest \nof the Nosferatu. When it’s sated - \ntaking care of the Nosferatu overpopula- \nC ~ E H E N N A  WEARS \nA PURPLE \nDRESS \nTONIGHT \n\n\ntion - \nthe Nictuku will leave. The prince will have to acknowledge my \ntalents then.” \nT h a t  sounds like a nice plan, Hortense. But how can we be sure the Umbral \nmonster is a Nictuku?” \nHortense reached into her purse and grabbed her cell phone. “I’ll call \nStumpy and tell him to ask Iron Teeth McGinty when he meets him tonight. \nMaybe the Sewer Rat will have learned something new by then. And after he \nfinds out what we need to know, Stumpy’ll bring McGinty in.” \nThe Lines Cross \nHortense and Ludovici left Elysium and walked through downtown Dallas. \nWith a few hours to kill while Stumpy acquired McGinty, they decided to get \nfucked up on some changeling blood down at the May Molloch. \n“You know,” Ludovici said, “among his kind, Stumpy is called a ‘metis.”’ \n“Yeah, I know. I knew it when I first saw him.” \n“No, I said metis -you \ncan’t possibly know what a metis is. I learned of it \n“I learned many strange things during the time I spent fighting the Wyrm \nLudovici couldn’t argue with that. He changed the subject. \n“So what’s this place we’re going to?’’ \n“The May Molloch. The changelings meet there once a week for some kind \nof court. Strangely, it occurs on the same day as our Elysium. I know you dig auras, \nand you’ll see some tripped-out auras on fae blood.” \nLudovici hugged his coat around him and walked faster. He walked with \nHortense between him and the street. \nthrough the Malkavian Madness Network over the last month.” \nalongside the Garou, Ludo.” \n0.. \nStumpy wrapped his jaws around his chair’s joystick and steered down the \npath that led to the frog pond. He took it slow, making patient turns andcoasting \ndown hills. The motor didn’t make much noise at such slow speeds. Although \nthe metis could see in pitchdarkness, he knew the path by heart. He’dcome here \nwith Hortense a hundred times. And aside from Hortense, he’d dealt with \nMcGinty more than any other Lick in town. \nHe found McGinty waiting for him. Always the same place, always on time. \n“We know about the thing from the Umbra that’s eating Nosferatu,” \n“Both your master and her insane friend owe me boons for this, you know.” \n“Agreed. They’ll owe you. Is it Nictuku?” \n‘‘Our Nosferatu sources think so. You know I’ll expect- Aieeeeee!” \nIron Teeth McGinty’s head burst into flame. He screamed as his flailing \nhands slapped at his face. Stumpy felt the elements lingering in the air, waiting \nfor him to realize them. He reached out to Gaia. McGinty’s eyeballs exploded \nfrom his head. The vampire collapsed to the ground. \nWith a whip of his back, Stumpy fell from his wheelchair and inched \nhimself over to the collapsed vampire. Stumpy thought about his missing feet, \nand his missing hands. The thoughts fueled his rage, and he changed form \nStumpy said. “We just want to know this: Is it Nictuku?” \n\n\ninstantaneously. He snarled and went for the vampire’s throat. Somewhere in \nthe back of his mind, Stumpy heard his ancestors beating war drums. \nThe metis felt the flames on his lips. He leaped up with a yelp and swayed \nback and forth trying to find a balance on his feetless legs. Stumpy fell to the \nground. He called upon Gaia again for water to extinguish the flames. McGinty’s \nteeth faded from hot orange to dull gray as the evaporating water hissed away \ninto vapor. \n‘‘I want to tell you a story, while you’re in a condition to appreciate it: There \nused to be this pack of Garou. Two of them loved each other very much. From \ntheir forbidden passions came a child. But the kid was fucked up, see. Twisted \nand deformed; I mean his soul as well as his body. The kid had some weird \nappetites - \nsomething I’m sure you can understand with those crazy teeth of \nyours. But the pack must have figured that Gaia needs all the help She can get, \nbecause they tolerated that hungry little shit for years. Until he was old enough \nto join his pack in the fight against the Damned, that is - \nhe had a bad habit \nof eating his vanquished foes. \n“The packdidn’t like the whole vampire-eating thing. His pack took him into \nthe city then cut off his hands and feet. But they couldn’t just leave him for dead. \nThey entrusted him to a bad luck princess they’d fought alongside for years, but \ntold her to never return to Garou lands. She’s helped the kid get back on his feet.” \nMcGinty lifted his eyeless face from the dirt. He tried to laugh. “Must.. . \nbe.. . figurative.. .” \n“Real funny, Sewer Rat! But I didn’t tell you end of my story. Remember \nhow I said the kid used to eat vampires? His favorite was Nosferatu.” \nStumpy snapped his jaws over McGinty’s ear. He ripped the cooked meat \noff McGinty’s face. The metis rolled on his back, chewing the Nosferatu’s flesh. \nMcGinty screamed. Blood streamed from his eye sockets, and horror washed \nover him. \nStumpy swallowed the last bits of McGinty’s nose. “Don’t fuck with me, \nLeech. 1’11 light you up every time. Now get up off your ass and help me back into \nmy chair.” \nDistractions \n“Ludo? I’m trippin’ balls.” \n“Me too.” \n“What are you thinking about?” \n“About drinking another faerie.” \n‘This one’s scared. I can see his aura. \nHortense and Ludovici gazed up at the stars, nestled in the trash bags \npiled behind the May Molloch. The changeling boy squirmed between \nthem. If it seemed like he was about to worm away, they grabbed his wrists \nand bared their fangs. \n‘They killed J.F.K. here, Hortense.” \n“I remember. I was there in brighter days.” \nHortense and Ludovici had gone on something of a binge, draining about \na third of the faerie court in the last 30 minutes. The blood did strange things \nto their dead brains. \n9 E H E N N A  W E A R S  A P U R P L E  Dnsss T O N I ~ H T  \ne \n\n\n“I can see your aura, Ludo. You’re fucked up, dude.” \nHortense heard their van pulling up. It arrived with that familiar hiss of its \nloose power-steering belt. She heard the backdoor slide open and the hydraulic \nlift lowering Stumpy’s chair to the ground. The sound of his wheels came closer \nto them. Ludovici looked up at the sound and threw a few trash bags over their \nchangeling captive, his paranoia overwhelming the half-hearted Arcadian \nprotest. Stumpy rolled up on the pile of trash. \n“You didn’t tell me you’d be out back,” he said. \n“Did you get ... that big-teeth guy I sent you to get?” \n“Yeah, Hortense. He’s waiting in the van. He ain’t got no face.” \n“Did he say the Umbral monster was a Nictuku like I thought?” \n“Definitely.” \nThe world reoriented itself as Hortense sat up. She picked moldy cheese \nfrom her hair and looked over at her metis companion. “NOW all we need to do \nis find the Iron Teeth McGinty and take Nictuku to it.” \nThe changeling boy struggled again. Ludovici socked him in the face with \na brutal chop to calm him down. “I think I know where the beast lurks,” he \nwhispered. “NOW that I am completely out of my head, the language of the auras \nis apparent to me. I think I’ve already seen the creature tonight, but we must \nmake sure.” Ludo pulled himself out of the pile and brushed himself off. “But I’m \nnot sure that Elysium is the safest place for this betrayal. This Nictuku is no doubt \nvery dangerous.” \nBut Hortense was already walking to the van. “NO more dangerous than the \nthree BSDs I killed when I was in Montreal last year. Let’s go.” \nLudovici realized that, for tonight at least, Hortense was his clanmate. He \nvolunteered to drive. \nPopulation Control \nElysium had peaked by the time Hortense and Ludovici showed up. The \ncurrent scene was strictly post-mortem. The proclamation of the prince that \nthere would be no more Embraces in Dallas for the next 50 years hadn’t gone \nover well with the assembled Licks. Most of them had left in a huff, and the few \nwho remained stood around seeing who could prophecy the most utter doom. \nThe Toreador primogen, though, was still there, deep into the discussion he had \nbegun earlier that evening. His audience stood and snored. Stumpy, and the \ndisoriented fae boy in his lap, rolled past the keeper of Elysium, who figured it \nwas too late in the evening to start kickingout Lupines and changelings. Instead, \nhe invited them to join him at the bar. \nLudovici placed his hand on Hortense’s shoulder to steady himself as he \nprepared to surrender to his perceptions. With an explosion of color, the \nemotions and secret thoughts that lingered in the room revealed themselves to \nthe Malkavian. He looked at the young stranger who sat at the right hand of the \nprince whispering things unheard by Kindred ears. \n“It is just as I suspected,” Ludovici gasped. “Gehenna wears a purple dress \ntonight.” \n“I know. I see it too.” \n\n\nWith the fae blood in their systems, Hortense and Ludovici saw the thing \nfor what it really was. It was not some new childe, some anonymous traveler, but \nan old and hungry evil, a curse inflicted by an Antediluvian on his childer. Her \naura was a constantly exploding purple, a purple deeper than even Hortense \ncould transmit, a purple that summed all the murderessness of the vampiric \ncondition. Hortense and Ludovici felt the Curse of Caine heavy upon them. \nHortense looked at Ludo. The disgruntled frown was gone. “It’s time, \nLudo.” Was she nervous, perhaps? “Everything depends on this moment.” \nThe pair approached the Nictuku. \nThe woman in purple exuded the most charming presence even when \nperceived in the normal spectrum. She curtsied to each of them and made small \ntalk about Dallas and how she was looking forward to making her haven here. \nAs she talked, Ludovici watched Hortense growing increasingly skittish. Fi- \nnally, the tension exploded. \n“Look, you can cut the bullshit! We know you’re a Nictuku. We figured it \nall out.” \n“But we don’t fear you!” Ludovici added, just in time to keep the prince from \ncalling a Blood Hunt on the monster in his Elysium. “In fact, we’ve brought you \none of your clan’s errant childer. We’ll deliver the rest of them as soon as we can.” \nThe woman didn’t seem to appreciate their generous offer. “I don’t know \nwhat you’re talking about, I’m not a - \nwhat did you say again? - \nNictuku?” At \nthe sound of the word, a few vampires turned to listen to the conversation. Even \nthe Toreador primogen ceased in his ramblings. Roachman slipped quietly into \nthe shadows with a look of terror and fear. \nHortense leaned in and whispered to the ancient beast. “If I were aNictuku, \nI believe I’d do almost anything to take a bite out of Iron Teeth McGinty.” \nThe thing’s eyes narrowed as a smile crossed her face. \n“Yes,” it said. “Did you know he actually has iron teeth? A descendant of \nLudovici backed away from the Nictuku. “Time to leave, Hortense. Are you \n“No way. We’re so close, Ludo. Don’t crap out of me now!” \nThe woman in purple ripped off Hortense’s arm and stuffed it into her \ngrowing mouth. The halls of Elysium echoed with screams. Hortense stood \nthere, disbelief in her eyes. “This isn’t supposed to be the way it happens! I \nthought you ate Nosferatu!” \n“I do. And Brujah, and Malkavians, and on down the line. Each has its own \nflavor.” The Nictuku licked her lips, which were already swelling into turgid \nscars as the svelte young vampire melted away to reveal the creature’s immense \ntrue form. “The only thing I like more than vitae is fae blood. And Garou blood.” \nThere was a quiet whimper from Stumpy’s direction, and a yellow pool \ncollected under his chair. He put aside his species’ ancient hatred of all vampires \n-he \nand the Leeches had a common enemy now! \nBaba Yaga perhaps. He must be delicious.” \nstill looking at her aura?” \nThe Inevitable Showdown \nThe Nictuku ripped through Elysium, tearing apart the Kindred in her \nwake. A legless neonate tried to drag himself to safety until the Nictuku planted \nC ~ E H E N N A  \nWEARS \nA PURPLE \nDRESS T O N I ~ H T  \n\n\nits massive foot in his back. The Toreador Primogen had lost his eyes and was \nclutching at his skull. Nothing beautiful transfixed him now. Only horror. A \nbroken wooden fingernail in the heart of the prince held him immobile. For \nsome reason, theNictukudidnot destroy him outright asshe hadso many others. \nHortense and Ludovici huddled behind an overturned banquet table. \nHortense grasped her bleeding shoulder while Ludo stared at the aura light show. \n“The whole room is purple now, Hortense.” \n‘Who fucking cares! We’re gonna die!” \n“We’re not going to die. I have an idea, but I am much too preoccupied right \nnow to vocalize it.” He felt Hortense screaming something about how he should \nsnap out of it. \n“I’m trying to be patient. We must wait for the prerequisite conditions to \nrealize themselves.” The Nictuku fell upon the changeling and gulped him \ndown. The creature’s purple aura wavered then threatened to black out the room \nwhile the changeling’s aura floated away into the ether. \n“Now!” Ludo leaped over the table and made his way through the door \nwhile the beast oriented itself to its new outlook on reality. \nAt kast Stumpy won’t abandon me, Hortense thought as the Nictuku picked \nup Stumpy’s chair and hurled the shrieking metis across the room. The chair \nbent when it landed, trapping Stumpy underneath. \nHortense huddled behind the table, unable to formulate a coherent escape \nwith the fae blood swishing around in her head. She briefly considered making \npeace with her maker but quickly decided it was important to remain stand- \noffish at the end. Her hot-blooded Brujah heritage would permit nothing less. \nShe presumed that no miracles would be forthcoming on her behalf. \nAll hope seemed lost, but suddenly, Iron Teeth McGinty burst into the \nroom. His bums had disappeared and most of his face had grown back. He now \nhad a healthy complexion for a man with mottled green skin. Ludovici stumbled \nin after him, grasping at the door frame trying desperately to remain upright. He \ncrawled across the room to rejoin Hortense as the Nictuku wheeled around and \nfaced her new opponent. \n“McGinty!” the Nictuku screamed. \n“Absimiliard’s Concubine!” McGinty shouted back. “The Mistress with \nWooden Claws! I haven’t seen you this side of the Gauntlet since you killed my \nsire. His old occult books told me how to finally defeat you!” \nMcGinty lunged at the Nictuku and buried his iron fangs deep into her \nskull. Where the iron contacted the changeling blood in the beast’s system, a \nstrange spectral feedback began. The Nictuku’s aura became a negative of itself \nand started shrinking. The aura around McGinty seemed to vibrate, speeding up \nto some grand explosion. Then the beast bit his head off and spit out 12 iron \nspikes. They left colorful trails in the air as they fell. \nLudovici leaned over and whispered to Hortense. “That was fucking cool.” \nThe Nictuku staggered about the room, holding the spot McGinty had \nbitten into. She howled in pain then ripped the Tremere primogen in two. No \none in the room seemed to mind. \n“Nice tactic, the iron and changeling blood,” Hortense said. “But it looks \nlike she’s still going strong.” \n\n\n“One again, Hortense, you underestimate your enemies. Her aura is \ndiminishing, and thus her power. Now in comes the cavalry.” \nAs if on cue, the remaining strength of the Dallas Nosferatu coalesced out \nof the shadows. Each held a broadsword reinforced to withstand the rigors of \ntheir advanced levels of Potence, and they all wore chain-mail vests beneath \ntheir clothing. The King of the Sewer led the creeping deployment, admonish- \ning the Nictuku in a language Hortense didn’t understand. Then, only for a \nmoment, a silence held the floor. The Nictuku roared, and the Nosferatu waded \nin to destroy her. \nTransferable Characters \nHortense saw herself in the rear-view mirror, applying her makeup with her \nremaining hand while Stumpy desperately gripped the steering wheel of the van \nwith his forearms. “The whole Nictuku thing ruined my buzz,” she said to \nLudovici, who sat in the back seat holding his head. They heard a scream from \nsomewhere inside the community center. \n“Hurry it up, Stumpy. The police are going to be here soon to investigate \nthis disturbance.” \n“I’m far too mad for the police to catch,” Ludovici said. “But I’m worried \nabout whoever wins that brawl in there. I’d like to be someplace else. Like \nMinnesota, maybe.” \nStumpy whined and floored the pedal. The van merged onto 1-35 North as \nthe vampires crawled under their seats to sleep the day away. Stumpy rolled \ndown the window and licked his lips. He wondered what the Nosferatu tasted \nlike in Minnesota. \n9 E H B N N A  W E A R S  A P U R P L E  DRESS \nT O N I ~ H T  \ne \n\n\nby Carl Bowen \nWHATARETHE \nEOMORI. \nFomori are the product of the fusion of a human and a spirit in service to the \nWyrm. For a myriad of reasons and through a wide variety of means, an otherwise \nnormal man or woman devotes him- or herself to the ideals of corruption and \ndestruction that motivate all other servants of the Wyrm. \nIt is a common misconception that Pentex, a corrupt organization wholly \nin thrall to the Wyrm, creates and directs all fomori. Not to understate matters, \nPentex does indeed go to great lengths to recruit new fomori and keep them busy \ndoing the company’s dirty work. Pentex scientists also keep themselves busy \nfinding new ways to facilitate the creation offomori among the populace at large. \nHowever, the company did not create the process by which Bane spirits bond \nwith human souls. All human beings have qualities attractive to the Wyrm’s evil \nBanes, be they weak spots in our moral fiber or antisocial tendencies we only \nbarely manage to keep in check. Once a Bane detects the avenue through which \nit may exploit this potential in a prospective human host, it needs no coaching \nto travel that road on its own. \nTYPES \nO E  BANES \nThese listed spirits are not the only ones that serve the Wyrm, but they are \nthe spirits best able to possess humans. Most fomori are the product of joining \none of the following Banes with a human subject. The possession is not \ninstantaneous, however, so a Garou warrior with a mind to prevent the \nconjunction could travel into the Umbra to do battle with the spirit before the \nfomor is born. Keep in mind, though, that most fomori are not necessarily the \nproduct of joining these Banes with willing human subjects. A Bane with a \npowerful enough command of the Possession Charm can latch on to the soul of \na victim regardless of the victim’s resistance. The fight for dominance may take \nsome Banes longer than others, but enough struggle will overcome any obstacle \nBLOOD BANES \nBlood Banes are the farmers of the crop of filthy, festering cesspits that the \nmodem age is heir to. These Banes frequent toxic dumps, blights and other \nequally repulsive sites in hopes of acquiring disease. They then seek out victims \nto infect with the diseases they pick up. When a Blood Bane has transferred a \ndisease successfully- much as a bee would pollinate a flower - \nit feeds on both \nthe disease and the concomitant suffering to which the disease gives birth. \nRage 6, Gnosis 5, Willpower 6, Power 20 \nCharms: Airt Sense, Possession \nThese Banes are responsible for the existence of the Ferectoi breed offomor. \nThe Banes appear from the Umbra to extract the semen or fertilized egg of a \nBREEDER \nBANES \n\n\nsleeping human victim. They then retreat back across the Gauntlet. Most \nBreeder Banes use the Charm: Breeding Trance to erase all memory of the rape \nfrom their victims’ minds. The Charm replaces the memory with one of a \ndisturbingly violent erotic dream, provided it works. The most fortunate victims \nof these Banes suffer minor brain damage and lose all memory of the events that \ntookplace that night. The least fortunate victims remember both the dream and \nthe nocturnal visitation itself. \nRage 5, Gnosis 6, Willpower 5, Power 25 \nCharms: Airt Sense, Breeding Trance, Materialize \nLacking almost entirely in form, these Banes are difficult foes to overcome. \nWorse yet, they do not attack the body or corrupt the land. Instead, Howling \nInsanities lie in wait for prey, then shriek and howl mindlessly. The sounds buffet \nthe minds of those who hear them, stripping the victims of their sanity. The \nBanes then feed on the madness they create. These Banes were among those who \nbrought about the downfall of the White Howler tribe. \nRage 7, Gnosis 6, Willpower 7, Power 20 \nCharms: Airt Sense, Corruption, Possession \nMind Feeders have existed as long as the human mind has existed, leading \nsome to wonder if humanity somehow created them long ago. Further specula- \ntion suggests that these Banes’ manipulation gave rise to the first human \npsychics. Putting speculation aside, however, some facts about these three-eyed \nmonstrosities cannot be ignored. For some reason, the Pentex Corporation has \nbeen enjoying greater cooperation with Mind Feeder Banes as part of a project \nto create anew, psychic breed of fomor. Tests have shown that these Banes bond \nbest and become most powerful when they bond with human psychics. Other- \nwise, they bond with the most intelligent non-psychics they can find. \nH O W L I N C ~  \nINSANITIES \nM I N D  FEEDERS \nRage 4, Gnosis 5 ,  Willpower 8, Power 20 \nCharms: Airt Sense, Corruption, Possession \nA single Bane creates a Scavenger Pack by possessing a host of small animals \nthen seeking out a larger animal inside which to make a true home. The most \ncommon example of this phenomenon is that of a Bane possessing a horde of rats. \nThe rats then seek out a dead or dying human body and force their way inside, \nhollowing out as much space for themselves as they can. The resultant bulging, \nshambling mass becomes a fomor known as a Hollow Man. \nWhile possessing the host of smaller animals, the Bane’s consciousness \nextends to all of the individual members while remaining anchored in only one. \nIf that particular anchor animal is destroyed, the Bane is forced back into the \nUmbra where it must start its search anew. \nSCAVENC~BR \nPACK \nRage 4, Gnosis 6, Willpower 4, Power 20 \nCharms: Airt Sense, Healing, Materialize, Possession, Prolonged Dying \n\n\nTYPES \nO E  EOMORI \nBRAIN EATERS \nDespite the schlocky sound of their name, the Brain Eaters are some of the \nmost subtle, insidious Fomori ever created. As part of a far-reaching initiative \nto corrupt those fortunate few humans born with psychic powers, a division of \nthe Pentex corporation binds a Bane known as a Mind Feeder to the brain of a \nlatent human psychic. The torture and anguish the psychic suffers as a result of \nthe operation awakens his power, but at a terrible cost. While it makes the \npsychic more powerful than he would have become on his own, the Mind Feeder \nBane creates in the new fomor the urge to consume living human brains. Should \nthe psychic deny himself this urge for longer than a week, his powers atrophy, \nand his very body begins to wither and decay. The addiction is so strong, \nhowever, that most Brain Eaters indulge more than once a week after they have \nindulged the first time. \nIn return for dining on this gruesome delicacy, the fomor develops the \npower to make people hallucinate, he no longer needs fear the Delirium, and he \ncan read people’s minds with ease. Worse yet, the fomor retains any psychic \npowers he may have had before being bound to his Bane. To top off all else, the \nbinding operation causes no noticeable physical change in the fomor, allowing \nhim to blend in with the rest of human society without so much as a ripple. \nENTICERS \nEnticers exist to bring out and exploit the worst, most base instinctual \nbehavior in human beings. They live and breathe such raw, powerful sexual \nmagnetism that only the most saintly and reserved victims can control \nthemselves. (And even their resistance ultimately folds.) Regardless of sex or \nsexual orientation, once an Enticer spots a victim, the victim is doomed to the \nfomor’s depredations. \nPentex uses Enticers as Judas goats or Jezebels, depending on the circum- \nstances. Many a valiant and driven werewolf has followed a stunning Enticer \ninto a trap, never realizing his mistake until it was too late. Many a pack of young \nhotheads has been torn apart as its members fought tooth and claw for the \n“affections” of the same fomor. More often than not, an Enticer needs only \nwhisper a few encouraging words in the right ears to accomplish its dire aims. \nShould physical confrontation be necessary, however, the Enticer’s only form of \ndefense is a row of wickedly barbed fangs. \nShould a character ever manage to see through an Enticer’s seductive \nillusion, he might be surprised to see an entirely normal-looking person \nunderneath. Enticer fomori are created by repeated exposure to a highly \naddictive chemical in a special brand of cosmetics distributed by a subsidiary of \nPentex. The chemical creates an intense high in the wearer, while transforming \nthe sweat glands in the wearer’s skin into high-output pheromone factories. \nThese pheromones attract members of either sex equally (regardless of the sex \nof the person wearing the makeup) by dredging up the image of sexual perfection \nin the victim’s mind and lowering the victim’s inhibitions accordingly. \nPentex keeps Enticer fomori compliant very simply by threatening to cut off \nthe Enticer’s supply of its addictive makeup if the Enticer does not do as it is told. \nTHE EOMOBI \n@ \n\n\nE E R E C T O I  \nBorn from the disgusting womb of a Breeder Bane, the Ferectoi consider \nthemselves the larvae of the Wyrm on Earth. They look human and act human \nand have human motivations. To the casual observer, each appears entirely \nhuman (if a particularly vital and ruthless human). Even the Ferectoi’s formi+ \ndable powers remain concealed when they’re not in use. However, these fomori’s \nresemblance to humanity stops at the surface. Deep down, the Ferectoi are \nWyrmcreatures through and through. While some might struggle with their true \nnature, that nature always wins out eventually. \nIn the mean time, the Ferectoi enjoy all the pleasures of power and luxury \nlife on Earth offers. Banes and lesser Wyrm beings serve them, as do the \nunwitting humans the Ferectoi dominates in his human semblance. \nEOMORI EAMILIBS \nSometimes, groups of Banes choose the path of least resistance in bonding \nwith human hosts. These Banes congregate around blights or Hellholes in \nremote backwoods areas and infest the sequestered, inbred families that some- \ntimes also congregate in such isolated areas. Once they have become fomori \nthemselves, the older members of these families do most of the work for these \nBanes thereafter. When their offspring grow old enough, the parents take them \nto the site where the Banes wait and perform a twisted bastardization of the Rite \nof Passage. This rite makes the young adult part of the family “right and proper,” \nending the hellish existence the child has likely endured thus far. The child then \nreceives his first taste of the special Charm (and Taint) that runs in the family, \notherwise known as the “family gift.” \nERBAKEEBT \nThese beasts are almost comically monstrous. They scuttle along on long, \nmuscular arms and stunted legs. Their fingers and prehensile toes stretch out of \nproportion to their limbs. Their luminescent, unblinking eyes bulge grotesquely \nfrom the sockets. Liver spots stipple their slimy skin, and they communicate in \nporcine snorts and clicks. Morbidly obese “queen” Freakfeet lounge about laying \neggs and being served by the more able males of the species. \nOddly enough, not even the Pentex Corporation appreciates the existence \nof these disgusting beasts. Originally created by joining a Sludge Elemental \n(known as a H’ruggling Bane) with a human-amphibian genetic hybrid, the first \ngeneration of Freakfeet escaped from Pentex’s service after an explosion at the \nlab that created them. When given the opportunity, Pentex field operatives \n“sanitize” Freakfeet hives where they find them. Unfortunately, however, \nFreakfeet were designed to be prolific in any climactic conditions. The creatures \nmaintain subterranean hives all over the world, regardless of Pentex’s every \neffort to cull the expanding population. \nDespite the human DNA that led to their creation, Freakfeet young do not \ngestate within a Freakfeet queen. Rather, the queen injects her fertilized eggs \ninto the body of a living human being with a sharp stinger/ ovipositor at the base \nof her spine. Freakfeet males gather human hosts by venturing up through sewer \npipes in urban areas and abducting them. They use the Rat Head power to make \nthe journey up out of the sewer - \noften emerging through toilet bowls in their \n\n\nvictims’ homes - \nand they use the Maleate power on the victims in order to \nreverse the journey with their prize. More often than not, a human will die as a \nresult of the Freakfeet birthing process. Those hardy few who survive remain in \nthe hive as “breeders” until they either expire or are traded to another hive. \n OREH HOUNDS \nWhile it can be argued that some fomori resist the changes that overtake \nthem and make them less than human, no such case can be made for the \nGorehounds. Gorehounds revel in what they become, living up to whatever \nghastly potential they possess. The transformation into a Gorehound usually \nmarks the human’s achievement of a lifelong goal. \nDeranged loners brimming with repressed rage and sadistic fantasies make \nthe best prospective Gorehounds. To capitalize on this fresh pool of potential \nfomori, the Pentex Corporation distributes Bane-possessed slasher videotapes \nthrough a shell company called Slaughterhouse Video. Merely watching the \ntapes opens the viewer to possession by the Bane. Once in place, the Bane helps \nreduce the viewer’s inhibitions, opening the floodgates on the barely contained \nsadism. Inspired by the “heroes” of the slasher tapes he watcher, the young \nGorehound sets out to stake his own claim on trademarked over-the-top \nviolence. The serial torture and murder of which Gorehounds are capable and \nall too happy to indulge in knows no bounds. A new Gorehound might begin his \ncareer on a small scale (say by mutilating household animals in his neighbor- \nhood), but his ambition to indulge in more sensational violence grows as his \nconfidence grows. \nShould a Gorehound ever be caught or confronted, he will fight to escape \nfor as long as he can move, causing as much crippling pain and destruction as he \ncan. While unreliable as operatives or employees of Pentex, Gorehounds do the \nwork of the Wyrm with admirable zeal, and they provide an excellent distraction \nor scapegoat for actors undertaking more important Pentex initiatives. \nHOLLOW \nMEN \nAlthough no one is entirely certain of where the Hollow Men came from, \nmost speakers who have a reputable opinion on the subject agree that no other \nbreed of fomor has existed longer onEarth. These horrifying monsters have done \nmuch to bring about the destruction and ultimate corruption of Gaia. \nFrom the outside (and adistance), Hollow Men appear human, if somewhat \ndistracted and fidgety. Closer examination, however, reveals more hints to the \ntrue nature of just what a Hollow Man is. A Hollow Man’s skin bulges and ripples \nwhen he moves. His joints bend stiffly or with a too-fluid grace. His chest fails \nto rise and fall with the rhythm of respiration. Occasionally, a particularly alert \nviewer might even see a dark shape scuttling across the Hollow Man’s skin, \nclimbing out of one orifice to disappear into another. The Hollow Men appear \nthus because the bodies they wear on the outside are little more than convenient \nhomes for a horde of smaller animals possessed by a Scavenger Pack Bane. The \nspirit of the human shell remains intact enough to bond with the Bane, granting \nthe pitiful human a grotesque type of immortality in return for taking the \nScavenger Pack into his body and carrying out the urges of the Wyrm. \nThe types of animals most likely to make up a Scavenger Pack include rats, \nsnakes, bees, roaches and the larger species of spiders. \nT \nH E  EOMORI \n@ \n\n\nI \na lithe, sinewy frame with skin somewhat darker than their racial average. Yet, \nwhat sets them apart from normal people most distinctly is the jet-black sheen \nof their eyes. Very few individuals outside the Pentex corporate structure have \nseen the eyes of a Shadowfiend and lived to describe them, however. \nCRBATINC~ \nEOMORI CHARACTERS \nCreating a fomor character proceeds initially just as does the creation of a \nhuman in Laws of the Hunt. Assign the character a Nature and Demeanor, as \nwell as a motivation. Give the character six, four and three Attribute Traits in \nthe primary, secondary and tertiary Attribute categories as you see fit. Assign \nwhatever negative Traits go along with the concept as well. Finally, add in the \ncharacter’s Willpower, Backgrounds, Merits and Flaws. Don’t bother tracking \nthe Humanity Trait, however. The slow descent from full humanity to utter \ncorruption by the Wyrm is better represented through roleplaying than random \nmarks on a character sheet. \nAfter creating a human character, pick from the preceding selection a breed \nof fomor that such a character would most likely become. Reflect the change and \nthe reason why your character is most suited to that breed in your write-up of the \ncharacter’s history. (Unless, of course, you’re playing a Freakfeet fomor, in which \ncase your character history pretty much writes itself.) \nWhen you’ve come this far, assign the character Powers andTaints. You are \nnot limited in the selection of your character’s Powers, but keep in mind that \nsome Powers are more appropriate to some breeds than others. Remember also \nthat Powers do not come at all cheap. You cannot spend Freebie Traits on \nPowers, you cannot spend the Traits derived from Flaws on Powers, and you \ncannot spend the Traits derived from Negative Traits on Powers. The only \nTraits you can spend on Powers are those you receive from taking Taints. \nLuckily, though, you can spend the points you receive from Taints on Traits \nother than Powers. \nFor instance, you can assign your character seven Traits worth of Taints \nthen take seven Traits worth of Powers. If you don’t want seven Traits worth of \n\n\nPowers, you could take four Traits worth of Powers and spend the remaining \nTraits just as you would spend Traits derived from Flaws or Negative Traits. \nU S I N ~ T H E  \nEOMORI I N A  CHRONICLE \nPotential players of fomor characters, be prepared to hear this response to \nyour initial request: “You want to play a what! ?” Fomori are not pretty, they’re \nnot heroic, and they certainly aren’t going to come out victorious in the end. \nEven when the fomori are the good guys in a chronicle, they’re still bad guys. \nThey exist by only either the grace of the Wyrm or thanks to the genius of Pentex \nscientists. Should the fomor ever step out of line and try to do the right thing, \none or the other will assuredly make him pay. Fomori, as characters, have little \nto no redeeming value whatsoever. How then can you possibly hope to use such \na character in an ongoing chronicle? \nOn one hand, the easy answer to this question is to use fomori as Pentex and \nthe Wyrm intend: as the bad guys. Fomori make excellent villains, shock troops \nand Wyrm-beast mooks. No better evidence of the Corrupter’s presence on \nEarth than the existence of these monsters. Roleplaying a fomor offers a player \nthe chance to explore the deepest, most vile depths to which his imagination can \nsink then put that nastiness aside when the character meets his inevitable end. \nLetting your character give in wholly to his evil nature (for the sake of plot) is \none of the most cathartic experiences roleplaying has to offer. At the same time, \nthe character’s story demonstrates the price of power and the importance of \nkeeping your darker urges tightly in check. \nBy the same token, it’s just fun to play the bad guy sometimes. If you’re \nenjoying yourself by playing a right bastard, the other players should have just \nas much fun trying to put a stop to your nefarious schemes. Nothing is more fun \nthan overcoming an unrepentantly evil opponent, especially if that opponent \nis one’s equal in all but motivation. Playing the villain everyone loves to hate \nis an awful lot of fun, even when the good guys finally manage to pull together \nand conquer you once and for all. \nOn the other hand, one can tell a compelling story in which the fomori \ncharacters are the protagonists. This type of story, however, is not nearly as much \nfunas the preceding one. Fomor-centered stories are some of the most horrifying \nand tragic tales one can find in the World of Darkness. Consider the life-cycle \nof the standard fomor: A bleak, depressing or violent life leaves gaps in the soul \nof the potential victim. A spirit of corruption finds (or is directed to) those gaps, \nand it begins to attach itself to them. The hapless individual feels this intrusion, \nbut he is powerless to prevent it. After all, some part of him wants the spirit to \nfill the void within him. When the fusion is complete, the victim’s body warps \nand mutates to match the changes that go on in his mind. After the transforma- \ntion (or before, in many cases), a corporation driven by a force more sinister than \ngreed tries in every way to exploit the new monster in any way it can. Finally, \noften before the poor, pitiful wretch can come to grips with the horrifying \nchanges that have been so rudely thrust upon him, he runs afoulof vicious zealots \nwho want to tear him apart with tooth and claw for no better reason than the \nfact that he even exists. \n\n\nnew state, all while trying to hold tightly to what made them human in the first \n- -  \nof halves as a multiplication of wholes. \nThe following list is not all-inclusive, but it does cover the basic range \navailable to the fomor breeds listed. Storvtellers and Dlavers are encouraged to \nBerserker (variable) \nThe fomor begins play with Rage Traits equal to the cost of the Power at \ncharacter creation. He may use these Traits just Garou use their Rage, but the \nplayer may not buy more Rage Traits after character creation. The fomor regains \nspent Rage the first time he is wounded in a game session, at the beginning of \nany new conflict or when he’s particularly humiliated. \nBrain Eating (6 Traits) \nA character using this Power robs his victim of Mental Traits and adds \nthose Traits to his own Mental Traits. The fomor’s player steals one Mental \nTrait from the victim per Willpower Test he wins. The transfer affects the \ncharacters’ effective maximum number of Mental Traits for the rest of the \ngame session. Should either player spend a Willpower Trait to refresh his \ncharacter’s Mental Traits during that game session, the expenditure refreshes \nthe newly adjusted number of Traits. The stolen Traits return at the beginning \nof the next game session. \nThis attack does not constitute a physical assault, but the victim will know \nwho is using the power. Should the fomor actually eat the victim’s physical brain \nafter the victim has died, he adds the victim’s Mental Traits and Willpower \nTraits to his own for the remainder of the session. \nChameleon Coloration (four Traits) \nWhen the player spends Mental Traits, the character’s skin changes color \nto blend in with his surroundings. The nature of the change causes the Mental \nClaws, Fangs or Horns (three, five or seven Traits) \nAn unnatural adaptation (be it cybernetic, organic or a mixture of the two) \nmakes the fomor’s attacks all the more vicious. Although these adaptations can \nbe disguised or retracted, they cannot be removed without causing serious \nphysical pain. In combat, claws, fangs and horns add an extra level of lethal \ndamage to the fomor’s attacks. The base Trait cost purchases one adaptation; the \nsecondary cost provides two. The full seven-Trait cost adds all three bodily \n\n\nColony Powers (variable) \nParticular to the Hollow Men, Colony Powers bestow an ability to the fomor \nthat is usually attributed to the animal that makes up its Scavenger Pack. A \nHollow Man full of spiders might be able to scale sheer walls or infect his victims \nwith a deadly venom. Being inhabited by a Scavenger Pack of rats might grant \nthe fomor the Rat Head Power. The Storyteller should assess the advantage the \nColony Powers grant the character and price them accordingly. \nCorrupted Visions (four Traits) \nWhen the player spends a Mental Trait and wins a Mental Test against his \nopponent, the fomor causes his victim to suffer from compelling hallucinations. \nFomori use this Power to prod victims into action or to drive them over the edge \ninto insanity. The victim’s player may banish these hallucinations by spending \na Willpower Trait. \nDarksight (two Traits) \nThe fomor can see in perfect darkness, and the player suffers no Trait \npenalties for impaired visibility. This power represents chiropteran sonar, feline \nlow-light vision or a heightened sensitivity to disturbances in the air, as is \nappropriate to the character. Should the character’s compensatory sense be \noverloaded suddenly by sensation, however, he is completely stunned for one \nturn, and he suffers the Negative Trait Oblivious x 2 for the entirety of the scene \nafter which the character recovers from the onslaught. He also loses the \nDarksight advantage for the rest of the scene. \nDispersion (four Traits) \nAs another Power specific to the Hollow Men, Dispersion is a fantastic \ndefense mechanism. By spending a Trait of Willpower, the fomor’s player can \nforce the entire Scavenger Pack to evacuate its hollow human shell at once. The \nempty human body collapses and remains inert, but the fomor’s entire con- \nsciousness extends to each member of the Scavenger Pack. Should the animal \ncentral to the Pack be killed, the fomor dies. When a Hollow Man is beaten to \nthe Incapacitated health level, this Power activates automatically. \nEnhancement (three Traits) \nBy winning a Social Challenge against the player of her intended victim, \nthe player of a fomor can cause herself to appear to be her victim’s ideal physical \nmate, regardless of the fomor’s actual appearance. Should the fomor’s player lose \nthe test, the fomor still seems attractive, if only slightly above average. \nFoot Pads (one Trait) \nSpongy pads on the bottom of the fomor’s feet muffle the sound of his \nfootsteps to such a degree that only supernatural perception can detect the sound. \nGarou Gifts (variable) \nThe fomor’s player may purchase and use Garou Gifts for one Trait times \nImmunity to the Delirium (one Trait) \nHaving become monsters themselves, the sight of a werewolf in its Crinos form \nthe Gift’s level plus one. \ndoes not trigger the instinctual fear response to which normal humans are heir. \n\n\nMalleate (six Traits) \nBy piercing the hide of her opponent, a fomor injects a powerful venom \nunder the skin that changes the victim’s body into a putty-like mass. The fomor \nmay then warp and shape that mass as she sees fit. Using this power requires the \nfomor’s player to win a Physical Challenge to make the first contact and \nsuccessive Physical Challenges to make the desired changes. The effects of this \nPower are permanent unless the victim uses the Gifts: Resist Toxin, Doppelganger \nor Adaptation. A Garou can also purge the venom from the body of a victim with \na successful Rite of Cleansing. When the venom is gone, the victim’s body \nreturns to normal. \nChanges made to one’s body by this Power cause health levels of aggravated \ndamage. The severity of this damage is up to Storyteller discretion and the \nmagnitude of the change. \nMind Rape (six Traits) \nIf a fomor’s player spends a Willpower Trait and wins a Mental Challenge, \nhis character can invade the mind of a victim and pull out even well hidden \nsecret thoughts. That is to say, after a successful challenge, the user of this Power \ncan demand from the victim a complete and honest answer to one question. The \nplayer of the victim must give as thorough an answer as possible, even if his \ncharacter has blocked the information out subconsciously. This Power cannot \ndetect uses of other supernatural mind-altering powers, nor can it retrieve \ninformation that another supernatural power has erased. Use of this Power is in \nno way subtle, as far as the victim is concerned. \nProlonged Life (four Traits) \nThe Bane fused to the human’s soul extends his life span far beyond that of \nany mere mortal. Any fomor with this Power, however, must take the Addiction \nTaint. The fomor will not die of old age as long as he engages regularly in his \naddiction. This Power, however, will not protect the fomor from the external \nrigors of its existence. \nRat Head (four Traits) \nBy spending a Physical Trait, the player allows his character to wriggle \nthrough a space roughly one-twentieth of his size. For example, a fomor of \naverage human size could squeeze underneath a closed door or escape danger \nthrough the drain in a sink. \nRegeneration (five Traits) \nThe fomor with this power recovers from non-aggravated damage at the \nsame accelerated rate werewolves do. \nScent of the Wyld or Weaver (five Traits) \nThe fomor’s player spends a Mental Trait in order to mask his character’s \nobvious Wymvtaint. Characters who use the Gift: Sense Wyrm on a fomor using \nthis Power fail automatically, gaining a strong sense that the fomor is actually \nacreature of the Wyld or Weaver. However, neither Red Talons nor Glasswalkers \nare fooled by this Power. \nSlobber Snot (three Traits) \nOozing warts cover the fomor’s skin, exuding a slick coat of foul-smelling \nslime. This slime grant’s the fomor’s player a free retest in all Physical Challenges \n\n\nin which he is trying to break free of an opponent’s grasp. This slime also makes \nit particularly easy for a fomor to escape from ropes, handcuffs or tightly confined \nspaces, The slime’s distinctive and powerful stench puts the fomor’s player one \nTrait down in all challenges related to stealth. \nSpirit Ties (variable) \nThe fomor may draw upon a well of Gnosis, which he can use just as the \nGarou can. The player receives one Gnosis Trait per Trait he spends into the \nPower at character creation. He cannot increase this Trait thereafter. The fomor \nregains spent Gnosis Traits by meditating (see Laws of the Wild), destroying \nfetishes or slaughtering Umbral spirits. \nTAINTS \nThe Taints listed here serve as guidelines for building fomor characters. \nPlayers should work out the specifics of each Taint with their Storytellers with \nan eye toward their games’ particular balance and the dramatic needs of their \nstories. \nAddiction (variable) \nThe fomor must engage in some activity on a regular schedule, lest \nwithdrawal and distraction overwhelm him. The frequency with which the \nfomor must indulge his taste varies from once per month to once per hour. The \nsubstance or action to which he is addicted also varies. The player may even \ndesignate the use of one of his character’s Powers - \nsuch as Brain Eating - \nas \nthe activity to which the character is addicted. Should the character deny his \naddiction, he loses a health level, and the player is one Trait down in all \nchallenges per period that the character has abstained. \nBrainwashed (three Traits) \nAs a result of intensive psychological treatment or skillful emotional \nmanipulation, your character has adopted with fanatical zeal a belief that was \nnot originally her own. She will not question this belief, and she reacts violently \nto those who question its validity. In her opinion, the naysayersagainst her belief \nare obviously vicious malcontents bent on destroying all she holds dear, no \nmatter how ridiculous the idea with which she has been brainwashed is. Not \neven blatant, incontrovertible evidence of malfeasance can shake the faith with \nwhich she’s been indoctrinated. The player of a brainwashed fomor is down two \nTraits in any confrontation against an acknowledged representative of her \ncharacter’s faith. \nThe Crusties (three Traits) \nFomor with the Power: Slobber Snot are the most common victims of this \nTaint. Once a month, for a period of approximately a week, the coating of mucus \nand oil on the fomor’s skin dries out and flakes off in itchy, irritating patches. \nDuring the period of this affliction, a fomor is one Trait down on all challenges \ndue to the constant distraction. On the plus side, the Slobber Snot Power still \nfunctions optimally during this period. However, instead of the low-viscosity \nslime protecting the fomor’s skin, the flakes themselves provide the benefit by \ntearing away more easily. \n\n\nDerangement (three Traits) \nFomor are not the most stable individuals to begin with, but your character \nhas gone further around the bend than most. The Bane that possesses your fomor \nhas discovered a particularly prickly spot in your character’s psyche, and it \nexploits that sensitive spot in any way it can. This mental malady is now the core \nof your character’s every motivation. \nCheck a psychology textbook for the symptoms of some common mental \nillnesses and roleplay them in everything your character does. You may not \nspend Willpower Traits to overcome the drives of your character’s derangement. \nPhysical Wasting (six Traits) \nOne of your character’s Powers takes a physical toll on your character’s \nbody. Whenever the character uses that Power in a scene, he loses one Physical \nTrait for the scene. Each subsequent scene in which the character uses the Power \nin question robs the character of another Physical Trait unless he has rested \nsufficiently between uses. Wasted Traits return at the rate of one Trait per hour \nafter the scene in which they are used. \nRotting (six Traits) \nThe fomor’s body is falling apart. The character loses one health level per \nmonth as his body withers and decays. The fomor’s player may make a Static Test \nto hold off the loss of the health level at the beginning of each month, but he \nmust win the test. Players who test successfully to attack a character with this \nTaint may immediately make a second Static Test. If the attacking player wins \nthe additional test, his character’s attack inflicts an additional health level of \nnormal damage. \nWalking Bomb (five Traits) \nAgents of the Pentex Corporation have implanted an explosive charge in \nthe base of your character’s skull to secure his future cooperation. The bomb can \nbe set to detonate under avariety of conditions (a remote switch, a heart monitor \nimplanted in the Pentex agent himself, a proximity sensor or a simple count- \ndown timer), but only a qualified Pentex explosives expert can deactivate it. \nNeither blunt trauma nor even a direct hit from a .357 slug will cause the bomb \nto go off, but the fomor’s employer can detonate the device at whim. The charge \nis shaped so that the explosion will blow the fomor’s head clean off with as little \ncollateral damage as possible. \nVariants of this device flood the fomor’s system with a deadly venom, \ndeliver a debilitating electric shock, release a highly caustic acid or pump ultra- \nconcentrated depressants into the fomor’s bloodstream. \n\n\nWRAITH MFRITS AND ELAWS \nFOR oblivion \nby Jess Heinig \nThe dead have plenty to worry about. It’s tough enough just hanging on after dying. Since \nevery wraith is an individual, complete with carefully plotted goals and driving Passions, it \nonly makes sense that their foibles, problems and advantages be similarly unique. \nEach wraith character has a personal set of Attributes, Abilities, Arcanoi, Passions and \nFetters. Some, though, have their own spins on such things, or peculiarities that aren’t \ncommon to other wraiths. Thus, we give you Merits and Flaws for Oblivion characters. \nRemember: A modifier to bidding affects the number of Traits required to enter a \nchallenge. A one-Trait bid penalty means that you must bid an extra Trait on a challenge. \nA modifier to resolution affects total Traits for resolving ties and overbids. \nCORPOREAL \nMERITSAND \nELAWS \nBOTCHED \nMOLIITION( 1-3 TRAIT \nTE LAW) \nSomething went horribly, horribly wrong during a Moliate attempt, and your character’s \nCorpus has resisted attempts to change it back. This deformity gives him problems, and it’s \nnot going to go away soon. Perhaps some guilty, dark part of your character’s psyche believes \nthat he really deserves to reflect the deformity, or maybe he’s just an unlucky punk who’s \nstuck with an extra tentacle for the rest of his existence. \nFor one Trait, your character has a relatively minor and annoying moliation “scar.” \nPerhaps he has an ugly-looking hunch, a discoloration or some other noticeable incongru- \nity. This incongruity makes him easily recognizable unless he takes steps to cover it, and it’s \nin an inconvenient place where it’ll take some work to conceal it. A funny color under one’s \narm doesn’t count. A hand that’s been moliated into a gnarled, inflexible lump is a much \nmore reasonable expression of this Flaw. \nFor two Traits, the moliation problem is fairly nasty. Maybe your character has a \nwithered arm, or his skin is scaly in patches due to a failed attempt at creating armor. When \nthe botched moliation isn’t concealed, the character suffers an extra negative Social Trait \nof Repugnant, for which you gain no extra Traits. Your character might be able to conceal \nthis problem, but it takes some real effort. \nFor three Traits, some terrible mistake inconveniences your character horribly. Not only \ndo you suffer a Negative Social Trait of Repugnant, but you also suffer a one-Trait penalty to \nall challenges where the specific moliation might hinder the character. For instance, if your \ncharacter’s legs are fused together above the knees, he will have trouble running or balancing. \nIf his head is sunk into the center of his torso, he’ll have difficulty seeing peripherally or \nspeaking to people. These botches are generally too extreme to conceal. \nThe victim of a botched moliation may be able to repair the damage eventually (with \na good use of Moliate and the expenditure of experience Traits equal to twice the Flaw’s \nvalue), but it’s sure to be an annoyance for quite a while. You must wear a tag in a \nconspicuous location, which explains the nature of the deformity. If another wraith uses \nMoliate to correct this deformitv, his player must spend one extra Pathos Trait beyond the \nart’s standard cost per turn he‘wishds the moliaied change to last. At the end of those \n\n\nSome feature (such as blue hair, a prominent tattoo carried over from life or eyes of \ndifferent colors) really stands out about your character. Unlike having a botched moliation, \nthis feature is not necessarily repulsive or problematic, but it’s also not something that a \ncharacter could hope to change permanently, either. Indicate this feature by wearing make- \nup to simulate it (or by wearing a prominent card that describes it). The Moliate Arcanos \ncould cover it up temporarily, of course. After the moliation, the character’s appearance \nreverts to normal at the end of a scene. \nROTTING (a TRAIT  LAW) \nI \nOrganic matter in the land of the living decays and rots away eventually, and that fact \nhaunts your character’s mind. In fact, it’s so closely tied to her conception of death that her \nvery self-image as a dead thing is corrupted by rot. Chunks of her body are rotted away, and \ntatters of flesh hang over corded muscle. Naturally, this psychonecrosis doesn’t necessarily \nhinder or damage the Corpus itself, but it’s definitely unpleasant and unsightly. You suffer \nan automatic one-Trait penalty to Social Challenge resolution. When interacting with \nmortals, they react to the Fog (Oblivion, p. 234) much more strongly. If the player of the \nmortal wins his Static Mental Challenge against 20 Traits, the Storyteller or Narrator \nrepresenting the Fog gets an automatic retest. \nF R A ~ I L E  conpus (3 TRAIT fiLAW) \nThe strands of will that hold your character’s plasm together just aren’t as strong as \nthose of many other wraiths. When he become insubstantial due to physical damage, he \nloses two levels of Corpus instead of just one. If he ever suffers four or more levels of damage \nin a single blow, you must win or tie a Simple Test, lest the character collapse immediately \ninto a Harrowing. \nA M B I D C K T R ~ U S  ( I TRAIT MERIT) \nMost people are good with just one hand or the other, but your character is equally good \nwith both. You suffer no Trait penalty for using either hand since your character IS equally \ngood with his right or left (or Moliated tentacle or whatever). Of course, you still suffer a \none-Trait coordination penalty if your character uses both hands at once, but you incur no \nadditional penalty for using an uncoordinated hand. \nInterestingly, many wraiths seem to slide toward ambidexterity over time. As a wraith‘s \nselfdimage changes, his sense of handedness may well erode. \n~\nu\ni\ni\no\np\n \n~ I p e ( 1 - 4  TRAIT MERIT) \nWhile most wraiths are sad, pallid things, your character’s Corpus is so strong that it \npractically glows with vibrancy. The character seems more “solid” than most plasm, and it’s \nharder to discorporate her. For each Trait that you spend on this Merit, your character starts \nwith one extra level of permanent Corpus. While above 10 Corpus, though, she is \nextraordinarily conspicuous to other entities in the lands of the dead. \nMALLCABLE \n(a TRAIT \nMERIT) \nLike the semi-liquid plasm from which it’s formed, your character’s Corpus flows into \nnew shapes easily. Anyone using the Moliate Arcanos upon her (including herself) receives \na two-Trait resolution bonus. \nDISEMBODIED (6 TRAIT MERIT) \nMost wraiths form a corporeal shell that resembles an idealized version of their living \nform. Your character, however, has discarded the entire notion of flesh. He has no Corpus \nor body at all; he’s just a floating voice, a collection of memories and thoughts. \n\n\nanything, nor can he interact with anyone physically. He has no Physical Traits at all. He \ncan’t even use Arcanoi that would interact with physical material, including Embody, \nInhabit, Moliate, Outrage and Pandemonium. (Similar restrictions might apply to certain Jade \nKingdom Arcanoi, too.) \nOn the upside, your character is pretty much immune to physical trauma. He simply \ncan’t be hurt that way. Nobody can make Physical Challenges against you; weapons can’t \nhurt your character because he’s not there. Arcanoi and other powers that require touch or \ncontact with some part of the body fail because he have no body to touch. Ifsome power that \nyour character has would require you to make a Physical Challenge, just use a Mental \nChallenge instead. Your character has no Corpus rating, so he obviously can’t be sent into \na normal Destruction Harrowing. Should he fall into a Harrowing by running out of \nWillpower (or, perhaps, by falling into a Harrowing with another wraith), you risk \npermanent Willpower instead. If he ever runs out of permanent Willpower Traits, he \ndisappears into Oblivion. \nYou should wear a tag to indicate your character’s discorporate status. It helps if you wear \na shroud or the like as well, so that you have no distinguishing features. Remember, though, \nthat your character cannot pick up, push or touch anything on either side of the Shroud. \nMENTAL \nMERITSAND \nELAWS \nA ~ ~ I C T I O N ( I - B  TRAIT ~ ~ a w )  \nJust as wraiths cling tenuously to the remnants of existence through force of will and \nmemory, they sometimes fall victim to dangerous and compelling psychological drives. Your \ncharacter is attached to some activity or substance in such a fashion. If he is denied access \nto the subject of his addiction, you lose a number of Traits equal to the value of this Flaw \nin all test-resolutions. The source of this addiction may even be harmful in some way, but \nthe character is miserable without it. He will go to any lengths he can to fulfill this addiction \n(including Skinriding or possessing humans who indulge in it). \nC O M P U L S I O N  ( I TRAIT #LAW) \nYour character is compelled to perform some sort of noticeable, curious or harmful \naction. It may be a constant urge or just one that strikes at inconvenient times. Perhaps he \ncan never seem to shut up, or maybe he twitches spasmodically for several seconds any time \nsomeone mentions the Hierarchy. Maybe he hoards every scrap of relic detritus he comes \nacross, no matter how useless the junk seems at the time. You must roleplay the effects of \nthe compulsion. You can spend a Willpower Trait to suppress the urge; if you fail to roleplay \nthe compulsion, a Narrator may rule that you have spent such a Trait already. \nD A R K  \nSFCRET(I \nTRAIT LAW) \nYour character keeps skeletons in the closet.. . possibly literally. Some dirty deed in her \npast haunts her. Although it’s not widely known, if knowledge of the misdeed were to get out, \nit would cause serious inconvenience. Perhaps she was Reaped by a Mnemos, or maybe she \nopened the gates to a Citadel for the Spectres. Worse still, situations seem to come up from \ntime to time where her dark secret might get out. She may have to make difficult or \nembarrassing compromises to keep the truth under wraps. The Storyteller determines when \nand how the secret comes up in play. Should it ever be exposed, your character is likely to suffer \nthe social consequences. Gaining an enemy or losing status are just two of the possibilities. \nB C H O E S O P T H E  p A S T ( 1 - 3  T R A I T  ELAW) \nWhether consciously or not, your character can’t leave the living world behind. Some \ntrapping associated with him in life continues to bleed into the living lands even after his \n\n\ndeath. Some characteristic or trait associated with the character during his mortal days \ncontinues to manifest wherever he goes, even in a fashion noticeable to the living. These \nmanifestations are uncontrollable, and they don’t relate directly to your character’s actions. \nRather, they just “happen” in the material world when he’s around. \nFor one Trait, the character causes a specific, peculiar scent in the world of the living. \nPeople might catch a whiff of a perfume that she used to wear or smell the cordite from the \ngun involved in her death. This scent is noticeable to anyone who searches for it specifically. \nSomeone who has a vague idea that something is wrong - \nperhaps because of a subtle use \nof Arcanoi in the area-can \nmake a Static Mental Challenge (difficulty of six Traits), with \nsuccess indicating that he notices the scent and recognizes it. \nFor two Traits, your character’s presence causes sounds in the physical realm. People \nmight hear ghostly footsteps, catch the hint of rattling chains or notice a distant laugh. \nPeople in the immediate area will almost certainly hear some manifestation, although the \nsounds are not constant, and someone who just brushes by may not be present for an echo. \n(Use a StaticMentalChallenge atadifficultyofsixTraitsfromsomeonenearyou ifhe might \nhear an unexpected echo.) People near your location - \njust outside the room, for instance \n- \nmight hear an echo if one occurs. A Static Mental Challenge (difficulty of eight Traits) \nis appropriate, although someone who’s listening specifically for such things would notice \nthe effect. \nFor three Traits, your wraith actually causes some sort of visual manifestation. Perhaps \npeople see dancing candle flames when she’s around or a hazy blob of light or a hallucinatory, \ntranslucent image of something important to your character in life. People in the room with \nyou will almost certainly notice and be startled by such manifestations. Individuals within \na reasonable distance will notice such things if they succeed on a Static Mental Challenge \nwith a difficulty of six Traits. \nYou can take this Flaw multiple times to generate multiple Effects. For six Traits, your \ncharacter creates a hazy image accompanied by strange sounds and smells. \no ~ & R C O N ~ ~ I D F N T (  \nI TRAIT BLAW) \nYour character believes in a rather exaggerated impression of his actual capabilities. \nWhile most people have enough sense not to get in over their heads, he honestly believes \nthat he’s better than he really is, and he lets that belief get him into trouble. During \nsituations in which he’s under duress or threat, your character is likely to forge ahead \nheedless of the consequences and convinced of victory. \nSome overpowering fear seizes your character in the presence of a specific object or \nsituation. This fear may be tied to circumstances of her death - \na fear of large bodies of \nwater, for a drowning victim - \nor it may come from some hidden impulse that predates her \ndemise. When the character encounters the object ofher fear, you must expend a Willpower \nTrait or retreat in terror. If unable to escape, fear makes the character shaky and uncertain. \nYou are two Traits down on all challenges in such a situation. \n~ o N n u s F D  \n(a TRAIT ILAW) \nThe world is a disjointed place. Everything is disturbed, noisy and grating. Maybe \nyour mind was unhinged during death, or perhaps you can’t seem to filter out all the \nbackground chaos of the Underworld. You are always a bit distracted and disoriented, but \nwhen you are subjected to intense stimuli, such as a sudden whipping of a Maelstrom, a \nbarrage of conversation from multiple people or a loud and chaotic situation, your mind \nsimply can’t make sense of it all. Under such stress you must spend a Willpower Trait to \novercome your problems for the scene, or else you just curl up, helplessly unable to cope \nwith your surroundings. \n\n\nWell, your character’s already died, so it’s not like curiosity can kill him, right? He just \ntends to stick his nose into anything and everything. When presented with an innocuous \nlittle mystery - \na locked container, a secret room, a mysterious library or the like - \nyou \nmust win a Simple Test, lest your character mosey on into trouble. \n~ B s c s s I o N  \n(a TRAIT PLAW) \nA driving fixation permeates your character’s every thought and drives him to \nunhealthy extremes in pursuit of his fascination. Often, he finds himself in difficult straits \nbecause of the obsession. Perhaps he would spend his last obolus for some relic of a sort that \nhe collects obsessively, or maybe he hangs out around some Skinlands area that’s dangerous \nto him. Only by spending a Willpower Trait can you overcome your character’s obsession \nfor a short time. \nStorytellers should make sure that obsessions do not tie into strong Passions. A \ndisadvantage that isn’t a disadvantage isn’t really worth much, after all. \nV C N q ’ E A N C E  (a T R A I T  PLAW) \nA certain score must be settled, whether it’s against some still-living foes or against an \nalready-dead one, and your character intends to see justice done. Heck, maybe your \ncharacter intends to kill her enemy then send him screaming to Oblivion. In short, someone \ndid your wraith wrong, and now she’s driven in the pursuit of a vendetta. You must spend \na Willpower Trait if your character has anopportunity to pursue her vengeance but you want \nto avoid doing so-for \ninstance, to avoid screaming and charging into the Labyrinth to get \nthe Spectre that Harrowed your daughter’s ghost. \nAgain, Storytellers should make sure that the Vengeance Flaw does not tie into any \nPassions.Thewraithdoesnotdrawstrengthfrom \nhervengeance; she just hasanunrelenting \nneed to get even. \nD R I V I N ~  9 0 a L ( 3  TRAIT PLAW) \nSome overreaching goal pushes your character on, even past the strength of will that \nit took to cheat death. He’ll never achieve this goal completely, but he keeps trying. This \ngoal is limitless in depth, yet your character feels compelled to strive toward it constantly. \nExamples of such goals include proving to the living world that ghosts really do exist, tearing \ndown the Hierarchy entirely and making an all-inclusive map of all of the Far Shores. You \ndon’t gain any bonus Traits when pursuing your character’s driving goal, but you must spend \na Willpower Trait to avoid pursuing it. The goal directs and focuses all of your character’s \nactions. \nLike other similar Flaws, Driving Goal cannot tie to a wraith‘s Passions. \nP L A S H B A C K S  (3 T R A I T  PLAW) \nWhen your character is under stress, he flashes back to some similar horrible situation \nin his past. Perhaps he has memories of his time as a soldier, and he suffers post-traumatic \nstress syndrome. Maybe he relives horrible memories of a torturous adolescence. It’s entirely \npossible that he relives the events of his most recent Harrowing time and again. While the \nwraith suffers these flashbacks, he’s off in his own little world. He can’t hear or interact with \nthe people and circumstances around him. He might sometimes incorporate a person or \naction into the nightmare fantasy, but it’s always in the fashion of what he hallucinates, \nwhich means that he’s functionally useless for at least a full turn. \n\n\nYour character has a deep and abiding respect for life. Perhaps she was always this \ncompassionate, or maybe she got that way after she lost her own. Either way, she is loath to \nuse violence or to inflict harm on others. She’ll never endanger people or other wraiths \nwillingly, nor will she actively harm another person. These objections aren’t nearly as strong \nwith respect to animals, Spectres and other creatures, but she still dislikes violence or \ninflicting injury in any form. If the character is forced into a confrontational situation, she \nmay go so far as to defend herself, but you suffer a one- or two-Trait penalty because the \ncharacter’s heart isn’t in it. Such a character would sooner run away from a fight than hurt \nsomeone in self-defense. \nI \nC O M M O N  S E N S E  ( I  T R A I T  MERIT) \nThey say common sense ain’t nearly so common these days, but your character is a \nrepository of such wisdom. Her intuition and folk sayings carry her through many a rough \nsituation with simple wit. When your character is about to do something impractical or just \nstupid, the Storyteller will stop you and warn you that the action may not be sensible. This \nMerit is excellent for new players, in keeping them from making mistakes due to inexperi- \nence playing the game. \nC O N C E N T R A T I O N  ( I T R A I T  MERIT) \nWhen your character focuses on a task, he shuts out all distractions completely and lets \nabsolute precision overtake him. Nothing shakes this resolve. You never suffer any penalty \nTraits due to environmental circumstances such as loud noises, strobing lights or howling \nMaelstrom-winds. \nL I ~ A T N I N ~  \nCALCULATOR( \nI TRAIT MERIT) \nYour character has a natural talent with numbers. He performs complex calculations \nin his head with ease and near-perfect accuracy. Higher mathematics such as calculating \nstandard deviation and variance or calculating trajectory require a few moments more of \nthought (and the expenditure of a Mental Trait). Number theory may be entirely beyond \nyou, but nobody’s perfect. \nIf your character has this Merit, you never need to test to perform basic math \ncalculations on the fly. You [the player] can use a calculator, ifyou like, even ifyour character \ndoesn’t own one; the character runs all the numbers in his head. Vegas casino owners hate \n. people like this. \nCODE \nO P  HONOR( \na TRAIT \nMERIT) \nAcharacterwithastrongcode ofhonor continues to follow aspecificset ofbeliefs, even \nafter death. This discipline gives the wraith strength, and his adherence to his code stands \nout as exceptional. Work with the Storyteller to detail the code of honor as aspecific ethical \nor moral framework. Although your character may not delineate it in specific terms, it \nshould be written down out of game to give a basic idea of what behavior he considers \nunacceptable. Any time supernatural compulsion is brought to bear in a manner that would \nviolate said code of honor, you get a free retest to resist. \nE I D E T I C  M E M O R Y (  B TRAIT MERIT) \nYour character has a mind like a steel trap, and this one’s not rusty. She remembers the \ngeneral sense of most events that she experiences, and she’s particularly good at remember- \ning names, dates and written material. After a single turn of concentration, she can \nmemorize a page of material or the gist of a scene completely. Doing so requires a Static \nMental Challenge, difficulty of six Traits, if the character is in combat or otherwise under \nduress. You should have a small “cheat sheet” of notes so that you and the Storyteller can \nagree on what your character has committed to memory. \n\n\nlncidentallv. rnc‘moric‘s of this ilualit\\r arc cxtremelv clear and conclse to the .Mnemosvnrs \n, I  \n,\nI\n \nArcanos. A Mnemos who delves into these memories sees them with vivid clarity. Conversely, \nif someone tries to erase or alter said memories, the operation leaves jagged “holes” around the \narea affected. Therefore, you get a free retest to defend against memory manipulation, but \nothers looking in on your character’s memories gain a retest to draw out details. \nNATURAL \nLINBUIST( \nB TRAIT \nMERIT) \nAlthough your character don’t necessarily have the ability to learn extra languages \nautomatically, he does have a powerful command of language in general. He finds it easy to \nsort out principles and ideas in other languages. You get a three-Trait bonus in all challenges \nrelated to any languages that your character knows. Of course, since all wraiths speak the \nlanguage of the dead, this Merit is most useful with written material or when interacting \nwith the Quick. \nI R O N  \nWILL(+ TRAIT \nMERIT) \nIt’s very difficult to shake a character with an iron will from his chosen course. Even \nmagical compulsions take minimal hold against such formidable determination. You may \nexpend a Willpower Trait to gain a retest against any use of the vampiric Dominate \nDiscipline, and if you win, your character is immune to that vampire’s further uses of \nDominate against him for the rest of the scene. Furthermore, you gain three extra Traits in \nall defenses against direct mental (not emotional) manipulation. \nS C L P  C O N P I D F N T ( 5  T R A I T  MEBIT) \nIn difficult situations, your character draws upon a reservoir of skill and confidence to \nperform with grace. When your character is forced to perform some difficult task, you need \nonly spend a Willpower Trait to succeed automatically. \nWhen you’re making a Static Challenge with a difficulty of six Traits or more, you can \nspend a Willpower Trait for automatic success. This trick works only if the subject of the \nchallenge is not another character. Your character could manage to open a tough lock \nautomatically (if he has the Security Ability), or he might manage to jump across a chasm, \nbut he wouldn’t be able to use the benefits of this Merit to Crescendo someone into Oblivion. \nNote specifically that this Merit supersedes the normal ruling that Willpower cannot \nbe used to win a Static Challenge automatically. Remember, though, that it does not apply \nto Simple Tests, to challenges with a difficulty of less than six Traits or to challenges against \nother characters (including Narrator characters). \nSOCIAL \nMERITSAND \nELAWS \nE N E M Y (  1-5 TRAIT E L A ~ )  \nSomeone out there is after your character, and he wants her dead, dead, dead. (For good \nthis time.) This enemy is probably a fellow wraith or a Spectre, but it might be some other \nsort of creature capable of causing serious problems. The Trait value of this Flaw determines \nthe overall potency of the enemy. For one Trait, your character has an opponent roughly \nsimilar in power to herself; for five Traits, a seemingly unstoppable enemy is out to do her \nin. The motives of this enemy should tie in to your character’s background and history in \nsome fashion. The Storyteller determines when and how the enemy intervenes in stories- \npossibly even to the point of going after your character’s entire Circle as well. \ns H r ( I  TRAIT E L A ~ )  \nSome people are just uncomfortable around crowds and in social situations. When your \n\n\nB o o N ( I - 3  TRAIT \nMERIT) \nSomeone owes your character. Maybe this someone is a lowly wraith among a \nRenegade gang, or maybe he’s an important Hierarchy official. The more important the \nwraith, and the more he owes, the greater the value of the boon. \nFor one Trait, someone owes your character for going out of her way on his behalf. He’ll \ngive you useful information or shelter, but he probably won’t do anything risky for her. \nFor two Traits, your character did someone a serious favor. This someone might sneak \nyour wraith some contraband or look the other way while she cross through restricted \nterritory. He may also speak up on her behalf within his organization once or twice. (Just \nhope that he doesn’t go into Catharsis and sell your character out.) \nFor three Traits, some wraith pretty much owes his existence to your character. He’ll \nshield and protect her to the best of his ability, speak up for her with his organization and \neven break a few wraithly laws to pay off the debt. \nNote that if a powerful Gaunt owes your character are a boon, however, the wraith \nprobably won’t give her as much as a less powerful wraith would. One can assume that a \nGaunt has sufficient influence and power to pay his debts with little effort, after all. This \nMerit assumes that the wraith in question feels bound for some reason to pay back the boon, \nbe it through blackmail or just an unquiet conscience. \nMORTAL \nC O M p A N I O N ( a  T R A I T  MERIT) \nDespite death and the Fog, your character has managed to keep reasonably close ties \nwith a living person. This person may be a parapsychologist, a medium or just someone who \nhas a mutual tie to one of your character’s Fetters. This person is as helpful and sympathetic \nas a still-living person can be to a ghost, but she does have a life, and she won’t always be \nable to help out directly. Plus, a few episodes of Catharsis may make this acquaintance \nrethink the relationship. Still, if you exercise a few Arcanoi on this person’s behalf, you can \noften expect a good return in the living world. \nP S Y C H I C  ALLY(+ \nTRAIT M E ~ I T )  \nNot only is your character on decent terms with a mortal, but that mortal is a bona fide \nsensitive. The mortal can perceive ghostly visitations in some fashion, and he accepts the \nexistence of ghosts for exactly what it is. Your Storyteller must determine the full extent of \nthe mortal’s powers and motivations, as well as how that person manages to communicate \nwith the other side. Furthermore, some vindictive or desperate wraiths may try to steal away \nor hurt this link to the other side. (See Laws of the Hunt for some ideas about mortals with \npsychic powers and the ability to speak to the dead.) \nSUPERNATURAL \nME RIT SAND \nELAWS \nc ~ R ~ E ~ ( I - J  \nTRAIT P L A ~ )  \nSome awful bane afflicts your character, even beyond death. In certain circumstances, he \nmay find himself compelled to do terrible things, or perhaps some things just never go right. \nThe strength of the curse determines the value of this Flaw. For one Trait, perhaps one \nalways suffers dire consequences from betraying a confidence. For five Traits, maybe the \ncharacter is so cursed that he will wander the lands of the dead endlessly without surcease \nor rest, unable to ever Transcend or even make a modicum of success in his endeavors to \nprotect his Fetters or Passions. \nD A M N E D  ( I TRAIT BLAW) \nDespite being a believer in some mortal religion, your character has come to realize that \nthe endless Purgatory of the Shadowlands is just another torment and another lie in the \nchink of his former faith. Whenever your character enters a place sacred to his former \n\n\nreligion, you lose a Willpower Trait each minute due to the psychological stress. If he \ntouches an artifact of the faith (material or corporeal), he suffers a level of Corpus damage \nas his form sloughs off in agony of this existence. \nThe Storyteller should make sure that the player selects a religion that may actually \nappear in the course of the game. A Zoroastrian is unlikely to suffer much inconvenience \nfrom this Flaw in a modern urban setting. \n~ R p R o p e R L y  \nB U R I E D  ( I TRAIT ELAW) \nMany superstitions surround the practices of burial. By your character’s beliefs, he was \ninterred improperly. Perhaps he was buried without clothes, or maybe he needed to be buried \nin his family’s grave plot, but such was not to be the case. Whatever the case, he suffers \nextreme discomfort in the afterlife. This difficulty with his own corpse causes him to suffer \nby taking your own body as a Fetter (and not as a free one, either), but you gain no Trait \nbonuses when trying to resolve or affect it. Instead, you suffer a one-Trait resolution penalty \nwhen your character tries to affect his corpse. He might overcome this Flaw if someone \nfinally inters his body properly (and you spend two experience Traits). \nTH E BARD’S T o ~ g u c  \n( I  TRAIT \nELAW) \nTerrible truths come from your character’s lips, completely unbidden and without \nforewarning. It’s not that he sees the future; rather, things that he says have an uncanny way \nof coming true. \nOnce per game session, some uncomfortable truth will come out of your character’s \nmouth, and the dire predictions of this event are almost certain to pass. Should a Storyteller \nnote a particularly appropriate phrase, then when it has a chance of fulfillment, anyone \ntrying to resist it must make an automatic retest and take the worst result. Thus, such a \ncharacter might remarkoffhandedly, “Just what we need. What’s next, a batch of Spectres?” \nonly to hear cackling and howling a few minutes later. Perhaps he’ll note, “You’ll never be \nable to cross the Shroud like that,” and suddenly find that the player of the character to \nwhom he said it must retest his next attempt to use Embody. \nTIRE Crc~c(I-5 TRAIT \nELAW) \nYour character’s death is tied somehow to a repeating pattern of time. The Shroud’s \neffective rating is one to four Traits higher for you (equal to the value of the Flaw), except \nfor certain times when you can reach normally. If your character has a certain “hour of \ndeath” that works for her each day, this Flaw is worth its normal value. If she is limited to, \nsay, only one day a month, add one Trait to the Flaw’s value. You should tie this time to an \nactual event surrounding your character’s death. If she died at sea, she might only be able \nto affect the world at the hours around high and low tide. If she was killed on a Sunday, she \ncan only touch the world on Sundays. \nB C H O E S ( a - 5  TRAIT &AW) \nOld wives’ tales and superstitions about ghosts are true with respect to your character. \nWhen he’s around, animals react strongly; open flames seem to hypnotize him; running \nwater bars his passage, as does seasalt; his outline sometimes appears in fog. Sounds he makes \ncan be recorded on tape, and he might even leave bits of ectoplasm on things that he touches \nin the living lands. Your character can’t control this phenomenon; he just seems to reflect \nthe area residents’ beliefs regarding the behavior of ghosts naturally. \nThe value of this Flaw depends upon its severity. For two Traits, the character may just \nmake the occasional bump in the night or cold spot. For five Traits, he slimes everything \nhe touches, he causes animals to hiss and spit at him, and he can be driven out by exorcism \nrites and wards against the Evil Eye. \n\n\nLIMITED \nL I ~ E S I ~ H T ( ~  \nTRAIT PLAW) \nYour character has great difficulty seeing living things and their patterns. While most \nwraiths can sense the general patterns of emotion and life in people, you suffer a two-Trait \nresolution penalty in such challenges (Oblivion, p. 160). To your character, the living world \nis blurry and difficult to see, almost as if the shroud of death itself keeps him from tying back \ninto the brilliance of the living. \nLIMITED \nD F A T H S I ~ H T (  \na TRAIT PLAW) \nYour character’s ability to discern patterns of injury and decay is quite limited. Maybe \nshe rejects death so much that she can’t sense it in others, or perhaps it’s just not part ofher \nconception of ghostly power. For whatever reason, you suffer a two-Trait resolution penalty \nin all challenges with Deathsight (Oblivion, p. 160). \n~ o v N o ( 3  \nTRAIT  law) \nSome place or event holds such significance to your character that he can’t leave it. \nMaybe he can haunt only a house where he lived and died, or perhaps he haunts a particular \ntree. You cannot move more than 100 yards from this location, and you must take it as a \nFetter. \nNaturally, this Flaw can limit your story possibilities a great deal, so choose carefully! \nShould the character ever resolve this Fetter, you will be able to leave the area, thankfully. \nMost wraiths just have dark urges in their minds encouraging them to do nasty things. \nFor your wraith, though, those urges manifest in the form of asmall plasmic animal or object. \nIt can manifest at odd times, even moving around to interact with things as if it has one \nPhysical Trait. If it’s discorporated by force, the Shadow simply dissolves back into your \ncharacter’s head to torment him internally. (You can’t get away from it that easily!) While \nthe Shadow exists in this external form, you must speak aloud to address it. \nYou should carry a prop or card that represents this disembodied Shadow. From time \nto time, your Storyteller or Shadowguide may rule that it’s harassing someone or playing \naround with objects in the vicinity. \nDISEMBODIED \n! h A D O W ( 3  \nT R A I T  PLAW) \nU M B R A L  c O N N G C T I O N ( 3  T R A I T  PLAW) \nBy some quirk of chance, your character’s existence extends into the middle Umbra, \nthe mirror of the vibrant living lands. Although he cannot see or affect the Umbra, spirits \nthat wander there can see him as a pale shade. Werewolves or magicians can even use their \nmagical powers to affect such an unfortunate character, binding him or banishing him while \nhe remains unaware of what exactly is going on. \nDARE \ng A T E  (5 T R A I T  PLAW) \nYour character is doomed not only to an existence more horrid than this wraithly one, \nbut to a final end where all of his struggles come to naught. Worse still, he is aware of this \nfate through vague dreams, hunches or premonitions - \nor maybe just because some \nmalicious demon or Shadow told him about it. At some point, his struggles will end, and he \nwill go on to a fate more terrible than Oblivion, more repugnant than Spectrehood and more \ninevitable than death. Your Storyteller will design this final end, of which you may have \noccasional premonitions. \nU N K N O W N  d E T T E R ( 1 - 5  T R A I T  M E R I T )  \nSome connection ties your character to a place or object, but he has no idea what it is \nor why he’s connected. Certain Arcanoi might help one to identify this Fetter, but otherwise \nit’s a mystery. This Merit is actually quite handy, though, because nobody else is likely to \n\n\nknow of the Fetter either, and thus it’s not at great risk of destruction by enemies. Then \nagain, a wraith can’t protect a Fetter if he doesn’t know what it is. \nThe value of this Merit depends on the value and durability of the Fetter in question. \nIf the Fetter is unlikely to suffer from outside intervention, it costs more to be unknown. If \nneither your character nor his enemies ever discover it, it may exist forever! A Fetter that’s \nat risk of discovery or that is more easily disposable costs less. \nC O L D  ( B TRAIT MERIT) \nRemember those tales of ghosts causing “cold spots” in haunted areas! They’re true with \nyour character. When he walks through an area, the temperature drops noticeably in the \nliving lands. This drop can draw attention to the character’s presence, and it could even be \ntracked and measured with heat-sensing gear. On the other hand, most mortals will only \nshiver and try to get away. By applying the effects of this Merit carefully, a ghost can \nencourage people to leave a haunt or to pay attention to him, or even communicate crudely \nwith the living. (This cold spot is just a blob of low-temperature, though. The wraith with \nthis Merit does not appear as a ghostly silhouette if viewed through infrared goggles.) \n~ u c w ( 3  \nTRAIT MERIT) \nAll right, your character can’t be all that lucky - \nshe’s dead, after all -but \nFortune \ndoes seem to favor her. You have three Lucky Traits that you can use for retests on any \nchallenge. As usual, you can only use one such Trait on any given challenge. These Traits \nrefresh each game session. \nOTHER HALE (3 TRAIT MERIT) \nSome philosophers believe that each person is a half-soul, who can find completion \nonly by discovering its other half in another person. Well, your character did just that. This \nother half is just about anyone still living - \ncasual acquaintance, old friend, relative, \nwhatever - \nbut the depth of the connection is profound. Count this individual as one of \nyour wraith‘s Fetters (no, not as afree one). Whenever the character is near this individual \n(within, say, the same room), he regains one Corpus Trait per hour. Any bonuses that you’d \ngain for acting on the person are doubled, making it very easy for your character to attune \nthe individual and then use his Arcanoi on him. \nYou cannot take both this Merit and the Merit: True Love. \nB R I g H T ( 4  T R A I T  M E R I T )  \nEven the Shroud cannot staunch the intensity of your character’s drives. His desire to \nexist beyond life is so powerful that he practically radiates his emotions into the living lands. \n(Or, perhaps he doesn’t intend to do so, but for some reason, he finds that the Shroud doesn’t \nkeep him from interacting there.) You gain a one-Trait bonus to resolution of tests across \nthe Shroud, and any mortal who cares to interact with your character gains a similar one- \nTrait bonus on the test to notice him. Furthermore, all mortals gain a free retest against the \nFog when dealing with such a character. The emotions he generates are so intense that it \nimpresses him on their minds and memories. \nTRUE \nh V E ( 4  TRAIT \nM E R I T )  \nAt some point, in either life or death, your character found a true love. Memories of \nthis joy buoy him in difficult situations, and the thought of his love is enough to keep him \npressing on when the afterlife seems stacked against him. You gain a one-Trait bonus on all \nchallenges in which your character is acting to directly maintain his relationship with his \ntrue love (for as long as his true love reciprocates the feeling). \nYou cannot take both this Merit and the Merit: Other Half. \n\n\nYour character’s dark emotions have limited sway over him. Perhaps his superego is \nstronger than most, or maybe he’s just a naturally temperate soul. Your character’s Shadow \nmust win or tie a Simple Test to enter Catharsis after spending five Angst, and it gains Angst \nfrom Dark Passions only if it wins a Simple Test, rather than getting a retest on a tie (see \nOblivion, p. 170). \nTRUE \n~ A I T H  (7 TRAIT MERIT) \nI \nThe strength of your character’s religious convictions buoys her. She believes firmly \nthat some sentient power guides and watches over the cosmos. Although this existence may \nnot be the afterlife she was promised, her strength of character expresses itself in the \nunshakeable devotion to her principles. You receive the benefits of the Merit: Code of \nHonor, \nplus an added perk. Attempts to coerce your character to eschew or betray her code \nof honor - \nbe they supernatural or attempted Social Challenges based on your character’s \nNature -fail automatically. You may also make a Simple Test after using an Eidolon Trait \nto put down your character’s Shadow. If you win that test, you do not lose that Eidolon Trait \n(as you should, as per Oblivion p. 136). \n\n\nrUS \nKdge n g a u t x  Lhe Darkness; \nTempe, AZ \nKevin Lynch 11, \nCollin Toohey, \nKWLynch@aol.com \nSong of Sonora; Tucson, AZ \nCy bertec@cyberdude.com \n(520) 722-2688 \n(602) 942-4994 \nO T H E R S  ( U N S ~ E C I E I E D A N D  \nM I X E D  C ~ A M E S )  \nDark Carpathia, Portland, Maine \nMore Than Night: \nPortland, Oregon \nhttp://home.maine.rr.com/ \ndarkcarpathia/darkcarp.html \n(Independent game that some- \ntimes \nplaytests \nupcoming \nsupplements) \nEast of the River, Vernon, CT \nBruce Baugh, bruce-baugh@sff.net \nD.
