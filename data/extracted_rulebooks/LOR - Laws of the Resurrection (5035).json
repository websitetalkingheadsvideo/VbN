And Sherry always \nsaid yes, because it was better than going home to Mother, who would \ncomplain about being alone all day, but who refused to get a pet (smelly, \ndisease-carrying), or visit the community center (bunch of old people there), \nor get a job (her health was “poor”). So she stayed at work until her feet were \nthrobbing, waiting desperately for the last stragglers to get out so she could \nfinish the work that everyone else left behind. \nSherry checked her watch - \nthe last bus would be here in five minutes. \nThe street was deserted, so she decided to skip walking up to the crosswalk and \njust cross in front of the store. If she missed the bus, that would mean a very \nlong and scary walk home, and Mother complaining about her inconsiderate \nnature in not calling her if she was going to be late. She hiked her tote bag up \non her shoulder and stepped out into the street.. .. \nThe next thing she knew, there was silence. Nothing around her. No \ncars, no buses, no street noise. Just her and the wind. And a bird, sitting on \nthe broken thing lying in the gutter. \nSherry’s mind raced with confusion. She was dead? But it felt like- \nwhat? You couldn’t say that your heart was racing or anything like that, not \nwhen your physical body is roadkill. All she knew was that part of her was \nlying in the road, and somehow she was standing over her body, looking at the \ngrotesque angle of her neck and one arm, at her legs twisted the wrong way. \nAnd there was a bird sitting on her body. \nThe bird looked up at her, and then it spoke to her, “Hello. I’m glad I \ncaught you before you left. I was hoping to ask you something.” \nShe couldn’t think of a thing to say to that. The bird cocked its head and \ncontinued, “Don’t you want to know what it is?” \nSherry still couldn’t find her voice. All she could do was nod dumbly. \nThe bird went on, “If someone asked you what you did with your life, \nwhat would you say?” \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Is that how you want to leave your life - \nbarely lived, \nwithout pleasure or even a duty you wanted to attend to?” The bird-spirit \npaused to let her consider this, then it said, “What if you could have another \nchance, another life? What if you could go back?” \n“HOW can you promise that?” she whispered, watching helplessly as her \nbroken body was searched by two street thugs looking to steal anything worth \nhaving. They didn’t seem to notice the bird, nor did it notice them. \n“Let me stay with you, and I’ll show you how,” the bird said. \nSherry considered its words, especially “a duty you wanted to attend to.” \nWas there such a thing? She suddenly wanted to find out more. She \nsummoned every ounce of bravery and said, “All right. What do I do?” \nThe bird fluttered up and wrapped its wings around Sherry’s face, as if \nembracing her head, and she felt the presence of someone else in my mind. \nShe flinched and tried to shake it free, but the bird-spirit silenced her: This \nis the beginning of it. You have a journey to make now, one that will forge your body \nfor the work ahead. \n0.. \nWhen Sherry emerged on the other side, she was standing in a barren, \nashy landscape under a leaden sky. A river quietly meandered nearby, and a \ndark shrouded figure waited in a reed boat. It looked like all the pictures she’d \never seen of Charon on the River Styx. The new spirit her whispered that this \nwas an Aken- \none of the boatmen who guideed the dead in Duat, the \nUnderworld - \nand that she should go with him, that he understood where \nshe must go next. Sherry nervously approached the Aken and cleared her \nthroat. \nHe turned to her and removed his hood. She couldn’t guess how old he \nmight be -he had iron-gray hair cut in Roman fashion, and his skin looked \nleathery as if he’d been out in the desert sun for years. His eyes were deep and \nstern, but also kind. He helped her into the boat, then started poling along \nthe water. In the distance, she heard screeches, wails and strange noises that \nshe couldn’t identify. The strangeness of everything would overwhelm her, \nbut for the voice of the ba. This is Duat - \nyonder is the sound of the Dja-akh, \nthe great spirit-storm - \nyou must speak with the Judges of Ma’at before you can \nre turn. \nThe Aken spoke little during their travels, but he answered Sherry’s \nquestions when she had them. He told her about the ghost-storm, about the \nruinedcities theypassed. After a while, they pulled up to asandy shore. Sherry \nstarted to get up, then nearly choked when she saw what was approaching - \na man in a linen skirt and jeweled collar with the head of a black jackal. The \nspirit whispered quickly: Anubis, the guide of the dead. He’ll take us where we \nneed to go. \nAnubis was a silent guide across the cool sands toward the shadowy \nmonoliths in the distance, but Sherry wasn’t sure she wanted to know what his \nvoice might sound like.

The next destination is a long corridor into the \nearth, built with huge stone blocks. Down the hall was darkness, a pit of inky \nunknown waiting for her. Without waiting to see if she would follow, Anubis \nstarted forward, and she stumbled after him, right into the darkness. \nSuddenly, her guide was gone, and she was alone in the dark. The only \nlight came from a guttering torch nearby. Which way should she go? What \nwas she supposed to do? When faced with a situation she couldn’t fathom, her \ninstinct was always to stand still and wait for something to happen. But the \nspirit burning in her refused to let her be led by the hand: Don’t you want to \nknow what happens next? Don’t you want to know more? \nSherry took the torch from the wall and started down the corridor, the \ndarkness hemming her in on all sides, except for the light that encircled her. \nWhenever the fear started to overwhelm her, the spirit in her cajoled and \nberated her onward. Movement caught the comer of her eye. She turned and \nthe torchlight illuminated brilliant colors - \ncarnelian red, malachite green, \nlapis blue, gold leaf. There were figures of queens, pharaohs and gods made of \nthose colors. She recognized the figures of Isis and Osiris, and a great feeling \nof reverence washed over her. \nShe continued onward, but still watching the beautiful hieroglyphics \nunfold their story on the wall, telling the tale of Osiris and his treacherous \nbrother Set, of Isis hunting down her husband’s tom body to rebuild him, of \nthe warriors called the Shemsu-heru who were created to serve Horus and his \nfather. The hieroglyphics grew more familiar - \nshe realized she could even \nread some of it, or perhaps the spirit was translating for her. The story was \nabout a temple dancer, called Tia bint-Sef. She was the daughter of a pharaoh \nand a concubine. She could never be a princess because of her birth, so she \nwas consecrated to the gods. She learned the sacred dances of the temples and \nthe not-so-sacred dances of the court, and in all her ways, she was considered \nbeautiful. She was loved by many because she listened to those who came to \nher with grief and worries, and by her listening and comfort, she took their \nburdens onto herself. Even her father loved her for her listening ways and for \nher dancing soul when his spirit was tired. When Tia died, her father had her \nmummified and placed in his own tomb with goods and companions to \ncomfort her until he came. \nSherry paused for a moment to study the story -her \nown, she realized \n- \nand heard strange music from further down the corridor. It sounded \nwonderful - \nin a primitive sort of way - \nand she hurried ahead to see what \nshe would find. There was a tableau in one of the chambers, as if a show was \nbeing set. Sherry stared, then blushed and started to turn away, but the spirit \nbecame forceful and made her turn back. This is your past, your First Life! This \nis where you came from. This is who we are. Her guide would not let her shrink \nuntil she looked fully upon this now-shared past.. \nThe scene was of cool marble floors and alabaster walls, the drifting scent \nof perfumes, and fine linen hangings. There was a party of men and women, \nmost wearing close to nothing because their linen clothes were nearly \ntransparent. Many wore thick black wigs and golden jewelry.

She danced to music \nthat sounded vaguely familiar. It was plucked strings, drums, sistrums and \nflutes. No one from the group could take their eyes from her. Her body was \nstrong and beautiful. Sherry wondered, Was I really like this? The only answer \ncould be yes. The strange ache grew more powerful, and tears came to her eyes. \nHer guide asked what was wrong and suddenly, without thinking what it \nmight say, she blurted, “I want to be that! I want to be strong and beautiful \nand not afraid of anything!” \nPerhups you will be, when we finish our journey. \nSherry finally emerged from the darkness of the tunnel to find Anubis \nwaiting for her. He said nothing, but led her toward another chamber. The \nspirit told her this was where they would meet theJudges of Ma’at, where they \nwould decide if the match of Tia and Sherry was right and whether she could \nreturn. The torch was taken from her, and she stepped into a vast hall. She \nwas aware of many eyes on her. She felt compelled to look up, and she was \nstruck by their facial expressions - \nstern and cold, but fair. Most looked \nhuman. The rest were like nothing she had ever seen - \na synthesis of animal \nand man and history that the scribes of ancient Egypt could have never \nimagined. \nSherry didn’t remember everything they said, but she could not forget \nthat they pointed out every sin she had ever committed until she wanted to \ncrawl into the sand and die. Worst of all, they said, was that she lived in \nconstant fear of rules and “authorities” who were neither gods nor kings, but \nwho held the same sort of power over her. She had no defense. She knew she \nhad did wrong in their eyes. But then a kinder judge spoke. The match \nbetween the spirit and her was agood one. It had the potential to be more than \njust a return to life, but a return to something better. That judge thought that \nshe could be more if she just understood what she never had. \nThe final judgment was made: “Tia bint-Sef, you are thereby judged fit \ntoreturn to the living world to seek that which youshrankfrom in yourwasted \ntime. Relearn your passions, seek out new vistas of thought, and in doing so, \nserve Ma’at by bringing your passion to a world hungry for just that.” \nSherry couldn’t remember how she returned to the living world - \nsomething about Anubis taking her out of the judges’ presence and pointing \ntoward a bright spot on the horizon, and- \nSuddnely, she awoke, swaddled in scented bandages that covered her \nface. She tried to tear at them with hands as bundled as mittens, and there was \na flurry of voices. Someone restrained her while a man’s voice soothed her, \n“Easy now. We’ll have these off you in a moment.” \nAnd with a click of scissors, the bandages fell away from her body, and \nsuddenly Sherry was staring into the faces of a group of people who were \nwearing linen robes like the priests and nobles of her first memories. An old \nman with a shaved head smiled at her and made a gesture of greeting. \n“Welcome back, daughter of Isis.” \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "ONCE UPON A TI E... \nOnce upon a time, long before television, computers or even books, \npeople sat around the fire and told stories for entertainment. Whether it was \na ballad of a hero’s latest exploits or a cautionary tale about dealing with the \nhidden creatures of the world, storytellers were a valued part of the community \nas teachers and entertainers. And tale-telling was hardly a passive art - \nthe \nstoryteller relied on his audience for reactions to his tale as he spoke. How else \nwould he know if they were enjoying the story, or if they were bored? \nTime marches on, and technological developments began to change, \nand interfere with, the storyteller’s art. Books (and the spread of literacy) \nmeant that someone could simply read a story whenever he liked, instead of \nhunting down a storyteller to tell it. Radio and TV remade the storyteller into \nan impassive creature that did not encourage audience participation or \nfeedback. Stories were still told, and in great quantity, but they were largely \nsterile, nonliving things. \nThen we come to the 1970s, and the era of roleplaying. A group of players \nsits around a table, listening to their leader describe scenes of dank dungeons \nand dark cities, and they choose which path to take next. At one of these \nsessions, someone gets the idea to start standing up, moving and thinking as \nhis character might. Over time, more players do the same, creating what will \nbecome known as live-action roleplaying (or LARP). In fact, this “new” \nentertainment was a return to the oldest - \nthe leader was the storyteller, \ntaking his listeners on a new journey. And the listeners responded in kind by \ntaking on the roles of the characters in the story and by telling this new tale \nto the storyteller, the other player-listeners and themselves. \nWHAT IS MIND’S EYE THEATRE? \nThis game is probably unlike anything you have played before. In many \nways, it’s not really a game, because it doesn’t have the usual trappings of \ngames - \nsuch as cards, dice or a playing board. It’s also far more concerned \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "with the stories told along the way than with “winning.” It’s far more like \nchildhood make-believe than what most people typically think of when they \nimagine “games.” This book contains all the information you’ll need to start \nplaying and telling your own stories. You create the action, you choose the \npath to follow, and you decide what risks to accept. We call this style of game \nMind’s Eye Theatre. \nPlaying Mind’s Eye Theatre is like being in a movie. You and your \nfriends are the characters, but there is no script. There may be a framework \nor setting that determines the parameters of the world around you, but you \nand the other players create the story as you play. The “director” of this movie \nis the Storyteller, assisted by Narrators. The Storyteller creates the stage and \nthe minor characters that the players interact with to tell this story. \nMost scenes in Mind’s Eye Theatre are played out in real time- an hour \nin make-believe world is 60 minutes long, and it takes up 60 minutes in the \nreal world. Players always remain in character during the game unless there \nis a rules dispute. \nCHARACTERS \nWhen you play Mind’s Eye Theatre, you take on another persona (here \na human who has joined with an ancient Egyptian soul and received the gift \nof immortality). Your character can be almost anything - \nfrom any walk of \nlife, age, creed, race or sex. The only limit is your imagination. When you \ncreate this character, you decide what she says or does. You decide where she \ngoes and what choices she makes. During the game, you speak as your \ncharacter, unless you’re resolving a rules dispute or talking to the Storyteller. \nBecause most of what a Mind’s Eye Theatre player perceives around him \ndepends on the other players, all players should be vivid and expressive. \nWhile the characters may direct the plot through their actions, the plot \nreacts in ways that direct the characters. For example, a character decides he \nwants to buy a coffeehouse with space for people to perform, and he invites \na well-known local group to perform for an evening. Here the characters are \ndirecting the plot through their actions. However, the plot reacts to this \ndirection. The Storyteller tells the characters that the performance has \naroused some suspicious attention. It seems that one of the performers \nreminds a character of a singer who was supposed to have died two years ago. \nThus is a story built in Mind’s Eye Theatre. \nCreating a character for Laws of the Resurrection is easy, and it takes \njust a few minutes. Only a few steps are necessary to define the basic \ncapabilities of a character, and once they’re done, you can start playing. \nThere’s another phase to creating a character, though. A character is, by and \nlarge, like a person, and people aren’t just flat cardboard cutouts with a few \nnumbers to represent what they can do. People have pasts, likes and dislikes, \ngoals and dreams - \nall the intangible things that make a person into what \nother people see when he walks into a room or talks to them. It’s not much \ndifferent from all the care that an actor or author takes when creating a \ncharacter. So as you’re creating your character, think a little about where she \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "comes from, what she wants out of her existence, wha \nshe loves and hates. Does your character love thunderstorms and watch them \nfrom the window, or have they frightened him ever since he was a child? Does \nyour character want revenge on the person who killed a loved one, and will \nhe bargain with the Devil himself to get it? While certain personality quirks \nand details emerge as you play, it’s a good idea to have the basics in place for \nthe first time you walk into a room and meet the other characters. \nCharacters are the heart and soul of the story. Without them, all the \nefforts of the Storyteller would be for nothing, and there would be no stories \nto tell. \nTHE STORYTELLER \nThe Storyteller is the one who creates the world that the players move \nthrough. She creates a skeletal framework of setting and plot, then turns the \ncharacters loose to put flesh on its bones. More than that, she acts as an \nimpartial judge when the rules are questioned, describes scenes that can’t be \nstaged and even plays the parts of antagonists or other people with whom the \ncharacters interact. The Storyteller is usually assisted by Narrators, who play \ntheir own characters but are ready to answer rules questions when necessary. \nStorytelling is a demanding (and occasionally exhausting) task. He must \noversee the events to be certain that people have a good time, that the rules \nare being followed, and that the story is running smoothly. Sometimes she \nmust create plot elements on the spur of the moment or adjudicate between \nseveral quarreling players. In spite of all of this responsibility, it is immensely \nsatisfying watching the players create something remarkable with the plot \nelements given to them. It makes the headaches worthwhile. \nELEGANTLY SIMPLE \nThis game was designed to be easy to play, and easier to start. As said, \ncharacter creation takes only a few minutes. The basic rules are simple, and \nthey cover most of the encounters that a new player will enter. Even very new \nplayers who have never played Mind’s Eye Theatre or LARP before will find \nthat it takes little effort to pick up. \nThis game is based on the tabletop book Mummy: The Resurrection. It \nis not necessary to own Mummy to play this game, but you may find some \nhelpful source material within. \nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK \nThis book gives you all the basic rules that you’ll need to start playing or \nChapter One: Introduction-The \nintroduction toMind’s Eye Theatre, \nChapter Two: The Amenti -Describes the various mummies basedon \nStorytelling mortals in the World of Darkness. \nthe World of Darkness and the world that the Reborn inhabit. \nthe piece of soul that joins with their own. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

These keep everyone - \nother players, law enforcement, curious \nonlookers and you -safe \nand happy with the game. They’re not intended to \nlimit fun, only to ensure that everyone plays safely and has a good time. \nNO TOUCHING \nThat means none. Even when everyone’s being careful, accidents can \nhappen. \nNO STUNTS \nNo climbing, running, jumping or other dangerous stunts during a game. \nLet the rules cover actions like jumping from rooftops and the like. If you can \nimagine you’re the reincarnation of an Egyptian queen, you can surely \nimagine you’re swinging from a chandelier. \nNO WEAPONS \nThat means none whatsoever, not even as props. Even obviously fake or \nsilly toy weapons can look like the real thing in dim lighting and might give \nthe wrong impression about the game. Use item cards instead. \nNO DRINKING OR DRUGS \nDuh. Drugs and alcohol do not create peak performance. A player who’s \ndrunk or stoned is a danger to others and the game. There’s nothing wrong \nwith playing a character who is drunk or stoned, but bringing the real thing \nto a game is a poor choice. At best, it’s unfitting; at worst, it’s illegal and a \nsafety issue. Just say no. \nBE MINDFUL OF OTHERS \nThis one has become very important in the past couple of years. Always \nremember, especially if you play in a public place, that not everyone around \nyou is involved in the game.

If a curious bystander \nfrom outside the game asks what’s going on, drop out of character and explain \npolitely. \nTHE RULES ARE FLEXIBLE \nWe at White Wolf call this “the golden rule.” If there’s some ruling \nherein (other than these listed here) that doesn’t work for your group, then \nby all means change it if it will mean a smoother game. Just be consistent and \nfair - \nrulings that change weekly, or that result in no-win situations, upset \nthe fun. \nIT’S ONLY A GAME \nIf a rival wins, if a plot falls apart, if a character dies - \nit’s only a game. \nAt the end of the day, it’s still a game that is played to have fun. Don’t spoil \nit for others by taking it too seriously. Leave the game behind when it ends. \nPlaying Mind’s Eye Theatre is entertainment, and getting together with \nother players afterward to discuss the night’s events is great, but demanding \na meeting with Anubis when the Storyteller is studying for exams signals the \nneed for some downtime. \nAGAIN. HAVE FUN \nNot “Win.” Not “Go out and kill everything else.” Just have fun. The \ngoal of Mind’s Eye Theatre is to tell stories about the hero’s journey and what \nhappens along the way. \nTHE WORLD OF DARKNESS \nOn the surface, the World of Darkness doesn’t seem that different from \nour own. People are born, grow up, work and die every day. Plants and \nskyscrapers compete for space. The same newspapers are sold on the comer, \nand television is the same vast wasteland. But there is something else in the \nWorld of Darkness - \nan element fed from the violence and despair that \npermeates the world. This element is what the monsters feed on, and the \nmonsters are all too real. \nThe World of Darkness is not simply our own with a coating of black \npaint and some random monsters stirred in. It is a world that has become too \nbeaten down by violence, coarseness, social ills and emotional pain to rouse \nitself. The gulf between the haves and the have-nots is great and widens daily. \nHope and compassion are all too rare, but all the more precious for their \nscarcity.

      "text": "IN THE SHADOW OF THE SPHINX \nWhen one hears the word “mummy,” images of shuffling, bandaged \ncorpses from old movies comes to mind. In the world of Laws of the \nResurrection, such beings exist, but they are the products of corruption or \nfailure. The mummies of Resurrection are creatures of flesh and blood who \nare perhaps even more alive than some humans. They breathe the same air, \neat the same foods and see the same sights, but it is all more sensational and \nmagnificent as they have tasted death and been granted life once again. \nMummies are immortal, but not in the sense of the divine immortality of the \ngods. A mummy can die, but he will journey the Underworld and later return \nto life, ready to resume his goals and duties. \nFor thousands of years, the Nile has cast its irresistible spell over the \nyoungest of the children of the world. From its mighty source (not far from the \nearliest scientific evidence of Man at Olduvai) to its outlet (near the deserts \nwhere the prophets of old walked), the valley of the eternal river has been \nMankind’s greatest cradle. It gives life to our dreams. Now the children of the \nNile return from darkness, finally ready to answer the Sphinx’s riddle. \nOsiris, one of the oldest and greatest of the Egyptian gods, has long \nreigned in the Lands of the Dead. A recent cataclysm in the Underworld has \nroused Osiris from his seeming slumber to take an active hand in the living \nworld once again. The agents of this ancient power are themselves things of \nlegend. They are deathless beings who defy the grasp of mortality. They are \nmummies. \nMUMMIES \nAncient Egyptians perfected the art of preserving the bodies of the dead \nto maintain them for the afterlife. After death, the individual’s soul passed \ninto Duat, the Egyptian Underworld. There, in the spirit city of Amenti, \nOsiris ruled over the dead. The god Anubis acted as psychopomp, guiding new \narrivals before the judges of the afterlife so that they could determine the \nspirit’s reward for its life. \nBeyond this point, two schools of thought prevailed: Some believed that \nthe corpse must remain inviolate so that it could sustain the soul in the \nafterlife, while others proclaimed that it would serve as a receptacle for the \nreturning soul. As time passed and few people ever witnessed a corpse actively \nrise to life, the first view became dominant. The afterlife was a reflection of \nthis world, only perfected, and a person’s place in that realm was determined \nby his proper adherence to Ma’at and the care with which he was interred. \nThis viewpoint led to elaborate practices by the powerful. Pharaohs and \nwealthy men were entombed with jewels and riches. Some were even \naccompanied by their mummified wives, children or servants. Armies of \nwooden ushabti statues stood ready to answer the summons to labor in the \nafterlife on their master’s behalf. Some notables were even buried with intact \nships and chariots, or entourages of mummified crocodiles, ibis or other \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "animals. A culture that believed you could take it with you flourished for \nthousands of years. \nIronically, their beliefs were a pale reflection of the practices of the \ngodlike beings who ruled them in the flesh during pre-dynastic times, but they \nwere viewed as intangible forces and as legend in later times. When \nincorporated with the mummification ceremony, the Spell of Life used by the \ngoddess Isis to resurrect her brother-husband Osiris created an eternal link \nbetween soul and corpse. Through this ritual, both forms of immortality came \nabout in one being. A recipient of the spell could travel the realms of the \nUnderworld and revel in the afterlife, and then return to life in the physical \nrealm. Osiris and his followers were truly masters of life and death. \nAlthough those blessed by the cult that served Isis and Osiris still \nventured into the Underworld upon their death, they could now return across \nthe Shroud, the spirit veil that divided the living and spirit worlds, infusing \ntheir dead flesh with life again. Months (even years) might pass, but amummy \nwho gave proper service in the Underworld could always eventually return to \nlife, no matter how many times he was slain. \nThe ancient mummies were made imperfectly, however, and could never \ncompletely escape the Shadowlands. They were missing an essential quality. \nThough their flesh was warm and their hearts beat, they could not pass on the \ngift of life. No children could come of their unions, and their spirits rested too \nlightly in their bodies. Mystics found their blood strangely lacking in life- \nforce and their auras flawed. Due to the power of the ritual, the followers of \nIsis and Osiris performed the resurrection ceremony on only a small number \nof their members. Nonetheless, an undying breed is a force to be reckoned \nwith, no matter how small their numbers. Osiris’ son Horus led most of the \nimmortal mummies in an effort to cleanse the world of his father’s murderous \nbrother Set and the venomous children of the dark god. Constantly beleaguered \nby the forces of the serpent, the faithful Shemsu-hem, or Followers of Horus, \nreturned again and again to stand against Set’s evil. \nEven the eternal Shemsu-heru could not withstand the fury of the Dja- \nakh, the great spirit storm, and most perished in its devastating wake. \nWithout the wisdom of the god of the Resurrection, all might have been lost. \nAMENT1 \nIn the aftermath of the spirit storm, the old Spell of Life has lost its \npotency. Whether Osiris simply stopped empowering its flawed form or some \nshift in the nature of spirits occurred due to the Dja-akh, the ritual no longer \nworks. Osiris prepared cults throughout the Middle East who followed his \nteachings for the disastrous storm. Priests and priestesses learned the new \nSpell of Life, created during Osiris’ centuries beyond the Shroud and with the \ninsight he gained into the bond between spirit and flesh. When the shattered \nsouls of the city of Amenti began to arrive in the Lands of Faith, bearing the \nravaged bodies of a new age, the priesthood of the god of the Resurrection \nawaited them. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "flows as strong as ;he Nile. Part of the spell’s strength comes from the new \nmanner in which the Reborn (as mummies are also called) are created. Those \nresurrected in the wake of the Dja-akh are not simply souls tied to their \ncorpses forever; the new mummies are products of a union of one of the storm- \nshattered souls from Amenti and of the flawed soul of a mortal who has died \nrecently. Only the strongest shards of the souls of the ancient Egyptian dead \nwere able to survive the Maelstrom’s savage winds. At Osiris’ behest, the \nremnants of these ancient spirits - \nincluding some old mummies whose souls \nwere fractured by the howling soul tide of the Dja-akh- are spreading across \nthe world seeking those whose weaknesses need their strength. They solicit \na bond with individuals whom they can complete and complement. \nFrom the perspective of those in the Underworld, a person who is soon \nto meet with death evinces a mark or sign shortly before his end in the physical \nworld. Spirits call these prophetic markings “Deathmarks.” When an Amenti \nspirit finds a compatible individual bearing the spiritual Deathmarks, the \ntattered entity waits nearby in the tumultuous ghost world. At the moment \nof death, the Amenti spirit fragment reveals itself to the newly deceased and \noffers to restore her to life. Should she agree, the shard of the Egyptian soul \nanimates the individual’s dying form with just enough life energy to make a \ndesperate pilgrimage, or hajj. The spirit’s goal is the Web of Faith, a network \nof holy sites scattered across northem Africa to the Middle East infused with \nthe life-force of Osiris himself. It is a life-force that is vital to the resurrection \nceremony. \nIn the Lands of Faith, the priests and priestesses of Isis and Osiris await \nthe joined spirits, and their sacred magic calls to the returning dead. Once the \nanimated corpse is taken in at one of the secret sites, the beloved of Isis and \nOsiris perform the divine ritual of resurrection. \nWhile exact practices of the ritual of rebirth vary from cult to cult, the \nkey elements remain the same. The body is soaked in natron (a salt mixture \ncommon to the Egyptian embalming process) and wrapped in protective \nbandages that have been inscribed with spells. As long as the ritual is \nperformed within the Web of Faith, the deceased is flooded with a surge of \nlife-force. The power of Osiris flows into the corpse, burning away the weak \nportions of its soul. The fragment of the ancient Egyptian soul replaces the \nflawed or impure portion of the modem soul, and it is called a tem-akh, or \n“completing spirit.” The new soul joins seamlessly with the old. The hybrid \nis then led by Anubis to face the Judges ofMa’at. Afterreceiving the judgment \nof this spiritual group, the newly empowered soul merges once more with its \nbody and returns to Life. \nThe resurrected individual - \nreferred to formally as an Amenti, in honor \nof the lost city of the Dead from whence the soul fragments come-may \nundergo small changes as the body adjusts to its new, more powerful life force, \nalthough these alterations tend to be subtle ones. The most significant \nchanges that the Spell of Life brings are usually clear. The recipient has come \nback to life, and the weakest portion of her soul has been replaced with the \npowerful tern-akh. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "SOUL SHARDS \nTo understand the nature of the Amenti, one must recognize the \nEgyptian concept that nine parts represent an individual's entire essence. A \nperson's true name, or ren, is an inherent part of her being, and it may even \nbe used to gain power over her. The heart, or ab, is the center of consciousness. \nThe body, known as the khat, is necessary for the mummy's eventual \nresurrection. The remaining portions that comprise an individual are spiritual. \nSpiritual energy called Sekhem - \nsimilar to the notion of life-force - \nflows through the soul and body. The ren, ab and Sekhem reside within and \ndefine the body and soul alike. The khat stays in the physical realm. The \nremaining five aspects of an individual's essence exist within the person's \nkhat, but pass from the corporal world upon the person's death. \nThe ancient Egyptians recognized five soul aspects for each person. The \nka kept careful watch over the body during death, protecting it from harm. \nThe ba traveled into the spirit realms and returned only to help complete the \nRebirth. The khaibit embodied the soul's darkness, aggression and hunger. \nThe sahu was the eternal, incorruptible portion of the soul that dwelled in the \nEgyptian paradise known as A'aru. The khu surrounded the body and soul like \na protective spiritual aura. \nUnfortunately for those Egyptian spirits in Duat, they were vulnerable to \nthe Dja-akh that swept through the Underworld at the end of the millennium. \nThe storm's spiritual devastation destroyed weaker vital essences. Only the \nstrongest soul aspects survived. Few spirits of the Underworld city of Amenti \nsurvived in their entirety. Virtually every soul was shattered and left incomplete. \nThese spirit remnants lost the remaining portions of their greater soul and \ndrifted alone. Any chance the spirit pieces had to ever again join in life was \nlost to the spirit storm's rage. Without the other aspects of the soul, \nresurrection was forever denied to them. That is, until Osiris revealed his plan \nto them. \nTHEHOLY LAND \nThe lands of the Arabian peninsula and northern Africa have long been \nknown as the cradle of civilization. The three great monotheistic religions \nwere born in the Middle East, and their influence is certainly felt around the \nworld. But the ancient homeland of Mankind teems with bloodshed, chaos \nand violence as though some invisible force was at work. In the Near-Eastem \nWorld of Darkness, those who seek the unseen adversaries of Mankind find \nthem all too eager to snatch the unwary away. \nOn the surface level, the Holy Land appears little different to the \nsupernatural denizens of the World of Darkness than it does to the mortals \nwho walk among them. The same ancient buildings crowd the same dusty \nstreets and shelter everyone from the fury of the noonday sun. Countries' \nborders stand in eternal states of tension, where border guards watch constantly \nfor the next terrorist carrying a bomb or gun in his clothes. Suspicion, fear and \nhatred tear at the fabric of the divine kingdoms on earth, and every day \nanother soul is lost to bigotry and demonizing dogmatism. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Islamic texts \nspeak of the djinn, beings created by God before the coming of Man.

In fact, ancient \nEgyptian tales tell of spiritual beings stepping from the fires of fallen stars with \nflesh of iron. But for all their power and majesty, the creator would seem to \nhave some purpose for Mankind that puts djinn below humans. Djinn do not \npossess souls and are bound by convoluted codes known as the Laws of \nSolomon. \nA few inspired mystics of the World of Darkness believe that those who \nare slain and rise as vampires are actually reanimated by the bestial spirit of \na lesser djinn known as a ghul, which flows into the body along with tainted \nblood and inspires an unholy hunger. The same scholars say that the \nshapeshifters and faeries of legend are forms of djinn. Tales of King Solomon \ntrapping thousands of djinn within various magical vessels continue to inspire \ntales of wonder. Sorcerers sometimes seek to follow in the Biblical king’s \nfootsteps by binding the djinn to perform great tasks. The dead pass into the \nUnderworld and encounter angels and demons matching almost every legend \nawaiting them with wisdom and justice. It seems that we fascinate and \nempower the djinn every bit as much as they do us, our cycles tied together \nby the unseen hand of an unknowable purpose. \nNAMING THE GODS \nThe choice between complete accuracy and use of familiar terms can \nsometimes be a difficult one. Since we are telling stories instead of writing \nscientific treatises, the decision is easier.

Upper and Lower \nEgypt were combined into one kingdom by the legendary pharaoh Menes and \ncalled the Two Lands. The Two Lands also found expression in the Black \nLands (or Khem, so called for the life-giving dark silt of the Nile River) and \nthe Red Lands, or the inhospitable desert. The most important recognition \nof the Two Lands, however, was the understanding that Duat, or the \nUnderworld, mirrored the material world. Everything in creation had a \nspiritual double. Although this spirit world and its doubles were invisible to \nmortal eyes, talented magicians could glimpse it, and everyone knew that \nthey would enter it upon death. \nDuat is a confusing place to the mortal mind, containing such diverse \nrealms as the paradise of A’aru, called the Field of Reeds; the Halls of Ma’at, \nwhere the dead were judged; and the pits of Apophis, where the Devourer \nlurks hoping to forever swallow the sun god Ra.

In the eldest days, the Two Lands were not as one, \nor even as two. The beasts ruled the earth, from the crocodile that was the \ndemon of the river, to the scorpion that was the poison of the desert, to the \nlion that was the king of the grasslands. The children of the earth, Sibu-Gabu, \nhad lived according to Amon’s law, beneath the gaze of their sky-mother Nuit \nfor ages untold before the coming of Man. But the hidden will of Amon had \nyet to be revealed, and the Modeler formed humanity from the flesh of Sibu- \nGabu and the spirit of Nuit, and set the new life on the Earth. Amon, who is \nhidden, watched with dismay as the serpent Apophis sought to devour the \nsun, and Man chose to live as a beast, grazing upon the green mantle of Sibu- \nGabu and hunting the flesh of other creatures. Apophis devoured the hearts \nof men, sometimes before they even passed from the earth, and its hunger \ninfected their souls such that they began to feed upon each other. \nAlarmed by Apophis, the heavens and earth acted as one. The sun \npeeked above the horizon at the same moment the Nile’s annual flooding, the \nInundation, began, and the star Sothis (later called Sirius) also rose into the \nsky. This rare event occurs only once every 1,461 years, and marks the \nbeginning of a period of time known as the Sothic cycle. This time, reputedly \nin the year 4240 BCE, marked the arrival to earth of four of the divine \ndescendants of the creator. Osiris, his brother Set and their sisters, Isis and \nNephthys, brought peace and law to Mankind. Osiris ended cannibalism and \nchaos and ruled over the people as the First Pharaoh. His rule constituted a \nbenevolent dictatorship, with the words of the gods heard directly by the \npeople and justice coming from divine wisdom and balance. The lands along \nthe Nile grew prosperous, and the Nagada tribes spread along its length \njoyfully bearing news of the creator and his children on earth. \nAlas, paradise on earth could not last. The serpent Apophis wormed his \nway into Set’s heart, and the younger brother rose up against his elder sibling. \nHe hungered for power and glory, desiring to be worshipped above all else. \nJealousy seethed inside Set, and he turned many of the people against the First \nPharaoh. The fight was fierce, for its leaders were gods, with Set’s warriors \nfighting for promises of wealth and Osiris’ defenders protecting the rightful \npharaoh. Ultimately, Set was defeated, but the lands that would become \nEgypt had been irreparably divided. Osiris was merciful and banished his \nbrother and enemies to the desert. \nDuring Set’s absence, a strange being called Typhon visited Osiris and \nproclaimed that his kingdom would be overcome by demons that drank \nblood. He offered the Lord of Life the power of death, with the promise that \nits might would let him save his domain. The pale one tried to beguile the First \nPharaoh with tales of the princes of darkness that ruled the world outside of \nEgypt, and Osiris’ own divinations foretold his death. The god listened to his \naccursed guest, who was one of the terrible dead that Arabs would later call \nghuk.

He had \nchanged into a terrible unliving state through gorging on the dark blood of \nApophis. Once again, Set sought to usurp the rule of Khem. The resulting \nstruggle has become the stuff of legend. Set cleverly had his supporters present \nOsiris with a magnificent coffin in which he might rest in the event of his \ndeath.

As the Resurrected \nlearn the depth of their purpose in creation and abide by it, their talent \nnaturally grows. Yet the ancient spirits’ pursuits of separate goals created an \ninherent focus. Difficulty acting outside their spiritual roles is the proper \nbalance to the power they gained by properly following their mythic purpose. \nThe Amenti do not organize themselves automatically according to their \ntern-akh. After all, it’s not like you can just look at another Amenti and know \nwhat sort of spirit brought about his Resurrection. Some Amenti have never \neven encountered another mummy before. Nonetheless, because of common \nbehaviors displayed by certain tem-akh, there are some generalizations that \ncan be applied. \nTHE EM-AKH \nKher-minu, the Tomb Watchers: The ka is that part of the soul the \nEgyptians envisioned as remaining in the vicinity of the khat in order to \nprotect it until the resurrection. Those who become Kher-minu become \nprotectors, beginning first with their own bodies and expanding their duties \nto the rest of the world. They specialize in Amulet magic due to its protective \nmight, and they shun harmful vices. \nKhri-habi, the Scroll-bearers: The ba appears in Egyptian art as a bird \nwith a human head. Its reputed role was to travel about performing the various \nduties in the afterlife that ensured the resurrection of the body. Scroll-bearers \nare potent healers. They learn Alchemy as they dream of purifying the entire \nworld in order to heal its wounds. \nMesektet, the Night Suns: The sahu portion of the soul is the part the \nEgyptians viewed as the incorruptible and everlasting essence that passed \nonwards to the heavens to reside with the gods. Returned from heaven, these \nsouls wield Celestial magic, which lets them see the future and call upon the \npower of earth and sky. \nSakhmu, the Spirit Scepters: The khu was an Egyptian concept that \nimagined a part of the soul as an intangible covering over the body. This \nshining essence stands as the inspirational gateway between the physical and \nspiritual realm. Sakhmu learn potent Effigy magic, allowing their inner light \nto empower their artistic creations to change the world (whether earthly or \nDuat) . \nSefekhi, the Unbandaged Ones: The khaibit is that part of the Egyptian \nbeing pictured as the shadow of the animating essence.

Not every soul that remained within the \ncity of Osiris in the Underworld is fit in the eyes of Ma'at, nor is every mortal. \nThe Judged Ones are those souls given a second chance, yet are left \nincomplete due to the amputation of their corrupted spirit. They seek new \npurpose, while being keenly aware of the suffering caused by Apophis. \nTHE FACTIONS \nThe organizations to which the Amenti gravitate tend to be religious, \neconomic, or social groups. The special circumstances and history of the \nResurrected have resulted in the formation of factions that pursue particular \ngoals as a team. \nCULT OF ISIS \nFrom the day of her descent to earth, the goddess Isis served as a mother \nmodel for Mankind. Her experience as mother, sister, magician and preserver \nof her husband in death gifted her with great patience and made her beloved \nby the populace. Before she departed the earth - \neither ascending to live \nwith the sky gods, or choosing to die to be with her husband, whatever the \nbelief may be - \nshe imparted her wisdom to her worshippers. The most \nfaithful of these adherents kept alive the faith in Egyptian gods. They \nprotected and served her immortal son Horus and withstood the ravenous \ndepredations of the servants of Set. \nAs centuries passed, faith was diluted, wisdom faded, and the Cult of Isis \nfell into disarray. The usurper, Set, nearly destroyed the cult in the time of \nCleopatra and stole the precious Spell of Life from them. The Cult barely \nsurvived, but was distrusted by the same mummies they once created. Cult \nleaders despaired, and turned to the gods of conquerors or the service of Set. \nAs the years passed, memories of the goddess became clouded and obscured. \nIn the last decade of the 20th century, the Cult of Isis suddenly became \nactive again, though torn by the millennia of division into splinter faiths. \nSome began to seek out the ancient mummies still loyal to Horus in a \ndesperate effort to return them to life, while others tried to revive the use of \nthe lost Spell of Life. Studies of Egyptology reached levels not seen since the \nbeginning of the century. \nToward the end of the decade, more attuned cult members moved to the \nMiddle East and started to gather together the lost fragments of the Spell of \nLife and various artifacts buried in the sand. As the Amenti began their \ninexorable pilgrimage home, the Cult of Isis waited to resume the role of the \nancient mother goddess.

When Osiris descended to the \nearth, he proclaimed the end of cannibalism. A wise ghul named Khetamon \nturned from the path of darkness and went to speak to the god. Osiris looked \ninto his heart and saw that he truly wished to cease feasting upon the living \nbut could not. The First Pharaoh blessed the repentant Khetamon and taught \nhim to fight against the corruption that lurked within his spirit. The eldest \nChildren say that the god let Khetamon drink his blood for purification. The \nmerciful actions of the god-king brought more of the blood demons of Khem \nout of hiding and into holy practices bent upon their redemption. As the strict \nreligious discipline and deep philosophical teachings of the god gave them \nnew meaning, the dead ones began to call themselves the Children of Osiris. \nWhen Osiris was slain, Khetamon acted as the cult’s leader for centuries \nbefore Set’s followers slew him as well. The Children continued their search \nfor inner peace. \nWhen Osiris entered the Web of Faith, the faithful and faithless alike \ngained their reward. Those of the Children of Osiris who had remained true \nto his teachings and fought against their own demonic hearts found their \ninner darkness cast out. They returned to life, finally able to relish the mortal \nlives denied to them so long ago. Other Children who had fallen from the \npath and who had taken up the forbidden practices of the blood demons were \ndestroyed, with their souls judged upon the scales of Ma’at. The god of the \nResurrection brought an end to the curse of every one of his children, either \nthrough final death or by granting of a mortal life. The remaining (now \nmortal) Children of Osiris gathered those who would listen to their teachings \nand awaited the coming of the Amenti in their holy sites, especially Abydos. \nSome of the returning dead are dangerously violent due to their inability \nto overcome their raging khaibits.

They are respected by the Amenti who remember them, and feared \nby those who seek to defy them. They are called Imkhu, or Revered Ones, by \nthe Amenti spirits that retain memories of times when the dying mummies \ncame to visit them in the Underworld city of Osiris. They combine nearly \ncomplete memories of scores of lifetimes with the vibrant life-force of the \nResurrection. \nHorus and his Imkhu advisors returned to his greatest temple, still \nstanding in Edfu. It is said that the son of Osiris has become a hawk-headed \ngod whose presence is too powerful for most to withstand for any length of \ntime without losing themselves to selfless worship. Apparently only the \nImkhu have the strength of spirit to resist his divine influence for long, and \nthey usually act as intermediaries for Horus, as much to protect visitors as to \ndefend their god. \nThe Followers of Horus have grown in ranks again. Mortals and younger \nmummies who behold the Avenger feel the spirit of the divine and are \ninspired with newfound faith. Visiting Resurrected are accorded great respect \nby the mortal adherents of the son of Osiris, and sometimes groups will seek \nto join a mummy in her work. \nESET-A \nLegends say that Isis sent the birds of the air to recover the lost portions \nof the god-king Osiris, which had been spread across Egypt by the villainy of \nhis evil brother Set. Splinter faiths within the Cult of Isis and the Children \nof Osiris believe that each of the resting places of Osiris’ body parts held relics \nthat absorbed portions of the god’s divine energy. In a mirror of the gathering \nof the god’s body, they seek to collect the artifacts that hold his Sekhem so \nthat they might rebuild him. Other factions feel that this approach borders \non blasphemy, especially since some Eset-a insist that the Islamic holy Ka’ba \nis the heart of the God of Life and Death. \nUnfortunately, many of the sites of the god’s remnants have been \npillaged over the millennia, and their artifacts have been scattered around the \nworld. Thus the Let-a search has been extended internationally. Their \ninfluence may be partly responsible for the shift in many governments’ \npolicies toward returning Egyptian relics to their homeland. The dangers \nposed by the possibility that mundane individuals could unknowingly destroy \nor further fragment the vessels that bear the essence of Osiris sometimes move \nthe Eset-a to desperate measures. They are not above theft or bribery for the \nopportunity to study treasures to ascertain if they might be one of the lost \nRemnants of Osiris. The Imkhu do not approve of this “ends justifies the \nmeans” attitude. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Others were called “Cabiri” after the Greek alchemist who discovered \nthe spell in Egypt. The Ishmaelites and Cabiri are virtually extinct.

Although he was considered the first god of the dead, as his father \nrose to prominence, he became known as the psychopomp, or the conductor \nof the dead through the Underworld. He was also known as a messenger \n(particularly in the Underworld), the god of mummification (he is often \ndepicted on tombs mummifying pharoahs), and possessor of unmatched \nwisdom regarding death. \nApophis -The Great Serpent was the foe of the sun-god Ra, dwelling \nin shadow and venturing out only in attempts to devour the sun. \nBast - \nBast was known as a keeper of secrets, and blessing the faithful \nand punishing the wicked with equal ferocity. She is usually depicted with the \nhead of a cat and the body of a woman. Her worship was strongly tied to the \nnotion of the cat as a sacred animal. \nBes -This misshapen dwarf was said to be so ugly that he scared even \ndemons, so he was often called upon to protect women in childbirth and \nnewborns, both tempting targets for evil spirits. Bes was also invoked as a god \nof luck and sexuality. While never formally accepted like Ra and Osiris, he \nwas nonethless beloved enough that mortals suffering from dwarfism were \nblessed in his name. \nGeb- Believed to be the father of Osiris, the spouse of the sky-goddess \nNuit and the very earth that we walk upon. \nHathor -This goddess was revered as the patron of artists, musicians \nand dancers, and associated with happiness and relief of earthly cares. \nEgyptian queens were believed to be her earthly incarnation, and wore horns \nhonoring her in ceremonial headdresses. She is usually depicted as a woman \nwith the head of a horned cow. \nHorus - \nThis mighty god is often depicted as a man with the head of \na falcon, often with one eye (the other lost to an attempt by Set to slay him). \nThe son of Osiris and Isis, he took up the fight against murderous Set after \nOsiris was forced to descend to the Underworld. \nImhotep - \nOriginally a mortal man who was the vizier and architect \nof the Pharoah Djoser, he designed the early pyramid of Saqqara and created \nthe engineering that would later lead to the Great Pyramids at Giza. His \naccomplishments as physician, astrologer and scientist were so impressive \nthat a cult honoring him sprang up after his death. His followers deified him, \nclaiming that he was the son of Ptah, the creator god. \nIsis - \nCalled the Queen of Heaven, Isis was the sister-wife of Osiris \nand the mother of Horus.

He was always depicted as a young man \nwith a royal sidelock, often playing a game of chance with Thoth. \nMa’at - The daughter of Ra and wife of Thoth, she was the \npersonification of truth, justice and order. She presided over the judgment of \nthe dead, weighing her feather against the heart of the deceased to determine \nif he had led a virtuous life. She was shown as a tall woman with an ostrich \nfeather on her head, sometimes with wings attached to her arms, and her \nsymbols were the ostrich feather and the scales. \nNephthys -The sister-wife of Set, she was later known as aprotector \nof the dead. She seduced Osiris and gave birth to the jackal-headed Anubis. \nNephthys helped Isis recover her husband after Set slew him. \nNuit -The spouse of the earth-god Geb, she is depicted as a woman \nwith a blue body covered with stars, arching high over Geb and touching him \nonly with the tips of her fingers and toes.

She was believed to ride \ninto battle beside the Pharaohs, and was called the Eye of Ra. \nSet - \nMost often depicted as a man with the head of a large-eared \nanimal (possibly a donkey), he was the lord of storms and violence.

      "text": "THE LANDS OF FAITH \nCalled by many the cradle of civilization, the lands of the Middle East are \nthe sites of intense religious and political struggle. The Amenti call this \nregion the Lands of Faith. Behind the scenes, the Lands of Faith are important \nin the struggles between the factions of the World of Darkness, as each seeks \nto claim the area’s physical and spiritual resources. This conflict led to the \ncreation of the first mummies long ago, and to the awakening of Osiris and \nthe creation of a new generation of the Reborn. These Reborn have come to \nclaim their troubled land and restore Ma’at to it. They have a difficult task \nahead of them. Ironically, the Web of Faith is the cause of much of the strife \nand conflict between its people. \nTHE MlEB OF FAITH \nThe origins of the Web of Faith are tied to the history of Osiris. When \nSet slew Osiris, he tore his body into 16 parts: his head, the soles of his feet, \nhis bones, his arms, his heart, his interior, his tongue, his eyes, his fist, his \nfingers, his back, his ears, his loins, his body, his head with the face of a ram, \nand his hair. Set scattered Osiris’ body across Egypt, and the Eset-a and others \nbelieve that these locations were mystically linked by the god’s essence. The \nhistorically recorded locations attributed to the parts of Osiris are: Ament of \nKoptos, Aa-ab in Elephantine, At-rut-f in Herkaleopolis Magna, Kusae, \nHeliopolis, An-Ament in Sma-behutet (Diopolis), Letopolis, Pa-Thuhen in \nSais, Meh-ta-f in Hermoplis, Athribis, Aq (Scedia), Ab in the Lybyan nome, \nHet-sera in the city of Netert, and Apis. \nMost Eset-a believe that this inconsistency of 14 locations and 16 parts \nis saved by the fact that the “face of a ram” is an allegory for one of the \nrepresentations of the creator and the fact that Osiris’ “loins” were swallowed \nby a naru fish (according to legend). The ritual self-disfigurement of the \nmummies known as the Sefekhi follows this same pattern replicated in \ngruesome personal scarification. Not surprisingly, they are one of the chief \nsupporters of the Eset-a. \nAt the beginning of the first millennium, Horus declared that the \nShemsu-heru mummies should fight Apophis on every front. He felt that the \nwar against the Great Corrupter had turned Egypt into a conquered state and \nthat it was time to carry that war to every comer of the world. This war was \nthe Diaspora, and the Shemsu-heru spent most of the next 2000 years far from \ntheir ancient homes fighting it. \nWhile the followers of Horus wandered the world, wizards in the Middle \nEast worked their magic. Devoted to the cause of unity, the Subtle Ones \nproposed an alliance with other sorcerers in their lands. They sought an end \nto the conflicts between them, and to help reinforce the wards created by King \nSolomon to keep the djinn from civilized lands. \nThe sorcerers proposed to magically link the holy sites of the Lands of \nFaith. Like a network of canals bringing water to the desert, Sekhem would \nflow among them, carried by the power of human faith through prayer or \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Upper and Lower Egypt - \nthe latter so named because it \nlies farthest from the source of the Nile -was known as Khem, or “the Black \nLand,”due to the rich dark soil deposited by the river during its annual floods. \nUpper Egypt is known as Deshret or “the Red Land,” and it lies closest to the \nsource of the Nile. Upper Egypt is mostly made up of forbidding deserts, and \nit is here that the Amenti say Osiris banished Set. Modem residents refer to \nthe country as Misr, which means “Egypt,” as well as “inhabited andcivilized.” \nALEXANDRIA \nModern Alexandria is a city of more than four million people situated \nalong the Mediterranean Sea. It is one of the most cosmopolitan areas in \nEgypt, and it carries a strong European influence. The inhabitants have \nrecently been making an effort to recapture some of the city’s lost Egyptian \nheritage. The Amenti carefully encourage this effort.

Although of only \nmild interest to tourists, Abydos is of vital importance to the Amenti. The \ncity was the stronghold of the Cult of Isis and the Children of Osiris for \ncenturies. Legend says that Abydos is where Osiris’ head fell after Set tore his \nbody to pieces, and that it is where his remains were interred after Set cast him \ninto the Lands of the Dead the second time. \nMost of the original city of Abydos has vanished from the Lands of the \nLiving, leaving only a few recognizable ruins.

The Children of Osiris consider Abydos their greatest holy \nsite. \nOTHER TOMBS \nWhile Giza and the Sphinx gamer the attention of tourists, there are \nother magnificent and important sites that dot the Egyptian landscape and sit \nupon powerful parts of the Web of Faith. They range from pyramids to \nmastabahs, and some even predate those found at Giza. \nMemphis is an ancient city that was the capitol of Egypt for thousands \nof years before the construction of Cairo, and it symbolized the power of the \npharaohs. The mud bricks and most of the city’s buildings have long since \ngiven way to time, but Memphis still exists and thrives across the Shroud in \nNeter-khertet. \nWest of the ruins of Memphis lies Saqqara, the ancient burial place of the \nOld Kingdom from the time of the Third Dynasty. Saqqara contains a number \nof tombs, including the oldest pyramid in the world, the step-pyramid of \nDjoser-Netcherikhe, which was built by Egyptian architect and wizard \nImhotep over 4500 years ago. Imhotep was so renowned that he was \neventually deified. \nThe temple at Luxor is located along the shore of the Nile in the center \nof downtown Luxor. It was built primarily during the reign of Amenhotep 111 \non top of a Middle Kingdom site. The temple features granite statues of \nRamses I1 and inscriptions honoring Amenhotep, Julius Caesar and Alexander \nthe Great. The temple served as a ceremonial joining place for the gods \ncommemorating the conception of the moon god Khonsu. \nThe temple at Karnak is the most majestic and complex ancient temple \nremaining in modern Egypt. Karnak is located several miles north of the \nLuxor temple. The Avenue of Sphinxes connects the two sites, originally \nlined with statues of smaller sphinxes. Karnak became the primary residence \nof the pharaohs during the 18th Dynasty, and each pharaoh continued to \nexpand the complex. Now it is mainly a tourist attraction, though the Cult \nof Isis maintains access to the temple’s inner chambers. \nThe ruins of ancient Thebes include mortuary temples dedicated to \nmany famous pharaohs, including Ramses 11. Hundreds of tombs can be seen \nacross from Luxor on the western banks of the Nile. Several miles west of the \nremains of Thebes stands a mountain peak that hedges one of Egypt’s greatest \narcheological sites, the Valley of Kings. Late dynasties wanted to protect their \ntombs from robbers, so they built them in a narrow valley guarded by high \ncliffs on three sides, and accessible only through a single narrow pass. The \nplan was unsuccessful and most of the tombs were plundered long before they \nwere rediscovered in the modern era. Ancient tem-akh speak of undiscovered \ntombs and secret entrances to the Valley of the Kings. Some Amenti use the \nsites to conduct powerful rituals or as resting places for their khat during \ndeath. \n. . .  \n. . . . . \n. . . \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "As might be expected, the Valley of Queens does not lie far from-the \nValley of Kings. It is a special burial area for the wives and children of the \nPharaohs. Families were often interred with the pharaoh, but this practice \nchanged during the rule of Ramses I, presumably as a further effort to ensure \nthe safety of the pharaoh‘s tomb. Like the Valley of Kings, the Valley of \nQueens contains hidden tombs known only to the Amenti and other servants \nof Osiris. \nARABIA \nAs has been noted, the Web of Faith actually extends far beyond the \nborders of Egypt. The Amenti often focus on their homeland in Egypt because \nit offers them a rich trove of lost knowledge, powerful access to holy sites of \nOsiris, and the comfort of lands held fondly in their ancient memories. \nNevertheless, the Web of Faith includes many other important locations, \nnotably Mecca in Arabia. \nMECCA \nThe holy city of Mecca is the heart of the Muslim world. Five times each \nday, Muslims pray toward the Ka’ba of the holy city. Millions of pilgrims visit \nMecca each year as part of the hajj, which is the pilgrimage that is the fifth \npillar of the Islamic faith (and from which the mummy pilgrimage borrows its \nname). Mecca was a holy city even before the coming of the Prophet. The \nKa’ba housed pagan idols worshipped by the Bedouin tribes, and the city was \na place for meetings and festivals along the ancient caravan routes. \nWhen Mohammed first brought the word of Allah to the city, he was \ndriven out and forced to flee to Medina. The Prophet gathered his forces there \nand returned to seize Mecca. He cast out the pagan idols from the Ka’ba, \nreconsecrating it to Allah. Ever since then, Mecca has been the greatest \nstronghold of the Islamic faith and one of the holiest places on Earth. \nIn the World of Darkness, Mecca is protected from some of the power of \nisfret by the faith invested in the city over the centuries. It is also protected \nby the powerful energies that flow through the Web of Faith into Mecca, and \nthrough the Ka’ba along the lines established by the mystics who constructed \nit. \nThe Ka’ba, or the “House of God,” is said to have been built by Abraham \nin the time of the Old Testament. It is a cube-shaped building of dark-gray \nstone that sits in the courtyard of the al-Harran mosque. In the southeast \ncomer of the Ka’ba is the Black Stone, the “Right Hand of Allah on Earth.” \nIt is a large rocksaid to have beengiven to Abraham by the archangel Gabriel. \nPart of the Islamic hajj consists of walking seven times around the Ka’ba and \nkissing the Black Stone in reverence. Some Amenti, particularly of the Eset- \na faction, call the Black Stone “the Ab of Osiris” and believe that the spiritual \nheart of the Lord of Resurrection resides within it. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "THE KEENING \nThe Ka’ba is the source of the Keening, the mystical noise that torments \nall beings of isfret in Arabia. Wards around the Ka’bacreated by vampires help \ndampen the noise, but they cannot drown it out. \nThe spiritual cry of the Keening can be heard only in the Arabian \npeninsula by enemies of Ma’at, including vampires, Bane Mummies, fomori \nand so forth. It is strongest near the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and \nappears to be tied to Mohammed’s cleansing of those cities and to the sacred \nBlack Stone. All enemies of Ma’at hear the sun rise and move across the sky, \nas the sound of the Keening grows in direct proportion to the shining of Ra. \nThose creatures that slumber during the day find their rest disturbed. In game \nterms, a foreign vampire in Arabia must expend one Willpower Trait in order \nto sleep, or he suffers an additional one-Trait difficulty to Courage checks for \nRotschreck for the following night. It is possible to grow used to the disturbing \nsound though, and after a month of adjustment these penalties do not apply. \nWithin 50 miles of Medina and Mecca, the Keening is so powerful that \nit interferes with the supernatural senses of any creature of isfret. Such \ncreatures must bid one extra Trait any time they use supernatural senses such \nas Auspex, Ghostsight, sensory Sphere magic, etc. Even Simple Tests require \nthe creature of isfret to bid one Trait. Furthermore, the cost of supernatural \npowers is doubled for creatures of isfret when used on Islamic holy ground, \nincluding all mosques. Powers using blood, Chi, Gnosis, etc., require the \nexpenditure of twice the normal number of Traits. Also, no creature of isfret \ncan enter Mecca or Medina unless it has been purified by a religious \npilgrimage. \nRUB AL KHALI: THE EMPTY QWTER \nThe southern region of Saudi Arabia is a vast desolate desert known as \nRub A1 Khali, “The Empty Quarter.’’ The desert is home to only a few \nwandering tribes of Bedouins, with no signs of civilization, and often no \nindications of life. Cities once existed here, but they were home to the \nmalevolent djinn called the devil-kings. The followers of the Prophet and \ntheir allies destroyed those foul places during the Jyhad, and allowed sand and \ntime to claim them. What remains is little more than legend. \nThe desolation found in the Rub A1 Khali, and perhaps the lingering \npower of the devil-kings, weakens the Web of Faith over this land until it \nunravels to naught in the deepest of the waste. The Reborn find it an \ninhospitable place where they cannot even draw Sekhem from the Web. \nSome Amenti feel they must guard against the forces that gather in the \ndeserts. The Bedouin tribes speak of malevolent djinn appearing in the \ndesolate depths of the Empty Quarter - \nferal ghuls who hunger for blood, \nwizards who raise storms from nothingness.

They prepared carefully for \ntheir journey to this land, anxious to ensure their eternal well-being. \nTHE SHROUD \nThe Shroud is a wall between the physical and spirit realms that divides \nlife from death. It limits the ability of the living to see and feel the presence \nof the dead, and it tries to keep the dead from interfering in the world of the \nliving. The Shroud is not uniform in strength; it is often thinner in places with \na strong connection to faith, spirit and death. It is weakest at sacred sites, \nburial ruins and holy ground. It is little surprise that the Shroud is weaker over \nthe whole of the Lands of Faith, particularly in Egypt, than it is elsewhere in \nthe world. \nNETER-KNERTET: THE SHADOWLANDS \nNeter-khertet means “divine underworld place.” It is a dark mirror of the \nLands of the Living that lies just on the other side of the Shroud. The land, \nsea and sky appear much like their earthly counterparts, but they are paler. \nThe only things that truly exist inNeter-khertet are the spirits of the dead and \nthe spirits of items, or relics, that once inspired strong feelings. Neter-khertet \nis a place made from distant memories and ancient history, which the Lands \nof Faith have in plenty. \nThe places that have long since crumbled to dust and ash in the Lands \nof the Living still exist in Neter-khertet, though all have suffered from the \nforce of the Dja-akh. Tombs and temples that turned to sand still stand on the \nother side. Those dead who cannot leave the world behind pass among us, just \non the other side of the Shroud. They cannot touch or affect things in the \nLands of the Living without expending great energy, yet they derive strength \nfrom their tenuous connections to the living world. \nPILLARS OF THE WEST \nIf you travel westward from Neter-khertet, you eventually enter a vast \nstretch of desert beyond which lie the Pillars of the West. The Pillars are a \ngateway to h a t .  It is difficult to explain to a mortal how to reach the Pillars \nof the West as they are entirely outside of the realm of Neter-khertet. Spirits \nhave ways of traveling that defy the physical realm, and when they reach the \nPillars they are no longer close to the Lands of the Living. They have made \ntheir way to the Lands of the Dead. \nThe Pillars, each carved in the form of one of the 42 Judges of Ma’at, \nsupport the entrances to 21 great caverns. The caverns lead into a maze of \nunderground tunnels through which travelers must find their way in order to \nreach Duat. The caverns and tunnels often contain different challenges to \ntest the worthiness of those who enter, which is believed to be the Judges of \nMa’at invoking their power through the Tests of the Pillars.

Strange creatures dwell within the depths of the \nstorm, howling madly for victims to devour. Travel here is dangerous, but \nthankfully Anubis, the guide and guardian of the dead, created and maintains \nsafe pathways through Duat. Such passages are known as Byways, and a \nmummy spirit in the care of Anubis or one of the Aken, his loyal boatmen, \ncan usually travel these spirit routes safely. \nUsually Anubis or one of his ghostly boatmen is on hand at the entrance \nto Duat when a spirit arrives from the caverns of the Pillars of the West. \nShould the mummy or spirit specifically seek the Judges of Ma’at, Anubis \nalways appears. \nAMENTI: THE RUINED KINGDOM OF SAND \nAmenti was once the grand spiritual city that served as a haven to the \nEgyptian dead. Osiris sat silently as its ruler for millennia and ancient ghosts \nsheltered in his glory, and mummies traveled here between lives. The Dja-akh \nshattered Amenti, and its wraithly citizens were either destroyed outright or \nflayed until they were scattered fragments. The ruins of Amenti lie beneath \nthe black desert of Duat, haunted by malevolent ghosts and creatures from the \ndepths of the Dja-akh. Few Reborn see any reason to go there, though some \nsay the city must surely contain ancient relics and lore that once belonged to \nthe Egyptian dead. Regardless, the Amenti bear the name of the city to honor \nits memory and ensure that it is never forgotten. \nTHE BLESSED FIELDS OF A’ARU \nThe ancient Egyptians spoke of a heaven where their sahu traveled to \nlive in peace and plenty. The Fields of A’aru were closed to the other aspects \nof the soul, however, and thus Amenti stood for thousands of years as home \nto the dead. Those who have undergone the new Resurrection are joined into \none being, however, and Anubis has revealed that they may enter A’aru. In \nthis place, their souls find renewal and peace, or they seek the judgment of the \nJudges of Ma’at. \nLEXTCON \nThis section presents a lexicon of the mythical terms as mummies in the \ngame refer to them. Not every one of the Reborn will know all of these, but \none can be certain that wise Imkhu and clever Storytellers will use them. \nA’aru, Fields of: A spiritual realm said to be the Egyptian equivalent of \nheaven.

The meaning of “balance” in Egyptian \nmythology derives from the belief that the goddess Ma’at weighs the heart of \na dead spirit that comes before her against the feather of Ma’at.

It has abated somewhat but still rages in many areas. \nDuat: Also often transliterated “tuat.” It is the Underworld - realms of \nspirit where ghosts reside and mummies go during their death cycles.

Strong ba generally dwelled in the \ncity of Amenti and staffed the city’s priesthood and army, \nhence the name Scroll-bearers.

Funerary rites assist the khu in this transaction and help \nthe soul remove itself from the caul at the appropriate time. The soul goes on - \nthe ba \non its errands, the sahu to the Fields of A’aru - \nand the khu lingers on the edges of the \nspiritual world, providing a beacon for the other portions of the individual’s soul. The \nfigurines of servants, tools and weapons placed in Egyptian tombs provided the khu with \nresources for its mission, or so the priests and sorcerers hoped. \nTomb-raiding made it more difficult. Mummies dragged from tombs to magicians’ \nworkshops, museums and other distant locations brought their khu with them. Cut off \nfrom most of their resources for support, the khu had to struggle (usually alone) to do \ntheir duty in unfamiliar lands and times. Ambitious khu hoped that they could draw on \nthe energy of young civilizations interested in the Egyptian legacy to rebuild all that had \nbeenlost, until the Dja-akhstruck.

They were \ninstruments of justice and symbols of the greater whole, drawn to mortals who were dull, \nselfish, plodding or self-centered in life-people whose minds did not radiate the strength \nof thought and wisdom which is characteristic of the khu. In particular, people who \nstruggled to achieve something lasting but lacked the ability or understanding to do it \nsuccessfully call out to the khu, which enters and shows the mortal what she needs to know \nto grasp her ambition’s place in the infinitely complex web of spiritual and physical ties. \nThe khu relied on effigies made by others long ago, and retain their interest in such \ncreations. Efigj lets them apply their insights most effectively. \nThe Hajj: The khu has experience inhabiting prepared vessels and usually makes \nthe hajj with little complication, apart from the innate limitations imposed by \nunfamiliar languages and cultures. \nThe Third Life: The new Spirit Scepter begins her Third Life with inspiration. She \nsees how to do what she’s tried and failed at, and much more. Everything around her makes \nsense in a way it never did before, as a thing in itself and as part of ever-greater systems. She \nderives great pleasure from creating and from understanding others’ creations. \nAs she matures, she comes to appreciate fully how every single thing fits into the \nuniversal design of Ma’at. Evil and discord become more acutely painful to her, since she \nknows how their harm resonates throughout the world, and purely self-indulgent \nexpression becomes a waste of time.

When the result is clearly \ninsufficient to take up the burdens that Osiris intends, new and old soul alike are cast \naway to become fodder for the beast Amemait. Worthy unions return to the deceased \nbody to become one of the Amenti. In between the clear-cut cases, ambiguity reigns. \nThe tem-akh may replace the most damaged or least developed part of a soul \nwhile leaving another part still crucially weak. Indeed, the stress of the union may \ncreate fresh spiritual problems. In cases where the Judges see potential for the result, \nthey excise part of the united soul for discarding while allowing the rest to return to \nits body. The tem-akh is stretched to cover the holes and loses most of its memories, \nand the modem soul likewise bends and breaks. The product can return to life and \nserve the great cause, but it carries inner wounds as constant reminders of being not \nquite worthy. Other mummies and their admirers among the resurrection cults call \nthese damaged mummies “the Udja-sen,” or Judged Ones. \nMost Judged Ones hate their condition and regard it as unfair. A few aim to prove \nthemselves worthy of healing in the hopes that mastery of Balance may mend their \nwounds. Others turn their back on the struggle for Ma’at and try to make their own \nway in the world. They lack the inner guiding voice other mummies enjoy, since their \ntem-akh were pushed and broken to allow for survival at all. Judged Ones carry no \nautomatic awareness of Osiris’ righteousness or the necessity for Ma’at, and must \ninstead rely on their own conscience and judgment. They seek a hypothetical \nredemption without external guideline, or even the assurance that it actually exists. \nThe Hajj: A Judged One begins with one of the other five tem-akh types and \nmakes the journey to the Lands of Faith as usual. The damage done in reconstruction \nusually removes all memories of the trip. \nThe Third Life: A Judged One’s existence begins with pain and immediately \npasses on to condemnation. He knows with his first clear thought that there’s \nsomething wrong with him. He cannot remember much of either his First Life or his \nSecond Life, and lacks the guiding spiritual force other mummies feel. Alienation \nusually follows quickly, and Apophis’ minions prey on Judged Ones’ doubts and \nangers. A successful Judged One must find some way to cope with the permanent \nwounds he carries and some purpose to guide his actions into an uncertain future. \nThe Judged One does have some unique advantages, and in time the blessings \nimplicit in them may become clear. His freedom to go where he wants without loss of \npower lets him extend the quest for Ma’at to places other mummies cannot safely go, \nand he can choose the terms on which he deals with other mummies. He is free, not \nmerely cast out. \nAffiliations: Every Judged One is distinctive, though they do share the fact that \nmore than one part of their soul was out ofbalance.

People are drawn to your \napparent innocence and try to shelter you from danger. \nCompetitor - \nYou must finish first and be the best of the best.

You won’t \ncheat to beat your opponents, but you also aren’t above taking advantage of an \n“edge” when it presents itself. \nConfidant-You \nempathize withothers and seek to gain their trust.

If people want to promise you something they shouldn’t expect \nanything in return. \nCritic - \nYou have a knack for revealing the weaknesses and faults of \nothers.

Perhaps she was \na temple dancer, whose movements inspired those around her, or he may have \nbeen a humble scribe who listened and learned more than what he wrote down. \nYour Amenti can be from any walk of life -the Spell of Life only asks for those \nwho can commit to the cause of Ma’at.

Many Amenti receive new \nknowledge from the Joining, and the Inheritance can be a good indicator of \nwhat he or she knew in times past. \nAmBUTES (BIDDING TRAITS) \nThe Traits that describe your character’s innate capabilities are called \nAttributes, which are used in the game to perform actions and overcome \nobstacles. While certain situations may also require Abilities, such matters are \na function of training. Even with appropriate training, you must call on your \nown strengths to finish the tasks before you. \nWhen you enter a situation with a questionable outcome, you bid a Trait \nappropriate to the challenge.

A character's Ability Traits represent special training or talent, and \nas such, they often allow performance of tasks that are otherwise impossible. \nEven with more mundane situations, Abilities allow for a muchdimproved \nchance of success. \nWhen a character performs a risky or uncertain action, Abilities aid the \noutcome.

Abilities used like this \nare recovered at the next game session. \nA character with multiple levels in a given Ability is certainly more \nexperienced and proficient than an individual with just one Trait. Most \ncharacters fall into one of three levels of Ability; greater amounts are very rare, \nlimited to Imkhu and other ancients.

The Storyteller may \nrequire the possession or use of an Ability Trait to perform a specific task. In \nthis case, characters without the Ability, or who have already used all of their \nlevels of the Ability, cannot attempt the task at all. \nWhen an Ability is used against a set scenario or object (such as using \nInvestigation to uncover information), the feat usually has a difficulty assigned \nby the Storyteller. In such a Static Challenge, you may be required to risk a \ncertain number of Traits for a trivial task, or be asked to bid more Traits for a \ndifficult, risky or tedious task. \nSome Abilities can be used against an opponent instead of facilitating a \nregular undertaking. In this case, the Ability is expended to gain a retest in a \nchallenge with the opponent. \nFOCUSING ABILITIES \nA few Abilities specifically require a concentrated area of study. One \ncannot simply study all Crafts at once, after all. These Abilities are specifically \nnoted in the descriptions. When you take such an Ability, you must choose an \narea of study, a specific topic that you have concentrated on. Each area is \nconsidered a separate Ability, so Linguistics: Egyptian is completely separate \nfrom Linguistics: Hebrew, for instance. \nABILITY SPECIALIZATIONS \nWithin a given area of expertise, some practitioners further hone their \nknowledge to arazor’s edge. By choosing aspecialization in an Ability, you fine- \ntune your skills with a particular facet of that talent. \nAbility specializations are anoptional rule. Remember to ask your Storyteller \nbefore taking aspecialization. Sometimes they can add even more color to your \ncharacter; however, keeping track of special Abilities can be tedious for \nStorytellers and record-keepers. \nTaking a specialization requires that you spend one Free or Experience \nTrait on an ability that you already possess. Whenever you perform a task with \nthat specialization - \neven if you do not expend the Ability - \nyou gain a one- \nTrait bonus on resolving challenges, as long as you have at least one level of the \nmain Ability left to spend. You may have only one specialization in any given \nAbility; you cannot take Brawl: White Tiger Kung Fu and Brawl: Krav Maga and \nexpect an amazing amalgamate feat. Also, you can never gain more than one \nBonus Trait from specializations, even if more than one would be appropriate \nto a given challenge. Even if you possess Law: Criminal and Investigation: \nResearch, you only get the one-Trait bonus on a test for trial preparation, \ndespite your multiple specializations. \nA specialization is a concentrated area of expertise or practice.

As such, you \nconcentrate your research in one particular facet of that sub-specialized \nAbility. Thus you could have Computer: Hacking with a specialization in \nviruses, or Crafts: Blacksmithing with a specialization in Farrier. \nNote that the Bonus Traits from a specialization are not bid or used like \nother Traits. You simply are “one Trait up” on challenges within that \nspecialization. \nExample: Mary-Catherine is a proficient sword fighter, but she excels with the \nrapier. She has the Ability: Melee x 4 with the specialization Rapier. When Mary- \nCatherine encounters a foe in combat, she normally uses her seven Physical Traits. \nWitharapier, howewer, she has eight PhysicalTraits because ofher extensive training. \nShouldshe tire or be wounded (losingseweralchallenges anddraining Traits), she may \nnot be as effective in combat. But as long as she retains at least one level ofher Melee \nAbility, she gets to add the one-Trait bonus to her remaining Physical Trait total. \nAcademics \nYou possess higher learning beyond a high-school education. With \nAcademics, you can debate the existence of gravity, indulge in studies of culture \nand give Jeopardy contestants a run for their money. This broad Ability covers \nall sorts of arts and humanities. \nAcademics allow you to recognize and name historical, artistic and cultural \nreferences. You can use Academics when working in such fields, as developing \na thesis or researching.

You admire and respect their untamed ways, which allow you to \nempathize and communicate with them. It’s not so much like Dr. Dolittle, \nrather, you know how to deal with them more equitably.

Awareness requires \na Mental Challenge to use, and retests are made with the Occult Ability. \nBrawl \nMaybe you roughed up the kids at the schoolyard, hard-styled the martial- \narts students, or kicked ass in bar fights. You might have some military training, \nor maybe you just grew up with a rough-and-tumble sibling who taught you how \nto defend yourself. Whatever the case, you know how to dish out damage with \nyour fists and legs. Use the Brawl Ability for retests in combat when you are \nusing your natural weapons (teeth, claws or fists).

This Ability is very helpful for Amenti who \nplan on spending extended amounts of time in Duat or Neter-khertet. Each \nTrait allows a retest when attempting to enter or return from the Lands of the \nDead. \nCrafts \nYou build and construct things. Depending on your specific area of \nexpertise, you might know how to build a house or sculpt figures out of ice. As \nsuch, you must conform to an area of expertise and focus, such as Weaving, \nCarpentq or Sculpting. Perhaps a more media-focused art, like Painting or \nDrawing, suits your talent.

By guiding a conversation, you can also unearth someone’s \nNegative Traits; if you manage to steer conversation to a particular topic in \nplay, you can expend a Subterfuge Ability and make a Social Challenge to \ndetermine one of the subject’s Negative Traits related to the topic. \nSurvival \nSurvival represents a knowledge of terrain, how to find shelter, where to \nfind water, techniques in hunting, edible and poisonous plants, and so on.

Your Storyteller may require you to take a specialization in a type of \nterrain (Arctic, Desert, Forest, etc.) \nThanatology \nMost mortals fear death. Ancient Egyptians honored it by studying it. You \nare considered a student of death and dying if your Amenti possesses Traits in \nthis Ability. You understand not just the mortification and preservation of a \ncorpse, but also the spiritual dimensions of death - \nfunerary rites, respectful \ntreatment of a corpse, embalming, etc. You may have been an embalmer or \ndoctor in your First or Second Life, or perhaps you are just fascinated by life’s \nend in your Third Life. This knowledge also gives you some understanding of \nghosts and zombies, at least as related to their physical deaths and present \nstates. \nTraps \nYou have more than a casual understanding of how to build, design and \ndisarm various mechanical traps, such as those built in ancient Egyptian tombs, \nor as seen in various movies, to deter thieves and curious professors from \nplundering them. Quite often a mummy uses this skill in her resting place so \nher body and belongings are not disturbed while her soul travels in Duat. \nTraps take time and effort to set up. Combined with Enigmas, you may \ncreate complex traps that not even the shrewdest of minds would think to \ninvestigate. \nBACKGROUNDS \nYour character’s Backgrounds help to flesh out ties with mortal agencies, \ntheir roles in society and available beneficial resources.

It may gift you with minor blessings, as these creatures \nare sacred to the gods, and the gods look favorably on those who walkwith their \nfavored creatures. Your Companion also accompanies you in the Underworld. \nCommoncreatures to be mummified include cats, falcons, dogs, crocodiles, \nlions and the ibis, and anything with religious significance to the Egyptians is \npossible. Work with the Storyteller to hash out your Companion specifics. \nCONTACTS \nWith the right contacts in all walks of life, you can get all sorts of useful \ninformation. Keeping your ear to the ground does not always pan out with the \nmost insightful information, but it keeps you abreast of the basic 41 1. \nIn game terms, your rating in Contacts allows you to discern rumors and \ninformation. When you call on your Contacts, you make a few phone calls, \ncheck with likely snitches and grease a few palms. In return, you get rumors and \ninformation as if possessing of a certain amount of Influence. Doing so lets you \nfind out exactly what's going on in the city within a particular area. You can \nget information of a level equal to however many contacts you use. If you use \nContacts x 3 on Industry, for instance, you get information as if digging up dirt \nwith Industry x 3 Influence.

This limit counts against all of \nyour total Influence -your combined levels cannot exceed this total.

You also have some \nsolid resources that you can use when times are tight. Unlike the use of Finance, \nthese resources are always readily available, and they come to you automatically \ndue to your investments, jobs and holdings. \nYour number of Resources Traits determines the amount of money and \ncapital that you can secure. By expending temporary Resources Traits (which \nreturn at the next game session), you can draw on your regular income, as \nshown in the accompanying table. If you expend permanent Resources, you can \ndivest yourself of holdings, allowing access to 10 times the amount shown on \nthe table. Storyteller always adjudicates the limits of what you can buy.

A mummy starts out with a limited Balance, \nwhich is granted by the joining and the Spell of Life. As she studies and \nprogresses, proving herself worthy through words and deeds, she strengthens \nand deepens her understanding of this universal principle. An Amenti with a \ndeep understanding of Balance is capable of amazing feats, since those in \nharmony with Ma’at know that the force of the universe is behind their deeds. \nThose players who are familiar with Vampire: The Masquerade might equate \nthis Trait with Humanity, but those rules do not provide a complete picture of \nwhat Balance is. Rather, it is a spiritual and cosmological enlightenment that \nis embodied in a particular moral code. \nAn Amenti begins character creation with one Trait of Balance, and he \ncan purchase more with Freebie Traits, up to three Balance Traits. \nA Reborn’s Balance determines how much Sekhem she can have at any \none time. A mummy can attain a greater Sekhem rating only through the use \nof Hekau. \nAn Amenti can call for a Balance Challenge versus an appropriate number \nof Traits in order to resist any temptation or force that causes her to violate the \nnatural order, which includes vampiric powers of Dominate and other wizardry \npowers, as well as Social Attributes and Abilities. \nA mummy can use the strength of her Balance to protect the natural order \nfrom unnatural changes, and therefore gains a Trait to her Balance score when \nopposing Sphere magic cast by mages. This type of countermagic is considered \na single action, versus eight Traits. \nAn Amenti can have Attribute ratings equal to his Balance score, so a \ncharacter whose Balance goes six Traits can spend experience to increase his \nAttributes to superhuman levels. Similarly, a mummy’s magical skills are \nlimited by his adherence to the path of Ma’at, and thus no Hekau can exceed \nhis Balance score. \nS E E M  \nThe ancient Egyptians used Sekhem to mean alternately “power” or “life- \nforce.” For the Undying, Sekhem refers to the life energy flowing through the \nworld and focused within the Web of Faith. This energy helps sustain them in \ntheir immortal existence, and it allows them to use their magic of Hekau. It is \nto them what Gnosis is to the changing breeds, what quintessence is to the \nmages, what blood is to the vampires. The Web of Faith plays a key role in a \nmummy’s rebirth, as it acts as a conduit for the power ofOsiris himself. It is fairly \neasy for an Amenti to tap into the Web to regain lost Sekhem. \nA mummy regains Sekhem in a few different ways.

Each success restores one Trait of Sekhem up to a maximum of \nthe character’s Balance rating. If the player loses the challenge, the mummy \nrecovers no Sekhem. \nThe world outside the Lands of Faith is strongly influenced by the power \nof Apophis, making Sekhem less freely available.

He is used to playing Vampire: The Masquerade, but does \nnot care to pretend to be a blood-sucking creature. He does enjoy pretending \nto be an ancient incarnation from a world just recently remembered and \nconcludes his search with Mummy: The Resurrection. Rob decides to pick up \na copy of Mummy: The Resurrection at his local hobby store, then gets on the \nInternet and searches for LARP games in his area.

He decides that his character was a shallow, power-hungry \nbusinessman, someone who has underlings to do his dirty work and lots of liquid \nassets. Thinking further, Rob decides his character’s severe lack of respect for \nothers as the consummate conniver would be attractive to a wandering Amenti \nsoul-that \nof a Mesektet. The Joining would aid his character in turning over \nnew leaf, to atone for the sins of his former life. John makes a mental note to \nplan for fun plot twists to throw at Rob’s character in his struggle for Ma’at. Rob \nchooses Martyr for his Nature and Caregiver for his Demeanor, reflecting the \nnew facet of his personality that the Mesektet spirit has supplemented to his \nonce-selfish and slimy personality. John points out that the Path of Ma’at is the \none and only path on the quest for Balance that an Amenti can follow. John \nthen instructs Rob to choose an Inheritance, to figure out what sort of First Life \nhis character led. Rob decides that he was a priest, skilled in the art of healing \nand divine magic. Finally a name for his character comes to him - \nBrian. \nStep Two: Attributes \nRob now prioritizes his Attribute categories to determine his mortal \nstrengths and weaknesses. He decides that Social is Brian’s primary Trait \ncategory, Physical is secondary and Mental is tertiary.

Finally comes Mental, with three Traits, and Rob picks \nCunning, Cunning and Dedicated to reflect Brian’s overall determination to get \nwhat he wants, even if he lacks the know-how. \nStep Three: Advantages \nNow Rob has to choose Brian’s Abilities. There are many that Rob wants \nto scribble down on his character sheet, but for now he is restricted to five \nAbilities as a mortal. John explains that, at the stage, Rob is not able to increase \nany Ability above three Traits. To stay true to Brian’s shady personality and \ncutthroat lifestyle, Rob selects Computer, Finance, Finance, Fiream and \nSubte.rfuge. All of these Abilities come together to aid Brian in his business life \nas a top executive. They also provide a narrow scope of talents, reflecting a \nsingle-mindedness to play to his strengths and use them to his advantage. \nStep Four: Backgrounds \nRob must decide what mortal ties Brian has cultivated during his mortal life. \nTo stick to Brian’s beaten path, he quickly scribbles down one level of Finance \nInfluence and two levels of Resources.

Brian, in a moment of clarity, realizes that his soul is not destined for the \npearly gates and chooses eternal life. The tem-akh spirit joins with Brian’s soul, \nforcing his physical body to heal the fatal bullet wounds and, as if moving like a \nzombie, travels to the Lands of Faith and seeks out the Spell of Life. This Rite of \nRebirth succeeds and Brian is reborn Brian Ferguson-Rahotep. \nStep Two: Attributes \nRob must now allot two additional Traits to his Attributes, preferably to \nthe ones where he lacks stronger numbers. To keep it simple, Rob increases \nBrian’s Mental Traits by two, and takes Knowledgeable and Wise, reflecting this \nnew influence on his life. This raises Brian’s overall total to five Mental Traits. \nStep Three: Abilities \nNow Rob is instructed to add five more Abilities to his total, and is allowed \nto pass beyond three Traits in a single category. John adds that Rob may want \nto choose some Abilities specific to the ancient Amenti knowledge. Rob then \nchooses Cosmology, Divination, Medicine, Meditation and Occult. Brian now has \na total of 10 Abilities: Computer, Finance, Finance, Firearms, and Subterfuge and \nthe five Ability Traits above. John compliments Rob in his choices, noting that \nRob seems to grasp the basic idea behind the Joining and how a tem-akh spirit \nprovides Traits that a nehem-sen spirit lacks before rebirth. \nStep Four: Advantages \nJohn informs Rob that this is where the supernatural part of Brian is fleshed \nout-the \nnifty powers and Backgrounds. Rob must choose his Hekau and allot \nthree Traits into them, reserving one Trait for Celestial, his primary Hekau path. \nJohn explains that each Amenti has his own primary Hekau, and that Celestial \nis the primary Hekau path for the Mesektet. Before Rob continues, John explains \nthat Rob cannot have a Hekau path rating higher than Brian’s Balance score, \nwhich starts at one Trait. Rob looks over Basic-level Celestial spells and rituals, \nand chooses Becalm, granting access to a spell that allows Brian protection from \nadverse weather conditions within a limited distance from him. Next he chooses \nthe Alchemy Hekau ritual Simple Elixir: Monkey’s Dew, which magically boosts a \nrecipient’s physical dexterity. Finally, Rob chooses the Necromancy Hekau spell \nJudge the Soul, enabling Brian to gaze at a subject and judge the purity of his soul. \nNow Rob must add two additional Background Traits, keeping in mind what \nJohn mentioned about these steps and choosing Traits more geared to an \nAmenti, and allots one Trait each to the Ba and Ka Backgrounds. \nStep Five: Finishing Touches \nRob has come to the last facet of character creation. He must first write \ndown his starting Balance score, which for any Amenti is one Trait, then he \nassigns his starting Willpower of five Traits. Last comes Brian’s starting \nSekhem, the magical power within Brian, which, like any starting Amenti, \nbegins with one Trait. John then asks Rob if he’d like to take any Negative \nTraits or Flaws.

Rob can now spend five additional Free Traits, plus the six \nextra Free Traits he earned from taking Negative Traits and Flaws, for a total \nof 11 Free Traits to spend into Merits or to increase other Traits.

Experience points quantify this process of development in \ncapabilities for characters. \nStorytellers and Narrators award experience Traits at the end of each \nsession. Each character who takes part in play and survives should get one \nexperienceTrait. AdditionalTraits come at Storyteller discretion. The character \nof a player who makes useful and enjoyable contributions to the game, and who \nhelps create opportunities for other players along the way, often receives two \nexperience Traits. Three-Trait awards are usually saved for truly memorable \nplay - particularly at the climax of long-running storylines and scenes of \nappropriate and heroic roleplaying, and for significant contributions to making \nthe game possible, like securing a great site on a regular basis. Generally, most \nplayers earn one experience point per session. \nChronicles with sessions held just once or twice a month, or even less, may \nwant to increase the basic award to two Traits per session. This allowance lets \ncharacters develop about as rapidly as they would in a chronicle with more \nfrequent sessions, which players usually find satisfying.

Other forms were available to anyone willing to study the \ntexts and practice the disciplines. The Hekau as described here draw on that \ntradition. Some require the innate power of Sekhem to use, but the knowledge \ncomponent of each is available to anyone with access to teachers and texts. \nMost tem-akh retain some knowledge of protective charms and the like \nfrom their First Lives. The Cult of Isis preserved more lore, and its members now \ninstruct the Amenti. In addition, the Amenti make their own discoveries and \ntrade insights with each other. \nAlchemy: Named for A1 Khem, the Black Land, Alchemy is one aspect of \nEgyptian magic with a living inheritance. The Western magical tradition \nincludes many variations on Alchemy, and they all have roots in Egyptian \npractice: the elixir of life, universal medicine, the transmutation of elements. \nThe Scroll-bearers guarded knowledge lost to living people in their time in the \nUnderworld, and now they return it to the world. \nAmulets: Meket, the art of crafting charms, focuses magical power \nthrough material objects for the protection of their wearers. Wealthy and \npowerful Egyptians were interred with as many amulets as they could obtain to \nguard them against the Underworld’s dangers. The Tomb Watchers mastered \nat least a few warding spells while guarding their respective khat, and build on \nthose basics after the Rite of Rebirth. \nCelestial: The gods move in the heavens, and the careful student of \ncelestial phenomena can learn much. Armed with knowledge, the magician \ncan then command nature. Celestial magic is often subtle, but far-reaching in \nits potential. The Night Suns carry a special affinity for Ra and his movements \nwithin them, and reach out from the sun to the rest of the cosmos. \nEffigy: This art relies on sympathetic magic, which is the bond between \na physical representation of a thing and the thing itself. Like amulets, ushabti, \nor “answerers,)) were often laid alongside buried Egyptians to assist them in the \nafterlife. Today the Spirit Scepters apply their experience of the Underworld \nand their memories of the ancient craft to attend to the needs of Osiris’ modem \nservants. \nNecromancy: The magic of the dead reached unparalleled heights in \nEgypt, in part because of the Egyptian insights into the complex nature of the \nsoul - \nits many parts and their interactions with each other and the body. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

The evolution of \nlanguage has hidden many secrets of naming magic from mortal magicians; \nonly the surviving Shemsu-heru remember the authentic power of old. New \nAmenti draw on memory and concealed lore to work feats that dazzle living \nmages of other traditions. \nWORKING MAGIC \nThe Hekau are not unidirectional sequences of power. Each level of \nmastery that a mummy possesses allows multiple options. There are two \nseparate measures of power: the character’s path rating in a Hekau, and the \ndifficulty of a particular spell or ritual. A path rating of 1 or 2 lets the character \nlearn Basic effects in that Hekau; a path rating of 3 or 4 lets the character to \nlearn Intermediate effects; a path rating of 5 lets the character learn Advanced \neffects. \nEach character begins with three levels of path rating to divide up, one of \nwhich must be in the Hekau that Amenti’s tem-akh specializes in (a rating of \n2 in one Hekau and 1 in another, or 1 each in three Hekau). The character also \nstarts off knowing two Basic spells and two Basic rituals from among the Hekau \nin which he has a rating. A character’s path rating in any Hekau may never be \nhigher than his Balance rating. Note that there are separate experience costs \nfor raising path ratings and learning rituals and spells - \npath rating measures \npotential, but does not automatically convey knowledge of special applications. \nA mummy punished by the Judges of Ma’at may well have her Balance \nrating fall below her current Hekau path ratings. Her path ratings drop \naccordingly, and she must raise them again with experience. She doesn’t have \nto relearn spells and rituals rated too high for her new, reduced condition: She \ndoesn’t forget them, she’s simply unable to apply her knowledge until Balance \nand path rise again. \nCASTING SPELLS \nCasting a spell takes a single action. Make the challenge described for that \nspell; if it succeeds, the effect applies immediately. The Sekhem Traits required \nare spent whether or not the challenge succeeds. \nPERFORMING RITUALS \nRituals take more time. Each Hekau path lists the time required for its \nrituals. Performing one is an extended action and requires concentration. \nInterrupting the ritual to take other actions breaks the process and requires \nstarting over, as does suffering levels ofhealthdamage. Multiple mummies may \ncollaborate on rituals, dividing the Sekhem costs between them. Only one \nmakes the actual challenge, though, and the participants can decide which one \nputs in this culminating effort. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

There are some “almost Intermediate” effects \nnot available to those who just started studying Hekau, and some “almost \nAdvanced” effects likewise beyond those who’ve just acquired the ability to \nleamhtermediate effects.These effects are noted withapath rating prerequisite \nof 2 or 4, where appropriate. \nHEKAU AND ATTRIBUTES \nSome Hekau paths, such as Alchemy or Amulets, grant effects that can raise \na character’s Attribute Traits into superhuman heights. Such gifts do not come \nwithout a price, though. \nOne important note is that multiple enhancements cannot “stack)) or add \nto the same Attribute simultaneously. If you drink a potion that increases your \nWits-related Traits while wearing an amulet that does the same thing, only the \nhigher bonus applies; the two bonuses merely overlap. On the other hand, keep \ntrack ofwhere your enhancements come from. Returning to the same example, \nif your amulet is lost during combat, you still receive the benefits of your potion \n(until it wears off). The reverse is also true - \nif the potion wears off, your \namulet continues to work. \nAny bonuses gained are figured starting from normal human maximums \n(see Laws of the Hunt), not from current Attribute Trait numbers - \nagain, you \ncannot stack. This also applies to other supernatural or mortal beneficiaries of \nsuch powers. Most supernaturals or mortals cannot make use of many Hekau \nenhancements unless they have a Balance or True Faith rating of 3 or greater. \nMinions of Apophis possess a Corruption rating instead of Balance, which \nallows them to perform dark equivalents of the Hekau described below. No \nHekau can grant more than three bonus Traits to a single Attribute subcategory \n(Strength, Stamina, Appearance, etc.). \nIt is possible for a mummy to gain more permanent Attribute Traits \nbeyond the normal human maximum, but only through exceptional effort on \nbehalf of Ma’at, spending experience, the decision of the judges and the \ndiscretion of the Storyteller. \nALCHEMY \nAlchemy itself is neither a spell nor a ritual; it produces products that \nembody particular effects, or can create the effect in a target. Alchemists \nusually refer to their spells and rituals as formulas and discuss them in terms of \ntheir contents and preparations. An alchemist must spend at least one hour \nworking on a Basic formula, three hours on an Intermediate formula, and five \nhours on an Advanced formula.

In theory, one could develop alchemical formulas to work on \nsupernatural beings. This endeavor requires learning separate versions of each \neffect, and the alchemist performs them with an effective path rating of two less \nthan usual. In addition, the Judges of Ma’at frown on aiding enemies of Balance \nwith alchemical creations. \nFORMS OF THE ART \nThe alchemist must decide on the form a product will take before \nbeginning a preparation. Each form carries some advantages and drawbacks. \nSalve: A soft paste or lotion applied to the skin or surface of an object. \nThe individual handling a salve must be careful not to touch it directly, or it \naffects her instead of the intended target. \nEssence: A volatile gas or liquid that evaporates quickly upon exposure \nto the air. The target must inhale it or be caught in its cloud. Many alchemists \nprepare essences as perfumes, smoke or incense. \nPotion: A liquid that the target must drink.

It works on substances in magical ways. For game purposes, each \nalchemical operation has at least one of the following goals: \nIdentification: To understand a thing’s composition is to understand its \nstrengths and weaknesses, and, therefore, to know how to command it. Alchemy \ncan probe at things’ spiritual identities. \nTransmutation: The familiar goal of Alchemy in folklore; the reality as \nthe Amenti practice it is substantially more complex. Particular processes may \npurify a substance, convert it into another, or produce a hybrid result combining \nproperties of several components. \nCatalyzation: These processes use one substance to trigger changes in \nothers, without itself being significantly changed. \nDETERMINING SUCCESS \nAs noted above, Basic formulas take one hour to complete, Intermediate \nformulas take three hours, and Advanced formulas take five hours, which \nresults in one dose of the preparation.

While generally small, these effects \nmatter a great deal in some situations, and the player and Storyteller must work \ntogether to define specific effects. \nExamples of common Lesser Quiddity benefits include using willow bark to \nreduce wound penalties by one, using a piece of moss to add one Trait to the \ntarget’s total for survival and orientation challenges, and using a piece of lion’s \nmane to give the target a bonus Trait on Social Challenges involving command \nor courage.

The mummy can \nperform it anywhere there’s a modicum of quiet; these rituals call for no \nlaboratory or elaborate props. Celestial spells generally work within five \nminutes of casting. \nCelestial magic generally retests with Occult, unless specified otherwise, \nrituals use Static Mental Challenges, and the Attribute category is Mental. \nROLEPLAY ING WEATHER \nCelestial magic is easy to abuse. Storytellers must keep careful track of \nchanges unleashed with it, particularly when two or more groups share a \ncommon chronicle background. The Storyteller should reward detailed, nuanced \ndescriptions, and players who say “it’s windy” may find that they don’t get \neverything they want. Note too that it takes time for conditions to change, \ngiving warning to most people in the vicinity, and that it takes time for \npreexisting conditions to return.

It can interfere with ranged attacks and sight beyond 100 yards \n(more if the Storyteller deems appropriate). \nLight breeze - \nA gentle wind just strong enough to ruffle hair and \ndissipate odors. \nMinor temperature change - A slight shift in the local ambient \ntemperature, no more than 10 degrees up or down. \nFor more variations and effects, see the weather chart. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Such predictions are never very clear, and Seshet does not feel the need \nto make her writings easy to read or understand.

The great Biblical plagues were inflicted on \nEgypt, not in defense of it; Ma’at has accepted the justice of those ancient \nevents and therefore incorporated them into her arsenal of retribution. The \ncelestine must learn each of these rituals separately. \nEach Plague ofMa’at takes five hours to cast. It covers a single building, or \na larger area with the expenditure of additional Mental Traits: a city block for \none extra Trait, a neighborhood for two extra Traits, or an entire small town \nfor three extra Traits. It lasts for one hour unless otherwise specified. These \neffects are very frightening, and most people panic and flee the area. The \nresulting damage, panic and occasional loss of life gain the attention of the \nJudges of Ma’at - \nas well as other interested authorities who can recognize the \nunnatural -and the Amenti better have an ironclad reason why he has called \nup the plagues. \nWater to Blood: All water within the target area turns to cold, dead blood. \nPeople even weep and sweat blood. All water brought into the area suffers the \nsame effect, and the plague remains in effect until the next sunrise. The \nresulting blood has no nutritive value for either people or vampires, so \nindividuals in the area risk dehydration. \nBeetles: Flesh-eating beetles swarm out of the ground and over the entire \narea, devouring all flesh in the area. Even the undead, corpses and other \nsupematurals are not safe. Anyone covered in beetles suffers one level of lethal \ndamage each turn. The beetles are slower than people and very bad climbers, \nso Fair Escape is relatively easy once a target can move, and they flee from fire. \nLocusts: Swarms of locusts emerge from obscure comers and descend from \nthe sky to devour grain vegetables, fruit, bread and anything else vaguely edible. \nThey clog engines and fans, crawl all over people looking for crumbs, and \nobscure visibility. They force open cupboards and containers through sheer \nmass, and identify even the smallest openings to enter secured areas in search \nof food. This plague doesn’t directly inflict levels of damage, but it is profoundly \nunsettling. \nFrogs: Veritable torrents of frogs descend from the sky, many splattering \nfatally upon hitting the ground. The survivors hop madly in all directions. The \nfrogs exude a mild toxin that causes rashes on all who touch them, reducing the \nvictims to a maximum of one Appearancesrelated Trait for one full week. \nScorpions: Scorpions emerge from cracks and dark comers throughout the \narea. They’re easy to avoid, but if they sting a careless or unlucky individual, \nthey inflict one level of lethal damage per tum for three turns.

The troubled conditions of the Underworld make \nit potentially dangerous to the necromancer and others, but this doesn’t make \nNecromancy itself any less innately desirable. \nNecromancy rituals take 10 minutes for Basic effects, 30 minutes for \nIntermediate effects, or 50 minutes for Advanced effects, unless otherwise \nnoted. Necromancy spells generally have instant (or very shortly thereafter) \neffects. \nKeep in mind that this Hekau has nothing to do with the vampiric \nDiscipline of the same name, and knowing one offers no benefit toward \nworking with the other.

If her Mental Challenge is successful, it drives the ghost 5Oyards away, \nand keeps it that far away for the duration of the spell. The ghost can use ranged \nattacks and otherwise operate normally, and the spell works against only one \nspecified ghost per casting. (The necromancer can target other ghosts on later \nturns.)

If successful, he inflicts one level of aggravated \ndamage on the target, plus one for each additional Mental Trait spent. The \ntarget is also stunned and cannot act for the rest of the turn. Acting as a conduit \nfor this power has its cost: The mummy suffers one level of lethal damage for \neach level of damage done to the target, and his arm temporarily chars black. \n(Repeated use leaves permanent marks.)

The necromancer grasps the \ntarget by the face, which requires a Physical Challenge in combat situations, \nand spends three turns chanting arcane phrases. A resisting target can foil the \nspell by breaking the mummy’s grip with other Physical Challenges, forcing the \ncaster to start the procedure all over again. When the chant is complete (it \ntakes approximately three minutes), the necromancer makes a SocialChallenge. \nIf this spell succeeds, the necromancer draws out the target’s khaibit in a \nphysical manifestation: Black, viscous ectoplasm pours out of the subject’s skin \nand wraps his body in a slimy bundle. Once encased, the victim falls into a \ntrance in which he cannot act, move or use magical powers. Nor can he be \nkilled, until the khaibit prison is removed. The Embrace lasts until the caster \nchooses to end it, when some preset condition arrives, or when a counter- \nenchantment negates it. Any mummy who knows this spell can use it toremove \nthe Embrace, with the same difficulties and costs as were involved in its \ncreation. \nMANIFESTATION \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 5 \nSekhem: 3 \nThe necromancer performs this ritual while in the Underworld to manifest \ntangibly in the physical world for one hour. Her manifested body is solid, but \nhas the feel and consistency of liquefied jelly, with a shimmering-silver, \ntranslucent sheen. Mortals who see it suffer the effects of the Veil. The ritual \nrequires a Static Mental Challenge to be successful. \nThe manifested body is limited in effective Physical Traits to the number \nof Balance Traits that the necromancer has at the time. Bashing and lethal \nattacks, no matter how many levels they had normally inflicted, inflict only \none level of bashing damage, with the rest harmlessly splashing through the \nviscous form. Aggravated damage hurts the necromancer as usual, as do attacks \ndesigned to work against spirits and the dead. Any weapons and other items the \nnecromancer carries in the Underworld materialize with her and work normally. \nIf separated from her, they dissolve at the end of the turn. \nThe necromancer may also perform this ritual while living to make a target \nghost manifest, if she can see it before performing the ritual. It has the same \nadvantages and limitations that the necromancer would if using it on herself. \nSEPARATE BA \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nWith a moment’s concentration and a short incantation (and a successful \nMental Challenge), the mummy detaches his ba from his body. This spell works \nmuch like Separate Ku, except that the ba can go anywhere in the spirit world. \nIf the necromancer’s body dies or his soul is disrupted during this spell, he \nimmediately enters the death cycle.

The necromancer makes a tugging gesture \nand speaks a short word of command, then pits her mental power against the \ntarget’s will to remain a connected entity (make a Mental Challenge). If the \ntarget wins, nothing happens. On a tie, the defender suffers one level of bashing \ndamage and knows that something is trying to harm his connection with his \nbody. If the necromancer succeeds, the khu breaks and leaves the khat \nunconnected to its soul. The body falls into a coma, and needs medical \nattention to avoid withering away from malnutrition and other mundane \ncauses. The cut-off spirit functions normally in the Underworld; the necromancer \ncan try to control it, or let it find its own way.

It cannot be performed in a hurry, \nwhich does not allow for escape in the midst of combat. The necromancer \nvisualizes the destination, which he must have visited before or have seen \nclearly via some remote means, and channels his khaibit, letting it seize the \nUnderworld‘s substance and pull a Byway out of nothing (using a Static Mental \nChallenge). He then steps through, and the portal closes behind him. He can \ntake one traveler with him, plus another for each Mental Trait he spends; they \nmust be holding onto him as the ritual ends.

The mummy thereby \nremoves the sins and takes them into her own darker self. The mummy must \nmake separate challenges for each new sin. \nThe target no longer feels the intensity driving those dark urges. He is \nquieted and freed of the urge to act on them. Conversely, the mummy feels \nthem very strongly, and each significant step she makes toward fulfilling them, \nwhether literally or symbolically, grants her a Sekhem or a Willpower Trait, at \nthe player’s choice. The mummy’s greatest advantage is that she understands \nand controls her khaibit, and can transmute the eaten impulses into better \nones. For instance, the urge to kill a lover can instead become the urge to \nconfront, honestly explain difficult matters, and separate oneself from the \nlover. The mummy, as an outside party, has the freedom to pursue indirect and \nalternative strategies. \nIn theory, Sin-Eating could work on vampires, Spectres and the like, but \nmummies don’t feel inclined to risk the experiment.

The target dies \npeacefully, and its essence passes on without lingering as a ghost. The khaibit \nremains behind as a dark entity haunting the place of death. It functions much \nlike a spirit created by Separate Ka, though prone to malicious ends. Left to \nitself, the khaibit tries to injure and terrify the living, and attempts to steal and \ndevour sacrifices made to the deceased. \nThe khaibit remains vulnerable to necromantic compulsion and \nbanishment, with the opportunities and limitations created by the Separate Ka \nspell.

It uses \nOccult for its retest. \nNAMING THE BODY’S DESTRUCTION \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Variable \nSekhem: Variable \nIn addition to the unique individual ren that every thinking being \npossesses, generic ren describe each part of the body. This spell lets the scribe \ncombine one of those names with a word of targeting and a word of forgetting \nto make that part of the target’s body wither and disappear, with a successful \nStatic Mental Challenge. The difficulty and cost depend on the organ named. \nTrivial loss (6 Traits, 2 Sekhem): Applies to organs like ears, eyes, hands, \nkneecaps and the like. The victim suffers one level of aggravated damage, but \nthe loss is seldom fatal unless the victim was already close to death. \nSerious loss (7 Traits, 3 Sekhem): Applies to major organs like lungs, \nkidneys, the intestines and other significant chunks of organ tissue. The victim \nsuffers three levels of aggravated damage and needs medical attention to avoid \ndeath. Each turn, until medical help arrives, the victim must succeed in a \nphysical challenge, and failure inflicts a level of lethal damage stemming from \nthe body’s inability to function without the organ. Even once help arrives, it \nmay take a miracle or magic to keep the victim alive. \nCritical loss (8 Traits, 5 Sekhem): Applies to the heart and brain. The \nvictim suffers seven levels of aggravated damage, and most likely dies on the \nspot. If he survives, he must make the per-turn check described above for \nserious losses. \nThis spell bypasses armor and shields that aren’t specifically designed to \nstop spells, and it leaves no external wounds. The missing organ is just gone as \nif it were never there. At the Storyteller’s discretion, visible losses may cost the \nvictim one or more Appearance-related Trait, and have other appropriate side \neffects. A person with no knees, for instance, cannot stand without external \nsupport. \nNote that not all victims suffer equally. A vampire doesn’t need any \ninternal organs but its heart, and a jellyfish has no brain to lose. The Storyteller \nmay adjust critical losses down to serious, and serious losses to trivial, depending \non the specific circumstances. The spell affects only physical bodies, so wraiths \nand other spirits need not fear it. Naming the Body’s Destruction uses the \nMedicine Ability for its retest. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

She must have a sample of at least 50 words (at the \nStoryteller’s discretion), and the casting time may double or increase even \nmore for unusually complex, alien and dead languages. A successful Static \nMental Challenge gives the mummy an understanding of basic words and \nphrases. She may spend one Mental Trait for simple conversational fluency, or \ntwo for passable fluency. Note that the scribe also automatically gains the \nknowledge of the language’s term for ren she knows: If she knows the ren for \n“lion,” for instance, she can identify “lion” in the language she’s studying, apart \nfrom her overall mastery of it. This unusual ritual uses Linguistics for its retest. \nADVANCED NOMENCLATURE \nFORGETTING THE PERSON \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 30 \nThis is the consummation of the art of naming applied to destruction. \nWith a successful Static Mental Challenge, the scribe erases a person’s true \nname from the Book of Thoth. All trace of the person vanishes - \nmemories, \nrecords and all. Even those who were closest to the victim remember the now- \nvanished person with only the greatest of effort. This ritual certainly disrupts \nthe balance of the universe and costs the scribe one permanent Balance Trait. \nObviously, the Judges of Ma’at will be very interested to hear the mummy’s \nreasons for using this, and they had better be good ones. So far no scribe has \nfound a way to reverse the ritual’s effects. This ritual uses Occult for its retest. \nPTAH’S WORD \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 8 \nThis ritual marks the opposite end of the naming art from Forgetting the \nPerson, its full creative power. The scribe speaks the name of an inanimate \nobject of mass equal to or less than her own, and if the ritual succeeds (a \nsuccessful Static Mental Challenge), that thing immediately materializes in a \nspace touching her - \nin her hand, underfoot, or adjacent to her, but not inside \nanything or anyone else. Once it appears, as far as the universe is concerned, \nit’s always been there and therefore it cannot be dispelled like other summoned \nobjects.

      "text": "Rules are an integral part of any game; they define what characters can \nand cannot do. Only when confrontation does occur are rules necessary to \ngovern those situations. Still, the primary focus of this game is to tell a good \nstory. \nThere comes a time when two or more players come into a conflict that \ncannot be resolved through roleplaying alone. The system detailed in this \nchapter allows for the resolution of conflicts efficiently and quickly. This sort \nof face-off is called a challenge, and it makes for a simple system of conflict \nresolution. In most cases, a Narrator does not even need to be present when \na challenge is played. \nRoleplaying does not necessarily have to end when a challenge begins; \nin fact, roleplaying becomes more important than ever if players intend to \nenjoy a confrontation and avoid disputes. Experienced players can integrate \na challenge into their roleplaying so seamlessly that outsiders don’t even \nknow that anything unusual is going on. At the players’ option, special hand \nsignals can be used to indicate when certain Traits and powers are being \nemployed. \nIn order for this system to work, players need to work together. They have \nto educate each other on the rules and agree on what Traits can be used in a \nchallenge. Compromise and cooperation are the words of the game. Arguments \nover whether or not a particular Trait bid is appropriate wreck the momentum \nand the mood of a game. \nUSING TRAITS \nBefore you can begin to learn how challenges work, you must first \nunderstand what defines a character’s capabilities. A character is created by \nchoosing anumber of adjectives that describe and define him as an individual. \nThese adjectives are called Traits, and they are described fully in Chapter \nThree. These Traits are used to declare challenges against other characters or \nagainst static forces represented by a Narrator. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "INITIAL BID \nA challenge begins with a player “bidding” one of her Traits against her \nopponent. At the same time, she must declare what the conditions of the \nchallenge are - \nlike firing a gun, attacking with a knife or using Hekau. The \ndefender must then decide how she responds. She can either relent immediately \nor bid one of her own Traits. \nWhen players bid Traits against one another, they may use only Traits \nthat could sensibly be used in that situation. This restriction means that a \nplayer can generally use only those Traits from the same category as her \nopponent’s Traits. Most challenges are categorized as Physical, Social or \nMental, and all Traits used in a challenge must be from the same category. \nExperienced players may offer each other more creative leeway, but only by \nmutual agreement. \nIf the defender relents, she loses the challenge automatically. For \nexample, if she were being attacked, she suffers a wound. If she matches the \nchallenger’s bid, the two immediately go to a test. Those Traits bid are put at \nrisk, as the loser of the test not only loses the challenge, but also the Trait she \nbid for the rest of the evening. \nTSTING \nOnce both parties involved in a challenge have bid a Trait, they engage \nin a test. The test itself is not what you may think- the outcome is random, \nbut no cards or dice are used. The two players face off against one another by \nplaying Rock-Paper+Scissors. \nIf you lose the test, you lose the Trait you bid for the duration of the \nsession (usually the rest of the evening). Essentially, you have lost some \nconfidence in your own capabilities and can’t call on them for a while. You \ncan no longer use that Trait effectively, at least until you regain confidence \nin your Traits. \nThe test works like the moment in poker when the cards are turned over \nand the winner is declared. The test produces one of two possible outcomes \n- o n e  player is the victor, or the result is a tie. \nIn the case of a tie, players must then reveal the number of Traits that \nthey currently have available in the category used (Physical, Social or \nMental). The player with the IeastnumberofTraits loses the test and thus the \nchallenge. Note that the number of Traits you’ve lost in previous challenges, \nor lost for any other reason, reduces the maximum number of Traits you can \nbid in ties. You may lie about the number of Traits you possess, but only by \ndeclaring fewer Traits than you actually have -you \nmay never say that you \nhave more Traits than you actually do. Doing so allows you to keep the actual \nnumber of Traits you possess a secret, although doing so may be risky. The \nchallenger is always the first to declare his number of Traits. If both players \ndeclare the same number of Traits, then the challenge is a draw, and both \nplayers lose the Traits they bid. \nExample of Play: Ham& encounters a vampire attempting to drink from a \ncollege student outside a local coffee shop.

Looks like he’ll be going \nhungry tonight.. . . \nROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS \nhowever, they must explain what they are and how they are used. \nADJUDICATION \nIf you have question or argument about the rules or the conditions of a \nchallenge, you need to find a Narrator to make a judgment. Try to remain in \ncharacter while you look for a Narrator. Any interruption in the progress of \nthe story should be avoided if at all possible, so work out problems with other \nplayers if you can. If you do not know the correct application of a certain rule, \nit’s usually better to wing it rather than interrupt the flow of the game. \nIt should be noted that a challenger who fails on a Social or Mental \nChallenge must wait at least five real-time minutes before repeating the failed \nchallenge (and don’t waste them arguing over the results of the previous \nchallenge- you can’t protest aruling with aNarrator for 458, \nthendrop your \nargument and say, “Oh look, time’s up,”). This rule includes supernatural \npowers that use Mental or Social Challenges, unless they specify otherwise. \nA character cannot continue attempting one challenge after another until he \nfinally succeeds. This stricture does not include tests that are failed but then \nredeemed through retests or overbids. \nCOMPLICATIONS \nThere are a number of ways in which a challenge can be made more \ncomplicated. The basic rules are enough to resolve most disputes, but the \nfollowing rules add a few bells and whistles. \nNEGATIVE TRAITS \nMany characters have Negative Traits, Traits that can be used against a \ncharacter by his opponent. During the initial bid of any challenge, after you \nhave each bid one Trait, you can call out a Negative Trait that you believe \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "your opponent possesses. If he does indeed possess the Negative Trait, your \nopponent is forced to bid an additional Trait, although you must stilt risk your \none Trait as usual. If he does not possess that Negative Trait, you must risk an \nadditional Trait. You may call out as many Negative Traits as you wish during \nthe initial bid phase of a challenge, as long as you can pay the price for being \nwrong. \nIf your opponent does not have additional Traits to bid, then your Trait \nis not at risk during the challenge. Additionally, if you guess more than one \nNegative Trait that your opponent cannot match, you gain that many \nadditional Traits in the case of a tie or an overbid (see page below). The same \nworks in reverse, favoring your opponent if you do not have additional Traits \nremaining to match incorrect Negative Trait guesses. It is considered very \ncheap to list off which Negative Traits a player might possess, if you have no \nvalid reason to suspect as much in-game. \nExample of Play: Shadar, aMesketet, is in the middle ofbuttk with Intisar, \nan Amkhut cannibal cultist. He makes an initial bid (“I make u Ferocious attack \nwith this hundy rake!”), while lntisar kcides to return enmity fur enmity (“I’m \nNimble enough toget out ofthe way!”). S u r  thensuggests that Intisarpossesses \na particular Negative Trait (“I’m amazed you’ve stayed on this long - \nI thought \nyou would have retreated in your usual Cowardly fashion”). Shadar guessed \ncorrectly - \nIntisar does indeed possess that Negative Trait, and now she must bid \nan additional Trait (“Perhaps, but it’s easy to brave when I’m Quick enough to \navoid you”). If Shadar had been wrong, it would huve been up to him to bid an extra \nTrait to continue the challenge. \nIt can be risky to bid Negative Traits, but if you’re sure about what you’re \ndoing, you can raise the stakes for your opponent, possibly to the point where \nshe relents rather than risking additional Traits. \nOVERBIDDING \nOverbidding is the system by which powerful characters may prevail in \nachallenge, even if they lose the initial test. The elder with 16 Physical Traits \nshould be able to crush the whelp who has only three. This system is designed \nto make that possible. \nOnce a test has been made, the loser has the option of calling for an \n“overbid.” In order to call an overbid, you must risk a new Trait; the original \none has already been lost. At this point, the two players must reveal the \nnumber of applicable Traits they possess in the appropriate category, starting \nwith the player who called for the overbid. If you have double the number of \nTraits as your opponent in that category, you may attempt another test. As \nwith a tie, you may state a number of Traits less than the actual number you \nhave and keep your true power secret. Overbidding can be dangerous unless \nyou are confident in your estimation of your opponent’s abilities. \nExample of Play: Edward, a scholar from the Arcunum, suspects there’s \nmure to the new librarian than meets the eye, and he attempts to coax information \nfrom her. He begins with flattery (“My praise is so Beguiling that you ure suitably \nmoved to respond in kind to me”).

Beth loses her Dignified Trait, Edward loses his Beguiling Trait, \nbut he won the final challenge, and Beth is trying to figure out how long she can hold \nout against this nosy gent.. . . \nSTATIC CHALLENGES \nSometimes you may have to undergo a challenge against a Narrator \nrather than against another player. For example, a hacker may use a Static \nMental Challenge with the Computer Ability to break into another computer \nsystem. In such circumstances, you bid a Trait that is appropriate, then \nperform a test against the Narrator. Before the test is made, the Narrator \ndecides on the difficulty of the task that you are attempting - \nthis is the \nnumber of Traits you are bidding against, which is used to compare in the \nevent of a tie. The test proceeds exactly as if you were testing against another \ncharacter. Of course, you may attempt to overbid in a Static Challenge, but \nbeware, because the Narrator can overbid as well. The number of Traits \nattached to the challenge should represent the difficulty and danger inherent \nin the challenge. \nSometimes Narrators may leave notes on objects, such as books, doors or \neven magical items. These notes indicate the type of challenges that must be \nwon for something to occur (such as deciphering a tome or picking a lock). \nSIMPLE TESTS \nSimple Tests are used to determine if you can do something successfully \nwhen there is no real opposition. Most Simple Tests do not require you to risk \nor bid Traits, though some do. \nWhen a Simple Test is called, a test (Rock-Paper-Scissors) is performed \nagainst a Narrator. In most cases, the player succeeds on a win or a tie, \nalthough in some cases, it may be necessary for the player to win for him to \nreceive any benefit from the challenge. \nRETESTS \nCertain Traits allow a character to retest. A retest allows a character to \nignore the results of the first test and test again for a new result. Retests are \nmost commonly gained through Abilities, but other Traits may also provide \nthem; such Traits are noted in their descriptions. Expending one level of an \nappropriate Ability allows for one retest. \nMultiple retests are possible on a single challenge, but each retest must \ncome from a different source. A character may retest a challenge once using \nalevel ofBrawIand thenretest again through theMerit: Lucky (Bes’ Blessing), \nbut he may not gain multiple retests with the Bruwl Ability on the same \nchallenge. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Rebecca \nblocks the retest with Dodge (“That may be, but I’ll still Dodge you!”), and no \nretest is mude. Rebecca, still armed, has now got her back to the door and is trying \nto get out. \nRELENTING \nAt any time before the actual test is performed, a player may choose to \nadmit defeat. Characters who relent lose the challenge automatically, but \nthey do not lose any Traits, even if they bid one before relenting. They also \nhelp the game flow along more smoothly than extended Rock+Paper-Scissors \nmatches do. \nBONUS TRAITS \nCertain weapons and special powers grant a character bonus Traits \nduring a challenge. You may add these extra Traits toward a character’s total \nwhen determining a tie involving that weapon or special Ability. \nORDEROF CHALLENGES \nSince multiple challenges inevitably occur simultaneously during any \ngiven fight, the Narrator needs some means of determining who acts first and \nwho acts last. Each person involved in a given game-turn checks the current \nnumber of Traits appropriate to the action he wishes to attempt. A character \npunching someone uses Physical Traits to determine speed, while a character \ncasting a spell probably uses Mental Traits. If an action does not require any \nsort ofTrait challenge, it occurs last in the turn. As with overbidding, you may \ndeclare fewer Traits than you possess if you wish.

Group \nchallenges seem intimidating even to experiencedNarrators and Storytellers, \nbut these rules are meant to streamline the process and make such situations \neasier to resolve, rather than devolving into endless matches of Rock-Paper- \nScissors. \nFirst of all, find who is challenging whom. The easiest way is to count to \nthree and have everyone point to the person they wish to target that turn. If \nno one is being challenged by more than one person, then challenges are \ncarried out normally. \nIf one character is challenged by several targets, or tries to challenge \nmultiple opponents at once, resolve it in the following manner. First deal with \ngroups in the order of largest to smallest, just for ease of play. Each attacker \nmust bid an appropriate Trait as normal for the challenge required; logistics \nput a limit of up to five characters attacking another character at once. \nNext, the defender character must bid enough Traits to counter every \nopponent in the group; if he does not have enough Traits, he must relent to \nthe rest of his opponents (although he may choose which ones he relents to). \nResolve such relented challenges first - \nit is very possible that the defender \nmay fall before the rest of the group can act! \nFinally, the defender and any remaining attackers engage in one \nsimultaneous test. The defender then compares his sign to each of the \nattacker’s signs, applying the appropriate results.

The defenders \nand attackers lose Traits bid in any given loss. If the defender in the previous \nexample had bid one Trait against every attacker, he would have lost one \nTrait to the first attacker, and an additional Trait if he had lost the tie as well. \nOnce the tests have been made, they are resolved in the standard order \nof actions and initiative. It is possible for a defender to lose Traits to the first \nattackers and then lose a tie to an attacker later in the same mob challenge. \nThat’s OK - \nthe first attackers “softened up” the defender. However, unless \nthe defender has a special power which allows him to take multiple actions, \nhe may only attempt to injure one of his attackers, and it must be one who lost \na challenge. If none of the attackers lose, the defender simply suffers the \nresults of their actions. \nWhen the defender in a mob challenge uses Abilities or other powers to \ngain retests, each attacker’s challenge is treated as a separate test. Thus, a \ndefender needs five Melee Traits in order to retest against five attackers in a \nmelee combat. \nTIME \nTime inMind’s Eye Theatre works as it does in real life. It moves forward \ninexorably, relentlessly. For the most part, everything is played out in real \ntime, and players are expected to stay in character unless they have a rules \nquestion. \nIt is assumed that a player is always “in character” during the course of a \nstory. A player should never drop character when interacting with other \nplayers. Doing so ruins the atmosphere for everyone involved. Challenges \nmay be talked through, but a player is always considered to be active in the \ngame. If a player needs to take a break, he should inform a Narrator. That \nplayer should not interact with any of the other players while out of character. \nThe only other exception to the “in-character rule” is when a Narrator \ncalls for a “timeout.” This call may be necessary to resolve a dispute or to \nchange the scene if the story callsfor it. When“Timeout!” is called, all players \nwithin hearing distance must stop whatever they are doing until the Narrator \ncalls “Resume” or “Lay on!”Timeouts should be kept to a minimum since they \ninterrupt the flow of the story. \nCHRONICLES.

Each complete plotline within the chronicle is \ncalled a story. A session is just that: one actual night of play, although \nStorytellers may define a session as one night of game time if the action was \nleft inmediares at the end of the previous game.

If a session is to take place entirely at one \nlocation, a scene can then be defined as roughly one hour. \nTURNS \nTo keep everything straight when players start throwing challenges \naround or attempting complex actions, the time is right to start using turns. \nTurns are considered to last about four seconds, although this measure may \nvary from challenge to challenge at the Storyteller’s discretion. In any given \nturn, a character may take one action. Some actions may take multiple turns \nto complete, such as hacking a sophisticated computer system. Other actions, \nlike speaking a short sentence, do not use up a character’s turn at all. Once \neveryone involved in a turn has taken an action, the turn ends and another \nbegins. \nIn some instances a character may be interrupted before he can take his \naction, or be forced to respond to events developing around him. In such \ninstances, a character may always defend himself, although doing so uses up \nhis available action for the turn. \nIf a power affects a character for 15 seconds, it is assumed to be in effect \nfor four turns when turn-based time is in effect. In normal roleplaying, such \npowers work for their allotted amount of time. \nDOWNTIME \nMany aspects of a character’s unlife are critical to her continued \nexistence, yet they do not make for dramatic roleplaying, or they are too \nintricate to take time during sessions to perform. Storytellers are encouraged \nto use “downtime” between sessions to allow characters to maintain their \nholdings, learn Disciplines and see to other facets of their existence. Other \nactions and interactions may take place during this time, with Storyteller \nsupervision. As long as players don’t abuse downtime privileges, the time \nbetween sessions can be a rewarding roleplaying experience in itself. \nCOMBAT \nThe basics of combat are simple. As with any other challenge, the \nparticipants agree on the opposing possible outcomes, each player bids an \nappropriate Trait, and they perform a test to determine the victor. What \nfollows are the complications that distinguish combat from other challenges. \nThe most common outcome of a combat challenge is that the loser takes \nthe damage suitable for the attacker’s choice of weapon and supporting \nfactors, such as damage-enhancing magic. This isn’t the only possible \noutcome, however. The participants may agree that victory includes wrestling \nan opponent to the ground, or subduing a target rather than hurting him, or \njust about anything else that can happen in a fight. \nSURPRISE \nA player who does not respond within three seconds of the declaration \nof a combat challenge is considered to have been surprised.

It’s not \nwhispered or mumbled while looking in another direction, or hurriedly \ninterjected while the player is clearly in the midst of something else. The \nStoryteller has the final say in cases where players disagree about whether this \ncondition has been met. The Storyteller may also award surprise outright to \na sufficiently clever and suitable ambush - \nsometimes the target just doesn’t \nreally have a chance to detect it. \nIf the attacker achieves surprise, his target doesn’t get a counterattack, \nand the challenge merely determines whether the attacker inflicts his chosen \nharm or not. If the challenger loses this test, he may bid another Trait and call \nfor a second challenge. After this second challenge, normal exchanges \nresume. \nMOVEMENT IN COMBAT (THREE-STEP RULE) \nAnyone who has just entered combat or who is already involved in \ncombat is limited to three steps in any turn in which he wishes to attack. A \ncharacter taking a single step walks cautiously. Taking two steps means the \ncharacter is moving directly, and taking three steps means the character is \nrunning. In any case, the character suffers a -1 Trait penalty on physical \nchallenges that turn. An effect allowing the character to take an additional \naction allows him another three steps. \nFAIR ESCAPE \nThis rule provides a simple way for characters to escape from potentially \ndangerous situations. A player may call “Fair Escape!” upon noticing the \napproach of another player with whom he does not wish to interact, and may \nthen leave the area without being pursued. There are several limits on this: \nFair Escape does not let you evade someone within conversational \ndistance. Ifshe’s that close, you must initiate achallenge to flee. Conversational \ndistance may be farther than you can actually hear someone’s voice at regular \nvolume at the moment, if the environment is particularly noisy. \nFair Escape does not let you evade ranged weapons, or ambushes in \nwhich all the exits are blocked, or situations in which you’re surrounded. \nCommon sense applies here: There must be some place to escape to as well \nas notice of the impending attack. \nA character with invisibility or other concealing effects may call Fair \nEscape at any time before a challenge has been initiated, unless someone with \nmagical perception spots him. \nA character with supernatural speed may gain Fair Escape by activating \nthe speed effect before a challenge is initiated. If pursuer and pursued both \nhave supernatural speed, whoever has the highest level wins, and all ties go \nto the fleeing party. \nIn general, the longer and more convoluted an explanation of why Fair \nEscape should apply, the more likely it shouldn’t. This rule is intended to \nsimplify play, and the Storyteller is the final arbiter as to its applicability in \nany particular instance. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

The attacking player declares his \ncharacter’s action in some suitable way, like an emphatic “Bang !”or “Twang!” \nto match the nature of the weapon, and then goes over to the target and \nengages in a challenge. The target must have a ranged weapon of her own to \ncounterattack, until and unless she manages to close the distance. A target \naware of the attack before it happens, and with a ranged weapon of her own, \nis not considered surprised.

It may remain there to \ncontinue healing, or let Anubis lead it back to attempt a second resurrection \nchallenge to return to its body, subject to the usual penalties. \nRELICS \nMost of a mummy’s physical possessions stay in the material world. Those \nprepared with suitable Hekau make the transition with her across the Shroud. \nMuch of Egyptian religion and magic focused on this process, and mummies \nhave access to some of the world’s deepest lore and most sophisticated rituals. \nOther items, known as relics, also exist in the Underworld.

There are two ways to make the effort: Spend one permanent Sekhem \nTrait and make a Static Challenge of Willpower + Ba against eight Traits, or \nspend one permanent Willpower Trait and make a Static Challenge of \nSekhem + Ba. In either case, each success heals one level of damage, starting \nwith damage beyond Incapacitated. It takes five successes for a mummy who \nwas burned to ashes to reach Incapacitated, and she needs at least one more \nto be conscious. \nIf the challenge fails, the mummy must wait at least one full day before \nmaking another attempt. Each challenge requires the permanent sacrifice of \neither a Willpower or aSekhemTrait. In addition, amummy who makes more \nthan one resurrection challenge within a year loses one Attribute Trait for \neach challenge after the first. The Storyteller or Narrator adjudicating the \nchallenge decides which Trait is lost; in general, losses begin with the \nmummy’s weakest category and with any Trait that the mummy possesses just \none of.

Identifying violations is \nsomewhat subjective at the higher levels, and it takes good will all-around for \nthe game to go smoothly when high-Balance characters are involved. \nMummies with high Balance ratings need not be inert, vaguely benevolent \nnobodies. Indeed, Ma’at calls them to action.

Her lost Attributes return at \nthe rate of one Trait per day, in the reverse order of their loss. \nMUMMIES AND VAMPIRES \nFrom the mummies’ point of view, vampires are among the foremost \nservants of Apophis, doing a great deal to destroy the world’s balance and \nkeeping it in perpetual discord. Vampires see it differently. None of them \nhave even heard of Apophis except as a concept in Egyptian mythology. \n(Storytellers and players take note: Laws of the Resurrection does not claim \nto present “the truth about vampires, and should not be used as the definitive \nword in cosmological arguments in or out of character among vampires.) \nMummies who bother learning this much about the vampiric perspective feel \nthat it doesn’t matter much - \nvampires do the will of Apophis very well \nindeed, whether or not they realize it. And whatever the source of their curse, \nit’s an offense against Balance. Conflict ensues. A mummy cannot pal around \nwith any vampire without risking an offense against Balance, since the very \nact of feeding, which is necessary for vampiric survival, is a violation of \ninnocents. There simply isn’t room within the law of Ma’at for the Reborn \nand the undead to go out carousing or having adventures together. \nMummies can be ghouled just like mortals (see Laws of the Night, \nRevised Edition, p. 256 for details), which gives the ghouled mummy all the \nunusual benefits in increased Traits, access to some disciplines, and so on. But \nof course the mummy already has access to immortality and powers by her very \nnature, so the benefits of ghouling aren’t nearly as strong for mummies. \nMummies can also be blood bound, but the mummy who finds herself \ncalled to act contrary to Ma’at may draw on Strength of Conviction (see the \nbenefits of Balance). If successful, the mummy breaks the blood bond, and is \nimmune to any further bonds from that particular vampire. The vampire is \nseldom happy about the situation; the breaking bond resonates in his soul as \na massive counter-force against the Beast within him. \nMummy blood has unusual effects on vampires. Each Blood Trait that a \nvampire drains counts as two, reflecting the power within mummies, and it \ncosts the mummy a Sekhem Trait per blood Trait lost as her vital force gets \nsiphoned away. Each Blood Trait taken also gives the vampire one temporary \nHumanity Trait, as some of the call of Ma’at travels with the blood. It even \nworks on vampires who follow paths other than Humanity, dragging their \npath ratings down toward zero, and then building up Humanity until the \nBlood Traits taken from the mummy are all spent. \nWhile in this altered condition, the vampire suffers the consequences of \ncommitting sins appropriate to his new temporary Humanity rating. His \nmoral sense is greatly strengthened, which may come as a serious shock \ndepending on how he normally conducts himself. Any Humanity he loses \nfrom sins committed at this time remains gone even after the mummy blood \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

In this era when mummies \nare still brand new to the World of Darkness, vampires who encounter them \ntend to get very confused, and wild rumors circulate within Kindred \ncommunities. Storytellers should require players whose characters show a full \nunderstanding of the rules to explain just how that understanding came \nabout. Vampires who’ve tasted mummy blood usually develop a lovebate \nrelationship with the power and moral vision that the blood carries. Some \nvampires become addicted to the experience and locked into aself-destructive \ncycle of sinning and counter-sinning. That tragic end only reinforces most \nmummies’ conviction of vampires’ fundamental wrongness. \nA mummy drained of all her blood dies just like any mortal, and enters \nthe death cycle. In some cases, the vampire that did the deed is still suffering \npangs of remorse created by the mummy’s blood when the mummy returns for \nvengeance. A mummy cannot be Embraced.

Kuei-jin are not rushing \nto any fuller understanding of mummies more quickly than their Cainite \ncounterparts, and Storytellers should feel free to condemn the abuse of out- \nof-character knowledge among kuei-jin, just as among vampires. \nLIFE AS THE UNDYING \nMummies are truly alive, thanks to the Great Rite. They enjoy many of \nthe benefits and limitations of mortal life: They must eat, sleep and breathe, \nand their khat suffers when they fail to do so. They do not suffer from a curse \nthat makes them merely seem alive, like vampires, nor do they depend on a \nsupernatural rite that grants animation only to a corpse, like the walking dead \nor Risen. Mummies tend to have greater stamina than people who haven’t yet \ndied, and they have access to the potent magic in Hekau. They can also enjoy \nlife’s many pleasures, and have a sharpened sense of the importance of \nenjoying life. \nAGING \nMummies remain at the age they were at the end of the Second Life. The \nSpell of Life keeps them from aging. The only exceptions to this rule occur \nin the rare cases when tem-akh choose children to fuse with.

Tabletop games can \nreach incredible levels of cinematic virtuosity, with Storyteller and players \nworking in tandem to build engrossing and memorable stories. Even shy or \ninexperienced players can usually “tag along” with tabletop stories, and find \ntheir own niches to impact the plot. \nLive-action games, on the other hand, don’t work the same way, no matter \nhow intelligent and creative the Storyteller and players may be. There are too \nmany variables, too many “real people” mucking about in an open story \nenvironment with unpredictable outcomes, for stories to consistently encompass \nall players. In a live-action game, the Storyteller cannot be everywhere at once \nto herd the stories along the way she wishes, and less outgoing or creative \nplayers may find themselves struggling to stay involved with plots. \nThat’s not to say that live-action games don’t have their own singular \nappeal; players who want more freedom to act as an individual and not as just \n“one of the troupe,” players who revel in chaos and by the seat-of-your-pants \nsplit-second timing, drama queens looking for a stage toperform on- the high \npressure and intense first-person apotheosis of the live-action setting are real \nrushes to a lot of players. As a Storyteller, though, you’re going to have to \nchange your expectations of how a game “should” run when you’re making the \nswitch from tabletop to live-action, even though the core elements behind the \ngame (having fun and telling a good story) are the same. \nSo, in practical terms, how is live-action different from tabletop? \nTHE PROBLEM OF SINGULARITY \nWorking in the confines of a tabletop environment, you (as the omniscient \nStoryteller) can see everything that’s going on in your world. You are aware of \nthe characters’ movements and their dice rolls. Abilities and limitations are \nright there for all (particularly you) to see. As a result, it is near impossible for \na player to cheat without you or another player being aware of it. As well, since \nall action is occurring right before your eyes, you need not demand in-character \njustification for the acquisition of Abilities and information. You are already \naware of whether the character can legitimately learn or know something, \nbecause you control the scenarios. \nSo what happens when someone informs you that another player is grossly \ncheating, but you weren’t there to see it happen? Or when a player wants to \nlearn some rare and powerful Ability that she claims she learned from another \ncharacter months ago, but with whom you cannot check to verify her story? \nYou, as a live-action Storyteller, are going to have to make some very unpopular \nand difficult decisions, because you can’t know every exchange going on in your \ngame. There is no one brush you can paint every situation with; you will have \nto weigh every situation individually, using what you know of the people \ninvolved, and keeping the morale of your game in mind. \nIt is inevitable that you’re going to have to make factual and character \njudgments in situations like these.

You aren’t going to make everyone happy all of \nthe time; don’t even try to. All anyone can ask is that you try to be fair. \nCHEATING \nIn live-action games, cheating happens. Sometimes it’s unintentional \n(“Oops, I really didn’t know that power didn’t work that way.. . sorry!”). Other \ntimes, it’s intentional (“Um, no, I have 12 Brawl Abilities.. . really.. . the other \neight just haven’tbeen, um, added tomy sheet yet.”). Cheatingis anunavoidable \nbyproduct of the lack of an authority figure in play at all times; it would be nice \nto say that most players are honest, but it’s probably more accurate to say that \nmost players have honest intentiom but sometimes get caught up in the game \nand forget rule mechanics. The best way to approach these situations, as \nStoryteller, is to hope for and encourage the best in your players. But also be \nprepared to deal with the worst as impartially as you can. Your greatest allies in \nkeeping players honest are a good Storyteller-player relationship, sharp Narrators, \nand the players themselves to aim for high standards of roleplaying integrity. \nSometimes, in the case of new players who might not know any better, it \nis helpful to make a “reminder” announcement to the players before or after the \ngame, without naming specific players. That kind of subtle correction is all a \nStoryteller needs to do to give players a gentle reminder about the way certain \npowers or rules work, and it heads off any further misinterpretations. Never \nhumiliate a player in front of the other players, no matter how grave her offense \nmay be; if you feel she may be deliberately cheating, take her aside and speak \nto her privately. As well, give players the benefit of the doubt until proven \nguilty; slinging accusations without asking the player if she understands the \nrules results in hurt feelings and angry players, and in you gaining the reputation \nof being a petty tyrant. \nAnyone caught by a Narrator or yourself who is blatantly and consistently \ncheating should be removed from that session’s play and be given a stern, \ncourteous warning. If he persists in cheating, you may consider removing him \nfrom the game altogether, but that is a personal decision. Many Storytellers \ntolerate known “problem players” to avoid a bad reputation, but this toleration \nmay send other players the message that it’s okay to cheat, and the whole game \nwill begin to slide. Be firm, be fair. \nQWTIONABLE KNOWLEDGE \nIf a player comes to you and wishes to learn something strange or powerful \nbut there’s a question as to whether or not he is justified in learning it, don’t \nbe afraid to say, “Not right now - \nlet me consider it, and I’ll get back to you.” \nDo not let yourself be badgered/whined/flattered into agreeing to something \nthat later unbalances your game or makes other players perceive you as favoring \nthat player! If you have decided that the Ability/power in question is indeed \na possibility for your game, your next step is to talk with the player about how \nhe learned about it, whom he talked to, the in-character steps he took to learn \nit himself, and, if possible, check with any other players who were supposedly \ninvolved.

Rushing around trying to be everywhere \nat once just stresses you out and, in turn, stresses players out as you whiz by. \nThis point is where your Narrators come in.

It’s easy to see them as competition for your \nown storylines, but finding a way to weave them into your plots shows the \nplayers that their actions are having an in-game effect, and it makes the overall \ngame more interesting. \nAGAINST THREATS AND ANTAGONISM \nTabletop games naturally lend themselves to the troupe working together \nas a unit (albeit loosely sometimes) against a common enemy. This is mostly \ndue to the challenge that close physical proximity presents to being truly \nsneaky against your fellow players; how do you scheme effectively when other \nplayers can’t help but have an inkling of what you’re doing?

For some players, the thrill of competition with another \nreal person is why they enjoy live-action games in the first place. In conflict \nsituations, though, it’s particularly important to make sure that the rules are \nmeticulously followed. Players will usually (understandably) be grumpy if their \ncharacters are killed or otherwise inconvenienced by another player, but being a \nfair and impartial judge goes a long way to making sure hostility doesn’t linger. And \nit can smooth the transition if the player needs to make another character. \nPOWER LEVEL \nWhen you sit down to write the story for your live-action game, you’re \nprobably planning that your chronicle is going to span at least a year in real-time. \nIn that time, some of the initial characters are going to survive, growing more \npowerful with every experience point, especially if they are given benefits that \nlater characters won’t receive during character generation. Predictably, therefore, \nthe game reaches a point where the older characters are nearly “untouchable” to \nnewly generated characters. This gap in power levels can be very off-putting to \nplayers who wish to create new characters for your game, as they may feel they \ncan’t “compete” with the established characters. As well, the mightier the older \ncharacters become, the more difficult it is for you to come up with things that can \nstump them. An obstacle that might take new characters weeks to solve might \ntake an older character one scene, while an adversary designed to challenge your \nolder characters will probably obliterate the younger characters with little effort. \nPower disparity is one of the most devastating ailments in long-running chronicles. \nThere are several ways to avoid this: \nRamp the experience very slowly. Being stingy won’t make players too \nhappy, but it means they savor every experience point, and help to keep \neveryone advancing at a similar rate as the character base “turns over.” \nCap the characters at a set level of experience (like 100). They cease to \ngain experience for playing, but may continue as Storyteller characters. \nAutomatically retire characters at a set level of experience. \nRetiredcharactersneednot exit thegameentirely. They canstay on, ifthe player \nis willing, to be permanent or semi-pemanent Storyteller Characters, meaning that \nthey become extensions of your will - \nthey can help move stories along, mentor \nyounger characters, and take direction from you. They maybe helpful insteering away \nyoung characters from threats that would turn them into hamburger, or throw bait \nto them to encourage them to chase a plot. If the player would rather start a new \ncharacter, the old one can still make cameo appearances. It is up to you what power \nlevel youwant for yourgame, but keep inmind that suddenly droppingthe power level \nof a game is likely to make the players who are taken by surprise very unhappy. Plan \nout what power level you want your game to be at “cruising altitude,” and make sure \nthat all the players are aware of the limitations. \nIt’s also a good idea to design plotlines specifically for the “new” folks, and \nkeep the older characters so busy with their own super-scary plotlines that they \nhave no time to spend with the small fries.

The \nway you feel about the player can’t help but subtly influence your in-game \ndecisions, and sometimes it’s best just to avoid the situation altogether. \nBE CONSISTENT AND CLEAR \nThere is nothing wrong with changing how the rules work, but changing \nhow the rules work from session to session makes players go insane with \nfrustration! Decide carefully how you want any house rules to work, and if you \nabsolutely must change them again, stick with them for at least a few sessions \nbefore revising. Clearly explain all changes to the group before the session, and \nmake sure all “house rules” are printed, posted or otherwise available to your \nplayer base. Your players must be aware of all changes to rules before gameplay \nbegins, and rules should not be changed at every whim. \nBE PROFESSIONAL \nYes, Storytelling is a hobby, but you are also stepping into a role that carries \nwith it a mantle of responsibility. You are the primary role-model for your game. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

As well, \nyou are the lightning rod for any public interest your game can generate. \nAuthorities, from police toparents, may eventually come to you to inquire about \nyour activities. Maintaining a high level of honesty and integrity, both within \nand without your game, makes the red tape of your game easier (such as acquiring \nspace to play in), and allows everyone involved to feel more comfortable. \nBE OPEN-MINDED \nAs much as you may believe that someone is not playing their character well, \neven if you can point to game supplements or rules that support you in this, it is not \nyour place to tell them so. If you feel that someone does not understand the game, \nsimply approach him and politely ask him why his character is doing what he’s \ndoing (particularly if the character is going against what you see as a fundamental \ntenet of that character archetype). Perhaps he doesn’t understand the game system, \nor maybe he isn’t as versed in the World of Darkness mythos as you are. Helping \na player understand where his character might be coming from is preferable to flatly \ncriticizing. There really is no “right” or “wrong” way to play a character; there are \nonly actions and consequences. Dictating to someone exactly how to play his \ncharacter is futile and takes away freedom of individuality, and few players put up \nwith a heavy-handed or overly critical Storyteller for long. \nRELAXI \nStorytellers who are used to the clockwork-control that tabletop games offer \nsometimes suffer from Buttinski Syndrome (also known as “micromanaging”). \nThese Storytellers lose their cool when their main plotlines derail, or an important \nStoryteller character gets killed, or anything happens that they didn’t account for, \nand they often try to “railroad” players back into doing what they want them to do. \nIn a live-action setting, that kind of control leaves players feeling like puppets - \nit doesn’t matter what they do, the game is going to go the way the Storyteller wants \nanyway. Nothing is worse for a player than feeling powerless! \nRelax. Adapt. Roll with the punches. Isn’t that what you’re asking players \nto do every time the game starts? \nSTORY BEGINNINGS \nThere really is no practical formula for building a good story. If there were, \nall chronicles would have the same feel, and players would get bored. The \nstories you’ll be telling start with a core idea - \nyour idea - \nand evolve, \nbranching off and interweaving, changing and being reinvented. It can be \ndifficult to find the right note. Locking yourself into a story arc that’s overly \ndefined doesn’t allow players much ingenuity or creativity to make their own \nplots, but also having no idea where you want the chronicle to go frustrates \nplayers because they’re not sure what they should be doing. \nWriting a good story for your players requires a combination of set pieces \n(things that won’t change because they are necessary to the story) and shifting \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Sometimes they’ll miss the obvious clue you laid out in the middle \nof the floor, and other times, they’ll doggedly pursue minute details that you \nnever dreamed would become central to the characters’ actions. Either way, \nthat is all in the spirit of the game. \nLaws of Resurrection presents some unique twists on the live-action \ndynamic; even if you’ve run other games in the Mind’s Eye Theatre line, the \nAmenti will pose unusual challenges to your abilities. Not only are the \ncharacters challenging to play - \nsince the players must not only be thinking \nof who they were when they died in modem times, but also who they were when \nthe pyramids still gleamed white in the sun and the Sphinx was whole -but \nyou must also explore spiritual journeys, horrific enemies and foreign locations \nin detail, all while fighting the sense of stasis that accompanies characters who \nare unlikely to truly die. Make no mistake - \nthis game requires the highest \nstandards of integrity from your players, and careful and creative planning on \nyour part. This game setting can provide players the chance to explore the \ndelicious balance between death and life, corruption and purity, combat and \ncontemplation - \nthe choicest cuts of live-action play on one platter. \nTHEME \nStarting your game with a theme gives you a platform to branch out from, \nas well as a solid backbone that you can tie everything back to. Having a theme \nis useful to lend your game coherence, instead of a ragtag patchwork of unrelated \nideas cobbled together. This is not to say that the ideas in your game won’t appear \nunrelated at times; but you will know better as you can see the entire picture. \nSome Storytellers don’t need to consciously choose a theme to guide their \nchronicles, but for inexperienced Storytellers, having a baseline to return to is \nhelpful. When the inevitable Storyteller’s block strikes, remember the theme. \nHope, Redemption, Unity, Tragedy, Morality, Mortality, Corruption, \nRomance and Enlightenment are all examples. Theme isn’t a cudgel you whack \nplayers with; it’s more of an underpinning that supports the plots, tying them \ntogether and permitting them to flow smoothly into each other. If your theme \nis Romance, that doesn’t mean you have to try playing matchmaker for the \ncharacters. It could mean that when you were crafting the background, stories \nand setting of your game, you kept the ideas of love, sensuality and romance \nweaving through everything. From the singular central theme can branch off \nrelated ideas, such as unrequited love, love lost to time, the bonds between \nparent and child or spouses or obsession. \nIt is not necessary for players to identify your game’s theme at first, but it \nshould become apparent to them over time. If you feel that your chosen theme \nhas begun to stagnate, or has become too obvious, you can always change it to \nsomething different. Some Storytellers change the theme on a regular basis (such \nas every three months or so) to keep the game chaotic and unpredictable; others \nuse randomized indicators (such as Tarot cards) as inspiration for their stories. \nNearly any theme you wish to explore is possible in the world of the Amenti. \nThe complex nature of mummies affords you the ability to push your game to \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

It is absolutely integral that reminders of this perilous spiritual path, a \nmoral equilibrium that can be of life or death importance, be built into your \nplotlines and setting (at least as a subtle backdrop). \nMOOD \nCreating mood in live-action games is a passive thought process (when \npertaining to the particular manner in which plots are unfolded by the \nStoryteller) and an active physical endeavor (using props and venue as tools to \nprovide realism and evoke emotion). The physical aspect of mood is thoroughly \ndiscussed later in this chapter. \nMood is subtle. If theme is “What kind of story are you telling?” then mood \nis “HOW are you telling the story?” It’s the light in which you cast things. The \nsame basic story can be told a thousand different ways and prompt a different \naudience reaction each time. As a Storyteller, the way you choose to present \nyour story should depend on what players are looking for. You can’t please \neverybody, so having a couple of different “flavors” of mood is wise. Returning \nto the earlier theme of Romance, a mood of despair can set the stage for \nunrequited passions or lost opportunities, while a mood of change suggests new \nvistas and encouragement to take risks. \nAre your players looking for angst? Ferocity? Gritty realism? Idyllic fantasy? \nSome troupes thrive on horrific grotesquerie, while others prefer their stories to take \na more refined, neo-Victorian bent. Are your antagonists slavering psychotics or \nrefined masterminds? Do they prefer happy endings?These aren’t questions you can \nask of players without giving away too much of your plotlines, so play the sleuth. \nTake your cues from what the players themselves are attempting to do in downtime \nnotes or in session, and gauge the moods you wish to cast in that way. \nBe careful when exploring more gruesome atmospheres, however - \nsome \nplayers find fictional ultra-horror objectionable. When particularly lurid events \noccur in your game, you may wish to downplay the gross-out factor to players when \nyou aren’t sure they can stomach it. Some moods are not suitable for players under \na certain age. Use your best judgment, and if you know your game is going to delve \ninto extremely mature themes, consider putting an age limit on your player base. \nPLOT \nIn a book or movie, the plot is the static progression of events for the \ncharacters; that is to say, the outcome is the same every time you read the book \nor watch the movie. Not so in a live-action game. You create the landscape \nplayers move in, decide who (and what) they are going to encounter, craft \npuzzles for them to solve, and conjure rewards for the brave and crafty, but you \ncannot write or direct every step of the way.

The answer is obvious: \nStoryteller-provided plots are an external, unifying, ongoing challenge for all \nplayers, if they choose to involve themselves. Many, many plots in a live-action \ngame are player-driven, but having ever-present Storyteller plots hovering in \nthe background (and occasionally crashing everyone else’s parties) brings \nplayers together to work toward a common goal. \nSCALE AND SCOPE \nThe scale of your game refers to the physical size of your game (do you have \n300 players in an opera theater, or five friends in your living room?) and to the \nin-game time span (does the game encompass a few months of the characters’ \nlives, or a few lifetimes?). You need to be realistic on both counts. Having an \nenormous game may sound like a great idea, but how are you going to find a \nphysical venue that can support that many people? If in a public place, are you \naware of any laws regarding the gathering of groups over a certain size in your \ncity? How many players are you prepared to organize notes and bookkeeping- \nrelated paperwork for? \nImbuing your story with epic chronological proportions lends grandeur to \nthe chronicle, but can you make it run smoothly with a minimum of confusion? \nHave you thought about how to keep all players up to date with regard to where \nthey are in the timeline? Are you able to accurately represent historical details, \nif necessary? \nTwo main ideas you need to keep in the forefront concerning the scale of \nyour game are the number of players you as a Storyteller can realistically \norganize, and the number of players your plot(s) can handle without becoming \ntoo difficult. It’s best to keep your plots simple (in real-time) with a large group \nof players, while a smaller group of players can afford you more creative leeway. \nBalancing the ratio of players to plot complexity is a good way to keep your work \nlevel at a manageable average. That’s not to say that a large group necessitates \na simplistic plot; it means that keeping it simple will save you headaches. \nIf you haven’t run a live-action game before, consider keeping your initial \nnumber ofplayers to a generous handful. You can always open the game up later \nwhen you’ve got things firmly by the reins. Conversely, if you ever find you’ve \nlet the player scale run away from you and your game is sagging under the weight \nof too many players, cap new submissions until the equilibrium between game \nquality and game quantity is regained. \nThe scope of your game is less measurable than its scale. It is the amount of \nfree will you allow your players, or how long their leashes stretch. Do some of your \nplots require information gathered from remote regions of the world, or will the \ncharacters get everything they need to know from local sources? Are the \ncharacters able to influence global events, or is that beyond their reach? While \nyou have probably already laid down guidelines for yourself concerning the \nexperience ramp you’re going to give players, think about how far you will allow \ntheir actions to ripple, and whether or not you’re going to have storylines that \nreach across several continents.

If you choose to set your game \nsomewhere other than the Middle East, be aware that all mummies begin their \nexistence there, and they will periodically need to return there to recharge their \nSekhem. It might be easiest to set your chronicle in the Web of Faith, and make \njourneys elsewhere to be special plot elements, as opposed to setting your game \nin (for example) the United States.

They \nare ongoing challenges that keep the pace of the game reasonably brisk. \nExamples include dealing with antagonists, lost objects, quests for knowledge \nand other situations that can usually be resolved in one to 10 game sessions. It’s \na good idea to have two or three “active” at a time, to allow different types of \ncharacters to all get in on the action. While the overplot should not be focused \non one player character, it is perfectly acceptable to use character Merits, Flaws, \nBackgrounds and histories as springboards to launch subplots. Subplots are also \na great way to make sure some of the less splashy Flaws get brought into play. \nPlayer plots, or miniplots, are player-originated stories. They may only \nentail two or three players on a personal quest or mission, but they are often the \nmost emotional experiences for players. Often they don’t require Storyteller or \nNarrator interference at all, but sometimes actions are taken that require you \nto take some time out of the main game to describe what effects players’ actions \nare having. Miniplots should not be discouraged, but you can’t spend all your \ntime running mini-games and neglecting the game as a whole. The best way to \ndeal with these types of plots are to either let players work it out themselves (or \npossibly with Narrator assistance), or in the case of a particularly creative \nminiplot, pounce on it and tie it in to become a full-fledged subplot. You may \nrun into players who want you “all to themselves” all the time, but your \ncommitment is to the entire body of players, not the individual. \nHOW TO E L L  A STORY IN FIVE EASY STEPS1 \nAll cinematic (story) plots follow the same loose formula: Preparation, \nOpening, Climax, Denouement and Conclusion. Each stage need not occupy \nthe same length of game time, and sometimes the stages may seem to blur \ntogether. These guidelines offer a tried-and-true method of conveying events \nthat can be extremely helpful to live-action Storytellers. \nPreparation involves setting up the scene for the events to come, \nforeshadowing, and introducing the main characters, allies and foes. \nOpening involves going into character development more deeply, \nestablishing character relationships and building upon existing friction. \nClimax is, well, the climax - when those things that were foreshadowed in \nthe Preparation phase come into play, when the shot rings out, when the traitor \nis revealed, and when other traumatic events happen. Sometimes the climax \nis positive (winning a challenge, defeating a powerful foe), and other times it \nis negative (a murder, the destruction of a holy object). \nDenouement is the “cleaning up” section. Reactions, reparations, and the \nreordering of relationships and allegiances in the aftermath of the Climax. This \ntime is usually when the plot officially ends, possibly leading into another story. \nConclusion is when the moral or lessons of the story (if any) are made \nclearer in out-of-character and in-character discussion, and (if the story stages \nare being used in a session-based context) when players pack up and go home. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "STORYTELLING 101: THE CRAFT \nThe theories behind running a live-action game were discussed earlier. In \nthis section are the practicalities: things to consider or anticipate to keep your \ngame running smoothly, and the nitty-gritty realities of Storytelling a game. \nBEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE ... \nDo you have players interested in playing Laws of Resurrection? Have \nthey roleplayed in a live-action environment before? What kind of game are \nthey looking for? This game is challenging even for experienced players, with \nsporadic (but intense) combat and a strict moral code the characters must try \nto abide by, not to mention the smatterings of Egyptian mythology and \nterminology that are crucial to understanding the Amenti perspective. \nDo you have the time/resources to devote to Storytelling? Apart from the \nobvious few hours’ investment of a game session proper, live-action games \nrequire a lot of between-game work. This work includes the acquisition and \nupkeep of a venue from which to host the game, recruiting players, sitting down \nwith players to create their characters, planning the next phase of the story, \ndisseminating information (such as any setting/real-life venue changes and \ngame times), updating character sheets, answering innumerable player questions, \nand so on. Incumbent also upon a Storyteller are startup costs (a venue may \nrequire renting, character sheets need paper, props and so on). Realism does get \nexpensive! \nBOOKKEEPING \nNo person has a perfect mental database; you can’t just keep track of \neverything in your head. Running a game requires tracking and updating a \nmillion facts and details, and that simply isn’t possible without some serious, \nthought-out organization. You need backup and paper copies of every player’s \ncurrent and updated character sheet (for reference in case of dispute), and you \nhave to process downtime actions (the time between actual sessions), keep \ntrack of how experience is spent, correlate players’ actions against each other \nand the game world itself, and make any story or plot adjustments in reaction \nto player actions. A host of other small details can be sand in the gears of a \nsmooth-running game if you aren’t on top of it at all times. \nHow you choose to organize yourself is dictated by personal tastes. Some \nStorytellers use computer databases, while others shuffle everything around on \npaper. Whatever your filing system, establish it as much as you can ahead of \ntime, before the game begins to gain momentum. And save players’ downtime \nactions and your responses to them, to refer back to later if necessary. Many \nStorytellers have a computer backup of all their relevant information, and they \nbring paper copies of everything to the game. You may find that you have to go \nback to a player’s character sheet or note actions several times in order to make \ninformed, in-game decisions. It’s better to take a moment and be sure, than to \nmake a snap decision about a character’s abilities or resources that later proves \nto be wrong. Accept that you won’t be able to remember everything, and thus \nkeep the information at your fingertips. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Because of this constant altering, character \nsheets can quickly become unintelligible and confusing in later sessions. Save \nplayers the trouble of trying to remember what they have spent and what they \nhaven’t, or what information is now relevant to them, and provide them with \na new sheet each session. \nThe world engine of your game doesn’t grind to a halt between game \nsessions, and neither do the characters’ lives; so you should provide “downtime \nactions’’ to your players. These actions usually take the form of your players \nwriting you anote ofwhat they’re doing betweengatherings-what experience \nthey’re spending, who they’re talking to, what they’re learning, and the like. \nSome Storytellers give “carte blanche” to their players, allowing them to do as \nmuch as they like. More realismebased Storytellers divide the notes into a finite \nnumber of “actions” that the characters can perform in the given limited time. \nWhen your players try to spend their experience points, encourage them to \nexplain to you how they’re learning that particular Ability, especially if it’s not \nsomething that’s easily taught. Is it realistic for a scholarly bookworm to \nsuddenly teach himself Brawl? Likewise, is a thuggish mercenary type going to \neasily teach herself Performance: Dunce? If it doesn’t make sense to you, make \nthe player work for it. \nConvincing players to get their downtime actions to you by a set date can \nbe difficult, but it’s necessary for you to give yourself plenty of time to reconcile \nthe characters’ actions with the plot(s) and to incorporate any character \nchanges. Therefore, set a hard date that players must have their notes to you \nby (either paper notes or by email, for example) and stick by it. You owe it to \nyourself to not be racing at the last moment to incorporate stragglers. Players \nwill learn that if they want to spend experience they will have to accommodate \nyour schedule, not the other way around! It sounds harsh, but you can expect \nto spend between two and eight hours a week processing your game’s paperwork \nalone - the least they can do is get you their actions on time. \nVENUE \nThorough consideration must be given to the venue. First, is it going to be \nin a private home, or a public (or semi-public) location? Playing in someone’s \nbasement, for example, can give you wonderful options for set decoration, high- \ndrama roleplaying or music that might not be permissible in a public place, but \nit can still pose problems. Theft, damage, illegal activity and legal liability are all \npitfalls when playing in someone’s home; as well, in a more “intimate” setting, \nsome of the fundamental roleplaying rules (such as no touching) can easily be \nbent or broken. In a small game, with people you know and trust, this usually isn’t \na problem. But in a large game, these can be real issues. Private games are always \nmore intense, with all the good and bad that carries with it. \nPublic venues may make players feel that they are more limited with how \ntheir characters can express themselves, and your options for altering the physical \nscene are seriously hampered, but they can also provide a sense of safety for \nplayers, especially shy or inexperienced ones.

Do not frighten the non-garners! As well, coffee shops and restaurants \nusually require people to buy something; make players aware that if people do not \nsupport the establishment, you may be asked to leave. \nYour (usually) most expensive option is also the most popular: semi-public \nvenues, such as a convention center, warehouse space or university rooms. The \nfee for these places can range from a mere pittance (such as in the case of most \nuniversity rooms, if someone from that institution is willing to “sponsor” or take \nresponsibility for booking the space), to high-priced (such as in the case of a \nhotel convention room).

How are you going to reflect those \nthings in the physical environment that players are immersed in? \nOften, a few sensory “triggers” (such as sound, color or scent) are enough \nto give your venue the flavor it needs to draw in the players’ imaginations. Take \nphysical cues into consideration when planning a session. The easier it is for \nplayers to project themselves into a foreign frame of mind, the more “real” the \nscene seems. Lighting is the easiest variable, with the most impact; a few well- \nplaced soft lamps can transform a space from utilitarian to mysterious. \nPublic venues, as they cannot usually be substantially altered, work best as \nrepresentations of themselves. If your players are in a coffee shop, why not have \nthe characters be in one as well (albeit altered to reflect the World of Darkness)? \nThis makes following social etiquette with regard to other patrons much easier, \nas it’s unlikely the characters want to cause a scene any more than their players \nwould. In a semi-private place, you may have the option to play background \nmusic appropriate to the story setting, post things temporarily on the walls, and \nmove furniture around to suit the atmosphere you’re trying to create; it’s always \nbest to ask the proprietors of the location if you’re at all in doubt.

This is also \na good time to advise your players of any dress code you wish to apply to your game; \npublic and semi-public venues are not good places to have people wandering \naround in various states of undress, no matter how in-character it may be. \nCHARACTER CREATION \nCharacter creation is best done either way before a game gathering, or \nduring downtime. If you try to squeeze a character in right before the session \nbegins, you may get so flustered trying to get everything done in time that you \nfecklessly approve some unbalancing character that you only wail about in \nhindsight. It’s best to take a generous amount of time with the prospective \nplayer, especially if they are new to live-action games or Resurrection, to \nexplain the concepts and goals of the game so that they can come up with \nvibrant character backgrounds and strong plot-hooks that feed into the story. \nMake sure that each player has a firm grasp of any in-house rules and customs, \nas well as a working knowledge of the official rules. A hard-copy of the house \nrules, given to the player at character creation, go a long way toward heading \noff any disputes or confusion down the road. \nPLAYER DYNAMIC \nEvery game has its continuum of goal-oriented vs. story-oriented players \nwho have different ideas about what it means to play the game. To goal- \noriented players, it’s all about getting ahead, making progress, becoming \npowerful or influential - \n“winning” the game. For the story-oriented player, \nit’s about the drama, the emotions or ideas evoked by the situations in the story, \ncharacter growth, the rise and fall of character relationships - \n“playing” the \ngame. Goal-oriented players usually react very strongly (though not necessarily \nnegatively) to any loss or impediment their character suffers, while a story- \noriented player often shrug and grin, accepting it as just another new facet of \ntheir character’s personality. Naturally, being a continuum, most players fall \nin-between these two extremes, but it’s important to have a good grasp of what \nboth types are after so that you can fairly arbitrate the inevitable disputes. In \nwriting stories, mix and balance the two types if you can. \nCommon difficulties with goal-oriented players include: being a poor or \nvengeful loser; transferring in-character hostility out-of-character; trying to \ntackle obstacles too powerful for their characters to wrestle; cheating or using \nout-of-character information (metagaming); being overly argumentative (or \nwhiny or ingratiating); and rules-lawyering (finding technical loopholes in \nrules that permit them to abuse the system). In extreme cases, these people will \nturn on their heels and storm out of a game because their characters don’t get \nwhat they think they should have. What can you do?Talk to the player, explain \nwhy the situation is going the way it is, and offer suggestions or alternate \napproaches to the problem. Showing them a different road to reach the same \ngoal may fire their imaginations and renew their interest in the game. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Their characters may consistently \nfail, die, or otherwise become subjugated, while their players are baffled and end \nup shrugging, “But I was just playing my character.. . .” Often having a talk with \nthese players about how they feel about their characters’ demise, and encouraging \nthem to take less flawed characters, can help them find a balance between \ncharacter purity and success in the game. \nSTORYTELWPLAYER RELATIONS \nPlayers always have their own desires for the direction of the game, and \nstrive to make them reality, sometimes by callous or courageous moves they \nmay never have in “real life.” It’s up to the Storyteller to ensure that everyone \nis on a level playing field. Players trust the Storyteller to be fair and impartial, \nand whenever there is evidence to the contrary, it shakes the pillars of the \ngame, underminingplayers’ trust in their only real authority figure: you. It’s also \nyour responsibility to know the rules (both official and in-house) backward and \nforward, and to interpret the fuzzy sections quickly and fairly. A good Storyteller \nshould be able to talk to players and listen to their concerns without \ncompromising impartiality or making snap decisions - and if a mistake is made, \nto admit it and repair it quickly. \nYou need to be approachable; otherwise, people may shy away from talking \nto you about their concerns and ideas, and you will have no idea how they really \nfeel about the way the game is going. You may even become out of the loop of \nplayer miniplots. You will grow tired of some of the players’ complaints, but \nhandling the social aspect of your game diplomatically is part and parcel of \nbeing a good Storyteller. There is never a good reason to be rude to a player, and \nthat kind of behavior alienates people from your game. \nPlayers sometimes take the game too seriously and become personally \ninfluenced by things their characters are involved in. It’s great that they’re \nbecoming so engrossed in the game, but when in-character interactions begin to \nhave serious effects on players’ real lives, the Storyteller should remind everyone \nthat it is just a game. Like any fun recreation, it can be easy to give roleplaying \nmore impact on your life than it ought to have. As the Storyteller, it’s up to you \nto spot players who might be taking the game too seriously, and nip it in the bud. \nIf the chronicle begins to interfere with work, school and other social activities, \nit’s time to pull back and take a good look - \nthis goes for you too! \nEXPERIENCE \nExperience points are very important to the advancement rate of your \ngame.

It will give you a good indication of how quickly your game \nis progressing and let you tweak the tempo. Handing out experience like nougat \ncandy at Halloween may make your players happy in the short term, but it dulls \nthe game in the long run if their goals are too easy to achieve. \nSome Storytellers prefer to award experience publicly, having other \nplayers vote during the game’s wrap-up (with players’ backs turned) on who \nthey enjoyed roleplaying against the most that session. Others ask for player \nfeedback in downtime notes. The advantage of asking for immediate player \nopinion when giving roleplaying experience is that the evening’s adventures \nare fresh in everyone’s minds, and it can be a wonderful perk to particularly \nenthusiastic players to get that kind of instant, and public, gratification at the \nend of a session. However, thin-skinned players may not like the competitive \nfeel that this kind ofvoting can foster. Talk toplayers about whether they prefer \npublic or private experience recognition, and use their majority and your \ncommon sense to make the right decision for your game. \nAmore detailed list ofopportunities to award experience, at your discretion, \ncould look like this: surviving the game session; strong roleplaying with regard \nto Nature, Demeanor and Archetype; excellent costuming or attention to \ndetail; player honesty above and beyond the norm (or being a “good sport”); the \nconclusion of a storyline; and possibly for helping WithNarrationduties. When \nyou give roleplaying bonuses, popular acclaim is a good start, but not all players \ndo their best acting in public, and just because someone is popular or loud or \nflamboyant doesn’t mean that others shouldn’t be rewarded for playing a more \nsedate character properly. \nDon’t forget the catchall phrase, “Because I feel like giving it.” But when \nawarding experience for “personal” reasons, be wary of accusations of favoritism, \nand give this kind of “because you’re nifty” experience sparingly. Also, if you \nare in the habit of awarding experience points publicly, awarding experience \npoints under the table is generally not a good idea. Secrets are difficult to keep \nin a live-action game setting, and this kind of shady experience “dealing” can \ncast you in an unflattering light if your other players find out, especially if it’s \nmore than just one or two people. \nNARRATORS \nNarrators are Storytellers’ best friends. They are extra eyes, ears and brains, \nand work closely with them to play special Storyteller characters, act as scene \narbiters, and generally take some of the stress of trying to be everywhere at once \noff the Storyteller. Anyone being a Narrator has to have a good grasp of the rules \nof the game, both official and in-house. A Narrator also has to be reliable, as he \ntakes on some of the responsibilities of a Storyteller. There is no limit as to the \nnumber of Narrators your game can have, but a good ratio of players to Narrators \nis between five and 10 to one. One caveat about working with Narrators is that \na Storyteller must go over what she wants for the game, and it is imperative that \nthe Storyteller keep the Narrators informed on a regular basis in order to not have \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Narrators who aren’t clearly \ninformed about what it is you want from them from session to session are of no \nhelp to you, and will probably feel frustrated that they aren’t sure what they’re \nsupposed to be doing. Narrators should be visible as such, whether they’re in \ncostume as a Storyteller character or not. Name tags with “Narrator” on them \nwork well to identify your roaming deputies to players, though in smaller games, \nplayers usually learn who the Narrators are in the course of play. \nOne dilemma you’ll have to wrestle with in choosing Narrators is whether \nthey will be functioning player characters with a stake in the plotlines, or are \nthey fringe-dwellers, acting as Storyteller characters or as an extra hand for you. \nOf course, if your Narrators are also players, they have to tread carefully to avoid \nusing information that they may have gleaned from Storyteller interaction. \nThey might make decisions that unfairly benefit their own characters. Because \nof this potential for corruption, it’s important that Narrators who are also \nplaying their own characters be of high and unquestionable character. \nKEEPING THE FISH HOOKED \nIt’s not enough as a Storyteller to present the game to players; the game has \nto be interesting, captivating, thrilling, challenging, engaging and a host of \nother adjectives. In short, you have to make players want to play the game. \nInevitably, no matter what you do, you’re going to have players complain of \nboredom (which usually means that they’re not sure what their character \nshould be doing). Don’t gnash your teeth in frustration, aching to show them \nhow many plots are happening right under their noses that they’re seemingly \nunaware of. Accept that you can’t please everyone all of the time, and just do \nyour best to make the game unpredictable and fun. That’s not to say that all \nplayers who make this complaint are crackpots. What you have to determine \nas a Storyteller is whether there is validity to the cries of “I’m bored!” (maybe \nit really wasn’t such a good idea to create a game around that year’s tax laws), \nor whether those players, for whatever reason, are not as involved with your \nplotlines as they might like to be.

Amenti have few reasons to congregate each \nweek in the same way that vampires gather for Elysium or changelings meet at \nthe freehold. You may also have problems with finding players -perhaps you \nhave only three players interested in Resurrection, or the troupe currently \nenjoys their Ascension chronicle too much to pick up something else for a \nwhile.

In a \ntechnical sense, Qetu and Saatet-ta are female, though such pedantic physical \ndistinctions mean little to creatures never meant to spawn. \nFor centuries, the Apepnu occasionally aided the vampires known as the \nFollowers of Set.

Some Amenti believe it’s merely a ruse to fool the \nunwary, while other wonder if some enmity has arisen between Apophis and \nhis once-favored servant, or if the Bane mummies have spumed their creator \nfor Apophis. \nThe path of resurrection is similar between Bane mummies and Amenti, \nexcept that when they are killed, Bane mummies do not face the Judges of \nMa’at; instead, their soul plummets directly to Apophis’ hellish abyss, to be \nspewed forth again to the physical plane when needed.

In addition to these culinary sacrileges, he also \nsated his gruesome hunger for forbidden flesh with his own slaves.

He believes this \ndemonstrates his greater evil over the “weaker” twofold Tutu. \nIn his obsession, Kharebutu developed a necromantic rite that allows him \nto graft the arms of corpses onto his torso and animate them, giving him four \ncombat-effective limbs. These appendages enable him to add an extra four \nTraits to any physical action involving his arms or hands (consider him to be \nambidextrous - \nhe suffers no penalties for using an “off’ hand), and while \nKharebutu suffers no damage if any harm is done to the ritually grafted limbs, \nthey may be severed by an appropriate successful attack (the equivalent of two \nlethal health levels per arm). \nQETU THE EVIL DOER \nIt is whispered that Qetu was once unmatched in outward charm and \ninward depravity. Acting as dancer and whore in the Pharaoh‘s court, she \nruined many key officials with her planned temptations and subsequent \nscandals, all in service of Set. Now, Qetu acts as the femmefatak of the servants \nof Apophis, working upon the carnal weaknesses of her targets. She has been \nresponsible for the demoralization of several mummies over the millennia.

To this end, she \nsometimes tries to affect an air of culture and gentility, but due to her base \nnature it never lasts - \nshe invariably slips into the most vulgar language of \nwhatever culture she’s currently infiltrating. Unlike most Bane mummies, \nQetu seems beautiful at first glance; however, as with all Apepnu, the reality \nof her appearance is anything but. Qetu “wears” the necromantically animated \nskins of beautiful young women, and spends much of her free time browsing for \nher next “outfit.” Her true visage is that of a putrefying, corpselike hag. If this \nmask is discovered, Qetu whips off the skin and uses it like a cloak to distract \nand ensnare foes. When she is using her discarded skin as a distraction, all \nopponents wishing to strike her suffer a two-Trait penalty, and if she makes a \nsuccessful Physical Challenge against a victim, she may ensnare them with the \nflayed skin.

Her skin is blackened and cracked like a dry riverbed, and \nher sparse hair is coarse and gray. She has been known to use Hekau to veil her \nform in an imitation of her lost beauty, but no illusion can hide the mad gleam \nin her eyes. \nSaatet-ta’s Hekau paths are one level less than the other Bane mummies, \nand her form provides her no special abilities.

He chanced any \ncurse or punishment to steal the riches from the dead pharaohs’ tombs, and he \ncleverly overcame evendifficult obstacles and traps. Although he was eventually \ncaptured and beheaded by the authorities, the priests of Set admired his brazen \nthievery and they resolved to steal his body. They sewed his head back on and \nperformed the Rite of Rebirth, and now Tutu serves Apophis as warrior, thief \nand saboteur. Finding it advantageous to keep up with the times, Tutu suffers \nno Ability restriction concerning modern conventions. \nTutu’s neck has been collared with a heavy golden cuff, which attaches his \nhead to the spine from which it was severed. Tutu’s control over his khaibit is \nso strong that he can force his torso and head to separate, animating both his \nbody and his head with evil intent. While his khaibit possesses his trunk, Tutu’s \nhead and spine are free to slither around like a grotesque skeletal snake, each \npart able to function independently of the other. Tutu effectively doubles \nhimself, becoming two distinct characters, each with full Traits and normal \nhealth levels. While his head-spine is more difficult to hit (gaining a two-Trait \nbonus to all uses of the Dodge Ability), it may take no actions requiring manual \ndexterity or manipulation. His body portion, on the other hand, suffers a two- \nTrait penalty to actions involving perception, as the khaibit can only “feel” out \nits surroundings. If either part of Tutu is destroyed, the other instantly expires \nas well, and his soul descends to Apophis for punishment. \nTHE REAPERS \nKharebutu, in his demented experimentation with human corpses, stumbled \nupon the secret of binding an evil ifrit into a cadaver, thus animating it in a \nlimited version of the Rite of Rebirth. In this way, Reapers (also called Asekh- \nsen) were born.

With every \nnew possession by an ifrit, the corpse takes on even more of the mutations and \ndeformities that come with the corruption of the flesh, until it is barely \nrecognizable as once being human. If the Reaper dies a fifth time, it cannot rise \nagain. The Asekh-sen’s time in Hell, between lives, is dictated by treating the \nnumber of jars the Reaper has left as the equivalent of its Ba Background rating. \nOf grim importance to the Amenti and the primary reason why reapers are \nsuch tenacious foes is that by placing the correct physical parts of a deceased \nmummy in one of its own repaired canopic jars, the reaper gains another chance \nat life, without further ifrit taint and decay. This chance to end the suffering \nof their continual decomposition, and to renew their existence permanently, \ndrives reapers to prey on newly reborn Amenti while they are still disoriented. \nReapers, for antagonist purposes, possess all the random Traits and \nAbilities of a beginning character, though Storytellers may wish to assign them \nmore Bonus Traits if they need to be beefed up. Reapers take only half-damage \nfrom firearm or bashing attacks (unless it is a called shot to the head).

They are \nessentially normal humans, inasmuch as normal humans practice ritual \ncannibalism. When the Amkhat prepare a corpse properly, they can gain \nincreased strength and a smattering of the victim’s memories, and so they \nbecome a little more than human with every victim they devour (though the \ngains from consuming humans disappear with time). This gain is not without \nconcurrent risk, however. The gradual dementia and degeneration from those \ndiseases common to cannibal cultures also plagues the Amkhat, which is a \nserious drawback when the benefits can be so temporary.

Instead, they prefer to attack the Amenti \nindirectly, through treachery, cunning and subterfuge. \nA typical cultist has normal human Traits, and Trait concentration/ \nAbilities are based on where that person moves in society (a diplomat would \nhave high Social strengths, while a soldier would have high Physical strengths). \nWillpower: 2-5 \nCorruption: 1-5 \nAMKHAT POWER ANTHROPOPHAGI \nBy ritually consuming a corpse (human or mummy), cultists may imbue \nthemselves with a portion of their victim’s power and abilities.

An Amkhat’s level in Anthropophugi is equal \nto their Corruption rating, and they may gain the benefits of Anthropophugi up \nto and including their level, though they must choose one per victim (i.e., an \nAmkhat with a Corruption rating of 2 cannot consume both the hands and the \neyes of one corpse, but he may choose either). The Storyteller is the arbiter on \nthe specific boons gained; the Amkhat may not choose what Gifts they are \ngiven through the use of this power. \nAfter the corpse is devoured, the Amkhat must perform a Simple Test. \nShould she fail the test, she is immediately plunged into a bout of madness that \nlasts the rest of the scene (success or a tie has no ill effects).

The vampire acquires blood from mortals, most often through \nbiting, which induces an unnatural pleasure in the victim. A Blood Trait can \nbe used to activate a vampiric power, gain one Physical Trait for ascene, or heal \nlevels of bashing or lethal damage. A pint of human blood equals one Blood \nTrait. Drinking a pint of Amenti blood grants the vampire two Blood Traits. \nBecause vampires are essentially walking cadavers, bashing damage has \nlittle to no effect. Vampires can heal two levels of bashing damage with one \nBlood Trait, or one level of lethal damage. Vampires do not age and rarely suffer \nfrom non-magical disease or poison. Because of their static nature, if a vampire \nis scarred or cosmetically altered one evening, she automatically reverts to her \nformer appearance when she rises next. \nA vampire usually has a small array of supernatural powers. These are the \nlegendary powers, such as the strength of 10 men, command of animals, \nwolflike claws, the ability to cloud people's minds or control their emotions. \nVampires with no Blood Traits cannot access their supernatural powers. Some \nvampires even have supernatural speed at their command, allowing them to \ntake extra actions during combat. \nThe teeth and claws of a vampire inflict aggravated damage. \nVampires, no matter what age they might be, are subject to insane rages \nand wild passions, some moreso than others. If a vampire is threatened with \nsomething it fears or is denied blood when in a state of hunger, it must make \na Mental Challenge; failure means it flies into a supernatural rage, and must \neither attack the source of its rage or flee. The vampire suffers no wound \npenalties during frenzy, but it cannot attack except by brawling. The frenzy \nceases when the source of the vampire's fury is dead, removed, or the vampire \ncan attempt Mental Challenges once per turn in an attempt to snap out of it. \nIf a wooden stake pierces a vampire's heart, that vampire becomes \ninstantly paralyzed. An attacker trying to stake a vampire must succeed in two \nSimple Tests after winning a Physical Challenge against the victim. If the \nstaking is successful, the vampire cannot move or use his supernatural powers \nuntil the stake is removed. \nVampires cannot function during the daytime. Daybreak causes an \nirresistible lethargy in the undead, and if one should be so unfortunate as to be \ncaught outside, the sunlight ignites the vampire and she bums to cinders, \ntaking one aggravated level of damage every turn she is exposed until final \ndeath. An immolated vampire must also test for frenzy. As a general rule, \nvampires sleep all day unless extreme emergencies arise. \nVampires can emotionally enslave humans. If a vampire feeds a living \nhuman one Trait of its blood, on three separate nights, the human becomes an \nobsessively loyal servant. The vampire blood also gifts the human with a \nmeasure of the vampire's power; a ghul, as such slaves are called, may renew its \nStrength-based Physical Traits once per day at no cost. Ghuls do not age as long \nas they drink at least one Blood Trait of vampire blood once per month. \nNot every vampire retreats from the sight of a holy symbol, such as the \nMogen David, the cross, the crescent, holy water or similar things, and most do \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Some may \nchange their skin into a serpent’s, granting them some resistance from damage. \nThe most powerful can wholly transform themselves into 10-foot-long black \ncobras with a venomous bite and lashing coils. \nHASHASHIN \nThere have long been rumors of cults of assassins, or “hashashin”, \ncongregating in the lands around the Web of Faith.

Most tales describe \nthem as a cult of insane, ravening vampires that is ruthless and fanatical in its \ndesires.

The ghost spends a \nWillpower Trait, and ghost and target go to a Willpower Challenge.

For the purposes of Resurrection, you can assume \nthe following: \nA shapeshifter has three forms: a human, a normal animal and a hybrid \nbattle form. In battle form, the shifter doubles its normal human Physical \nTraits, and when it strikes with claws or teeth, it can inflict aggravated damage. \nIn animal form, the shifter has amazing, superhuman senses and all the physical \ncapabilities of that animal - \na cat would be able to see in dim light, a serpent \nwould be able to slither into a crevice to escape or bestow a poisonous bite - \nbut it can only inflict lethal damage. In its battle form, the shifter causes normal \nhumans to lose their senses with fear, as per the Veil. Most times, humans will \nblock the encounter from their minds or find rational explanations for what \nthey saw. \nShapeshifters heal rapidly; they can repair one non-aggravated wound \nlevel every turn. \nLegends claim that shapeshifters are vulnerable to certain materials such \nas silver, gold, cold iron or salt.

Treat these no differently than a vampire’s frenzy. \nThey can utilize various spiritual abilities, or Gifts, to perform supernatural \nfeats.

They have a strong self-preservation instinct, probably because their \nonly hope at survival is to avoid coming before the Judges of Ma'at in the \nafterlife, and they are unlikely to expose themselves to danger for anything but \npure self-interest. \nISHMAELITES \nWhen Osiris bade his son Horus and the Shemsu-heru to ritually sacrifice \nthemselves, some of those priests refused. The first to leave the group was \nnamed Ishmael, and so all others that followed became known as the Ishmaelites. \nTheir resurrection is based on an imperfect version of the Spell oflife, and their \nwillful disobedience of Ma'at has condemned them to forever skirt the eyes of \nher Judges lest they be found wanting. Still, despite their prodigal nature, the \nremaining Ishmaelites are old and knowledgeable, and the Judges of Ma'at have \neven suggested that the Amenti would do well to seek some of their arcane \nknowledge, lest it be lost forever. The Ishmaelites are unlikely to reveal \nthemselves casually, however, especially in light of the millstone of shame that \ntheir cowardice has forever hung around their necks, and the hostility the \nAmenti have often shown them. \nCAPACOCHA \nLong before the pyramids rose from the sands, the peoples of Tawantinsuyu \n(western South America) sent their beloved dead into a cycle of rebirth, much \nas the Egyptians would. What are considered to be the first examples of \ndeliberate mummification came from what is today Chile, where the Children \nof the Seal (called the Chinchorro by archaeologists) once lived. They hunted \nsea-mammals and fished, and their lives were filled with ceremony. \nBefore 5050 BCE, amawtas (will-workers) of the Chinchorro stuffed their \nrevered dead with herbs and grasses, packed them in raw (unfired) clay, and \nthen sculpted a detailed new body, complete with facial features and genitalia, \nover the decaying one. The bodies then were dried under the sun (as it never \nrained in the desert) and the awawtas chanted the spell of Going Westward to \nthe Sunrise over them, preparing the mummy for Rebirth. These mud- \nmummies were called Pachamallki, and they returned to the living at intervals, \nlying stiff and still until called on by the amawtas to aid their descendants. \nWhen they returned to life, they told tales of their new lives beyond the grave, \nand exhibited strange powers to which no others had access. While not in the \nliving world, the illi (spirit) of the mummy traveled the Realm of Pacarina \n(called the Dark Kingdom of Obsidian by later ghosts). \nThe Children of the Seal continued this way of life for over 3000 years, \naided and accompanied by the relatives they had made immortal. As their \nculture spread and changed with the coming of corn and potatoes, the amawtas \ninstructed the nearby people, the Chimu, to carry on their tradition.

Some mallki even attempted to \nremain with the new tribes permanently, enthralled by the wisdom and \nsophistication of the Maya even as they were repulsed by the penchant for ritual \nsacrifice and torture. When the Incan Empire firmly established itself, it \nbrought together under one rule the peoples of the desert, the jungle, the sea \nand the mountains, and became known as Tawantinsuyu, or the Land of the \nFour Quarters. Naturally, this conjoining spread the arcane knowledge of the \nmallki to everyone in the Inca nation. \nThe jungle peoples of the Amazon created Uchumallki (fire mummies) \nwhich were smoked and rubbed with preservative balms. They were called to \nlife just as the other mallki, and their command over fire and smoke made them \nvaluable guardians in the rainforest. The Incas also created mummies, and in \nkeeping with the ritual, the mightiest of their leaders were “sent westward.” \nThese Inca mummies were the Chaskimallki (messenger mummies). They \nwore gold masks and were housed in ceremonial buildings befitting their \nstation, many of them sent westward in sacrifice as youths, so that neither age \nnor misfortune could rob them of their vigor. These were chosen to atone for \nthe “royal sin” or capacocha, which has since become the name for all mallki. \nOver time, the tradition of the Capacocha grew forgotten and neglected, \nand when the Spanish invaded in 1529, the frantic summonings of the people \nmet with little success. Many of the mallki had lain in slumber for so long they \ncould not be awakened. Those few mummies who rose to the task were quickly \nfelled by the conquering Spanish, and it seemed for a time that the secret of \ncreating mallki was lost. \nOf late, the turbulence of the Dja-akh has roused the illi from their \ncenturies-long slumber, and they have now remembered their duty to protect \ntheir descendants. The spirits of the mallki struggled to return to life to discover \nthat the ritual of Going Westward did not make them as completely immortal \nas previously thought. Their spirits lived on, but they lacked the strength to \nanimate bodies that had all but dissolved by the ravages of time and neglect. \nApparently, being periodically roused by their living relatives was vital to \nkeeping the preserving magic fresh. The Capacocha had to find new amawtas \nto restore their crumbling bodies and return them to life. \nThere were a few scattered descendants and relatives of holy men and \nwomen still living in western South America, and these few, through dream or \nspirit-talk, became aware of the illi and their wishes. These mortals moved \nswiftly and quietly to recover what of their ancestors they could - \nthat which \nwas not destroyed by time or snatched by well-meaning archaeologists. Over \ntime and with increasing skill, they managed to rebuild the bodies of their \nmallki, and recovered just enough of the Ritual of Going Westward to call the \nilli forth to inhabit them once again.

Changes to \nthe landscape and climate - \ncoupled with human interference - \npresent a \nhost of dangers. Despite all efforts to get around the problem of the destruction \nof the orignal body, none allow the mallki to live as before. As their human cults \nwere scattered and their bodies destroyed, the mallki lost hope that they could \never return to the Living Lands. But recently, things began to change. \nYears of diligent research by a few rare amawtas garnered rumors of the \nAmenti, which was supplemented by illi sojourning in the Underworld. The \namawtas believed that they might be able to perform a ritual similar to the Spell \nof Life, one which would use the ritual of Going Westward as a base and fuse \nilli with the spirits of those strongly tied to the living world. The only other \nchoices would be to use the Egyptian spell or to succumb to death - \nneither \nwas an option for the proud spirits of the Andes.

Only time will tell if the Amenti encounter these new immortals and join \nwith them as compatriots of Ma’at, or if the Teomallki are a new sort of Bane \nmummy that revels in the gore of sacrifice. \nTeomallki characters create no differently than Amenti - \na newly \ndeceased meets with an ancient soul that offers a return to life. The body \nbecomes animated and takes the two souls where they can find the completing \nmagic. Instead of the old illi (like an Amenti tem-akh) replacing a small part \nof the hosting spirit, the two spirits combine in a shared relationship, with the \nmost dominant aspects of each showing through. Dominant need not mean \naggressive or violent, though - \nsimply those traits that are strongest in each \nspirit. The Teomallki retains a fairly clear memory of his First Life, but the \nSouth American ritual does not allow for the complete return like the Spell of \nLife. By way of a Strength, the Teomallki receives Memory x 3, and for Liability, \nhe gains the Flaw: Lesser Resurrection. \nTeomallki bodies begin to age after a number of decades equal to their \nSamapa (Ba) rating and eventually they will die like any other aging mortal, \nwhereupon the spirit goes to sojourn in the Underworld. The corpse does not \ndecay, though, instead entering a stasis like Amenti. On the next resurrection, \nthe body returns to the physical age it was when the mallki died in its First Life \n(and as many mallki were often young, this is not as terrible as it sounds). The \nTeomallkimay also return like an Amenti, rather than waiting to be summoned \nby the living. Should the corpse be destroyed, the Teomallki suffers like the old \nCapacocha and cannot return at all. \nTHE M7u T’IAN: WARRIORS OF THE TAO \nThroughout history, the philosophers and mystics who followed the \nteachings of Lao-Tzu and his disciples sought to create perfect harmony within \nthemselves in order to come to a greater understanding of the essential unity \nbetween life and death. After the tyranny of the Qin Dynasty, which resulted \nin the persecution of many great sages, followers of the Tao studied many \ndifferent paths in the hope of attaining a state beyond the cycles of life and \ndeath - \nperfect physical and spiritual immortality. Some achieved a state of \nnear-agelessness in the mortal realm, but a few others actually gained the ability \nto cycle between the Middle Kingdom of mortal humans and the spiritual \nrealms of the Yellow Springs, the Dark Kingdom of Jade, much like the \nShemsu-heru of Egypt. A handful of the greatest of these mystics ascended to \nbe with Lao-Tzu in Heaven; they became known as the Eight Immortals, \npatrons and advocates of those who followed Heaven’s ways. \nThese are dark times for Heaven. The August Personage of Jade has \nabandoned his throne, however, much like Osiris left the Amenti, and now \nthere are whispers of a coming Demon Emperor who seeks to rule paradise. The \nEight Immortals have been forced to leave Heaven, as they have no emperor \nto serve, and they face the coming of the Demon Emperor with calm, steadfast \nresignation. They have undertaken not to engage the Abyss directly (the force \nof corruption the Amenti call Apophis), as that would surely be futile suicide. \nInstead, they have decided to preserve whatever purity they might in the face \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

They turned to the \nlast 200 sages of the Tao, weakened though many of them had become, to \ngather from among their students those who might best represent the ancient \nway of Heaven during the coming time of chaos and blight. To each of these \nstudents, young and na‘ive as many of them were, the Eight Immortals gave the \nelixir of eternal life in return for their unending devotion to the Tao. These new \nimmortals have been named Wu T’ian, the family of Heaven. \nOnce the student drinks the elixir, she is taken, body and soul, to the gates \nof Heaven where the Eight Immortals waited. After suitable contemplation of \nhow she might best face the coming perils, the Wu T’ian is given a quest by the \nEight Immortals. This quest could take place in the Middle Kingdom, the Yin \nor Yang Worlds (the Shadowlands and the Middle Umbra), or it may even take \nher to the farthest stinking reaches of Yomi, the Thousand Hells. The nature \nof the quest is variable and could be anything from standing guard over the \nSpring of Eternal Yang, to escorting someone safely back to their home. Once \nthe quest is complete, the Wu T’ian returns to the gates of Heaven for a period \nof rest and contemplation, before being given another quest. Should the Wu \nT’ian be destroyed while on a quest, her body and soul return to the gates of \nHeaven for a period of reflection before being sent to complete the original \nquest, or she may be handed another one entirely. \nTHE E N  HEAYENLY PRECEPTS \nThe Ten Heavenly Precepts are the concepts each Wu T’ian tries to \nmaster as he continues his journey through the universe. They need not be \nacquired in any particular order, but should the Wu T’ian act consistently in \na way that goes against the Precepts, he could lose a part of his Quest Trait \nrating, which represents the Wu T’ian’s alignment with the Way of Heaven. \nThe Quest Trait rating functions the same way Balance does for the other \nmummies, and loss of this rating affects the Wu T’ian just as adversely. At \nStoryteller discretion, the Wu T’ian may have to master Gentle Deeds before \nhe can master Honest Speaking, particularly if the Wu T’ian character has \nproblems with shooting first and asking questions later. \nThe Ten Heavenly Precepts are: \nCompassionate Dealings \nThe purpose of the Wu T’ian is to protect the TenThousandThings under \nHeaven, and though they acknowledge a need for balance, members of \nHeaven’s family must never overlook those who are in need. Masters of this \nprecept seek out those whose need is greatest and undertake to deliver them \nfrom their crises. \nGentle Deeds \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Although Yomi has its place in the balance of all \nthings, the family of Heaven opposes the Demon Emperor by speaking truth in \nthe face of lies. Those who master this precept know that truth must be spoken \nat all costs. \nHumble Mind \nThose who follow this precept show no favoritism toward themselves, and \nknow that they exist to serve until the end of the Demon Emperor’s reign, and \nask only to serve as well as they can. The masters of Humble Mind act knowing \nthey serve only a small part of the protection of the world, and they never \nexpect praise or reward. \nJust Decisions \nFor those practicing Just Decisions, there can be no unfair or vengeful \nthought or action. The masters of this precept are the most right and just of \nbeings. \nKeen Observation \nThe Observant has achieved a state of disciplined watchfulness. She will \nnot act hastily; she always observes a situation as fully as possible before taking \naction. Many Wu T’ian who have mastered this precept spend several hours a \nday just observing the world around them, watching for signs of the Demon \nEmperor. \nOuter Harmony \nBy safeguarding places of solace and harmony, the immortal ensures that \nsome of the beauty of the world survives the Age of Sorrows. Those who have \nmastered this precept work tirelessly to protect that which otherwise would not \nsurvive. \nPassion for Learning \nKnowledge is a potent weapon and a source of great enlightenment.

Respecting life does not mean \nsacrificing one’s own, however. Followers of this precept are free to eat and \ndefend themselves and their charges. \nSolitary Heart \nThe family of Heaven must remain detached from individual ties if they \nare to save what can be saved from the Demon Emperor.

And Sherry always \nsaid yes, because it was better than going home to Mother, who would \ncomplain about being alone all day, but who refused to get a pet (smelly, \ndisease-carrying), or visit the community center (bunch of old people there), \nor get a job (her health was “poor”). So she stayed at work until her feet were \nthrobbing, waiting desperately for the last stragglers to get out so she could \nfinish the work that everyone else left behind. \nSherry checked her watch - \nthe last bus would be here in five minutes. \nThe street was deserted, so she decided to skip walking up to the crosswalk and \njust cross in front of the store. If she missed the bus, that would mean a very \nlong and scary walk home, and Mother complaining about her inconsiderate \nnature in not calling her if she was going to be late. She hiked her tote bag up \non her shoulder and stepped out into the street.. .. \nThe next thing she knew, there was silence. Nothing around her. No \ncars, no buses, no street noise. Just her and the wind. And a bird, sitting on \nthe broken thing lying in the gutter. \nSherry’s mind raced with confusion. She was dead? But it felt like- \nwhat? You couldn’t say that your heart was racing or anything like that, not \nwhen your physical body is roadkill. All she knew was that part of her was \nlying in the road, and somehow she was standing over her body, looking at the \ngrotesque angle of her neck and one arm, at her legs twisted the wrong way. \nAnd there was a bird sitting on her body. \nThe bird looked up at her, and then it spoke to her, “Hello. I’m glad I \ncaught you before you left. I was hoping to ask you something.” \nShe couldn’t think of a thing to say to that. The bird cocked its head and \ncontinued, “Don’t you want to know what it is?” \nSherry still couldn’t find her voice. All she could do was nod dumbly. \nThe bird went on, “If someone asked you what you did with your life, \nwhat would you say?” \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n“I ... I went to school, I took care of my mother, I worked-,” \nshe \nmanaged to choke. \n“Is that all? Is that how you want to leave your life - \nbarely lived, \nwithout pleasure or even a duty you wanted to attend to?” The bird-spirit \npaused to let her consider this, then it said, “What if you could have another \nchance, another life? What if you could go back?” \n“HOW can you promise that?” she whispered, watching helplessly as her \nbroken body was searched by two street thugs looking to steal anything worth \nhaving. They didn’t seem to notice the bird, nor did it notice them. \n“Let me stay with you, and I’ll show you how,” the bird said. \nSherry considered its words, especially “a duty you wanted to attend to.” \nWas there such a thing? She suddenly wanted to find out more. She \nsummoned every ounce of bravery and said, “All right. What do I do?” \nThe bird fluttered up and wrapped its wings around Sherry’s face, as if \nembracing her head, and she felt the presence of someone else in my mind. \nShe flinched and tried to shake it free, but the bird-spirit silenced her: This \nis the beginning of it. You have a journey to make now, one that will forge your body \nfor the work ahead. \n0.. \nWhen Sherry emerged on the other side, she was standing in a barren, \nashy landscape under a leaden sky. A river quietly meandered nearby, and a \ndark shrouded figure waited in a reed boat. It looked like all the pictures she’d \never seen of Charon on the River Styx. The new spirit her whispered that this \nwas an Aken- \none of the boatmen who guideed the dead in Duat, the \nUnderworld - \nand that she should go with him, that he understood where \nshe must go next. Sherry nervously approached the Aken and cleared her \nthroat. \nHe turned to her and removed his hood. She couldn’t guess how old he \nmight be -he had iron-gray hair cut in Roman fashion, and his skin looked \nleathery as if he’d been out in the desert sun for years. His eyes were deep and \nstern, but also kind. He helped her into the boat, then started poling along \nthe water. In the distance, she heard screeches, wails and strange noises that \nshe couldn’t identify. The strangeness of everything would overwhelm her, \nbut for the voice of the ba. This is Duat - \nyonder is the sound of the Dja-akh, \nthe great spirit-storm - \nyou must speak with the Judges of Ma’at before you can \nre turn. \nThe Aken spoke little during their travels, but he answered Sherry’s \nquestions when she had them. He told her about the ghost-storm, about the \nruinedcities theypassed. After a while, they pulled up to asandy shore. Sherry \nstarted to get up, then nearly choked when she saw what was approaching - \na man in a linen skirt and jeweled collar with the head of a black jackal. The \nspirit whispered quickly: Anubis, the guide of the dead. He’ll take us where we \nneed to go. \nAnubis was a silent guide across the cool sands toward the shadowy \nmonoliths in the distance, but Sherry wasn’t sure she wanted to know what his \nvoice might sound like. As they approached the first great shadow, in the half- \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nlight it revealed itself to be a temple complex of ruins - \nstone pillars, mastabas \nand shrines that looked familiar. The next destination is a long corridor into the \nearth, built with huge stone blocks. Down the hall was darkness, a pit of inky \nunknown waiting for her. Without waiting to see if she would follow, Anubis \nstarted forward, and she stumbled after him, right into the darkness. \nSuddenly, her guide was gone, and she was alone in the dark. The only \nlight came from a guttering torch nearby. Which way should she go? What \nwas she supposed to do? When faced with a situation she couldn’t fathom, her \ninstinct was always to stand still and wait for something to happen. But the \nspirit burning in her refused to let her be led by the hand: Don’t you want to \nknow what happens next? Don’t you want to know more? \nSherry took the torch from the wall and started down the corridor, the \ndarkness hemming her in on all sides, except for the light that encircled her. \nWhenever the fear started to overwhelm her, the spirit in her cajoled and \nberated her onward. Movement caught the comer of her eye. She turned and \nthe torchlight illuminated brilliant colors - \ncarnelian red, malachite green, \nlapis blue, gold leaf. There were figures of queens, pharaohs and gods made of \nthose colors. She recognized the figures of Isis and Osiris, and a great feeling \nof reverence washed over her. \nShe continued onward, but still watching the beautiful hieroglyphics \nunfold their story on the wall, telling the tale of Osiris and his treacherous \nbrother Set, of Isis hunting down her husband’s tom body to rebuild him, of \nthe warriors called the Shemsu-heru who were created to serve Horus and his \nfather. The hieroglyphics grew more familiar - \nshe realized she could even \nread some of it, or perhaps the spirit was translating for her. The story was \nabout a temple dancer, called Tia bint-Sef. She was the daughter of a pharaoh \nand a concubine. She could never be a princess because of her birth, so she \nwas consecrated to the gods. She learned the sacred dances of the temples and \nthe not-so-sacred dances of the court, and in all her ways, she was considered \nbeautiful. She was loved by many because she listened to those who came to \nher with grief and worries, and by her listening and comfort, she took their \nburdens onto herself. Even her father loved her for her listening ways and for \nher dancing soul when his spirit was tired. When Tia died, her father had her \nmummified and placed in his own tomb with goods and companions to \ncomfort her until he came. \nSherry paused for a moment to study the story -her \nown, she realized \n- \nand heard strange music from further down the corridor. It sounded \nwonderful - \nin a primitive sort of way - \nand she hurried ahead to see what \nshe would find. There was a tableau in one of the chambers, as if a show was \nbeing set. Sherry stared, then blushed and started to turn away, but the spirit \nbecame forceful and made her turn back. This is your past, your First Life! This \nis where you came from. This is who we are. Her guide would not let her shrink \nuntil she looked fully upon this now-shared past.. \nThe scene was of cool marble floors and alabaster walls, the drifting scent \nof perfumes, and fine linen hangings. There was a party of men and women, \nmost wearing close to nothing because their linen clothes were nearly \ntransparent. Many wore thick black wigs and golden jewelry. Sherry let her \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\na jeweled collar and a slave bangle on her left ankle, and her hair was in a top- \nknot from which dangled a red ball on a silver ribbon. She danced to music \nthat sounded vaguely familiar. It was plucked strings, drums, sistrums and \nflutes. No one from the group could take their eyes from her. Her body was \nstrong and beautiful. Sherry wondered, Was I really like this? The only answer \ncould be yes. The strange ache grew more powerful, and tears came to her eyes. \nHer guide asked what was wrong and suddenly, without thinking what it \nmight say, she blurted, “I want to be that! I want to be strong and beautiful \nand not afraid of anything!” \nPerhups you will be, when we finish our journey. \nSherry finally emerged from the darkness of the tunnel to find Anubis \nwaiting for her. He said nothing, but led her toward another chamber. The \nspirit told her this was where they would meet theJudges of Ma’at, where they \nwould decide if the match of Tia and Sherry was right and whether she could \nreturn. The torch was taken from her, and she stepped into a vast hall. She \nwas aware of many eyes on her. She felt compelled to look up, and she was \nstruck by their facial expressions - \nstern and cold, but fair. Most looked \nhuman. The rest were like nothing she had ever seen - \na synthesis of animal \nand man and history that the scribes of ancient Egypt could have never \nimagined. \nSherry didn’t remember everything they said, but she could not forget \nthat they pointed out every sin she had ever committed until she wanted to \ncrawl into the sand and die. Worst of all, they said, was that she lived in \nconstant fear of rules and “authorities” who were neither gods nor kings, but \nwho held the same sort of power over her. She had no defense. She knew she \nhad did wrong in their eyes. But then a kinder judge spoke. The match \nbetween the spirit and her was agood one. It had the potential to be more than \njust a return to life, but a return to something better. That judge thought that \nshe could be more if she just understood what she never had. \nThe final judgment was made: “Tia bint-Sef, you are thereby judged fit \ntoreturn to the living world to seek that which youshrankfrom in yourwasted \ntime. Relearn your passions, seek out new vistas of thought, and in doing so, \nserve Ma’at by bringing your passion to a world hungry for just that.” \nSherry couldn’t remember how she returned to the living world - \nsomething about Anubis taking her out of the judges’ presence and pointing \ntoward a bright spot on the horizon, and- \nSuddnely, she awoke, swaddled in scented bandages that covered her \nface. She tried to tear at them with hands as bundled as mittens, and there was \na flurry of voices. Someone restrained her while a man’s voice soothed her, \n“Easy now. We’ll have these off you in a moment.” \nAnd with a click of scissors, the bandages fell away from her body, and \nsuddenly Sherry was staring into the faces of a group of people who were \nwearing linen robes like the priests and nobles of her first memories. An old \nman with a shaved head smiled at her and made a gesture of greeting. \n“Welcome back, daughter of Isis.” \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCredits \nWritten by: Bruce Baugh, Kieran Dewhurst, Conrad Hubbard and Alan I. \nKravit \nDeveloped by: Cynthia Summers \nEdited by: Allison Sturms \nPreviously published material has appeared in: Laws of the Night, Laws \nof Ascension \nArt direction by: Aaron Voss \nArt by: Laura Robles \nMakeup by: Dawn Emanuele and Joe Talacko \nLayout and typesetting by: Aaron Voss \nMind’s Eye Theatre design: Mark ReinOHagen, Ian Lemke and Mike \nTinney \nWorld of Darkness created by: Mark ReinOHagen \n0 2002 White Wolf Publishing, \nInc.

Whether it was \na ballad of a hero’s latest exploits or a cautionary tale about dealing with the \nhidden creatures of the world, storytellers were a valued part of the community \nas teachers and entertainers. And tale-telling was hardly a passive art - \nthe \nstoryteller relied on his audience for reactions to his tale as he spoke. How else \nwould he know if they were enjoying the story, or if they were bored? \nTime marches on, and technological developments began to change, \nand interfere with, the storyteller’s art. Books (and the spread of literacy) \nmeant that someone could simply read a story whenever he liked, instead of \nhunting down a storyteller to tell it. Radio and TV remade the storyteller into \nan impassive creature that did not encourage audience participation or \nfeedback. Stories were still told, and in great quantity, but they were largely \nsterile, nonliving things. \nThen we come to the 1970s, and the era of roleplaying. A group of players \nsits around a table, listening to their leader describe scenes of dank dungeons \nand dark cities, and they choose which path to take next. At one of these \nsessions, someone gets the idea to start standing up, moving and thinking as \nhis character might. Over time, more players do the same, creating what will \nbecome known as live-action roleplaying (or LARP). In fact, this “new” \nentertainment was a return to the oldest - \nthe leader was the storyteller, \ntaking his listeners on a new journey. And the listeners responded in kind by \ntaking on the roles of the characters in the story and by telling this new tale \nto the storyteller, the other player-listeners and themselves. \nWHAT IS MIND’S EYE THEATRE? \nThis game is probably unlike anything you have played before. In many \nways, it’s not really a game, because it doesn’t have the usual trappings of \ngames - \nsuch as cards, dice or a playing board. It’s also far more concerned \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwith the stories told along the way than with “winning.” It’s far more like \nchildhood make-believe than what most people typically think of when they \nimagine “games.” This book contains all the information you’ll need to start \nplaying and telling your own stories. You create the action, you choose the \npath to follow, and you decide what risks to accept. We call this style of game \nMind’s Eye Theatre. \nPlaying Mind’s Eye Theatre is like being in a movie. You and your \nfriends are the characters, but there is no script. There may be a framework \nor setting that determines the parameters of the world around you, but you \nand the other players create the story as you play. The “director” of this movie \nis the Storyteller, assisted by Narrators. The Storyteller creates the stage and \nthe minor characters that the players interact with to tell this story. \nMost scenes in Mind’s Eye Theatre are played out in real time- an hour \nin make-believe world is 60 minutes long, and it takes up 60 minutes in the \nreal world. Players always remain in character during the game unless there \nis a rules dispute. \nCHARACTERS \nWhen you play Mind’s Eye Theatre, you take on another persona (here \na human who has joined with an ancient Egyptian soul and received the gift \nof immortality). Your character can be almost anything - \nfrom any walk of \nlife, age, creed, race or sex. The only limit is your imagination. When you \ncreate this character, you decide what she says or does. You decide where she \ngoes and what choices she makes. During the game, you speak as your \ncharacter, unless you’re resolving a rules dispute or talking to the Storyteller. \nBecause most of what a Mind’s Eye Theatre player perceives around him \ndepends on the other players, all players should be vivid and expressive. \nWhile the characters may direct the plot through their actions, the plot \nreacts in ways that direct the characters. For example, a character decides he \nwants to buy a coffeehouse with space for people to perform, and he invites \na well-known local group to perform for an evening. Here the characters are \ndirecting the plot through their actions. However, the plot reacts to this \ndirection. The Storyteller tells the characters that the performance has \naroused some suspicious attention. It seems that one of the performers \nreminds a character of a singer who was supposed to have died two years ago. \nThus is a story built in Mind’s Eye Theatre. \nCreating a character for Laws of the Resurrection is easy, and it takes \njust a few minutes. Only a few steps are necessary to define the basic \ncapabilities of a character, and once they’re done, you can start playing. \nThere’s another phase to creating a character, though. A character is, by and \nlarge, like a person, and people aren’t just flat cardboard cutouts with a few \nnumbers to represent what they can do. People have pasts, likes and dislikes, \ngoals and dreams - \nall the intangible things that make a person into what \nother people see when he walks into a room or talks to them. It’s not much \ndifferent from all the care that an actor or author takes when creating a \ncharacter. So as you’re creating your character, think a little about where she \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncomes from, what she wants out of her existence, wha \nshe loves and hates. Does your character love thunderstorms and watch them \nfrom the window, or have they frightened him ever since he was a child? Does \nyour character want revenge on the person who killed a loved one, and will \nhe bargain with the Devil himself to get it? While certain personality quirks \nand details emerge as you play, it’s a good idea to have the basics in place for \nthe first time you walk into a room and meet the other characters. \nCharacters are the heart and soul of the story. Without them, all the \nefforts of the Storyteller would be for nothing, and there would be no stories \nto tell. \nTHE STORYTELLER \nThe Storyteller is the one who creates the world that the players move \nthrough. She creates a skeletal framework of setting and plot, then turns the \ncharacters loose to put flesh on its bones. More than that, she acts as an \nimpartial judge when the rules are questioned, describes scenes that can’t be \nstaged and even plays the parts of antagonists or other people with whom the \ncharacters interact. The Storyteller is usually assisted by Narrators, who play \ntheir own characters but are ready to answer rules questions when necessary. \nStorytelling is a demanding (and occasionally exhausting) task. He must \noversee the events to be certain that people have a good time, that the rules \nare being followed, and that the story is running smoothly. Sometimes she \nmust create plot elements on the spur of the moment or adjudicate between \nseveral quarreling players. In spite of all of this responsibility, it is immensely \nsatisfying watching the players create something remarkable with the plot \nelements given to them. It makes the headaches worthwhile. \nELEGANTLY SIMPLE \nThis game was designed to be easy to play, and easier to start. As said, \ncharacter creation takes only a few minutes. The basic rules are simple, and \nthey cover most of the encounters that a new player will enter. Even very new \nplayers who have never played Mind’s Eye Theatre or LARP before will find \nthat it takes little effort to pick up. \nThis game is based on the tabletop book Mummy: The Resurrection. It \nis not necessary to own Mummy to play this game, but you may find some \nhelpful source material within. \nHOW TO USE THIS BOOK \nThis book gives you all the basic rules that you’ll need to start playing or \nChapter One: Introduction-The \nintroduction toMind’s Eye Theatre, \nChapter Two: The Amenti -Describes the various mummies basedon \nStorytelling mortals in the World of Darkness. \nthe World of Darkness and the world that the Reborn inhabit. \nthe piece of soul that joins with their own. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n.. ‘. \n, _-. 4 \nChapter Three: Character Creation - All the things you need to \nChapter Four: Hekau- \nThese are the mystical powers of ancient Egypt \nChapter Five: Rules, Systems and Drama -All the necessary rules and \nChapter Six: Storytelling - \nWhether you’re a veteran Storyteller or \nChapter Seven: Allies and Antagonists - \nMummies aren’t the only \ncreate a character and start playing. \nthat the Reborn wield against their enemies. \ndetails to run the game. \nhave picked it up for the first time, this chapter will show you the ropes. \nstrange things in the nighted world. \nTHE RULES THOU SHALT NOT BREAK \nIn the end, these are the only rules of the game that must always be \nobeyed. These keep everyone - \nother players, law enforcement, curious \nonlookers and you -safe \nand happy with the game. They’re not intended to \nlimit fun, only to ensure that everyone plays safely and has a good time. \nNO TOUCHING \nThat means none. Even when everyone’s being careful, accidents can \nhappen. \nNO STUNTS \nNo climbing, running, jumping or other dangerous stunts during a game. \nLet the rules cover actions like jumping from rooftops and the like. If you can \nimagine you’re the reincarnation of an Egyptian queen, you can surely \nimagine you’re swinging from a chandelier. \nNO WEAPONS \nThat means none whatsoever, not even as props. Even obviously fake or \nsilly toy weapons can look like the real thing in dim lighting and might give \nthe wrong impression about the game. Use item cards instead. \nNO DRINKING OR DRUGS \nDuh. Drugs and alcohol do not create peak performance. A player who’s \ndrunk or stoned is a danger to others and the game. There’s nothing wrong \nwith playing a character who is drunk or stoned, but bringing the real thing \nto a game is a poor choice. At best, it’s unfitting; at worst, it’s illegal and a \nsafety issue. Just say no. \nBE MINDFUL OF OTHERS \nThis one has become very important in the past couple of years. Always \nremember, especially if you play in a public place, that not everyone around \nyou is involved in the game. Make sure that your actions or appearance do not \nfrighten or disturb others - \nthis includes conversations. In this age of \ndomestic terrorism, discussing the gory details of mummification, torture and \nthe like in a public place, where nonplayers might overhear and misinterpret \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwhat’s happening makes for a very bad combination. If a curious bystander \nfrom outside the game asks what’s going on, drop out of character and explain \npolitely. \nTHE RULES ARE FLEXIBLE \nWe at White Wolf call this “the golden rule.” If there’s some ruling \nherein (other than these listed here) that doesn’t work for your group, then \nby all means change it if it will mean a smoother game. Just be consistent and \nfair - \nrulings that change weekly, or that result in no-win situations, upset \nthe fun. \nIT’S ONLY A GAME \nIf a rival wins, if a plot falls apart, if a character dies - \nit’s only a game. \nAt the end of the day, it’s still a game that is played to have fun. Don’t spoil \nit for others by taking it too seriously. Leave the game behind when it ends. \nPlaying Mind’s Eye Theatre is entertainment, and getting together with \nother players afterward to discuss the night’s events is great, but demanding \na meeting with Anubis when the Storyteller is studying for exams signals the \nneed for some downtime. \nAGAIN. HAVE FUN \nNot “Win.” Not “Go out and kill everything else.” Just have fun. The \ngoal of Mind’s Eye Theatre is to tell stories about the hero’s journey and what \nhappens along the way. \nTHE WORLD OF DARKNESS \nOn the surface, the World of Darkness doesn’t seem that different from \nour own. People are born, grow up, work and die every day. Plants and \nskyscrapers compete for space. The same newspapers are sold on the comer, \nand television is the same vast wasteland. But there is something else in the \nWorld of Darkness - \nan element fed from the violence and despair that \npermeates the world. This element is what the monsters feed on, and the \nmonsters are all too real. \nThe World of Darkness is not simply our own with a coating of black \npaint and some random monsters stirred in. It is a world that has become too \nbeaten down by violence, coarseness, social ills and emotional pain to rouse \nitself. The gulf between the haves and the have-nots is great and widens daily. \nHope and compassion are all too rare, but all the more precious for their \nscarcity. People look for some light in their lives, but even faith is a \ncommodity. Those who manage to lift themselves often do so through violent \nmeans, doing whatever it takes to make a dent in the walls. And in the midst \nof all this, unknown to the masses, are monsters, spirits and creatures of myth, \nmoving among humanity on their own shadowy business. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nIN THE SHADOW OF THE SPHINX \nWhen one hears the word “mummy,” images of shuffling, bandaged \ncorpses from old movies comes to mind. In the world of Laws of the \nResurrection, such beings exist, but they are the products of corruption or \nfailure. The mummies of Resurrection are creatures of flesh and blood who \nare perhaps even more alive than some humans. They breathe the same air, \neat the same foods and see the same sights, but it is all more sensational and \nmagnificent as they have tasted death and been granted life once again. \nMummies are immortal, but not in the sense of the divine immortality of the \ngods. A mummy can die, but he will journey the Underworld and later return \nto life, ready to resume his goals and duties. \nFor thousands of years, the Nile has cast its irresistible spell over the \nyoungest of the children of the world. From its mighty source (not far from the \nearliest scientific evidence of Man at Olduvai) to its outlet (near the deserts \nwhere the prophets of old walked), the valley of the eternal river has been \nMankind’s greatest cradle. It gives life to our dreams. Now the children of the \nNile return from darkness, finally ready to answer the Sphinx’s riddle. \nOsiris, one of the oldest and greatest of the Egyptian gods, has long \nreigned in the Lands of the Dead. A recent cataclysm in the Underworld has \nroused Osiris from his seeming slumber to take an active hand in the living \nworld once again. The agents of this ancient power are themselves things of \nlegend. They are deathless beings who defy the grasp of mortality. They are \nmummies. \nMUMMIES \nAncient Egyptians perfected the art of preserving the bodies of the dead \nto maintain them for the afterlife. After death, the individual’s soul passed \ninto Duat, the Egyptian Underworld. There, in the spirit city of Amenti, \nOsiris ruled over the dead. The god Anubis acted as psychopomp, guiding new \narrivals before the judges of the afterlife so that they could determine the \nspirit’s reward for its life. \nBeyond this point, two schools of thought prevailed: Some believed that \nthe corpse must remain inviolate so that it could sustain the soul in the \nafterlife, while others proclaimed that it would serve as a receptacle for the \nreturning soul. As time passed and few people ever witnessed a corpse actively \nrise to life, the first view became dominant. The afterlife was a reflection of \nthis world, only perfected, and a person’s place in that realm was determined \nby his proper adherence to Ma’at and the care with which he was interred. \nThis viewpoint led to elaborate practices by the powerful. Pharaohs and \nwealthy men were entombed with jewels and riches. Some were even \naccompanied by their mummified wives, children or servants. Armies of \nwooden ushabti statues stood ready to answer the summons to labor in the \nafterlife on their master’s behalf. Some notables were even buried with intact \nships and chariots, or entourages of mummified crocodiles, ibis or other \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nanimals. A culture that believed you could take it with you flourished for \nthousands of years. \nIronically, their beliefs were a pale reflection of the practices of the \ngodlike beings who ruled them in the flesh during pre-dynastic times, but they \nwere viewed as intangible forces and as legend in later times. When \nincorporated with the mummification ceremony, the Spell of Life used by the \ngoddess Isis to resurrect her brother-husband Osiris created an eternal link \nbetween soul and corpse. Through this ritual, both forms of immortality came \nabout in one being. A recipient of the spell could travel the realms of the \nUnderworld and revel in the afterlife, and then return to life in the physical \nrealm. Osiris and his followers were truly masters of life and death. \nAlthough those blessed by the cult that served Isis and Osiris still \nventured into the Underworld upon their death, they could now return across \nthe Shroud, the spirit veil that divided the living and spirit worlds, infusing \ntheir dead flesh with life again. Months (even years) might pass, but amummy \nwho gave proper service in the Underworld could always eventually return to \nlife, no matter how many times he was slain. \nThe ancient mummies were made imperfectly, however, and could never \ncompletely escape the Shadowlands. They were missing an essential quality. \nThough their flesh was warm and their hearts beat, they could not pass on the \ngift of life. No children could come of their unions, and their spirits rested too \nlightly in their bodies. Mystics found their blood strangely lacking in life- \nforce and their auras flawed. Due to the power of the ritual, the followers of \nIsis and Osiris performed the resurrection ceremony on only a small number \nof their members. Nonetheless, an undying breed is a force to be reckoned \nwith, no matter how small their numbers. Osiris’ son Horus led most of the \nimmortal mummies in an effort to cleanse the world of his father’s murderous \nbrother Set and the venomous children of the dark god. Constantly beleaguered \nby the forces of the serpent, the faithful Shemsu-hem, or Followers of Horus, \nreturned again and again to stand against Set’s evil. \nEven the eternal Shemsu-heru could not withstand the fury of the Dja- \nakh, the great spirit storm, and most perished in its devastating wake. \nWithout the wisdom of the god of the Resurrection, all might have been lost. \nAMENT1 \nIn the aftermath of the spirit storm, the old Spell of Life has lost its \npotency. Whether Osiris simply stopped empowering its flawed form or some \nshift in the nature of spirits occurred due to the Dja-akh, the ritual no longer \nworks. Osiris prepared cults throughout the Middle East who followed his \nteachings for the disastrous storm. Priests and priestesses learned the new \nSpell of Life, created during Osiris’ centuries beyond the Shroud and with the \ninsight he gained into the bond between spirit and flesh. When the shattered \nsouls of the city of Amenti began to arrive in the Lands of Faith, bearing the \nravaged bodies of a new age, the priesthood of the god of the Resurrection \nawaited them. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nflows as strong as ;he Nile. Part of the spell’s strength comes from the new \nmanner in which the Reborn (as mummies are also called) are created. Those \nresurrected in the wake of the Dja-akh are not simply souls tied to their \ncorpses forever; the new mummies are products of a union of one of the storm- \nshattered souls from Amenti and of the flawed soul of a mortal who has died \nrecently. Only the strongest shards of the souls of the ancient Egyptian dead \nwere able to survive the Maelstrom’s savage winds. At Osiris’ behest, the \nremnants of these ancient spirits - \nincluding some old mummies whose souls \nwere fractured by the howling soul tide of the Dja-akh- are spreading across \nthe world seeking those whose weaknesses need their strength. They solicit \na bond with individuals whom they can complete and complement. \nFrom the perspective of those in the Underworld, a person who is soon \nto meet with death evinces a mark or sign shortly before his end in the physical \nworld. Spirits call these prophetic markings “Deathmarks.” When an Amenti \nspirit finds a compatible individual bearing the spiritual Deathmarks, the \ntattered entity waits nearby in the tumultuous ghost world. At the moment \nof death, the Amenti spirit fragment reveals itself to the newly deceased and \noffers to restore her to life. Should she agree, the shard of the Egyptian soul \nanimates the individual’s dying form with just enough life energy to make a \ndesperate pilgrimage, or hajj. The spirit’s goal is the Web of Faith, a network \nof holy sites scattered across northem Africa to the Middle East infused with \nthe life-force of Osiris himself. It is a life-force that is vital to the resurrection \nceremony. \nIn the Lands of Faith, the priests and priestesses of Isis and Osiris await \nthe joined spirits, and their sacred magic calls to the returning dead. Once the \nanimated corpse is taken in at one of the secret sites, the beloved of Isis and \nOsiris perform the divine ritual of resurrection. \nWhile exact practices of the ritual of rebirth vary from cult to cult, the \nkey elements remain the same. The body is soaked in natron (a salt mixture \ncommon to the Egyptian embalming process) and wrapped in protective \nbandages that have been inscribed with spells. As long as the ritual is \nperformed within the Web of Faith, the deceased is flooded with a surge of \nlife-force. The power of Osiris flows into the corpse, burning away the weak \nportions of its soul. The fragment of the ancient Egyptian soul replaces the \nflawed or impure portion of the modem soul, and it is called a tem-akh, or \n“completing spirit.” The new soul joins seamlessly with the old. The hybrid \nis then led by Anubis to face the Judges ofMa’at. Afterreceiving the judgment \nof this spiritual group, the newly empowered soul merges once more with its \nbody and returns to Life. \nThe resurrected individual - \nreferred to formally as an Amenti, in honor \nof the lost city of the Dead from whence the soul fragments come-may \nundergo small changes as the body adjusts to its new, more powerful life force, \nalthough these alterations tend to be subtle ones. The most significant \nchanges that the Spell of Life brings are usually clear. The recipient has come \nback to life, and the weakest portion of her soul has been replaced with the \npowerful tern-akh. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSOUL SHARDS \nTo understand the nature of the Amenti, one must recognize the \nEgyptian concept that nine parts represent an individual's entire essence. A \nperson's true name, or ren, is an inherent part of her being, and it may even \nbe used to gain power over her. The heart, or ab, is the center of consciousness. \nThe body, known as the khat, is necessary for the mummy's eventual \nresurrection. The remaining portions that comprise an individual are spiritual. \nSpiritual energy called Sekhem - \nsimilar to the notion of life-force - \nflows through the soul and body. The ren, ab and Sekhem reside within and \ndefine the body and soul alike. The khat stays in the physical realm. The \nremaining five aspects of an individual's essence exist within the person's \nkhat, but pass from the corporal world upon the person's death. \nThe ancient Egyptians recognized five soul aspects for each person. The \nka kept careful watch over the body during death, protecting it from harm. \nThe ba traveled into the spirit realms and returned only to help complete the \nRebirth. The khaibit embodied the soul's darkness, aggression and hunger. \nThe sahu was the eternal, incorruptible portion of the soul that dwelled in the \nEgyptian paradise known as A'aru. The khu surrounded the body and soul like \na protective spiritual aura. \nUnfortunately for those Egyptian spirits in Duat, they were vulnerable to \nthe Dja-akh that swept through the Underworld at the end of the millennium. \nThe storm's spiritual devastation destroyed weaker vital essences. Only the \nstrongest soul aspects survived. Few spirits of the Underworld city of Amenti \nsurvived in their entirety. Virtually every soul was shattered and left incomplete. \nThese spirit remnants lost the remaining portions of their greater soul and \ndrifted alone. Any chance the spirit pieces had to ever again join in life was \nlost to the spirit storm's rage. Without the other aspects of the soul, \nresurrection was forever denied to them. That is, until Osiris revealed his plan \nto them. \nTHEHOLY LAND \nThe lands of the Arabian peninsula and northern Africa have long been \nknown as the cradle of civilization. The three great monotheistic religions \nwere born in the Middle East, and their influence is certainly felt around the \nworld. But the ancient homeland of Mankind teems with bloodshed, chaos \nand violence as though some invisible force was at work. In the Near-Eastem \nWorld of Darkness, those who seek the unseen adversaries of Mankind find \nthem all too eager to snatch the unwary away. \nOn the surface level, the Holy Land appears little different to the \nsupernatural denizens of the World of Darkness than it does to the mortals \nwho walk among them. The same ancient buildings crowd the same dusty \nstreets and shelter everyone from the fury of the noonday sun. Countries' \nborders stand in eternal states of tension, where border guards watch constantly \nfor the next terrorist carrying a bomb or gun in his clothes. Suspicion, fear and \nhatred tear at the fabric of the divine kingdoms on earth, and every day \nanother soul is lost to bigotry and demonizing dogmatism. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe population swells faster than the scarce resources of life can support, \nand power-hungry men discover that the politics of water are a quick way to \nbring death to their enemies. On the other hand, the world clamors for \nunrestricted access to the rich reserves ofoil that lie beneath most of the Holy \nLand. The so-called “world powers” seek to subvert any chance of unity or \npeace so that they can exploit the division of the Near East in order to keep \ntheir own citizens happily paying less for a gallon of gas. The price for oil is \nblood, and the superpowers covertly provide weapons and training to any \ndictator or militant group that will spill it in their name. Resentment boils up \nlike a storm, and innocents die as angry Middle Easterners strike against those \nwho meddle in their affairs. In a vicious cycle, politicians and religious leaders \non every side happily recount the crimes of their opposites and scream for \nvengeance. \nDJINN \nLike the rest of the World of Darkness, the Holy Land is home to avariety \nof supernatural beings, many as ageless as the trackless desert. Islamic texts \nspeak of the djinn, beings created by God before the coming of Man. They \nwere formed of smokeless fire, even as the first man was formed from clay, and \ncan take many shapes or even none. This idea is very similar to that of sa, the \nfluid virtue and power of the Egyptian gods and demons, which lets them flow \ninto any form or even coexist with other objects or creatures. In fact, ancient \nEgyptian tales tell of spiritual beings stepping from the fires of fallen stars with \nflesh of iron. But for all their power and majesty, the creator would seem to \nhave some purpose for Mankind that puts djinn below humans. Djinn do not \npossess souls and are bound by convoluted codes known as the Laws of \nSolomon. \nA few inspired mystics of the World of Darkness believe that those who \nare slain and rise as vampires are actually reanimated by the bestial spirit of \na lesser djinn known as a ghul, which flows into the body along with tainted \nblood and inspires an unholy hunger. The same scholars say that the \nshapeshifters and faeries of legend are forms of djinn. Tales of King Solomon \ntrapping thousands of djinn within various magical vessels continue to inspire \ntales of wonder. Sorcerers sometimes seek to follow in the Biblical king’s \nfootsteps by binding the djinn to perform great tasks. The dead pass into the \nUnderworld and encounter angels and demons matching almost every legend \nawaiting them with wisdom and justice. It seems that we fascinate and \nempower the djinn every bit as much as they do us, our cycles tied together \nby the unseen hand of an unknowable purpose. \nNAMING THE GODS \nThe choice between complete accuracy and use of familiar terms can \nsometimes be a difficult one. Since we are telling stories instead of writing \nscientific treatises, the decision is easier. The fact that the word “pharaoh” \nevokes more powerful imagery than “perdu,” and that Nebt-Hut sounds more \nlike Star Wars to the modem ear than the goddess Nephthys deserves, settles \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nit. In most cases, the Greek name has come into dominant use. Here we \npresent the ancient Egyptian equivalents, but purists will have to resign \nthemselves to an acknowledgment of the original and be happy with the \ncommon name throughout the rest of this text. \nTHE 7x70 LANDS \nAncient Egyptians recognized the dichotomy of the world in symbolism \nthat pervaded every comer of their religion and writing. Upper and Lower \nEgypt were combined into one kingdom by the legendary pharaoh Menes and \ncalled the Two Lands. The Two Lands also found expression in the Black \nLands (or Khem, so called for the life-giving dark silt of the Nile River) and \nthe Red Lands, or the inhospitable desert. The most important recognition \nof the Two Lands, however, was the understanding that Duat, or the \nUnderworld, mirrored the material world. Everything in creation had a \nspiritual double. Although this spirit world and its doubles were invisible to \nmortal eyes, talented magicians could glimpse it, and everyone knew that \nthey would enter it upon death. \nDuat is a confusing place to the mortal mind, containing such diverse \nrealms as the paradise of A’aru, called the Field of Reeds; the Halls of Ma’at, \nwhere the dead were judged; and the pits of Apophis, where the Devourer \nlurks hoping to forever swallow the sun god Ra. The life-force of the world \nflows throughout Duat, and somewhere within its depths can be found the \nspiritual counterpart of every creature, object and idea. The fall of Egypt to \nconquerors has eclipsed many of the parts of Duat that would be most familiar \nto the Egyptians, but the rise of new faiths has only made Duat more intricate. \nThe uppermost layer of Duat, called Neter-khertet remains easy to reach as \nit directly mirrors the physical world, which means it has also changed to \nreflect the history of the lands it reflects. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTHE SCROLL OF TIME \nIn the beginning, the One who is the only one, Amon, was in the void. \nFrom the void, Amon created the world and caused the waters to part and the \nmound of earth to rise up. In the eldest days, the Two Lands were not as one, \nor even as two. The beasts ruled the earth, from the crocodile that was the \ndemon of the river, to the scorpion that was the poison of the desert, to the \nlion that was the king of the grasslands. The children of the earth, Sibu-Gabu, \nhad lived according to Amon’s law, beneath the gaze of their sky-mother Nuit \nfor ages untold before the coming of Man. But the hidden will of Amon had \nyet to be revealed, and the Modeler formed humanity from the flesh of Sibu- \nGabu and the spirit of Nuit, and set the new life on the Earth. Amon, who is \nhidden, watched with dismay as the serpent Apophis sought to devour the \nsun, and Man chose to live as a beast, grazing upon the green mantle of Sibu- \nGabu and hunting the flesh of other creatures. Apophis devoured the hearts \nof men, sometimes before they even passed from the earth, and its hunger \ninfected their souls such that they began to feed upon each other. \nAlarmed by Apophis, the heavens and earth acted as one. The sun \npeeked above the horizon at the same moment the Nile’s annual flooding, the \nInundation, began, and the star Sothis (later called Sirius) also rose into the \nsky. This rare event occurs only once every 1,461 years, and marks the \nbeginning of a period of time known as the Sothic cycle. This time, reputedly \nin the year 4240 BCE, marked the arrival to earth of four of the divine \ndescendants of the creator. Osiris, his brother Set and their sisters, Isis and \nNephthys, brought peace and law to Mankind. Osiris ended cannibalism and \nchaos and ruled over the people as the First Pharaoh. His rule constituted a \nbenevolent dictatorship, with the words of the gods heard directly by the \npeople and justice coming from divine wisdom and balance. The lands along \nthe Nile grew prosperous, and the Nagada tribes spread along its length \njoyfully bearing news of the creator and his children on earth. \nAlas, paradise on earth could not last. The serpent Apophis wormed his \nway into Set’s heart, and the younger brother rose up against his elder sibling. \nHe hungered for power and glory, desiring to be worshipped above all else. \nJealousy seethed inside Set, and he turned many of the people against the First \nPharaoh. The fight was fierce, for its leaders were gods, with Set’s warriors \nfighting for promises of wealth and Osiris’ defenders protecting the rightful \npharaoh. Ultimately, Set was defeated, but the lands that would become \nEgypt had been irreparably divided. Osiris was merciful and banished his \nbrother and enemies to the desert. \nDuring Set’s absence, a strange being called Typhon visited Osiris and \nproclaimed that his kingdom would be overcome by demons that drank \nblood. He offered the Lord of Life the power of death, with the promise that \nits might would let him save his domain. The pale one tried to beguile the First \nPharaoh with tales of the princes of darkness that ruled the world outside of \nEgypt, and Osiris’ own divinations foretold his death. The god listened to his \naccursed guest, who was one of the terrible dead that Arabs would later call \nghuk. Some believe he partook of Typhon’s offer, while others say he resisted. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nWhatever the truth, he sent Typhon away. After their talks, the First Pharaoh \ngrew saddened and withdrawn. The goddess Isis despaired that he had turned \nfrom her under the weight of his heavy heart. Osiris began to seek a way to \nrepair the damage the demons would bring and balance the scales of Ma’at \nonce again. \nAs though he were fulfilling Osiris’ prophecies, Set returned. He had \nchanged into a terrible unliving state through gorging on the dark blood of \nApophis. Once again, Set sought to usurp the rule of Khem. The resulting \nstruggle has become the stuff of legend. Set cleverly had his supporters present \nOsiris with a magnificent coffin in which he might rest in the event of his \ndeath. As soon as the pharaoh laid down in it, Set sprang from hiding and \nmagically sealed the casket. His servants cast it into the Nile and Set seized \nthe throne. Isis fled into the wilderness and spent years seeking her missing \nhusband. \nIsis finally found his coffin hidden within a wooden pillar carved from a \ntamarisk tree that had grown around it. She released her husband from the \nsarcophagus and called upon Amon to help her. Her magic brought her \nhusband back from his deathsleep. This was the first Resurrection. Though \nOsiris was like one of the dead, through their magic he proved to be fertile, \nand Isis bore their son Horus. The tragic family remained in hiding as the First \nPharaoh continued to heal and sleep longer and longer, dreaming of the sun \ngod in his night vessel and sailing through the Underworld. \nIn the end, however, Set discovered the return and hunted Osiris down. \nThe usurper viciously slew Osiris into pieces and scattered his fragments \nacross Egypt. Osiris, however, was the chosen son of the heavens, and even \nin death continued the divine purpose. In the lands of Duat, Osiris met with \nAnubis, the guide of the dead, and learned many secrets from the jackal- \nheaded messenger. From the spirit world, he spoke to Isis through their \nintimate link, and she learned the art of the second Resurrection. She then \nsummoned a multitude of birds, which scoured the Two Lands for the god’s \ncorpse and cast the Spell of Life upon his gathered body. The mummified flesh \nof the god swelled to life, and Osiris returned to the earth once again. \nOsiris’ time was short, and he knew it. No one knows exactly what he told \nhis sister-wife Isis, his son Horus and his confidante Mestha before Set found \nhim once again. He spoke to them in secret until his murderous brother’s \ninevitable assault. When the time came, the First Pharaoh sacrificed himself \nin battle against his brother so that others might escape to build an Egypt that \ncould survive the coils of the serpent. From the fragments of the Nagada \nKingdoms, mighty Egypt would arise and spurn the usurper. The demonic \nblood of Apophis sustained Set and his evil power through the centuries, but \nhe could never completely dominate the Two Lands. \nThe brief teachings of Osiris were enough for the Cult of Isis to continue \nthe battle against Set for thousands of years, and to create a cadre of 42 \nimmortals who would come back to life again after every death. These \nmummies who benefited from the Spell of Life aided Horus in his eternal \nstruggle to avenge the death of his father after Isis chose to leave the earth. \nThe Shemsu-heru, or Followers of Horus, spent time after each death resting \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrld in the city of Amenti. In Duat, they met with the spirits \nof those who had not passed to the Fields of Paradise and who remained tied \nto the earth. In Amenti, they witnessed the invulnerable form of their lord \nOsiris, sitting like a statue on his throne. The Shanu-atiu, the inner circle of \nghostly priests who guarded him, believed that the god was contemplating the \ntruth of the universe and carefully observed him for any change. Writhing \nstorms grew in the Underworld as the Devourer Apophis consumed more and \nmore of the Deadlands. Meanwhile, the Reborn, as the mummies were \nknown, continued to return to the physical world in an attempt to fight the \nserpent’s corruption of the earth. Despair seeped in like a deadly poison, \npromising a terrible end. \nTHE GHOST STORM \nThe innermost group of Osiris priests, the Pylons of the Shanu-atiu, \nnever lost hope. A number of times, the great throne of Osiris had been \nmysteriously found empty. The first time, they kept it to themselves for fear \nof the great panic it would cause in the Underworld. When their lord \nmysteriously reappeared, they rejoiced but maintained the same policy of \nshrouding any of his occasional absences from all outsiders until they could \ndiscover the reason why. Even the Shanu-atiu did not know where the god \nof the Resurrection went during his sojourns, though they did know that one \nsuch period happened around 2780 B.C.E. (at one of the changes of the \nSothic cycle), and another occurred during the first three decades of the \nCommon Era. \nThe disappearances of Osiris seemed to precede the terrible surges in the \nblack coils of Apophis that stormed through the Underworld. The worst Duat \nstorms always came before some tremendous and terrible event in the \nmaterial realm. So the disappearances of Osiris came to be a warning of future \ndanger. When the most recent Maelstrom swept through the Underworld, \nhowever, the Shanu-atiu were completely unprepared, for their lord did not \nmove until the full fury of the storm blasted Amenti into the desert of Duat. \nThe fierce cataclysm has been named Dja-akh, or the Ghost Storm, by those \nfew dead who were not shattered or destroyed outright. The scattered Shanu- \natiu were paralyzed by fear, knowing that such devastation could only be the \nDeathmarks that promised some new atrocity in the world. And judging by \nthe power of the Dja-akh, it would be the worst ever, perhaps even the end \nof it all. They searched frantically for any sign of the return of the Lord of Life. \nTheir search led to the Web of Faith. \nTHE WEB OF FAITH \nSites of great power dot the Holy Land, some within famous cities and \nothers buried in the wastes of the trackless desert. Energy flows between these \nareas, ebbing and flowing like the Nile. As pilgrims journey to reach the focus \nof their devotion, so does the essence of the universe gather in these places. \nThe ancient Egyptians called this vital spiritual force Sekhem, and priests \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsought to direct the power of the gods through their temple \nof the dead. Later cultures sought tap into the same energy. \nThe Arabs in particular built beautiful mosques, some with the same \nstones that once graced Egyptian sites, and tried to unite the entire Holy Land \nin one system of temporal and mystical perfection. Their efforts brought \ntogether an awesome collection of places touched by the divine, but they \nultimately failed in the face of internal division and European Crusades. \nNevertheless, the links between the holy places remain visible to those aware \nof such things. Though centuries of conflict threatened the fabric of this \nspiritual network, sorcerers and mystics learned to strengthen and tap into its \npower. The builders and protectors of this invisible lattice of divine energy \ncalled it the Web of Faith. \nWhentheDja-akhswept through theghostlycityofAmenti, it destroyed \nthe refuge of the dead and destroyed nearly all of its inhabitants. Osiris saw \nthe storm coming, but even he could not stop it, nor could anyone flee far \nenough to avoid it. So he remained and protected as many of the residents the \nbest he could. As the terrible storm ravaged his holy city and shattered his \npeople, Osiris struggled to hold back its worst fury. Eventually the god’s power \nwas exhausted in the face of Apophis’ relentless darkness. The beleaguered \nOsiris finally fell back and entered the Web of Faith. He tapped into its holy \nessence to heal and search for ways to save his scattered children. There in the \nWeb, he felt all of the resting places of his once-shattered body and the faint \nthreads of flights across the desert made by the birds that once brought him \nback together. \nThe Lord of Life and Death gathered the remaining fragments of his lost \nchildren and sent them out to find their own new bodies. \nMUMMY MYTHOLOGY \nLaws of the Resurrection draws its inspiration from actual Egyptian \nmyth, filtered through the shadows of the World of Darkness. Osiris, Set, Isis, \nMa’at and Apophis are the central players in the game’s cosmology. A great \ndegree of their detail is directly derived from Egyptian myth, but much has \nbeen changed to fit the World of Darkness stories told over the years. Players \nand Storytellers are strongly encouraged to investigate the wonders of \nEgyptian mythology for themselves. \nTHE RESURRECTED \nWhat sets the Amenti aside from their ancient counterparts is that they \nare the union of a fragmented Egyptian spirit and a modem person. The \nvarious soul aspects of the Egyptianspirit result in differences in the Third Life \nthat they lead in communion with their modem hosts. The very tasks once \nborne by the fragments have naturally shaped their preferences in choosing \na modem partner with whom to bond in perpetual union. The mixture of \ncommon personalities found within surviving ancient spirits and their \nchoices among contemporary humans, and the spiritual abilities they gain by \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\njoining, naturally detine mummies with very different outlooks and special \naptitudes. \nEach of the mummy types is determined by its tem-akh, which is the \n“completing spirit” that has joined with the deceased mortal to resurrect her. \nThus, as the ka once guarded the body exclusively, the resurrected partner \nbound with the ka tem-akh becomes a Kher-minu, or Tomb Watcher. \nDifferent soul tem-akh are skilled in particular types of Hekau, or Egyptian \nmagic, and that specialization is brought to the union. As the Resurrected \nlearn the depth of their purpose in creation and abide by it, their talent \nnaturally grows. Yet the ancient spirits’ pursuits of separate goals created an \ninherent focus. Difficulty acting outside their spiritual roles is the proper \nbalance to the power they gained by properly following their mythic purpose. \nThe Amenti do not organize themselves automatically according to their \ntern-akh. After all, it’s not like you can just look at another Amenti and know \nwhat sort of spirit brought about his Resurrection. Some Amenti have never \neven encountered another mummy before. Nonetheless, because of common \nbehaviors displayed by certain tem-akh, there are some generalizations that \ncan be applied. \nTHE EM-AKH \nKher-minu, the Tomb Watchers: The ka is that part of the soul the \nEgyptians envisioned as remaining in the vicinity of the khat in order to \nprotect it until the resurrection. Those who become Kher-minu become \nprotectors, beginning first with their own bodies and expanding their duties \nto the rest of the world. They specialize in Amulet magic due to its protective \nmight, and they shun harmful vices. \nKhri-habi, the Scroll-bearers: The ba appears in Egyptian art as a bird \nwith a human head. Its reputed role was to travel about performing the various \nduties in the afterlife that ensured the resurrection of the body. Scroll-bearers \nare potent healers. They learn Alchemy as they dream of purifying the entire \nworld in order to heal its wounds. \nMesektet, the Night Suns: The sahu portion of the soul is the part the \nEgyptians viewed as the incorruptible and everlasting essence that passed \nonwards to the heavens to reside with the gods. Returned from heaven, these \nsouls wield Celestial magic, which lets them see the future and call upon the \npower of earth and sky. \nSakhmu, the Spirit Scepters: The khu was an Egyptian concept that \nimagined a part of the soul as an intangible covering over the body. This \nshining essence stands as the inspirational gateway between the physical and \nspiritual realm. Sakhmu learn potent Effigy magic, allowing their inner light \nto empower their artistic creations to change the world (whether earthly or \nDuat) . \nSefekhi, the Unbandaged Ones: The khaibit is that part of the Egyptian \nbeing pictured as the shadow of the animating essence. These driven \nmummies turn their base instincts and darkest emotions against the servants \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n...  _ i . _ . . _ _ ,  \n_. \nof Apophis. They possess a knack for the magic of Necromancy and carry the \nwounds of Osiris on their bodies as symbolic scars. \nUdja-sen, the Judged Ones: In the union between an Amenti spirit and \na dying mortal, a lot can go wrong. Not every soul that remained within the \ncity of Osiris in the Underworld is fit in the eyes of Ma'at, nor is every mortal. \nThe Judged Ones are those souls given a second chance, yet are left \nincomplete due to the amputation of their corrupted spirit. They seek new \npurpose, while being keenly aware of the suffering caused by Apophis. \nTHE FACTIONS \nThe organizations to which the Amenti gravitate tend to be religious, \neconomic, or social groups. The special circumstances and history of the \nResurrected have resulted in the formation of factions that pursue particular \ngoals as a team. \nCULT OF ISIS \nFrom the day of her descent to earth, the goddess Isis served as a mother \nmodel for Mankind. Her experience as mother, sister, magician and preserver \nof her husband in death gifted her with great patience and made her beloved \nby the populace. Before she departed the earth - \neither ascending to live \nwith the sky gods, or choosing to die to be with her husband, whatever the \nbelief may be - \nshe imparted her wisdom to her worshippers. The most \nfaithful of these adherents kept alive the faith in Egyptian gods. They \nprotected and served her immortal son Horus and withstood the ravenous \ndepredations of the servants of Set. \nAs centuries passed, faith was diluted, wisdom faded, and the Cult of Isis \nfell into disarray. The usurper, Set, nearly destroyed the cult in the time of \nCleopatra and stole the precious Spell of Life from them. The Cult barely \nsurvived, but was distrusted by the same mummies they once created. Cult \nleaders despaired, and turned to the gods of conquerors or the service of Set. \nAs the years passed, memories of the goddess became clouded and obscured. \nIn the last decade of the 20th century, the Cult of Isis suddenly became \nactive again, though torn by the millennia of division into splinter faiths. \nSome began to seek out the ancient mummies still loyal to Horus in a \ndesperate effort to return them to life, while others tried to revive the use of \nthe lost Spell of Life. Studies of Egyptology reached levels not seen since the \nbeginning of the century. \nToward the end of the decade, more attuned cult members moved to the \nMiddle East and started to gather together the lost fragments of the Spell of \nLife and various artifacts buried in the sand. As the Amenti began their \ninexorable pilgrimage home, the Cult of Isis waited to resume the role of the \nancient mother goddess. Her children return, and the Cult brings them into \nthe world, swaddled in bandages and crying for understanding. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCHILDREN OF OSIRIS \nAccording to the eldest among the Children of Osiris, they were once \nghuls - \nwhat the Europeans call vampires. When Osiris descended to the \nearth, he proclaimed the end of cannibalism. A wise ghul named Khetamon \nturned from the path of darkness and went to speak to the god. Osiris looked \ninto his heart and saw that he truly wished to cease feasting upon the living \nbut could not. The First Pharaoh blessed the repentant Khetamon and taught \nhim to fight against the corruption that lurked within his spirit. The eldest \nChildren say that the god let Khetamon drink his blood for purification. The \nmerciful actions of the god-king brought more of the blood demons of Khem \nout of hiding and into holy practices bent upon their redemption. As the strict \nreligious discipline and deep philosophical teachings of the god gave them \nnew meaning, the dead ones began to call themselves the Children of Osiris. \nWhen Osiris was slain, Khetamon acted as the cult’s leader for centuries \nbefore Set’s followers slew him as well. The Children continued their search \nfor inner peace. \nWhen Osiris entered the Web of Faith, the faithful and faithless alike \ngained their reward. Those of the Children of Osiris who had remained true \nto his teachings and fought against their own demonic hearts found their \ninner darkness cast out. They returned to life, finally able to relish the mortal \nlives denied to them so long ago. Other Children who had fallen from the \npath and who had taken up the forbidden practices of the blood demons were \ndestroyed, with their souls judged upon the scales of Ma’at. The god of the \nResurrection brought an end to the curse of every one of his children, either \nthrough final death or by granting of a mortal life. The remaining (now \nmortal) Children of Osiris gathered those who would listen to their teachings \nand awaited the coming of the Amenti in their holy sites, especially Abydos. \nSome of the returning dead are dangerously violent due to their inability \nto overcome their raging khaibits. Centuries of struggle against a bloodthirsty \nnature make the Children all too familiar with the dangers of letting such \nindividuals rampage through society and grant great insight into how to \nredeem them. \nSHEMSU-HERU \nThousands of years ago, lsis resurrected the first of the mummies. These \nResurrected beings joined Horus, son of Isis and Osiris, in his quest to avenge \nthe death of his father and to destroy the usurper Set. They became known \nas the Shemsu-Heru, or Followers of Horus, and slowly gained in numbers \nuntil there was one for each of the 42 Judges of Ma’at. Most of them despaired \nafter hundreds of lifetimes were spent returning to the same worldly trials. A \nfew turned from service to the Avenger and pursued their own agendas. \nA small group of the Shemsu-Heru remained firmly loyal to their earthly \ngod and his Father. When Osiris returned to the Holy Lands and entered the \nWeb of Faith, he spoke to his son, commanding him to enact the second \nResurrection. Horus gathered together the faithful, and after ritual suicide, \nthey underwent the new Spell of Life. These ancient mummies gained the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\npure life-force they had been without for so many centuries. Horus and his \ndisciples returned to life, ready to lead the newly Resurrected into a courageous \nnew world. \nThe ancient mummies who kept their loyalty to the rightful inheritor of \nthe First Pharaoh, and to the precepts of Ma’at, are immensely powerful \nbeings. They are respected by the Amenti who remember them, and feared \nby those who seek to defy them. They are called Imkhu, or Revered Ones, by \nthe Amenti spirits that retain memories of times when the dying mummies \ncame to visit them in the Underworld city of Osiris. They combine nearly \ncomplete memories of scores of lifetimes with the vibrant life-force of the \nResurrection. \nHorus and his Imkhu advisors returned to his greatest temple, still \nstanding in Edfu. It is said that the son of Osiris has become a hawk-headed \ngod whose presence is too powerful for most to withstand for any length of \ntime without losing themselves to selfless worship. Apparently only the \nImkhu have the strength of spirit to resist his divine influence for long, and \nthey usually act as intermediaries for Horus, as much to protect visitors as to \ndefend their god. \nThe Followers of Horus have grown in ranks again. Mortals and younger \nmummies who behold the Avenger feel the spirit of the divine and are \ninspired with newfound faith. Visiting Resurrected are accorded great respect \nby the mortal adherents of the son of Osiris, and sometimes groups will seek \nto join a mummy in her work. \nESET-A \nLegends say that Isis sent the birds of the air to recover the lost portions \nof the god-king Osiris, which had been spread across Egypt by the villainy of \nhis evil brother Set. Splinter faiths within the Cult of Isis and the Children \nof Osiris believe that each of the resting places of Osiris’ body parts held relics \nthat absorbed portions of the god’s divine energy. In a mirror of the gathering \nof the god’s body, they seek to collect the artifacts that hold his Sekhem so \nthat they might rebuild him. Other factions feel that this approach borders \non blasphemy, especially since some Eset-a insist that the Islamic holy Ka’ba \nis the heart of the God of Life and Death. \nUnfortunately, many of the sites of the god’s remnants have been \npillaged over the millennia, and their artifacts have been scattered around the \nworld. Thus the Let-a search has been extended internationally. Their \ninfluence may be partly responsible for the shift in many governments’ \npolicies toward returning Egyptian relics to their homeland. The dangers \nposed by the possibility that mundane individuals could unknowingly destroy \nor further fragment the vessels that bear the essence of Osiris sometimes move \nthe Eset-a to desperate measures. They are not above theft or bribery for the \nopportunity to study treasures to ascertain if they might be one of the lost \nRemnants of Osiris. The Imkhu do not approve of this “ends justifies the \nmeans” attitude. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nASHUKHI \nBy all accounts, the fortunes of the Ashukhi Company changed when a \ncareless driver struck down its owners. Until that time, the little import \ncompany hadstruggled, but after the owners’ children sold it to a new interest, \nthe company found unexpected aid and monetary direction. Along with the \nadoption of a new Egyptian ram’s head logo, the company began a path of \nillogical investments in a bizarre mix of innovative technology and \narchaeological study. \nThe Ashukhi Company invests in people. With each new applicant to \nthe eternal payroll, the company changes its direction in ways that defy \nobservers’ predictions. Yet the continuing financial growth combined with \nincredibly charitable contribution to scientific study seems to indicate genius \nin the improvement of mankind’s future and respect for his past. The \nresurrected mummies who work with the Ashukhi Company seek to build a \nbetter world. Directly competing against the gigantic corporations that shape \nthe modem world is currently beyond the scope of Ashukhi, but the company \nhelps provide a way for mummies to bury their assets between lives, and a hope \nfor significant economic clout sometime to come. \nAshukhi should not be confused with the ruthless corporations of the \nWorldofDarkness. It isnowhere near thesizeofsuchgargantuanmonstrosities, \nnor does it benefit from the grotesqueries of economic slavery, environmental \nrape, and intentional socio-political corruption. The company also does not \nshare the faceless nature of corporate Goliaths. Though employees’ histories \nand identities are kept confidential to those outside the company, for obvious \nreasons of protection, secrets within the company are rare. It is known, for \nexample, that Horus owns portions of company stock and that the company’s \ngoals are ultimately altruistic. \nSHUANKHSEN: THE LIFELESS \nOver the ages, some mummies have left the fold of the Shemsu-Heru and \npursued their own agendas. A few groups even put together their own versions \nof the Spell of Life. After the theft of the Spell of Life by Set and the \nsubsequent creation of hideous Bane Mummies, Horus angrily demanded an \nend to all use of the spell and sought to destroy those who defied his will. \nWhen the Dja-akh struck, most were destroyed because they were not under \nthe protection of Osiris. A few may survive, as long as they continue to \nsuccessfully skirt the Judges of Ma’at. \nThe Shuankhsen are those mummies who are not properly alive. Their \nlife force is somehow empty or unfinished, and the Resurrection is noticeably \nimperfect to the supernaturally sensitive. Some of the flawed Shuankhsen \nwere called “Ishmaelites” after the first mummy known to leave the service \nof Horus. Others were called “Cabiri” after the Greek alchemist who discovered \nthe spell in Egypt. The Ishmaelites and Cabiri are virtually extinct. Most have \nfallen to the Judgment of Ma’at and were sent to the afterlife permanently or \nwere caught in the Ghost Storm and shattered. Few exist, and their numbers \ncontinue to shrink. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAPEPNU \nThe most horrific of the Shuankhsen were created by a stolen version of \nthe Spell of Life cast by the dark god Set. The flawed Resurrected created in \nthis fashion were Reborn as terrible anthropomorphic monstrosities, infested \nwith demonic spirits that served the seven faces of Apophis. Bane Mummies \nserved two masters over the millennia. On earth they were subject to the will \nof Set, yet each death plunged them into the grasp of the Devourer. Once Set \nwent into hiding, they gained more independence. Set’s ghul followers \ngradually found their Undying allies more and more treacherous. \nBefore the Dja-akh struck, the demonic Apophis warned his children. \nHungry for greater power, the seven Bane Mummies gathered together in a \ndismal prison camp for Iraqi prisoners in Saudi Arabia, not far from the Rub \na1 Khali. As the Ghost Storm tore across the Empty Quarter, the faces of \nApophis joined their ritual victims in death. They glutted themselves on the \nunclean shards of djinn and souls that swept across the wasteland. Returning \nto a semblance of life filled with stolen power, the evil coven parted ways, \ndetermined to stop the Resurrection of Osiris. \nAlong with other sinister gifts, the Bane Mummies have learned the art \nof gifting dead bodies with the Bane-spirits they command, thereby \ntransforming corpses into animated minions. These vicious servants seek to \nslay the Resurrected at every turn. Fortunately, mummies rarely encounter \nthe seven deadly Faces of Apophis, but their Asekh-sen, or Reapers, are \nbecoming an increasing problem. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTHE EGYPTIAN PANTHEON \nThe ancient Egyptian people worshipped a variety of gods beyond Osiris, \nIsis, Set and Apophis, although these are central to the world ofResurrection. \nWhat follows are the most well-known gods, most of which were worshipped \nfor eons of history. \nAnubis - \nThe jackal-headed god was the son of Osiris by Set’s wife \nNephtys after she seduced him, an act that only strengthened Set’s hatred of \nhis brother. Although he was considered the first god of the dead, as his father \nrose to prominence, he became known as the psychopomp, or the conductor \nof the dead through the Underworld. He was also known as a messenger \n(particularly in the Underworld), the god of mummification (he is often \ndepicted on tombs mummifying pharoahs), and possessor of unmatched \nwisdom regarding death. \nApophis -The Great Serpent was the foe of the sun-god Ra, dwelling \nin shadow and venturing out only in attempts to devour the sun. \nBast - \nBast was known as a keeper of secrets, and blessing the faithful \nand punishing the wicked with equal ferocity. She is usually depicted with the \nhead of a cat and the body of a woman. Her worship was strongly tied to the \nnotion of the cat as a sacred animal. \nBes -This misshapen dwarf was said to be so ugly that he scared even \ndemons, so he was often called upon to protect women in childbirth and \nnewborns, both tempting targets for evil spirits. Bes was also invoked as a god \nof luck and sexuality. While never formally accepted like Ra and Osiris, he \nwas nonethless beloved enough that mortals suffering from dwarfism were \nblessed in his name. \nGeb- Believed to be the father of Osiris, the spouse of the sky-goddess \nNuit and the very earth that we walk upon. \nHathor -This goddess was revered as the patron of artists, musicians \nand dancers, and associated with happiness and relief of earthly cares. \nEgyptian queens were believed to be her earthly incarnation, and wore horns \nhonoring her in ceremonial headdresses. She is usually depicted as a woman \nwith the head of a horned cow. \nHorus - \nThis mighty god is often depicted as a man with the head of \na falcon, often with one eye (the other lost to an attempt by Set to slay him). \nThe son of Osiris and Isis, he took up the fight against murderous Set after \nOsiris was forced to descend to the Underworld. \nImhotep - \nOriginally a mortal man who was the vizier and architect \nof the Pharoah Djoser, he designed the early pyramid of Saqqara and created \nthe engineering that would later lead to the Great Pyramids at Giza. His \naccomplishments as physician, astrologer and scientist were so impressive \nthat a cult honoring him sprang up after his death. His followers deified him, \nclaiming that he was the son of Ptah, the creator god. \nIsis - \nCalled the Queen of Heaven, Isis was the sister-wife of Osiris \nand the mother of Horus. She helped bring civilization to Egypt with the gifts \nof agriculture and medicine. She was also considered the mother of all magic, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthe-finest sorceress in the universe, and some called her Weret-Hekau or \n“Great Magic.” She was usually depicted as a woman wearing a vulture \nheaddress or wearing a headdress of the solar disk between two horns. \nKhonsu - \nCalled the god of the moon and associated with time, he \nis often believed to be close to Thoth. He was always depicted as a young man \nwith a royal sidelock, often playing a game of chance with Thoth. \nMa’at - The daughter of Ra and wife of Thoth, she was the \npersonification of truth, justice and order. She presided over the judgment of \nthe dead, weighing her feather against the heart of the deceased to determine \nif he had led a virtuous life. She was shown as a tall woman with an ostrich \nfeather on her head, sometimes with wings attached to her arms, and her \nsymbols were the ostrich feather and the scales. \nNephthys -The sister-wife of Set, she was later known as aprotector \nof the dead. She seduced Osiris and gave birth to the jackal-headed Anubis. \nNephthys helped Isis recover her husband after Set slew him. \nNuit -The spouse of the earth-god Geb, she is depicted as a woman \nwith a blue body covered with stars, arching high over Geb and touching him \nonly with the tips of her fingers and toes. She was said to protect the world \nfrom the outer darkness and the demons that lurked there. \nOsiris - \nAs the god of life and death, lord of the Underworld, judge \nof the dead, patron of the Nile’s flooding and vegetation, Osiris symbolized \nlife, death and rebirth. As the first living thing to die, he became lord of the \ndead. He is usually depicted as a man whose body is in white mummy \nwrappings or dressed as a pharoah, wearing the crowns of Egypt and having \nthe green skin symbolic of life and vegetation. \nRa -The sun-god was alternately claimed to be the solar disk moving \nacross the heavens or the father of the other gods. Egyptians believed that he \nsailed across the sky in a might barge by day, then plunged into the \nUnderworld at night where he would encounter Apophis. \nSekhmet - \nThis lioness-headed goddess loved the heat and noise of \nbattle, and Ra often sent her to destroy his enemies. She was believed to ride \ninto battle beside the Pharaohs, and was called the Eye of Ra. \nSet - \nMost often depicted as a man with the head of a large-eared \nanimal (possibly a donkey), he was the lord of storms and violence. Jealous \nof Osiris’ rule over men, he sought to destroy his brother and ultimately did \nso when he forced Osiris into the Underworld. Horus continues the struggle \nagainst him. \nSobek - \nSobek, usually shown as a man with the head of a crocodile, \nwas believed to be a bodyguard to the gods, keeper of the crocodile and the \nNile, and the protector of the Pharaoh, especially from evil magic. \nThoth - \nMyth disagrees with where exactly Thoth came from. Some \nclaim he was a child of Ra, but others believed that he created himself from \nthe power of language, making him a master of Hekau. He was revered as the \nscribe of the gods, the one who recorded the passing of time, the teacher of \nMankind and the inventor of writing. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTHE LANDS OF FAITH \nCalled by many the cradle of civilization, the lands of the Middle East are \nthe sites of intense religious and political struggle. The Amenti call this \nregion the Lands of Faith. Behind the scenes, the Lands of Faith are important \nin the struggles between the factions of the World of Darkness, as each seeks \nto claim the area’s physical and spiritual resources. This conflict led to the \ncreation of the first mummies long ago, and to the awakening of Osiris and \nthe creation of a new generation of the Reborn. These Reborn have come to \nclaim their troubled land and restore Ma’at to it. They have a difficult task \nahead of them. Ironically, the Web of Faith is the cause of much of the strife \nand conflict between its people. \nTHE MlEB OF FAITH \nThe origins of the Web of Faith are tied to the history of Osiris. When \nSet slew Osiris, he tore his body into 16 parts: his head, the soles of his feet, \nhis bones, his arms, his heart, his interior, his tongue, his eyes, his fist, his \nfingers, his back, his ears, his loins, his body, his head with the face of a ram, \nand his hair. Set scattered Osiris’ body across Egypt, and the Eset-a and others \nbelieve that these locations were mystically linked by the god’s essence. The \nhistorically recorded locations attributed to the parts of Osiris are: Ament of \nKoptos, Aa-ab in Elephantine, At-rut-f in Herkaleopolis Magna, Kusae, \nHeliopolis, An-Ament in Sma-behutet (Diopolis), Letopolis, Pa-Thuhen in \nSais, Meh-ta-f in Hermoplis, Athribis, Aq (Scedia), Ab in the Lybyan nome, \nHet-sera in the city of Netert, and Apis. \nMost Eset-a believe that this inconsistency of 14 locations and 16 parts \nis saved by the fact that the “face of a ram” is an allegory for one of the \nrepresentations of the creator and the fact that Osiris’ “loins” were swallowed \nby a naru fish (according to legend). The ritual self-disfigurement of the \nmummies known as the Sefekhi follows this same pattern replicated in \ngruesome personal scarification. Not surprisingly, they are one of the chief \nsupporters of the Eset-a. \nAt the beginning of the first millennium, Horus declared that the \nShemsu-heru mummies should fight Apophis on every front. He felt that the \nwar against the Great Corrupter had turned Egypt into a conquered state and \nthat it was time to carry that war to every comer of the world. This war was \nthe Diaspora, and the Shemsu-heru spent most of the next 2000 years far from \ntheir ancient homes fighting it. \nWhile the followers of Horus wandered the world, wizards in the Middle \nEast worked their magic. Devoted to the cause of unity, the Subtle Ones \nproposed an alliance with other sorcerers in their lands. They sought an end \nto the conflicts between them, and to help reinforce the wards created by King \nSolomon to keep the djinn from civilized lands. \nThe sorcerers proposed to magically link the holy sites of the Lands of \nFaith. Like a network of canals bringing water to the desert, Sekhem would \nflow among them, carried by the power of human faith through prayer or \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\npilgrimage. This power would be drawn to a central place then circulated back \nout through the web like the beating of a great heart. Representatives of \ndifferent magical traditions discussed the plan and agreed on a center that \nwould be based in the spirit world. \nPerhaps due to the foundations laid by Osiris’ death, the plan was more \nsuccessful than any hoped. Not only did the Web of Faith bring the many \ndifferent mystics of the land together in peace, but it also cast a powerful life- \naffirming energy across the land. Its power technically reaches across the \nwhole world, but it is only truly strong in the homelands of the Subtle Ones \nand their allies. The borders of the Web of Faith are difficult to trace except \nby the most potent mystics, but they are believed to extend as far south as \nTanzania, as far west as the Straits of Gibraltar, as far north as Turkey, and as \nfar east as Pakistan. \nTHE MODERN LANDS OF FAITH \nIt is beyond the scope of this work to provide an atlas and history of the \nentire Middle East, as to do so would rival a library the size of the legendary \none found in Alexandria. Nonetheless, it would be erroneous not to mention \nareas of special interest to the Amenti and other Reborn. \nEGYPT: THE TWO LANDS \nEgypt has obviously changed since its days as the height of human \ncivilization. Still, the monuments built by the ancient Egyptians remain some \nof the most majestic in the world. Egypt remains at the heart of the cause of \nthe Amenti, and it is their spiritual homeland. \nModem Egypt is made up of two ancient lands that were united by the \nancient pharaohs. Upper and Lower Egypt - \nthe latter so named because it \nlies farthest from the source of the Nile -was known as Khem, or “the Black \nLand,”due to the rich dark soil deposited by the river during its annual floods. \nUpper Egypt is known as Deshret or “the Red Land,” and it lies closest to the \nsource of the Nile. Upper Egypt is mostly made up of forbidding deserts, and \nit is here that the Amenti say Osiris banished Set. Modem residents refer to \nthe country as Misr, which means “Egypt,” as well as “inhabited andcivilized.” \nALEXANDRIA \nModern Alexandria is a city of more than four million people situated \nalong the Mediterranean Sea. It is one of the most cosmopolitan areas in \nEgypt, and it carries a strong European influence. The inhabitants have \nrecently been making an effort to recapture some of the city’s lost Egyptian \nheritage. The Amenti carefully encourage this effort. Ancient Alexandria \nwas the stronghold of the Cult of Isis for centuries and it remains so today. The \nCult of Isis dreams of restoring the Great Library of Alexandria. \nCAIRO \nThe capital city of Egypt, with its teeming suburbs and greater surrounding \nareas, holds over 16 million inhabitants. The region had been inhabited for \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthousands of years, and every culture that contacted the Egyptians left its \nmark upon the area, but it was the Arabs who made it into a great city. The \nFatimids founded Cairo in the 10th century, following their conquest of \nEgypt. They named the city A1 Qahira, which means “the victorious.’’ \nDenizens of the city generally refer to it as “Misr,” the same as Egyptians, and \nthey rarely use the foreign “Cairo.” The Amenti keep a low profile in Cairo \nfor the moment, learning what they can about the powerful servants of \nApophis, which they find infest the city. Storytellers seeking more information \nmight consult Cairo by Night. \nGIZA \nLocated across the Nile, the city of Giza is a suburb of greater Cairo, \nalthough nearly two million people live there. Giza is best known as home of \nthe great pyramids and the Sphinx. The three major structures of Giza are the \npyramid of Khufu (also called the Great Pyramid), the pyramid of Khefra, and \nthe pyramid of Mankare. Surrounding them are smaller queens’ pyramids, \ntemples, noble tombs and ancient mastabahs. The pyramids attract hundreds \nof thousands of people to Egypt each year. As some of the most ancient tombs \nof Egypt, they are asymbol of Ma’at and a place to enter the Lands of the Dead. \nSome Amenti are sure that chambers exist within pyramids that remain \nundiscovered by archaeologists. Some Amenti may even bear personal links \nto treasures of knowledge lost in these hidden rooms. \nGiza is also home to the Sphinx. Although the Sphinx dates back to the \nbuilding of the pyramid of Khefra, many speculate that it may be older. Stories \nattribute the Sphinx magical powers, including the ability to speak to people \nthroughdreams and visions. It is said to keep watchover thepyramids, though \nit actually faces away from them and stares into the rising sun. \nEDFU \nHorus and his Imkhu advisors returned to his greatest temple, still \nstanding in Edfu, between Isna and Aswan in Egypt. Though most of the \noriginal city of Djeba has fallen into rubble, the temple of Horus still stands \nnear this pleasant town whose major exports are sugar and pottery. The \nAvenger and his followers have taken control of the excavations of Egyptian \nmastabahs and Byzantine houses that lie hidden by the passing of ages. As \nhome to the hawk-headed god, Edfu is the center of the Shemsu-hem. \nABYDOS \nThe ruins of Abydos lie along the Nile in Middle Egypt. Although of only \nmild interest to tourists, Abydos is of vital importance to the Amenti. The \ncity was the stronghold of the Cult of Isis and the Children of Osiris for \ncenturies. Legend says that Abydos is where Osiris’ head fell after Set tore his \nbody to pieces, and that it is where his remains were interred after Set cast him \ninto the Lands of the Dead the second time. \nMost of the original city of Abydos has vanished from the Lands of the \nLiving, leaving only a few recognizable ruins. In Neter-khertet, however \nAbydos exists as a necropolis of ancient buildings and temples devoted to \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n.  \n-we \nOsGis. It survived the ghost storm virtually unscathed, and it is a safe haven \nfor spirits of Ma’at. The Children of Osiris consider Abydos their greatest holy \nsite. \nOTHER TOMBS \nWhile Giza and the Sphinx gamer the attention of tourists, there are \nother magnificent and important sites that dot the Egyptian landscape and sit \nupon powerful parts of the Web of Faith. They range from pyramids to \nmastabahs, and some even predate those found at Giza. \nMemphis is an ancient city that was the capitol of Egypt for thousands \nof years before the construction of Cairo, and it symbolized the power of the \npharaohs. The mud bricks and most of the city’s buildings have long since \ngiven way to time, but Memphis still exists and thrives across the Shroud in \nNeter-khertet. \nWest of the ruins of Memphis lies Saqqara, the ancient burial place of the \nOld Kingdom from the time of the Third Dynasty. Saqqara contains a number \nof tombs, including the oldest pyramid in the world, the step-pyramid of \nDjoser-Netcherikhe, which was built by Egyptian architect and wizard \nImhotep over 4500 years ago. Imhotep was so renowned that he was \neventually deified. \nThe temple at Luxor is located along the shore of the Nile in the center \nof downtown Luxor. It was built primarily during the reign of Amenhotep 111 \non top of a Middle Kingdom site. The temple features granite statues of \nRamses I1 and inscriptions honoring Amenhotep, Julius Caesar and Alexander \nthe Great. The temple served as a ceremonial joining place for the gods \ncommemorating the conception of the moon god Khonsu. \nThe temple at Karnak is the most majestic and complex ancient temple \nremaining in modern Egypt. Karnak is located several miles north of the \nLuxor temple. The Avenue of Sphinxes connects the two sites, originally \nlined with statues of smaller sphinxes. Karnak became the primary residence \nof the pharaohs during the 18th Dynasty, and each pharaoh continued to \nexpand the complex. Now it is mainly a tourist attraction, though the Cult \nof Isis maintains access to the temple’s inner chambers. \nThe ruins of ancient Thebes include mortuary temples dedicated to \nmany famous pharaohs, including Ramses 11. Hundreds of tombs can be seen \nacross from Luxor on the western banks of the Nile. Several miles west of the \nremains of Thebes stands a mountain peak that hedges one of Egypt’s greatest \narcheological sites, the Valley of Kings. Late dynasties wanted to protect their \ntombs from robbers, so they built them in a narrow valley guarded by high \ncliffs on three sides, and accessible only through a single narrow pass. The \nplan was unsuccessful and most of the tombs were plundered long before they \nwere rediscovered in the modern era. Ancient tem-akh speak of undiscovered \ntombs and secret entrances to the Valley of the Kings. Some Amenti use the \nsites to conduct powerful rituals or as resting places for their khat during \ndeath. \n. . .  \n. . . . . \n. . . \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAs might be expected, the Valley of Queens does not lie far from-the \nValley of Kings. It is a special burial area for the wives and children of the \nPharaohs. Families were often interred with the pharaoh, but this practice \nchanged during the rule of Ramses I, presumably as a further effort to ensure \nthe safety of the pharaoh‘s tomb. Like the Valley of Kings, the Valley of \nQueens contains hidden tombs known only to the Amenti and other servants \nof Osiris. \nARABIA \nAs has been noted, the Web of Faith actually extends far beyond the \nborders of Egypt. The Amenti often focus on their homeland in Egypt because \nit offers them a rich trove of lost knowledge, powerful access to holy sites of \nOsiris, and the comfort of lands held fondly in their ancient memories. \nNevertheless, the Web of Faith includes many other important locations, \nnotably Mecca in Arabia. \nMECCA \nThe holy city of Mecca is the heart of the Muslim world. Five times each \nday, Muslims pray toward the Ka’ba of the holy city. Millions of pilgrims visit \nMecca each year as part of the hajj, which is the pilgrimage that is the fifth \npillar of the Islamic faith (and from which the mummy pilgrimage borrows its \nname). Mecca was a holy city even before the coming of the Prophet. The \nKa’ba housed pagan idols worshipped by the Bedouin tribes, and the city was \na place for meetings and festivals along the ancient caravan routes. \nWhen Mohammed first brought the word of Allah to the city, he was \ndriven out and forced to flee to Medina. The Prophet gathered his forces there \nand returned to seize Mecca. He cast out the pagan idols from the Ka’ba, \nreconsecrating it to Allah. Ever since then, Mecca has been the greatest \nstronghold of the Islamic faith and one of the holiest places on Earth. \nIn the World of Darkness, Mecca is protected from some of the power of \nisfret by the faith invested in the city over the centuries. It is also protected \nby the powerful energies that flow through the Web of Faith into Mecca, and \nthrough the Ka’ba along the lines established by the mystics who constructed \nit. \nThe Ka’ba, or the “House of God,” is said to have been built by Abraham \nin the time of the Old Testament. It is a cube-shaped building of dark-gray \nstone that sits in the courtyard of the al-Harran mosque. In the southeast \ncomer of the Ka’ba is the Black Stone, the “Right Hand of Allah on Earth.” \nIt is a large rocksaid to have beengiven to Abraham by the archangel Gabriel. \nPart of the Islamic hajj consists of walking seven times around the Ka’ba and \nkissing the Black Stone in reverence. Some Amenti, particularly of the Eset- \na faction, call the Black Stone “the Ab of Osiris” and believe that the spiritual \nheart of the Lord of Resurrection resides within it. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTHE KEENING \nThe Ka’ba is the source of the Keening, the mystical noise that torments \nall beings of isfret in Arabia. Wards around the Ka’bacreated by vampires help \ndampen the noise, but they cannot drown it out. \nThe spiritual cry of the Keening can be heard only in the Arabian \npeninsula by enemies of Ma’at, including vampires, Bane Mummies, fomori \nand so forth. It is strongest near the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and \nappears to be tied to Mohammed’s cleansing of those cities and to the sacred \nBlack Stone. All enemies of Ma’at hear the sun rise and move across the sky, \nas the sound of the Keening grows in direct proportion to the shining of Ra. \nThose creatures that slumber during the day find their rest disturbed. In game \nterms, a foreign vampire in Arabia must expend one Willpower Trait in order \nto sleep, or he suffers an additional one-Trait difficulty to Courage checks for \nRotschreck for the following night. It is possible to grow used to the disturbing \nsound though, and after a month of adjustment these penalties do not apply. \nWithin 50 miles of Medina and Mecca, the Keening is so powerful that \nit interferes with the supernatural senses of any creature of isfret. Such \ncreatures must bid one extra Trait any time they use supernatural senses such \nas Auspex, Ghostsight, sensory Sphere magic, etc. Even Simple Tests require \nthe creature of isfret to bid one Trait. Furthermore, the cost of supernatural \npowers is doubled for creatures of isfret when used on Islamic holy ground, \nincluding all mosques. Powers using blood, Chi, Gnosis, etc., require the \nexpenditure of twice the normal number of Traits. Also, no creature of isfret \ncan enter Mecca or Medina unless it has been purified by a religious \npilgrimage. \nRUB AL KHALI: THE EMPTY QWTER \nThe southern region of Saudi Arabia is a vast desolate desert known as \nRub A1 Khali, “The Empty Quarter.’’ The desert is home to only a few \nwandering tribes of Bedouins, with no signs of civilization, and often no \nindications of life. Cities once existed here, but they were home to the \nmalevolent djinn called the devil-kings. The followers of the Prophet and \ntheir allies destroyed those foul places during the Jyhad, and allowed sand and \ntime to claim them. What remains is little more than legend. \nThe desolation found in the Rub A1 Khali, and perhaps the lingering \npower of the devil-kings, weakens the Web of Faith over this land until it \nunravels to naught in the deepest of the waste. The Reborn find it an \ninhospitable place where they cannot even draw Sekhem from the Web. \nSome Amenti feel they must guard against the forces that gather in the \ndeserts. The Bedouin tribes speak of malevolent djinn appearing in the \ndesolate depths of the Empty Quarter - \nferal ghuls who hunger for blood, \nwizards who raise storms from nothingness. They speak of ancient evils buried \nin the sand which grow restless.. .. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTHE LANDS OF THE DEAD \nThe ancient Egyptians believed that death was merely a passage into \nanother stage of existence, rather than an end. They prepared carefully for \ntheir journey to this land, anxious to ensure their eternal well-being. \nTHE SHROUD \nThe Shroud is a wall between the physical and spirit realms that divides \nlife from death. It limits the ability of the living to see and feel the presence \nof the dead, and it tries to keep the dead from interfering in the world of the \nliving. The Shroud is not uniform in strength; it is often thinner in places with \na strong connection to faith, spirit and death. It is weakest at sacred sites, \nburial ruins and holy ground. It is little surprise that the Shroud is weaker over \nthe whole of the Lands of Faith, particularly in Egypt, than it is elsewhere in \nthe world. \nNETER-KNERTET: THE SHADOWLANDS \nNeter-khertet means “divine underworld place.” It is a dark mirror of the \nLands of the Living that lies just on the other side of the Shroud. The land, \nsea and sky appear much like their earthly counterparts, but they are paler. \nThe only things that truly exist inNeter-khertet are the spirits of the dead and \nthe spirits of items, or relics, that once inspired strong feelings. Neter-khertet \nis a place made from distant memories and ancient history, which the Lands \nof Faith have in plenty. \nThe places that have long since crumbled to dust and ash in the Lands \nof the Living still exist in Neter-khertet, though all have suffered from the \nforce of the Dja-akh. Tombs and temples that turned to sand still stand on the \nother side. Those dead who cannot leave the world behind pass among us, just \non the other side of the Shroud. They cannot touch or affect things in the \nLands of the Living without expending great energy, yet they derive strength \nfrom their tenuous connections to the living world. \nPILLARS OF THE WEST \nIf you travel westward from Neter-khertet, you eventually enter a vast \nstretch of desert beyond which lie the Pillars of the West. The Pillars are a \ngateway to h a t .  It is difficult to explain to a mortal how to reach the Pillars \nof the West as they are entirely outside of the realm of Neter-khertet. Spirits \nhave ways of traveling that defy the physical realm, and when they reach the \nPillars they are no longer close to the Lands of the Living. They have made \ntheir way to the Lands of the Dead. \nThe Pillars, each carved in the form of one of the 42 Judges of Ma’at, \nsupport the entrances to 21 great caverns. The caverns lead into a maze of \nunderground tunnels through which travelers must find their way in order to \nreach Duat. The caverns and tunnels often contain different challenges to \ntest the worthiness of those who enter, which is believed to be the Judges of \nMa’at invoking their power through the Tests of the Pillars. Sometimes, \nhowever, a mummy or spirit instead finds a stream where the jackal-headed \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAnubis or one of the Aken waits to carry her into the Byways of the \nUnderworld. \nDUAT: THE UNDERWORLD \nThe caverns of the Pillars of the West open into an endless black desert \ntom by the raging Dja-akh into an eternal storm which is powerful enough \nto tear a spirit to ribbons. Strange creatures dwell within the depths of the \nstorm, howling madly for victims to devour. Travel here is dangerous, but \nthankfully Anubis, the guide and guardian of the dead, created and maintains \nsafe pathways through Duat. Such passages are known as Byways, and a \nmummy spirit in the care of Anubis or one of the Aken, his loyal boatmen, \ncan usually travel these spirit routes safely. \nUsually Anubis or one of his ghostly boatmen is on hand at the entrance \nto Duat when a spirit arrives from the caverns of the Pillars of the West. \nShould the mummy or spirit specifically seek the Judges of Ma’at, Anubis \nalways appears. \nAMENTI: THE RUINED KINGDOM OF SAND \nAmenti was once the grand spiritual city that served as a haven to the \nEgyptian dead. Osiris sat silently as its ruler for millennia and ancient ghosts \nsheltered in his glory, and mummies traveled here between lives. The Dja-akh \nshattered Amenti, and its wraithly citizens were either destroyed outright or \nflayed until they were scattered fragments. The ruins of Amenti lie beneath \nthe black desert of Duat, haunted by malevolent ghosts and creatures from the \ndepths of the Dja-akh. Few Reborn see any reason to go there, though some \nsay the city must surely contain ancient relics and lore that once belonged to \nthe Egyptian dead. Regardless, the Amenti bear the name of the city to honor \nits memory and ensure that it is never forgotten. \nTHE BLESSED FIELDS OF A’ARU \nThe ancient Egyptians spoke of a heaven where their sahu traveled to \nlive in peace and plenty. The Fields of A’aru were closed to the other aspects \nof the soul, however, and thus Amenti stood for thousands of years as home \nto the dead. Those who have undergone the new Resurrection are joined into \none being, however, and Anubis has revealed that they may enter A’aru. In \nthis place, their souls find renewal and peace, or they seek the judgment of the \nJudges of Ma’at. \nLEXTCON \nThis section presents a lexicon of the mythical terms as mummies in the \ngame refer to them. Not every one of the Reborn will know all of these, but \none can be certain that wise Imkhu and clever Storytellers will use them. \nA’aru, Fields of: A spiritual realm said to be the Egyptian equivalent of \nheaven. After the destruction of Amenti, many surviving Egyptian souls \nmoved here. Anubis guides spirits, including those of mummies, who have \nbeen judged worthy of paradise to these holy fields of rest. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAmenti: The former Egyptian city of the dead in the Underworld, \ndestroyed by the Dja-akh.

The meaning of “balance” in Egyptian \nmythology derives from the belief that the goddess Ma’at weighs the heart of \na dead spirit that comes before her against the feather of Ma’at. Should it be \nsuitably free of sin, and therefore balance with the feather of justice, then the \ndead soul is allowed into A’aru. \nBane Mummies: The seven mummies who serve Apophis and were \ncreated by a perverted version of the ritual of Resurrection.

When a modem soul fuses with an Egyptian one, it becomes one \nof the agents of Balance, effectively immortal and enjoying powers and strengths it \nnever knew in life. It also suffers from weaknesses and liabilities unique to its fused \nnature. \nMummies do not organize themselves according to their tem-akh, nor do they \nusually classify others by the same. The tem-akh is only one part of a whole, and each \ntem-akh creates a different person when it joins with another soul. The Amenti learn \nquickly that such generalizations are foolish, not to mention dangerous. While some \nmannerisms may strike them as being typically of one tem-akh or another (“Scroll- \nbearers do nothing without a briefing”, “She is Sefekhi- they thirst for blood one way \nor another”), the tem-akh is secondary to Amenti identity. \nWhat follows is acloser look at each Amenti and the aspects of the new souls now \nwalking the night: \nTitle - \nThe name of that type of Amenti. \nOverview - \nA general description of the tem-akh’s role, followed by what it \nlooks for in mortal hosts, and how the new-joined soul lives following Rebirth. \nThe Hajj - \nThe mortal frame, suffused with borrowed life from the tem-akh, \nmakes a journey back to the Lands of Faith to undergo the new Spell of Life.

It lurks in the Underworld as anear-mindless drone \ndedicated to the preservation of the body. Ghosts who didn’t know \nEgyptian cosmology, but did know the practical reality of vengeful \nguardians, dubbed ka spirits “Tomb Watchers,” and when the first \nAmenti searched for names for themselves, the label suited them. \nThe ka did well guarding their respective khat from the \nnderworld’s myriad dangers, but not so well against physical \nthreats. Thieves stole the khat’s treasures. Physicians and \nmagicians ground up the khat itself to use its powder. \nesting places and bodies fell into decay. Only a handful \nof ka succeeded in their assigned duty. When the great \nstorm blasted through the Underworld, the surviving \nka retained their passionate love of life and devotion \nto the body’s sanctity. \nThe ka chooses its host from among the ranks of \nthose who did not love or care for their own lives. Some \nKher-minu suffered from deformity and illness, others from \nself-destructive habits, still others from tragic accidents. The \nka avoids the very famous, though many minor and struggling \ncelebrities brought down prematurely appeal to searching \nka. The ideal nehem-sen is attractive but without purpose \nand is doomed by its absence. \nOnce reborn into the Third Life, the Kher-minu no \nlonger suffers from the addictions and vices of the Second \nLife. He remembers how it was to be a junkie or anorexic, \nand speaks of those lost evils with fanatical passion, but his \nnew soul offers no hook for such lapses. The Kher-minu \naptitude for making protective amulets follows the drive to \nprotect the body - \nfirst his own, and secondly those who \nwill listen to his message of the body’s sanctity. \nOther Amenti often regard the Kher-minu as cowardly. \nIn fact, most Kher-minu willingly plunge into tremendous \ndanger and make great sacrifices on behalf of the body, both \ntheir own and others’. It lookscowardly because it’s defensive \nrisk-taking - \nacting to forestall danger, or to remove it from \na particular place, rather than striking to eliminate the \nThe Hajj: The great march of cultures through time \nexposes many ka to a variety of languages, which \nmakes the first pilgrimage easier. Many ka seek out \ntheir remains from the First and Second Lives to \nresolve unfinished business along the way. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe Third Life: The Tomb Watcher’s highest priority \nThe ka encourages him to learn how to protect himself: to study survival techniques, \ndefensive martial arts and everything else that keeps a person safe in an uncertain \nworld. The ka steers the Tomb Watcher away from dangerous vices like smoking and \ndrinking, and even the perils of sloth (driving without a seatbelt and so on). But the \nTomb Watcher’s life is not one of boring, fearful isolation. The ka takes care of the \nTomb Watcher so that he can enjoy life more fully: to see beautiful sights, to eat \ndelicious meals, to savor the beauty of the arts, to look handsome or beautiful - \nall \nthe pleasures the world has to offer. \nMost Tomb Watchers take up occupations that let them focus on defending a \nparticular place or person, such as mortician, cemetery caretaker or security guard. \nSome also seek personal celebrity or a connection to stardom, like bodyguard work. \nAs the Tomb Watcher matures in his understanding of Ma’at, he becomes more \nconcerned for the lives of others as well as himself. High-Balance Kher-minu feel \ncompelled to become vegetarian, to consume products that generate no lasting waste, \nto become involved in conflict resolution, and the like. They recognize all life as \nequally precious. \nAffiliations: Horus’ cause attracts many Tomb Watchers. Kher-minu more \ndevoted to protecting the dead often gravitate to the Eset-a, with Osiris’ resurrection \nas both the first and greatest mission and the symbol of their devotion to every body’s \nsanctity. \nCharacter Creation: Social or Physical Attributes are usually primary for Tomb \nRaiders. Most have Naturesconcernedwithneedand the drive for attention. Abilities \noften include Performance and artistry of various kinds. The ka brings with it an \naptitude for languages and Abilitiesrelated to protecting abody inhostile circumstances, \nfrom ritual lore to survival skills. High Willpower is very common, since it took \nexceptional determination for the ka to survive while so many others perished. Allies \nand Fame are common Backgrounds. \nPrimary Hekau: Amukts \nPurpose: The Defender, or the Shielding Self. The ka works to preserve the \nKher-minu’s body from all harm, and can act in some ways on its own, independently \nof the body’s physical actions. It can even reach out to lightly manipulate those who \nwould harm the Kher-minu. Each turn, the character gets one extra Physical Trait per \nBalance Trait to bid in defensive actions. These Traits are useful only in physical \ndefense. \nLiability: The ka works very hard to protect the body, including self-inflicted \nharm. The character must win a Static Willpower Challenge to engage in any action \nthe ka would regard as harmful. Drinking enough alcohol to get drunk and similar \nrelatively minor abuses require winning against five Traits. Entering a fight, smoking \nand other overtly dangerous undertakings require winning against seven Traits. \nFighting against a superior foe or otherwise immediately risking life and limb requires \nwinning against nine Traits. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nKHRI-HAD1 \nSCROLL-BEARERS: BkAREEG OF THE BOOK \nThe ba spirit performs the duties of a righteous soul while in the Underworld to \nensure its body’s eventual resurrection. The ba roams through the Underworld, \nparticipating in the necessary rites and continuing to learn. Egyptian art often portrays \nthe ba with wings, and indeed, many baspirits do have wings. The presence or absence \nof wings doesn’t affect their swift movement among the dead, but the association with \nthe falcon and hawk imagery used to portray Ra and Horus reminds artist and ba alike \nA weak ba lets the soul succumb to the influence of one \nof the other spirits, whether it’s the ka’s obsession with \npreservation (a futile task without the spiritual foundation \nfor resurrection) or the khaibit’s mindless pursuit of \nvengeance and violence. Strong ba generally dwelled in the \ncity of Amenti and staffed the city’s priesthood and army, \nhence the name Scroll-bearers. They carried the records that \nlet the city function, scribing much on wars, treaties and \nexplorations, the cryptic oracles of the prophets and even more \nryptic messages straight from the gods. \nThe Dja-akh storm took all that away, and many ba lost \nhope, letting the wind carry them into annihilation. It wasn’t \nalways the strongest who survived, but those who most clearly \nremembered Osiris’ promises and sought out souls to save. The ba \nis the spiritual manifestation of the conscious mind, and the \nsurviving tem-akh possess deep wells of wisdom, insight and \nleadership. They’re drawn to mortals who are weak-willed or \nweak-minded - \ndominated by instinct, habit, dogma, peers \nand authorities, whatever interferes with the individual mind’s \ncareful thought. Petty criminals, abused children (or parents, \nor spouses), unthinking followers of state, church or corporate \ncreed - \nthey all need a stronger ba. \nThe Hajj: The ba’s strength of intellect gives it great \nadvantages on the pilgrimage. The price for this insight is \nspeed: It takes time for the ba to make the best decisions, and \ntherefore the hajj goes slowly. \nThe Third Life: The ba joins with its new host \nknowing that the host has little experience in independent \nthought. The first duty, therefore, is to teach the Scroll- \nbearer sound habits of decision-making and to drive out \nbad habits formed because of thoughtlessness. This \nteaching is often not fun or comfortable for either part \nof the fused entity. What makes it tolerable is that the \nba doesn’t just punish; it shows the host what she \nmissed in the Second Life, opening up vast new vistas \nand ways to think about the world around her. The \nhost learns how independence feels, and begins to \nof the powers whom the ba must properly serve. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nexperience pleasures she chooses rather than ones someone else decreed she should \nfind sufficient. As the host finds out what life is like, she’s driven to help others find \nit. Scroll-bearers naturally turn to careers like therapist, doctor, psychologist, astrologer \nand pastor to help others liberate their minds. \nThe Scroll-bearer affinity for Alchemy draws directly on the ba’s insights into the \nworkings of the world. It’s also a symbol of the ba’s great mission, to turn dead and \nbaseless souls into the precious riches they can be. \nAffiliations: Scroll-bearers often engage directly with mortal institutions, seeking \nout places where they can help. There are minds everywhere in the world, and they \nall need help to achieve Ma’at. Hospitals, social-service agencies, churches and relief \norganizations all appeal to Scroll-bearers, as do service-oriented positions even in \nmore generic enterprises, like government ministries and corporate offices. (A Scroll- \nbearer who can direct the corporate philanthropy of a Fortune-500 firm, for instance, \ncan make a lot of difference in the world.) Of the factions among mummies, the Cult \nof Isis appeals to most Khri-habi, with its emphasis on healing. The Shemsu-heru also \nattracts Scroll-bearers who feel they should focus on a supernatural quest rather than \nthe mundane good of their neighbors. \nCharacter Creation: Scroll-bearers can come from any social stratum, since \nevery class from very rich to very poor contains some pressures against independent \nthought, moral resolve and creative vision. Once the union of souls is complete, \nMental or Social Attributes are primary in new Scroll-bearers (and this is usually a \nstrange feeling for the mummy until she becomes used to her new capabilities). \nIntellectual Abilities of all kinds are very common, since Scroll-bearers learn rapidly, \nand Backgrounds dealing with access to information are very common. The Nature \nreflects the Second Life and its deficiencies, providing the inner challenge that drew \nthe ba in the first place. \nPrimary Hekau: Alchemy \nPurpose: The Bird, or Spirit Self. The ba travels between the Underworld and \nthe living world, harvesting energy for the body to use in healing. It is the mother bird \ncaring for her fledging offspring who cannot care for themselves. Each sunrise, the \ncharacter gets one healing Trait per Balance Trait. Each of these healing Traits cures \none level of lethal damage or two levels of bashing damage, either in the Khri-habi or \nin someone else she touches. \nLiability: The recently deceased part of the Khri-habi was deficient in self- \nidentity, ethics or strength of personality. When circumstances require a judgment on \nmatters of morals and identity, the Khri-habi must sort through the vast legacy of the \nba in search of advice and information. This takes time and leaves the character \nnoticeably distracted at crucial moments. The character suffers a two-Trait penalty to \nPerception- and Wits-related challenges, and is two Traits down in the first round of \ncombat. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nM E S E E T  \nVESSELS OF RA: NIGHT SUNS \nThe sahu is the part of the soul that, in Egyptian belief, ascends to heaven and \neternity - \nit’s the part that most resembles what people of Christian cultures would \nconsider the “soul.” The Corruptor’s power extended even to this innermost spirit, \nsince corruption in the other layers of the soul could delay the sahu’s ascent to the \nFields of A‘aru for eternal reward or even force the sahu into servitude. But most of the \ntime, the sahu went to its glorious reward. \nThe storm in the Underworld struck \nA’aru as well as everywhere else, and it pulled \nthe sahu back into realms closer to the living, \nreminding them that they had obligations to the \nliving. Many sahu failed to cope with the shock \nand then perished. Others despaired of reunion \nwith their counterparts and the state of the \nworld, and succumbed to Apophis’ \nblandishments. The loss of other soul parts \ninflicted deep wounds ineverv sahu, no matter \n1 I \nhow they responded. \nThe survivors looked at the world and found it \nunrecognizable. Even the land had changed - \nile’s flow constrained by dams and the boundaries \n2 deserts changed- and the people were altogether \n:rent. Ma’at was gone. The sahu realized that the \nliving world needed them, that bliss would have to \nwait.. . possibly for a very long time. \nThe sahu are drawn to mortals whose lives \nwere built on deception, superficiality, folly and \nshort-sightedness. These are the souls going \nnowhere, especially not to the Fields of A’aru. A \nsahu fuses with such a soul to bring it integrity and \nhonesty, and the desire to live truthfully and to match \nwords with deeds. \nThe ritual of rebirth leaves the sahu’s association \nwith Ra’s power intact. Daytime is the VesselofRa’s time \nof strength and power, while darkness is the time of \nweakness and isolation. Some mummies believe that the \nsahu itself withdraws-to support Ra in his nightly battle \nagainst Apophis in the realm ofnight beyond the world. \nCertainly the mummy has reduced reserves. \nAlthough the Vessel of Ra’s power is reduced at \nnight, his vision remains unclouded. He can see fate \nin the stars as few others can. and his aptitude for \nCelestial Hekau flows from this informed \nL-k \nperception. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe Hajj: The pilgrimage takes longer for Vessels of Ra than for other tem-akh \nbecause they cannot travel during the nighttime hours and instead must slumber. \nThey even lose some daytime hours as sunset approaches because they must search for \na hiding place. \nThe Third Life: Atonement dominates the start of a Vessel of Ra’s Third Life. \nAs a mortal in the Second Life, he exploited others one way or another, and the sahu’s \nmemories of Paradise expose this exploitation for the ghastly evil it is. The Vessel of \nRa applies his old talents -and \nthe new power from the sahu- to remedy the wrongs \nhe has committed. Of all the Amenti, the Vessel is mostly likely to attempt to engage \nvery closely and persistently with the legacy of his old life. \nAs this initial mission begins to succeed, the mummy has time to think about \nwider consequences. Celestial magic and other Hekau show him the unseen world, and \nhis native abilities let him analyze what’s at hand with preternatural wisdom. He seeks \nways to help others avoid the sort of wrongs he committed and repair those already \ndone, but must balance his drive with the understanding that every soul must make \nits own decisions, since coercion is precisely one of the sins that makes Vessels of Ra \nin the first place. There must always be room for failure, or success means nothing in \nthe great scheme of things. \nAffiliations: Vessels of Ra are usually drawn to places where people pursue justice \nand where the flow of information helps to change the world: courts, stock exchanges, \nuniversities and embassies, etc. The Vessels divide their sympathies more or less \nevenly among the mummy organizations, since all the factions’ causes contain an \nelement of the pursuit of justice. \nCharacter Creation: The demands of alife of manipulation and abuse strengthen \nSocial Attributes, and so remain primary for most Vessels of Ra. Physical Attributes \nare usually tertiary, since the manipulator was more likely to hire muscle than to \nprovide it himself. Abilities relating to deception are common, as are Occult, \nCosmology, Meditation and other tools of spiritual insight after rebirth. Corrupt \nofficials, great and small, make excellent candidates for Vessels of Ra, but the \ntemperament can manifest anywhere in modern society. \n, \nPrimary Hekau: Celestial \nPurpose: The Eternal, or Perfect Self. The sahu draws the Mesektet into \nconstant searching for the will of the gods and the shape of the future, creating a \nhunger for oracles and providing the power both to receive and to understand them. \nThe character can draw on his intuitive sense of fate and possibilities to rework the \npresent: Each day he can retest any one challenge just completed per Balance Trait. \nThe results of the retest apply whether or not they improve on the original results. \nLiability: The sahu is very closely tied to Ra’s cycle, and when the sun sets, the \nsahu falls into a kind of eclipse until the next sunrise. The Mesektet, left to his own \ndevices, suffers confusion and exhaustion in the sahu’s absence. Many spend the whole \nnight in comalike slumber. The character suffers a two-Trait penalty on all challenges \nbetween sunset and sunrise. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSAKHMU \nSPIRIT SCEPTERS \nThe khu spirit connects an individual’s physical and spiritual forms, turning a body \nand a set of disparate souls into a single entity. When a person dies, the khu wraps its \nprotective caul around the soul and carries it to safety beyond the Shroud, all the while \npreserving a link with the khat. Funerary rites assist the khu in this transaction and help \nthe soul remove itself from the caul at the appropriate time. The soul goes on - \nthe ba \non its errands, the sahu to the Fields of A’aru - \nand the khu lingers on the edges of the \nspiritual world, providing a beacon for the other portions of the individual’s soul. The \nfigurines of servants, tools and weapons placed in Egyptian tombs provided the khu with \nresources for its mission, or so the priests and sorcerers hoped. \nTomb-raiding made it more difficult. Mummies dragged from tombs to magicians’ \nworkshops, museums and other distant locations brought their khu with them. Cut off \nfrom most of their resources for support, the khu had to struggle (usually alone) to do \ntheir duty in unfamiliar lands and times. Ambitious khu hoped that they could draw on \nthe energy of young civilizations interested in the Egyptian legacy to rebuild all that had \nbeenlost, until the Dja-akhstruck. Weakkhushattered inan instant, leaving only those \nbright enough to find refuge within their respective bodies or protective effigies. \nIn Egyptian ritual, the sakhmu was a wooden weapon, between a sword and a mace, \nrepresenting the bond between temporal and divine duties. In the new tempestuous \nreality, some khu took the name and called themselves the Spirit Scepters. They were \ninstruments of justice and symbols of the greater whole, drawn to mortals who were dull, \nselfish, plodding or self-centered in life-people whose minds did not radiate the strength \nof thought and wisdom which is characteristic of the khu. In particular, people who \nstruggled to achieve something lasting but lacked the ability or understanding to do it \nsuccessfully call out to the khu, which enters and shows the mortal what she needs to know \nto grasp her ambition’s place in the infinitely complex web of spiritual and physical ties. \nThe khu relied on effigies made by others long ago, and retain their interest in such \ncreations. Efigj lets them apply their insights most effectively. \nThe Hajj: The khu has experience inhabiting prepared vessels and usually makes \nthe hajj with little complication, apart from the innate limitations imposed by \nunfamiliar languages and cultures. \nThe Third Life: The new Spirit Scepter begins her Third Life with inspiration. She \nsees how to do what she’s tried and failed at, and much more. Everything around her makes \nsense in a way it never did before, as a thing in itself and as part of ever-greater systems. She \nderives great pleasure from creating and from understanding others’ creations. \nAs she matures, she comes to appreciate fully how every single thing fits into the \nuniversal design of Ma’at. Evil and discord become more acutely painful to her, since she \nknows how their harm resonates throughout the world, and purely self-indulgent \nexpression becomes a waste of time. Her art and life take on an ever-sharper edge, thanks \nto her drive to share her insights with others - \nin whatever social class she moves, she \nwants those she encounters to realize how much beauty they can have and how great \nthe stakes of its loss are. She does not stop being herself, but she is increasingly aware \nof being a gateway between the worlds- a messenger carrying the spirit world’s eternal \ntruths to an unsuspecting mortal audience. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n . \ne\n-\n*\n.\n.\n \n. \nAffiliations: Spirit Scepters have widely varying talents, and ea \nsomeplace in mortal society where his particular abilities matter.

The \ncharacter may substitute her Balance rating for \nher Ability level in any artistic challenge, once per \nBalance Trait each day. This extends beyond the obvious \ncases like Expression, Performance and Crafts to include \nComputers, Finance and other skills where there’s an \naesthetic element, such as a particularly elegant hack. \nPhysical Challenges can also have this element of \ndistinctive beauty and qualify for the purpose’s benefit, \nbut the Storyteller’s authority is final when it comes to \nthe benefit’s suitability for use in combat. The khu may \neven withdraw and remove this benefit for hours or days \nin response to attempts to exploit it in abusive ways (at \nthe Storyteller’s discretion). \nLiability: The strong khu is hard to hide; there’s a \ndistmctive, ifnot subconxious, sense ofselfthat is associated \nwith the character. The character suffers a two-Trait \npenalty on all challenges to remain anonymous or avoid \ndetection. Those searching for her receive a two-Trait \nbonus in Perception-related challenges.

It usually remains attached in the \nUnderworld to the ka or ba, who temper it in an exchange \nof passion for prudence. Without akhaibit, the rest of the \nsoul falls into apathy and loses the will to survive; the \nkhaibitprovides the drive to persist in the face ofchallenges. \nThe khaibit is therefore both necessary and dangerous - \n- -ovemed, it drags the soul into madness and destruction. \nDetached khaibit served the city of Amenti as warriors \nI assassins, employing their violent urges in the sewice of \n: community’s need. They survived the Dja-akh better \nan most, accustomed as they were to coping with \nnleashed destruction, and they went rampaging \nndependently through the Underworld.

TheUnbandaged \nOne must learn how to channel this violence toward overall constructive ends, to \nserve as a warrior rather than a random killing machine. \nAs she progresses toward Ma’at, she comes to realize the part she plays in the \nscheme of things, and how terribly important it is for her to avoid the traps of passivity \nand timidity. She must do what others cannot or will not, so that the world as a whole \ncan survive and flourish. She becomes clever, attending to strategy as well as tactics. \nAffiliations: Very few Unbandaged Ones enjoy lasting connections to mortal \ninstitutions. Their eeriness, unpredictability and independence make them difficult \nallies at best; they breed dissent and conflict. Cloistered religious and philosophical \nmovements provide some Unbandaged Ones with time for healing and meditation, \nand extremist societies bent on improvement at any cost give outlet to the khaibit’s \ndesires. Within mummy society, almost all Unbandaged Ones affiliate either with the \nChildren of Osiris or with the Eset-a. Few Sefekhi mention it, but in addition to seeing \nthemselves as manifestations of Osiris on Earth, they dream that healing the god will \nlead to healing for themselves as well. \nCharacter Creation: The mortal side of the Unbandaged One was docile in life, \nand generally has a Nature to match. After rebirth, Physical Attributes are usually \nprimary, with Social Attributes being tertiary. In some cases, particularly when the \nmortal side was repressed rather than just lax, Mental Attributes may be primary. \nKnowledge-related Abilities of all kinds are common, as the khaibit brings millennia \nof insights into the world’s problems along with the desire to confront those problems \nand destroy them utterly. High Willpower is almost mandatory for the soul to avoid \nconstant khaibit-driven frenzy. \nPrimary Hekau: Necromancy \nPurpose: The Shadow, or Instinctive Self. The khaibit gives the mummy the \npower to persist in the face of physical adversity. The character may retest one \nStamina-related Challenge or resistance effort per Balance Trait each day, from \nmidnight to midnight. The new result applies whether or not it improves on the \noriginal result. \nLiability: The khaibit’s constant craving for violence colors the mummy’s \nbehavior, even when the character would prefer to give some other impression. The \ncharacter suffers a two-Trait penalty on all Social Challenges except those involving \nintimidation and coercion. This does not apply to other mummies, non-mummies \nwho understand the situation (like the priests of Osiris), other supernatural beings \nwho themselves create panic-inciting effects (such as the Delirium), and very \nderanged individuals, at Storyteller’s discretion. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nUDJA-SEN \nJUDGED ONES \nSometimes it doesn’t work out quite right. Anubis leads the soul joined with its \ntem-akh by the Rite of Rebirth before the Judges of Ma’at. When the result is clearly \ninsufficient to take up the burdens that Osiris intends, new and old soul alike are cast \naway to become fodder for the beast Amemait. Worthy unions return to the deceased \nbody to become one of the Amenti. In between the clear-cut cases, ambiguity reigns. \nThe tem-akh may replace the most damaged or least developed part of a soul \nwhile leaving another part still crucially weak. Indeed, the stress of the union may \ncreate fresh spiritual problems. In cases where the Judges see potential for the result, \nthey excise part of the united soul for discarding while allowing the rest to return to \nits body. The tem-akh is stretched to cover the holes and loses most of its memories, \nand the modem soul likewise bends and breaks. The product can return to life and \nserve the great cause, but it carries inner wounds as constant reminders of being not \nquite worthy. Other mummies and their admirers among the resurrection cults call \nthese damaged mummies “the Udja-sen,” or Judged Ones. \nMost Judged Ones hate their condition and regard it as unfair. A few aim to prove \nthemselves worthy of healing in the hopes that mastery of Balance may mend their \nwounds. Others turn their back on the struggle for Ma’at and try to make their own \nway in the world. They lack the inner guiding voice other mummies enjoy, since their \ntem-akh were pushed and broken to allow for survival at all. Judged Ones carry no \nautomatic awareness of Osiris’ righteousness or the necessity for Ma’at, and must \ninstead rely on their own conscience and judgment. They seek a hypothetical \nredemption without external guideline, or even the assurance that it actually exists. \nThe Hajj: A Judged One begins with one of the other five tem-akh types and \nmakes the journey to the Lands of Faith as usual. The damage done in reconstruction \nusually removes all memories of the trip. \nThe Third Life: A Judged One’s existence begins with pain and immediately \npasses on to condemnation. He knows with his first clear thought that there’s \nsomething wrong with him. He cannot remember much of either his First Life or his \nSecond Life, and lacks the guiding spiritual force other mummies feel. Alienation \nusually follows quickly, and Apophis’ minions prey on Judged Ones’ doubts and \nangers. A successful Judged One must find some way to cope with the permanent \nwounds he carries and some purpose to guide his actions into an uncertain future. \nThe Judged One does have some unique advantages, and in time the blessings \nimplicit in them may become clear. His freedom to go where he wants without loss of \npower lets him extend the quest for Ma’at to places other mummies cannot safely go, \nand he can choose the terms on which he deals with other mummies. He is free, not \nmerely cast out. \nAffiliations: Every Judged One is distinctive, though they do share the fact that \nmore than one part of their soul was out ofbalance. Some Udja-sen are drawn to groups \nadvocating individual freedom and responsibility, but that’s just one intellectual \ncurrent among many for the Judged Ones. Some seek redemption through piety and \nholiness, while others seek revenge on those responsible for their deficiencies. Almost \nevery imaginable way of dealing with mortal society turns up somewhere among the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nranks of the Judged Ones. Storytellers and players can choose options that suit their \nparticular chronicles without worrying about whether most concepts are innately \ninappropriate for the Judged Ones. \nOf the major organizations dealing with mummies, only the \nCult of Isis extends more than the frostiest welcome. \nCharacter Creation: Mental Attributes are primary \namong most Judged Ones who last; those who lack a high \ndegree of intelligence and wits don’t survive. Physical \nstamina is also very common among the Judged Ones. Social \nAttributes generally suffer. The character’s weakest part, the \none the tem-akh tried to heal, can be any of the categories \ndescribed on p.65. \ni \nPrimary Hekau: Any \nPurpose: The Udja-sen is less bound to the Web of \nFaith than other mummies. Each day, the character regains 1 \none Sekhem Trait per Balance Trait, regardless of where he \nis, rather than the usual one per day outside the Web of \nFaith. In addition, once per day he may transfer Sekhem \nTraits to another mummy, up to a limit ofone Sekhem per \nBalance Trait. \nLiability: The flaws in the character’s resurrection \nmake all use of Sekhem - \nincluding the transfer power \ndescribed above - - terribly \n- \npainful. Eac :h Se ikhe \nTrait the character spends inflicts one level of bashing \ndamage as it leaves him, whether it came from his own \nreserves or from an outside source, like an amulet. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nQUICK CHARACTER-CREATION PROCESS \nStage One: The Second Life \nStep One: Inspiration - \nWho are you? \n- \nChoose a concept \n- \nChoose an Amenti \n- \nChoose a Nature and a Demeanor \n- \nChoose an Inheritance \nStep Two: Attributes - \nWhat are your basic capabilities? \n- \nPrioritize Attributes (six primary, four secondary and three tertiary) \n- \nChoose Traits \nStep Three: Advantages -What do you know? \n- \nChoose five Abilities \nStep Four: Backgrounds - \nWhat are your mortal ties? \n- \nChoose three Backgrounds \nStep Five: Details - \nSmooth out the rough edges \n- \nSpend five Free Traits \nStage Two: The Rebirth \nStep One: The Second Death - \nHow did you die a second time, and \nhow were you reborn? \n- \nChoose a reason for your death and rebirth \nStep Two: Attributes - \nCompensating for where you are lacking \n- \nAdd two additional Traits to Attributes \nStep Three: Abilities - \nFurther compensation \n- \nAdd five additional Ability Traits, which can raise your current total \nabove three Traits. \nStep Four: Advantages -What have you gained in your Third Life? \n- \nChoose your Hekau and add three Traits.

An archetypal Nature illustrates the inherent tendencies in a \npersonality, while archetypal Demeanor is the character’s outward behavior to \nthe world. \nDuring gameplay, a character’s Nature serves as behavioral motives that \nare not easily swayed by intimidation or other means, which signifies that you \ncan call for a retest if commanded or bullied into violating your Nature. It is \nessential to keep your character’s Nature a secret because it can, should anyone \ndiscover it, be used against you in the same fashion as a Negative Trait might \nbe, compelling you into a challenge. \nExample: Michael, a Sefekhi, has been asked by an executive ofAshukhi to take \nonanunusualassignment. The taskiseasy-tooeasy-andMichaelrefuses, \nsaying \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nlet youwriggleout ofthis. There’sareasonfor hawing youon thismission.” He pauses \nand adds, “Well, if you really feel that way, 1’11 just send A&. You’re not the \nCompetitor I thought you were.” The two go to a challenge, and because the \nexecutive guessed Michael’s Nature, Michael must venture two Traits. They test, \nand Michael loses. Grumbling, but with his dander up (Not a Competitor?! Ha!), \nMichael heads out to start packing. \nNatures can change over time, and many Amenti’s tem-akh seek just such \na change. The Nature of the Second Life can feel very comfortable to slip into, \nbut the tern-akh attempts to goad the character into something greater. This \neffort should be roleplayed out, with the Storyteller deciding when your \nAmenti has finally achieved the new Nature. It costs nothing to change \nNatures. \nArchitect - \nYou seek to build something of lasting value, to leave a \nlegacy that can be passed down for generations to come. You dream of the day \nwhen the youth of the future study your legacy in their textbooks or walk \nthrough a park dedicated to your memory. \nAvant-Garde - \nIf it’s not original or cutting-edge, it’s not you. You \ndon’t like to surround yourself with the past, preferring to be focused on what’s \nahead. \nBravo - \nIt’s all about respect and if you aren’t getting the proper \namount, you aren’t above bullying whomever you must to get it. \nBureaucrat -The \nlaws of the land are written for the protection of all, \nand it is your duty to act as a model citizen. Without the laws there is only chaos, \nand that is unacceptable. \nCaregiver - \nYou have a soft spot in your heart for anyone weaker than \nyou, and you feel the need to protect the innocent and downtrodden. \nChild - \nThough you exude an air of innocence and naivete, and \nwhining gets you everything you’ve ever needed. People are drawn to your \napparent innocence and try to shelter you from danger. \nCompetitor - \nYou must finish first and be the best of the best. Doing \nyour best is no substitute for the greater glory of winning every time. You won’t \ncheat to beat your opponents, but you also aren’t above taking advantage of an \n“edge” when it presents itself. \nConfidant-You \nempathize withothers and seek to gain their trust. You \nhave broad shoulders to cry on and the knack for sensing when someone needs \na hug. \nConformist - \nYou need to have someone focus your attentions and \nactions, to inspire you and lead you. All you desire is a path to walk and the \nboundaries to keep you on track. \nConniver - \nW h y  do it yourself when you can get someone else to do \nit for you? If people want to promise you something they shouldn’t expect \nanything in return. \nCritic - \nYou have a knack for revealing the weaknesses and faults of \nothers. No matter how wonderful something may seem to be, you can find \nsomething wrong with it and you’re not above telling the world about it. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\noffer, but you do know that even the greatest things never last forever. \nDeviant - \nFor one reason or another you don’t conform to society’s \nviews of status quo and you couldn’t care less. \nDirector - \nIf it’s not your way it’s the highway. And all ways are your \nways. You bring order from chaos, but some of the best dictators were Directors \nat heart. \nExplorer-You have an insatiable curiosity and are driven to learn more \nabout what’s around you. You need not be a globetrotter; there are plenty of \nvistas besides mountains and lakes. \nFanatic- Your cause in life is an all-consuming obsession. Anyone who \ndoes not share your sentiments is against you. They must be adjusted accordingly, \nfor the cause. \nGallant -You live for the dramatic and always ingratiate yourself to an \naudience, thriving off their support as they cheer your boisterous disposition. \nHedonist -The end is inevitable, so you enjoy life to its fullest while \nyou still can, whether to find some new pleasure your jaded palate hasn’t \nexperienced, or to temporarily fill a spiritual void within yourself. \nJester - \nYou find humor in all things and at anyone’s expense, whether \nthey get the joke or not. Not every Jester is a wacky, happy funster. Some Jesters \nhave a sense of humor that can be quite caustic and dark. \nJudge -You \nseek truth and justice in the world around you, sorting out \nright from wrong amidst the chaos. However, your ideas of truth and justice \nmay have nothing to do with the laws on the books. \nLoner -You \nprefer solitude over companionship and tend to stay away \nfrom large groups. You don’t need anyone; you can take care of yourself. \nMartyr - \nYou expend 100% effort of your blood, sweat and tears, and \nexpect nothing in return. You’re not in it for the gratitude, just to fight the good \nfight, even if it means your death. \nPenitent - \nNothing you can do will make up for your sins, real or \nimagined. You feel a sense of worthlessness since you believe that others suffer, \nat least in part, because of your actions or lack thereof. \nPredator - \nYou are a Darwinist at heart, as the epitome of survival of \nthe fittest. You follow your instincts, and believe it is your job to separate the \nweak from the strong. \nRebel-Youconstantlysearchforareason \nto fight thesystem. Youhave \nno idea what you’ll do if you ever win; all you know is that things cannot remain \nas they are. \nShowoff - \nYou do whatever it takes to impress the people around you, \neven if you make a fool of yourself in the process. You are the boldest, rashest \nand sometimes the most asinine, but the attention makes you feel good. \nSurvivor - \nYou will survive no matter what the cost, no matter the \ndanger or risk to life and limb. Your first priority is yourself, and you’re not above \nsacrificing things or people if it means your survival. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTraditionalist - \nIf it was good enough for your ancestors thousands of \nyears ago, then it’s good enough for you, too. There is safety in the old ways and \nrisk in too much change. \nVisionary - \nBeyond the daily grind of life there is an unimaginable \ndestiny that you believe to exist. Perhaps you foresee peace among the \nhumanity, or another far-off fortune that spurs you to discover it. \nTHE EM-AKH OF THE AMENT1 \nBelow are brief descriptions of the six types of Amenti that you may choose \nfrom. A more full desdription of these may be found in Chapter Two. \nKher-minu (Tomb Watchers) - \nThe name given to mummies with \nstrong kaspirits - the portion of the soul that remains in the vicinity of the tomb \nto guard the body. \nPrimary Hekau: Amulets \nPurpose: One extraTrait per Balance Trait to use each turn the character \nis attacked, to be used only for defensive actions. \nLiability: The character must win a Static Willpower Test to engage in \nactions that threaten his physical form - \nfive Traits for mild risks like drinking \nalcohol, seven Traits for moderate risks like dangerous driving, nine Traits for \ncombat against a superior enemy. \nKhri-habi (Scroll-bearers) - \nThe title for mummies who have strong \nba spirits, the portion of the soul that journeys deep into the Underworld. \nPrimary Hekau: Alchemy \nPurpose: The character can heal herself and others. Make a Static \nBalance Challenge against six Traits. If successful, the character can heal one \nlevel of lethaldamage or two levelsof bashing damage. Eachday -fromsunrise \nto sunrise - \nthe character can heal up to her Balance rating in lethal levels, \nor twice her rating in bashing levels. \nLiability: The character suffers a two-Trait penalty to all Perception -and \nWits-related Mental Challenges. \nMesektet (Night Suns) -The mummies with strong sahu spirits, the \nspiritual body, an everlasting and eternal soul. \nPrimary Hekau: Celestial \nPurpose: The character may retest one challenge per Balance Trait each \nday (sunrise to sunrise). The retest result applies whether it was better or worse \nthan the original outcome. \nLiability: The character suffers a two-Trait penalty to all challenges \nduring the night. \nSakhmu (Spirit Scepters) -These mummies have strong khu spirits, \na psychic covering that surrounds the mummy’s body and spirit. \nPrimary Hekau: Effigy \nPurpose: The character may substitute her Balance rating for her Ability \nlevel in any artistic challenge, including Expression, Performance, Crafts and \nevencomputer, as long as it is aesthetically pleasing, insightful and illuminating \nwork. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsuffers a two-Trait penalty on efforts to go unnoticed, disguise himself, be \nstealthy or otherwise not be seen. \nSefekhi (Unbandaged Ones) -The term for mummies with powerful \nkhaibits, the shadow portion of the soul responsible for drive, desire and \naggression, closely related to the ka. \nPrimary Hekau: Necromancy \nPurpose: The character can retest one Stamina-related challenge per \nLiability: The character suffers a two-Trait penalty to all Social Challenges \nUdja-sen (Judged Ones) -The term for mummies who lost a portion \nPrimary Hekau: Any \nPurpose: Whenever the character replenishes Sekhem, add one additional \nSekhem per Balance Trait. Once per day, he may also transfer Sekhem Traits \nto another mummy, up to his Balance rating. \nLiability: The character suffers one level of bashing damage per Sekhem \nTrait spent, for whatever reason. This damage can be healed over time or with \nthe aid of Hekau powers. \nBalance Trait each day. \nexcept those involving Intimidation. \nof their soul in judgment by the Judges of Ma’at. \nINHERITANCE \nThis step has no direct game effect, but is still vitally important during \ncharacter creation. Take a moment to think about who your Amenti was in her \nFirst Life. Was she a priestess, invested with divine wisdom? Was he an \narchitect, helping to build the gleaming cities of the pharaohs? Perhaps she was \na temple dancer, whose movements inspired those around her, or he may have \nbeen a humble scribe who listened and learned more than what he wrote down. \nYour Amenti can be from any walk of life -the Spell of Life only asks for those \nwho can commit to the cause of Ma’at. The Inheritance can be helpful when \nyou start thinking about your Amenti’s Third Life. Many Amenti receive new \nknowledge from the Joining, and the Inheritance can be a good indicator of \nwhat he or she knew in times past. \nAmBUTES (BIDDING TRAITS) \nThe Traits that describe your character’s innate capabilities are called \nAttributes, which are used in the game to perform actions and overcome \nobstacles. While certain situations may also require Abilities, such matters are \na function of training. Even with appropriate training, you must call on your \nown strengths to finish the tasks before you. \nWhen you enter a situation with a questionable outcome, you bid a Trait \nappropriate to the challenge. If you are trying to knock someone over, for \ninstance, you might bid the Physical Trait Brawny as you use your strength. The \nnature of the challenge determines the Trait used - \nPhysical, Social or \nMental. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nRemember, when you bid a Trait for a challenge, you risk that partidar \nTrait. If you fail the challenge, you may temporarily lose the use of the Trait, \nas you exhaust your resources and lose your confidence. Some situations may \nrequire the use of an additional Trait or more - \nanytime you are considered \n“bids down,” or have a circumstance that causes you to suffer a Trait penalty, \nyou must risk additional Traits. Conversely, if you are listed as “Traits up” or \n“Traits down,” you modify your current number of Traits when comparing for \noverbids or ties. \nFor the purposes of determining what Traits are appropriate to specific \nchallenges, the Trait listings include a run-down of what sorts of Traits fit into \nwhat specialized categories. Of course, you can ignore these categories if you \nwish, in favor of speeding the game. Remember, unique situations may allow \nTraits to be used in unusual ways. \nNew players may find it easier to bid a generic Trait from the appropriate \npool instead of picking a specific one. Doing so allows them time to get the hang \nof the system. When they’re more comfortable with bidding, then start having \nthem choose Traits. \nPHYSICAL TRAITS \nStrength-related: Brawny, Ferocious, Stalwart, Tough, Wiry \nDexterity-related: Dexterous, Graceful, Lithe, Nimbk, Quick \nStamina-related: Enduring, Resilient, Robust, Rugged, Tireless \nMiscellaneous Physical: &k, Brutal, Energetic, Steady, Tenacious, Vigorous \nAgile: You are quite flexible and capable of deft movements such as \nUses: Acrobatics.

Foolish and \nslow to act when threatened. \nABILITIES \nAbilities represent particular bits of knowledge gained over the years of \nstudy and experience, the tricks of the trade, and the wisdom from many, many \nmistakes. A character's Ability Traits represent special training or talent, and \nas such, they often allow performance of tasks that are otherwise impossible. \nEven with more mundane situations, Abilities allow for a muchdimproved \nchance of success. \nWhen a character performs a risky or uncertain action, Abilities aid the \noutcome. If you attempt a task and fail, you can temporarily expend one of your \nappropriate Ability Traits to gain an immediate retest. You temporarily lose the \nrisked Ability and the initial Trait(s) bid for the task (if any) because you lost \nthe initial test, but you can still overcome the challenge. Abilities used like this \nare recovered at the next game session. \nA character with multiple levels in a given Ability is certainly more \nexperienced and proficient than an individual with just one Trait. Most \ncharacters fall into one of three levels of Ability; greater amounts are very rare, \nlimited to Imkhu and other ancients. The total level of Ability in a given field \ncorresponds roughly to the character's professional capabilities: \nCompetent (Able to earn a living) \nProfessional (Licensed, capable of supervision) \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nJourneyman (Bachelor’s degree or instructor) \nExpert (Master’s degree or researcher) \nMaster (Doctorate or true innovator) \nSome tasks are simply too difficult, or they require too much skill, to be \nattempted by a character without the requisite Abilities. The Storyteller may \nrequire the possession or use of an Ability Trait to perform a specific task. In \nthis case, characters without the Ability, or who have already used all of their \nlevels of the Ability, cannot attempt the task at all. \nWhen an Ability is used against a set scenario or object (such as using \nInvestigation to uncover information), the feat usually has a difficulty assigned \nby the Storyteller. In such a Static Challenge, you may be required to risk a \ncertain number of Traits for a trivial task, or be asked to bid more Traits for a \ndifficult, risky or tedious task. \nSome Abilities can be used against an opponent instead of facilitating a \nregular undertaking. In this case, the Ability is expended to gain a retest in a \nchallenge with the opponent. \nFOCUSING ABILITIES \nA few Abilities specifically require a concentrated area of study. One \ncannot simply study all Crafts at once, after all. These Abilities are specifically \nnoted in the descriptions. When you take such an Ability, you must choose an \narea of study, a specific topic that you have concentrated on. Each area is \nconsidered a separate Ability, so Linguistics: Egyptian is completely separate \nfrom Linguistics: Hebrew, for instance. \nABILITY SPECIALIZATIONS \nWithin a given area of expertise, some practitioners further hone their \nknowledge to arazor’s edge. By choosing aspecialization in an Ability, you fine- \ntune your skills with a particular facet of that talent. \nAbility specializations are anoptional rule. Remember to ask your Storyteller \nbefore taking aspecialization. Sometimes they can add even more color to your \ncharacter; however, keeping track of special Abilities can be tedious for \nStorytellers and record-keepers. \nTaking a specialization requires that you spend one Free or Experience \nTrait on an ability that you already possess. Whenever you perform a task with \nthat specialization - \neven if you do not expend the Ability - \nyou gain a one- \nTrait bonus on resolving challenges, as long as you have at least one level of the \nmain Ability left to spend. You may have only one specialization in any given \nAbility; you cannot take Brawl: White Tiger Kung Fu and Brawl: Krav Maga and \nexpect an amazing amalgamate feat. Also, you can never gain more than one \nBonus Trait from specializations, even if more than one would be appropriate \nto a given challenge. Even if you possess Law: Criminal and Investigation: \nResearch, you only get the one-Trait bonus on a test for trial preparation, \ndespite your multiple specializations. \nA specialization is a concentrated area of expertise or practice. You cannot \ntake a Melee specialization in “swords,” for example, nor a Medicine specialization \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nof “healing.” Appropriate specializations refer to one focus of expertise, or to \none type of excellent knowledge within the Ability, such as Academics: \nAntiquities or Lore: Werewolves. \nYou may take a specialization within an area of study, though. As such, you \nconcentrate your research in one particular facet of that sub-specialized \nAbility. Thus you could have Computer: Hacking with a specialization in \nviruses, or Crafts: Blacksmithing with a specialization in Farrier. \nNote that the Bonus Traits from a specialization are not bid or used like \nother Traits. You simply are “one Trait up” on challenges within that \nspecialization. \nExample: Mary-Catherine is a proficient sword fighter, but she excels with the \nrapier. She has the Ability: Melee x 4 with the specialization Rapier. When Mary- \nCatherine encounters a foe in combat, she normally uses her seven Physical Traits. \nWitharapier, howewer, she has eight PhysicalTraits because ofher extensive training. \nShouldshe tire or be wounded (losingseweralchallenges anddraining Traits), she may \nnot be as effective in combat. But as long as she retains at least one level ofher Melee \nAbility, she gets to add the one-Trait bonus to her remaining Physical Trait total. \nAcademics \nYou possess higher learning beyond a high-school education. With \nAcademics, you can debate the existence of gravity, indulge in studies of culture \nand give Jeopardy contestants a run for their money. This broad Ability covers \nall sorts of arts and humanities. \nAcademics allow you to recognize and name historical, artistic and cultural \nreferences. You can use Academics when working in such fields, as developing \na thesis or researching. Calling on Academics Ability may require a Mental or \nSocial Challenge to determine your exact level of competence. \nYou may further direct your studies by choosing a specific field, such as Art \nHistory, Classics, Journalism, Theology or anything else that could be studied \nwith higher education. \nAnimal Ken \nYou understand the nature of the beast and thus the temperament of \nanimals. You admire and respect their untamed ways, which allow you to \nempathize and communicate with them. It’s not so much like Dr. Dolittle, \nrather, you know how to deal with them more equitably. Though they may \nsense that you are not quite human, you know what drives animals and how to \nassuage their fears. With AnimalKen, you can train an animal specific behaviors \nor attempt to deduce an animal’s state of being with a Mental Challenge. If you \nwork with an animal for at least a month, you may be able to teach it a simple \ntrick, up to a limit of one trick for each Mental Trait the animal possesses. \nAthletics \nYou might have been an all-around jock in high school, or perhaps you are \njust naturally talented, but you are skilled in all manners of athletic endeavors. \nYou can throw a ball, catch, sprint, climb, jump, swim and run with the best of \nthem. Your Athletics Ability is used for retests on most forms of raw physical \nactivity: acrobatics, running, climbing, jumping, swimming, throwing, dancing \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nand other activities. You may also choose to focus on something you do \n- .  \nespecially well. \nAwareness \nYou have a talent for knowing when things are amiss, whether by that \nstrange feeling in the pit of your gut or through scrupulous observation. This \ntalent is particularly useful for sensing when other supernatural creatures are \naround, or just knowing when to get the hell out of Dodge. Awareness requires \na Mental Challenge to use, and retests are made with the Occult Ability. \nBrawl \nMaybe you roughed up the kids at the schoolyard, hard-styled the martial- \narts students, or kicked ass in bar fights. You might have some military training, \nor maybe you just grew up with a rough-and-tumble sibling who taught you how \nto defend yourself. Whatever the case, you know how to dish out damage with \nyour fists and legs. Use the Brawl Ability for retests in combat when you are \nusing your natural weapons (teeth, claws or fists). This Ability is also the \nprovince of the martial arts, although you should specify which art when taking \nthis Ability. \nComputer \nMany Reborn are not well-versed in the ways of new technology and, as \na result, tend to shy away from all things silicon and artificial. Some are the \nexception to the rule, embracing mortal society’s ever-advancing technologies. \nWith the Computer Ability, you are versed in the methods of basic computer \noperation, programming and accessing other computers. You can hack into \nsystems, write complex programs and viruses, and decode unfamiliar languages \nby using Computer with a successful Mental Challenge (difficulty determined \nby the Storyteller). \nCosmology \nThe truth is out there, further away than the stars we see in the night sky. \nCosmology reflects your awareness of what lies beyond the physical world, how \nto get there and how to get back. This Ability is very helpful for Amenti who \nplan on spending extended amounts of time in Duat or Neter-khertet. Each \nTrait allows a retest when attempting to enter or return from the Lands of the \nDead. \nCrafts \nYou build and construct things. Depending on your specific area of \nexpertise, you might know how to build a house or sculpt figures out of ice. As \nsuch, you must conform to an area of expertise and focus, such as Weaving, \nCarpentq or Sculpting. Perhaps a more media-focused art, like Painting or \nDrawing, suits your talent. Crafts also covers more labor-intensive technical \nskills, such as Mechanics and Electronics. Making or repairing an item with \nCrafts is decided by a challenge, with the difficulty set by the Storyteller, based \non the type of job (drawing up architectural schematics is decisively more \ndifficult than sanding a 2x4). \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCrafts also include body art, like tattooing, piercing or other body \nalterations. \nDivination \nSigns, omens and portents to the future are all gateways that you can \nvisualize. This Ability is separate from Hekau and the abilities of the Mesektet, \nalthough members of that Amenti often possess these Traits. Once per game \nsession, and with access to the proper equipment (entrails of a beast, telescope \nto read the stars, Tarot cards, etc.), your Amenti can attempt to give a general \nreading or ask a specific question. (“What does the future hold instore for me?”) \nAll results are at Storyteller discretion. Answers to these questions can be as \nvague or as specific as necessary, and might be a good place for the Storyteller \nto interject fun plot twists. (“Yes, your future holds at least one more perilous \nencounter. One such attack will occur when your back is turned.”) \nDodge \nYou possess enough fighting savvy to avoid physical harm by manipulating \nyour body away from directed attacks and, to a lesser degree, gunfire. You can \nonly use Dodge against any attack that you’re consciously aware of - maybe a \nfight in which you are a participant, or aduck-and-cover in a drive-by shooting \nthat you happen to see unfold. Dodge is used to retest challenges where you \nattempt to avoid physical harm. \nDrive \nYou’re at home with either a stick-shift or an automatic, rush hour is no \nconcern, and you can get the most performance out of a car. In dangerous \nsituations, you can evade traffic and even use your vehicle as a weapon. Bear \nin mind that just because you can drive a station wagon doesn’t mean you can \ndrive a semi truck with equal ease. A Mental Challenge may be required for you \nto figure out where everything is in an unfamiliar vehicle. \nDrive tests most often involve a Physical Challenge with your reflexes. \nEmpathy \nYou are sensitive to the moods and emotions of people around you. When \nyou listen to someone, you understand her feelings. You can identify with \nothers and tell when people are lying or holding back while talking to you. \nWith a Social Challenge and the expenditure of an Empathy Ability, you can \ndetermine if the last thing someone said was a lie (although Subterfuge can \ndefend against this expenditure). Alternately, you can attempt to determine \nthe subject’s current Demeanor. \nEnigmas \nYou have made a special study of the puzzles, riddles and mysteries of the \nancient world. Perhaps you are familiar with these ancient mind-benders from \nyour First Life and you see the patterns, clues and hidden meanings behind even \nthe most abstruse information. \nEtiquette \nYou know when to bow or kneel in the presence of an elder, and how to \naddress them in a polite inoffensive manner. You can hold a toast with the best \nof them, and you keep your cool in any social scenario, from high tea to a gang’s \nrally. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nat parties. If ;ou make a social faux pas, you may expend an Etiquette Ability \nimmediately to negate the gaffe- your character knew better than to make the \nmistake. \nExpression \nWords and feelings flow freely from you. When the muse strikes, you put \npen to paper (or fingers to instrument) and pour out a torrent of emotion and \nstirring imagery. You can convey messages and meaning in your art, from \nsymphonies to poetry, and whatever you write is both clear and moving. When \nwriting or composing, you can sink true emotion into the work. Works created \nwith Expression x 3 or greater have the potential to entrance Toreador \nvampires, as per their clan weakness. \nFinance \nThe world of money and business awaits your whim. You understand \ninterest, CDs, stock-market transactions, currency exchanges and GNPs. A \nlittle Finance lets you make quite a bit of money. You can also use your Finance \nto run a business of your or own balance books. You can manage a business, \nfollow a money trail, perform an audit or clean up an accounting mess with a \nMental Challenge (difficulty dependent on the task, as determined by the \nStoryteller). Alternately, you can spend a level of Finance Ability to raise $250 \nin cash between games. Not every use of Finance is so benign-money- \nlaundering has to come from somewhere. \nF' irearms \nA little time at the gun range goes a long way. You know how to hold, fire \nand clean a gun. You can clear a jam, too, and you can differentiate between \nvarious models. You know how to stand to get the best aim, how to handle recoil \nand how to take care of problems in the field. \nIf you possess the Firearms Ability, you may use your Mental Traits for gun \ncombat instead of using Physical Traits at no cost. You can expend Firearms for \na retest in ranged-fire combat. \nHobby/Professional/Expert Ability \nIn a certain area of expertise not covered by another Ability, you have \nachieved some level of skill. You may have a small grasp of a trade due to some \nwork on the side, or perhaps you've specifically studied a topic. Hobby/ \nProfessionallExpert Ability is a catchall category for highly unusual Abilities like \nDemolitions, Lores of various types, and so on. The Storyteller must specifically \napprove any Ability of this type, and its capabilities are defined by the \nStoryteller as well. \nIntimidation \nIntimidation represents a broad variety of techniques used for terrifying \npeople into compliance. They could be anything from physical size, to a \nfrightening, toothy grin, to knowing which emotional buttons to push. You can \nuse Intimidation when trying to scare someone with a Social Challenge. \nInvestigation \nYou know how to pick up clues and to put together disparate pieces of \ninformation. By habit and training and with a scrutinizing eye, you can set a \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\njumbled mass of data into order, discovering identities, motives and patterns in \nan otherwise chaotic scene. You can use lnwestigation with a Mental Challenge \nwhen trying to puzzle out meaning to a random scene. \nLaw \nNobody is above the law, except those who know how to use it to their \nadvantage. You're one of the latter. Perhaps you uphold the law, or maybe you \ntwist it to your own ends. Your knowledge of Law allows you to understand legal \nprocesses, courts and lawyers, and to use it effectively. Use the Law Ability in \ncourt situations or with Social Challenges involving legal matters. Because the \nlegal body is so vast, your Storyteller may require you to select a particular area \nof study (International, Property, etc.). \nLeadership \nWhen you speak, people listen. A good speaking voice and self-confidence \nlend a powerful presence to a leader. The Leadership Ability represents your \nability to motivate people and to get them to follow your guidance. Even among \nthose who do not know or respect you, you can demand attention. \nYou can use Leadership with a Social Challenge to try and get a minor favor \nor task from a character. \nLinguistics \nYou've studied a language (or languages) other than your native tongue. \nAs an Amenti, you have probably been exposed to quite a few languages in your \ndifferent lives, and you certainly know the ancient language of your First Life. \nOne way or another you can speak, write and read other languages. \nYou must choose a language for each level of Linguistics you possess. Thus, \nyou could have Linguistics: French and Linguis tics: Egyptian. Alternately, you can \nfocus on the underlying study of Linguistics itself, granting some understanding \nof the principles behind the structure of language. Languages need not be \nspoken. American SignLanguage or Egyptian Hieroglyphics are also considered \nfields for study. Those who wish to converse in another language (but cannot \nactually do so) should hold up one hand with the first finger and thumb, making \nan L-shape to indicate to other players that the characters are not speaking \nEnglish. Those who wish to listen to the conversation must also possess the \nlanguage. \nMedicine \nYou know how the human body functions. You can speed the recovery and \nhealing of an injured mortal, or you can use your knowledge to inflict injury. \nMany learn just enough to assist injured allies and friends. \nYou can use the Medicine Ability to speed a mortal's healing by one \ncategory. A Woundedmortal would heal as if Bruised, for instance. Medicine may \nbe used for other sorts of research and lab work with a Mental Challenge. As \nMedicine represents such avast field, your Storyteller may require you to specify \nwhat you know (Pharmaceuticals, lnternal Medicine, General Practice). \nMeditation \nThis Ability allows you to clear and focus your mind, to find inner balance \nand serenity. Meditating requires time and a focus that blocks out other \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n... \n. . . _. \n. \n. I \ndistractions. Reborn often use chanting or talismans of some sort (sometimes \nincense). For every uninterrupted hour of meditation, you may convert one \nTrait of Meditation to a temporary Memory Trait (see Background: Memory). \nYou may, instead, choose to go one full day without food per hour of \nmeditation, for a maximum of three full days. Further meditation, while \ncentering yourself and staving off hunger pains, does not stop your body from \nsuffering the effects of starvation. You will sustain one health level of lethal \ndamage for each day of not eating after your three-day allotment. \nMelee \nIf you’ve got something in your hand, you’re a deadly fighter. Be it a sword, \na stick or apair or silver spoons, you can use it to damaging effect. Expend Melee \nfor retests in hand-to-hand combat when you are using a close-combat weapon, \nlike a knife or kitchen sink. Certain weapons function best when wielded by a \ncharacter with Melee. \nOccult \nThe hidden world teems with mysterious secrets. By unlocking universal \nkeys and studying the basics of spirituality, you can learn the shadowy paths of \nthe cosmos. Your Occult Ability serves as ageneralknowledge of the supernatural, \nalerting you to the existence of many inhuman creatures and paranormal \nevents. \nSome powers rely on the Occult Ability. Occult grants some basic (and \nsometimes erroneous) knowledge of the various denizens of the supernatural \nworld. For more detailed information, study Expert Ability: Lore in a particular \nsubject of interest. \nPerformance \nYou are a true virtuoso. Whatever your chosen medium, you have a gift for \nartistic endeavors. Whether playing an instrument, singing, dancing or acting, \nyour skills entertain. \nYour Perfomance Ability can be used to earn a modest income, like other \nartistic trade skills. You must also choose a specific art form when you take \nPerformance, such as playing an instrument, singing, acting or dramatic \nreadings. Note that Performance is generally anything done before an audience, \nwhile Expression most often focuses on literary works, and Crafts concentrates \non the creation of physical objects (such as paintings or sculptures). \nPoisons \nYou know how poisons work-from \ntheir effects to their sources and \nantidotes. You can analyze a substance and conclude if it is poisonous. If it is, \nthen you can determine what sort of toxin it contains and formulate an \nantidote. This Ability allows you to brew your own poisons and mix antidotes \nwith access to the proper material, which generally requires more than just a \nrattlesnake, a pair of pliers and a mason jar. \nPolitics \nThe world of favors and influence trading is extensive among mortals, and \nthrough knowledge of the political scene, a careful Reborn can come out on \ntop. By using observation, intrigue and a bit of spin-doctoring, you’ve learned \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nhow to handle appearances, what a speech really means, and where the deal- \nmaking is going on. In short, it’s Politics as usual. \nThe Politics Ability is primarily useful in dealing with mortal society or \nInfluences. You may be able to manipulate the outcome of local political \nactions, with the proper Influence and some well-placed Social Challenges. \nPolitics is also used to discern hidden motives and broker deals. \nKnowledge of Politics includes, by extension, an understanding of the \nbureaucratic levels of power. You know how to cut through red tape, or how to \nobstruct others with it. By determining who’s important in a given strata, you \ncan avoid wasting time and simply go straight to the person with the power to \ndo what you want. \nRepair \nYou possess a working understanding of what makes things tick. With \ntimes, tools and parts, you can fix or slightly alter most of the trappings of \nmodem society. This knowledge also allows you to excel at sabotage. The \nRepair Ability is widespread among inventors, mechanics and handymen. \nUsing this Ability usually calls for a Mental Challenge, the difficulty of which \ndepends on factors like the item’s complexity, the tools and parts available, the \nextent of damage and the time spent on repairs. \nRiding \nYou are proficient at riding beasts of burden, including horses and camels. \nIn Western society, a person can live his whole life and never sit on an animal, \nbut riding is common in many parts of the world, particularly in the deserts of \nthe Lands of Faith, where agood camel is often more reliable than afour-wheel- \ndrive vehicle. EachTrait allows a retest where a dangerous, complex maneuver, \nor condition, arises while riding. This Ability has to be bid instead ofAthktics, \nsince (while it takes a certain amount of athleticism to remain steady on a \nmount) riding is a dual effort. You may be able to stay on your mount, but your \nmount won’t obey you and buck you off, or fall down itself. \nScience \nThe modem Information Age is all about the explosion of all manner of \nstudies. By categorizing and breaking down the world into many different \nforms, the methods of logic and reason give sentient beings an understanding \nof the universe, or at least small pieces of it. Education in Science covers \ntechniques of inquiry, modem studies and a broad range of underpinning work \nin a diverse range of fields. \nScience Ability requires an area of particular study: Biology, Chemistry, \nPhysics, Metallurgy, Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, Geology and Botany are \nall possibilities. Though such a list is far from comprehensive. Combining a \nScience with different fields may give varied results. For example, Science: \nMetallurgy with Acackmics may give results regarding historical research and \ntheory, while the same Science with Occult could center on ancient alchemy or \nparapsychology. Actually constructing objects or devices theorized with Science \nmay require the Crafts Ability. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nUsing a particular branch of Science usually requi \nof some sort to determine the success of research, or the viability of theoretical \nwork. \nSecurity \nWhichever side of the law you’ve worked on, it has granted you experience \nin Security techniques. You know about police operations and guard work, how \nthey make their schedules and how they undertake their business - \nand how \nto disrupt such operations. Locks, traps, security systems and alarms are all \nwithin your purview. With a little time, you can put together Security measures \nfor a location; you can also defeat such measures. \nUse the Secun’ty Ability with Mental Traits to set up a secure area or \nnetwork, or to formulate a plan for breaching such a network. Security Ability \nis also used to disarm traps, alarms and other devices, and to defeat locks. At \nthe discretion of a Narrator, you may be required to use a Physical Trait related \nto dexterity when attempting to bypass a physical lock or alarm. \nScrounge \nYou’re exceptionally good at finding stuff. Whether it’s a crucial part for \nan 1890s gramophone, invitations to an exclusive gallery opening in town, or \njust two bucks for a chili dog with fries from the gutters of downtown, you’re a \nwhiz at knowing where to go, who to talk to and how to get what you need. \nGranted, the things you get are rarely brand new and do take time and favors \nto acquire, but such an Ability is useful when your finances are less than \nplentiful or when theft is out of the question. \nScrounge is typically used in conjunction with an Amenti’s Mental Traits \n(although the Storyteller may occasionally require a Social Challenge for \nhaggling), and can be useful when looking for particular items or searching a \nplace that is in shambles. \nStealth \nBy blending into cover, blurring your lines and moving carefully and \nquietly, you can evade or sneak past people. You know how to best take \nadvantage of surrounding cover and how to use light and shadow. Opportunities \nfor unnoticed movement are not lost on you, as you understand the uses of \ntiming and diversion. \nWith an appropriate Physical Challenge, you can sometimes sneak past \nguards and searchers (who contest your Ability with their Mental Traits and \nInvestigation Ability). You also use Stealth to augment Powers designed to \nconceal. \nStreetwise \nWord on the street is known to you. Even if you don’t have any particular \nfriends or contacts in the area, you know about the different communities and \ngangs that hang out in town. You recognize tagging and other territorial \nmarkings, and you know some of the signs, colors and clothes that denote street \npeople, homeless, gangbangers, hoodlums, criminals and social workers. \nUsing the Streetwise Ability, with your Mental Traits, lets you recognize \nthe influence of various gangs or street communities. You also know about \ncriminal organizations and activities, and you could perform a little larceny \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nhostile gang (though you may need Etiquette to make a really good impression). \nSubterfuge \nThere are many ways to talk about subjects, and just as many ways to \nuncover the truth of the matter. Even in idle conversation, people use little \nwhite lies, or slip in hints about their true motives, or try to guide the course \nof discussion and give away their secrets indirectly. The art of Subterfuge is the \nart of reading these tricks and using them effortlessly. \nWhen someone confronts you with one of your lies, you can use the \nSubterfuge Ability in your own defense (if someone uses the Empathy Ability, \nfor instance). By guiding a conversation, you can also unearth someone’s \nNegative Traits; if you manage to steer conversation to a particular topic in \nplay, you can expend a Subterfuge Ability and make a Social Challenge to \ndetermine one of the subject’s Negative Traits related to the topic. \nSurvival \nSurvival represents a knowledge of terrain, how to find shelter, where to \nfind water, techniques in hunting, edible and poisonous plants, and so on. It \nalso provides some assurances of a safer existence for those who travel outside \nthe cities. Hunting and avoiding danger in the wilderness usually relies on a \nPhysical Challenge. With Survival, you can substitute your Mental Traits if you \nso desire. Your Storyteller may require you to take a specialization in a type of \nterrain (Arctic, Desert, Forest, etc.) \nThanatology \nMost mortals fear death. Ancient Egyptians honored it by studying it. You \nare considered a student of death and dying if your Amenti possesses Traits in \nthis Ability. You understand not just the mortification and preservation of a \ncorpse, but also the spiritual dimensions of death - \nfunerary rites, respectful \ntreatment of a corpse, embalming, etc. You may have been an embalmer or \ndoctor in your First or Second Life, or perhaps you are just fascinated by life’s \nend in your Third Life. This knowledge also gives you some understanding of \nghosts and zombies, at least as related to their physical deaths and present \nstates. \nTraps \nYou have more than a casual understanding of how to build, design and \ndisarm various mechanical traps, such as those built in ancient Egyptian tombs, \nor as seen in various movies, to deter thieves and curious professors from \nplundering them. Quite often a mummy uses this skill in her resting place so \nher body and belongings are not disturbed while her soul travels in Duat. \nTraps take time and effort to set up. Combined with Enigmas, you may \ncreate complex traps that not even the shrewdest of minds would think to \ninvestigate. \nBACKGROUNDS \nYour character’s Backgrounds help to flesh out ties with mortal agencies, \ntheir roles in society and available beneficial resources. Each Background is \nused differently. Generally, having multiple Traits in a given Background \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nallows for better or more common use of that benefit. Some Backgrounds \ndirectly affect your character’s creation anddevelopment; others are called into \nplay later during the game. \nALLIES \nA few friends, most likely from your Third Life or perhaps devotees to your \ncause as Amenti, help you out in your endeavors. You can make a few calls and \ncut a few deals to get assistance in a wide range of activities. Your Storyteller \nwill probably require you to define your allies’ relations to you, and how you \nkeep them. \nEach Allies Trait possessed represents one person that you can call on for \naid. Unlike Influences, your Allies have special talents that make them better \nthan the average person on the street. Though your Allies may not be aware of \nyour exact nature, they can be quite useful if directed properly. \nGenerally, your Allies do not show up in play directly. Instead, you can use \nthem for certain services between play sessions by notifying your Storyteller. \nAn Ally can be directed to follow up on research or activities that you \nhave started. If you undertook a specific task, like tailing a certain person, \nresearching a project or building something, your Allies can continue the work, \ndoing so with one Ability Trait’s worth of expertise. As long as they work on \nthe project, your Allies Trait for the individual is tied up. \nIf you need aparticularly competent ally, you can expend multiple Traits \nto gain access to a mortal with multiple levels of an Ability or Influence. Each \nAllies Trait that you spend after the first gives an extra level of expertise to your \nAllies. They may use this expertise on your behalf, though rarely with your own \nskill, and they only help as long as you tie up your Allies Background Traits in \nthis manner. \nBe wary of calling on your Allies too often. An Ally may call on you for \nmutual aid, or refuse to help if pressed into dangerous or illegal activities. \nA R C A N E  \nYou are less noticeable than most people, and mortals tend to forget that \nyou’re even around. You participate in a fruitful conversation with a group of \nstrangers, and five minutes after walking away, the rest of those strangers don’t \neven recall your most memorable qualities. \nAnytime you complete a scene, you may spend one of your Arcane Traits \nto cause everyone involved to forget and lose every record of your name or face. \n(You must spend two Arcane to make them forget both.) You cannot use this \nBackground to wipe all record of your existence from the planet - \njust your \nparticipation in any one scene. Therefore, security cameras have a technical \nproblem, witnesses have trouble recalling your name or describing you to \npolice, the lens cap was on, the photograph didn’t develop properly, the \ncomputer crashed.. . however it happens, you are forgotten. \nArcane does not cover your actions, however. Even if someone can’t \nremember who you are or what you look like, a victim remembers the Hekau \nyou used, your crazed behavior or the dangerous information that you passed \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nalong. This effect also works only at your behest -your friends won't suddenly \nforget your name. These Arcane Traits refresh each game session. \nNote: Sakhmu mummies may not take this Background, due to their \nparticular Liability. \nBA \nEach mummy possesses a Ba, or a portion of the spirit that determines the \nlongevity of a mummy. The Ba also represents how adept the spirit is at \nregaining new life after traveling down to h a t .  For every Trait of Ba, a \nmummy's normal 60-year lifespan extends for 10 years. These Traits also \nrepresent the number of retests you can call once your mummy has died. If you \ndo not succeed in a resurrection challenge, then you must wait until the next \ngame session to initiate this challenge. \nNote: As an optional rule for Ba, for games that have a more vested interest \nin the Underworld: It takes five full sessions in h a t  to gain the energy \nnecessary to make a resurrection challenge. Each level of the Ba Background \nreduces this number by one. At five Ba, you can attempt the challenge one hour \nafter death. \nCOMPANION \nWhen a human was mummified, she was frequently accompanied by a \nhorde of animals to tend to her in the afterlife. There are recorded discoveries \nof tombs that contained thousands of beasts that had been preserved carefully \nfor eternity. After your First Life, your tem-akh spirit was buried with an \nespecially loyal beast. The more Traits your Amenti possesses in a Companion, \nthe greater the beast can be. The Companion is immaterial, but it can \ncommunicate with you. It may gift you with minor blessings, as these creatures \nare sacred to the gods, and the gods look favorably on those who walkwith their \nfavored creatures. Your Companion also accompanies you in the Underworld. \nCommoncreatures to be mummified include cats, falcons, dogs, crocodiles, \nlions and the ibis, and anything with religious significance to the Egyptians is \npossible. Work with the Storyteller to hash out your Companion specifics. \nCONTACTS \nWith the right contacts in all walks of life, you can get all sorts of useful \ninformation. Keeping your ear to the ground does not always pan out with the \nmost insightful information, but it keeps you abreast of the basic 41 1. \nIn game terms, your rating in Contacts allows you to discern rumors and \ninformation. When you call on your Contacts, you make a few phone calls, \ncheck with likely snitches and grease a few palms. In return, you get rumors and \ninformation as if possessing of a certain amount of Influence. Doing so lets you \nfind out exactly what's going on in the city within a particular area. You can \nget information of a level equal to however many contacts you use. If you use \nContacts x 3 on Industry, for instance, you get information as if digging up dirt \nwith Industry x 3 Influence. The advantage of the Contacts Background is that \ncontacts can be switched from place to place each game, getting information \nin different areas at your demand. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nUsing Contacts for especially dangerous or secret information may require \nyou to spend some money or perform a few favors, at the discretion of the \nStoryteller. Occasionally, accidents can cause contacts in one area to dry up, \nsuch as a strike that affects your Industry contacts, or an unlucky astronomical \nconjunction sends your Occult contacts running for the hills. Your contacts do \nnot function as aides or lackeys; that duty is the purview of the Allies and \nRetainers Backgrounds. \nINFLUENCE \nSociety builds on institutions. As cities are raised, they form gatherings of \nexpertise that are manipulated by people in their midst. If you have Influence, \nyou can sway the direction of some areas of mundane society, pushing cities to \ngrow as you direct. Your Influence can be used to strike indirectly at your foes \nwhile protecting your own assets, or to gain information and special resources. \nInfluencecomes in many different areas. You must allocate Traits separately \nto each Influence; thus, if you have Underworld x 4, you could still have Media \nx 3 independently, but you would have to spend the Traits for each. \nYou cannot manage more influence than the sum of your permanent \nPhysical, Social and Mental Traits combined. This limit counts against all of \nyour total Influence -your combined levels cannot exceed this total. After all, \nthere are only so many things you can do in a night. \nWhen you exercise Influence, you expend temporary Influence Traits. \nThe tables for various Influence areas detail what you can do with a specific \nnumber of Traits. Performing an action requires a number of Traits equal to the \nlevel of the action. For instance, you must use three Traits to perform an action \nlisted at the third level of the Influence chart,. Thus, with high levels of \nInfluence, you can perform many small actions, or a few significant ones. \nCertain levels of Influence gift you with items money or aides. Unlike the \nResources Background, money and equipment garnered with Influence does \nnot come automatically each month. If you want a steady income from \nInfluence, you must direct your Influence in that direction continually, and \nthis income does not come with any associated trappings of wealth (you have \nto buy a house and car separately, for instance). Aides garnered with Influence \ngenerally help for only one specific task, and they usually have only one level \nof Ability in their area of skill- for more competent and readily available help \n- \ntake Allies. \nMost cities have a set amount of Influence in various areas. Storytellers \nshould map out the total amount of each type of Influence to be had in the city. \nOnce all of the Influence of a given type is used up, the only way to get more \nis to use Influence to grow that area of society (making new projects or \nsponsoring investment), to destroy someone else’s Influence and thus free up \nthose resources, or to acquire an adversary’s Influence in an area. Also, each city \nmay have different reflections on the Influences listed here. A city with a \nthriving independent-film community is going to have a different picture of \nMedia or High Society than a city where the arts are being starved out due to \nbudget cuts. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nEach area of Influence has its own description. Older Reborn, especially \nthose who deal heavily in mortal society, may possess far-reaching Influence, \ngiving them the power to exert control beyond the levels included here. \nBUREAUCRACY \nYou can manage various government agencies and bureaus. By dealing \nwith social programs and public servants, you can spin red tape, bypass rules and \nregulations, or twist bureaucratic regimentation to your advantage. Bureaucracy \nis useful in operating or shutting down businesses, faking or acquiring permits \nand identification papers, and manipulating public utilities and facilities. \nGovernment clerks at the city and county level, utility workers, road crews, \nsurveyors and other civil servants are potential contacts or allies. \ncost \nEffect \n1 \nTrace utility bills \n2 \nFake a birth certificate or driver’s license \nDisconnect a single small residence’s utilities \nClose a small road or park \nGet public aid ($250) \nFake a death certificate, passport or green card \nClose a public school for a day \nShut down a minor business on a violation \nFake land deeds \nInitiate a department-wide investigation \nStart, stop or alter a city-wide program or policy \nShut down a big business on a violation \nRezone areas \nObliterate records of a person on a city or \ncounty level \n3 \n4 \nInitiate a phone tap \n5 \nCHURCH \nThough the modem church has less control over temporal society than it \ndid in the Middle Ages, its policies still exert considerable influence over the \ndirection of politics and communities. Knowing the appropriate people allows \ninsight into many mainstream religions, such as Judaism, Christianity, Islam, \nHinduism, Shinto or Buddhism (fringe or alternative groups, like Scientology, \nare considered to be under the purview of Occult). When you exercise Church \nInfluence, you can change religious policy, affect the assignment of clergy and \naccess a variety of lore and resources. Contacts and allies affected by Church \nInfluence include ministers, priests, bishops, Church-sponsored witch-hunters, \nholy orders, and various attendees and assistants. \ncost \nEffect \n1 \nIdentify most secular members of a given faith \nin the local area \nPass as a member of the clergy \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nburial, etc.) \nIdentify higher church members \nTrack regular church members \nSuspend lay members \nOpen or close a single church \nFind the average church-associated hunter \nDip into the collection plate ($250) \nAccess private information and archives of a \nchurch \nDiscredit or suspend high-level church members \nManipulate regional branches of the church \nOrganize major protests \nAccess ancient church lore and knowledge \nFINANCE \nManipulating markets, stock reports and investments is a hobby for many \npeople, especially those who use their knowledge to keep hidden wealth. \nThough your actual available money is a function of your Resources, you can use \nFinance Influence to start or smother businesses, crush or support banking \ninstitutions and alter credit records. Such power over money is not to be trifled \nwith - \nfortunes are made and destroyed with this sort of pull. CEOs, bankers, \nstockbrokers, bank-tellers, yes-men, financiers and loan agents are found \namong such places. \ncost \nEffect \n1 \nLearn about major transactions and financial \nevents \nRaise capital ($1000) \nLearn about general economic trends \n2 \n3 \n4 \n5 \nLearn real motivations for many financial actions \nof others \nTrace an unsecured small account \nRaise capital to purchase a small business (single, \nsmall store) \nPurchase a large business (a few small branches or \na single large store or service) \nManipulate local banking (delay deposits, some \ncredit-rating alterations) \nRuin a small business \nControl an aspect of city-wide banking (shut off \nATMs, arrange a bank “holiday”) \nRuin a large business \nPurchase a major company \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nHEALTH \nSome who work within cities rely on their medical connections to acquire \nmedical assistance, especially when regenerating muscle and bone within a few \nhours in front of mortal doctors can jeopardize secrecy (not to mention sanity). \nThe maintenance of one's privacy often requires alterations of medical records \nor faking of particular diseases. All sorts of medical research and development \nfall under the purview of Health Influence. Coroners, doctors, lab workers, \ntherapists, pharmacists and specialists are just a few of the folks found in this \nfield. \ncost \nEffect \n1 \nAccess to a person's health records \nFake vaccination records and the like \nUse public functions of health centers at your \nleisure \nAccess some medical research records \nHave a minor lab*work done \nGet a copy of a coroner's report \nInstigate minor quarantines \nCorrupt results of tests or inspections \nAlter medical records \nAbuse grants for personal use ($250) \nHave minor medical research performed on a \nsubject \nInstitute large-scale quarantines \nShut down businesses for \"health-code violations\" \nHave special research projects performed \nHave people institutionalized or released \n2 \n3 \n4 \nCompletely rewrite medical records \n5 \nHIGH SOCIETY \nThe glitterati at the top of society move in circles of wealth and elegance. \nThough many do not find such positions appealing, there is the rare exception \nthat indulges in the passions of the famous and wealthy. Access to famous \nactors, other celebrities and the elite-rich grants a certain sway over fashion \ntrends. Combined with Fame, amodicum of High Society Influence can turn one \ninto a debonair darling of the most exclusive social circles. Among these \ncircles, one finds dilettantes, artists of almost any stripe, old-money families, \nmodels, rock stars, sports figures and jetsetters. \ncost \nEffect \n1 \nLearn what is trendy \nObtain hard-to-get tickets for shows \nLearn about concerts, shows or plays before they \nare made public \nTrack most celebrities and luminaries \n2 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n3 \n4 \n5 \nBe a local voice in the entertainment field \n“Borrow” idle cash from rich friends ($1000) \nCrush promising careers \nHobnob well above your station \nMinor celebrity status \nGet a brief appearance on a talk show that’s not \nabout to be canceled \nRuin a new club, gallery, festival or other posh \ngathering \nINDUSTRY \nThe grinding wheels of labor fuel the economies and markets of the world. \nMachines, factories and blue-collar workers line up in endless drudgery, \nchurning out the staples of everyday living.

Of course, a bit of Legal Influence is excellent for harassing \nan enemy’s assets, too. Such Influence ranges from law schools and firms, to \nlawyers, to judges, to DAs, and to clerks and public defenders. \ncost \nEffect \n1 \n2 \n3 \nGet free representation for minor cases \nAvoid bail for some charge \nHave minor charges dropped \nManipulate legal procedures (minor wills and \ntrusts, court dates) \nAccess public or court funds ($250) \nGet representation in most court cases \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n4 \n5 \nIssue subpoenas \nTie up court cases \nHave most legal charges dropped \nCancel or arrange parole \nClose down all but the most serious investigations \nHave deportation proceedings held against \nsomeone \nMEDIA \nDirecting media attention to or away from one’s activities is a key \ncomponent to maintaining, increasing or attacking other’s mortal standing. \nPutting specific emphasis on certain events can place an enemy in an \nuncomfortable spotlight or discredit a rival. WithMedia, you can crush or alter \nnews stories, control the operations of news stations and reporters and sway \npublic opinion.

Obviously, a Reborn is aware that there are strange things out \nthere by dint of his very existence (what is stranger than an immortal \nmummy?), but hard knowledge of such things is a functionof Abilities. By using \nOccult Influence, you can dig up information to improve your knowledge, get \ninside the occult community and find rare components for magical rituals. Cult \nleaders, alternative religious groups, charlatans, occultists, New Agers and a \nfew more dangerous elements can be found here. \ncost \nEffect \n1 \nContact and make use of common occult groups \nand their practices \nKnow visible occult figures \nKnow and contact obscure occult figures \nAccess resources for most rituals and rites \n2 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n3 \nKnow the general vicinity of certain supernatural \n4 \n5 \nentities and (possibly) contact them \nAccess vital or rare material components \nMilk impressionable wannabes for bucks ($250) \nAccess occult tomes and writings \nResearch a Basic rite \nResearch an Intermediate rite \nUnearth Advanced rites \nPOLICE \n”To protect and serve” is the police motto, but these days mortals and \nimmortals alike may have cause to wonder just who is being protected and \nserved. That said, Police Influence can be very handy to protect one’s holdings \nor to raid the assets of another. After all, attitude won’t save the enemy who is \nthe target of a police and SWAT raid.

Guns, money, drugs and vice - \nsuch delicious can be led by anyone \ntalented or vicious enough to take them. A few Reborn slip into the vice trades, \nthe better to keep an eye on many longtime enemies (like the Followers of Set \nvampires).

Such protection \nvaries from shrewd misdirection to outright attacks. When a mummy dies, no \nmatter where in h a t  the soul travels, the Ku continues to watch over the khat. \nThe body does not decay, scavengers do not eat it, and it is not affected by the \nnaturalelements. Unlessanextraordinary force actsupon it, the body effectively \nremains in stasis. \nBy buying more levels ofKu, you can strengthen your Ku’s ability to protect \nyour body several ways. A powerful Ka ensures protection for your khat on a \nmore mundane level - \ntomb robbers slip while scaling a wall, or a snoopy \narchaeologist loses the journal with the only copy of the directions to the tomb. \nWhatever it is, the effect is always coincidental, and is likely the source of many \n“mummy’s curse” tales. \nThe levels of Ku also grant it an equal number of extra Traits to use in bids \nagainst attempts to harm your khat. Likewise, those who would harm your khat \nare forced to bid the same number of extra Traits in challenges whenever they \nseek to injure your corpse or defile your tomb. So three levels of Ku grants you \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthree extra Traits to add when comparing on ties or to use in bidding, and it \nmeans that the local tomb raider, who was given a Static Mental Challenge \nagainst six Traits to figure out how to open the door, must add those on to the \ndifficulty (for a grand total of a nine-Trait difficulty). \nLEGACY \nYou left something of lasting value on the world in your First or Second \nLife from which you still draw strength. It may be a structure, a great historical \ndeed, an idea or even the mummified khat from your First Life on display in a \nmuseum, so long as it is remembered by mortals (not just other Reborn). In \norder to receive the benefits of this Background, the legacy must still exist. An \ninfamous deed is not a Legacy unless it led to greater Balance and justice. The \nLegacy must also continue to exist, whether physically or in memory. A \ndestroyed or forgotten Legacy means the loss of the Background. \nOnce per game session, an Amenti in the presence of her Legacy may call \nfor a Simple Challenge. If successful, two Sekhem are temporarily added to her \npool for the night. If the challenge is tied or lost, only one Sekhem is added. \nMEMORY \nMost Amenti can recall vague impressions and images from the First Life \nof their tem-akh. You can tap those memories of your life in ancient Egypt and \nof the afterlife in h a t .  \nFor every Trait in this category, you can attempt to recall a specific piece \nof information, such as locations of certain tombs or a mystical phrase to \nactivate an artifact. The Storyteller determines the specific information you \ncan obtain. Those Traits also, once per session, tap memories of forgotten \nAbilities, allowing you to initiate a challenge for a skill that your Amenti may \nnot possess in her Second or Third Life. \nRESOURCES \nYou have access to liquid capital and spending money. You also have some \nsolid resources that you can use when times are tight. Unlike the use of Finance, \nthese resources are always readily available, and they come to you automatically \ndue to your investments, jobs and holdings. \nYour number of Resources Traits determines the amount of money and \ncapital that you can secure. By expending temporary Resources Traits (which \nreturn at the next game session), you can draw on your regular income, as \nshown in the accompanying table. If you expend permanent Resources, you can \ndivest yourself of holdings, allowing access to 10 times the amount shown on \nthe table. Storyteller always adjudicates the limits of what you can buy. Truly \npowerful uses of Resources are best left to downtimes and moderation between \ngame sessions. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTOMB \nYour khat resides in a safe resting place between lives while your spirit \nrecovers in h a t .  The Tomb may be any place where your body can rest for \nweeks, even months, at a time. A sub-basement, an isolated cave in the \nmountains or an undiscovered tomb in the Valley of the Kings, all suffice as a \nproper tomb. This Background also represents the amount of grave goods you \npossess to assist you while you sojourn in the Underworld. \nEach Trait in this Background represents the luxury and security of your \nTomb. If you wish, your levels can represent multiple lesser tombs. \nVESSEL \nYou have an item that is capable of storing Sekhem that you can draw upon \nlater. A vessel can be virtually anything, but most have been within the Web \nof Faith for a long period of time, attuning to the energies of Sekhem. It may \nbe apiece of jewelry, a stone from an ancient temple, a scarab amulet, or a relic \nlike a bone from an ancient corpse. \nFor every Trait in this category, one Trait of Sekhem may be stored in a \nVessel. To activate a Vessel, you must concentrate for one turn as the Sekhem \nflows into you, which you can use like your own. To store Sekhem, you must \nconcentrate for two full hours and spend one Trait of Sekhem, imbuing the \nVessel with this Trait, up to its maximum capacity. Udja-sen and characters \nwith the Lifeblood Flaw (p.102) cannot take this Background nor use another’s \nVessel. \nMERITS AND FLAWS \nAs optional Traits to help flesh out your character, Merits and Flaws aid \nin specifying certain benefits and hindrances that add depth that is not readily \ncovered by Attributes, Abilities and Backgrounds. All Merits and Flaws are \norganized into specific categories: Physical, Social, Mental and Supernatural. \nIn order to purchase Merits, you must spend Free Traits. Conversely, taking a \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nFlaw adds burden to your beast, but offers extra Traits to spend elsewhere.-You \nmay take as many as seven Traits each in Merits and Flaws. \nNormally, you may purchase Merits and Flaws only during character \ncreation; however, with an appropriate explanation, you may purchase a new \nMerit (with Experience at double the cost) toovercome anexisting Flaw (with \nExperience at double the cost). \nPHYSICAL MERITS AND FLAWS \nACUTE SENSES (1 TRAIT MERIT) \nOne or more of your senses are particularly sharp (must specify one of your \nfive senses). You are two Traits up on all challenges involving this particular \nsense. You may have multiple Acute Senses, but you must purchase this Merit \nonce for each sense. \nCATLIKE BALANCE (1 TRAIT MERIT) \nYou are sure-footed and almost never slip or get dizzy. Your sense of balance \nis so keen that you can traverse even the most narrow of ledges or wires. You \nare two Traits up in tests where your balance is a factor. \nHIGH PAIN TOLERANCE (3 TRAIT MERIT; 1 TRAIT FOR \nSEFEKHI) \nYour character can shrug off the effects of injury more easily than other \nmortals or Reborn. In game terms, this advantage adds an extra Bruised health \nlevel to your character's health. \nHUGE SIZE (4 TRAIT MERIT) \nYou are abnormally large, possibly over seven feet tall and weighing over \n300 pounds. You gain an extra Bruised health level, and Storytellers should try \nto allow only those people befitting this description to take this Trait. \nDISFIGURED (2 TRAIT FLAW) \nEither a birth defect or an injury during one of your lifetimes has left you \ndisfigured in some way. Storytellers should work with you to create an \nappropriate disfigurement. You are down two Traits in any Social Challenges, \nsave for Intimidation. \nSMELL OF THE GRAVE (1 TRAIT FLAW) \nYou exude a stench of wet earth that puts you automatically one Trait \ndown onsocial interactions withmortals. Your earthy aromaisquitedistinctive \nto those familiar with you. \nSHORT (2 TRAIT FLAW) \nYou're just shorter than everyone else. You are at least a foot shorter then \naverage height and have trouble seeing over counters and reaching for things. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nADDICTION (3 TRAIT FLAW) \nYou suffer from an addiction to a substance, whether biological or \nchemical, such as drugs or alcohol. It is up to the Storyteller to decide the \nspecific effects of this addiction, but you must satiate it at least once a day. At \nStoryteller discretion, depending on your poison of choice, you may suffer \nNegative Traits (such as Impatient or Lethargic) until you get your fix. This is a \ngood plot device for a character who must search out the vice that might stem \nfrom her First Life. \nMONSTROUS (3 TRAIT FLAW) \nFor some reason, you are hideous and physically displeasing. As a result, \nyou may not initiate any Social Challenges other than those concerning \nIntimidation, and you may not take any Appearance-related Social Traits, such \nas Alluring or Gorgeous. \nPERMANENT WOUND (3 TRAIT FLAW) \nPerhaps you suffered a deep scar at the hands of a Bane Mummy, or maybe \nyour khat was severely injured while your tem-akh traveled Duat. As a result, \nyou have permanently lost one Healthy and one Bruised health level. \nSOCIAL MERITS AND FLAWS \nNATURAL LEADER (1 TRAIT MERIT) \nYou were born to lead. Your magnetism attracts people, and all they want \nto do is follow your example. You are two Bonus Traits up in challenges involving \nleadership. You must have at least six Social Traits in order to take this Merit. \nNOBLE BEARING (1 TRAIT MERIT) \nPerhaps you were of noble blood in your First or Second Life. For whatever \nreason, you have a noble bearing and manner befitting of a queen or pharaoh. \nOthers take notice when you speak, and they respect your personal space with \na wide berth. You gain a one-Trait bonus to all Social Challenges where you \nbring the force of your personality to bear. \nFASCINATING GAZE (2 TRAIT MERIT) \nThe eyes are the window to the soul, and yours are engaging. They may be \nan unusual color, have a strong shine to them, or seem to reflect the wisdom \nof the ages. You may have big baby-blues that no one can resist, or have the \ndarkest orbs that can freeze others'hearts withonly aglare. Yougaina two-Trait \nbonus to all Social Challenges involving eye contact. \nDARK SECRET (1 TRAIT FLAW) \nSome incident in your past haunts you and you strive to cover it up. Should \nyour friends discover this secret, you will be ostracized from them and branded \nfor your misdeed. You gain the Negative Trait: Untrustworthy. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n.q... \n. \n...C_.. \n.. . \nENEMY (1 TO 5 TRAIT FLAW) \nThere is someone or something out to get you. The value of this flaw depends \non the power of your enemy. An enemy with an equal level of power to yours is \nworth one Trait, while a coterie of vampires or cabal of mages is worth five Traits. \nThe Storyteller should work with you in order to hammer out the details of your \nenemy. Though your enemy may not show up at every game session, his presence \nis somehow always brought up to keep him fresh in your mind. \nHUNTED (4 TRAIT FLAW) \nA hunter has decided that you must be eliminated. He has the skills and \nresources to make your life “interesting” (and to snuff it out, if you aren’t careful), \nand he keeps you looking over your shoulder. Your friends, family, allies and \nassociates are also in peril should this hunter decide to turn his eye their way. \nMENTAL MERITS A N D  FLAWS \nCONCENTRATION (1 TRAIT MERIT) \nYou shut out all noises and interruptions that hinder other people. No \npenalty for sudden distractions. \nIRON WILL (3 TRAIT MERIT) \nYou are indomitable of will and a rock of stubborn resolve. No matter how \ncharismatic or intimidating someone may seem, your determination never \nfalters. You may resist mind-altering effects by spending a Willpower Trait. \nNIGHTMARES (1 TRAIT FLAW) \nTwisted dreams plague you in your sleep, bleeding over into your daily life. \nPerhaps you recall the instant before your Second Life came to an end, or your \nonly glimpses of your First Life are very unpleasant. These nightmares cause you \nto lose sleep and remembrances haunt your waking hours. At the beginning of \nevery game session make a Simple Test. If you fail, you are down two Traits on \nevery challenge for the rest of the night due to lack of sleep. \nAMNESIA (2 TRAIT FLAW \nYour mind is a blank slate in reference to your Second and/or Third Life, \nand you recall no memories of your past friends, family or foes. Storytellers \nshould write up your character’s history, including the reasons for your \nAmnesia, keeping hidden the character sheet save, for your Abilities, Powers \nand Merits and Flaws from all but your First Life. \nFLASHBACKS (2 TRAIT FLAW) \nYou sometimes recall traumatic experiences that you went through in one \nof your past lives. You may mistake people, places or things for familiar ones of \nantiquity. Anytime you are in a situation that resembles your character’s story \nbackground, you must enter into a Static Mental Challenge or flee in renewed \nterror, or possibly fall catatonic to the ground. Spending a Trait of Willpower \nallows an Amenti a temporary reprieve from this flaw. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nPHOBIA (2 TRAIT FLAW) \nYou suffer from an irrational fear of an object, creature or circumstance - \nblood, spiders, heights, crowds, etc. -and do everything in your power to avoid \nit. Your friends view you as a weak link and constantly watch you for signs of \na breakdown. When confronted with the object of your fear, you must make a \nStatic Willpower Challenge against adifficulty set by the Storyteller. If you fail, \nyou are unable to initiate any challenges and are two Traits down defending \nagainst challenges until you spend a Willpower Trait to overcome your fear. \nANACHRONISM (5 TRAIT FLAW) \nEither something went wrong during the Spell of Life, where you joined \nwith a tem-akh, or perhaps your spirit was too weak to push forth any sort of \ninfluence in conjunction with the completing spirit, but you do not blend in. \nIn fact, you couldn’t be more awkward, as you retain incomplete memories of \nyour First Life and absolutely no Second Life memories. At character creation, \nyou work only with First Life characteristics, which means nothing modem \n(Computer, Firearms, or even speaking a modem language). You have virtually \nno contact to your Second Life, and find yourself in a strange concrete world. \nSUPERNATURAL MERITS AND FLAWS \nOSIRIS’ GIFT (1 TRAIT MERIT) \nYou have a green thumb, even in barren lands and deserts. You can make \ngrass grow, flowers bloom, plants sprout with a simple touch. These plants \nalways do well, although once you’ve left them behind, they must survive the \nnatural environment on their own. \nMAGIC RESISTANCE (2 TRAIT MERIT) \nMagical powers do not affect you the way they do others. You gain an \nautomatic retest when testing against any form of magic, though this bonus \napplies to both benevolent and harmful effects. However, you can never learn \nthe powerful Hekau paths if you possess a Magic Resistance. \nIMMUNE TO DISEASE (3 TRAIT MERIT) \nThe powerful Sekhem in your Amenti body renders you immune to normal \ndisease and infection. As long as you have at least one Trait of Sekhem, you \ncannot be infected with any non-mortal disease (measles, chicken pox, the \ncommon cold), but your immune system is fair game should you retain no \nSekhem in your body. If you are infected but restore your Sekhem later, your body \nheals at one health level per hour for each Trait of Sekhem in your body. If you \nrestore two Traits, for example, you would heal two health levels per hour. \nIMMUNE TO POISON (3 TRAIT MERIT) \nThe Sekhem protects your body from the caustic effects of mundane \npoisons, although poison and potions created using Alchemy still affect you \nadversely. If your Amenti’s Sekhem drops to zero, mundane poisons affect you \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nas normal. Should you become infected but restore your Sekhem later, your \nbody heals at one health level per hour for each Trait of Sekhem in your body. \nBES’ BLESSING (3 TRAIT MERIT) \nYou’re just damn lucky - \nselling your soul does that sometimes. You get \nthree “Lucky” retests per story, for which you bid a Lucky Trait. (“I just set off \na firewall? I bid Lucky and call for a retest! I won the retest, and the firewall \ndidn’t go off after all.”). The result of the retest is the final result of the \nchallenge. \nUNBONDABLE (3 TRAIT MERIT) \nAmenti live in a world filled with vampires like the Followers of Set. These \nvampires can create what is known as a blood bond, which is aspiritual link that \nforces victims into willing servitude, through three drinks of their blood. With \nthis Merit, however, the blood bond cannot take hold of you. No matter how \nmuch blood you drink, you will never be bound, even partially. \nGIFT OF THOTH (5 TRAIT MERIT) \nLike the legendary magicians of ancient Egypt, you are especially gifted in \nthe use of a particular Hekau path. Choose one path (most likely your Amenti’s \nprimary path). Sekhem costs for all rituals for that path are halved (round up). \nIf you have the Lifeblood Flaw, you suffer half the number of levels of bashing \ndamage when casting a ritual. \nCURSED (1 TO 5 TRAIT FLAW) \nYou are afflicted by a powerful curse. The number of Traits determines the \nstrength and tenacity of the curse. A one-Trait curse might cause you to \nbecome clumsy or to lose any paper you write on; a three-Trait curse might \nrequire you to always lock every door you pass through; a five-Trait curse can \nbe powerful enough to one day be your undoing. The exact effects, as well as \nways to overcome it, are up to the Storyteller. \nSOUL’S REFLECTION (1 TRAIT FLAW) \nYour character appears as she did in her First Life in mirror reflections and \nphotographs. However, sheappearsas shedoes inher ThirdLife whenvideotaped. \nObviously this Flaw can cause problems with hiding an Undying nature. \nTOUCH OF FROST (1 TRAIT FLAW) \nYour chilling caress pulls heat away and kills plants. This Flaw is mostly an \neerie effect, though you should mention your ice-cold touch to anyone who has \nphysical contact with you. It is not difficult to track you in grassy parks or places \nof dense foliage. \nHAUNTED (3 TRAIT FLAW) \nA malicious spirit, possibly a felled foe or a jealous spirit you met in h a t ,  \nhas decided to torment you from beyond the grave. Though it is usually limited \nto ghostly manifestations, chilling screams and the occasional shove, it does its \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nbest to make your life difficult. The Storyteller should create the spirit and have \na Narrator occasionally follow you to make sure you suffer your Flaw. \nLESSER RESURRECTION (3 TRAIT FLAW) \nYou belong to a group of mummies who avoided the new Spell of Life, and \nyou are considered a rebel. To Amenti, you are Shuankhsen, known as the \nLifeless. The Shemsu-heru and related cults have very little love for you and \nyours. You are alive, but not perfectly. You have all of the physical trappings of \nlife, but you are infertile, and register under supernatural perceptions with a \nweak life aura. This weak aura forces you to make a Static Physical Challenge \nwhen you are struck down to the Incapacitated health level. If you fail, you \nsuffer a swift yet painless death. Your blood contains no actual vitae and is \nunpalatable and infertile to vampires. \nEW’S REST (3 TRAIT FLAW: 1 TRAIT FOR MESEKTET) \nWhen night falls, the sun god falls into the sleep of death as his great barge \nsails through the Underworld. According to legend, the dead stand guard over \nRa’s body and fight the demons of Apophis who seek to consume him and keep \nhim from rising again. Whether or not you seek to protect Ra, you are bound \nto follow Ra’s cycle of death and life. When the sun sets each night, you fall \ndead and do not return to life until dawn. Sunrise does not repair any damage \nyou suffer during the night. It is possible that you could be hurt badly enough \nto plunge into an actual death cycle. \nSLOW HEALING (3 TRAIT FLAW) \nYou have difficulty healing damage to your khat. Your natural healing rate \nis half that of a normal person, and special healing methods (such as alchemical \nor through other Hekau paths) are only half as effective. \nTOUCH OF DEATH (4 TRAIT FLAW) \nYou bring with you the taint of death from the Lands of the Dead, affecting \nwhatever you touch. Simple living things, like plants and insects, wither and \ndie at your touch. Hardier creatures also suffer damage, losing one health level \nfor every hour after the first in which they remain in contact with you. The \ninjured and ill cannot heal in your presence. You endure a one-Trait penalty \nwhen performing healing rituals. You can heal normally, but suffer this one- \nTrait penalty if someone tries to heal you through ritual. This Flaw is most \ncommon for Sefekhi mummies, and it is often found coupled with the Gift of \nThoth in Necromancy. You cannot take Touch of Frost with this Flaw, as this \nFlaw already encompasses those effects. \nLIFEBLOOD (5 TRAIT FLAW: 2 TRAIT FOR UDJA-SEN) \nAs with the Udja-sen, you cannot draw Sekhem from any external source, \nincluding the Web of Faith, and instead must expend your own life-force. You \nhave no Sekhem to spend. Any time that your character uses Sekhem, she must \nexpend the corresponding number of health levels. If the Lifeblood Flaw is \nchosen, you cannot take the Immune to Disease or Immune to Poisons Merits. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nBALANCE \nAs an agent of Ma’at in the world, a mummy has a Balance rating that \nmeasures the strength of her understanding and relationship with universal \njustice, balance and rightness. A mummy starts out with a limited Balance, \nwhich is granted by the joining and the Spell of Life. As she studies and \nprogresses, proving herself worthy through words and deeds, she strengthens \nand deepens her understanding of this universal principle. An Amenti with a \ndeep understanding of Balance is capable of amazing feats, since those in \nharmony with Ma’at know that the force of the universe is behind their deeds. \nThose players who are familiar with Vampire: The Masquerade might equate \nthis Trait with Humanity, but those rules do not provide a complete picture of \nwhat Balance is. Rather, it is a spiritual and cosmological enlightenment that \nis embodied in a particular moral code. \nAn Amenti begins character creation with one Trait of Balance, and he \ncan purchase more with Freebie Traits, up to three Balance Traits. \nA Reborn’s Balance determines how much Sekhem she can have at any \none time. A mummy can attain a greater Sekhem rating only through the use \nof Hekau. \nAn Amenti can call for a Balance Challenge versus an appropriate number \nof Traits in order to resist any temptation or force that causes her to violate the \nnatural order, which includes vampiric powers of Dominate and other wizardry \npowers, as well as Social Attributes and Abilities. \nA mummy can use the strength of her Balance to protect the natural order \nfrom unnatural changes, and therefore gains a Trait to her Balance score when \nopposing Sphere magic cast by mages. This type of countermagic is considered \na single action, versus eight Traits. \nAn Amenti can have Attribute ratings equal to his Balance score, so a \ncharacter whose Balance goes six Traits can spend experience to increase his \nAttributes to superhuman levels. Similarly, a mummy’s magical skills are \nlimited by his adherence to the path of Ma’at, and thus no Hekau can exceed \nhis Balance score. \nS E E M  \nThe ancient Egyptians used Sekhem to mean alternately “power” or “life- \nforce.” For the Undying, Sekhem refers to the life energy flowing through the \nworld and focused within the Web of Faith. This energy helps sustain them in \ntheir immortal existence, and it allows them to use their magic of Hekau. It is \nto them what Gnosis is to the changing breeds, what quintessence is to the \nmages, what blood is to the vampires. The Web of Faith plays a key role in a \nmummy’s rebirth, as it acts as a conduit for the power ofOsiris himself. It is fairly \neasy for an Amenti to tap into the Web to regain lost Sekhem. \nA mummy regains Sekhem in a few different ways. Each may be performed \nanywhere in the world except Osiris’ Blessing, which may only be used within \nthe Web of Faith. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nA mummy automatically regains one I rait ot Sekhem at sunrise each day \nwhere his physical body resides, representing the renewal of Ra rising from the \nUndenvorld. \nOsiris bestows energy upon his children where he dwells in the Web of \nFaith. For each full day that a mummy has spent within the region of the Web \nof Faith, his player may initiate a Balance Challenge with a difficulty of the \nShroud rating. Each success restores one Trait of Sekhem up to a maximum of \nthe character’s Balance rating. If the player loses the challenge, the mummy \nrecovers no Sekhem. \nThe world outside the Lands of Faith is strongly influenced by the power \nof Apophis, making Sekhem less freely available. Few isolated havens remain \nwhere Ma’at is still strong, although they are often under the power of other \nsupernatural forces. A mummy lucky enough to gain entry to one may spend \na full day meditating there to recover Sekhem. The player makes a Mental \nChallenge, and if successful, can recover her character’s Sekhem by the same \nrules listed for Osiris’ Blessing. \nUdja.sen may transfer their own Sekhem to another mummy. \nCertain Hekau rituals can provide the character with Sekhem. \nA mummy can draw Sekhem from a Vessel (see the Vessel Background for \ndetails). \nA mummy can draw strength and spiritual power from a legacy from her \nprevious lives (see the Legacy Background for details). \nMages can use the Prime Sphere to grant a mummy Sekhem in the form of \nQuintessence. An Effect that restores or grants Quintessence does the same for \nSekhem. See Laws of Ascension for details on Quintessence. \nWILLPOWER \nWillpower Traits measure the strength of your character’s resolve and \nsense of self. By exerting your Willpower, you can withstand otherwise \nuntenable conditions and renew your commitment to a course of action. \nWillpower Traits are not described with adjectives. You simply have \npermanent Willpower (your normal limit of Willpower Traits) and temporary \nWillpower (your expendable Traits). Your tribe determines your starting \npermanent and temporary Willpower. When you expend temporary Willpower \nTraits or raise your permanent Willpower, you regain temporary Traits at a rate \nof one per game session (though your Storyteller may vary this pace to suit the \nneeds of his game or to simplify bookkeeping). \nExpending a Willpower Trait opens the gate for a number of effects, \nbut generally to keep self-determination and to empower difficult or \ncomplex actions. Using Willpower is almost always a reflective action and \ndoes not count as your turn. \nA Willpower Trait can be spent to refresh all of your lost Traits in an \nAttribute category - \nPhysical, Social or Mental. You may do so once per \ncategory per game session. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nbxpenditure ot a Willpower ‘1-rait allows you to gain a retest when \ndefending against a Mental or Social Challenge. Trait loss works as normal \nfor such retests. \nSpending one Willpower Trait enables you to enter a challenge for which \nyou lack an appropriate Ability. Thus, you can make a test even if you \nnormally require a specific Ability that you don’t have or that you have \nused up. \nYou can expend a Willpower Trait to ignore all wound penalties, up to \nand including Incapacitated, for the duration of a full turn. \nSAMPLE CHARACTER CREATION \nRob is tired of tabletop games and decides that he wants to try out a local \nlive-action venue. He is used to playing Vampire: The Masquerade, but does \nnot care to pretend to be a blood-sucking creature. He does enjoy pretending \nto be an ancient incarnation from a world just recently remembered and \nconcludes his search with Mummy: The Resurrection. Rob decides to pick up \na copy of Mummy: The Resurrection at his local hobby store, then gets on the \nInternet and searches for LARP games in his area. He finally settles on a popular \nchronicle and sits down with the John the Storyteller to discuss his character \nideas, and to get a more in-depth idea of the game’s story and plots. \nSTAGE ONE: THE SECOND LIFE \nStep One: Concept \nRob begins by looking for a concept, a basic idea of who his character was \nin his Second Life. He decides that his character was a shallow, power-hungry \nbusinessman, someone who has underlings to do his dirty work and lots of liquid \nassets. Thinking further, Rob decides his character’s severe lack of respect for \nothers as the consummate conniver would be attractive to a wandering Amenti \nsoul-that \nof a Mesektet. The Joining would aid his character in turning over \nnew leaf, to atone for the sins of his former life. John makes a mental note to \nplan for fun plot twists to throw at Rob’s character in his struggle for Ma’at. Rob \nchooses Martyr for his Nature and Caregiver for his Demeanor, reflecting the \nnew facet of his personality that the Mesektet spirit has supplemented to his \nonce-selfish and slimy personality. John points out that the Path of Ma’at is the \none and only path on the quest for Balance that an Amenti can follow. John \nthen instructs Rob to choose an Inheritance, to figure out what sort of First Life \nhis character led. Rob decides that he was a priest, skilled in the art of healing \nand divine magic. Finally a name for his character comes to him - \nBrian. \nStep Two: Attributes \nRob now prioritizes his Attribute categories to determine his mortal \nstrengths and weaknesses. He decides that Social is Brian’s primary Trait \ncategory, Physical is secondary and Mental is tertiary. Rob explains that his \nchoices reflect Brian’s abilities as a manipulator and conniver (Social) willing \nto take physical action if necessary (Physical), but gives no thought to the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\naftermath of his schemes (Mental). Now Rob must choose individual Traits for \neach category, beginning with six Social Traits. He chooses Charismatic, \nCharismatic, Intimidating, Magnetic, Persuasive and Persuasive. That makes Brian \na competent manipulator. Next his Physical, with four Traits, and Rob picks \nthe Traits Brawny, Rugged, Stalwart and Tough, reflecting Brian’s bulky body \nbut lack of agility. Finally comes Mental, with three Traits, and Rob picks \nCunning, Cunning and Dedicated to reflect Brian’s overall determination to get \nwhat he wants, even if he lacks the know-how. \nStep Three: Advantages \nNow Rob has to choose Brian’s Abilities. There are many that Rob wants \nto scribble down on his character sheet, but for now he is restricted to five \nAbilities as a mortal. John explains that, at the stage, Rob is not able to increase \nany Ability above three Traits. To stay true to Brian’s shady personality and \ncutthroat lifestyle, Rob selects Computer, Finance, Finance, Fiream and \nSubte.rfuge. All of these Abilities come together to aid Brian in his business life \nas a top executive. They also provide a narrow scope of talents, reflecting a \nsingle-mindedness to play to his strengths and use them to his advantage. \nStep Four: Backgrounds \nRob must decide what mortal ties Brian has cultivated during his mortal life. \nTo stick to Brian’s beaten path, he quickly scribbles down one level of Finance \nInfluence and two levels of Resources. Rob explains that Brian had skimmed off \nthe top of many business deals and was able to build up a small nest-egg. \nStep Five: Details \nJohn instructs Rob that, at this stage, he has the option to spend five Free \nTraits wherever he feels Brian, as a mortal, might need a little beefing up. Rob \nlooks over his character and decides that Brian should have more liquid assets \nand places a Free Traits into Resources. He also thinks that Brian should have \na source for inside information and spends a Free Trait into the Contacts \nbackground. So far John agrees with Rob’s decisions. Next, Rob chooses to \nincrease Brian’s Social capacity and allots two Free Traits into the Social \nAttribute category, specifically Magnetic and Persuasive. Finally he invests his \nlast Free Trait into the Physical Trait Enduring. Now, Brian has eight Social \nTraits: Charismatic, Charismatic, Intimidating, Magnetic, Magnetic, Persuasive, \nPersuasive and Persuasive. He also has five Physical Traits: Brawny, Enduring, \nRugged, Stalwart andTough. Finally, Brian has the following BackgroundTraits: \nthe Influence of Finance, Contacts, Resources x 3. John takes a look at the \nnumbers and everything adds up in his calculations; he then approves the \ncharacter for this stage. \nSTAGE TWO: THE REBIRTH \nStep One: The Second Death \nThis step, as John explains, is designed to help Rob work out the details of \nBrian’s death and rebirth as Amenti. He further explains that Rob should take \na few minutes, even an hour or more if necessary, to detail this first step. For the \nnext 20 minutes, Rob pens an outline chart of his character, then comes back to \nJohn with a story of “just desserts.” Rob explains to John that Brian was killed \nduring a shoddily executed blackmail scheme, shot 10 times - \none bullet for \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\neach thousand dollars Brian attempted to extort from a busin \nthen moves on to Brian’s rebirth, when his soul meets up with a brilliant glowing \ncreature, the Mesektet tem-akhspirit that found him in adark place, offering him \ntwo fates: eternal life or to move forward to whatever afterlife he has coming to \nhim. Brian, in a moment of clarity, realizes that his soul is not destined for the \npearly gates and chooses eternal life. The tem-akh spirit joins with Brian’s soul, \nforcing his physical body to heal the fatal bullet wounds and, as if moving like a \nzombie, travels to the Lands of Faith and seeks out the Spell of Life. This Rite of \nRebirth succeeds and Brian is reborn Brian Ferguson-Rahotep. \nStep Two: Attributes \nRob must now allot two additional Traits to his Attributes, preferably to \nthe ones where he lacks stronger numbers. To keep it simple, Rob increases \nBrian’s Mental Traits by two, and takes Knowledgeable and Wise, reflecting this \nnew influence on his life. This raises Brian’s overall total to five Mental Traits. \nStep Three: Abilities \nNow Rob is instructed to add five more Abilities to his total, and is allowed \nto pass beyond three Traits in a single category. John adds that Rob may want \nto choose some Abilities specific to the ancient Amenti knowledge. Rob then \nchooses Cosmology, Divination, Medicine, Meditation and Occult. Brian now has \na total of 10 Abilities: Computer, Finance, Finance, Firearms, and Subterfuge and \nthe five Ability Traits above. John compliments Rob in his choices, noting that \nRob seems to grasp the basic idea behind the Joining and how a tem-akh spirit \nprovides Traits that a nehem-sen spirit lacks before rebirth. \nStep Four: Advantages \nJohn informs Rob that this is where the supernatural part of Brian is fleshed \nout-the \nnifty powers and Backgrounds. Rob must choose his Hekau and allot \nthree Traits into them, reserving one Trait for Celestial, his primary Hekau path. \nJohn explains that each Amenti has his own primary Hekau, and that Celestial \nis the primary Hekau path for the Mesektet. Before Rob continues, John explains \nthat Rob cannot have a Hekau path rating higher than Brian’s Balance score, \nwhich starts at one Trait. Rob looks over Basic-level Celestial spells and rituals, \nand chooses Becalm, granting access to a spell that allows Brian protection from \nadverse weather conditions within a limited distance from him. Next he chooses \nthe Alchemy Hekau ritual Simple Elixir: Monkey’s Dew, which magically boosts a \nrecipient’s physical dexterity. Finally, Rob chooses the Necromancy Hekau spell \nJudge the Soul, enabling Brian to gaze at a subject and judge the purity of his soul. \nNow Rob must add two additional Background Traits, keeping in mind what \nJohn mentioned about these steps and choosing Traits more geared to an \nAmenti, and allots one Trait each to the Ba and Ka Backgrounds. \nStep Five: Finishing Touches \nRob has come to the last facet of character creation. He must first write \ndown his starting Balance score, which for any Amenti is one Trait, then he \nassigns his starting Willpower of five Traits. Last comes Brian’s starting \nSekhem, the magical power within Brian, which, like any starting Amenti, \nbegins with one Trait. John then asks Rob if he’d like to take any Negative \nTraits or Flaws. Rob decides that Brian is Clumsy, even after his rebirth - \nhis \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nbulk is somewhat ot a nuisance. Rob also invests in Flashbacks, a two-Trait flaw \nthat he deems appropriate as a constant reminder of Brian’s mortal demise. \nFinally he takes the Permanent Wound, a three-Trait flaw to further play \nup Brian’s final moments in mortal life, as he suffers each morning from the 10 \nfatal bullet wounds. Rob can now spend five additional Free Traits, plus the six \nextra Free Traits he earned from taking Negative Traits and Flaws, for a total \nof 11 Free Traits to spend into Merits or to increase other Traits. Rob spends \ntwo Free Traits to increase Brian’s overall Balance score by one Trait, for a total \nBalance score of two Traits. With nine Free Traits remaining, Rob allots two \nmore Free Traits to increase Brian’s Sekhem score by one Trait, for an overall \nSekhem score of two Traits. Seven Free Traits to go -Rob takes advantage of \nhis increased Balance score and purchases the Basic-level Cekstial spell Sahu- \nRa, which bathes Brian in a brilliant sunlit aura. Now down to four Free Traits, \nRob spends three more Free Traits into the Ba background, now at four Traits. \nJohn comments that Brian will rarely spend any more than a few days in \nthe Underworld, an impressive score and show of spiritual strength. His final \nFree Trait goes to the Tomb Background, which will provide a basic resting \nplace for his khat while his Ba travels into the Underworld. Rob reasons that \nsince Brian’s Ba score is so high and requires very little time in the Underworld, \nhe did not need five-star accommodations; it is one last showing of the catharsis \nBrian has undergone through the Joining. John makes sure that Rob makes a \nnote of his Mesektet Purpose and Liability, and seeing that all of his numbers \nadd up, sanctions Brian Ferguson-Rahotep as a playable character in his LARP. \nRob is ready to pit Brian against the Apepnu and other minions of Apophis. \nEXPERIENCE \nThe Amenti, like living people, have the opportunity to grow and change. \nThey can reflect on what’s happened to them, what they’ve attempted, and \nhow it worked out. Experience points quantify this process of development in \ncapabilities for characters. \nStorytellers and Narrators award experience Traits at the end of each \nsession. Each character who takes part in play and survives should get one \nexperienceTrait. AdditionalTraits come at Storyteller discretion. The character \nof a player who makes useful and enjoyable contributions to the game, and who \nhelps create opportunities for other players along the way, often receives two \nexperience Traits. Three-Trait awards are usually saved for truly memorable \nplay - particularly at the climax of long-running storylines and scenes of \nappropriate and heroic roleplaying, and for significant contributions to making \nthe game possible, like securing a great site on a regular basis. Generally, most \nplayers earn one experience point per session. \nChronicles with sessions held just once or twice a month, or even less, may \nwant to increase the basic award to two Traits per session. This allowance lets \ncharacters develop about as rapidly as they would in a chronicle with more \nfrequent sessions, which players usually find satisfying. It is possible to run a \nmutually rewarding chronicle in which characters develop little or if at all, but \nplayers want to know about a Storyteller inclination of this sort before \ncommitting themselves to play. (They will also be more likely to agree if they \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nget'more than the usual starting Trait totals, so that characters begin play \nsomewhere in the realm they could normally reach only after extended play and \naccumulation of experience Traits.) \nStorytellers should aim for consistency and fairness in experience awards. \nPlayers notice such things, and those who find themselves consistently suffering \ncapricious shortfalls tend to drop out, while those who consistently received \nunearned bonuses are likely to abuse their status in ways that make the game \nless enjoyable for others. It is all right to decide that higher or lower experience \nawards would help out the game in some important way, but these changes go \nbetter when players get a chance to discuss them with Storytellers and thus \nunderstand why they're happening. \nNote that mummies can continue to learn and develop their potential \nwhile in the Underworld. Learning doesn't ever have to stop for the Reborn. \nLike bonus Traits, experience Traits lets players buy new capabilities for \ntheir characters, according to this chart.\" \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n“Hekau” is the ancient Egyptian word for magic; literally, it means “words \nof power.” Some forms of magic hinged on one’s position - \ntradition says that \nthe pharaoh could do things by virtue of being the living incarnation of the \ngods, for instance. Other forms were available to anyone willing to study the \ntexts and practice the disciplines. The Hekau as described here draw on that \ntradition. Some require the innate power of Sekhem to use, but the knowledge \ncomponent of each is available to anyone with access to teachers and texts. \nMost tem-akh retain some knowledge of protective charms and the like \nfrom their First Lives. The Cult of Isis preserved more lore, and its members now \ninstruct the Amenti. In addition, the Amenti make their own discoveries and \ntrade insights with each other. \nAlchemy: Named for A1 Khem, the Black Land, Alchemy is one aspect of \nEgyptian magic with a living inheritance. The Western magical tradition \nincludes many variations on Alchemy, and they all have roots in Egyptian \npractice: the elixir of life, universal medicine, the transmutation of elements. \nThe Scroll-bearers guarded knowledge lost to living people in their time in the \nUnderworld, and now they return it to the world. \nAmulets: Meket, the art of crafting charms, focuses magical power \nthrough material objects for the protection of their wearers. Wealthy and \npowerful Egyptians were interred with as many amulets as they could obtain to \nguard them against the Underworld’s dangers. The Tomb Watchers mastered \nat least a few warding spells while guarding their respective khat, and build on \nthose basics after the Rite of Rebirth. \nCelestial: The gods move in the heavens, and the careful student of \ncelestial phenomena can learn much. Armed with knowledge, the magician \ncan then command nature. Celestial magic is often subtle, but far-reaching in \nits potential. The Night Suns carry a special affinity for Ra and his movements \nwithin them, and reach out from the sun to the rest of the cosmos. \nEffigy: This art relies on sympathetic magic, which is the bond between \na physical representation of a thing and the thing itself. Like amulets, ushabti, \nor “answerers,)) were often laid alongside buried Egyptians to assist them in the \nafterlife. Today the Spirit Scepters apply their experience of the Underworld \nand their memories of the ancient craft to attend to the needs of Osiris’ modem \nservants. \nNecromancy: The magic of the dead reached unparalleled heights in \nEgypt, in part because of the Egyptian insights into the complex nature of the \nsoul - \nits many parts and their interactions with each other and the body. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nNecromancy as the Unbandaged Ones practice it makes particular use of the \ndark power of the khaibit, but it can also deal with the whole of the soul’s legacy. \nNomenclature: Egyptianmythology sayscreation began with a word, and \neverything is what it is because of its ren, or true name. The evolution of \nlanguage has hidden many secrets of naming magic from mortal magicians; \nonly the surviving Shemsu-heru remember the authentic power of old. New \nAmenti draw on memory and concealed lore to work feats that dazzle living \nmages of other traditions. \nWORKING MAGIC \nThe Hekau are not unidirectional sequences of power. Each level of \nmastery that a mummy possesses allows multiple options. There are two \nseparate measures of power: the character’s path rating in a Hekau, and the \ndifficulty of a particular spell or ritual. A path rating of 1 or 2 lets the character \nlearn Basic effects in that Hekau; a path rating of 3 or 4 lets the character to \nlearn Intermediate effects; a path rating of 5 lets the character learn Advanced \neffects. \nEach character begins with three levels of path rating to divide up, one of \nwhich must be in the Hekau that Amenti’s tem-akh specializes in (a rating of \n2 in one Hekau and 1 in another, or 1 each in three Hekau). The character also \nstarts off knowing two Basic spells and two Basic rituals from among the Hekau \nin which he has a rating. A character’s path rating in any Hekau may never be \nhigher than his Balance rating. Note that there are separate experience costs \nfor raising path ratings and learning rituals and spells - \npath rating measures \npotential, but does not automatically convey knowledge of special applications. \nA mummy punished by the Judges of Ma’at may well have her Balance \nrating fall below her current Hekau path ratings. Her path ratings drop \naccordingly, and she must raise them again with experience. She doesn’t have \nto relearn spells and rituals rated too high for her new, reduced condition: She \ndoesn’t forget them, she’s simply unable to apply her knowledge until Balance \nand path rise again. \nCASTING SPELLS \nCasting a spell takes a single action. Make the challenge described for that \nspell; if it succeeds, the effect applies immediately. The Sekhem Traits required \nare spent whether or not the challenge succeeds. \nPERFORMING RITUALS \nRituals take more time. Each Hekau path lists the time required for its \nrituals. Performing one is an extended action and requires concentration. \nInterrupting the ritual to take other actions breaks the process and requires \nstarting over, as does suffering levels ofhealthdamage. Multiple mummies may \ncollaborate on rituals, dividing the Sekhem costs between them. Only one \nmakes the actual challenge, though, and the participants can decide which one \nputs in this culminating effort. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nummy may employ a total number of amulets and effigies equal \nto his Balance rating, plus his Amulets or Effigy path rating, whichever is higher, \nplus any applicable spells. \nPREREQ_UISITES \nSome rituals and spells require more than just the foundations of knowledge \nof a particular Hekau’s effects. There are some “almost Intermediate” effects \nnot available to those who just started studying Hekau, and some “almost \nAdvanced” effects likewise beyond those who’ve just acquired the ability to \nleamhtermediate effects.These effects are noted withapath rating prerequisite \nof 2 or 4, where appropriate. \nHEKAU AND ATTRIBUTES \nSome Hekau paths, such as Alchemy or Amulets, grant effects that can raise \na character’s Attribute Traits into superhuman heights. Such gifts do not come \nwithout a price, though. \nOne important note is that multiple enhancements cannot “stack)) or add \nto the same Attribute simultaneously. If you drink a potion that increases your \nWits-related Traits while wearing an amulet that does the same thing, only the \nhigher bonus applies; the two bonuses merely overlap. On the other hand, keep \ntrack ofwhere your enhancements come from. Returning to the same example, \nif your amulet is lost during combat, you still receive the benefits of your potion \n(until it wears off). The reverse is also true - \nif the potion wears off, your \namulet continues to work. \nAny bonuses gained are figured starting from normal human maximums \n(see Laws of the Hunt), not from current Attribute Trait numbers - \nagain, you \ncannot stack. This also applies to other supernatural or mortal beneficiaries of \nsuch powers. Most supernaturals or mortals cannot make use of many Hekau \nenhancements unless they have a Balance or True Faith rating of 3 or greater. \nMinions of Apophis possess a Corruption rating instead of Balance, which \nallows them to perform dark equivalents of the Hekau described below. No \nHekau can grant more than three bonus Traits to a single Attribute subcategory \n(Strength, Stamina, Appearance, etc.). \nIt is possible for a mummy to gain more permanent Attribute Traits \nbeyond the normal human maximum, but only through exceptional effort on \nbehalf of Ma’at, spending experience, the decision of the judges and the \ndiscretion of the Storyteller. \nALCHEMY \nAlchemy itself is neither a spell nor a ritual; it produces products that \nembody particular effects, or can create the effect in a target. Alchemists \nusually refer to their spells and rituals as formulas and discuss them in terms of \ntheir contents and preparations. An alchemist must spend at least one hour \nworking on a Basic formula, three hours on an Intermediate formula, and five \nhours on an Advanced formula. Once created, the product has a shelf-life of \none year per path level. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n^Alchemy affects only the khat, which is the physical body and its physical \nsubstances. Non-corporeal entities cannot partake of alchemical creations. \nNor can the creations of Alchemy benefit supernatural creatures other than \nmummies, since they draw on the human pattern - \nexcept for poisons, which \ncan work on anything with a body, although some supernatural creatures may \nhave resistance. In theory, one could develop alchemical formulas to work on \nsupernatural beings. This endeavor requires learning separate versions of each \neffect, and the alchemist performs them with an effective path rating of two less \nthan usual. In addition, the Judges of Ma’at frown on aiding enemies of Balance \nwith alchemical creations. \nFORMS OF THE ART \nThe alchemist must decide on the form a product will take before \nbeginning a preparation. Each form carries some advantages and drawbacks. \nSalve: A soft paste or lotion applied to the skin or surface of an object. \nThe individual handling a salve must be careful not to touch it directly, or it \naffects her instead of the intended target. \nEssence: A volatile gas or liquid that evaporates quickly upon exposure \nto the air. The target must inhale it or be caught in its cloud. Many alchemists \nprepare essences as perfumes, smoke or incense. \nPotion: A liquid that the target must drink. The alchemist may mix it \nwith something else, like wine, water or coffee, to mask its distinctive flavor; \nthe target must make a Static Mental Challenge against the alchemist’s path \nrating to detect it. \nPowder: A dehydrated mixture combined with a liquid to create a \npotion, it is burned to create an essence or sprinkled onto something to reach \nthe target. \nGOALS OF ALCHEMY \nAlchemy does not respect the laws of chemistry as understood by modem \nscience. It works on substances in magical ways. For game purposes, each \nalchemical operation has at least one of the following goals: \nIdentification: To understand a thing’s composition is to understand its \nstrengths and weaknesses, and, therefore, to know how to command it. Alchemy \ncan probe at things’ spiritual identities. \nTransmutation: The familiar goal of Alchemy in folklore; the reality as \nthe Amenti practice it is substantially more complex. Particular processes may \npurify a substance, convert it into another, or produce a hybrid result combining \nproperties of several components. \nCatalyzation: These processes use one substance to trigger changes in \nothers, without itself being significantly changed. \nDETERMINING SUCCESS \nAs noted above, Basic formulas take one hour to complete, Intermediate \nformulas take three hours, and Advanced formulas take five hours, which \nresults in one dose of the preparation. Spend one additional Mental Trait per \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDivide the usual time by one, plus the number of Mental Traits spent, down a \nminimum of five minutes for Basic formulas, 15 minutes for Intermediate ones, \nor 45 minutes for Advanced ones. An alchemist who spends two Mental Traits \ncould reduce a basic formula to (60/1+2) or 20 minutes, while an alchemist who \nspends three Mental Traits could reduce an Advanced formula to (300/1+3) or \n75 minutes. \nAny time an alchemist fails in a formula, make two Simple Tests. If both \nfail, there’s something covertly wrong with the results. The Storyteller decides \non the precise nature of the botch, such as reversing healing or other harmful \neffects. Because Alchemy preparations have such a long shelf-life, it’s possible \nthe alchemist may not realize there’s a bad batch sitting on the shelf. Storytellers \nare advised to keep track of bad batches (the better to make mischief with \nthem). \nAlchemy efforts use the Occult Ability for retests unless otherwise noted. \nPoisons use Poisons for retest, while anything healing-related uses Medicine. \nThe Attribute category is Mental, and any challenges are Static Mental, unless \notherwise noted \nDURATION AND RESISTANCE \nThe Egyptians divided the day into three four-hour toris or “seasons,” and \napplied this system to their alchemy and astrology. Alchemical preparations \neither create instant and permanent effects or last for one tori, or four hours. \nMultiple doses extend the duration rather than increasing the effect. \nA target who does not want to experience a preparation’s effect may make \na Static Physical Challenge against the difficulty of the formula, plus one. \nBASIC ALCHEMY \nANALYZE MATERIAL \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nThis spell is not exactly a full-blown magical operation as much as it is the \npractical application of the vast stores of chemical and magical information \navailable to the Amenti. With a successful Mental Challenge and a few \nminutes of study, the alchemist can judge the general composition and age of \nan object under scrutiny, such as the age of a scroll or the durability of a wall. \nSpend an additional Mental Trait to gain increasingly detailed information \nabout the object. \nBLOOD OF THE SNAKE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: None \nThis ritual is typically prepared as a potion or salve. Each dose defends \nagainst poisons for four hours. It can reduce the toxin rating of any poison in \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthe-imbiber’s body (whether it’s already there or is introd \nantidote’s duration) by three. If the toxin rating is reduced to zero, the poison \nhas no effect. If given within one turn of a poison taking effect, Blood of the \nSnake can restore health levels equal to the alchemist’s path rating. \nCLOUD OF SMOKE \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nWith this spell (and a successful Mental Challenge), the alchemist can \ncause any spark to belch a cloud of smoke of about 10 feet in diameter. The \nsmoke is normal in all ways and causes everyone in the area (including the \nalchemist) to suffer penalties for blindness and breathing. This spell takes effect \nimmediately. \nCOBRA SPIT \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 1 \nThis ritual could be a poison, but is actually a nasty acid that causes one \nlevel of aggravateddamage per dose to anything it touches, with the exceptions \nof gold or glass. Against flesh, Cobru Spit can be disfiguring or cause permanent \nharm (such as blindness); it eats through almost anything nonliving. Wise \nalchemists usually store Cobra Spit in gold or glass vials. \nDEUNK OF SEVEN DAYS’ REST \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 4 \nSekhem: None \nThis ritual is usually created as a potion, which relieves fatigue instantly \nwhen drunk. The drinker feels refreshed and alert for four hours, suffering no \npenalties for fatigue until it wears off. However, should the drink come from a \nbad batch, the imbiber suffers an excruciating migraine for the four hours, with \na three-Trait penalty imposed on all challenges due to the symptoms (sensitivity \nto light and noise, nausea, etc.). \nESSENCE OF LONGING \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: None \nThis ritual is created as a perfume, which acts as a mild aphrodisiac on \nthose who smell it. The wearer’s Social Traits increase by four Traits to those \nwho are attracted to the user’s gender. Others may be uncomfortable with \nfeelings they don’t understand or recognize. The best way to simulate the \nessence in a live setting is to apply some scented oil or perfume. Yes, this can \nwork on same- or opposite-sex partners - it is based on the smeller’s \npreference. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nEYES OF THE KA \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: None \nThis salve is applied to the eyes and ears, and allows the user to see across \nthe Shroud into Neter-khertet, or the Shadowlands. This vision is not a perfect \none - \nthe Shadowlands are a ghostly overlay on the living world, and sounds \nare distorted. Ghosts are so used to passing among the living that they may not \nrealize they’re being observed. Eyes of the Ka retests with Thanatology. \nICE OF THE DESERT \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThis spell lets the alchemist change a substance by one step - \na soft solid \nto a liquid, a liquid to a gas, a gas to a liquid, a liquid to a solid. The spell alters \none cubic foot per path rating for the usual duration, and the alchemist must \ntouch the substance. The material may not interfere with a living creature (so \nthe air in a person’s lungs cannot be affected), and it must be part of a single \ncontiguous mass (all the water in a bowl). \nLESSER QUIDDITY \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nAlchemy teaches that each substance has spiritual properties as distinct \nand fundamental as its physical ones. Quiddity, the essence of a thing, responds \nto Sekhem. Once activated, quiddity can flow from one object to another, \ntransferring some of the substance’s properties to the first person to touch it. \nThe grant of spiritual nature lasts for up to one hour, and needs a successful \nMental Challenge to activate. \nThis spell works on the convictions of folklore. Its effects can provide an \nadjustment of one Trait, modify the difficulty of a type of challenge by one \nTrait, or alter health by one health level. While generally small, these effects \nmatter a great deal in some situations, and the player and Storyteller must work \ntogether to define specific effects. \nExamples of common Lesser Quiddity benefits include using willow bark to \nreduce wound penalties by one, using a piece of moss to add one Trait to the \ntarget’s total for survival and orientation challenges, and using a piece of lion’s \nmane to give the target a bonus Trait on Social Challenges involving command \nor courage. The alchemist’s own culture’s folklore, the views and superstitions \nof the vicinity, and Egyptian tradition may all provide inspiration for specific \napplications of this spell. \nMILD POISON \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: None \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThis ritual produces a level 2 lethal toxin (see p. 201). The poison takes \neffect the turn in which it is administered. If the poison coats a weapon, the \npoison damage applies in addition to the weapon's regular damage. The effect \nis permanent, but may be healed as normal. The alchemist may spend an \nadditional Mental Trait to make the poison particularly hard to detect. \nAnyone attempting to notice the poison must win a Static Mental \nChallenge against the alchemist's Mental Trait total. Success lets the observer \nsee the subtle coating, taste a peculiar additive to food, or whatever form it is \nthe poison takes in this case. If the alchemist spent the additional Trait for \nconcealment, add her Balance rating to her Mental Trait total for detection \nchallenges. \nThe judges frown deeply on the use of poison against anyone except \nApophis' most hardened minions. \nPOTION OF RESILIENCE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: None \nWhen applied to a wound, either the alchemist's own or that of someone \nelse, this potioneases the pain anddistractions ofdamage. The target suffers the \nwound penalties of two levels higher, so that a Mauled character would suffer \na one-Trait penalty rather than two Traits, and so on. A target at Incapacitated \ncan act as if Mauled. Note that the wounds themselves must heal as usual: The \nPotion of Resilience deals with some of their consequences but does not cure \nthem. \nREED OF HIDDEN CURRENTS \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nThis spell empowers a piece of hay, straw or grass to function as a sort of \nalchemical litmus test. The alchemist enchants the piece with the power to \ndetect a specific substance, such as iron, water or silver, and tosses the piece into \nthe air or rests it on the surface of a liquid. If the spell (and the Mental Challenge) \nsucceeds, the reed points toward the nearest detectable quantity of the specified \nsubstance, up to a range of one mile if the mummy knows only Basic Alchemy, \nthree miles if he knows Intermediate Alchemy, or five miles if he knows Advanced \nAkhemy. The reed continues to point for one hour, plus one hour for each \nadditional Mental Trait the alchemist spends when enchanting it. \nSIMPLE ELIXIR \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: None \nThis ritual is actually a set of related ones, eachofwhich an alchemist must \nlearn separately. Each of them lets the alchemist prepare a potion (or other \nalchemical form) that adds one Trait to a particular category for four hours. The \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nalchemist must learn each sort of preparation separately - \none for Strength- \nrelated Traits, one for Appearance-related Traits, and so on. The resulting \nelixir is usually, but not always, a potion; potions are generally utilized because \nthey can ensure that the effect goes to the target and no one else. \nSIMPLE PHILTRE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: None \nPhiltres are the stuff of folklore -wine that binds two people as lovers or \ndrives them into hatred, a draught that puts courage in a man or robs him of it. \nA philtre can flood the imbiber with a particular emotion - \nlove, courage, \nhate, fear, etc. Each type of philtre must be learned separately. The drinker is \none Trait down in any test to resist circumstances relating to the philtre's \neffects, such as the drinker of a love potion attempting to resist a Social \nChallenge to seduce him. \nSIMPLE TONIC \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: None \nA tonic is meant to heal damage, whether as a potion or salve. It restores \none health level of bashing or lethal damage. The effect is permanent. \nSPARKOF RA \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nWith a few words, a successful Mental Challenge and some nonliving \nflammable material (paper, clothing, wood), the alchemist can spark a fire. The \nsize of the fire depends on the amount of fuel available and how many Mental \nTraits the alchemist wishes to add to the effort. Those caught by the flames are \nburned as normal - \nfire inflicts aggravated damage. \nSTASIS \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThis spell causes a nonliving thing to become resistant to outside changes. \nStasis works only on asingle piece no greater than the Amenti's own body mass, \nand adds one bonus Trait per path rating to resist outside efforts to act on it. A \npiece of wood becomes harder to bum, or a stone statue is less affected by \nvandals. The effect lasts for one scene and uses a Mental Challenge \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nINTERMEDIATE ALCHEMY \nASHES TO ASHES \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 3 \nThis spell is a more powerful version of Ice of the Desert. Any human-sized \nportion of material the alchemist touches may be changed instantly and \npermanently. The change must be something that can occur in nature - \nstones turn to dust, wood turns to ash, corpses become tomb dust, and so on. \nThis requires a Mental Challenge. \nCOMPLEX ELIXIR \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 1 \nComplex Elixir is simply a more powerful version of the Simple Elixir, except \nthat it can add two Traits to a category for the duration. In all other respects, \nit is no different than Simple Elixir. \nCOMPLEX PHILTRE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 1 \nComplex Philtre is more powerful than its simple-version cousin. It bestows \na two-Trait penalty to resist challenges relating to the philtre’s effects, but \notherwise acts like Simple Philtre. \nCOMPLEX TONIC \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 1 \nA Complex Tonic can heat three levels of bashing or lethal damage from \ndisease or injury, but otherwise acts like Simple Tonic. \nDANGEROUS POISON \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 1 \nADungerous Poison creates a brew with a level 5 toxin rating per dose. This \nlevel of Alchemy represents not only the knowledge of creating poisons, but \nalso the means of delivery and concealment. Even if the subject manages to \nresist the poison’s effects, he still suffers a level of bashing damage. Dangerous \nPoison otherwise functions like Mild Poison. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nGREATER QUIDDITY \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 2 \nThis spell bestows the same effect as Lesser Quiddity, but the shared \nmystical properties are stronger. It can make an Attribute adjustment by three \nTraits, modify the difficulty of a challenge by three Traits, or alter health by \nthree health levels. A successful Mental Challenge is necessary for this spell. \nONE-HUNDRED-THOUSAND TONGUES \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: None \nThis potion enables the imbiber to speak and understand any spoken \nlanguage for four hours. If prepared as a salve, it can be applied to the ears and \nmouth for the same effect, or to the hands and eyes to allow use and \ncomprehension of Braille or sign language. This unusual brew uses Linguistics \nfor its retests. \nPANACEA \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 4 \nThis ritual produces a potion that can cure any illness with a toxin rating \nup to the sum of the alchemist’s Medicine and Alchemy Traits. It does not heal \nany wounds caused by the illness, just the disease itself. \nPHILOSOPHER’S STONE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 9 \nSekhem: 3 \nThis preparation creates a powder that congeals into a solid pebblelike \nform. When applied to a base metal, a dose glows briefly and transforms up to \ntwo ounces of the metal to pure gold or silver. The change is permanent, and \nthe dose dissipates. \nPOTION OF THE SEPARABLE KA \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 3 \nThis potion puts the user into a trance in which her soul can separate itself \nfrom the body and travel astrally. No longer confined to the physical plane, the \nmummy can project her senses and awareness outside of her body. Her \nconsciousness roams various planes of thought, allowing her to view areas all \nover the world as an incorporeal spirit. Without the concerns of mass and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nof thought to any place on Earth, under the orbit of the moon. \nWhile under the effects of the potion, the khat lies in a comatose state, \nunaware of its surroundings. The ka does not tire from travel, nor is it hindered \nor injured by the material world. However, the kacanstill sense its surroundings \nnormally, and even use powers that function in h a t .  The ka remains tied to \nthe khat through the khu- a sort of psychic tether that keeps the mummy from \nbecoming lost in the realms of spirit. \nBy expending a Willpower Trait, the mummy can manifest for a single turn \nas an intangible apparition, allowing her to be seen and to speak audibly. While \nvisible, the mummy appears as an idealized form of herself, complete with \nprojected trappings, though real-world physical possessions do not travel in spirit \nform. Even while visible, the ka is intangible and thus immune to injury from \nconventional sources like claws, fire, sunlight and mundane weapons (although \nthe khat can still be harmed). The ka may not possess other bodies in this form, \neven if it has spells and rituals that would otherwise allow it to do so. \nThe mummy may deal normally with other astral forms that she encounters. \nShe may even attempt to injure other astral travelers by attacking their khu \n(which appears as a silver cord). Such astral combat uses Mental Challenges, \nwith damage causing the opponent to lose Willpower Traits. Once an astral \ncombatant runs out of Willpower Traits, his silver cord snaps, stranding him in \nthe spirit realms. From there, the spirit may accidentally wander deeper into \nother worlds, or he may stumble about until he finds a way to return to his body. \nSome spirits thus trapped never return, as they are captured or devoured by \nmonstrous entities that now prowl h a t  in the wake of the Dja-akh. \nThe spirit can travel only in the Shadowlands with this ritual. If the user’s \nconsciousness is still out of her body when the potion wears off, the khu pulls \nher back at once, and she must make a Physical Challenge to avoid a level of \nbashing damage from shock. \nPOTION OF VALOR \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 1 \nThis preparation is a more powerful form of the Potion of Resilience, \nreducing wound penalties by four levels instead of two. It also gives the user two \ntemporary health levels below Incapacitated, which postpone death and allow \nher limited mobility. This extra resilience lasts only until the potion wears off. \nSALTS OF THE DEAD \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThis spell draws on the Egyptian traditions for preparing corpses to resist \nharm. The alchemist touches a bit of salt and speaks a few protective words. \nWith a successful Mental Challenge, for one turn per Balance Trait, he can \nignore any damage that affects only the living -poison gas, for instance, but \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nnot stab wounds. All damage the alchemist suffers while the spell lasts is \nreduced by one health level, to a minimum of one level per wound. The salt \nused in this spell blackens and becomes useless for any other purpose when the \nspell takes effect. \nTEARS OF ISIS \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: 2, plus amount invested \nThis ritual lets the alchemist create potions that store Sekhem for future \nuse. Decide the amount of Sekhem that the potion should hold, and spend that \nalong with the two Sekhem that the ritual itself requires. Success stores the \namount spent for storage. Consuming the potion gives the drinker all of the \nstored temporary Sekhem Traits, even if it raises his curtent score above his \nusual maximum. These added Traits are always spent first, and any that remain \nunspent when the potion wears off are lost. An individual may derive benefit \nfrom just one Tears of Isis potion at a time. \nADVANCED ALCHEMY \nCATALYST CRUCIBLE \nType: Spell \nSekhem: Special \nThis spell transforms the alchemist's body into a living catalyst. Any \nsubstance he touches or consumes can become transformed into any preparation \nhe knows how to make. He can only make one dose of one preparation per use \nof this spell, and must spend the Sekhem the transformation normally requites. \nThe spell itself takes effect immediately, as does the transformation, so that (for \ninstance) a mummy who's subjected to a Deadly Poison could cast Catalyst \nCrucible and transform it into a Simple Tonic before it kills him. This spell \nrequires a Mental Challenge. \nDEADLY POISON \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 2 \nThis preparation creates a poison with a lethal toxin rating of 7 per dose. \nThe subject suffers three levels of bashing damage even with a successful \nchallenge to resist it. The alchemist may spend two additional Sekhem to make \nthe poison inflict aggravated damage. In other regards, this formula works like \nMild Poison. \nDUST TO DUST \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 2 + potential level of damage \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n.. . \nWith this spell, the mummy returns her target to the eart \nlife is said to spring. First she touches her target (which may require a Physical \nChallenge), then she spends the Sekhemrequired for the spell. Next she spends \nan additional amount of Sekhem equal to the amount of damage she hopes to \ninflict, and makes a Mental Challenge. Success grants her one level of \naggravated damage for each Sekhem she spent for damage. The spell also \ntransmutes wounded flesh into blacksoil. This unusual spell calls for Thanatology \nfor any retests. \nFLESH OF THE GODS \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 3 \nThe alchemist applies gold dust to her flesh (or another’s) and whispers \nprayers to achieve a divine state, then makes a Mental Challenge - \nwith \nsuccess, her flesh and spirit absorb the gold’s essence, gaining magical protection \nfor one scene. Success grants her three retests for Social Challenges (the second \nresults stand, whether or not they improve on the first). Any retests she does \nnot use disappear as do the gold flakes from her skin at the end of the scene. This \nspell calls for Thanatology for its retests. \nPOTENT ELIXIR \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 2 \nThe Potent Elixir is significantly more powerful than its lower-powered \nversions. The elixir can grant three Traits to any Attribute sub-category (i.e., \nStrength, Appearance, Wits). \nPOTENT PHILTRE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 2 \nPotent Philtre works exactly like its counterparts, except it adds a three- \nTrait penalty to resist challenges to its effects. \nPOTENT TONIC \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 2 \nPotent Tonic indeed lives up to its name, healing up to five levels of bashing \nor lethal damage, but otherwise works like Simple Tonic. \nPOTION OF THE DIVINE \nType: Ritual \nTraits: 6 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSekhem: 3 \nThis ritual is a stronger version of the Intermediate Alchemy ritual Potion \nofValor. The user of the Potion ofthe Divine suffers no wound penalties whatever \nher level of injury, and receives three temporary health levels below Incapacitated \nto forestall death and allow limited mobility. She can still die if she suffers \nenough damage to work through all those levels, and whatever wounds she \nincurs take full effect when the potion wears off. Anyone severely damaged \nmust receive medical attention (normal or magical) before then to avoid \nimmediate death when the potion’s benefits expire. \nPOTION OF THE Y ILE BODY \nType: Ritual \nTraits: 7 \nSekhem: 5 \nThis ritual produces a potion that immunizes the user against all forms of \npoison and transforms her body’s fluids into toxins. The target’s excreted bodily \nfluids all act as contact poisons of lethal toxin rating 5. She can spit venomous \nsaliva, cry poisonous tears, and even exhale poison gas that requires a victim \nwithin a yard to make a Physical Challenge or suffer one level of bashing \ndamage. These fluids inflict two levels of damage automatically on nonliving \nmaterials. \nAny vampire who drinks the user’s blood takes two levels of aggravated \ndamage per Blood Trait. Anyone who cuts or stabs the user must make a \nPhysical Challenge against the user to avoid taking as many levels of lethal \ndamage as he inflicted. An attacker who draws blood with natural weapons like \nclaws or teeth takes this damage automatically, and material weapons \nautomatically corrode. \nThe ritual lets the user summon up five “doses” of venom - \none dose is \nenough fluid to inflict damage. Unspent doses are lost; the defensive effects of \nthis ritual continue to apply even after all the doses are used up, until the \npotion’s four-hour duration ends. \nAMULETS \nAn amulet can be any small magical item: a piece of jewelry, a charmed \ncoin or other token, a slip of paper or papyrus inscribed with a spell, even a \nsymbol painted on one’s body. The magic of Hekau doesn’t make the amulet \nany more durable than usual, so the crafter must consider how long she expects \nit to remain in use. \nFirst make a Static Physical Challenge against five Traits to make the item \nitself, retesting withcrafts. The time it takes to inscribe the symbols determines \nhow long it takes to complete the process. Symbols painted on skin require five \nminutes for Basic effects, 15 minutes for Intermediate effects, or 25 minutes for \nAdvanced effects; the results last only until they’re washed off. More permanent \neffects (such as physical items) take one day for Basic effects, three days for \nIntermediate effects, or five days for Advanced effects, with breaks only to \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsleep, eat and meditate to recover Sekhem. The artisan does not need to craft \nthe item to be enchanted himself, though it’s customary to do so. \nOnce it’s inscribed, the amulet retains its enchantment for (Balance + \nAmukts path rating) months. The artisan may repeat the initial challenge to \nextend the effect; this requires only as long as painting on symbols would, but \nthe full Sekhem cost must still be paid. If the enchantment lapses, the entire \nritual must be performed again. \nObservers may make a Mental Challenge (retest with Awareness) to \nnotice a slight mystical aura around the wearer of an amulet. Observers with the \nOccult Ability may make a Mental Challenge to discover the item’s purpose or \ngeneral power level. If the amulet is designed to protect the wearer against \nscrying, the effect extends to anything on her person, including the amulet \nitself. \nWearing an amulet generally suffices to get the benefits of it. The \nalchemist may choose to personalize it with the appropriate rituals described \nbelow. Unless otherwise noted, amulets work for any natural-living creature \nand for mummies, but not for other supernatural beings or non-corporeal \nentities. \nAmulets in use, unless otherwise specified, retest with Occult. Their \ncreation requires a Static Physical Challenge (unless otherwise specified), and \ntheir Attribute category is Physical. \nWARDS \nWards make it more difficult to damage the wearer. Add the crafter’s path \nrating to the wearer’s Trait total for defensive purposes. When an effect aimed \nat the wearer has variable benefits based on Traits spent, each level of the ward \nrating negates one Trait spent. The wearer may load up with all the amulets he \nlikes, but only one applies a defensive benefit in any particular challenge. \nDESTROYING AN AMULET \nOne level of bashing or lethal damage breaks an amulet made of glass or \nplastic. Two levels break an amulet of wood or bone. Three levels destroy one \nmade of metal or stone. One level of aggravated damage destroys any amulet. \nThe attack must target the amulet specifically, which means that the \nattacker must know that the amulet is there and that it’s worth attacking. \nBASIC AMULETS \nAMULET OF CLOUD WALKING \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: 12 \nThis amulet lifts the wearer up to the level of clouds, or where clouds would \nbe if the sky is clear at the moment, and allows him to walk through the air. \nCloud heights vary depending on local conditions, but 10,000 feet above sea \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nlevel is common. Here the air is thin, but still dense enough to allow safe \nbreathing. \nAscending to the clouds takes a few minutes. Walking at that level \nproceeds at about normal speed. Once the wearer reaches his destination, he \nsinks gently to the ground and the amulet deactivates. \nAnyone can wear and use the amulet once it’s activated, though only an \nartisan who understands the Amulets Hekau can activate it, by holding it \nbetween her hands and making a Social Challenge. (This can work even when \nsomeone else is currently wearing the amulet). The same requirements apply \nto efforts to deactivate the amulet while it’s in use - \nwhich leave the wearer \nfalling. \nASHEN SHROUD \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nThe artisan chants the appropriate words of power while applying dirt or \nash to his face, and he takes on a deathlike appearance with a successful \nPhysical Challenge. He resembles the archetypal walking dead, incapable of \nlife but moving nonetheless. All mortals who see him are subject to confused \npanic, as per the Veil. This spell has no effect on other supernatural beings, and \ncalls on Thanatology for its retests. \nEYES OF THE HORIZON \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nThis spell links the image of an eye to the artisan’s own senses. The eye can \nbe anything from a painting on a tomb wall to a plastic doll’s eye or an eye \nsketched on a napkin. After creating the eye and making a successful Physical \nChallenge, the artisan can see what that eye sees as easily as with his own until \nthe next sunset, as long as he’s within the curve of the horizon (about 12 miles \nat sea level). Moving farther away breaks the spell. \nLESSER TALISMAN \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: 8 \nA Lesser Talisman gives the wearer one bonus Trait in one of the Attribute \ncategories as long as she wears it. This boost is not cumulative with any other \nHekau effects; only the strongest enhancement applies. The artisan must learn \na separate ritual for each Attribute. This ritual retests with Crafts. \nLESSER WARD \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 10 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nPath Rating: 2 \nA Lesser Ward provides a ward rating of two, and is otherwise identical to \na Simple Ward. Note that an artisan must first learn to make Simple Wards before \nacquiring this ritual. Lesser Ward retests with Crafts. \nPRAYER OF THE AKEN \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nAken are the Egyptian boatmen who assist Anubis in directing the dead \nto their proper places in the Underworld. A mummy who utters this prayer and \nmakes a successful Mental Challenge while in h a t  summons one of the \nsurviving Aken to his side; it protects him from harm and transports him to an \nappropriate destination in the Underworld. The Aken arrives sometime within \nthe next couple of hours, depending on the conditions in that part of the \nUnderworld; the artisan may spend a Mental Trait to guarantee an arrival \nwithin (15 minus Balance) minutes. The artisan must have a written copy of \nthis prayer available, either on his person or somewhere he can see it, including \nacross the Shroud in a tomb, on a card in his corpse's position, and so on. \nSCARAB OF LIFE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: 10 \nA living person wearing a Scarab of Life gains a ward rating of two against \nanything that would reduce her Physical Traits. When placed on a mummy's \ncorpse, the amulet gives the mummy three bonus Traits for the resurrection \nchallenge. This ritual retests with Thanatology. \nSIMPLE WARD \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: 5 \nThis ritual is actually a set of similar rituals, each of which the artisan must \nlearn separately. Each protects the wearer from a particular kind of harm, or \nshielding particular parts of the body; others resist a particular type of magic. \nCommon examples include the following: \nHeart (ab): This ward protects the heart. Since ancient Egyptians \nregarded the heart as the seat of consciousness, it protects both the physical \norgan and the mind against illusions, efforts at mental control, and the like. \nName (ren): This ward repels Nomenclature Hekau that affects the user \nthrough her true name; it is always attuned to a single user. \nEye of Horus (udjat): This ward repels magic that affects the user's health, \nincluding poisons and spells that harm the body as a whole. \nStorytellers and players are encouraged to work together to develop more \nsuch wards. Simple Ward retests with Crafts. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n\" \n. . \n,  \" . .-,, \n- \n. .  . .  \nWARDING SIGN \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nSome wards have no physical component beyond a gesture. They don't last \nlong, but they can be useful nonetheless. This ward is one such, to guard against \nbad luck. If the Physical Challenge succeeds, the user can make a single retest \non one failed challenge and choose which results stand. An individual may \nonly have one Warding Sign active at a time, and it lasts for one hour. \nWOOD WARD \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: 10 \nAn amulet made with this ritual protects the wearer from all wooden \nobjects. They bounce off his skin, or shatter if particularly fragile. The wearer \nautomatically negates one level of bashing or lethal damage from wooden \nobjects if the maker has Basic Amukts, three levels if the maker knows \nIntermediate Amulets, or five levels if the maker knows Advanced Amukts. \nThe same bonus applies to levels of damage the wearer inflicts on wooden \nobjects when smashing them with his hands or body. Note that this applies \neven to casual contact, which means that nothing wood is safe around the \nwearer. Nature-spirits often regard the use of this amulet as a hostile act. This \nritual retests with Crafts. \nINTERMEDIATE AMULETS \nEBON BINDING \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 15 \nThis ritual enchants a length of bandage, which, when wrapped around a \nbody, prevents the soul from entering or departing. If the soul is currently \nwithin the khat, it cannot leave; if the soul is currently departed, it cannot \nreturn. The binding lasts as long as the bandage remains in place. This ritual \nretests with Thanatology. \nEYE OF SEKHMET \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 2 \nThis spell invokes the goddess Sekhmet, who served as the instrument by \nwhich Ra's enemies were destroyed. The artisan traces the symbol of the eye of \njustice over his own eye and casts the spell (along with a Physical Challenge), \nand can afflict a target with Sekhmet's judgment. The victim suffers a two-Trait \npenalty to all challenges and heals more slowly- as if he were two levels more \nseriously wounded if the victim is mortal, or requiring twice the usual time and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\neffort to regain health levels if the victim is supernatural. The spell lasts for one \nhour, or longer if the artisan spends Mental Traits: one day with one additional \nTrait, one week with two additional Traits, one month with three additional \nTraits, or six months with four additional Traits. \nGEB’S BLESSING \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 50 \nThis ritual calls on Geb, father of Osiris, for protection from the natural \nelements. The amulet protects its wearer from rain, sleet, hail, extremes of \ntemperature and the like. The only natural forces that can harm the wearer are \nthose that deliver aggravated damage, like lightning and lava. This protection \nalso applies to natural weather effects created magically or artificially. The \nwearer does have to deal with the secondary problems of hostile natural forces: \na landslide or a flash flood won’t kill him outright, but they can bury him and \nrequire him to dig his way out. And while he won’t die of sunstroke in the \ndesert, his body continues to need water as usual. The wearer gets bonus Traits \non survival-related challenges based on the artisan’s Amulets Hekau rating: \nthree bonus Traits if the maker knows Intermediate Amulets, or five if the \nmaker knows Advanced Amulets. The wearer can therefore dig out of a \nlandslide, stay afloat in raging torrents, and persist despite thirst more easily, \nand so on. This powerful amulet requires Survival for its retests. \nGREATER TALISMAN \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 30 \nA Greater Talisman gives its wearer two bonus Traits in one Attribute \ncategory, and others function just like a Lesser Talisman. It requires Crafts for \nretests. \nGREATER VEIL OF AMAUNET \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 50 \nPath Rating: 4 \nThe Greater Veil of Amaunet functions like the Veil ofAmaunet (which the \nartisan must first learn how to make) but more powerfully. It makes the wearer \nundetectable to the senses of any living being (all physical senses - \nsmell, \ntaste, sight, touch, hearing -whether or not they’re supernaturally enhanced), \nand to the senses of beings like vampires in unlife or mockery of life. The \nGreater Veil does not affect the walking dead or non-corporeal entities, nor does \nit interfere with powers that pierce invisibility. In all other respects, it works \nlike the Veil of Amaunet. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nGREATER WARD \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 40 \nPath Rating: 4 \nA Greater Ward provides a ward rating of 4, and is otherwise identical to \na Simple Ward. Note that this is only available to those who have learned to \nmake Major Wards. Greater Ward uses Crafts in its retests. \nMAJORWARD \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 18 \nMajor Wa~ds \nbehave just like Minor Wards except that they provide award \nrating of 3. They require Crafts for retests during their creation. \nMETAL WARD \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 18 \nThis ritual creates an amulet similar to the Wood Ward. Metal objects \ntouching the wearer become soft, pliable or crumbly. The wearer automatically \nnegates three levels of bashing or lethal damage from metal objects if the \ncreator knows Intermediate Amulets, or five levels if the creator knows \nAdvanced Amulets. The wearer gains the same number of additional Strength- \nrelatedTraits for challenges involving deflecting, harming or otherwise dealing \nwith metal objects through direct physical forces. As with Wood Ward, this \napplies even to casual contact. Small pieces of metal, like coins and zippers \nseparated by clothing from the wearer, vibrate uncomfortably. Nature-spirits \noften find this ward as unfriendly as the Wood Ward. This ritual requires Crafts \nfor retests during its making. \nSIGN OF LUCK \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nThis spell draws on countless small superstitious conventions to improve \none’s fortune. With a successful Physical Challenge, the wearer gains a bonus \nTrait to use in a single challenge however he likes (comparing on ties, spent on \nan overbid, etc.), sometime within the next hour. An individual may only \nbenefit from one application of this spell at a time. \nVEIL OF AMAUNET \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 20 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThis amulet calls on Amaunet, the goddess of invisibility. It makes the \nwearer undetectable to all senses that animals possess. Supernatural creatures \nmay make a Mental Challenge to notice a dim haze, if they have the benefit of \nsupernaturally heightened senses. The wearer must concentrate for one turn \nand make a Mental Challenge to activate the amulet; it remains active for one \nhour. Anyone who knows Amukts Hekau may touch the amulet and make the \nsame challenge to activate or deactivate it. \nWRAPPINGS OF IMHOTEP \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThis spell enchants bandages or other coverings that can be applied to \nwounds, from sterile dressings to paper towels, with a successful Physical \nChallenge. The bandages heal one level of lethal damage or two levels of \nbashing damage per Balance Trait that the artisan possesses. As long as the \nbandages remain on the wound, the target heals as if the wound were one level \nless severe. Separate bandages may be applied to multiple wounds, but they do \nnot increase the healing bonus any further. The healing bonus does apply to \naggravated damage, though the bandages do not immediately heal such \ndamage. The bandages lose their enchantment upon being changed or when \nsomeone tries to reuse them. The Wrappings of Imhotep call for Medicine to be \nused in their creation. \nADVANCED AMULETS \nBUCKLE OF ISIS \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 80 \nThis ritual produces an amulet in the shape of an ankh, or rather in the \nsandal-strap shape that inspired the ankh. The buckle protects its wearer with \na ward rating of 5 against all hostile magic, whether Hekau, hedge or Sphere \nmagic of living mages, vampiric Thaumaturgy or other sources. The amulet \nitself is physically fragile and easily damaged. \nPRINCELY TALISMAN \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 75 \nA Princely Talisman behaves like a Lesser Talisman except that it grants \nthree bonus Traits in one Attribute category. Crafts is necessary for retests in \nits creation. \nPRINCELY WARD \nType: Ritual \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 80 \nA Princely Ward behaves like a Simple Ward except that it provides a ward \nrating of 5. It uses Crafts for its retest. \nSCARAB OF DEATH \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 50 \nThis ritual protects an amulet which, although itself physical, protects the \nwearer’s soul while in the spirit world. Any damage that the spirit suffers is \nredirected to the wearer’s physical body. No other amulets provide protection \nfor the spirit, but they reduce damage to the body as usual; a careful mummy can \narrange to withstand a great deal of damage. Once the body reaches Dust, \nattacks on the soul deal normal damage directly. The Scarab uses Crafts in \nretests. \nWARD OF PERMANENCE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 100 + relevant ritual \nThe artisan inscribes this ward on an amulet to make its effect permanent. \nThe Ward of Permanence usually goes on the reverse side of the amulet when \nthe artisan creates or reinfuses some other ritual. Add the time and costs of the \nWard of Pemnence to those of the other ritual to determine the total \nrequirements, Unless the amulet is physically destroyed, the ritual secured with \nthis ward remains in effect for all eternity. \nThe amulet can also absorb physical damage based on the path rating of \nthe primary ritual. The amulet can neutralize, each hour, one level of damage \nif the primary ritual is Basic, three levels if Intermediate, or five if Advanced. \nThis applies only to damage directed at the amulet; the wearer is on her own. \nMost ofthe handful ofartifacts surviving fromEgyptiandynastic times owe \ntheir preservation to this ritual. This ritual uses Crafts during retests. \nWRAPPINGS OF OSIRIS \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 2 \nThis spell is a more powerful version of the Wrappings oflmhotep, drawing \non Osiris’ greater power over life and death. With a successful Physical \nChallenge to enchant the bandages, the wrappings heal one level of damage per \nsuccess. This does include aggravated damage, which the spell heals first. As \nlong as the wrapping remains in place, the injury heals as if it were three levels \nless severe. The Wrappings use Medicine in their creation. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCELESTIAL \nAll heavenly bodies have significance in Egyptian magic, and they all \ninteract in complex ways. Magic drawing on their power can affect great areas, \nas described below. In some ways, this Hekau has wider-ranging consequences \nthan any other single art, short of archmages’ mastery of Sphere power. \nCelestial rituals requires one hour for Basic effects, three hours for \nIntermediate effects, and five hours for Advanced effects. The mummy can \nperform it anywhere there’s a modicum of quiet; these rituals call for no \nlaboratory or elaborate props. Celestial spells generally work within five \nminutes of casting. \nCelestial magic generally retests with Occult, unless specified otherwise, \nrituals use Static Mental Challenges, and the Attribute category is Mental. \nROLEPLAY ING WEATHER \nCelestial magic is easy to abuse. Storytellers must keep careful track of \nchanges unleashed with it, particularly when two or more groups share a \ncommon chronicle background. The Storyteller should reward detailed, nuanced \ndescriptions, and players who say “it’s windy” may find that they don’t get \neverything they want. Note too that it takes time for conditions to change, \ngiving warning to most people in the vicinity, and that it takes time for \npreexisting conditions to return. Though unnatural in origin, once they’re \nthere, the effects of weather magic behave as if they had arisen naturally. \nBASIC CELESTIAL \nBASIC WEATHER MAGIC \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Varies \nSekhem: Varies \nThis ritual lets the celestine conjure small, sudden disturbances in the \nlocal weather. These changes aren’t strong enough to inflict damage, but they \ncan make an area more or less comfortable. Assuming the mummy starts with \na typical summer day in a temperate climate - \nmid-80s F, mild humidity, \nnegligible cloud cover over a small village - \nsome effects could include: \nFog - \nA low-lying cloud that has settled to Earth, impairing sight and \nmuffling sound. It can interfere with ranged attacks and sight beyond 100 yards \n(more if the Storyteller deems appropriate). \nLight breeze - \nA gentle wind just strong enough to ruffle hair and \ndissipate odors. \nMinor temperature change - A slight shift in the local ambient \ntemperature, no more than 10 degrees up or down. \nFor more variations and effects, see the weather chart. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nise. She may make an additional Mental Challenge to pierce \nsupernatural concealment. The Book of Thoth retests with Divination. \nGRIP THE WATER \nType: Ritual \nTraits: 6 \nSekhem: 2 \nThe mummy moves her hands in concentric circles over a body of water \nand makes it rise or fall as if lifted by the tide. Ponds and streams rise a few feet, \nwhile the change in an ocean is usually imperceptible to the human eye. This \nchange can move water into new channels, with corresponding consequences. \nWhile it can’t create effects like a flood of Biblical proportions or parting the \nRed Sea, Grip the Water can cause a dam to overflow, irrigation canals to flood \nlow-lying terrain or drown crops) or possibly change the course of a river. The \nStoryteller shouldn’t downplay it - \nthis is a powerful and simple transformation. \nHANGING THE STARS \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Varies \nSekhem: Special \nThis ritual lets a mummy hold some other ritual in abeyance, tuned to \ncelestial events and waiting for its trigger. First perform this ritual with a \ndifficulty equal to that of the “hung” ritual, along with spending any Sekhem. \nIf Hanging the Stars succeeds, a delay of up to one day per success can be applied \nto whatever ritual the mummy goes on to perform next. Activating the hung \nritual requires spending one Sekhem and making a Mental Challenge. Success \nactivates the delayed Hekau that turn as if it were a standard one-turn spell \neffect; failure dissipates it without result. \nThe mummy may delay any ritual he knows, but only one at a time. \nHanging the Stars must be performed in full view of the sky, at any hour of the \nday or night. \nHIDING THE STARS \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 5 \nSekhem: None \nThis spell hides the mummy from celestial forces. Add the celestine’s \nBalance Traits to the difficulty of any challenge attempting to locate the target \nor analyze it by divination. Hiding the Stars can also conceal a chosen target, \nalthough the target must be present during the whole ritual. A target is \nprotected by only one working of this ritual at a time; the most recent result \nalways applies. Efforts to divine the mummy or other target’s whereabouts \nerode this, however - \nafter three attempted divinations or the end of four \nhours (whichever comes first), the protective veil is lifted and scryings against \nthe mummy or other target proceed as normal. This ritual retests with the \nDivination Ability. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n&AD THE STARS \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Special \nSekhem: None \nThis ritual lets the celestine gain insights from the heavens into others’ \nsecrets and auspicious aspects of the current situation. After succeeding in a \nRead the Stars challenge, make a Static Mentalchallenge (retest withDivination) \nagainst the difficulty of any other one Hekau effect. If this second challenge \nsucceeds, the celestine gains one bonus Trait, plus an additional bonus Trait per \nMental Trait spent, for use in attempting that effect. At the Storyteller’s \ndiscretion, the stars may also indicate a particular time or place at which to \nattempt the other effect, and if the celestine goes there, he enjoys an additional \nbonus Trait for the relevant challenge. Favored places and times should relate \nto the mood of the effect - \na library for a search for wisdom, for instance, or \nthe new moon in agraveyardfor an effect relating to death and the Underworld. \nIf either the Read the Stars challenge or the ensuing challenge fails, make \ntwo Simple Tests. If both fail, the mummy gravely misinterprets the omens, and \nsuffers a one-Trait penalty on the target Hekau effect. Read the Stars retests with \nthe Divination Ability. \nSAHU-RA \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThis spell gives the celestine the mantle of Ra, the sun god, full of radiant \nimpressiveness, with a successful Social Challenge. The celestine using the \nSahu-Ra glows with the radiance of soft, natural sunlight for one turn, plus an \nadditional turn per Social Trait spent. This light extends only a few feet from \nthe mummy and functions like normal sunlight - \nilluminating dark places, \ninjuring vampires, and so on. (Vampires suffer one level of aggravated damage \nfor each turn that they’re caught within the radiance.) \nWEATHER SIGHT \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nThis spell lets the mummy understand the weather’s developing conditions, \nand thereby accurately predicts its future changes over the next few days, up to \none day per Balance Trait. In addition, the mummy can draw on the wind’s \nimpressions of the world passing by. A successful Mental Challenge gives the \nmummy a general sense of the terrain and evidence of approaching individuals. \nBy spending an additional Mental Trait, the mummy can learn the distance \nand number of targets and get a detailed sense of the intervening land between \nthem. By spending two additional Mental Traits, the mummy can learn the \ngenders and the carried equipment of those approaching. This spell cannot \nwork downwind, though other weather magic can shift the wind to a useful \ndirection. This spell retests with Divination. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nWEATHER WHISPERS \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nThis spell does for sound what Weather Sight does for images. With a \nsuccessful Mental Challenge, the mummy (and the mummy alone) hears \nvoices carried on the wind sorted into conversations. An additional Mental \nChallenge lets him make sense out of the distinct exchanges, along with \nbackground mumbles and extraneous noise; spend a second Mental Trait to \nresolve jumbled and fragmentary interactions as well. This effect covers a small \narea and lasts for one hour. This spell only carries sounds from upwind, \nalthough other weather magic can shift the wind’s direction. Weather Whispers \nretests with Divination. \nINTERMEDIATE CELESTIAL \nCALL THE STARS \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 2 \nThe celestine calls on celestial forces, invoking the goddess Nuit for divine \nintervention. At the conclusion of the ritual, if successful, meteors fall. They \nare golf-ball sized, but move rapidly, doing one level of aggravateddamage each \nturn to anyone in the area. The fall can cover any area up to the size of a small \ntown, at the celestine’s preference, and lasts for one minute per Balance Trait. \nIn addition to inflicting aggravated damage on anyone or anything unlucky \nenough to be caught in the storm, the meteors can start fires, shatter fragile \nobjects and damage others. \nDIVINE FORMS \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThe celestine composes a short prayer to any one deity of the Egyptian \npantheon, inviting him, her or it to manifest within herself. (Scholars argue as \nto whether the answering force is actually divine or not, but the effects work \nthe same, regardless of what any given mummy thinks about it.) The mummy \ntakes on some key feature of the petitioned god, adding one bonus Trait to a \nrelevant Attribute (or two, if she spends an additional Mental Trait). Geb, the \ngod of the earth, might raise the mummy’s Stamina-related total, while Hathor \nmight raise Dexterity or Charisma. (See p. XX for a description of major \nEgyptian deities.) The effect lasts for one hour and is not cumulative - \nonly \none bonus of this sort may apply, and only the strongest enhancing Hekau of \nall available possible additions applies. Divine Forms uses Meditation for its \nretests. \nINTERMEDIATE WEATHER MAGIC \nType: Ritual \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n.\nA\n” Difficulty: Special \nSekhem: Special \nThe practitioner of lntewnediate Weather Magic can command dramatic \nanddangerous changes in the weather, as well as prolonging existing conditions. \nSee the chart on p. 143 for the full range of possibilities. Common applications \ninclude: \nDesert wind - \nA dry, searing wind with gusts up to 60 miles per hour, \nwhich can interfere with any ranged attacks, kick up debris that causes vision \npenalties, and cause people to have trouble standing up. \nDriving rains - \nThey interfere with driving or Perception-related \nchallenges. \nLightning strikes - \nEach bolt inflicts 10 levels of lethal damage on a \nstrike, and five levels of lethal damage on anything within one yard. \nSnowstorm - \nBesides risking penalties on things like visual challenges \nor driving, anyone caught in the elements suffers one level of bashing damage \neach hour from the cold. \nThunderstorm -As with snowstorm, but without the risk of frostbite \nand other cold-related effects. \nRA’S AWAKENING \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 2 \nThe experience of greeting the rising sun is a potent one for mummies. \nThis spell lets the celestine re-create it in up to five people within her line of \nsight. She waves one hand in a rising arc (followed with a Mental Challenge), \nand if the spell succeeds, each of her chosen targets feels a growing warmth as \nif dawn were creeping up on her. Fatigue flees living beings, as if they’d had a \nfull night’s sleep. For the next hour, the targets receive a one-Trait bonus on \nall mental tasks, and wound penalties are halved (rounded down) for the same \ntime. \nThe subjects also feel Ra’s spiritual scrutiny. People who believe themselves \nto be caring, generous and honest receive a positive acknowledgment of their \nstrengths and efforts, while those who feel guilty about their morals experience \na fresh load of guilt. Mummies may make Balance Challenges against seven \nTraits, with success restoring one Sekhem Trait. Mortals may make Willpower \nChallenges against seven Traits; success restores one Willpower Trait. Those \nwho fail feel guilt rise so strongly in them that they lose a point of Sekhem or \nWillpower, as appropriate. \nWhen used against vampires, this spell induces lethargy and slumber \n(vampires are subject to the same penalties for waking activity as if it were \ndawn, as described in Laws of the Night, Revised Edition, p. 11 1). Targeted \nvampires must spend one Willpower Trait each turn to remain awake. This is \nlong enough to escape the effect, and it dissipates thereafter. Those who do not \nfall asleep as normal for a full hour. Only an attack or being set on fire can \nawaken them. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nREAD THE TREE OF LIFE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 1 \nAccording to Egyptian tradition, Seshet, said by some to be the wife of \nThoth, records everyone’s life somewhere on the Tree oflife. Skilled astrologers \ncan read her markings. This ritual unfurls the leaf that is the record of a single \nexistence, mortal or supernatural. The degree to which the celestine can read \nforward or backward from the present moment depends on the number of \nMental Traits spent: \nTraits \nTime Span \n1 \none day \n2 \none week \n3 \none month \n4 \none year \n5 \na mortal lifetime \nThis divination is the most powerful available within the Cekstial Hekau, \nand is not used lightly: Master astrologers teach new Amenti that the knowledge \nthe Tree of Life carries with it a burden to act on it as to promote the cause of \nMa’at. Such predictions are never very clear, and Seshet does not feel the need \nto make her writings easy to read or understand. In reading backward, the \nAmenti may delve into someone’s history, while reading forward may give him \nsome warning regarding an event’s outcome. \nSANDSTORM \nType: Spell or Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 3 + 1 per level of damage \nWhen invoked as a spell with a Mental Challenge, this effect unleashes a \nwhirlwind of blasting sand (even out of the dust in the air if there’s no sand \navailable). The sand forms into a 10-foot-high column three feet across, plus \none per additional Mental Trait spent. \nWhen invoked as a ritual with a Static Mental Challenge, this effect works \nlike a specialized and more potent cousin to Weather Magic and Call the Stars. \nAll available sand and dust mass together to form a 500-foot-high wall, that is \nhalf a mile wide and 100-feet deep, traveling at up to 80 miles per hour in the \ndirection of the prevailing winds. It lasts as long as it remains within the \nmummy’s line of sight. \nIn either case, anyone caught in the sand blast suffers one level of lethal \ndamage per turn, plus another level for each additional Sekhem Trait that the \ncelestine spends while using this effect. The sand strips paint, clogs engines, \nblinds people with exposed eyes (requiring two turns to clear the grit), and \notherwise behaves like real sand moving really fast. The ritual form does require \nsignificant quantities of sand and loose dirt to work with; without them, it \ncreates a windstorm, which does bashing rather than lethal damage. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n* The celestine must concentrate on either form of this effect to maintain \nit. Taking damage disrupts concentration enough to end it. \nWISDOM OF ISIS \nType: Spell \nDifficulty: Opposing magic \nSekhem: 2 \nThis potent spell lets the celestine appeal to the goddess of wisdom to \ncancel out another’s spell. The difficulty for this challenge is the difficulty of \nthe targeted spell. Success cancels out the basic results of the spell; each \nadditional Mental Trait spent lets the celestine negate the effects of additional \nTraits spent, if relevant. It works against other Hekau and all other forms, such \nas sorcery, Thaumaturgy in its many forms, and Sphere magic. Once all the \ntarget spell’s successes are negated, the celestine may spend an additional \nMental Trait to change the spell’s target. It continues to operate as before, but \nagainst someone else - \npossibly the caster or an ally. \nMany celestines like to delay this spell with Hanging the Stars, so as to have \nit ready for unexpected encounters with hostile magic. \nADVANCED CELESTIAL \nADVANCED WEATHER MAGIC \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Varies \nSekhem: Varies \nSee the chart on p. 143 for the range of possible weather manipulations, \nall ofwhich now lie within the celestine’s grasp. Disaster and blessing alike wait \nfor the mummy to call them forth, and the changes can last whole seasons. \nSample effects include: \nTornado -A massive whirling vortex of screaming winds that inflicts \n10 levels of lethal damage within a five-yard radius any time it touches down. \nThe Amenti has no hope of controlling his creation once he sets it loose, \nthough. \nTyphoon - \nThe Amenti can unleash a week-long hurricane with \neffects like the Thunderstorm and Tornado combined, plus massive flooding. \nDIVINE GREATNlESS \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 2 \nThis is a stronger form of the Divine Forms spell, granting a three-Trait \nbonus in one category, plus an additional two if the celestine spends an \nadditional Mental Trait. The effect lasts for one hour. This spell uses Meditation \nfor its retests. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nPLAGUE OF MA’AT \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 10 \nThis ritual is actually a set of potent forces that Ma’at puts at the disposal \nof Celestial’s most diligent students. The great Biblical plagues were inflicted on \nEgypt, not in defense of it; Ma’at has accepted the justice of those ancient \nevents and therefore incorporated them into her arsenal of retribution. The \ncelestine must learn each of these rituals separately. \nEach Plague ofMa’at takes five hours to cast. It covers a single building, or \na larger area with the expenditure of additional Mental Traits: a city block for \none extra Trait, a neighborhood for two extra Traits, or an entire small town \nfor three extra Traits. It lasts for one hour unless otherwise specified. These \neffects are very frightening, and most people panic and flee the area. The \nresulting damage, panic and occasional loss of life gain the attention of the \nJudges of Ma’at - \nas well as other interested authorities who can recognize the \nunnatural -and the Amenti better have an ironclad reason why he has called \nup the plagues. \nWater to Blood: All water within the target area turns to cold, dead blood. \nPeople even weep and sweat blood. All water brought into the area suffers the \nsame effect, and the plague remains in effect until the next sunrise. The \nresulting blood has no nutritive value for either people or vampires, so \nindividuals in the area risk dehydration. \nBeetles: Flesh-eating beetles swarm out of the ground and over the entire \narea, devouring all flesh in the area. Even the undead, corpses and other \nsupematurals are not safe. Anyone covered in beetles suffers one level of lethal \ndamage each turn. The beetles are slower than people and very bad climbers, \nso Fair Escape is relatively easy once a target can move, and they flee from fire. \nLocusts: Swarms of locusts emerge from obscure comers and descend from \nthe sky to devour grain vegetables, fruit, bread and anything else vaguely edible. \nThey clog engines and fans, crawl all over people looking for crumbs, and \nobscure visibility. They force open cupboards and containers through sheer \nmass, and identify even the smallest openings to enter secured areas in search \nof food. This plague doesn’t directly inflict levels of damage, but it is profoundly \nunsettling. \nFrogs: Veritable torrents of frogs descend from the sky, many splattering \nfatally upon hitting the ground. The survivors hop madly in all directions. The \nfrogs exude a mild toxin that causes rashes on all who touch them, reducing the \nvictims to a maximum of one Appearancesrelated Trait for one full week. \nScorpions: Scorpions emerge from cracks and dark comers throughout the \narea. They’re easy to avoid, but if they sting a careless or unlucky individual, \nthey inflict one level of lethal damage per tum for three turns. Multiple stings \ncan incapacitate or kill most people. \nSores: Everyone in the area suddenly develops painful itching and discovers \nspreading red spots or pustules. In a few hours, these blemishes burst into wet, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\noozhg sores, inflicting one level of lethal damage and negating all but one \nAppearance-related Trait until the damage heals. \nDeath: One in 10 mortal victims dies. The Storyteller may choose the \nspecific targets, or roll randomly for them, or select by some other means. Death \ntakes the form of sudden hemorrhaging or a heart attack, so beings not \nsusceptible to such damage can’t be affected. While it causes little material \ndestruction, the horror from such a loss of life can be catastrophic. \nROUSING APOPHIS \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 9 \nSekhem: 15 \nAll of the resurrected know Apophis as the great adversary, the serpent \nthat seeks to swallow the sun and plunge the world into darkness. The most \npowerful masters of Celestial learn how to put the Great Beast to use in the \nservice of his own enemies. The mummy briefly rouses Apophis, and makes the \nearth shake. The earthquake is at least 8.0 on the Richter scale: Buildings \ncrumble, fault lines crack, and so on. The epicenter is wherever the mummy \nstands when performing the ritual, and it cannot be delayed with Hanging the \nStars. The mummy is very likely to die in the earthquake, along with many of \nthe others in the area, and he better have a good answer for the angry questions \nthe Judges will ask in the Underworld. Because of the risk of massive loss of life \nand possibly unbalancing the Scales of Ma’at, this ritual is granted only to those \nAmenti who hold to Ma’at’s principles most strictly. There are also whispers \nfrom Amenti in the Underworld that avast, scaled form stretching for miles has \nbeen seen in Duat during this ritual. While most Amenti believe Apophis is \nmythical, none wish to find out just how mythical he truly is. \nEFFIGY \nUnlike amulets, effigies need not be worn to provide benefits for their \nusers, and indeed some effigies are immaterial, existing only in the Underworld. \nIt takes the same challenge to create an effigy as an amulet (retest with Crafts), \nexcept as noted specifically below, after which the mummy inscribes the ritual’s \nwords of power. This takes one day for Basic effects, three days for Intermediate \neffects, or five days for Advanced effects, with breaks only to eat, sleep and \nmeditate to renew Sekhem. The artisan may speed the process along by using \nSekhem from Vessels or potions. \nOnce made, the effigy doesn’t need renewal, unlike an amulet. It sits inert \nmost of the time, acting only when infused with Sekhem at activation. Anyone \nwho knows Effigy can try to activate a given effigy, making a Static Mental \nChallenge against the difficulty of the particular ritual. The effigy does require \nSekhem to be spent with every use. Ifdenied its “food,” the effigy becomes inert. \nWhen activated, effigies grow to the full size of the creatures they resemble, \nbut they are clearly works of art brought to life. The artisan must make a Static \nPhysical Challenge against six Traits (retest with Crafts) and spend one \nSekhem to repair one health level ofdamage that an effigy suffers, since effigies \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nhave no innate capability for healing. An effigy reduced past Incapacitated is \nimmediately destroyed. \nEffigies register as magical items to Awareness and suitable mystic senses. \nBASIC EFFIGY \nBASIC CHATTEL \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 5 \nSekhem: 2 to create, 1 per week to maintain \nWith a Physical Challenge (retest with Crafts), this ritual turns a small \nmodel of a simple common object - \na bed, a sword, a skateboard and so on - \ninto a full-sized functional item when activated. Anyone can carry the effigy \nas a charm, use it as a paperweight, or stuff it in a pocket while it’s deactivated, \nsince it’s full-size only when activated with Sekhem. Complex items such as \nfirearms, bicycles and electronics become full-sized and very convincing in \nappearance, but don’t actually work. \nBASIC CREATURE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 5 \nSekhem: 3 to create, 1 per week to maintain \nThe artisan crafts a figurine of a tiny creature, such as a scorpion, frog, rat \nor bird, with a Static Physical Challenge (retest with Crafts). When activated, \nthe effigy takes on the semblance of life and can carry out simple tasks, like \ntransporting written messages and searching small areas. The effigy is no \nsmarter than the creature on which it’s based and can easily be confused by \ncommands to do things foreign to its nature. It has the natural weaponry of the \nkind the artisan copies. More complex abilities - \na scorpion’s venom, a bat’s \nsonar - \nare beyond the effigy’s means at this level. \nBASIC INERTION \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nThis spell protects the artisan from other artisans’ handwork. The mummy \nmust touch the artifact inquestion, which requires anormal Physical Challenge \nin combat situations, and makes a Social Challenge against the creator (retest \nwith Occult). If the artisan using Basic Inertion wins, he can deactivate the \nproduct of any Basic Effigy effect for one hour. The creator may restart it after \nthat. This spell also applies to the Basic powers of comparable magic, such as \nmagic that animates statues or creates spiritual duplicates of objects. \nBASIC SERVITOR \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 5 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSekhem: 1 to create, 1 per month to maintain \nAncient Egyptian nobility were entombed with small figurines of clay, \nwood or stone enchanted to serve them. With a Static Physical Challenge, this \nritual creates a small, nearly mindless entity that can carry out single-phrase \ninstructions like “dig,” “sweep,” “follow” and “carry.” The Basic Servitor cannot \nunderstand more complex orders or engage in fine manipulation. It cannot \nfight or heal itself; it has three health levels, and suffers no wound penalties \nuntil it’s destroyed. \nBASIC WREST \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 + special \nThis spell lets the artisan attempt to seize control of a Basic Efigy creation \nwithin the mummy’s line of sight. Spend one Sekhem, plus any Sekhem that \nwould normally be necessary to activate the effigy, and make a Social Challenge \nagainst its creator (retest with Occult). Success gives the wrester full control: \nShe can command, activate and deactivate the effigy as she chooses. The \noriginal creator may use this same spell to try to take back control, if he knows \nit. As with Basic Inertion, this can affect comparable magic ofnon-Amenti sorts. \nCOMMAND BASIC IMPLEMENT \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nWith a successful Mental Challenge (retest with Occult), the artisan takes \ncontrol of an inanimate object’s essence. This spell affects only simple items, \nwithout moving parts, like knives, brushes and chisels. Success gives the artisan \none bonus Trait for all challenges involving using that implement for the next \nhour. \nFALSE DOOR \nType: Spell or Ritual \nSekhem: Special \nThe artisan creates a portal through a solid object - \nup to one foot deep \nwith Basic Efigy, three feet with Intermediate, or five feet with Advanced. To \ncast this effect as a spell, he draws or scratches the shape of adoor in the barrier, \nspends one Sekhem, and makes a Physical Challenge (retest with Crafts). If \nsuccessful, the door flickers with an opalescent sheen and allows passage in \neither direction for one turn per Balance Trait that the artisan possesses. \nTo cast this effect as a ritual, he creates a careful representation of a door \non one side of the barrier, spends five Sekhem, and makes a Static Physical \nChallenge against six Traits (retest with Crafts). Apart from the faGade of a \ndoor, there’s no visible sign of the passage. The creator may pass through it in \neither direction at any time upon winning a Mental Challenge (retest with \nOccult). He can spend one Sekhem a month to bond the door and any active \neffigies, to allow them to use it as well, and may spend one Sekhem to open the \ndoor for anyone to use for one hour. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nOther mummies who know about the door may spend one Sekhem and \nmake a Mental Challenge to use it even when the creating artisan isn’t present. \nNeither spell nor ritual forms of False Door allow anyone to look through \nthe doorway. The only way to find out what’s on the other side is to go there. \nINTERMEDIATE EFFIGY \nBOND OF FATE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 6 to create, 1 to maintain for the scene \nThe artisan forges a mystic link between a model she’s made of an object \nand theoriginal, using astatic Mentalchallenge (retest withoccult). Any fate \nthat befalls one happens to both, including the transmission of damage. The \nlinked object or structure must never have been alive (that is, neither living nor \na corpse, but an inanimate object) and can be no larger than a house. \nCOMMAND INTERMEDIATE IMPLEMENT \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 for small, simple devices, 2 for larger and/or more complex ones \nThis spell lets the artisan control the essence of a wide range of tools and \nmachines, from guns and locks up to cars, boats and even small houses. With \na successful Mental Challenge (retest with Occult), the artisan receives three \nbonus Traits on all challenges involving using the item in question for the next \nhour. Items too large to rest comfortably in the artisan’s hand and/or requiring \nsophisticated tools to assemble and maintain require two Sekhem to control. \nGUARD \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 4 to create, 1 per week to maintain \nWithastatic Physical Challenge againstsevenTraits (retest withoccult), \nthis ritual creates a superior servitor in the form of a powerful warrior figurine, \narmed with a sword or spear. It can follow relatively complicated orders as long \nas they pertain to defense, and will fight until destroyed or ordered to desist. It \nhas seven health levels, nine Physical Traits, and three levels each ofDodge and \nMeke. It is unaffected by wound penalties, but cannot heal any damage it \nsustains. \nINTERMEDIATE CHATTEL \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: 3 to create, 1 per week to maintain \nThe artisan creates a model of a large and/or complex device such as a \npistol, car or cottage, following the same rules as for Basic Chattel. Highly \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncomplex items like computers and aircraft are beyond the scope of this ritual, \nand produce only convincing but inert duplicates. \nINTERMEDIATE CREATURE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 8 to create, 2 per week to maintain \nLike Basic Creature, this ritual lets the artisan create a figurine that can \nbecome a full-sized animal, now of any medium-sized animal species - \na dog, \ncat, python, monkey, hyena, lynx and so on. Intermediate Creatures possess all \nthe natural weaponry of their kind and capabilities of their kind (a bat’s sonar, \na cobra’s venom and so on), and will fight on behalf of their creator if instructed \nto do so. They are significantly more intelligent and loyal than natural animals, \nand can carry out detailed instructions reliably. \nINTERMEDIATE INERTION \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThis spell behaves like Basic Inertion, except that it neutralizes both Basic \nand Intermediate Effigy magic. \nINTERMEDIATE WREST \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 + special \nThis spell works just like Basic Wrest, except that it can affect the works \nof both Basic and Intermediate Effigy. \nREFLECTION \nType: Ritual \nTraits: 6 \nSekhem: 2 to create, 1 per day to maintain \nThe artisan casts this ritual on an object no larger than a king-sized bed and \nno more complex than a bicycle. If the ritual succeeds (with a successful Static \nMental Challenge, retest with Occult), the artisan touches the item, or the \nspace in the Shadowlands where it would be, and it becomes real in Duat as well \nas in material existence. Anyone in the spirit world can then use the object \nnormally. Note that the object and its spiritual counterpart remain united: \nSomeone riding the bicycle in the material world makes it move without \napparent cause in the Shadowlands, and vice versa. Anything created with \nReflection is not considered a relic in the Underworld \nRELIC \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 3 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe artisan casts this spell while destroying an object in the physical \nworld, releasing its spiritual essence to exist in the Underworld. Many ghosts \nprize relics as luxuries of times past or necessities for existence, and relics can \nbe handy bargaining chips. The object can be no longer than a king-sized bed \nand not overly complex - \na revolver will yield to this spell, but not a \nmotorcycle. The spell requires the object’s complete destruction - \nby fire, \nsmashing into very small pieces, or otherwise rendering it beyond any mundane \nmeans of repair. Incomplete destruction guarantees that the object will not \nmanifest in h a t ,  and this spell can be tried only once on any given object. This \neffort requires a Mental Challenge (retested with Occult), in addition to any \nPhysical Challenges necessary to destroy the item. \nOVERSEER \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 2 to create, 1 per week to maintain \nEgyptian funerary custom called for carving a statue designed as the \nOverseer, a special servitor empowered to oversee the actions of the others. This \nritual lets the artisan create such a statue. When activated, it can carry out \nrelatively complex orders, such as digging irrigation trenches for a field or \ntransporting bricks and building a wall with them, or guarding from all except \nthose who know the password. The Overseer can direct up to 10 Simple Servitors \nor five Guards, within their usual limits. Remember that the Overseer has no \ntrue sentience, only its magical capacity to follow instructions - \nit has no \ngeneral initiative or creativity, and responds to unexpected circumstances by \nignoring them, as best it can. It is created no differently than a Guard. \nLike other Servitors, the Overseer cannot fight or heal itself. It has seven \nhealth levels. \nSEKHEM VESSEL \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: 8 to create, variable to infuse \nThis ritual works on any object with some space to hold something, from \na ring or locket with a secret compartment, or a jar, chest or bucket. The artisan \ninscribes words of power and enchants it to store Sekhem. With success on the \ncreation challenge (a Static Mental Challenge), the vessel is prepared and \ncapable of holding Sekhem. \nOther mummies can store Sekhem as well as the creator, as long as they \nknow Basic (or greater) Effigy. To store Sekhem, decide on the number of \nSekhem Traits to add (up to the limit of the container’s capacity as determined \nat its creation) and make a Mental Challenge. Success lets the mummy drain \nout one ofher Sekhem Traits to store in the vessel. Spending additional Mental \nTraits allows for further Sekhem to be stored on a one-for-one basis. \nAny mummy, with or without knowledge of Effigy, can withdraw the \nenergy. Make a Balance Challenge to withdraw Sekhem up to the mummy’s \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nnormal capacity. A character may have Sekhem Traits from just one Sekhem \nVessel at a time. \nADVANCED EFFIGY \nADVANCED BOND OF FATE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Target’s total (or 9, whichever is higher) \nSekhem: Varies \nThis ritual has two separate effects. First, it can work just like Bond ofFate \nbut extend to an object of any size, including a pyramid or battleship. It costs \n7 Sekhem to create this bond, and 2 more to make it active for the scene. \nSecond, the artisan can create the image of a specific person and use the \nresulting effigy to control that person’s will. When the artisan activates the \neffigy, make a challenge of the artisan’s Willpower against that of the target. If \nthe victim wins, the effigy shatters and becomes useless. On a tie, the struggle \ncontinues into the next turn. If the artisan wins, the artisan gains control of all \naspects of the victim’s movement except speech for one hour. The victim must \nmatch each motion that the mummy commands from the effigy, and suffers the \nsame damage that the effigy does. This bond demands a Social Challenge to \ncreate (retest with Occult), plus 20 Sekhem to activate it and 2 more to \nmaintain the bond for the scene. \nADVANCED CHATTEL \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 10 to create, 2 per day to maintain \nThis ritual extends the capabilities of Simpk Chattel to include even very \nlarge and complex items such as palaces, jets and computer networks. \nADVANCED CREATURE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 25 to create, 1 per day to maintain \nThis ritual lets the artisan create an effigy of any natural animal of any size \n- \nfrom an insect to a whale or giant squid - \nimbued with intelligence and \nknowledge equal to that of its creator. The effigy has the same ability ratings \nas the artisan at the time of creation, and can use them within the limits of its \nphysical form. Advanced Creature creations are absolutely loyal to the artisan \nand act with his interests and well-being in mind. This ritual works like Simple \nCreature to create the effigy. \nADVANCED INERTION \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThis spell works like Simple Inertion except that it can affect Basic, \nIntermediate and Advanced EfJlgy effects. If it's used successfully against a Ka \nVessel, the vessel's inhabitant must flee back into the Underworld. \nADVANCED REFLECTION \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 7 to create, 2 per day to maintain \nThis ritual works like Refkction except that it can affect very large and \ncomplex items like palaces and computer networks. \nADVANCED RELIC \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 10 \nThis spell works like Relic, but can transfigure very large and complex \nitems. Note that the item still must be destroyed for the spell to work, and \ndestroying a palace or computer network all at once at the right time is not a \nsmall task. \nADVANCED WREST \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 + special \nThis spell works like Basic Wrest, but can affect Basic, Intermediate and \nAdvanced Effigy creations. \nKA VESSEL \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 50 to create, 1 per scene to maintain \nThis ritual creates a life-sized magical statue to be activated and inhabited \nby the soul of the individual it represents. Each Ku Vessel must be made for a \nspecific individual, whose named is inscribed on it during the creation process. \nThe designated soul can enter the Ku Vessel from h a t  and activate it with a \nSocial Challenge. \nThe statue moves and attacks but cannot speak. It is as hard as the stone \nfrom which the artisan it was made, and correspondingly clumsy. The KuVessel \nhas 18 Physical Traits (six Strength-related, two Dexterity-related, 10 Stamina- \nrelated), no Social Traits and the soul's own Mental Traits. The statue has 10 \nhealth levels, and innate armor capable of negating two levels of bashing \ndamage or one level of lethal or aggravated damage per attack. It suffers no \nwound penalties and is as immune as stone to many physical attacks-poisons \ndon't matter, fire just smudges its surface, electricity bounces off, and so on. \nCrafting the KuVesselrequires a Static Physical Challenge (retest withcrafts). \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nNECROMANCY \nNecromancy is in many cultures an unwholesome, evil art. The Egyptians \nsaw it differently. While it has unsavory aspects, it’s essentially not only \nacceptable but necessary and proper, dealing with matters of great importance \nfor the healthy, virtuous soul. The troubled conditions of the Underworld make \nit potentially dangerous to the necromancer and others, but this doesn’t make \nNecromancy itself any less innately desirable. \nNecromancy rituals take 10 minutes for Basic effects, 30 minutes for \nIntermediate effects, or 50 minutes for Advanced effects, unless otherwise \nnoted. Necromancy spells generally have instant (or very shortly thereafter) \neffects. \nKeep in mind that this Hekau has nothing to do with the vampiric \nDiscipline of the same name, and knowing one offers no benefit toward \nworking with the other. Necromancy can retest with Occult or Thanatology, \nunless otherwise noted. \nBASIC NECROMANCY \nBANISH THE DEAD \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nThis spell lets the necromancer command a single ghost to leave her \nvicinity. If her Mental Challenge is successful, it drives the ghost 5Oyards away, \nand keeps it that far away for the duration of the spell. The ghost can use ranged \nattacks and otherwise operate normally, and the spell works against only one \nspecified ghost per casting. (The necromancer can target other ghosts on later \nturns.) The necromancer must be able to directly sense the target in some way, \nwhether in the material world or across the Shroud; the spell does not affect \nmummies in spirit forms, but does work against any other spirits within the \nUnderworld. \nThe spell lasts for one turn per Balance Trait. The necromancer may spend \none Mental Trait to extend this to one full hour, two Traits to make it last for \none day, three Traits to make it last for one week, or four Traits to make it last \nfor one month. \nBIND THE DEAD \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Target’s Willpower \nSekhem: 2 \nJust as the necromancer may summon the dead to himself (with Summon \nthe Dead, seep. 163), so he may try to command their obedience. This spell pits \nthe force of his khaibit’s intimidating strength against the ghost’s will to resist, \nthrough a Static Social Challenge. If successful, the necromancer commands \nthe ghost for one full day. The ghost must obey, but has the liberty to do so \ngrudgingly and hesitantly. The necromancer may spend an additional Social \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTrait to make the ghost obey efficiently and quickly, or two Mental Traits to \nmake it honor the spirit as well as the letter of his commands. The command \nmust be something the ghost has a reasonable chance of attempting, though \nnot necessarily a task it can count on bringing to completion within the day. \nVery complex orders may apply as well as simple ones, limited only by the \nghost’s ability to understand them. This spell works only when the necromancer \nis himself alive, and affects only ghosts. \nBODY PRESERVATION \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: 3 \nThe Amenti’s corpse is immune to the normal processes of decay after the \nSpell of Life, but is not automatically protected from deliberately applied \ntraumas suffered while the soul is in h a t .  This ritual creates a noxious mixture \nof oils, creams and potions which, when applied to the body, increase the khat’s \nresilience. The process takes one full day to complete, plus a successful Static \nMental Challenge; when it’s done, the target khat gains the equivalent of one \nlevel of the Ku Background. If the target already has a rating in Ka, Body \nPreservation raises it by one, up to a maximum of five levels. In addition, the \ntarget gains a bonus to Ka challenges to protect the khat from harm - \none \nbonus Trait if she knows Basic Necromancy, three Traits if she knows \nIntermediate, or five Traits if she knows Advanced. The caster can work this \nritual only upon herself or whatever corpse she currently animates. \nThis ritual calls for exotic components. A mummy who knows what to \nlook for may determine if a mummy necromancer is in the area by checking \nlocal herb shops to see if certain ingredients have been purchased. \nDEATH’S SHROUD \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nTo cast this spell, the necromancer lies down and places some sort of \nsymbolic shield over his heart and eyes, whether it’s as simple as a strip of paper \nor as ornate as a golden mask. He concentrates for one turn, makes the \nnecessary Mental Challenge, and shapes Sekhem into a magical shield against \nspiritual injury. Attacks that wouldharmorscry for themummy’ssoulmustfirst \novercome the resistance of Death’s Shroud, which has one Trait plus an \nadditional one for each Mental Trait that the necromancer spends when \ncasting it. These Traits reduce levels of damage done and must be overcome in \nMental or Social Challenges (depending on the effect being used against the \nmummy). Each challenge, successful or not, reduces the Shroud’s total by one. \nThose with spirit-sight and comparable powers can see the Shroud as a \ngray halo around both the khat and the mummy’s soul in the Underworld. \nDeath’s Shroud remains active until the next sunrise at the khat’s location. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nGHOST LANTERN \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThis spell works only in the Underworld. The mummy utters a short \nsyllable, the player makes a Mental Challenge and, if both are successful, a \nsmall piece of ectoplasm glows with a flickering green light. This light can float \nin his hands, or shine from within an existing object; in either case, it \nilluminates the Underworld to a distance of one yard per Balance Trait. \nFERTILITY OF OSIRIS \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 9 \nSekhem: 1 \nThis ritual is unlikely to come into play during aLaws of the Resurrection \nsession (review the basic principles of Mind’s Eye Theatre play if any questions \narise about its suitability). It allows a dead male - \nwhether a Sefekhi, an older \nmummy created via Lesser Resurrection, and even an ordinary corpse - \nto \nimpregnate a living mortal woman. The offspring is a normal mortal child. For \npurposes of Storytelling, the ritual requires a Static Mental Challenge. \nJUDGE THE SOUL \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nThe mummy can appraise the purity of a soul by trace manifestations, both \nphysical and spiritual. To judge another’s soul, the mummy scrutinizes the \ntarget for one full turn - \nshe does not need to speak anything, but her intense \nstaring may attract notice. If she succeeds in the ensuing Mental Challenge, she \ncan immediately identify fellow mummies and those with True Faith, and she \ncan get a general sense of the target’s overall compassion and courage. She can \nspend an additional Mental Trait to identify specific areas of moral strength \nand weakness, one particularly high or low point of virtue per Balance Trait \nthat the necromancer possesses. \nMost supernatural beings have some feature that identifies them to one \njudging their souls, such as vampiric bloodthirst, werewolves’ rage or changelings’ \nGlamour. This spell also functions onghosts, although the mummy must either \nbe in the Underworld or be able to see across the Shroud. If she spends the \nadditional Mental Trait to identify the ghost’s spirit more thoroughly, she may \nbe able to tell if the Shadow is currently dominant (provided she knows what \nit is). However, the Judges of Ma’at are not always infallible, and a failed \nchallenge may suggest information that is not true (such as an infernalist \nsorcerer appearing to be pure of heart). \nSome supernatural creatures possess concealing techniques that may hide \ntheir unusual “marks.” A mummy must know Intermediate Necromancy to see \nthrough Basic Disciplines of concealment, and Advanced Necromancy to see \nthrough Intermediate techniques. This spell uses Dietination for its retest. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nREVISIT DEATH \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 5 \nSekhem: None \nThe necromancer rubs the skin of a corpse and draws out images and \nmemories buried in the khat's flesh and makes a Static Mental Challenge. The \nexperiences come out in a combination of vision and emotional experience, \ncascading over the course of a few seconds. Success shows the necromancer the \nmost intense experience the person had in the day before death. Spend one \nadditional Mental Trait for one strong impression per Balance Trait spread \nthroughout the last week of the subject's life, or two additional Mental Traits \nfor two such impressions per Balance Trait spread throughout the last month. \nThe necromancer must touch the body physically, and must therefore be living \nand in the mortal world. The ritual only affects the truly dead- not vampires, \nmummies and the like. This ritual calls for Divination for its retest. \nSENSE THE DEAD \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 5 \nSekhem: 1 \nThe necromancer attunes herself to her vicinity, gaining a preternatural \nawareness of any passage of the dead, through a Static Mental Challenge. \nWhenever aghost enters the area, the mummy feels a cold chill and immediately \nknows that the boundary has been violated. The area can cover up to 10 square \nfeet per Balance Trait, and can be in any location where the necromancer can \nphysically stand on each boundary point. Most necromancers use this ritual for \ninformation about their tomb, though any place the living mummy can go is \na potential target. Note that the ritual does not tell the necromancer just where \nthe boundary was crossed, only that it was crossed somewhere. \nThe warning sense applies not only to ghosts, but to nature spirits, \nmummies in spirit form and other sentient creatures in h a t .  The necromancer \nmay make a Mental Challenge to identify a specific spirit she's met before. She \nmust be alive to perform the ritual, but it continues to function while she's in \nspirit form. It lasts for one month. \nSEPARATE KA \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThis spell lets the necromancer separate his ka while still alive, rather than \nhaving to wait for the next death cycle. With a successful Mental Challenge, \nthe khat falls comatose, and the ka emerges in the Underworld, connected to \nthe body by the khu. The separation lasts for one hour and follows as per Potion \nof rhe Separable Ku, with the following caveats. \nThe spirit may travel only in the Heter-khertet, the Shadowlands close to \nthe lands of the living. For an additional Sekhem Trait, the spirit may manifest \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwithin the living world, appearing as an idealized version of the necromancer. \n(If the mummy has aka tem-akh, some of its First Life appearance contributes \nto the result.) The materialized ka has three Physical Traits and cannot use \nSekhem to channel Hekau. If struck, he loses Sekhemrather than health levels, \nbut his Necromancy rating provides some armor: it negates one level of lethal \nor bashing damage if he knows BasicNecromancy, two ifhe knows Intermediate, \nor three if he knows Advanced. \nThe ka returns to the body automatically when the hour is up. If the ka \nhappens to be more than a few paces from the body then, make a Physical \nChallenge to avoid taking a level of bashing damage from psychic shock. \nSTORM SHIELD \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 2 \nThis spell protects the necromancer and his allies from spiritually inflicted \ndamage while they’re in the Underworld. If the Mental Challenge is successful, \nit lasts until the next sunrise at the location of the mummy’s body, and acts as \none level of armor for every two Balance Traits, rounded up. The spell protects \nthe necromancer and one additional target for each additional Mental Trait \nspent at casting. \nSTORMWALK \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nThe Underworld has its own topography, with roads known as Byways and \nstrongholds where ghosts dwell. The Dja-akh ripped through it all and \ncontinues to work changes; little is constant anymore across the Shroud. \nUsually mummies travel long distances in the Underworld guided by Anubis \nor one of the Aken, his boatmen, but sometimes they must go alone and rely \non their own intuition. This spell lets the mummy navigate with reference to \nany location to whichshe’s attunedherself. WithasuccessfulMentalChallenge, \nStomwalk shows the Amenti a quick route to her desired goal based on that \nreference point. Note, however, that “quick” does not necessarily mean \n“safe”. . . . \nSUMMON THE DEAD \nType: Ritual \nTraits: Target’s Willpower total \nSekhem: 1 \nThe necromancer speaks the name of someone who died in his presence \nor whom he met in the Underworld and bends his will toward that person. If \nthe necromancer triumphs (a successful Static Social Challenge), a black \nportal opens in the Underworld and pulls the ghost immediately to the \nmummy’s location. The ghost retains its independence and may well be hostile, \neven dominated by its darker half, and the necromancer must persuade or \ncoerce its cooperation once it’s actually on the spot. Only a living mummy can \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nperform this spell, and it only affects true ghosts, not mummies in the death \ncycle or other spirits who wander among the dead. \nINTERMEDIATE NECROMANCY \nAMENTI’S GRACE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 5 \nThis ritual protects an area of the Underworld, up to 10 feet square per \nBalance Trait that the necromancer possesses, against the Dja-akh storms. The \nritual uses a smaller-scale version of the ancient rites used to preserve the \noriginal city of Amenti, with modifications to cope with the stresses that \noverwhelmed the old Kingdom of Sand. The necromancer walks the perimeter \nof his chosen area while uttering prayers to Ra, then steps inside to spend the \nritual time in prayer. At the end of his prayers, he makes a Static Mental \nChallenge. If successful, the ritual creates an area within which the Dja-akh \ndoes not blow. The protection lasts for one day, or longer if the necromancer \nspends additional Mental Traits: one week for one Trait, one month for two \nTraits, six months for three Traits, or one year for four Traits. By spending four \nMental Traits and sacrificing a permanent Willpower Trait, the necromancer \ncan make the protection permanent. Because the shifting Byways and Dja-akh \nmake travel both hazardous and confusing, the necromancer should choose the \nprotected location carefully. \nHavens like this are extremely rare in the Underworld, and a new one \nattracts the attention of local wraiths and Spectres, many of whom try to claim \nthe protected area for themselves. \nANIMATE CORPSE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 3 \nThis ritual lets the necromancer create one of the classic “walking dead” \nof folklore, a barely conscious creature under her control. The ritual requires \nthe necromancer to perform the appropriate incantations while inscribing \nsymbols on the target corpse’s chest or breathing air into its lungs. After \ncreating the corpse, the necromancer makes the Static Mental Challenge. The \nresulting creation has the statistics of a shambler (seep. 256) and does nothing \non its own initiative except stand and rot, in the absence of simple and explicit \ninstructions from the necromancer. The creature loses one health level per \nweek, finally crumbling into a mound of bones and viscera, unless protected \nwith Body Preservation. Success at that spell protects the body for one year, plus \none year per additional Mental Trait spent, unless the body’s destroyed by \nexternal forces. The necromancer can have a total of active corpses at any given \ntime of one per Balance Trait, plus three if she knows IntermediateNecromancy , \nor five if she knows Advanced. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThis is not a virtuous action, and mummies concerned with Ma’at use it \nsparingly. If the spirit of the body becomes aware of the abuse, she will have \nsomething to say about it. The Bane Mummies and their ilk have no such \nworries, and rumor claims they have legions of such shambling corpses to do \ntheir bidding. \nBIND THE LIVING \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 3 \nWith this ritual, a mummy can assure herself of a few allies among the dead \nby working with them before death. The necromancer must spend one full day, \nfrom sunrise to sunset (a minimum of eight hours, if the local daylight hours are \nfewer at the moment), chanting over the subject and inscribing a set of glyphs \non the subject’s heart while explaining to the subject what’s going on. She then \nmakes a Static Social Challenge. If the ritual succeeds, the subject returns as \na ghost after death, subject to the necromancer within the constraints of basic \nsuccess for Bind the Dead. The subject needs to understand that he’s being \nbound to this attachment to the living world rather than passing on to lasting \njudgment, but the necromancer is free to add embellishments and other little \nwhite lies (such as claiming that this is the subject’s way to earn forgiveness of \nsins, or that this is a path to higher power in the long run). \nThe necromancer must spend one Sekhem Trait each time he wants to \nsummon a bound soul, and he can have a maximum of his Balance Traits in \nbound souls, plus three if he knows Intermediate Necromancy, or five if he \nknows Advanced. This ritual works only on normal humans-vampires, \nother \nmummies and supernatural creatures are considered to be already weighted for \njudgment - \nand the mummy must be in the living world to use it. \nDEATH’S HAND \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 3 \nThis spell lets the necromancer channel the raw force of the Underworld \nthrough his khaibit, on either side of the Shroud. He must first touch his target \nwith a successful Physical Challenge (skin-to-skin contact is not required). He \nthen makes a Mental Challenge. If successful, he inflicts one level of aggravated \ndamage on the target, plus one for each additional Mental Trait spent. The \ntarget is also stunned and cannot act for the rest of the turn. Acting as a conduit \nfor this power has its cost: The mummy suffers one level of lethal damage for \neach level of damage done to the target, and his arm temporarily chars black. \n(Repeated use leaves permanent marks.) This power works equally well on \neither side of the Shroud, and any marks from its use show up in both worlds \nas well. \nKHAIBAT’S EMBRACE \nType: Spell \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nP \nSekhem: 10 \nOnly living mummies can perform this spell. The necromancer grasps the \ntarget by the face, which requires a Physical Challenge in combat situations, \nand spends three turns chanting arcane phrases. A resisting target can foil the \nspell by breaking the mummy’s grip with other Physical Challenges, forcing the \ncaster to start the procedure all over again. When the chant is complete (it \ntakes approximately three minutes), the necromancer makes a SocialChallenge. \nIf this spell succeeds, the necromancer draws out the target’s khaibit in a \nphysical manifestation: Black, viscous ectoplasm pours out of the subject’s skin \nand wraps his body in a slimy bundle. Once encased, the victim falls into a \ntrance in which he cannot act, move or use magical powers. Nor can he be \nkilled, until the khaibit prison is removed. The Embrace lasts until the caster \nchooses to end it, when some preset condition arrives, or when a counter- \nenchantment negates it. Any mummy who knows this spell can use it toremove \nthe Embrace, with the same difficulties and costs as were involved in its \ncreation. \nMANIFESTATION \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 5 \nSekhem: 3 \nThe necromancer performs this ritual while in the Underworld to manifest \ntangibly in the physical world for one hour. Her manifested body is solid, but \nhas the feel and consistency of liquefied jelly, with a shimmering-silver, \ntranslucent sheen. Mortals who see it suffer the effects of the Veil. The ritual \nrequires a Static Mental Challenge to be successful. \nThe manifested body is limited in effective Physical Traits to the number \nof Balance Traits that the necromancer has at the time. Bashing and lethal \nattacks, no matter how many levels they had normally inflicted, inflict only \none level of bashing damage, with the rest harmlessly splashing through the \nviscous form. Aggravated damage hurts the necromancer as usual, as do attacks \ndesigned to work against spirits and the dead. Any weapons and other items the \nnecromancer carries in the Underworld materialize with her and work normally. \nIf separated from her, they dissolve at the end of the turn. \nThe necromancer may also perform this ritual while living to make a target \nghost manifest, if she can see it before performing the ritual. It has the same \nadvantages and limitations that the necromancer would if using it on herself. \nSEPARATE BA \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nWith a moment’s concentration and a short incantation (and a successful \nMental Challenge), the mummy detaches his ba from his body. This spell works \nmuch like Separate Ku, except that the ba can go anywhere in the spirit world. \nIf the necromancer’s body dies or his soul is disrupted during this spell, he \nimmediately enters the death cycle. Because his spirit is already in the \nUnderworld, however, he does not attract Anubis’ attention or automatically \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nappear before the Judges of Ma’at. Therefore, some necroman \nto escape judgment when they feel death is near. \nSEVER SOUL \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 3 \nThis spell lets the necromancer cut off the soul of a living subject from its \nbody, if the soul is currently outside the body due to Separate Ka, Separate Ba \nor other comparable magical ability. The necromancer makes a tugging gesture \nand speaks a short word of command, then pits her mental power against the \ntarget’s will to remain a connected entity (make a Mental Challenge). If the \ntarget wins, nothing happens. On a tie, the defender suffers one level of bashing \ndamage and knows that something is trying to harm his connection with his \nbody. If the necromancer succeeds, the khu breaks and leaves the khat \nunconnected to its soul. The body falls into a coma, and needs medical \nattention to avoid withering away from malnutrition and other mundane \ncauses. The cut-off spirit functions normally in the Underworld; the necromancer \ncan try to control it, or let it find its own way. Because the khu has been broken, \nthe likelihood of the spirit finding its way back to its body is very slim, especially \nif the spirit wandered far into h a t .  The necromancer can cast this spell from \neither side of the Shroud. \nSHADOW PORTAL \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: 2 \nThis ritual lets the necromancer tear a hole in the fabric of the Underworld \nand step directly from one point to another. It cannot be performed in a hurry, \nwhich does not allow for escape in the midst of combat. The necromancer \nvisualizes the destination, which he must have visited before or have seen \nclearly via some remote means, and channels his khaibit, letting it seize the \nUnderworld‘s substance and pull a Byway out of nothing (using a Static Mental \nChallenge). He then steps through, and the portal closes behind him. He can \ntake one traveler with him, plus another for each Mental Trait he spends; they \nmust be holding onto him as the ritual ends. If the destination is blocked by a \nmagical ward or other force, the ritual automatically fails. The necromancer \nmust be in the Underworld to perform Shadow Portal. \nSIN-EATING \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 2 \nThe Egyptian priesthood had rituals for removing the sins accumulated in \nsupplicants’ souls before their voyage into the Underworld. This ritual draws \non that tradition, evoking the power of the khaibit to connect with a subject’s \nbaser urges and instincts. The subject must describe in detail the focus of some \nanger, hatred, jealousy or other powerful negative emotion. The mummy \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrepeats the description, substituting himself as the subject: “I want to kill my \nlover,” the subject says, and the mummy repeats “I want to kill your lover.” \nHaving taken on a particular sin, the necromancer makes a Static Social \nChallenge; success allows the mummy to “eat” the sin. The mummy thereby \nremoves the sins and takes them into her own darker self. The mummy must \nmake separate challenges for each new sin. \nThe target no longer feels the intensity driving those dark urges. He is \nquieted and freed of the urge to act on them. Conversely, the mummy feels \nthem very strongly, and each significant step she makes toward fulfilling them, \nwhether literally or symbolically, grants her a Sekhem or a Willpower Trait, at \nthe player’s choice. The mummy’s greatest advantage is that she understands \nand controls her khaibit, and can transmute the eaten impulses into better \nones. For instance, the urge to kill a lover can instead become the urge to \nconfront, honestly explain difficult matters, and separate oneself from the \nlover. The mummy, as an outside party, has the freedom to pursue indirect and \nalternative strategies. \nIn theory, Sin-Eating could work on vampires, Spectres and the like, but \nmummies don’t feel inclined to risk the experiment. This ritual uses Meditation \nfor its retests. \nADVANCED NECROMANCY \nCALL THE KHAIBIT \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 2 \nThe necromancer recites this Hekau over a dying individual, who \nexperiences flashbacks to his every act of passion, immorality and malice. After \nthe recitation (which takes five minutes), the mummy makes a SocialChallenge. \nIf the spell succeeds, the target’s khaibit leaves completely. The target dies \npeacefully, and its essence passes on without lingering as a ghost. The khaibit \nremains behind as a dark entity haunting the place of death. It functions much \nlike a spirit created by Separate Ka, though prone to malicious ends. Left to \nitself, the khaibit tries to injure and terrify the living, and attempts to steal and \ndevour sacrifices made to the deceased. \nThe khaibit remains vulnerable to necromantic compulsion and \nbanishment, with the opportunities and limitations created by the Separate Ka \nspell. Some necromancers use the khaibit as spectral watchdogs for locations. \nENTRAP THE BA \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Target’s Willpower \nSekhem: 3 \nThe cycle of life and death is eternal but not immune to interference. \nExperienced necromancers can build shackles to hold part of a target’s spirit, \nmaking resurrection impossible and forcing living beings into comatose states. \nThe necromancer must first craft an object to serve as the focus for a trapped \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nenge against six Traits \nsuffices, though many mummies use Amukt Hekau to reinGrce-the ritual. Once \nthe item is ready, the necromancer chants the Hekau while touching the object \nto the subject’s body, then makes a Static Mental Challenge (a Physical \nChallenge may be necessary to place the object against the target). Success on \nthe ensuing challenge pulls the subject’s ba into the focus. \nA spirit trapped this way cannot manifest in or travel the Underworld. The \nbody becomes comatose; a mummy suffering from its ba’s absence cannot \ncontinue the cycle of resurrection. The necromancer can release the spirit by \ntouching his focus to the subject body again. Otherwise the spirit must rely on \nsuch spells as can be performed in spirit form. In general, the only way to release \nthe ba is to destroy the focus. \nHEART OF LIFE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 7 \nThis ritual lets the necromancer remove some portion of her body - \na \nfingertip, a toe, a vial’s worth of blood, a lock of hair and so on - \nand endow \nit with the ability to act as an alternative vessel for returning to life. She places \nthe removed portion into a jar or coffin, entombs it with inscriptions from the \nBook of the Dead, and makes a Static Mental Challenge. If her body is \ncompletely destroyed, she may use the Heart ofLife as her new body during the \nnext resurrection challenge. \nA mummy may only have one working Heart of Life at a time. \nPANOPLY OF SHADOW \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 20 \nThe experienced necromancer can call on the power of the Underworld, \nas with Death’s Hand, and on the intimidating depths of the deep void. \nUnleashed properly, the khaibit can draw on both to provide almost unbeatable \nprotection. It takes the standard ritual time to prepare the Panoply of Shadow, \nfollowed by a Static Mental Challenge. The necromancer may then unleash \nthe khaibit any time before the next new moon by speaking a single word \nsignifying the concept of nothingness. The khaibit surges forth to wrap the \nmummy’s body and soul in a resilient black sheen for one hour. \nAnyone opposing the necromancer guarded this way suffers a one-Trait \npenalty for every Balance Trait the mummy possesses. Tangible force cannot \npenetrate the shadow at all, and the mummy has armor against even aggravated \ndamage equal to his Balance rating. Effects that work on the mind function \nnormally, so the mummy can be possessed, commanded, drained of energy, and \nso on. \nThis ritual is both technically difficult to master and philosophically \ntroublesome: It involves putting the mummy perilously close to the land of \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nApophis, the Great Devourer. The mummy must have great confidence inhis \ndedication to Balance and the ability to stay on the course of life in the midst \nof the darkness. This Hekau uses Occult to retest. \nRESHAPE THE LOST SOUL \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 3 \nGhosts who linger in the Underworld have strong passions and drives, \nwhich renew their spiritual energy and keep them motivated in the face of \nadversity. This spell lets the necromancer alter one or more of these Passions \nin a ghost within a range equal to the mummy’s Balance rating in yards. Success \non a Social Challenge lets the mummy remove or alter one such Passion, plus \nanother one per additional Mental Trait spent. It takes one turn per change to \nactually work the transformation, and the changes last indefinitely thereafter, \nas they’re now part of the ghost’s very essence. This sort of manipulation carries \nthe risk ofgreat offense against Ma’at, particularly when the ghost doesn’t wish \nto submit. The Judges of Ma’at have been known to change a soul back to its \nprior nature and unleash it on the necromancer responsible for the changes. \nSCOURING OBLIVION \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 5 \nThe necromancer traces protective patterns on a subject’s flesh (or, in the \ncase of ghosts, ectoplasm) and scours away the marks of death. All traces of \ninjury, disease, poison and the like vanish as he works. Wounds close under his \nhands, while poison and disease leave the body in visible trails ofdripping taint. \nAt the conclusion of the ritual, the mummy makes a Static Mental Challenge, \nspreads his hands, and all lingering ichor disappears. If the scouring succeeds, \nthe target regains maximum health levels. The mummy can perform this ritual \non himself as well as others. \nNOMENCLATURE \nNomenclature is in some ways the most fundamental of magics, as it deals \nwith the very essence of things and their identities. True names confer vast \npower over the named, for those who understand how to use the name properly. \nIt takes time to master true names, but then mummies have plenty of time.. .. \nMany things have overlapping names. Each intelligent creature has a \nunique name for itself. Thus there’s a ren for each species and element. Each \npart of the body has its own true name, as do qualities like emotions, and the \nconditions that make supernatural beings what they are. The ren of a place - \na city, a continent and so on - \nhas some consequence for each thing that \nresides within it. The following effects discuss this overlap where it’s relevant. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nLEARNING TRUE NAMES \nA basic student of Nomenclature knows three true names. Learning more \nrequires study with an appropriate instructor, and generally a Static Mental \nChallenge against six Traits. The Storyteller may allow the acquisition of a new \nren for three Experience Traits, or fold it into the course of a story with or \nwithout that required expenditure. It takes time to study and master a ren, \nwhich is often complex, and it requires knowledge of how the thing is made and \nfunctions. A mummy must know how to make armor before he can learn the \nren for armor, and so on. Use these categories as guidelines. \nTrue Name \nCategoryRequired \nSimple animal \n(dung beetle, cobra) \nSimple element \n(sand, granite) \nComplex animal \n(ape, cat) \nComplex element \n(steel, diamond) \nSimple hand weapon \n(club, mace) \nSimple projective weapons (bow, sling) \nComplex hand-weapon \n(steel sword, obsidian knife) \nComplex projectile weapon (pistol, crossbow) \nPersonal name \nSimple supernatural name (ghoul, minor spirit) \nComplex supernatural name (vampire, mummy) \nAbility Traits \nAnimal Ken \nScience \nAnimal Ken x 2 or \ngreater \nScience x 2 or greater \nMelee and materials \nAthletics and materials \nMelee x 2 or greater \nand materials \nFirearms and materials \nSubterfuge \nOccult \nOccult x 2 or greater \nand personal name \nBASIC NOMENCLATURE \nASKING THE TREES \nType: Spell \nSekhem: None \nPlants have simple true names, and with asuccessful Social Challenge, the \nscribe needs only simple utterances to make them obey her. This spell allows \nher to command plants to grow rapidly, die off, make simple motions, entangle \na target, flex to hide or reveal tracks, and so on. The commanded plants cannot \nmove around, but they can exert themselves as far as their physical limitations \nallow. This Hekau calls for Survival for its retests. \nBECOMING THE STONE \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThe scribe draws on his mastery of the names for substance and \ntransformation to identify himself with the name of a desired metal or mineral, \nand he makes a Mental Challenge. The transformed self has the same volume \nas before and can occupy any simple continuous form that the scribe chooses. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncapability for movement - \nhe could tip himself over a cliff, but that’s about \nit. The scribe has six Stamina-related Traits and does not need air, and he \ncannot be destroyed, short of someone ripping the stone or metal apart and \nscattering the pieces. Becoming the Stone uses Science for retests. \nSuccess lets the scribe take on a simple form like rough-hewn rock or a pile \nof stones. Spend one additional Mental Trait to allow for precise planes and \nangles, such as those in a collection of cut gemstones, or two Mental Traits for \nthe precision necessary for a few swords or a suit of armor. No additional Traits \nare needed to turn into a fine dust. The transformation lasts for one hour, at the \nend of which the scribe may spend one Sekhem to extend it another hour (and \ncan keep doing so as long as his Sekhem lasts). The mummy may end his \ntransformation any time he likes. \nBECOMING THE TREE \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThe scribe combines the name of a plant and a word to her own body to \nbecomeaspecific typeofliving vegetation (withasuccessfulMentalChallenge). \nThe result has about the same mass as the scribe, so that depending on the plant \nin question, the mummy may become a single tree, a small cluster of bushes, or \na fairly expansive field of grass or seaweed. The transformation takes place \ngradually throughout the duration of the ritual, and lasts for one hour after its \ncompletion. The scribe may spend one Sekhem Trait to extend it for another \nhour (and repeat this as long as her Sekhem lasts), or end it whenever she \nchooses. Reverting to normal form takes one minute. \nWhile in plant form, the scribe retains all her senses (despite the lack of \ncustomary sense organs) and her mental faculties. She can exert only very \nlimited physical motion, such as making grass bend as if in a breeze. On the \nother hand, she is usually very difficult to damage. Note that the plant form has \nthe same health levels and Stamina-related Traits as the scribe usually does. A \nwounded mummy becomes an obviously injured plant, and damage she suffers \nwhile in plant form stays with her after she returns to normal. Becoming the Tree \nuses Suwival for its retests. \nCLOUD THE NAME \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: None \nThis unique Hekau allows a mummy to study a personal ren over the course \nof an hour and join the word of transformation to it, causing the ren to change, \nwith a successful Static Mental Challenge. The scribe has no idea how the \nname will change or the effect it will have on the target. She may be able to \nslightly influence the change for the good or bad, but there’s no guarantee that \nher intent will actually happen. It’s up to the Storyteller to determine how \nCloud the Name has affected the ren in question - \nit may be something as \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsimple as changing a favorite color or preferring a different nickname, or as \nprofound as a shift in general Demeanor. Such minor shifts may have far- \nreaching effects - \nsome occultists believe that changing a name’s spelling or \na preferred color may have a psychic impact - \nbut at the very least, it ensures \nthat the target has a new ren, which must be relearned (even by the scribe). \nClod the Name uses Divination for its retest. \nDue to the potentially unbalancing effects of this Hekau and the difficulty \nof bringing it in play, the Storyteller is within her rights to disallow it in her \nchronicle. \nCOMMAND THE BEAST \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThe scribe speaks an animal’s true name and a word of command, followed \nby a Social Challenge. If successful, the creature follows the mummy’s verbal \ncommands for one hour. The animal does not understand complex commands \nand suffers confusion if its instructions are unclear, though it does its best to \nhonor the mummy’s intent. The mummy can relinquish control at any time \n(after which the animal usually flees), or he can spend one Sekhem to extend \ncontrol for another hour. The mummy must win a contest of Willpower if the \nanimal is under control of some other supernatural entity. This spell retests \nwith Animal Ken. \nFORGETTING THE STONE \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThe scribe utters the true name of a stone or metal, adds a word describing \nthe specific piece he’s targeting, and then speaks a phrase that removes it from \nthe Book of Thoth. That particular piece, up to one cubic yard of material, \nvanishes from existence, never to be seen again. A successful Mental Challenge \nis needed to perform this spell, which uses Science for its retest. \nFORGETTING THE TREE \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThis spell works like Forgetting the Stone on a specific piece of vegetation, \nup to a cubic yard’s worth. Some examples are a wooden door, a stretch of \ngarden, or even a small tree. It uses Survivul for its retest. \nMEND FLESH \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThe mummy speaks the ren of flesh and a word of healing, followed by a \nMental Challenge. If successful, the target immediately regains one health \nlevel, whether lost to bashing, lethal or aggravated damage. The mummy may \nheal additional bashing and lethal damage at the rate of one additional Mental \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncan affect anyone in the scribe’s line of sight, but works only & real living \ntissue. This spell uses Medicine for its retest. \nNAME THE SECRET \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 5 \nSekhem: None \nThe scribe analyzes properties of a target’s true name over the course of \nhours, days or years and identifies hidden qualities of the creature described in \nits true name. Studying a piece of vegetation or an element requires an hour’s \nexamination. The implications of an animal or normal human true name \nrequire a day to study. The true name of a supernatural entity or metaphysical \nconcept (like a spell) can take months to years of study, at the Storyteller’s \ndiscretion. At the end of the study period, the scribe makes a Static Mental \nChallenge. The results in each case depend on the scribe’s focus. A search for \nweakness identifies the target’s weakest aspect or Trait, such as a serious Flaw, \na very low Attribute or comparable vulnerability. A search for hidden strength \nreveals the target’s Willpower rating or an important power that the subject \nhasn’t yet demonstrated. Name the Secret uses Divination for its retest. \nNAMING THE WARNING \nType: Spell \nDifficulty: Varies \nSekhem: None \nThe scribe can force an animal into flight or submission merely by \nspeaking its name and demonstrating her power over it, followed by a Static \nSocial Challenge. An animal commanded to flee makes its best effort to escape, \nbut it fights if cornered; an animal ordered to submit cowers close to the scribe, \nfearful of punishment. \nIt’s easier to affect common animals than animals under supernatural \ncontrol, or the animal forms of supernatural beings - \ntheir true names include \nthe animal nature, and much more, and thus are harder to control. The \ndifficulty for this spell is five Traits for common animals, seven Traits for \nsupernaturally influenced animals, or nine Traits for the animal forms of \nsupernatural beings. Fully intelligent animals have their own individual ren \nand are not affected at all. This spell uses Animal Ken for its retest. \nINTERMEDIATE NOMENCLATURE \nBECOME ANIMAL \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 2 \nThe mummy speaks a word of self, a word of transformation, and the ren \nof an animal, and shifts into that form over the course of the spell (if he \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n- -  \nof animal he wants to become, and it’s difficult to learn the renof mythic beasts, \nextinct species and other exotic animals. He retains his capacity for thought, \nbut relies on the animal’s physical abilities. \nThe mummy can safely stay in animal form up to one day per Balance \nTrait. After that, he must make a Willpower Challenge against the number of \ndays he’s been in animal form each sunrise. A failure reduces his Mental Trait \ntotal and each of his mental abilities by one level. Once this descent begins, it’s \nvery difficult to break out of it. The mummy can attempt one Willpower Test \neach new moon, with a difficulty of nine Traits, to regain his natural form. \nOtherwise, he declines into the animal’s condition permanently. This spell \nuses Animal Ken Ability for its retest. \nUnlike most Nomenclature spells, Become Animal works in the Underworld \nas well as in the material world. \nCOMMAND THOUGHT \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 2 \nThis spell lets the scribe use a thinking being’s ren to compel obedience. \nIf she succeeds in a Mental Challenge, the scribe’s verbal commands become \norders that the subject must carry out to the best of his ability. The target can \nmake a separate Willpower Challenge to try to break free after an order that is \nclearly suicidal or directly contrary to his Nature. Command Thought lasts for \none turn, plus an additional turn for each Mental Trait spent. The scribe must \ncast the spell again to preserve control if she wants to give long-term orders, and \nif the subject is in the middle of an action when the spell lapses, he is under no \nobligation to complete it. Command Thought uses Occult for its retest. \nENSLAVE \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Target’s Willpower \nSekhem: 3 \nThis ritual creates more lasting effects thanCommand Thought, at the cost \nof greater time to prepare and cast. If the Static Social Challenge succeeds, the \ntarget becomes the abject slave of the scribe, devoted to his every whim, even \nto the point of considering suicidal orders and ones counter to the subject’s \nlong-term interests and morals. When not under specific instructions, the \nsubject feels a strong desire to attend to the scribe’s general welfare, and acts \neven without particular orders to keep the scribe safe and prosperous. \nThe effects last for one day, plus an additional day for each Social Trait \nspent. The subject retains full recollection of what happened after the effects \nwear off, but doesn’t automatically realize that the compulsion was magical - \nin fact, he might come up with every other excuse but magic. A mistreated \ntarget almost certainly turns on the mummy in retaliation. This ritual can only \naffect the living, and uses Occult for its retest. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nNAME OF HEKAU \nType: Spell \nDifficulty: 5 for Basic Hekau, 7 for Intermediate Hekau, 9 for Advanced \nSekhem: 1 + target Hekau’s cost \nThis spell requires the scribe to learn the true name of a Hekau or other \npower he knows, by Name the Secret or other means. The mummy speaks the \nHekau’s ren, a word for the particular target, and the word of forgetting, \nfollowed by a Static Mental Challenge. If successful, Name of Hekau cancels \nout the effect of a particular Hekau on that target. If the effect involves \nspending additional Traits or otherwise boosting the basic result, the scribe \nmust spend additional Mental Traits to match. If he spends less than the full \ntotal, he produces a partial negation. For instance, it takes the basic success plus \nfour Traits to neutralize Advanced Potence for one turn, while the basic success \nplus two Traits reduces the target’s effective rating to second Basic Potence. \nThis spell cannot counter the results of other spells that take effect \ninstantly, but leave lasting results, like healing spells. Normally constant \npowers suffer the Name the Hekau penalty for three turns. Treat levels of Blood, \nWillpower and the like as each equivalent to one Sekhem Trait for figuring out \nhow much this spell costs the scribe. If he can speak the incantation, the \nmummy can negate one of his own spells automatically for one Sekhem (even \none such as Become Animal, which he could not normally overcome). This \nHekau uses Occult for its retest. \nHekau \nWHISPERING TO THE HEART \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 1 \nThe scribe looks at her target and speaks a single word to induce apowerful \nemotion - \nfear, lust, anger, love, compassion, hope, despair, boredom and the \nlike - \nand makes a Social Challenge. Each emotion has its own true name that \nthe scribe must learn beforehand. The subject is completely dominated by the \nemotion for one turn and continues to feel it strongly for the next minute. The \nscribe can extend the effect by spending an additional Sekhem each minute. \nFor purposes of challenge, apply the scribe’s Balance rating as a Trait bonus or \npenalty as appropriate. It allows the target to accomplish otherwise difficult or \nimpossible deeds because of the emotion, but also makes it very difficult to resist \nexploits using the emotion. \nWhispers to the Heart can counteract the effects of supernatural persuasion. \nHate, for instance, can negate unnaturally inspired love, while courage can \ncancel out supernatural dread. The scribe may use this spell on herself, but it \naffects only living beings. The spell uses Occult for its retest. \nFORTIFY FLESH \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nSekhem: 2 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nWith a successful Static Mental Challenge, the scribe gives the target’s \nflesh the consistency and hardness of stone. It still looks like flesh, but feels \nstony and provides one level of armor for every two Balance Traits the scribe \npossesses (rounded up). This protection extends to aggravated damage (as well \nas more mundane damage), and lasts until the next sunrise or sunset, whichever \ncomes first. The scribe cannot revoke this spell voluntarily - \nif the subject \nneeds to pierce or cut her skin for whatever reason, the cut must overcome the \nfortified flesh’s resistance. This ritual affects only living physical bodies. It uses \nOccult for its retest. \nNAMING THE BODY’S DESTRUCTION \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Variable \nSekhem: Variable \nIn addition to the unique individual ren that every thinking being \npossesses, generic ren describe each part of the body. This spell lets the scribe \ncombine one of those names with a word of targeting and a word of forgetting \nto make that part of the target’s body wither and disappear, with a successful \nStatic Mental Challenge. The difficulty and cost depend on the organ named. \nTrivial loss (6 Traits, 2 Sekhem): Applies to organs like ears, eyes, hands, \nkneecaps and the like. The victim suffers one level of aggravated damage, but \nthe loss is seldom fatal unless the victim was already close to death. \nSerious loss (7 Traits, 3 Sekhem): Applies to major organs like lungs, \nkidneys, the intestines and other significant chunks of organ tissue. The victim \nsuffers three levels of aggravated damage and needs medical attention to avoid \ndeath. Each turn, until medical help arrives, the victim must succeed in a \nphysical challenge, and failure inflicts a level of lethal damage stemming from \nthe body’s inability to function without the organ. Even once help arrives, it \nmay take a miracle or magic to keep the victim alive. \nCritical loss (8 Traits, 5 Sekhem): Applies to the heart and brain. The \nvictim suffers seven levels of aggravated damage, and most likely dies on the \nspot. If he survives, he must make the per-turn check described above for \nserious losses. \nThis spell bypasses armor and shields that aren’t specifically designed to \nstop spells, and it leaves no external wounds. The missing organ is just gone as \nif it were never there. At the Storyteller’s discretion, visible losses may cost the \nvictim one or more Appearance-related Trait, and have other appropriate side \neffects. A person with no knees, for instance, cannot stand without external \nsupport. \nNote that not all victims suffer equally. A vampire doesn’t need any \ninternal organs but its heart, and a jellyfish has no brain to lose. The Storyteller \nmay adjust critical losses down to serious, and serious losses to trivial, depending \non the specific circumstances. The spell affects only physical bodies, so wraiths \nand other spirits need not fear it. Naming the Body’s Destruction uses the \nMedicine Ability for its retest. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSPEAKING ALL NAMES \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nSekhem: 1 \nThis ritual lets the scribe understand the rudiments of another language \nby analysis of its names. She must have a sample of at least 50 words (at the \nStoryteller’s discretion), and the casting time may double or increase even \nmore for unusually complex, alien and dead languages. A successful Static \nMental Challenge gives the mummy an understanding of basic words and \nphrases. She may spend one Mental Trait for simple conversational fluency, or \ntwo for passable fluency. Note that the scribe also automatically gains the \nknowledge of the language’s term for ren she knows: If she knows the ren for \n“lion,” for instance, she can identify “lion” in the language she’s studying, apart \nfrom her overall mastery of it. This unusual ritual uses Linguistics for its retest. \nADVANCED NOMENCLATURE \nFORGETTING THE PERSON \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 30 \nThis is the consummation of the art of naming applied to destruction. \nWith a successful Static Mental Challenge, the scribe erases a person’s true \nname from the Book of Thoth. All trace of the person vanishes - \nmemories, \nrecords and all. Even those who were closest to the victim remember the now- \nvanished person with only the greatest of effort. This ritual certainly disrupts \nthe balance of the universe and costs the scribe one permanent Balance Trait. \nObviously, the Judges of Ma’at will be very interested to hear the mummy’s \nreasons for using this, and they had better be good ones. So far no scribe has \nfound a way to reverse the ritual’s effects. This ritual uses Occult for its retest. \nPTAH’S WORD \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nSekhem: 8 \nThis ritual marks the opposite end of the naming art from Forgetting the \nPerson, its full creative power. The scribe speaks the name of an inanimate \nobject of mass equal to or less than her own, and if the ritual succeeds (a \nsuccessful Static Mental Challenge), that thing immediately materializes in a \nspace touching her - \nin her hand, underfoot, or adjacent to her, but not inside \nanything or anyone else. Once it appears, as far as the universe is concerned, \nit’s always been there and therefore it cannot be dispelled like other summoned \nobjects. The scribe must know how to make the object in question, and many \nmodem objects have ren that no scribe has yet discovered. Ancient Egyptian \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nOccult for its retest. \nWHISPERS TO THE BODY \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 5 \nThe scribe speaks his own ren and a word of transformation, and turns into \nany form he desires. As long as he can describe the terms of what he wants his \nbody to do, he can attempt the transformation. Stretching, compressing, taking \non someone else’s appearance, turning into a puddle of liquid.. . the possibilities \nare nearly endless. They last for one hour after a successful casting, which \nincludes a successful Mental Challenge. \nThis spell can add up to three levels of armor, whether through toughened \nskin, abnormal flexibility and defensive speed, or some other means, and can \nlet the scribe’s limbs inflict an additional level of lethal damage. Actually \nseparating the body can have serious consequences, though. Use the guidelines \nfor Naming the Body’s Destruction. \nWhispers to the Body works equally well on either side of the Shroud and \nuses Occult for its retest. \nWORD OF AUTHORITY \nType: Spell \nSekhem: 4 \nThe scribe speaks the word for self and the word for authority, taking on the \nmajesty of the pharaohs, ifher Social Challenge is successful. She then speaks one \nsentence. Everyone within earshot (whether she can see them or not) who fails \nto resist must try to obey it to the best of their ability. They have the opportunity \nto resist with a Willpower Challenge; those who do not succeed obey the order \nwithout questionor hesitation. The sentence uttered can be complex, but it must \nbe something that requires the listeners to do something. It cannot be contingent \nor time-delayed. Individuals confronted with the risk of self-destruction or \nviolation of their Nature may make a separate Willpower challenge to break free. \nWord of Authonty uses Leadership for its retest. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nRules are an integral part of any game; they define what characters can \nand cannot do. Only when confrontation does occur are rules necessary to \ngovern those situations. Still, the primary focus of this game is to tell a good \nstory. \nThere comes a time when two or more players come into a conflict that \ncannot be resolved through roleplaying alone. The system detailed in this \nchapter allows for the resolution of conflicts efficiently and quickly. This sort \nof face-off is called a challenge, and it makes for a simple system of conflict \nresolution. In most cases, a Narrator does not even need to be present when \na challenge is played. \nRoleplaying does not necessarily have to end when a challenge begins; \nin fact, roleplaying becomes more important than ever if players intend to \nenjoy a confrontation and avoid disputes. Experienced players can integrate \na challenge into their roleplaying so seamlessly that outsiders don’t even \nknow that anything unusual is going on. At the players’ option, special hand \nsignals can be used to indicate when certain Traits and powers are being \nemployed. \nIn order for this system to work, players need to work together. They have \nto educate each other on the rules and agree on what Traits can be used in a \nchallenge. Compromise and cooperation are the words of the game. Arguments \nover whether or not a particular Trait bid is appropriate wreck the momentum \nand the mood of a game. \nUSING TRAITS \nBefore you can begin to learn how challenges work, you must first \nunderstand what defines a character’s capabilities. A character is created by \nchoosing anumber of adjectives that describe and define him as an individual. \nThese adjectives are called Traits, and they are described fully in Chapter \nThree. These Traits are used to declare challenges against other characters or \nagainst static forces represented by a Narrator. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nINITIAL BID \nA challenge begins with a player “bidding” one of her Traits against her \nopponent. At the same time, she must declare what the conditions of the \nchallenge are - \nlike firing a gun, attacking with a knife or using Hekau. The \ndefender must then decide how she responds. She can either relent immediately \nor bid one of her own Traits. \nWhen players bid Traits against one another, they may use only Traits \nthat could sensibly be used in that situation. This restriction means that a \nplayer can generally use only those Traits from the same category as her \nopponent’s Traits. Most challenges are categorized as Physical, Social or \nMental, and all Traits used in a challenge must be from the same category. \nExperienced players may offer each other more creative leeway, but only by \nmutual agreement. \nIf the defender relents, she loses the challenge automatically. For \nexample, if she were being attacked, she suffers a wound. If she matches the \nchallenger’s bid, the two immediately go to a test. Those Traits bid are put at \nrisk, as the loser of the test not only loses the challenge, but also the Trait she \nbid for the rest of the evening. \nTSTING \nOnce both parties involved in a challenge have bid a Trait, they engage \nin a test. The test itself is not what you may think- the outcome is random, \nbut no cards or dice are used. The two players face off against one another by \nplaying Rock-Paper+Scissors. \nIf you lose the test, you lose the Trait you bid for the duration of the \nsession (usually the rest of the evening). Essentially, you have lost some \nconfidence in your own capabilities and can’t call on them for a while. You \ncan no longer use that Trait effectively, at least until you regain confidence \nin your Traits. \nThe test works like the moment in poker when the cards are turned over \nand the winner is declared. The test produces one of two possible outcomes \n- o n e  player is the victor, or the result is a tie. \nIn the case of a tie, players must then reveal the number of Traits that \nthey currently have available in the category used (Physical, Social or \nMental). The player with the IeastnumberofTraits loses the test and thus the \nchallenge. Note that the number of Traits you’ve lost in previous challenges, \nor lost for any other reason, reduces the maximum number of Traits you can \nbid in ties. You may lie about the number of Traits you possess, but only by \ndeclaring fewer Traits than you actually have -you \nmay never say that you \nhave more Traits than you actually do. Doing so allows you to keep the actual \nnumber of Traits you possess a secret, although doing so may be risky. The \nchallenger is always the first to declare his number of Traits. If both players \ndeclare the same number of Traits, then the challenge is a draw, and both \nplayers lose the Traits they bid. \nExample of Play: Ham& encounters a vampire attempting to drink from a \ncollege student outside a local coffee shop. Ohiously this outrage to Ma’at cannot \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ngo unanswered, and Hamziz shouts a warning to the girl. Both vampire and student \nare distracted, and the student recovers enoughability toke. The vampire, initated \nat his lost meal, turns on Hamziz (“Since you cost me my night’s sustenance, I’ll \nBrutally take it j?om you!”). The Amenti, however, is not afraid and responds \n(“You can try, but I’m Wiry enough to avoid you!”). The two players go to a test, \nand both shoot Rock- \na tie. Now they must declare their total Traits to decide the \ntie. Ham& is more experienced than he looks, and declares he has 12 Physical \nTraits. The vampire gulps and reveals his total offive Traits. Looks like he’ll be going \nhungry tonight.. . . \nROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS \nhowever, they must explain what they are and how they are used. \nADJUDICATION \nIf you have question or argument about the rules or the conditions of a \nchallenge, you need to find a Narrator to make a judgment. Try to remain in \ncharacter while you look for a Narrator. Any interruption in the progress of \nthe story should be avoided if at all possible, so work out problems with other \nplayers if you can. If you do not know the correct application of a certain rule, \nit’s usually better to wing it rather than interrupt the flow of the game. \nIt should be noted that a challenger who fails on a Social or Mental \nChallenge must wait at least five real-time minutes before repeating the failed \nchallenge (and don’t waste them arguing over the results of the previous \nchallenge- you can’t protest aruling with aNarrator for 458, \nthendrop your \nargument and say, “Oh look, time’s up,”). This rule includes supernatural \npowers that use Mental or Social Challenges, unless they specify otherwise. \nA character cannot continue attempting one challenge after another until he \nfinally succeeds. This stricture does not include tests that are failed but then \nredeemed through retests or overbids. \nCOMPLICATIONS \nThere are a number of ways in which a challenge can be made more \ncomplicated. The basic rules are enough to resolve most disputes, but the \nfollowing rules add a few bells and whistles. \nNEGATIVE TRAITS \nMany characters have Negative Traits, Traits that can be used against a \ncharacter by his opponent. During the initial bid of any challenge, after you \nhave each bid one Trait, you can call out a Negative Trait that you believe \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nyour opponent possesses. If he does indeed possess the Negative Trait, your \nopponent is forced to bid an additional Trait, although you must stilt risk your \none Trait as usual. If he does not possess that Negative Trait, you must risk an \nadditional Trait. You may call out as many Negative Traits as you wish during \nthe initial bid phase of a challenge, as long as you can pay the price for being \nwrong. \nIf your opponent does not have additional Traits to bid, then your Trait \nis not at risk during the challenge. Additionally, if you guess more than one \nNegative Trait that your opponent cannot match, you gain that many \nadditional Traits in the case of a tie or an overbid (see page below). The same \nworks in reverse, favoring your opponent if you do not have additional Traits \nremaining to match incorrect Negative Trait guesses. It is considered very \ncheap to list off which Negative Traits a player might possess, if you have no \nvalid reason to suspect as much in-game. \nExample of Play: Shadar, aMesketet, is in the middle ofbuttk with Intisar, \nan Amkhut cannibal cultist. He makes an initial bid (“I make u Ferocious attack \nwith this hundy rake!”), while lntisar kcides to return enmity fur enmity (“I’m \nNimble enough toget out ofthe way!”). S u r  thensuggests that Intisarpossesses \na particular Negative Trait (“I’m amazed you’ve stayed on this long - \nI thought \nyou would have retreated in your usual Cowardly fashion”). Shadar guessed \ncorrectly - \nIntisar does indeed possess that Negative Trait, and now she must bid \nan additional Trait (“Perhaps, but it’s easy to brave when I’m Quick enough to \navoid you”). If Shadar had been wrong, it would huve been up to him to bid an extra \nTrait to continue the challenge. \nIt can be risky to bid Negative Traits, but if you’re sure about what you’re \ndoing, you can raise the stakes for your opponent, possibly to the point where \nshe relents rather than risking additional Traits. \nOVERBIDDING \nOverbidding is the system by which powerful characters may prevail in \nachallenge, even if they lose the initial test. The elder with 16 Physical Traits \nshould be able to crush the whelp who has only three. This system is designed \nto make that possible. \nOnce a test has been made, the loser has the option of calling for an \n“overbid.” In order to call an overbid, you must risk a new Trait; the original \none has already been lost. At this point, the two players must reveal the \nnumber of applicable Traits they possess in the appropriate category, starting \nwith the player who called for the overbid. If you have double the number of \nTraits as your opponent in that category, you may attempt another test. As \nwith a tie, you may state a number of Traits less than the actual number you \nhave and keep your true power secret. Overbidding can be dangerous unless \nyou are confident in your estimation of your opponent’s abilities. \nExample of Play: Edward, a scholar from the Arcunum, suspects there’s \nmure to the new librarian than meets the eye, and he attempts to coax information \nfrom her. He begins with flattery (“My praise is so Beguiling that you ure suitably \nmoved to respond in kind to me”). The librarian, a Khri-hubi named Beth, resists \n(“Oh, please - \nI’m too Dignified to play that kind ofgame”). They test and Beth \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwins, but Edward refuses to give up. He’s noted that Beth is unusuully quiet,and \nsuspects that she is even less sociuIIy apt than his own bookish self, so he blds an \nadditional Trait (“But, dear Miss Beth, I’ve learned how to be quite Persuasive \nwhennecessary”) andcalls for anwerbid. Since Bethis defending, she does not need \nto risk an additional Trait. Edward declares he has eight Social Traits, and Beth \nreveals thut she has six, and the overbid proceeds. They test again, and this time \nEdward wins. Beth loses her Dignified Trait, Edward loses his Beguiling Trait, \nbut he won the final challenge, and Beth is trying to figure out how long she can hold \nout against this nosy gent.. . . \nSTATIC CHALLENGES \nSometimes you may have to undergo a challenge against a Narrator \nrather than against another player. For example, a hacker may use a Static \nMental Challenge with the Computer Ability to break into another computer \nsystem. In such circumstances, you bid a Trait that is appropriate, then \nperform a test against the Narrator. Before the test is made, the Narrator \ndecides on the difficulty of the task that you are attempting - \nthis is the \nnumber of Traits you are bidding against, which is used to compare in the \nevent of a tie. The test proceeds exactly as if you were testing against another \ncharacter. Of course, you may attempt to overbid in a Static Challenge, but \nbeware, because the Narrator can overbid as well. The number of Traits \nattached to the challenge should represent the difficulty and danger inherent \nin the challenge. \nSometimes Narrators may leave notes on objects, such as books, doors or \neven magical items. These notes indicate the type of challenges that must be \nwon for something to occur (such as deciphering a tome or picking a lock). \nSIMPLE TESTS \nSimple Tests are used to determine if you can do something successfully \nwhen there is no real opposition. Most Simple Tests do not require you to risk \nor bid Traits, though some do. \nWhen a Simple Test is called, a test (Rock-Paper-Scissors) is performed \nagainst a Narrator. In most cases, the player succeeds on a win or a tie, \nalthough in some cases, it may be necessary for the player to win for him to \nreceive any benefit from the challenge. \nRETESTS \nCertain Traits allow a character to retest. A retest allows a character to \nignore the results of the first test and test again for a new result. Retests are \nmost commonly gained through Abilities, but other Traits may also provide \nthem; such Traits are noted in their descriptions. Expending one level of an \nappropriate Ability allows for one retest. \nMultiple retests are possible on a single challenge, but each retest must \ncome from a different source. A character may retest a challenge once using \nalevel ofBrawIand thenretest again through theMerit: Lucky (Bes’ Blessing), \nbut he may not gain multiple retests with the Bruwl Ability on the same \nchallenge. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nRetests may be canceled (“blocked”) by a character capable of matching \nthe conditions of the retest. Thus, if a player uses Fiream toretest when firing \na gun, the opponent may expend a level of Dodge to block the retest and force \nthe attacker to accept the results of the original test. \nExample of Play: Kalem, an Amkhut cultist, is holding Rebecca, a human \nreporter, hostage, hoping to lure her Amenti lower into rescuing her. Rebecca, \nhowever, is not a shrinking wiolet, and when Kukm is distracted by an outside noise, \nshe takes the opportunity to grab the gun from his hand (“While you’re distracted, \nI’ll Quickly grab your pistol!”), Kalem responds by trying to keep hold of his prize \n(“No you don’t! I’m Brawny enough to hung on!”). They perfm a test, and \nKalem loses. Nowarned, Rebeccaseeks tofireashot (“Now, 1’11 use theudvantuge \nof my Clever planning to shoot you!”), but Kalem is seeking cover (“I use my \nNimble refixes toget behindsomefurniture!”) . Another testfollows, and this time \nRebecca loses. But she has hundled a gun before (“I know enough about Firearms \nnot to let you get away!”), and she calls fw a retest. The two test again, and chis \ntime she wins. Kakm howls in pain from the bullet he takes in his left leg. \nKalem tries to take back his gun (“My leg hurts like anything, but I’m still \nDexterous enough to take the gun from you.”). Rebecca bucks away instead, \nwanting mly to get away ( “The door’s behind me, and I’m Quickly retreating! ”) , \nand the two make another test. Kulem loses, and immediately calls for aretest with \nBrawl (“I’m not afraid to Brawl with anyone, especially a woman!”). Rebecca \nblocks the retest with Dodge (“That may be, but I’ll still Dodge you!”), and no \nretest is mude. Rebecca, still armed, has now got her back to the door and is trying \nto get out. \nRELENTING \nAt any time before the actual test is performed, a player may choose to \nadmit defeat. Characters who relent lose the challenge automatically, but \nthey do not lose any Traits, even if they bid one before relenting. They also \nhelp the game flow along more smoothly than extended Rock+Paper-Scissors \nmatches do. \nBONUS TRAITS \nCertain weapons and special powers grant a character bonus Traits \nduring a challenge. You may add these extra Traits toward a character’s total \nwhen determining a tie involving that weapon or special Ability. \nORDEROF CHALLENGES \nSince multiple challenges inevitably occur simultaneously during any \ngiven fight, the Narrator needs some means of determining who acts first and \nwho acts last. Each person involved in a given game-turn checks the current \nnumber of Traits appropriate to the action he wishes to attempt. A character \npunching someone uses Physical Traits to determine speed, while a character \ncasting a spell probably uses Mental Traits. If an action does not require any \nsort ofTrait challenge, it occurs last in the turn. As with overbidding, you may \ndeclare fewer Traits than you possess if you wish. Characters with equal \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nnumbers of Traits are assumed to go “simultaneously,” though for resolution \npurposes, the Narrator may simply choose one to act first. \nSometimes a character with a high number of Traits attacks a character \nwith fewer Traits, who will decide to strike back. In this case, the character \nwith fewer Traits resolves his action in the same test as the faster character, \nbut in doing so, he loses the ability to take any aggressive action for the turn \n-he \nuses up his one action with the counterattack. \nThis rule can occasionally cause as much confusion as it’s trying to solve, \nand the Narrator may choose to apply this only when there is a debate or other \ncritical need to establish who’s going first. \nExample of Play: Kalem is still in pursuit of Rebecca, knowing that she’s his \nbest chance of catching the Amenti. Just then, Shadar, the would-be prey, makes \nhis way into the house and comes on the scene with Rebecca and Kakm. Kalem has \nseven Traits left and Shudur (though windedfrom his earlier battle with Intisar) has \nnine Traits. Shudur leaps in front of Rebecca, blocking her from Kalem (“I’m too \nStalwart for you to pass me!”), and Kalem, suddenly feeling hungry, decides to \nattack his meal right then (Til Ferociously take some of your flesh for my \nhunger!”). They go to a test, and S M r  loses, sufferinga bite wound. Kalem has \nused up his action for this turn by attacking Shadar, so he can’t do anything else at \nthe moment. Rebecca, meanwhile, ispreparingtoshoot thecultistaguin, hopingthut \nit won’t require “third time’s the cham” to put him doeon.. . . \nTHE MOB SCENE \nSooner or later, a large group of characters decides to mix it up. Group \nchallenges seem intimidating even to experiencedNarrators and Storytellers, \nbut these rules are meant to streamline the process and make such situations \neasier to resolve, rather than devolving into endless matches of Rock-Paper- \nScissors. \nFirst of all, find who is challenging whom. The easiest way is to count to \nthree and have everyone point to the person they wish to target that turn. If \nno one is being challenged by more than one person, then challenges are \ncarried out normally. \nIf one character is challenged by several targets, or tries to challenge \nmultiple opponents at once, resolve it in the following manner. First deal with \ngroups in the order of largest to smallest, just for ease of play. Each attacker \nmust bid an appropriate Trait as normal for the challenge required; logistics \nput a limit of up to five characters attacking another character at once. \nNext, the defender character must bid enough Traits to counter every \nopponent in the group; if he does not have enough Traits, he must relent to \nthe rest of his opponents (although he may choose which ones he relents to). \nResolve such relented challenges first - \nit is very possible that the defender \nmay fall before the rest of the group can act! \nFinally, the defender and any remaining attackers engage in one \nsimultaneous test. The defender then compares his sign to each of the \nattacker’s signs, applying the appropriate results. Thus, if the defending \ncharacter throws Scissors and his attackers throw Rock, Scissors, Paper and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nPaper, the defender is considered to have lost to the first challenger, tied the \nsecond (resolved like any other tie) and beaten the last two. The defenders \nand attackers lose Traits bid in any given loss. If the defender in the previous \nexample had bid one Trait against every attacker, he would have lost one \nTrait to the first attacker, and an additional Trait if he had lost the tie as well. \nOnce the tests have been made, they are resolved in the standard order \nof actions and initiative. It is possible for a defender to lose Traits to the first \nattackers and then lose a tie to an attacker later in the same mob challenge. \nThat’s OK - \nthe first attackers “softened up” the defender. However, unless \nthe defender has a special power which allows him to take multiple actions, \nhe may only attempt to injure one of his attackers, and it must be one who lost \na challenge. If none of the attackers lose, the defender simply suffers the \nresults of their actions. \nWhen the defender in a mob challenge uses Abilities or other powers to \ngain retests, each attacker’s challenge is treated as a separate test. Thus, a \ndefender needs five Melee Traits in order to retest against five attackers in a \nmelee combat. \nTIME \nTime inMind’s Eye Theatre works as it does in real life. It moves forward \ninexorably, relentlessly. For the most part, everything is played out in real \ntime, and players are expected to stay in character unless they have a rules \nquestion. \nIt is assumed that a player is always “in character” during the course of a \nstory. A player should never drop character when interacting with other \nplayers. Doing so ruins the atmosphere for everyone involved. Challenges \nmay be talked through, but a player is always considered to be active in the \ngame. If a player needs to take a break, he should inform a Narrator. That \nplayer should not interact with any of the other players while out of character. \nThe only other exception to the “in-character rule” is when a Narrator \ncalls for a “timeout.” This call may be necessary to resolve a dispute or to \nchange the scene if the story callsfor it. When“Timeout!” is called, all players \nwithin hearing distance must stop whatever they are doing until the Narrator \ncalls “Resume” or “Lay on!”Timeouts should be kept to a minimum since they \ninterrupt the flow of the story. \nCHRONICLES. STORIES. SESSIONS AND SCENES \nMind’s Eye Theatre time breaks down into five major allotments: \nchronicles, stories, sessions, scenes and turns. A chronicle is defined as a series \nof smaller stories that are all connected somehow, and which may take \nmonths or years to complete. Each complete plotline within the chronicle is \ncalled a story. A session is just that: one actual night of play, although \nStorytellers may define a session as one night of game time if the action was \nleft inmediares at the end of the previous game. (Since many characters regain \nspent Traits in-between sessions, this distinction can be important.) A scene \nis the time it takes to resolve the action in one location. Once the characters \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nshift locations, the scene has ended. If a session is to take place entirely at one \nlocation, a scene can then be defined as roughly one hour. \nTURNS \nTo keep everything straight when players start throwing challenges \naround or attempting complex actions, the time is right to start using turns. \nTurns are considered to last about four seconds, although this measure may \nvary from challenge to challenge at the Storyteller’s discretion. In any given \nturn, a character may take one action. Some actions may take multiple turns \nto complete, such as hacking a sophisticated computer system. Other actions, \nlike speaking a short sentence, do not use up a character’s turn at all. Once \neveryone involved in a turn has taken an action, the turn ends and another \nbegins. \nIn some instances a character may be interrupted before he can take his \naction, or be forced to respond to events developing around him. In such \ninstances, a character may always defend himself, although doing so uses up \nhis available action for the turn. \nIf a power affects a character for 15 seconds, it is assumed to be in effect \nfor four turns when turn-based time is in effect. In normal roleplaying, such \npowers work for their allotted amount of time. \nDOWNTIME \nMany aspects of a character’s unlife are critical to her continued \nexistence, yet they do not make for dramatic roleplaying, or they are too \nintricate to take time during sessions to perform. Storytellers are encouraged \nto use “downtime” between sessions to allow characters to maintain their \nholdings, learn Disciplines and see to other facets of their existence. Other \nactions and interactions may take place during this time, with Storyteller \nsupervision. As long as players don’t abuse downtime privileges, the time \nbetween sessions can be a rewarding roleplaying experience in itself. \nCOMBAT \nThe basics of combat are simple. As with any other challenge, the \nparticipants agree on the opposing possible outcomes, each player bids an \nappropriate Trait, and they perform a test to determine the victor. What \nfollows are the complications that distinguish combat from other challenges. \nThe most common outcome of a combat challenge is that the loser takes \nthe damage suitable for the attacker’s choice of weapon and supporting \nfactors, such as damage-enhancing magic. This isn’t the only possible \noutcome, however. The participants may agree that victory includes wrestling \nan opponent to the ground, or subduing a target rather than hurting him, or \njust about anything else that can happen in a fight. \nSURPRISE \nA player who does not respond within three seconds of the declaration \nof a combat challenge is considered to have been surprised. The declaration \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmust occur in a way that the target has a fair chance to notice. It’s not \nwhispered or mumbled while looking in another direction, or hurriedly \ninterjected while the player is clearly in the midst of something else. The \nStoryteller has the final say in cases where players disagree about whether this \ncondition has been met. The Storyteller may also award surprise outright to \na sufficiently clever and suitable ambush - \nsometimes the target just doesn’t \nreally have a chance to detect it. \nIf the attacker achieves surprise, his target doesn’t get a counterattack, \nand the challenge merely determines whether the attacker inflicts his chosen \nharm or not. If the challenger loses this test, he may bid another Trait and call \nfor a second challenge. After this second challenge, normal exchanges \nresume. \nMOVEMENT IN COMBAT (THREE-STEP RULE) \nAnyone who has just entered combat or who is already involved in \ncombat is limited to three steps in any turn in which he wishes to attack. A \ncharacter taking a single step walks cautiously. Taking two steps means the \ncharacter is moving directly, and taking three steps means the character is \nrunning. In any case, the character suffers a -1 Trait penalty on physical \nchallenges that turn. An effect allowing the character to take an additional \naction allows him another three steps. \nFAIR ESCAPE \nThis rule provides a simple way for characters to escape from potentially \ndangerous situations. A player may call “Fair Escape!” upon noticing the \napproach of another player with whom he does not wish to interact, and may \nthen leave the area without being pursued. There are several limits on this: \nFair Escape does not let you evade someone within conversational \ndistance. Ifshe’s that close, you must initiate achallenge to flee. Conversational \ndistance may be farther than you can actually hear someone’s voice at regular \nvolume at the moment, if the environment is particularly noisy. \nFair Escape does not let you evade ranged weapons, or ambushes in \nwhich all the exits are blocked, or situations in which you’re surrounded. \nCommon sense applies here: There must be some place to escape to as well \nas notice of the impending attack. \nA character with invisibility or other concealing effects may call Fair \nEscape at any time before a challenge has been initiated, unless someone with \nmagical perception spots him. \nA character with supernatural speed may gain Fair Escape by activating \nthe speed effect before a challenge is initiated. If pursuer and pursued both \nhave supernatural speed, whoever has the highest level wins, and all ties go \nto the fleeing party. \nIn general, the longer and more convoluted an explanation of why Fair \nEscape should apply, the more likely it shouldn’t. This rule is intended to \nsimplify play, and the Storyteller is the final arbiter as to its applicability in \nany particular instance. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nWEAPONS \nNo real weapons are allowed in Mind’s Eye Theatre games, and this \nprohibition extends to nonfunctional props that can be mistaken for weapons. \nThis system does not require weapon props of any kind, nor are players \nallowed to actually strike each other to simulate combat. Use index cards to \nkeep track of the Traits and details of particular weapons and act out the \ncombat as much as necessary for everyone to understand what’s going on \nwithin the limits of the basic MET principles. \nA weapon gives its wielder extra Traits to use in combat and other \nrelevant challenges, and may also confer Negative Traits or other limitations. \nThe wielder cannot bid the weapon’s Traits when making a challenge. They \nadd to his Trait total when comparing Traits with his opponent in the case \nof ties and overbids. In addition, some weapons add other bonuses, such as \ninflicting extra levels of damage or affecting more than one target at a time. \nThe weapon regard records all this information, and a player is considered to \nbe carrying a weapon when he has its card in hand. \nEvery weapon has the following properties: \nConcealability: The extent to which the weapon can be hidden. If a \ncharacter lacks the necessary clothing or cover to hide a particular weapon, \nhe must have the card for it on display at all times. \nAvailability: The amount of effort required to find a weapon and \nacquire it for use. A character who lacks the necessary influence cannot get \na hard-to-find weapon, without the intervention of someone who does have \nthe appropriate connections. Note that characters don’t automatically get to \nkeep and use weapons forever without fear of consequences. The police do \ncheck on exotic weapons, and do investigate killing sprees by unusual means. \nCharacters who abuse powerful weaponry should expect trouble to follow. \nSome weapons also have one or more of the following special abilities: \nArmor-Piercing: Armor-piercing weapons do not inflict extra damage, \nbut do ignore any armor that doesn’t specifically list the ability to block them. \nLegal inquiries almost always follow the use of armor-piercing ammunition, \neven by authorized individuals. \nDestroy Shield: Shields are rare in the modem day, at least in the \nliving world, but they’re not unheard of. A weapon capable of destroying a \nshield penetrates it automatically and renders it useless after a specified \nnumber of blows, listed with each weapon. \nFully Automatic: A weapon capable of many rounds in very short \norder. An attack with a weapon in full-auto mode does an extra level of \ndamage from sheer volume of fire. The shooter must then spend one action \nreloading the weapon before firing it again, since full-auto fire empties the \nentire clip of ammunition. \nHigh-Caliber: Weapons with larger than usual barrels can fire larger \nthan usual bullets. When high-caliber fire strikes the target, the attacker \nmakes a Simple Test. If it succeeds, the target suffers an additional level of \ndamage. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nIncendiary: Burning weapons inflict aggravat \nexcept those who have some specific means of resisting fire. Flame-throwers \nand Molotov cocktails spray burning liquid or gas, while incendiary \nammunition bursts into flames when shot, or upon striking the target. \nMass Trauma: These weapons tear away large portions of the target’s \nflesh and inflict an extra level of damage by doing so. \nSpeed: Fast weapons can preempt an opponent’s attack. Only characters \nwith the Melee ability can use this weapon capability, and the character must \nbe attacking with or actively using the weapon to get this benefit. Fast \nweapons gain a preemptive strike only against opponents in hand-to-hand or \nmelee combat, and the enemy must have a weapon with the Negative Trait \nof Slow, Heavy, or Clumsy. In this case, the fast weapon confers a benefit \nmuch like surprise. First make a challenge to see whether the faster attacker \nsucceeds in damaging the target, then (if the defender is still in a position to \ncounterattack) make a separate challenge to determine the results of the \ncounterattack. A fast attack that disarms, kills, or neutralizes the defender \nleaves him unable to act. \nSpray: The weapon can strike several targets at once, as listed for each \nspecific weapon. Make one test against all the targets simultaneously. Each \ntarget who fails this test suffers the weapon’s damage. The shooter risks only \nthe Traits required to test against each member of the group, and loses a Trait \nfor each defender who wins her individual challenge to resist. \nOpponents in hand-to-hand and melee challenges each bid Physical \nTraits. Characters using firearms may choose to bid Mental Traits instead. \nThis one is an exception to the general rule of like Traits bid against each \nother. \nWEAPON EXAMPLES \nThis list is not exhaustive. Storytellers and players should use it as a basis \nfor comparison when coming up with weapons not covered here. \nMELEE WEAPONS \nKnife/Dagger - \nThis is the whole family of small, readily concealed \nweapons that inflict damage via sharpened edges and points. Characters with \nthe Athletics ability can throw them as well as use them in hand-to-hand \ncombat. Many tem-akh, particularly those withmartial backgrounds, remember \nusing these for both ceremonial and practical purposes. \nBonus Traits: 1 \nNegative Traits: Short \nConcealability: Pocket \nDamage: one lethal \nAvailability: Any \nSpecial Ability: Speed \nBroken Bottle - One of many improvised weapons; use this as a \nguideline for grabbing random handheld artifacts and using them in a fight. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nBonus Traits: 1 \nNegative Traits: Fragile \nConcealability: Vest (but it's likely to hurt) \nDamage: one lethal \nAvailability: Any \nCane/Club/Axe - \nThis category covers all handheld weapons with \nwhich the attacker bludgeons his opponent, whether or not the weapon has \nan edge to enhance the damage. Mummies recovering from damage left \nunhealed during the resurrection challenge often keep canes handy, since \nthey provide support as well. \nBonus Traits: 1 (Cane), 2 (Club), or 3 (Axe) \nNegative Traits: Clumsy; many canes are also Fragile \nConcealability: Trenchcoat \nDamage: one bashing (Cane/Club) or two lethal (Axe) \nAvailability: Any; particularly omate canes may be expensive and \ndistinctive \nSpecial Ability: Destroy Shield (Axe) -Axes render shields useless after \nthree blows. \nNunchaku - \nThis category covers not only actual nunchaku, but also \nother weapons designed to deliver crushing damage with weighted implements \nlinked by chains or cords. Some are also bladed. \nBonus Traits: 2 \nNegative Traits: Short \nConcealability: Jacket \nDamage: one lethal \nAvailability: Any \nSpecial Ability: Speed \nStaff/Spear - \nThese weapons are long, with or without a sharp tip, and \nfavored by some ancient armies and many lone wanderers of the ancient \nworld. They're cheap and easy to make. \nBonus Traits: 3 \nNegative Traits: Clumsy; spears are also Heavy \nConcealability: none \nDamage: two bashing (Staff) or three lethal (Spear) \nAvailability: Any martial arts store, though spears cost much more than \nstaves and it's near impossible to justify carrying spears in policed areas. \nFencing Blade - \nFencing was not part of the Egyptian tradition, but \nsome tem-akh watched it done while in the Underworld, and some modem \nmen and women practice it, mostly as a form of exercise. Serious combat \nweapons are thicker and heavier than tournament weapons, and it takes a \nlittle practice to compensate. This category also includes the katana, invested \nby some warriors and more would-be warriors with far more power and \nsignificance than it actually ever possesses. Like Western fencing blades, the \nkatana depends more on speed than strength for its effectiveness. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nBonus Traits: 2 \nNegative Traits: Fragile \nConcealability: Trenchcoat \nDamage: one lethal \nAvailability: Any. Tournament weapons require less explanation than \ncombat-ready weapons. Handcrafted katana and other fast swords are usually \nthe property of someone who doesn't want to give them up, and who will try \nto get them back. \nSpecial Ability: Speed \nShortsword - \nThis category covers all blades up to about 18 inches long \nthat are designed primarily for thrusting (including the gladius, scuta, jiann, \nand similar weapons). They are not common in the modem age, but were \nubiquitous in ancient times. Almost any tem-akh with any combat experience \nat all has some familiarity with shortswords. \nBonus Traits: 2 \nNegative Traits: Short \nConcealability: Trenchcoat \nDamage: one lethal \nAvailability: Any. Note that blade strength counts for less with shortswords \nthan it does with broadswords, and even replicas can deliver one or a few \nuseful blows if sharpened. \nBroadsword - \nThe archetypal melee weapon, it is a medium-length \nsword intended to stab, hack, or both. Broadswords make good vehicles for \npoisons and toxins, and are popular among enchanters as well. \nBonus Traits: 3 \nNegative Traits: Heavy \nConcealability: Trenchcoat (with - 1 Trait penalty to concealment \nDamage: two lethal \nAvailability: Broadswords must usually be special order, though cheap \nand unreliable ones can be found at military supply stores and Renaissance \nfestivals. At the Storyteller's discretion, they suffer from the Negative Trait \nof Fragile, as well as the standard Heavy. \nARCHAIC RANGED WEAPONS \nchallenges) \nLongbow -These \nhuge, powerful weapons pierce many kinds of armor. \nThey also take significant expertise to use effectively. Use the Athletics \nAbility for retests when using bows, and characters who lack Athletics receive \nonly one third of the usual bonus Traits, rounded down, thanks to their \ndifficulty in shooting well. Modem compound-bows are smaller, with pulley \nsystems to enhance the archer's pull. They do not have the Negative Trait of \nClumsy, but they give only five bonus Traits. \nBonus Traits: 6 \nNegative Traits: Fragile, Clumsy, Heavy \nConcealability: None \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDamage: two lethal \nAvailability: Any \nSpecial Ability: Armor-Piercing - \nLongbows ignore chain armor and \nballistic vests; Destroy Shield - \none shot from a longbow renders a shield \nuseless. \nDart - \nThe Egyptian Army used these thrown weapons. The category \nalso includes shuriken and other sharp hurled objects. \nBonus Traits: 1 \nNegative Traits: Clumsy (darts are notoriously inaccurate beyond short \nConcealability: Pocket \nDamage: one lethal \nAvailability: Any \nSpecial Ability: Spray - \ndarts may be thrown in groups that can strike \nmultiple targets, if the thrower has at least one level of Athletics.

Mass-Trauma - \nshotgun \nblasts inflict an extra level of damage to a single target within five feet. \nSubmachine Gun -This \ncategory of weapons allows the shooter to fire \neither single bullets or rapid bursts, making them favorites in situations where \nprecision isn’t as important as being able to count on hitting targets quickly. \nLaws in most jurisdictions require them to be sold in a configuration that \nallows only for single-shot fire, but anyone with Technology can make a static \nphysical challenge against 5 Traits to convert them to fully automatic fire. \nBonus Traits: 2 \nNegative Traits: Loud \nConcealability: Jacket \nDamage: two lethal \nAvailability: Any, if registered and non-automatic; otherwise, Police 4, \nStreet 4, or Underworld 3 \nSpecial Ability: Spuy - \na submachine gun may hit up to five targets \nstanding within apace of each other and more than 10 feet from the shooter. \nFully Automatic - \na submachine gun inflicts an extra level of damage if the \nshooter empties the entire clip in a target no more than five feet away. \nARMOR \nArmor adds health levels, which get used up before the character suffers \nany damage herself. Not all armor protects against all weapons, of course, as \nnoted in descriptions above. In addition, the protection armor provides \ncomes at a cost, imposing one or more Negative Traits on the wearer. \nWhen a piece of armor loses all of its health levels, it’s temporarily \nrendered useless. Fixing it requires the proper tools and a Static Physical \nChallenge against 6 Traits with the appropriate Crafts specialization. \nChain armor - \nThis covers most medium armor, including scale and \nbrigandine. It’s rare in the modem age and made only by specialists. \nHealth Levels: 2 \nNegative Traits: Heavy \nAvailability: Any; it must be custom-made, and usually costs anywhere \nfrom $500 up to several thousand. \nPlate armor - \nThese omate suits of interlocking metal plates provide \nexcellent protection at a high cost in mobility. They are very expensive and \nhard to come by. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nHealth Levels J \nNegative Traits: Heavy, Clumsy \nAvailability: Any; plate mail is almost always custom-made, and starts at \naround $3000. \nBallistic vest - \nPopular usage calls this sort of vest “bulletproof,” but \nthat’s wishful thinking. It spreads around the damage from most bullets, and \nis relatively easy to conceal under an outer shirt or jacket. It also requires \nmuch less justification than archaic armor does when authorities notice it. \nHealth Levels: 2 \nNegative Traits: Heavy \nAvailability: Police 4 or Underworld 3 \nReinforced armor - \nThis sort of full-body armor is the standard \nequipment for riot-specialist police and some military troops. It cannot be \nconcealed and always attracts attention. \nHealth Levels: 3 \nNegative Traits: Heavy, Clumsy \nAvailability: Police 5 or Underworld 4 \nCOMBAT COMPLICATIONS \nMELEE AND BRAWLING \nHand-to-hand fighting occurs when the combatants can actually reach \neach other with their weapons. Characters must have the Melee Ability to \ntake advantage of their weapons’ special features. Brawling occurs when the \ncombatants reach each other directly. They may attempt maneuvers as \ncomplicated as they wish, but the outcome of any brawl challenge is one level \nof bashing damage, unless the character possesses a power or special ability \nthat specifically increases hand-to-hand damage. \nCharacters with fighting styles bought as Melee or Brawl specializations \nmay make complex maneuvers. The player must describe how the character \nmoves to justify retests; these specializations don’t allow for increased \ndamage, however. \nRANGED COMBAT \nRanged combat happens at a distance. The attacking player declares his \ncharacter’s action in some suitable way, like an emphatic “Bang !”or “Twang!” \nto match the nature of the weapon, and then goes over to the target and \nengages in a challenge. The target must have a ranged weapon of her own to \ncounterattack, until and unless she manages to close the distance. A target \naware of the attack before it happens, and with a ranged weapon of her own, \nis not considered surprised. The first challenge is resolved normally. \nParticipants in range combat can duck for cover. If they manage to \nconceal themselves mostly or entirely from their opponents while remaining \nable to fire themselves, each combat receives one bonus Trait thanks to this \ncover. Cover Traits cannot be bid in challenges, but apply when determining \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ntotals for resolving ties and overbids. A Storyteller or Narrator can adjudicate \ndisputes about what effective cover is available in a particular scene. Especially \nsturdy or otherwise resilient cover, like a pile of boulders with gaps through \nwhich a combatant can shoot, may count as two or even more Traits. A \ncombatant completely under cover cannot be hit at all, but then he can’t \nattack, either. \nMULTIPLE WEAPON USE \nAttacking with a weapon in each hand is possible but hard. Every task \nthe character performs with the off hand suffers a -2 Trait penalty; the player \nmust bid three Traits to initiate the challenge and enjoys a reduced chance \nof success. Characters can choose Two-Weapon Combat and Florentine \nFighting as fighting styles. They remove one-penalty Trait for challenges \nwithin that form. \nThe Storyteller can veto some two-weapon styles. Two pistols and two \nshortswords make sense. Two spears and two submachine guns don’t. \nDAMAGE AND HEALING \nCharacters in Laws of the Resurrection games have health levels to \nrepresent their capacity for taking damage. Nine levels mark a character’s \nprogressive decline to the brink of death: Healthy, Healthy, Bruised, Bruised, \nBruised, Wounded, Wounded, Incapacitated, Mortally Wounded. Acharacter \nwho begins a fight with all levels intact, who loses two levels to damage, \nbecomes Bruised. If he loses three more, she becomes Wounded, and so on. \nDamaged characters suffer penalties to all challenges, as follows: \nHealthy: A Healthy character is not impaired. She may suffer cosmetic \nimpairments, like being scratched up, but it is purely a matter of roleplaying. \ni \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n-.-- \nBruised: A Bruised character is noticeably slower. She suffers a one- \nTrait penalty on all challenges, and the player must therefore bid an extra \nTrait whenever a challenge arises. \nWounded: A Wounded character is seriously injured. She suffers a \none-Trait penalty on all challenges, as does a Bruised character, and her \nopponent wins on all ties regardless of who has more Traits. If the injured \ncharacter has a power that enables her to win all ties, she resolves ties through \ncomparing Traits instead. Note: A character may always attempt to overbid. \nIncapacitated: An Incapacitated character falls unconscious and is \ncompletely out ofplay for at least 10 minutes. Once she regains consciousness, \nshe is effectively immobilized and may only whisper short, pained sentences. \nShe may not enter into challenges and is at the mercy of others until she \nregains at least one health level. If she takes one more level of bashing \ndamage, she’s knocked out again for one hour, though she’s not in any further \nrisk, except from prolonged bashing attacks. One more level of lethal or \naggravated makes her fall to the next level. \nAPPROACHING DEATH \nMortal characters have one additional level beyond Incapacitated: \nMortally Wounded: A Mortally Wounded character has little time \nleft. She does not regain consciousness without outside assistance, and she \nloses a Physical Trait every 10 minutes. When she runs out of Physical Traits, \nshe dies. Only the application of the Medicine Ability or healing magic can \narrest this decline, and even so, the character cannot begin to heal until she \nis taken to a hospital or treated with powerful magic. \nAmenti have five levels beyond Incapacitated. Keep track of them, as \nthey govem how hard the mummy has to work to restore his body to health \nafter his next resurrection. The additional levels are: \nBroken/Scorched: The mummy’s extremities are mangled, he has lost \nsignificant quantities of soft tissue, and/or he has suffered serious bums. \nCrushed/Burned: The mummy has suffered multiple broken bones \nand/or significant damage to multiple internal organs. \nDismembereflncinerated: The mummy has lost one or more limbs or \nhad them severely pulped, or he has been ripped apart, and/or has suffered \nthird-degree bums all over his body. \nPulverizedKremated: The mummy’s entire body has been crushed, \nmangled or burnt, or she has lost all of her skin and significant amounts of \nunderlying tissue. \nDust/Ash: Nothing solid remains of the character beyond dust, ash or \na fine red mist. \nTYPES OF DAMAGE \nAll injuries do not inflict equal harm. A kick in the jaw kills fewer people \nthan a knife in the gut does, for instance. Laws of the Resurrection \ndistinguishes between three kinds of damage: \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nBashing damage: Damage that is the result of any injury that hurts but \nfades quickly. Most damage inflicted by the unaided human body is bashing, \nas is most damage delivered by blunt instruments like clubs. It’s hard to kill \nsomeone with bashing damage. Once a character reaches Incapacitated via \nbashing damage, additional levels of bashing damage are converted to lethal \nand start working down the damage track a second time. That is, it takes nine \nadditional levels of bashing damage to reduce an Incapacitated character to \nMortally Wounded status. \nLethal damage: Damage that is the result of attacks intended to kill and \nrakes a long time to heal. Knives and guns deliver lethal damage, as do strong \npoisons. Lethal damage takes a character down to Mortally Wounded much \nmore quickly than bashing damage. \nThe boundary between bashing and lethal damage is somewhat flexible. \nOne person beating a mummy with his fists does bashing damage, but a whole \ngang stomping a helpless character may, at the Storyteller’s discretion, deliver \nlethal damage because of the total impact of their assault. \nAggravated damage: Damage that leaves major, permanent injury. \nFire does aggravated damage, as do magical weapons, and the teeth or claws \nof supernatural monsters. Sufficiently strong damage from other sources, such \nas receiving a whole clip of automatic-rifle bullets at short range, may also be \nconsidered aggravated (at the Storyteller’s discretion). \nPOISON AND DISEASE \nMummies can catch diseases and suffer from poisoning just like mortals, \nthough mummies have the advantage of being able to return to life later. \nMost toxins and illnesses inflict bashing damage, though particularly \ndeadly ones do lethal damage. Only supernatural sources like Alchemy- \ncreated potions can inflict aggravated damage on mummies. Each poison and \ndisease has a toxin rating, which is the level of damage it inflicts, and a B or \nL to indicate whether the damage is bashing or lethal. Poisons do their toxin \nrating in damage every minute, while diseases do theirs in damage every day. \nMedical treatment and Supernatural means can neutralize the toxin and cure \nthe damage done. \nToxin Rating \nPoison \n1 \nalcohol (B), cocaine (B) \n2 \nfood poisoning (B), \nmethanol (L) \n3 \nptomaine (B) \nammonia (L) \nbleach (L) \nstrong acidsbases (L) \ncyanide (L) \nDisease \ncold (B) \nchicken pox (B), \nmeasles (L) \ninfluenza (B), \npneumonia (L) \ntuberculosis (L) \nAIDS, cancer (L) \nBlack Death (L) \nEbola (L) \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nFIRE \nFire inflicts aggravateddamage onmummies, just as it does everyone else. \nMummies aren’t any more susceptible to fire than normal living people, and \nthey can use it as a weapon just as mortals can. Fire in the physical world \ndamages a mummy’s spirit only if he’s manifested in the living world when it \nstrikes him. \nTRUE DEATH \nMummies cannot normally fall below the DustlAsh level no matter how \nmuch damage is inflicted. It takes unusual circumstances to wipe out all of a \nmummy from existence permanently, including: \nNo will to live: A mummy reduced to zero permanent Willpower \nTraits fades to oblivion and her khat crumbles. \nMagic: Hekau like Forgetting the Person erases the mummy’s body and \nsoul from existence. A mage can use a Master PrimelMaster Spirit rote to \nremove the mummy’s pattern from the Tapestry. It is always vulgar magic. \n(See Laws of the Ascension for details.) \nComplete atomic disintegration: A mummy at ground zero of anuclear \nblast, thrown into a star, or otherwise subjected to direct nuclear force is \nsimply annihilated physically, leaving her soul trapped permanently in the \nUnderworld. \nThe Elixir of Oblivion: Rumor says that there’s a mystical poison or \nlost Alchemy effect that dissolves the bonds created by the Spell of Life. No \none claiming to be able to make it has spoken up so far - \nit’s always the work \nof someone else’s uncle’s friend’s colleague. \nSelf-destruction: Eternal life is not compulsory for mummies. A \nmummy who commits suicide, intending to die truly and permanently, may \ndo so and is not reborn. Sacrificial acts of bodily death performed without the \nintent to end it all forever allow the mummy to be reborn as usual. \nImprisoned khat: A clever foe can put a mummy’s khat where it will \nsuffer continual damage, like the heart of an active volcano, and thereby \nprevent the mummy from ever fully recovering. The mummy’s soul remains \nfree to roam the Underworld in search of a solution, and a mummy with \nsufficient Ku Background Traits may in time find fate intervening to free her \nkhat. \nDERANGEMENTS \nMummies are not often subject to insanity, but their friends, lovers and \nothers around them are, and some Hekau may induce temporary insanity. The \nStoryteller may decide a derangement is in order after any experience that \ngenerates especially intense and unpleasant emotions, or which violates a \ncharacter’s beliefs or ethics severely. All derangements carry “triggers,” \ncircumstances that cause the effects of the derangement to become active. \nOnce activated, derangements remain in effect for the rest of the scene, and \nplayers must modify their character’s Traits, attitudes and behavior in \naccordance with the derangement description. Characters may resist a \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nderangement by expending a Willpower Trait - \nthis \nscene; if the trigger is still present at the end of that time, the character must \nspend another Willpower Trait. In the case of particularly intense mental \nstress, Narrators may rule that additional Willpower Traits or a Static \nWillpower Challenge is required. \nIt is up to the Storyteller to determine what amount of time and \nWillpower is required to cure a derangement, and such cures are best left to \nthoughtful and involved roleplaying rather than simple Trait expenditure. \nNote: There is nothing funny or arbitrary about the way a “crazy” person \nacts. The insane character is only reacting to the stimuli that he perceives to \nbe real - \nto him, his behavior is perfectly normal. Players should never forget \nthe Mind’s Eye Theatre rules of safety still apply when roleplaying \nderangements. \nBulimia \nBulimic characters salve their guilt and insecurity by overindulging in \nactivities that comfort them (such as eating). Characters with this affliction \nwill gorge themselves as much as possible under stress then purge their systems \ndrastically. At the Narrator’s discretion, the character may overindulge in \nother pleasurable activities-sex, dancing, evenmagic -but such alterations \nshould be uncommon, and they should be justified in the character’s history. \nCrimson Rage \nA character with this derangement experiences unprovoked fits of anger \ndue to pent-up feelings of helplessness and inadequacy. Most such fits are \ntriggered by failure to overcome some obstacle, or being confronted by a \nspecific type of situation (such as pain, emotional distress or romantic failure). \nThe player should work with the Narrator to determine what triggers his \ncharacter’s derangement. Whenever this derangement is active, the character \ngains the Negative Traits Violent x 2 and Impatient, and the player should \nroleplay the fury as well as possible within the Mind’s Eye Theatre rules of \nsafety. \nFugue \nCharacters suffering this affliction react to stress by adopting a specific \nset of behaviors. In the process, they suffer blackouts or periods of memory \nloss. When confronted by extreme stress, the character must win a Static \nWillpower Challenge. If he fails, the character blacks out and the player must \nroleplay the character’s trancelike state. Otherwise, control of the character \npasses to a Narrator for a scene, who dictates the actions the character takes \nin order to remove the stress. At the end of the fugue, the character comes to \nhis rightful senses with no memory of his fugue actions. \nHysteria \nCharacters with this derangement are unable to control their emotions \nproperly when subjected to stress or pressure. They become vulnerable to wild \nmood swings and fits of intense violence against the source of their discomfort. \nThe character must make a Willpower Test against five Traits any time such \nstress is present. If she fails, she is two Traits down on all Social tests due to \nher wildly fluctuating moods, and she gains the Negative Trait Violent as well. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nIn addition, this derangement activates automatically whenever the character \nfails in a particularly stressful or important challenge. (Narrators have final \nsay on what classifies as such a dramatic failure.) \nManic-Depression \nThis derangement causes a character to suffer devastating mood swings. \nWhenever the character fails to achieve a personal goal, she must win a Static \nWillpower Challenge or fall into a depressive state for a number of scenes \ndetermined by the Narrator. While depressed, the character's Willpower \nTraits are considered halved (round down, minimum one) for purposes of \nTrait comparison, and she may not use any powers or Numinae to raise her \nPhysical Traits or otherwise lighten her mood. After that, she enters a period \nof highly upbeat energy and excitement, in which she pursues her goals \nobsessively for a number of scenes equal to the time she spent in depression. \nDuring this manic time, she has the Negative Trait Impatient x 2. \nMegalomania \nThese individuals have made power the focus of their existence, and they \nmust always be the most potent individuals in their environment. Where the \npower stems from is irrelevant as long as they are dominant. They believe that \nother people are divided into two classes: lesser beings and beings elevated \nbeyond their worth. Due to their supreme confidence, those with this \nderangement are considered one Trait up on all Willpower Tests while their \nderangement is active. However, they must also make a Willpower Test \n(difficulty six Traits) to resist any opportunity to put people in their place or \nreprimand any contentious upstarts who dare to presume beyond their station \nduring that time. Although megalomaniacs play for keeps, the actions they \ntake against others in this state need not be mindlessly violent. However, they \nare typically vicious in the extreme. Such actions are designed to humiliate \nthe offender and exalt the character's standing in the eyes of others. \nMultiple Personalities \nA character with this derangement has suffered mental anguish so severe \nthat his mind reacted by creating additional personas. Each personality is \nrelevant to the trauma that caused it, and the player should work with the \nStoryteller to determine each personality's Nature and what triggers a \nparticular one to rise to the surface. When apersonality is triggered, it assumes \ncontrol until the conditions it was created to deal with have passed. Characters \ncan manifest different Abilities and even Numinae for each personality; \nhowever, all suchTraits must still be purchased normally. What apersonality \nbelieves it can do is often very different from what it is actually capable of. \nAny such arrangements must be worked out with the Storyteller. \nObsessive/Compulsive \nCharacters suffering from this derangement are driven to control their \nenvironment. Obsessive characters keep one aspect of their life constant, be \nit personal cleanliness or simply keeping things quiet. Compulsive characters \nperform specific actions or sets of actions, such as washing their hands \nconstantly or always saying lengthy prayers after touching another person. \nObsessive/ compulsive characters are one Trait up to resist any supernatural \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmental coercion like vampiric Dominate, changeling Chicaner \nEffects or any other attempts to coerce them to give up their set behaviors, but \nthey attack anyone who tries to prevent them from adhering to their \nderangement. They need not try to kill the target, but they will inflict as much \nharm as is necessary to allow them to indulge in their derangement once \nagain. If no clear individual is the source of their frustration, then the nearest \nperson at hand will suffice. Failing that, the scenery or even the character \nhimself is in for a world of hurt. \nParanoia \nParanoid beings believe that all their woes and suffering stem from a \nmalicious external source. Many afflicted beings come up with intricate \ntheories about just who is against them and why. Those they suspect of being \nagainst them are often subject to swift and brutal violence. Paranoidcharacters \ntrust no one, not even family members or close friends, and they have a \ndifficult time interacting with others. They are one Trait down on all Social \nChallenges while their derangement is active, and they suffer from the \nNegative Traits Violent and Condescending. \nRegression \nCharacters suffering from this affliction avoid facing responsibilities or \nconsequences by retreating to a younger state of mind in which they feel that \nless will be required of them. They may alternate between times of whimsy \nand temper tantrums, but they will always seek to put a more powerful \nindividual between them and whatever is plaguing them. Victims of this \nderangement are two Traits down on all Mental Challenges. \nSchizophrenia \nIndividuals with this derangement have had their psyche fractured by \nterrible, unresolved inner conflicts. Most people conceive of this disorder \nwhen they think about insanity. Victims might imagine anything from the \nrelatively harmless delusion that they’re walking a goldfish on a leash to the \nmore sinister conviction that they must cut out their children’s eyes to keep \nthem from being tainted by the evil on television. Even still, this disorder is \nanything but arbitrary. The player should work with the Storyteller to \ndetermine ageneral set of behaviors relevant to the original trauma. Characters \nwith this derangement are unpredictable and dangerous. In situations where \ntheir inner conflict flares up, they must retest any kind of challenge to retain \nself-control that they win. (If they win that retest, they do not have to retest \nagain, though.) Furthermore, they are two Traits down on all Willpower- \nrelated tests. \nDUAT \nEvery mummy spends some time in the Underworld -while \nregaining \nthe energy necessary to attempt resurrection, and sometimes at her own \nchoosing. Hekau like Separate Ba and the Potion of the Separable Ka allow a \nmummy to send her spirit into the Underworld without requiring her to enter \nthe death cycle. (If her body or soul is slain while the two are separated, she \nenters the death cycle normally, but she does not automatically appear before \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthe Judges of Ma’at.) In addition, she can petition the Judges voluntarily, \nfalling into a deathlike trance that releases her spirit to enter the Underworld. \nThis trance lasts at least one full day, sunrise to sunrise, longer depending on \nthe challenge she encounters. \nWhile in Duat, the mummy has the same Traits she did in life. All of her \nAbilities and powers work as usual, except where specifically noted in \ndescriptions. Her Willpower and Sekhem remain the same. The one major \ndifference is that her soul enters Duat; it has full health, regardless of how \nbadly damaged the khat is. \nWhile in Neter-khertet, or the Shadowlands, the mummy can look back \ninto the Lands of the Living. The psychic barrier of the Shroud overlays \neverything like a gray haze. Healthy people are barely visible phantoms. \nDeathsight makes those closest to death easiest to see, including the terminally \nill, vampires and the walking dead. \nAlthough Neter-khertet is right next to the living world, the Shroud \nkeeps the realms from touching directly. Only a handful of mediums and \nmystics can look into Neter-khertet from the living world, and very few ghosts \nand other spirits can directly affect anything in the living world. However, \nthings with weight in the material world also exert some influence on the \nUnderworld. Permanent structures like buildings are as solid to spirits as they \nare to living people. Moving objects like cars and bullets deliver one level of \nbashing damage when they pass through the space occupied by aspirit, but are \nnot themselves affected by the spirit. \nThus the Underworld has two sources of solid reality and danger, the \nechoes from across the Shroud and the structures and objects that exist only \nin Neter-khertet. Spirits may voluntarily discorporate, suffering one level of \nbashing damage and gaining the ability to move through material walls and \nother barriers; this ability doesn’t let them move through the things actually \npresent in the Underworld, only through objects that exist in the material \nworld. For simplicity of play, assume that in the absence of specifically \ndeclared exceptions, the same walls and other boundaries apply to characters \non both sides of the Shroud. \nMOVING THROUGH THE STORM \nDja-akh, the all-consuming Maelstrom, makes travel in Duat a difficult \nand uncertain process. In the absence of immediate obstructions, a mummy \nmay walk and run at her usual pace, plus whatever bonuses Hekau and other \nenhancements provide. The storm often complicates things. Huge rifts may \nopen without notice. Showers of acid and ichor may break forth, hiding the \ndim sun between clouds that pulse with emerald or black flames. There are \nislands of safety deep within the endless expanse of Duat, including the \nBlessed Fields of A’aru, but it takes skill and experience to reach them safely. \nNor are they altogether protected from the storm, though the worst of its fury \nmay diminish in the face of sufficiently strong defenses. In addition to the \nstorm, there are other dangers for the Underworld traveler. Spectres - \nghosts \nconsumed by their destructive side and dedicated to annihilation - \nand the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmalign servants of Apophis roam storm-ridden areas and temporarily clear \nareas alike. \nThere is no perfect sanctuary in Duat anymore, just degrees of protection. \nOnly fools venture far without planning and preparation. \nDEATH AMONG THE DEAD \nMummies in Duat are not immune to harm. Interaction with the \nmaterial world may inflict minor harm, as described above. In addition, other \ninhabitants of the Underworld may attack with spells, relic weapons and \ninnate abilities. Use the same system for damage and recovery that applies to \nliving characters, keeping track of which damage is purely spiritual in origin. \nA mummy reduced past Incapacitated disappears from the Underworld \ninto the void of Oblivion ... but he isn’t gone permanently. She enters a \nregular death cycle, as described below. This time her spirit does not wander \nthe Underworld. It drifts in a coma, unaware of passing time until it’s able to \nattempt the usual resurrection challenge. When (and if) this succeeds, the \nmummy’s spirit returns to the Blessed Fields of A’aru. It may remain there to \ncontinue healing, or let Anubis lead it back to attempt a second resurrection \nchallenge to return to its body, subject to the usual penalties. \nRELICS \nMost of a mummy’s physical possessions stay in the material world. Those \nprepared with suitable Hekau make the transition with her across the Shroud. \nMuch of Egyptian religion and magic focused on this process, and mummies \nhave access to some of the world’s deepest lore and most sophisticated rituals. \nOther items, known as relics, also exist in the Underworld. A relic forms \nwhen an object is invested with a great deal of passion in the living world and \nthen destroyed. A ghostly version of the item appears in h a t  at the site of the \nitem’s destruction, solid and usable by any ghosts or other spirits who \nencounter it there. Relic weapons inflict serious damage on the Underworld’s \ninhabitants, relic vehicles move through the tangled spiritual geometry of \nNeter-khertet and deeper realms, and so on. \nSome relics were famous objects of love, hatred or another emotion (the \ncastle of a hated or loved ruler, the first atomic bomb, an old sports stadium \nassociated with a well-loved athletic team, etc.). Others were objects of more \npersonal devotion, like a child’s favorite toy or a wedding ring. There’s very \nlittle of bland, generic interest in the Underworld, since it all had to matter \na lot to someone to cross the Shroud, and the reasons for its survival may not \nbe obvious at first. Storytellers of chronicles with significant play-time in \nDuat may find the quest to own and understand relics to be a good source of \nplot hooks. \nTHE DEATH CYCLE \nDeath is temporary for the Undying. When a mummy dies, her spirit goes \nto reside in the Underworld while she regains the energy necessary to restore \nher khat and return to life. The amount of time it takes to do this depends on \nthe mummy’s Ba Background Traits. In the meantime, the mummy can act \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nbriefly with Underworld experience. Other chronicles make play in Duat as \nimportant and frequent as play in the living world. Storytellers should make \nsure players understand the expectations governing a particular chronicle. \nRegardless of how much in-play detail the death cycle gets, mummies \nreturn to life almost inevitably. Their enemies must somehow interfere with \ntheir spirits in the Underworld, as sooner or later circumstances are likely to \nallow the body to heal and the spirit to reenter it. Mummies enjoy the support \noffriends and mortal followers, as measured by Allies and Retainers Background \nTraits, who are willing to help protect vulnerable khat - \nwhenever possible, \nthese allies hide a mummy’s body in her tomb to recover unmolested. \nNote that mummies may choose to spend more than the minimum time \nin the Underworld, depending on their preferences and the general shape of \nthe chronicle. \nOnce the required time passes, the mummy spirit attempts to reenter the \nbody. There are two ways to make the effort: Spend one permanent Sekhem \nTrait and make a Static Challenge of Willpower + Ba against eight Traits, or \nspend one permanent Willpower Trait and make a Static Challenge of \nSekhem + Ba. In either case, each success heals one level of damage, starting \nwith damage beyond Incapacitated. It takes five successes for a mummy who \nwas burned to ashes to reach Incapacitated, and she needs at least one more \nto be conscious. \nIf the challenge fails, the mummy must wait at least one full day before \nmaking another attempt. Each challenge requires the permanent sacrifice of \neither a Willpower or aSekhemTrait. In addition, amummy who makes more \nthan one resurrection challenge within a year loses one Attribute Trait for \neach challenge after the first. The Storyteller or Narrator adjudicating the \nchallenge decides which Trait is lost; in general, losses begin with the \nmummy’s weakest category and with any Trait that the mummy possesses just \none of. Strength in an overall category and in a particular Trait provides a \nspiritual defense against this erosion. (Exceptions do occur, however.) The \nplayer may buy the Trait back with experience as usual. \nA particularly powerful mummy could return to life after being reduced \nto ash and reach full health immediately. Most mummies still have some \ndamage continuing to afflict their khat after the resurrection challenge. Any \nremaining damage is considered aggravated and heals as usual. All normal \nmeans of treating these wounds apply (including Hekau). \nBALANCE \nBalance measures the extent to which a mummy adheres to the principles \nof truth, balance, and justice as decreed by Osiris and taught by his priests. \nBalance isn’t synonymous with Humanity and other general measures of how \nwell other supernatural creatures restrain their darker impulses. It is a specific \nset of doctrines about moral duty and enlightenment. For the Judges of Ma’at, \nthe original harmony of the world - \nMa’at - is something they feel \nintimately, for it is part of their very essence. For their servants among the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nReborn, understanding comes only gradually and with great effort. Almost \nnothing in the world as it now exists reflects its primal state, and for souls of \nthis age, Ma’at is mostly something to imagine and to hope for. \nAnubis leads each newly made mummy before the First Judge of Ma’at, \noften known as Ankh or Life because it grants permission for Osiris to \nresurrect the deceased. Thereafter, each encounter with the Judges involves \none or more of the Judges, usually ones who specialize in a particular sort of \noffense or other trouble. The list given below is just a sampling. Storytellers \nmay create new Judges to suit the needs of their chronicles, drawing on \nMummy: The Resurrection, Egyptian mythology and their own sense of \nwhat’s appropriate for the chronicle. \nOFFENSES AGAINST MA’AT \nSome actions violate the basic principle of justice. Mummies are expected \n(and commanded) to avoid these transgressions, and they will be punished if \nthey persist. The Judges of Ma’at can lower mummies’ Balance ratings, which \nmay cost a sinning mummy access to some Hekau, Abilities and Attribute \nTraits. \nThe most blatant offenses are easiest to grasp. No mummy really needs \ndetailed explanations of just how wrong mass-slaughter is, for instance. \nSubtler offenses require more sensitivity to Ma’at and its nuances, and low- \nBalance mummies are not expected to understand them all. The higher a \nmummy’s Balance rating, the more closely she is expected to hew to the full \nrange of Ma’at’s implications, leaving her less and less room for petty sins and \nindulgences. \nBalance Offenses \n1 \nOffenses against individuals, including murder, rape, torture, and \nother gross violations. Any deliberate act leading to death or permanent harm \nfor a living person in harmony with Ma’at. \n2 \nAny of the above offenses against any living creature in accord with \nMa’at. Allowing any of the above offenses to take place without trying to stop \nthem. \n3 \nCausing harm to any person out of hatred, jealousy, fear, and the \nlike. (Self-defense is acceptable.) Destroying particularly valuable or \ninspirational artifacts such as holy ruins and icons. Causing harm to yourself, \nincluding self-destructive behavior, harmful addictions, etc. \nDoing intentional harm to personal or public property without just- \ncause. Impassioned harm against any living creature for a reason other than \nself-defense, or the defense of an innocent other. Intentionally inflicting \nemotional harm on another person. \nDoing harm to another person through ignorance, negligence or \nthoughtlessness. \nTheft, deception or betrayal against any person. \nDoing physical, emotional, or spiritual harm to any person for any \nreason other than self-defense or the upholding of Ma’at. \n4 \n5 \n6 \n7 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n. \n,- \nharm to any living creature for any reason other than self- \ndefense or the upholding of Ma’at. \n9 \nAllowing any of the above offenses to take place in your presence \nwithout attempting to stop them. \n10 Doing anything less than your absolute best to uphold and embody \nMa’at at all times. \nThe escalating demands of Ma’at mean that Laws of the Resurrection \nchronicles must necessarily deal with moral issues. This is a tricky and \ncontentious area. Abusive players like to claim that any restrictions on their \nself-indulgence is an offense against good gaming, and players and Storytellers \nof mutual goodwill may nonetheless misunderstand or simply disagree with \neach other. Storytellers should make sure that players understand that the \nstandards presented here are those laid down by forces within the World of \nDarkness, and reinforce that message through the actions of Storyteller \ncharacters. It is unlikely that any person playing in the game holds the creed \nof Ma’at in real life, and this code is something that applies to characters, not \nplayers. \nStorytellers must be fair and consistent in judging offenses against Ma’at. \nThe Storyteller or Narrator handling a scene should evaluate the situation \nand give a player warning when a character is about to do something contrary \nto Ma’at, since mummies do get some inner warning of impending wrongness. \nThe player may decide to go ahead anyway and have the character incur a \nviolation, but this is always a knowing choice. Identifying violations is \nsomewhat subjective at the higher levels, and it takes good will all-around for \nthe game to go smoothly when high-Balance characters are involved. \nMummies with high Balance ratings need not be inert, vaguely benevolent \nnobodies. Indeed, Ma’at calls them to action. The agents of Apophis and \nnonliving creatures, such as the walking dead and vampires, do not impose \nmoral claims on mummies: Whatever a mummy chooses to do to them, as \nlong as it doesn’t violate any of her other obligations under Ma’at, is all right \nwith Osiris and the Judges. The limits that do exist should serve as challenges \nto creative roleplaying, rather than as barriers to doing anything interesting. \nBEING JUDGED \nA mummy appears before the Judges each time she enters the death \ncycle, and she may also choose to enter a trance and appear before the Judges \nvoluntarily. In either case, Anubis guides the mummy to the Blessed Fields \nof A’aru where the Judges who choose to evaluate the mummy stand \nwaiting. The number of Judges present is equal to the mummy’s current \nBalance rating: one at Balance 1, two at Balance 2, and so on. A mummy \nmay encounter the same Judges repeatedly, or appear before different ones \neach time. The Judges act according to agendas that no mortal or once- \nmortal being can readily understand, and Storytellers may decide on the \nJudges’ identities as they see fit. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n(The goddess Ma’at herself presides over the judging of mummies seeking \nBalance 9 or 10. Horus allegedly struggles with the highest teachings, while \nAnubis faces only the goddess.) \nThe mummy must not have any unresolved offenses against Ma’at higher \nthan her desired (not her current) Balance rating. If she does, progress simply \nwon’t happen. The Judges quiz the mummy to determine her understanding \nof Ma’at, and force her to justify questionable actions. No mummy can lie to \nthem; they sense truth more deeply than the character can, and indeed the \nprocess of examination often leads the mummy to new insights. \nA mummy who demonstrates her commitment to the next higher level \nof Balance receives the Judges’ blessing to advance. The player may spend the \nappropriate experience Traits now, if the character has accumulated enough, \nor whenever the necessary Traits are in hand. \nA mummy who has some minor offenses, or one or two serious offenses \nfor which there’s some justification but not enough to fully appease the \njudges, remains as she is until her next time of judging. The Judges lecture her \non her responsibilities and let her pass. \nA mummy with more than a few offenses clearly hasn’t understood Ma’at \nwell enough, and faces the judges’ wrath. They strip her of one Balance Trait \n- \nmore in grave cases - \nwith consequences for the rest of the characters’ \nAbilities. Attribute category and ability totals above five fall to the character’s \nnew Balance rating, with the Storyteller deciding which Traits must be \nremoved. Any Hekau ratings above the character’s new Balance fall, even if \nthe new Balance rating is less than five. \nAs noted above, mummies may try to avoid judgment by entering the \nUnderworld and arranging to die while body and soul are separate. Sooner or \nlater, a mummy doing this ends up before the judges, who are not amused. The \nviolator suffers a reduction of Balance to 2, with all the reductions in power \nthat go with this. \nFALLING TO APOPHIS \nTwo possibilities confront the mummy at Balance 1 who continues to sin \nagainst Ma’at. If the Judges catch her soul, they may decide she’s unworthy \nof eternal life, consign the soul to the void, and that’s the end of her, without \nrecourse. Alternatively, she may voluntarily renounce Osiris and agree to \nserve Apophis. Storytellers may decide whether a character who makes this \ndecision may remain in play; in most chronicles, servants of Apophis may \nonly be non-player characters. \nA mummy who’s willing to serve Apophis encounters the Corruptor on \nher next passage into the Underworld. If she affirms her decision, the serpent \nstrips her of all her Balance rating and all the benefits that go with it, and \ntransmutes her soul to draw on Apophis for power instead. Instead of a \nBalance rating, she now has Corruption. \nThe Great Serpent isn’t as generous with its gifts as Osiris. The mummy \nthereafter ages at twice the normal rate, though she doesn’t lose Attributes \nbecause of it. She is susceptible to disease, addiction and the like as before, and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwhile they cannot kill her, neither can they be cured. She retains her special \nsenses, greater resistance to injury, the ability toreturn from the dead, and her \nHekau, though without Balance she cannot improve her path ratings. \nThis existence is not pleasant. Her sufferings mount without prospect of \nrelief until she despairs and gives up altogether. Mummies who remain loyal \nto Ma’at regard destroying their fallen comrades as a mercy-killing, and in \ntime the fallen come to agree. Many end up seeking out their former allies for \nthe relief of death. \nCORRUPTION \nJust as the Amenti walk the path of Ma’at, the Apepnu, or Bane \nmummies, walk a path ofApophis. This dark faith is measured by a character’s \nCorruption rating. The greater a character’s ties to Apophis, the greater her \nCorruption, and thus the more monstrous he is. Where the Amenti and \nApepnu share abilities, Corruption may be sustituted in place of Balance. \nNot every creature of Apophis has a Corruption rating; some may serve \nin ignorance. This does not make them any less a threat to followers of Ma’at. \nSEMEKTET \nA mummy who falls to zero Sekhem Traits while outside the Web of \nFaith enters a condition known as semektet, literally, “the weakening.” The \nmummy cannot regain Sekhem on her own: Even the Trait that comes with \neach sunrise instantly dissipates before the mummy can do anything with it. \nThe longer she stays away from the Web of Faith, the weaker she becomes. \nShe can regain Sekhem only from an outside source such as a Vessel or a \nsympathetic Udja-sen, or by returning to the Web of Faith. Back inside it, the \ndaily infusion stays with her, and she can begin to recuperate. \nA mummy in semektet cannot use any Hekau or artifacts that require \nSekhem. If she fails to gain at least one Sekhem within 70 days, she starts to \ndecay physically, mentally, and spiritual. Each day after the 70th, she loses \none Attribute Trait, selected by the Storyteller. Mental attributes usually go \nfirst, as it becomes more difficult for the mummy to think clearly. Social \nattributes usually follow, then physical. She ends up with a minimum of one \nTrait in each attribute category. \nStarting the day she falls into semektet, the mummy must win a Static \nWillpower Challenge against six Traits to avoid anovenvhelming compulsion \nto return to the Web of Faith. If she fails, the tem-akh assumes enoughcontrol \nto guide the mummy “home” long enough for recovery to begin, with an \nintensity and single-mindedness equal to the original hajj. \nThe mummy can take some measures to slow the damage done by \nsemektet, though it can’t be stopped altogether. She needs six hours’ ritual \nwork and Intermediate Alchemy, Amulets or Necromancy to make specially \nprepared bandages and to have someone else wrap her in them, leaving only \nher eyes and mouth exposed. Within this confinement (which can be \narranged to allow her to walk, though she cannot use her fingers or engage in \nany fine manipulation), she loses an Attribute Trait every three days instead \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nof every single day, and the difficulty of the Willpower Challenge to avoid a \nsecond hajj is only three Traits. \nOnce within the Web of Faith or once given Sekhem from an outside \nsource, the mummy regains Sekhem normally. Her lost Attributes return at \nthe rate of one Trait per day, in the reverse order of their loss. \nMUMMIES AND VAMPIRES \nFrom the mummies’ point of view, vampires are among the foremost \nservants of Apophis, doing a great deal to destroy the world’s balance and \nkeeping it in perpetual discord. Vampires see it differently. None of them \nhave even heard of Apophis except as a concept in Egyptian mythology. \n(Storytellers and players take note: Laws of the Resurrection does not claim \nto present “the truth about vampires, and should not be used as the definitive \nword in cosmological arguments in or out of character among vampires.) \nMummies who bother learning this much about the vampiric perspective feel \nthat it doesn’t matter much - \nvampires do the will of Apophis very well \nindeed, whether or not they realize it. And whatever the source of their curse, \nit’s an offense against Balance. Conflict ensues. A mummy cannot pal around \nwith any vampire without risking an offense against Balance, since the very \nact of feeding, which is necessary for vampiric survival, is a violation of \ninnocents. There simply isn’t room within the law of Ma’at for the Reborn \nand the undead to go out carousing or having adventures together. \nMummies can be ghouled just like mortals (see Laws of the Night, \nRevised Edition, p. 256 for details), which gives the ghouled mummy all the \nunusual benefits in increased Traits, access to some disciplines, and so on. But \nof course the mummy already has access to immortality and powers by her very \nnature, so the benefits of ghouling aren’t nearly as strong for mummies. \nMummies can also be blood bound, but the mummy who finds herself \ncalled to act contrary to Ma’at may draw on Strength of Conviction (see the \nbenefits of Balance). If successful, the mummy breaks the blood bond, and is \nimmune to any further bonds from that particular vampire. The vampire is \nseldom happy about the situation; the breaking bond resonates in his soul as \na massive counter-force against the Beast within him. \nMummy blood has unusual effects on vampires. Each Blood Trait that a \nvampire drains counts as two, reflecting the power within mummies, and it \ncosts the mummy a Sekhem Trait per blood Trait lost as her vital force gets \nsiphoned away. Each Blood Trait taken also gives the vampire one temporary \nHumanity Trait, as some of the call of Ma’at travels with the blood. It even \nworks on vampires who follow paths other than Humanity, dragging their \npath ratings down toward zero, and then building up Humanity until the \nBlood Traits taken from the mummy are all spent. \nWhile in this altered condition, the vampire suffers the consequences of \ncommitting sins appropriate to his new temporary Humanity rating. His \nmoral sense is greatly strengthened, which may come as a serious shock \ndepending on how he normally conducts himself. Any Humanity he loses \nfrom sins committed at this time remains gone even after the mummy blood \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ngoes - \nthe experience of seeing the world in more moral terms remains. A \nvampire that normally follows a Path of Morality must make a Static Instinct \nChallenge against his new Humanity rating to take actions in accord with his \nHierarchy of sin. If it fails, he just can’t bring himself to do it. And that failure \nmay in turnconstitute asin against his Path and require adegenerationcheck. \nYes, this can get very complicated and messy. In this era when mummies \nare still brand new to the World of Darkness, vampires who encounter them \ntend to get very confused, and wild rumors circulate within Kindred \ncommunities. Storytellers should require players whose characters show a full \nunderstanding of the rules to explain just how that understanding came \nabout. Vampires who’ve tasted mummy blood usually develop a lovebate \nrelationship with the power and moral vision that the blood carries. Some \nvampires become addicted to the experience and locked into aself-destructive \ncycle of sinning and counter-sinning. That tragic end only reinforces most \nmummies’ conviction of vampires’ fundamental wrongness. \nA mummy drained of all her blood dies just like any mortal, and enters \nthe death cycle. In some cases, the vampire that did the deed is still suffering \npangs of remorse created by the mummy’s blood when the mummy returns for \nvengeance. A mummy cannot be Embraced. As long as the mummy has \nBalance 1 or greater, her soul flees from vampiric corruption and enters the \ndeath cycle, leaving the vampire just with the corpse. \nFor kuei-jin, all mummy blood is Yang-aspected, and doubly potent just \nas it is for Western vampires. A mummy drained of all Chi dies as described \nabove. Note that kuei-jin have more experience in the Underworld, and may \nencounter mummies on the other side of the Shroud. Kuei-jin are not rushing \nto any fuller understanding of mummies more quickly than their Cainite \ncounterparts, and Storytellers should feel free to condemn the abuse of out- \nof-character knowledge among kuei-jin, just as among vampires. \nLIFE AS THE UNDYING \nMummies are truly alive, thanks to the Great Rite. They enjoy many of \nthe benefits and limitations of mortal life: They must eat, sleep and breathe, \nand their khat suffers when they fail to do so. They do not suffer from a curse \nthat makes them merely seem alive, like vampires, nor do they depend on a \nsupernatural rite that grants animation only to a corpse, like the walking dead \nor Risen. Mummies tend to have greater stamina than people who haven’t yet \ndied, and they have access to the potent magic in Hekau. They can also enjoy \nlife’s many pleasures, and have a sharpened sense of the importance of \nenjoying life. \nAGING \nMummies remain at the age they were at the end of the Second Life. The \nSpell of Life keeps them from aging. The only exceptions to this rule occur \nin the rare cases when tem-akh choose children to fuse with. These children \ngrow to physical maturity - \naround 16-20 years old - \nand then join other \nmummies in agelessness. Mummies who return to life after having aged \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nenough to suffer physical decline continue to look the same, but find their \nphysical capacities restored to full vigor (if not more than they ever actually \nhad). Appearances can be deceiving. \nSEX \nYes, mummies can and do have sex; they can sire offspring and become \npregnant. Children born of unions between two mummies or a mummy and \na mortal partner are normal mortals. They are more likely than usual to have \nthe merits Acute Senses, lron Will, Medium and Bes’ Blessing, and they are more \nlikely to develop sorcerous magic. Otherwise they’re like anyone else. Most \nmummies avoid family entanglements for two reasons: Spouses and children \nare easy targets for mummies’ enemies, and remaining eternally vigorous \nwhile one’s loved ones age and die is very traumatic. \nPERCEPTION \nAll mummies possess two distinctive senses: \nInsight: Living mummies may make a Mental Challenge to sense \nstrong emotions in others, either by examining a particular person, or (by \nmaking a Mental Challenge) by searching for a particular emotion in acrowd. \nThis latter application shows the mummy whoever feels that particular \nemotion strongest. lnsight registers only strongly held emotions, though \nsometimes knowing that there are no strongly held emotions in the target \ncomes in handy. \nDeathsight: Mummies in spirit form lose the ability to use Insight, and \ngain the ability to make a Mental Challenge to see the signs of illness, frailty \nor impending death in living subjects. In addition, amummy may concentrate \nfor three turns before making the challenge to search for hidden flaws and \nminute weaknesses. Success at this search gives the mummy one bonus Trait \nto use in one challenge against that target within the next hour. \nDRUGS AND ADDICTION \nMummies can enjoy and suffer from drugs just like mortals. The Judges \nof Ma’at regard over-indulgence as an offense against Balance and punish it \naccordingly, but temperate use falls within the realm of proper exercise of \none’s physical potential. Balance helps the mummy resist the temptations of \naddiction: Add the mummy’s Balance Traits to his Willpower for the \nchallenges described below. Abusing drugs generally reduces the mummy’s \nBalance, making future efforts at resisting this (and other vices) that much \nharder. \nOveruse of any drug can prove addicting, whether physically or \npsychologically. When the Storyteller feels that a character is at risk of \naddiction, the player must spend one of the character’s temporary Willpower \nTraits and make a Willpower Challenge against six Traits to resist getting \nhooked. The difficulty of this challenge rises by one each time the character \nabuses that substance thereafter. \nOnce addicted, the character has difficulty resisting an opportunity to \nuse the drug. Spend one temporary Willpower Trait to fight off the urge for \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\none hour. For each day the character goes without satisfying the addiction, he \nsuffers a one-Trait penalty to all challenges involving effort and concentration \n(but not involuntary and subconscious activities). An addicted character \nwith zero temporary Willpower Traits always indulge when offered the \nopportunity. \nTo overcome the addiction, the character must go for one full month \nwithout using the drug at all, and then win a series of three Static Willpower \nChallenges against 10 Traits or spend one permanent Willpower Trait. \nFailure leaves the character addicted. In addition, if the challenges fail, make \ntwo Simple Tests. If both of those fail, the character immediately goes on a \nbinge, seeking out the drug at almost any cost. If the character kicks the habit \nand falls back into use again at some later date, the challenges to resist \naddiction begin at seven Traits rather than six. \nTHE VEIL \nMortal minds aren’t equipped to deal with the realities of the supernatural \nworld. People fall back on instinctive psychological defenses to avoid \nconfronting ghosts, spirits, vampires, shapeshifters and other creatures whose \nexistence challenges mortal worldviews. Many names apply to this defense, \nbut “the Veil” is a common one among mummies. \nMummies do not automatically trigger the Veil. They’re like mortals in \nmany ways. Mummies on the hajj and deep in the throes of semektet radiate \nunnatural inner power and therefore unleash the Veil, as do mummies using \nHekau which evoke the Veil. Only a handful of mortals - \nthe very young, \nthe truly innocent and the totally insane - \nare unaffected by the Veil. Their \nclaims about what they see do not meet with widespread acceptance. Other \nSupernatural inhabitants of the World of Darkness are also immune to the \nVeil, since the power lies within them as well. \nMortals react based on their current Willpower: \nWillpower Reaction \n1 \n2 \n3 \nCatatonia. The person cowers in terror for at least an hour, \nseeking to deny everything related to the manifestation. \nPanic. The person runs in blind fear. \nDisbelief. The person engages in as much rationalization as \nis necessary to explain the situation as something - \nanything -but \nevidence of the supernatural. \nBerserk. The person blindly lashes out at the manifestation \nand anything associated with it, trying to destroy it or at \nleast make it go away. \nTerror. The person is deeply afraid but retains some self- \ncontrol; she seeks to withdraw as quickly as possible without \nactually succumbing to panic. \nConciliation. The person is afraid and will escape if an \nopportunity presents itself, but retains enough self-control \nto try to bargain or plead for freedom if necessary. \n4 \n5 \n6 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n.  \n7 \nControlled Fear. The person IS afraid, but has enough d f -  \ncontrol to act rationally and even communicate with the \nmanifestation. \nCuriosity. The person is more intrigued than fearful, and \nwill try to communicate with and/or document the \nmanifestation. \nAnger. The mortal refuses to be afraid and stubbornly \nstands his ground, reacting with outrage against this viola \ntion of the natural order. \nBlase. The mortal is strong-willed and self-confident enough \nto remain unperturbed by the manifestation. She’s surprised \nby it, if she’s never encountered such a thing before, but can \ndeal with it as calmly as she would with amundane novelty. \n8 \n9 \n10 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nIf a roleplaying troupe places an advertisement in the local newspaper for \na Storyteller, it might look something like this: \n“Theater company IS0 bright, creative, organized, reliable, trustworthy \nperson to perform ongoing scriptwriting, directing, producing, bookkeeping, \nprop, technical and stage-managing duties. Must be willing to work long hours \nin a high-stress, demanding environment. People skills a must. Volunteer \nposition only.” \nMake no mistake: Storytelling a Mind’s Eye Theatre game is a superhuman \njuggling act that can leave you feeling frustrated, unappreciated and burned out. \nIt requires a detailed and active imagination, tight organization, a good memory, \nthe ability to think on your feet, intelligent delegation and a whole lot of patience \nanddiplomacy. It is not something that everyone does well, or (more importantly) \nenjoys. And yet, for all these pitfalls, Storytellers still volunteer their time and \nenergy and creativity on a regular basis to provide a few hours of entertainment \nfor a group of people they may not even know very well. Why? \nEvery Storyteller will have different answers to that question - \na sense of \naccomplishment, a taste for drama, hard-core masochism - \nbut at the heart of \nevery successful game is a Storyteller who fundamentally enjoys what he’s \ndoing, someone who runs the game because he finds it fun to do so. There really \nis no other good reason to undertake this amount of stress! \nThis chapter details everything you need to know about running a Mind’s \nEye Theatre chronicle. It also covers stumbling blocks you’re likely to encounter \nspecifically in theResurrectioncontext. Even if you’ve already beena Storyteller \nin a Mind’s Eye Theatre game, the Amenti present a unique set of Storytelling \nproblems you probably haven’t encountered before; so no skipping past this \nchapter! Who knows - \nyou might learn something new. The art and craft of \nStorytelling is an ever-changing process, and every little tip helps. \nSTORYTELLING 101: THEORY AND ART \nTABLETOP VS. LIVE-ACTION \nIn a tabletop game, the Storyteller has near-absolute control over plot \ndevelopment and character interaction. She is aware of everything going on in \nher fishbowl and can “tweak” the plots to smoothly and seamlessly follow the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncharacters, playing upon minute background and personality details. She \nknows exactly how the streets are laid out, how the receptionist deals with \nunwanted visitors, where the best coffee can be found. Tabletop games can \nreach incredible levels of cinematic virtuosity, with Storyteller and players \nworking in tandem to build engrossing and memorable stories. Even shy or \ninexperienced players can usually “tag along” with tabletop stories, and find \ntheir own niches to impact the plot. \nLive-action games, on the other hand, don’t work the same way, no matter \nhow intelligent and creative the Storyteller and players may be. There are too \nmany variables, too many “real people” mucking about in an open story \nenvironment with unpredictable outcomes, for stories to consistently encompass \nall players. In a live-action game, the Storyteller cannot be everywhere at once \nto herd the stories along the way she wishes, and less outgoing or creative \nplayers may find themselves struggling to stay involved with plots. \nThat’s not to say that live-action games don’t have their own singular \nappeal; players who want more freedom to act as an individual and not as just \n“one of the troupe,” players who revel in chaos and by the seat-of-your-pants \nsplit-second timing, drama queens looking for a stage toperform on- the high \npressure and intense first-person apotheosis of the live-action setting are real \nrushes to a lot of players. As a Storyteller, though, you’re going to have to \nchange your expectations of how a game “should” run when you’re making the \nswitch from tabletop to live-action, even though the core elements behind the \ngame (having fun and telling a good story) are the same. \nSo, in practical terms, how is live-action different from tabletop? \nTHE PROBLEM OF SINGULARITY \nWorking in the confines of a tabletop environment, you (as the omniscient \nStoryteller) can see everything that’s going on in your world. You are aware of \nthe characters’ movements and their dice rolls. Abilities and limitations are \nright there for all (particularly you) to see. As a result, it is near impossible for \na player to cheat without you or another player being aware of it. As well, since \nall action is occurring right before your eyes, you need not demand in-character \njustification for the acquisition of Abilities and information. You are already \naware of whether the character can legitimately learn or know something, \nbecause you control the scenarios. \nSo what happens when someone informs you that another player is grossly \ncheating, but you weren’t there to see it happen? Or when a player wants to \nlearn some rare and powerful Ability that she claims she learned from another \ncharacter months ago, but with whom you cannot check to verify her story? \nYou, as a live-action Storyteller, are going to have to make some very unpopular \nand difficult decisions, because you can’t know every exchange going on in your \ngame. There is no one brush you can paint every situation with; you will have \nto weigh every situation individually, using what you know of the people \ninvolved, and keeping the morale of your game in mind. \nIt is inevitable that you’re going to have to make factual and character \njudgments in situations like these. All you can do is be fair, and balance between \nfairness to the player base as a whole (that is, not let a few players walk all over \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nyou or abuse the rules), and be so quick to judge that you end up alienating people \nwho might not know any better. You aren’t going to make everyone happy all of \nthe time; don’t even try to. All anyone can ask is that you try to be fair. \nCHEATING \nIn live-action games, cheating happens. Sometimes it’s unintentional \n(“Oops, I really didn’t know that power didn’t work that way.. . sorry!”). Other \ntimes, it’s intentional (“Um, no, I have 12 Brawl Abilities.. . really.. . the other \neight just haven’tbeen, um, added tomy sheet yet.”). Cheatingis anunavoidable \nbyproduct of the lack of an authority figure in play at all times; it would be nice \nto say that most players are honest, but it’s probably more accurate to say that \nmost players have honest intentiom but sometimes get caught up in the game \nand forget rule mechanics. The best way to approach these situations, as \nStoryteller, is to hope for and encourage the best in your players. But also be \nprepared to deal with the worst as impartially as you can. Your greatest allies in \nkeeping players honest are a good Storyteller-player relationship, sharp Narrators, \nand the players themselves to aim for high standards of roleplaying integrity. \nSometimes, in the case of new players who might not know any better, it \nis helpful to make a “reminder” announcement to the players before or after the \ngame, without naming specific players. That kind of subtle correction is all a \nStoryteller needs to do to give players a gentle reminder about the way certain \npowers or rules work, and it heads off any further misinterpretations. Never \nhumiliate a player in front of the other players, no matter how grave her offense \nmay be; if you feel she may be deliberately cheating, take her aside and speak \nto her privately. As well, give players the benefit of the doubt until proven \nguilty; slinging accusations without asking the player if she understands the \nrules results in hurt feelings and angry players, and in you gaining the reputation \nof being a petty tyrant. \nAnyone caught by a Narrator or yourself who is blatantly and consistently \ncheating should be removed from that session’s play and be given a stern, \ncourteous warning. If he persists in cheating, you may consider removing him \nfrom the game altogether, but that is a personal decision. Many Storytellers \ntolerate known “problem players” to avoid a bad reputation, but this toleration \nmay send other players the message that it’s okay to cheat, and the whole game \nwill begin to slide. Be firm, be fair. \nQWTIONABLE KNOWLEDGE \nIf a player comes to you and wishes to learn something strange or powerful \nbut there’s a question as to whether or not he is justified in learning it, don’t \nbe afraid to say, “Not right now - \nlet me consider it, and I’ll get back to you.” \nDo not let yourself be badgered/whined/flattered into agreeing to something \nthat later unbalances your game or makes other players perceive you as favoring \nthat player! If you have decided that the Ability/power in question is indeed \na possibility for your game, your next step is to talk with the player about how \nhe learned about it, whom he talked to, the in-character steps he took to learn \nit himself, and, if possible, check with any other players who were supposedly \ninvolved. If you are unconvinced, suggest that you may be willing to let him \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nevery action he takes toward that goal. \nPlayers who are friends in real life may cook up reasons why their \ncharacters teach each other powerful or rare abilities that, in all probability \n(due to background reasons or the like), they would be extremely unlikely to \ndivulge to each other. You can’t police the way people play their characters, but \nthere is no harm in talking to them about why their characters are doing this, \nespecially if it happens repeatedly. If they can’t satisfy you with a rational \nanswer, you may want to nix it. \nGET IN THE LOOP \nYouneed to stay connected with what’s happening in your game, something \nthat, while very easy in the confined space of a tabletop game, is a real challenge \nin a game environment where character interaction occurs simultaneously, \nspread out over remote playing areas. Rushing around trying to be everywhere \nat once just stresses you out and, in turn, stresses players out as you whiz by. \nThis point is where your Narrators come in. They are your eyes and ears \nwhen you can’t be in the thick of things, and can relay both in-character events \nand player rumblings (even though some things inevitably slip by even the \nmost attentive Storyteller/Narrator team). The game should reflect the players \nas much as the players reflect the game, and for that balance to be maintained, \nyou must be aware of what’s going on in the players’ microcosm, and not just \nwhat’s happening in “your” world. Resist the temptation to dismiss player- \ndriven plots as buzzing distractions. It’s easy to see them as competition for your \nown storylines, but finding a way to weave them into your plots shows the \nplayers that their actions are having an in-game effect, and it makes the overall \ngame more interesting. \nAGAINST THREATS AND ANTAGONISM \nTabletop games naturally lend themselves to the troupe working together \nas a unit (albeit loosely sometimes) against a common enemy. This is mostly \ndue to the challenge that close physical proximity presents to being truly \nsneaky against your fellow players; how do you scheme effectively when other \nplayers can’t help but have an inkling of what you’re doing? Not the case in a \nlive-action environment, where opportunities to plot against others abound. \nAs a result, there is a much greater potential for hurt feelings and player \nhostility that you have to deal with as Storyteller. Again, follow the “encourage \nthe best but be prepared for the worst” rule of Storytelling. While you’re not \nbeing asked to be Big Brother, you are partially responsible for players playing \nnice with each other, and you need to be on your toes to head off awkward \nsituations. \nThings to watch out for: \nPlayers bringing real-life hostility to bear against someone else’s character; \nPlayers using character situations to manipulate players; \nPlayers taking advantage of “newbies” who don’t know any better; \nPlayers using out-of-character information to affect the outcome of the \ngame (otherwise known as metagaming); \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThere’s absolutely nothing wrong with players going toe-to-toe against each \nother, so long as it’s done in strict fairness and is appropriate in-character behavior \nfor the people inquestion. For some players, the thrill of competition with another \nreal person is why they enjoy live-action games in the first place. In conflict \nsituations, though, it’s particularly important to make sure that the rules are \nmeticulously followed. Players will usually (understandably) be grumpy if their \ncharacters are killed or otherwise inconvenienced by another player, but being a \nfair and impartial judge goes a long way to making sure hostility doesn’t linger. And \nit can smooth the transition if the player needs to make another character. \nPOWER LEVEL \nWhen you sit down to write the story for your live-action game, you’re \nprobably planning that your chronicle is going to span at least a year in real-time. \nIn that time, some of the initial characters are going to survive, growing more \npowerful with every experience point, especially if they are given benefits that \nlater characters won’t receive during character generation. Predictably, therefore, \nthe game reaches a point where the older characters are nearly “untouchable” to \nnewly generated characters. This gap in power levels can be very off-putting to \nplayers who wish to create new characters for your game, as they may feel they \ncan’t “compete” with the established characters. As well, the mightier the older \ncharacters become, the more difficult it is for you to come up with things that can \nstump them. An obstacle that might take new characters weeks to solve might \ntake an older character one scene, while an adversary designed to challenge your \nolder characters will probably obliterate the younger characters with little effort. \nPower disparity is one of the most devastating ailments in long-running chronicles. \nThere are several ways to avoid this: \nRamp the experience very slowly. Being stingy won’t make players too \nhappy, but it means they savor every experience point, and help to keep \neveryone advancing at a similar rate as the character base “turns over.” \nCap the characters at a set level of experience (like 100). They cease to \ngain experience for playing, but may continue as Storyteller characters. \nAutomatically retire characters at a set level of experience. \nRetiredcharactersneednot exit thegameentirely. They canstay on, ifthe player \nis willing, to be permanent or semi-pemanent Storyteller Characters, meaning that \nthey become extensions of your will - \nthey can help move stories along, mentor \nyounger characters, and take direction from you. They maybe helpful insteering away \nyoung characters from threats that would turn them into hamburger, or throw bait \nto them to encourage them to chase a plot. If the player would rather start a new \ncharacter, the old one can still make cameo appearances. It is up to you what power \nlevel youwant for yourgame, but keep inmind that suddenly droppingthe power level \nof a game is likely to make the players who are taken by surprise very unhappy. Plan \nout what power level you want your game to be at “cruising altitude,” and make sure \nthat all the players are aware of the limitations. \nIt’s also a good idea to design plotlines specifically for the “new” folks, and \nkeep the older characters so busy with their own super-scary plotlines that they \nhave no time to spend with the small fries. It might seem counterproductive to \nbe splitting up the game between the powerful and not-so-powerful (after all, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nintentions goes on a mission intended for a highly experienced group,-he’s \nprobably going to get mangled beyond recognition. Keep in mind that there \nshould be a piece of the pie (that’s not too big to swallow) for every character, \nno matter what his power level is. \nDespite your best efforts to offer something for everyone, some players \n(whether out of overconfidence or ignorance) will try to tackle things well \nbeyond their characters’ ability to handle. Remind them that in-character \nactions have in-character consequences, and if they still persist, allow the story \nto unfold as it will. They are responsible for the choices their characters make, \nand you cannot save everyone with suicidal character tendencies. \nCOMMON SENSE STUFF THAT OFTEN ISN’T \nBE HONEST WITH YOUR PLAYERS \nThis doesn’t mean tell them everything about your storylines. But if you \nhave no intention of ever allowing players to do or have something, it is always \nbetter to say, “I can’t let you do that, it would unbalance the game. I’m sorry” \nthan make excuses or let them think they could have it sometime in the future \nwhen you have no intention of letting it enter your game. Players catch on to \nexcuses and delays, and it just wastes time if they’re putting character time \ntoward something you aren’t going to allow anyway. \nBE FAIR \nAgain, do not favor certain players over certain other players, no matter \nhow you feel about them outside of the game. If you are being accused of \nfavoritism, take a moment and consider that and the situation honestly: Are \nyou, even unconsciously, being more lenient or generous with certain players, \nor discriminating against others? It’s easy to do if you aren’t careful, but the rules \nhave to apply to everyone equally. If there are certain players you know you \nwon’t be able to be objective with, consider delegating them to aNarrator. The \nway you feel about the player can’t help but subtly influence your in-game \ndecisions, and sometimes it’s best just to avoid the situation altogether. \nBE CONSISTENT AND CLEAR \nThere is nothing wrong with changing how the rules work, but changing \nhow the rules work from session to session makes players go insane with \nfrustration! Decide carefully how you want any house rules to work, and if you \nabsolutely must change them again, stick with them for at least a few sessions \nbefore revising. Clearly explain all changes to the group before the session, and \nmake sure all “house rules” are printed, posted or otherwise available to your \nplayer base. Your players must be aware of all changes to rules before gameplay \nbegins, and rules should not be changed at every whim. \nBE PROFESSIONAL \nYes, Storytelling is a hobby, but you are also stepping into a role that carries \nwith it a mantle of responsibility. You are the primary role-model for your game. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nFlying off the handle every time a player questions a decision, embarrassing a \nplayer in front of the group, slinging mud at other chronicles in the area, or using \nyour position of authority as leverage over the players outside of the game are all \ncrippling to a healthy game and the degree of trust players place in you. As well, \nyou are the lightning rod for any public interest your game can generate. \nAuthorities, from police toparents, may eventually come to you to inquire about \nyour activities. Maintaining a high level of honesty and integrity, both within \nand without your game, makes the red tape of your game easier (such as acquiring \nspace to play in), and allows everyone involved to feel more comfortable. \nBE OPEN-MINDED \nAs much as you may believe that someone is not playing their character well, \neven if you can point to game supplements or rules that support you in this, it is not \nyour place to tell them so. If you feel that someone does not understand the game, \nsimply approach him and politely ask him why his character is doing what he’s \ndoing (particularly if the character is going against what you see as a fundamental \ntenet of that character archetype). Perhaps he doesn’t understand the game system, \nor maybe he isn’t as versed in the World of Darkness mythos as you are. Helping \na player understand where his character might be coming from is preferable to flatly \ncriticizing. There really is no “right” or “wrong” way to play a character; there are \nonly actions and consequences. Dictating to someone exactly how to play his \ncharacter is futile and takes away freedom of individuality, and few players put up \nwith a heavy-handed or overly critical Storyteller for long. \nRELAXI \nStorytellers who are used to the clockwork-control that tabletop games offer \nsometimes suffer from Buttinski Syndrome (also known as “micromanaging”). \nThese Storytellers lose their cool when their main plotlines derail, or an important \nStoryteller character gets killed, or anything happens that they didn’t account for, \nand they often try to “railroad” players back into doing what they want them to do. \nIn a live-action setting, that kind of control leaves players feeling like puppets - \nit doesn’t matter what they do, the game is going to go the way the Storyteller wants \nanyway. Nothing is worse for a player than feeling powerless! \nRelax. Adapt. Roll with the punches. Isn’t that what you’re asking players \nto do every time the game starts? \nSTORY BEGINNINGS \nThere really is no practical formula for building a good story. If there were, \nall chronicles would have the same feel, and players would get bored. The \nstories you’ll be telling start with a core idea - \nyour idea - \nand evolve, \nbranching off and interweaving, changing and being reinvented. It can be \ndifficult to find the right note. Locking yourself into a story arc that’s overly \ndefined doesn’t allow players much ingenuity or creativity to make their own \nplots, but also having no idea where you want the chronicle to go frustrates \nplayers because they’re not sure what they should be doing. \nWriting a good story for your players requires a combination of set pieces \n(things that won’t change because they are necessary to the story) and shifting \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nvariables (to add interest and unpredictability). All you can do is set the scene \nas creatively and vividly as you can, and let the players find their own way \nthrough it. Sometimes they’ll miss the obvious clue you laid out in the middle \nof the floor, and other times, they’ll doggedly pursue minute details that you \nnever dreamed would become central to the characters’ actions. Either way, \nthat is all in the spirit of the game. \nLaws of Resurrection presents some unique twists on the live-action \ndynamic; even if you’ve run other games in the Mind’s Eye Theatre line, the \nAmenti will pose unusual challenges to your abilities. Not only are the \ncharacters challenging to play - \nsince the players must not only be thinking \nof who they were when they died in modem times, but also who they were when \nthe pyramids still gleamed white in the sun and the Sphinx was whole -but \nyou must also explore spiritual journeys, horrific enemies and foreign locations \nin detail, all while fighting the sense of stasis that accompanies characters who \nare unlikely to truly die. Make no mistake - \nthis game requires the highest \nstandards of integrity from your players, and careful and creative planning on \nyour part. This game setting can provide players the chance to explore the \ndelicious balance between death and life, corruption and purity, combat and \ncontemplation - \nthe choicest cuts of live-action play on one platter. \nTHEME \nStarting your game with a theme gives you a platform to branch out from, \nas well as a solid backbone that you can tie everything back to. Having a theme \nis useful to lend your game coherence, instead of a ragtag patchwork of unrelated \nideas cobbled together. This is not to say that the ideas in your game won’t appear \nunrelated at times; but you will know better as you can see the entire picture. \nSome Storytellers don’t need to consciously choose a theme to guide their \nchronicles, but for inexperienced Storytellers, having a baseline to return to is \nhelpful. When the inevitable Storyteller’s block strikes, remember the theme. \nHope, Redemption, Unity, Tragedy, Morality, Mortality, Corruption, \nRomance and Enlightenment are all examples. Theme isn’t a cudgel you whack \nplayers with; it’s more of an underpinning that supports the plots, tying them \ntogether and permitting them to flow smoothly into each other. If your theme \nis Romance, that doesn’t mean you have to try playing matchmaker for the \ncharacters. It could mean that when you were crafting the background, stories \nand setting of your game, you kept the ideas of love, sensuality and romance \nweaving through everything. From the singular central theme can branch off \nrelated ideas, such as unrequited love, love lost to time, the bonds between \nparent and child or spouses or obsession. \nIt is not necessary for players to identify your game’s theme at first, but it \nshould become apparent to them over time. If you feel that your chosen theme \nhas begun to stagnate, or has become too obvious, you can always change it to \nsomething different. Some Storytellers change the theme on a regular basis (such \nas every three months or so) to keep the game chaotic and unpredictable; others \nuse randomized indicators (such as Tarot cards) as inspiration for their stories. \nNearly any theme you wish to explore is possible in the world of the Amenti. \nThe complex nature of mummies affords you the ability to push your game to \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nextremes that other creatures in the World of Darkness aren’t geared to handle. \nOne theme you should ulwuys have running through this game, however, is that \nof Balance (or, inversely, Unbalance). Players must constantly be reminded of \nthe razor-fine line they are asked to walk, under the watchful eyes of the Judges \nof Ma’at. It is absolutely integral that reminders of this perilous spiritual path, a \nmoral equilibrium that can be of life or death importance, be built into your \nplotlines and setting (at least as a subtle backdrop). \nMOOD \nCreating mood in live-action games is a passive thought process (when \npertaining to the particular manner in which plots are unfolded by the \nStoryteller) and an active physical endeavor (using props and venue as tools to \nprovide realism and evoke emotion). The physical aspect of mood is thoroughly \ndiscussed later in this chapter. \nMood is subtle. If theme is “What kind of story are you telling?” then mood \nis “HOW are you telling the story?” It’s the light in which you cast things. The \nsame basic story can be told a thousand different ways and prompt a different \naudience reaction each time. As a Storyteller, the way you choose to present \nyour story should depend on what players are looking for. You can’t please \neverybody, so having a couple of different “flavors” of mood is wise. Returning \nto the earlier theme of Romance, a mood of despair can set the stage for \nunrequited passions or lost opportunities, while a mood of change suggests new \nvistas and encouragement to take risks. \nAre your players looking for angst? Ferocity? Gritty realism? Idyllic fantasy? \nSome troupes thrive on horrific grotesquerie, while others prefer their stories to take \na more refined, neo-Victorian bent. Are your antagonists slavering psychotics or \nrefined masterminds? Do they prefer happy endings?These aren’t questions you can \nask of players without giving away too much of your plotlines, so play the sleuth. \nTake your cues from what the players themselves are attempting to do in downtime \nnotes or in session, and gauge the moods you wish to cast in that way. \nBe careful when exploring more gruesome atmospheres, however - \nsome \nplayers find fictional ultra-horror objectionable. When particularly lurid events \noccur in your game, you may wish to downplay the gross-out factor to players when \nyou aren’t sure they can stomach it. Some moods are not suitable for players under \na certain age. Use your best judgment, and if you know your game is going to delve \ninto extremely mature themes, consider putting an age limit on your player base. \nPLOT \nIn a book or movie, the plot is the static progression of events for the \ncharacters; that is to say, the outcome is the same every time you read the book \nor watch the movie. Not so in a live-action game. You create the landscape \nplayers move in, decide who (and what) they are going to encounter, craft \npuzzles for them to solve, and conjure rewards for the brave and crafty, but you \ncannot write or direct every step of the way. Trying to herd players through a \nscriptlike plot takes away their freedom of movement, and results in you and \nyour players butting heads over what they “can” and “can’t’’ do. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n-- Sowhywriteaplot atall?Whynotjustletplayersgraze thr \naimlessly if they can’t be expected to follow your story? The answer is obvious: \nStoryteller-provided plots are an external, unifying, ongoing challenge for all \nplayers, if they choose to involve themselves. Many, many plots in a live-action \ngame are player-driven, but having ever-present Storyteller plots hovering in \nthe background (and occasionally crashing everyone else’s parties) brings \nplayers together to work toward a common goal. \nSCALE AND SCOPE \nThe scale of your game refers to the physical size of your game (do you have \n300 players in an opera theater, or five friends in your living room?) and to the \nin-game time span (does the game encompass a few months of the characters’ \nlives, or a few lifetimes?). You need to be realistic on both counts. Having an \nenormous game may sound like a great idea, but how are you going to find a \nphysical venue that can support that many people? If in a public place, are you \naware of any laws regarding the gathering of groups over a certain size in your \ncity? How many players are you prepared to organize notes and bookkeeping- \nrelated paperwork for? \nImbuing your story with epic chronological proportions lends grandeur to \nthe chronicle, but can you make it run smoothly with a minimum of confusion? \nHave you thought about how to keep all players up to date with regard to where \nthey are in the timeline? Are you able to accurately represent historical details, \nif necessary? \nTwo main ideas you need to keep in the forefront concerning the scale of \nyour game are the number of players you as a Storyteller can realistically \norganize, and the number of players your plot(s) can handle without becoming \ntoo difficult. It’s best to keep your plots simple (in real-time) with a large group \nof players, while a smaller group of players can afford you more creative leeway. \nBalancing the ratio of players to plot complexity is a good way to keep your work \nlevel at a manageable average. That’s not to say that a large group necessitates \na simplistic plot; it means that keeping it simple will save you headaches. \nIf you haven’t run a live-action game before, consider keeping your initial \nnumber ofplayers to a generous handful. You can always open the game up later \nwhen you’ve got things firmly by the reins. Conversely, if you ever find you’ve \nlet the player scale run away from you and your game is sagging under the weight \nof too many players, cap new submissions until the equilibrium between game \nquality and game quantity is regained. \nThe scope of your game is less measurable than its scale. It is the amount of \nfree will you allow your players, or how long their leashes stretch. Do some of your \nplots require information gathered from remote regions of the world, or will the \ncharacters get everything they need to know from local sources? Are the \ncharacters able to influence global events, or is that beyond their reach? While \nyou have probably already laid down guidelines for yourself concerning the \nexperience ramp you’re going to give players, think about how far you will allow \ntheir actions to ripple, and whether or not you’re going to have storylines that \nreach across several continents. Scope is particularly important in Laws of \nResurrection, as the beating heart of the Amenti throbs in the Middle East, but \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmany character soriginatedonother continents before their hajj, withunfinished \nbusiness to pursue in the lands where they died. \nIf you want to allow players the ability to influence global events, or wield \nmagnificent, earth-shattering power, be prepared to do your homework. It can \nbe a lot of fun to have your troupe travel to exotic locales, but it’s also difficult \nto regularly execute. Constant set/scene changes are exhausting for you, \nespecially if you are very detail-oriented. Are you willing to do the necessary \nresearch to accurately describe different regions and customs? You have to be \nversed in different locales’ traditions and political climes, and other creatures \nin the World of Darkness may not like strangers waltzing through their \nstomping grounds, or interfering with “their” people. Are your players willing \nto deal with the constant mental “jet lag” at remembering where they are \nsupposed to be all the time? Give this serious thought before committing to a \nfrequent-flyer game plan. Decide ahead of time how much extra work you wish \nto make for yourself, and remember you can always expand the players’ reach \nlater when you have a better feel for the game. \nA wide-scope game affords unusual opportunities - \njaunts to faraway \nlands, acquisitions of legendary artifacts -but \na smaller scope lends the plots \nan “in my backyard” urgency. A balance between adventure and stability is \noften the best. \nScope presents a thorny problem with regard to the Amenti, as their holy \nsites are based in the Web of Faith in the Middle East, but the mummies \nthemselves will be different nationalities. If you choose to set your game \nsomewhere other than the Middle East, be aware that all mummies begin their \nexistence there, and they will periodically need to return there to recharge their \nSekhem. It might be easiest to set your chronicle in the Web of Faith, and make \njourneys elsewhere to be special plot elements, as opposed to setting your game \nin (for example) the United States. Setting your game in a possibly foreign \nlocation (such as Egypt) might take a little more homework and planning, but \nit may be easier than juggling the players’ overseas jaunts every few sessions. \nPLOT TYPES \nThe overplot is the state of the world players are playing in - \nthe \nmacrocosm of the game. Work out all major details first; otherwise, you’re \ntrying to write a story with no background or setting! \nWhere is your game set (continent/country/city/etc.)? What is the current \npolitical climate? What are some major current events happening in your game \nworld? Who are the movers and shakers, and (more importantly) who controls \nthem? Even if these details never come into play, setting them up now makes for \nsome juicy plot hooks later. Perhaps a major antagonist is closely tied to a political \nleader that characters have just formed anunwitting alliance with, or aneighboring \ncountry is about to declare war on the homeland of a character and he asks his \nallies to aid him in preventing the conflict. The more articulated and thought- \nout your game world is, the more believable and vivid it will be to your players. \nAnother part of overplot is game-specific; initially, why have all these \ncharacters come together? Have they been called by a higher power to discover \nwhy certain surreal events are occurring? Is a mysterious force manipulating the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsituation so that all the characters are in the same place for some unknown \ndesign? Whatever the reason, you have a perfect opportunity to plant a \nshadowy seed at the start of the game that won’t come to fruition until much \nlater, and you can have many plot offshoots in the meantime. \nNext, stemmingdirectly or indirectly from the overplot aresubplots. They \nare ongoing challenges that keep the pace of the game reasonably brisk. \nExamples include dealing with antagonists, lost objects, quests for knowledge \nand other situations that can usually be resolved in one to 10 game sessions. It’s \na good idea to have two or three “active” at a time, to allow different types of \ncharacters to all get in on the action. While the overplot should not be focused \non one player character, it is perfectly acceptable to use character Merits, Flaws, \nBackgrounds and histories as springboards to launch subplots. Subplots are also \na great way to make sure some of the less splashy Flaws get brought into play. \nPlayer plots, or miniplots, are player-originated stories. They may only \nentail two or three players on a personal quest or mission, but they are often the \nmost emotional experiences for players. Often they don’t require Storyteller or \nNarrator interference at all, but sometimes actions are taken that require you \nto take some time out of the main game to describe what effects players’ actions \nare having. Miniplots should not be discouraged, but you can’t spend all your \ntime running mini-games and neglecting the game as a whole. The best way to \ndeal with these types of plots are to either let players work it out themselves (or \npossibly with Narrator assistance), or in the case of a particularly creative \nminiplot, pounce on it and tie it in to become a full-fledged subplot. You may \nrun into players who want you “all to themselves” all the time, but your \ncommitment is to the entire body of players, not the individual. \nHOW TO E L L  A STORY IN FIVE EASY STEPS1 \nAll cinematic (story) plots follow the same loose formula: Preparation, \nOpening, Climax, Denouement and Conclusion. Each stage need not occupy \nthe same length of game time, and sometimes the stages may seem to blur \ntogether. These guidelines offer a tried-and-true method of conveying events \nthat can be extremely helpful to live-action Storytellers. \nPreparation involves setting up the scene for the events to come, \nforeshadowing, and introducing the main characters, allies and foes. \nOpening involves going into character development more deeply, \nestablishing character relationships and building upon existing friction. \nClimax is, well, the climax - when those things that were foreshadowed in \nthe Preparation phase come into play, when the shot rings out, when the traitor \nis revealed, and when other traumatic events happen. Sometimes the climax \nis positive (winning a challenge, defeating a powerful foe), and other times it \nis negative (a murder, the destruction of a holy object). \nDenouement is the “cleaning up” section. Reactions, reparations, and the \nreordering of relationships and allegiances in the aftermath of the Climax. This \ntime is usually when the plot officially ends, possibly leading into another story. \nConclusion is when the moral or lessons of the story (if any) are made \nclearer in out-of-character and in-character discussion, and (if the story stages \nare being used in a session-based context) when players pack up and go home. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSTORYTELLING 101: THE CRAFT \nThe theories behind running a live-action game were discussed earlier. In \nthis section are the practicalities: things to consider or anticipate to keep your \ngame running smoothly, and the nitty-gritty realities of Storytelling a game. \nBEFORE EVERYTHING ELSE ... \nDo you have players interested in playing Laws of Resurrection? Have \nthey roleplayed in a live-action environment before? What kind of game are \nthey looking for? This game is challenging even for experienced players, with \nsporadic (but intense) combat and a strict moral code the characters must try \nto abide by, not to mention the smatterings of Egyptian mythology and \nterminology that are crucial to understanding the Amenti perspective. \nDo you have the time/resources to devote to Storytelling? Apart from the \nobvious few hours’ investment of a game session proper, live-action games \nrequire a lot of between-game work. This work includes the acquisition and \nupkeep of a venue from which to host the game, recruiting players, sitting down \nwith players to create their characters, planning the next phase of the story, \ndisseminating information (such as any setting/real-life venue changes and \ngame times), updating character sheets, answering innumerable player questions, \nand so on. Incumbent also upon a Storyteller are startup costs (a venue may \nrequire renting, character sheets need paper, props and so on). Realism does get \nexpensive! \nBOOKKEEPING \nNo person has a perfect mental database; you can’t just keep track of \neverything in your head. Running a game requires tracking and updating a \nmillion facts and details, and that simply isn’t possible without some serious, \nthought-out organization. You need backup and paper copies of every player’s \ncurrent and updated character sheet (for reference in case of dispute), and you \nhave to process downtime actions (the time between actual sessions), keep \ntrack of how experience is spent, correlate players’ actions against each other \nand the game world itself, and make any story or plot adjustments in reaction \nto player actions. A host of other small details can be sand in the gears of a \nsmooth-running game if you aren’t on top of it at all times. \nHow you choose to organize yourself is dictated by personal tastes. Some \nStorytellers use computer databases, while others shuffle everything around on \npaper. Whatever your filing system, establish it as much as you can ahead of \ntime, before the game begins to gain momentum. And save players’ downtime \nactions and your responses to them, to refer back to later if necessary. Many \nStorytellers have a computer backup of all their relevant information, and they \nbring paper copies of everything to the game. You may find that you have to go \nback to a player’s character sheet or note actions several times in order to make \ninformed, in-game decisions. It’s better to take a moment and be sure, than to \nmake a snap decision about a character’s abilities or resources that later proves \nto be wrong. Accept that you won’t be able to remember everything, and thus \nkeep the information at your fingertips. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthe course of -play, players will cross off things they’ve spent, or make \ncharacter notes in the margins. Because of this constant altering, character \nsheets can quickly become unintelligible and confusing in later sessions. Save \nplayers the trouble of trying to remember what they have spent and what they \nhaven’t, or what information is now relevant to them, and provide them with \na new sheet each session. \nThe world engine of your game doesn’t grind to a halt between game \nsessions, and neither do the characters’ lives; so you should provide “downtime \nactions’’ to your players. These actions usually take the form of your players \nwriting you anote ofwhat they’re doing betweengatherings-what experience \nthey’re spending, who they’re talking to, what they’re learning, and the like. \nSome Storytellers give “carte blanche” to their players, allowing them to do as \nmuch as they like. More realismebased Storytellers divide the notes into a finite \nnumber of “actions” that the characters can perform in the given limited time. \nWhen your players try to spend their experience points, encourage them to \nexplain to you how they’re learning that particular Ability, especially if it’s not \nsomething that’s easily taught. Is it realistic for a scholarly bookworm to \nsuddenly teach himself Brawl? Likewise, is a thuggish mercenary type going to \neasily teach herself Performance: Dunce? If it doesn’t make sense to you, make \nthe player work for it. \nConvincing players to get their downtime actions to you by a set date can \nbe difficult, but it’s necessary for you to give yourself plenty of time to reconcile \nthe characters’ actions with the plot(s) and to incorporate any character \nchanges. Therefore, set a hard date that players must have their notes to you \nby (either paper notes or by email, for example) and stick by it. You owe it to \nyourself to not be racing at the last moment to incorporate stragglers. Players \nwill learn that if they want to spend experience they will have to accommodate \nyour schedule, not the other way around! It sounds harsh, but you can expect \nto spend between two and eight hours a week processing your game’s paperwork \nalone - the least they can do is get you their actions on time. \nVENUE \nThorough consideration must be given to the venue. First, is it going to be \nin a private home, or a public (or semi-public) location? Playing in someone’s \nbasement, for example, can give you wonderful options for set decoration, high- \ndrama roleplaying or music that might not be permissible in a public place, but \nit can still pose problems. Theft, damage, illegal activity and legal liability are all \npitfalls when playing in someone’s home; as well, in a more “intimate” setting, \nsome of the fundamental roleplaying rules (such as no touching) can easily be \nbent or broken. In a small game, with people you know and trust, this usually isn’t \na problem. But in a large game, these can be real issues. Private games are always \nmore intense, with all the good and bad that carries with it. \nPublic venues may make players feel that they are more limited with how \ntheir characters can express themselves, and your options for altering the physical \nscene are seriously hampered, but they can also provide a sense of safety for \nplayers, especially shy or inexperienced ones. Examples of public venues include \nparks, coffee shops and restaurants. If you choose to conduct your game in a public \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nvenue, respect the people around you! If a noisy, distracting or emotional scene \nis going to be played out in front of persons not involved with the game, your best \noption is to freeze the action and continue it at a later time, or away from the \nvenue. Do not frighten the non-garners! As well, coffee shops and restaurants \nusually require people to buy something; make players aware that if people do not \nsupport the establishment, you may be asked to leave. \nYour (usually) most expensive option is also the most popular: semi-public \nvenues, such as a convention center, warehouse space or university rooms. The \nfee for these places can range from a mere pittance (such as in the case of most \nuniversity rooms, if someone from that institution is willing to “sponsor” or take \nresponsibility for booking the space), to high-priced (such as in the case of a \nhotel convention room). You have some freedom with regard to altering the \nphysical space to reflect your game, but it also has the “safe” feel of a public \nlocation. There still may be the occasional non-gamer wandering around, and \nyou should still be keeping their comfort level in mind, but you have the \nfreedom to mostly play scenes as you wish. Some players do not mind paying \na small fee to book quality game space, but discuss it with your players. \nSETTING THE STAGE \nSo you have all the theoretical things sorted out with regard to theme and \nmood and plot; now comes the dirty work. How are you going to reflect those \nthings in the physical environment that players are immersed in? \nOften, a few sensory “triggers” (such as sound, color or scent) are enough \nto give your venue the flavor it needs to draw in the players’ imaginations. Take \nphysical cues into consideration when planning a session. The easier it is for \nplayers to project themselves into a foreign frame of mind, the more “real” the \nscene seems. Lighting is the easiest variable, with the most impact; a few well- \nplaced soft lamps can transform a space from utilitarian to mysterious. \nPublic venues, as they cannot usually be substantially altered, work best as \nrepresentations of themselves. If your players are in a coffee shop, why not have \nthe characters be in one as well (albeit altered to reflect the World of Darkness)? \nThis makes following social etiquette with regard to other patrons much easier, \nas it’s unlikely the characters want to cause a scene any more than their players \nwould. In a semi-private place, you may have the option to play background \nmusic appropriate to the story setting, post things temporarily on the walls, and \nmove furniture around to suit the atmosphere you’re trying to create; it’s always \nbest to ask the proprietors of the location if you’re at all in doubt. They usually \ntell you that so long as nobody else is disturbed and everything is returned to how \nyou found it, you are free to do as you like (within reason). Of course, private \nlocations offer the most freedom of expression in creating your setting; you can \npaint walls, play louder music, even build more elaborate sets to truly reflect the \ngame environment and thus create a total immersion. \nAnother way to aid players in suspending their disbelief is the use of props, \nwhichareobjects (orrepresentationsofobjects) \nused inplay.Thefirstandmost \nunimpeachable rule regarding props is No Weapons. This is absolutely firm in \nthe case of real weapons, and applies to toys as well. Realistic toy weapons can \nbe mistaken for the real thing at a distance, and in these tense times, it’s better \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nto &r on the side of paranoia. Police do not like to see real weapons or even \nrealistic toys, so use your common sense. This rule is a must. Even if you’re \nplaying in a private location, real weapons are never allowed. \nSet up which props and/or set dressing you’ll need before the game, and notify \nplayers in advance of what kind of props you allow and those you don’t. This is also \na good time to advise your players of any dress code you wish to apply to your game; \npublic and semi-public venues are not good places to have people wandering \naround in various states of undress, no matter how in-character it may be. \nCHARACTER CREATION \nCharacter creation is best done either way before a game gathering, or \nduring downtime. If you try to squeeze a character in right before the session \nbegins, you may get so flustered trying to get everything done in time that you \nfecklessly approve some unbalancing character that you only wail about in \nhindsight. It’s best to take a generous amount of time with the prospective \nplayer, especially if they are new to live-action games or Resurrection, to \nexplain the concepts and goals of the game so that they can come up with \nvibrant character backgrounds and strong plot-hooks that feed into the story. \nMake sure that each player has a firm grasp of any in-house rules and customs, \nas well as a working knowledge of the official rules. A hard-copy of the house \nrules, given to the player at character creation, go a long way toward heading \noff any disputes or confusion down the road. \nPLAYER DYNAMIC \nEvery game has its continuum of goal-oriented vs. story-oriented players \nwho have different ideas about what it means to play the game. To goal- \noriented players, it’s all about getting ahead, making progress, becoming \npowerful or influential - \n“winning” the game. For the story-oriented player, \nit’s about the drama, the emotions or ideas evoked by the situations in the story, \ncharacter growth, the rise and fall of character relationships - \n“playing” the \ngame. Goal-oriented players usually react very strongly (though not necessarily \nnegatively) to any loss or impediment their character suffers, while a story- \noriented player often shrug and grin, accepting it as just another new facet of \ntheir character’s personality. Naturally, being a continuum, most players fall \nin-between these two extremes, but it’s important to have a good grasp of what \nboth types are after so that you can fairly arbitrate the inevitable disputes. In \nwriting stories, mix and balance the two types if you can. \nCommon difficulties with goal-oriented players include: being a poor or \nvengeful loser; transferring in-character hostility out-of-character; trying to \ntackle obstacles too powerful for their characters to wrestle; cheating or using \nout-of-character information (metagaming); being overly argumentative (or \nwhiny or ingratiating); and rules-lawyering (finding technical loopholes in \nrules that permit them to abuse the system). In extreme cases, these people will \nturn on their heels and storm out of a game because their characters don’t get \nwhat they think they should have. What can you do?Talk to the player, explain \nwhy the situation is going the way it is, and offer suggestions or alternate \napproaches to the problem. Showing them a different road to reach the same \ngoal may fire their imaginations and renew their interest in the game. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCommon difficulties with unduly story-oriented players include: having \nsuicidal,’.nasochistic tendencies; focusing only on tinyplots; blurring the lines \nbetween reality and fantasy; using the game as an opportunity for personal \ncatharsis; creating characters with severe, crippling Flaws; creating overly \nemotional scenes with other players; repeatedly requesting or pursuing rare, \nweird or nearly unattainable things (think Don Quixote); and requiring that \ntheir character always be “different” in some significant way, even if it is \ndetrimental or inappropriate to the game. Their characters may consistently \nfail, die, or otherwise become subjugated, while their players are baffled and end \nup shrugging, “But I was just playing my character.. . .” Often having a talk with \nthese players about how they feel about their characters’ demise, and encouraging \nthem to take less flawed characters, can help them find a balance between \ncharacter purity and success in the game. \nSTORYTELWPLAYER RELATIONS \nPlayers always have their own desires for the direction of the game, and \nstrive to make them reality, sometimes by callous or courageous moves they \nmay never have in “real life.” It’s up to the Storyteller to ensure that everyone \nis on a level playing field. Players trust the Storyteller to be fair and impartial, \nand whenever there is evidence to the contrary, it shakes the pillars of the \ngame, underminingplayers’ trust in their only real authority figure: you. It’s also \nyour responsibility to know the rules (both official and in-house) backward and \nforward, and to interpret the fuzzy sections quickly and fairly. A good Storyteller \nshould be able to talk to players and listen to their concerns without \ncompromising impartiality or making snap decisions - and if a mistake is made, \nto admit it and repair it quickly. \nYou need to be approachable; otherwise, people may shy away from talking \nto you about their concerns and ideas, and you will have no idea how they really \nfeel about the way the game is going. You may even become out of the loop of \nplayer miniplots. You will grow tired of some of the players’ complaints, but \nhandling the social aspect of your game diplomatically is part and parcel of \nbeing a good Storyteller. There is never a good reason to be rude to a player, and \nthat kind of behavior alienates people from your game. \nPlayers sometimes take the game too seriously and become personally \ninfluenced by things their characters are involved in. It’s great that they’re \nbecoming so engrossed in the game, but when in-character interactions begin to \nhave serious effects on players’ real lives, the Storyteller should remind everyone \nthat it is just a game. Like any fun recreation, it can be easy to give roleplaying \nmore impact on your life than it ought to have. As the Storyteller, it’s up to you \nto spot players who might be taking the game too seriously, and nip it in the bud. \nIf the chronicle begins to interfere with work, school and other social activities, \nit’s time to pull back and take a good look - \nthis goes for you too! \nEXPERIENCE \nExperience points are very important to the advancement rate of your \ngame. They dictate both how powerful characters can become, and how \nquickly they become so. Typically you shouldn’t award more than one or two \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nexperience points per person per session, with an occasional extra few for going \n“above and beyond” with roleplaying, costume, logistical help and the like. \nKeep running tallies of each character’s experience - how much earned and \nhow much spent. It will give you a good indication of how quickly your game \nis progressing and let you tweak the tempo. Handing out experience like nougat \ncandy at Halloween may make your players happy in the short term, but it dulls \nthe game in the long run if their goals are too easy to achieve. \nSome Storytellers prefer to award experience publicly, having other \nplayers vote during the game’s wrap-up (with players’ backs turned) on who \nthey enjoyed roleplaying against the most that session. Others ask for player \nfeedback in downtime notes. The advantage of asking for immediate player \nopinion when giving roleplaying experience is that the evening’s adventures \nare fresh in everyone’s minds, and it can be a wonderful perk to particularly \nenthusiastic players to get that kind of instant, and public, gratification at the \nend of a session. However, thin-skinned players may not like the competitive \nfeel that this kind ofvoting can foster. Talk toplayers about whether they prefer \npublic or private experience recognition, and use their majority and your \ncommon sense to make the right decision for your game. \nAmore detailed list ofopportunities to award experience, at your discretion, \ncould look like this: surviving the game session; strong roleplaying with regard \nto Nature, Demeanor and Archetype; excellent costuming or attention to \ndetail; player honesty above and beyond the norm (or being a “good sport”); the \nconclusion of a storyline; and possibly for helping WithNarrationduties. When \nyou give roleplaying bonuses, popular acclaim is a good start, but not all players \ndo their best acting in public, and just because someone is popular or loud or \nflamboyant doesn’t mean that others shouldn’t be rewarded for playing a more \nsedate character properly. \nDon’t forget the catchall phrase, “Because I feel like giving it.” But when \nawarding experience for “personal” reasons, be wary of accusations of favoritism, \nand give this kind of “because you’re nifty” experience sparingly. Also, if you \nare in the habit of awarding experience points publicly, awarding experience \npoints under the table is generally not a good idea. Secrets are difficult to keep \nin a live-action game setting, and this kind of shady experience “dealing” can \ncast you in an unflattering light if your other players find out, especially if it’s \nmore than just one or two people. \nNARRATORS \nNarrators are Storytellers’ best friends. They are extra eyes, ears and brains, \nand work closely with them to play special Storyteller characters, act as scene \narbiters, and generally take some of the stress of trying to be everywhere at once \noff the Storyteller. Anyone being a Narrator has to have a good grasp of the rules \nof the game, both official and in-house. A Narrator also has to be reliable, as he \ntakes on some of the responsibilities of a Storyteller. There is no limit as to the \nnumber of Narrators your game can have, but a good ratio of players to Narrators \nis between five and 10 to one. One caveat about working with Narrators is that \na Storyteller must go over what she wants for the game, and it is imperative that \nthe Storyteller keep the Narrators informed on a regular basis in order to not have \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nto overrule them and undermine their authority. Narrators who aren’t clearly \ninformed about what it is you want from them from session to session are of no \nhelp to you, and will probably feel frustrated that they aren’t sure what they’re \nsupposed to be doing. Narrators should be visible as such, whether they’re in \ncostume as a Storyteller character or not. Name tags with “Narrator” on them \nwork well to identify your roaming deputies to players, though in smaller games, \nplayers usually learn who the Narrators are in the course of play. \nOne dilemma you’ll have to wrestle with in choosing Narrators is whether \nthey will be functioning player characters with a stake in the plotlines, or are \nthey fringe-dwellers, acting as Storyteller characters or as an extra hand for you. \nOf course, if your Narrators are also players, they have to tread carefully to avoid \nusing information that they may have gleaned from Storyteller interaction. \nThey might make decisions that unfairly benefit their own characters. Because \nof this potential for corruption, it’s important that Narrators who are also \nplaying their own characters be of high and unquestionable character. \nKEEPING THE FISH HOOKED \nIt’s not enough as a Storyteller to present the game to players; the game has \nto be interesting, captivating, thrilling, challenging, engaging and a host of \nother adjectives. In short, you have to make players want to play the game. \nInevitably, no matter what you do, you’re going to have players complain of \nboredom (which usually means that they’re not sure what their character \nshould be doing). Don’t gnash your teeth in frustration, aching to show them \nhow many plots are happening right under their noses that they’re seemingly \nunaware of. Accept that you can’t please everyone all of the time, and just do \nyour best to make the game unpredictable and fun. That’s not to say that all \nplayers who make this complaint are crackpots. What you have to determine \nas a Storyteller is whether there is validity to the cries of “I’m bored!” (maybe \nit really wasn’t such a good idea to create a game around that year’s tax laws), \nor whether those players, for whatever reason, are not as involved with your \nplotlines as they might like to be. Either way, if there’s a lack of interest, it’s up \nto you to determine what can or should be done about it. \nHOW M A N Y  MUMMIES? \nThe Amenti bring particular challenges to a game setting due to a number \nof peculiarities in their story. Stories about the pursuit of Balance, lost lives, \nimmortality and high morality are very challenging and not for the faint of \nspirit (for Storyteller or player). Amenti have few reasons to congregate each \nweek in the same way that vampires gather for Elysium or changelings meet at \nthe freehold. You may also have problems with finding players -perhaps you \nhave only three players interested in Resurrection, or the troupe currently \nenjoys their Ascension chronicle too much to pick up something else for a \nwhile. So now what? \nThe Amenti recognize that their duty to Ma’at takes them far afield, and \nsometimes adversity makes strange bedfellows. That said, Amenti are fine \ncharacters to seed into other World of Darkness chronicles. For all intents and \npurposes, they are human - \nimmortal humans, to be sure - \nand humans can \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nstrange old man who keeps an “understanding” with the prince, the femme fatale \nwho’s also a brilliant chemist, or the scarred laconic gent who steps out of the \nshadows to protect an inexperienced hunter and disappears just as mysteriously. \nSolo Amenti characters can be easy to find. Sometimes, you can announce \nthat you’ll accept Amenti characters in your mortal or mage chronicle, and the \ninterested will respond (therest being too happy with their current characters). \nYou could also end up with a slew of mediocre histories from mediocre players \nwho just want the thrill of playing something with kewl powerz. If no candidate \nstands out, another option is to have Amenti be “by audition”- \noffer \nmummies to those that have consistently proven themselves capable of \nchallenging roleplay. This offer can lead to hurt feelings, but point out to any \nwhiners that the Amenti are high-stakes roleplaying, and until you see them \nbring in characters other than their latest leather-jacketed, six-Flaws-and- \nthree-derangements, quoting-Monty-Python Wolverine clones, you’re not \nsure they’re up for the challenge. In the end, it’s your game, and you know best \nhow you want the trains to run. \nShould you be so lucky as to have more than five folks show up with an \ninterest in Resurrection, your job becomes tougher. Mummies rarely gather in \nlarge groups outside the Web of Faith or h a t ,  and unless you want to set your \ngame in the Underworld or a foreign location (which comes with an entirely new \nset of worries in addition to the usual ones of Storytelling), you need a reason for \neveryone to get together. You might set the chronicle in one of the various sects \nthat numbers mummies among its beneficiaries and leaders. The Ashukhi \nCorporation takes on the monstrous behemoths of World of Darkness industry, \nand a chronicle of high-stakes corporate maneuverings against one of the \nsubsidiaries of Pentex and the minions of Apophis could be very exciting indeed, \nparticularly if you feel like being adventurous and crossing the streams with a \nGarou chronicle. Perhaps Ashukhi archaeologists are competing with Setites to \nhunt down Egyptian artifacts. There are several also religious sects among the \nmummies, from the Shemsu-heru to the Cult of Isis to the Eset-a, where \nmummies and mortals frequently assist one another on various tasks. This may \nbe an established cell tasked with a particular job, or it may be newly formed and \nset down in the midst of the enemy in an effort to create a foothold for Ma’at. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAs the Amenti travel the spiritual pathways between death and life, so do \nothers navigate their own vessels through the World of Darkness. Some, like \nthe Children of Apophis, are outright diabolical and oppose the Amenti at \nevery opportunity. The motives and origins of many others, however, are \nshrouded in mystery. \nIt’s difficult to give the exact statistics of an antagonist, as players will (by \ndefault, after reading this) know their opponent’s strengths and weaknesses \nalready if they’re presented in excruciating detail, and that will take much of \nthe suspense out of the encounters. Therefore, this is only intended to be a \nguide to the beings that players will encounter. \nAPEPNU \nAs the Amenti serve Osiris with righteousness and compassion, so do the \nApepnu (Children of Apophis, or Bane mummies) serve Apophis with \ncorruption and cruelty. In older days Set stole and perverted the Rite of \nRebirth, melding Banes - demonic spirits with no concept of humanity - \nwith evil humans, creating the perfect tools for the Corruptor. They were \nintended as the dark mirrors of the Amenti, and they did their jobs very well \nindeed. \nFortunately for the Amenti, there are only seven of these accursed Bane \nmummies in existence. They are Amam the Devourer, Hau-hraof the Backward \nFace, Hemhemti the Roarer, Kharebutu the Fourfold Fiend, Qetu the Evil \nDoer, Saatet-ta Darkener of the Earth, and Tutu the Doubly Evil One. In a \ntechnical sense, Qetu and Saatet-ta are female, though such pedantic physical \ndistinctions mean little to creatures never meant to spawn. \nFor centuries, the Apepnu occasionally aided the vampires known as the \nFollowers of Set. However, recent events have seen the two groups apparently \nworking at cross-purposes. Some Amenti believe it’s merely a ruse to fool the \nunwary, while other wonder if some enmity has arisen between Apophis and \nhis once-favored servant, or if the Bane mummies have spumed their creator \nfor Apophis. \nThe path of resurrection is similar between Bane mummies and Amenti, \nexcept that when they are killed, Bane mummies do not face the Judges of \nMa’at; instead, their soul plummets directly to Apophis’ hellish abyss, to be \nspewed forth again to the physical plane when needed. Because of the vagaries \nof their perverted version of the Rite of Rebirth, the Children of Apophis’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nor use any Appearance-related Social Trait without the use of disguising magic \n(unless otherwise noted in the Bane’s description). As well, while their true \nform is apparent, Banes may not initiate any kind of Social Challenge, except \nto intimidate, mislead or bully (though they may defend as usual). Bane \nmummies share certain base Traits and have individual quirks and abilities \nunique to the Bane in question. Bane mummies are rare and atrociously \npowerful, and should be encountered neither lightly nor often. They are the \nSeven Faces of Apophis and did not survive this long against all the forces of \nMa’at without being manipulative, clever and utterly ruthless. Many Amenti \nhave learned that the presence of a Bane mummy means terrible evil to follow. \nBANE MUMMY (APEPNU) \nExample Attributes: Assume all Banes to be 15 Traits or better in each \ncategory. \nExample Abilities: Five Journeyman, four Expert, three Master. Strongly \nrecommended Abilities: Academics, Brawl, Melee, Performance, Intimidation, \nLinguistics, Occult, Subterfuge. Restricted Abilities: Computer, Drive. \nPowers: Two Hekau Paths at Advanced, two at Intermediate and one at \nBasic. Bane mummies’ twisted forms sometimes give them unique abilities; see \ndescriptions of each individual mummy. \nWillpower: 10 \nCorruption: 7-10 \nAMAM THE DEVOURER \nIn life Amam was a priest of Set, a corrupt man who amassed wealth and \npower through the vilest forms ofblackmail. Such was his reputation that, upon \ndeath, he was chosen to serve a master greater than his greed. Amam now serves \nas scout, retriever and assassin to Apophis. He has extremely acute senses of \nsmell and hearing, but he is rather stupid and absent-minded. \nAmam’s body is that of a powerful, muscular man. At his face, though, all \nhuman resemblance vanishes. His jawbone and teeth are massive and malformed, \ndistending his face into agrotesque maw. In addition to its size, Amam’s jaw can \nunhinge and distend like a snake’s, allowing him to swallow whole objects up \nto his own size (though it takes him an hour to digest something that size). In \na combat scenario, Amam may attack with his bite as a weapon. To swallow an \nopponent whole, Amam must immobilize the target and succeed in three \nconsecutive bite attacks; otherwise, his bite inflicts two lethal health levels \nwith a successful challenge. If a victim is considered devoured, they may not be \nrecovered in any way (healing, magical relocation) and are dead, for all intents \nand purposes. Amenti (and any other creature with this kind of miraculous \n“back from the dead” ability) may resurrect in the usual manner, however. \nHAU-HRA OF THE BACKWARD FACE \nHau-hra was originally a clever scribe in the pharaoh‘s court who dabbled \na little too much in forbidden knowledge, eventually joining the Cult of Set in \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ntheir sadistic rites. His position in the court allowed him to subtly corrupGhe \nreligious orders of both Ra and Osiris, furthering the cause of Set with every \npriest’s head he filled. Of all the Bane mummies, Hau-hra was most faithful to \nSet, and so the recent conflict between Set and Apophis has left him unsure \nof where his true loyalties lie. To relieve the stress of his predicament, he has \ntaken to kidnapping innocents and using his immensely flexible body to torture \nthem in foul and obscene ways. \nAptly named, Hau-hra’s face is on the back of his head, and his entire body \nis double-jointed, allowing him a full 180 degrees of motility; he is able to move \nbackward or forward with spidery grace. This flexibility provides him with \nunbelievable athleticism, and the ability to quickly escape any physical bond. \nDespite his sadism and appearance, Hau-hra is still an intellectual, wry creature \nwith a morbid sense of humor. He is more in touch with modem times than any \nof his brethren (save perhaps Tutu). \nHEMHEMTI THE ROARER \nIn ancient Egypt, Hemhemti was the wealthiest, lewdest and most \ncorpulent member of the merchant class. His roster of profanity included \nhaving his servants steal, prepare and serve the holy crocodiles of Sobek and \nthe sacred cats of Bast as meals. In addition to these culinary sacrileges, he also \nsated his gruesome hunger for forbidden flesh with his own slaves. Upon death, \nHemhemti was ushered into the ranks of the Children of Apophis, where he \nhappily serves as both strategist and economist, being less physically adept than \nhis brethren. Amam and Hemhemti, who obviously have many mutual \ninterests, have contests to see who can stuff the most human delicacies into his \ngullet in the shortest amount of time. \nAs in life, Hemhemti’s bloated porcine body still expels a foul brew of \nintestinal vapors; alive, these were an effect of his unusual dietary choices, but \nnow it is an even more noxious miasma produced as his continually rotting \nbody releases its byproducts. Hemhemti gleefully uses this disgusting endowment \nto his advantage when a facing an enemy. At will, he may belch forth a \nthundering cloud of this flatulence (the resonance of which spawned his \nnickname). If Hemhemti succeeds in a Physical Challenge against his target \nwhile using this ability (as it must hit them directly), his target becomes \nnauseated and suffers a two-Trait penalty in all challenges for the rest of the \nscene. \nKHAREBUTU THE FOURFOLD FIEND \nWhile alive, Kharebutu moved in the same delinquent circles as Tutu \n(now known as the Doubly Evil One). Although he was quite an accomplished \noutlaw, murdering and robbing with abandon, his infamy couldn’t match that \nof Tutu, who (much to Kharebutu’s chagrin) became known as the Prince of \nTomb Robbers. This deep and bitter rivalry carried over even into the service \nof Apophis, and when Tutu gained the sobriquet “the Doubly Evil One,” \nKharebutu insisted that ever after he should be known as the “Fourfold Fiend,” \nin an effort to make himself seem even more evil than the Doubly Evil One. \nThough none of his arcane abilities hold the number four in any significance, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nhe Kas become eccentrically fixated upon it. He always incorporates it into his \nschemes and lifestyle. He might, for example, attempt to slay an enemy with \nfour strikes, but refuse to finish an opponent who did not die after the fourth, \nor he might have four Reapers with him at all times. He believes this \ndemonstrates his greater evil over the “weaker” twofold Tutu. \nIn his obsession, Kharebutu developed a necromantic rite that allows him \nto graft the arms of corpses onto his torso and animate them, giving him four \ncombat-effective limbs. These appendages enable him to add an extra four \nTraits to any physical action involving his arms or hands (consider him to be \nambidextrous - \nhe suffers no penalties for using an “off’ hand), and while \nKharebutu suffers no damage if any harm is done to the ritually grafted limbs, \nthey may be severed by an appropriate successful attack (the equivalent of two \nlethal health levels per arm). \nQETU THE EVIL DOER \nIt is whispered that Qetu was once unmatched in outward charm and \ninward depravity. Acting as dancer and whore in the Pharaoh‘s court, she \nruined many key officials with her planned temptations and subsequent \nscandals, all in service of Set. Now, Qetu acts as the femmefatak of the servants \nof Apophis, working upon the carnal weaknesses of her targets. She has been \nresponsible for the demoralization of several mummies over the millennia. She \ndelights in preying upon the Amenti’s newfound sensuality to divert them from \nthe path of Ma’at. \nQetu views seduction, especially of the Amenti, as a personal challenge to \nher abilities to become what it is her target desires most. To this end, she \nsometimes tries to affect an air of culture and gentility, but due to her base \nnature it never lasts - \nshe invariably slips into the most vulgar language of \nwhatever culture she’s currently infiltrating. Unlike most Bane mummies, \nQetu seems beautiful at first glance; however, as with all Apepnu, the reality \nof her appearance is anything but. Qetu “wears” the necromantically animated \nskins of beautiful young women, and spends much of her free time browsing for \nher next “outfit.” Her true visage is that of a putrefying, corpselike hag. If this \nmask is discovered, Qetu whips off the skin and uses it like a cloak to distract \nand ensnare foes. When she is using her discarded skin as a distraction, all \nopponents wishing to strike her suffer a two-Trait penalty, and if she makes a \nsuccessful Physical Challenge against a victim, she may ensnare them with the \nflayed skin. A victim thus ensnared must make a successful Simple Challenge \nto escape the “net” on their subsequent action. Qetu often uses the time that \nher opponent is immobilized to escape, and despite her apparent decay, Qetu \nretains much of the grace she had in life. \nSAATET-TA. DARKENER OF THE EARTH \nNo records exist of Saatet-ta’s life before her transformation, and none \nseem to know why she was chosen for Set’sritual. While she is undoubtedly still \na force to be reckoned with, Saatet-ta is the weakest of the Seven Faces of \nApophis. She is treated as the whelp of the pack by her cruel and sadistic \nsiblings, and, after repeated trips to Hell and the constant molestation of the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nto comfort herself, Saatet-ta proclaims herself “Darkener of the Earth,” “Queen \nof a Thousand Ravening Locusts,” and/or “Ebon Horror of Khutu.” Saatet-ta \nwas once a beautiful woman (a fact that contributed to her lunacy when she \nrealized what she had become), but the ravages ofher rebirth stripped her of any \nbeauty she once had. Her skin is blackened and cracked like a dry riverbed, and \nher sparse hair is coarse and gray. She has been known to use Hekau to veil her \nform in an imitation of her lost beauty, but no illusion can hide the mad gleam \nin her eyes. \nSaatet-ta’s Hekau paths are one level less than the other Bane mummies, \nand her form provides her no special abilities. While she may be outwardly the \nweakest of the Banes, there must be some hidden reason she was chosen to \nbecome a Child of Apophis, even if her madness clouds it now. \nTUTU THE DOUBLY EY IL ONE \nTutu was a brave, ingenious and merciless tomb-robber. He chanced any \ncurse or punishment to steal the riches from the dead pharaohs’ tombs, and he \ncleverly overcame evendifficult obstacles and traps. Although he was eventually \ncaptured and beheaded by the authorities, the priests of Set admired his brazen \nthievery and they resolved to steal his body. They sewed his head back on and \nperformed the Rite of Rebirth, and now Tutu serves Apophis as warrior, thief \nand saboteur. Finding it advantageous to keep up with the times, Tutu suffers \nno Ability restriction concerning modern conventions. \nTutu’s neck has been collared with a heavy golden cuff, which attaches his \nhead to the spine from which it was severed. Tutu’s control over his khaibit is \nso strong that he can force his torso and head to separate, animating both his \nbody and his head with evil intent. While his khaibit possesses his trunk, Tutu’s \nhead and spine are free to slither around like a grotesque skeletal snake, each \npart able to function independently of the other. Tutu effectively doubles \nhimself, becoming two distinct characters, each with full Traits and normal \nhealth levels. While his head-spine is more difficult to hit (gaining a two-Trait \nbonus to all uses of the Dodge Ability), it may take no actions requiring manual \ndexterity or manipulation. His body portion, on the other hand, suffers a two- \nTrait penalty to actions involving perception, as the khaibit can only “feel” out \nits surroundings. If either part of Tutu is destroyed, the other instantly expires \nas well, and his soul descends to Apophis for punishment. \nTHE REAPERS \nKharebutu, in his demented experimentation with human corpses, stumbled \nupon the secret of binding an evil ifrit into a cadaver, thus animating it in a \nlimited version of the Rite of Rebirth. In this way, Reapers (also called Asekh- \nsen) were born. Reapers, while fully sentient, are used by the Bane mummies \nas shock troops, and are sent into simple or destructive situations that are too \ninconvenient or dangerous for the Bane mummy to deal with. Reapers are not \nmagically talented, but they make up for this lack with sheer, unrelenting \nhatred. They are immediately identifiable as inhuman by their bloated \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nappearance, distorted expressions and the sickly-sweet stench that surrounds \nthem as their meat slowly rots away. In Islamic lands, Reapers use the cultural \npractice of shrouding the body to hide themselves, often masquerading as \nveiled women in concealing traditional clothes, and standing in incense smoke \nor near garbage bins or charnel pits to cover their smell. \nReapers are known as “Four Jars,” because Kharebutu’s spell allows them \nto beresurrectedonly four times (another example ofhisnumerical affectation). \nEach time an Asekh-sen rises, it must merge with a demonic spirit contained \nin one of the four canopic jars dedicated to it in the initial ritual. With every \nnew possession by an ifrit, the corpse takes on even more of the mutations and \ndeformities that come with the corruption of the flesh, until it is barely \nrecognizable as once being human. If the Reaper dies a fifth time, it cannot rise \nagain. The Asekh-sen’s time in Hell, between lives, is dictated by treating the \nnumber of jars the Reaper has left as the equivalent of its Ba Background rating. \nOf grim importance to the Amenti and the primary reason why reapers are \nsuch tenacious foes is that by placing the correct physical parts of a deceased \nmummy in one of its own repaired canopic jars, the reaper gains another chance \nat life, without further ifrit taint and decay. This chance to end the suffering \nof their continual decomposition, and to renew their existence permanently, \ndrives reapers to prey on newly reborn Amenti while they are still disoriented. \nReapers, for antagonist purposes, possess all the random Traits and \nAbilities of a beginning character, though Storytellers may wish to assign them \nmore Bonus Traits if they need to be beefed up. Reapers take only half-damage \nfrom firearm or bashing attacks (unless it is a called shot to the head). Also, a \nReaper within melee range of a target may vomit a choking cloud of ash upon \na victim with a successful Physical Challenge, blinding the target for three \ncombat turns while they clear the ash from their eyes (with all appropriate \npenalties for being blinded). \nTHE AMKHAT \nThe prohibition Osiris placed on the consumption of human flesh was no \narbitrary decree. With the passage of millennia, however, the true reason for \nthe law has been forgotten by all but those whose fanatical cannibal compulsions \nprompted it in the first place. \nThe Amkhat (“corpse eater”) cultists have survived by blending seamlessly \nwith society, some even gaining positions of power and prominence, and \nkeeping their repellent activities hidden deep in the shadows. They are \nessentially normal humans, inasmuch as normal humans practice ritual \ncannibalism. When the Amkhat prepare a corpse properly, they can gain \nincreased strength and a smattering of the victim’s memories, and so they \nbecome a little more than human with every victim they devour (though the \ngains from consuming humans disappear with time). This gain is not without \nconcurrent risk, however. The gradual dementia and degeneration from those \ndiseases common to cannibal cultures also plagues the Amkhat, which is a \nserious drawback when the benefits can be so temporary. It is for this reason, \nas well as the inherently supernatural essence of the Amenti, that mummies are \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ns preferred dish- the flesh of a mummy grants them extraord \nlife spans, tremendous vitality and even access to ancient occult knowledge. \nEven better, those benefits never fade. \nThe widespread Amkhat cult has become the foundation of Apophis’ \nfollowers, and they have insinuated their tendrils throughout the Islamic \nworld, taking root in cities from Karachi to Istanbul. Followers come from the \nshantytowns, refugee camps and the palaces of the rich. They are drawn from \nthe poor, homeless and hungry with nothing to lose, refugees burned out from \nthe region’s constant warfare, and even would-be reformers who have grown \nfrustrated in their efforts against the mullahs - \nin short, the fringe dwellers of \nsociety who are too tired or ruthless to care any longer about the moral \nramifications of cannibalism and murder. The Amkhat are careful to conceal \ntheir activities and cover their tracks, so their vile acts go mostly unnoticed. \nThey walk unnoticed in society, and indeed, some even attain great position \n(all the better to throw off suspicion). But in the shadows, their ritual orgies and \nmurders, cruel tortures, consumption of hashish and hallucinogens all become \ndevotions to Apophis (in his guise as Iblis) and the other devil-kings. \nIndividually, or even in small groups, the Amkhat aren’t much of a \nphysical force to threaten the Amenti - \ntheir danger is infinitely more subtle, \nand comes from the fact that they walk in all levels of society and thus have \ninfluence in the media, the police, the government and just about every social \ncircle the Amenti might move in. Cultists rarely go toe-to-toe with a mummy \nin a flat-out physical assault. Instead, they prefer to attack the Amenti \nindirectly, through treachery, cunning and subterfuge. \nA typical cultist has normal human Traits, and Trait concentration/ \nAbilities are based on where that person moves in society (a diplomat would \nhave high Social strengths, while a soldier would have high Physical strengths). \nWillpower: 2-5 \nCorruption: 1-5 \nAMKHAT POWER ANTHROPOPHAGI \nBy ritually consuming a corpse (human or mummy), cultists may imbue \nthemselves with a portion of their victim’s power and abilities. The degree of \nprofit the cultist may gain from this consumption is dictated by their skill in \nAnthropophagi (meaning, “human eating”). \nThese ratings are only guidelines; other body parts’ benefits may be \nextrapolated from these examples. An Amkhat’s level in Anthropophugi is equal \nto their Corruption rating, and they may gain the benefits of Anthropophugi up \nto and including their level, though they must choose one per victim (i.e., an \nAmkhat with a Corruption rating of 2 cannot consume both the hands and the \neyes of one corpse, but he may choose either). The Storyteller is the arbiter on \nthe specific boons gained; the Amkhat may not choose what Gifts they are \ngiven through the use of this power. \nAfter the corpse is devoured, the Amkhat must perform a Simple Test. \nShould she fail the test, she is immediately plunged into a bout of madness that \nlasts the rest of the scene (success or a tie has no ill effects). The Storyteller \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nchooses aderangement appropriate to the victimand assigns it to the unfortunate \nepicure. Powers acquired from a successful use of Anthropophgi last a number \nof months equal to the cultist’s permanent Willpower at the time of the \nconsumption, unless it is the flesh of a mummy, in which case, they remain \npermanently. Mummies consumed in this way will be forever missing those \nparts of themselves, both physical and spiritual, until the Amkhat in question \nperishes. In addition to the benefits listed, an Amkhat who devours the flesh \nof an Amenti gains an additional 10 years to her life span per level of \nAnthropophagi used. \n1 \nEyes \n2 \nHands \n3 \nBody \n4 Brain \n5 \nHeart \nThe cultist gains vague, fragmented shards of the victim’s \nmemories (examples include relatives’ or friends’ names, \npasswords to security systems, phone numbers, etc.). \nThe cultists gains one level of an Ability the victim \npossessed. \nThe cultist gains one Physical Trait of the victim. \nThe cultist gains one Mental Trait of the victim. \nThe cultist gains one Social Trait of the victim. \n- \nAnthropophagi works on any human corpse, though the Amenti are the \nonly Supernatural creature from which the Amkhat may gain increased \nlongevity. Anthropophagi may be used as normal on mages, homid-breed \nshapeshifters and changelings (the dead flesh of vampires and Risen is the \nequivalent of eating ashes and shoe leather). Consuming the bodies of \nsupernatural creatures other than mummies confers no special benefits, but at \nStoryteller discretion may bestow some unpleasant side-effects. \nVAMPIRES \nVampires are, at best, beasts pretending to be humans; at worst, they are \nbeasts who have accepted themselves as such. The undead, called ghuls, or \nashirra by the Amenti, survive by drinking the blood of the living. Since \nvampires are little more than animated corpses, they find no gratification or \nsustenance in food or sex, though many go through the motions to cling to a \nsemblance of humanity. Blood and survival are the coin of the vampires’ realm, \nand they will stop at nothing for either. A few vampires, particularly young \nones, try to hang onto their consciences, but the hunger that drives them \ninevitably pushes them further from what it is that made them once human. \nIndeed, many vampires consider human society to be a kind of entertainment \n(a stageplay for them to direct as they wish), and they take great pleasure in \nusing people as pawns in games of their own making to stave off the boredom \nof the centuries. \nWhile vampires possess supernatural abilities, myths and legends conflict \non the full extent of their power. Vampires seem to become more powerful the \nlonger they exist, with newly created vampires being barely stronger than \nmortals, and with the venerable ancients possessing truly legendary powers. \nVampires are more fully described in Laws of the Night. If you do not have \nLaws of the Night on hand, for the purposes of Resurrection, assume the \nfollowing: \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nA vampire uses Blood Traits to power its supernatural disciplineskd \nremain animate. The vampire acquires blood from mortals, most often through \nbiting, which induces an unnatural pleasure in the victim. A Blood Trait can \nbe used to activate a vampiric power, gain one Physical Trait for ascene, or heal \nlevels of bashing or lethal damage. A pint of human blood equals one Blood \nTrait. Drinking a pint of Amenti blood grants the vampire two Blood Traits. \nBecause vampires are essentially walking cadavers, bashing damage has \nlittle to no effect. Vampires can heal two levels of bashing damage with one \nBlood Trait, or one level of lethal damage. Vampires do not age and rarely suffer \nfrom non-magical disease or poison. Because of their static nature, if a vampire \nis scarred or cosmetically altered one evening, she automatically reverts to her \nformer appearance when she rises next. \nA vampire usually has a small array of supernatural powers. These are the \nlegendary powers, such as the strength of 10 men, command of animals, \nwolflike claws, the ability to cloud people's minds or control their emotions. \nVampires with no Blood Traits cannot access their supernatural powers. Some \nvampires even have supernatural speed at their command, allowing them to \ntake extra actions during combat. \nThe teeth and claws of a vampire inflict aggravated damage. \nVampires, no matter what age they might be, are subject to insane rages \nand wild passions, some moreso than others. If a vampire is threatened with \nsomething it fears or is denied blood when in a state of hunger, it must make \na Mental Challenge; failure means it flies into a supernatural rage, and must \neither attack the source of its rage or flee. The vampire suffers no wound \npenalties during frenzy, but it cannot attack except by brawling. The frenzy \nceases when the source of the vampire's fury is dead, removed, or the vampire \ncan attempt Mental Challenges once per turn in an attempt to snap out of it. \nIf a wooden stake pierces a vampire's heart, that vampire becomes \ninstantly paralyzed. An attacker trying to stake a vampire must succeed in two \nSimple Tests after winning a Physical Challenge against the victim. If the \nstaking is successful, the vampire cannot move or use his supernatural powers \nuntil the stake is removed. \nVampires cannot function during the daytime. Daybreak causes an \nirresistible lethargy in the undead, and if one should be so unfortunate as to be \ncaught outside, the sunlight ignites the vampire and she bums to cinders, \ntaking one aggravated level of damage every turn she is exposed until final \ndeath. An immolated vampire must also test for frenzy. As a general rule, \nvampires sleep all day unless extreme emergencies arise. \nVampires can emotionally enslave humans. If a vampire feeds a living \nhuman one Trait of its blood, on three separate nights, the human becomes an \nobsessively loyal servant. The vampire blood also gifts the human with a \nmeasure of the vampire's power; a ghul, as such slaves are called, may renew its \nStrength-based Physical Traits once per day at no cost. Ghuls do not age as long \nas they drink at least one Blood Trait of vampire blood once per month. \nNot every vampire retreats from the sight of a holy symbol, such as the \nMogen David, the cross, the crescent, holy water or similar things, and most do \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nnocvampires do seem to have a fear of saintly people, whatever religion those \npeople may be - \none Amenti describes a holy imam driving a vampire from \nDamascus. Holy symbols in the hands of such people can inflict damage on a \nvampire as if they were made of sunlight. As such people are extremely rare, \ntheir preservation is considered a duty of Ma’at. \nYAMPIRIC FACTIONS \nThe bloodsuckers plague the world over with cults and organizations of all \nkinds. Some even lair in the lands around the Web of Faith. \nFOLLOWERS OF SET \nThese vampires are considered the Amenti’s deadliest foes, beyond the \nChildren of Apophis. Unlike other vampires, most Setites do not engage in \npetty games of intrigue and one-upmanship. Instead, they are committed to \nsnuffing out the flame of Ma’at to serve the will of their dark god. They claim \nto be the progeny of Osiris’ monstrous brother Set, and as such, they attempt \nto either rid the world of the Amenti or to corrupt them to his service. \nSetites usually congregate in areas of urban blight, in small broods where \nthey may set up a temple. Once they used to work with Bane mummies, but \nlately they have apparently been at odds with them. The Setites may end one \nplot of the Apepnu, only to raise something equally loathesome in its place. \nThe Amenti would dearly love to come up with some way to set both groups \nat each others’ throats as a whole. \nSetites are generally like other vampires, suffering the same weaknesses \nand enjoying the same strengths, with a few exceptions. Set’s progeny seem \nuncommonly fearful of the light, and many shrink even from brightly lit rooms. \nThey also possess unusual powers whereby they can spend blood to assume \naspects of Apophis himself, such as changing their own tongues into a serpent’s \nwhich can be used as a weapon, or to draw blood instead of via fangs. Some may \nchange their skin into a serpent’s, granting them some resistance from damage. \nThe most powerful can wholly transform themselves into 10-foot-long black \ncobras with a venomous bite and lashing coils. \nHASHASHIN \nThere have long been rumors of cults of assassins, or “hashashin”, \ncongregating in the lands around the Web of Faith. Now it seems those legends \nare true, and worse, the hashashin are vampires who take blood in payment for \ntheir murderous deeds. They will serve anyone who can pay their price, \nincluding Bane mummies, and they hunt the Amenti readily for their potent \nblood. The hashashin are known to be deadly fighters, and there is some \nquestion regarding who exactly leads and directs their actions. \nTHE CAMARILLA \nThe Shemsu-heru talk of a great cult of vampires whose influence spans \nthe world, reaching into every stratum of society from the halls of power to the \nback alleys. It keeps spies everywhere -who knows who could be its eyes and \nears? While the cult has gone by anumber of names, ‘Camarilla” is the one that \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nyounger Amenti scoff at the notion of a worldwide vampiric conspiracy. \nShould this cult, this Camarilla, exist at all, it appears not to serve either \nMa’at or Apophis, but this is not necessarily good news. Its members have been \nsaid to indulge in Machiavellian intrigues and vendettas against ancient \nenemies, plotting for the sake of nothing more than boredom. As an elephant \ncan trample a mouse through blind indifference or intent, the Amenti feel the \nCamarilla is threat to Ma’at by its simple existence. \nOlder Amenti warn their peers and juniors against revealing anything of \nthemselves to vampires of the Camarilla, as the Followers of Set have been seen \ntreading warily through some of the social strata. \nTHE SABBAT \nThe Amenti have heard little good about the Sabbat. Most tales describe \nthem as a cult of insane, ravening vampires that is ruthless and fanatical in its \ndesires. Rumor subscribes all manner of bizarre rituals to them, apparently in \npursuit of some quasi-religious or military goal. They are known for repulsive \ncruelty and violence, making war on anything (human or supernatural) that \ncrosses their path. In a bit of a good news for Amenti, there have been \nconfirmed reports of the Sabbat battling the Followers of Set over territory, and \nperhaps doctrine - \nthe Sabbat honor the vampire-god Caine, which would set \nthem at odds with the Setites’ worship of Set. \nSORCERERS A N D  MAGI \nFrom the astrologers of Chaldea to the wizards of The Arabian Knights, \npractitioners of magic have long been the subject of stories across the Middle \nEast. Often in their pursuit of mystical knowledge and artifacts, the Amenti \ncross paths (and swords) with others on similar sorcerous quests. Witches, \nwizards, astrologers, viziers - \nhumans with the ability to work miracles have \nexisted in every culture, and the interests of these magicians often overlap with \nthose of the Amenti (in fact, sometimes the Amenti are the interest). While \nthey may show amazing supernatural abilities, they are still human, and as such \nare protected by the Amenti in the spirit of Ma’at. It is whispered, however, that \nthe diabolic agents of Apophis occasionally approach magicians with offers of \ngreat power, and it stands to reason that some accept.. .. \nThere are two types of magicians the Amenti are likely to meet: sorcerers \nand magi. Sorcerers are humans with a limited understanding of magic, often \nbasing their abilities on occult artifacts or arcane formulae passed down over \nthe centuries. They are sometimes referred to as “hedge wizards,” and find the \nAmenti fascinating. Some of the rites and incantations used by modem \nsorcerers can be interpreted as diluted forms of traditional Hekau. Common \nspiritual powers include minor divination, protection and extra-sensory \nperception. See Laws of the Hunt for more information about such beings. \nThe sorcerers known as the Taftani are occasionally encountered by \nAmenti in the Web of Faith, though their belligerent and violent natures make \nthem ill companions for the servants of Ma’at. Taftani magic tends to be \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\noffensive, flamboyant and to rely on the enslavement and control of spirits. For \nquick character creation, consider the Taftani to have the equivalent of one \nHekau path at Intermediate, and three paths at Basic, with emphasis on the \npaths of Celestial, Nomenclature and Necromancy, and a Willpower of 9. (More \nabout them may be found in Laws of the Ascension Companion and Lost \nPaths). \nVery little is known about the mysterious people who call themselves magi \n(or mages), except that they wield unpredictable magical power. Encounters \nwith the enigmatic and subtly powerful wizards known as the Ahl-i-Batin have \nleft the Amenti unsure what to believe, often withdifferent people remembering \nvastly different things about what happened. Some have said the Batini have \ndone nothing but act in the best interests of their surroundings, while others \nspeak of selfish acts that thankfully fall far short of the evil of the Bane \nmummies. Whatever their goals, the secretive Batini are firmly rooted in the \nWeb of Faith, apparently caring as much about it as the mummies themselves \ndo (some even believe that the Batini helped to create the Web, or at least they \nhelp'maintain it). Some argue, however, that the wizards do not openly ally \nthemselves with the Amenti and Ma'at, and therefore their motives are \nsuspect. Mummies who have traveled outside the Web of Faith have encountered \nmortals who seem to share some of the wizards' abilities, though even less is \nknown about them or how they exactly differ from their Batini and sorcerer \ncousins. For a full description of mages and true magic, see Laws of Ascension \nandLost Paths. The Ahl-i-Batin specialize in Correspondence andMind magic. \nAs magi can have vastly different levels of Traits and Abilities, no core \nguideline is listed here. For a quick Ahl-i-Batin character creation, however, \nuse the sorcerer template with the equivalent Hekau emphasis being placed on \nthe paths of Nomenclature, Amulets and Alchemy. \nGhosts are real - \nat least in the World of Darkness. The Amenti are \nintimately aware of this, as not only were they retrieved from the spirit lands \nthemselves, but they travel the Underworld on a regular basis. Conversing with \nthe bizarre djinn of the shifting sands and with the angry ghosts of a war-torn \ncountry, mummies are capable of seeing and interacting with the denizens of \nthe ethereal lands just out of normal mortal sight, often being the only eyes and \nears these creatures can appeal to with any efficacy. But likewise, so must the \nAmenti be wary of the evil ifrit, the angry Bane-spirits which some wraiths call \nSpectres; some of the ifrit serve Apophis and want only the world's destruction. \nGhosts are those unfortunates who have died with a great desire left \nunfulfilled, deeds undone that are too important to forget, or those unwilling \n(or too stubborn) to die. They are tied to places, things and people that were \nimportant to them in life, but because of the storms that now howl through the \nUnderworld, they tend to huddle in places that are rich with death and decay, \nsuch as cemeteries and abandoned houses, for these places can provide shelter \nfrom the storm. \nMore information about wraiths can be found in Oblivion. For the \npurposes of Resurrection, consider the following: \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwithout effort, and they are immune to most physical attacks. Most mortals \n(and some Amenti) cannot perceive wraiths through normal means. Wraiths \ncan move through most material barriers without hindrance, and even move \nin any direction through three-dimensional space. Some ghosts speak of a \nbarrier between the living and spirit worlds, which they call the Shroud. \nWraiths’ power springs from the emotional strength and significance of \nmemories. Wraiths are drawn to events, people and places that somehow \nreflect their strongest passions, and they gain energy, or Pathos, from \n“experiencing” them in proximity. As creatures of raw emotion, they do not \nhave physical bodies; for purposes of stats, their health levels are equal to the \namount of Willpower they possess. \nWraiths can perform a variety of tricks in the mortal world, running the \ngamut of ghost story repertoire, from inhabiting machinery to causing walls to \ndrip blood to full possession of a human or animal. Such efforts cost at least one \nPathos to create, and may last for as many turns as the wraith has Willpower. \nGremlin - \nSome ghosts can nullify or destroy electronic and mechanical \ndevices by inserting themselves into the very machinery. They may send a jolt \nof electricity to short-out a device, or unlatch the safety of a gun, or even read \ndata from a computer. If the ghost wishes to destroy the device, he can inflict \nas many levels of lethal damage as he has Willpower and he spends two Pathos. \nIt costs nothing to step into machinery. For a Pathos, a ghost may even ride a \ntelephone or electrical wire from one area to another. \nPoltergeist - \nThe ghost can perform the classic tricks of a poltergeist, \nsuch as throwing objects around a room, striking objects or living things, \ncreating strange or inexplicable noises and smells, causing walls to drip with \nblood or slime and so on. The oldest ghosts can set entire rooms of objects \nmoving, throw furniture across a room or even upend cars. Such tricks require \nWillpower to be spent (to push into the living world), and they last for one turn \nper Willpower Trait spent. \nPossession - \nThe ghost can attempt to possess a mortal or supernatural \ncreature, gaining access to his target’s motor capabilities. The ghost spends a \nWillpower Trait, and ghost and target go to a Willpower Challenge. This \npower is commonly used by Bane-spirits and Spectres. \nCombustion - By spending Willpower and one to three turns in \nconcentration, a ghost can set inanimate objects on fire. The amount of \nWillpower spent depends on what the ghost wishes to engulf - \npaper costs \nnothing, cloth requires only one Willpower, wood needs two, flame-retardant \nfabrics need three, and hard plastic requires four Willpower. \nEmotion Control - \nThe ghost with this power can inspire feelings in \nnearby targets, such as lust, fear, love or joy. The ghost must spend a Willpower \nTrait and make a Willpower Challenge with the target. Some ghosts like to sing \nappropriate songs to instill the emotion, after the manner of banshees. \nWraiths can only be truly destroyed with aggravated damage. All other \nattacks just result in the ghost being banished for a short period of time. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nGhostscan materialize in the lands of the living by spending a Willpower \nTrait. They can use their powers in the same way. While some ghosts can \nchange their appearances, most usually appear as frightening images and the \neffects of the Veil apply. \nWraiths have Traits and health levels just as every other character does, \nalthough they usually can’t use their Physical Traits, except against each other \nor against other beings in their lands. A wraith suffers no Trait penalty for \ninjury, and it can heal one level of non-aggravated damage with one Pathos \nTrait. \nWhile few humans can sense or interact with ghosts, they may still be \naffected by them; to the Amenti, the spirits of the afterlife interfering in such \na way with those still living is in defiance of the natural order of Ma’at and must \nbe prevented. Because of this, it is often in the Amenti’s best interests to find \na way to either reason with the spirit, or find a way to keep it where it belongs \n- \nin the spirit lands. \nOther spirits touch the Amenti as well, but these spirits have never known \na natural, “living” existence. The elementals are spirits of the very sands and \nwaters, of the sandstorms and desert winds, most often found in places directly \ntouched by the Web of Faith. The evil servants of Apophis, the ifrit are \nmalevolent creatures devoted wholly to the destruction of Ma’at and the \ncorruption of the mortal world. Generally, only mortals gifted with special sight \ncan perceive these creatures. Even the mummies do not fully understand them. \nWhile the ifrit are occasionally found possessing the bodies of mortals or \nrunning errands for their foul masters, most of these spirits occupy remote \nlocations and must be found by an Amenti seeking knowledge or information. \nTHE WALKING DEAD \nBy their own natures, the Amenti are aware that it’s possible toretum from \nthe Underworld. Their trips to the Underworld recently in the wake of the \nghost storm have revealed that a number of ghosts have returned to the living \nworld (whether purposefully or accidentally) and these ghosts now inhabit \ncorpses and walk as the living dead. Not a few of these strange ones carry \nbusiness from their pasts with them, some of which conflicts with Ma’at, \nresulting in conflicts for the Amenti. \nThe hidden is a walking dead that can manage to pass itself off as a living \nhuman. Generally the only things that might give a hidden away are his pallor, \nsome social ineptitude (particularly regarding modernities) and his aura. \nOtherwise there is nothing overtly monstrous about them. They are highly \nindependent and quite motivated - \nenough to deal with any threat that gets \nbetween them and their business. Most hidden have 12 Physical Traits, five \nSocial Traits, 10 Mental Traits and at least eight Willpower. Their Abilities \ncan range across the board. The hidden have 15 health levels before being \ndestroyed and can heal by expending Willpower. \nThe walkers seem driven to fulfill a specific purpose or mission that drags \nthem from their graves and rest until it is complete. One might stalk the \nterrorists that killed him, while another might be driven to protect its lover or \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nchildren at any cost. Once the mission is complete, the body generally crumbles \nand the spirit returns to the Underworld. Walkers’ bodies continue to decay, \nbut most disguise themselves with clothing and perfume, and can pass as human \nwith a little effort. Many often bear the wounds that killed them. Generally \nthey are not interested in conflict with others, unless someone gets between \nthem and their mission. Assume walkers to have nine Physical Traits, four \nSocial Traits, and seven Mental Traits. They usually carry the Abilities they \nhad in life, suchas Athletics, Brawl, Dodge, Intimidation, Screetwise andSubterjuge. \nThey can sustain 10 health levels of damage before being destroyed, and they \nsuffer no wound penalties. They can regenerate lost health levels by spending \nWillpower Traits on a one-per-one basis. Walkers have at least eight Willpower \nTraits. \nThe shamblers are nothing less than vile, typical of the walking dead that \nmost mortals have seen in George Romero movies - \nshuffling, fluid-spewing, \nputrescent corpses that should not be out of the ground. They seem to have \nlittle sentience beyond aneed to hunt and devour the organsof the living. They \ncan sustain 10 health levels of damage before collapsing into ruin, and they \nsuffer no wound penalties. Decapitation or complete destruction of the body \n(such as by fire) will kill them (again). Assume them to have eight Physical \nTraits, no Social Traits and one or two Mental Traits, plus Brawl x 2, \nIntimidation x 2, and five Willpower Traits. \nTHE CHANGING BREEDS \nShapeshifters are exactly what their name implies: creatures with the \nability to alter their physical shape between human and animal, and odd bestial \nthings in-between. They appear to have their own culture, and a blending of \ntheir human and animal social needs. Many of them coexist with humans and \nanimals, having relatives among them both. Changing Breeds, whether they \nbe mammal, avian, reptile or insect, revere the forces of nature, and elemental \nand nature spirits communicate with them frequently (usually favorably). \nThe most infamous shapeshifter is, of course, the werewolf, but there are \nmany other breeds as well. They all have several different forms available to \nthem, they all have powers that mimic those of nature spirits, and they all have \nphenomenal combat capabilities. \nThe shapeshifters who skulk in the regions near the Web of Faith are some \nof the most bizarre of the Changing Breeds in form and motivation, and they \npose a unique problem for the Amenti. While they obviously wield great \nspiritual puissance (seeming to walk between the worlds as easily as any \nmummy), they are also savage, barbaric and unpredictable. Appropriately, \nmost mummies seek a balance with the shifters, observing instead of opposing \nor aiding - \nat least until they have more information about what it is the \nshifters truly desire. \nThe most frequently encountered changing breed of the Web of Faith are \nthe Silent Striders, who would seem to be somehow related to mighty Anubis, \nfor they often take the forms of enormous jackals when they prowl at the \nborders of the Web of Faith but they rarely venture in. While their mostly \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ninoffensive behavior seems to suggest that they are more closely tied to Ma'at \nthan some of their more obviously warlike brethren, they are so secretive it's \nimpossible for the Amenti to know for sure. While they usually travel alone, \nthe Striders are also found in packs of two to five. They seem to gather at places \nof great importance, for no discernible purpose, and a few Amenti (usually \nrepeating tales heard from others) claim that the Silent Striders have beenseen \nin h a t .  \nIn the heart of Egypt, it is rumored that the temples of worship devoted to \nthe goddess Bast once housed more than mere statues. Tales of odd, regal, cat- \nheaded beings wise in the ways of magic circulate even now among the local \npeople, but whether these werecats serve Ma'at or Apophis is a matter of which \nversion of the stories you hear. Like all cats, the Bubasti are content to remain \nenigmas, and the few Amenti encounters with them have not made things \nclearer. \nThe desert is cradle to many serpents; some (like the Followers of Set) are \nguaranteed to be poisonous to the Amenti, but what of the living snake-people \nwho have been seen darting into ancient temples or hidden caverns? Because \nof the Setites' ability to transform themselves into serpents, all who share this \nability become suspect. So long as the cobra-folk's motives remain a mystery, \nthe Amenti are forced to bide their time and watch for a clearer sign of their \nloyalty. \nAlong the banks of the Nile, mighty Sobek's sacred crocodiles still swim, \nbut there are whispers that some of the god's followers are more than mere \ncrocodilians. Tales of living dinosaurs occasionally filter up from Africa's \ninterior, and strange tracks found in the mud of the riverbanks arouse fearful \ncuriosity. For now, the Amenti wisely avoid angering Sobek's children, until \nthey learn more of them. \nFor more information about the shapeshifters, see Laws of the Wild and \nthe Changing Breeds books. For the purposes of Resurrection, you can assume \nthe following: \nA shapeshifter has three forms: a human, a normal animal and a hybrid \nbattle form. In battle form, the shifter doubles its normal human Physical \nTraits, and when it strikes with claws or teeth, it can inflict aggravated damage. \nIn animal form, the shifter has amazing, superhuman senses and all the physical \ncapabilities of that animal - \na cat would be able to see in dim light, a serpent \nwould be able to slither into a crevice to escape or bestow a poisonous bite - \nbut it can only inflict lethal damage. In its battle form, the shifter causes normal \nhumans to lose their senses with fear, as per the Veil. Most times, humans will \nblock the encounter from their minds or find rational explanations for what \nthey saw. \nShapeshifters heal rapidly; they can repair one non-aggravated wound \nlevel every turn. \nLegends claim that shapeshifters are vulnerable to certain materials such \nas silver, gold, cold iron or salt. A blow from a weapon forged from or crusted \nwith the material can inflict aggravated damage on such a creature, provided \nthe material used is in fact the bane of that type of shapeshifter. Silver is \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nconsidered the most common, but the Amenti who know of the shapeshifters \nknow enough that such assumptions can be dangerous. \nA shapeshifter can move quickly enough to perform two attacks per \ncombat round. \nWhen provoked or threatened, shapeshifters can fly into murderous \nrages. Treat these no differently than a vampire’s frenzy. \nThey can utilize various spiritual abilities, or Gifts, to perform supernatural \nfeats. The shifters’ spiritual wisdom, called Gnosis, is what they draw upon to \nuse their powers. Young shifters may have one to three GnosisTraits, and older, \nmore powerful shifters may have up to 10. Gnosis can be gathered at places of \ngreat spiritual intensity, such as where the Web of Faith touches the land. \nShapeshifters can physically step into the spirit lands by spending a turn \npeering into a reflective surface. They can look back out into the “real world” \nby concentrating, and they may step out of any reflective surface back to the \nphysical plane. They suffer no ill effects from the spirit storm. \nOTHER REBORN \nThe Amenti are not the only riders of the everlasting circuit between life \nand death. Mummies have existed in various forms long before the Sphinx \ncame into being. Some, like the Cabiri and Ishmaelites, are well-known to the \nfollowers of Osiris, but the provenance of others is almost completely unknown \neven now. \nEach of the different types listed here may be created as any other mummy \ncharacter, although they may need to be tweaked at the Storyteller’s discretion. \nAll of these Reborn, with the exception of the Imkhu, are known as the \nShuankhsen, or ‘‘The Lifeless.” Their resurrection is flawed in some way, and \ntheir connection to the life-force that sustains them is weaker. The Shuankhsen \ncannot bear or sire children, and if one is ever wounded down to the \nIncapacitated health level, he must succeed in a Simple Test or die. \nIMHKU \nOnce, the Followers of Horus - \nthe Shemsu-heru - \nnumbered 42, one \nfor each of the Judges of Ma’at. Now with their forces and numbers ravaged, \nthey can count only 13 among their ranks, including Horus himself. Those 13, \nhowever, having ritually taken their own lives on Osiris’ direct orders, have \nbeen imbued with the awesome power and knowledge given with the complete \nversion of the Spell of Life, and they can be found acting as guides and teachers \nfor the younger Amenti. The Imkhu are wise and devoted servants of Ma’at, \nand their presence in a chronicle should reflect the weight of their great role \nin the mummies’ fight against Apophis. The Imkhu never interfere in anything \nbut for grave or portentous reasons. \nCABIN \nThese Greek mummies, named after the alchemist who found the Spell of \nLife and translated it (albeit incorrectly), have largely disappeared. A few \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsupposedly remain around the Mediterranean islands. But as they shun the \nAmenti, even reacting with outright violence to them, it's unclear what their \ngoals are. They have a strong self-preservation instinct, probably because their \nonly hope at survival is to avoid coming before the Judges of Ma'at in the \nafterlife, and they are unlikely to expose themselves to danger for anything but \npure self-interest. \nISHMAELITES \nWhen Osiris bade his son Horus and the Shemsu-heru to ritually sacrifice \nthemselves, some of those priests refused. The first to leave the group was \nnamed Ishmael, and so all others that followed became known as the Ishmaelites. \nTheir resurrection is based on an imperfect version of the Spell oflife, and their \nwillful disobedience of Ma'at has condemned them to forever skirt the eyes of \nher Judges lest they be found wanting. Still, despite their prodigal nature, the \nremaining Ishmaelites are old and knowledgeable, and the Judges of Ma'at have \neven suggested that the Amenti would do well to seek some of their arcane \nknowledge, lest it be lost forever. The Ishmaelites are unlikely to reveal \nthemselves casually, however, especially in light of the millstone of shame that \ntheir cowardice has forever hung around their necks, and the hostility the \nAmenti have often shown them. \nCAPACOCHA \nLong before the pyramids rose from the sands, the peoples of Tawantinsuyu \n(western South America) sent their beloved dead into a cycle of rebirth, much \nas the Egyptians would. What are considered to be the first examples of \ndeliberate mummification came from what is today Chile, where the Children \nof the Seal (called the Chinchorro by archaeologists) once lived. They hunted \nsea-mammals and fished, and their lives were filled with ceremony. \nBefore 5050 BCE, amawtas (will-workers) of the Chinchorro stuffed their \nrevered dead with herbs and grasses, packed them in raw (unfired) clay, and \nthen sculpted a detailed new body, complete with facial features and genitalia, \nover the decaying one. The bodies then were dried under the sun (as it never \nrained in the desert) and the awawtas chanted the spell of Going Westward to \nthe Sunrise over them, preparing the mummy for Rebirth. These mud- \nmummies were called Pachamallki, and they returned to the living at intervals, \nlying stiff and still until called on by the amawtas to aid their descendants. \nWhen they returned to life, they told tales of their new lives beyond the grave, \nand exhibited strange powers to which no others had access. While not in the \nliving world, the illi (spirit) of the mummy traveled the Realm of Pacarina \n(called the Dark Kingdom of Obsidian by later ghosts). \nThe Children of the Seal continued this way of life for over 3000 years, \naided and accompanied by the relatives they had made immortal. As their \nculture spread and changed with the coming of corn and potatoes, the amawtas \ninstructed the nearby people, the Chimu, to carry on their tradition. The \nChimu, a nation of farmers and fishermen on the shores of the Great Sea, did \nas they were instructed, awe-struck by the powers the mummies wielded. The \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwere dried, wrapped in cloth, and given masks and artificial heads to make \nthem strong and wise. Like the Children of the Seal, the Chimu brought forth \nthe Intimallki on holy days, introducing each new generation to the living dead \nwho protected them, and “feeding” the Intimallki with offerings. \nThe rise of Mayan and Teotihuacano cultures led to trade and contact \nwith the Children of the Seal and the Chimu. Some mallki even attempted to \nremain with the new tribes permanently, enthralled by the wisdom and \nsophistication of the Maya even as they were repulsed by the penchant for ritual \nsacrifice and torture. When the Incan Empire firmly established itself, it \nbrought together under one rule the peoples of the desert, the jungle, the sea \nand the mountains, and became known as Tawantinsuyu, or the Land of the \nFour Quarters. Naturally, this conjoining spread the arcane knowledge of the \nmallki to everyone in the Inca nation. \nThe jungle peoples of the Amazon created Uchumallki (fire mummies) \nwhich were smoked and rubbed with preservative balms. They were called to \nlife just as the other mallki, and their command over fire and smoke made them \nvaluable guardians in the rainforest. The Incas also created mummies, and in \nkeeping with the ritual, the mightiest of their leaders were “sent westward.” \nThese Inca mummies were the Chaskimallki (messenger mummies). They \nwore gold masks and were housed in ceremonial buildings befitting their \nstation, many of them sent westward in sacrifice as youths, so that neither age \nnor misfortune could rob them of their vigor. These were chosen to atone for \nthe “royal sin” or capacocha, which has since become the name for all mallki. \nOver time, the tradition of the Capacocha grew forgotten and neglected, \nand when the Spanish invaded in 1529, the frantic summonings of the people \nmet with little success. Many of the mallki had lain in slumber for so long they \ncould not be awakened. Those few mummies who rose to the task were quickly \nfelled by the conquering Spanish, and it seemed for a time that the secret of \ncreating mallki was lost. \nOf late, the turbulence of the Dja-akh has roused the illi from their \ncenturies-long slumber, and they have now remembered their duty to protect \ntheir descendants. The spirits of the mallki struggled to return to life to discover \nthat the ritual of Going Westward did not make them as completely immortal \nas previously thought. Their spirits lived on, but they lacked the strength to \nanimate bodies that had all but dissolved by the ravages of time and neglect. \nApparently, being periodically roused by their living relatives was vital to \nkeeping the preserving magic fresh. The Capacocha had to find new amawtas \nto restore their crumbling bodies and return them to life. \nThere were a few scattered descendants and relatives of holy men and \nwomen still living in western South America, and these few, through dream or \nspirit-talk, became aware of the illi and their wishes. These mortals moved \nswiftly and quietly to recover what of their ancestors they could - \nthat which \nwas not destroyed by time or snatched by well-meaning archaeologists. Over \ntime and with increasing skill, they managed to rebuild the bodies of their \nmallki, and recovered just enough of the Ritual of Going Westward to call the \nilli forth to inhabit them once again. The spell was incomplete, however, and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthelife attained (while vital and powerful) was a sterile and ageless semblance \nof life. \nIt’s important to note that the Capacocha are single-spirit entities, and \nthus have little practical experience with the modem world. As well, all \nCapacocha speak their own native tongue, but may be unable to speak \nanything else. \nTHE FOUR SUYU OF THE CAPACOCHA \nThe South American immortals are divided into four suyu, or quarters, to \nsymbolize the four Sacred Things that created them. The four suyu are often \nrivals, but rarely enemies, and each has a purpose (and liability) much like the \nAmenti. \nCHASKIMALLKI \nThe Chaskimallki were Inca messengers to the gods, chosen to die nobly \nin sacrificial rituals. They received special royal treatment to induce them to \nspeak kindly of the priests who sent them to the afterlife. \nStrength: The Chaskimallki returns to life completely restored to health \nas long as the body is kept frozen, or in ice-cold water, to preserve it. \nLiability: The Chaskimallki cannot return to life if its body rots during a \ndeath cycle; it must be kept frozen in order to return. The few alive today have \nmade arrangements to be frozen when they die or even use chemical means to \npreserve their bodies. \nINTIMALLKI \nIntimallki are primarily from the Moche, Chimu or Inca nations, and are \ndesert mummies that have been wrapped in huge swaths of cloth, usually with \nmasks or false heads attached. The corpse retains its internal organs. These \nmummies were made before 1530 CE. \nStrength: These mummies never thirst or suffer from dehydration. If one \nis kept from water long enough, it shrivels into a living but desiccated form. \nLiability: The Intimallki are vulnerable to steel. It causes aggravated \ndamage whether the mallki is living or dead. The Intimallki have so far \nmanaged to keep this a secret only known to themselves. \nPACHAMALLKI \nThe mummies of earth had their corpses eviscerated and then stuffed with \ngrasses and herbs, reinforced with native cane, and packed in red or black clay. \nAll known Pachamallki were created between 5050 and 1720 BCE. No one \nknows how many remain able to return to life. \nStrength: A Pachamallki can repair its body by plastering itself with clay. \nEach turn, an earth mummy with access to suitable muddy material (Storyteller’s \ndiscretion) can repair one health level of damage to itself. \nLiability: When a Pachamallki is dead, its corpse dissolves if immersed in \nrunning water. While living, it is not vulnerable to water. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nUCHUMALLKI \nThe mummies of fire and smoke were born from the jungles of the equator. \nThey were gutted and smoked over fires of scented wood to preserve them. \nThey lived their first lives before 1770 BCE. \nStrength: Uchumallki have a limited immunity to fire and heat. Only the \ndirect application of flame causes any damage, and it is lethal instead of \naggravated. \nLiability: An Uchumallki can be slain with cold. When its body is exposed \nto temperature below freezing, it suffers one level of aggravated damage each \nhour. When dead, the body of the Uchumallki does not suffer this damage. \nCAPACOCHA CHARACTER CREATION \nThe Capacocha are generally created the same as Amenti, witha few extra \nbells and whistles related to their particular cultures. \nABILITIES \nExpression: Kipu \nKipus (or qipus) are a series of “spirit knots” that can transfer memories and \ninformation. With this Ability, you can create records and read those left \nbehind. \nLinguistics \nThe languages of the ancient peoples are not lost to you. The most \ncommon tongue among Andean mummies and many regional spirits is the \nTongue of the Seal, the language of the Chinchorro people of ancient Chile. \nCAPACOCHA BACKGROUNDS \nMost Backgrounds remain the same as those for Amenti, with only \nAyllu \nThis is a mummy’s clan, and represents how much of its living bloodline \nhas survived to the present. An Ay IIu is called on to perform sacrifices, defend \nthe mummy’s corpse, or summon the mummy to life. The Ayllu is a shared \nheritage specific to the region of the mummy, kept alive by a specific localized \ngroup, and ranges anywhere from a few loyal survivors telling tales to children, \nto a few devoted elders who perform rituals to you, to an entire village who \nwhispers your name reverently. At its highest level, you may be fortunate \nenough to have an amatwa hedge wizard who performs sacrifices for you. \nConsider this a mix of the Legacy and Retainers Backgrounds. \ncultural variations on them. \nIlli \nTranslated, “the gleaming.” Functions the same as the Ka Background. \nSamapa \nThe “breath” or physical life. Functions the same as the Ba Background. \nWAKA \nWaka is the spiritual energy the Capacocha call upon to perform their \nrites. It functions the same as Sekhem, but is a distinct energy all of its own. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSACRIFICE \nThe illi can “eat” the spiritual energy released by human and animal \nsacrifices and gain strength from it. Each sacrifice provides a number of points \nequal to the victim’s Willpower, which may either be allocated in any way to \nthe Capacocha’s Waka or Willpower, or into healing the mummy’s physical \nform. This is not considered a pleasant practice in modem times. \nONE SOUL \nUnlike Amenti, the Capacocha are single-spirit entities. There is no \nfusing of lives and spirits for them. Those chosen to Go Westward were usually \nrulers, religious figures, sages and artists, and the selection was made by the \npeople or (more rarely) the gods. Commoners must distinguish themselves \nspectacularly in order to receive the honor. Due to the practice of sacrificing \nthe young, some Capacocha are children, but they return with full Attributes \nbecause they have adult souls. Some eventually age enough to reach physical \nadulthood. Because of the immense gap between their original lives and \nmodern times, they receive the Background Memory x 5 (to reflect their very \nclear memories of their lives) and the Flaw: Anachronism. \nRESURRECTION \nA mallki must be summoned back to life by his descendants or followers \nwhen his spirit is ready (as per him Samapa rating). A Capacocha’s original \nphysical body is also key to rising again - \nit must be returned to the place of \nburial from his First Life before rising can take place. \nCAPACOCHAN HEKAU \nThe Capacocha may use all Hekau the Egyptian mummies may, but the \nfollowing rites are known only to the Capacocha. Capacochan Hekau requires \ntime and challenges relative to those found in Amenti Hekau; see Chapter Four \nfor more information. \nALCHEMY \nBasic \nHumpu \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nWaka: Special \nThis ritual allows the alchemist to create a mixture of road sweeping, \nshaved horn and rosemary which, when burned, restores Traits lost in the \ncourse of a challenge. Each Trait of Waka the alchemist spends on creating the \nHumpu will restore one Mental, Social or Physical Trait lost to injury or illness, \nbut this may only be done once per day. Retest with Medicine. \nIntermediate \nHurtloam \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n'l'ype: Kitual \nDifficulty: 6 \nWaka: Special \nThis ritual allows any damage to a Pachamallki to be healed when mud is \nshaped to cover the injury (this only works with mud mummies). One level of \ndamage is healed for each Waka spent. This works only on a Pachamallki's \nphysical form. Retest with Medicine. \nAdvanced \nRose of Ayacucho \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nWaka: 10 \nThe Rose of Ayacucho is a powerful potion used by desert mummies to \ndestroy their enemies, or protect their friends from harm. Any person who \ndrinks the mixture suffers one level of bashing damage per hour from dehydration \nuntil dead. When dead, the corpse remains indefinitely perfectly preserved. \nOnce water is poured on the corpse, the target is returned to Incapacitated and \nbegins healing the lost health levels normally. This potion does not protect the \ncorpse against damage, and if any further health levels of damage are sustained, \nthe subject dies permanently. Retest with Thanatology. \nAMULETS \nBasic \nBundle \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nWaka: 10 \nThis ritual encloses the corpse of the mummy, as well as various other \namulets, treasures, etc. in yards of hand-woven cloth. When finished, the \nbundle lasts for one century per permanent Willpower the caster possesses at \nthe time of casting. The bundle protects from all normal damage, and may \nabsorb five health levels of aggravated damage before being destroyed. The \nbundle may be unwrapped by mundane means, but the mummy's spirit will feel \nthe exposure no matter where it is in the universe. Retest with Occult. \nMask \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nWaka: 6 \nThis ritual conjures a mask of gold, silver or precious shell that forms a face \nfor the mummy, and allows it to see through its corporeal eyes at any time, no \nmatter where its spirit is. By spending one Waka, the mummy may speak \nthrough this mask for one scene. For Capacocha with living relatives, this mask \nis a useful tool for communication. Retest with Awareness. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSACRIFICE \nThis Hekau is a darker variation of Necromancy, and will draw a lot of \nnegative attention to the practitioner. Everyone but a traditional native of the \nreligion will likely find the practice disgusting, and probably contrary to some \nof the principles of Ma’at. \nBasic \nChalla \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 5 \nWaka: None \nThis is a sacrifice of alcohol. The celebrant must drink huge quantities of \nliquor, spitting and spraying it over the spiritual icon that is the object of the \nritual. For each health level of bashing damage the celebrant incurs from the \ntoxins in the liquor, one Trait of Waka is gained. Retest with Awareness. \nKuchu Pacha \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 4 \nWaka: None \nThis self-mutilation ritual lets the caster gain spiritual energy by slicing \nand piercing her own body. The lips, tongue, genitals or other soft tissues are \ncut or skewered, and the blood is allowed to soak into specially prepared bark \npaper or cloth. Every two levels of bashing damage or one level of lethal damage \nsuffered provides one Trait of Waka. Every level of aggravated damage suffered \nprovides two Traits of Waka. The Waka gained may exceed the Capacocha’s \nnormal maximum. Retest with Medicine. \nPuka Lampu \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nWaka: Special \nThis ritual method of curing disease involves rubbing a puppy or guinea pig \non the afflicted area, then sacrificing the animal and examining its heart. Stains \non the heart demonstrate illness, and the sympathetically afflicted area is \ncovered with medicinal clay. Each Trait of Waka spent heals one health level \nof any type; it works on either the caster or a target. Retest with Occult. \nIntermediate \nChaqui \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nWaka: 5 \nA Chaqui (“ambassador”) is a ghostly servant created by this ritual. A \nsacrificial victim is slain while the caster chants sacred songs, and the rising \nspirit is bound to serve the ritualist. The effects are equivalent to Bind the Living \n(Intermediate Hekau Necromncy). The same ritual used to wipe out sin is \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncha” (“royal sin”) Depending on the circumstances and-the \nvictim, a mummy could lose Balance for casting this ritual. Retest withoccult. \nLuqla \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nWaka: 2 \nWith the sacrifice of animals and/or humans, the caster of this ritual calls \nforth a flood. The total permanent Willpower Traits of all the victims slain in \nthis ritual (most animals usually have one) dictates the amount of rain that will \nfall in inches. Five inches is a downpour, 10 is a tremendous flood. Retest with \nOccult. \nAdvanced \nWay0 \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nWaka: 10 \nThis is a human sacrifice rite that creates a mask made of the victim’s facial \nskin. When worn, the mask allows the practitioner to call upon some of the \npowers of the slain victim. The caster may allocate himself all Attribute Traits \nor Abilities of the victim above and beyond those he already possesses, to the \nmummy’s maximum, for one scene. The mask may be used once per day, for up \nto six months after the sacrifice at a cost of one Waka per employment, at which \npoint it loses its magical potency. Retest with Occult. \nTHE EOMALLKI \nOver the years, the mallki have found their dormant bodies to be far too \nfragile to allow them the kind of immortality the Egyptians enjoy. Changes to \nthe landscape and climate - \ncoupled with human interference - \npresent a \nhost of dangers. Despite all efforts to get around the problem of the destruction \nof the orignal body, none allow the mallki to live as before. As their human cults \nwere scattered and their bodies destroyed, the mallki lost hope that they could \never return to the Living Lands. But recently, things began to change. \nYears of diligent research by a few rare amawtas garnered rumors of the \nAmenti, which was supplemented by illi sojourning in the Underworld. The \namawtas believed that they might be able to perform a ritual similar to the Spell \nof Life, one which would use the ritual of Going Westward as a base and fuse \nilli with the spirits of those strongly tied to the living world. The only other \nchoices would be to use the Egyptian spell or to succumb to death - \nneither \nwas an option for the proud spirits of the Andes. It would be incomplete, but \nmany saw it as their only choice. The result was the Teomallki. \nThese new mummies have been seen prowling the Andean highlands or \nlurking in the slums and barrios of La Paz and some of South America’s greatest \ncities. They do not have the compelling force of Ma’at to guide them, and most \nare primarily led by the illi’s goals. Survival becomes a frequent goal. Some \nTeomallki feel they’ve been forced into their new roles (much like the Udja- \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n. __ \n.. \nsen). Only time will tell if the Amenti encounter these new immortals and join \nwith them as compatriots of Ma’at, or if the Teomallki are a new sort of Bane \nmummy that revels in the gore of sacrifice. \nTeomallki characters create no differently than Amenti - \na newly \ndeceased meets with an ancient soul that offers a return to life. The body \nbecomes animated and takes the two souls where they can find the completing \nmagic. Instead of the old illi (like an Amenti tem-akh) replacing a small part \nof the hosting spirit, the two spirits combine in a shared relationship, with the \nmost dominant aspects of each showing through. Dominant need not mean \naggressive or violent, though - \nsimply those traits that are strongest in each \nspirit. The Teomallki retains a fairly clear memory of his First Life, but the \nSouth American ritual does not allow for the complete return like the Spell of \nLife. By way of a Strength, the Teomallki receives Memory x 3, and for Liability, \nhe gains the Flaw: Lesser Resurrection. \nTeomallki bodies begin to age after a number of decades equal to their \nSamapa (Ba) rating and eventually they will die like any other aging mortal, \nwhereupon the spirit goes to sojourn in the Underworld. The corpse does not \ndecay, though, instead entering a stasis like Amenti. On the next resurrection, \nthe body returns to the physical age it was when the mallki died in its First Life \n(and as many mallki were often young, this is not as terrible as it sounds). The \nTeomallkimay also return like an Amenti, rather than waiting to be summoned \nby the living. Should the corpse be destroyed, the Teomallki suffers like the old \nCapacocha and cannot return at all. \nTHE M7u T’IAN: WARRIORS OF THE TAO \nThroughout history, the philosophers and mystics who followed the \nteachings of Lao-Tzu and his disciples sought to create perfect harmony within \nthemselves in order to come to a greater understanding of the essential unity \nbetween life and death. After the tyranny of the Qin Dynasty, which resulted \nin the persecution of many great sages, followers of the Tao studied many \ndifferent paths in the hope of attaining a state beyond the cycles of life and \ndeath - \nperfect physical and spiritual immortality. Some achieved a state of \nnear-agelessness in the mortal realm, but a few others actually gained the ability \nto cycle between the Middle Kingdom of mortal humans and the spiritual \nrealms of the Yellow Springs, the Dark Kingdom of Jade, much like the \nShemsu-heru of Egypt. A handful of the greatest of these mystics ascended to \nbe with Lao-Tzu in Heaven; they became known as the Eight Immortals, \npatrons and advocates of those who followed Heaven’s ways. \nThese are dark times for Heaven. The August Personage of Jade has \nabandoned his throne, however, much like Osiris left the Amenti, and now \nthere are whispers of a coming Demon Emperor who seeks to rule paradise. The \nEight Immortals have been forced to leave Heaven, as they have no emperor \nto serve, and they face the coming of the Demon Emperor with calm, steadfast \nresignation. They have undertaken not to engage the Abyss directly (the force \nof corruption the Amenti call Apophis), as that would surely be futile suicide. \nInstead, they have decided to preserve whatever purity they might in the face \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nof the impending crisis, with the knowledge that justice and compassion will \neventually return, as balance always does. \nThe Eight quickly realized, however, that they needed protectors - \nbeings that could move through both realms of existence, who could work great \nfeats of magic and survive the burgeoning Demon Age while they themselves \nworked to preserve all that was left sacred in the Universe. They turned to the \nlast 200 sages of the Tao, weakened though many of them had become, to \ngather from among their students those who might best represent the ancient \nway of Heaven during the coming time of chaos and blight. To each of these \nstudents, young and na‘ive as many of them were, the Eight Immortals gave the \nelixir of eternal life in return for their unending devotion to the Tao. These new \nimmortals have been named Wu T’ian, the family of Heaven. \nOnce the student drinks the elixir, she is taken, body and soul, to the gates \nof Heaven where the Eight Immortals waited. After suitable contemplation of \nhow she might best face the coming perils, the Wu T’ian is given a quest by the \nEight Immortals. This quest could take place in the Middle Kingdom, the Yin \nor Yang Worlds (the Shadowlands and the Middle Umbra), or it may even take \nher to the farthest stinking reaches of Yomi, the Thousand Hells. The nature \nof the quest is variable and could be anything from standing guard over the \nSpring of Eternal Yang, to escorting someone safely back to their home. Once \nthe quest is complete, the Wu T’ian returns to the gates of Heaven for a period \nof rest and contemplation, before being given another quest. Should the Wu \nT’ian be destroyed while on a quest, her body and soul return to the gates of \nHeaven for a period of reflection before being sent to complete the original \nquest, or she may be handed another one entirely. \nTHE E N  HEAYENLY PRECEPTS \nThe Ten Heavenly Precepts are the concepts each Wu T’ian tries to \nmaster as he continues his journey through the universe. They need not be \nacquired in any particular order, but should the Wu T’ian act consistently in \na way that goes against the Precepts, he could lose a part of his Quest Trait \nrating, which represents the Wu T’ian’s alignment with the Way of Heaven. \nThe Quest Trait rating functions the same way Balance does for the other \nmummies, and loss of this rating affects the Wu T’ian just as adversely. At \nStoryteller discretion, the Wu T’ian may have to master Gentle Deeds before \nhe can master Honest Speaking, particularly if the Wu T’ian character has \nproblems with shooting first and asking questions later. \nThe Ten Heavenly Precepts are: \nCompassionate Dealings \nThe purpose of the Wu T’ian is to protect the TenThousandThings under \nHeaven, and though they acknowledge a need for balance, members of \nHeaven’s family must never overlook those who are in need. Masters of this \nprecept seek out those whose need is greatest and undertake to deliver them \nfrom their crises. \nGentle Deeds \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthey protect, the WuT’ianknow that they must not becomedemons themselves. \nThey seek to never do unnecessary harm - \neven to the servants of evil - \nand \nto encourage the preservation and growth of all things whenever possible. \nHonest Speaking \nLies serve only demons. Although Yomi has its place in the balance of all \nthings, the family of Heaven opposes the Demon Emperor by speaking truth in \nthe face of lies. Those who master this precept know that truth must be spoken \nat all costs. \nHumble Mind \nThose who follow this precept show no favoritism toward themselves, and \nknow that they exist to serve until the end of the Demon Emperor’s reign, and \nask only to serve as well as they can. The masters of Humble Mind act knowing \nthey serve only a small part of the protection of the world, and they never \nexpect praise or reward. \nJust Decisions \nFor those practicing Just Decisions, there can be no unfair or vengeful \nthought or action. The masters of this precept are the most right and just of \nbeings. \nKeen Observation \nThe Observant has achieved a state of disciplined watchfulness. She will \nnot act hastily; she always observes a situation as fully as possible before taking \naction. Many Wu T’ian who have mastered this precept spend several hours a \nday just observing the world around them, watching for signs of the Demon \nEmperor. \nOuter Harmony \nBy safeguarding places of solace and harmony, the immortal ensures that \nsome of the beauty of the world survives the Age of Sorrows. Those who have \nmastered this precept work tirelessly to protect that which otherwise would not \nsurvive. \nPassion for Learning \nKnowledge is a potent weapon and a source of great enlightenment. The \ntrue sage delights in meditation on all he can learn about a subject. Masters of \nthis precept spend significant amounts of time in reflection and study, and \nencourage everyone to learn all they can, especially about one’s enemies. \nRespect for All Life \nThose who master this precept know that the greatest hope for survival \nmay come from even the lowliest creature, and so they show respect for life by \ndoing as little harm to other creatures as possible. Respecting life does not mean \nsacrificing one’s own, however. Followers of this precept are free to eat and \ndefend themselves and their charges. \nSolitary Heart \nThe family of Heaven must remain detached from individual ties if they \nare to save what can be saved from the Demon Emperor. They treasure friends, \nfamily members and lovers, but know that their quests eventually take them far \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\naway from those they love. They therefore do not look for direction from \nothers. \nCHI \nChi is the wellspring inside the Wu T'ian that powers their Arts. Just as \nan Amenti's Sekhem is spent to fuel Hekau, the Wu T'ian spend Chi to tap into \ntheir divine powers, as well as heal themselves. One point of Chi may be spent \nto heal one level of bashing or lethal damage per tum. Wu T'ian may also use \na point of Chi in lieu of Willpower for a retest. The Wu T'ian regain Chi just \nas the Amenti regain Sekhem, but only in dragon nests or along dragon tracks \n(See Laws of the East). \nTHE KNOWLEDGE OF TEN THOUSAND THINGS: \nTHE ARTS \nThe Wu T'ian spend a great deal of time in contemplation of spirits, and \nnext to none on the meanings of names. Becoming fixated on naming things \nis contrary to the Tao. Inconsequence, the WuT'ian may not leamNomenclature, \nbut instead have an expanded understanding of Necromancy. Costs and \nchallenges are comparable to those presented in the Amenti's Hekau, in \nChapter Four. \nThese are the Arts known only to the Wu T'ian: \nBASIC \nCall the Spirits \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nChi: 1 \nThe wise Wu T'ian is familiar with all spirits. With this ritual (and a \nsuccessful Static Mental Challenge), she may call upon any type of elemental \nor nature spirit to appear. Each type of spirit must be learned individually as a \nseparate ritual. The types of spirits that may be summoned are: earth, air, fire, \nwater, metal, plant and animal. Otherwise, this functions the same as Summon \nthe Dead (Necromancy Hekau). Retest with Occult. \nKnow the Wandering Soul \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 6 \nChi: None \nIn comprehending that all things are more similar than dissimilar, and yet \neach think is distinct from the things most like it, the Wu T'ian gain insight \ninto even the most alien of mortals, animals and spirits. By greeting or sharing \na meal with an unknown creature (this interaction being a part of the ritual), \nthe Wu T'ian may ask as many simple questions (yes/no, true/false, or requiring \nup to a two-word answer) of the Storyteller about the creature in question as \nhe has levels in Necromancy (one for Basic, two for Intermediate, three for \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nChallenge is required to see if the Wu T'ian can discern the desired information. \nRetest with Divination. \nSee the Lands of the Spirit \nType: Spell \nChi: None \nThose on the way to enlightenment begin to see things veiled to normal \neyes. With a successful Mental Challenge, the Wu T'ian may see into the Yin \n(Shadowlands) or Yang (Middle Umbra) worlds to view the happenings and \ninhabitants there. While so engaged, the Wu T'ian is considered to be down \ntwo Traits in all other activities, as she is attempting to process two different \nsets of information. Retest with Awareness. \nThe Way of the Calm Soul \nType: Spell \nChi: None \nBecause the Wu T'ian is knowledgeable about the spirits that reside in all \nthings, he may call out to a single soul that is troubled and ease states of panic \nor anxiety with a successful Social Challenge. If the spirit resides within a \nsupernatural creature that is resisting frenzy or some similar state, Way of the \nCalm Soul grants two bonus Traits to aid in resisting. Retest with Empathy. \nINTERMEDIATE \nBind the Demon's Servant \nType: Spell \nChi: 2 \nThis Art is used in defense of the Ten Thousand Things, as its purpose is \nto bind or banish any malevolent lesser spirit. This Art functions the same as \nBanish the Dead and Bind the Dead (Necromancy Hekau). Retest with Occult. \nBrambles on the Road \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 8 \nChi: 1 \nDistinction can often be as important as oneness to a Wu T'ian, especially \nwhen dealing with spirits. This Art increases the immediate area's Shroud \nrating by two with a successful Static Mental Challenge. The effect lasts for one \nscene. Retest with Cosmology. \nThe Clearing of the Way \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: 7 \nChi: 1 \nThis Art is the reverse of Brambles on the Road, whereby the caster focuses \non the similarities between the worlds and decreases the division between them \nwith a successful Static Mental Challenge. The immediate area's Shroud rating \ndrops by two for one scene. Retest with Cosmology. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nProtect Against the Demon \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Six \nChi: 2 \nThe Wu T'ian seek to protect places of purity within the realm of the \ncoming Demon Emperor, and with this ritual, places that nourish and protect \nlife can be warded from taint. With a successful Static Mental Challenge, an \narea so warded is protected from the servitors of one of Yomi's lords, be they \nlesser demons, mortals or other supernatural. This ritual works similarly to \nSense the Dead (Necromancy Hekau), but has the distinction of working against \nanyone who serves Apophis in some fashion, consciously or not. This can \ninclude anyone from the teen Satanist torturing frogs in his backyard to the \nancient vampires who spread Apophis' corruption. Any such creature can be \ndenied access to the area, the determining factor being a Willpower Challenge \nwith the ritual's caster. Should the caster win, the offending creature cannot \nenter the protected area. The ritual plays upon the intruder's weaknesses, so any \neffect from the intruder simply losing interest to suffering overwhelming fear \ncauses the intruder to flee the area. If the challenge is tied, or the intruder wins, \nhe may enter the protected area and senses no mystical influence, though the \ncaster is still alerted to the incursion. Retest with Occult. \nADY ANCED \nWalk the Barriers \nType: Ritual \nDifficulty: Shroud rating \nChi: 4 \nThe quests of Heaven are not simple to fulfill, and sometimes it is required \nthat the WuT'iango places that are separate from this reality. To cross into the \nspirit worlds, the Wu T'ian casts this ritual, which functions like Separate Ba, \nexcept that the caster's physical form is also transferred. He becomes a single \npsychic entity. This Art is not subject to time limit, and to return to the living \nworld, the Wu T'ian simply repeats the ritual. Retest with Occult. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"
