Those \nAkashics have always had short tempers and a brutal left hook, he thought wryly. No \nsense pushing his buttons just yet. \n“What’s the agenda?” David asked Florence casually. \n“Well, like I said before, matters have gotten quite ... strange, re- \ncently. Dead rising from their graves. Ghostly lights in the church towers. \nChildren spotting fey shapes among the trees of the park and weird email \nmessages without senders cropping up all over the town’s computer provid- \ners. You know, the usual supernatural activity. Just lots of it, all at once.” \nTieman sneered but smoothed the expression over before the others \nnoticed. “It’s nothing that any of us haven’t seen before. I’m not some wet- \nbehind-the-ears Apprentice who’s awed by the sight of a faerie ring, you know. \nI’ve been doing this for-” \n“We know,” David cut him off quietly. “The better part of a millennium. \nAfter all, you bring it up all the time.” \nTieman glowered for a moment then said, “Fine. So we have some of the \nusual unusual going on. So what?” \nFlorence wagged her finger like a lecturing professor. “The fact that these \nthings are happening all at once is what’s so odd. And of course the fact that \nlevels of etheric power - pardon, Quintessential energy - have spiked \nnoticeably almost everywhere in the city, combined with that odd woman you \nyourself spotted at that club you frequent.. . it’s a little too much to be simple. \nSomething is going on.” \n“But the question is, what?” Tieman murmured. \n“AS always,” David interjected. “But we can at least think of possibilities.” \n“Such as?” \nDavid shrugged. “A planetary alignment. A probability storm. A release or \ncancellation of a long-term enchantment. A drop in Technocratic suppression. \nSunspots. Any number of things.” \nTieman re-appraised David, then nodded once. “All right. Any number of \nthings. Your problem is twofold then. One, why should I care? And assuming I \ndid, how would we know what to look for?” \nFlorence spoke up this time. She fidgeted with her goggles again as she \nreplied, “You should care because this impacts the supernatural world that you \nclaim to be so in touch with. Remember, if children are seeing faeries in the trees, \nthat’s something that most Verbena should find quite exciting.” \nTiernan looked about ready to gag. “Because we’re Gaelic-lilting \nfaerie friends?” he sneered. “Faeries aren’t all nice and pretty cartoon \ncharacters, Florence. They get as ugly as nature does. And if faeries are \ngetting so close to children that children can see them, that doesn’t excite \nme at all. It’s disturbing.” \n“Of course,” David said smoothly. “All the more reason for us to get \ninvolved before these matters get out of control. As much as you may like \nhaving the supernatural at your beck and call, it’s too dangerous when it’s \njust loose in the world.” \nL \n1 \n% 1, * *’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

We may not be in the Order of Hermes, and we may not \nhave to worry about their cutthroat politics, but even you must concede that \nthe more we know and the more we take matters into our hands, the more \ncredibility we’ll gain with our fellows. You know what that means - \nmore \noffers to swap information, more chances to get involved in policy, more \nchances to show up your rivals or just another good kick for your ego to say \nyou’ve done something important. This is a fascinating opportunity any way \nyou look at it.” \nTieman mused at David’s rather blunt observation and Florence’s com- \nments, then gave a short bark of laughter. “The stick and the carrot - \ngood \ncop bad cop. I see why you two work together.” Florence and David glanced \nat one another, then David just shrugged again. “All right,” Tiernan said, \n“Let’s say I’m in.” \n“Good,” Florence chirped. “I figure we should check out these various \nmanifestations around the city for true signs of paranormal activity. I can track \nthem with my etheric sensors; I’m sure you both have your own methods.” \nDavid nodded once, and Tiernan produced a length of dark red cord from \nhis coat pocket. “Oh yes,” Tieman said, twisting the cord between his fingers. \n“We have our ways. I’m sure I’ll stumble across something. Shall we meet back \ntogether here in, say, four hours?” \n6;= \n“Four hours,” David agreed. “Let’s get started.” \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

We painted cave \nwalls, pressed reeds into soft clay tablets, inked papyrus and vellum, performed \nplays, illuminated manuscripts, printed books, filmed movies, scripted radio and , , ! \ntelevision shows and programmed computers. Now, one of the newest methods 2 .  \nof storytelling is actually a return to the oldest form. Live-action roleplaying \n(LARP), which grew out of the tabletop roleplaying games of the  OS, is just the \nkind of participatory tale telling that we can still recognize among cultures \naround the globe. It relies on character and story just like the myths of our most \nancient cultures, the same emphasis that led to the creation of what we call \nstorytelling games. \nPI- \n'? \n. \n,.I \nWHAT \nIS Ifirm's Ere THEATW? \nThis game is probably different from any game you have played before.

Each \nparticipant in the drama has a specific persona. Everyone participates by acting \nwithin the character-role they’ve set for themselves, and the story unfolds \nthrough their drives, ambitions, failings and flaws. \nIn Mind’s Eye Theatre, you can explore unlimited worlds. In Laws of \nAscension, you discover the fading majesty of the mages’ world, where willworkers \nof all kinds struggle to keep magic alive in the face of a world that simply doesn’t care \nfor it anymore. The drivensouls struggle to bring enlightenment to a population that \nclings desperately to mediocrity. The battle for reality can take place anywhere, \nanytime, be it in dank back alleys, posh skyscrapers, the savage wilderness, unex- \nplored worlds or even within a mage’s own mind. As the mystics say, once you step \nonto the path, you can’t turn back. No matter where it takes you. \nCHARACT€RS \nWhen you play Laws of Ascension, you take on the persona of a mage, a \nmodern mystic with the power to bend reality to her will and change the world \naround her in amazing ways. Your character can be anyone from any walk of life. \nThe only limits on your character concept are your imagination and a few \nflexible Ales. You create a character, then act out the pursuit of her goals \nthroughout the course of a story. You decide what your character does and says. \nYou decide what risks to accept or decline. \nDuring the game, you speak as your character: Unless you’re talking to a \nNarrator or Storyteller, whatever you say is what your character says. Because most \nof what a Mind’s Eye Theatre player perceives depends on the characters around \nhim, players must be vivid and expressive. The characters direct the plot, but the \nevents of the game guide and develop the characters at the same time, helping \nthem to achieve the story’s goals. As a player in a storytelling game, you have a \nresponsibility beyond simply portraying your character. You need to consider the \nstory as a whole and your role in making sure that other players enjoy the game. \nTogether, you weave a tale that’s entertaining for everyone. \nCreating a character for Laws of Ascension is rather straightforward, \nalthough you should work with a Storyteller to flesh out your mage. Magicians \nare flexible, dynamic people, so naturally you should make sure that your mage \nfits into the game. You need to do only a few things to define a basic character, \nand once you’ve done so, you can play the game. If you take a little time with a \nStoryteller, you can define a lot of your mage’s mystic potential and options in \nadvance, which allows you more freedom during the game itself. \nYour character should be more than just a series of Traits and numbers, \nthough. Rather, she should be a living, breathing personality with a past, \nmotives, drives, likes, dislikes - \neverything you want to see from a character in \na movie or a novel. You also need to take the time to figure out who your \ncharacter is as well as what she is before you start playing. While certain details \nand personality traits will come out while you’re playing her, you’ll want to have \nthe basics in place already. \nCharacters are the heart and soul of a story. Without them, all the patient \n‘ . efforts of the Storyteller are for naught.

      "text": "The basic premise of Laws of Ascension derives from the tabletop \nroleplaying game Mage: The Ascension. It is not necessary to read or play Mag \nNARRATCBRS \nInLaws of Ascension and other Mind's Eye Theatre games, Narrators are \nthe people who help the Storyteller present adventures. Narrators are the \nimpartial judges who describe scenes and events that are difficult or dangerous \nto act out. They adjudicate rules and play the roles of antagonists occasionally. \nGenerally, enlisting the aid of one Narrator for every five or 10 players makes for \na good ratio. Narrators usually play characters of their own as well, so that they \ncan guide the action directly instead of just trying to tinker with it from the \noutside. The best number of Narrators for your game usually depends how \nexperienced your players are at live-action roleplaying. \nYour Laws of Ascension troupe may employ Narrators who oversee certain \nspecific areas of the game. These Narrators - \nsuch as the Paradox Judge or the \nAvatar Guide - \nserve a dedicated function, taking care of potential difficulties \nwith one specific aspect of the rules. Chapter Six: Storytelling describes some of \nthese specialized Narrator responsibilities in greater detail. \nSTCBRYT~LL~R \nEvery game of Laws of Ascension that you play must have a Storyteller to \nserve as the ultimate authority and final judge. The Storyteller creates the basic \nelements of the plot and makes sure that the story unfolds well, in addition to \ndoing everything the Narrators do. Storytelling is a demanding job, but it is also \na very rewarding one. \nThe Storyteller makes certain that the story has content, interesting hooks \nand a narrative flow. A Storyteller should not just sit back and dictate the plot, \nthough. Characters who don't have free will are no fun to play. Instead, a \nStoryteller creates the framework elements of the plot, then turns players loose \nto see what happens. \nDuring the game, the Storyteller must be watchful and ready to create new \nelements to make sure that the story works out well. He is also responsible for \nensuring that all of the players have something to do and that everyone is abiding \nby the rules. Although performing all of these tasks simultaneously can be \nexhausting, the sense of accomplishment you get from creating a successful story , \nmakes the whole process worthwhile. \nSee Chapter Six for detailed information about the role of the Storyteller \nand how to set up your own games. \nPRCBPS \nProps include any item that helps define your character or the action of the i ,! \n: \n:% \nI, 1 \n.)

      "text": "IT’S QNLY A G\n~\nE\n \nThis rule is the most important one by far. If a character is killed, if a plot \nfalls apart or if a rival wins the day, it’s still only a game. If you take things too \nseriously, you’ll spoil not only your fun but everyone else’s around you as well. \nFor that matter, so what if tragedies befall your character? Remember, the hero \nmay not always win, but that doesn’t mean the story isn’t entertaining. You can \nrelish the setbacks as well as the victories. \nLeave the game behind when it ends. Playing Laws of Ascension is a lot of \nfun. Spending time talking about the game is great. However, calling the person \nwho plays the Chantry head at 4:13 AM on Sunday to discuss an idea your \ncharacter has for a new rote is another matter entirely. Keep a little perspective. \nNCB TCBUCHING \nNever actually have physical contact with other players, no matter how \ncareful you are or how innocent you believe the gesture is. Accidents can \nhappen, intentions can be misinterpreted, and someone might get hurt. Rely on \nthe rules to cover physical logistics. \nN e  STUNTS \nNever climb, jump, run, leap or swing from anything during a game. Keep the \nreal-world action in your action-packed game low-key. If you can imagine that \nyou’re a staff-twirling mystic who can bend reality on a whim, you can imagine that \nyou’re leaping over fences and running from pursuers as well. Avoid attracting the \nattention of people who aren’t playing, and use your imagination to its fullest. \nNCB WWCBNS \nFake or real weapons of any sort are absolutely forbidden. Even obviously \nsilly toy weapons are not allowed, just for safety’s sake. Such props give other \npeople the wrong impression about what you’re doing, and they could conceiv- \nably be mistaken for the real thing in the dark. Use item cards to represent \nweapons instead, no matter how cool you think it would be to wear a model of \nyour Etherite’s new Antimatter Discombobulater Ray Gun on your belt. \nNe DRUGS CBR DRINKING \nThis rule is a real no-brainer. Drugs and alcohol do not inspire peak \nperformance at any activity. They hamper your ability to think and react \nquickly, and at the very least, they screw up your roleplaying ability. Players \nimpaired by drugs or alcohol are a danger to other players and to the game as a \nwhole. Nothing is wrong with playing a character who’s drunk or stoned, but \nactually bringing illicit substances and paraphernalia to a game is in bad taste at \nbest and illegal at worst. Don’t do it. \n& ~ I N W U L  w @THEM \nRemember, not everyone you see, or who sees you, is playing the game. A \ngame can be unnerving or even frightening to passersby. Be considerate of \nnonplayers in your vicinity, and make sure that your game-play actions are not \nI \ngoing to alarm anyone if you are in a public area. Trying to explain to a policeman 5 \nthat you didn’t really conduct a Satanic ritual on your friend - \nyour wizard just \nperformed the rite of Gilgul on his shaman - \nis often an exercise in futility. \n~ r, \nI \n,. \n1 1  * *’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Each mage is human, true, but he \nis a human touched by destiny and Awakened to a wider world. \nA great many half-truths and falsehoods surround the myths of mages. Some \nare based in history, some were once true but are true no longer. Others were \nsimply paranoid folk tales from the start. The following list lays some of the most \ncommon misconceptions about the workers of magic to rest. \nMages must use formulae to cast their spells. False. Although mages can \nand do rely on certain rituals to perform magic, most devise their spells from their \nownexperiences. With the right knowledge, mages can even create spells on the \nspot for specific needs. \nMages pass on magical abilities in their own families. False. Mages \nAwaken to the power of magic regardless of genetic heritage. However, some \nmages inherit unique characteristics through family curses or boons. \nMages consort with demons and infernal powers to gain their magic. \nFalse.. . usually. A mage's power stems from the belief, will and enlightenment \nwithin. However, a belief in the power of the infernal can lead a mage to work \nMages cannot be hurt by mortal weapons. False.

      "text": "Magic and technology are mutually exclusive. False. Reliance on technol- \nogy and science is just another form of belief, so it works as well as a faith in magic. \nIn fact, many mages use advanced technological foci to perform their Effects. \nMages seek power and enlightenment. True. The quest for magic is \nultimately a journey of internal exploration. Those who survive learn and grow \nmore powerful. Eventually, mages hope to surpass the limits of this universe and \nachieve a higher state of being through the process called Ascension. \nTHE \nAWAKENING \nThe process that sets a mage apart from the average person is called the \nAwakening. For some mages, the Awakening is a gradual process that leads \nultimately to anew level of awareness. For others, it's the result of some horrible \ntrauma or shock. Once a human Awakens, though, there's no turning back. That \nperson is a mage, and with the Awakening comes the realization that the \nindividual can change the world, for better or for worse. How the new mage acts \nupon this knowledge depends on the individual. \nDuring the Awakening, a prospective mage may experience sudden visions, \ndreams, hysterical emotion or surges of magical power. Strange phenomena may \nsurround the neophyte as his magical power rages unchecked, reshaping the world \naccording tohisdesire. Somemagesdescribemeetingspirits, speaking toangelsor even \nseeing the true form of their souls. Others are tormented by demons or visions from the \npast. A few have no unusual experiences other than a sudden change of paradigm. \nStill, the mage eventually settles into his power, and he must learn to \nchannel it, lest he be consumed by it. All that the Awakening does is show the \nnew mage that he can change the world; it does not show him the practices that \nmake such changes possible. Some mages go insane from the force of the \nexperience. Others try to deny their newfound abilities, only to find themselves \nthrust into strange circumstances beyond their control. Many mages discover \ntheir destiny or evidence of past lives and deeds as a result of Awakening. \nUltimately, the mage comes to recognize that not only can he reshape the \nuniverse, he can recast himself. The exploration of magic is a process of change. With \nenough enlightenment and skill, the mage can become something more and better \nthan human through a mythical process called Ascension. However, that road is long, \ntrying and treacherous for a newly Awakened magician living in these desperate times. \nTHE TRADITI~NS \nGone are the days of wizards who hurled fire and battled dragons. Lost are the \nmystics who saw through the veil of time and death. Only shadows of those powerful \nmagicians exist today, and they band together in a group called the Traditions. \nThe Traditions formed during the early Renaissance as a body of mystics \nwho gathered from around the world. A new reliance on science and reason had \nshaken the very foundations of magic. Mythical creatures were becoming \nextinct, and magical energy was growing scarce. In the face of this desperate \nsituation, nine of the largest groups of magicians came together and pledged to \nstand for the practice of magic. Today, the Traditions uphold secret magical \ntechniques and spread their wisdom to the select few who will listen. \nThe Traditions claim all manner of mysticism and unconventional \npractice as their bailiwick, although their membership can be exclusionary. \nMages who are not trained in their techniques are shunned and sometimes \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Nevertheless, the Traditions do usually \nstand heroically as mages of many and varied stripes who hope to make a real \ndifference and return a sense of the magical to the world at large. The modern \nTraditions are the Akashic Brotherhood, the Celestial Chorus, the Cult of \nEcstasy, the Dreamspeakers, the Euthanatos, the Order of Hermes, the Sons \nof Ether, the Verbena and the Virtual Adepts. In spite of their differences they \nusually work together for common good. \nHistorically, the Traditions have been very authoritarian. Elderly mages \npass on their secrets to eager Apprentices, but they also hold sway over policy \nas a result of their influence and knowledge. Of course, ancient wizards arguing \nover hundred-year-old squabbles often caused the Traditions to suffer from a \nlack of direction. Many Tradition mages simply weren’t in touch with the \nmodem world, and they longed for bygone days of magic. Modem disasters and \ncrises among mystics have seen to it that few potent Archmages remain. In \ntoday’s Traditions, the leaders are the up-and-coming mages who can figure out \nmagic for themselves and take a positive direction and stand. \nAs a body, the Traditions make formal pronouncements about policies and \nset down judgments that are theoretically binding to all members. The Tradi- \ntions decide among themselves how to allocate magical resources and how best \nto pursue their goal of saving the world’s dying magic. A Tradition Council, \nnominally made up of a representative from each Tradition, generally discusses \nplans and votes on all proceedings. Missives both magical and mundane then \ntake the results far and wide to Tradition mages across the world and beyond. \nIndividual cabals of mages enforce these policies as they see fit, but few would \nbuck the combined weight of the Council. In addition to the formidable skills \nof its members, the Council can call upon mages from around the world to make \nits will known. Those mages who bring great harm to the Traditions or to \nSleepers may face severe consequences, ranging from ostracism to branding of \nthe offender’s soul to the permanent destruction of the mage’s mystical power. \nThe greatest threat facing the Traditions now is the weight of their own \nimpending extinction. Humanity chose reason over mysticism several hundred \nyears ago, and magic has been disappearing from the world ever since. Now, \npeople have grown so complacent that most individuals can’t even be bothered \nto forge directions for their own lives and make responsible choices for them- \nselves. The Traditions want to alter this momentum, but they’re fighting a losing \nbattle. With their own magical resources tapped, the Traditions can only hope \nto influence society subtly in hopes of catching a few people here and there and \n2 : causing them to experience a wider world. To this end, the Traditions move \n+ about secretly looking for people who might have the potential to become \n* powerful new mages. \nMages who hope to advance in the Traditions do so through a combination \nof political gamesmanship and magical skill. Each individual Tradition teaches \nits own form of magic, which can take a lifetime to master. The skilled mage must \n‘ *  learn to channel those powers, but also to see eye-to-eye with his counterparts \n’ and contemporaries in other Traditions. The mage must juggle the demands of \nhis mundane life with the politics of Tradition mages who vie for scarce magical \nresources, specialized training or choice treasures.

      "text": "THE TKHNWRACT \nThe Technocracy is the chief adversary of the Traditions and (some would \nsay) the architect of the modem world. This collection of mage-scientists hails also \nfrom the Renaissance, but the order itself has a decidedly different inception. \nVisionaries who dreamt of a safe, stable, classifiable world came together at a great \nconvocation to draft articlesof their own secret society, an organization that would \npromote and disseminate the most sublime rational insights ever achieved. Few \nrealized that this vaunted science and technology was just as visionary and world- \nchanging as magic. Indeed, every Enlightened scientist of the Technocracy was \nand is a mage whose belief empowers his phenomenal science. \nThroughout the Renaissance, the nascent Order of Reason hunted down \nand exterminated supernatural threats to humanity and helped to build an \norderly society upon principles that anyone could learn and use. The way this \nOrder-turned-Technocracy turned out, though, is far from the original intent. \nThe modem Technocracy influences and infiltrates high technology institu- \ntions and government organizations all over the world, in hopes of quashing the \nunexplainable, providing the simple sustenance of life to the common man and \neventually seeking a world of complete order. \nThe Technocracy exerts a hidden but pervasive influence on many levels \nof humanity. Technocratic inventions are disseminated throughout the world \nto become accepted as normal. The Technocracy's greatest strength is the \nuniversal usefulness of its inventions to the common man, which guarantees the \nsupport of average people. Various groups in the organization watch over \nhumanity and make adjustments to affect economics, scientific development \nand social progress. They weed out undesirable traits and encourage useful \nqualities in specimens from among the Masses, although the definition of such \ntraits depends on who within the Technocracy asks. \nFor the better part of several centuries, the Technocracy turned its resources \ntoward wiping out mages, and Technocrat agents are still deadly enemies today. \nThe scientists consider unclassifiable magic a danger to humanity, and they work \nto subvert or even kill Traditionalists. However, the Technocracy also spends an \ninordinate amount of time and resources policing the world. Technocrats have a \nplan to reshape the world for the better, but doing so means involving themselves \nin politics, social and religious movements, global economies and other high- \ninvestment projects. Considering all these responsibilities, the Technocracy has \nits hands full enough. Throw in a world that's far stranger than the scientists want \nto admit, and it's clear that the Technocracy just can't do everything it wants. Still, \nthis daunting load has not yet broken the Technocracy's back. Some Technocrats \nare real heroes who champion medicine, advanced communications and other \nmodem conveniences that make life safer and better. The Technocracy will \nshepherd the world down a safe, static, predictable path, regardless of the cost. \nDISPARATES \nAND @RPHANS \nSince as many forms of magical practice exist as there are magicians, not all mages \nfall easily into step with the Traditions or the Technocracy. Disparate mages cling to \na Craft or organized magical subculture, rather than join any particular Tradition. \nOrphans, on the other hand, Awaken and discover their magical potential without a \nmentor, and they must learn magic through their own hard experience. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "Disparates are actually fairly common among mages, although not every \nmage really knows one. The individual cultures that cling to magical beliefs still \nshield mages who arise from those cultures. Religious crusaders, djinni-summoners, \ncandomble practitioners and more thrive in their isolated enclaves and hand \ndown their magical practices. By far, the most prevalent of the Disparates are the \nHollow Ones. This loose affiliation of nihilistic mages sometimes aids the \nTraditions, but most of the individuals thumb their noses at the very idea of a \n\"magical organization.\" Instead, most Hollow Ones spend more time observing \nthe decay and death of the modern world with morbid fascination. \nOrphans come from all walks of life. Sadly, mages aren't always around to \nteach and shepherd the newly Awakened. While some such abandoned mages \ngo mad or destroy themselves, others develop their own eclectic magical \nmethodologies. An Orphan might pick up a book on New Age occultism and \ndecide that it must have something useful. Of course, an Orphan could theoreti- \ncally build his magic on any number of foundations - \neven deleterious \nprinciples like human sacrifices and maltheism - \nso more properly schooled \nmages are quite leery of these unknown quantities. Often, Orphans must keep \ntheir heads down since both Tradition mages and Technocrats consider them \ndangerous mavericks with uncontrolled powers. \nS@RCEMRS AND SERWCBFG \nSince even before the Dark Ages, mages haven't worked alone. Sure, mages \nlike to claim credit for great human innovations and discoveries, but the fact is \nthat while mages may blaze new paths for humanity, it's up to everyone else to \nfollow. Miracle workers can't do everything alone, so many surround themselves \nwith ranks of assistants, acolytes, confederates and hangers-on. \nIn fact, mages aren't the only people who do magic! True, the Awakening \nshatters perceptions and turns someone irrevocably into a mage, but some \ndetermined occultists unearth resonating truths or powers without ever Awak- \nening. These sorcerers can stand with the Traditions or Technocracy, or they \ncan simply go their own way. Their powers are not as flexible as those of \nAwakened mages, though, for the sorcerers don't have the skill to reshape the \nuniverse at whim. Nevertheless, few magicians would deride them. Anyone who \ncan perform magic is a beacon of hope in this stark modem age. \nDealing with magic is dangerous even for mages, and it is even more so for \nthe few sorcerers who have the opportunity to do the same. Many of the great \nBygone beasts of earlier ages and the spirits in other worlds are inimical to \nhumanity and dangerous. Charms or spells gone awry can strike low their casters, \nnot to mention the defenseless Sleepers nearby. However, a few un-Awakened \n^d people still stand with mages for the taste of power or the chance to live and work \nwith a magician. Some even do so simply out of love, ambition or hope. Those \nassistants are called consors, acolytes or simply friends and companions. Some- \ntimes, those with no talent for magic can learn about the ins and outs of theory, \nI the requirements for casting spells and the sheer wonder of the magical world. \n* \n- THE ITkmm~ \nITJAGE \nThe 2 1st century hides many pitfalls on the mage's path.

Each Tradition has its own heart and culture, but \ntogether they span the world in hopes of protecting and promoting magic. \nWhether standing against the Technocracy or working for mundane causes, the \nTraditions promote the welfare of mages everywhere by sharing resources, \ncodifying magical phenomena and trading knowledge. \nHISTCBRY \nWhen they hear the tales of ancient plots and wars fought, many Initiates find \nit hard to think of a time before the Traditions existed. However, the idea of the \nTraditions and the Council of Nine is a relatively new invention that dates back to \nthe beginning of the Renaissance. During the Mythic Ages, when magic operated \nin full view of the masses and there was no Paradox to fear, most mages had little in \ncommon with each other. Outside of the Order of Hemes in Europe and some \nscattered groups in China, India and northern Africa, mages kept largely to \nthemselves, learning where they could and uniting under no common cause. \nYet, as the influence of the Order of Reason grew, the Order of Hemes in Europe \nfirst attempted to bring all the wizards it encountered under its banner. The Order of \nHermes assimilated those wizards its mages encountered whose styles and beliefs differed \nfrom the Order's own paradigm. In the Cnent, emissaries of the Akashic Brotherhood \ntraveled across several auntries and took in myriad religious beliefs, while proselytizing \na greater goal of human advancement, Other groups, such as the Celestial Chorus, took \nnascent form withi other supernatural communities as ideas spread to like-minded \nmages. Each group tried to expand and include other magicians under its banner. \nWhen these efforts failed-mages have always beenaproud, stubborn lot, and \nthey do not take kindly to being catalogued by outsiders- the Order shifted instead \nto recognizing formal groupings of wizards outside of itself. It then asked that those \ngroups organize and elect representatives to serve on a grand council of wizards.

Rather, a \ngeneral “tradition” of magical practice, such as spirit-calling or shapeshifting, would \nsuit the Order’s needs just fine. Thus came the recognized term Tradition, for even \nif two mages disagreed over the actual points of their group’s orthodoxy, they could \nstill be counted as part of the same loose magical tradition. \nNine seats were made available on the Council, representing the nine divisions \nor Spheres of magic that the Traditions eventually agreed upon. One mage from the \nTradition that showed the greatest facility for that Sphere held each seat at any given \ntime. Operating from a Chantry named Horizon, the members of the Council \nformulated Tradition strategies, worked to smooth relations between members of \nradically different ideologies and otherwise ensure that the Traditions worked toward \nenlightenment harmoniously. Naturally enough, these lofty goals were sometimes \novershadowed by politics, power struggles and other moments of blindness, but the \nCouncil endured even during the worst of times.

Although time has since altered the way Tradition mages interpret some \nof these ideals, and although each Tradition has its own take on how and when these \nideals apply, the principles that the Council formulated have remained the Same for \n8gi \nhundreds of years. The most common presentations of the Council’s goals are as follows: \nASCENSICBN \nWhile every Tradition has its own vision of this lofty goal, pursuing Ascension has \nbeen the Council’s staunchest position since its foundation.

While some Traditions use different titles, and others use none at \nall save when addressing outsiders, the system has made it possible for mages of \ndiffering backgrounds to gauge eachother’s experience and temper their reactions \naccordingly. This system is still in use, even in the wake of the recent flight of many \n! of the more enlightened mages. (For the titles and game mechanics inherent to \nthis system, see “Reputation” in the Rules, Systems and Drama Chapter, page 213.) \nWhile bringing enlightenment to all is a noble goal, the reality is that not \neveryone is ready to Awaken, and many consider even the slightest hint of the \nsupernatural extremely dangerous. The witch-buming fires of the Inquisition stand as \ntestament to the frightening power of the masses to eliminate what they do not \nunderstand. Therefore, the Council created what is known as the Rule of Shade, a \ngeneral prohibition against exposing the workings of magic to the world in a form that \nthe world is not ready to accept. Revealing one’s m e  nature to those outside magical \nsociety or performing especially vulgar magic in public is forbidden, since such acts \nthreaten to start the Inquisition anew and alert the Technocracy to the presence of \nTradition mages in the area. While slips of some kind are inevitable, the mage must \n,” do his best to repair the damage he’s caused. Clever acts of magic are certainly \npermissible since they help chip away at the facade of static reality, but the Paradox \ngenerated by proud and foolish acts usually fiy the mages who perform them, making \nthe sacrifices pointless. If a mage is to survive, he must be subtle, discreet and careful. \nDespite the Traditions’ noble formative goals, time has altered and eroded \n, \nmany Tradition strengths and agendas.

The rules in this chapter provide a descriptive means to build a character, \nboth as a persona and as a set of defining qualities. \nSTEP \n$NE: INSPIRATI~N \nYou start the character-creation process with a simple choice of concept.

Therefore, your mage \nlikely studied with a Tradition whose beliefs already meshed with his own. A \nmage who favors dance and meditation would likely find common ground with \nthe Cult of Ecstasy or the Akashic Brotherhood, while a maverick scientist \nwould fit well with the Virtual Adepts or Sons of Ether. Of course, your mage \nmight not ever have found a mentor with matching beliefs - \nand he can \ncertainly rail against the stereotypes - \nbut the character's choice of Tradition \nshapes how the mage practices magic and how other mages react to him. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

To some mages, this \ninner Avatar speaks and appears, making demands or cajoling the mage along \nthe path to awareness. For others, the Avatar’s guidance is a subtle interplay of \nfeelings, hunches, dreams and emotions. Every Awakened mage feels it to some \ndegree, though, and the form of these compulsions stems from the Avatar’s \nEssence - \nthe persona of the Avatar itself. \nMages recognize four basic Avatar Essences: Dynamic, Pattern, Primordial \nand Questing.

With time, experience and Seekings, the mage can improve \nhis rating in this Trait. \nYour mage’s Arete determines the success or failure of most of his spell \nEffects (see Chapter Four), as well as the limit of how much of the Spheres the \ncharacter can comprehend. Your mage cannot learn a Sphere level above the \ncharacter’s total Arete Traits. Therefore, a mage with only a single Arete Trait \ncan learn only the first level of any of the Spheres. \nUnless you spend Free Traits at character creation, your mage starts the game \nwith only a single Arete Trait. You cannot raise your Arete above three Traits by \nspending Free Traits, however. Further enlightenment comes only with experience. \nMages have strong reserves of internal fortitude. Reshaping the cosmos \ndemands nothing less. Willpower represents the resilience that allows the \nmagician to overcome extreme hardship or continue to fight when all seems lost. \nWillpower determines a mage’s maximum number of Arete Traits, helps him \nresist extreme physical injury and lets him draw on deep reserves of strength \nwhen he is worn down. \nYour starting mage character has five permanent Willpower Traits.

These personal twists of magic show up as Resonance. Generally, \na magical spell resonates with its creator’s individual characteristics, and a mage with \na large amount of Resonance injects it ever more clearly into his Effects. \nPick one Dynamic, Entropic or Static Resonance Trait when you begin play. \nYou may gain additional Resonance Traits as the story unfolds. \nNEATWE TRAITS \nYour mage has some specific deficiency. Maybe she’s forgetful, or perhaps \nshe is just small and weak. Perhaps these problems are natural, or maybe they \nstem from some accident or injury. In any case, these difficulties become \nNegative Traits. You don’t have to take any Negative Traits, they help to flesh \nout specific hindrances that your character suffers. \nIn addition to giving you a means to describe a character’s minor problems and \npeccadilloes, Negative Traits provide extra opportunities to strengthen your char- \nacter elsewhere. EachNegative Trait that you take is g o d  for one Free Trait that you : \nmay spend later. You can take up to a total of five Negative Traits, although you \nC \nshouldn’t take more than three Negative Traits in the same Attribute category.

See Chapter Four for information about all of the Spheres. \nSTEP FIVE: SPARK GF LIFE \nAt the end of Step Four, your mage should have a list of Traits and \ncapabilities. However, a good character isn’t just a collection of numbers and \nadjectives. Now it’s time to deepen the character’s story. Look into her motives, \nher history, her Awakening and the other details of her experience that turned \nher into the person she is today. \nHistory - \nConsider the mage’s pre-Awakening days. Did she have any \nspecial hopes and dreams that were inspired or dashed by the change? Does her family \nknow of her powers, or does she even contact her family members any more? Where \ndid she live, how did she grow up, and what sort of jobs and education has she had? \nSecrets -Come on, everyone has a few. Does your mage harbor a secret \nshame or desire?Does she regret what she’s become, or does she embrace it a little \ntoo passionately? Has she learned something better left buried, or does she \n4 \ndespise some aspect of her Tradition secretly? \nMotivation- Although all mages feel a call to pursue enlightenment, not \nevery mage does so in the same way. For some, this pursuit takes the form of \nhumanitarian action. For others, it’s a continued drive for personal goals. What \nmakes your mage get up and go? Does she want to help other people Awaken, or \nwould she protect them from that fate? Does she really believe in her Tradition’s \ndogma? Maybe she just moves as her fate takes her. Whatever form it takes, \nmotivation is the push or pull that helps the character go places and do things. \nAppearance - \nHow does your mage look? Is she disheveled and unkempt, \nor is she a shining gorgeous beauty? Does she have any distinctive features or \n1 1  \nmannerisms? People remember the Hermetic who wears tweed or the Verbena with i!5m \nthedazzling tattoo andseductivewalk, sopickacouple offeatures that willstandout. \nFoci-Your \nmage’s foci are very important to her magical technique, even \nthough you use no Traits to represent them.

      "text": "uses. Checkout the list in Chapter Four for ideas. You can match up your foci with \nyour mage’s Abilities to get some hefty bonuses when casting spells. \nQuirks-Everyone has a few distinctive mannerisms. Your mage’s quirks can \nbe anything from giving your adversaries the finger right before you escape to keeping \npictures of cats on everything you own. A quirk can help distinguish you from an \nimposter, or you could try to copy someone else’s mannerisms should the need arise. \nARCH~PES \nAn Archetype describes a fundamental personality characteristic. The Arche- \ntypes provide specific examples of what motivates an individual. Naturally, most \nhumans are sums of multiple (sometimes conflicting) drives, but the Archetypes \nrepresent the strongest, most visible or important part of a personality. A character’s \nNature Archetype describes the individual’s inner drives and desires, while the \nDemeanor represents the face that the character presents to the world at large. \nBecause it represents her most important and dearly held impulses, a \ncharacter’s Nature provides insight into her plans and serves to reinforce her \nconviction. Should acharacter be affected by some sort ofmind-influencing power \nthat violates her Nature, you gain an automatic free retest to resist that power by \ncalling upon that Nature. Conversely, if someone guesses your character’s Nature \nand uses it in a challenge to convince your character to do something in line with \nthat Nature, then you must risk an additional Trait in that challenge. \nIn certain circumstances, a Storyteller may rule that you regain a Trait of \nWillpower if you perform some suitably arduous task in keeping with your \nNature. This reward can be difficult to track or adjudicate fairly, though, so it \ndoesn’t always apply. You won’t gain Willpower simply by spouting rhetoric or \nperforming little acts that pay lip service to your Nature. It’s only by rediscov- \nering your purpose through trials and exertions that you reaffirm your drive. \nExample: Ulfston, a mge with the Caregiver Nature, finds himself in a conflict \nwith a Master of Mind who’s trying to invade hs psyche. Convinced that a certain child \nI has a strong destiny that must be avoided, the Master tries to force Ulfston to slaughter \nf that child. They mke achalknge, and Ulfston’splayer loses. However, Ulfston’splayer \nI announces thutheisahzleCaregiverwho wouldnevercommitsuchanatro~ousact. The \ntworetest, and Ulfstonwins. Heis abk tofightofftheMaster’scom mands...for now. \nLater, once Ulfston has dealt with the threat, he takes the child to his friend \nAnneke for help. Anneke says that she just doesn’t have the resources to take care \nof a child right now, but she can give him some money if he can look after the child. \nShe makes a Social Challenge to convince Ulfston that this is the right thing to \ndo. Furthermore, she ups the stakes by using Ulfston’sNature against him (“I know \nthat you are a true Caregiver. You would never let this poor child down.”). \nUlfston’s player must now bid an additional Social Trait. They test, and Ulfston \nloses. He realizes that he can’t simply leave the child alone, so he takes the child \nwith him, bewildered as to how they’ll survive. He checks into a hotel for the \n6 moment and takes the child to get some food, then spends some time trying to \nfigure out how to help educate and protect the orphan. Due to his concern and care \n(which takes a great deal of time and effort), the Storyteller rules that Ulfston \nreinforces his Caregiver Nature, and regains a Trait of Willpower. \nArchitect - \nYou hope to leave a lasting legacy, a spark of inspiration or \nchange that passes down through the ages. \n6 \nas \n: \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "AVATAR \nESSENCES \nIn a flash of insight, a mage Awakens to a wider universe. In this moment, the \nAvatar stirs and becomes the connection between a mage and the Tapestry. A \nmage works magic through his Avatar, and the Avatar holds memories and drives \nfrom many former incarnations. It also connects the mage to Resonance from age- \nold spells and memories of legendary times past. A mage’s Avatar guides him with \nsubtle emotions, shocking visions or blatant spiritual manifestations. \nIt is widely believed that the Avatar guides the mage throughout his magical \ngrowth toward eventual Ascension. However, not all Avatars are equal. Some \nhave stronger drives, some have very individual motives, and some are satisfied \nonly if the mage overcomes deep personal difficulties or fulfills dangerous quests. \nUltimately the Avatar’s essential drive, determines how it interacts with the \nmage and to what ends it drives him. \nOf course, the Avatar -be \nit soul, spirit, guardian angel, subconscious \ndesire, whatever - \nrarely interacts directly with a mage. Only a rare few mages \nhave Avatars that make themselves known deliberately. For most mages, the \nAvatar appears in dreams and sudden intuitive hunches or emotions. \nIn game terms, the Avatar Essence describes the Avatar’s goals and methods. \nEach mage has one Avatar Essence, which in turn shows the Avatar’s specific \nrelation to the cosmos. Typically, this Essence becomes most clear during Seekings \n(see p. 122). When a mage undergoes a Seeking, a Quiet or some other highly \ncharged encounter with the Avatar, the Essence makes itself evident. \nAn Avatar’s Essence determines in part the requirements of a Seeking. \nAlthough a Seeking often forces a mage to confront unexplored or unsavory \nelements of his personality in order to achieve a more enlightened understanding of \nhimself, the requirements of his Avatar’s Essence always surface in a Seeking as well. \n’ \nThe four known Essences are: \nDYNAr€IIC ESSENCE \nYour Avatar strivesfor changeat all times. It delights inallmanner ofrandom, \nwhirling, creative exploration, be it increating new things, coming up withunique \nideas or just pushing you to experience things you’ve never done before. \nWhen you engage in a Seeking, your Avatar requires you to have done \nsomething totally new. If you haven’t had a new experience or learned some- \nthing completely new since your last Seeking (such as a new Ability, for \ninstance), then you will not be able to satisfy the impulses of this Essence. \nYour Avatar desires to reinforce existing structures or build up coherent \nmodels. You find yourself drawn to the beauty in order, and you are sometimes \ncompelled to defend or elaborate on known principles and beliefs. \nWhen you engage in a Seeking, you must somehow reinforce an existing \nstructure. You can do so in any number of ways, including helping to raise a \nbuilding, elaborating on a scientific theory or improving one of your own areas \nofknowledge (such as by gaining new levels in an Ability that you already have). \nYour Avatar springs from the original, primordial soup of Creation. Therefore, \nthis Essence revels in death, rebirth and the bubbling chaos of beginnings and endings. \nI ‘ \n: . ~lUlTICI3RDIAL‘kENCE \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

You might have to destroy an old bureaucracy, tear down \nan ancient tradition or rediscover some fundamental principle of existence \n(such as by remaking yourself through an improvement in your Attributes). \n@JESTING ESSENCE \nYour Avatar pushes you toward distant goals, and builds upon past experi- \nences to raise you to new heights. You find yourself pursuing accomplishment at \nall times and learning from old tasks. \nWhen you engage in a Seeking, you must have built on some previous \nexperience to accomplish something. You may have to redo an old task using \nknowledge that you’ve mastered, but you may have to perform it on some larger \nscale that requires a great depth of proficiency. (Gaining a specialization in an \nAbility is one way to represent such a goal.) \nATTRIBUTES \n[BIDDING TRAITS] \nRepresenting your character’s innate capabilities is the purview of Attributes. \nThese Traits are natural to the character, and although they can be improved with \npractice and exercise, they’re not trained or learned capabilities. They’re simply \na measure of raw performance. You call upon your Attributes to accomplish tasks \nand determine your inborn human gifts. The more Attribute Traits you have, the \nbetter you are in an area. With lots of Physical Traits, for instance, you’re very \nstrong and fast and tough, and you’re better able to perform physical feats. \nWhen you find yourself in a challenge situation during game play, you use \nAttributes as a means to resolve it. For instance, you might need to use your \nbrains to solve a complex ancient riddle posed by an adversary. You would use \na Mental Trait such as Clever to initiate the challenge, showing that your \ncharacter is using his wits to overcome his opponent. The type of Trait you use \ndepends on the type of challenge, of course. Being strong doesn’t help you solve \nriddles, but it would be useful in aclose-quarters fight. Having agood appearance \nand a magnetic personality is great for impressing new acquaintances, but it \nwon’t help you evade a kick in the crotch. \nThe specific nature of the challenge further limits what Traits within one \nAttribute category apply. When you want to break down a door, you use a \nBrawny Trait or other Strength-related Trait, not Quick or Dexterous. Similarly, \nyou would want to be Dignified or Elegant at a gala social event, not Intimldating \nor Ingratiating. However, you can use any Trait that you and the challengers \nmutually agree are appropriate. You should try to pick Traits that are descriptive \nof what you’re doing, though. \nWhen you enter a challenge with a Trait, you risk some of your capabilities. \nIf you lose the challenge, you’ll get tired or discouraged, you’ll use up some of your \ntricks, or you’ll just become too fatigued to care. As a result, you temporarily lose \nthat Trait that you bid. This lost Trait doesn’t retum until the next game session. \nSometimes you’ll enter a challenge “Traits up” or “Traits down.” If you are \nTraits down when enteringchallenges, then you must risk additional Traits just to \nmake a test (before taking Negative Traits into account), and you lose them all \nif you fail that challenge. Conversely, you could be Traits up or down on the \nresolution of a challenge. In this case, you count as having additional or fewer \nTraits when you compare Trait totals in the event of a tied test or an overbid. \n‘ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Ability Traits represent capabilities that a \ncharacter might learn or develop. They aren't necessarily innate to human \nnature, but rather they stem from study and practice study. With the right \nAbilities, a character can perform various sorts of difficult tasks, and he has a \nbetter chance of success even with mundane problems. \nIfyourcharacterfailsachallenge,you~useanAbili~foraretestand~ \ntosnatch \nvictory from the jaws of defeat. You use up the Ability Trait until the next game session \n(you exhaust part of your repertoire of tricks), and you still lose the initial Attribute \nTrait(s) you bid for the challenge, but you may be able to win the challenge itself. \nMultiple levels of Abilities reflect a character's growing competence. Few \npeople exceed three levels of any Ability. Such dedication and professional skill \ndoesn't come easily, and many people simply don't have the necessary talent and \ndedication. Even most mages can't exceed the limits of human knowledge, \nwhich peaks at five levels of Ability. The total level of Ability in a given field \ncorresponds roughly to the character's professional capabilities: \nCompetent (Able to earn a living) \nProfessional (Licensed, capable of supervision) \nJourneyman (Bachelor's degree or instructor) \nExpert (Master's degree or researcher) \nMaster (Doctorate or true innovator) \nBecause of the highly skilled nature of some fields, certain tasks may be \nimpossible without a given Ability. In such a case, a character without the \n' requisite Ability, or who has used up all of his levels of that Ability for the \nsession, cannot even attempt the feat. Usually, though, attempting a task based \non a prerequisite Ability does not use up an available Trait. Only using the \nAbility for a retest exhausts it. \nIf you use an Ability for a set problem or scenario (such as trying to hack a \ncomputer with the Computer Ability), the Storyteller sets the difficulty of the task \nin question. Such a task is usually a Static Challenge, and it often requires that you \n' bid a Trait or sometimes multiple Traits. You may or may not know the difficulty \nbeforehand, but such is the riskofdiving headlong into difficult or dangerous tasks. \nShould you use an Ability in a challenge against another player, the Ability \nmay have certain special characteristics, as described on the following pages.

With Academics, you can express artistic criticism, debate the \nclassics, consider philosophy and indulge in studies of culture. This broad \nAbility covers the humanities in learning. \nAcademics allows you to recognize historical, artistic and cultural refer- \nences. You can use Academics when working in such fields, when developing a \ncritique or when researching. Calling on the Academics Ability may require a \nMental or Social Challenge to determine your exact level of competence. \nYou should choose a focus in a specific field of Amhics, such as LiterahL.r, \nPhhsophy, Mu.skAppreciationor anything that could be studied with a higher education. \nAlertness \nYou pay attention to your surroundings. Even if your senses aren’t particu- \nlarly good, you know enough to put together clues and scrutinize things going \non around you. \nYou use Alertness in conjunction with your Perception-related Mental \nTraits to notice sounds, detect things that are out of place and spot concealed \nobjects or people. \nWhen you’re surprised (see p. 193), you may spend one level of Alertness to \nnegate the surprise penalty and act normally instead. \nAthletics \nWhether due to a background in sports or just personal talent, you are skilled in \nall manner of athletic endeavors. You can throw a ball, sprint, climb, jump and swim. \nYour Athletics Ability applies to retests on most forms of raw physical activity \nincluding: acrobatics, swimming, jumping, throwing, climbing and running. You \nmay choose to focus on one sport or activity. Use Athletics in conjunction with \nthrown or hand-propelled weapons like bows and hurled knives. \nAwareness \nYou have a talent for knowing when things are not as they should be, whether \nby that strange feeling in the pit of your gut or through tested observation. This \nAbility is particularly useful for sensing when other supernatural creatures are \nabout, detecting evidence of strange magical phenomena, or just getting that \nweird feeling when the laws of nature are about to take a hard left. \nAwareness challenges usually pit your Mental Traits against a Static \nChallenge determined by a Narrator. If someone performs a magical Effect with \nno visible result, you can call for an Awareness challenge with a difficulty of six \nTraits minus the Effect’s casting difficulty before modifiers (minimum zero for \na really big Effect). If you succeed, you know that something magical happened, \nalthough you don’t necessarily know what it was. Actually figuring out the \nproperties of something magical may require other Abilities such as Occult. \nBrawl \nBack alleys, martial arts schools and rough bars are your stomping grounds. \nYou might have military training, or maybe you just grew up with a passel of \nrough-and-tumble siblings. Whatever the case, you know how to dish out the \ndamage with your fists and your feet. \nUse the Brawl Ability for retests in combat when you are using your natural \nweapons (teeth and fists, or even magically grown claws and appendages).

With \nthe Do specialization, the Akashic Brother may choose to inflict lethal damage \nin unarmed combat, instead of scoring bashing damage (see p. 191). \nComputer \nWith the Computer Ability, you understand how to use, program and access \ncomputers of all sorts. Since computer technology facilitates Virtual Adept \ntechnomagic and serves all sorts of roles in the Technocracy, this Ability is very \nhandy for a cutting-edge modem magician to have. \nUse Computer with a Mental Challenge (difficulty determined by the \nStoryteller) to break into systems, alter data, write programs or figure out \nunfamiliar computer operations. \nCosmology \nThe Tellurian is vast and full of mysteries, but some of those mysteries are \nclear to you. Whether through hearsay or personal experience, you know of \nmany fantastic places and creatures throughout the cosmos. \nWhen you encounter a strange Realm, a mystical Node or an unknown spirit, \nyou use your Cosmology Ability to puzzle out its nature. Usually doing so calls for \na Mental Challenge with a difficulty determined by the Storyteller. By expending \na Cosmology Trait, you can determine the strength of a Node or how powerful a \nspirit is. Additional information relies on challenges and your ability to roleplay \nthrough the process of dealing with alien places and changeable entities. \nCrafts \nYou can build things. Depending on your area of expertise, you know how \nto manufacture items and make handy tools or decorations. You must choose a \nfocus for Crafts, specifying your preferred form of creation. Carpenny, Clock- \nworks, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking and the like are all possibilities. You can \nfashion works of art by studying Painting, Drawing or similar physical media. \nCrafts also covers more technical skills, such as Mechanics and Electronics. \nMaking or repairing an item with Crafts usually involves a Physical \nChallenge of your dexterity, with a difficulty set by the Storyteller based on the \ntype of job. Making a concealed spring-loaded trap is far more difficult than \nplaning a board, for instance. Making a work of art may require Mental Traits \ninstead, such as when you draw a precise map or devise an electrical design. \nDodge \nWhen trouble rears its ugly head, you know how to get out of its way. ; \nUnhesitating reactions let you evade blows and gunshots, getting aside just in \ntime to avoid injury. You can use Dodge against any attack that you're aware of. \n1 \nYou can dive for cover as someone fires a gun or twist away from a sword before ' \nit bisects your spine, for instance. You may use the Dodge Ability as a retest when ! \ndefending against an attack that you can see or sense coming. \nDrive \nAlthough most people can drive in the modern age, you can drive well. You \nare equally at home with a manual or automatic transmission, rush hour is no \nconcern, and you can eke the most performance out of your car.

Whether you're \nworking on the morning crossword or translating an ancient scrawl in a buried \ntomb, you have a penchant for coming up with unusual solutions, answering \nmystical conundrums and solving all manner of brain-twisters. \nYou use Enigmas most often with a Mental Challenge to help figure out a \npuzzle of some sort.

When the muse strikes, you put \n; pen to paper (or fingers to musical instrument) and pour out a torrent of emotion \nand stirring imagery. You can convey message and meaning in your art, from \nsymphonies to poetry, and whatever you write is both clear and moving. \nWhen writing or composing, you can sink Expression Traits into the work. \nDoing so typically denotes some level of quality. Professional poets, writers and \nmusicians often use three or more levels to make their best material. \nFirearms \nA little time at the gun range goes a long way. You know how to hold, fire \nand clean a gun. You can unjam one too, and you can tell different models apart. \nYou know how to stand to get the best aim, how to handle recoil and how to take \ncare of problems in the field. \nIf you possess the Firearms Ability, you use your Mental Traits for gun \ncombat instead of using Physical Traits. You can expend Firearms for a retest in \nranged-fire combat withpistols, rifles, shotguns, crossbows and similar weapons. \nHobby/Professional/Expert Ability \nIn a certain area of expertise not covered by another Ability, you have \nachieved some level of skill.

Although most mages still avail themselves of modem conveniences, \nquite a few Traditionalists travel the wilderness and subsist on its bounty. \nHunting and avoiding danger in the wilderness usually relies on a Physical \nChallenge. If you have the Survival Ability, you can substitute your Mental \nTraits for such a challenge if you so desire. \nTechnology \nYou know all about high-tech gadgetry, devices, machines and toys. \nWhether building, repairing or just figuring the infernal contraptions out, you \nhave a good sense of how such mechanisms work, be they televisions, microwave \novens or sprinkler systems. \nWith the Technology Ability, you can puzzle out most technical devices. \nYou understand all manner of electrical and mechanical engineering, material \nwork and even a little bit of hotwiring. You are equally able to program a DVD \nplayer or install an alarm. You can also use Technology to circumvent such \ndevices, which can be very handy in defeating Technocratic security. Use \nMental Traits for such challenges. \nBACKGRGXJNDS \nALLIES \nOld friends, magical heritages and the web of favors and social maneuvers fall \ninto the category of Backgrounds. These Traits describe your character’s place in \nmundane and magical society in terms of personal standing or mystical power. \nA few friends, either left over from your pre-Awakened days or made \nafterward, help you out in your endeavors. You can make a few calls and cut a \nfew deals to find assistance in a wide range of activities. Your Storyteller will \nprobably require you to define how you keep your allies and their relations to you. \nEach Allies Trait represents one person whom you can call upon for aid. \nUnlike Influence, your allies have special talents that make them better than the \naverage person on the street. Although your allies may not be aware of your \nmagical skills, they can be quite useful if you direct them properly. \nIn general, your allies do not show up in play directly. Instead, you use them \nfor certain services between play sessions by notifying your Storyteller: \nAn ally can follow up on research or activities that you have started. If you \nundertook a specific task previously, such as tailing someone, researching a \nproject or building a device, your allies can continue the work with one Ability \nTrait’s worth of expertise. As long as your allies work on the project, your Allies \nTraits for the individuals are tied up. \nIf you need a particularly competent ally, you can expend multiple Traits \nto gain access to a person with multiple levels of an Ability or Influence. Each AUies \nTrait that you spent after the first gives an extra level of expertise to your ally. The \nally may use this expertise on your behalf - \nalthough rarely with your skill - \nand \nhe will help only as long as you tie up your Allies Background Traits in this manner. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

An ally may call on you for mutual \naid or refuse to help you perform dangerous or illegal activities. \nARCANE \nSome mages are merely sneaky, but others have a preternatural ability to \navoid detection. A mage with the Arcane Background is one of the latter, gifted \nwith the capability of slipping through the cracks and skating through existence \nunidentified. Since many mages run afoul of all manner of enemies (the Technoc- \nracy, supernatural monsters, the IRS), this Background proves extremely useful. \nAny time you complete a scene (say, at the conclusion of a fight, after \nrunning from a location or having just finished a meeting) you may expend one \nof your Arcane Traits to cause everyone involved to forget and lose all record of \neither your name or your face. (You may spend two Arcane Traits to make them \nforget both.) You must do so immediately upon concluding the scene, for you \ncannot retroactively cause someone to forget you later. When you spend an \nArcane Trait thus, all of the appropriate records of your character just vanish \nfrom that scene. The camera that should have recorded you had a technical \nproblem, the interviewer just couldn’t remember your name and forgot to jot it \ndown, the computer crashed.. . whatever it takes. This Background has no game \neffect other than removing records of your character. You can’t, for instance, \ndecide how your Arcane will wipe out records and decide to use it in a fashion \nthat would hit other people’s records or some other important information. It \nworks only on you. Even subjects with benefits like Mind magic or a photo- \ngraphic memory lose track of your character’s personal information inexplicably. \nArcane may hide your identity, but it doesn’t cover your actions. Even if \nsomeone can’t remember who you are or what you look like, a victim will \ncertainly remember your spells, your attacks, your crazed behavior or the \ndangerous information that you passed along. \nYour Arcane works only at your behest. Your friends don’t suddenly forget \nyour name. Arcane Traits refresh each game session. \nI \nAVATAR \nEvery mage has a spirit, a soul, an inner voice, a guardian angel or some \notherwise mysterious force that ties him to the cosmos, and mages refer to this \nforce as the Avatar. Indeed, many mages theorize that every single human being \nhas an Avatar. However, the mage’s strength lies in the Awakening, which \ncauses his Avatar to stir and become a force for change on the Tellurian. The \npower of that Avatar impacts your mage’s ability to channel Quintessence, the i. \nmost primal force of energy in the cosmos. \nYour Avatar Background has two main important effects. \nFirstly, your mage can refresh Quintessence Traits equal to the Avatar rating \nautomatically by spending time at a Node. You need only win a Mental Challenge \nusing the Meditation Ability each game hour in order to refresh one Quintessence \nTrait until you reach an amount equal to the Aetata~ Trait total. However, you do , rCl, \nnot gain anything if you already have equal or more Quintessence Traits than . \nh ,  . \nsb \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

If you have one Avatar Trait, you can spend only one \nQuintessence Trait each turn. If you do not have the Avatar Background, you \ncannot spend personal Quintessence at all. However, you can still use Prime to \ntransfer it to other people or sources, or to use it from Tass. \nAt the Storyteller’s discretion, your mage’s Avatar rating may affect his \nSeekings.

Governments, guilds, orders and \nreligions all foster and promote themselves like living organisms. They grow and \nevolve just like the people who created them. When you have Influence, you can \nsway the direction of some areas of society, pushing communities to grow as you \ndirect. Your Influence can strike indirectly at your foes while protecting your \nown assets, or it can gain you information and special resources. \nInfluence comes in many different areas, so you must allocate Traits \nseparately to each Influence. Therefore, if you haveLegalx4, you could still have \nPolice x3 independently, but you would have to spend the Traits for each. \nYou cannot manage more Influence than the sum of your permanent \nPhysical, Social and Mental Traits combined. This limit counts against all of \nyour total Influence, so your combined levels cannot exceed this total. After all, \nthere are only so many things you can do in a day. \nWhen you exercise Influence, you expend temporary Influence Traits.

You must use three Traits to perform an action listed at the third level \nof an Influence chart, for instance.

The \nmagic lies in bringing imagination to life. A mage has the power to turn his fancies \ninto reality. Through will and belief, the mage shapes the very stuff of Creation \ninto a new form. In theory, with enough study and training, anything is possible. \nA mage’s ability to shape the world bows only to his understanding of the cosmos. \nOf course, were mages truly without limits, the world would be far different. \nA mage must study, work and learn the ways of magic. This painstaking process \nlasts a lifetime. Few mages truly master their talents, and nobody knows the real \nlimits of magic. Pursuing Ascension - \nbecoming something more than human, \ndeveloping an innate and intrinsic connection to the universe - \nis the final \ngoal. For most mages, though, the fact remains that practical magic lies in the \nexecution of little mystical tricks or creations. The more experienced the mage \nis, the broader andmore potent these skills become. With time and effort, amage \ncan also create lasting spells or build special talismans and magical devices. \nUltimately, magic opens the door to opportunity, but the occasions it affords are \nonly as broad as the creativity and dedication of the magician. \nBecause magic can be limitless, it’s difficult to describe and work effectively. \nHow do vou handle something that’s sublime and infinite in scoDe? For this reason, \nv \nmost mages agree upon the categorization of the following nine Spheres: Ccrrrespon- \nh e ,  Enmopy, Forces, Life, Matter, Mind, Prime, Spirit and Time. Each Sphere \ndescribes a specific piece of magical reality. With expertise in a Sphere, a mage can \neffect changes over that aspect of the Tellurian. Of course, the Spheres simply work \nas one model for magic. They provide a means for mages to have a common basis for \ntalking about their spells, or to give Apprentices a handle on what they’re doing. Two \nmages of widely different Traditions use such disparate techniques that describing \ntheir magical practices could prove nearly impossible. With the Spheres, however, \na mage can give his ally a general idea of what he’s doing, whether he’s manipulating \nForces, recasting Time, \nshaping I’rime energy or whatever. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "THE \nP~WERW AWARENED \n~\nG\nI\nC\n \nUltimately, an Awakened mage warps or rewrites reality with her powers. \nThe Spheres are simply a measure of the practical knowledge necessary to do so. \nIt’s the force of enlightenment, channeled through the mage’s belief in the \nefficacy of certain practices and items, that bends the world to the mage’s will. \nOf course, reality already has its own pattern. The world got along fine before \nthe mage ever Awakened, and it will probably continue to do so. The basic, \nunderlying level of reality that most people see is called static reality. The everyday \nperson on the street lives and breathes in static reality. Whatever most people \nbelieve is real has agreat effect on the shape of the world itself. Belief isn’t necessarily \neverything (some elements of the cosmos certainly predate humanity), but it does \nexert significant change over the Tellurian. This underlying reality is considered the \ncommon experience for most people, or the consensus. When a mage works \nAwakened magic, she reshapes the Tellurian, most often against the consensus. \nMages don’t really agree on the source of Awakened magic’s power. Is the \nAvatar really an angel, a friendly spirit or the mage’s soul? Nobody knows for \ncertain. All that mages known is that when someone Awakens and has the eye- \nopening experience that says, “I can change the world,” the person becomes \ncapable of exerting his will to change reality. That’s Awakened magic. \nOf course, even the un-Awakened have some capacity for magic. Patterns \nthat have existed so long in reality that they’re part and parcel of the world contain \ntheir own power, and sorcerers practice and use these Patterns. So magic remains \na mysterious force. Certainly the Awakened have more flexibility, but theirs isn’t \nthe only magic, nor is it necessarily a superior one. It’s simply a magic that comes \nfrom within, from will, enlightenment and belief in tools and trappings of magic, \nrather than from the power inherent to those tools or trappings themselves. \nVULGAR mGIc \nWhen a mage calls upon his greatest powers and invokes a display of stunning \nmystical forces, the act violates the consensus - \nit flies in the face of what people \nbelieve to be possible. The static reality, or mundane world, follows laws and rules \nthat say that such things aren’t possible. Through his enlightened will, the mage \n-I \nsays “By my will, this is possible,” and he makes it so. The mage literally bends or \nreweaves the Tapestry to his desires. He does not do so without cost, however. \nWhen a mage performs some feat that breaks the expectations of normalcy, he \ncommits a vulgar display of magic. People don’t just hurl lighming, fly through the air or \nshrug off bullets -reality doesn’t work that way. So say the laws of the world, and so it \nis difficult for mages to gainsay these rules. Vulgar magic is dficult and often uncontrol- . \nlable. Many vulgar workings go awry, and the world snaps back at the mage through the \nforce of Paradox. When the mage does something that’s clearly impossible, he creates a ; \nParadox, and the titanic forces he unleashes are often beyond human control. \nVulgar magic is also called vain or dynamic magic, because it’s a mighty \nchange to the world and a small example of the mage’s hubris in reshaping \nCreation. Mages who rely on vulgar magic often find themselves shunned by other \nmages who consider them dangerous, and they succumb to the forces of Paradox. \nCCBINCIENTAL \n~€IAGIC \nI \nOfcourse, many of the charms and spells used by mages don’t have to violate the , rrig . \nsanctity of the consensus.

The mage may not control \nit directly, but he nudges a few Patterns here and there to gain a desirable result. \nNote that, when casting coincidental magic in play, it’s customary for you (the \nplayer) to describe the nature of the coincidence, but your mage may not realize it. \nFor instance, your mage could cast an Effect designed to help heal a wound.

Their every working is testament to that fact. \nOf course, more than a few mages wonder at magic’s real limits. Can a mage \ntruly remove all gravity from the world, allowing everyone to fly? Could a mage \npluck the sun and moon from the sky and drink from the stars? Is it possible to \nrework Heaven, to brave Hell and to remake the face of Creation itself?Or, more \n.rl \nplausibly, how about just conjuring a buck and a quarter for lunch? \nWhile the Spheres of magic do describe and allow for great feats, even mages \nhave their limits.

In game \nterms, you use your ratings in the various Spheres to determine what your mage \ncan and can’t do. This capacity is bounded further by your mage’s practical \napplications of those Spheres and by the beliefs that your mage holds.

A long- \nstudying Hermetic Master is far beyond the capabilities of a newly Awakened \nApprentice. Of course, individual mages rarely categorize magic so simply, but \na general scale of competence exists. In game terms, this scale follows the levels \nof power for the Spheres. Therefore, you chart your mastery of each Sphere as: \nApprentice- A mage who’s just started studying the rudiments of the Sphere. \nInieiate-Onewhohasbeeninitiatedintothetruemrjteriesandleamedthebasics. \nDisciple - \nA mage with a broad, general competence in a given Sphere. \nAdept-Onewho’suncoveredsignificant secretsandpracticedwiththeSphere. \nMaster - \nA mage who has command over both fundamental and complex \naspects of the Sphere and who has a great level of skill and experience. \nFor crossover purposes, the Apprentice and Initiate levels are Basic powers, \nthe Disciple and Adept levels are Intermediate powers, and the Master level is \nan Advanced power.

Also, special rules \nregarding the format and uses of the Spheres are covered immediately hereafter. \nMagecharacters start with six levels OfApprentice or Initiate Spheres. With time \nand experience, they may learn more, but doing so is a difhcult process. Typically, a \ncharacter takes two sessions per Sphere level to learn a new set of powers successfully. \nTherefore, learning the Initiate level of Forces would take four game sessions from the \ntime that the player spent the Experience Traits. This time is halved for a specialty \nSphere to only one session per level. (Note, however, that if you’re in a large \norganization with many games, this rate is based on your home game. No fair going to \na bunch of other games during the week and claiming that you’ve fulfilled your session \ntime. The progression is based on the game sessions of your local, usual game.) \nHaving the Mentor or Library Background can greatly facilitate learning \nnew Spheres (see p. 114). \nLEARNING \nSPHERES \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

However, they often \nrequire a subsequent challenge to hit or best the target. \nIf a Sphere uses a hurled Effect, like a lightning bolt, you must best the \nsubject in a challenge of your Mental Traits against the victim’s Physical Traits. \nIf the Sphere uses a touch Effect, like an enchantment on a sword or your hand, \nyou must win a Physical Challenge against the victim.

If a spell is instant, it \ntakes effect and is done, although the results may linger. For instance, a bolt of \nfire is instant, so it just flashes into existence and strikes, but it may leave \nI something burning naturally. If a spell has a duration of one turn, it lasts until \nthe end of your next turn. Therefore, you can cast an augmenting Effect, then \nuse it with your next action in the next turn. If a spell has a duration of one \nminute or conflict, then it lasts either for aminute (if you’re not in combat time) \nor for the series of tests necessary to complete one conflict.

      "text": "GRADES \nSUCCESS \nMost rotes have a listing for grades of success. If you cast a lengthy ritual or \nyou use Willpower, you can boost a spell’s power so that it has a greater effect. \nThe exact effects are listed in the “Grades of Success:’’ section for each rote. \nSTACKING \nUnless otherwise noted, you can’t stack multiple instances of the same Effect. \nFor instance, ifyou hit someone with the Entropy Effect Blight of Aging, the subject \nsuffers aNegative Physical Trait. You can’t use the Effect again to cause another such \nTrait at the same time. If a subject is under multiple instances of the same Effect, only \nthe most powerful one works. If the duration on one instance of the Effect runs out, \nthe next longest duration kicks in. Therefore, if someone is under the Blight of \nAging Effect to have two Negative Physical Traits for a conflict, and another Blight \nof Aging Effect to have one Negative Physical Trait for a scene, then the victim \nsuffers two Negative Physical Traits for the first conflict and then one Negative \nPhysical Trait for the remainder of the hour. He does not suffer the one-Trait penalty \nfor an additional hour after the first conflict. The duration times overlap, and only \nthe most powerful Effect affects the target at a time. \nWhen unweaving an Effect, you may choose which instance of an Effect to \nunweave. Therefore, you can unweave a longer-running Effect, a more-powerful \nEffect, or any one that you choose. \nCCBRRESPCBNNNCE \nManipulation of space and distance is the purview of Correspondence. With \nthis Sphere, the mage can sense, stretch or distort space, teleport from place to \nplace or extend the range of his other senses or magics. This Sphere also covers \nmystical connections, so Correspondence helps create sympathetic magics, like \nbreaking or strengthening the ties between an object and a person. \nTheorists espouse the idea of the Correspondence Point and argue that all \nof space is an illusion. They argue that all things exist simultaneously in the \nTapestry. Through the Correspondence Point theory, they defy distance and \neven step outside of space itself. \nNormally, a mage can send Effects only to the distance of his normal senses. \nIf you allow conjunctional Effects, though, then the mage can work Effects at the \ndistance of his Correspondence scrying. However, no other Sphere added to such \nan Effect can exceed the level of the Correspondence power. \nYou must use Correspondence on whole Patterns.

Should the subject choose to break the oath, \nhe suffers the full weight of misfortune immediately. Anyone capable of sensing \nEntropy (with Locate Disorder and Weakness) can tell immediately that the \nindividual is an oathebreaker, and the subject immediately loses all temporary \nWillpower Traits.

Every \nuniversal power and energy is the bailiwick of this Sphere. Through Forces, a \nmage manipulates fire, light, electricity, sound and their opposites cold, dark- \nness, stillness and silence. Every force is essentially a Pattern of Quintessence in \nmotion. With this magic, the mage senses and manipulates those Patterns. \nDifferent forces have different Effects. If you hit someone with electricity, \nthe damage is bashing, but it penetrates most armor. You will usually incapaci- \ntate a foe before killing. Kinetic damage can be bashing or lethal at your choice, \ndepending on whether you spread it over an area or strike in a point or edge. \nExtreme cold inflicts lethal damage. Fire damage is aggravated. Silence or \ndarkness “damage” causes the subject to lose the sense in question for the \nduration of the Effect. The Forces Sphere tends to inflict a lot of damage \ncompared to other Spheres, and it has other special combat Effects as well (such \nas setting things on fire or crushing them). \nAPPWNTICE \n(BASIC) FCBRCES: \nPERCEIVE FCBRCES \nYoucansenselocalPattemsofforce.Kineticenergy,radiowaves, \nheat sourcesandthe \nlike are all clearly visible to you.

An Artifact is an item \nthat has the ability to invoke certain magical Effects, or that has been permanently \nmagically enchanted. The mage must reweave the Pattern of the item in question, \ninvesting it with strong Prime energy to reinforce the desired magical works. The \ncreation of such a device, although theoretically possible at this level of power, is \nultimately up to the discretion of the Storyteller. Such a creation can’t be done in \na single turn. It’s a heroic working to be accomplished over several stories, often \nwith associated knowledge of other Spheres required to place the enchantments \non the item. You can also make a Soulgem, which is a Periapt (an item that stores \nQuintessence as a battery) that can be used only by you.

It simply strikes - \noften in some form of fatigue or injury as the mage’s spell goes awry - \nwhen a \nmage tries to rewrite the Tapestry.

      "text": "A mage typically manifests one hobgoblin for each Trait of Paradox that \nwent into the Quiet above six. With seven Paradox Traits blown into a Quiet, \nthe mage suffers one Hobgoblin. With eight Traits, he suffers two, and so on. \nHobgoblins should be moderated by an Avatar Guide or Paradox Judge so that \nthey reflect the mage’s inner turmoil and magical difficulties. \nHobgoblins may take the forms of people, creatures or items. Most often, they \nhave a form appropriate to the Quiet in question. For an episode of Madness, they \ncould literally be little goblins or nonsensical furniture. With Clarity, they manifest \nas machine-voices or freakish technological aberrations. With Jhor, hobgoblins \ncould be small demons, imps or perhaps weapons or implements of torture. \nA hobgoblin is very real, and it doesn’t suffer from Paradox or Unbelief. Rather, \nit’s spawned from the mage’s own magical powers. Unless a hobgoblin is patently \nparanormal, it resembles a normal thing in all ways. No simple means exists with \nwhich to tell a hobgoblin from reality, and a mage already suffering from hallucina- \ntions has avery tough time of it. Hobgoblins tend to stick around and haunt the mage \nfor an entire game session, although they can be killed or broken before then. \nAlthough no simple Traits exist for a hobgoblin, run with a few simple animals \nor items. You don’t need to get wild, and hobgoblins don’t often manifest as HUGE \nKILLER BEASTIES! More likely, a hobgoblin will run around and vex the mage or \ncause social problems, and perhaps play to some of the mage’s personal fears. \nIf a mage manages to snap out of his Quiet, hobgoblins or their remnants \nvanish like melting snow. \nIn very severe Quiets, a mage’s consciousness retreats into the shell of his \nmind to battle with Paradox and the Avatar. The mage runs through a gauntlet \nofsymbolism andsurreality in an attempt to come to grips with his state, best his \nResonance and escape to sanity once more. \nWhile in a mindscape, a mage is catatonic. With Disciple level Mind magic, \nothers can enter the mindscape to help or hinder the trapped mage. By spending \na Willpower Trait and winning or tying a Simple Test, the mage can communicate \none spoken sentence into the physical world. Otherwise, the mage is on his own. \nCraft a mindscape like you would a Seeking. Grab some Narrators and the \nAvatar Guide, then throw a few trials or puzzles at the mage. The character must \npuzzle through the bizarre scenery to reach the waking world once more. Indeed, \nthe mage might not even realize immediately that he’s in a mindscape. \nIf a mage or visitor is knocked unconscious or killed in a mindscape, the \nhapless victim lapses into a coma and awakens only at the Storyteller’s discretion. \nFortunately, when a mage fights through a mindscape, he discharges all of \nhis accumulated Paradox Traits in the process. \nAlthough a mage creates magic through will, it’s the belief in a focus that \nshapes such magic. The mage lets a focus determine her spell and give it shape. In \nturn, she believes that the focus channels her will to empower the magic. \nAlthough a focus isn’t really necessary to work magic, most mages only understand \ntheir magics in terms of the foci that they use - \nat least until they master their \nmagic and become enlightened enough to recognize the power of will over reality. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Doing \nso takes the form of chanting, brandishing an object of power, mixing a \nsubstance and applying it, manipulating energy through song and dance or \nwhatever else the mage believes is necessary to work magic. In game terms, you’ll \nuse various trappings and Abilities to work your spells. \nEach Tradition description lists various foci that are appropriate. A mage uses \nthese foci to direct magic. For instance, a Hermetic mage may chant in Enochian, \ninscribeacomplexgeometricformorcalluponangelicinterventioninordertoconjure \nflames.AVerbenacou1ddothesamewithapaean \ntoancient gods, anofferingofblood \nto the elements or howling a song that sparks fiery energies. A Virtual Adept might use \na computer to manipulate local electrical fields or generate a laser for the same effect. \nYou can use any focus from your Tradition to shape an Effect. You need to \nnarrate the use of that focus, explaining what you’re doing and how it causes the \nmagic to happen. You’ll probably want to brush up on a little theory just to make it \nconvincing. Read some books on computer science if you’re playing aVirtual Adept, \ncheckout some philosophy and religion for Celestialchoristers andso on. Ofcourse, \nyou should never actually act out a dangerous behavior or brandish something like \na weapon. Merely describe what you are doing in such a case. However, if you can \nroleplay the use of a focus (by actually singing, for instance, or making complex \ngestures with an item card), then you should do so as long as you won’t draw negative \nattention from people who aren’t playing. (No sense convincing onlookers that \nyou’re engaged in some sort of realeworld occult conspiracy.) \nNotealsothatusingafocus isn’tjustaroleplayingtoolorahindrance.

See “Abilities Enhancing Magic,” on p. 135. \nUNICBUE \nAND SPECIALTY \nFKI \nYou have a specialty focus for each Sphere, a focus with which you’re \nparticularly good. If you can find a way to work that focus into the magic, then \nyou get a one-Trait bonus on your Arete Trait total for the resolution of such \nchallenges. For instance, if your Hermetic mage uses Enochian chants to \nsummon Forces magic, then you get a one-Trait bonus any time you chant when \ncasting a Forces spell. You could still inscribe a sigil with your staff (say, if you \nwere rendered mute), but you wouldn’t get the bonus, simply because your mage \nisn’t as good with that combination of Sphere and focus. \nInsomecases, you’llhaveaunique focus. Youcan decide, for instance, that youdon’t \njustperform your AkashicSp~tmagicwithyoursword, butspecificallywiththeChlnese \nbroadsword you inherited from your grandfather.

      "text": "Rules are an integral part of any game. They define what characters can and \ncannot do. Yet rules are necessary only to govern the outcome of aconfrontation \nwhen one does occur. Still, the primary focus of this game is to tell a good story, \nand the rules facilitate that focus. Rules just give you a framework to make sure \nthat everyone is treated fairly. They're not ironclad dogma, they're just ideas to \nhelp you run a smoother, more entertaining game. \nCHALLENGES \nFrom time to time, two or more players will engage in a conflict that cannot \nbe resolved through roleplaying alone. This sort of face-off is called a challenge, \nand it requires a simple system of conflict resolution. The system detailed in this \nchapter allows for the resolution of such conflicts efficiently and quickly. Inmost \ncases, a Narrator does not even need to be present when a challenge is played. \nRoleplaying does not necessarily have to end when a challenge begins. In fact, \nroleplaying becomes more important than ever if players intend to enjoy a \nconfrontation and avoid out-of-game disputes. Experienced players can integrate \na challenge into their roleplaying so seamlessly that outsiders don't even know that \nanything unusual is going on. At the players' option, they can use special hand \nsignals to indicate when certain Traits and powers are being employed. \nIn order for this system to work, players need to work together. They have \nto educate each other on the rules and agree on what Traits can be used in a \nchallenge. Compromise and cooperation are the bywords of this game. Argu- \nments over whether or not a particular Trait is appropriate to bid wreck both the \nmomentum and the mood of the game. \nUSING TRAITS \nBefore you can begin to learn how challenges work, you must first under- \nstand what defines a character's capabilities.

      "text": "These adjectives are called Traits, and they are described fully in Chapter Three. \nPlayers use these Traits to declare challenges against other characters or against \nstatic forces represented by a Narrator. \nINITIAL BID \nA challenge begins with a player bidding one of her Traits against her \nopponent. At the same time, she must declare what the conditions of the \nchallenge are, such as firing a gun, attacking with a knife or diving for cover. The \nother player must then decide how her character will respond. She can either \nrelent immediately or bid one of her own Traits in defense. \nWhen players bid Traits against one another, they may use only those Traits \nthat could sensibly be applied to that situation. Essentially, a player should \nusually use only those Traits from the same category her opponent’s used. Most \nchallenges are categorized as Physical Challenges, Social Challenges or Mental \nChallenges, as per the Attribute categories, and all Traits used in a challenge \nmust come from the same category. Experienced players may offer each other \nmore creative leeway, but only by mutual agreement. \nIf the defender relents, she loses the challenge automatically. For example, \nif she were being attacked, she would suffer a wound. If she bids a Trait in defense, \nthe two players perform a test. Those Traits the players bid are put at risk, as the \nloser of the test loses not only the challenge but the Trait she bid as well. \nTESTING \nOnce both parties involved in a challenge have bid a Trait, they engage in \na test immediately. The test itself is not what you may think - \nthe outcome is \nrandom, but the players use no cards or dice. The two players face off against one \nanother by playing Rock-Paper-Scissors. The test works like the moment in \npoker when you turn over your cards and declare a winner. The test produces one \nof two possible outcomes - \neither one player is the victor, or the result is a tie. \nIf you lose the test, you lose the Trait you bid for the duration of the game \nsession. Essentially, you have become tired or lost some confidence in the \ncapability the Trait represented, and you can’t call on it effectively until you \nregain some confidence and energy. \nIn the case of a tie, the players must then reveal the number of Traits that they \ncurrently have available in the Attribute category from which they bid the challenge \nTrait. The player with the least number of Traits loses the test and loses the challenge. \nNote that the number of Traits you’ve lost in previous challenges, or lost for any other \nreason,reducesthemaximumnumberofTraitsyoucanclaimin ties.Youmay lie about \nthe number of Traits you possess, but only by declaring fewer Traits than you actually \nhave. Bluffing in this way allows you to keep the actual number of Traits you possess \na secret, but doing so may be risky. The challenger is always the first to declare his \nnumber of Traits. If both players declare the same number of Traits, then the challenge \nis a draw, and the defender wins. However, both players lose the Traits they bid. \nExample of Play: Jaedo and his cabal mate Jeremy are locked in a battle of wits, \nand it’slaedo’s turn to try to stumpJeremy with a riddle. Jaedo begins by declaring his \nTrait (“I am quite Observant, and I draw this riddle from the smallest hints of the \nnatural world.”).

If Leigh did indeed possess that Negative Trait, she would have to nsk an \nadditional Social Trait to continue the challenge. However, luck isn’t on Blink’s side, \nand Leigh doesn’t have that Negative Trait.

You can even raise them to \nthe point where your opponent relents rather than risking additional Traits. \n@VE:RBIDDING \nOverbidding is the system by which powerful characters may prevail in a \nchallenge, even if they lose the initial test. Justin the Master with 12 Mental \nTraits should be able to crush Sam the Initiate who has only three. This system \nis designed to make that possible. \nOnce a test has been made, the loser has the option of calling for an overbid. \nIn order to call an overbid, you must risk a new Trait, though, since the original one \nhas already been lost. At this point, the two players must reveal the number of \napplicableTraitsthey possess in the appropriate Attribute category, starting with the \nplayer who called for the overbid. If that player has double the number of Traits as \nhis opponent in that category, he may attempt another test. (The person who won \nthe original challenge and is now being overbid against does not have to risk another \nTrait.) As in a tie, either player may state a number of Traits less than the actual \nnumber he has in order to keep his true power secret. Overbidding can be dangerous, \nthough, unless you are confident in your estimation of your opponent’s abilities. \nExample of Play: Stefan DeChase is trying to fast-talk Randal, a reluctant aly , \ninto following the course of action he’s suggesting. The unlikely Chorister begins with a \nclassic rapid-fire barrage (“My words are so fast and Beguiling you have no choice but \nletmego.”). However, Randalisn’tbuyingintoit (‘TmtooDignified toletafewquick \nphrasessway me like that”). They test, andstefanloses. However, reckoning he hasmore \nsocial aptitude than his scholarly fiend, Stefan declares an overbid (“I’m so Witty, you ; \ndon’tknow whathit you!”). He thenannouncesal IOofhisSocialTraits. Randaladmits c \nthat he has only four, so they test again. Stefan wins this time, and he wins the overall \nchallenge, even though he still loses the original Trait he bid. Now a slightly befuddled \nRandall is beginning to see the wisdom of following his fiend’s words after all. \nI \nSTATIC \nCHALLENGES \nSometimes, you have to undergo challenges against a Narrator rather than \nagainst another player.

Before the test, the Narrator decides \non the difficulty of the task that you are attempting. This number determines \nhow many Traits you are bidding against in the event of a tie. The test proceeds \nexactly as it would if you were testing against another character. Of course, you \nmay attempt to overbid in a Static Challenge, but beware, because the Narrator \ncan overbid as well. The number of Traits attached to the challenge should \nrepresent the difficulty and danger inherent in the challenge. \nSometimes Narrators may leave notes on objects, such as books, doors or \nmagical items that indicate the type of challenges that must be won to achieve \naspecificeffect with that object (suchasdecipheringa tome or hot-wiringacar). \nSimple Tests determine whether you can do something successfully when you \nface no real opposition.

In some \ncases, though, it may be necessary for the player to win in order to receive any \nbenefit from the challenge. \nS I ~ P L E  \nTESTS \nRETESTS \nCertain Traits allow a character toretest a challenge he has failed. A retest allows \na character to ignore the results of the first test and test again for a new result. Players \nusually gain retests through Abilities, but other Traits may also provide them as well. \nGenerally, expending one level of an appropriate Ability allows for one retest. \nMultiple retests are possible on a single challenge, but each retest must \ncome from a different source. A character who is trying to hit someone with a \nsword may retest his Physical Challenge once using a level of Melee. However, \nhe may not gain multiple retests with the Melee Ability on the same challenge, \neven if he has multiple levels on the Ability. \nA character who is capable of matching the conditions of the retest may \ncancel an opponent’s retest. If a player uses Brawl to retest a failed Physical \nChallenge to punch his foe, his foe may expend a level of Dodge to block the \nretest and force the attacker to accept the results of the original test. \nExample of Play: Jean Gris is attempting to subdue Brother Grizzly, a \nDreamspeaker ally who is possessed by a terrifying spirit. Jean first tries to gain some \ntime (“I knock your legs out from under you with a Dexterous sweep”).

Group challenges can seem intimidating even to experiencedNarrators and \nStorytellers. These rules are designed to streamline the resolution process, rather \nthan letting the situation devolve into endless matches of Rock-Paper-Scissors. \nFirst of all, find out who is challenging whom. The easiest way to do so is \nto count to three and have everyone point to the person they wish to target that \nturn. If no one is being challenged by more than one person, then let the \nchallenges proceed normally. \nIf several characters challenge one target, or one character tries to challenge \nmultiple opponents at once, resolve it in the following manner. First deal with \ngroups in the order of largest to smallest, just for ease of play. Each attacker must \nbid an appropriate Trait as normal for the challenge. Logistics put a limit of up \nto five characters attacking another character at once. \nNext, the lone character must bid enough Traits to counter every opponent \nin the group. If he does not have enough Traits, he must relent to those \nopponents whose bids he cannot meet. (He may choose which opponents he \nrelents to, though.) Resolve those relented challenges first, because the defender \nmay succumb before the rest of the group can act. \nAfter the bidding and relenting phase, the defender and his attackers engage in \none simultaneous test. The defender compares his sign to each of the attacker’s signs \nand applies the appropriate results. If the defending character throws Scissors and his \nfour attackers throw Rock, Scissors, Paper and Paper, the defender loses to the first \nchallenger, ties with the second (which he will resolve like any other tie) and beats the \nlast two. The defenders and attackers lose any Traits they have bid in a lost test. If the \ndefender in the previous example had bid one Trait against every attacker, he would \nhave lostoneTrait tothefirst attacker, andanadditionalTraitifhelostthe tieaswell. \nOnce the tests have been made, you resolve them in the standard order of \nactions and initiative. However, unless the defender has a special power that \nallows him to take multiple actions, he may attempt to injure only one of his \nattackers, and it must be one who lost a challenge against him. If none of the \nattackers lose, the defender simply suffers the results of their actions. It is possible \nfor a defender to lose Traits to the first attackers and then lose a tie to an attacker \nlater in the same mob challenge because of those Traits he lost. \nWhen the defender in a mob challenge uses Abilities or other powers to gain \nretests, treat each attacker’s challenge as a separate test. Therefore, a defender \nwould need to spend five Melee Traits in order to retest against five attackers in \none melee combat challenge. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

For the most part, every action plays out in real time, and players are \nexpected to stay in character unless they have a rules question. \nA player should never drop character when interacting with other players. \nDoing so ruins the atmosphere for everyone involved. Players may talk through \nchallenges, but a character is always considered to be active in the game. If a \nplayer needs to take a break, he should inform a Narrator. That player should not \ninteract with any of the other players while he is out of character. \nThe only other exception to this in&aracter rule is when a Narrator calls for a \ntimeout. This call may be necessary to resolve a dispute or change the scene if the story \ncalls for it. When a Narrator calls “Timeout!”, all players within hearing distance must \nstop whatever they are doing until the Narrator calls out, “Resume’1 or “Game on!” \nTimeoutsshouldbekepttoaminimum,though,sincetheyintermpttheflowofthestory. \nMind’s Eye Theatre time breaks down into five major allotments: chronicles, \nstories, sessions, scenes and turns. A chronicle is a series of smaller stories that are \nall connected somehow, and which may take months or even years to complete. \nEach complete plot line within the chronicle is called a story. A session is one \nactual night ofplay, although Storytellers may define a session as one night of game \ntime if the action ends in media res at the end of the previous game. (Since many \ncharacters regain spent Traits between sessions, this distinction can be impor- \ntant.) Finally, a scene is the time it takes to resolve the action in one location. \nOnce the characters shift locations, the scene has ended. If a session will be taking \nplace entirely at one location, a scene can then be defined as roughly one hour. \nIn many cases, a scene breaks down into a series of smaller actions that all \nhappen in a given location within a short span of time. If you’re fighting several \ngroups of Nephandic minions in the local abandoned lot at midnight, that’s all one \nscene. However, you’re taking up a little time as you defeat each group and charge \nthe next. There is not time enough to represent a change of scene, even though the \naction usually takes several turns. Just fighting a single minion can take adozen turns \nin itself. One series of challenges against a single opposing force comprises a conflict. \nIn roleplaying time, a conflict equals roughly a minute. Therefore, if you \nspend several challenges besting a foe, hacking a computer system or crawling \nthrough an air duct, that’s one conflict. The conflict really exists as an arbitrary \ntime measure for some powers. If a power lasts for a conflict, it remains in effect \nfor the series of contiguous challenges against an opposing group or obstacle, and \nit ends as soon as the challenges end. \n(Note that you can’t just wait in reserve during an ongoing conflict as your fnend \ngets beaten down, only to jump in one turn later, claiming that it’s a new conflict and \n$1 \nthat the enemy’s powers have all expired. The opponent hasn’t moved, and your arrival \nhas put only a small pause in the action. You’re still engaged in the same conflict.) \nCHRCBNICLES, \nSTBRIES, \nSESSIBNS \nAND SCENES \nI * \nCCBNf LICTS \nTURNS \nTurns are the discrete blocks of time, that make up conflicts and scenes.

The player of a character who is on fire must winor tie aSimple \nTest and spend one action dousing the flames. This test reflects the “Stop-Drop- \nRoll” method of extinguishing flames. Other actions are possible, of course, \nsubject to the player’s cleverness and/ or use of the appropriate Spheres. \nEssentially, combat involves two characters engaging in physical conflict. The \nplayers agree what the outcome of the challenge will be, each player bids an appropriate \nTrait, and they perform a test to determine the victor. The following section allows for \nvariations on those basic rules, such as situations using surprise or weapons. \nThe agreed-upon outcome of a Physical Challenge is often that the loser \ngets injured, but this result is not the only possible one. The two partiescan agree \nto nearly anything, whether it’s wrestling an opponent to the ground or tossing \nhim into traffic. The results of a combat challenge may also be different for both \nparticipants. For example, if a mage is battling a possessed friend, the wizard \nmight simply try to subdue him instead of hurting him, while the attacker might \nseek to do some serious bodily harm. \nSURPRISE \nIf a player does not respond within three seconds of the declaration of a \nPhysical Challenge, the character is considered to have been surprised. Sometimes \na player is busy with another activity or is playing a character who just isn’t \nprepared for the attack. However, any player who sneaks around whispering \nchallenges to get the element of surprise is cheating, plain and simple. A \nStoryteller canalso declare asufficiently clever ambush to be asurprise. If you can’t \nsee the enemy coming, she may well get in a good shot at you before you notice. \nIn a surprise-attack situation, the surprised character does not get achance to \ncounterattackhis challenger on the first combat challenge. For instance, ifa player \ndoes not respond in time to an attack, but he still wins the challenge, the best he \ncan do is escape injury. Furthermore, if the challenger loses the test to attack her \nsurprisedvictim, she may call for asecondchallenge byriskinganother Trait. After \nthis second challenge, regular challenge rules resume. Overbidding is permitted \nfor both challenger and challenged in surprise situations. \nm@VEmENT IN C@mBAT \nThree-Step Rule \nAnyone who has just entered combat or who is already involved in combat \nis subject to the three-step rule. In any combat turn, a character may take up to \nthree steps and still attack. Moving one step is considered walking cautiously. \nTaking two steps is considered moving directly, and the character is down one \nTrait in Physical Challenges.

The idea is to force one's rival to back down before a real conflict \nactually arises. Success in a contest of wills is determined in one of two ways. \nFirst, it is highly recommended that this action be roleplayed out rather than \nresorting to the rules. In this case, if one of the players relents while roleplaying \nthis contest, his opponent is the winner. \nIf a quick result is needed, or if neither of the players relents, a Social \nChallenge can determine the victor instead.

As such, it is not limited to any particular religion. Even \nmages can have it, but even so, they must be of the most pure character.

Remember, however, that the character \nis still subject to the usual rules about crises of faith if he fails any such defensive \ntests, making this tactic risky at best. \nIt is much easier to lose one’s True Faith than it is to gain it.

However, the war for reality \ncan still exact a heavy toll on who fight it.

The Storyteller may decide aderangement \nis in order after any experience that generates especially intense and unpleasant \nemotions, or which violates a character’s beliefs or ethics severely. \nDerangements usually become active only when certain particular circum- ‘1 \nstances trigger them. Once activated, though, derangements remain in effect for \nthe rest of the scene, and players must modify their character’s Traits, attitudes and :,‘ \nbehavior in accordance with the derangement description. Keep in mind that a ‘- \nmage with a derangement is not the same as a Marauder. The chaos wizards have \nused some unknown magical means to harness madness as a shield against \nParadox, but a character suffering a derangement is just insane. What’s more, a \nderanged mage can still be cured, whereas the path of a Marauder is a one-way \nstreet. Of course, nothing says that a deranged mage might not take that path one \nday, but that’s a question for the player and Storyteller in question to explore. \nCharacters may resist their derangements by expending a Willpower Trait. \nThis effect lasts for one scene, but if the trigger is still present at the end of that \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Suffice it to say, however, there \nare seldom many doubts as to the veracity of these verdicts, so most mages accept \nthe punishments that are handed down, however sorrowful it may be to do so. \nWhen it comes to crimes themselves, each Tradition has its own particular \nnotions of what counts as a crime, and they police their own on such subjective \nmatters. (See the Tradition descriptions in Chapter Two for a general idea of \nwhat they do and do not find acceptable.) However, there are some crimes that \nall Traditions recognize, and they will go to great lengths to punish those who \ncommit them. The type of punishment depends on the severity of the crime of \nwhich a mage is found guilty, and it can be anything from temporary ostracism \nto a permanent mark of shame to the destruction of an offender’s very Avatar. \nCertaimen \nTwo mages who exhaust normal channels of resolving a dispute sometimes \nturn to certzimen, a wizard’s duel that pits the mages’ skill with their Spheres \nagainst each other. Certzimen is traditionally performed with at least one witness \nwho acts as a judge, and it is almost always non-lethal. Indeed, it was invented as \nan alternative to the blood feuds that were too popular in darker times. To avoid \nParadox, certamen is almost always performed in a Chantry, although Hollowers \nand others without many mystical resources occasionally practice so-called “gutter \ncert6men” in back alleys and smoky clubs. Within a proper certzimen circle, \nk however, mages have free rein to conjure all manner of Effects, since certzimen \nnever incurs Paradox. The ultimate goal of a certamen is simple: You do not attack \nyour opponent directly, you destroy his reservoir of Quintessence Traits. \nTo this end, each mage uses his Spheres to form a gladius, an aegis, and a \ni locus. The gladius is the attacking Sphere that the mage uses to launch his \nassaults on his opponent’s Quintessence. The aegis is his defensive Sphere, and \nit governs how he must attempt to thwart his opponent’s strikes. The locus is the \nSphere that represents the mage’s Quintessence Traits. A mage may switch \nwhich Sphere he is using for any one of those three purposes at any time, but \ndoing so takes up his action for the turn. In addition, a given Sphere cannot be \nused for more than one of these purposes at a time. Finally, for each successful \nattack that slips past an opponent’s defenses, the attacker destroys one of his foe’s \n:: Quintessence Traits, and the first person to destroy all of his opponent’s \nQuintessence is the winner. As part of the certamen oath, the loser is expected \nto accept defeat graciously and live by it. \nRunning certzimen is primarily a descriptive exercise, based on the Spheres \neachmage is using. For example, an attacker using a Forces gladius may declare that \nshe is manifesting it as a bolt of flame and lashing out at her foe, while her opponent \n(using Matter as his aegis) declares that he is conjuring a wall ofwater to douse her \nflames, and so on. Certzimen can be over in seconds or hours, but it is seldom dull \nto watch. Regardless of what dramatically descriptive forms they take, though, all \nstrikes, blocks and dodges are resolved like normal magical tests and retests using \n, ‘ \n1 \n. \nI ,” the Spheres involved.

Most of the time, such an immense \npronouncement is reserved for the Nephandi, since their blasphemous ways \nleave an indelible taint on the souls they touch. Unfortunately, even untainted \nmages are capable of performing hideous acts without any outside help at all. \nNaturally, no mage will submit willingly to such a punishment, so offenders \nare usually restrained physically and magically before the sentence is carried out. \nOnce the ritual is completed, the accused is either released (often after being \nmind-wiped as well) or executed, depending again on the overall severity of his \ncrimes. Some criminals are deemed too dangerous to live, even after such a \nterrible punishment, while others are let free, to live out the rest of their lives \nas a broken shell. It’s anybody’s guess as to which fate is worse. \nTHE \nS P I ~  \nWCBRLDS \nA noted Master of the Spirit Sphere once said: “Taking the first step beyond is \nalwaysthehardest.

Where do aU these spirits come from, anyway? \nWhile the answers to those and countless other such questions encompass an \nincredible amount of information, mages have come up with a few quick ways to \nexplain the various levels of reality. In actuality, the spirit worlds are not nearly so \nneatly divided or explored as these terms might suggest. The spirit worlds, also \nknown as the Umbra, are forever in flux, which confounds even the best efforts to \nmap them in the conventional sense. These terms still serve as a general reference \nso that different mages can understand each other and what the other is referring \nto. Take this advice and information to heart, but take it with agrainof salt as well. \nIn games with a preponderance of spirits and Umbral travel, you may want to \nassign a Spirit Keeper. The role of Spirit Keeper is a special Narrator position \ndesigned specifically to track the Gauntlet ratings, maintain records of spirits, \ncheck out rules for rote Effects in the Umbra and so on.

The Spirit Keeper can \nrun plots and resolve conflicts based on this information, thereby easing the \nStoryteller’s load and providing a deeper knowledge of the subject matter. \n~ A G I C  \nIN THE U ~ B R A  \nAs a general rule of thumb, most magic isn’t vulgar in the Umbra because \nreality is more flexible there. Certain Effects are still always vulgar, however, no \nmatter where you go. Some of those Effects include performing Gilgul, healing \naggravated wounds or various permanent Effects such as body alteration or \ncreating a Realm. The Storyteller is the final arbiter ofwhat is or isn’t vulgar in the \nUmbra. He and the Spirit Keeper should take care that players with access to the \nspirit world respect its hazards, rather than simply using it as a cheap way of casting \npowerful magic without repercussions. Note also that even if a mage casts a vulgar \nEffect in the Umbra to avoid the Paradox, sending it into the real world may still \nbe Paradoxical. Doing so may also cause the Effect to erode due to Unbelief. \nIt should also be noted that different levels of the Umbra have their own house \nrules as the mage travels farther from Earth. For example, Entropy Effects are never \nvulgar in the decaying Dark Umbra, but creating some form of pure, untainted \nmatter would be incredibly vulgar there, since it goes against the Underworld’s \nparadigm. Mages should take care to mind their surroundings, especially when \npaying a house call on a particularly powerful or nasty spirit, lest they receive an \nunpleasant surprise from Paradox when they try to cast powerful magical Effects. If \npossible, the Storyteller and Spirit Keeper should decide what types of Effects are \nvulgar within a given Realm in advance so as to maintain consistency. \nTHE TELLURIAN \nThe Tellurian is what would be more conventionally known as the universe. \nAnything that can be dreamed of or described has the potential to exist, and it \nquite possibly does already exist somewhere in the Tellurian, even if we haven’t \nfound it yet. Everything is part of the Tellurian in one way or another. \nTHE TAPESTRY \nDespite what mages like to say, even they can’t conceive of the Tellurian in its \npurest state. There’s simply too much for even them to process effectively. Therefore, \nmages use the common metaphor of the Tapestry to represent reality. Every possibility \nor dream is a thread that is woven into the skein of reality. Mages have the talent to \nre-weave the threads as they desire, and thus to shape possibilities to their own ends. \nOf course, yanking on the threads of reality is dangerous. Too much stress on a \nparticular thread will snap it, and an untrained mage might get tangled up in a snarl. \nThat’s a cute way of explaining what happens when a mage suffers a Paradox Backlash, \nbut it also serves to teach an important lesson. Care must be taken not to alter the :‘ \nTapestry too much at once, or else.. . well, no one really knows, but it can’t be good. \nIn fact, it might just end reality as we know it. Mages can’t simply pull out the heavy- \nduty Effects and slug it out with the Technocracy. Not only would Paradox eat \neveryone for lunch, but the damage to the Tapestry would most likely be irrevocable. \nThe first obstacle any mage must overcome is the Gauntlet, the metaphysi- \ncal barrier that separates Earth from the spirit realms.

With the Horizon crumbling \nand reality stagnating, however, this speculation may become more than an \nacademic exercise all too soon. \nTHE \nUITIBRA \nIN PLAY \nHaving looked at the risks that even a simple crossing of the Gauntlet \nentails, many mages (and more than a few Storytellers) may ask themselves: \nWhy bother? After all, the Ascension War is over and the real action’s here on \nearth, right? Well, yes and no. The following are some quick hints and potential \nstory hooks for Storytellers who wish to incorporate the Umbra into their games: \nCuriosity: If mages were the stayat-home types, they’d still be Sleeping. \nAcquisition and use of the Spirit Sphere, discovery of a powerful gateway, the \nsearch for answers to a difficult problem or even just a need to know what lurks \nunder the surface of reality can all spark Umbral stories. A great deal of \ninformation exists in the Umbra that can’t be gained anywhere else, not to \nmention an endless source of mysteries for interested players. \nParadigm: Another obvious motivating factor for the use of the Umbra in \nplay is that many mages’ paradigms incorporate some of it on aregular basis. Most \nDreamspeakers communicate with spirits regularly, and they may travel to the \nhomes of their ethereal cousins to beg aid, do battle or return favors. Hermetic \nwizards frequently invoke spirits in all kinds of rotes, and they may travel to the \nOtherworlds for tutelage or out of obligation. More than a few Hollow Ones \nbegin their careers with a Ouija board, and they may be tempted by wraithly \ncontacts into glimpsing the afterlife firsthand. (Not that this idea is a particu- \nlarly good one, but most Hollowers have no idea of the real risks.) Don’t let one \nmage’s paradigm overshadow the rest of the game, though. Involving the Umbra \nin every story when only one or two mages are capable there gets boring fast. Use \nthe Umbra as a rich, intriguing side-setting for those skilled in its ways. \nDiplomacy: Perhaps one or more of the mages are ambassadors to the local \nspirit courts. Some Celestial Chorus members take the “emissaries of Heaven” \nrole seriously, after all, and many Euthanatos Chantries offer aid and recom- \npense to the Restless Dead so as to avoid incurring their wrath during the course \nof their duties. A mage with faerie blood might be called upon to make amends \nfor a unwitting slight against the Fair Folk, while a mage with shapechanger kin \nmight seek to make peace between his cabal and the local werewolves. The mage \nmight even be an envoy to or from Horizon, trying re-establish communication \nand guidance between the two worlds. \nNecessity: The Mother of All Plot Hooks, necessity can drag the characters \ninto Umbral stories whether they’re ready or not. Just make sure that the players \ndon’t feel like you’re jerking them around. Perhaps a Nephandus or Marauder \narrives from beyond the Gauntlet and begins wrecking havoc, and the mages \nmust follow their fleeing enemy to ensure that he’s been finished off. A love- \nstruck faerie might steal away a character’s friend or lover, beginning a classic \nrescue tale.

Sometimes they seem almost human, while \nthey elude any sort of coherent classification at others. All that mages can say \nwith certainty is that many, many types of spirits are out there, and that they \nhave a multitude of potential powers. Therefore, spirits can be potent allies if a \nmage is properly respectful. \nSpirits rarely appear in the material world - \nthe Gauntlet makes doing so \nvery difficult. However, they do find mages (and other living creatures that can \ninteract with them) extremely interesting. As such, any mage who travels into \nthe Umbra is likely to run into a spirit at some point. \nSPIRIT \nCREATICBN \nWhile some mages try to classify spirits, it’s difficult to pigeonhole them all. \nSpirits seem to have their own hierarchy, although not all spirits fit into it. \nIn game terms, a spirit may rank anywhere from a minor entity to a godlike \nbeing, and it’s up to the Spirit Keeper to assign it powers and traits as appropriate. \nA minor spirit may be little better than an animal with three or four Traits in \neach Attribute category, a Trait of Quintessence and one Initiate-level power. \nA divine entity, on the other hand, may have 20 or more Traits in each \nAttribute, a similar amount of Quintessence and a full range of Disciple-, Adept- \nand Master-level powers. The spirit’s exact powers and capabilities depend upon \nthe needs of the story, though. There’s no formula to catch all spirits, and a mage \ncan’t simply look at a spirit and say, “Oh, that spirit has only two powers and six \npoints of Quintessence.” Spirits are mysterious entities and potential adversaries \nor allies, not collections of numbers. \nSPIRIT \nTRAITS \nSpirits don’t have normal Traits, unless they create or possess a material body. \nA spirit uses its Rage (instead of Physical Traits) to attack, its Gnosis instead of \nMental or Social Traits, and its Charms toperform magical (Paradox-free) effects. \nA spirit also typically has a pool of Power to enhance its Charms and fuel its \nexistence. Such Power is inherent to the spirit, and it cannot be stolen from it. \nSpirits often have a few Abilities, and they may even have some Negative \nTraits, as appropriate to their purpose. \nSAl-I-IPLE SPIrnS \nThe two sample spirits here simply provide some ideas on what spirits might \nbe able to do in your games. \n~\nI\nN\n~\nR\n \nSPIRIT \nw FIN \nThe minor spirit of fire appears as a small, flickering flame in various \nshades of red, yellow, orange and blue.

Keep notes on who’s doing what to whom, what \ngroups and cabals are active in what areas and where you see the story going.

If you really want to go all the way, you \ncan print up the cards on a computer, then laminate them so that they’ll be tough \nand reusable instead of getting crumpled up in someone’s pocket. \nNametags.

The same is true if, say, a person has \na strange physical feature or he is under a visible magical Effect. \nEffect cards.

Great stories rarely pop fully formed out of thin air. \nMaking up a story requires you to simmer some thoughts and mix some ideas, then \nbake them with a bit of effort and hope for the best. It’s a rather haphazard process, \nbut dealing with the unforeseen elements that emerge is part of the fun. \nEvery Storyteller has his own style of running a game, so you’ll need to find \nout how you’re most comfortable. Some Storytellers rush from place to place and \nhandle every arbitration, giving the players constant input. Others like to step \nback and watch the game flow on its own, while players guide most of the action \nthemselves. No one style is more or less valid than any other.

Although certain thematic elements \nremain similar, such as the need for plots and Storyteller moderation, the scales \nare totally different. A Storyteller for a live-action game undertakes a large-scale \neffort to fulfill many players’ expectations, instead of running events around a \nsingle table. The difference in scale has some important consequences: \nIn live-action games, you don’t have unlimited oversight. At a tabletop game, \nyou get to see everything that happens and you know what every player’s character is \ndoing. In live-action games, players’ characters may wander around and plot secretly, \nand you won’t be involved. As a result, you’ll have to make judgment calls based on \nincomplete or inaccurate information sometimes. Perhaps a player is cheating, but you \ncan’t verify it because you weren’t there, or maybe some characters traded dormation \nwhile you weren’t present and the final tally of who knows what will surprise you. You \ncan usually take these matters on trust, but it’s often best to err on the side of caution. \nYou may not have the luxury of interacting personally with everyone. A \ntabletop game allows everyone to sit down as friends and build characters that \nare designed to work together (or at least not to kill each other right off the bat). \nIn a live-action game with dozens or hundreds of players, you may have players \nyou know only vaguely, players who don’t get along and characters who are \ndesigned to arrive at loggerheads. \nExpect a level of player friction at some point, because it happens when you \nget so many personalities together at once.

You have the right to eject a problem player \nand make calls based on personal judgment because you’re trying to build a game \nfairly for everyone to have fun, not a story centered around one hero. \nSpeaking of centric games, the characters find themselves in the middle \nof events in tabletop play, and they face down the Storyteller’s antagonists. In \nlive-action games, the enemies may often be other players’ characters, and no \nplayer’s character is guaranteed a plot’s spotlight. Inevitably, you’ll have to \nsoothe hard feelings between players who come into conflict, and you’ll need to \nkeep an eye out for the unfortunates who become bored or get run roughshod \nover by more talkative or aggressive players.

For some players, \nthough there’s no satisfaction like beating down another player’s character or \nsolving a juicy plot in order to reap the rewards themselves. \nA subtler level of problem lies in character balance. For a tabletop group of a \nhalf-dozen people, you can usually introduce new characters with a minimum of fuss \nand tweak their starting power levels to fit them into the game. In a large, long-running \nlive-action game, you’ll have some powerful characters and some who have just been \ncreated, and you’ll want to make sure that everyone starts off on an even keel. \nUnfortunately, you’ll run into situations where old-characters dominate \nthe game and new players feel that they can’t participate or accomplish anything \nmeaningful. A couple of solutions to this problem exist, althoughnone are really \neasy to swallow. First, you can slow long-term characters’ rate of advancement. \n! If, for instance, you charge an extra Experience Trait for every advancement the \nplayer makes after his character has earned his first 25 or 50 Traits, you’ll subtly \nslow older characters’ improvement. You can stack this modifier if necessary to \nslow down really old characters even more, and to prevent your group from \nhaving one multi-Sphere Master running around blasting everything. \nSecond, you can “cap out” or retire old and powerful characters. You do so \nby halting character advancement at 100 Experience Traits or requiring char- \nacters to go out of play when they reach this level of experience. This \nrequirement leaves a sour taste in many players’ mouths, though, because it \nundercuts their sense of accomplishment. \nThird, you can intervene with the game’s natural flow in order to promote \noverall fun. You can go to the powerful characters’ players beforehand and say, \n“Hey, guys, I’d like you to keep your hands off this one plot. It’s for the new people.” \n: Give them something big to face down with all their Traits while leaving the new \ncharacters a few minor ordeals that would be a snap for the old-timers. \n, \nKe ST~RY \nINGREDIENTS \nI \nNow that you know a few things to watch out for, you’re ready to drop \ntogether some ingredients and mix your own story.

Is it better to enforce change \nfrom without or to let it spring from within? \nEnlightenment - \nWhat steps and paths lead to true enlightenment? What \nis enlightenment, anyway? Is enlightenment exclusive of material effort, or does \nit acknowledge worldliness? Is it even a worthwhile goal at all? \nHope - \nDoes hope even exist in the World of Darkness? Who and what can \nbring hope? Is hope itself just a sham designed to lead on the gullible, or can there \nreally be something better? What hopes and dreams most drive humanity to excel? \nMorality - \nWho or what determines morality? Who are the keepers of \nmorals and ethics? Are these social constructs even necessary? What morals (if \nany) transcend individuals, cities, nations, worlds? \nOrder -Do \npeople function better in an orderly fashion, or do the \nconstraints of order take away too much? Is there an order to the universe at all? \nWho are the keepers of order, and who decides what’s conducive to order? \nExploration-What \nfrontiers remain today? Are there limits and places to which \npeople shouldn’t go? How far will people go in search of something new, different or \nbetter?

Too many swings of emotion cause \nthe mood to become diluted. \nSome moods you can play with include, but are not limited to: \nSadness - \nPerhaps your game focuses on loss, dashed hope or ennui. The \ncharacters face the depths of despair, in how much magic has left the world and \nin the inevitable trials of humanity. \nActive -The chronicle is frenetic. Things are always happening, the world \nis moving forward, and characters must be fast on their feet to keep up. Everyone \nfeels like there’s no time to take a breath, and matters careen forward constantly. \nThis type of game can be exciting or terrifying, but it’s always in motion. \nMystery- With the many trials that mages face, especially given the dearth \nof good teachers and old Masters, many become confused by the diversity of the \nmystical world. The characters don’t know what to expect. Puzzling spirits and \ninsoluble natural phenomena face them. The characters may be certain of their \nowncapabilities, but the world itselfseems too grand to comprehend in its entirety. \nAnger - In an angry world, everyone’s pissed off at something. The \nTraditions are mad at the Technocracy for quashing magic. The Technocrats are \nmad at the Traditions for slowing progress. The masses are mad at everyone for \njerking them around and giving them a mediocre world. Tempers flare easily, \nand everyone has a grudge. Violence seems right around the corner, and tragedy \nresults when tempers erupt. The setting is bright and splashed with red and \nyellow reminders of the fire lurking just beneath. \nPassion - \nMages believe so strongly about things that they literally change \nthe world with those beliefs. Everyone holds something dear, be it a loved one, \na philosophy or a treasured heritage. Play up the conflict of passions. Reason falls \nby the wayside as people follow their hearts. Settings seem romantic or brooding, \ndesigned to evoke deep emotions. \nPLW \nWhile the theme and mood provide underlying foundation for a story, the \nplot is really the story itself. It’s the thread of material and imagination that \nunravels to reveal a long tale. Your plots encompass who’s doing what, where the \nimportant stuff resides and what’s going to happen come hell or high water. In \nshort, it’s the record of events that come together to tell a coherent story. \nYour game needs a couple of g o d  plots to hold it together.

On the other hand, some \nthings happen so suddenly and twist lives around so profoundly that they can’t last \nmore than an instant. Both are valid and necessary angles of plot. For players who \nlike to puzzle out problems and toy with recurring villains, elements and problems, \nlongrunningplotsfit the bill. Otherplayersfind long-termplotsconfusingorboring. \nFor them you interject the occasional short-term plot that’s designed to keep things \nmoving and to show that sometimes the world upends in fast and strange ways. \nYou can dig up plot ideas just about anywhere.

Therefore, a traveler or recently discovered book or artifact offers the \npromise of knowledge, if only the mages will solve some problem or travel to some \nplace. The mages must exercise their current knowledge in order to reach the next \npinnacle and eventually acquire access to some tutor that imparts new knowledge. \nTheMeetingofMinds-Severalmagescome together to trade wisdomandmake \ndiplomatic overtures. Perhaps a few have access to aNode, and they want to trade that \npower for use of the library another group holds. Maybe some mages need to end \nhostilities, or resolve a conflict over influence on some part of the city. Perhaps the \nmages need to bring new apprentices up to speed and establish a united front against \nopposition. Regardless, it’s a job for wits, social skills and political maneuvering. \nAscension War - \nAlthough most mages recognize that opening the entire \nworld to magic all at once is probably futile, wars over ideology remain. Some \nTechnocrats continue to hunt mages, while some mages believe that the \nSleepers can be freed to make their own destiny only if the Technocrats are \noverthrown. Marauders follow their own twisted agendas, and they often come \ninto conflict with other mages. And everyone hates the Nephandi. But who’ll \nwin? The characters must marshal resources and find allies if they’re to survive, \nespecially if it’s an unwanted conflict thrust upon them. \nLost and Bygone - \nSome strange phenomenon or creature appears in the \ncity. Although it’s elusive, it holds the promise of some magical power. Perhaps \nit must draw its energy from somewhere, or it’s a sign that an important magical \nevent has occurred. The characters try to track it down and figure out why it \nappeared, how it came to be and perhaps how to turn it to their advantage. \n; - \nSETTING \nWhen you’ve figured out your plot, theme and the like, you can decide on a \nsetting.

The setting itself influences how your players \nfeel, which in turn helps you provide a given theme and mood. \nRemember that your setting isn’t just limited to our modem world and time. \nAlthough many mages recognize the importance of the here-and-now , of having \nto make a difference on Earth and fighting to survive in day-to-day living, quite \na few mages also jaunt off to strange hidden lands or even spirit worlds. Perhaps \nyour game takes place in a realm of fantasy or a spaceship crewed by Sons of \nEther. You can also experiment with different periods of history. You might try \nplaying mages who work with the Cult of Mercury in old Rome (see Dead Magic) \nor Renaissance mages in the ages of discovery and exploration. \nPACING \nOnce a plot comes crashing to a premature conclusion or a group of players \nmanages to sit on a story arc for an entire night and reduce it to boredom, you’ll \nrecognize the value of pacing. On the Storyteller end, your pacing needs to be \nultimately flexible. There’s no way around it. Sometimes players surprise you \nwith an incredible plan that solves your month-long story arc, and sometimes \nthey just miss all the hooks. \nPacing often bows to mood and theme. If you’re running a very action- \noriented game, you will want to pace things quickly. Characters appear, do \nthings and disappear. Events flash-fry, and players must react quickly. In a more \nsedate game, you might leave events dangling for a little while. Give players the \nchance to grab on to something if it interests them, even if it takes a little while \nto notice. Don’t force it, though. If your plot hangs out to dry for three months \nand nobody cares, it may be time to move on. \nAnother important part of pacing is judging your players. For instance, you might \nhave a plot that starts up only when some people use a specific set of investigative skills \nor magics on a game element. If your players are more bang-up types, they may not try \nthe cerebral approach immediately. You’ll need to pace appropriately, leaving enough \ncluesfor them to follow. Ifyouhavevery cautious players, you’llhave tobecarefulabout \npushingthem intoaction, lest they find themselves overwhelmed. Remember, the idea \nt isn’t to have plots that totally stump the players or run them over. It’s to introduce story \nelements that the players can have fun with. \nThe real key to mastering pacing is to become adaptable on the fly. In the \nmiddle of a game, some player will inevitably pull off some magical Effect you \ndidn’t foresee. The answer is not to shoot it down or panic, but to adapt to the \nsituation. Check your cribbed notes on plot (You did write down plot notes, \nright?) and see where you’re planning to go, then make a ruling on the spot. Be \n, prepared to throw out an angle that isn’t working, and realize that sometimes the \n^*’ players will do things out of order like confronting the adversaries before \nI acquiring the Really Big Guns. Be prepared to spin things. In the aforemen- \ntioned case, you might want to fiddle with the adversaries’ Traits, depending on \nwhether you want them to be defeated or just to trounce the players a little. \nIf you find your game lagging, try to pick up the pace. Having players who have \ntoo much to do is usually better than having nothing to do. People come to the game \nto do something, after all. If matters lag, consider tossing in another character, aclue, \n. a new element or anything to keep things moving.

That’s okay. Your only real limit is how much you can logistically handle. \nYou can influence your game’s scale actively by doing things like recruiting \nnew players or putting a cap on the number of players you allow in the game. If \nyou don’t want more than, say, 20 players, just stop accepting new characters at \nthat point. Similarly, if you feel that the game hasn’t hit critical mass, send your \nplayers out to find friends and relatives who want to join in. \nScale is important primarily to two things: how much you can handle, and \nhow much your plot can bear. As a Storyteller, you have to arbitrate a load of work \nalready. If you have too many players, your game becomes unmanageable. You’ll \nwant to recruit Narrators from your player base. A good ratio is one Narrator for \nevery five to 10 players. You might even require that every player spend some time \nas a Narrator every few games, just to make sure that you have enough Narrators \nand antagonist characters. On the plot side, your stories may suffer if too many \npeople become involved. Thirty-eight destructive mages converging on one foe \ncan wreck that angle, while too few mages might not have the skills to muster to \nsolve a specific plot. Your plots should to some degree be driven by scale, to make \nsure that you have stories that everyone has a chance to participate in. If you have \nmore people, you’ll want to have more Narrators and more plots, naturally. \nRemember also that it’s generally a bad idea to hang all of a plot on one hook. \nRegardless of the size of your game, you should have multiple threads ofresolution. \nIf you rely on one specific individual to resolve a plot, you may find yourself out \nof luck if the player doesn’t show up or the character disappears.

Can your characters actually affect the \noutcome of world-shaking plots, or are they limited to more modest goals? The \nscope of play is the level at which the characters’ actions have an effect. \nconvention game, you just need a couple of locations and a few plots.

Either way, the climax is the focal pint and crux of the action. It’s \nthe point at which the players sweat over their decisions and agonize over their \ncharacters’ capabilities. It’s the point at which the plot becomes mostly clear, and the \nfast, furious resolution takes over. In a large game, you may even have several plots that \nall have different climax points that all occur at different times. Typically, the climax \noccurs when the players have enough clues and story angles to find a resolution to some \nproblem or complication, and they bring their characters’ powers to bear. If you must, \nyou can introduce a Narrator character or the like to set a climax, but it’s usually best \nfor the players to experience the sense of accomplishment themselves. \nDuring play, you’ll probably be running around fast and furious, narrating \nchallenges, shoring up problems, making rules calls on-the-spot and providing supprt \nto Narrator characters. Expect it. Players are a fickle lot, and they often long for \nguidance. You probably won’t have time to play a character of your own. Let your \nNarrators handle the important characters, since you’ll have to set up all the challenges \nfor the climax (especially if you decide to use a plot element that busts the rules). \nDenouement \nAfter the story’s height comes the denouement - \nthe aftermath. The players \ntie up loose ends, find out what was really going on and try to recover from the \nwreckage of the scenery. They also lay the groundwork for the next story. For some, \nit’s the realization that the resolution of one puzzle raised additional questions. For \nothers, it’s simply amatter of moving on to the next enemy target. The denouement \nprovides a little breathing space and a chance to feel the sense of accomplishment. \nAt this point, you’ll find that you’re not running challenges so much as \noverseeing the use of Influence and the dissemination of information. Players will \ntry to get involved in the aftermath or dig up more information about what the hell \njust happened. This point is actually a pretty good one at which to play a side \ncharacter so that you can act as a mouthpiece and clearing-house for information. \nKeep your notes handy. You’ll need them, especially as players tell you what they \nhave planned for the game’s new long-range direction in light of recent events. \nWrap-up \nTechnically, thewrapupisn’tpartofthestoryasmuchasastageofthegame \nitself. \nDuringthewrap-up, youput away yourpropsandsendyourplayerspacking. often, the \nplayers will want to meet somewhere to wind down and talk about the event (perhaps \nstill at the game site, perhaps a restaurant or other location).

For instance, you should take the time to make notes about your \nplots while the results remain fresh in your mind. \npL@TS AND PLANS \nSo you have this phenomenal story to tell. Will the players enjoy it? You \ncan’t guarantee that they will, but you can pay attention to a few game factors \nto help. Telling a live-action story is a collaborative effort. Without the players, \nyou have no cast through which to tell the tale. Therefore, you should take steps \nto involve them in the creation of plots. Sometimes players will surprise you and \ncome up with plots on their own as well. The more that you can tailor your plots \nto the things that players enjoy, the more fun you’ll foster. \nBACKGRBUND \nAND HIST~RY \nPL~TS \nRemember back when your players made their characters and wrote up histories \nand lives for them? You know, the part other than the Traits. These histories are \nwonderful indicators for useful plots. Not only can you use elements of these histories \nin the game, but you can use them to gauge the sorts of things that the players find \ninteresting. Ideally, a history is rife with everything from the character’s first magely \nmentor to his family and friends to fallings-out in jobs or relationships. Perhaps the \ncharacter had some passion - \nlike a desire to become a great baseball player - \nor he \nfailed miserably at some effort. Work these passions into the story. Maybe the mage \nsponsorsormentorssomeone whohas talen tsthatremindthemageofherpast. Perhaps \na jilted lover returns for vengeance or reconciliation. You don’t have to look far. The \nlives that these mages had before the Awakening provide ample fodder for stories. \nEach main plot dovetails into your overall chronicle or story execution as \nwell as your theme. These plots are the ones that drive the whole chronicle \nforward andchange its face. Typically, a main plot’s resolution impacts everyone \nin the game, or it represents a substantial triumph or defeat. \nFor instance, you might center a plot on the Technocracy’s attempt to \nestablish a high-tech base of operations in the city. Mages with Influence will start \nto feel the effects, and their Contacts will tell that something’s up. Gradually, the \nTechnocracy will make its presence known with agents and manipulations to local \ngovernment and society. Mages who fight the Technocracy will need to act early \nI to prevent or slow this change. Others may find their activities curtailed or crushed \n’ as the Technocracy co-opts city resources. No mage’s life will remain unaffected \natter what stance the individual takes toward the Technoc- \nthe consequences of each character’s response should have a \ndirect and measurable result on the overall story. \nlayer will spin off his own little plot or interest. If a Hermetic \n; mage manages to lay his hands on an old tome, for instance, it may help him with \n: \nhis studies but it probably won’t affect the course of the whole game. Every mage \n. \n* goes through ups and downs, just like any other person, and these tribulations \nI ,” form small stories of their own. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "Often, a character’s subplot takes primary importance to the player. A character \nbent on becoming a Master will probably spend more time (and Experience Traits) \non magical development than on the petty squabbles that occupy other mages. \nThese drives aren’t necessarily indications that the main plots aren’t important, but \nyou should pay attention to them. When a player ignores your main plot to do \nsomething else, that’s an indication of a need for a subplot. \nSome subplots are small and tidy enough to resolve on their own. If two \ncharacters argue over ideological differences, for instance, you’ll find that they \ncan sit and harangue one another for hours without interference. Indeed, getting \nin the middle may derail the fun. On the other hand, a character hunting down \na specific goal may need a little attention. Trying to find a hated enemy or long- \nlost treasure usually requires the Storyteller’s intervention. \nSome subplots turn into major plots without warning, which can be good \nfor you. It means you don’t have to do a lot of work, but all the players have \nsomething else to involve themselves in. Just make sure that these plots don’t \novershadow your original game. If a mage’s recruitment drive turns into a huge \nforce to overthrow the Technocracy, your careful game of ideology and wonder \nmay turn into a violence-fest. Pay careful attention to subplots. You can nurture \nthem or turn them to your direction if you intervene early. Besides, your plots \nmay well dovetail with the subplots, making a larger and more involved story. \nMages don’t exist in a vacuum. Membership in a Tradition carries with it the \ncamaraderie ofother mages. Whendifferent Traditions meet, their opinions inevitably \nloom large in their interpersonal relations. Characters will naturally come to settle into \ntheir own patterns of relationships, especially if you encourage a little conflict. \nNovice players may have a little trouble with this aspect of the game at first. \nThe “we’re all in this together” mentality can quash many interesting debates. \nTo fire matters up, try tossing in a Narrator character with some strong opinions. \nLet the players debate back and forth, and have a couple of different Narrator \nmages of different Traditions argue their own points of view, then try to drag in \ntheir allies. Hopefully, your players will take the bait and start debating the \nstrengths and weaknesses of their Tradition policies. \nFurthermore, mages have families, co-workers, lovers and enemies just like \nanyoneelse.Since they dealmostwithothermages, theotherplayersnaturallyfillthese \nroles. As long as everyone’s comfortable with the separation of in-game and out-of- \n* \ngame motives and there aren’t hard feelings between players whose characters dislike :i \none another, this focus makes for good story fodder. A mage might use influence to gain \n7 \npetty revenge against a hated co-worker or sacrifice his ideals to help his family or lover. :! \nAs you put together your plots and ideas, remember that conflict is your \nfriend. Although many players are happy to have games ofpolitical maneuvering f \nand philosophical debate, it’s the clash of ideas and opinions that makes them \nfun. For some players, overcoming the conflict is what’s enjoyable. For others, \nit’s watching how people react to the struggle and how they succeed or fail. \nRegardless, conflict keeps matters moving. \nDon’t hesitate to shake things up.

Nothing galvanizes players as \nquickly as establishing some problem that impacts the characters directly. \nCREATING \nTHE SJZTTING \nThe story’s setting will have an immediate, tangible impact on its tone and \nmood, and it will influence the characters’ actions from the very first game \nsession. Your choice of setting and how you detail it can enhance or encumber \nyour plot dramatically, so don’t skimp on this element of the story. \nFINDING \nG m e  LKATICBNS \nThe normal people out there (read: those who don’t play live-action games) \ngenerally frown upon and don’t understand such activities, especially in public. \nFor this reason, if nothing else, you’ll want a private location to play. \nMost troupes won’t be able to afford to rent an actual building. If you can, \ngreat! Charge a couple bucks to offset costs, and make sure that you are careful \nnot to destroy the scenery. There’s no sense getting on peoples’ bad sides. \nIt’s more likely, though, that you’ll use a friend’s house. If you can arrange \nit, have a couple of different rooms set up. Use one for the main game site, one \nfor the Umbra (if that’s important to your game) and one for off-site actions and \nyour little office where you can store records and check people into play. \nRegardless of locale, make sure that you’re ready to cough up an explanation of \nwhat you’re doing if necessary. If your hends’ family members drop by or a few \nL wandering curious people from the general public spot the game, they may want to \nknow what’s going on. If you’ve been careful not to have too many public displays of \n“magic” you can usually explain the nature of the game. You may want to have a few \npapersonhandwithaquickdescription, perhapsaspartofyourvenuestylesheet. Don’t \nbother arguing with people about your game, especially local community folks like \nchurch leaders and police officers. You maybe just enjoying yourselves, but if they feel \nthat the game is threatening, they have the law and the community on their side. \nObviously, some settings are nigh-impossible to replicate.

If your setting is supposed to be a seedy part \nof town across from a cemetery, for instance, then perhaps mages who use Spirit \nmagic will catch occasional glimpses of ghosts, or ghosts may spot them. If you \ndecide that the location’s just a short distance from a police department, then \nthe mages will need to be much more careful to avoid attracting attention. \nThe setting location itself cangive you little plot bombs to seed in the area. Each \none is a subplot waiting to happen. Just make sure to look over the area in advance \nand decide what you want to do or how the rest of the world might impact upon it. \nMages move through varied environments, so use little hints to help set the \nstage. Colors help to set moods. Use bright and hot colors like orange, red and \nyellow for frenetic games; use purple and blue for more languorous environs. \nYour trappings provide a hint for the imagination to springboard from. A piece \nof statuary isn’t only a chunk of background scenery, it’s a mood piece that tells \nabout the setting based on its style and pose. A sparse room without decoration \ncarries a message just as surely as a lavish one does. \nh B L 4 N C E  \nLIGHTING \nThe World of Darkness is intrinsically a darker, more shadowy place. Alleys \nare dangerous with black shade, and clouds loom in the sky with a threat of \nthunder. While you can’t control the weather, you can influence interior \nlighting. For a moody, sedate game, use blue-colored lights, close the blinds and \nput dark rugs on the floor to absorb reflection. Vary the lights as the story \ndemands. Perhaps a great magical working causes lights to blow out, or more \nlights are appropriate for a large meeting. You can use candles or lamps (if you’re \ncareful with the flame) to represent a more archaic setting, like the sanctum of \nan ancient Hermetic. If you’re showcasing the Umbra, try dark blue and violet \nlighting. For the Shadowlands, mix a few dim lights with some blacklight. \n, \nmus1c \nAlthough you must be careful not to allow it to overpower the game, music adds \na definite edge. Queue up a CD player in the comer with some soft ambient music, \npreferably without distracting lyrics, and you’ll generate some undertones without \nmuch effort. Music has a powerful emotional impact, but it’s best when it’s subtle. \nIf you have to shout to be heard over the words of the music, it’s just distracting. \nDifferent sorts of music are appropriate for different venues. New Age and \ntrance help to convey a mystical feeling, as do traditional instrumental pieces \nsuch as folk music. Classical music gives a grandiose, regal bearing, such as might \nbe appropriate for a convocation of Tradition mages. Techno and industrial can \naccompany Technocrats or certain Tradition technomancers. Darkwave and \nGothic music works for Hollow Ones, dealings with ghosts and spirit worlds. So \ndoes Native American folk music. Gregorian chants are appropriate for slow, \nreligious proceedings like high ceremonies and churches, while Akashic Broth- \nerhood initiates would relax among Buddhist chants and Taiko drums. You can \nalso use natural sounds (sounds of rain, running water or the like) to simulate the \nnaturalistic impact of groups like the Verbena or the feel of the spirit world \nmeeting the material. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Since players will \nrecognize them and associate them with various memories or moods, the props have \na powerful impact - \nmore so if they can be picked up and used by your players. \nStage Props \nThe stage props are the pieces of art and furniture that help set the scene. These \nsettings range from the mundane to the magnificent. You don’t need to spend a lot of \nmoneyorbeawizardat interiordesign.Useyourpiecestoaccentuate,nottooverburden. \nYou’ll find many useful stage pieces around your own house. A painting or mural \nin one room can help set a specific tone, or you might bring along some furniture like \nchairs (very handy since your players probably won’t appreciate standing around all \nnight) orlamps intowhichyoucanputyourcoloredlightbulbs. \nDropinarug orcarpet. \nYou can use sheets, drapes or even towels to make wall hangings or to cover an \ninconvenient window. A bowl of h i t  or a vae can add a touch of class to a bare table. \nEven if you don’t have the props you want at home, you can usually pick some \nup cheaply. Offer incentives to your players who help out. An Experience Trait \naward for logistics may be a nice kicker to promote bringing in handy props. Set \nup a prop list of pieces you want (which will also make a nice checklist when you \npack up at the end of a game). You’ll find that antique stores and secondhand stores \noften have some odd knickknacks. These trinkets are especially appropriate for \nmages, since mages tend to collect odd items reminiscent of specific cultures or \nhistorical periods. Therefore, that odd little cherub statue or Aztec mosaic may be \njust the piece to go with your Celestial Chorus or Dreamspeaker characters. \nSmall props tend to be more useful than large props, just because they’re easy \nto use. Remember that you’ll have to lug the props around to set up your game site. \nIf it takes you longer to set up the props than to play the actual game, it’s taking too \nmuch effort. A large oaken table may be just the thing you want, but if you can’t lug \nit around and it keeps people from moving around the room, it may not be worth the \neffort. Accentuate first. Put special lighting near trophy pieces or stick a piece on top \nof a table or whatnot to draw attention without taking up too much room. \nPersonal Props \nNot every player can spare the investment for all the foci and trappings of a \ncharacter. As Storyteller, you should facilitate these things by bringing along some \npersonal props of your own. Not only does doing so allow you to showcase the sorts of \nprops you consider good, but it lets you set a standard of what is and isn’t acceptable. \nIt also helps players who otherwise wouldn’t have the appropriate materials, and it lets \nyou keep a bunch of props on hand with which to supply your Narrator characters. \nLike stage props, you should use personal props judiciously. A great gnarled \nstaff is a nifty conversation piece, but it’s no good when it’s whacking other \nplayers and getting caught in doorways. Look for bits of jewelry or clothing, \nespecially in second-hand stores, for cheap accessories that bring out the \ncharacter’s personality. A Euthanatos might look like an average Joe in black \nclothes, until you add on the necklace of Kali, while a Dreamspeaker could have \n1 . - elaborate feathers, paints, rattles and dream-catchers for a high ritual ceremony. \nAs noted before, Laws of Ascension tends to be rather setup intensive.

A Storyteller might find time to run a character, but more often it’ll \ntake all the time and effort to keep the story moving while keeping records current. \nHard copy is your friend. Many Traits fluctuate wildly in play, so take note as \nbest you can. Obviously you can’t track easily the flow of things like Quintessence \nor every Ability Trait used, but you can take notes on good roleplayers, new rotes \nlearned, plot points that showed up and checklists that you’ve made.

Doing so serves many pu~poses. \nIf your players lose their records, you have new copies for them. You can also update \ncharacter records between games.

If a \nplayereamsanExperienceTraitorleamsanewrote,youcanwriteitdownimmediately. \nThen update your database at the end of the game, and you’ll keep current. \nThe advancement rate in your game depends a lot on how much experience \nyou award. Typically, you shouldn’t award more than two or three Traits in a \ngame session, with four tops for the absolute best roleplay, logistical help and the \nlike. Don’t forget that even experience isn’t the only measure of advancement. \nAs shown on p. 137, just learning certain Spheres can take a lot of time. \nMake sure to keep running tallies of Experience Traits on character \nrecords. That way, you know just how much the character needs to advance \nand how much he’s already spent. Plus, the player can calculate on his own \nand savor the anticipation. \nTypically, you should award one Experience Trait for surviving a game \nsession. A strong roleplaying session is worth an extra Trait, and you might award \na Trait for agood costume, achieving a specific goal or helping with Narration and \nlogistics. When you give roleplaying bonuses, popular acclaim is a good measure \nbut it’s not the only measure.

Two characters might use \nopposing Influences to make bids for power. You need to keep careful track of \nwho does what, and when, in order to make sure that Influences clash correctly. \nIf a mage uses Church Influence to stop something at the beginning of the game, \ntake a note so that someone later using Political Influence to change it winds up \nproperly fighting over the Influence clash.

You need them to feel comfortable voicing their concerns, and \n, am you should watch them so that you can head off problems before they hit. \nSTCBRY \nEVENTS \nHopefully, your notebook of story materials includes a short synopsis of various \nplots.

This’ll help later to determine who exactly was involved in a specific \nfiasco, how torunwithanongoingevolvingstory and what theplayersenjoyedmost. \nBe sure to jot down names, prominent actions and perhaps a few ideas for \nconsequences. In some cases, the players will come up with explanations for a plot \nthat are far off from what you had in mind, but they might be fun anyway. Don’t be \nafraid to run with those ideas in order to make the plot fit a good idea that you hear. \nCHARACT~RCREATI~N \nAlthough character creation occupies its own chapter, it’s a special task for the \nStoryteller as well. Some parts of character creation that seem downright simple can \nrequire aid from a Storyteller all too often. After all, a mage doesn’t drop into avacuum. \nWhat if your game already has enough Hermetics? What if the Storyteller is sick of \nseeing characters with Brawl x5? The venue style sheet should take care of many such \nconflicts, but sometimes it’s unavoidable. Someone could just make something up \nbecause he either doesn’t know better or hopes for special dispensation. \nIdeally, character creation should occupy time before or after a game. The \nStoryteller has too much to do during the game to get bogged down. A helpful \nNarrator can oversee the process, but it’s usually better to have the characters \nin advance specifically so that you can use them to feed subplots later. Also, as \nStoryteller you know best what you want from the game, what would be \nproblematic and what’s likely to find a good niche.

      "text": "G~AL+~.IENTED \nvs. ST~RY~~RIENTED \nPLAYERS \nWhile there are as many types of players as there are people, you’ll find that a \nlot of them easily divide into the following two simple categories for game purposes: \ngoal-oriented and story-oriented. Once you figure out which category describes your \nplayer, you’ll find it easier to accommodate the player’s way to enjoy the game. \nA goal-oriented player - \nwhich usually makes up about 80.90% of the \ngroup -relies on achievement and actual measurable steps. These players savor \nthe sense of accomplishment of overcoming adversaries, achieving new levels of \npower and gaining Traits or treasures. To them, the game may tell a story, but \nthey can win if they advance their agendas and improve their characters’ \nstrengths like a protagonist in a popular novel. You’ll satisfy these players if you \ngive them things to beat and chances to earn new Traits, better rotes and more \npowerful Backgrounds or items. Some see the game as an exercise not in \nstorytelling, but in numbers. For these people, the game is about tweaking the \nrules and running the other players (i.e., competitors) into the ground. These \nsorts don’t often cooperate well when you want to tell a story for everyone. \nHowever, goal-orientation isn’t all bad. It keeps the player moving forward, and \nit gives you concrete means to reward them or show success. \nA story-oriented player relishes the emotions and ideas evoked by the game. \nThese players don’t care if their characters die hideously, languish under a \nterrible curse or otherwise “lose.” Numbers and Traits aren’t as important as \ngetting on with the story itself. As in a tragedy where the protagonist dies, goes \ninsane or suffers some other horrible fate, the story-oriented player enjoys the \nconflicts, feelings and conundrums that face the character, not necessarily the \nprocess of beating them. These players often make easy prey for goal-oriented \nplayers, because the latter sometimes enjoy defeating other players and the story- \noriented players aren’t as focused upon Traits and ways to make the rules work \nto their advantage. However, having story-oriented players along helps build a \ncore of people who want a game experience, not just an exercise in engineering. \nMany players fall somewhere between the two extremes. Early game experiences \ne -from sports to board games -usually teach people to play in a goal-oriented mode, \nto score pints and overcome obstacles. Players with more background in theater and \nliterature may be more story-oriented. Ideally you’ll want to strike a balance. Goal- \noriented players help to advance the game and keep it moving, while story-oriented \nplayers provide a good response to the surroundings and play up the drama. \n. \n1 \n: TRAINING \nYem PLAYERS \nSo you’ve got a bunch of players, and you want to turn them into a troupe. \njrli \nDoing so takes some work, especially given the different game styles and the \n”’ introduction of players who don’t know how the game is played. How, then, do \nyou train your players to enjoy the game you’re running? \nTo some degree, you just have to be lucky and have good players. If one of your \n* \nplayers is hell-bent on running over all of the others in the MageMobile or he wants \nI * \nto design the ritual Effect that’ll kill all vampires everywhere, then he is probably \n* \n~ \nmissing the point of the storytelling experience. You can hope, you can wheedle and \n, \nyou can try to limit the player to less outrageous outbursts, but you may not be able \n’ . to change him. That’s just the way it is. If a player’s too problematic, then you need \n, *a to get rid of him before he damages the game for everyone else. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "However, you can do a little Pavlovian training to nudge your players in the right \ndirection. The roleplaying Experience Trait award is only one such bonus. Those who \nplay their characters well and take a few hits for the story receive a tangible benefit in \nterms of points. Enforcing consequences for actions is one of the most important things \nyou can do. A lot of things that are technically legal in the rules are just plain bad ideas. \nYou can enforce the social penalties of mages, by branding an offender or even having \npowerful mages show up to deal with a problem child. Don’t hesitate. This sort of \npunishment proves to agoal-oriented player that screwing around is a losing situation, \nwhile a story-oriented player will take this beating in stride and either shape up or drive \nthe character straight into self-destruction. \nRewarding story-crafting is a little harder. Try to cleave to the requirements \nthat add to story building. For instance, insist that players use their Traits to \ndescribe their actions narratively. Doing so isn’t just Storytelling by fiat, but it \nencourages the players to think about the appearance of what they’re doing and \nhow their characters do it. That’s why the Traits are there instead of just \nnumbers, after all. Similarly, if a player doesn’t pantomime or describe the \nactions of foci and casting an Effect, assign a slight penalty to the Arete test. \nObviously, the mage isn’t bothering to use his enlightened tools. \nMost importantly, talk with your players about what you want to accom- \nplish. Sometimes you’ll want to ask a player to bend a little for the good of the \nstory. Maybe a mage can kill someone, but he shouldn’t for the sake of the story. \nGood roleplaying doesn’t mean following an ironclad concept that straightjac- \nkets you into actions that throw the game. It means playing a role to a hilt that’s \nfun, and making sure that it’s equally fun for everyone else. \nNARRAT€BRS \nThe Narrators are the friends, confidants and co-conspirators of the \nStoryteller. While a Narrator usually doesn’t have as much say in plots and rules, \na Narrator does have the authority to moderate scenes, play special characters \nfor the plot and make judgment calls on the spot. The Narrator serves as a \nstopgap to address the fact that you can’t oversee the whole game at once and \nthat you’ll just need a helping hand from time to time. \nObviously there’s no real limit to your Narrating staff, except the number of \npeople you can recruit and trust. A Narrator takes on significant responsibilities, \nso he needs to be someone you’ll put stock in. Also, a Narrator needs a decent \nhandle on the rules, just to make sure that all ofher judgment calls and moderation \nflow smoothly. Beyond that, it’s upon you to decide on your Narrator staff. A good \nratio is one Narrator for every five to 10 players, but it will vary with your own \nenergy and the size of the game. In a game of 20 or fewer people in a small area, \nyou might oversee it yourself, while in a huge convention game, you might want \nNarrators who specifically administer and coordinate other Narrators. \nSince you’ll be so busy during the game, you should encourage your players \nto seek the help of Narrators. For small questions or scenes, a Narrator should do \njust fine. Of course, the Narrators can come to you if they have trouble, but that \nshould be a last resort. Make sure that your Narrators know what you want from \nthe game so that you don’t overrule them later. If you undermine their authority, \nthe players won’t go to them for moderation. In turn, don’t micromanage. Let the \nNarrators handle rule decisions and play out important roles. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Usually this \nisn’t too much to do. The Narrator just takes care of the interaction of Avatar and \nmage. Most of the time, this is a simple job of handling the whispers or urges that \nan Avatar may give to a mage. Rarely, the Avatar Guide will take on the role of \nan Avatar as it manifests in a dream (or even physically) to guide its patron. \nThe Avatar Guide’s most important role lies in Seekings. When you arrange a \nSeeking, be sure to have the Avatar Guide along. The Avatar Guide plays the role \nof the individual Avatar, pushing the mage to enlightenment and making demands. \nThis role is difficult, because the Avatar Guide must understand not only the \nAvatar’s Essence, but the mage’s background.

In such cases, \nyou rely on a Paradox Judge. \nThe Paradox Judge has the difficult job of coming up with Paradox \nBacklashes and events to respond to various magely workings. When a mage \ngains Paradox, it’s up to this Narrator to decide if the Paradox hangs and what \neffect it takes. The Paradox Judge might have a deck of Paradox cards, or you \nmight trust him to come up with results on the spur of the moment. The Paradox \nJudge should create or approve Paradox cards in any case, if you use them. \nEither way, this position is a difficult one. The Paradox Judge has the \nthankless task of inflicting hardship on characters, which always draws ire from \nthe players. Furthermore, players will tend to avoid magic specifically when they \nnotice the Paradox Judge around. For this reason, you should consider using \nwalkie-talkies or headsets to communicate, so that the Paradox Judge can make \njudgment calls from a distance. \n’ \n8 \nTHE \nSPINT \nKEEPER \nFor games with many spirits or lots of Umbral travel, you’ll need a Spirit Keeper. \nThis Narrator handles all matters spiritual, including keeping spirit Traits, tracking \nimportant recurringspirits, deciding onGauntlet 1evelsandclassifyingUmbralrealms. \nWhen a mage summons up a spirit, it’s up to the Spirit Keeper to play out \nI that role and make sure that the spirit is duly recorded for future notice.

If there are no consequences for \nnegative acts, then they’ll throw morality out the window and do as they please. \nOne reason that mages don’t take over the world is that there are far too \nmany influential Sleepers. Mundane institutions can counter a mage’s influence \nor make his life hellish. Simple solutions often lead to bigger problems. It’s not \nmerely a matter of evading the police or erasing a few memories. A mage who \nwants to effect long-term change must manipulate social institutions to cause \nthe growth of desirable factors. \nNote also that there’s always someone bigger. The reason that cabals don’t \nall run on bullies who beat other mages into submission is that such bullies aren’t \ntolerated. If a Disciple decides that other people will do as he says or else, then \nit’s likely that an Adept (or even a rare Master) will take exception to his \nattitude. Spirits may also frown on him and refuse to cooperate. If several other \nmages find out, they’ll probably brand and ostracize him, and if he’s ever actually \nkilled someone for refusing to follow his orders, then he may himself be killed. \nIt is the Storyteller’s job to represent this balancing force, period. \nPlayers who say, “Well, other players should take care of all this policing in \nplay,” are really saying, “I should be allowed to get away with whatever I want if \nthe other people can’t catch me or don’t build twinky Trait-maximized characters \nto stop me.” Just as you, the Storyteller, represent all of the other factors and \npersonalities of the World of Darkness, so too do you represent the forces of \nconsequences and the mighty powers that keep dangerously maverick elements in \nbalance. Sure, it’s desirable to have a self-policing player system, but that’s not \nalways possible. Don’t hesitate to enforce the balance necessary to play. \nPolicing of this sort applies to abuse of the Spheres too. For instance, if a \nplayer insists that he can use ritual Correspondence to extend the range of his \nmagic and locate and kill every target he wants in the city, remind him gently \nthat other Adepts and Masters of Correspondence will surely notice such a feat. \nPoint out that they will probably intervene to discover what’s happening after \na few such castings. In some cases, the character will discover to his dismay that \nhis great plan is a threat to other, mightier mages, who show up to turn his magic \nawry or use his own methods against him. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Each \ngame has a distinct theme and story angle, so they’re not meant to be mixed \ntogether so much. Generally, one should take the fore, and if other supernatural \ncreatures show up, they’re subplots and subordinate angles to the keystone game. \nBut some people want to run crossover games anyway. \nAs this writer has said before, you can do so if you want. You can also beat \nyour game to death with a stick. \nThere’s a lot of fun to be had in mixing the elements of the World of Darkness. \nAcknowledging the existence of other supernatural creatures makes for a more \nperilous game and a more precarious existence, especially since nobody knows \nwho’s right and who’s wrong. It can also make your game a mess because different \nrules have different scales, power systems and the like. There’s not any way to make \na “complete book of crossovers,” because there’s already so much going on in each \nseparate game that it’s nigh-impossible to cover every combination. \nSo, if you do decide to add multiple game elements together, it’s on your \nhead. However, you can do a few things to minimize problems. First, and it may \nseem obvious, make sure that your power scales are the same. For instance, if you \nuse old rules from Laws of the Hunt, you’ll discover that the power scales and \nhealth scales are different. Your people will be far too fragile unless you use the \ncompressed scale (p. 119) for everyone. Second, watch out for Super Friends \nsyndrome. Within five minutes of sticking two venues together, some enterpris- \ning group will come up with a way for the two to have some sort of truce or peace \ntreaty. You should be sure to enforce the reasons why various groups don’t get \nalong. The Master mage betrays the vampires or the elder werewolf punishes the \nyoung upstarts who have the gall to treat defilers of holy sites as buddies. \nDon’t hesitate to step in directly. Third, consider having Narrators who \nspecialize in each rule set. You may have a Narrator who knows vampires \nbackward and forward, but who doesn’t quite grasp the intricacies of the Spheres. \nHave the vampire players come to that Narrator for questions, and have all of \nthe crossover problems come to you. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Because of the strength of their Union, Technocrats can access high levels \nof Backgrounds and get their hands on advanced scientific equipment. In recent \nyears, Technocrats have hunted Tradition mages with their terrifying coordina- \ntion and deductive skills, in order to exterminate them or reprogram them. \nIn addition to Technocratic operatives, the Union employs a small number \nof high-tech constructs such as cyborgs or bioengineered creatures.

Indeed, it’s even \npossible for a normal mage to become a Marauder, although nobody truly \nunderstands the circumstances that might cause such a change. A Marauder \nmight seem like a totally normal and competent magician, only to reveal his \ninsanity a day later. Some Marauders slide through multiple personalities and \nmagical styles, while a few are stable and rational, and they would like nothing \nmore than to be free of the chaotic weirdness that their broken Avatars subject \nthem to. Some are completely unable to deal coherently with the real world, and \nthey retreat to the Umbra instead. \nA Marauder may have all the powers of a typical mage, and it’s rumored that \nthere may even be Marauder Oracles. However, every Marauder exists more or \nless in a permanent state of Quiet (see p. 174), and every Marauder has a \npermanent Quiet rating that reflects how deeply afflicted he is. What makes \nMarauders dangerous and powerful is the fact that they ignore any Paradox \nTraits they should accumulate from any magic use up to the level of their Quiet \nrating. For instance, a Marauder with a permanent Quiet of one ignores the first \nTrait of Paradox from any and every Effect he creates. Marauders with a \npermanent Quiet rating over five retreat to the Umbra, to represent the fact that \nthey have become incapable of dealing coherently with the real world. \nNEPHANDI \nThe dark mirror of Ascension is the dream of the Nephandi. Each Nephandus is a \nmage who perverts his Avatar and soul (if the two are truly sepamte things) in a sacrifice \nto dark powers. In return, the mage becomes an agent of primordial destructive forces. \nFew foes terrify and galvanize mages as much as the Nephandi. In the past, \nTechnocrats and Traditionalists have even worked side-by-side to fight Nephandi \nmenaces. The Nephandi not only wield strange perversions of the Spheres \n(called Qlipphothic magic), but they give up their senses of conventional \nmorality and Ascension in order to serve the whims of great, malevolent entities \nthat predate mankind. Perhaps foremost on many a mage’s thoughts, though, is \nthe realization that any mage can Fall and take the dark path of the Nephandi. \nFor their part, experienced Nephandi entice nake or embittered mages with \npromises of great power and a unity of vision with all who have Fallen before. Of \ncourse their way is right, they claim. They follow the wisdom of creatures that were \nancient before mankind even existed. Ofcourse the cosmos should end. All things \nmust, and it’s only natural that the Nephandi serve as agents to nurse it at its \nbedside until its demise. Of course there’s nothing wrong with demons and utter \ndarkness and death. They’ve all been around forever, so they must be part of the \nright and proper cycle of existence. Of course the Nephandi have everyone’s real \nand true best interests at heart, even if nobody realizes it. \nThe Nephandi come in many grades.

Such tempters may be subtle enough to escape \nnotice for generations. Even if they are caught, they may simply vanish into the deeps \nof the Umbra for a time, only to re-emerge later when they will not be recognized. \nFortunately for humanity, Nephandi are both few in number and rare on \nEarth. The most common Earth-bound Nephandi are self-destructive, and they \ntend to bum themselves out quickly, taking as much as possible with them. The \nremainder usually resides out in twisted Umbral Realms or even in the deeps of \nthe Underworld, where they can ponder the mysteries of destruction and \nentropy or spread their malevolent influence subtly to other willworkers. \nNephandi serve a variety of dark overlords, and they draw their powers from \nthis servitude. Some Nephandi receive infernal taints that function as Paradox- \nfree capabilities equivalent to a single rote. In order to use these powers the \nNephandus must usually fulfill some pact, such as sacrificing 12 innocents at every \nnew moon. Others answer directly to the slumbering primordial things that hail \nfrom the very creation of the universe. These Nephandi use Qlipphothic versions \nof the regular Spheres.

A sorcerer has 6/4/3 Attribute Traits, 3 Ability Traits and 3 Back- \ngrounds, plus 7 Free Traits and 5 levels of various magical Paths.

Mages know better, however. Such creatures did and do exist, \nalthough they are rarer now in the modern age than in their ancient heyday. Because \nthey have long since vanished from Earth to reside in far.off Realms or hidden \ncomers of the world where nobody visits, these beasts are commonly called Bygones. \nWhile vampires, shapeshifters and similar creatures remain hidden among the \nmasses of humanity (perhaps because they so strongly resemble humans), Bygones \nfind the stifling weight of reality disorienting and disabling. Many wither and die \nunder the combined fdrces of Paradox and Unbelief. Still, a mage might summon \nsuch a creature from the depths of the Umbra for a limited time. Such conjurations \nare difficult to perform, but they can certainly throw an adversary for a loop. \nBygones come in as many forms as there are legends that spawned them, and \na Bygone can have whatever Traits someone might expect of it. There are \nunicorns with horns that heal by touch, dragons that breathe gouts of flame, \ngriffins that fly and sphinxes that whisper mysterious riddles. A sphinx might \nhave strong Attributes and a great deal of the Enigmas Ability, while a dragon's \nmagic and skills would best all but the most heroic ofhumans.

Although no \nchurch condones these zealots’ behavior officially, small splinter factions of \nvarious religious groups receive covert funding and training specifically to destroy \n“heretics.” For most Inquisitors, the prime targets are vampires, demons and other \ncreatures of darkness. Some, however, consider magic to be evil, or they take \numbrage at the beliefs of groups like the Celestial Chorus and Akashic Brother- \nhood. Inquisitors range from fresh-faced young priests to hardened mercenaries. \nAll carry weapons supplied by their church orders when they go on the hunt, and \na few are even full-time professionals. Most disturbingly, a disproportionate \nnumber of Inquisitors display True Faith and its concomitant resistance to magic. \nThe most scholarly hunters make up a secretive organization known as the \nArcanum, which is dedicated to the collection of occult knowledge. Quite a few \nArcanum scholars are also sorcerers, although there have been no Arcanum \nmembers to date who are also Traditionalists. The Arcanum rarely seems directly \ndangerous. Members catalog and classify information, and they may even be \ninclined to trade useful information with mages. However, many have strong \nopinions on how magic should work, and they may cause problems for mages who \ndon’t adhere to those opinions. Thankfully, Arcanum members are charged only \nto watch, not to interfere, so they almost never pose a physical threat. \nIn various government agencies, the Technocracy has fostered special project \ngroups to deal with supernatural occurrences. Such groups come under a great deal \nof scrutiny, but they also gather quite a bit of backing as long as they’re in favor. \nOne ritual murder or camera-caught vulgar display of magic can mobilize the FBI’s \nSpecial Affairs Division rapidly, and it can bring to bear all the weight of anational \ngovernment. A few government hunter agencies such as Japan’s Strike Force Zero \neven bring minor cybernetics or cutting-edge weapons to bear when they hunt. \nThese government-sponsored hunters often have inaccurate information, but \nthis can make them all the more dangerous. An agent who believes that all mages \nhave some sort of mystical defense shield is likely to employ very heavy force. \nLastly, a new class of hunters has recently risen to prominence. Since the \n‘1 \nbeginning of the Avatar Storm and the events of the Reckoning, some humans \nhave displayed heretofore unknown supernatural powers and abilities to hunt ‘ \ndown other beings. Some mages argued at first that these humans were untrained \nOrphans or humans who had been possessed by spirits. Time, however, has \nshown that these Imbued hunters have a specific range of capabilities, as if some \nforce had suddenly chosen all of them deliberately for a mission of hunting. \nThe Imbued usually have the power to see through illusions and recognize \nsupernatural beings for what they are.

The willworkers often protect or advance humanity, whether out of \naltruism or self-interest. Conversely, vampires must feed from humans, and they \nencourage stasis so as to keep the world familiar. The two lifestyles aren't \nirreconcilable, but they are usually at odds. Most mages quickly recognize vampires \nfor the bloodsucking predators they are and avoid them. Vampires often see mages \nas dangerously powerful and either stay away or try to manipulate them. \nA vampire survives by feeding on the blood of the living. Some rare ones \nsubsist on animal blood, but human prey is more substantive. The vampire must \noften indulge in all manner of monstrosity to feed this hunger. Since a vampire \nis an ambulatory corpse, though, it derives no pleasure or sustenance from food, \nsex or the like. Only blood and the intellectual satisfactions of social maneuver- \ning and vendettas give the undead any gratification. Emotion and hope die when \nth\"e vampire becomes what it is, and all that's left is a paranoid predator that fears \nits own kind or its death at the hands of humans. \nHowever, most vampires still seek out peers to fill their otherwise hollow \nexistence. As a result, they often come across as sensual, charismatic or charming, \nbut this appearance is only a thin veneer. Scratch the surface and only a monster \nlies beneath. A few vampires try to hang on to their human consciences, but the \nuhcontrollable hungers to which they are heir cause this humanity to drop away \nwith the years. The eldest vampires are little more than amoral cannibals. \nVampires are most important to mages because of the historical Massasa \nWar and the fact that one early House of the Order of Hermes turned to \nvampirism during the Dark Ages. What happened to the mages of this House \nremains shrouded in mystery, however, because the newly undead magicians hid \nthemselves among the society of the vampires. A century of warfare between the \nOrder and that betrayer House resulted only in many casualties on both sides, \nleaving mages with little understanding of how vampirism actually works.

The vampire takes this blood by biting mortals (which causes a sort of \nsupernatural ecstasy so that the subject doesn’t resist) and drinking their blood. \nA Blood Trait can be used to activate a vampire power, to gain a Physical Trait \nfor a scene or to heal a health level of non-aggravated damage. \nSince they’re essentially nothing more than dead bodies, bashing damage has \nlittle effect on vampires. Furthermore, vampires suffer only bashing damage from \nbullets. They heal two health levelsofbashing damage withone BlccdTrait. Vampires \ndon’t age, and theyrarely sufferfromdiseaseorpoison.

Some can command \nothers or influence emotions, much like they’re using a Mind Effect. Others can grow \nclawsor call upon phenomenal strength, as if they had used aLife Effect. Assign a young \nvampire three rotes; each rote costs one Blood Trait to use. Vampires don’t understand \nor have access to the Spheres, though. Their powers stem from their cursed blood. \nIf a wooden stake penetrates a vampire’s heart, the unfortunate monster \nis paralyzed. An attacker can try to stake the vampire deliberately with a \nsharpened chunk of wood or a spear by winning or tying two Simple Tests after \na hit. If the attacker succeeds on both tests, the vampire cannot move or use its \npowers until the offending weapon is removed. \nVampires cannot function during the day. Sunlight burns them, and the \narrival of the day itself makes them extremely drowsy. As a general rule, vampires \nsleep all day unless they find themselves under extreme duress. If they are \nexposed to sunlight, the vampire takes an aggravated level of damage every turn. \nVampires can turn human beings into their servitors. A vampire simply \nfeeds a living human a bit of its blood, which grants the person some of the \nvampire’s power as well. These subjects are called ghouls, and they are usually \nfanatically loyal to their masters. Anyone who drinks the blood of a specific \nvampire three times finds himself mystically compelled to love that creature. A \nghoul can refresh its Strength-based Physical Traits once per day at no cost, and \nit doesn’t age as long as it receives vampire blood once per month. \nSince a vampire is a corpse, any spell designed to alter its Pattern must \ninclude Matter as well as Life. \nTHE \nCHANGING \nBREEDS \nBe they stories of the loup-garou of Europe, the nine-tailed foxes of Japan or the \ncoyote shifters of Native America, tales of men who change into animals (or vice- \nversa) are ubiquitous throughout the world. In the World of Darkness, such creatures \nlive among humanity and animals alike. They are children of nature and students \nof spirit, but they are also warriors with fearsome animal prowess and predatory \ninstincts. They are dangerously wild creatures that protect the dwindling natural \nspaces fervently and possess myriad powers that they inherited from spirits. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "Mages know little of the shapeshifters, since dealing with them often proves \ndangerous. Many shapeshifters consider mages to be arrogant and treacherous, and \nthey attack as soon as they identify a willworker. Even those inclined to speak rather \nthan do battle tend to treat mages with great suspicion. For their part, the mages with \nthe most contact withshapeshifters are those who work outside the cities. Verbena and \nDreamspeakers in particular have long-standing ties with the shifters, and those mages \nwho travel the Umbra mention that shapeshifters go into the spirit worlds as well. \nShapeshifters appear to have their own sub-culture, even though many of \nthem coexist with humans. Many seem to venerate the forces of nature \nreligiously and practice some form of shamanism or ancestor-worship. Natural \nspirits do communicate with the shifters and treat them favorably. Shapeshifters \noften have both human and animal relatives. Apparently, their families extend \ninto both groups, and some shapeshifters clearly stem more from an animal \nheritage than from a human one. (Those who do have difficulties with human \nlanguages, and they have a hard time understanding and using technology.) \nTnemostknowledgeableDreamspkerslndicatethat \nalthoughtherarewerewolves \nseem to predominate among shapeshifters, other types of animal shifters also exist, \nincludingwildcats, coyotesandravens. Regardless of its breed, eachshapeshiftercan take \non several forms ranging from human to animal to mixed forms in-between, and they all \nhave various gifts that mimic the Charms of spirits. In their hybrid forms, they temfy \nnormal humans, and they have phenomenal battle capabilities. \nMages who stumble accidentally into the wrong parts of the wilderness may \nrun afoul of hostile shapeshifters. The shifters protect their territory religiously, \nand they consider their holy sites too sacred for normal humans to profane with \ntheir presence. The shifters venerate these natural Nodes, and drive out any \nmages who would seek their power. \nSee Laws of the Wild for more complete information regarding shapeshifters. \nFor your games, you can assume the following: \nA shapeshifter has three forms: A human form, an animal form and a \nhybrid battle-form. In battle form, the shifter doubles its normal human Physical \n, Traits. In animal form, the creature has superhuman senses that are equivalent \nto the enhanced perceptions of Apprentice-level Life magic. Changing forms \nrequires one turn. In its battle form, the shifter terrifies normal humans. People \nflee automatically, and they try to blank out or forget about the experience. \nShapeshifters heal rapidly. A shifter heals one health level of non-aggravated \ndamage every single turn. However, silver causes aggravated damage to them. \nA shapeshlfter can move quickly enough to take two actions per turn in combat. \nA shifter can use various spiritual Gifts to perform magical feats. Give \neach shifter the equivalent of any three Apprentice-, Initiate- or Disciple-level \nrotes. Older shifters, or those who are shamans and students of the occult, will \nhave more. Gnosis, the shifter’s spiritual wisdom, powers these Gifts. Young \nshifters may have one to three Gnosis Traits; old, wise shifters have up to 10. \nShapeshifters can step physically into the Umbra by spending a turn \n’ ‘ \n~ \nlooking into a reflective surface. They can then peek back out by concentrating, \nI ’ and they may step out of any reflective surface back to the material world. They \n’ e don’t suffer from the effects of the Avatar Storm when they cross the Gauntlet, \nI ’* but they don’t often go to the same Umbral places that mages frequent. \n~ \n~ \n‘ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "Since shapeshifters are creatures of spirit rather than just animals and \nhumans, any magic that would alter ashifter’s Pattern must use Spirit as well as Life. \nTHE \nRESTLESS \nD m  \nEuthanatos have long known that the cycle of life doesn’t always let go of \na soul easily. Even since before Orpheus’ legendary journey into the Under- \nworld, people have seen ghosts and haunts, venerated their ancestors and dwelt \non the questions of existence after death. Mages know that life after death is not \njust speculation - \nin the World of Darkness, it’s often a fact. \nNot every person who dies becomes a ghost, but for those with great passion, a need \nto complete something or an overwhelming drive to survive, death may not be an end. \nThese wraiths inhabit the Underworld or Dark Umbra, a spiritual place of death and \ndecay. They pursue their leftover ambitions there, often looking in on the mortal world \nor sometimes even seeking a new lease on the life they left behind. Attached by need to \noldplacesorpeople, thesehauntingmemoriessometimes intersectwithlost pasions and \noccasionally even manifest to experience a moment of life-indeath. \nPlaces like graveyards and abandoned old houses tend to attract ghosts, \nbecause the Gauntlet between living and dead is difficult to cross. Few ghosts \nhave the power to manifest in the physical world, so they often hang around in \nplaces where death is strong and the barriers are thin. The Reckoning has blown \ngreat spiritual storms across the Underworld, and places of sanctuary are rare. \nNow, wraiths congregate in the few safe havens left for their kind. \nOld ghosts often retreat into the depths of the deadlands where they find \nislands of memory, places that never were and storms that rage over a dark ocean \nof death. A mage might traipse into these lands once or twice, but traveling the \npaths of the dead is a heroically foolish journey that is fraught with peril. Perhaps \nthe dead are best left to their own devices.. . . Certainly the mages who deal with \nthem often commonly learn to regret it. \nFor more information about wraiths, see Oblivion. For your games, you can \nassume the following: \nWraiths are typically immaterial. They exist in the Dark Umbra, which \nreflects the memories of the material world in a dead, decaying state, and it hides \nothers beyond. Wraiths usually can’t touch the material world without effort, \nbut they are also immune to most physical attacks. \nA wraith‘s power stems from Pathos, the emotional strength of its \nmemories. Wraiths are drawn to events that mirror their strongest desires, and \nthey gain Pathos from them. \nWraiths can perform tricks in the material world such as creating sudden \nchills, making walls drip blood, creating haunting voices, possessing living beings \nand even materializing briefly. Performing these tricks requires the use of a Pathos \nTrait, and they function similar to Mind possession or hallucination Effects. \nEven if a wraith is damaged with Spirit magic or physical attacks while it \nis materialized, it can only be banished at most. Only aggravated damage (say, \nfrom spiritual fire or Prime-based attacks) will destroy a wraith permanently. \nOtherwise, the ghost may be banished for a month, but it will return eventually. \nWraiths have Traits and health levels like other characters, although they \nusually can’t use their Physical Traits except against each other or against mages \n1 ‘r’: \nI \n1, \nI’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "foolish enough to enter the Dark Umbra. A wraith suffers no penalties for injury, \nand it can heal one level of non-aggravated damage with a Pathos Trait. \nSince they’re ghosts, wraiths can only be affected by magic that includes \nSpirit, unless they manifest physically or the mage goes to the Underworld. \nTHE FAE \nModern fairy tales tell about shining knights and floating castles, faerie \nprincesses and wicked goblins. However, older stories of the Fair Folk make them \nout to be creatures that play malicious games with humanity, steal away children \nand devour them or ruin crops and kingdoms for their own entertainment. As \nit happens, the latter tales are closer to the truth. Although the days of faerie \nkingdoms are long gone, much like the ancient times of powerful magician-lords \nand philosopher-kings, some remnants of the fae remain behind. Clothed in \nhuman flesh, and given only vague hints as to their true nature, these mortal \ndescendants of the fae are called changelings. \nChangelings resemble humans upon casual inspection. Indeed, they’re indis- \ntinguishable from most people. It’s the presence of the faerie soul that makes the \ndifference. To others of its kind, a changeling’s true faerie nature -be \nit a blue- \nskinned troll, a gorgeous noble or a twisted monster that lurks in shadow - \nis \napparent. Indeed, changelings seem to carry with them a whole host of imaginary, \ndream-like creations, from invisible pets to intangible swords that only they can see. \nMost changelings seem content to exist in their fantasy world and balance \nit with the needs of their normal human lives. They sponsor endeavors of art, \ncreativity and imagination, because dreams fuel and fire them. Changelings \noften exhibit a host of natural powers or magical illusions that are related to \ntrickery, travel and illusion. \nMages find changelings a difficult lot to deal with. While the two groups are \nnot inherently hostile toward one another, the changelings are protected by a \nphenomenon known as the Mists. Those who experience faerie enchantments \ntend to forget them later, which has given rise to the stories of people who have \nbeen captured by changelings and who disappeared for 10 years, only to return \nunaged with little more than hazy memories of a few nights’ revels. Even mages \nare subject to this phenomenon. A mage who is enchanted to experience the \nmass-dream of changelings often forgets much of it once the enchantment ends. \nOnly those with the presence of mind to write down their experiences have a \nchance at remembering and deciphering the strange ways of the fae. \nSee The Shining Host for more about changelings. For now, you can assume: \nA changeling seems perfectly normal and human, but it actually has a \ndream-like faerie form that only those who have been enchanted with fae power \nor who are using highly specialized magic can perceive. This “fae seeming” shows \nthe changeling’s true nature. \nChangelings crave Glamour, the energy of raw imagination, creativity \nand wonder. This energy flows freely from artists and craftsmen, so many \nchangelings frequently patronize them. \nA changeling usually has several faerie powers relating to illusions, befuddling \nthe senses or moving about quickly. Treat these powers as Disciple-level Mind or \nCorrespondence Effects. Each use of such a power costs one Glamour Trait. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "Changelings have Traits and health just like regular human beings. However, \ntheir dream-weapns inflict a sort of imaginary damage on one another that is just as \neffective on other changelings as real weapons are on normal humans. Normal people \ncan neither see nor feel such imaginary weapons, but a changeling who is “killed” by \nsuch a weapon falls into a coma and forgets that he is actually a changeling. \nCold iron - \nraw, unalloyed, unworked iron - \ninflicts extreme pain and \naggravated wounds on a changeling. If a changeling is killed by a cold iron \nweapon (often, a crudely worked and ugly thing, that lacks any Glamour), his \nsoul is snuffed forever. \nIn some circumstances, changelings can actually step into imaginary \ndream-worlds, and disappear from the material world. Doing so isn’t exactly the \nsame as entering the Umbra, and changelings who “walk the Dreaming” are \ndifficult to follow. They can take paths to many places and to many fantastic \nimaginary locations, though. \nA changeling suffers when exposed to boredom, stark rationality and the \nabsence of creative, imaginative energy. Technocrats in particular cause this \npain to the fae, but excessively regimented, boring, static individuals of any sort \ncan do so as well. \nChangelings can use Glamour to enchant someone briefly, causing that \nperson to see the fae dreamworld and true forms. To do so, the changeling must \nspend a Trait of Glamour and either touch the intended victim or give the person \na gift. The person experiences the changeling world for a scene or hour. At the end __ \nof this time, the Mists wipe away memories, leaving only hazy recollections. \nE \nChangelings protect special strongholds called freeholds where they can \nstep into fantasy spaces that adjoin locations in the real world. They collect \nnatural Glamour in freeholds, and they do not age while they remain inside. \nWorking magic on changelings is pretty much like working magic on humans, \nunless the mage wants to affect the imaginary changeling world. Doing so requires \nMind and Spirit as well. Plus, most mages will never be able to study changelings well \nenough to figure out a way to affect the dreamworld because of the Mists. \n‘, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Those \nAkashics have always had short tempers and a brutal left hook, he thought wryly. No \nsense pushing his buttons just yet. \n“What’s the agenda?” David asked Florence casually. \n“Well, like I said before, matters have gotten quite ... strange, re- \ncently. Dead rising from their graves. Ghostly lights in the church towers. \nChildren spotting fey shapes among the trees of the park and weird email \nmessages without senders cropping up all over the town’s computer provid- \ners. You know, the usual supernatural activity. Just lots of it, all at once.” \nTieman sneered but smoothed the expression over before the others \nnoticed. “It’s nothing that any of us haven’t seen before. I’m not some wet- \nbehind-the-ears Apprentice who’s awed by the sight of a faerie ring, you know. \nI’ve been doing this for-” \n“We know,” David cut him off quietly. “The better part of a millennium. \nAfter all, you bring it up all the time.” \nTieman glowered for a moment then said, “Fine. So we have some of the \nusual unusual going on. So what?” \nFlorence wagged her finger like a lecturing professor. “The fact that these \nthings are happening all at once is what’s so odd. And of course the fact that \nlevels of etheric power - pardon, Quintessential energy - have spiked \nnoticeably almost everywhere in the city, combined with that odd woman you \nyourself spotted at that club you frequent.. . it’s a little too much to be simple. \nSomething is going on.” \n“But the question is, what?” Tieman murmured. \n“AS always,” David interjected. “But we can at least think of possibilities.” \n“Such as?” \nDavid shrugged. “A planetary alignment. A probability storm. A release or \ncancellation of a long-term enchantment. A drop in Technocratic suppression. \nSunspots. Any number of things.” \nTieman re-appraised David, then nodded once. “All right. Any number of \nthings. Your problem is twofold then. One, why should I care? And assuming I \ndid, how would we know what to look for?” \nFlorence spoke up this time. She fidgeted with her goggles again as she \nreplied, “You should care because this impacts the supernatural world that you \nclaim to be so in touch with. Remember, if children are seeing faeries in the trees, \nthat’s something that most Verbena should find quite exciting.” \nTiernan looked about ready to gag. “Because we’re Gaelic-lilting \nfaerie friends?” he sneered. “Faeries aren’t all nice and pretty cartoon \ncharacters, Florence. They get as ugly as nature does. And if faeries are \ngetting so close to children that children can see them, that doesn’t excite \nme at all. It’s disturbing.” \n“Of course,” David said smoothly. “All the more reason for us to get \ninvolved before these matters get out of control. As much as you may like \nhaving the supernatural at your beck and call, it’s too dangerous when it’s \njust loose in the world.” \nL \n1 \n% 1, * *’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n“Besides, it’s a chance to learn something,” Florence added. “And, if you \ncare, it’s a chance to show up some other mages out there. Getting things \ndone attracts notice. We may not be in the Order of Hermes, and we may not \nhave to worry about their cutthroat politics, but even you must concede that \nthe more we know and the more we take matters into our hands, the more \ncredibility we’ll gain with our fellows. You know what that means - \nmore \noffers to swap information, more chances to get involved in policy, more \nchances to show up your rivals or just another good kick for your ego to say \nyou’ve done something important. This is a fascinating opportunity any way \nyou look at it.” \nTieman mused at David’s rather blunt observation and Florence’s com- \nments, then gave a short bark of laughter. “The stick and the carrot - \ngood \ncop bad cop. I see why you two work together.” Florence and David glanced \nat one another, then David just shrugged again. “All right,” Tiernan said, \n“Let’s say I’m in.” \n“Good,” Florence chirped. “I figure we should check out these various \nmanifestations around the city for true signs of paranormal activity. I can track \nthem with my etheric sensors; I’m sure you both have your own methods.” \nDavid nodded once, and Tiernan produced a length of dark red cord from \nhis coat pocket. “Oh yes,” Tieman said, twisting the cord between his fingers. \n“We have our ways. I’m sure I’ll stumble across something. Shall we meet back \ntogether here in, say, four hours?” \n6;= \n“Four hours,” David agreed. “Let’s get started.” \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCREDITS \nAuthors: Mike Boaz, Jess Heinig and Peter Woodworth \nAdditional Material: Jedediah Walls, Wade Jones, Martin Hackleman \nDevelopment: Jess Heinig \nEditing: Carl Bowen \nArt Direction: Aaron Voss \nInterior Art: Laura Robles \nFront and Back Cover Design: Pauline Benney \nLayout and Typesetting: Pauline Benney \nPlaytesters: Charles Bailey, Bruce Baugh, Deird’re Brooks, Daron Gildaw, \nHeather Pritchett and the Camarilla Fan Club rules development team. \nSPECIAL \nTHANKS \nTCB: \nCharles “Corrupter Wyrm” Bailey, for bringing the teeming masses to Atlanta. \nWhite Wolf Publishing, Inc.

We painted cave \nwalls, pressed reeds into soft clay tablets, inked papyrus and vellum, performed \nplays, illuminated manuscripts, printed books, filmed movies, scripted radio and , , ! \ntelevision shows and programmed computers. Now, one of the newest methods 2 .  \nof storytelling is actually a return to the oldest form. Live-action roleplaying \n(LARP), which grew out of the tabletop roleplaying games of the  OS, is just the \nkind of participatory tale telling that we can still recognize among cultures \naround the globe. It relies on character and story just like the myths of our most \nancient cultures, the same emphasis that led to the creation of what we call \nstorytelling games. \nPI- \n'? \n. \n,.I \nWHAT \nIS Ifirm's Ere THEATW? \nThis game is probably different from any game you have played before.

Laws of Ascension \nThis game has more in common with childhood games of adventure than with \ntion you need in order to go forth into worlds of imagination. You create the \naction, and you choose your own paths. We have a name for this style of game. \nWe call it Mind's Eye Theatre. \n.. _I \nL T J  -.\" ,\nThinkabout sittingaroundafire tellingghoststoriesorreading talesofKing ; ,E;, \n.\nArthur on a rainy night or just swapping fanciful ideas with a few friends.

Some assistants (the Narrators) help set \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthe stage, work up the special effects or take on the roles of other important \ncharacters who impact the story but who aren’t necessarily central to it. Each \nparticipant in the drama has a specific persona. Everyone participates by acting \nwithin the character-role they’ve set for themselves, and the story unfolds \nthrough their drives, ambitions, failings and flaws. \nIn Mind’s Eye Theatre, you can explore unlimited worlds. In Laws of \nAscension, you discover the fading majesty of the mages’ world, where willworkers \nof all kinds struggle to keep magic alive in the face of a world that simply doesn’t care \nfor it anymore. The drivensouls struggle to bring enlightenment to a population that \nclings desperately to mediocrity. The battle for reality can take place anywhere, \nanytime, be it in dank back alleys, posh skyscrapers, the savage wilderness, unex- \nplored worlds or even within a mage’s own mind. As the mystics say, once you step \nonto the path, you can’t turn back. No matter where it takes you. \nCHARACT€RS \nWhen you play Laws of Ascension, you take on the persona of a mage, a \nmodern mystic with the power to bend reality to her will and change the world \naround her in amazing ways. Your character can be anyone from any walk of life. \nThe only limits on your character concept are your imagination and a few \nflexible Ales. You create a character, then act out the pursuit of her goals \nthroughout the course of a story. You decide what your character does and says. \nYou decide what risks to accept or decline. \nDuring the game, you speak as your character: Unless you’re talking to a \nNarrator or Storyteller, whatever you say is what your character says. Because most \nof what a Mind’s Eye Theatre player perceives depends on the characters around \nhim, players must be vivid and expressive. The characters direct the plot, but the \nevents of the game guide and develop the characters at the same time, helping \nthem to achieve the story’s goals. As a player in a storytelling game, you have a \nresponsibility beyond simply portraying your character. You need to consider the \nstory as a whole and your role in making sure that other players enjoy the game. \nTogether, you weave a tale that’s entertaining for everyone. \nCreating a character for Laws of Ascension is rather straightforward, \nalthough you should work with a Storyteller to flesh out your mage. Magicians \nare flexible, dynamic people, so naturally you should make sure that your mage \nfits into the game. You need to do only a few things to define a basic character, \nand once you’ve done so, you can play the game. If you take a little time with a \nStoryteller, you can define a lot of your mage’s mystic potential and options in \nadvance, which allows you more freedom during the game itself. \nYour character should be more than just a series of Traits and numbers, \nthough. Rather, she should be a living, breathing personality with a past, \nmotives, drives, likes, dislikes - \neverything you want to see from a character in \na movie or a novel. You also need to take the time to figure out who your \ncharacter is as well as what she is before you start playing. While certain details \nand personality traits will come out while you’re playing her, you’ll want to have \nthe basics in place already. \nCharacters are the heart and soul of a story. Without them, all the patient \n‘ . efforts of the Storyteller are for naught. Appreciate the Storyteller’s efforts by \nib. \n3 \n‘ 1 \nfollowing the rules and taking an active part in the game. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe basic premise of Laws of Ascension derives from the tabletop \nroleplaying game Mage: The Ascension. It is not necessary to read or play Mag \nNARRATCBRS \nInLaws of Ascension and other Mind's Eye Theatre games, Narrators are \nthe people who help the Storyteller present adventures. Narrators are the \nimpartial judges who describe scenes and events that are difficult or dangerous \nto act out. They adjudicate rules and play the roles of antagonists occasionally. \nGenerally, enlisting the aid of one Narrator for every five or 10 players makes for \na good ratio. Narrators usually play characters of their own as well, so that they \ncan guide the action directly instead of just trying to tinker with it from the \noutside. The best number of Narrators for your game usually depends how \nexperienced your players are at live-action roleplaying. \nYour Laws of Ascension troupe may employ Narrators who oversee certain \nspecific areas of the game. These Narrators - \nsuch as the Paradox Judge or the \nAvatar Guide - \nserve a dedicated function, taking care of potential difficulties \nwith one specific aspect of the rules. Chapter Six: Storytelling describes some of \nthese specialized Narrator responsibilities in greater detail. \nSTCBRYT~LL~R \nEvery game of Laws of Ascension that you play must have a Storyteller to \nserve as the ultimate authority and final judge. The Storyteller creates the basic \nelements of the plot and makes sure that the story unfolds well, in addition to \ndoing everything the Narrators do. Storytelling is a demanding job, but it is also \na very rewarding one. \nThe Storyteller makes certain that the story has content, interesting hooks \nand a narrative flow. A Storyteller should not just sit back and dictate the plot, \nthough. Characters who don't have free will are no fun to play. Instead, a \nStoryteller creates the framework elements of the plot, then turns players loose \nto see what happens. \nDuring the game, the Storyteller must be watchful and ready to create new \nelements to make sure that the story works out well. He is also responsible for \nensuring that all of the players have something to do and that everyone is abiding \nby the rules. Although performing all of these tasks simultaneously can be \nexhausting, the sense of accomplishment you get from creating a successful story , \nmakes the whole process worthwhile. \nSee Chapter Six for detailed information about the role of the Storyteller \nand how to set up your own games. \nPRCBPS \nProps include any item that helps define your character or the action of the i ,! \n: \n:% \nI, 1 \n.)

You can play Laws \nof Ascension in the home, at conventions or at other safe locations. However, \nELWLY \nSI~PLE \nThis game was designed to be easy to learn and easier to play. Laws of \nAscension is a storytelling game. The rules are aimed at resolving conflicts \nquickly so that players can continue the story without ever stepping outside their \ncharacters. We have made every effort to create rules that maintain the integrity \nof the story and the background in which the story is set. \n’ \nTHE \n@NLY RULES \nTHAT ITIATTER \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nIT’S QNLY A G\n~\nE\n \nThis rule is the most important one by far. If a character is killed, if a plot \nfalls apart or if a rival wins the day, it’s still only a game. If you take things too \nseriously, you’ll spoil not only your fun but everyone else’s around you as well. \nFor that matter, so what if tragedies befall your character? Remember, the hero \nmay not always win, but that doesn’t mean the story isn’t entertaining. You can \nrelish the setbacks as well as the victories. \nLeave the game behind when it ends. Playing Laws of Ascension is a lot of \nfun. Spending time talking about the game is great. However, calling the person \nwho plays the Chantry head at 4:13 AM on Sunday to discuss an idea your \ncharacter has for a new rote is another matter entirely. Keep a little perspective. \nNCB TCBUCHING \nNever actually have physical contact with other players, no matter how \ncareful you are or how innocent you believe the gesture is. Accidents can \nhappen, intentions can be misinterpreted, and someone might get hurt. Rely on \nthe rules to cover physical logistics. \nN e  STUNTS \nNever climb, jump, run, leap or swing from anything during a game. Keep the \nreal-world action in your action-packed game low-key. If you can imagine that \nyou’re a staff-twirling mystic who can bend reality on a whim, you can imagine that \nyou’re leaping over fences and running from pursuers as well. Avoid attracting the \nattention of people who aren’t playing, and use your imagination to its fullest. \nNCB WWCBNS \nFake or real weapons of any sort are absolutely forbidden. Even obviously \nsilly toy weapons are not allowed, just for safety’s sake. Such props give other \npeople the wrong impression about what you’re doing, and they could conceiv- \nably be mistaken for the real thing in the dark. Use item cards to represent \nweapons instead, no matter how cool you think it would be to wear a model of \nyour Etherite’s new Antimatter Discombobulater Ray Gun on your belt. \nNe DRUGS CBR DRINKING \nThis rule is a real no-brainer. Drugs and alcohol do not inspire peak \nperformance at any activity. They hamper your ability to think and react \nquickly, and at the very least, they screw up your roleplaying ability. Players \nimpaired by drugs or alcohol are a danger to other players and to the game as a \nwhole. Nothing is wrong with playing a character who’s drunk or stoned, but \nactually bringing illicit substances and paraphernalia to a game is in bad taste at \nbest and illegal at worst. Don’t do it. \n& ~ I N W U L  w @THEM \nRemember, not everyone you see, or who sees you, is playing the game. A \ngame can be unnerving or even frightening to passersby. Be considerate of \nnonplayers in your vicinity, and make sure that your game-play actions are not \nI \ngoing to alarm anyone if you are in a public area. Trying to explain to a policeman 5 \nthat you didn’t really conduct a Satanic ritual on your friend - \nyour wizard just \nperformed the rite of Gilgul on his shaman - \nis often an exercise in futility. \n~ r, \nI \n,. \n1 1  * *’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nIn addition to the standard set of basic rules, Laws of Ascension includes \na number of optional rules that are intended to facilitate more evocative game- \nplay, cut down on the need for differing house rules and otherwise help customize \nthe complicated world of magic for individual troupes. However, you should feel \nfree to ignore or adjust any of the rules in this book if doing so will make your \ngame better. We at White Wolf call this tenet the Golden Rule. If some rule \nincluded in this book doesn't work for your troupe, change it. If your troupe finds \na way to handle the Avatar Storm that works better for you than the one in this \nbook, go for it. The idea is to have fun. Just be consistent and stand by your \ndecision. Nobody likes rules that change every week. \n' \nThe object ofLaws of Ascension is not to win or make sure that your mage \nThis book presents quite a few optional rules to help you portray more accurately \nthe complex worlds and powers that mages are heir to, as well as to accommodate the \nneeds of eachhws of Ascension troupe. For example, when it comes to covering the \nincredible diversity of results that can be generated by magical Effects alone, rules have \nto be designed that will work for large groups of people who know each other casually \nor not at all. Those same rules can be overly restrictive, though, when you apply them \na to smaller troupes in which the players know each other fairly well. However, building \n* \nto relearn the system every time they try out a new game. Faced with such a daunting \nobstacle, what's a helpful game company to do? \nAs it turns out, the answer lies somewhere in between. The majority of this \nbook gives Storytellers a baseline system that will allow them to run Laws of \n- Ascension games with any number of players, even if they have no prior gaming \nexperience with each other or just in general. These foundational rules are \n' somewhat more restrictive, by necessity. In large games, players need clear, \nconcrete ways to adjudicate power conflicts fairly without having to call on \nNarrators at every turn or rely solely on the judgment of other people they don't \nI \nHowever, the optional rules included throughout this book allow you to add \nE \nextra layers of complexity and flexibility that aren't feasible in larger games. They \nalso help portray the true fluidity of the Mage: The Ascension tabletop experi- \n*: \nence. If you have enough Narrators to allow players to make up new Effects on the \nfly without stopping play every five minutes, by all means, institute that rule. If \n: \nm \n2- \n, \n1\n1\n4\n.\n \nI *  \n1 \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nyour players know each other well enough that they trust the others to make fair \ndecisions on which Effects are vulgar or coincidental, let them. In this manner, the \noptional rules not only help build games that reflect the true power of magic more \nclosely, but they encourage a higher level of player trust and overall cooperation \nas well. Just make sure to tell players which of the optional rules are in effect. \nUltimately, the optional rules are universal house rules. Consider them \nyour official suggestions and shortcuts on how to custom-fit games to the troupes \nplaying them in a way that will still remain consistent with other Laws of \nAscension games. Use them or pass them up, as you will. This system allows you \nto come to the table with a player and tell him immediately what rules you do \nand don't use, instead of having pages and pages of customized rules for your \ngame. In this way, players changing from game to game already have an idea of \nTHE W~IUD \net= DARKNESS \nAt face value, the World of Darkness is not terribly different from our own \nworld. Cities bustle with traffic, and the wilderness teems with life. The same \nveneer roils an atmosphere of fear, despair and violence that's far more \npervasive than any that exists in our own world. The World of Darkness isn't \njust our world with white face paint and black clothing. It's our world through \nthe darkest looking glass of the soul. Monsters aren't just rejects from our dimly \npoor work themselves to death and scrabble to find enough food to eat. The pain \nof living and the ruthlessness it takes to succeed forge people into callous lumps \nof iron, and looking out for number one is the whole of existence. \nIn turn, many citizens of the World of Darkness have adopted the Punk ethic in \norder to give their lives meaning.

Some are the scientists who chart new frontiers \nand make life safer and easier for everyone. Others are madmen and visionaries \nwho push the boundaries of convention. Be they warlocks, witches, sorcerers, \nsages, Sufis, sensei or bards, mages have always populated the pages of history and \nfantasy. In the World of Darkness, mages have had all these roles and more, and \nthey continue to have them in the modern day. While some might contend that \nmagicians are all demon-worshippers or crazed mystics, the real mages have an \nawareness that transcends everyday thought. Each mage is human, true, but he \nis a human touched by destiny and Awakened to a wider world. \nA great many half-truths and falsehoods surround the myths of mages. Some \nare based in history, some were once true but are true no longer. Others were \nsimply paranoid folk tales from the start. The following list lays some of the most \ncommon misconceptions about the workers of magic to rest. \nMages must use formulae to cast their spells. False. Although mages can \nand do rely on certain rituals to perform magic, most devise their spells from their \nownexperiences. With the right knowledge, mages can even create spells on the \nspot for specific needs. \nMages pass on magical abilities in their own families. False. Mages \nAwaken to the power of magic regardless of genetic heritage. However, some \nmages inherit unique characteristics through family curses or boons. \nMages consort with demons and infernal powers to gain their magic. \nFalse.. . usually. A mage's power stems from the belief, will and enlightenment \nwithin. However, a belief in the power of the infernal can lead a mage to work \nMages cannot be hurt by mortal weapons. False. Just as mages are human, \nthey can be hurt and killed like any other human. However, they can use their \nmagic to defend themselves. \n- his magic through the auspices of demons and other corrupt spirits. \nthat derive from emotional intent or desire are called Resonance. Blatant side effects \n4 resulting from powerful magic used carelessly are called Paradox Backlashes. \nA mage can hurl lightning and fire, cause earthquakes and fly through \nMages cannot perform magic in a church or against someone protected \nby the cross. False. Magic works regardless of the influence of religion. Indeed, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nMagic and technology are mutually exclusive. False. Reliance on technol- \nogy and science is just another form of belief, so it works as well as a faith in magic. \nIn fact, many mages use advanced technological foci to perform their Effects. \nMages seek power and enlightenment. True. The quest for magic is \nultimately a journey of internal exploration. Those who survive learn and grow \nmore powerful. Eventually, mages hope to surpass the limits of this universe and \nachieve a higher state of being through the process called Ascension. \nTHE \nAWAKENING \nThe process that sets a mage apart from the average person is called the \nAwakening. For some mages, the Awakening is a gradual process that leads \nultimately to anew level of awareness. For others, it's the result of some horrible \ntrauma or shock. Once a human Awakens, though, there's no turning back. That \nperson is a mage, and with the Awakening comes the realization that the \nindividual can change the world, for better or for worse. How the new mage acts \nupon this knowledge depends on the individual. \nDuring the Awakening, a prospective mage may experience sudden visions, \ndreams, hysterical emotion or surges of magical power. Strange phenomena may \nsurround the neophyte as his magical power rages unchecked, reshaping the world \naccording tohisdesire. Somemagesdescribemeetingspirits, speaking toangelsor even \nseeing the true form of their souls. Others are tormented by demons or visions from the \npast. A few have no unusual experiences other than a sudden change of paradigm. \nStill, the mage eventually settles into his power, and he must learn to \nchannel it, lest he be consumed by it. All that the Awakening does is show the \nnew mage that he can change the world; it does not show him the practices that \nmake such changes possible. Some mages go insane from the force of the \nexperience. Others try to deny their newfound abilities, only to find themselves \nthrust into strange circumstances beyond their control. Many mages discover \ntheir destiny or evidence of past lives and deeds as a result of Awakening. \nUltimately, the mage comes to recognize that not only can he reshape the \nuniverse, he can recast himself. The exploration of magic is a process of change. With \nenough enlightenment and skill, the mage can become something more and better \nthan human through a mythical process called Ascension. However, that road is long, \ntrying and treacherous for a newly Awakened magician living in these desperate times. \nTHE TRADITI~NS \nGone are the days of wizards who hurled fire and battled dragons. Lost are the \nmystics who saw through the veil of time and death. Only shadows of those powerful \nmagicians exist today, and they band together in a group called the Traditions. \nThe Traditions formed during the early Renaissance as a body of mystics \nwho gathered from around the world. A new reliance on science and reason had \nshaken the very foundations of magic. Mythical creatures were becoming \nextinct, and magical energy was growing scarce. In the face of this desperate \nsituation, nine of the largest groups of magicians came together and pledged to \nstand for the practice of magic. Today, the Traditions uphold secret magical \ntechniques and spread their wisdom to the select few who will listen. \nThe Traditions claim all manner of mysticism and unconventional \npractice as their bailiwick, although their membership can be exclusionary. \nMages who are not trained in their techniques are shunned and sometimes \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\neven hunted as competing influences. Nevertheless, the Traditions do usually \nstand heroically as mages of many and varied stripes who hope to make a real \ndifference and return a sense of the magical to the world at large. The modern \nTraditions are the Akashic Brotherhood, the Celestial Chorus, the Cult of \nEcstasy, the Dreamspeakers, the Euthanatos, the Order of Hermes, the Sons \nof Ether, the Verbena and the Virtual Adepts. In spite of their differences they \nusually work together for common good. \nHistorically, the Traditions have been very authoritarian. Elderly mages \npass on their secrets to eager Apprentices, but they also hold sway over policy \nas a result of their influence and knowledge. Of course, ancient wizards arguing \nover hundred-year-old squabbles often caused the Traditions to suffer from a \nlack of direction. Many Tradition mages simply weren’t in touch with the \nmodem world, and they longed for bygone days of magic. Modem disasters and \ncrises among mystics have seen to it that few potent Archmages remain. In \ntoday’s Traditions, the leaders are the up-and-coming mages who can figure out \nmagic for themselves and take a positive direction and stand. \nAs a body, the Traditions make formal pronouncements about policies and \nset down judgments that are theoretically binding to all members. The Tradi- \ntions decide among themselves how to allocate magical resources and how best \nto pursue their goal of saving the world’s dying magic. A Tradition Council, \nnominally made up of a representative from each Tradition, generally discusses \nplans and votes on all proceedings. Missives both magical and mundane then \ntake the results far and wide to Tradition mages across the world and beyond. \nIndividual cabals of mages enforce these policies as they see fit, but few would \nbuck the combined weight of the Council. In addition to the formidable skills \nof its members, the Council can call upon mages from around the world to make \nits will known. Those mages who bring great harm to the Traditions or to \nSleepers may face severe consequences, ranging from ostracism to branding of \nthe offender’s soul to the permanent destruction of the mage’s mystical power. \nThe greatest threat facing the Traditions now is the weight of their own \nimpending extinction. Humanity chose reason over mysticism several hundred \nyears ago, and magic has been disappearing from the world ever since. Now, \npeople have grown so complacent that most individuals can’t even be bothered \nto forge directions for their own lives and make responsible choices for them- \nselves. The Traditions want to alter this momentum, but they’re fighting a losing \nbattle. With their own magical resources tapped, the Traditions can only hope \nto influence society subtly in hopes of catching a few people here and there and \n2 : causing them to experience a wider world. To this end, the Traditions move \n+ about secretly looking for people who might have the potential to become \n* powerful new mages. \nMages who hope to advance in the Traditions do so through a combination \nof political gamesmanship and magical skill. Each individual Tradition teaches \nits own form of magic, which can take a lifetime to master. The skilled mage must \n‘ *  learn to channel those powers, but also to see eye-to-eye with his counterparts \n’ and contemporaries in other Traditions. The mage must juggle the demands of \nhis mundane life with the politics of Tradition mages who vie for scarce magical \nresources, specialized training or choice treasures. And, above it all, the hope of \nI )  ,” eventual Ascension glimmers. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTHE TKHNWRACT \nThe Technocracy is the chief adversary of the Traditions and (some would \nsay) the architect of the modem world. This collection of mage-scientists hails also \nfrom the Renaissance, but the order itself has a decidedly different inception. \nVisionaries who dreamt of a safe, stable, classifiable world came together at a great \nconvocation to draft articlesof their own secret society, an organization that would \npromote and disseminate the most sublime rational insights ever achieved. Few \nrealized that this vaunted science and technology was just as visionary and world- \nchanging as magic. Indeed, every Enlightened scientist of the Technocracy was \nand is a mage whose belief empowers his phenomenal science. \nThroughout the Renaissance, the nascent Order of Reason hunted down \nand exterminated supernatural threats to humanity and helped to build an \norderly society upon principles that anyone could learn and use. The way this \nOrder-turned-Technocracy turned out, though, is far from the original intent. \nThe modem Technocracy influences and infiltrates high technology institu- \ntions and government organizations all over the world, in hopes of quashing the \nunexplainable, providing the simple sustenance of life to the common man and \neventually seeking a world of complete order. \nThe Technocracy exerts a hidden but pervasive influence on many levels \nof humanity. Technocratic inventions are disseminated throughout the world \nto become accepted as normal. The Technocracy's greatest strength is the \nuniversal usefulness of its inventions to the common man, which guarantees the \nsupport of average people. Various groups in the organization watch over \nhumanity and make adjustments to affect economics, scientific development \nand social progress. They weed out undesirable traits and encourage useful \nqualities in specimens from among the Masses, although the definition of such \ntraits depends on who within the Technocracy asks. \nFor the better part of several centuries, the Technocracy turned its resources \ntoward wiping out mages, and Technocrat agents are still deadly enemies today. \nThe scientists consider unclassifiable magic a danger to humanity, and they work \nto subvert or even kill Traditionalists. However, the Technocracy also spends an \ninordinate amount of time and resources policing the world. Technocrats have a \nplan to reshape the world for the better, but doing so means involving themselves \nin politics, social and religious movements, global economies and other high- \ninvestment projects. Considering all these responsibilities, the Technocracy has \nits hands full enough. Throw in a world that's far stranger than the scientists want \nto admit, and it's clear that the Technocracy just can't do everything it wants. Still, \nthis daunting load has not yet broken the Technocracy's back. Some Technocrats \nare real heroes who champion medicine, advanced communications and other \nmodem conveniences that make life safer and better. The Technocracy will \nshepherd the world down a safe, static, predictable path, regardless of the cost. \nDISPARATES \nAND @RPHANS \nSince as many forms of magical practice exist as there are magicians, not all mages \nfall easily into step with the Traditions or the Technocracy. Disparate mages cling to \na Craft or organized magical subculture, rather than join any particular Tradition. \nOrphans, on the other hand, Awaken and discover their magical potential without a \nmentor, and they must learn magic through their own hard experience. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDisparates are actually fairly common among mages, although not every \nmage really knows one. The individual cultures that cling to magical beliefs still \nshield mages who arise from those cultures. Religious crusaders, djinni-summoners, \ncandomble practitioners and more thrive in their isolated enclaves and hand \ndown their magical practices. By far, the most prevalent of the Disparates are the \nHollow Ones. This loose affiliation of nihilistic mages sometimes aids the \nTraditions, but most of the individuals thumb their noses at the very idea of a \n\"magical organization.\" Instead, most Hollow Ones spend more time observing \nthe decay and death of the modern world with morbid fascination. \nOrphans come from all walks of life. Sadly, mages aren't always around to \nteach and shepherd the newly Awakened. While some such abandoned mages \ngo mad or destroy themselves, others develop their own eclectic magical \nmethodologies. An Orphan might pick up a book on New Age occultism and \ndecide that it must have something useful. Of course, an Orphan could theoreti- \ncally build his magic on any number of foundations - \neven deleterious \nprinciples like human sacrifices and maltheism - \nso more properly schooled \nmages are quite leery of these unknown quantities. Often, Orphans must keep \ntheir heads down since both Tradition mages and Technocrats consider them \ndangerous mavericks with uncontrolled powers. \nS@RCEMRS AND SERWCBFG \nSince even before the Dark Ages, mages haven't worked alone. Sure, mages \nlike to claim credit for great human innovations and discoveries, but the fact is \nthat while mages may blaze new paths for humanity, it's up to everyone else to \nfollow. Miracle workers can't do everything alone, so many surround themselves \nwith ranks of assistants, acolytes, confederates and hangers-on. \nIn fact, mages aren't the only people who do magic! True, the Awakening \nshatters perceptions and turns someone irrevocably into a mage, but some \ndetermined occultists unearth resonating truths or powers without ever Awak- \nening. These sorcerers can stand with the Traditions or Technocracy, or they \ncan simply go their own way. Their powers are not as flexible as those of \nAwakened mages, though, for the sorcerers don't have the skill to reshape the \nuniverse at whim. Nevertheless, few magicians would deride them. Anyone who \ncan perform magic is a beacon of hope in this stark modem age. \nDealing with magic is dangerous even for mages, and it is even more so for \nthe few sorcerers who have the opportunity to do the same. Many of the great \nBygone beasts of earlier ages and the spirits in other worlds are inimical to \nhumanity and dangerous. Charms or spells gone awry can strike low their casters, \nnot to mention the defenseless Sleepers nearby. However, a few un-Awakened \n^d people still stand with mages for the taste of power or the chance to live and work \nwith a magician. Some even do so simply out of love, ambition or hope. Those \nassistants are called consors, acolytes or simply friends and companions. Some- \ntimes, those with no talent for magic can learn about the ins and outs of theory, \nI the requirements for casting spells and the sheer wonder of the magical world. \n* \n- THE ITkmm~ \nITJAGE \nThe 2 1st century hides many pitfalls on the mage's path. The Technocracy \nhas suppressed the history of magic and enforced a sterile, rational order over the \nworld. Mages must hide among the Sleepers and avoid notice, lest their \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSupernatural capabilities draw undesired attention. The days of world-shaking \nspells, in which monsters and arcane treasures were commonplace, have passed \nby. The few mages who dare to continue their work find that magic itself is a \nsputtering, dying force that grows increasingly more difficult to invoke. \nAnd yet, the disappearance of Earth‘s magical Masters has given birth to a \ntime in which every individual mage can make a difference according to her own \ndrives. Instead of a hierarchy of elite wizards or brooding magicians who are out \nof touch with the everyday world, a collection of dynamic young individuals \nleads the Traditions now. If the cost for magic IS great, these new leaders claim, \nthen the rewards can be incalculable. A mage has literally the entire cosmos to \nplay in, if only she has the dedication. \nWhere will mages be tomorrow? Mages once hoped to restore the mythic \nages in the modem day, but such a rebirth seems a distant dream now. There will \nbe no great and global Ascension. No Ascension War will determine how \neveryone Awakens. Rather, the time has come for individuals to make a \ndifference. Humanity may have chosen mediocrity and a world of lazy comforts, \nbut individual mages can strive for something better and inspire other people. \nFor every person who is dissatisfied with the banalities of modem life, an \nopportunity arises to spread mysticism once again. \nYet the threat of Armageddon still looms .... \nOld legends and prophecies tell that the world will end after a terrible war or \na conflagration takes its toll. Recently, a great Reckoning has come to pass, and \nit has resulted in the destruction of the most powerful Tradition and Technocracy \nstrongholds. What’s worse, a vicious storm rages in the spirit worlds, making \npassage there a harrowing and perilous undertaking. If these events truly herald \nArmageddon, as those old legends and prophecies foretell, then the fighting over \npetty politics will avail nothing, and the true measure of greatness will be in those \nmages who leave their mark on the world before it ends or is reborn. \n; \nLEXICCBN \nJust as mages use special techniques to describe how they do magic, so too \nhave they created their own vocabulary to cover the experiences that are unique . \nto their society. \nc@lTIlTI@N \nPARLANCE \nin its power. \nnection to the Tellurian. \nAcolyte: A servitor of amage who does not perform magic, but who believes \nArete (AIR-uh-tay): A mage’s level of mystical understanding and con- , \nAscension: The mythical state of enlightenment beyond human comprehension. ‘ \nAscension War, The: The conflict to determine whether the world would \nArcane: An unconscious “cloaking” effect that some mages possess, which \nAvatar: A shard of spirit energy, tied to the human soul, perhaps from the I ’ \nAwakened, The: Blanket term for supernatural entities, including mages. ’ :’;, \n# s  \n1 \nembrace magic, science or faith. \nrenders them immune to scrutiny. \nPure Ones of the long-ago universe.

These Traditions \ntrain willworkers in a variety of techniques handed down from mentor to student \nin unbroken spans of history. Each Tradition has its own heart and culture, but \ntogether they span the world in hopes of protecting and promoting magic. \nWhether standing against the Technocracy or working for mundane causes, the \nTraditions promote the welfare of mages everywhere by sharing resources, \ncodifying magical phenomena and trading knowledge. \nHISTCBRY \nWhen they hear the tales of ancient plots and wars fought, many Initiates find \nit hard to think of a time before the Traditions existed. However, the idea of the \nTraditions and the Council of Nine is a relatively new invention that dates back to \nthe beginning of the Renaissance. During the Mythic Ages, when magic operated \nin full view of the masses and there was no Paradox to fear, most mages had little in \ncommon with each other. Outside of the Order of Hemes in Europe and some \nscattered groups in China, India and northern Africa, mages kept largely to \nthemselves, learning where they could and uniting under no common cause. \nYet, as the influence of the Order of Reason grew, the Order of Hemes in Europe \nfirst attempted to bring all the wizards it encountered under its banner. The Order of \nHermes assimilated those wizards its mages encountered whose styles and beliefs differed \nfrom the Order's own paradigm. In the Cnent, emissaries of the Akashic Brotherhood \ntraveled across several auntries and took in myriad religious beliefs, while proselytizing \na greater goal of human advancement, Other groups, such as the Celestial Chorus, took \nnascent form withi other supernatural communities as ideas spread to like-minded \nmages. Each group tried to expand and include other magicians under its banner. \nWhen these efforts failed-mages have always beenaproud, stubborn lot, and \nthey do not take kindly to being catalogued by outsiders- the Order shifted instead \nto recognizing formal groupings of wizards outside of itself. It then asked that those \ngroups organize and elect representatives to serve on a grand council of wizards. Seers \nof Chronos (who would later become the Cult of Ecstasy) brought predictions of a \ngrand alliance and the reclusive Ahl-i-Batin worked to bring emissaries to the table \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nfrom groups around the world. When some of the groups that the Order contacted \nargued that styles and beliefs varied widely among their own camps (notably those \nthat would become the Verbena and the Dreamspeakers), the Order responded that \nit was not a single specific set of beliefs they were looking to recognize. Rather, a \ngeneral “tradition” of magical practice, such as spirit-calling or shapeshifting, would \nsuit the Order’s needs just fine. Thus came the recognized term Tradition, for even \nif two mages disagreed over the actual points of their group’s orthodoxy, they could \nstill be counted as part of the same loose magical tradition. \nNine seats were made available on the Council, representing the nine divisions \nor Spheres of magic that the Traditions eventually agreed upon. One mage from the \nTradition that showed the greatest facility for that Sphere held each seat at any given \ntime. Operating from a Chantry named Horizon, the members of the Council \nformulated Tradition strategies, worked to smooth relations between members of \nradically different ideologies and otherwise ensure that the Traditions worked toward \nenlightenment harmoniously. Naturally enough, these lofty goals were sometimes \novershadowed by politics, power struggles and other moments of blindness, but the \nCouncil endured even during the worst of times. It continued to offer guidance and \nhope to those mages who fought to bring magic back to the lives of the Sleepers. \n” \n~~BTECTIVES \nOneofthefirstordersofbusinessforthecoUncilofNinewas \nto formulateanoverall \nplan, not simply for the battle against the Order of Reason, but for all Tradition mages \nand hopefully even humanity itself one day. Some called it hopelessly idealistic and \nunrealistic, saying that it proposed the impossible, but the Council knew the importance \nof having a dream to reach for that was greater than any one mage or even than the \nCouncil itself. Although time has since altered the way Tradition mages interpret some \nof these ideals, and although each Tradition has its own take on how and when these \nideals apply, the principles that the Council formulated have remained the Same for \n8gi \nhundreds of years. The most common presentations of the Council’s goals are as follows: \nASCENSICBN \nWhile every Tradition has its own vision of this lofty goal, pursuing Ascension has \nbeen the Council’s staunchest position since its foundation. It remains so even now in \ntheafiermathofthe AscensionWar.Simplyput, allmagesshouldbefieeandencouraged \nto pursue Ascension-provided that they are not serving the Nephandi, the Marauders \northeTechnocraticUnionbydoingso,ofcourse.TheAscensionofth~factionswould \nresult in the destruction or strangulation of the cosmos, so their pursuit of Ascension \ncannot be allowed to continue. However, interfering with another Tradition mage’s \nsincere efforts to gain enlightenment is not only disrespectful, it also helps strengthen \nstatic reality and make magic harder for everyone. By working toward Ascension, the \nmage keeps hope for the future alive and ensures that even a tiny part of reality will not \nbow to conformity. Initially the Traditions promoted an idea of global Ascension, in \nwhichall humanity wouldbeuplified to anew levelof awareness. However, many mages \nhavesinceshiftedtheir focus tothe ideaof individual Ascension, hopinginstead topursue \npersonal truths and encouraging others to do the same. \nAlthough every Tradition’s design for them is ddferent, all Traditions are united in \ntheiragreementthattheConsensusdepenclsonSleepers \ntogive itpwer.Evennow, with \nreality slidq toward the hopelessly static, the only real hope for the Traditions lies not \ninincrediblefeatsofmagic, butratherinswayingtheheartsandmindsofthemassesback \n“\nI\n \n, I \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nto their cause. To that end, mages educate Sleepers as often as possible, Awaken them \nwhen they can and protect them at all costs, despite the Sleepers’ ignorance of the truth \nof reality. Without Sleepers who are willing to question static reality and search for \nsomething better, all magic would cease to be, and that cannot be permitted to happn. \nWith the Awakening comes the potential to cause a great amount of harm and \ndestruction. Some willworkers begm to fancy themselves above the law, doing what they \nwillandusingtheirpowerstoescaperetribution. \nInmagesociety, thekindsofpowersthat \ncanbecalledoninevenaminor conflict necessitate some otherway ofhearing grievances \nand settling disputes. To make sure that both extremes of justice were covered, the \nCouncil ofNine created asystemof crimes and applicable punishments that all members \nof the Traditions recognize. (For the specifics of thii system, see “Tradition Justice’’ in \nChapter Five, page 2 15 .) Mages found guilty of these offenses can expect to be punished \nin accordance with these rules regardless of where they are or who is judging them. \nLikewise, particularly serious and/ or recalcitrant offenders can expect to find a group of \nexperienced and anm mages hot on their trail before long, even in these dark days. \nTUSTICE \n&SECT \nWith the categorization of the Spheres came the concurrent need to find \nsome way of comparing the relative status of different mages. Mages of different \nTraditions needed to know how to address each other properly and have some \ngeneral idea of the level of progress other wizards had made along the path to \nenlightenment. While some Traditions use different titles, and others use none at \nall save when addressing outsiders, the system has made it possible for mages of \ndiffering backgrounds to gauge eachother’s experience and temper their reactions \naccordingly. This system is still in use, even in the wake of the recent flight of many \n! of the more enlightened mages. (For the titles and game mechanics inherent to \nthis system, see “Reputation” in the Rules, Systems and Drama Chapter, page 213.) \nWhile bringing enlightenment to all is a noble goal, the reality is that not \neveryone is ready to Awaken, and many consider even the slightest hint of the \nsupernatural extremely dangerous. The witch-buming fires of the Inquisition stand as \ntestament to the frightening power of the masses to eliminate what they do not \nunderstand. Therefore, the Council created what is known as the Rule of Shade, a \ngeneral prohibition against exposing the workings of magic to the world in a form that \nthe world is not ready to accept. Revealing one’s m e  nature to those outside magical \nsociety or performing especially vulgar magic in public is forbidden, since such acts \nthreaten to start the Inquisition anew and alert the Technocracy to the presence of \nTradition mages in the area. While slips of some kind are inevitable, the mage must \n,” do his best to repair the damage he’s caused. Clever acts of magic are certainly \npermissible since they help chip away at the facade of static reality, but the Paradox \ngenerated by proud and foolish acts usually fiy the mages who perform them, making \nthe sacrifices pointless. If a mage is to survive, he must be subtle, discreet and careful. \nDespite the Traditions’ noble formative goals, time has altered and eroded \n, \nmany Tradition strengths and agendas. On one hand, many founders and \n’ e supporters of the Traditions no longer exist. Even mages must succumb to age \n, \neventually, and the Council has been around for hundreds of years. On the other \n! me hand, the increasingly static and rational world has made some goals difficult or \nRULE w SHADE \nCURR~~“T~FFAIRS \n‘ (I t: ! \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nimpossible to achieve. Modem Tradition mages must deal with the realities of \ntheir situation. No godlike Master is going to save the Traditions and magic itself \nfrom extinction; it's up to Earth's survivors to see to that themselves. \nOf course, the situation isn't all bad. The disappearance of the oldest \nMasters has opened up new possibilities for Initiates and Disciples of the modern \nera. While magical training may be difficult, no crazed wizards with 200-year- \nold grudges are guiding the Traditions in pursuit of personal vendettas, and no \nrestrictions exist on what mages can study. Enforcement of many Tradition rules \nis lax because every mage makes a contribution in some form and is just too \nvaluable to alienate or harm. Tradition mages swap ideas and goals with a \nboundless fervor that surpasses any of the cooperative efforts of earlier ages. \nFRACTURED \nUNITY \nRecent events have shattered the former strength of the Council of Nine, \nleaving most mages without a solid sense of leadership as the fires of the Ascension \nWar die down and the ceaseless monotony of static reality begins to set in. Prompted \nby the agitation of a rabble-rousing mage long believed dead, a number of young \nwizards attacked Horizon Chantry from within, sparking a tremendous magical \nbattle that destroyed the entire Realm and left dozens of the most powerful members \nof the Traditions dead or missing. Efforts to contact the missing have proved fruitless, \nand many Disciples and lower-ranking mages have been left to fend for themselves \nin the increasingly dangerous reality of Earth. Some noble mages have stepped in to \ntry to fill the posts now deserted. Others have forsaken the notion of Tradition unity \naltogether, turning their attentions toward their own interest and closing their eyes \nto the dream of Ascension that was once the birthright of all Tradition members. \nAll hope is not lost yet, however. Indeed, some groups have become more \ninternally cohesive than ever. After all, the harshness of circumstance is a better \nmotivation for cooperation than any more lofty ideals could ever be.

Indeed, while some other Traditions see \nAscension as a personal matter or as an elite understanding, the Chorus sees its \nrole instead as that of the shepherd, protecting the Sleepers from wicked forces \nlike the Nephandi and the Technocracy and guiding all humanity to Ascension. \nReligion has obviously been the most important force in the history of the \nChorus, and its roots go back to the beginning of civilization itself. \nIn its time, the Tradition has embraced all faiths that seek to understand \ntheir proper relation to creation, a fact that still burns some of the more \nconservative members. This diversity has been both a curse and a blessing for \nthe Chorus over time. In some eras, the Chorus became a truly unifying \nforce, embracing all faiths. In others, it became dogmatic and insular, even \nwarring internally over the nature of the one “true” religion. All Initiates \nt learn of the role of the Chorus on both sides of the Crusades and the \nInquisition, for example, and they are cautioned not to become so caught up \nin their individual devotions that they forget the Song of harmony that \nexists in all things. \nOf course, the other Traditions have not forgotten the role the Chorus \nplayed in various tragedies of the past, and the decline in religious obser- \nvance in general over the past several centuries has further undercut the \n* Chorus’ sway with them. The Chorus’ early ties to the Order of Reason \n(especially the branch that became the New World Order) don’t help either. \nDespite the growing number of non-Christian members of the Chorus, they \nare often lumped under the banner of Catholicism and treated with a \n_i \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nFortunately enough, the turn of the millen- \nnia nonetheless ushered in a swell of belief in \nthe tenets of the Chorus, among both Sleepers \nand the Awakened.

The previous strict 1 \nhierarchy has been shaken up, and \nnew, idealistic members ofmany faiths \nhave a chance to really make a dif- 1 \nference without being bogged down \nin protocols and procedure.

In addition, while a number of Choristers are \npriests or other invested members of their chosen faith, the majority are still \nlay members.

It is the province \nof the Cult of Ecstasy to take these private vices and push them to the forefront \nof discussion, to tear away the taboos that surround such practices and to force \nsociety to face the wisdom to be gained from them. The Cult originated in \nIndia as the seers of Chronos then spread quickly across the world, adapting \nto the cultures it encountered and their ideas about experience and transcen- \ndence. Wherever Cultists went, they shook up established ideas and challenged \nlong-accepted dogmas. Even for mages, the Cultists have always been trail- \nblazers and innovators, and while conventional morality frowns on some of \nthe more base practices, no one can argue that they haven’t been a dynamic \nforce in magic. \nToday, the Cult considers itself nothing if not constantly changing, and \nit embraces gladly just about any practice its members come across if that \npractice proves to be another key to the door of enlightenment. This process \nis best expressed in the Code of Ananda, a series of proverbs that are as close \nto sacred as anything the Cult will admit to. The Cultists preach joy, \ncompassion, pure emotion and respect for the passions of others in order to \nguide young Cultists along the path to enlightenment and learn to under- \nstand the views of others. \nWhile the majority of Cultists are and have always been remarkably \nresponsible individuals who respect themselves and the desires of others around \nthem, one cannot espouse the kind of extreme beliefs and visionary ideas that \nthese mystics do without attracting negative attention from those with less \nencompassing perspectives. In addition, the Cult has had to struggle with the \nskeletons of addiction, overdose and burnout throughout its existence as \nmembers get caught up in the tools of their craft instead of its ends. What’s more, \ntheir mastery of Time magic is often as much of a curse as it is a blessing. Seeing \nhow a relationship will end on one’s first date or witnessing a murder that took \nplace a century ago on the site of a current residence puts a great strain on normal \nlife relations, to say the least. \nDuring the rise of the Technocracy and the ebb of the Mythic Ages, many \nother mages considered the Cult more interested in fleeting pleasures and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nvague prophecies than fighting the grow- \ning Ascension War. They claimed that \nthe Cultists ignored the more subtle \neffects that their revolutionary ideals \nwere having on the strict cultural \nsystems around the world. The \nother Traditions failed to under- \nstand that while Cultists will \nfight with all their souls for the \ncauses they believe in, they sel- \ndom find much wisdom in \nirect confrontations. Instead, \nCultists prefer to alter the very \nviewpoint of their opponent to some- \nthing more pleasing instead. Adead body \ncannot hope to reach Ascension, after \nall. When they do choose to fight, how- \never, the Cultists can be some of the \nmost effective and unnerving foes in \nexistence, as their mastery of the time- \nstream allows them to react to tactics \nwith uncanny accuracy or even pre- \nempt their enemies entirely. \nNowadays, it would seem that the \nunabashed hedonism of many societal \nsubcultures (especially youth-oriented \nones) would fall right into the Cult’s \ndesigns, but such is not quite the case. \nWhile they appreciate and encourage \nthe elimination of many of the old ta- \nboos and other empty social restrictions \nthat these lifestyles endorse, they are \ntroubled by the heavy dependence on \nchemical escape and the rising philo- \nsophical nihilism that seems to \naccompany most of these scenes. To \nthe Cult, what matters is pushing one’s \nboundaries and loving life on all lev- \nels, not becoming trapped in an \naddiction or trying to avoid the expe- \nrience of living at all costs. As \ndesperate as the fight has become, the \nCult has one powerful ally on its side: \nthe knowledge that no matter what \nlimits the Technocracy can come up \nwith, there will always be those who \nsee those doctrines not as limits to \naccept but as challenges to overcome. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nRBLEPLAYING \nHINTS \nOnly those who are at peace with themselves and their desires have the \nstrength to truly throw themselves into their passions without getting lost. \nWhile members may seem on the surface to be totally without center, the Cult \nactually searches for those with a very strong sense of self, however well hidden \nthis strength may be.

Unlike \nother willworkers, however, the foci that the Cult uses all too easily become \naddictions in their own right. Drugs, sex, music, daredevil stunts and even \nmeditation can all become crutches for the character using them, and some \nCultists find themselves compelled to indulge in their foci on a regular basis even \nwhen they are not working magic. Every Cultist character indulges in some sort \nof vice, and he must take the opportunity to indulge at least once per game \nsession. Usually this indulgence has some sort of down side. For instance, a \ncultist might wind up out of play for an hour at a really opportune moment, or \nhe might find himself two Traits down on all challenges for an hour.

The world of spirit is as real as our own, and while many parts of \nit mirror our own (or the world we know in our heart instead of see with our \neyes), many others are realms unto themselves, completely alien to the reality \nwith which we are familiar. \nIt was not always this way, of course. Once, the realms of spirit and flesh were \none, and they knew each other as intimately as the two halves of a heartbeat. In \nthose days, the Dreamspeakers were the wise men and shamans who spoke to \nthese strange entities and used their secrets to help people and appease the \nspirits’ strange hungers. But with the rise of humanity’s reliance on technology \nand its growing skepticism of the old ways, the world was split in two. For the first \ntime, the Dreamspeakers found themselves facing a cold barrier known as the \nGauntlet whenever they tried to contact their spirit allies. It was a dark time \nindeed, and had they tried to weather the storm alone, the Dreamspeakers might \nnot have survived at all. \nAs it was, salvation did come, albeit as a blessing indisguise. Along with the \ndecline in the ancient ways came the expansion of the Order of Hemes, and \nrather than war constantly with the different spiritual traditions they came \nacross, the Order offered the spirit mystics a choice. The Dreamspeakers could \njoin the Order under one banner, or face their decline alone. Spirit gateways and \nunseen messengers brought word from far and wide to the great council fires \ninviting the magicians to join the new Council. While some groups refused what \nthey saw as a subordinate role, the others saw the wisdom in joining forces, and \nthe Dreamspeaker Tradition was born. \nTo this day, it remains one of the most diverse Traditions, represent- \ning nearly every animistic culture around the world and many more that \nfaded from mortal memory long ago. What unites these mages is their deep \nrespect for the spirits around them, the Earth they defend and the ancient \n‘ I  heritage they embody. They threw themselves into the Ascension War \nwith a passion, but seldom on the same battlegrounds as their peers. While \n, other mages battled to define the static reality of Earth, the Dreamspeakers \nacted as defenders and avengers for the spirit Realms. They sought to \nprevent the spread of Earthly corruption and keep the Umbra of their spirit \nelder gods to shades depar \nexperts like to say that spir \n, \n: \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nu \nallies as pure as possible. While they could not \nreverse the damage that was done when the Gaunt- \n* let arose, they did their best to keep the old beliefs \nalive in hopes that one day it would relax a bit, and \ny could once again experience the unseen \neant that unfolds in the spirit worlds daily. \nAs might be expected, then, the recent \nonset of the Avatar Storm has been a \ndisastrous blow to these mages. The \nDreamspeakers have relied on spirit \nquests and Umbral travel as part of \ntheir artsfor millennia, and the heavy \n* % toll and higher risks such travel now \nentails makes it difficult for them to \nmaintain their old sacred places and \nrites as they once did. They are des- \nperate to find some solution to the \nproblem as fast as possible, and sev- \neral grand council meetings - \nthe \nfirst such gatherings since the found- \ning of the Tradition - \nhave already \nbeen called along this line. Fortu- \nnately, the neopagan and other such \nmovements of the past half century \nor \nso \nhave \nprovided \nthe \nDreamspeakers with a fresh base of \nsupport in their efforts, andquite a few \nheamspeaker Chantries that were falling into \niin have been restored once again. This is a \nrucial time for the Tradition. If the \nheamspeakers can use the momentum behind \nhis new infusion of interest to bring ancient \njeliefs back into the modern consensual real- \nty, they will have made a fantastic leap toward \nichieving some of their goals. If they fail, \nLowever, it may very well be the last such \nchance that many of these beliefs have. And \nthe fate of the worlds both spirit and flesh \ndepend on what this outcome will be. \n4 \nL \nR~LEPLAYING \nHINTS \nDreamspeakers and Verbena are alike in \nmany ways: Both revere ancient practices, re- \nspect the sanctity of the Earth and its creatures \nand seek to preserve their traditions in the \nface of crippling modern attention. However, \nwhere the Verbena turn to the cycles of life and \nthe natural world for their inspiration, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDreamspeakers look beyond this world entirely and study the spiritual heart \nthat beats underneath its skin. Their actions reflect this difference. While \nVerbena seek simple and direct solutions, the Dreamspeakers plead with or \ncommand spirits to bring about the changes they desire. They often have an \nair of otherworldly mystique to them, as if they have just gazed straight on \nat what you keep seeing out of the corner of your eye. They also tend to act \nwith great deliberation since they are aware of the many levels of repercus- \nsions even the slightest actions might have on the unseen realms. Many also \nobserve any number of small superstitions and other eccentricities, which \nstem from the very particular demands of the spirits they deal with.

These days, it is difficult for them to find others of their kind \nat all, Even if they do find others, the diverse practices of the Tradition \nmake learning from them a haphazard matter at best. Dreamspeaker \nlibraries are nearly nonexistent as well since most of these groups rely on \noral traditions. Dreamspeakers may not begin with more than two levels \nof either the Mentor or Library Backgrounds, and it is within the \nStoryteller’s discretion to ban those Traits entirely. Furthermore, while \nmost other Traditions have an organized and unified structure, the \nDreamspeakers are more a hodgepodge of spiritualists and shamans who \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nhave been shoved into one category by the rest of the Traditions. A \nDreamspeaker has one less Reputation Trait than his position would \nnormally suggest, simply because a Dreamspeaker leader's authority isn't \nrecognized as widely. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\noccurs, the Euthanatoi argue that it is better to cut a thread and allow another \na chance for the soul to start anew and hopefully avoid some of the same mistakes \nit made in this life. \nNaturally, this duty is not one to be taken lightly, and the Euthanatoi \nhave developed over time what is known as the Thanatoic Code. This code \nis a series of rules governing whether it is appropriate to give a target the \nb Good Death or use some more subtle means of influence. A Euthanatos \nmage’s conduct is also monitored closely by his fellows, especially early in his \ncareer.

While they are valuable for their \nskill and their professionalism, Euthanatoi \ne seldom welcomed with real warmth \nby their fellows, which only makes \ntheir duty that much harder. \nEvents of recent years have \nstretched even this resourceful Tra- \ndition to its limits. In addition to \nthe many battles that the \nEuthanatoi faced during the As- \ncension War, the number of \nmundane problems and people \ninvolved in them have spiraled \nbeyond the means of the \nEuthanatoi to influence as they \nwould desire. Now, many \nEuthanatoi are confused as to \nwhat course of action they should \nfollow. Some see the need for \nsome massive event to bring bal- \nance back to the Wheel and \nsmooth the transition between \nlifetimes again. Others refuse to \nconsider such drastic solutions, and they \ntry instead to find key individuals to ma- \nnipulate in order to effect change on the \nmasses. Conflict has not yet come to a head \nbetween proponents of these different view- \n1 points, but there is certainly a growing rift \nL within the Tradition. Initiates had best \nwatch themselves carefully, lest they find \nthat they have taken a side in a war they \ndidn't even know was taking place. \nThe Avatar Storm troubles the \nEuthanatoi deeply as well, for they see it as \n' \na sign of a great disruption in the cycle of \nreincarnation. They would go to great \nlengths to find some way to end the fury of \nthe storm. Ironically, the Euthanatoi con- \nsider themselves healers. The Good Death \nmay seem a terrible and wicked tool, yet \nultimately it is a scalpel one must use to end \nr \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsuffering. Where the world suffers under the weight of despair or horror, the \nEuthanatos cuts away the evil in hopes of bringing about something new. \nREEMPLAYING \nHINTS \nThe Euthanatos mage takes on a heavy responsibility when he holds a life \nin his hands. Some would say that members of this Tradition are morally \nbankrupt, but the Euthanatos reply that at least they are taking a stand, when \nnobody else is willing to do so. As a rule, one can be sure when a Euthanatos \nmakes a decision that she has examined the consequences carefully beforehand. \nThe nature of their duty demands no less of them. \nAs for personal comportment, most Euthanatoi actually do exhibit some \ndegree of their legendary chilly aura, at least when they are carrying out their \nduty. Most Euthanatoi save their more passionate faces for close friends and \nfamily. People who do get to know a Euthanatos mage are typically surprised at \nthe deeply thoughtful and often quite fun-loving streak that the mage exhibits. \nEuthanatoi are ext \nrs when they have the \ndships that last (quite \nseriously as they take \nusually several varieties of it.

The \nroots of this still-powerful society of mages stretch back to a fateful mixture of \nEgyptian rituals, Hebrew Kabbalah lore and the numerology of the early Greek \nphilosophers, which produced a formulaic, precise and extremely powerful \nmagic unlike any the world had ever seen. It was an attractive approach, \nespecially compared to the fearful propitiation of inscrutable gods or touchy \nspirits that many other wizards practiced at the time, and the cult of Thrice- \nGreat Hermes gained in power even as the societies that birthed it slid into \ndecline. Eventually, the banner of the Order of Hermes could been seen flying \nover strongholds throughout Europe, the Mediterranean and even parts of \nnorthern Africa. \nIndeed, the greatest strength of the Order was that it expanded con- \nstantly, creating new Houses within itself to accommodate the various \npractices it came in contact with while still cataloging and codifying disparate \nstyles to suit Hermetic tastes. During the Mythic Ages, the Order reigned \nsupreme, battling agents of the Infernal and expanding the boundaries of \nmagical knowledge. Hermetic mages sought such elusive goals as the \nphilosopher’s stone, an elixir of immortality and even the means to bring the \ndead back from their rest. Peasants marveled and nobles bridled at the power \nof the Order, but none dared challenge it. \nThen the Artificers came. \nThe Artificers - \nwho were also known as the Order of Reason, and who \nwould later become the Technocracy - \nrepresented the desire to take magic \n: : from the hands of the elite and give it to the masses as a whole. The Order of \nHermes believed that doing so would lead to the destruction of the world at \n’ the hands of uncontrolled mystical forces. So began the Ascension War and \n~ \nthe end of the Hermetics’ golden age. While the early contests were fierce, the \nOrder was also riddled with infighting and other petty squabbles. These \ndistractions took away from the Hermetic war effort, and the tide of battle \n2 ’ changed conclusively in favor of the Artificers. By the end of the Renaissance \nalone, Chantries were ruined, cabals were decimated, and entire Hermetic \nHouses had been destroyed. With the bitter defeat of the Order of Hermes \n. came the end of the consensual acceptance of magic, and that loss remains a \nI \n, I \n‘ \n, *a thorn in the Order’s side even today. \na*& I ,  * \n1 - 1 .  \nI ’  \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nFortunately, one of the last moves the unified Order \nmade was to call the conclave that led to the establish- \nment of the Council of Nine. In fact, most Hermetics \nare glad to recall this fact in the company of their fellow \nTradition mages with no small amount of pride. Even \nnow, the Order sees itself as the head of the resistance \nagainst the static reality of the Technocrats. It claims to \nguide the other Traditions so that they might best \nuse their resources effectively. Naturally, this \npaternal attitude doesn't always endear \nHermetics to their peers, but that's simply \nUnfortunately for the Order's collec- \ntive pride, the de facto end of the \nAscension War and the losses it suffered \nduring the genesis of the Avatar Storm \nhave dealt another blow to the \nTradition's good name. The Tradition \nhas also suffered more than any other \nTradition due to the subsequent disap- \npearance of many of the more \nenlightened mages from Earth. Ad- \nvancement in the Order is a formal, \nhierarchical process.

This revelation would also debunk the idea that \np* space was filled with breathable, easily traveled “ether” (an idea that was \nenjoying a great deal of popularity at the time). Furious that their fellows \nwould take such a strong stand against exploration, the Etherites parted \ncompany with their colleagues and wound up joining the Tradition Council \n’ \n- *  limits of existing science and introducing doctrines that tweak the rigid rules \nthat Technocratic science seeks to enforce. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nother fields of Science that the Sons pioneered have \nall been legitimized and accepted by the masses. \nThe spread of these theories has certainly set more \nthan one Technocrat to grinding their teeth in \nfrustration as they work to undo the damage the \nEtherites have done to their tidy little paradigm. \nWhat's more, the advances they've made in space \nexploration have shown a surprising degree of \neffectiveness in coping with the results of \nAvatar Storm. Many Etherites \nhave achieved a new degree of \nrecognition among other Tradi- \ntion mages by providing the only \nway to safely reach the other side \nof the Gauntlet. Unfortunately, \nthese same advances in both the \nmagical and mundane worlds and \nthe ignominy of their defection \nplaces the Etherites at the top \nof the Technocracy's hit list, \nfollowed closely by their fellow \ndefectors, the Virtual Adepts. \nBoth sides give little quarter when \nthey come in conflict, and all Etherites \nwould rather die than fall victim to \nTechnocratic reprogramming. It re- \nmains to be seen whether they will \nsurvive to enjoy their newfound \nfame, or if it will merely bring them \ndown.

While they recognized that \ndeath is as natural as life, the Verbena insisted that those who followed them \ntake life only when necessary, and always with respect. Even then, their \nfrankness about life’s functions and the reality of death earned them an \nuncertain reputation.

Small groups survived in secrecy, maintaining \n‘ the old ways as best they could, but by the time of the Renaissance and later \nthe occultism of the Victorian age many of these traditions had been lost \nto antiquity. Now, modern Verbena must often deal with frustrating gaps \nin the history and practices of their Tradition. While neopagan and New \nAge ideas have replaced some of these missing pieces, it has only been after \ngreat debate and dissent within the Tradition. \nVerbena are careful to make sure that their rites exceed what even the \nmost fervent un-Awakened practitioners of similar crafts consider proper \nceremony, if only to prove that their Tradition’s roots go deeper than the \npast half-century’s resurgence of interest.

They take the sterile technology of the \nTechnocracy and give it the spirit it so desperately needs. As they see it, \nnothing is inherently wrong with science or technology, as the other Tradi- \ntions like to claim. Rather, it is how those tools are applied that makes them \nbeneficial or destructive. \nLike the Sons of Ether, the Virtual Adepts began as a Convention of the \nTechnocracy, known as the Difference Engineers. Using Babbage's difference \nengine, Lovelace's computational theory, Bell's long-distance technology and \na whole lot of inspired theories of their own, these proto-Adepts were the \npioneers responsible for devising new ways of gathering, storing and interpret- \ning data for the rest of the Technocracy. As the 20th century progressed, \nhowever, the Adepts went farther and farther beyond their assigned sphere of \ninfluence. They got caught up in the excitement of discovery as they theorized \nthe first virtual realities (earning their new moniker in the process), and they \nbegan working in earnest on their dream of bringing the world together \nthrough technology. Unfortunately, the Technocracy didn't see things their \nway. The other Conventions rejected the Adept's utopian vision for placing \ntoo much power in the hands of the masses, and they cracked down brutally \non what they saw as a dangerous liability. \nHorrified that the Union would use such extreme measures against its own \nkind - \nand unwilling to give up the dream they had within their reach - \nthe \nalways-rebellious Adepts made a daring decision to defect. After stealing as \nmuch information and equipment as they could and leaving behind as many \nnasty surprises for their former allies as they could, the Adepts came to the \nCouncil of Nine and asked if it could use another faction in its war against the \nTechnocracy's enforced static reality. \nAs it happened, the struggling Council was in dire need of inside informa- \ntion with which to strike against the Technocratic juggernaut. It also needed a \nTradition to take the seat of Correspondence, which had been vacant since the \nloss of the Ahl-i-Batin. While many members of the other Traditions still have \ntrouble accepting the Adepts and their enthusiastic reliance on technology, no \none can question the invaluable services the Adepts have performed since they \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\njoined. As the recent Internet boom has testified, the idea of the Digital Web \nhas an immense appeal to people in all sectors in society. Try as it might to \nregulate it, the Technocracy has still been unable to uproot the chaotic, anti- \nauthoritarian sentiments the Adepts seeded throughout the Net and its culture. \nIndeed, the Ascension War would have ended several decades sooner without \nthe Virtual Adepts’ defection. Even in the wake of that event, the Adepts \ncontinue to offer perhaps the best chance the Traditions have for keeping the \nTechnocracy from gaining an absolute stranglehold on reality.. . if the other \nTraditions don’t choke the life out of the smug little bastards first, that is. \nAside from the outstanding prices on their heads from the Technocracy, \nthat hubris is perhaps the greatest problem facing this Tradition today. All \nmages must struggle to maintain some sense of humility once they learn of their \ntalent for shaping the world, but events have been falling almost entirely in the \nAdepts’ favor lately. That being the case, they’re in danger of becoming victims \nof their own success. After the crash of the \nriginal Digital Web due to Sleeper over- \nload, many Adepts have become \ncondescending and territorial. They’ve \nforegone their vision of spreading infor- \nmation and creating a digital Utopia in \nfavor ofresolvingpetty grudges, ex- \nchanging nasty viruses and \nengaging in other largely \nmeaningless instances of . \ncomputer sabotage. \n’ \nThey claim to despise \nthe lowest-common- \nd e n o m i n a t o r  \nattitude that they \nfind in society, but \ntheir ownactions en- \nand vital informa- \ntion in a deluge of \nto demonstrate \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ntheir superiority over the Sleepers and all other travelers they find in their \nchosen domain. They have the potential to steal the technological future right \nout from under the Technocrats in the coming years, but it’s anyone’s guess \nwhether the Adepts will finally mature and do so or simply fall into the same \ntraps that undid so many other wizards before them. \nR~LEPLAYING \nHINTS \nOn the Digital Web, differences like age, gender, race and social class \ndisappear, and the only true measure of another person is their eloquence and \ntheir accomplishments. The Virtual Adepts likewise come from all ages and \nwalks of life. For every stereotypical college dropout coding from the darkness \nof his parent’s basement, the Adepts count a university professor teaching a \ndifferent kind of mathematics to his students or an intense metaphysician who \nuses computer code as mean \naltering the nature of the \ntive by mages of other Traditions, the Adepts thrive on contests of cleverness \n5 and ingenuity among their own kind. (So what if these contests often take the \nform of designing video games or other “frivolous” things?) More importantly, \n1 \nAdepts who show some promise at this system of dares (namely people like \nplayers’ characters) receive unexpected software uploads or other anonymous \n‘ I  puzzles from their fellow Adepts. If the character is able to figure out how these \n‘ \n~ \npuzzles work, the solutions can give her insight into some problem she may be \nhaving in her own life as well. No one knows exactly how this process works, \ne the difference for some Adepts stuck on \nthe past. However, some of the younger \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAdepts are really starting to wonder just how it is that these surprises are so well \ntimed after all.. . . \nAn Adept confronted with a riddle, puzzle or similar problem gains double \nthe normal number of clues or amount of time other players get to solve it, \ndepending on the nature of the puzzle. For instance, if a Storyteller asks a riddle \nand gives the players five minutes to come up with an answer, the Virtual Adept \nis allowed 10 minutes to think about it. This benefit reflects the fact that he’s \nprobably either dealt with a similar puzzle in some form or received some tidbit \nof information previously that just happens to be useful right then. \nIn less mysterious terms, however, all Adepts have one thing in common: \na love of anything and everything computer-related. Therefore, starting \nAdepts begin with two free levels of the Computer Ability, and most purchase \nmore on top of that. If any Adepts have ever complained of this narrow focus, \nno one else has heard of it yet. \nTradition Disadvantage: Digital Despots \nBeing the latest thing to hit the Traditions and the masterminds behind \nwhat’s now a global computer revolution, most Adepts have very little in the \nway of humility. They reinforce this condition constantly through their \ncynical evaluation of the millions of irritatingly clueless souls who now log \nonto the once exclusive Net everyday. All Adepts receive the Negative Social \nTrait: Obnoxious as a result when they deal with the subject of computers in \nany way. As a general rule, assume that the Negative Trait applies if the \nComputer Ability is necessary to challenge or understand a given conversation \nor practice. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nMention the Hollow Ones to most Tradition mages, and you'll get a \ndisappointed sigh at best. At worst, you'll get a curse and a muttered \ninvective about \"those damn kids.\" Of course, it might be expecting too \nmuch to think that the Traditions would appreciate those who openly defy \ntheir ways like the Hollow Ones do. Plus, it can't be debated that the Hollow \nmany of the things that the Traditions fight against. Where \nthe Traditions fight to shape a better future of the world, the Hollow Ones \nbelieve that the world is already doomed, and they are determined to enjoy \nthe decline as best they can. \nEverything else Tradition mages know about this renegade group of \nmages is more rumor and supposition than solid fact, which is one more \nreason that few trust the Hollow Ones much. What's more, even what little \nb is known is often frustratingly contradictory in nature. Although some of \nthe more pretentious members like to say that Hollowers have been around \nin all times - \nfiddling as Rome burned and otherwise reveling in the \ndarkness of society - \nmore pragmatic Hollowers are not so cavalier. They \npoint to the Romantic poetry and spiritualist movements of the Victorian \nera, the 1920s American flapper counterculture and the gothic-punk \n8 music underground of the '70s to find the roots of their grim society. Above \ni all, they are creatures of the modern age, for all the good and ill that \ndescription encompasses, and they delight in mentioning as much to any \ncondescending Tradition mages or other authority figures who look down \non their shadowed ways. \nWithin this most loose of magical associations, Hollow Ones group them- \n* * selves by cliques, groups of friends and allies who look after each other. Unlike \nmore formal cabals, some Hollow One cliques include not only Sleeper members \nbut even other supernatural beings as vampires or ghosts as well. Even those \ncliques that don't do so more than likely have a good idea where to find the \nnearest member of that species. \nWhile Hollow Ones claim not to judge each other by petty societal \n1 \nstandards, clique rivalry can sometimes become as fierce as any other type \n* *  of conflict. Hollow Ones are more likely to come in conflict with each \n' other over who has rights to an exclusive nightclub or a prime graveyard \nmore esoteric points of conflict, though. As their motley \night indicate, Hollowers take what they like and discard \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nnything else. It’s not uncommon to find a \nHollow One who practices a nearly perfect \nimitation of Hermetic magic when command- \ning the elements, does yoga for Life rotes, \nturns to a Ouija board for communing with \nspirits and then listens to custom music mixes \nto invoke his mind magic. In fact, it’s precisely \nthis eclectic style that infuriates many of their \nre traditional counterparts. The Hollowers can \nmingly make anything magical, rather than \nst adhering to the limited range of things that \nach Tradition preaches as the one true way. For \ntheir part, the Hollowers say that if it works for \nthem, the others can just deal with it. \nI \ni \nRCBLEPLAYING \nH i m  \nLet it be stated now, for the record. Hollow \nOnes are not all Goths in black lace and white \nface paint, nor are they all punks with mohawks \nout trashing the local mosh pit. Honestly, \nwhile those little conventions were cer- \ntainly fun in their heyday, they died out \nover adecade ago, you know? Hollowers \nplace a lot of importance on style, and \nstyle is a function of expressing one- \nself and finding new and innovative \nI \nways to present oneself, not simply \ncloning what’s on television. \nPerhaps the only definite overall trend \none might notice among the Hollow Ones is a \npreference for dark colors. Outside of that, the \nmix of Victorian, Prohibition, punk, indus- \ntrial, fetish and other fashions the Hollowers \n1 employ can literally dazzle the eye. Under- \nstand this drive for individuality, and you \nunderstand a lot more about the Hollow Ones’ \nsense of identity. Stilt, this loose group gets more \nthan its fair share of new blood from those who grow \nin the Goth and industrial subcultures, and usually \npart of their fashion and style reflects it, be it a \nFashion secrets aside, being a Hollow One really is \nmore a mindset than anything else.

To ensure that everybody plays the game on \ncommon ground, though, the rules define the characters' particular parameters. \nThat way, comparing characters and their limits or talents becomes a simple \ntask. The rules in this chapter provide a descriptive means to build a character, \nboth as a persona and as a set of defining qualities. \nSTEP \n$NE: INSPIRATI~N \nYou start the character-creation process with a simple choice of concept. Your \nmage was a person before he Awakened, after all, and he had goals and fears like \neveryone else. A good choice of concept helps you to figure out what Traits and \ncharacteristics may be appropriate to your mage based on the person he was before. \nYour concept probably boils down to a simple word that describes the essence \nof the character's personality: artist, teacher, bum, businesswoman or the like. Pick \nout a broad, general label that you can hang on the character easily. As you pick \nTraits and specifications later, your mage will take amore definite shape. For now, \nhowever, this concept gives you the basic foundation upon which to build. \nTRADTTICBN \nOnce you've decided what sort of person your mage was, pick the kind of \nmage that he became. Mages take on apprentices and teach mystic practices in \nsmall groups that propagate their own styles and beliefs. Therefore, your mage \nlikely studied with a Tradition whose beliefs already meshed with his own. A \nmage who favors dance and meditation would likely find common ground with \nthe Cult of Ecstasy or the Akashic Brotherhood, while a maverick scientist \nwould fit well with the Virtual Adepts or Sons of Ether. Of course, your mage \nmight not ever have found a mentor with matching beliefs - \nand he can \ncertainly rail against the stereotypes - \nbut the character's choice of Tradition \nshapes how the mage practices magic and how other mages react to him. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n- \nChoose a concept \n- \nChoose a Tradition \n- \nChoose a Nature and Demeanor \n- \nChoose an Avatar Essence \nStep Two: Attributes - \nWhat are your basic capabilities? \n-Prioritize Attributes (seven primary, five secondary and three tertiary) \n- \nChoose Traits \nStep Three: Advantages --.What do you know? \n- \nChoose five Abilities \n- \nChoose seven Backgrounds \nStep Four: Last Touches - \nFill in the details. \n- \nAssign Arete Trait (1) \n- \nAssign Willpower Traits (5) \n- \nChoose Resonance Trait (1) \n- \nChoose Negative Traits \n- \nChoose a derangement (if any) \n- \nSpend 5 (or more) Free Traits \n- \nChoose additional Spheres (4 more if \nThe Tradition teaches a budding Apprentice the necessary tools to work magic \nand strive for improvement and Ascension.

That being the case, your Storyteller may \nrestrict your choice of Tradition based upon the circumstances of the chronicle. \nShould you find that no Tradition seems to match the sort of magician you \nwant to portray, you can always choose to be an Orphan - \na mage who learned \nmagic from some minor society or even taught himself. You could also play a \nHollow One - \na member of a loosely affiliated group of mages who share only \na few common practices. of course, playing such a character also subjects you to \nthe rigors of being outside normal mage society, and makes it more difficult to \nlearn the Spheres. A mage without a Tradition doesn’t have hundreds of years \nof his predecessors’ study and experience to draw upon, after all. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nists are a study in personal discipline and zeal for war. \nSpecialty Sphere: Mind \nCelestial Chorus-The \nSingers celebrate divinity through song a \nSpecialty Sphere: Prime \nCult ofEcstasy-The \nSeers transcend the barriers of time, space \nortality through dance and exhausting pleasures- but only if they do \nse themselves in temptation and hedonism. \nrayer, but few agree on the true form of the divine. \nSpecialty Sphere: Time \nDreamspeakers - \nAround the world, many and varied naturalist \ntualists and shadans commune with the very Earth and struggle \nive as belief in their holistic practices withers. \nseek to bring Balance and relieve suffering, even if doing so mea \ng the unrighteous or the doomed. \npecialty Sphere: Enmopy \nOrder of Hermes -The great Order descends from a thousand \nSpecialty Sphere: Forces \nSons of Ether - \nThese scientists who reject \nspiration to cast-off technology or seek out vision \na combination of brilliance and madness. \nSpecialty Sphere: Matter \nSpecialty Sphere: Correspondence \nHollow Ones - \nGoth is dead and it’s doing fine, say the sou \nutcasts who have no place among the Traditions.

Each of the Archetypes listed here presents a pattern of behavior for a \ncharacter, but this list certainly isn’t exhaustive. Storytellers can and should expand \nthe list of Archetypes to give characters a broad range of personality traits. \nThe character’s Nature represents his internal drives and desires. The \nNature provides the strong formative elements of the personality, but it’s often \nhidden beneath the character’s outer actions. Since the Nature forms as a result \nof strong personal experiences, it’s a central part of the character that rarely \nchanges, except as a result of extreme trauma. \nThe character’s Demeanor, on the other hand, is the face that she presents \nto the world. The Demeanor is the means through which the character often \nexpresses herself. Since few people are totally honest, even with themselves, most \nindividuals’ Demeanors differ from their Natures. A character’s Demeanor may \nchange with mood or circumstance, as the individual tries to fit into surrounding \nevents, but many people have one Demeanor that they commonly resort to. \nAVATAR \nESSENCE \nAn Awakened mage struggles with his inner spirit in ways that few Sleepers \ncomprehend. As the mage seeks enlightenment and Ascension, her very soul \ndrives her in strange ways that are sometimes contrary to her personal desires and \noften mirrored through countless incarnations and legends. To some mages, this \ninner Avatar speaks and appears, making demands or cajoling the mage along \nthe path to awareness. For others, the Avatar’s guidance is a subtle interplay of \nfeelings, hunches, dreams and emotions. Every Awakened mage feels it to some \ndegree, though, and the form of these compulsions stems from the Avatar’s \nEssence - \nthe persona of the Avatar itself. \nMages recognize four basic Avatar Essences: Dynamic, Pattern, Primordial \nand Questing. In theory, an Infinite Essence exists as some combination of these \ndrives, but no modem mage has discovered such an Avatar. Regardless, each \nmage has a single driving Avatar with one Essence and one view of the cosmos. \nabout renewal and rebirth. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAt this point, just pick one Essence for your mage’s Avatar. This choice \ndetermines the ultimate magical goals that the mage often feels compelled to pursue, \nand itplaysanimportantpartinSeekingsasthemagestrivesforgreaterenlightenment. \nA mage can be smart, strong or handsome, or perhaps a little closer to \naverage, but he certainly isn’t bereft of the basics of humanity. Defining your \ncharacter’s innate talents and limits is the purview of Attribute Traits. \nSTEP TWQ: ATTRIBURS \nCHCBQSING \nATTRIBUTES \nA character’s Attribute Traits describe a wide range of human g i b  and \ncapabilities. Youcandecide whether your mage is physically adroit, mentally nimble \nor socially adept. Although few people excel in all fields, most mages stand out in one \ncategory or another. You should assign your mage’s Traits to highlight his aptitudes. \nPhysical Attributes cover the range of muscle power, speed, fitness and \ngeneral health. A character with few Physical Attributes is not very fast or \nstrong, while a character with a high number of Physical Attributes has a good \nathletic build and sterling physical qualities. \nSocial Attributes describe the character’s leadership skills, personality, \nappearance, speaking quality and his ability to interact with people. A character \nwith few Social Attributes isn’t a very compelling speaker, and he doesn’t attract \nothers easily. A character with many Social Attributes may possess a command- \ning presence, a natural authority or an air of compelling sensuality. \ncommon sense, even in the absence of formal education or scientific training. \nDecide on the area in which you want your mage to be strongest and which \nareas will be closer to the average. Generally, eachcharacter has aslightly different \nSocial Traits: Alluring, Begdng, Charismatic, Charming, C u m d n g  \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncharacter, you pick Attribute Traits, as shown here and on p. 87. Each Trait \nrepresents a specific strength. Pick the adjectives that elaborate on the way your \ncharacter should be presented. An astute, bookish professor may be more \nKnowkdgeabk and Rational than his wise-cracking companion, who is Ckver and \nIntuitive, but both have strong Mental Traits. \nChoose seven Traits in your primary Attribute category. Choose five Traits \nin your secondary category. Choose three in your tertiary category. You can \nchoose the same Trait multiple times to reflect a character’s higher-than-usual \naptitude in that particular area. \nSTEP THREE: \nADVANTAGES \nSince your mage probably had just as many life experiences as any more \nmundane person, it only makes sense that he has a comparable range of skills and \ncapabilities. Just about everyone has some hobby, job or education, and this \ngeneralization applies to mages as well. Furthermore, a mage has various \ncharacteristics that normal humans don’t have. The Awakening brings with it \nan awareness of the universe that most people lack, not to mention the magical \ntalent to reshape reality based on this enlightened awareness. All together, these \ncharacteristics are Advantages. They make up the special areas of learning or \nmystical heritage that have developed with experience or magical talent. \nOf course, there are many sorts of Advantages. Abilities represent learned \nand practiced capabilities that most people have. They represent natural talents, \nworking skills and useful mundane knowledge. Backgrounds cover the mage’s \nconnection to mundane or magical society, as well as some measures of the \nmage’s inherent magical power. The Spheres describe the mage’s knowledge of \nmagical practice in different aspects of reality. Finally, Resonance elaborates on \nthe personal, unique nature of the character’s magic. \nCHGBSING ABILEIES \nPick any five Abilities that make sense for your character’s life history, \ntraining, Tradition and personal predilections. You can choose multiple levels \nof an Ability to show higher levels of skill. See the list of Abilities on p. 94 for \ncomplete descriptions of what the various Abilities do. \nASSIGNING \nSPECIALTY \nSPHERES \nEach Tradition trains (some would say indoctrinates) its novices in the \npractice of its key Sphere. Since each Tradition has a heritage of study that \ncovers one Sphere in great depth, Apprentices reap the benefits of that legacy \nof concentrated study. This base specialized Sphere is often easier for the mage t \nto improve and understand, simply because his fundamental studies were so ;- \nmuch more detailed and because the Tradition itself bases its magical practices ; \nAcademics, Alertness, At \nLeadership, Linguistics, Medicine, Meditation, Me1 \nScience, Stealth, Streetwise, Subterfuge, Survival \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\non principles that mesh well with that Sphere. Write down the first level of your \nTradition’s specialty Sphere, as listed on the Tradition chart on p. 76. \nFurthermore, some Traditions’ factions teach variants on the Tradition’s base \npractices. If you decide to choose to make your character a member of a faction \nWithinhisTradition (see theTraditiondescriptions inChapterTwo), yougain the \nfirst level of the faction’s specialty Sphere as well as the first levelof theTradition’s \nspecialty Sphere. This faction Sphere then becomes your mage’s specialty instead \nof the Tradition’s Sphere for purposes of Experience Trait costs. If you don’t pick \na faction, or if your faction doesn’t have a different specialty, just note the \nTradition specialty as your specialty Sphere for purposes of Experience Trait costs. \nYour mage’s mix of mortal and magical heritage gives her access to a wide \nrange of social characteristics and mystical strengths known as the character’s \nBackgrounds. You can pick seven total Background Traits for your mage, \nalthough you can’t have more than five levels in any one Background, and your \nStoryteller will certainly want a good explanation for any Background that \nexceeds three Traits. See p. 102 for a full description of Backgrounds. \nCHGBSING \nBACKGRWNDS \nSTEP FWR: LAST TCBUCHES \nAfter you’ve fleshed out your character’s various Attributes, Abilities, \nTradition and Backgrounds, you can determine your mage’s Arete Traits, \nWillpower Traits, Negative Traits, derangements and Sphere levels. \nAR!€-rETRArrS \nThe mage’s enlightenment, mystical insight and awareness of magic com- \nbine to form his Arete. A young Initiate most often has only a single Arete Trait, \nBACKGRCBUNDS \nipl \nAllies -Normal \nhuman confederates and aides who can help you OUI \nArcane - \nAn unnatural tendency \nAvatar - \nThe strength of your ma \nContacts - \nInformation sources and snitches. \nDestiny -A great task or fate that lies ahead and demands fulfillmeni \nDream - \nConnection to the universe through the subconscious min \nand ability to access information through that link. \nInfluence - \nSway over normal Sleeper society in any number of area: \nincluding: Bureaucracy, Church, Finance, Health, High Society, Industry, Lega \nMedia, Occult, Poke, Political, Street, Transportation, Underworldor Univo-sit \nLibrary - \nAccess to records and information about magic. \nMentor - \nAn older (maybe) and wiser (hopefully) mage who helps an \nNode - \nRegular access to a place of mystical power. \nResources - \nMoney, holdings and possessions. \nWonder - \nAn item your mage owns that has magical propertie \nto the mage’s ability to store and channel magical energy naturally. \neducates you. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrepresenting the burst of fresh insight that characterizes the change from Sleeper \nto Awakened mage. With time, experience and Seekings, the mage can improve \nhis rating in this Trait. \nYour mage’s Arete determines the success or failure of most of his spell \nEffects (see Chapter Four), as well as the limit of how much of the Spheres the \ncharacter can comprehend. Your mage cannot learn a Sphere level above the \ncharacter’s total Arete Traits. Therefore, a mage with only a single Arete Trait \ncan learn only the first level of any of the Spheres. \nUnless you spend Free Traits at character creation, your mage starts the game \nwith only a single Arete Trait. You cannot raise your Arete above three Traits by \nspending Free Traits, however. Further enlightenment comes only with experience. \nMages have strong reserves of internal fortitude. Reshaping the cosmos \ndemands nothing less. Willpower represents the resilience that allows the \nmagician to overcome extreme hardship or continue to fight when all seems lost. \nWillpower determines a mage’s maximum number of Arete Traits, helps him \nresist extreme physical injury and lets him draw on deep reserves of strength \nwhen he is worn down. \nYour starting mage character has five permanent Willpower Traits. In play, \nyou spend temporary Willpower Traits, which refresh themselves later to a \nmaximum of your permanent rating. With experience, you can improve this \nrating to a maximum of 10 Willpower Traits. \nWILLP~WER \nTRAITS \n&S~NANCE TRAITS \nEach mage has an individual spin on magic that colors his Effects subtly when \nhe performs them. These personal twists of magic show up as Resonance. Generally, \na magical spell resonates with its creator’s individual characteristics, and a mage with \na large amount of Resonance injects it ever more clearly into his Effects. \nPick one Dynamic, Entropic or Static Resonance Trait when you begin play. \nYou may gain additional Resonance Traits as the story unfolds. \nNEATWE TRAITS \nYour mage has some specific deficiency. Maybe she’s forgetful, or perhaps \nshe is just small and weak. Perhaps these problems are natural, or maybe they \nstem from some accident or injury. In any case, these difficulties become \nNegative Traits. You don’t have to take any Negative Traits, they help to flesh \nout specific hindrances that your character suffers. \nIn addition to giving you a means to describe a character’s minor problems and \npeccadilloes, Negative Traits provide extra opportunities to strengthen your char- \nacter elsewhere. EachNegative Trait that you take is g o d  for one Free Trait that you : \nmay spend later. You can take up to a total of five Negative Traits, although you \nC \nshouldn’t take more than three Negative Traits in the same Attribute category. You \nusually shouldn’t take the same Negative Trait more than once either. \nWhile you can often make up new Attribute Traits to describe your character, \nyoushouldstickto theNegativeTraitslistedhere. IfyouhaveaTrait that’snot listed, \n8 \nother players won’t be able to invoke it in play because they won’t know it exists. \nAlso, remember that youneed toroleplay yourcharacter’sNegativeTraits.

While mages certainly fit into this generalization, they usually continue to \ndeal with day-to-day life in a fashion that most people would consider sensible given \nmages' unusual problems and powers. When someone suffers a serious mental disorder, \nthough, ithasadeleteriouseffectonhisentirepersonality.Suchaproblem,beitasubtle \ntwitch or a very noticeable psychosis, is known as a derangement. \nTaking a derangement grants you two additional Free Traits that count \nagainst your limit of five Negative Traits. Remember that taking derangements \nrequires advanced roleplaying. A character with a derangement has specific \npersonality problems and a very different outlook on living, all of which will \nI require you to think long and hard about how you present the mage. Talk to your \nStoryteller before you consider taking any derangement. \nDerangements are described in Chapter Five on p. 121. \nou can customize your mage to some degree using Free Traits. Your Free \n= Traits can improve just about any facet of your character, so you can improve your \nIf Abilities to represent a character with strong natural talent.

If your mage just had one Tradition specialty \nSphere, you get five additional levels of Spheres. Ifyour mage hadaTradition Sphere \nand a faction specialty Sphere, then you pick four additional Sphere levels. If your \nmage has no specialty Sphere, you can pick six levels of Spheres of your choice. \nRemember that no Sphere level can exceed your Arete Trait total. If you \nhave only one Arete Trait, you can have only the first levels of the various \nSpheres. See Chapter Four for information about all of the Spheres. \nSTEP FIVE: SPARK GF LIFE \nAt the end of Step Four, your mage should have a list of Traits and \ncapabilities. However, a good character isn’t just a collection of numbers and \nadjectives. Now it’s time to deepen the character’s story. Look into her motives, \nher history, her Awakening and the other details of her experience that turned \nher into the person she is today. \nHistory - \nConsider the mage’s pre-Awakening days. Did she have any \nspecial hopes and dreams that were inspired or dashed by the change? Does her family \nknow of her powers, or does she even contact her family members any more? Where \ndid she live, how did she grow up, and what sort of jobs and education has she had? \nSecrets -Come on, everyone has a few. Does your mage harbor a secret \nshame or desire?Does she regret what she’s become, or does she embrace it a little \ntoo passionately? Has she learned something better left buried, or does she \n4 \ndespise some aspect of her Tradition secretly? \nMotivation- Although all mages feel a call to pursue enlightenment, not \nevery mage does so in the same way. For some, this pursuit takes the form of \nhumanitarian action. For others, it’s a continued drive for personal goals. What \nmakes your mage get up and go? Does she want to help other people Awaken, or \nwould she protect them from that fate? Does she really believe in her Tradition’s \ndogma? Maybe she just moves as her fate takes her. Whatever form it takes, \nmotivation is the push or pull that helps the character go places and do things. \nAppearance - \nHow does your mage look? Is she disheveled and unkempt, \nor is she a shining gorgeous beauty? Does she have any distinctive features or \n1 1  \nmannerisms? People remember the Hermetic who wears tweed or the Verbena with i!5m \nthedazzling tattoo andseductivewalk, sopickacouple offeatures that willstandout. \nFoci-Your \nmage’s foci are very important to her magical technique, even \nthough you use no Traits to represent them. Without foci, your mage will be hard- \npressed to perform even the slightest tricks. What foci does your mage favor? Pick , it?:- \n‘ - \na special focus for each Sphere, and make sure to list the sorts of foci that your mage . 1, . \nI I ~  \nLi \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nuses. Checkout the list in Chapter Four for ideas. You can match up your foci with \nyour mage’s Abilities to get some hefty bonuses when casting spells. \nQuirks-Everyone has a few distinctive mannerisms. Your mage’s quirks can \nbe anything from giving your adversaries the finger right before you escape to keeping \npictures of cats on everything you own. A quirk can help distinguish you from an \nimposter, or you could try to copy someone else’s mannerisms should the need arise. \nARCH~PES \nAn Archetype describes a fundamental personality characteristic. The Arche- \ntypes provide specific examples of what motivates an individual. Naturally, most \nhumans are sums of multiple (sometimes conflicting) drives, but the Archetypes \nrepresent the strongest, most visible or important part of a personality. A character’s \nNature Archetype describes the individual’s inner drives and desires, while the \nDemeanor represents the face that the character presents to the world at large. \nBecause it represents her most important and dearly held impulses, a \ncharacter’s Nature provides insight into her plans and serves to reinforce her \nconviction. Should acharacter be affected by some sort ofmind-influencing power \nthat violates her Nature, you gain an automatic free retest to resist that power by \ncalling upon that Nature. Conversely, if someone guesses your character’s Nature \nand uses it in a challenge to convince your character to do something in line with \nthat Nature, then you must risk an additional Trait in that challenge. \nIn certain circumstances, a Storyteller may rule that you regain a Trait of \nWillpower if you perform some suitably arduous task in keeping with your \nNature. This reward can be difficult to track or adjudicate fairly, though, so it \ndoesn’t always apply. You won’t gain Willpower simply by spouting rhetoric or \nperforming little acts that pay lip service to your Nature. It’s only by rediscov- \nering your purpose through trials and exertions that you reaffirm your drive. \nExample: Ulfston, a mge with the Caregiver Nature, finds himself in a conflict \nwith a Master of Mind who’s trying to invade hs psyche. Convinced that a certain child \nI has a strong destiny that must be avoided, the Master tries to force Ulfston to slaughter \nf that child. They mke achalknge, and Ulfston’splayer loses. However, Ulfston’splayer \nI announces thutheisahzleCaregiverwho wouldnevercommitsuchanatro~ousact. The \ntworetest, and Ulfstonwins. Heis abk tofightofftheMaster’scom mands...for now. \nLater, once Ulfston has dealt with the threat, he takes the child to his friend \nAnneke for help. Anneke says that she just doesn’t have the resources to take care \nof a child right now, but she can give him some money if he can look after the child. \nShe makes a Social Challenge to convince Ulfston that this is the right thing to \ndo. Furthermore, she ups the stakes by using Ulfston’sNature against him (“I know \nthat you are a true Caregiver. You would never let this poor child down.”). \nUlfston’s player must now bid an additional Social Trait. They test, and Ulfston \nloses. He realizes that he can’t simply leave the child alone, so he takes the child \nwith him, bewildered as to how they’ll survive. He checks into a hotel for the \n6 moment and takes the child to get some food, then spends some time trying to \nfigure out how to help educate and protect the orphan. Due to his concern and care \n(which takes a great deal of time and effort), the Storyteller rules that Ulfston \nreinforces his Caregiver Nature, and regains a Trait of Willpower. \nArchitect - \nYou hope to leave a lasting legacy, a spark of inspiration or \nchange that passes down through the ages. \n6 \nas \n: \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAutocrat - \nYou take charge, either to impose order or to foment chaos. \nBon Vivant - \nSybaritic pleasures and temptations are your stock in trade. \nBravo -You \nwhip others into shape by force of strength or personality. \nCaregiver -The gifts of Awakening allow you to help the needy and \nCelebrant - \nAwakening has only strengthened your ebullient spirit. \nChild-Youarenafve and dependent, either by choice or by lack of experience. \nCompetitor - \nYou strive to come out on top in any circumstances. \nConformist-Nosensebuchg authority; you follow trends andsupport leaders. \nConniver - \nWhy work for something when you can get it more easily \nCurmudgeon - \nThe world’s gone to hell, and you want nothing more \nDeviant - \nYou’re so far outside the norm, you can’t even spot “normal” \nDirector - \nOrderly structures and predictable hierarchies make life \nFanatic - \nSome cause or passion calls to you and drives you to the limits \nGallant - \nYou love to be the center of attention, and you make sure \nJudge - \nSeparating truth from falsehood and justice from anarchy is your \nLoner - \nEven among a crowd of people you feel alone. \nMartyr - \nYou’ll give of yourself until there’s nothing left out of a morbid \nMasochist - \nYou inflict pain upon yourself to test your limits or out of \nMonster - \nYou are the evil that stalks the nights. \nPedagogue -Not only do you know a lot about everything, you’re more \nPenitent - \nYou feel a need to atone for some real or imagined slight. \nPerfectionist - \nGood just isn’t good enough for you. \nRebel -Tear down the system before it swallows you up.

In this moment, the \nAvatar stirs and becomes the connection between a mage and the Tapestry. A \nmage works magic through his Avatar, and the Avatar holds memories and drives \nfrom many former incarnations. It also connects the mage to Resonance from age- \nold spells and memories of legendary times past. A mage’s Avatar guides him with \nsubtle emotions, shocking visions or blatant spiritual manifestations. \nIt is widely believed that the Avatar guides the mage throughout his magical \ngrowth toward eventual Ascension. However, not all Avatars are equal. Some \nhave stronger drives, some have very individual motives, and some are satisfied \nonly if the mage overcomes deep personal difficulties or fulfills dangerous quests. \nUltimately the Avatar’s essential drive, determines how it interacts with the \nmage and to what ends it drives him. \nOf course, the Avatar -be \nit soul, spirit, guardian angel, subconscious \ndesire, whatever - \nrarely interacts directly with a mage. Only a rare few mages \nhave Avatars that make themselves known deliberately. For most mages, the \nAvatar appears in dreams and sudden intuitive hunches or emotions. \nIn game terms, the Avatar Essence describes the Avatar’s goals and methods. \nEach mage has one Avatar Essence, which in turn shows the Avatar’s specific \nrelation to the cosmos. Typically, this Essence becomes most clear during Seekings \n(see p. 122). When a mage undergoes a Seeking, a Quiet or some other highly \ncharged encounter with the Avatar, the Essence makes itself evident. \nAn Avatar’s Essence determines in part the requirements of a Seeking. \nAlthough a Seeking often forces a mage to confront unexplored or unsavory \nelements of his personality in order to achieve a more enlightened understanding of \nhimself, the requirements of his Avatar’s Essence always surface in a Seeking as well. \n’ \nThe four known Essences are: \nDYNAr€IIC ESSENCE \nYour Avatar strivesfor changeat all times. It delights inallmanner ofrandom, \nwhirling, creative exploration, be it increating new things, coming up withunique \nideas or just pushing you to experience things you’ve never done before. \nWhen you engage in a Seeking, your Avatar requires you to have done \nsomething totally new. If you haven’t had a new experience or learned some- \nthing completely new since your last Seeking (such as a new Ability, for \ninstance), then you will not be able to satisfy the impulses of this Essence. \nYour Avatar desires to reinforce existing structures or build up coherent \nmodels. You find yourself drawn to the beauty in order, and you are sometimes \ncompelled to defend or elaborate on known principles and beliefs. \nWhen you engage in a Seeking, you must somehow reinforce an existing \nstructure. You can do so in any number of ways, including helping to raise a \nbuilding, elaborating on a scientific theory or improving one of your own areas \nofknowledge (such as by gaining new levels in an Ability that you already have). \nYour Avatar springs from the original, primordial soup of Creation. Therefore, \nthis Essence revels in death, rebirth and the bubbling chaos of beginnings and endings. \nI ‘ \n: . ~lUlTICI3RDIAL‘kENCE \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nWhen you engage in a Seeking, you must have tom down something old to \ncreate something new. You might have to destroy an old bureaucracy, tear down \nan ancient tradition or rediscover some fundamental principle of existence \n(such as by remaking yourself through an improvement in your Attributes). \n@JESTING ESSENCE \nYour Avatar pushes you toward distant goals, and builds upon past experi- \nences to raise you to new heights. You find yourself pursuing accomplishment at \nall times and learning from old tasks. \nWhen you engage in a Seeking, you must have built on some previous \nexperience to accomplish something. You may have to redo an old task using \nknowledge that you’ve mastered, but you may have to perform it on some larger \nscale that requires a great depth of proficiency. (Gaining a specialization in an \nAbility is one way to represent such a goal.) \nATTRIBUTES \n[BIDDING TRAITS] \nRepresenting your character’s innate capabilities is the purview of Attributes. \nThese Traits are natural to the character, and although they can be improved with \npractice and exercise, they’re not trained or learned capabilities. They’re simply \na measure of raw performance. You call upon your Attributes to accomplish tasks \nand determine your inborn human gifts. The more Attribute Traits you have, the \nbetter you are in an area. With lots of Physical Traits, for instance, you’re very \nstrong and fast and tough, and you’re better able to perform physical feats. \nWhen you find yourself in a challenge situation during game play, you use \nAttributes as a means to resolve it. For instance, you might need to use your \nbrains to solve a complex ancient riddle posed by an adversary. You would use \na Mental Trait such as Clever to initiate the challenge, showing that your \ncharacter is using his wits to overcome his opponent. The type of Trait you use \ndepends on the type of challenge, of course. Being strong doesn’t help you solve \nriddles, but it would be useful in aclose-quarters fight. Having agood appearance \nand a magnetic personality is great for impressing new acquaintances, but it \nwon’t help you evade a kick in the crotch. \nThe specific nature of the challenge further limits what Traits within one \nAttribute category apply. When you want to break down a door, you use a \nBrawny Trait or other Strength-related Trait, not Quick or Dexterous. Similarly, \nyou would want to be Dignified or Elegant at a gala social event, not Intimldating \nor Ingratiating. However, you can use any Trait that you and the challengers \nmutually agree are appropriate. You should try to pick Traits that are descriptive \nof what you’re doing, though. \nWhen you enter a challenge with a Trait, you risk some of your capabilities. \nIf you lose the challenge, you’ll get tired or discouraged, you’ll use up some of your \ntricks, or you’ll just become too fatigued to care. As a result, you temporarily lose \nthat Trait that you bid. This lost Trait doesn’t retum until the next game session. \nSometimes you’ll enter a challenge “Traits up” or “Traits down.” If you are \nTraits down when enteringchallenges, then you must risk additional Traits just to \nmake a test (before taking Negative Traits into account), and you lose them all \nif you fail that challenge. Conversely, you could be Traits up or down on the \nresolution of a challenge. In this case, you count as having additional or fewer \nTraits when you compare Trait totals in the event of a tied test or an overbid. \n‘ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe Trait listings that follow include some run-downs of what Traits are \nappropriate for certain types of challenges. You can ignore them if you desire, \nsince some weird situations may make different Traits appropriate for certain \ntypes of challenges. Ideally, though, you should bid Traits from categories \nappropriate to the challenge at hand. Doing so helps to describe the action and \ngive you a feel for the different ways that characters handle problems. \nNew players may simply use a pool of generic Traits, just to speed play. \nEventually, when they get the hang of things, you can help them to pick out \nmore specific Traits that are appropriate to the action. \nSee Chapter Five for descriptionsandexampleiofhow t o w  Attributes inchallenges. \nPHYSICAL TRAITS \nStrength-related: Brawny, Ferocious, Stalwart, Tough, Wiry \nDexterity-related: Dexterous, Graceful, Lithe, Nimble, Quick \nStamina-related: Enduring, Resilient, Robust, Rugged, Tireless \nMiscellaneous Physical: &le, Brutal, Energetic, Steady, Tenacious, Vigorous \nAgile: You have a well-honed and flexible body.

Ability Traits represent capabilities that a \ncharacter might learn or develop. They aren't necessarily innate to human \nnature, but rather they stem from study and practice study. With the right \nAbilities, a character can perform various sorts of difficult tasks, and he has a \nbetter chance of success even with mundane problems. \nIfyourcharacterfailsachallenge,you~useanAbili~foraretestand~ \ntosnatch \nvictory from the jaws of defeat. You use up the Ability Trait until the next game session \n(you exhaust part of your repertoire of tricks), and you still lose the initial Attribute \nTrait(s) you bid for the challenge, but you may be able to win the challenge itself. \nMultiple levels of Abilities reflect a character's growing competence. Few \npeople exceed three levels of any Ability. Such dedication and professional skill \ndoesn't come easily, and many people simply don't have the necessary talent and \ndedication. Even most mages can't exceed the limits of human knowledge, \nwhich peaks at five levels of Ability. The total level of Ability in a given field \ncorresponds roughly to the character's professional capabilities: \nCompetent (Able to earn a living) \nProfessional (Licensed, capable of supervision) \nJourneyman (Bachelor's degree or instructor) \nExpert (Master's degree or researcher) \nMaster (Doctorate or true innovator) \nBecause of the highly skilled nature of some fields, certain tasks may be \nimpossible without a given Ability. In such a case, a character without the \n' requisite Ability, or who has used up all of his levels of that Ability for the \nsession, cannot even attempt the feat. Usually, though, attempting a task based \non a prerequisite Ability does not use up an available Trait. Only using the \nAbility for a retest exhausts it. \nIf you use an Ability for a set problem or scenario (such as trying to hack a \ncomputer with the Computer Ability), the Storyteller sets the difficulty of the task \nin question. Such a task is usually a Static Challenge, and it often requires that you \n' bid a Trait or sometimes multiple Traits. You may or may not know the difficulty \nbeforehand, but such is the riskofdiving headlong into difficult or dangerous tasks. \nShould you use an Ability in a challenge against another player, the Ability \nmay have certain special characteristics, as described on the following pages. See \nChapter Five for examples of using Abilities in challenges. \n% \n~ \nfbCUSED &ILITIES \nLearning some Abilities requires concentrated study in particular areas. \nOne cannot simply study all forms of Crafts, for instance. That's just too broad \na subject. In such a case, you must pick a focus for the Ability. Each such focus \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nis considered a separate Ability, so Academics: Art History is distinct from \nAcademics: Theology. You don’t add the total levels you have in every Ability, \nbut you could have up to five levels in each focused Ability. \nThis rule functions only if you’re willing to put up with a little ex \npaperwork on your charucter’s Abilities and you feel comfortable coming up \nspecifications that aren’t too broad ur too narrow. \nDedicated practitioners often develop highly concentrated ski1 \ncertain facets of that Ability to greater effect. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAcademics \nYou possess a level of education and general knowledge beyond rudimen- \ntary schooling. With Academics, you can express artistic criticism, debate the \nclassics, consider philosophy and indulge in studies of culture. This broad \nAbility covers the humanities in learning. \nAcademics allows you to recognize historical, artistic and cultural refer- \nences. You can use Academics when working in such fields, when developing a \ncritique or when researching. Calling on the Academics Ability may require a \nMental or Social Challenge to determine your exact level of competence. \nYou should choose a focus in a specific field of Amhics, such as LiterahL.r, \nPhhsophy, Mu.skAppreciationor anything that could be studied with a higher education. \nAlertness \nYou pay attention to your surroundings. Even if your senses aren’t particu- \nlarly good, you know enough to put together clues and scrutinize things going \non around you. \nYou use Alertness in conjunction with your Perception-related Mental \nTraits to notice sounds, detect things that are out of place and spot concealed \nobjects or people. \nWhen you’re surprised (see p. 193), you may spend one level of Alertness to \nnegate the surprise penalty and act normally instead. \nAthletics \nWhether due to a background in sports or just personal talent, you are skilled in \nall manner of athletic endeavors. You can throw a ball, sprint, climb, jump and swim. \nYour Athletics Ability applies to retests on most forms of raw physical activity \nincluding: acrobatics, swimming, jumping, throwing, climbing and running. You \nmay choose to focus on one sport or activity. Use Athletics in conjunction with \nthrown or hand-propelled weapons like bows and hurled knives. \nAwareness \nYou have a talent for knowing when things are not as they should be, whether \nby that strange feeling in the pit of your gut or through tested observation. This \nAbility is particularly useful for sensing when other supernatural creatures are \nabout, detecting evidence of strange magical phenomena, or just getting that \nweird feeling when the laws of nature are about to take a hard left. \nAwareness challenges usually pit your Mental Traits against a Static \nChallenge determined by a Narrator. If someone performs a magical Effect with \nno visible result, you can call for an Awareness challenge with a difficulty of six \nTraits minus the Effect’s casting difficulty before modifiers (minimum zero for \na really big Effect). If you succeed, you know that something magical happened, \nalthough you don’t necessarily know what it was. Actually figuring out the \nproperties of something magical may require other Abilities such as Occult. \nBrawl \nBack alleys, martial arts schools and rough bars are your stomping grounds. \nYou might have military training, or maybe you just grew up with a passel of \nrough-and-tumble siblings. Whatever the case, you know how to dish out the \ndamage with your fists and your feet. \nUse the Brawl Ability for retests in combat when you are using your natural \nweapons (teeth and fists, or even magically grown claws and appendages). This \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAbility is also the province of the martial arts, although you should specify which \nart your character performs when you take this Ability. \nAkashic Brothers may take a specialization of Do when using Brawl. With \nthe Do specialization, the Akashic Brother may choose to inflict lethal damage \nin unarmed combat, instead of scoring bashing damage (see p. 191). \nComputer \nWith the Computer Ability, you understand how to use, program and access \ncomputers of all sorts. Since computer technology facilitates Virtual Adept \ntechnomagic and serves all sorts of roles in the Technocracy, this Ability is very \nhandy for a cutting-edge modem magician to have. \nUse Computer with a Mental Challenge (difficulty determined by the \nStoryteller) to break into systems, alter data, write programs or figure out \nunfamiliar computer operations. \nCosmology \nThe Tellurian is vast and full of mysteries, but some of those mysteries are \nclear to you. Whether through hearsay or personal experience, you know of \nmany fantastic places and creatures throughout the cosmos. \nWhen you encounter a strange Realm, a mystical Node or an unknown spirit, \nyou use your Cosmology Ability to puzzle out its nature. Usually doing so calls for \na Mental Challenge with a difficulty determined by the Storyteller. By expending \na Cosmology Trait, you can determine the strength of a Node or how powerful a \nspirit is. Additional information relies on challenges and your ability to roleplay \nthrough the process of dealing with alien places and changeable entities. \nCrafts \nYou can build things. Depending on your area of expertise, you know how \nto manufacture items and make handy tools or decorations. You must choose a \nfocus for Crafts, specifying your preferred form of creation. Carpenny, Clock- \nworks, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking and the like are all possibilities. You can \nfashion works of art by studying Painting, Drawing or similar physical media. \nCrafts also covers more technical skills, such as Mechanics and Electronics. \nMaking or repairing an item with Crafts usually involves a Physical \nChallenge of your dexterity, with a difficulty set by the Storyteller based on the \ntype of job. Making a concealed spring-loaded trap is far more difficult than \nplaning a board, for instance. Making a work of art may require Mental Traits \ninstead, such as when you draw a precise map or devise an electrical design. \nDodge \nWhen trouble rears its ugly head, you know how to get out of its way. ; \nUnhesitating reactions let you evade blows and gunshots, getting aside just in \ntime to avoid injury. You can use Dodge against any attack that you're aware of. \n1 \nYou can dive for cover as someone fires a gun or twist away from a sword before ' \nit bisects your spine, for instance. You may use the Dodge Ability as a retest when ! \ndefending against an attack that you can see or sense coming. \nDrive \nAlthough most people can drive in the modern age, you can drive well. You \nare equally at home with a manual or automatic transmission, rush hour is no \nconcern, and you can eke the most performance out of your car. In dangerous \nsituations, you can evade traffic and even use your vehicle as a weapon. Bear in \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmind, though, that just because you can drive a station wagon doesn't mean you \ncan drive an 18-wheeler with equal ease. A Mental Challenge may be necessary \nto allow you to figure out where everything is in an unfamiliar vehicle. \nDrive tests most often involve a Physical Challenge of your reflexes. \nEnigmas \nPuzzles, riddles and problems are your hobby and passion. Whether you're \nworking on the morning crossword or translating an ancient scrawl in a buried \ntomb, you have a penchant for coming up with unusual solutions, answering \nmystical conundrums and solving all manner of brain-twisters. \nYou use Enigmas most often with a Mental Challenge to help figure out a \npuzzle of some sort. Of course, the Ability alone shouldn't substitute for all of the \nroleplaying involved in working out the puzzle. However, when you are trying \nto work out a riddle or other such challenge, your Enigmas Ability allows you to \ndouble any given time limit for each Trait expended, or to make an extra guess \nfor each Trait expended. \nEtiquette \nMages have their own arcane rules and regulations for society, above and \nbeyond the concerns of normal human manners. You know the proper way to greet \nsomeone, when to rise and how to make introductions, and you can even tell the \ndifference between a salad fork and a dinner fork. You can make a toast with the best \nof them, and you keep your cool in any social scenario, from high tea to a gang's rally. \nThe Etiquette Ability can supplement Social Tests to impress or blend in at \nparties. If you make a social faux pas, you may expend an Etiquette Trait immediately \nto negate the gaffe -your \ncharacter knew better than to make the mistake. Note, \nc however, that this rule applies only to (reasonably) normal human social interac- \ne tions. Human etiquette is of little use when dealing with puzzling Umbrood or \ncenturies-old Archmages who have transcended human comprehension. \nExpression \nWords and feelings flow freely from you. When the muse strikes, you put \n; pen to paper (or fingers to musical instrument) and pour out a torrent of emotion \nand stirring imagery. You can convey message and meaning in your art, from \nsymphonies to poetry, and whatever you write is both clear and moving. \nWhen writing or composing, you can sink Expression Traits into the work. \nDoing so typically denotes some level of quality. Professional poets, writers and \nmusicians often use three or more levels to make their best material. \nFirearms \nA little time at the gun range goes a long way. You know how to hold, fire \nand clean a gun. You can unjam one too, and you can tell different models apart. \nYou know how to stand to get the best aim, how to handle recoil and how to take \ncare of problems in the field. \nIf you possess the Firearms Ability, you use your Mental Traits for gun \ncombat instead of using Physical Traits. You can expend Firearms for a retest in \nranged-fire combat withpistols, rifles, shotguns, crossbows and similar weapons. \nHobby/Professional/Expert Ability \nIn a certain area of expertise not covered by another Ability, you have \nachieved some level of skill. You may have a small grasp of a trade due to some \nwork on the side, or perhaps you've studied a topic specifically. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nHobby/ProfessidExpert Ability is a catch-all category for unusual Abilities \nsuch as Mage h e ,  Hypnotism, Explosive Ordnance Disposal and so on. The Storyteller \nmust approve any Ability of this type specifically and define its capabilities. \nIntimidation \nIntimidation represents any of a broad variety of techniques used for terrifying \npeople into compliance. Using Intimidation could rely on anything from physical \nsize, to a particularly frightening grin, to knowing which emotional buttons to \npush. Note that Intimidation generally covers the threat of force. Actual applica- \ntions of violence fall under Brawl, Meke, or Professional Ability: Torture. \nYou can use Intimidution in conjunction with a Social Challenge in order to scare \nsomeone. Victims may flee or give up information at the Storyteller’s discretion. \nInvestigation \nYou know how to pick up clues and put together disparate pieces of information. \nBy habit and training, you can set a jumbled mass of data into order, discovering \nidentities,motivesandpattemsinanothenvisechaotlcscene.YoucanuseIn~tigation \nwith a Mental Challenge to puzzle out meaning to a random series of events, to spot \nwhen someone is carrying a concealed weapon or to find a clue at a crime scene. \nLaw \nNobody is above the law, except those who know how to use it to their \nadvantage. You’re one of those people. Perhaps you uphold the law, or maybe \nyou have been on the wrong side of it so often that you’ve picked up a few tricks. \nYour knowledge of Law allows you to understand legal processes, courts and \nlawyers, and to use and twist them effectively to your own ends. \nUse the Law Ability in court situations or with Social Challenges involving \nlegal matters. Because the legal body is so vast, your Storyteller may require you \nto select a focus of legal expertise such as Criminal Law, Civil Law or Tax Law. \nAlternatively, you may choose to study Tradition Law in depth. \nLeadership \nA good speaking voice and self-confidence lend a powerful presence to a \nleader. Leadership represents your ability to motivate people and convince them \nto follow your guidance. Even among those who do not know or respect you, you \ncan demand attention. \nYou can use Leadership with a Social Challenge to try to get a minor favor \nor task from a character. \nLinguistics \nYou’ve studied a language - \nor languages - \nother than your native tongue. \nWhether you’re a scholastic mage whose Tradition relies on special magical words or \nyour skill is necessary for other studies, you can speak, write and read other languages. \nYou must choose one language for each Trait of Linguistics you possess. Each , \nlanguage is a separate focus. Therefore, you could have Linguistics: Cantonese and \nI \nLinguistics: German. Alternatively, you can focus on the underlying study of \na t  \nLinguistics itself, granting some understanding of the principles behind the 6 \nstructure of language. Languages need not be spoken; American Sign Language \nor Egyptian hieroglyphics are also fields of linguistic study. \nThose who wish to converse in another language (but cannot actually do \nso) should hold up one hand with the first finger and thumb making an L-shape Fa,-’ \n- \nto indicate to other players that the characters are speaking a different language \n,‘I. \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthan those around them. Those who wish to listen in must also possess that \nlanguage or a means of comprehending it. \nYou know how the human body functions. You can speed the recovery and \nhealing of an injured person, or you can use your knowledge to inflict injury. \nMany mages learn just enough to assist their magical healing or to create harmful \ncoincidental Effects. \nYou can use the Medicine Ability to speed a person's healing by one category. \nA Wounded person would heal as if he were only Bruised, for instance (taking less \ntime to actually become Bruised, and then recovering very rapidly from there). \nMedicine may be used for other sorts of research and lab work with a Mental \nChallenge. Since Medicine represents such a vast field, your Storyteller may require \nyou to specify a focus, such as Pharmaceuticals, Internal Medicine or General Practice. \nRegardless of distraction or injury, you're quite skilled at focusing your \nthoughts. You put aside extraneous concerns and chaos, and center all of your \nattention inward instead. In this way, you can rest peacefully or organize your \nthoughts even under duress. \nYou can expend a Meditation Ability Trait to make up for a lost hour of sleep \n(in case your mage really needs to finish a ritual or he has already been up way \ntoo long). You can also use Meditation with a Mental Challenge to reach a trance \nstate in which your mage can ignore injury or distraction. (In doing so, for \ninstance, he may avoid taking a penalty on a challenge of E n i w  by focusing \nand ignoring the diversions of his surroundings.) \nIf you've got something in your hands, you're a deadly fighter. Be it a sword, a \nstick or a set of nunchaku, you can use it to damaging effect. Expend Melee for retests \nin hand-to-hand combat when you are using a close-combat weapon such as a knife \nor a chair. Certain weapons function best when wielded by a character with Melee. \nThe hidden world teems with mysterious secrets. By unlocking universal \nkeys and studying the basics of spirituality, you can learn the shadowy paths of \nthe supernatural. Your Occult Ability serves as a general knowledge of the \no the existence of many sorts of inhuman creatures \nbasic (and sometimes erroneous) knowledge of the \nt : various denizens of the supernatural world. For more detailed information, study \nExpert Ability: Lore in your particular subject of interest. The Occult Ability \ndoesn't substitute for a mage's paradigm, of course. Each practitioner has his or \nher own beliefs, and Occult operates more as a general knowledge of the sorts of \nprinciples that are widely given credence in paranormal circles. \n, \nbe \nI \nI \n: \nPerformance \nYou are a true virtuoso. In your chosen medium, you have a gift for artistic \nendeavors. Whether you play an instrument, sing, dance or act, your skills allow \nyou to entertain and even to earn money. \nbility can earn you a modest income, just like other \nst choose a specific art form as a focus for Performance, \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsuch as playing an instrument, singing, acting or doing dramatic readings. Note \nthat Performance generally applies to art rendered before an audience, while \nExpression most often focuses on literary works or underlying emotions, and Crafts \nconcentrates on the creation of physical objects such as paintings or sculptures. \nScience \nThe Technocracy has broadened man’s understanding in hundreds of fields \nof study. Categorizing and breaking down the world into many different forms, the \nmethods of logic and reason give sentient beings the means to understand the \nuniverse one piece at a time. Education in Science covers techniques of inquiry, \nmodem studies and a broad scope of foundational work in a diverse range of fields. \nScience Ability requires a focus. Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Metallurgy, \nMathematics and Cognitive Science are all possibilities, but this list if far from \ncomprehensive. Combining the Science Ability with different fields may yield a \nwide variety ofresults. For example, Science: Metallurgy with Academics may give \nresults regarding historical research and theory, while the same Science with \nOccult may center around ancient alchemical techniques. Actually construct- \ning objects or devices based on scientific theories may require the use of the \nCrafts or Technology Abilities. \nUsing a particular branch of Science usually requires a Mental Challenge of \nsome sort to determine the success of research or the viability of theoretical work. \nStealth \nBy blending into cover, blurring your lines and moving carefully and quietly, \nyou can evade notice or sneak past people. You know how best to take advantage of \nsurrounding cover and how to use light and shadow. Opportunities for unnoticed \nmovement are not lost on you, as you understand the uses of timing and diversion. \nWith an appropriate Physical Challenge, you can sometimes sneak past the \nnotice of guards and searchers (who contest your Ability with their Mental \nTraits and Investigation Ability). \nStreetwise \nYou’re no stranger to the word on the street. Even if you don’t have any \nparticular friends or contacts in the area, you know about the different commu- \nnities and gangs that hang out in town. You recognize tags and other territorial \nmarkers, and you know some of the signs, colors and clothes that denote street \npeople, gangers, hoodlums, criminals and social workers. \nUsing the Streetwise Ability with your Mental Traits lets you recognize the \ninfluence of various gangs or street communities. You also know about criminal \norganizations and activities, and you could perform a little larceny yourself. An \nappropriate Social Challenge can help you smooth dealings with a hostile gang, \nbut you may need Etiquette to make a really good impression. \nSubterfuge \n- \nEven in idle conversation, people use little white lies, slip hints about their \ntrue motives, try to guide the course of discussion and give away their secrets \nindirectly. The art of Subterfuge is the art of reading these tells and using them \nagainst the person who lets them slip. \nWhen someone confronts you with one of your own lies, you can use the \nSubterfuge Ability in your defense. By guiding a conversation, you can unearth \nsomeone’s Negative Traits. If you manage to steer conversation to a particular \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ntopic in play, you can expend a Subterfuge Ability Trait and make a Social \nChallenge to determine one of the subject’sNegative Traits related to the topic. \nSurvival \nThe Survival Ability represents a knowledge of terrain, how to find shelter, \nwhere to find water, techniques in hunting, edible and poisonous plants and fungi \nand so on. Although most mages still avail themselves of modem conveniences, \nquite a few Traditionalists travel the wilderness and subsist on its bounty. \nHunting and avoiding danger in the wilderness usually relies on a Physical \nChallenge. If you have the Survival Ability, you can substitute your Mental \nTraits for such a challenge if you so desire. \nTechnology \nYou know all about high-tech gadgetry, devices, machines and toys. \nWhether building, repairing or just figuring the infernal contraptions out, you \nhave a good sense of how such mechanisms work, be they televisions, microwave \novens or sprinkler systems. \nWith the Technology Ability, you can puzzle out most technical devices. \nYou understand all manner of electrical and mechanical engineering, material \nwork and even a little bit of hotwiring. You are equally able to program a DVD \nplayer or install an alarm. You can also use Technology to circumvent such \ndevices, which can be very handy in defeating Technocratic security. Use \nMental Traits for such challenges. \nBACKGRGXJNDS \nALLIES \nOld friends, magical heritages and the web of favors and social maneuvers fall \ninto the category of Backgrounds. These Traits describe your character’s place in \nmundane and magical society in terms of personal standing or mystical power. \nA few friends, either left over from your pre-Awakened days or made \nafterward, help you out in your endeavors. You can make a few calls and cut a \nfew deals to find assistance in a wide range of activities. Your Storyteller will \nprobably require you to define how you keep your allies and their relations to you. \nEach Allies Trait represents one person whom you can call upon for aid. \nUnlike Influence, your allies have special talents that make them better than the \naverage person on the street. Although your allies may not be aware of your \nmagical skills, they can be quite useful if you direct them properly. \nIn general, your allies do not show up in play directly. Instead, you use them \nfor certain services between play sessions by notifying your Storyteller: \nAn ally can follow up on research or activities that you have started. If you \nundertook a specific task previously, such as tailing someone, researching a \nproject or building a device, your allies can continue the work with one Ability \nTrait’s worth of expertise. As long as your allies work on the project, your Allies \nTraits for the individuals are tied up. \nIf you need a particularly competent ally, you can expend multiple Traits \nto gain access to a person with multiple levels of an Ability or Influence. Each AUies \nTrait that you spent after the first gives an extra level of expertise to your ally. The \nally may use this expertise on your behalf - \nalthough rarely with your skill - \nand \nhe will help only as long as you tie up your Allies Background Traits in this manner. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAn ally can help you hide, find a Node or look for signs of magic, although \nobviously it’snot always a g d  idea to tell him too much about the magical world. Each \nTraitofAlliesthatyouuseth~letsyoumakeaSimpleTest.AwingrantsyouoneTrait \noffas. Doingsocountsasaprojectthatlastsfortheentire timebetweengamesessions. \nBe wary of calling on your allies too often. An ally may call on you for mutual \naid or refuse to help you perform dangerous or illegal activities. \nARCANE \nSome mages are merely sneaky, but others have a preternatural ability to \navoid detection. A mage with the Arcane Background is one of the latter, gifted \nwith the capability of slipping through the cracks and skating through existence \nunidentified. Since many mages run afoul of all manner of enemies (the Technoc- \nracy, supernatural monsters, the IRS), this Background proves extremely useful. \nAny time you complete a scene (say, at the conclusion of a fight, after \nrunning from a location or having just finished a meeting) you may expend one \nof your Arcane Traits to cause everyone involved to forget and lose all record of \neither your name or your face. (You may spend two Arcane Traits to make them \nforget both.) You must do so immediately upon concluding the scene, for you \ncannot retroactively cause someone to forget you later. When you spend an \nArcane Trait thus, all of the appropriate records of your character just vanish \nfrom that scene. The camera that should have recorded you had a technical \nproblem, the interviewer just couldn’t remember your name and forgot to jot it \ndown, the computer crashed.. . whatever it takes. This Background has no game \neffect other than removing records of your character. You can’t, for instance, \ndecide how your Arcane will wipe out records and decide to use it in a fashion \nthat would hit other people’s records or some other important information. It \nworks only on you. Even subjects with benefits like Mind magic or a photo- \ngraphic memory lose track of your character’s personal information inexplicably. \nArcane may hide your identity, but it doesn’t cover your actions. Even if \nsomeone can’t remember who you are or what you look like, a victim will \ncertainly remember your spells, your attacks, your crazed behavior or the \ndangerous information that you passed along. \nYour Arcane works only at your behest. Your friends don’t suddenly forget \nyour name. Arcane Traits refresh each game session. \nI \nAVATAR \nEvery mage has a spirit, a soul, an inner voice, a guardian angel or some \notherwise mysterious force that ties him to the cosmos, and mages refer to this \nforce as the Avatar. Indeed, many mages theorize that every single human being \nhas an Avatar. However, the mage’s strength lies in the Awakening, which \ncauses his Avatar to stir and become a force for change on the Tellurian. The \npower of that Avatar impacts your mage’s ability to channel Quintessence, the i. \nmost primal force of energy in the cosmos. \nYour Avatar Background has two main important effects. \nFirstly, your mage can refresh Quintessence Traits equal to the Avatar rating \nautomatically by spending time at a Node. You need only win a Mental Challenge \nusing the Meditation Ability each game hour in order to refresh one Quintessence \nTrait until you reach an amount equal to the Aetata~ Trait total. However, you do , rCl, \nnot gain anything if you already have equal or more Quintessence Traits than . \nh ,  . \nsb \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAvatar Traits. Quintessence gained in this fashion is considered personal Quintes- \nsence, and it cannot be stolen from you by anything short of an Archmage of Prime. \nSecondly, you can spend Quintessence only up to a limit of your Avatar \nTrait rating each turn. If you have one Avatar Trait, you can spend only one \nQuintessence Trait each turn. If you do not have the Avatar Background, you \ncannot spend personal Quintessence at all. However, you can still use Prime to \ntransfer it to other people or sources, or to use it from Tass. \nAt the Storyteller’s discretion, your mage’s Avatar rating may affect his \nSeekings. A strong Avatar (many Traits in the Background) will almost \ncertainly guide a Seeking more strongly and personally. \nWith the right contacts in all walks of life, you can get a line on all sorts of \nuseful information. Although having an ear to the wall doesn’t necessarily \nprovide you with good help or loyal servants, it does mean that you know who \nto ask when looking for the movers and shakers behind the scenes. \nIn game terms, your rating in Contacts allows you to pick up rumors and \ninformation. When you call on your contacts, you make a few phone calls, check \nwithlikelysnitchesandgreaseafewpalms. Inreturn, youget rum0 rsandinformation \nas if possessed of a certain amount of Influence. Doing so lets you find out exactly \nwhat isgoingon inthecitywithinaparticulararea.Youcanget informationofalevel \nequal to how ever many contacts you use. If you use Contacts x3 on Indwny, for \ninstance, you get information that h d w q  Influence x3 would yield. The advantage \nof the Contacts Background is that contacts can be switched from place toplace each \ngame, getting information in different areas at your demand. \nAt the discretion of a Storyteller, using Contacts to find especially dangerous or \nwell-guarded information may require your character to spend some money or perform \na few favors. On occasion, accidents can cause contacts in one area to dry up, such as \na strike that affects your lndus~ry contacts, or a particularly unlucky astronomical \nconjunction that sends your Occult contacts running for the hills. Your contacts will \nnot generally function as aides or lackeys; that is the purview of the& \nBackground. \nevon has Contacts x3. This month, he decides to check up with the \nversity Influence xl and Industry Influence x2, in order to see \nwhat’s happening in the worlds of technology. Next month he’ll change those to \nUnderworld and Street to see who he’d talk to about hiring some mwck to deal with \nthe sensitive information he gathered previously. \nSome people are fated for great callings - \nor terrible failures. With the Destiny \nBackground, you have some trial or famous circumstance in your future, an appoint- \nment for which you are almost sure to be present. You can still be killed or captured \n(since someone else might fulfill the terms of the destiny or that fate might be an \ninterpretation of your own destiny), but you are almost sure to take part in some great \nevent and to last long enough to get there. There’s no guarantee that your destiny is \nagoodthing, though, andyouusuallyknowofitonlyinthevaguestsense,sobeware.. .. \nOnce per game session per Trait of Destiny, you may make a Simple Test (win \nonly). If yousucceed, youregainone Wil1powerTrait.Youknowthat you’redestined \nfor some fate, and this knowledge helps you persevere even when the chips are down. \nHowever, a Storyteller can conversely declare that you have fulfilled your destiny if \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nyou accomplish some great (or ignominious) deed, and he may remove the \nBackground. He can also determine that some terrible battle is the culmination of \nyour destiny and deny the use of the Background at that time. Regaining Willpower \nTraits with Destiny is done at the beginning of your turn before you act. You can't \nspend Willpower, recoup it withDestiny, spend more and repeat the cycle. However, \nyou don't have to use up all of your Destiny Traits at once. \nDREAl-h \nBe it past lives, racial memories or universal subconscious, some mages have \nthe ability to tap into a wellspring of knowledge that hails from the cosmos itself. \nWith the Dream Background, you dive into this wisdom and draw forth useful \ninformation that may help in dire straits. \nOnce per game session, you can use your Dream Background to gather useful \ninformation from the universal subconscious. You may use your levels in Dream \nas levels in any one normal Ability of your choice, replacing your normal Ability. \nSo, for example, you might have one level of Melee but realize that you're fighting \na master swordsman. Calling upon Dream, you could replace that one Melee level \nwith a number of Melee Abilities equal to your Dream Traits. These Abilities last \nfor one scene or hour (whichever comes first) or until you use them up. \nAccessing Dream requires at least one full turn of uninterrupted concentration. \nINFLUENCE \nHuman society is built on institutions. Governments, guilds, orders and \nreligions all foster and promote themselves like living organisms. They grow and \nevolve just like the people who created them. When you have Influence, you can \nsway the direction of some areas of society, pushing communities to grow as you \ndirect. Your Influence can strike indirectly at your foes while protecting your \nown assets, or it can gain you information and special resources. \nInfluence comes in many different areas, so you must allocate Traits \nseparately to each Influence. Therefore, if you haveLegalx4, you could still have \nPolice x3 independently, but you would have to spend the Traits for each. \nYou cannot manage more Influence than the sum of your permanent \nPhysical, Social and Mental Traits combined. This limit counts against all of \nyour total Influence, so your combined levels cannot exceed this total. After all, \nthere are only so many things you can do in a day. \nWhen you exercise Influence, you expend temporary Influence Traits. The \ntables for various Influence areas detail what you can do with a specific number \nof Traits. Performing an action requires a number of Traits equal to the level of \nthe action. You must use three Traits to perform an action listed at the third level \nof an Influence chart, for instance. With high levels of Influence, you can \nperform many small actions or a few significant ones. \nCertain levels of Influence gift you with items, money or aides. Unlike the \nResources Background, money and equipment garnered with Influence does not \ncome automatically each month. If you want a steady income from Influence, you \nmust direct your Influence in that direction continually, and this income does not \ncome with any associated trappings of wealth. (You'd have to buy a house and car \nseparately, for instance). Aides garnered with Influence generally help with only \nI \none specific task, and they usually have the equivalent of only one level of Ability , ;,?\"- \n' - \nin their area of skill. For more competent and readily available help, take Allies. \n~ ,\". \n6' \n, \n4 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nMost cities have only a set amount of Influence in various areas. For \ninstance, Atlanta has a great deal of Transportation Influence, because it is a hub \nof travel, while Hollywood would have a lot of High Society and Media Influence. \nA rust-belt city where manufacturing and heavy industry has all but disappeared \nwould have very little to no Idustry Influence. \nStorytellers should map out the total amount of each type of Influence that exists \nin the city. Once all the Influence of a given type is used up, the only way to get more \nis to use Influence to grow that area of society, destroy someone else‘s Influence and \nthus free up those resources or acquire an adversary’s Influence in an area. Each city may \nalso have different reflections of the Influences listed here. A city with a thriving \nindependent film community is going to have a different picture of Media or High \nSociety than a city where the a m  are being literally starved out due to budget cuts. \nEach area of Influence has its own description. CertainTechnocratic agents \nand Master mages may possess truly far-reaching Influence, giving them power \nto exert control beyond the levels included here. \nBUWUCRACY \nYou can manage various government agencies and bureaus. By dealing with \nsocial programs and public servants, you can spin red tape, bypass rules and \nregulations or twist bureaucratic regimentation to your advantage.

(Fringe or alternative groups, \nf \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsuch as Scientologists, are the purview of the Occult Influence.) When you \nexercise Church Influence, you can change religious policy, affect the assign- \nment of clergy and access a variety of lore and resources.

Although your actual \navailable money comes from your Resources Background, you can use Finance \nInfluence to start or smother businesses, crush or support banking institutions \nand alter credit records.

Either way, such mages move in the circles of hospitals and \nHMOs. All of these sorts of research and development are the purview of Health \nInfluence.

Whilethereare toomany universalmysteries tocatalog \nthem all, many wise mages have recorded their findings and musings in various journals \nand materials designed to pass on their knowledge, keep it safe or just remind \nthemselves of key points. You happen to have some of those sorts of records. \nA magical library is an invaluable tool for research. Normally, developing \ngreater proficiency in a Sphere of magic requires quite a bit of study time (see p. \n137). With the Library Background, you can cut this time down thanks to your \nstudy materials and access to copious notes. For each Library Trait that you have, \nyou can shave one study session (generally, one game session) worth of time off \nthe period required to learn a Sphere level, down to a minimum of one session. \nYou must still pay the usual Experience Trait costs. \nOther people cannot benefit from your library unless you specifically assist \nthem, which ties up your use of the Library Trait for that study time. The notes and \nbooks are all organized in a personal fashion, and you need to be there to interpret \nthem, find the right materials and otherwise separate the chaff from the wheat. \nExample: Gregor wishes to improve his command of Forces. He has a modest \ntwo-Trait Library (or the equivalent of afew good books anda lot of disorganized notes \nand junk material). Forces isn’t his specialty Sphere, so learning the Initiate level will \ntake four game sessions (two per level). Using his Library Traits, though, Gregor \nlearns the magical principles in only two game sessions. \nfter you and comes to your aid \nassistance from your mentor, \nntor, you risk a certain number of Traits to \nne+Trait mentor probably knows only little \nmentor may well have luminous standing \nf potent powers.

Therefore, a rote requiring an Adept-level Sphere could be \ntaught by a mentor worth four Traits; a rote requiring two Initiate-level Spheres \nwould require a mentor worth three Traits (two for the Initiate level, one for \nhaving an extra Sphere). \nFor two Traits, you can borrow one level of Contacts, Influence, Resources \nor Reputation from your mentor for the duration of the game. If your mentor is \nvery powerful (four or five Traits), you can borrow two levels. \nTwo Traits allow your mentor to instruct you in an Initiate-level Sphere \nthat’s outside your specialty. \nFor three Traits, your mentor can instruct you in a Disciple-level Sphere \nthat’s outside your specialty. \nAlso at a cost of three Traits, your mentor can train you in the ways of a \nspecial Hobby/ Professional/ Expert Ability that is outside your normal ken, such \nas Vampire Lore. \nFor four Traits, your mentor can train you in an Adept-level Sphere \noutside your specialty. \nFor five Traits, your mentor can train you in a Master-level Sphere outside \nyour specialty. \nSince mentors can prove unbalancing by providing too many different \npowers over the course of a long game, the Storyteller may lower your total \nMentor rating as you call on his knowledge. This decrease represents the fact that \nthe mentor has less left to teach as your character learns the mentor’s secrets. \nN @ E  \nPlaces of mystical power are rare and hotly contested in the modern age of \ndying magic, and you happen to have regular access to one such place. There may \nbe certain fees or quests levied on you, or you may have to travel through \ndangerous territory to get there, but you at least know the location of a stable \nNode, and you can usually rest there to refresh your energies. \nWhen you rest in a Node, you can restore your Quintessence as described \nfor the Avatar Background (seep. 103). ANode also generates Tass, or portable \nQuintessence. Each game session, you can test a number of times equal to the \nTraits of Node that you have. Each win (no tie) on a Simple Test is worth one \nTrait of Tass. Furthermore, you can come into play automatically with your \nQuintessence Traits equal to your Node or Avatar Trait total (whichever is \nlower). The Node has enough power for only one person to use. If you allow \nsomeone else to use the Node in one game session, then you cannot take its \npower for yourself as well. \nTechnocrats, lupines and enemy mages all tend to hunt for Nodes, so watch \nout. Your territory may become endangered by other supernatural creatures. \nSpirits and strange phenomena tend to haunt Nodes.

From there, however, the mage must \nseek out further enlightenment and understanding in order to increase his Arete \nand develop his supernatural wisdom. \nArete Traits do not have adjectives. Rather, a mage simply has a number of \nArete Traits, representing his overall enlightenment. The more Traits the mage \nhas, the more potent his mystical abilities are and (theoretically) the greater his \nunderstanding of the cosmos is. Arete Traits are not spent or temporarily used \nup like many other Traits. Rather, the mage’s Arete Traits remain a constant \nmeasure of the mage’s steps toward knowledge. Therefore, Arete ranges from \nzero (an un-Awakened human) or one (a neophyte mage) to lOTraits, although \nvery, very few mages ever achieve more than five Arete Traits. \nYou start with one Arete Trait - \nthe most basic wisdom that comes with \nAwakening. You can purchase additional Arete with your Free Traits for two \nFree Traits each. However, you can’t start with more than three Arete Traits. \nEven the most profound Awakening has limits. \nYour Arete has a few profound effects: \nYou use your Arete Traits to determine the success or failure of your \nmagical endeavors. When you enter a magical challenge (trying to cast a spell), \nyou pit your Arete against the spell’s difficulty. A more powerful spell can be cast \nreliably only by a wise, enlightened mage. \nYour knowledge of individual Spheres cannot exceed your overall \nwisdom. Therefore, you cannot have more levels in any Sphere than you have \nTraits of Arete. If you have only three Arete Traits, you cannot exceed Disciple- \nlevel Spheres. You could theoretically be ranked a Disciple in every Sphere, but \nfurther improvement would require an advancement of Arete. \nAs your Arete increases, you become aware that it’s the magician’s will \nalone that creates magic, not some dependence upon props and tools. Once you \ngain your sixth Arete Trait, you may discard the use of foci from one Sphere. You \ndon’t need to use any foci to do magic with that Sphere at all. Each additional \nTrait you accrue allows you to discard foci for another two Spheres, until you \ndon’t need foci at all to perform magic. \nNote especially that your Arete is limited by your permanent Willpower \nTraits. Your number of Arete Traits cannot exceed your permanent Willpower \nTraits. If your permanent Willpower falls below your Arete, the excess Arete \nTraits are not permanently lost. However, you can’t use them or count them \ntoward casting Effects until your Willpower is restored. \nW ILLPCBWER \nWhen everything else has failed and you’re utterly exhausted, Willpower is \nyour last resort. Your Willpower Traits measure your innerresolve, final tenacity 5 \nand sheer guts.

Rather, you have permanent \nWillpower Traits - \nthe rating that you start each game with - \nand temporary \nWillpower Traits - \nthe Willpower Traits that you can expend to do things and \nwhich refresh with time.

If you use some of your Willpower, it refreshes \nat a rate of one Trait every game session (although your Storyteller may vary this \npace to simplify bookkeeping or suit the needs of the chronicle). \nExpending a Willpower Trait can have any one of a number of effects, \ngenerally related to incredible resolve and self-determination: \nYou may spend Willpower Trait to refresh all of your lost Traits in one \nAttribute category - \nPhysical, Social or Mental. You can refresh each category \nonly once per game session. \nExpenditure of a Willpower Trait allows you to gain a single retest when \ndefending against a Mental or Social challenge. You lose the initial Traits you \nbid, as usual with a retest. You may use Willpower thus only once for any given \nchallenge. Note that certain powers or stipulations override this ruling. \nSpending one Willpower Trait enables you to enter a challenge for \nwhich you don’t have an appropriate Ability. For instance, if you’re trying to \nfigure out a complex security system and you don’t have the Technology \nAbility, you can use a Trait of Willpower to make a test as normal. This \nexpenditure doesn’t guarantee success, but it lets you try something you \nnormally wouldn’t be able to figure out. \nYou can spend a Willpower Trait to assert brief control over your senses \nwhile you’re in an episode of Quiet (see p. 174). Doing so allows you to speak a \nbrief sentence coherently or banish hallucinations for a short time, enough for \nyou to get your bearings temporarily. \nYou can spend one Willpower Trait to ignore all wound penalties, up to \nand including Incapacitated, for the duration of one turn. \nSpending a Willpower Trait lets you suppress aderangement temporarily. \nIf you spend enough Willpower Traits on suppressing a derangement, you may \novercome it eventually. \nYou may lose permanent Willpower Traits due to certain terrible traumas. \nThis happens only at the discretion of the Storyteller. The most likely cause is \nsuffering some great emotional or psychic trauma after you have exhausted all \n3 of your temporary Willpower Traits. In this event, your maximum Willpower \ndrops. If your permanent Willpower Trait total falls below your Arete Traits, \nthen your Arete is suppressed, as described previously. \nQUINRSS~NCE \nThe building block of the universe, the raw energy of the Tapestry, the Fifth \nElement, the power of the Tellurian - \nQuintessence is all this and more. Mages \nbelieve that all reality springs from Patterns of Quintessence. Objects or creatures \nexist because their Patterns are suffused with Quintessence, thereby giving them \nreality. Proficient willworkers can take this very energy in its pure state and \nchannel it to fuel their workings, to create new things or to reinforce their magics. \nAs such a potent commodity, Quintessence is highly valuable among mages. \nTrack your Quintessence Traits with temporary Traits. Quintessence \nTraits can have a Resonance adjective, or they can be flavorless. You might have \n, \nsmall cards for your Quintessence Traits, which record their Resonance and can \n(1 be turned in to a Storyteller once you use them.

Such energy is stored in your Pattern. Your mage literally \ncarries crackling, fundamental energy of creation inside his body. \nYour starting Quintessence equals your rating in the Avatar Background. \nWhen you enter a game session, you usually don’t gain any additional Quintes- \nsence since it’s such a rare and precious substance. However, if you have the \nNode Background, or you have gained access to Quintessence in the course of \nplay, you might gain additional Traits from a Storyteller. \nYou can use Quintessence for a variety of tasks. However, you can never \nchannel more Quintessence per turn into a magical Effect than your number of \nAvatar Traits. So, if you have Avatar x3, you can channel up to three Quintes- \nsence Traits per turn. Quintessence can do the following: \nFor one Quintessence Trait, you lower the casting difficulty of a spell by \none Trait. You can lower the base difficulty by up to three Traits (subject to your \nnormal Quintessence spending limits). \nFor one Quintessence Trait, you remove a penalty Trait from a spell. For \ninstance, if you are fast-casting a spell (normally a one-Trait penalty), you can \nspend a Trait of Quintessence to overcome this difficulty.

Each type of Resonance tends \nto be similar to a specific Avatar Essence. Dynamic Resonance is like the \nDynamic Essence, Entropic Resonance is like the Primordial Essence, and \nStatic Resonance is like the Pattern Essence. Simply pick an adjective that \nmay be appropriate for one type of Resonance. This adjective influences your \nmagic’s appearance. \nAs you gain experience and strengthen your magic, your personal style and \nfeelings come through more strongly. Eventually your Resonance will increase \nin strength. As your Resonance increases, you become noticeably more magical, \nquirky and different. Your personality traits shine through. \nYou can gain a new Resonance Trait from the following circumstances, if \nyou lose a Simple Test: \nGoing into Quiet \nFinishing a Seeking (whether passing or failing) \nLosing a permanent Willpower Trait \nLearning a Master-level Sphere \nUndergoing a strong magical or emotional event (Storyteller’s discretion) \nYou don’t typically lose Resonance Traits. \nYour character’s Resonance has a few noteworthy effects: \nYou gain a one-Trait Arete resolution bonus on all spell Effects that \nmatch up with your highest Resonance level. You’re encouraged to describe your \nspells so that they show off your Resonance. If you have the Dynamic Resonance \nof Fiery, for instance, then your spells should have contrails of flame and washes \nofheat. To claim this bonus, you must use the Resonance adjective in your spell \ndescription. You would have to elaborate on how fiery your spell is, potentially \nalerting your adversaries to your Resonance and style. \nYou gain a one-Trait Arete resolution penalty on all spells that oppose \nyour highest Resonance. For instance, if you have the Dynamic Resonance Trait \nFiery, you take a penalty on all ice-based magic. \nIf you have multiple Traits, you start to become more inhuman and \nmagical. You gain cumulative bonus Attribute Traits (which can exceed your \nnormal human limits) and Negative Traits, depending on your Resonance \ntotals, as shown here: \nTraits Dynamic \nEntropic Static \n1-2 \nNo modifiers (yet) \n3-4 \nEnergeticlClumsy FearsornelGhustly \nRational/Predictable \n5 \nVigorouslDelicate IntimidatinglRepugnant \nDisciplinedlShortsighted \nExample: Isla hus the Resonance Traits of Entropy: Lethal x3 and Static: \nPatterned, Instructive, Reinforcing.

Not all mages come \nthrough unscathed. Many more become unbalanced after battles with powerful \nspirits or trips to strange hellish spirit lands. Derangements cover the specific \nsorts of mental problems that could crop up. \nDerangements are advanced roleplaying tools, and they should be taken only \nwith special Storyteller approval.

Taking a derange- \nment gives a player two Free Traits at character creationrickdeb@bellsouth.net. \nN~TIVETRAITS \nAs listed earlier in the Trait categories, Negative Traits represent \nspecific shortcomings of characters. You can take Negative Traits in order \nto gain additional Free Traits to spend elsewhere. You may take up to five \nNegative Traits. \nWhen someone guesses one of your Negative Traits, you are one Trait \ndown on your challenge. For instance, if you happen to have the Trait Docile \nand someone guesses as much while fighting you, then you must risk an \nadditional Physical Trait to continue fighting since your foe has discerned \nyour weakness. If you don’t have enough Traits to cover the bid, you lose \nautomatically. Negative Traits don’t go away or get used up, so you could be \nin trouble once your Trait is discovered. Fortunately, if your enemy guesses \nwrong, then he must bid an additional Trait instead, because he counted on \na weakness that you didn’t have. \n‘EXPERIENCE \nGiven time, mages slowly claw their way up from Awakening toward \ne( \nAscension- at least, many do. This system is reflected in play with Experience \nTraits. As you play and learn, you become better at what you do. You learn new \nmagical skills, improve your Attributes and hopefully become a more upstanding \nexample of a mage. \nGenerally, you earn from one to three Experience Traits at the end of each \ngame session.

(In the case of \ncharacters with different maximum Traits, it's just maximum in one \nAttribute category, maximumeminus-one in the second and maximum- \nminus-two in the third.) \nNote that under rare circumstances, a mage can exceed these limits, \ndue to Resonance (p. 119), special magical Effects or the like. \nMCBND \nHUIfI;4N Lrmrrs (@PTI@NAL RULE) \nThis rule works only if you want mages to become kgefzdary, more-than- \nhuman figures as they increase in enlightenment. \nFor the most part, mages remain human. They still have their human \nfrailties and foibles. However, you can choose to allow mages an opportue \nnity to exceed human limitations as they grow in enlightenment. In such \ncases, the mage's increasing Arete takes him farther and farther from his \nsimple human roots, into the realm of the truly supernatural. \nphobias to childhood traumas to anxieties to failures to assumptions. Prob- \nlems can appear in very straightforward manifestations or in cryptic allegory. \nA mage with a phobia of spiders might find himself trapped in a room full of \narachnids, or strange, spiritual shapes might question the mage's beliefs or \npress him into dreamlike quests that make little rational sense, all with a \ndeeper meaning of dealing with personal matters. Often, the mage must \novercome some deeply held belief or difficulty. These quests force the mage \nto re-examine his values and personal relationships to the Tellurian. Even- \ntually, a determined and insightful mage can work through Seekings to find \nnew understanding. \nThe problems and symbols in a Seeking aren't always constant. A mage \nwith a Pattern or Questing Avatar may have to solve and re-solve the same trials \nover and over, adding a new layer each time. A Dynamic or Primordial Avatar \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nis likely to use different tools each time. Ideally, the mage overcomes old habits \nand problems or realizes some great new truths. \nAt the conclusion of a Seeking, the mage’s awareness returns. A failed \nSeeking can be like a nightmare. The mage struggles with inner problems and \nrealizes that they’re not yet resolved, that they’ll continue to press in painfully \nand that a greater awareness has been snatched away. A successful Seeking leads \nto something much like Awakening as the mage suddenly realizes a new level of \nreality. This change isn’t as profound as the first Awakening, but nevertheless, \nit can leave the mage with a deep spiritual lucidity that lasts for hours or days. \nEventually, the mage settles back into the fold of Awakened existence, ready to \nstrive for the next higher level of enlightenment. \nA Seeking can take a few minutes or hours, and most require some time \nand effort on the part of the mystic. It’s very rare for a Seeking to last longer, \nhowever. A mage who dives into his subconscious mind for more than a few \nhours risks madness, and he may actually be locked in a mindscape, an episode \nof Quiet (see p. 74). \nYou can undertake a Seeking each time you have enough Experience Traits \nfor the next Trait of Arete. This is a matter to resolve personally with the Avatar \nGuide (see p. 250). If you succeed, you spend the Experience Traits and gain one \nArete Trait. You do not lose the Traits if you fail, but you do not gain the Arete \nTrait either. In either case, you cannot engage in another Seeking until you meet \nthe criteria of your Avatar Essence once more (see p. 86). You may gain only one \nTrait of Arete with each Seeking. \nFortunately, once you’ve wrested enlightenment from the jaws of personal \nThe eventual stated goal for mages remains Ascension. Every Awakened \nmage realizes that the potential existsfor some higher level ofconsciousness. Just \nas the Awakening raises the mage up above human perceptions, so too do mages \nknow intuitively that some greater enlightenment hovers just out of reach. \nAscension isn’t tied to power or mystical understanding. In theory, a \nSleeper could have a moment of fundamental brilliance, Awaken and Ascend \nall at once. Even the rankest novice could Ascend, under the right conditions. \nI \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nConversely, a mage can study for hundreds of years, master a multitude of \nSpheres and never reach the sublime levels of Ascension. The Ascended realize \ntheir true potential as entities instead of as simple material existences tied to a \ncomplex Tapestry, and nothing is beyond their reach. Ascension isn't covered \nby rules: It's beyond rules. \nThe quest for Ascension remains one of the strong undercurrents of every \nmage's existence. If a character finally reaches Ascension, that character \ndisappears from the chronicle and goes to some other fate or greater cosmic \npurpose. Perhaps the character might appear once or twice to dispense some pure \ninsight from the well of enlightenment, but the Ascended mage has moved \nbeyond the concerns of the everyday world. \nI I \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nence seeme \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nMagic comes in wondrous diversity. Everything that humanity has ever \nimagined, from space ships to dragons to hidden faerie glades, is possible. The \nmagic lies in bringing imagination to life. A mage has the power to turn his fancies \ninto reality. Through will and belief, the mage shapes the very stuff of Creation \ninto a new form. In theory, with enough study and training, anything is possible. \nA mage’s ability to shape the world bows only to his understanding of the cosmos. \nOf course, were mages truly without limits, the world would be far different. \nA mage must study, work and learn the ways of magic. This painstaking process \nlasts a lifetime. Few mages truly master their talents, and nobody knows the real \nlimits of magic. Pursuing Ascension - \nbecoming something more than human, \ndeveloping an innate and intrinsic connection to the universe - \nis the final \ngoal. For most mages, though, the fact remains that practical magic lies in the \nexecution of little mystical tricks or creations. The more experienced the mage \nis, the broader andmore potent these skills become. With time and effort, amage \ncan also create lasting spells or build special talismans and magical devices. \nUltimately, magic opens the door to opportunity, but the occasions it affords are \nonly as broad as the creativity and dedication of the magician. \nBecause magic can be limitless, it’s difficult to describe and work effectively. \nHow do vou handle something that’s sublime and infinite in scoDe? For this reason, \nv \nmost mages agree upon the categorization of the following nine Spheres: Ccrrrespon- \nh e ,  Enmopy, Forces, Life, Matter, Mind, Prime, Spirit and Time. Each Sphere \ndescribes a specific piece of magical reality. With expertise in a Sphere, a mage can \neffect changes over that aspect of the Tellurian. Of course, the Spheres simply work \nas one model for magic. They provide a means for mages to have a common basis for \ntalking about their spells, or to give Apprentices a handle on what they’re doing. Two \nmages of widely different Traditions use such disparate techniques that describing \ntheir magical practices could prove nearly impossible. With the Spheres, however, \na mage can give his ally a general idea of what he’s doing, whether he’s manipulating \nForces, recasting Time, \nshaping I’rime energy or whatever. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTHE \nP~WERW AWARENED \n~\nG\nI\nC\n \nUltimately, an Awakened mage warps or rewrites reality with her powers. \nThe Spheres are simply a measure of the practical knowledge necessary to do so. \nIt’s the force of enlightenment, channeled through the mage’s belief in the \nefficacy of certain practices and items, that bends the world to the mage’s will. \nOf course, reality already has its own pattern. The world got along fine before \nthe mage ever Awakened, and it will probably continue to do so. The basic, \nunderlying level of reality that most people see is called static reality. The everyday \nperson on the street lives and breathes in static reality. Whatever most people \nbelieve is real has agreat effect on the shape of the world itself. Belief isn’t necessarily \neverything (some elements of the cosmos certainly predate humanity), but it does \nexert significant change over the Tellurian. This underlying reality is considered the \ncommon experience for most people, or the consensus. When a mage works \nAwakened magic, she reshapes the Tellurian, most often against the consensus. \nMages don’t really agree on the source of Awakened magic’s power. Is the \nAvatar really an angel, a friendly spirit or the mage’s soul? Nobody knows for \ncertain. All that mages known is that when someone Awakens and has the eye- \nopening experience that says, “I can change the world,” the person becomes \ncapable of exerting his will to change reality. That’s Awakened magic. \nOf course, even the un-Awakened have some capacity for magic. Patterns \nthat have existed so long in reality that they’re part and parcel of the world contain \ntheir own power, and sorcerers practice and use these Patterns. So magic remains \na mysterious force. Certainly the Awakened have more flexibility, but theirs isn’t \nthe only magic, nor is it necessarily a superior one. It’s simply a magic that comes \nfrom within, from will, enlightenment and belief in tools and trappings of magic, \nrather than from the power inherent to those tools or trappings themselves. \nVULGAR mGIc \nWhen a mage calls upon his greatest powers and invokes a display of stunning \nmystical forces, the act violates the consensus - \nit flies in the face of what people \nbelieve to be possible. The static reality, or mundane world, follows laws and rules \nthat say that such things aren’t possible. Through his enlightened will, the mage \n-I \nsays “By my will, this is possible,” and he makes it so. The mage literally bends or \nreweaves the Tapestry to his desires. He does not do so without cost, however. \nWhen a mage performs some feat that breaks the expectations of normalcy, he \ncommits a vulgar display of magic. People don’t just hurl lighming, fly through the air or \nshrug off bullets -reality doesn’t work that way. So say the laws of the world, and so it \nis difficult for mages to gainsay these rules. Vulgar magic is dficult and often uncontrol- . \nlable. Many vulgar workings go awry, and the world snaps back at the mage through the \nforce of Paradox. When the mage does something that’s clearly impossible, he creates a ; \nParadox, and the titanic forces he unleashes are often beyond human control. \nVulgar magic is also called vain or dynamic magic, because it’s a mighty \nchange to the world and a small example of the mage’s hubris in reshaping \nCreation. Mages who rely on vulgar magic often find themselves shunned by other \nmages who consider them dangerous, and they succumb to the forces of Paradox. \nCCBINCIENTAL \n~€IAGIC \nI \nOfcourse, many of the charms and spells used by mages don’t have to violate the , rrig . \nsanctity of the consensus. A mage can weave a subtle spell that takes off and nudges \n1, . \nL’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nlittle bits of reality here and there to work to his advantage. Such magic is called \ncoincidental magic because it seems like little more than a lucky coincidence. When \nit’s something that could reasonably happen in the real world, when people would say, \n“Wow, that’s unusual and lucky, but I guess it could happen,” it’s coincidental magic. \nMages rarely give direct shape to coincidental magic. Rather, working \ncoincidental magic is a matter of channeling desire into an Effect, then letting the \nspell go so that it nudges the Tellurian in a favorable way. The spell simply carries \nthe mage’s need - \n“I want him to be harmed by lightning,” or, “I want to win this \ngame of chance” - \nand the end result comes about in a way that could have \nplausibly happened anyway. Since this magic flows with the Tapestry instead of \ntearing it apart, it rarely suffers the burden of Paradox. The mage may not control \nit directly, but he nudges a few Patterns here and there to gain a desirable result. \nNote that, when casting coincidental magic in play, it’s customary for you (the \nplayer) to describe the nature of the coincidence, but your mage may not realize it. \nFor instance, your mage could cast an Effect designed to help heal a wound. You \nrationalize it by saying, “The wound wasn’t as severe as it looked at first,” and indeed, \nwhen someone checks, the wound seems to be not nearly as bad. Your mage, though, \nsimply chanted and invoked a charm to help with healing, and lo and behold, she \nseem to be better. She let the magic form the coincidence without directing it, even \nthough you (as a player) decided on what coincidental form it might take. \nCBNSENSUS \nCBINCIDENCE \n(@PTIBNAL RULE) \nThis rule works only if you trust your players to make objective, fa \nudgments of coincidence. \nte for their friends’ E \nlgar. If you think tha \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nincreasingly implausible, until they become vulgar. In some parts of the world, belief in \nmysticismmakescertainmagi~lfeatsacceptedoccurrences, \nso they remaincoincidental. \nWhen too many coincidences happen in one place, they stretch the bounds \nof possibility. As more and more events favor a mage, the likelihood of other \ngood luck becomes smaller. Eventually, the run of good luck becomes improb- \nable, and Effects that would’ve been coincidental become vulgar instead. Mages \nrefer to this complication as the Domino Effect - \nknock down too many \ncoincidences in a row, and they stack up until they’re just too implausible. \nEach time you cast a coincidental Effect, you decrease the likelihood of \nanother favorable coincidence. You add a + 1 Trait difficulty to the casting of \nsubsequent coincidental Effects. This modifier stacks, so you take a +3 Trait \ndifficulty to your next Effect after three successive turns of coincidental Effects. \nIn this case, it may be harder to cast each following Effect than it would be to \ncast vulgar magic. You still won’t gamer Paradox if you succeed, though. The \nmodifier drops by one for each turn that you don’t perform a coincidental Effect. \nIf your domino modifier reaches +3 Traits, then it stays at that level, and all \nsubsequent coincidental Effects are now vulgar until you spend a turn without casting \nany magic. Then it drops back to a +2 modifier and dissipates at the standard rate. \nTHE \nDCHTIINCB \nEWKT \nTHEITIETAPHYSICW~TIAGIC \nMages recognize intuitively the same thing that many young children \nknow: Reality itself is subjective, bent to whims and desires if one only believes \nhard enough. Although the modem world teaches children to reject this notion \nin favor of a scientific worldview in which natural laws govern everything and \nyou can’t change the world no matter how much you want to, mages know \nbetter. Their every working is testament to that fact. \nOf course, more than a few mages wonder at magic’s real limits. Can a mage \ntruly remove all gravity from the world, allowing everyone to fly? Could a mage \npluck the sun and moon from the sky and drink from the stars? Is it possible to \nrework Heaven, to brave Hell and to remake the face of Creation itself?Or, more \n.rl \nplausibly, how about just conjuring a buck and a quarter for lunch? \nWhile the Spheres of magic do describe and allow for great feats, even mages \nhave their limits. The consensus is one such limit. The more strongly that people \nbelieve in the way the world should work, the harder it is to fly in the face of such , \nbelief. History provides another limitation. Things that have been true for avery \nlong time tend to remain true, which is one reason why traveling back in time \nand changing the past is so very difficult. And then there are aspects to reality \nthat simply seem fixed in place, like the facts that all material things have an \nephemeral Pattern and that Quintessence forges the nature of reality. \nAsmagesunderstandit,realityitselfspringsfromacycleofgrowth,patterningand \ndecay. Everything stems from Quintessence, the mystic energy that fuels reality. It is \na sort of intangible essentia that creates perfect Patterns that coalesce into solid form. \nTHE \nCYCLE e~ \nTHE TELLURJAN \nMages perceive reality metaphorically as a great cosmic Tapestry, consist- \ning of threads woven from concepts, ephemera and matter alike. It’s the \ninteraction of these threads, and their weight from Quintessential strength, that \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncreates the Tellurian - \nthe whole of existence. As mages see it, various things \nspring into being from belief, ideas or the raw bubbling of creation and rebirth. \nIn time, these things take on Patterns - \ninsubstantial ideals of form. These \nPatterns can collect Quintessence. That is, they strengthen within reality until \nthey have a true nature, be it ephemeral or material. In time the Patterns wear \naway until they are gone. This never-ending cycle ensures the constant change \nof the universe and the flow of Quintessence through the Tapestry. \nIt’s from Dynamism that creation first begins. The universe holds infinite \npossibility. From time to time, new things are given form, as a result of mages \ncreating something, the universe itself clashing and growing to make new forms, \nor just raw creation spewing forth a brand-new idea. The power of Dynamism \nensures constant change and possibility. Every time a mage twists the Tapestry, \nhe fuels Dynamism in some fashion, because he creates possibility. \nOnce somethii is created, it exists in a form that takes a place in the Tapestry. The \nobject or creature, invested with Quintessence, has a form that can be manipulated. It’s \na spirit, a device, a being, a force or some other presence that has a consistent existence \nintheunivexxThisforceofStasiscausestheuniverse tohaveaconstant,understandable \nbasis. Although Stasis eventually gives way, it does provide a foundation for existence. \nIn time, all things erode. Patterns change or decay intonothingness, and their \nassociated objects, spirits, creatures or forces come to an end. This is aspect of the \nmetaphysical trinity is known as Entropy - \nthe renewal of things. Quintessence \nh returns to the unformed parts of the cosmos, to be taken back into the cycle. Old \nthings give way to new. Through this part of the cycle, the universe has room for \nnew growth, and it prunes those things that have remained too long. \nPATTERNS AND THE TAPESTRY \nAs the cycle of the Tellurian creates and destroys things, their forms and Patterns \nweave throughout the complex Tapestry of existence. Each piece of creation is tied to \nevery other piece through the thread of essential cosmic energy known as Quintes- \nsence. The merest parts combine to form greater Patterns and wholes. Just as a person’s \nPattern is made up from many tiny Patterns all built together, so too is the cosmos \nformed of a great conjunction of interwoven Patterns. The interaction of mind, body \nand spirit gives form and recognition to these Patterns. \nf \nThe physical world begins with the body - \nthe Patterns of Mutter, Life and \nForces that make up reality as it’s perceived by the senses. Chunks of material \nhave inert Patterns of Mutter, while living beings grow and change as complex \nPatterns that draw Quintessence from the cosmos and return it in a cycle of \n’! living Dynamism. The forces that act upon creatures and objects also have a \nPattern. They are suffused with bright energy for their brief existences, and they \n, transfer that energy to change or manipulate other Patterns. \n~ \nI \nGiven an ephemeral existence but separate from the material world, Spirit \nthe refined levels of nature that occur when a Pattern takes on \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nQuintessence in an ideal form. Instead of touching the base world of imperfect \nmatter, the Spirit has an existence that mirrors emotion, thought and desire. \nWhile Spirit often reflects creations of matter, it also forms into sublime truths \nthat cannot survive in the constraints of the material world. \n~ I N D  \nWithout ephemera or materia, Patterns exist only as thoughts and ideals. These \nPatterns are mere constructs of fancy until they are empowered with Quintessence. \nYet it’s from such thoughts that all things form. Belief in a Pattern fuels its reality, \nand awareness of other forms creates an awareness of self. The mind reflects the most \nrefined nature of the universe, the consciousness that cannot be grasped but exists \nsolely because it perceives itself. When the mind believes in something’s power, that \nbelief creates power. From the mind springs recognition of the Tapestry and the will \nthat creates magic, grants strength to a focus and shapes new forms. \nSPHERES, PARADIGmS AND RULES \nAlthough the powers of the Spheres remain theoretically infinite, the hard \nfact remains that most mages’ capabilities exist under hefty limitations. In game \nterms, you use your ratings in the various Spheres to determine what your mage \ncan and can’t do. This capacity is bounded further by your mage’s practical \napplications of those Spheres and by the beliefs that your mage holds. Therefore, \nthe Spheres serve double-duty as a descriptive art that mages talk about in the \ngame, and as a rules mechanic for moderating play. \nTHE \nLEVELS w SPHEMS \nMages have a rough idea of what’s possible with the Spheres. A long- \nstudying Hermetic Master is far beyond the capabilities of a newly Awakened \nApprentice. Of course, individual mages rarely categorize magic so simply, but \na general scale of competence exists. In game terms, this scale follows the levels \nof power for the Spheres. Therefore, you chart your mastery of each Sphere as: \nApprentice- A mage who’s just started studying the rudiments of the Sphere. \nInieiate-Onewhohasbeeninitiatedintothetruemrjteriesandleamedthebasics. \nDisciple - \nA mage with a broad, general competence in a given Sphere. \nAdept-Onewho’suncoveredsignificant secretsandpracticedwiththeSphere. \nMaster - \nA mage who has command over both fundamental and complex \naspects of the Sphere and who has a great level of skill and experience. \nFor crossover purposes, the Apprentice and Initiate levels are Basic powers, \nthe Disciple and Adept levels are Intermediate powers, and the Master level is \nan Advanced power. Beyond such power levels are Archmages, but their scope \nis too great to be detailed here. \nCREATING \n~AGICAL \nEFFECTS \nWhen you decide to work magic (or whatever your mage calls it), you need \nto go through a simple process to determine the results. Follow these steps: \nDetermine the Effect: Figure out what you want to do, whether it’s hurling \na ball of flame, causing people around you to fail to notice your presence or \nmaking dice fall as you dictate. \nDecide Upon Your Method: Each mage’s paradigm- his means of looking \nat magic - \ninfluences the casting of an Effect. If you’re a Hermetic mage, you \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nprobably use Enochian chants, the names of powerful angels and spirits, \ngeometric sigils or glyphs. If you’re a Virtual Adept, you might reprogram a \ncomputer to project energy or re-code the surrounding universe itself. Figure out \nhow your mage justifies the Effect in order to determine what focus and what \nAbility you use with the spell. Mages don’t just crank out spells. They work, \nchant, pray and invoke to make the magic happen. \nCheck Your Knowledge: Do you know how to accomplish what you want \nto do? Look at your character’s Spheres and determine what knowledge will help \ncomplete the feat. If you have the appropriate rote, you’re fine. If not, you may \nnot be able to work the Effect. If you use the optional rule for fast-casting, you \ncan try to cast the rote even if you don’t know it. If you use the optional rule for \ndynamic magic, you can try to build an Effect that does what you want, even if \nthere is no rote for it. However, if you don’t have the necessary Sphere \nrequirements, you can’t perform the magic. \nThe base assumption is that you cannot perform a given spell unless your \nSpheres and rotes explicitly list the ability to do so. \nCalculate Difficulty: The base difficulty for a magical Effect is the Effect’s \nSphere level in Traits if it’s coincidental, plus one if it’s vulgar, plus another one \nif it happens in view of Sleepers who wouldn’t believe that it’s possible. Add \nmodifiers based on the circumstances, as shown in the following chart. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nPerform the Effect: You cast the Effect by making a Static Challenge. \nGenerally, no Narrator is required as long as your Effect conforms to the rules \npresented here. You simply make the challenge against anyone handy. (Just be sure \nto tell the other person what you’re doing so that she doesn’t get the wrong idea.) \nIf you win the challenge, your Effect succeeds. Work out the result as described for \nyour rote or Sphere and continue. If you lose, your Effect fails. If you tie, you must \ncheck your Arete Traits against the Effect’s static difficulty, which you computed \nbefore. You win if you have more Traits or equal Traits. Note that if you lose the test, \nyou can retest with an appropriate Ability for your focus (see the list of foci and \nAbilities on p. 178, which you picked when you decided upon your method. Also, \nyoucanoverbidwith your Arete ifyou have twiceasmany AreteTraitsas theEffect’s \nTrait difficulty. However, your opponent can overbid if the reverse is true. \nWound modifiers do not affect your Static Arete Challenge. Therefore, you \ndo not come into the challenge Traits down or lose on ties automatically simply \nfor being wounded. However, you cannot perform an Effect if you are uncon- \nscious and have not somehow maintained your thinking process magically. \nSuffer Paradox: Once you’ve finished the Effect, you will take Paradox. \nTypically, Paradox causes a small amount of damage, but the Paradox Judge may \ndecide upon another Effect as well. See the section on Paradox later in this chapter. \nMagic isn’t as simple as all that, of course. Besides the basic Arete Challenge \nand the modifiers, you can influence your outcome in a couple of ways and incur \na couple of potential difficulties. \nPER~UTATICBNS \nABILITIES \nENHANCING \n~ A G I C  \nWhen you roleplay a focus properly, you can claim its benefits to your character. \nFor instance, if you actually take the time to speak some mystical words, flourish your \n-b \nhands and grasp your mystic amulet, you may well represent your mage’s use of \nLinguistics: Emhian, and you’re certainly putting that knowledge to work. \nIf you spend a full turn on the roleplaying of your focus before you cast an Effect, \nthat focus’ Ability helps with the result. The list of sample foci gives some ideas for \nappropriate Abilities for each focus. When you meet this requirement, you can use \n-t \nthat Ability for one retest on the Arete Challenge as long as you have any levels left. \nExample: Kitty redly, redly, redly needs to help herfnend Miguel, who’s teen shot by \nTechnocraticagentsandisdying. Shedeciih torisksome tdgarmagicandhealhirninstantly . \nAs a Verbena, Kitty m use any son of life-affiliated focus.

Miguel is healed of one level \n~ ; \nNow Kitty just needs to sm‘we the Paradox and the Technocrat \n”l \nUSING \nG~UINTESSENCE \nt \nAs noted on the difficulty chart, using Quintessence allows you to make \nI \nft?:d‘m \n.I, . \n0’ \ndifficult Effects much easier. Each Trait of Quintessence that you channel, up \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nto a maximum of your Avatar rating, lowers the difficulty of the Effect by one \nTrait. At best, you can have a net difficulty of three Traits lower than the base \ndifficulty, to a minimum difficulty of two Traits. \nExample: Having recoveredfrom his run-in with the Technocrmy, Miguelis working \non a nasty Forces spell to gamer wengeance. He tracks down the Technocrat and lets loose \nwith the spell. Since it's a vulgar Forces Adept-he1 Effect in public, it has a base difficulty \nof six Traits. Howewer, Miguel is also distructed (he's being shot at again), whxh adds one \nTrait, andhe'sfast-casting(becauseheham'tmasteredtherote yet), foranother&tumal \nmodifier of one, fur a total di&ulty of eight Traits. Miguel's phyer decides to offset this \npenalty with five Traits of Qauntessence. Miguel's a fortunate mage with an Avatar rating \nof five, so he can do just that. He drops his difidq back down to three Traits. \nIf Miguel had suffered from some other modifier - \nanother Trait penalty of \nopposed Resonance, for instance - \nand the difficulty had gone up to nine Traits, he \nwould have still been able to spend no more than five Traits of Quintessence. In that \ncase, he would not have been able to bring the difficulty down past four Traits. If he \ndidn't have any negative modifiers, then his Quintessence expenditure couldn't lower \nthe difficulty below the base-minus-three limit, or aminimum of three Trait difficulty, \nso he wouldn't have any need to spend more than three Quintessence Traits. \nSPENDING \nEXTRA T I ~ E  \nShould you choose to spend extra time, you can help to guarantee success in \ncasting Effects. Taking a full extra turn to cast gives you a + 1 Trait modifier on the \nresolutionofthe AreteTest. YoucanstackthismcdifierwiththeuseofafocusAbility. \nTherefore, if you take three turns total (one turn for extra time, one turn for the focus, \none for the base Effect), you can cast with a +1 Trait bonus and an Ability retest. \nINTERRUPTICEINS \nIf you're interrupted while casting an Effect - \nsay, you're wounded while \nyou're working your focus - \nyou have two choices. You can either cast the Effect \nimmediately and lose any bonuses from the extended casting, or you can take the \npenalty for being distracted and continue. Therefore, if you are trying to gain the \n1 Ability bonus and casting an Effect, but you are wounded later in the same turn, \nyou can decide to release the Effect without penalty but without gaining the \nretest. Similarly, you could continue to cast the Effect and gain a bonus for taking \nextra time, which would cancel the distraction penalty. \nCCEIUN-rErnGIC \nSometimes you just can't let the enemy get the drop on you, and you have \nto find a way to fight or cancel his spell. That's where countermagic comes in. \nA mage works countermagic by using his own powers to cancel ot wash out his \nenemy's Effect. Doing so counts as your action for the turn, so you can't do it if \nyou've already acted. The three basic types of countermagic are sphere \ncountermagic, anti-magic and unweaving. \nSphere Countermagic occurs when you have the Spheres necessary to \nknow what the opponent is doing. You pit your Arete against the enemy's. In \nsuch a case, you make an Arete Test, at the same difficulty as the opponent \n(although you take your modifiers for distractions and Resonance into effect). \nIf you win, the spell is canceled. If you have Apprentice-level (or better) Prime \nand your Arete is higher than the opponent's, the Effect can be reflected back \nupon him, so he might be hit by his own fire bolt or wounding spell. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAntieMagic uses Quintessence to strengthen the Patterns of reality against \nan Effect. You spend Quintessence to raise the difficulty of the opponent’s Effect. \nYou can spend Quintessence up to the limit of your Avatar Background, as usual. \nUnweaving tries to tear apart a n  existing spell. You make a challenge against the \ndifficulty of the original spell (although your difficulty might still be modified by \ndistractionsorResonance). YoumusthavetheSpheresnecessarytohavecastthe Effect, \nand you must have at least the Apprentice-level Prime Sphere. Ifyou win, the spell loses \none grade of success. Unweaving can degrade the duration of a spell. If the spell has no \ngrades of effect left (i.e., it’s down to a simple Effect), then an unweaving destroys it. \nSIlllULTANE@US fh?XTS \nYou can cast only one Effect in a turn. Even with Time magic, you are limited to \nchanneling only so much magical energy. If you want to do multiple thmgs at once, you \nwill probably have to build a conjunctional Effect, if your game uses that optional rule. \nHowever, some Effects have a duration, especially if you use the grades of \nsuccess mechanic from performing rituals or using Willpower (see the optional \nrules on p. 138). If you have an Effect running already, it takes some of your \nconcentration and makes casting other Effects difficult. \nPerforming any Effect that requires full concentration, like controlling \nweather with constant changes, precludes you from doing anything else. All of \nyour attention is occupied on the spell. Even withMind multi-tasking, you can’t \ndivert your magical will to another feat. \nAny other Effect typically requires a little magical will to sustain, but it’s not \ntoo taxing. For every two full Effects of this sort that you have running, you take \na one-Trait penalty on all new casting challenges, because you’re slightly \ndistracted. Therefore, you might keep up a Forces shield without difficulty, but \nif you also add on the Better Body rote, then you’ll suffer a one-Trait penalty to \nall additional Effects that you weave. \nSPHERES \nAND R~TES \nWhat follows are the descriptions of the nine Spheres as used by the \nTraditions (and, with some changes, the Technocracy). Each Sphere has a \nbroad, general description to note its characteristics, followed by a series of level \ndescriptions, eachofwhich lists the capabilities of that level of magic. With each \nlevel is a set of sample rotes that mages can learn and use. Also, special rules \nregarding the format and uses of the Spheres are covered immediately hereafter. \nMagecharacters start with six levels OfApprentice or Initiate Spheres. With time \nand experience, they may learn more, but doing so is a difhcult process. Typically, a \ncharacter takes two sessions per Sphere level to learn a new set of powers successfully. \nTherefore, learning the Initiate level of Forces would take four game sessions from the \ntime that the player spent the Experience Traits. This time is halved for a specialty \nSphere to only one session per level. (Note, however, that if you’re in a large \norganization with many games, this rate is based on your home game. No fair going to \na bunch of other games during the week and claiming that you’ve fulfilled your session \ntime. The progression is based on the game sessions of your local, usual game.) \nHaving the Mentor or Library Background can greatly facilitate learning \nnew Spheres (see p. 114). \nLEARNING \nSPHERES \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nWillpower Trait before you begin an Effect, you \neniftheEffectdifficulty is twice yourAreteTrait to \nACTING \nIN CCBNCERT \n($PTICBNAL RULE) \nall the modifiers to the Arete Test before any caster inv \ne challenge.

In this \nEach Sphere description includes several sample rotes. These rotes are ex- \namples of the powers possible with that level of the Sphere, and of the common \ntechniques that mages develop. You gain one rote automatically for each level that \nyou learn in a Sphere. Therefore, you have an Apprentice-level rote for the 5 \nApprentice-levelofasphere, an Initiate-level rote when you learn the Initiate-level : \nof the Sphere and so on. You can learn additional rotes with experience, although \\ \nyou can usually learn only one rote per game session. You should have a card for each \nI \nrote you know, with a description of its Effect.

Just make sure that \nthe Storyteller handles it between games. It’s hardly sporting to come up with \nand purchase a new rote immediately in the middle of play, especially if the \nStoryteller doesn’t have time to tell if it’s balanced or not. \nI~GICAL \nATTACKS \nMany of the Spheres have useful applications in battle. However, they often \nrequire a subsequent challenge to hit or best the target. \nIf a Sphere uses a hurled Effect, like a lightning bolt, you must best the \nsubject in a challenge of your Mental Traits against the victim’s Physical Traits. \nIf the Sphere uses a touch Effect, like an enchantment on a sword or your hand, \nyou must win a Physical Challenge against the victim. Either sort of attack can \nbe retested with the opponent’s Dodge Ability if the victim is aware of the attack. \nYoucanusean Abilitywith the attackifyouhaveanappropriateone: Useoccult \nif you hurl eldritch bolts, Firearm if you enchant a gun, Meke with a weapon, \nBrawl if you deliver the Effect by touch and Athktics if you throw an object. \nIf you have complete physical control over a subject (if you have someone \ntied down, an object held in your hand with nobody else vying for it, etc.), you \nmay forgo the attack challenge and affect the subject automatically. \nSome Effects have other requirements, as described in their individual rules. \nMost Effects can reach to the distance of your line of sight or senses. \nExceptions are noted in the individual power descriptions. If you wish to extend \nyour range further, you must be able to cast a conjunctional Effect (see p. 141) \nwith the Correspondence Sphere. \nI h G I C A L  R€ACH \nMost spells take effect immediately upon being cast. If a spell is instant, it \ntakes effect and is done, although the results may linger. For instance, a bolt of \nfire is instant, so it just flashes into existence and strikes, but it may leave \nI something burning naturally. If a spell has a duration of one turn, it lasts until \nthe end of your next turn. Therefore, you can cast an augmenting Effect, then \nuse it with your next action in the next turn. If a spell has a duration of one \nminute or conflict, then it lasts either for aminute (if you’re not in combat time) \nor for the series of tests necessary to complete one conflict. If a duration is listed \nas a scene or an hour, then the spell lasts either for one hour (if you’re not in \n* combat time) or until you leave the location or have a break in game time. \nLonger durations will typically exceed a game session and last throughout it. \nDurations rate on a scale, and certain Effects or techniques can modify aspell’s \nduration. The grades for duration are: instant, one turn, one minute or conflict, \none hour or scene, one day. AStoryteller must adjudicate longer durations. A spell \nmight last for a week, a month or more. Some Effects, like magical item creations \nI or wards over areas, might be made permanent until another mage counters them. \nMost Effects have anassumeddurationofone minute/conflict, unlessothenvise \nstated. Generally, casting an Effect on a subject other than the mage causes that \nEffect to lose one grade from its duration. An Effect that lastsfor one minute/conflict \n* when you cast it on yourself last for only one turn when you cast it on someone else. \nKeep these limits and grades in mind when making and approving your own rotes. \n. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nGRADES \nSUCCESS \nMost rotes have a listing for grades of success. If you cast a lengthy ritual or \nyou use Willpower, you can boost a spell’s power so that it has a greater effect. \nThe exact effects are listed in the “Grades of Success:’’ section for each rote. \nSTACKING \nUnless otherwise noted, you can’t stack multiple instances of the same Effect. \nFor instance, ifyou hit someone with the Entropy Effect Blight of Aging, the subject \nsuffers aNegative Physical Trait. You can’t use the Effect again to cause another such \nTrait at the same time. If a subject is under multiple instances of the same Effect, only \nthe most powerful one works. If the duration on one instance of the Effect runs out, \nthe next longest duration kicks in. Therefore, if someone is under the Blight of \nAging Effect to have two Negative Physical Traits for a conflict, and another Blight \nof Aging Effect to have one Negative Physical Trait for a scene, then the victim \nsuffers two Negative Physical Traits for the first conflict and then one Negative \nPhysical Trait for the remainder of the hour. He does not suffer the one-Trait penalty \nfor an additional hour after the first conflict. The duration times overlap, and only \nthe most powerful Effect affects the target at a time. \nWhen unweaving an Effect, you may choose which instance of an Effect to \nunweave. Therefore, you can unweave a longer-running Effect, a more-powerful \nEffect, or any one that you choose. \nCCBRRESPCBNNNCE \nManipulation of space and distance is the purview of Correspondence. With \nthis Sphere, the mage can sense, stretch or distort space, teleport from place to \nplace or extend the range of his other senses or magics. This Sphere also covers \nmystical connections, so Correspondence helps create sympathetic magics, like \nbreaking or strengthening the ties between an object and a person. \nTheorists espouse the idea of the Correspondence Point and argue that all \nof space is an illusion. They argue that all things exist simultaneously in the \nTapestry. Through the Correspondence Point theory, they defy distance and \neven step outside of space itself. \nNormally, a mage can send Effects only to the distance of his normal senses. \nIf you allow conjunctional Effects, though, then the mage can work Effects at the \ndistance of his Correspondence scrying. However, no other Sphere added to such \nan Effect can exceed the level of the Correspondence power. \nYou must use Correspondence on whole Patterns. Therefore, you couldn’t ? \njust teleport someone’s head to Saturn. You’d have to teleport the whole person \nif you had a ritual strong enough to reach that far in the first place. \nASPENTICE \n(BASIC) CCBRIQESPCBNDENC~: \nII~II~IEDIATE SPATIAL \nPERCEPTICBNS \nYou can extend your senses so that you have an abstract awareness of \neverything around you. You become completely aware of distance and of various \nmagical Effects that alter space. \nobjects, places or people. When you cast this Effect on a subject, you become \naware immediately whether that subject is somehow tied supernaturally to \nSense Connection: You determine the strength of connection between i ,-,. \n;. .= \n* r  \n--I \nsomething else. You can tell if it’s a Correspondence gate, for instance, or if it has ’. t!h \nt \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nastrong sympathetic link to someone. You don’t know what it’s tied to, only that \nit has a strong connection. Grades of Success: No effect. \nLandscape of the Mind: You feel the space around you without having to \nrely on your normal senses. For the next minute or conflict, you gain a one-Trait \nbonus on all challenges involving distance or range automatically, and you sense \nobstacles and people even if you can’t see them. This effect reaches up to 15 paces \nplus an additional three paces per Arete Trait. You can also make a Mental \nChallenge to detect physically concealed individuals (not including those \nhiding with mental invisibility or the vampiric Discipline Obfuscate). You may \ngrant these senses to another person, in which case, they have a base duration \nof only one turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of success allows you to double \nthe Effect’s reach, or extend its duration by one grade. \nWhereami?: By clearing your mind and sensing local space, you gain an \nabsolute location sense. You gain a rough axis of your location immediately with \nrespect to a location that you already know. In so doing, you can tell the \ndirection to the known location and its rough distance (near, moderate, far, very \nfar). Grades of Success: No effect. \nINITIATE (BASIC) CCBRMSPCBNDENCE: \nSENSE \nAND TCBUCH \nSPACE \nThe Initiate may cast his senses out to other locations or even touch them \nremotely. You can scry a distant location, although doing so forms a Correspon- \ndence link to you that can be detected with Sense Connection. You can also \nextend your physical reach to these locations. \nApportation: Youcan physically touch anobject at adistance. You may exert \nyour normal touch (strike, kick, whatever) on anything up to adistance of 15 paces \nplus three paces per Arete Trait. If you make an attack, you must make the usual \nchallenge to hit. The Effect lasts for one turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of \nsuccess allows you to double the Effect’s reach or extend its duration by one grade. \nCorrespondence Sensing: You can use your normal senses at a distance. Your \nmaximum range for sensing is 10 paces plus two paces per Arete Trait. You can send \nyour senses to any location you specify within this distance. Alternatively, if you \nhave an object with an arcane connection to a subject (as might be determined by \nSense Connection), you may send your senses to the object of that connection. \nTherefore, if you have a key that has an arcane connection to its owner, you can hold \nP the key and send your senses to the location of the owner, regardless of distance. This \nEffect lasts for one minute or conflict. You can grant these senses to someone else, \nin which case the base duration is one turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of success \nWard: You can defend against distant perceptions and scrying by muddling \nspace in the area. If you ward an area, then any attempt to view the area remotely \nwith magic (such as with Correspondence Sensing or the vampiric Discipline \nAuspex) suffers a retest automatically even if it succeeds. That is, someone \n‘ 1  casting Correspondence Sensing to spy on you must win a retest as well to \npenetrate the Ward. The Ward lasts until it is penetrated or for a scene or hour, \nwhichever comes first. You can Ward an area up to 15 paces in diameter plus \nthree paces per Arete Trait. If you have Disciple-level Correspondence or higher, \nyou may instead cast a Ban. A Ban cannot be crossed physically unless the \nviolator wins a Static Physical Challenge with a difficulty of three times your \n: allows you to double the Effect’s reach or extend its duration by one grade. \nI ~ \n; \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nArete Traits.

With \nthis magic, you can step from place to place without crossing intervening spaces, \nand you can change the ties between Patterns. You can also split your percep- \ntions so that you see several places at once. \nChain: You can cause two things (people, places or items) to have an arcane \nconnection. You must be able to sense the two things that you wish to chain \nwhile you cast the Effect. Thereafter, they have an arcane connection that can \nbe useful with other Correspondence Effects. The arcane connection lasts for a \nscene or hour, whichever comes first. You must win a Static Mental Challenge \nto use Chain on an unwilling subject. Grades of Success: Each grade of success \nallows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nThe Seven-League Stride: You can step across short distances without \ncrossing the intervening space. You may step up to 15 paces plus three paces per \nArete Trait, in any direction as desired. You do not exist physically in the \nintervening space so you can pass through any wall or barrier except a Ban. You \ncan take with you anything that you can carry. Grades of Success: Each grade of \nsuccess allows you to double the Effect’s distance. \nFilter All-Space: You can spread your senses across space to look for something \nin many places at once. You radiate your senses out to a distance of 15 paces plus three \npaces per Arete Trait. If you know what you’re looking for, you can send aNarrator to \nfind it. As long as it’s not within a Ward, you sense it immediately and gain a general \nidea of its location. Grades of Success: Each grade of success allows you to double the \nEffect’s reach. For one grade of success, you may cast this Effect on another person. \nADEPT \n(INTEMIEDIATE) CQXRESP~NDENCE: \n&ND SPACE \nYou can create actual free-standing gates where space touches other spaces \nat a distance, and where things warp from point to point. You can even manifest \nyourself in multiple places at once or close something off in a pocket dimension. \nBubble of Reality: You shift a subject into an area of non-space, where it does \n4 \nnot interact with the rest of the world. You must make an attack to “hit” with this \npower. If you succeed, you thrust the target (up to human size) into an area outside \nspace. You maintain an arcane connection to it, so you can still scry on it. You may \nalso thrust yourself into non-space and scry out. Null space still counts as part of \nthe reality to which it’s linked, for purposes of Paradox and magic. The bubble lasts \nfor one turn. Beings put into non-space aren’t harmed, but they may be taken out \nof play for a time. Grades ofSuccess: Each grade of success allows you to extend the \nEffect’s duration by one grade or double the total affected target volume (so you \ncould affect two people with an extra grade, or four with two extra grades). \nHemes Portal: A gate appears that looks like a dark window, leading to \nanother place. The other end of the gate may be anything within the usual 15 paces \nplus three paces per Arete Trait, or any location to which you have an arcane \nconnection. Anything may pass through, and the gate is not one-sided, so if you \nmake a gate to a dangerous location, you’ll suffer the same toxic effects as everyone \nelse. The gate lasts for one turn then winks out. Grades of Success: Each grade of \nsuccess allows you to double the Effect’s reach or extend its duration by one grade. t’:;. ,, \nI \n_ .  \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nPolyappearance: Co-locating space around yourself, you appear in mul- \ntiple places at once. Whatever you do affects all of those locations \nsimultaneously, but you can also be affected by things in all of those places. If \nyou decide to attack or manipulate multiple things simultaneously, you suffer \na two-Trait concentration penalty on all challenges because your single body \nis trying to interact with multiple differently reacting things. Also, anything \nthat happens to your body in one of its locations happens to your body in every \nlocation. Therefore, if you use this Effect to appear in three dangerous \nlocations, the damage you take in one applies to you in the other two locations \nas well. If one body gets shot, another gets stabbed and the third gets pierced \nwith an arrow, the witnesses in each location will see a knife slash, a bullet hole \nand an arrow wound. You can appear in one additional place up to a distance \nof 15 feet plus three feet per Arete Trait. Grades of Success: Each grade of \nsuccess allows you to make another spatial appearance, or double the Effect's \nreach. For one grade, you may cast this Effect on someone else. \n~ J Z R ( & V M C ~ )  \nC ~ ~ ~ N D E N C ~  \n~ U T A T E  \nTSALITIB \nYour control of space is so absolute that you can warp or bend it freely. You can \nmake multiple objects share the same perceived space while each remains un- \nharmed, or you can warp space around something to isolate it from normal space. \nCo-Location: You cause two points of space to act as if they're the same. \nPick one other point in space. You can pick one target up to the size of a person, \nsuperimpose it on one other target, and vice versa. Superimposed objects do not \nsuffer harm from sharing space, although local environmental conditions may \ncause damage (such as co-locating a person into a large fire). Therefore, if you \nhave a space with a chair in one location and a person in another, you can stack \n' the two. The chair appears in the same place as the person, and the person in the \nsame place as the chair. Anyone can affect the co-located spaces freely. If two \nco-located objects separate, they do not co-locate again on their own. This \nbizarre appearance lasts for one turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of success \ntations: Space warps and twists around the subject so that its \nof space tells it that the universe is bending. To everything else, \nthe subject seems to be bent. You can change relative perceived space so that \nsomething shrinks, grows or seems to take on different shapes. Doing so does not \ncause actual damage to the subject, nor can it cause the subject to be crushed by \nsurroundings. The space changes around the subject; the subject is not actually \ngrowing. Increasing the effective spatial volume of a creature makes it double in \nsize, so it is easier to hit (two-Trait bonus to resolve attacks). Shrinking a creature \n~ \nmakes it correspondingly harder to hit. If you warp a subject, you can make it \nincapable of taking any coherent physical action with the physical world because \nits subjective space is bent relative to the universe. However, the subject could still \nork magic. Any application lasts for one turn. Grades of success: \ncess allows you to extend the Effect's duration by one grade. \nouble the Effect's reach or extend its duration by one grade. \nof Entropy affects death, decay and rebirth.

By focusing on order, the mage can detect patterns and \nprogressions. By focusing on chaos, the mage senses dissolution and decay. \nEntropy Effects can change luck or fate, but only uncontrollably. Fate is fickle. \nA mage can’t cast a good-luck Effect and specify the form that the blessing will take. \nOnly time and destiny will reveal the nature of the good luck that was invoked. \nAPPRENTICE \n(BASIC) ENTRBPY: SENSE \nFATE \nAND FBRTUNE \nYou can discern the currents of destiny. Chance is visible to you. Although \nyou may not have an exact vision of odds or chaotic systems, you have a very, \nvery accurate estimate. You can tell when something is weakened, when \nsomething is about to change or when to get the hell out of Dodge. \nLocate Disorder and Weakness: You can locate areas of chaos, disorder and \ndecay. You may find places where disorder is highest, so that you can squeeze in \na little more unnoticed change, and you can tell what sorts of randomness are \nsubject to the most fluctuation. By detecting weakpoints, youcangainaone-Trait \nbonus to attacks against anything that you can sense, as long as you can reach the \nweak spot and reasonably strike it. You could make an unarmed attack against a \nperson and claim the bonus, but you couldn’t get the benefit by shooting at a \npinhead at adistance of 50 feet because it’s unreasonable to try to hit that spot. This \nsense lasts for the duration of a minute or conflict. You may cast this Effect on \nanother person, in which case the base duration is one turn. Grades ofSuccess: Each \ngrade of success allows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nRing of Truth: By sensing the currents of destiny, you can tell if something is a \ntruth or falsehood. The very forces of destiny tell you whether a statement has \nprofundity. With a successful static Social Challenge (difficulty of the subject’s Social \nTraits),youcandeterminewhetherthelastthingthatsomeonesaidwasalie.Tnisonly \ntells you whether the subject believes what he says, though, and only works if the \nanswerhassomerelevance tothesubject-ifthesubjectdoesn’tknowtherealanswer, \nthenanyresponsesimplyresults in“Thesubjectdoesn’tknow.”GradesofSuccess: Each \ngrade of success allows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade.

You can tell when something is a natural order or a chaotic one, and \nyou may even influence the odds of such orders. \nBeginner’s Luck: You take a shot at something and hope that it goes right. \nYou try to get something to happen correctly just by beginner’s luck. When you \ndon’t have the appropriate Ability to make a challenge, you can cast this Effect \ninstead. If you succeed, you may make the challenge normally: Your Beginner’s \nLuck gives you a chance at success. However, you may only bend fate this way once \nper game session. Fortune is too fickle to treat you a beginner for long. Grades of \nSuccess: For one grade of success, you may cast this Effect on another person. \nGames of Luck: “Apparently, nobody told the bookies in the Bronx about \nme.” Manipulations of luck allow you to gain absurdly favorable odds in \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsituations of total chance. You can influence your roll of dice or your fall of cards. \nAlthough doing so becomes increasingly improbable because of the Domino \nEffect, you can take a few shots at good luck. When you cast this Effect in a \nsituation of total chance (like rolling dice or generating a random number), you \nmay take two chances on the next turn (roll a second time, pick a new number, \netc.) and take the better result. Grades of Success: Each grade of success lets you \npick another chance element (another die roll, another number, etc.). For one \ngrade of success, you may cast this Effect on another person. You may choose \nwhether the subject gets the better pick or the worse pick. \n~\nL\n~\n~\n~\n~\nYou can now recognize the hand of Entropy in other Patterns, and you can \neven affect it to some degree. Although you can’t avert the eventual fate of all \nthings, you can arrest decrepitude in a subject temporarily or accelerate the process \nof decay. Only set Patterns like material objects or forces can be so dissipated.

You cause iron to rust, plastic to \nwarp, wood to rot and complex electronics or mechanics to become befouled and \nuseless. The spell causes the item in question to lose one Trait or health level \nimmediately. If the item loses all of its Traits/ health levels, it collapses into a useless \nheap. You do not need to make an attack to use this power. Rather, you affect the \nentropy that naturally occurs in an object or system. Grades ofsuccess: Every two full \ngrades of success inflict another Trait or health level of damage on the item. \nADEPT \n(INTEW~EDIAT~ \nE N T R ~ :  \nAWKT LIFE \nAt this point, you’ve learned to sense and manipulate even the complex \npatterns of chance that work around living beings. You can change their fate and \nfortune or cause them to fall ill with bad luck and curses. Your command of the \ncycle of life and death is strong. Although you cannot kill someone immediately, \nyou can certainly cause him great misfortune. \nBlight of Aging: By speeding the course of Entropy through a living subject, \nyou cause it to age, sicken or fall prey to injury. You cause the subject to suffer \nfrom one Negative Physical Trait of your choice. Otherwise, you cause the \nsubject to make a Simple Test (win or tie) If he loses the test, one level of damage \nfrom the attack is considered one category more severe (bashing to lethal, lethal \nto aggravated). You do not need to make an attack challenge. You simply affect \nthe natural patterns of Entropy in the target. The Effect lasts for one minute or \nconflict. Grades ofsuccess: Each grade of success allows you to extend the Effect’s \nduration by one grade or add an additional Negative Physical Trait. \nMidwife’s Blessing: By casting good fortune over a living being, you make it \nresistant to harm or disease. The subject becomes more likely to avoid damage, and \nit has a better chance to recover from deleterious conditions. You can remove one \nNegative Physical Trait that has been inflicted by magic, disease, poison or the like, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nalthough you can’t cancel a natural Negative Trait. Alternately, you can shield the \nsubject against harm. Each time the subject takesdamage, it gains a Simple Test. On \na win or tie, one level of the damage becomes one category less severe (bashing to \nnone, lethal to bashing, aggravated to lethal). The effects last for one minute or \nconflict. Grades of Success: Each grade of success allows you to extend the Effect’s \nduration by one grade or cure one additional Negative Physical Trait. \n~ S T E R  \n(ADVANCED) \nEWRWY: A ~ C T  \nTHCBUGHT \nNot only can you disperse physical Patterns, you can affect ephemeral and \nideological constructs. You can make a maze of streets seem more random and \nconfusing, change someone’s mind or turn the passing of minutes and hours into \na welter of jumping progressions. Your control of destiny allows you to mark \nfuture fate and place traces of Entropy through time. \nBinding Oath: You place a compulsion on a willing subject and enforce it \nwith the power of Fate and Destiny. Should the subject choose to break the oath, \nhe suffers the full weight of misfortune immediately. Anyone capable of sensing \nEntropy (with Locate Disorder and Weakness) can tell immediately that the \nindividual is an oathebreaker, and the subject immediately loses all temporary \nWillpower Traits. This oath lasts for one scene or hour. Grades ofsuccess: Each \ngrade of success allows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nMutate Ephemera: The roads of chance carry off even thought, space and \ntime. You can destroy a subject’s thoughts, causing the victim to suffer a Negative \nMental Trait of your choice for one conflict. You also stun the victim with \nindecision for her next turn if you win a subsequent Mental Challenge. Placing \ngood or bad luck over an area, you cause it to prosper or wither at your command, \nso that a subject’s mundane Background of Allies, Contacts, Influence or Resources \ngains or loses one level for a single downtime, Note that you can affect only one \nBackground and subject at a time thus. You can’t grant fortune to all of your \nBackgrounds while cursing all of your adversary’s. Grades of Success: No effect. \nP€BRCES \nThe most vulgar and dynamic mages are those who study Forces. Every \nuniversal power and energy is the bailiwick of this Sphere. Through Forces, a \nmage manipulates fire, light, electricity, sound and their opposites cold, dark- \nness, stillness and silence. Every force is essentially a Pattern of Quintessence in \nmotion. With this magic, the mage senses and manipulates those Patterns. \nDifferent forces have different Effects. If you hit someone with electricity, \nthe damage is bashing, but it penetrates most armor. You will usually incapaci- \ntate a foe before killing. Kinetic damage can be bashing or lethal at your choice, \ndepending on whether you spread it over an area or strike in a point or edge. \nExtreme cold inflicts lethal damage. Fire damage is aggravated. Silence or \ndarkness “damage” causes the subject to lose the sense in question for the \nduration of the Effect. The Forces Sphere tends to inflict a lot of damage \ncompared to other Spheres, and it has other special combat Effects as well (such \nas setting things on fire or crushing them). \nAPPWNTICE \n(BASIC) FCBRCES: \nPERCEIVE FCBRCES \nYoucansenselocalPattemsofforce.Kineticenergy,radiowaves, \nheat sourcesandthe \nlike are all clearly visible to you. Sources of forces like batteries and radioactive substances \nare outlined clearly to your perceptions, even if those forces are normally invisible. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDarksight: By tuning your senses to infrared, sound waves or the like, you \nbecome capable of seeing even in darkness. You might take on the senses of a \ntype of animal or borrow the capability to see elemental animas. Whatever the \ncase, you suffer no penalties for darkness. The Effect lasts for one minute or \nconflict. You may grant these senses to another person, in which case they have \na base duration of only one turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of success allows \nyou to extend the Effect's duration by one grade. \nQuantify Energy: You become aware of the types and quantities of energy \naround you. You can clearly see the Forces shield of another mage, spot invisible \nradiation or even see radio waves in the air (although you don't understand \nthem). You gain a +1 Trait bonus to control or channel energy. Most forms of \nenergy rely on Science, Computer and Technology Ability, for instance. The Effect \nlasts for one minute or conflict. You may grant these senses to another person, \nin which case they have a base duration of only one turn. Grades of Success: Each \ngrade of success allows you to extend the Effect's duration by one grade. \nINITIATE (BASIC) FCBRCES: \nCCBNTRCBL \n~ I N C B R  \nP~RCES \nAlthough you can't yet create forces or change them into other forces, you can \nredirect and divert them. You can bend sound waves so that they travel in a \ndifferent direction, cause light to bend around yourself or alter kinetic motion. \nYour control extends to a single force or collection that affects something up to the \nsize of aperson. Attacks made with these Forces Effects inflict one level of damage. \nElectrical Chaos: By shifting the flow of electricity or diverting it to different \nconcentrations, you cause it to play havoc with a piece of electronic machinery. \nA targeted electrical device (like a car starter or a computer) goes haywire and \nbecomes useless for a full turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of success allows you \nto extend the Effect's duration by one grade or to affect one additional Pattern. \nEnergy Shield: A barrier that diverts one type of force defends you against \ncertain attacks. You can pick one type of force to shield against: kinetic energy, \nlight, heat, sound, hard radiation and so on. Anything that relies on said force loses \ntwo health levels of effectiveness when it strikes you. Therefore, you could easily \n8 block most minor attacks. A shield against light bends light around you and makes \n' you physically invisible, although it renders you blind as well. A shield against \nsound makes you totally silent but unable to hear. A shield against gravity allows \nyou to float effortlessly, although you'd have to push off from something in order \nto move. The shield persists for a full turn. You may grant this shield to another \nperson, in which case it has a base duration of only one turn. Alternatively, you \n- could redirect an existing force by making an attack challenge so that it strikes a \ntarget, and the force would score one level of damage (presumably bashing, lethal \nor aggravated based on the attack type). You could, therefore, make a swung fist \nfeel like it connected with someone else or cause a sword-blow to injure adifferent \ntarget. Eachforceshieldorformofredirection (such asFire Shield, Kinetic Shield, \nRedirect Cold, Redirect Silence and so on) is a different rote. Grades of Success: \nEach grade of success allows you to extend the Effect's duration by one grade, \nexcept for an attack. For an attack, each grade of success inflicts an extra level of \ndamage or allows you to affect one additional Pattern. \n, \n! \n, \n: \nDISCIPLE \n( I N T ~ ~ I A T ~  \n%RCB T W S ~ E  \n~I~NCBR%RC\nI a \nNot only can you manipulate small forces or groups of forces, you can \n* change them into other types of forces. You can turn sound into electricity, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nconvert fire into darkness or replace kinetic energy with radio waves. Channel- \ning and redirecting local forces allows you to create bolts of lightning or fly \nthrough the air. Attacks with this level of Forces typically inflict two levels of \ndamage, unless some other special effect is added on. \nFriction Curse: You turn the subject’s kinetic energy into heat or cold. \nEach time the subject takes a physical action, it must win a Simple Test. Failure \ninflicts one level of lethal damage and means that the action fails. This Effect \ntypically lasts one turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of success allows you to \nextend the Effect’s duration by one grade or to affect one additional Pattern. \nTelekinesis: By manipulating local forces and turning them into kinetic \nenergy (or altering the direction of other kinetic forces), you can grab an object \nor person, shove it around or hammer into it. You can similarly transmute forces \ninto fire, lightning or the like. The end result is the same. You can snatch and \nmove an object at walking speed by winning a Mental vs. Physical Challenge, \nor you can attack it magically for three levels of lethal damage (aggravated if you \nconvert forces to fire). You can even lift yourself up and fly. Duration of the \nEffect is one turn. To manipulate an object, you must exert full concentration. \nGrades ofSuccess: Eachgrade of success allows you to extend the Effect’sduration \nby one grade, except on an attack. For an attack, each grade of success inflicts \nan extra level of damage or allows you to affect one additional Pattern. \nADEPT \n(INTEIUI-I!EDIAT~ F~RCES: \nCCBNTREBL \n~ A I ~ R  \nF~RCES \nHaving surpassed the simpler elements, you now have mastery over com- \nplex mixtures of force, grandiose displays and the chaotic coruscations of Forces z \nPatterns far beyond your own scale. You can redirect huge concentrations of \nenergy or even powerful primal forces like radiation and gravity. Your ability to \nfocus and channel forces typically causes attacks that inflict two health levels of \ndamage, barring some other special effect. \nEmbracing the Earth Mother: Gravity intensifies around the subject, \npinning it in place and causing injury. The subject must beat you in a challenge \nof his Physical Traits versus your Mental Traits to even be capable of movement. \nEven if he wins, he still suffers two levels of lethal crushing damage each turn. \nAlternatively, you could intensify forces such as heat, causing the victim to burst \ninto flames, or you could redirect forces away from yourself for major protection. \nA direct Forces attack (like channeling a huge stroke of lightning) at this level \ninflicts two health levels of damage, based on the attack type. A force shield of \nthis magnitude blocks the first two levels of any such attack against you. Any of \nthese manifestations except a strike lasts for one minute/ conflict if you cast it ,t \nupon yourself, or one turn if you cast it upon someone else. Each type of attack :I \nor shield (Channel Fire, Deflect Radiation and so on) is a different rote. Grades : \nofSuccess: Each grade of success allows you to extend the Effect’sduration by one \ngrade, except for an attack. For an attack, each grade of success inflicts an extra \nlevel of damage or allows you to affect one additional Pattern. \nStorm Watch: You manipulate titanic forces to control the weather. You \ncan settle fog over a small area, disperse clouds, cause gentle rain on an otherwise \nclear day and so on. Once conjured, the weather takes a normal course. Unless \nit’s maintained, for instance, snow disperses rapidly or rain pours down and then \nends. Since you’re only redirecting existing forces, you can’t make major \nchanges to the weather. The Narrators and Storyteller should alert the game’s ’ \n21 \n1 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nother players to changes of this magnitude. To manipulate weather continu- \nously, you must exert your full concentration.

(Given enough time and effort, of course.) Any \ngreat force can not only be manipulated but transformed as well. The mage can \ngrab all of the kinetic energy in an area and turn it to silence, for instance, \nrendering a battlefield immediately still and quiet. Strikes with this level of \nForces typically inflict three health levels of damage, perhaps even reducing an \nopponent to cinders on the spot. \nInferno: You grab all the local forces of heat, light, energy, whatever, and turn \nthem into a raging blast that consumes the target. You make anormal attack. If you \nare successful, the subject suffers three health levels of damage of a type appropriate \nto the strike immediately. You can also spread the damage over a large area, inflicting \na level of damage on everyone in a room if they fail to evade your mass attack. Grades \nof Success: Each grade of success inflicts an extra health level of damage. \nTempest in a Teapot: You turn tremendous forces to your whims in order to \nmake major manipulations to the weather. You can change local weather patterns \nas you desire: Perhaps you disperse clouds while heating the area, or you chill a place \nas winds die down and snow starts to form. The Effect typically lasts for one turn. To \nmanipulate weather continuously, you must exert full concentration. Grades of \nSuccess: Eachgradeofsuccessallows you toextendtheEffect’sdurationbyonegrade. \nAll living, growing things undergo constant change. The Patterns of Life take \nin and give out Quintessence in a dance that connects them fundamentally to the \nuniverse. With Life magic, the mage can sense and guide these beautiful and resilient \nPatterns. At first, the mage has only rudimentary awareness of the most fragile Life, \nbut with time and experience, she learns to see the deeper secrets of complex and self- \nems, until she becomes able to shape the experience ofLife to her desires. \ns to create new beings, to change living creatures or to spur an early death. \nLife magic that is used to harm often manifests as lesions or hemorrhaging. Such \nattacks often strike as mystical black energies or as “coincidental” diseases or injuries. \nUsing Llfe magic to heal is vulgar if the Effect heals aggravated wounds. Plus, after \na subject is healed with Life magic, further Life healing magic cannot be used on it \n- \nagain until it has suffered new injuries. Typically a mage is better at healing himself \nthan at healing or harmingothers. With the Basic levels of power, the mage can heal \na onehealthlevelofpersonalinjury. Withlntermediatepower, hecanheal twohealth \nlevels. With Advanced power, he can heal three health levels. All of these limits \nI decrease by one level when the mage uses them on someone else. \ning another Life Pattern generally requires a magical attack, be it a \nell or a hands-on manipulation. \nNTICE (BASIC) LIFE: SENSE \nLIFE \nThe mage has an intuitive awareness of living things. The mage can feel the \nexistence of life all around her, and she can hone her perceptions to watch its \nI , 1% energies flow. Simple magics allow her to determine age, gender, state of health \nand the like with ease. \nI I \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nLife Scan: With a simple scrying tool, you search out nearby Life Patterns and \nidentify them. You may separate friend from foe easily even under harsh or low- \nvisibility conditions, and you can determine the presence and number of other \nentities, even those that are otherwise physically invisible (such as rats hiding in \na trash can or a mage bending light away with Forces magic). As long as you can \nsense a target, you can determine immediately whether it’s someone you know. \nEven if it’s not, you can tell its general type if it’s something you’ve encountered \nbefore. You would recognize a dog or human easily, but you might know only that \na werewolf or yeti was “something never before encountered.” The Effect lasts for \none minute or conflict. You may grant these senses to another person, in which \ncase, they have a base duration of only one turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of \nsuccess allows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nPrayer of Healing Revelation: A simple prayer, chant or divination \ngrants you vision of a subject’s health. You recognize the flaws in a Life Pattern \nthat indicate illness, poisons, physical weaknesses and the like. You determine \nautomatically the remaining health levels of any creature you sense, and if you \nwin a Static Mental Challenge (difficulty of the subject’s Mental Traits), you \ncan determine one Negative Physical Trait of a subject with a turn of scrutiny. \nYou gain a one Trait resolution bonus on tests involving health or physical \ncondition (1ikeMedicine). The Effect lasts for one minute or conflict. You may \ngrant these senses to another person, in which case they have a base duration \nof only one turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of success allows you to extend \nthe Effect’s duration by one grade. \nINITIATE (BASIC) LIFE: ALTER \nSI~PLE \nPATERNS \nThe early manipulation of Life Patterns begins with those most near and \nfamiliar. The simple Patterns of rudimentary life forms and the mage’s own \nPattern. The willworker can influence the growth processes of simple creatures \n(from bacteria to plants) and cause them to grow in specific ways, although she \ncan’t yet make them take on totally new characteristics. She can also affect her \nown Pattern as well, encouraging growth and healing. \nAlter Simple Creature: You reshape some of the simple threads of a basic \nLife Pattern. Doing so encourages or discourages growth and healing. As a result, \nyou can cause the subject to heal one health level or to suffer one health level \nof lethal or bashing damage. Grades of Success: Each grade of success allows you \nto heal or inflict another health level, or to affect an additional creature. \nHeal Self: Because you are most familiar with your own Life Pattern, you \ncan mend your wounds and heal your injuries. Grades of Success: Each grade of \nsuccess allows you to heal another health level or affect an additional creature. \nThe mage can now grasp and manipulate simple life forms, changing them \nto suit her whims and mutating them into new shapes as long as the base body \nform remains roughly similar. She can encourage or discourage simple growth in \nmore complex Patterns, up to and including herself. Although she can’t yet \ntransform complex Patterns completely, she begins to learn to influence them, \nand she can make a startling array of personal changes. \nBetter Body: You improve your own Pattern as desired, gifting yourself with \nincreased speed, better strength, more health, body armor or similar benefits. The \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nonly limits are your imagination and skill. When you invoke Better Body, you may \nchoose one of the following benefits: gain three Physical Traits, gain one extra \nHealthy health level, gain the ability to resist one level of bashing or lethal damage \nfrom each attack by winning a Simple Test, act first in each turn, gain a physical \nsurvival change (gills, wings, temperature tolerance) , gain natural weapons (strike \nfor lethal damage). This Effect lasts for one minute/ conflict. You can also use this \nEffect on plants or simple creatures (bacteria, algae and the like), with a base \nduration of one turn. Grades ofsuccess: Each grade of success allows you to invoke \none additional benefit or increase the Effect’s duration by one grade. Each grade \nof duration that elapses causes the subject to suffer one bashing health level of \ndamage that cannot be soaked or healed until the Effect ends. \nRip the Man-Body: The Euthanatoi practice cutting Patterns apart to \ninflict injury. Conversely, reversals of the process can heal. You can inflict or \ncure one health level of lethal or bashing damage on any subject. Grades of \nSuccess: Each grade of success allows you to heal or inflict another health level \nor to affect an additional creature. \nAEPT (INERIITEDIATE) LIR: ALTERCCB~PLEX \nPATTERNS \nYour command ofLife Patterns allows you to metamorphose yourself entirely, \nto reshape simple creatures into whatever form you desire or to make complex \ntransformations to the Patterns of people and higher animals. You can assume any \nliving shape you wish, turn plants into crabs or fish into lizards, andevengift people \nwith unnatural capabilities and extensions of their normal limits. \nMutate Form: As with Better Body, you create modifications to a Life \nPattern, but you can do so in any other creature. You could, for instance, give \nanother person gills or the like. If you rework your personal Pattern, you can \ntransform it into something else entirely. You can become a lion, a bird, a small \ntree or the like. Similarly, you can twist a simple Pattern into any other simple \nshape (such as by turning leaves into lobster, for instance). \nIf you work this Effect upon yourself, the base duration is one minute/ \nconflict. If you work it on something else, the base duration is one turn. If you \nremain in a foreign form for more than a day, you must expend a Willpower Trait \neach day or else lose your mind and become the very creature that you have \ntransmuted into. If you do not spend this Trait, you will stay in the form forever \nwith the mind of a beast (or plant) until someone counters the magic. Grades of \nSuccess: Each grade of success allows you to invoke one additional benefit or \nincrease the Effect’s duration by one grade. Each grade of duration that elapses \ncauses an enhanced subject to suffer one bashing health level of damage that \ncannot be soaked or healed until the Effect ends. You do not suffer this damage \nfor transmuting yourself into a new form, but you risk losing your mind if you stay \nchanged for too long. \nPhysiological Emotion Control: Stimulation of various hormones, es- \nsences and bodily functions causes a subject’s behavior to shift as you desire. You \n’ cause the subject to experience one emotion of your choice if you win a Social \ne ” Challenge against the subject’s Physical Traits. Use one simple word (such as \nlove, anger, fear, curiosity, etc.) to describe the emotion. The subject should \n~ roleplay this feeling (have a Narrator enforce if necessary). The Effect lasts for \none minute/conflict. Grades ofSuccess: You can affect one additional subject per \ngrade, or you can increase the duration by one grade for each grade of success. \n; \n‘ I ’  \n~ \n’ \n‘ \ns :; ; ; ’ \n1 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrThs-rm(&v~~cd T R A N ~ ~ C C B ~ L ~  \nPATTERNS \nThe mage can totally rewrite his own Pattern, turning into whatever shape \nhe desires. Simple creatures can be similarly mutated into any end state, while \ncomplex creatures may be altered in large ways to turn them into other creatures \nor gift them with unnatural abilities. \nAnimal Form: You turn the subject into an animal. You could turn men \ninto pigs or dogs into soldiers, at your whim. You must make a magical attack to \nstrike. If you succeed, the subject transforms for one minute/ conflict. A subject \nthat remains in animal form for more than a day must expend Willpower to \nretain its original mind, as with Mutate Form. Healing a subject repairs two \nhealth levels of damage, or you may cause two health levels of direct injury. \nGrades of Success: Each grade of success allows you to affect an additional \ncreature or to add one grade of duration. \nPerfect Metamorphosis: When you alter your own Pattern, you may do so to \nsuit any of your whims. You can shift into any form from clam to eagle and anything \nelse you can imagine, even creating the traits of an imaginary creature. You take on \nthe capabilities of the specified entity, although you may not know how to use them, \nand you do not gain additional magical powers automatically. (Therefore, you could \nfly as a bird, albeit clumsily, but you could not breathe fire as a dragon.) You remain \nshifted for one minute/ conflict, but you never suffer any difficulties of mentality in \nthis state because you merge your Pattern with the characteristics of the desired \ncreature. With a complex spell, you can whisk away age, injury or disease, healing \nyourself of three levels of damage or curing up to three inflicted Negative Physical \nTraits. Healing is instant and lasting, so the wounds don’t reappear later. Grades of \nSuccess: Each grade of success allows you to heal an additional level of damage, to \nremove an additional Negative Physical Trait or to add one grade of duration. \nr€IATER \nBase matter may be crude and simple, but it forms the vast stretches of the \ninanimate world. Any Pattern that is sedate and without living qualities or \nenergetic characteristics is the purview of Matter, which encompasses a large \nquantity of things that a mage might manipulate. \nAPPRENTICE \n(BASIC) ~TJATTER: \n~-~ATTER \nPERCEPTICBNS \nA mage’s simple enchantments, experiments and studies allow for precise \nmeasurements of matter, including determinations of its magical and physical charac- \nteristics, hidden features and near-exact scientific statistics. For some mages, this \nknowledge comes through alchemical analysis or intuitive touch. Others use techno- \nlogical devices, mysterious powders, experimental light-beams or weights and measures. \nAnalyze Substance: You can determine the gross properties of a piece of \nmatter immediately. You know what sort of substance it is (or isn’t), how much \nmass it has, what it can hold, what sorts of properties it has, whether it’s ductile \nor flammable and so on. You gain a one Trait bonus on the resolution of any \nchallenge that involves influencing, building or destroying pure Matter that you \nsense in this fashion, such as using Crafts to make an item or just hitting \nsomething with a hammer to break it. \nThe Effect lasts for one minute or conflict. You may grant these sensa to \nanother person, in which case they have a base duration of only one turn. Grades of \nSuccess: Eachgrade of success allows you to extend the Effect’sduration by one grade. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nFragments of Dream: Careful scrutiny of a Matter Pattern allows you to \ndetermine its hidden features and special qualities. If a particular item has \nconcealed compartments, secret catches, traps or the like, you can discern them \nimmediately (although you may need to make a Static Mental Challenge if \nthey’re particularly cunningly built). The difficulty varies based on the Storyteller’s \ndiscretion. You can even sense Patterns within or beyond other Mutter Patterns, \nup to a range of 15 paces plus three paces per Arete Trait. \nThe Effect lasts for one minute or conflict. You may grant these senses to another \nwmn, in which case thev have a base duration of only one turn. Grades of Success: \nEach grade of success extends the Effect’s duration by one grade or doubles-its range. \nINITIATE (BASIC) ~ ~ ~ A T T E R :  \nBASIC TRANS~UTATIGN \nAlthough the mage can’t actually change matter from one form into another \nyet, he can alter the basic composition of homogenous substances. A chunk of \nbrick turns into a loaf of bread, or a metal wire becomes apiece of straw. The caster \ncan turn nearly any common material substance into another substance, as long \nas the mage doesn’t transmute its shape or state magically, or alter its properties \nfrom the norms of the object. That is, the mystic can make a jug of wine turn into \ngasoline, but he couldn’t change it into rock or air (because that would change \nstate) or into jet fuel (because that’s too complex a substance). \nMelt and Reform: You turn anobject into an easily malleable substance, such \nas turning a rock wall into clay or a steel statue into butter. You can manipulate \nthe resulting material easily. Once it transforms back, it retains whatever shape \nchanges you made. If you have an appropriate Crafts skill, you could even make \nworks of art from otherwise rigid or brittle materials like obsidian, all with your bare \nhands. The material retains the melted form for one turn. Grades of Success: Each \ngrade of success allows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nStraw into Gold: Through alchemical transformation or pseudo-scientific \nmanipulations, you cause an object to turn from one substance into another. If \nyou use a vulgar Effect, you can turn simple substances into gold, diamonds, \ntitanium or other valuables, as long as they retain a homogenous substance. \nWith a coincidental working, you can cause a subject to seem stronger than it \nfirst appeared or perhaps more valuable than a first glance might have indicated. \nThe Effect lasts for one turn, just long enough to strengthen or weaken an \nobject or allow it to use special characteristics of the new form. Grades ofSuccess: \nEach grade of success allows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nWith enoughsuccesses, you might manage to turn a simple object into avaluable \none long enough to bilk a merchant once. \nDISCIPLE \n(INWIUI-IEDIAT~ \nI ~ T T E R :  \nALTER \nFCERITI \nWith metaphysical motions, the willworker can stretch, compress or alter basic \nMatter Patterns. The object in question responds, perhaps even without a physical \ntouch, and quivers, reshapes and changes state according to the mage’s manipulations. \nDestroy Structures: You tear apart the Pattern and remove the bonds that hold \nan item together. A series of quick manipulations causes it to fall apart or disperse \ninto dust or gas. Each use of the Effect causes the item to lose one health level or one \nTrait. Ifitlosesallofitshealthlevels/Traits, \nitdisintegrates.Youmustmakeanattack \nto affect an object that someone else is holding. Grades ofSuccess: Each additional \ngrade of success causes one additional health level/ Trait of damage. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSculpture: Instead of changing an object’s composition and shaping the \nresulting putty, you just grab and manipulate the Pattern of any object you can \nsense. The object changes shape in response to your ministrations. You can make \na sword bend or even cause a set of clothing to wrap around and constrict the \nwearer, perhaps preventing movement for a turn or so as the subject tries to fight \nhis way out. You must make an attack to affect an object someone else is holding. \nYou can typically manipulate an object as if you could shape it with both hands, \nto the limits of what you could do in one turn. Grades of Success: No effect. \nADEFT \n( k m m ~ ~ d  \n~ € I A T T ~  \nC~IPLW \nT R A N ~ ~ ~\nNo Pattern is immutable to the mage. Matter Patterns can be combined \nfreely, changed in state, mixed with other properties or otherwise transformed \nas you choose. You can cause an object to take on some property of some other \nobject briefly, or you can combine two objects into a resulting alloy. \nAlloy: You press two items together and cause them to turn into a \nhomogenous substance. Doing so can be as simple as shoving a bar of steel into \na block of wood without resistance, or as complex as finely mixing together a \ncombination of gold and ash. The two objects have a shared set of properties. For \ninstance, the block of wood could still bum, while the mixture of gold and ash \ncould be sprinkled as a glittering, blackened dust. You should have a Narrator \nmake a special item card for your alloy. Once merged, the two objects remain \ncombined. You can merge any two objects that you could push together with \nyour hands. Grades ofSuccess: No effect. \nTransformers: You reshape and repair an item easily with your Matter skills \nor cause it to take on totally new shapes and properties. Therefore, you could \nsharpen an ancient sword or repair the tiny clockworks of an ancient pocket-watch \nall by magic, as long as you have the right knowledge of Crafts, Science or \nTechnology. Your transformations are limited only by your theoretical knowledge. \nYou can change the item’s properties as long as it doesn’t exceed the powers of your \nMatter skills. (So unless you’re a Master, you can’t work with radioactive properties \nor actual violations of mass/density/volume.) You don’t have to actually work the \nitem, just use your magic. You might (for instance) sprinkle a little powder or oil \nover something and magically find that it works better than ever. The resulting \ntransformation lasts for one minute/ conflict. Grades of Success: Each grade of \nsuccess allows YOU to extend the Effect’s duration bv one made. \n; \n_n \nNo longer constrained to physical common sense, the mage can rebuild an \nobject with any combination of physical properties. Items can be transmuted \neasily into strange and irrational substances, or they can even be made to change \ntheir interactions with other matter. \nAlter Weight: You change the weight properties of objects, generally by \ndoubling or halving them. An object that you affect doesn’t change size, density \nor strength, but its weight does change. You might be able to push around a car \nmade lighter, or you could make a sword too heavy to use. An item with increased \nweight doubles its Negative Traits of Heavy, Clumsy or Slow (a Heavy sword \nbecomes Heavy x2) in addition to its actual weight change. A lighter object may \nno longer be Heavy or Slow, but it will certainly be more Clumsy (trade the Traits), \nbecause it’s too light to wield effectively. However, you can certainly pick up \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nobjects made lighter, or make something too heavy to move. A heavy car wouldn’t \nbe drivable, for instance. A Narrator may be necessary to moderate these Effects, \nas they can be quite wide-ranging. You can affect only one object at a time, and \nthe Effect lasts for one minute/ conflict. Grades of Success: Each grade of success \nallows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nMatter Association: Reworking a Pattern’s associations, you cause it todissociate \nfrom other forms of Matter, or to take on special new associations. For instance, you \ncould make a bullet that acts like acid when it hits kevlar, or one that just passes right \nthrough kevlar entirely. You can only cause a given Pattern to exhibit one form of \ndissociation or customized association. Therefore, your sword might pass right through \nyour foe’s kevlar vest (and ignore its Traits), but it wouldn’t be able to also pass through \nhis metal rifle. The change lasts for one minute/conflict. Grades ofSuccess: Each grade \nof success allows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \n~ I N D  \nWill focuses magic, and thought leads to Pattern, but where does the mind \nbegin? Mages may not know the answer, but many study the secrets of conscious- \nness intently. Even divested of physical form, the Sphere of Mind carries potent \nsecrets. A skilled mage can manipulate thoughts, project emotions, command \nothers and even send his awareness reeling through the cosmos to pluck secrets \nfrom places where the material body cannot go. \n~ P R E ~ C E  \n(BASIC) ~ I N D  \nSENSE \nTHWGHTS \nAND E~I-ICDTICBNS \nEven crude mastery of Mind improves a mage’s skills far beyond human norms. \nThe mage becomes hypersensitive to emotions and mental states, including his own. \nBy focusing his will, he can clear his mind, focus on multiple subjects, channel his \nMind Empowerment: With a few simple exercises, you clear your thoughts \nand improve your focus immensely. You can function like a skilled calculator \nand process information rapidly, enhance your memory and even concentrate \non multiple things, allowing you to think about a problem while taking an \naction. You can carry and use a calculator or notepad to simulate this mental \nprowess even if your character doesn’t have such a device, as long as this Effect \nis working. With a static Mental Challenge (difficulty of the opponent’s Mental \nTraits), you can see auras, allowing you to sense the emotional state of your \nsubject or tell if he’s lying. You gain a one-Trait bonus to resolution of all Mental \nChallenges. This Effect lasts for one minute/ conflict. If you cast this Effect on \nsomeone else, the Effect has a base duration of one turn. Grades of Success: Each \ngrade of success allows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade or gain \nan additional one-Trait bonus to resolution of Mental Challenges. If you \nimprove your Mental bonus to more than one Trait, you suffer one unhealable \nand unsoakable level of bashing damage for each time grade of the duration, due \nto your Pattern’s stress of holding an overly charged superhuman capability. \nNo-Mind: Clearing away your thoughts, you become sensitized to the \npresence of other minds around you. You can tell if anything within the area has \na mental Pattern, and you discern animals from people, determine gender and \nsense relative positions automatically. If someone uses concealing magics, you can \nsense the subject if you can win a Mental Challenge against him. Against mental \ninvisibility this Effect lets you spot the subject. Against physical invisibility, you \n~. \nI1 ! thoughts with incredible efficiency and sense the presence of thought nearby. \n** \nI \na \n; \n’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nstill can’t see the subject (and, therefore, you suffer a penalty of two Traits and a \nforced retest when striking), but you can detect his presence. This Effect sense lasts \nfor the duration of a minute or conflict. You may cast this Effect on another person, \nin which case the base duration is one turn. Grades ofSuccess: Eachgrade of success \nallows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nINITIATE (BASIC) ~ I N D :  \n  ENTAL I~PULSE \nNow open to the fleeting ways of the mind, the mage can sense and decipher \nbasic surface thoughts. Emotions become clear images, and the feelings of \nResonance are visible. By communicating mental patterns, the mage can send \nemotional impulses or place a strong feeling in an area. \nEmpathic Projection: You focus and channel your emotions to send one \nclear emotional impulse to the subject. You must best the subject in a Mental \nChallenge. If you succeed, you can instill one strong emotion. Doing so can have \na variety of effects. The subject may simply feel a clear emotion that you choose \nto impart, such as hope, fear or anger. This projection is not necessarily a clear \nmessage, but it can be enough to let the subject know that you intend something. \nYou can also force the subject to take one reflex action such as a cough, a laugh \nor a sudden look of panic or sadness. Although this action is little more than a \ndistraction, it can be critical in tense social situations. Finally, you can simply \n“scream” a strong emotional pulse into the victim’s mind, inflicting one health \nlevel of bashing damage. Grades of Success: Each grade allows you to affect one \nadditional target or add one level of damage. \nPsychic Impression: You place a large amount of Resonance on an area, giving \nit a Resonance Trait of your choice. This Trait must be a duplicate of one Resonance \nTrait that you have yourself. The Resonance may apply if you cast an appropriate \nspell, or ifsomeoneelse in the areadoes so, and it causestheemotion invested to seem \nto have weight in the locale. The place will hold the emotion that you project into \nit, and even normal people who enter the area can sense it. You should have a \nNarrator place a special Resonance card at the entryways to the room that you invest. \nThe Effect typically lastsfor one scene/ hour. Grades ofsuccess: Each grade of success \nallows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nDISCIPLE \n(INTEW~EDIATE) ~ I N D :  \n~JZNTAL \nLINK \nThe mage can now enter the sublime levels of the mind, probing deep into \nthe subconscious. Beyond the layers of surface thought are symbols and con- \ncepts. Altering or playing with these concepts allows the mage to communicate \nwithout regard for the barriers of language, send thoughts, dive into dreams or \ndiscern the meanings behind various languages. \nProbe Thoughts: By besting a subject in a Mental Challenge, you can \npenetrate his thoughts and bore into the subject’s memory or senses. You can \ndemand that the subject relay to you a minute or conflict’s worth of memory or \nsensory information. As you probe for thoughts, they come to the fore of the \nsubject’s mind unbidden, so the victim may be aware that something is amiss, \neven ifhe can’t defend himself. A probe of this sort takes a full turn, and it garners \none piece of information or allows you to ask one question that the subject must \nanswer truthfully to the best of his belief. If a subject doesn’t honestly know \nsomething or is wrong, you get that information with no way to verify it. Grades \nof Success: Each grade of success allows you to ask an additional question. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTelepathy: True thought-transmission lets the mage send and receive \nimpulses and ideas stripped beyond language. You can exercise Telepathy to \nengage in silent communication. (Put two fingers to your temple to indicate the \nuse of Telepathy.) Unless someone else uses Telepathy, this conversation can’t be \noverheard, although someone using No-Mind will be aware that it is taking place, \nand someone who uses Probe Thoughts on you or your target will realize that \nTelepathy is in effect. If you try to send a thought or engage in aconversation with \nan unwilling subject, you must best him in a Mental Challenge. Subjects are \nunwilling by default, since it requires actual consent and concentration to lower \none’s mental defenses. This Effect allows you to communicate for one minute/ \nconflict freely. You may instead choose to send a blast of telepathic energy, which \ninflicts two health levels of bashing damage on a successful Mental Challenge. \nGrades of Success: Each grade of success allows you to add one additional subject \nto the telepathic linkage or extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nADEPT \n(INTENIIEDIATE) ~ I N D :  \nCCDNTRCDL \nCCBNSCICDUS \n~ I N D  \nNot only can the mage read thoughts and decipher languages, he can \nimplant his own thoughts and impress his behaviors upon a subject. The mage \ncan invade a mind and overtake it or use her own thoughts to shield it. \nManipulate Memory: You force your thoughts into the subject’s subconscious \nmind and rewrite his memories. You can describe to the subject the memory that you \nimplant. Doing so takes only a turn and a Mental Challenge, but you can overwrite the \nsubject’s memory with anything you can imagine, no matter how bizarre or surreal, or \nyou can simply erase the memories forever. You can affect up to one minute’s or \nconflict’s worth of memory. Grades of Success: Each grade of success allows you to \nextend the length of memory that you can manipulate by one duration grade. \nPossession: If you can defeat an opponent in a Mental Challenge after \ncasting this Effect, you overlay his thoughts and force your own into the victim’s \nmind. In game terms, your body becomes comatose but you take control of the \nvictim. You direct the victim’s body to move and react as you desire, although \nthe subject will not violate his Nature or commit a blatantly self-destructive act. \nYou can choose to take partial control (causing the subject’s arm to flail about \n; unnaturally, for instance), or you can override the victim’s mind (in which case \nhe even thinks that the thoughts are his own, which may in turn lead to him \nthinking he’s crazy). This Effect lasts for one turn.

The mage can untether his psyche to journey in realms \nof mental strangeness, send his consciousness to other planes or even wipe out \nor change the personalities of others. \nAstral Projection: You travel out of your body, which becomes comatose, \n’, and send your consciousness forth to roam on its own. You use Mental Traits for \n’ combat and Willpower in place of health while in this form. Effects that sense \n‘ consciousness will detect your thoughts, but you are otherwise intangible and \nbodiless. Casting magic may be difficult without your foci, but you can return to \n’ \n* your body at will unless you’re somehow trapped or lost. By spending a \n’ I a b  Willpower Trait, you may manifest as a ghostly image for one turn. You can \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n==.---- \ntravel at the speed of thought near the physical world, although you must use a \nsensory spell to detect it. You can use Possession to take other bodies while you \nare astrally projected. Indeed, if you lose all of your Willpower, your mind spirals \noff into realms of pure thought, and your only recourse is to somehow find a body \nand take it over. Astral Projection lasts for one scene/ hour. Grades of Success: \nEach grade of success extends the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nCreate Mind: With a phenomenal feat, you literally create a new mind from \nnothingness. This consciousness has personality traits that you direct but it may \nwell grow and change beyond your initial parameters. Unless somehow given a \nbody, the mind will drift lost into realms of thought. If you’ve wiped away \nsomeone’s personality, though (perhaps with Manipulate Memory), you might \nput a new mind in place or you create an alternative personality for yourself. Once \ncreated, a mind has an existence of its own. You can’t make a mind that has more \nMental Traits than one less than your total. Grades of Success: No effect. \nPRIlTE \nAll things spring from Prime, the Sphere of essential creation. Quintes- \nsence, the very energy of the cosmos, is the energy of Prime. Naturally, Prime is \nat once an intangible and very difficult Sphere to understand, but it is also a \nkeystone of magic. Only by use of Prime can mages channel the energy necessary \nto create true Patterns or empowered magical Effects. \nAPPRENTICE \n(BASIC) P N ~ E :  \n~ H E R I C  \nSENSES \nAt first, the mage learns to expand his senses into the realms of Quintes- \nsence. The mage can see or sense Quintessence in Patterns or as it flows through \nthe Tapestry. The mage can see the power inherent to Nodes or in mages who \nhold great energies and cast potent spells. The mage can also charge his Avatar \nso that Quintessence will flow in harmony with it. Without at least this \nrudimentary knowledge of Prime, the mage can store only that energy he garners \ndirectly through his Avatar Background. \nConsecration: By suffusing your own Pattern with your natural Qumtes- \nsence, you cause your Resonance to bleed over on to the objects that you carry. \nOne item can be consecrated to become attuned specifically to you. The item \nchanges with you or travels with you when you perform personal magic. The item \ngains any immunities that you have or any benefits you gain. However, the object \nalso becomes an arcane connection back to you, which can make it useful if \nsomeone captures it and uses it with Correspondence. The object Resonates with \nyour energy and grants aone-Trait bonus to anyone who holds it when that enemy ‘1 \nworks magic against you. A consecrated object retains that quality permanently < \nunless you choose specifically to un-consecrate it. Grades of Success: No effect. \n3 )  \nHeart’s Blood: You sacrifice some of your life-force to channel Quintes- \nsence from your own living Pattern. When you cast this Effect, you suffer one \nhealth level of aggravated damage immediately, but you gain one Quintessence \nTrait. Grades of Success: No effect. \nWatch the Weaving: Prime energy is clear to you, and you see magic in \nmotion. You can actually see the weaving in motion as someone casts aspell, and t 1;. \nyou can perceive an Effect that’s already in place, such as a Ward. If you see an \nEffect coming with these senses, you can try to use countermagic on it (see p. \nI r, I., \n136), assuming that you have the other Spheres necessary to know what it’s \n; \n~ \n4:. - \n:J - -  - \nI ;. ,* \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ndoing. These senses last for one minute/ conflict. You can grant these senses to \nsomeone else, in which case they last for one turn. Grades of Success: Each grade \nof success grants the Effect an extra grade of duration. \nINITJATE [BASIC] PIU~I-IE: \nWEAVE \nG~DYLLIC FCDRCE \nTiny diversions and whorls of Prime energy help to nudge the Tapestry in \nconjunction with the mage's will. The mage can empower a weapon with mystic \nenergy so that it inflicts damage directly to a Pattern, or he may even create a \nshining eldritch weapon or bolt. Quintessence stored in items can be turned to \nmagical purposes, making enchanted items. The mage can even use Quintes- \nsence to create entirely new Patterns with other Spheres, essentially making \nsomething whole from nothingness. \nBody of Light: By weaving a little bit of Prime energy into a mirror of your \nPattern, you create an etheric body that can house your psyche or soul. This \nBody of Light gives you a form when you travel in astral realms or send your \npsyche with messages. This body can be sensed with Prime (Watch the \nWeaving), and it shields your psyche from harm while you are in other realms \nof thought. ABody of Light lasts as long as you are projecting your consciousness \nelsewhere, and it allows you to use your Quintessence to absorb damage (instead \nof taking it straight to Willpower). Grades of Success: No effect. \nEnchant Weapon: A reweaving and reinforcing of Prime energy causes a \nstructure to gain etheric power. The object can become a potent weapon that \nstrikes true to the very Pattern of an enemy. You can also enchant an object or \narmor thus so that it has a spiritual and astral form. When you do so, you can \nclaim its Traits even against a spirit or an astral attacker (or use it in conjunction \n6 with your Body of Light while you travel to spiritual and mental realms). An \nenchanted weapon inflicts aggravated damage. Using this Effect costs one Trait \nof Quintessence, and it lasts for one minute/ conflict. Grades of Success: Each \ngrade of success allows you to extend the Effect's duration by one grade. \nHoly Stroke: With a blast of pure Prime, you stab deep into an enemy's \nPattern. This attack manifests as a bolt of light or a weapon of glowing energy. \nCreating such a manifestation costs one Trait of Quintessence. The etheric \nweapon inflicts one level of aggravated damage per strike. A bolt of Prime fires \nas a ranged magical attack, while a Prime hand weapon can be used in place of \na physical blade or bludgeon. If you manifest an actual Prime hand weapon, it \nremains for one minute/ conflict. Grades ofSuccess: Each grade of success allows \nyou to extend the Effect's duration by one grade for a Prime hand weapon. \n6 \nDISCIPLE \n(INTERI-~EDIATE) PRI~I-IE: \nCHANNEL \nQUINTESSENCE \n8 \n' \nThe mage can redirect Quintessence easily and shape its many forms. The \nmage can draw Quintessence from various sources, trade it freely and even turn \nmagical power sources into enchanted items. Even living beings can be en- \nchanted. Their Quintessential energies become infused with strength to strike \ndirectly at other Patterns. \nBond of Blood: Without this rote, you can't draw Quintessence forth from \nNodes or Tass, nor can you give it to other mages or power sources. With each \nuse of this power, you can channel a Trait of Quintessence. Each such transfer \ntakes a turn and an Effect. A mage who doesn't have at least Apprentice-level \nPrime can't store more Traits than his Avatar Background, though. \nI ' \n~ \n~ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nOften this Effect takes the form of passing around a cup or sharing a drink \nof some sort to symbolize the transfer of power, or anointing an object. The \nmage can also take the Quintessence from an object as it’s destroyed and \nchannel a tiny trickle into an Effect. Making a sacrifice of some sort in \nconjunction with this magic lets the mage then spend one free Quintessence \nTrait on an Effect cast immediately thereafter. Once the transfer is done, it \ndoesn’t reverse or disappear. Grades ofsuccess: Each grade of success allows you \nto transfer one additional Quintessence Trait in a turn, although you cannot \ntransfer more than your Avatar rating. \nEnchant Life: Just like the Enchant Weapon Effect, you can spend a \nQuintessence Trait to strengthen a Pattern. The individual so enchanted can \nscore aggravateddamage with unarmed attacks, and he can strike spirits or other \nephemera. This Effect lasts for one minute/conflict. You may cast it on someone \nelse, in which case it lasts for a turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of success \nallows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nLambs to the Slaughter: With the proper rituals and observances, you can \ngain power from a sacrifice. Doing so takes some real work, so you can’t just \nsacrifice something and expect to gain Quintessence. However, if you have a \nraised and cared for sacrificial lamb, a piece of ceremonial jewelry or a similar \nitem properly, you can draw Quintessence from its sacred nature. You must use \nan item that’s been raised carefully and invested with the proper energies. \nTypically, a Narrator or Storyteller will have to approve such an item (or \nanimal) before play and give you a special card for it; you can’t just buy a \nsacrificial lamb at the grocery store. When you destroy the item or sacrifice the \nanimal, you gain one Quintessence Trait for each Trait or health level that it \nhas, to a maximum of your Avatar rating. Grades of Success: No effect. \nADEPT \n(INTERI-I-IEDIATE) PRI~E: \nSUBLI~ATE \n~IUINTESSENCE \nAs the name implies, an Adept can perform acts of sublime manipulation \nwith Quintessence. The Adept can create magical items, even investing them \nwith permanent power if he is skilled and determined enough. Simple unliving \nobjects can be turned into reservoirs of Quintessence, and even concentrated \ninto a permanent battery. The mage can even release the Quintessence that is \nstored in material nonliving objects in order to send it back to the Tapestry. \nLastly, the mage can tap into deep reservoirs of Quintessence to gamer \nadditional energy, even outside places of power. \nCreate Talismans and Artifacts: ATalisman is a mystical device with Arete \nthat has been invested with a tiny portion of a mage’s will. An Artifact is an item \nthat has the ability to invoke certain magical Effects, or that has been permanently \nmagically enchanted. The mage must reweave the Pattern of the item in question, \ninvesting it with strong Prime energy to reinforce the desired magical works. The \ncreation of such a device, although theoretically possible at this level of power, is \nultimately up to the discretion of the Storyteller. Such a creation can’t be done in \na single turn. It’s a heroic working to be accomplished over several stories, often \nwith associated knowledge of other Spheres required to place the enchantments \non the item. You can also make a Soulgem, which is a Periapt (an item that stores \nQuintessence as a battery) that can be used only by you. Grades of Success: \nTypically, you must perform an extensive ritual if you’re going to finish the Effect. \nOnly a Storyteller can approve the permanent creation of a magical item. \n, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nFlames of Purification: This rote takes its name from the Celestial Chorus’ \nversion of the spell, in which ghostly fire illumines the subject while banishing \nit from existence. You release the Prime energy from a Pattern and cause it to fade \nfrom reality. You can attack an object at range. If you succeed, you evaporate one \nof its Traits or health levels with aggravated damage. Doing so can turn the \nobject eventually into nothingness, returning the Pattern to the Tapestry. \nGrades ofSuccess: Each grade of success allows you to inflict one additional level \nof damage or drain one additional Trait from the target. \nWellspring: When you find a place where the Resonance matches up with your \nown Resonance Traits, you can pull out some of that energy to refresh your own \nPattern. You open yourself to the magical emotions and regain your energies. \nGenerally, the place must have a very strong Resonance already. A place with three \nor more Resonance Traits of its own would apply, like a haunted graveyard, a \nmathematical lecture hall dating to antiquity or an ancient fountain where lovers \ncongregate. If the place has any Resonance Traits that match your own, you can gain \none Trait of Quintessence for each matching Resonance Trait. Note that this applies \nonly if the area has naturally occurring Resonance. You can’t use Mind magic to place \nResonanceonanareaandthenhope togainenergyfromit.GradesofSuccess:Noeffect. \nThe Masters of Prime hold some of the most potent of magical secrets, \nnamely the very secrets of magical energy itself. Such a Master can not only \nredirect Prime energy, but he can summon forth Quintessence or even suffuse \nany sort of Pattern with permanent energies designed to give it magical powers. \nQuintessence can be pulled forth even from living Patterns, dispersing them to \nthe Tapestry. The mage can also use Quintessence as a bulwark against Paradox, \nnegating the force of Paradox with the very strength of the cosmos. \nFount of Paradise: You exert a turn of concentration to reseat your Pattern \nwith respect to the Tellurian. If you succeed, you refresh the power of your Avatar \nimmediately. You regain one Trait of Quintessence instantly. Grades of Success: \nEach grade of success grants an additional Trait of Quintessence, up to the limit \nof your Avatar rating. \nE~,SER(&VANCED) \nPme: ALTER \n@ U I N T ~ S S ~ L  \nF L ~ W  \nParadox Ward: With Quintessential energy, you smooth out the worst \nripples of Paradox and enhance your magical Effects. You need only cast this \nEffect and spend one Trait of Quintessence in the turn before casting a \nsubsequent Effect. The resultant Effect garners one less Trait of Paradox. Grades \nof Success: Each grade of success allows you to set one extra Quintessence Trait \nagainst prospective Paradox. \nMaster’s Enchantment: As a Master, you can enchant even living beings \nwith magical powers, or create a living form of Tass (magical fruits, empowered \npets and the like). Much like creating an Artifact or Talisman, this Effect is a \nmatter for the Storyteller’s adjudication. This rote is listed solely to note that such \nmagics are possible at this level of power, even if they’re not easy. Grades ofSuccess: \nTypically you must use a long-term ritual to finish an enchantment of this nature. \nSPIRIT \nReflected in myriad mirror worlds are the realms of Spirit. The Spirit realm \nholds ephemeral counterparts to objects, creatures and places. The entities that \nflit about often serve as perfected ideals of some concept, while emotions play \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsuch a strong part that they shape the very landscape. The realms of Spirit \nencompass every hope, fear or ideal of humanity, and much more besides. \nMages who intend to deal with Spirit have a daunting task ahead. Travel \ninto the spirit realms became difficult long ago. In the modem age it’s nigh- \ndeadly. An unprepared mage who travels into the Umbra may well injure or kill \nhimself. Even those who are cautious learn quickly that the Umbra is a volatile \nplace, ever-changing and too large to be mapped or cataloged, no matter how \nmuch mages might try. Only those heroes who would risk forays into the \nunknown through perilous gates dare to walk the Umbra itself. \nEven without traveling to the Umbra, though, a mage with command of \nSpirit has potent power. Spirits themselves manifest in a multitude of forms, and \nan experienced mage can coax, cajole and deal with many of them. Since a \nspirit’s power does not stem from vulgar magics, the entity can often create \nmystical Effects that might be beyond the capabilities or daring of the mage. This \nproperty of the Sphere allows a mage a great deal of flexibility, for the many spirit \nallies of a diplomatic mage can provide a great deal of variety in their assistance. \nA mage who crosses into the Umbra, or who reaches through to affect a spirit \nthere, must suffer the effects of the Avatar Storm. This hazard causes one level of \naggravated damage for every two Arete Traits the mage has (rounded up). \nA P P w m i c E  [BASIC) SPIRIT: \nSPIRIT \nSENSES \nAs with other rudimentary magics, the first thing a mage learns to do with Spirit \nis to sense the spirit world. The mage can see spirits and visualize the landscape of \nnearby spirit planes. If he is looking into the Umbra, the mage sees a twilight world \nthat seems like a vibrant reflection of the physical, with subtle changes reflecting \nResonance. If he is looking in the Shadowlands of the dead, the mage sees the \ndecrepit afterlife that holds only decaying memories of things that were. \nDetect Possession: Some spirits have the ability to take over hosts. With \nthis simple Effect, you can determine whether a spirit has done so. You simply \nscrutinize a subject for a turn, and you can tell immediately if the individual is \nsomehow possessed or influenced by a spirit. You can also tell if a spirit has cast \nits powers over a person, be it for protection or cursing. This detection sense lasts . \nfor one minute/ conflict. You may grant this sight to someone else, in which case \nit lasts for a turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of success allows you to extend \nthe Effect’s duration by one grade. \nSpirit Sight: You allow your material perceptions to fade into the background , \nas you extend your awareness into the spirit worlds. With these senses active, you \n1 \nsee what transpires across the Gauntlet, and you can watch the passage of spirits \nand ghosts. This sense lasts for one minutel conflict. You can grant this sense to \nsomeone else, in which case it lasts for one turn. Grades of Success: Each grade of ; \nsuccess allows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nI \nINITIKTE [BASIC) SPIRIT: \nTWCH \nSPIRIT \nThe mage can extend his natural touch and capabilities briefly into the \nspirit world. Doing so can be as simple as a shout or as complex as translocating \na hand to pickup a spiritual object or strike at a spirit. Of course, spirits can strike \nback while the mage coexists thus. \nCall Spirit: You translate your voice across the Gauntlet and into the spirit \nworld. In this fashion, you can speak to spirits or just put out a general call for \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nspirits to heed you. Although there’s no guarantee of attendance, spirits do tend \nto find people interesting, and they may flock to find out more about the unusual \nhuman who talks to them. You can use a Social Challenge to convince a spirit \nto come to you, although it may not necessarily manifest physically or come to \nyour aid. Grades of Success: No effect. \nThe Spirit’s Caress: A quick touch sends your reach through the Gauntlet \n(and the Avatar Storm) to touch the other side. You might just pat a spirit on \nthe head, or you could strike at it with all the might of your physical body. By \nthis means, you can threaten aspirit or perhaps even combat it and banish it. The \njuxtaposition of spirit and flesh lasts for one turn. Grades of Success: Each grade \nof success allows you to extend the Effect’s duration by one grade. \nDISCIPLE \n(INTEMIEDIATE) SPIRIT: \nPIERCE \nGAUNTLET \nThe Gauntlet itself ceases to be so much of a problem for the Disciple. The \nAvatar Stormremainsadanger, true, butthemagecannow interactfullywithspirits, \nawaken the spiritual properties of a place or even cross over into the Umbra itself. \nAwaken the Inanimate: Spiritual mages believe that every item has a spirit \nassociated with it. You can awaken these spirits, rousing them temporarily from \ndormancy, to empower the item or to have them answer your questions. The older \nthe item, and the more Resonance it has, the stronger the spirit is. In general, you \ncan awaken an item’s spirit and ask it one question.

Grades of Success: If the Storyteller agrees, you may awaken \nparticularly powerful spirits in old items with this rite, and they may have powers \nbeyond simply answering your queries. Such feats take many grades of success. \nStepping Sideways: By focusing on some symbolic journey, such as diving into \na pool of water or entering a dark cave, you cross the barrier from material to spirit. \nYou suffer the usual injury for the Avatar Storm, but you translocate physically from \nthe material plane to the Umbra or vice versa. Once there, you can wander about \nat will, although you must either find a natural gate or use this Effect again to leave. \nLiving creatures stand out against the spirit world. They have not belonged in such \nplaces for millennia. Once you cross, you exist physically in the other location. You \ndon’t step back at some point automatically unless you cast an Effect to do so. Grades \nof Success: Each grade allows you to bring another being with you. \n, \nADEPT \n(~TERITIEDIATE) \nSPIRIT: \nREND \nAND &PAIRGAUNTLET \nTo protect against hostile spirits, the mage can influence the Gauntlet, turning \nit into a trap to keep spirits away. The mage can alter locations to his whims in the \nUmbra, and he can build specific wards to keep out spiritual intruders. The Gauntlet \ncanberenttoallowmanypeoplepassage,ortoloosespiritsanddemonsupontheworld. \nAffix Gauntlet: You can manipulate the Gauntlet to create traps, whorls, \nstrong points and wards. If you best a spirit in a Social Challenge, you can hedge \nit out of a place, force it into a body or object, or simply trap it in once place. This \nEffect lasts for one scene/ hour.

Anyone can travel through this gate to pass between worlds \n(with the usual trouble of the Avatar Storm). You literally bring the spirit and the \nmaterial together for a short time. This gate stands open for one turn. Grades of \nSuccess: Eachgradeofsuccessallows you toextend theEffect’sdurationbyonegrade. \nThe most skilled Spirit mages can create their own spirit servants, break \nthrough the Gauntlet to worlds beyond and even design entire realms by shaping \nspirit energy to their whims. The mage can sense the Avatar and, it’s rumored, \neven destroy it. The mage’s defenses protect his spirit, even if he journeys into \nthe great beyond of the Deep Umbra or other alien places. \nBreak the Dreamshell: Far-ranging mages discover a second layer that \nkeeps mages inside the Umbral confines of the solar system. To escape to the \nDeep Umbra, the layer of chaos and uncertain primordialism, the mage must \nbreak through that layer. Doing so requires mastery of Spirit, for the mage cannot \nsurvive beyond with any skill less. Fortunately there’s no Avatar Storm to \ncontend with at the layer of the Dreamshell. You just cast this Effect when you \nreach the edge of the spirit horizon, and you cross into the spiritual deeps. Grades \nof Success: Each grade of success allows you to affect another person. \nDeep Umbra Travel: You shield yourself against the rigors of the Deeps. Most \ncreatures die out in the unformed void, but you can travel there (if you would ever \ndecide or desire to do so). This Effect protects you for one scene/ hour. Grades of \nSuccess: Eachgrade ofsuccessallows you to extend the Effect’sduration by one grade. \n~ S T E R  \n(ADVANCED) \nSPIRIT: F~RGE \nEPHE~ERA \nT~me \nThe inexorable march of time counts out the seconds, days, years and millennia \nuntil the end of the Tapestry. But does it truly ever end?& is all time just a recursion \nof histories and a group of moments with nothing more than arbitrary causality \nmaking them discrete? Mages who study Time recognize that the flow of time itself \nis mutable, and that it’s not nearly so hard and fast as people often believe. \nScience and magic alike balk at actual time travel, but limited alterations \nof such a sort seem possible occasionally. Still, the mechanics of doing so are \nmysterious and perhaps even more dangerous than spirit travel. The clever mage \nrestricts his use of Time to scrying and to the occasional boost of his reaction \nspeed. Those who actually walk the halls of time report time-policing entities, \nstrange temporal beasts, time anomalies and the like, if they return at all. \nAPPRENTICE \n(BASIC) Trme T I ~ E  \nSENSE \nThe beginning Time student can measure time with uncanny accuracy. He \ncan determine time to a second, measure the duration of other Effects and notice \ndistortions in the time-stream. \nPerfect Time: One simple casting tells you the time to the nearest second. \nThis measure reflects your subjective time with respect to the world. If you are \nin sped-up time, for instance, you know exactly how long you’ve been “gone,” \nI \nwhat the ratio of time flow is and what the equivalent time is back in the real \ntime flow. These senses last for one conflict/ minute. You may cast this sense on \nsomeone else, in which case it lasts a turn.

Although such manifesta- \ntions are rare, you can detect them with this spell if you suspect one. A \nsufficiently powerful Effect is obvious even if it's some time off. These senses last \nfor one conflict/ minute. You may cast this sense on someone else, in which case \nit lasts a turn. Grades of Success. Each grade of success allows you to extend the \nEffect's duration by one grade or to affect one other person. \nINITIATE (BASIC) T I ~ E :  \nT I ~ E  \nSIGHT \nScrying is, of course, a limited and uncertain art. Still, many mages \nhope to reap at least a limited insight into the future. With some rudimen- \ntary time magic, doing so becomes possible. The mage may send her senses \nback or forward, hoping for a glimpse of destiny. She may also muddy the \nwaters by messing randomly with the time-stream, all the better to keep \nother Time users out. \nDivinations: You gain a limited insight into the future or past. If you look \ninto the past, you should ask a Narrator or Storyteller to provide you with \ninformation about some significant past event in the area of your casting. If you \nlook into the future, you gain one free retest that you can hold for the duration \nof the story. Grades of Success: No effect. \nTime Wards: You just muck around in Time and cause difficulty for those \nwho would time-travel to you or spy on you. This Effect works just like a Ward \n(seep. 144), except that it shields against Time instead ofCowespondence. Grades \nof Success: See Ward, p. 144. \nDISCIPLE \n(INTEIUIIEDIATE) T I ~ E :  \nT I ~ E  \n~\"IPULATICBN \n! \nTime doesn't take well to manipulation, but the Disciple can pull off minor \nfeats. Perhaps the mage changes the timeline to reflect a better situation from \na friend, or just dilates and contracts time to make things speed up or slow down. \nA skilled mage can even rewind time a little, making things happen over again. \nDistort Time: You distort time around one person for a turn in a small \nlocation. The subject either gains or loses one action for the turn. Grades of \nSuccess: Each success scored allows you to affect another person. \nTime Warp: One of the more obnoxious powers, a mage can rewind time \nfor someone who's already taken a turn and cause the person to take that turn \nover again. Therefore, the direct consequences of that action didn't happen to \nthat character. Indirect matters (a wound from a different enemy, for instance) \nprobably remain. You can pick who redoes the turn. The former action is \ninvalidated and the latter used. Grades of Success: No effect. \n' AEPT ( INTER~EDIATE) \nTime: T I ~ E  \nDETEIU~IINIS~ \nNo longer limited to manipulations, the mage can stop time, slow it to a \ncrawl or change its perceived speed to a race. Objects can be held in stasis for \nlater, and so can spells. The mage simply prepares the Effect and the other spell \nin question, then the Effect triggers when the condition is met. \nContingent Effect: You set up a contingency inadvance for some condition \nthat might come to pass. When it does, it fires off another spell that you cast just \n' \n.)/ after your Contingent Effect rote. You can hold multiple spells thus, and doing \n, \nso is a good way to spend a long ritual preparing adeadly spell for later. Of course, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nif you hold too many spells, you’ll suffer severe penalties. Also note that Prime \nsenses can detect the held Effect. Grades of Success: No effect. \nProgrammed Event: You freeze time around an object. Until some event \ncomes to pass, that object remains frozen. For instance, a cup might hover in the \nair, waiting to be touched by a red-headedverbena. After that occurs, the object \nreturns to normal time. Most often, this Effect is used to preserve some Artifact \nor trap. This Effect lasts for one scene/ hour. Grades of Success: No effect. \n~€I.AST+ER(ADVANCED) \nT I ~ E :  \nTrme TRAVEL \nThe true Master steps laterally outside of time and moves along the \ntemporal axis. Such journeys can take the mage far to the future or past. These \njourneys are among the most dangerous that a mage can take, for the weight of \nParadox tends to multiply when someone affects the far past or future. \nSidestep Time: Having immunized yourself to time, you continue to act while \neveryone in 15 paces plus three paces per Arete Trait is immobilized. To you, the world \nseems frozen. Of course, you cannot physically interact with anything that’s frozen in \nnull-time.Yougainonefreeturntoactat \ntheendofyournormalturn, andnobody may \nreact to you (although you cannot injure them either). Grades of success: No effect. \nTime Travel: The penultimate expression of mystic will carries the mage \ninto the future or past. If you shunt the mage into the past, it’s largely one-way; \nyou can’t just bop into the Dark Ages and then back out in the hotel. Similarly, \nif you send a mage to the future, then it’s up to the game to catch up to that future \n(if it ever happens).

Now, how \ndoes your mage do something pretty straightforward like turn invisible, deflect \nbullets or fly? The sample rotes and Effects included here should cover many of \nthese bases, giving you a frame of reference from which to draw. If you want to \ndo something that’s not described, talk it over with your Storyteller and make \na new rote for it. These rotes are guidelines, but they offer some direction. \nNote also that some of the sample rotes here use conjunctional magic. You \ncan use those types of Effects only if your Storyteller allows them as per the \noptional rule on p. 144. Some have multiple forms for casting. If a rote can \nhappen in multiple ways (like a simple “damage enemy” rote, which could use \nForces or Entropy or any number of other Spheres), each variant is a separate rote. ; \nIn some cases, you may find other Sphere combinations to make a given rote. \nDoing so is fine as long as the Storyteller approves of them. \nAnimate the Dead: Initiate (Basic) Spirit. You call out to a minor spirit and \ncause it to inhabit a corpse and direct it. With a successful Social Challenge, you \nconvince the spirit to reanimate the corpse for a scene/ hour. The corpse is \nobviously dead, and it has no memories or personality unless you provide them ! \nthrough other Sphere Effects. Such a zombie has health levels just like an \nuninjured person, but it suffers no wound penalties. If it is reduced to Dead, the \ncorpse is too damaged to continue, and the spirit leaves. You could also use a \nSocial Challenge with a reversed rote to banish a spirit from an undead creature \nof this sort.

The attack scores two health levels of damage or inflicts one health level with \na special effect (stun, freeze, as appropriate to the element). Each element is a \nseparate rote, and it must be approved individually by the Storyteller so that its \nspecial effects are defined. If you use Master (Advanced) Forces, you may inflict an \nextra health level of damage. You must make a challenge of your Mental Traits \nagainst the target’s Physical Traits to hit.

When a mage exerts the force of magic to \nchange the world in spectacular ways, he violates the accepted nature of reality - \npeople can’treally tum invisible or change lead into gold! -and a Paradox results. \nOften, the result ranges from inconvenient side-effects to disaster. \nParadox isn’t a sentient force that’s out to get mages. Rather, it’s the \nbacklash of universal forces against the meddling and manipulation of the \nAwakened. It doesn’t play favorites or hunt mages down. It simply strikes - \noften in some form of fatigue or injury as the mage’s spell goes awry - \nwhen a \nmage tries to rewrite the Tapestry. After all, the Tapestry is so complex that no \nmortal could ever anticipate its response to manipulations completely. \nParadox most often strikes when a mage performs vulgar magic. The force of \nthe mage striving to overcome static reality causes a Backlash or warping of magic. \nWith some difficult spells, the mage might really screw up and be damned. Paradox \ncan result as the mage fails spectacularly at some enchantment. \n, \nL \nPARAD~X \nACCUITI~LATI~N \nYou gamer Paradox when you work a vulgar Effect, or when you fail an \nIfyou cast avulgar Effect, you gain one Paradox Trait for the highest Sphere level \nIf Sleepers watched your vulgar Effect, you get a n  extra Paradox Trait. Lucky you. \nIf you cast and fail an Effect that has a base difficulty of twice or more of \n* = your Arete Traits, you botch it. A botchedcoincidental Effect gains one Paradox \n2 Trait per highest Sphere level. A botched vulgar Effect, gains that amount plus \none more. A botched vulgar Effect with Sleeper witnesses gives a mage two \nParadox Traits per level of the highest Sphere plus two more on top of that. \nAs you accumulate Paradox, it may destroy your Quintessence Traits. If \nyour Paradox + Quintessence total exceeds 20 Traits, then replace Quintessence \nwith Paradox so that the total never exceeds 20. \nEffect miserably. \ninvoked. Therefore, casting a vulgar Dsciple-level Effect garners three Paradox. \nSTAVING \nQT DISASTER \nUsually, Paradox strikes immediately, causing discomfort or injury to the mage. \nHowever, you can delay this accumulation by spending a Trait of Willpower. If you \ndo so, the Paradox holds until the end of the scene or hour, whichever comes first \n: ’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n(mark it on your sheet). All Paradox you have gained in that time adds up. However, \nyou suffer the Backlash of all the accumulated Paradox at the end of that time. \nBACKLASH \nUsually when you garner Paradox, it snaps and injures you. You may become \nfatigued as a result of your spell (suffering bashing damage), or you may actually be \ninjured from a wash of uncontrolled forces. In rare cases, this damage might even kill \nthe caster. Make a Simple Test each time you gain Paradox Traits. If you win or tie, \nitbacklashes immediately. Ifyoulose, itstayswithyour Patternandsimmers.. . fornow. \nThe damage of a backlash depends on the amount of Paradox you’ve \ngarnered. Typically, a Backlash fires off all of your accumulated Paradox Traits. \nSo if you’re sitting on a lot of Paradox, you could be in trouble. If you’ve suffered \none to 10 Traits of Paradox, take half that many levels (rounded up) of bashing \ndamage (to a limit of Mortally Wounded). If you’ve suffered 11 to 20 Traits of \nParadox, subtract 10, halve (rounded up) and suffer that many levels of lethal \ndamage (again, to a limit of Mortally Wounded). If you’ve suffered 21 or more \nTraits of Paradox (what were you doing?!?), subtract 20, halve (rounded up) and \nsuffer that many levels of aggravated damage. And this time, it can kill you. \nPARADex SPIRITS \nOccasionally, a mage’s gross violation of reality draws down some sort of \noffended force. These beings manifest to punish the mage for hubris, and perhaps \nto force the mage to learn something from his errors. \n, just to make sure that people \nin new cards or change some eve \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nIf the Paradox Judge feels that it’s appropriate, a mage may suffer a visit from \na Paradox spirit. Such a spirit typically manifests in a form appropriate to the magic \nused (such as a hovering flame for Forces or an old man for Time) and wreaks havoc \nupon the unfortunate with its powers. Some can materialize physically. Others \nsimply hamper the mage’s Effects or create nuisance effects of their own. The most \ndangerous may actually kill a mage or carry her off to some distant Paradox Realm. \nThere’s no hard-and-fast rule for a Paradox spirit. In general, a Paradox \nspirit should have Traits equivalent to the mage, scaled up if the Paradox was \nlarge. For a Paradox Backlash over 10 Traits, the spirit might have twice the \nTraits of the mage. For a Paradox Backlash of 20 or more Traits, the spirit will \nprobably have quadruple the mage’s power level and be nigh-unstoppable. \nParadox spirits are typically immune to the Sphere that was used to cause the \nParadox that drew their attention. That is, if a mage botches a Forces spell horribly \nand a Paradox spirit appears, it’s probably immune to Forces. Furthermore, a \nParadox spirit cannot be summoned, commanded or banished with Spirit magic. \n@UIET \nSince mages recognize the mutable vision of reality, it’s possible for them \nto become lost in a world of their own creation. Sometimes it’s difficult to \nseparate truth from fancy or magic from the mundane. In severe cases when a \nmage’s senses are overcome, she withdraws from reality and becomes lost in her \nown magical world. Although some might mistake this state for insanity, mages \nrecognize it as the victim’s mind being overcome with the grandeur of the \nTapestry and the power of possibility. Such a state is called Quiet. \nA mage in Quiet sees or hem things that aren’t there, becomes obsessed or \nwithdrawn or otherwise suffers a shift in personality. Quiets don’t strike with any \n1 - 1 2  \nt \nP \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\npredictablereguhty.Rather, they tend toresultfiomextremelybadParadoxl3acklashes \nor magical trauma. It's up to a Storyteller to determine when a mage falls into Quiet. \nGenerally, Quiet causes some roleplaying difficulties, since the character falls into a state \nof heightened emotional disturbance in keeping with the mage's individual Resonance \nTraits. Insomecases, amage winds up inaminbpe, an internal vision that pits the mage \nagainst his fears or delusions. For such an event, the Storyteller and Avatar Guide should \nwork together to craft an appropriate side-game in advance. \nA mage struck into Quiet suffers problems based on the amount of Paradox \nenergy that backlashed and put him there. The type of Quiet depends upon the \nmage's highest Resonance Trait. High Dynamism leads to Madness, high Stasis \nleads to excessive Clarity, and high Entropy leads to Jhor. With one to three \nParadox Traits, the mage typically suffers from a minor hindrance or Negative \nTrait. As the Paradox Backlash size increases, so too does the severity of the \nproblem. All of the problems are cumulative as well. As long as the mage remains \nin Quiet, he suffers from a severe set of disorders. \nWith one to three Paradox Traits in the Quiet, the mage suffers from doubled \nNegative Traits due to Resonance. Therefore, for instance, the mage's Negative \nTrait of Clumsy that comes from his Dynamic Resonance would become Clumsy x2. \nWith four to six Paradox Traits in the Quiet, the mage suffers from a \nderangement. The mage tends to see things that aren't there, and he has trouble \nresponding to the surroundings. With too much Dynamic Resonance, this \nderangement comes as hallucinations. With too much Stasis, it is a compulsion. \nWith too much Entropy, it manifests as intense paranoia. This derangement is \nprimarily a roleplaying hindrance. Players who ignore it should be penalized \naccordingly by losing their Experience Trait for the session. \nWith seven to 10 Paradox Traits in the Quiet, the mage spawns \nrandom Hobgoblins. \nWith 11 or more Paradox Traits in the Quiet, the mage enters a mindscape. \n, \nC~PING \nWITH @UET \nBy focusing and concentrating intently, a mage can attempt to break \nthrough Quiet-induced problems. He has no guarantee of success, but the mage \nmight be able to bring his attention back to the real world with effort. \nSpend a Willpower Trait and win or tie a Simple Test. If you succeed, you \ndischarge one Trait of the Paradox, and you manage to avoid the effects of the \nQuiet for the rest of the scene or hour, whichever comes first. If this test reduces \nthe severity of your Quiet, then that reduction takes effect immediately. You \nmay be able to fight down a Quiet-induced derangement, for instance. You can \nmake this test only once per scene. \nBarring the successful use of Willpower, a Quiet reduces in severity by one Trait \nevery session. Yes, a mage could be in Quiet for a long time if he does not fight it off. \nH~BGCBBLINS \nSevere Quiets sometimes make raw, creative forces seep from the mage's \nsubconscious. As his mind wanders and sees things that aren't there, the mage's \nI \npower gives form to these hallucinations. Or are they real things that simply \nchose this time to appear? Whatever the case, the hobgoblins are very real \ni ' e '  \n12:. - \n:: -.: \nmanifestations of the mage's delusions. \n, cr'; \nI \nb \nI' \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nA mage typically manifests one hobgoblin for each Trait of Paradox that \nwent into the Quiet above six. With seven Paradox Traits blown into a Quiet, \nthe mage suffers one Hobgoblin. With eight Traits, he suffers two, and so on. \nHobgoblins should be moderated by an Avatar Guide or Paradox Judge so that \nthey reflect the mage’s inner turmoil and magical difficulties. \nHobgoblins may take the forms of people, creatures or items. Most often, they \nhave a form appropriate to the Quiet in question. For an episode of Madness, they \ncould literally be little goblins or nonsensical furniture. With Clarity, they manifest \nas machine-voices or freakish technological aberrations. With Jhor, hobgoblins \ncould be small demons, imps or perhaps weapons or implements of torture. \nA hobgoblin is very real, and it doesn’t suffer from Paradox or Unbelief. Rather, \nit’s spawned from the mage’s own magical powers. Unless a hobgoblin is patently \nparanormal, it resembles a normal thing in all ways. No simple means exists with \nwhich to tell a hobgoblin from reality, and a mage already suffering from hallucina- \ntions has avery tough time of it. Hobgoblins tend to stick around and haunt the mage \nfor an entire game session, although they can be killed or broken before then. \nAlthough no simple Traits exist for a hobgoblin, run with a few simple animals \nor items. You don’t need to get wild, and hobgoblins don’t often manifest as HUGE \nKILLER BEASTIES! More likely, a hobgoblin will run around and vex the mage or \ncause social problems, and perhaps play to some of the mage’s personal fears. \nIf a mage manages to snap out of his Quiet, hobgoblins or their remnants \nvanish like melting snow. \nIn very severe Quiets, a mage’s consciousness retreats into the shell of his \nmind to battle with Paradox and the Avatar. The mage runs through a gauntlet \nofsymbolism andsurreality in an attempt to come to grips with his state, best his \nResonance and escape to sanity once more. \nWhile in a mindscape, a mage is catatonic. With Disciple level Mind magic, \nothers can enter the mindscape to help or hinder the trapped mage. By spending \na Willpower Trait and winning or tying a Simple Test, the mage can communicate \none spoken sentence into the physical world. Otherwise, the mage is on his own. \nCraft a mindscape like you would a Seeking. Grab some Narrators and the \nAvatar Guide, then throw a few trials or puzzles at the mage. The character must \npuzzle through the bizarre scenery to reach the waking world once more. Indeed, \nthe mage might not even realize immediately that he’s in a mindscape. \nIf a mage or visitor is knocked unconscious or killed in a mindscape, the \nhapless victim lapses into a coma and awakens only at the Storyteller’s discretion. \nFortunately, when a mage fights through a mindscape, he discharges all of \nhis accumulated Paradox Traits in the process. \nAlthough a mage creates magic through will, it’s the belief in a focus that \nshapes such magic. The mage lets a focus determine her spell and give it shape. In \nturn, she believes that the focus channels her will to empower the magic. \nAlthough a focus isn’t really necessary to work magic, most mages only understand \ntheir magics in terms of the foci that they use - \nat least until they master their \nmagic and become enlightened enough to recognize the power of will over reality. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nWhen you shape an Effect, your mage generally needs to use a focus. Doing \nso takes the form of chanting, brandishing an object of power, mixing a \nsubstance and applying it, manipulating energy through song and dance or \nwhatever else the mage believes is necessary to work magic. In game terms, you’ll \nuse various trappings and Abilities to work your spells. \nEach Tradition description lists various foci that are appropriate. A mage uses \nthese foci to direct magic. For instance, a Hermetic mage may chant in Enochian, \ninscribeacomplexgeometricformorcalluponangelicinterventioninordertoconjure \nflames.AVerbenacou1ddothesamewithapaean \ntoancient gods, anofferingofblood \nto the elements or howling a song that sparks fiery energies. A Virtual Adept might use \na computer to manipulate local electrical fields or generate a laser for the same effect. \nYou can use any focus from your Tradition to shape an Effect. You need to \nnarrate the use of that focus, explaining what you’re doing and how it causes the \nmagic to happen. You’ll probably want to brush up on a little theory just to make it \nconvincing. Read some books on computer science if you’re playing aVirtual Adept, \ncheckout some philosophy and religion for Celestialchoristers andso on. Ofcourse, \nyou should never actually act out a dangerous behavior or brandish something like \na weapon. Merely describe what you are doing in such a case. However, if you can \nroleplay the use of a focus (by actually singing, for instance, or making complex \ngestures with an item card), then you should do so as long as you won’t draw negative \nattention from people who aren’t playing. (No sense convincing onlookers that \nyou’re engaged in some sort of realeworld occult conspiracy.) \nNotealsothatusingafocus isn’tjustaroleplayingtoolorahindrance. It canreally \nboost your capabilities with magic. See “Abilities Enhancing Magic,” on p. 135. \nUNICBUE \nAND SPECIALTY \nFKI \nYou have a specialty focus for each Sphere, a focus with which you’re \nparticularly good. If you can find a way to work that focus into the magic, then \nyou get a one-Trait bonus on your Arete Trait total for the resolution of such \nchallenges. For instance, if your Hermetic mage uses Enochian chants to \nsummon Forces magic, then you get a one-Trait bonus any time you chant when \ncasting a Forces spell. You could still inscribe a sigil with your staff (say, if you \nwere rendered mute), but you wouldn’t get the bonus, simply because your mage \nisn’t as good with that combination of Sphere and focus. \nInsomecases, you’llhaveaunique focus. Youcan decide, for instance, that youdon’t \njustperform your AkashicSp~tmagicwithyoursword, butspecificallywiththeChlnese \nbroadsword you inherited from your grandfather. When using a unique focus, you gain \naone-Traitadditionalbonusonresolvingyourmagicalcasting. However, ifyouever lose , \nthe focus, you’re in trouble. You can’t use that Sphere at all without the unique focus \nunless you manage to either surpass it, gain enough Arete to no longer need it or gam a \n1 - \nnew focus to replace it (at a cost of one Experience Trait per level in the Sphere). \nSURPASSING \nA FKUS \nYoucanperformmagicwithoutafocus, but it’sverydifficult todoso. Yourmage \nconcentrates on the desired Effect, then channels his will withal1 ofhis might. If he’s \nlucky, he may succeed in performing magic without the use of the focus. \nYou must spend a Willpower Trait immediately. When you do, you make your \nusual magical test, but youdo so at a three-Trait difficulty penalty for Arete purposes, \nso you’re much more likely to fail. However, this system allows you to perform magic \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nif you are somehow prevented from using any focus (if you’re mentally projecting, \nor if you are bound and gagged without any possessions, for instance). \nABAND~NING \nFKI \nEventually, with time and great enlightenment, you overcome the need \nfor foci. You realize that it’s your will, not the objects that you use, that causes \nreality to change. \nWhen you achieve a total of six Arete Traits, you may abandon all use of foci \nfor two of your Spheres. In those Spheres, you can perform magic without any tools \nor practices. You simply concentrate for a tum on the desired Effect, and you make \na test normally without any focus-related penalties. If you decide to go ahead and \nuse a focus anyway, you gain a one-Trait resolution bonus on the test. \nEach time you gain another Arete Trait over six, you abandon foci for two \nmore Spheres. \nSAmPLE IFKI \nOf course, the following list isn’t all-inclusive.

Yet rules are necessary only to govern the outcome of aconfrontation \nwhen one does occur. Still, the primary focus of this game is to tell a good story, \nand the rules facilitate that focus. Rules just give you a framework to make sure \nthat everyone is treated fairly. They're not ironclad dogma, they're just ideas to \nhelp you run a smoother, more entertaining game. \nCHALLENGES \nFrom time to time, two or more players will engage in a conflict that cannot \nbe resolved through roleplaying alone. This sort of face-off is called a challenge, \nand it requires a simple system of conflict resolution. The system detailed in this \nchapter allows for the resolution of such conflicts efficiently and quickly. Inmost \ncases, a Narrator does not even need to be present when a challenge is played. \nRoleplaying does not necessarily have to end when a challenge begins. In fact, \nroleplaying becomes more important than ever if players intend to enjoy a \nconfrontation and avoid out-of-game disputes. Experienced players can integrate \na challenge into their roleplaying so seamlessly that outsiders don't even know that \nanything unusual is going on. At the players' option, they can use special hand \nsignals to indicate when certain Traits and powers are being employed. \nIn order for this system to work, players need to work together. They have \nto educate each other on the rules and agree on what Traits can be used in a \nchallenge. Compromise and cooperation are the bywords of this game. Argu- \nments over whether or not a particular Trait is appropriate to bid wreck both the \nmomentum and the mood of the game. \nUSING TRAITS \nBefore you can begin to learn how challenges work, you must first under- \nstand what defines a character's capabilities. Each character is created with a \nnumber of adjectives that describe and define that person as an individual. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThese adjectives are called Traits, and they are described fully in Chapter Three. \nPlayers use these Traits to declare challenges against other characters or against \nstatic forces represented by a Narrator. \nINITIAL BID \nA challenge begins with a player bidding one of her Traits against her \nopponent. At the same time, she must declare what the conditions of the \nchallenge are, such as firing a gun, attacking with a knife or diving for cover. The \nother player must then decide how her character will respond. She can either \nrelent immediately or bid one of her own Traits in defense. \nWhen players bid Traits against one another, they may use only those Traits \nthat could sensibly be applied to that situation. Essentially, a player should \nusually use only those Traits from the same category her opponent’s used. Most \nchallenges are categorized as Physical Challenges, Social Challenges or Mental \nChallenges, as per the Attribute categories, and all Traits used in a challenge \nmust come from the same category. Experienced players may offer each other \nmore creative leeway, but only by mutual agreement. \nIf the defender relents, she loses the challenge automatically. For example, \nif she were being attacked, she would suffer a wound. If she bids a Trait in defense, \nthe two players perform a test. Those Traits the players bid are put at risk, as the \nloser of the test loses not only the challenge but the Trait she bid as well. \nTESTING \nOnce both parties involved in a challenge have bid a Trait, they engage in \na test immediately. The test itself is not what you may think - \nthe outcome is \nrandom, but the players use no cards or dice. The two players face off against one \nanother by playing Rock-Paper-Scissors. The test works like the moment in \npoker when you turn over your cards and declare a winner. The test produces one \nof two possible outcomes - \neither one player is the victor, or the result is a tie. \nIf you lose the test, you lose the Trait you bid for the duration of the game \nsession. Essentially, you have become tired or lost some confidence in the \ncapability the Trait represented, and you can’t call on it effectively until you \nregain some confidence and energy. \nIn the case of a tie, the players must then reveal the number of Traits that they \ncurrently have available in the Attribute category from which they bid the challenge \nTrait. The player with the least number of Traits loses the test and loses the challenge. \nNote that the number of Traits you’ve lost in previous challenges, or lost for any other \nreason,reducesthemaximumnumberofTraitsyoucanclaimin ties.Youmay lie about \nthe number of Traits you possess, but only by declaring fewer Traits than you actually \nhave. Bluffing in this way allows you to keep the actual number of Traits you possess \na secret, but doing so may be risky. The challenger is always the first to declare his \nnumber of Traits. If both players declare the same number of Traits, then the challenge \nis a draw, and the defender wins. However, both players lose the Traits they bid. \nExample of Play: Jaedo and his cabal mate Jeremy are locked in a battle of wits, \nand it’slaedo’s turn to try to stumpJeremy with a riddle. Jaedo begins by declaring his \nTrait (“I am quite Observant, and I draw this riddle from the smallest hints of the \nnatural world.”). Jeremy simply smiles and responds with declaration (“Bring it on. \nI’m much more Clever than you think I am!”). The two players test, and both shoot \nPaper. They must now compare Traits to see who wins. Not wanting to lose face in \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nions of a challenge, you \ndoes not include trials that a character fails but then redeems through retests or \noverbids. Retests and overbids occur before the five-minute time limit starts. \n1 \nA challenge can become more complicated in a number of ways. The \nNEGATIVE TRAITS \na player can call out a Negative Trait that he believes his opponent possesses. \nIf the player does indeed possess that Negative Trait, he must bid an additional \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nIf you figure out more of your opponent’s Negative Traits in a challenge \nthan he has regular Traits to cover them, then he loses the challenge automati- \ncally. The same works in reverse, however, if you do not have additional Traits \nremaining to match incorrect Negative Trait guesses. \nExample of Play: Blink is attempting to convince Leigh, a wary Verbena \nInitiate, to join her on a potentially dangerous reconnaissance mission. The clever \nHollower begins by appealing to some common ties (“I’ve been nothing but Friendly \nto yousofar, so why don’t youreturn thefavorthisonce?”). Leighstillisn’tquitereudy \nto go along yet ( “I’m too Commanding to be given orders so easily. ”) . Needing some \nextra leverage, Blink ups the ante by suggesting that Leigh has the Negative Trait \nCallous (“What, are you so Callous that you’ll ignore a genuine call for help like \nthis?”). If Leigh did indeed possess that Negative Trait, she would have to nsk an \nadditional Social Trait to continue the challenge. However, luck isn’t on Blink’s side, \nand Leigh doesn’t have that Negative Trait. Having underestimated her ally’s \ncapabilities, Blink will now have to add a Trait to her bid to continue the challenge. \nIt can be risky to bidNegative Traits, but if you’re sure about what you’re doing, \nyou can raise the stakes for your opponent considerably. You can even raise them to \nthe point where your opponent relents rather than risking additional Traits. \n@VE:RBIDDING \nOverbidding is the system by which powerful characters may prevail in a \nchallenge, even if they lose the initial test. Justin the Master with 12 Mental \nTraits should be able to crush Sam the Initiate who has only three. This system \nis designed to make that possible. \nOnce a test has been made, the loser has the option of calling for an overbid. \nIn order to call an overbid, you must risk a new Trait, though, since the original one \nhas already been lost. At this point, the two players must reveal the number of \napplicableTraitsthey possess in the appropriate Attribute category, starting with the \nplayer who called for the overbid. If that player has double the number of Traits as \nhis opponent in that category, he may attempt another test. (The person who won \nthe original challenge and is now being overbid against does not have to risk another \nTrait.) As in a tie, either player may state a number of Traits less than the actual \nnumber he has in order to keep his true power secret. Overbidding can be dangerous, \nthough, unless you are confident in your estimation of your opponent’s abilities. \nExample of Play: Stefan DeChase is trying to fast-talk Randal, a reluctant aly , \ninto following the course of action he’s suggesting. The unlikely Chorister begins with a \nclassic rapid-fire barrage (“My words are so fast and Beguiling you have no choice but \nletmego.”). However, Randalisn’tbuyingintoit (‘TmtooDignified toletafewquick \nphrasessway me like that”). They test, andstefanloses. However, reckoning he hasmore \nsocial aptitude than his scholarly fiend, Stefan declares an overbid (“I’m so Witty, you ; \ndon’tknow whathit you!”). He thenannouncesal IOofhisSocialTraits. Randaladmits c \nthat he has only four, so they test again. Stefan wins this time, and he wins the overall \nchallenge, even though he still loses the original Trait he bid. Now a slightly befuddled \nRandall is beginning to see the wisdom of following his fiend’s words after all. \nI \nSTATIC \nCHALLENGES \nSometimes, you have to undergo challenges against a Narrator rather than \nagainst another player. For example, a scholar may use a Static Mental Chal- \nlenge with the Occult Ability to dig up an obscure bit of lore in a vast library. In \nI :’ib , \nt \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsuch circumstances, you bid a Trait that would be appropriate to the challenge, \nthen perform a test against the Narrator. Before the test, the Narrator decides \non the difficulty of the task that you are attempting. This number determines \nhow many Traits you are bidding against in the event of a tie. The test proceeds \nexactly as it would if you were testing against another character. Of course, you \nmay attempt to overbid in a Static Challenge, but beware, because the Narrator \ncan overbid as well. The number of Traits attached to the challenge should \nrepresent the difficulty and danger inherent in the challenge. \nSometimes Narrators may leave notes on objects, such as books, doors or \nmagical items that indicate the type of challenges that must be won to achieve \naspecificeffect with that object (suchasdecipheringa tome or hot-wiringacar). \nSimple Tests determine whether you can do something successfully when you \nface no real opposition. Simple Tests are often used when casting rotes or other Effects. \nMost Simple Tests do not require you to risk or bid Traits, although some may. \nWhen a Simple Test is called for, you simply play Rock-Paper-Scissors \nagainst a Narrator. In most cases, the player succeeds if he wins or ties. In some \ncases, though, it may be necessary for the player to win in order to receive any \nbenefit from the challenge. \nS I ~ P L E  \nTESTS \nRETESTS \nCertain Traits allow a character toretest a challenge he has failed. A retest allows \na character to ignore the results of the first test and test again for a new result. Players \nusually gain retests through Abilities, but other Traits may also provide them as well. \nGenerally, expending one level of an appropriate Ability allows for one retest. \nMultiple retests are possible on a single challenge, but each retest must \ncome from a different source. A character who is trying to hit someone with a \nsword may retest his Physical Challenge once using a level of Melee. However, \nhe may not gain multiple retests with the Melee Ability on the same challenge, \neven if he has multiple levels on the Ability. \nA character who is capable of matching the conditions of the retest may \ncancel an opponent’s retest. If a player uses Brawl to retest a failed Physical \nChallenge to punch his foe, his foe may expend a level of Dodge to block the \nretest and force the attacker to accept the results of the original test. \nExample of Play: Jean Gris is attempting to subdue Brother Grizzly, a \nDreamspeaker ally who is possessed by a terrifying spirit. Jean first tries to gain some \ntime (“I knock your legs out from under you with a Dexterous sweep”). In response, \n8 a the spirit riding the other mge causes him to simply strike out (“I crush your leg with \n,” a Brutal stomp”). They test, and Jean loses. However, the Euthanatos is an \naccomplished fighter, so he calls fur a retest (“I am too skilled at Brawl to lose so \neasily!”). They test again, and Jean wins. Brother Grizzly topples to the ground, \nbuying the Euthanatos a few extra seconds to decide on a new tactic. \nLater on, Jean Gris confronts his mentor Harlequin about the e&r mge’s \ninvolvement in a series ofsuspicious deaths. Wurds come to blows before long, andJean \nattacks withadagger(“WithasCnkeasQuickaslightning, \nIcutyouwithmy knife!”). \nHarlequinchooses tosimplyget out ofthe way (“WithoneLithe motionIsidestep your \nclumsy attack”). They test, andJean loses. He attempts to retest immediately (“All \nthese years of Melee training have given me more skill than that!”). However, \nf \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nultiple challenges can occur simultaneously during any given fight \noccasionally needs some means of determining who acts first and \nThis rule can occasionally cause as much confusio \nve, and the Narrator may choose to apply it only when th \nother critical need to establish who’s going first. \nHarlequin blocks the retest with Dodge ( “Ha! You’re still too slow. I can Dodge strikes \nlike that in my sleep!”). Since Harlequin blocked the retest, the results of the original \ntest stand. So far, Jean has lost one Quick Attribute Trait and one Melee Trait, \nWhereasHarlequinhas usedonly oneDodge Trait.]eanisnowoff-balance andaneasy \ntarget for his teacher’s counterattack. \nRELENTING \nA player may choose to acquiesce and admit defeat in a challenge at any \ntime before he performs the actual test. Characters who relent lose the challenge \nautomatically, but they do not lose any Traits, even if they bid one before \nrelenting. They also help the game flow along more smoothly than extended \nRock-Paper-Scissors matches do. Thank them for being so conscientious. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nBQNUS TRAITS \nCertain weapons and special powers grant a character bonus Traits during \na challenge. You may add these extra Traits to a character’s total when resolving \na tie or overbid involving that weapon or special Ability. \n@RRR a= \nCHALLENGES \nTypically, all challenges activate simultaneously in a turn. If you absolutely \nmust have anorder ofprecedence, have aNarratorpickone character at random and \nthen proceed clockwise around the group, arbitrating each successive challenge. \nTHE \n~ C B B  \nSCENE \nIt’s a fact of life that a large group of characters will decide to mix it up sooner \nor later. Group challenges can seem intimidating even to experiencedNarrators and \nStorytellers. These rules are designed to streamline the resolution process, rather \nthan letting the situation devolve into endless matches of Rock-Paper-Scissors. \nFirst of all, find out who is challenging whom. The easiest way to do so is \nto count to three and have everyone point to the person they wish to target that \nturn. If no one is being challenged by more than one person, then let the \nchallenges proceed normally. \nIf several characters challenge one target, or one character tries to challenge \nmultiple opponents at once, resolve it in the following manner. First deal with \ngroups in the order of largest to smallest, just for ease of play. Each attacker must \nbid an appropriate Trait as normal for the challenge. Logistics put a limit of up \nto five characters attacking another character at once. \nNext, the lone character must bid enough Traits to counter every opponent \nin the group. If he does not have enough Traits, he must relent to those \nopponents whose bids he cannot meet. (He may choose which opponents he \nrelents to, though.) Resolve those relented challenges first, because the defender \nmay succumb before the rest of the group can act. \nAfter the bidding and relenting phase, the defender and his attackers engage in \none simultaneous test. The defender compares his sign to each of the attacker’s signs \nand applies the appropriate results. If the defending character throws Scissors and his \nfour attackers throw Rock, Scissors, Paper and Paper, the defender loses to the first \nchallenger, ties with the second (which he will resolve like any other tie) and beats the \nlast two. The defenders and attackers lose any Traits they have bid in a lost test. If the \ndefender in the previous example had bid one Trait against every attacker, he would \nhave lostoneTrait tothefirst attacker, andanadditionalTraitifhelostthe tieaswell. \nOnce the tests have been made, you resolve them in the standard order of \nactions and initiative. However, unless the defender has a special power that \nallows him to take multiple actions, he may attempt to injure only one of his \nattackers, and it must be one who lost a challenge against him. If none of the \nattackers lose, the defender simply suffers the results of their actions. It is possible \nfor a defender to lose Traits to the first attackers and then lose a tie to an attacker \nlater in the same mob challenge because of those Traits he lost. \nWhen the defender in a mob challenge uses Abilities or other powers to gain \nretests, treat each attacker’s challenge as a separate test. Therefore, a defender \nwould need to spend five Melee Traits in order to retest against five attackers in \none melee combat challenge. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTIl-€IE \nTime in Mind’s Eye Theatre works as it does in real life. It moves forward \ninexorably. For the most part, every action plays out in real time, and players are \nexpected to stay in character unless they have a rules question. \nA player should never drop character when interacting with other players. \nDoing so ruins the atmosphere for everyone involved. Players may talk through \nchallenges, but a character is always considered to be active in the game. If a \nplayer needs to take a break, he should inform a Narrator. That player should not \ninteract with any of the other players while he is out of character. \nThe only other exception to this in&aracter rule is when a Narrator calls for a \ntimeout. This call may be necessary to resolve a dispute or change the scene if the story \ncalls for it. When a Narrator calls “Timeout!”, all players within hearing distance must \nstop whatever they are doing until the Narrator calls out, “Resume’1 or “Game on!” \nTimeoutsshouldbekepttoaminimum,though,sincetheyintermpttheflowofthestory. \nMind’s Eye Theatre time breaks down into five major allotments: chronicles, \nstories, sessions, scenes and turns. A chronicle is a series of smaller stories that are \nall connected somehow, and which may take months or even years to complete. \nEach complete plot line within the chronicle is called a story. A session is one \nactual night ofplay, although Storytellers may define a session as one night of game \ntime if the action ends in media res at the end of the previous game. (Since many \ncharacters regain spent Traits between sessions, this distinction can be impor- \ntant.) Finally, a scene is the time it takes to resolve the action in one location. \nOnce the characters shift locations, the scene has ended. If a session will be taking \nplace entirely at one location, a scene can then be defined as roughly one hour. \nIn many cases, a scene breaks down into a series of smaller actions that all \nhappen in a given location within a short span of time. If you’re fighting several \ngroups of Nephandic minions in the local abandoned lot at midnight, that’s all one \nscene. However, you’re taking up a little time as you defeat each group and charge \nthe next. There is not time enough to represent a change of scene, even though the \naction usually takes several turns. Just fighting a single minion can take adozen turns \nin itself. One series of challenges against a single opposing force comprises a conflict. \nIn roleplaying time, a conflict equals roughly a minute. Therefore, if you \nspend several challenges besting a foe, hacking a computer system or crawling \nthrough an air duct, that’s one conflict. The conflict really exists as an arbitrary \ntime measure for some powers. If a power lasts for a conflict, it remains in effect \nfor the series of contiguous challenges against an opposing group or obstacle, and \nit ends as soon as the challenges end. \n(Note that you can’t just wait in reserve during an ongoing conflict as your fnend \ngets beaten down, only to jump in one turn later, claiming that it’s a new conflict and \n$1 \nthat the enemy’s powers have all expired. The opponent hasn’t moved, and your arrival \nhas put only a small pause in the action. You’re still engaged in the same conflict.) \nCHRCBNICLES, \nSTBRIES, \nSESSIBNS \nAND SCENES \nI * \nCCBNf LICTS \nTURNS \nTurns are the discrete blocks of time, that make up conflicts and scenes. Turns \nlast approximately three seconds, but this measure may vary from challenge to \na \nit’.’ \n1,“. *’ I \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nchallenge at the Storyteller’s discretion. In any given turn, a character may take \none action, and some actions, such as bypassing a complicated security system, may \neven take multiple turns to complete. Other actions, like speaking a short \nsentence, do not use up a character’s turn at all. Once everyone involved in a turn \nhas taken an action, the turn ends and another turn begins. \nIn some instances, a character may be interrupted before he can take his action or \nbe forced to respond to events developing around him. A character may always defend \nhimself in such circumstances, but doing so uses up his available action for the turn. \nIf a power affects a character for 15 seconds, it is assumed to be in effect for \nfour turns when turn-based time is in effect. In normal roleplaying conditions, \nsuch powers work for their allotted amount of time. \nDCBWNTIITE \nMany aspects of a character’s life are critical to her continued existence, yet \nthey either do not make for dramatic roleplaying or they are too intricate to \nperform during game sessions. Storytellers are encouraged to use downtime \nbetween sessions to allow characters to maintain theirholdings, learnnew Spheres \nand see to other mundane facets of their existence. Other actions and interactions \nbetween characters may take place during this time as well, but only with \nStoryteller supervision. As long as players don’t use abuse downtime privileges, the \ntime between sessions can be a rewarding roleplaying experience in itself. \nHWLTH \nA character in a Laws of Ascension game has different health levels that \nrepresent the amount of injury the character can endure. These levels include: \nHealthy, Healthy, Bruised, Bruised, Bruised, Wounded, Mounded, Incapaci- \ntated and Mortally Wounded. If a Healthy character loses two health levels from \na combat challenge, he becomes Bruised. If he loses three more health levels, he \nbecomes Wounded, and so on. \nNote: Wound penalties do not affect any tests involving Arete or casting \nEffects, until the mage becomes Incapacitated. A wizard’s will is all he needs to \n8 make magic, after all, and his will doesn’t depend on the flesh for support. Mages \nwho are Incapacitated or Mortally Wounded may attempt to use magic if they’re \nconscious, but they can usually enact only those Effects that deal with healing \ntheir wounds and/ or escaping the battlefield. \nHealthy - \nWhen a character is Healthy, he is virtually or completely \n~ \nuninjured. Hesuffersnopenaltyasidefrompossiblybeingcosmeticallyscuffedupabit. \nBruised -A Bruised character is more seriously roughed up, and his injuries \nhave started to impair his viability a bit. He is considered one Trait down on all bids, \nso the player must risk an additional Trait to have a chance in any challenge. \nWounded- When a character is Wounded, he is seriously injured in one \nor more parts of his body. To reflect this injury, he must risk an additional Trait \nto attempt a challenge (because of the Bruised health level of damage), and his \nI opponent wins all ties, regardless of who has more Traits. If the injured character \nhas a power that normally allows him to win all ties, he resolves ties through \ncomparing Traits instead. Note: a character may always attempt to overbid. \nIncapacitated -An Incapacitated character is completely out of play for at \nleast 10 minutes. Even once he regains consciousness, the character is still effectively \nimmobile, although he may now whisper pained sentences. He may not enter into \n1 \na \nI ’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nchallenges, and he is essentially at the mercy of other characters until he heals at least \none health level. Characters hit with bashing damage at this point are rendered \nunconscious for one scene or hour, whichever comes first. They’re out cold, but \nthey’re not in any serious danger except from prolonged bashing attacks. Characters \nwho are hit with lethal or aggravated damage, however, drop to Mortally Wounded. \nSuch injuries are more than capable of finishing them off for good. \nMortally Wounded- A Mortally Wounded individual has little time left. He \ndoes not regain consciousnessnormally, and he loses a Physical Trait every 10 minutes. \nAs m n  as the character runs out of Physical Traits, he dies. Only the assistance of \nsomeone with the right magic or the Medmne Ability can halt this loss, and the \ncharacter will not even begin to heal unless he is treated by magic or taken to a hospital. \nThose who fail to improve or stabilize in time undergo the complete and permanent \ncessation of all metablic activity that’s conventionally known as death. \nExampleofP1ay:It‘sjustnotAugusta’sluckyday. \nThewmmcustoshbeencaught \nin two vicious fights whik en route to rescuing his mage allies.

Furthermore, they are as susceptible to infections and \ndiseases as anyone else, and they must tend their wounds carefully to avoid such \ncomp1ications.ThisriskmaynotbemuchofathreatforSonsofEtherwithextensive \nhospital facilities, but a Hollow One without insurance or IDmay have serious cause \nto worry about the nasty cut she got in that back alley brawl. See Laws of the Hunt \nfor complete rules regarding infections and diseases. As aquickrule, minor infections \nare coincidental and not especially difficult to heal, while more severe infections \nhave a corresponding rise in difficulty. It can even be vulgar to heal serious diseases. \nSome types of damage are more dangerous than others. A punch to the jaw is \nless likely to kill than a knife wound. Bashing damage is any injury that is painful but \nwhich fades relatively quickly, such as that taken from kicks, punches or tackles. \nLethal damage (which comes from bullets, swords, knives, etc.) is intended to kill, \nand it takes mortals and mages alike a long time to heal. The Narrator is the final \narbiter of what counts as bashing or lethal damage. A single person kicking someone \nusually does bashing damage, but a helpless character being stomped on by a gang \nof attackers might well start taking lethal damage to reflect the savage nature of the \nbeating. Bashing damage doesn’t usually reduce a character below Incapacitated \nwithout effort, so it is typically lesslikely to be fatal. However, lethaldamage candrop \na character to Mortally Wounded in a hurry. A character who’s reached the \nIncapacitated health level with bashing damage subsequently takes lethal damage \nfrom further bashing attacks. The bashing damage converts to lethal damage, and \nBASHINGAETHAL \nDA~I-IAGE \n.’ - ’ * \n.I L .  ’ @’ \n, Tr‘; \n1 \nit may eventually mortally wound or kill the character. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nBashing wounds heal fairly quickly, and they are often coincidental to heal \nif the character is clever enough. (\"I think she bruisedmy jaw, but I'll live.\") Lethal \nwounds take longer to heal, and they may either be coincidental or vulgar to heal, \ndepending on the type of injury and the circumstances around it. For example, \npeople may accept that an herbal poultice applied speedily, might stop bleeding \nor help deaden pain in the case of something like a knife wound, but they are \nunlikely to believe in the same cure if the character has beenshot. Likewise, amore \ntechnologically inclinedwizard might be able to sway a modem crowd with a quick \nstory about adrenaline shots and cutting-edge anti-coagulants, but he would be out \nof luck in a peasant village where society doesn't recognize such technology. \nAs a rule of thumb, however, it is coincidental to heal bashing damage, and \nit is coincidental to heal lethal damage if you do so out of sight of Sleepers. It is \nusually vulgar to heal lethal damage in front of them. If a character cannot or will \nnot use magic to treat her injuries, she heals according to the following chart. \nNatural healing is a slow process, and it assumes that the character is getting \nplenty of bed rest and maintaining a low level of activity. \nAGGRAVATED \nWCBUNDS \n2 \nWounds that go beyond the normal bounds of even most magical healing \n-$ powers are called aggravated wounds. Such wounds are caused by injury from \nfire, magical weapons, vulgar magic Effects - \nespecially those charged with \n4 \nQuintessence - \nor from the teeth and claws of a supernatural creature. A \nNarrator can also deem any other sufficiently severe injury to be aggravated, \ndepending on the circumstances. It is always vulgar to heal aggravated damage, \nno matter what. If a characters leaves his wounds to heal normally (that is, with \ntime and bed rest), those wounds heal at the same rate as lethal damage. \nAggravated wounds reflect injuries so deep they have scarred an individual's \n* very Pattern, so an equally dramatic (i.e., vulgar) use of magic is required if one \nwants to set them right in a hurry. Even on their own, aggravated wounds take \n\\ 1 , \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nquite a while to heal, as the Pattern rights itself once more. In either case, the \nmage must spend one Quintessence Trait per health level of damage in order to \nenergize his Pattern enough to make such a change. Otherwise it is too sluggish \nto flow back into place on its own. \nFire \nIn game terms, all wounds inflicted by normal or magical fires do aggravated \ndamage to mages. The player of a character who is on fire must winor tie aSimple \nTest and spend one action dousing the flames. This test reflects the “Stop-Drop- \nRoll” method of extinguishing flames. Other actions are possible, of course, \nsubject to the player’s cleverness and/ or use of the appropriate Spheres. \nEssentially, combat involves two characters engaging in physical conflict. The \nplayers agree what the outcome of the challenge will be, each player bids an appropriate \nTrait, and they perform a test to determine the victor. The following section allows for \nvariations on those basic rules, such as situations using surprise or weapons. \nThe agreed-upon outcome of a Physical Challenge is often that the loser \ngets injured, but this result is not the only possible one. The two partiescan agree \nto nearly anything, whether it’s wrestling an opponent to the ground or tossing \nhim into traffic. The results of a combat challenge may also be different for both \nparticipants. For example, if a mage is battling a possessed friend, the wizard \nmight simply try to subdue him instead of hurting him, while the attacker might \nseek to do some serious bodily harm. \nSURPRISE \nIf a player does not respond within three seconds of the declaration of a \nPhysical Challenge, the character is considered to have been surprised. Sometimes \na player is busy with another activity or is playing a character who just isn’t \nprepared for the attack. However, any player who sneaks around whispering \nchallenges to get the element of surprise is cheating, plain and simple. A \nStoryteller canalso declare asufficiently clever ambush to be asurprise. If you can’t \nsee the enemy coming, she may well get in a good shot at you before you notice. \nIn a surprise-attack situation, the surprised character does not get achance to \ncounterattackhis challenger on the first combat challenge. For instance, ifa player \ndoes not respond in time to an attack, but he still wins the challenge, the best he \ncan do is escape injury. Furthermore, if the challenger loses the test to attack her \nsurprisedvictim, she may call for asecondchallenge byriskinganother Trait. After \nthis second challenge, regular challenge rules resume. Overbidding is permitted \nfor both challenger and challenged in surprise situations. \nm@VEmENT IN C@mBAT \nThree-Step Rule \nAnyone who has just entered combat or who is already involved in combat \nis subject to the three-step rule. In any combat turn, a character may take up to \nthree steps and still attack. Moving one step is considered walking cautiously. \nTaking two steps is considered moving directly, and the character is down one \nTrait in Physical Challenges. Taking three steps in a turn is considered running, \nand the character is also down aTrait in Physical Challenges. AnEffect that allows \nfor an additional action would allow you to take three additional steps in a turn. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nFair Escape is a simple rule that allows players to escape from potentially \ndangerous in-game situations without actually bounding over furniture or diving \nout of windows. This rule also allows players to avoid combat without going \nthrough cumbersome challenges to see if they can get away. \nWhen you use this rule, you can call “Fair Escape!” any time you notice the \napproach of another player with whom you do not wish to interact. Once you \ncall for a Fair Escape, you may leave the area without being pursued. There are \nseveral guidelines that must be followed when using this rule, however: \nYou may not use the Fair Escape rule if the person approaching is within \nconversational distance. In such cases, you must initiate a challenge in order to \nflee. Use common sense in places where a great deal of ambient noise reduces one’s \nconversational distance. \nSituations that involve ranged weapons or an ambush in which all exits \nhave been blocked or the target is surrounded can negate the use of Fair Escape. \nAgain, use common sense. \nA character using invisibility or Effects with similar results may employ a Fair \nEscape at any time before a challenge has been initiated, unless someone with some \nform of magical perception spots him. (Note: Many Apprentice Sphere Effects are \ncapable of granting magical perception. However, the mage cannot simply cycle \nthrough all of his Apprentice-level Sphere Effects in order to detect an invisible foe. \nIf a character gives him the slip in one challenge, he remains fooled for the nonce.) \nCharacters with supernatural speed - \nsuch as that which is granted by the \nTime Sphere -may \ngain a Fair Escape by activating their speed before a challenge \nis initiated. If two characters use supernatural speed, whoever uses the highest level \n‘ of supernatural speed wins, and all ties go to the fleeing party. Therefore, a character \nwith only a Disciple’s grasp of the Time Sphere who uses an Effect to increase his \nspeed cannot get away from a vampiric foe who uses Advanced Ceknty. \nThese rules should hasten play, not complicate it. Always try to employ \nFor obvious reasons, no real weapons are ever allowed in Mind’s Eye Theatre \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n. \nSome weapons have Negative Traits that the wielder’s opponent can use in \nprecisely the same way as he would use the wielder’s regular Negative Traits. The \nweapon’s Negative Traits can only be used against the wielder of that weapon. \nNegative Traits for a weapon must be appropriate to the situation. For instance, if \nyou are firing a pistol and your opponent wants to use the gun’s Negative Trait Loud \nagainst you, you can ignore that Negative Trait if you have a silencer on the gun. \nConcealability \nEach weapon has a concealability rating. If you do not have the proper \namount of clothing or cover to conceal that weapon, you must have that card on \ndisplay at all times. You cannot, for example, pull a broadsword out of your pocket. \nInstead, you must carry that card openly at all times. Optionally, you could pin the \ncard to your shirt, indicating that the sword is slung over your shoulder. \nAvailability \nSerious firearms and archaic melee weapons can take some time to locate. \nObtain firearms also requires a permit, which involves undergoing background \nchecks or waiting-periods in some areas. A character can turn to less reputable \nchannels to find equipment, but doing so often means engaging in shady deals \nand paying vastly inflated prices. Weapons that have Influence values listed \nunder Availability indicate the level and type of Influence required in order to \nprocure the weapon through illicit channels. Of course, a character must also \nhave some level of the Finance Ability, the Resources Background or a money- \nraising Influence to procure exotic melee weapons and nearly all firearms. \nEven though a character can get a weapon, however, he won’t necessarily \nbe able to keep it forever. If characters run around firing shotguns and large \nautomatic weapons recklessly, they’ll face intensive police manhunts that are \ncarried out with extreme prejudice. Take care to make sure that characters with \npowerful weapons understand the equally powerful repercussions that come \nfrom using them. These consequences not only preserve game balance, but they \nenforce a sense of realism and keep the game from turning into an arms race. \n-, \nSPECIAL \nW W ~ N  \nCAPABILITIES \nSome weapons have special abilities that allow an attacker to inflict extra \ndamage, ignore certain types ofprotection or strike multiple opponents at once. \nThe following is a list of those capabilities. \nArmor-Piercing \nAlthough they do not inflict extra damage, armor-piercing rounds ignore \nany defenses armor might provide. Such ammunition is typically tricky to \nacquire, though, and legal inquiries often follow its use. \nDestroy Shield \nAlthough shields are rare in this day and age, certain Inquisitors and \nanachronistic mages still use them. A weapon capable of destroying a shield ‘ \npenetrates it automatically and renders it useless after a certain number of blows, \n!k \nno matter what the size or strength of the shield may be. \nFully Automatic \nA firearm with this ability can empty dozens of rounds into a single target at \nclose range. This attack inflicts an extra health level of damage automatically due \nto sheer volume of fire. However, the character must spend one action reloading \nthe weapon after emptying the clip before he may fire the weapon again. \n‘is \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nHigh-Caliber \nFirearms of particularly high caliber can cause crippling wounds with only \na few shots. When a high-caliber weapon hits a target, the attacker should make \na Simple Test immediately. A win indicates that the target suffers an additional \nhealth level of damage from the shot. \nIncendiary \nBurning weapons cause aggravated wounds to just about anything. Some \nincendiary weapons, such as flame-throwers or molotov cocktails, burn the \ntarget with streams or explosions of fire. Others such as incendiary rounds (“hot \nloads”) burn the target with superheated ammunition. \nMass-Trauma \nCertain weapons are so powerful that they inflict massive damage on a \ntarget by literally tearing away large portions of flesh. Such weapons score an \nextra health level of damage automatically when used appropriately. \nSpeed \nFast weapons can preempt an opponent’s attack, allowing the attacker with \nthe speedier weapon to strike and do his damage first. A character must have the \nMeke Ability to use this special weapon capability, and he must be attacking or \notherwise actively using the weapon in order to gain this benefit. Fast weapons \ngain a preemptive strike only against opponents in hand-to-hand or melee \ncombat, and the enemy must have a weapon that is Slow, Heavy or Clumsy. \nSince many attack challenges are resolved simultaneously for ease of play, this \nability is not always very useful. However, if the Storyteller opts to allow each attacker \nto test individually, this ability gives characters with fast weapons an advantage. It also \n’ [ allows a character with a fast weapon to preempt someone who’s attacking a friend in \norder to block the attack, disarm the attacker or strike the attacker first. \nSpray \nThe weapon can strike several targets at once, as noted under the weapon’s \nspecific parameters. The shooter makes one test against all the targets simulta- \n1 neously. Each target who fails the test suffers the weapon’s damage, while each \n‘ target who succeeds avoids the weapon’s damage. The shooter risks only the \nTraits required to test against each member of the group, and he loses Traits only \nif any of the defenders wins the test. \nBIDDING WWCBN \nTRAITS \nDuring a normal hand-to-hand fight, characters bid Physical Traits against \ntheir opponents’ Physical Traits. However, a character may use his Mental Traits \ninstead ifhe is using firearms. Ifhis opponent isalsousingafirearm, she bids Mental \nTraits as well. If the opponent is not using a firearm and is merely trying to dodge, \nshe uses her Physical Traits. This instance is one of the few in which Traits \nassociated with different Attributes may be used against one another. \nWW@N \n‘EXAmPLES \nmELEE W W C D N S  \nKnife/Dagger -These easily concealed weapons are very common, they’re \nlightning fast in the hands of a skilled user, and they can also be used as ranged \nweapons if a character uses his Athletics Ability properly.

It is not included automatically when using a rifle. \nShotgun - \nThis powerful weapon fires a spray of pellets, making it fairly \neasy to hit one's target. \nBonus Traits: 3 \nNegative Traits: Loud \nConcealability: None \nDamage: Two lethal health levels \nAvailability: Any, if registered. Police 4, Street 4 or Underworld 3 otherwise. \nSpecial Ability: Spay: A shotgun may affect up to three targets if they are \nstanding immediately next to each other and they are farther than 20 feet from \nthe person firing the shotgun. This capability remains in effect only if the \nshotgun is loaded with pellets, not slugs. Mass-Trauma: A shotgun can cause an \nextra health level of damage to a single target standing within five feet. \nSubmachine Gun-These \nweapons are very powerful, and they fire a large \nnumber of bullets very quickly, which makes them the favorites in situations \nwhere accuracy isn't as important as hitting a large number of targets at the same \ntime. The law requires that these guns be sold as non-automatic weapons, with \nonly single-shot capability, but a use of the Technology Ability can convert them \nto fully automatic fire. \nBonus Traits: 2 \nNegative Traits: Loud \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nConcealability: Jacket \nDamage: Two lethal health levels \nAvailability: Any, if registered and non-automatic.

Fully Automatic: A submachine gun inflicts an \nadditional health level of damage if the shooter empties the entire clip into a \ntarget standing no more than five feet away. \nChain Gun - \nThe dreaded signature weapon of the cyborg HIT Mark, \nthese full-blown assault cannons fire a disgusting amount of bullets at great speed \nand shred anything caught in their path. Unless one is willing to use some serious \nvulgar magic, however, they cannot be carted around willy-nilly. Conventional \nchain guns are heavy and hard to control, and they require a tripod mount and \nsometimes even a second person to operate properly. Also, authorities will stop \nat nothing to track down characters who sport this kind of firepower. \nBonus Traits: 5 \nNegative Traits: Loud, Clumsy \nConcealability: None, although HIT Marks may due to magical enhancement. \nDamage: Three lethal health levels \nAvailability: Only through military or Technocratic channels. \nSpecial Ability: S p y :  A chain gun may affect up to five targets if they’re standing \nimmediately next to each other and they are farther than 10 feet from the person firing \nthe gun. Fully Automatic: A chain gun inflicts an additional health level of damage if \nthe entire turn of fire is emptied into a target standing no more than five feet away. \nBelow are the statisticsfor two basic technomagical weapons. Remember that \nthe difference between these weapons and using, say, Forces or Matter Effects to do \nthe same thing is that Sleepers can use these weapons as well as mages. They run \non Quintessence batteries, so one needs no magical knowledge to use them. \nHowever, non-mages cannot fix, recharge, alter or otherwise tinker with these \nweapons since they lack the enlightenment to truly understand how they work. \nLaser Pistol -Although it’s not exactly standard Technocratic issue yet, \nthis category serves as a catch-all for not only laser pistols but other similar \noutlandish firearms, including sonic disrupters, disintegration rays or other ? \nsuch sci-fi weapons. \nBonus Traits: 2 \nNegative Traits: Clumsy, Loud \nConcealability: Jacket \nDamage: Two aggravated health levels \nClip: 10 Quintessence Traits (one Trait per shot) \nAvailability: Only Technocracy agents or others with access to sufftciently \nenlightened science (such as some Etherites and their acolytes) can have this weapon. \nSpecial Ability: Armor-Piercing: Laser pistols completely ignore all conven- \ntional armor.

These monsters of Enlightened \nScience are impossibly vulgar to wield, and it requires a hideous amount of \nQuintessence to keep one in operation, but they do put tremendous holes in \nthings very quickly. They fire a bolt of superheated plasma at their target, \nreducing it to melted goo in seconds. They can also be configured to fire a solid \nstream of plasma that’s capable of dousing multiple targets at once, although \ndoing so drains the weapon’s power supply very quickly. \nBonus Traits: 6 \nNegative Traits: Clumsy , Heavy, Loud \nConcealability: Uh-huh. Sure. Keep dreaming. \nDamage: Three aggravated health levels \nClip: Six Quintessence Traits (one Trait per shot, or three Traits for each \nplasma stream fired) \nAvailability: No! Even most senior Technocrats have trouble getting their \nhands on one of these things, and they do so only if they can justify the need for \nextreme force in dealing with a very specific threat. And as soon as that threat \nis dealt with, you better believe this thing is going back into storage, or some very \nill-tempered operatives will be dispatched to recover both weapon and wielder \nwithout mercy or delay. Before anyone asks, very few Etherites or other \nTradition folks have access to such weapons of total destruction either. Those \nwho like to trot them out to deal with their problems will be facing gangs of \nticked off Paradox spirits and/ or Technocracy agents in no time. \nSpecial Ability: Spray: A plasma thrower may affect up to five targets if \nthey’re standing immediately next to eachother and they are further than 10 feet \nI from the person firing the weapon. Incendiary: Targets injured by a plasma \nthrower are being melted rapidly. Mass-Trauma: Plasma melts away whole \nsections of the body and inflicts an extra health level of damage on a single target \nstanding within five feet of the shooter. \n’ \nh\n@\nR\n \n4 \nSince it stops incoming damage, armor effectively grants a character extra \n‘ health levels. These health levels are lost before the character himself suffers any \ndamage in combat. Ofcourse, armor doesnot stop all attacks. A bulletproofvest does \nlittle good for a character whose DNA is being scrambled by Life magic, for instance. \nDifferent types of armor can absorb different amounts of punishment before \nlosing their effectiveness. It should be noted, however, that armor that has lost \nall its health levels is not necessarily completely destroyed. Instead, it has been \ntemporarily rendered useless. Of course, some attacks may destroy armor beyond \n#= repair. Fixing armor requires the proper tools and a Static Physical Challenge \nwith the appropriately specialized Craft Ability. \nArmor has two different traits for game purposes. Health levels indicate \nhow many levels of damage the armor can absorb before it needs to be \nI repaired. Negative Traits are the drawbacks a wearer gains for donning a \nI \n= particular type of armor. \nChain armor - \nThis category covers most medium levels of metal armor, \nincluding scale and brigandine. True chain armor is quite rare in the modem age, \nbut some hunters of the supernatural keep a suit on hand, as does the occasional \nChorister or Akashic Brother. \n~ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nP~lm~um \nAR~CEIR \nOne special type of protection exists for mag6 - \narmor forged from the \nial anti-magical alloy known as Primium.

Chain armor must generally be custom made, and it can \ncost upward of $500 or more. \nPlate armor -Extremely expensive and hard to come by, these ornate suits \nof interlocking metal plates provide excellent protection at the cost of a great \ndeal of mobility. \nHealth levels: 3 \nNegative Traits: Heavy, Clumsy \nAvailability: Any. Plate mail must generally be custom-ordered, and it can \ncost upward of $3000 or more. \nBallistic (“bulletproof”) vest -This basic level of protection shields the \nwearer from some dangers, and it doesn’t attract the same kind of attention that \nmore archaic or complicated forms of armor are bound to bring. \nHealth levels: 2 \nNegative Traits: Heavy \nAvailability: Police 4 or Underworld 3 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nReinforced armor (“riot gear”) -As the favored type of armor for military \npersonnel and law enforcement officers expecting especially dangerous situa- \ntions, these full-body suits provide excellent protection. They even stop many \ntypes of small arms fire. They are impossible to conceal, however, and they \nattract a great deal of attention. \nHealth levels: 3 \nNegative Traits: Heavy, Clumsy \nAvailability: Police 5 or Underworld 4 \nIn rare cases, the Technocracy outfits its agents with specially designed \ntechnomagical armor. The examples listed here are just a couple of items. Many \nmore varieties exist. \nSilksteel suit -Men in Black never seem to become ruffled in combat, and \nthis is why. These specially enhanced black suits absorb damage almost as well \nas ballistic armor. \nTKHNWIIAGICAL \nAN~ICBR \nHealth levels: 1 \nNegative Traits: None \nAvailability: Technocracy operatives only. \nSpecial Ability: Fire-Retardant: The silksteel suit doesn’t catch on fire. \nAttacks that would normally cause the subject to bum over successive tums can \nstill cause damage, but the fire goes out automatically. \nMagnetic shield-Likealaserpistol, amagneticshieldpweredwithQuintesence \ncanbeusedbyjustaboutanyone.Tneshieldradiatesfromasmallbandwomonthewrist \nand makes a circle about afoot across that repels attacks from just about any source.

However, each attack weakens \nthe shield a little more until the device must be recharged by a qualified technician. \nHealth levels: 2 per attack \nNegative Traits: None \nPower: 10 Quintessence, using 1 per health level absorbed from each attack \nAvailability: Technocracy operatives only. \nMany weapons allow a character to stand at a distance from a target and \nengage him in combat. In such situations, the character must still go over to the \ntarget (after shouting “Bang!” or “Twang!”) and engage in a challenge. \n~ \n~ \nIf a character has surprised her opponent, she has the option of calling for \n* ’ a second test, even if she loses the first test. Once the second challenge is called, \n-k play continues as normal. If the target has no ranged weapon with which to \nreturn fire, he cannot counterattack his attacker until he closes the distance. \nIf the target is aware of the attack before it happens, and he has a ranged \nweapon of his own, he is not considered surprised for the first attack. He may \n, t shoot back right away, and challenges are resolved normally. \n.* \nCharacters using the Athktics Ability to throw projectiles like knives or \nI \naxes fall under the same rules for regular ranged combat, including cover. \nQuestions of range should not be a problem, but if it becomes an issue use \n*: \ncommon sense. Also, don’t forget to make allowances for things like characters \nwhose strength or range has been enhanced with various Effects. \n; \nRANG~D \nC~ITIBAT \n‘ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nC@V€R \nFighting with ranged weapons allows combatants to stand some distance apart. \nTherefore, participants in a ranged combat can also dive for cover. When resolving \neachrangedcombatchallenge, eachcombatantcan presentoneTrait ofcover toadd \nto his total number of Traits. These cover Traits may not be used as an initial bid in \nthe challenge, but they do add to a player's total in the event of a tie or an overbid. \nThis aver can take the form of whatever obstacles are around and within reach, but \ndon't actually dive for them. A Narrator might be required to describe what cover \nis around, unless the combatants can agree on what cover is available. \nIf cover is extensive, it may be worth more than one Trait. The number of \nTraits available for cover is left for challengers to agree on, or for a Narrator to \ndecree. Hiding behind a boulder, for example, might be worth two Traits, while \nhiding behind a thin wooden fence might count as just one. If one combatant goes \ncompletely under cover (he cannot be seen at all and he is thoroughly protected), \nhe cannot be hit. The attacker must change position to get a clear shot. \n~ E L E  \nAND BRAWLING \nMelee fighting can occur only when two parties are within weapon's reach of each \nother. Characters using melee weapons often have access to special abilities if they also \npossess the Melee Ability. For example, a trained character using a fencing foil can take \nadvantage of his weapon's speed when fighting a character wielding an ax. \nBrawling can occur only when two characters are within arm's length of \neach other. Characters engaged in a brawl may use unarmed combat techniques \non each other, including trips, kicks, punches, wrestling holds and throws. \nHowever, all brawling tests result in one health level of bashing damage \nregardless of the description, unless the character possesses some supernatural \npower or other ability that specifically allows for extra damage. \nSPECIALIZED \nFIGHTING \nSTYLES \nBuying a specialized fighting style under the Melee or Brawl Ability allows you \nto describe how your character moves in order to justify retests, and it adds acertain \nflair to your attacks and defenses. However, doing so does not allow you to do extra \ndamage or specific injuries. The only exception is the Akashic Brotherhood's \nspecialty Do, which allows the attacker to inflict lethal damage unarmed. \nT W ~ G U N  \nI~BTGI \nIt's possible to use more than one weapon at a time in combat, although it's quite \ntricky. Justperformingataskwiththewronghanddetractsfromyourchanceofsuccess. \nCompounding matters by doing something else with the other hand doesn't help. \nFor the purposes of simplicity, it's usually easiest to assume that the \ncharacter has the same-handedness as the player. Furthermore, these rules do \nnot apply to common uses of both hands, such as typing, playing a musical \ninstrument or working a craft. \nTherefore, you must bid a total of three Traits to initiate the challenge, and you \nhave a lower chance of success. \nWhen you specialize in a fighting style, you can choose Two-Weapon Combat \nor Florentine for your specialty. Doing so negates one penalty Trait from your \nattacks with the specified form ofcombat. Therefore, instead ofbidding twoTraits \n1 t!, I, I \n' \nWhen performing tasks with the off hand, you suffer a two-Trait penalty. b; \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwith your primary hand and three with your off hand, you would bid one for your \nprimary hand and two Traits for your off hand. Developing such a specialty should \ntake months of training. Also, remember to use common sense about the weapons \nthat can be employed in this manner. Using two pistols or even two broadswords \nis within the realm of possibility (this is a game, after all). Using two shotguns or \ntwo spears at the same time, however, is out of the question. \nWhen using both hands, you get only one extra action, regardless of Time \nEffects or similar speed-altering powers, and you split your actions equally between \nboth hands. If you use a Time rote that's good for two extra actions, and you're using \nboth hands, you get your normal action, your two Time actions and your extra hand \naction, for a total of four actions. You would then split up those actions between \neach hand. If you took an action or two to do other things, you'dsplit the remainder \nevenly. Any leftover actions are applied to your primary hand automatically. \nCeNTESTS @f W I L L  \nContests of will, in which two rivals try to dominate each other without \ncoming to blows (or rotes), are actually a fairly common occurrence in mage \nsociety. The idea is to force one's rival to back down before a real conflict \nactually arises. Success in a contest of wills is determined in one of two ways. \nFirst, it is highly recommended that this action be roleplayed out rather than \nresorting to the rules. In this case, if one of the players relents while roleplaying \nthis contest, his opponent is the winner. \nIf a quick result is needed, or if neither of the players relents, a Social \nChallenge can determine the victor instead. Remember, though, that a contest \nof wills is supposed to be a moment of dramatic tension, not simply a chance to \nshow off one's social prowess. \nTRUE \nF\n~\nH\n \nTrue Faith is the belief in a power, entity, consciousness or purpose that is \ngreater than oneself. As such, it is not limited to any particular religion. Even \nmages can have it, but even so, they must be of the most pure character. Only \nthe trulv selfless, caring, compassionate and courageous have a chance at \n- \npossessing True Faith, and it's not a certainty even then. \nTrue Faith is also apotent weapon against Infernal agents such as the Nephandi \nor the undead, and it can drive them from the area or even turn back their powers \nif the faith in question is strong enough. Members of the Celestial Chorus tend to \n'* \nbe the most common wizards with True Faith (if it can be said to be common at all, \n: that is), but it is not limited to them. Verbena, Dreamspeakers, Akashics, Cultists \na and even Euthanatoi have all been known to display True Faith as well. \n' Technomancers' faith in science tends to preclude such superstitious beliefs, but \neven so, it is not impossible for them to have it. It is simply much less likely. \nCharacters may improve their degree of faith only with exceptional roleplaying \n\" 1  and explicit Storyteller approval. The game uses for True Faith are covered \n' exhaustively in Laws of the Hunt, but some basic rules for Faith are included here. \nBy brandishing his holy symbol, the bearer gains the Social Trait: \nIntimidating when repelling Nephandi or the undead. If someone uses it to strike \na n  such a supernatural creature, a holy symbol grants the extra Physical Traits \nBurning and Searing, and it inflicts one level of aggravated damage. If a target is \n: \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsupernaturally repelled by crosses, he takes an additional level of aggravated \ndamage if a person with True Faith so much as touches his bare skin with a cross. \nA character with True Faith may attempt to repel Nephandi or vampires by \nbrandishing his holy symbol, invoking his belief (“In the name of \n, I command \nyou to be gone!”) and engaging in a Social Challenge. If the faithful character wins \nthe challenge, the cursed being must flee the area immediately. Even if the character \nfails, the targetmust stillbackoff afewfeetandcowerbeforetakingaction.Thetarget \nstill may not initiate any spells or attacks during the next turn, although she may \ndefend herself normally. A target may resist this use ofTrue Faith only by attempting \nto overbid with Willpower. If she currently possesses at least twice as many \nWillpower Traits as the faithful character, she remains unaffected. A character may \nattempt to repel multiple targets with a group challenge. \nA character may choose to add his Faith Traits to his total Traits on any \ntest to resist magical Effects or any of the powers of an Infernal agent. This system \nreflects the character placing his faith in the certainty of his defense, and it can \noffer an advantage in a crucial moment. Remember, however, that the character \nis still subject to the usual rules about crises of faith if he fails any such defensive \ntests, making this tactic risky at best. \nIt is much easier to lose one’s True Faith than it is to gain it. Any time a \ncharacter fails a test in which True Faith is involved, he has a crisis of faith. \nDuring such a time, he is one Trait down on all Social Challenges for the \nremainder of the scene, and he unable to invoke his True Faith again until that \nTrait has been restored. (The Trait returns at the Narrator’s discretion, but it \nshould involve excellent roleplaying.) \nDERANGE~ENTS \nMore than a few mages think that they’ve gone crazy when the Awakening \nhits, but fortunately this isn’t the case very often. However, the war for reality \ncan still exact a heavy toll on who fight it. Bending reality to suit one’s will, \ntraveling to worlds far removed from our own and facing down the wrath of the \nuniverse personified is stuff that would snap lesser minds in seconds. Even as \nstrong-willed as mages are, they still risk developing derangements when they \nface the horrors that lurk in reality’s shadows or confront overpowering condi- \ntions ofextreme terror, guilt or anxiety. The Storyteller may decide aderangement \nis in order after any experience that generates especially intense and unpleasant \nemotions, or which violates a character’s beliefs or ethics severely. \nDerangements usually become active only when certain particular circum- ‘1 \nstances trigger them. Once activated, though, derangements remain in effect for \nthe rest of the scene, and players must modify their character’s Traits, attitudes and :,‘ \nbehavior in accordance with the derangement description. Keep in mind that a ‘- \nmage with a derangement is not the same as a Marauder. The chaos wizards have \nused some unknown magical means to harness madness as a shield against \nParadox, but a character suffering a derangement is just insane. What’s more, a \nderanged mage can still be cured, whereas the path of a Marauder is a one-way \nstreet. Of course, nothing says that a deranged mage might not take that path one \nday, but that’s a question for the player and Storyteller in question to explore. \nCharacters may resist their derangements by expending a Willpower Trait. \nThis effect lasts for one scene, but if the trigger is still present at the end of that \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ntime, the character must spend another Willpower Trait. In the case of \nparticularly intense mental stress, Narrators may rule that a Static Willpower \nChallenge or additional Willpower Traits are required. It is up to the Storyteller \nto determine what amount of time and Willpower is required to cure a \nderangement, and such cures are best left to thoughtful and involved roleplaying \nrather than a simple Trait expenditure. \nFinally, remember that experiencing derangements are different from \nentering Quiet. While both conditions may sometimes cause similar effects in \nmages, one stems from a Paradox Backlash, while the other is the result of more \nmundane disturbance. A truly unlucky wizard might suffer from both conditions \nat once, or a prolonged Quiet might create some permanent derangement, but \nthe conditions are intrinsically different. \nNote: Nothing about the way a deranged person acts is funny or arbitrary. \nThe insane character is only reacting to the stimuli that he perceives to be real. \nAs far as he knows, his behavior is perfectly normal. Players should also never \nforget that the Mind’s Eye Theatre rules of safety still apply when roleplaying \nderangements. Roleplaying Cnmson Rage is fine, but smashing the scenery or \ns is against the rules and obnoxious (not to mention \nwho aren’t playing the game). Don’t do it. \nBulimic characters salve their guilt and insecurity by overindulging in \nactivities that comfort them (such as eating). Characters with this affliction will \ngorge themselves as much as possible under stress then purge their systems \ndrastically. At the Narrator’s discretion, the character may overindulge in other \npleasurable activities - \nsex, dancing, even Quintessence -but such alterations \nshould be uncommon, and they should be justified in the character’s history. \nA character with this derangement experiences unprovoked fits of anger \ngs of helplessness and inadequacy. Most such fits are \no overcome some obstacle, or being confronted by a specific \nch as pain, emotional distress or romantic failure). The \nith the Narrator to determine what triggers his character’s \nderangement. Whenever this derangement is active, the character gains the \nNegative Traits: Vioknt x2 and Impatient, and the player should roleplay the fury \nas well as possible within the Mind’s Eye Theatre rules of safety. \ning this affliction react to stress by adopting a specific set \ns. In the process, they suffer blackouts or periods of memory loss. \nWhen confronted by extreme stress, the character must win a Static Willpower \nChallenge. If he fails, the character blacks out and the player must roleplay the \ncharacter’s trancelike state. Otherwise, control of the character passes to a \nNarrator for a scene, who dictates the actions the character takes in order to \ni * ~ \nremove the stress. At the end of the fugue, the character comes to his rightful \nsenses with no memory of his fugue actions. \nrs with this derangement are unable to control their emotions \nsubjected to stress or pressure. They become vulnerable to wild \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmood swings and fits of intense violence against the source of their discomfort. \nThe mage must make a Willpower test against five Traits any time such stress \nis present. If she fails, she is two Traits down on all Social tests due to her wildly \nfluctuating moods, and she gains the Negative Trait: Violent as well. In addttion, \nthis derangement activates automatically whenever the mage fails in a particu- \nlarly stressful or important challenge. (Narrators have final say on what classifies \nas such a dramatic failure.) \nManic-Depression \nThis derangement causes a character to suffer devastating mood swings. \nWhenever the character fails to achieve a personal goal, she must win a Static \nWillpower Challenge or fall into adepressive state for anumberofscenesdetermined \nby the Narrator. While depressed, the character’s Willpower Traits are considered \nhalved (round down, minimum one) for purposes of Trait comparison, and she may \nnot use Effects to raise her Physical Traitsor otherwise lighten her mood. After that, \nshe enters aperiod of highly upbeat energy and excitement, in which she pursues her \ngoals obsessively for a number of scenes equal to the time she spent in depression. \nDuring this manic time, she has the Negative Trait: Impatient x2. \nMegalomania \nThese individuals have made power the focus of their existence, and they \ncharacters must always be the most potent individuals in their environment. Where \nthe power stems from is irrelevant as long as they are dominant. They believe that \nother people are divided into two classes: lesser beings and beings elevated beyond \ntheir worth. Due to their supreme confidence, mages with this derangement are \nconsidered one Trait up on all Willpower tests while their derangement is active. \nHowever, they must also make a Willpower test (difficulty six Traits) to resist any \nopportunity to put people in their place or reprimand any contentious upstarts who \ndare to presume beyond their station during that time. Although megalomaniacs \nplay for keeps, the actions they take against others in this state neednot be mindlessly \nviolent. However, they are typically vicious in the extreme. They are designed to \nhumiliate the offender and exalt the mage’s standing in the eyes of others. \n, - \nMultiple Personalities \nA character with this derangement has suffered mental anguish so severe that his \nmind reacted by creating additional personas. Each personality is relevant to the \ntrauma that caused it, and the player should work with the Storyteller to determine \neach personality’s Nature and what triggers a particular one to rise to the surface. When \na personality is triggered, it assumes control until the conditions it was created to deal \nwith have passed. Characters can manifest different Abilities and even Spheres for \neach personality, however, all such Traits must still be purchased normally. What a \npersonality believes it can do is often very different from what it is actually capable of. \n~ \nAny such arrangements must be worked out with the Storyteller. \nObsessive/Compulsive \nCharacters suffering from this derangement are driven to control their environ- \nment. Obsessive characters keep one aspect of their life constant, be it personal \ncleanliness or simply keeping things quiet. Compulsive characters perform specific \nactions or sets of actions, such as washing their hands constantly or always saying i \nlengthy prayers after touching another person. Obsessive/ compulsive characters are \none Trait up to resist any Mind Effects or any other attempts to coerce them to give up \ntheir set behaviors, but they attack anyone who tries to prevent them from adhering \nI \nF; ’ - \n1, .I \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nto their derangement. They need not try to kill the target, but they will d i c t  as much \nharm as is necessary to allow them to indulge in their derangement once again. If no \nclear individual is the source of their frustration, then the nearest person at hand will \nsufhce. Failing that, the scenery or even the character himself is in for a world of hurt. \nParanoid beings believe that all their woesand suffering stem fro mamalicious \nexternal source. Many afflicted beings come up with intricate theories about just \nwho is against them and why. Those they suspect of being against them are often \nsubject to swift and brutal violence. Paranoid characters trust no one, not even \nfamily members or close friends, and they have a difficult time interacting with \nothers. They are one Trait down on all Social Challenges while their derangement \nis active, and they suffer from the Negative Traits: Vioknt and Condescending. \nCharacters suffering from this affliction avoid facing responsibilities or \nconsequences by retreating to a younger state of mind in which they feel that less \nIndividuals with this derangement have had their psyche fractured by terrible, \nunresolved inner conflicts. Most people conceive of this disorder when they think \nabout insanity. Victims might imagine anything from the relatively harmless delusion \nthat they’rewalking agoldfishonaleash, tothemoresinisterconvictionthat they must \ncut out their children’s eyes to keep them from being tainted by the evil on television. \nEven still, this disorder is anything but arbitrary. The player should work with the \nStoryteller to determine a general set of behaviorj relevant to the original trauma. \nMages with this derangement are unpredictable and dangerous. In situations where \ntheir inner conflict flares up, they must retest any kind of challenge to retain self- \n* control that theywin. ( Ifthey win thatretest, they do not have toretest again, though.) \ni \nTRADITI~N \nPWTICS \nLife is like high school, only with money. \n- \nFrank Zappa \nMany young mages assume that enlightenment will bring about tolerance, \n; understanding and an end to the kind of petty politics that runs rampant in the \nmundane world. Unfortunately, such isn’t usually the case. Mages are as famous \nfor their egos as their abilities, and feuds can last decades or even centuries as one \ngroup of mages tries to assert its dominance or its paradigm over another. Even \nwithin a Tradition, various cliques and factions vie for recognition and control \nof resources.

At the \n’ *_( pinnacle of this dream stood the Council of Nine, a collection of the wisest and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmost powerful mages of each Tradition who would oversee everyone’s efforts and \nprovide a neutral ground for the exchange of ideas and settling of grievances. \nSheltered in a Realm known simply as Horizon, the Council met for several \ncenturies, weathering the worst times on Earth and encouraging the bursts of \ncreativity and invention that kept magic alive as the Technocratic Union \nspread across the globe. As the Hermetics and their numerologists well know, \nnine is a number that represents the highest synthesis of power. \nDestiny can be cruel, however, for a combination of political infighting and \na crippling invasion have recently brought the Council crashing down. Nothing \nhas been heard from Horizon since the Avatar Storm began and the Gauntlet \nstrengthened. Even many Masters on Earth disappeared or fled to seek refuge \nfrom a world that balked at their magical presence. \nAs a result, the Traditions are left without much of their senior leadership, \nand the mages of Earth have begun adjusting to the reality of those changes. \nSome hotheads have responded by pointing fingers and laying blame, which has \nonly increased the tension between Traditions. Other mages are searching \ndesperately for some way of contacting the surviving Councilors. Many of those \nmages who remain have simply given up in disgust or despair, thinking that this \nis just one more sign that the Technocracy has finally triumphed after all. \nMany, but not all. \nA few dedicated souls still strive to keep the Council’s dream of unity alive. \nThey work in ways large and small to foster fellowship and cooperation between \nthe Traditions and to douse the divisive flames that threaten to consume what \nremains of the grand design. Theirs is perhaps the most difficult and least certain \npath of all those that lie before the Awakened, but those who follow it draw from \na deep well of strength indeed. Sometimes it seems that they alone remember \nwhat the Traditions ultimately stand for: \nHope. \nAs individualistic as many mages are, it’s no surprise that different camps \nand cliques within each Tradition have long struggled to establish their own \ninterpretation ofhow to uphold the Tradition’s goals. What’s more, the modern \nage of division and isolation has opened many of these old wounds once again \nand created more than a few new schisms. \nAn Apprentice who follows one mentor may find himself snubbed by others \nof his Tradition, and he not have the slightest clue as to why until much later \non in his training. Likewise, those who fail to espouse the “correct” doctrine may \nfind themselves unable to gain access to Chantries, Nodes, mentors, libraries or \nother Tradition resources, depending on who controls these assets and how they \nfeel about a character’s metaphysical viewpoint. Some Traditions are more \nlenient than others when it comes to tolerating members of other factions, but !, \nmost mages have an opinion on the matter of factional alliance, even if they \ndon’t choose to act on it. As some seasoned faction players say, choosing not to \nbe on a team is really a team of its own, and no one gets to just sit on the sidelines. \nStorytelling disputes between factions is perhaps the ultimate exploration \nof delicate alliances, double entendres and the well-timed snub. Since outright \nbattle is strictly frowned upon by all Traditions (although it does still happen \nFACTI~NS \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\noccasionally), and harsh penalties follow those who shed the blood of fellow \nTradition members, mages of differing factions must wage their wars subtly and \nkill each other with a thousand tiny cuts. Since most Tradition members appear \nto embrace the same philosophies on the surface, the slightest difference in \nmetaphysical phrasing can carry immense political and social consequences. A \nrejected invitation can become a declaration of war, and a remark that was \nmeant as merely a passing comment can earn a character powerful allies.. . or \nlasting enemies. Turn the paranoia factor up, make the characters feel they must \nlook into the motives of their fellow Tradition members at every turn, and make \nall contact with others of their kind seem significant. \nCHANTNES \nChantries serve as strongholds of magic, whether they are baroque hillside \nmanors or the back of a beat-up station wagon, and control of these places of \npower IS one of the oldest conflicts in Awakened society. Even members of the \nTechnocratic Union sometimes have to step in to break up fights between \nConventions over a particularly powerful Node. \nDifferent Chantries in an area may do battle with each other over local \nmagical and mundane resources, or even to determine who will get the first pick \nof particularly talented Awakened students. Sometimes members of a squatter \nChantry - \none without a Node -will \neven try to oust mages from an existing \nChantry to gain control of its power reservoir. Battles of this sort are typically \nbrutal and quick, and the winners take all. Within a Chantry itself, clique feuds \nerupt all too frequently as different groups argue over issues such as leadership \nof the Chantry and who will have access to specific Chantry features. Sometimes \nthese cliques form along Tradition lines, sometimes they center around cabals, \nand sometimes they simply represent social or political groups. \nChantry-versus-Chantry conflicts form some of the easiest stories to frame \nin Laws of Ascension. Unlike faction feuding, Chantry conflicts can easily flare \nup into exchanges of magical or mundane violence, and little quarter is typically \ni given on either side, especially when vital resources such as Nodes are at stake. \nThese story types are fairly straightforward, and they can be the most powerful \nii ones as well, depending on whether the players want a want to create a shadow \nwar of double agents and secret meetings or a very real war that actually bums \nQuintessence and spills blood on the streets. It's usually just a question of how \nmuch the Storyteller wishes to emphasize politics or violence in the game. \nWhen building stories about rivalries within the Chantry, a Storyteller has a few \n: : immediateoptions. He canstress openand entrenched feuds, in whichdifferent cliques \nP don't hesitate toshowtheirdisdainforeachotheranddotheirbesttoaltematelyignore \n' and persecute members of other cliques. In this type of story, only dire issues such as \nI the defense of the Chantry itself can rouse any collective response. New mages are not \ncertainly immune to being sucked into these conflicts, whether they like it or not. \nI, Characters in those situations must choose their allies carefully and be careful to not \n' appear too sympathetic to members of another clique, even by accident. \nAnother option is to have a Chantry that appears to be unified, but is \nactually a simmering cauldron of rumors, love affairs, hidden dislikes and other \nexplosive events, which those in charge just barely keep in check. Mages in this \nenvironment must swim these dark and tossing waters even as they keep up a \n. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nfacade of friendliness to everyone, and they must remember that making friends, \ncutting deals or even just falling in love can have dire consequences. \nCABALS \nA mage’s cabal is often the only real family she has left. The people in her \ncabal are the only ones who understand her new life, face her problems with her, \nand who she can count on to back her up when she needs it most. Even if the cabal \nformedout ofamore pragmaticconcern-such asmutualprotectionor advancing \nsome collective interest - \nand not due to any particular ties of friendship, the \nmembers of a cabal know that they can trust and depend on each other. \nCabals used to be composed of members of one Tradition, but this trend \nbroke down in the last century. Faced with the Avatar Storm and the end of the \nAscension War, most modem mages are glad for any company they can find. Of \ncourse, even the tightest cabals can still fall victim to the same problems that \ngroups of friends or associates do in everyday life. Jealousy, ambition, romantic \nfallout, petty feuds, buried grudges or even simple differences of opinion can all \nstir up divisive conflict within a particular cabal. \nSince they tend to form these groups on their own, the basic interactions of \nthe players naturally generate many cabal-oriented plot lines, as different cabals \ncome into conflict and members’ attitudes change over time. Those players or \nStorytellers looking for additional motivation or ways to approach stories about \ncabal conflicts should think about that original battleground of personal associa- \ntion: high school. Remember how the different cliques used to butt heads, often \nover the smallest and stupidest things?Think about how your own circle of friends \nalways seems to have some crisis or another going on, be it a love triangle, two \npeople who aren’t speaking to one another or some other interpersonal turmoil. \nKeep that social dynamic in mind and extrapolate from it the behaviors of \ncosmically enlightened folks with gigantic egos who are waging a largely one-sided \nand desperate battle against the ultimate symbol of authority. From that perspec- \ntive, it’s not hard to see how conflicts can arise between or within cabals. \nI \nRANK AND REPUTATI~N \nWhen the Council ofNine formed, one of the first initiatives that the Order \nof Hermes took on was to establish a standard system of ranks and titles, so that \nmages would have a universal means of recognizing magical accomplishment. \nMages tend to be rather highly competitive by nature, so keeping up a strong \npublic image is a point of both pride and necessity for many wizards. \nReputation is the game measure of a mage’s standing among others of her \nkind, and it is measured in Traits. It usually stems from a proven level of magical \naccomplishment, although it can also be a function of holding some official \nposition in the magical community, such as a Chantry head or faction leader. A t \nmage may also gain Reputation Traits by being influential in a city’s business I \ncommunity, pulling off impressive magical feats, foiling the plots of rival groups \n1 1  \nor by simply catching the right eyes at the right time. \nAnyone taken into a Tradition immediately receives the Trait: Accepted. , \nThose without this Trait cannot be subject to Tradition justice save for the most ; , \nserious crimes, but they also cannot expect aid, shelter or even civil treatment \nfrom proper Tradition mages either. Different Traits are bestowed at each rank, , \nas shown in the following chart. \n- \nh,qb 9’ 1 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nA character who has earned both the Apprentice and Initiate levels of a \nSphere qualifies as an Initiate. She becomes a Disciple when she earns the first \nDisciple level in a Sphere, and she becomes an Adept when she earns the first \nAdept level in a Sphere, and so on. A character can earn each Reputation Trait \nonly once, upon attaining that level of mastery of a Sphere for the first time. \nTherefore, if a character earns Promising for his advancement in the Life Sphere, \nA he will not earn it again if he demonstrates the same degree of mastery over the \nPrime Sphere. He has already proven that he possesses that level ofenlightenment. \nTroupes should feel free to invent ReputationTraits to suit their own stories \nand the deeds of the characters receiving the Traits. For example, a mage who \nturns back a terrifying Nephandi assault might earn a Trait like Fearless or Nobk. \nA Chantry leader might be considered Trustedor Revered by the local cabals, and \na wizard who establishes a homeless shelter to give hope to the downtrodden \nmight receive one such as Wise or Understanding. \nHere are some common uses of Reputation: \nYoumay add your ReputationTraits toyour SocialTraitsduring anapplicable \nSocial Challenge. (Note: You may not do so in casting a magical Effect unless the \nStoryteller specifically approves of such usage in advance.) You must announce such \nausage before resolving the challenge, however, since the target can choose to ignore \nyour Reputation and force you to rely on your normal Social Traits. Since most \nReputation Traits derive from accomplishments rather than social acclaim, such a \nsnub is a serious insult in Awakened society. Even if he wins the challenge, the \noffending character can expect lasting enmity and possibly even some form of formal \npunishment. Someone who ignores the Reputation Traits a bully is using to \nintimidate him might get away without too much trouble, but amage who disregards \nReputation is a measure of a character’s creditability, as well as the general \nI regard her opinion receives in magical circles. In any formal debate between two \ncharacters that pits one mage’s word against another, in which no clear resolution \npresents itself, Reputation is the tie-breaking factor. In all suchcases, the character \nwith the most Reputation Traits is the one whose word is more likely to be \naccepted. However, those who get caught making false charges and relying on \ntheir Reputation Traits to save them lose face quickly and usually suffer other \npunishments as well. Reputation is also typically the deciding factor in detemin- \n* ing which plan of action a cabal or Chantry takes when multiple valid plans are \non the table and there’s no other way to determine which one to pick. \n’ \ne \n: another’s Reputation for no good reason can expect some serious consequences. \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nOne character may give Reputation Traits to another to show his favor, \nalthough the individual to which he gives the Reputation Trait must return it \nimmediately upon the asking. This system is the basis for scenes in which lowly \ncharacters get by guards or gain audience with a powerful being because they’re \nacting on behalf of a more respected character. However, if the bearer loses this Trait \nin a challenge, it is gone for the duration of the story, so be careful about whom you \nsupport. You can use loaned Reputation Traits exactly as you would use your own, \nbut you can give only one Trait of Reputation to any one person in this fashion. \nAnyone may remove Reputation Traits from characters of a lower rank than \nthemselves at a cost of one Reputation Trait per Trait to be removed. Removing \nReputation Traits also involves performing an appropriate smear campaign in \ncharacter. Only mages of the same Tradition may remove a character’s Accepted \nTrait. Removing Reputation Traits is a costly but effective way of showing one’s \ndisdain for a less experienced wizard and letting him know who really runs the show. \nAlternatively, a group of characters of lower rank can remove the \nReputation Traits of someone higher up the ladder than them, provided that \nthey all have more Reputation Traits between them than their target has. \nAccepted Traits do not count toward this total, unless all of the characters are of \nthe same Tradition as their target. This system provides younger mages a way to \nfight back when more experienced wizards try to rule them through force of \nReputation alone. They had best beware their own success, though. No mage is \ngoing to suffer in silence as a bunch of young upstarts give his image a black eye. \nReputation Traits cannot be granted by any particular system of game \nmechanics. A mage must earn these Traits through great deeds, honorable conduct \nand exemplary actions in pursuit of their Tradition’s goals. Character input figures into \nthe process as a measure of public opinion and approval, but only the Storyteller gives \nout Reputation Traits. Reputations are fragile things that are hard to build and all too \neasy to lose, so mages who play the status game had best be ready for a long and difficult \nroad. Even still, the potential rewards are worth the effort for those who pursue them. \nOrphans, Hollow Ones and other Disparates begin with no Reputation \nTraits, and they cannot gain any from Tradition mages. On the flip side, they \nsuffer no tangible consequences if they choose to ignore the Reputation Traits \nof a Tradition mage either. They might actually gain respect in the eyes of their \nfellows for a well-timed snub of this nature. Of course, they must still watch out \nfor any revenge plans the slighted mage might be cooking up, because being \nshown up by a lowly Orphan really sticks in a Tradition mage’s craw. \nAt the Storyteller’s discretion, Hollowers and others like them may \nreceive Reputation Traits in regard to their own kind, which function just like \nnormal Reputation Traits in eveh way. However, they never apply to Tradition \nmages, just as Tradition Reputation Traits do not apply to them. The social \n~ \ngames the Disparatesplay can be just as vicious as any Tradition politics, and this \nsystem adds another level to games with a substantial Orphan presence. \n, \n~ \nTRADITICBN \nTUSTICE \nEven though the Council has fallen, a system ofjustice still exists among the \nTraditions, and mages who violate that system’s laws can expect to be brought \nbefore some sort of formal tribunal eventually. Considering the magical and \nmundane resources a gathering of mages can bring to bear, it is usually not \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nterribly difficult to ascertain a subject’s guilt or innocence. Mind and Time rotes \nare common investigative measures, not mention highly effective ones, al- \nthough all of the other Spheres and a host of mundane Abilities can play a part \nas well. Resisting the use of investigative rotes performed by a tribunal is usually \nconsidered an admission of guilt, unless the accused can prove that some foul \nplay might occur during or as a result of their use. Suffice it to say, however, there \nare seldom many doubts as to the veracity of these verdicts, so most mages accept \nthe punishments that are handed down, however sorrowful it may be to do so. \nWhen it comes to crimes themselves, each Tradition has its own particular \nnotions of what counts as a crime, and they police their own on such subjective \nmatters. (See the Tradition descriptions in Chapter Two for a general idea of \nwhat they do and do not find acceptable.) However, there are some crimes that \nall Traditions recognize, and they will go to great lengths to punish those who \ncommit them. The type of punishment depends on the severity of the crime of \nwhich a mage is found guilty, and it can be anything from temporary ostracism \nto a permanent mark of shame to the destruction of an offender’s very Avatar. \nCertaimen \nTwo mages who exhaust normal channels of resolving a dispute sometimes \nturn to certzimen, a wizard’s duel that pits the mages’ skill with their Spheres \nagainst each other. Certzimen is traditionally performed with at least one witness \nwho acts as a judge, and it is almost always non-lethal. Indeed, it was invented as \nan alternative to the blood feuds that were too popular in darker times. To avoid \nParadox, certamen is almost always performed in a Chantry, although Hollowers \nand others without many mystical resources occasionally practice so-called “gutter \ncert6men” in back alleys and smoky clubs. Within a proper certzimen circle, \nk however, mages have free rein to conjure all manner of Effects, since certzimen \nnever incurs Paradox. The ultimate goal of a certamen is simple: You do not attack \nyour opponent directly, you destroy his reservoir of Quintessence Traits. \nTo this end, each mage uses his Spheres to form a gladius, an aegis, and a \ni locus. The gladius is the attacking Sphere that the mage uses to launch his \nassaults on his opponent’s Quintessence. The aegis is his defensive Sphere, and \nit governs how he must attempt to thwart his opponent’s strikes. The locus is the \nSphere that represents the mage’s Quintessence Traits. A mage may switch \nwhich Sphere he is using for any one of those three purposes at any time, but \ndoing so takes up his action for the turn. In addition, a given Sphere cannot be \nused for more than one of these purposes at a time. Finally, for each successful \nattack that slips past an opponent’s defenses, the attacker destroys one of his foe’s \n:: Quintessence Traits, and the first person to destroy all of his opponent’s \nQuintessence is the winner. As part of the certamen oath, the loser is expected \nto accept defeat graciously and live by it. \nRunning certzimen is primarily a descriptive exercise, based on the Spheres \neachmage is using. For example, an attacker using a Forces gladius may declare that \nshe is manifesting it as a bolt of flame and lashing out at her foe, while her opponent \n(using Matter as his aegis) declares that he is conjuring a wall ofwater to douse her \nflames, and so on. Certzimen can be over in seconds or hours, but it is seldom dull \nto watch. Regardless of what dramatically descriptive forms they take, though, all \nstrikes, blocks and dodges are resolved like normal magical tests and retests using \n, ‘ \n1 \n. \nI ,” the Spheres involved. The order of challenges likewise proceeds normally. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nStorytellers should emphasize the wits and ingenuity of the mages involved \nover strict systems as much as they can, however, and possibly even offer bonus \nTraits or other benefits to players whose attacks or defenses are particularly \nclever. Certhmen is supposed to be a battle of wits and magical prowess, not a \nshowcase for brute force and Trait-stacking. \nOstracism \nA form of collective shaming, ostracism is the typical punishment for those \nfound guilty of spilling secrets unwittingly, disrespecting an elder mage, wasting \nQuintessence on unnecessary magic, harming or manipulating Sleepers for no \ngood reason, feuding with a fellow cabal or Chantry member for petty reasons \nor other lapses of judgment that are not necessarily especially dangerous, but \nwhich still warrant asubs tantive punishment of some kind. Ostracized mages get \nthe proverbial “silent treatment” from their fellows for a proscribed number of \ndays or even weeks. During this period they are also denied further instruction \nby their mentors or access to libraries or other magical resources, in order to give \nthemmore time to thinkabout their crime. They may also be required to perform \nmenial tasks to teach them proper humility. While they will not be denied aid \nin an emergency, this otherwise total loss of personal contact often proves very \neffective at ensuring that the offender doesn’t repeat his mistake. This is the \nmost common form of punishment in most Laws of Ascension games. \nBranding \nMore serious crimes may get an offender branded, permanently marked by \nmagic for all to see. Branded mages lose all Reputation Traits, they are \nremoved from any leadership position they might have held, and they can be \nbanished from the area. Some may even be declared Errants by their Tradition \nif the crime is serious enough. \nIn addition, they are two Traits down on all Social Challenges with mages \nwho know their status (which is usually obvious, either to mundane sight or Prim \nmagic). Breaking solemn oaths, leaking secrets intentionally (as long as no deaths \narose from them), attacking another mage without provocation, wantonly killing \none abusing Sleepers, destroying a Wonder or committing other clearly inten- \ntional acts that represent a serious disregard for the lives and trust of other mages \nare all potentially worthy of branding. Brands cannot be removed without a great \namount of effort, and word of the offender’s deeds usually travels quickly enough \nto make removal of the actual mark a moot point anyway. This punishment should \nbe rather infrequent in most games, since it usually means that a character must \ndepart the chronicle. When it is necessary, the Storyteller should ensure that it is \nenforced, or the attitude toward Tradition justice will quickly become too relaxed. \nDeath \nMages who commit depraved acts such as rape or kidnapping, who betray a \nNode or Chantry to enemy forces, who spy on and/ or betray fellow Tradition mages \nfor any reason, or whose deliberate actions of any kind bring death or serious injury \nto other mages are usually sentenced to death. These kinds of crimes stain souls, \nspread needless misery and set back the efforts at Ascension that lie at the heart of , \nallTraditionactivities, and that simply cannot be tolerated. Even if themagedidnot ! , \nspecifically intend to end someone’s life (say, he leaked secrets to someone who later \nutilized that knowledge to kill another mage), he may still be sentenced to death, \nsince he knew that the original act was wrong and went ahead with it anyway. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe penalty of death is still not a common sentence, but most mages aren’t \nin the least bit squeamish about enforcing it when it’s called for. Many still \nconsider themselves at war, after all, and one cannot afford to be undermined from \nwithin during a war. Obviously, both death and Gilgul should never be used lightly \nin a chronicle, since they put an end to a character once and for all. Storytellers \nshould make sure that these punishments are not applied inappropriately. \nGilgul \nMages who commit the most irredeemably foul, vile, and unspeakable acts \nof murder, betrayal and corruption are sentenced to Gilgul- the destruction of \nthe Avatar itself. This punishment prevents the mage from being reincarnated \nand destroys any magical talent the subject might have, so it is performed only \nwhen it is determined that there’s absolutely no chance to redeem a particular \nmage, in this lifetime or any other. Most of the time, such an immense \npronouncement is reserved for the Nephandi, since their blasphemous ways \nleave an indelible taint on the souls they touch. Unfortunately, even untainted \nmages are capable of performing hideous acts without any outside help at all. \nNaturally, no mage will submit willingly to such a punishment, so offenders \nare usually restrained physically and magically before the sentence is carried out. \nOnce the ritual is completed, the accused is either released (often after being \nmind-wiped as well) or executed, depending again on the overall severity of his \ncrimes. Some criminals are deemed too dangerous to live, even after such a \nterrible punishment, while others are let free, to live out the rest of their lives \nas a broken shell. It’s anybody’s guess as to which fate is worse. \nTHE \nS P I ~  \nWCBRLDS \nA noted Master of the Spirit Sphere once said: “Taking the first step beyond is \nalwaysthehardest. After that, it’s justaquestionofwhere youwanttogo.”Indeed,new \nmages often wonder exactly how vast the cosmos must be after getting just a glimpse \nof the worlds that have opened up to them. Where do ow dreams come fim? \nThey ask. \nWheredotheygo? whathappensw~we~?Isthereanendouttheresomewhere, \napoint \nwhich even we can’t go past? Where do aU these spirits come from, anyway? \nWhile the answers to those and countless other such questions encompass an \nincredible amount of information, mages have come up with a few quick ways to \nexplain the various levels of reality. In actuality, the spirit worlds are not nearly so \nneatly divided or explored as these terms might suggest. The spirit worlds, also \nknown as the Umbra, are forever in flux, which confounds even the best efforts to \nmap them in the conventional sense. These terms still serve as a general reference \nso that different mages can understand each other and what the other is referring \nto. Take this advice and information to heart, but take it with agrainof salt as well. \nIn games with a preponderance of spirits and Umbral travel, you may want to \nassign a Spirit Keeper. The role of Spirit Keeper is a special Narrator position \ndesigned specifically to track the Gauntlet ratings, maintain records of spirits, \ncheck out rules for rote Effects in the Umbra and so on. The Spirit Keeper \nessentially functions as a special Storyteller to handle all things spirit-related. \nKeep handy a folder of information about the local spirit world, important Umbral \nTHE \nS P I ~  \nKEPER \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nRealms and some common spirits that mages might meet. The Spirit Keeper can \nrun plots and resolve conflicts based on this information, thereby easing the \nStoryteller’s load and providing a deeper knowledge of the subject matter. \n~ A G I C  \nIN THE U ~ B R A  \nAs a general rule of thumb, most magic isn’t vulgar in the Umbra because \nreality is more flexible there. Certain Effects are still always vulgar, however, no \nmatter where you go. Some of those Effects include performing Gilgul, healing \naggravated wounds or various permanent Effects such as body alteration or \ncreating a Realm. The Storyteller is the final arbiter ofwhat is or isn’t vulgar in the \nUmbra. He and the Spirit Keeper should take care that players with access to the \nspirit world respect its hazards, rather than simply using it as a cheap way of casting \npowerful magic without repercussions. Note also that even if a mage casts a vulgar \nEffect in the Umbra to avoid the Paradox, sending it into the real world may still \nbe Paradoxical. Doing so may also cause the Effect to erode due to Unbelief. \nIt should also be noted that different levels of the Umbra have their own house \nrules as the mage travels farther from Earth. For example, Entropy Effects are never \nvulgar in the decaying Dark Umbra, but creating some form of pure, untainted \nmatter would be incredibly vulgar there, since it goes against the Underworld’s \nparadigm. Mages should take care to mind their surroundings, especially when \npaying a house call on a particularly powerful or nasty spirit, lest they receive an \nunpleasant surprise from Paradox when they try to cast powerful magical Effects. If \npossible, the Storyteller and Spirit Keeper should decide what types of Effects are \nvulgar within a given Realm in advance so as to maintain consistency. \nTHE TELLURIAN \nThe Tellurian is what would be more conventionally known as the universe. \nAnything that can be dreamed of or described has the potential to exist, and it \nquite possibly does already exist somewhere in the Tellurian, even if we haven’t \nfound it yet. Everything is part of the Tellurian in one way or another. \nTHE TAPESTRY \nDespite what mages like to say, even they can’t conceive of the Tellurian in its \npurest state. There’s simply too much for even them to process effectively. Therefore, \nmages use the common metaphor of the Tapestry to represent reality. Every possibility \nor dream is a thread that is woven into the skein of reality. Mages have the talent to \nre-weave the threads as they desire, and thus to shape possibilities to their own ends. \nOf course, yanking on the threads of reality is dangerous. Too much stress on a \nparticular thread will snap it, and an untrained mage might get tangled up in a snarl. \nThat’s a cute way of explaining what happens when a mage suffers a Paradox Backlash, \nbut it also serves to teach an important lesson. Care must be taken not to alter the :‘ \nTapestry too much at once, or else.. . well, no one really knows, but it can’t be good. \nIn fact, it might just end reality as we know it. Mages can’t simply pull out the heavy- \nduty Effects and slug it out with the Technocracy. Not only would Paradox eat \neveryone for lunch, but the damage to the Tapestry would most likely be irrevocable. \nThe first obstacle any mage must overcome is the Gauntlet, the metaphysi- \ncal barrier that separates Earth from the spirit realms. In recent years, the \nGauntlet has thickened as static reality cools and Sleepers reject the spiritual \nINT@ THE ST@Rm \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncan'torwon'tcross theGauntlet, due to thedebilitatingeffectsoftheA \nStorm.

Now, however, it exacts a painful toll from \nSpirit scholars point to aphenomenon known as the Avatar Storm as the source \nof this new problem, although they are currently at a loss at how the damage might \nbe repaired. Supposedly, the Avatar Storm is mix of a tremendous maelstrom of souls \n~ \nin the Dark Umbra, and the aftermath of the recent destruction of an incredibly \npowerful being by the Technocracy. The resulting clash of forces created a backlash \nthat at once thickened the Gauntlet and added a layer of Avatar shards on top of it, \nmaking travel and even communication across it a hazardous process for the unwary. \nAs of the present, there's no telling when or if the Storm will subside, but given \nreality's current trend toward stasis, such a prospect seems unfortunately distant. \nRealms, and the magic unleashed here would have even more dire repercussions \n, \non the Tapestry than they already do. \n.'# \nAside from taking damage from the Avatar Storm, a mage must fight to \n[ - penetrate the Gauntlet itself. In places of magic and mystery, the Gauntlet is \nI \noften low. Powerful Nodes, mystic caves and the like have passages that lie \n: \nclose to the spirit world.

Instead of challenging \nthe Gauntlet directly, the mage creates a usual Spirit magic Effect, and the \nstrength of the Gauntlet affects the ease of the spell. For each point that the \nGauntlet is lower than five, the mage gains a one-Trait bonus on the test to \nbreach the Gauntlet (from either side). For each point that the Gauntlet is \nabove six, a mage suffers a one-Trait penalty instead. \nPENU~-I-IBRA \nCrossing the Gauntlet lands the mage in the Penumbra, the world that \nexists just beyond perception but always rings true in the heart. The Penumbra \nis a reflection of the Earth, so many of the same landmarks and other features are \nstill there. However, while the mundane world shows how things appear, the \nPenumbra focuses emotional resonance and shows how things really are. A \ngarbage dump on Earth appears as a seething heap of corruption in the \nPenumbra. A playground looks like a swirl of laughter and bright, playful colors. \nDeep woods become even more looming and mysterious. Likewise, a particularly \nsneaky person might take on slightly weasel- or snake-like features, while a pure \nsoul glows with a faint inner light. \nThings with particularly strong emotional resonance sometimes even survive \nin the Penumbra beyond the destruction of their mundane form. For example, a \nhouse that served as a powerful site of dark magic might still sit brooding on the \nhillside beyond the Gauntlet, even though it's no more than a crumbling \nfoundation in the normal world. Lastly, spirits of all kinds frequently pass through \nthe Penumbra on their way to other destinations, so a polite and observant mage \ncan gather much information if she knows where to look and whom to ask. \nBe warned, however, that the shapechangers are known to travel the \nPenumbra often as well, and they do not take kindly to outsiders. \nTHE \nNEAR U ~ B R A  \nCountless Realms wait one step beyond the Penumbra, if a mage is wise and \nbrave enough to make the journey. A brief description of each of the most \nimportant areas follows. \nMages filled with intellectual curiosity sometimes travel to the Astral \nUmbra, or the world of ideas. Like the Penumbra, it is a reflection of the world, \nbut it emphasizes and amplifies rationality instead of emotion, drawing the \nabstract concepts and meanings out of things. Needless to say, many of the things \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\none might find here are highly symbolic, wrapped in layers of enigma and \nmetaphors. Spiritual aspirants had best be ready to do some serious studying \nbefore they uncover the truths they seek. Theoretically, however, the answer to \nany question in the universe can be found here, so many mages attempt to \njourney here at one point or another. \nDecaying, disturbing and just generally depressing, the Dark Umbra is \nwhere the spirits of the dead wind up. It too is a reflection of the normal world, \nbut it is an ashen, crumbling one, filled with rotting cities and infested with \nunhappy souls unable to move on to their ultimate reward. Mages who travel \nhere had best be careful, for the Restless Dead envy the vitality of visitors, and \nthey do their best to destroy it. \nDaydreams, fantasies and fears all come from somewhere as well, and mages \nusually call that place the Dream Lands. These lands are a reflection of Earth as \nwell, but it is one seen through the twin lenses of whimsy and nightmare. \nFantastic castles rise out of the suburban sprawl, unicorns saunter down city \nstreets, and unspeakable monsters wait to ambush the unwary. This Realm is the \nhome of the faeries, and they guard it jealously. Mages typically cannot enter the \nDream Lands unless they are faerie kin, they are accompanied by one of the Fair \nFolk, or they are powerful and foolish enough to barge in without an invitation. \nOf course, not everything is a reflection of the mundane world. Sometimes \nreality collects in strange pocket Realms, or a powerful mage takes a portion of \nthe Umbra and shapes it to her own particular desires. These places reflect the \nwishes of their creators, so the rules of reality are different there. \nTHE ‘EDGE a= \n&ALITY \nTHE \nHCBRIZCBN \nIf the Near Umbra represents everything that can be imagined, the Horizon \nis the limit of that imagination and the cutting edge of reality. Mages have \nsculpted custom Realms out there, where their own visions of reality are \ndominant and their own magic is always coincidental. Horizon used to be the \nmajor battleground of the Ascension War, and Archmages threw tremendous \namounts of magic at each other in a struggle for dominance. \nSince the Gauntlet strengthened, however, the Horizon has largely been \ncut off from Earth and robbed of much of its importance. Not only does this rift \nmake communication with the old Masters difficult, it has also cut down on the \nQuintessence flow from Earth. That being the case, many Horizon Realms are \nstarting to unravel since their owners are unable to supply the necessary energy \nAt this rate, it may not be long before the Horizon comes crashing down, \n’ \n+ \nto keep them alive. \n3 \nI and who knows what effects that might have.. .? \n~VERTHE ‘EDGE \nTHE DEP UmBRA \n- \nIt’s hard to say what lies beyond the limits of human imagination, because \nonly the most powerful or insane mages have traveled there. Only Masters and \nOracles have much of a chance of surviving out there, and even they have \ntrouble dealing with some of the forces at work beyond the Horizon. At \npresent, nobody can say with any certainty what might lie beyond. One might \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nfind alternate Earths, a world of intelligent crystals, a universe ruled by giant \nbadgers or even stranger things. \nIt’s also entirely possible - \nas some mages have suggested - \nthat what’s out \nthere is something Man Was Not Meant to Know. With the Horizon crumbling \nand reality stagnating, however, this speculation may become more than an \nacademic exercise all too soon. \nTHE \nUITIBRA \nIN PLAY \nHaving looked at the risks that even a simple crossing of the Gauntlet \nentails, many mages (and more than a few Storytellers) may ask themselves: \nWhy bother? After all, the Ascension War is over and the real action’s here on \nearth, right? Well, yes and no. The following are some quick hints and potential \nstory hooks for Storytellers who wish to incorporate the Umbra into their games: \nCuriosity: If mages were the stayat-home types, they’d still be Sleeping. \nAcquisition and use of the Spirit Sphere, discovery of a powerful gateway, the \nsearch for answers to a difficult problem or even just a need to know what lurks \nunder the surface of reality can all spark Umbral stories. A great deal of \ninformation exists in the Umbra that can’t be gained anywhere else, not to \nmention an endless source of mysteries for interested players. \nParadigm: Another obvious motivating factor for the use of the Umbra in \nplay is that many mages’ paradigms incorporate some of it on aregular basis. Most \nDreamspeakers communicate with spirits regularly, and they may travel to the \nhomes of their ethereal cousins to beg aid, do battle or return favors. Hermetic \nwizards frequently invoke spirits in all kinds of rotes, and they may travel to the \nOtherworlds for tutelage or out of obligation. More than a few Hollow Ones \nbegin their careers with a Ouija board, and they may be tempted by wraithly \ncontacts into glimpsing the afterlife firsthand. (Not that this idea is a particu- \nlarly good one, but most Hollowers have no idea of the real risks.) Don’t let one \nmage’s paradigm overshadow the rest of the game, though. Involving the Umbra \nin every story when only one or two mages are capable there gets boring fast. Use \nthe Umbra as a rich, intriguing side-setting for those skilled in its ways. \nDiplomacy: Perhaps one or more of the mages are ambassadors to the local \nspirit courts. Some Celestial Chorus members take the “emissaries of Heaven” \nrole seriously, after all, and many Euthanatos Chantries offer aid and recom- \npense to the Restless Dead so as to avoid incurring their wrath during the course \nof their duties. A mage with faerie blood might be called upon to make amends \nfor a unwitting slight against the Fair Folk, while a mage with shapechanger kin \nmight seek to make peace between his cabal and the local werewolves. The mage \nmight even be an envoy to or from Horizon, trying re-establish communication \nand guidance between the two worlds. \nNecessity: The Mother of All Plot Hooks, necessity can drag the characters \ninto Umbral stories whether they’re ready or not. Just make sure that the players \ndon’t feel like you’re jerking them around. Perhaps a Nephandus or Marauder \narrives from beyond the Gauntlet and begins wrecking havoc, and the mages \nmust follow their fleeing enemy to ensure that he’s been finished off. A love- \nstruck faerie might steal away a character’s friend or lover, beginning a classic \nrescue tale. An Umbral breach might open up during a particularly vicious \nmagical duel, sucking unlucky characters into the Otherworlds. The characters \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmight even be cornered by some powerful foe who leaves them with no choice \nbut to flee into the Umbra and take their chances there. Countless other \nscenarios can achieve the same result, but the ultimate goal remains the same: \nThe mages have no choice but to suck it up and deal with the Umbra - \nnow! \nSPIrnS \nSpirits are puzzling entities that exist in the Umbra as manifestations of \nvarious principles, forces or ideas. Sometimes they seem almost human, while \nthey elude any sort of coherent classification at others. All that mages can say \nwith certainty is that many, many types of spirits are out there, and that they \nhave a multitude of potential powers. Therefore, spirits can be potent allies if a \nmage is properly respectful. \nSpirits rarely appear in the material world - \nthe Gauntlet makes doing so \nvery difficult. However, they do find mages (and other living creatures that can \ninteract with them) extremely interesting. As such, any mage who travels into \nthe Umbra is likely to run into a spirit at some point. \nSPIRIT \nCREATICBN \nWhile some mages try to classify spirits, it’s difficult to pigeonhole them all. \nSpirits seem to have their own hierarchy, although not all spirits fit into it. \nIn game terms, a spirit may rank anywhere from a minor entity to a godlike \nbeing, and it’s up to the Spirit Keeper to assign it powers and traits as appropriate. \nA minor spirit may be little better than an animal with three or four Traits in \neach Attribute category, a Trait of Quintessence and one Initiate-level power. \nA divine entity, on the other hand, may have 20 or more Traits in each \nAttribute, a similar amount of Quintessence and a full range of Disciple-, Adept- \nand Master-level powers. The spirit’s exact powers and capabilities depend upon \nthe needs of the story, though. There’s no formula to catch all spirits, and a mage \ncan’t simply look at a spirit and say, “Oh, that spirit has only two powers and six \npoints of Quintessence.” Spirits are mysterious entities and potential adversaries \nor allies, not collections of numbers. \nSPIRIT \nTRAITS \nSpirits don’t have normal Traits, unless they create or possess a material body. \nA spirit uses its Rage (instead of Physical Traits) to attack, its Gnosis instead of \nMental or Social Traits, and its Charms toperform magical (Paradox-free) effects. \nA spirit also typically has a pool of Power to enhance its Charms and fuel its \nexistence. Such Power is inherent to the spirit, and it cannot be stolen from it. \nSpirits often have a few Abilities, and they may even have some Negative \nTraits, as appropriate to their purpose. \nSAl-I-IPLE SPIrnS \nThe two sample spirits here simply provide some ideas on what spirits might \nbe able to do in your games. \n~\nI\nN\n~\nR\n \nSPIRIT \nw FIN \nThe minor spirit of fire appears as a small, flickering flame in various \nshades of red, yellow, orange and blue. It has only limited awareness, since it \nexists simply to burn. While it’s too small to be very threatening to most \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncreatures, it can set objects alight in the Umbra (or in the physical world if \nsomeone brings it across the Gauntlet with Spirit magic), and it can act as a sort \nof guiding light for a mage in the Penumbra. \nPower: 5 \nCharms: Airt Sense: The spirit of fire can sense Umbral pathways, and it can \nRage: 3 \nGnosis: 2 \nAbilities: Brawl, Cosmology, Dodge \nTypical of the ranks of lesser demons, the demon of war is a spirit hungry \nfor violence and conflict.

The enjoyment of a superlative story, \nthe satisfaction of a fantasy made manifest and the gratitude of the many players \nwho participate make all the effort worthwhile. If you're willing to take on the \nburdens of storytelling, read on and learn from the advice and help compiled \nhere. Laws of Ascension especially requires a great deal of set-up work, so read \nthrough all of this chapter and prepare appropriately. \nThe first watchword for a Laws of Ascension Storyteller is preparation. A lot \ncan go awry in the course of a reality-bending, Realm-hopping story, and it's the \nStoryteller's job to head off problems and keep the game moving. With that in \nmind, be sure to not only heed the advice of this chapter, but also to take a few notes \non how these Storytelling elements can apply to your games specifically. \nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty of making stories, though, let's get one \nthing out of the way: \nThe purpose of the game is to have fun. \nYouremember that rule from waaay back in the beginning, right? Ifpeople aren't \nhaving fun, something's wrong. If a rule impedes your game, it needs to change or \ndisappear. TheStoryteller'sultimateresponsibilityistoensurethateveryonehasagood \ntime, so you must learn to throw out or change anything that gets in the way. You may \nfind yourself tweakiig rules, bending character concepts and tossing out story ideas to \ndoso-nothingissacredwhenit comesdown towhetherornot thegame isenjoyable. \nIf arule makes the game less fun, change it. It doesn't matter that the Master \nlevel of the Sphere of Cheese allows one player to win the game and ruin \neverything for everyone else. That player needs to fit the game's overall needs. \nIf a character concept skews the game, it's time to change it. Your player may \nwant to play a combat munchkin who revels in the bloodshed of other players' \ncharacters, but when that character causes hard feelings or starts killing off too \nmany characters for people to have fun, it's time to remove the character from \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthat role or from the game. If your players don’t enjoy your story line, toss it. \nWhile the Storyteller does have the power to ram a given story down the players’ \nthroats, there’s little point in doing so if everyone hates it in the first place. \nAlways keep this mantra in mind when you craft stories. You’ll save yourself \nand your players a lot of grief when you approach your craft with the goal of \nmaking things fun foremost in your mind. \nTHE \nPNCE w F\n~\nE\n \nBuilding stories doesn’t come cheaply. Sometimes the muse just refuses to \nstrike. Other times, the demands of participants fray your nerves. Storytelling \nisn’t a job for the faint of heart. It takes up a lot of time and effort. When you’re \nrunning an entire chronicle, you don’t just do so during the actual games. \nInLaws of Ascension, you must be especially prepared to deal with constant \ndemands. During play, you are responsible for arbitrating disputes, updating \nrecords, making rules and judgment calls on the fly, assigning Narrators, approving \ncharacter concepts, introducing or advancing plots and ensuring that everyone \nhas fun. The Storyteller rarely has time to indulge personally in the game. The \nStoryteller’s role is that of an overseer more than a direct participant. \nThe Storyteller’s job doesn’t end once he is out of play, though. A Storyteller \nneeds to set up locations for play, arrange to take them down, update character records, \ndeal with problems that came up during play, approve new rules, brainstorm plots and \nkeep a finger on the pulse of the game to find out what’s going well and what could go \nwrong. These duties can and often do intrude on your free time. You’ll find players \nasking questions about the game while they’re visiting, and ideas for the game will \nsuddenly pop into your head in the middle of work or other activities. You’ll find it best \nto set aside a little time between games, because the Storytelling duties will inevitably \ndemandattentionandyou’llneedtousethattimeifyouwantthegames \ntogosmoothly. \nStorytelling is not all bad, but it certainly requires a lot of work, and it can get out \nofhand. When your players keep trying to bring bizarre ideas f0r“winning” to the table, \nwhen your Narrators can’t agree and mive at loggerheads over a ruling and when the \ncomputation of longrunning between-game material or plots takes up a few more \nhours than you’ve planned, you’ll realize just how much a Storyteller is responsible for. \nGiven some time and experience, you’ll find the balance of storytelling duties \nthat suits you. Figure out how much effort you need to set up your game and take pains \nto keep those responsibilities organized, and you can minimize the impact of the \ninevitable random events that crop up and try to throw your plans into disarray. \nOnce you hit this groove, you’ll find out why storytelling is so rewarding. You’re \nliterally responsible for an entire imaginary world, and all of your players will come \nto rely on you to define it. Only the Storyteller watches with omniscience as plots \nunfold and take shape. You have the opportunity to not only guide the direction of \nthe tale, but to see every part of the grandiose tapestry that you weave. When all is \nsaid and done, you get to relish the enjoyment of every other participant. \n, - \nTWLS w THE TRAI~E \nA prepared Storyteller keeps his duties as organized as possible. The more \nprepared you are ahead of time, the less likely you are to be laid low by some \nunexpected calamity. As a recommendation, you’ll probably want to prepare the \nfollowing items ahead of time: \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nA complete folder of players’ characters. The players will inevitably need \ncopies of their character records, and you’ll want to be able to reference them \nbetween games. If you don’t have them stored on a computer file, keep your own \nfolder of photocopies in addition to the sheets the players use during the game. \nA notebook of plots. Keep notes on who’s doing what to whom, what \ngroups and cabals are active in what areas and where you see the story going. Jot \ndown potential ideas so that you can move a plot in whatever direction seems \nmost entertaining instead of railroading the story. Plus, if you’re suddenly struck \nwith inspiration, you can write down a new idea here and refer Narrators to it \n(or give them copies) so that they know what you’re thinking. \nItem cards. Keep a small box full of index cards with item names and stats on \nthem, listed one item (knife) or group of similar items (handful of coins) to a card. \nJot down a quick description of what the item looks like, what Traits it has and what \ngame effects it produces, then sign the card. That way, those who want to use an item \nneed the appropriate card. And since the card has your signature (or some other \ndistinctive mark), it won’t be as easy to forge. If you really want to go all the way, you \ncan print up the cards on a computer, then laminate them so that they’ll be tough \nand reusable instead of getting crumpled up in someone’s pocket. \nNametags. Although you don’t need nametags for every player, you will \nprobably want to pass out nametags to differentiate Narrators and to indicate certain \npossessions that acharacter is carrying or wearing. For instance, if someone’s wearing \nbody armor, then not only do you want the player to have an item card for it, you \nwant the player to wear that card somewhere easily visible. A nametag holder makes \na perfect place to hold an item card of this sort. The same is true if, say, a person has \na strange physical feature or he is under a visible magical Effect. \nEffect cards. Instead of stopping the game to look up how each rote works, \ngive the players cards that describe their rotes. Making up all the Effect cards in \nadvance is time-consuming, but it saves you effort later during the game, since \nyou can just ask a player to pull out the card for his rote when he casts an Effect. \nPlus, you know that if a player doesn’t have a given card for an Effect he wants \nto create, then he’s fast-casting a rote he doesn’t know, or he’s out of luck. \nParadox cards. Depending upon how you decide to handle Paradox, you may \nor may not use Paradox cards. If you do, make them up ahead of time so that you don’t \nhave to try to approve Paradox effects in the middle of play. Plus, these cards help \nyou assign appropriate Paradox effects fairly. You can pass the cards out randomly to \nthe players (as per the Paradox card system in Chapter Four), or you can just have \na Paradox Judge deal with them specifically (as described later in this chapter). \nEvent synopsis sheet. After each game event, you will want to make up \nf a little note sheet of what happened, what’s important to know and what’s going \nI on. You will especially want to do so in games with a mobile venue. That is, if \nyour game is supposedly taking place in Paris, France while you’re really in \nt \nPonca, Nebraska, you’ll want to make anote of that fact on your event sheet. You \nI cannote rule updates or changes and big public events on the sheet, so that each \n1 : - player can pick up a copy at the start of play and know immediately the sorts of \nI \nA venue style sheet. Most players agree that everyone should follow a \n.: coherent set of pre-arranged rules, so why should the story be any different? \nEssentially, a venue style sheet describes the basic premise of the game and \na \nthings that his character would reasonably be aware of. \n’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncovers its preferred themes and story types. By consulting this sheet, new players \nand old alike can keep what the game’s trying to accomplish in mind. If someone \nstarts to behave in a way that detracts from the game, you can point out on the \nvenue style sheet that such behavior isn’t what you’re trying to accomplish. \nFor instance, if you really want a political game with limited physical \ncombat, you can make anote to that effect on the venue style sheet. Then when \nsomeone makes a combat-oriented character, you just point out that that type \nof character is not in keeping with the style of game that you’re trying to play. \nThe venue style sheet covers important bits of setting and background for the \ngame, as well as any pertinent rules modifications. In effect, you hand out this \ncouple of pages to every player so that they know exactly how your game works. \nBUILDING \nSTWUES \nSo you have your notebook and your pen and your copy of Laws of Ascension. \nAll ready to play? Not quite. Great stories rarely pop fully formed out of thin air. \nMaking up a story requires you to simmer some thoughts and mix some ideas, then \nbake them with a bit of effort and hope for the best. It’s a rather haphazard process, \nbut dealing with the unforeseen elements that emerge is part of the fun. \nEvery Storyteller has his own style of running a game, so you’ll need to find \nout how you’re most comfortable. Some Storytellers rush from place to place and \nhandle every arbitration, giving the players constant input. Others like to step \nback and watch the game flow on its own, while players guide most of the action \nthemselves. No one style is more or less valid than any other. As long as you come \nto the table offering the players a chance to experience something entertaining, \npeople will run with your ideas and have a good time. \nLIVPACTIBN \nVEBUS TABLETBP \nSTBRYTELLING \nExperienced tabletop Storytellers take heed - \nrunning a live-action game \nisn’t just an extension of the tabletop game. Although certain thematic elements \nremain similar, such as the need for plots and Storyteller moderation, the scales \nare totally different. A Storyteller for a live-action game undertakes a large-scale \neffort to fulfill many players’ expectations, instead of running events around a \nsingle table. The difference in scale has some important consequences: \nIn live-action games, you don’t have unlimited oversight. At a tabletop game, \nyou get to see everything that happens and you know what every player’s character is \ndoing. In live-action games, players’ characters may wander around and plot secretly, \nand you won’t be involved. As a result, you’ll have to make judgment calls based on \nincomplete or inaccurate information sometimes. Perhaps a player is cheating, but you \ncan’t verify it because you weren’t there, or maybe some characters traded dormation \nwhile you weren’t present and the final tally of who knows what will surprise you. You \ncan usually take these matters on trust, but it’s often best to err on the side of caution. \nYou may not have the luxury of interacting personally with everyone. A \ntabletop game allows everyone to sit down as friends and build characters that \nare designed to work together (or at least not to kill each other right off the bat). \nIn a live-action game with dozens or hundreds of players, you may have players \nyou know only vaguely, players who don’t get along and characters who are \ndesigned to arrive at loggerheads. \nExpect a level of player friction at some point, because it happens when you \nget so many personalities together at once. When it does happen, you must put \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nup the appearance of being fair and even-handed so that nobody feels like \nsomeone else is treated preferentially, and you must be a diplomat and discipli- \nnarian in addition to all of your other roles. You must exercise the fact that your \nauthority is absolute for your game. You have the right to eject a problem player \nand make calls based on personal judgment because you’re trying to build a game \nfairly for everyone to have fun, not a story centered around one hero. \nSpeaking of centric games, the characters find themselves in the middle \nof events in tabletop play, and they face down the Storyteller’s antagonists. In \nlive-action games, the enemies may often be other players’ characters, and no \nplayer’s character is guaranteed a plot’s spotlight. Inevitably, you’ll have to \nsoothe hard feelings between players who come into conflict, and you’ll need to \nkeep an eye out for the unfortunates who become bored or get run roughshod \nover by more talkative or aggressive players. If you’re fortunate, you’ll recruit \nsome players to be Narrators and play the main antagonists. For some players, \nthough there’s no satisfaction like beating down another player’s character or \nsolving a juicy plot in order to reap the rewards themselves. \nA subtler level of problem lies in character balance. For a tabletop group of a \nhalf-dozen people, you can usually introduce new characters with a minimum of fuss \nand tweak their starting power levels to fit them into the game. In a large, long-running \nlive-action game, you’ll have some powerful characters and some who have just been \ncreated, and you’ll want to make sure that everyone starts off on an even keel. \nUnfortunately, you’ll run into situations where old-characters dominate \nthe game and new players feel that they can’t participate or accomplish anything \nmeaningful. A couple of solutions to this problem exist, althoughnone are really \neasy to swallow. First, you can slow long-term characters’ rate of advancement. \n! If, for instance, you charge an extra Experience Trait for every advancement the \nplayer makes after his character has earned his first 25 or 50 Traits, you’ll subtly \nslow older characters’ improvement. You can stack this modifier if necessary to \nslow down really old characters even more, and to prevent your group from \nhaving one multi-Sphere Master running around blasting everything. \nSecond, you can “cap out” or retire old and powerful characters. You do so \nby halting character advancement at 100 Experience Traits or requiring char- \nacters to go out of play when they reach this level of experience. This \nrequirement leaves a sour taste in many players’ mouths, though, because it \nundercuts their sense of accomplishment. \nThird, you can intervene with the game’s natural flow in order to promote \noverall fun. You can go to the powerful characters’ players beforehand and say, \n“Hey, guys, I’d like you to keep your hands off this one plot. It’s for the new people.” \n: Give them something big to face down with all their Traits while leaving the new \ncharacters a few minor ordeals that would be a snap for the old-timers. \n, \nKe ST~RY \nINGREDIENTS \nI \nNow that you know a few things to watch out for, you’re ready to drop \ntogether some ingredients and mix your own story. When you put some \ningredients into play, players will take them and make their own little creations, \nadding to the overall experience. Try a few different mixes. Very few story ideas \n’ \nare exclusive. You can have many story elements or few, and you can mix and \nt ’ match to your heart’s content. \nI * €  , I  \n1 = 1 .  \nI *  \nI \n8 robert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nT H E ~ E  \nThe theme is the organizing principle of your story. It’s the unifyingone- or two- \nword description ofwhat your story is about on its most basic level. It is the question \nthat your story answers as it plays out, and it’s the means by which you convey the \ntale’s ideas and messages. You’ll need a theme if you want to create a story with a \ncoherent direction and recognizable elements instead of just a mish-mash of ideas. \nThe theme is the foundation of all the other parts of the story, and it influences \nthe plot, mood and setting. Each choice you make in building your story helps \naccentuate your hidden theme, and the theme becomes clear through the explora- \ntionofcommonelements ineachpartofthe story. The theme isnot terribly complex \nin and of itself, though. Rather, it’s a basic element that guides your thought on plots \nand places that can be tied together to share one deeper meaning. \nYour Laws of Ascension games may use any combination of the following themes: \nChange - \nIs change inevitable, or do some things remain eternal? How do \npeople adapt to uncontrolled or unwanted change? Is it better to enforce change \nfrom without or to let it spring from within? \nEnlightenment - \nWhat steps and paths lead to true enlightenment? What \nis enlightenment, anyway? Is enlightenment exclusive of material effort, or does \nit acknowledge worldliness? Is it even a worthwhile goal at all? \nHope - \nDoes hope even exist in the World of Darkness? Who and what can \nbring hope? Is hope itself just a sham designed to lead on the gullible, or can there \nreally be something better? What hopes and dreams most drive humanity to excel? \nMorality - \nWho or what determines morality? Who are the keepers of \nmorals and ethics? Are these social constructs even necessary? What morals (if \nany) transcend individuals, cities, nations, worlds? \nOrder -Do \npeople function better in an orderly fashion, or do the \nconstraints of order take away too much? Is there an order to the universe at all? \nWho are the keepers of order, and who decides what’s conducive to order? \nExploration-What \nfrontiers remain today? Are there limits and places to which \npeople shouldn’t go? How far will people go in search of something new, different or \nbetter? Does exploration of the external have less merit than internal exploration? Is \nit better to explore old ways in a new context or to explore new ways entirely? \nHubris - \nDo mages go too far when they bend reality? Are there really \nthings that humans shouldn’t do?Railing against the gods (and Paradox) is risky, \nbut is it too much? Even so, how much should humans be content with? Is there \nno choice but to reach for the heavens? \nI \n~ \nlTIW3D \nYour story’s mood carries emotional undertones. When your players step \ninto the game, they should feel that mood through the props, settings and events \nthat you choose. Just like a movie that spawns powerful emotions, your story’s \nmood causes the players to feel specific things. Again, mood is a subtle, hidden \nelement that’s best described through the game’s events instead of spoken aloud. \nLet the mood shine through in the feelings the story evokes. \nA story’s mood may change with the pace of the tale or remain fairly \n1 \nconstant. Typically, it’s a short description of emotion. Your story might be ’ 1;‘ \ndespairing and sad, or feverish and furious. Moods aren’t always mutually \nexclusive, but some moods do contrast. Often, it’s best to focus on one or two \nI 6’;; \n.Il‘ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmoods at a time, just to keep them strong. Too many swings of emotion cause \nthe mood to become diluted. \nSome moods you can play with include, but are not limited to: \nSadness - \nPerhaps your game focuses on loss, dashed hope or ennui. The \ncharacters face the depths of despair, in how much magic has left the world and \nin the inevitable trials of humanity. \nActive -The chronicle is frenetic. Things are always happening, the world \nis moving forward, and characters must be fast on their feet to keep up. Everyone \nfeels like there’s no time to take a breath, and matters careen forward constantly. \nThis type of game can be exciting or terrifying, but it’s always in motion. \nMystery- With the many trials that mages face, especially given the dearth \nof good teachers and old Masters, many become confused by the diversity of the \nmystical world. The characters don’t know what to expect. Puzzling spirits and \ninsoluble natural phenomena face them. The characters may be certain of their \nowncapabilities, but the world itselfseems too grand to comprehend in its entirety. \nAnger - In an angry world, everyone’s pissed off at something. The \nTraditions are mad at the Technocracy for quashing magic. The Technocrats are \nmad at the Traditions for slowing progress. The masses are mad at everyone for \njerking them around and giving them a mediocre world. Tempers flare easily, \nand everyone has a grudge. Violence seems right around the corner, and tragedy \nresults when tempers erupt. The setting is bright and splashed with red and \nyellow reminders of the fire lurking just beneath. \nPassion - \nMages believe so strongly about things that they literally change \nthe world with those beliefs. Everyone holds something dear, be it a loved one, \na philosophy or a treasured heritage. Play up the conflict of passions. Reason falls \nby the wayside as people follow their hearts. Settings seem romantic or brooding, \ndesigned to evoke deep emotions. \nPLW \nWhile the theme and mood provide underlying foundation for a story, the \nplot is really the story itself. It’s the thread of material and imagination that \nunravels to reveal a long tale. Your plots encompass who’s doing what, where the \nimportant stuff resides and what’s going to happen come hell or high water. In \nshort, it’s the record of events that come together to tell a coherent story. \nYour game needs a couple of g o d  plots to hold it together. On one hand, you \nwant to tell an engrossing story and give the characters a chance to grow over months \nof time, unfolding all their richness of their lives slowly. On the other hand, some \nthings happen so suddenly and twist lives around so profoundly that they can’t last \nmore than an instant. Both are valid and necessary angles of plot. For players who \nlike to puzzle out problems and toy with recurring villains, elements and problems, \nlongrunningplotsfit the bill. Otherplayersfind long-termplotsconfusingorboring. \nFor them you interject the occasional short-term plot that’s designed to keep things \nmoving and to show that sometimes the world upends in fast and strange ways. \nYou can dig up plot ideas just about anywhere. Whatever causes conflict or \ncuriosity is ripe for use in a plot. Take a quaint or interesting story from a novel, a \nmovie, a television show, even a bit of history or current events. Put your own spin \non it and stir it up with a couple of other elements from dissimilar plots. File off the \nserial numbers, plop the characters in as the protagonists (or antagonists), and run. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nRemember that you can leave elements of plots dangling as well. You \nneedn’t specify the outcome of every plot angle exactly. Indeed, you might want \nto see which direction the players head with something and then decide on the \nfly how you want to resolve the plot. Like a murder mystery, there might be many \npossible solutions, only one of which becomes apparent in the end. \nSomesimple ideasforplots (fromwhich youcanspringoffyourownstories) include: \nThe Search for Knowledge - \nYoung up-and-coming mages need to hone \ntheir skills and master the Spheres if they’re to survive and make a change in the \nworld. Therefore, a traveler or recently discovered book or artifact offers the \npromise of knowledge, if only the mages will solve some problem or travel to some \nplace. The mages must exercise their current knowledge in order to reach the next \npinnacle and eventually acquire access to some tutor that imparts new knowledge. \nTheMeetingofMinds-Severalmagescome together to trade wisdomandmake \ndiplomatic overtures. Perhaps a few have access to aNode, and they want to trade that \npower for use of the library another group holds. Maybe some mages need to end \nhostilities, or resolve a conflict over influence on some part of the city. Perhaps the \nmages need to bring new apprentices up to speed and establish a united front against \nopposition. Regardless, it’s a job for wits, social skills and political maneuvering. \nAscension War - \nAlthough most mages recognize that opening the entire \nworld to magic all at once is probably futile, wars over ideology remain. Some \nTechnocrats continue to hunt mages, while some mages believe that the \nSleepers can be freed to make their own destiny only if the Technocrats are \noverthrown. Marauders follow their own twisted agendas, and they often come \ninto conflict with other mages. And everyone hates the Nephandi. But who’ll \nwin? The characters must marshal resources and find allies if they’re to survive, \nespecially if it’s an unwanted conflict thrust upon them. \nLost and Bygone - \nSome strange phenomenon or creature appears in the \ncity. Although it’s elusive, it holds the promise of some magical power. Perhaps \nit must draw its energy from somewhere, or it’s a sign that an important magical \nevent has occurred. The characters try to track it down and figure out why it \nappeared, how it came to be and perhaps how to turn it to their advantage. \n; - \nSETTING \nWhen you’ve figured out your plot, theme and the like, you can decide on a \nsetting. Your setting is just the backdrop, the locale in which everything happens. \nOften this locale will be pretty mundane. Your local coffee shop or nightclub will do, \nfor instance. However, youcango wild if youhave private access to anarea. Maybeyour ‘ \nplayers are subtle enough to actually play the game in a mall during the day, although \nwe don’t recommend trying it. The local constabulary tends to get nervous when you \ndo “magic” in public. More likely, you have access to a friend’s house or a rented \nbuilding. You can use the setting to showcase the exact elements that you want. \nyou may decide that you want your game (held in a friend’s basement) to actually \ntake place in a great Chantry. Decorate the site with some simple plastic statues \nor books that help to give an ambience of wisdom. Look back at your moods and \nthemes too. For a fastepaced, violent and hectic game, you’ll want to decorate \n5 !h \nwith bright colors and things like statues of gladiators or paintings from wars. A :: \nmore subdued and romantic game calls for soft, warm coloration, dim lighting \n: \nc \nToss in materials that’ll helpget across the feel for your setting. For instance, f \nh \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nand more simple cloths and drapes. The setting itself influences how your players \nfeel, which in turn helps you provide a given theme and mood. \nRemember that your setting isn’t just limited to our modem world and time. \nAlthough many mages recognize the importance of the here-and-now , of having \nto make a difference on Earth and fighting to survive in day-to-day living, quite \na few mages also jaunt off to strange hidden lands or even spirit worlds. Perhaps \nyour game takes place in a realm of fantasy or a spaceship crewed by Sons of \nEther. You can also experiment with different periods of history. You might try \nplaying mages who work with the Cult of Mercury in old Rome (see Dead Magic) \nor Renaissance mages in the ages of discovery and exploration. \nPACING \nOnce a plot comes crashing to a premature conclusion or a group of players \nmanages to sit on a story arc for an entire night and reduce it to boredom, you’ll \nrecognize the value of pacing. On the Storyteller end, your pacing needs to be \nultimately flexible. There’s no way around it. Sometimes players surprise you \nwith an incredible plan that solves your month-long story arc, and sometimes \nthey just miss all the hooks. \nPacing often bows to mood and theme. If you’re running a very action- \noriented game, you will want to pace things quickly. Characters appear, do \nthings and disappear. Events flash-fry, and players must react quickly. In a more \nsedate game, you might leave events dangling for a little while. Give players the \nchance to grab on to something if it interests them, even if it takes a little while \nto notice. Don’t force it, though. If your plot hangs out to dry for three months \nand nobody cares, it may be time to move on. \nAnother important part of pacing is judging your players. For instance, you might \nhave a plot that starts up only when some people use a specific set of investigative skills \nor magics on a game element. If your players are more bang-up types, they may not try \nthe cerebral approach immediately. You’ll need to pace appropriately, leaving enough \ncluesfor them to follow. Ifyouhavevery cautious players, you’llhave tobecarefulabout \npushingthem intoaction, lest they find themselves overwhelmed. Remember, the idea \nt isn’t to have plots that totally stump the players or run them over. It’s to introduce story \nelements that the players can have fun with. \nThe real key to mastering pacing is to become adaptable on the fly. In the \nmiddle of a game, some player will inevitably pull off some magical Effect you \ndidn’t foresee. The answer is not to shoot it down or panic, but to adapt to the \nsituation. Check your cribbed notes on plot (You did write down plot notes, \nright?) and see where you’re planning to go, then make a ruling on the spot. Be \n, prepared to throw out an angle that isn’t working, and realize that sometimes the \n^*’ players will do things out of order like confronting the adversaries before \nI acquiring the Really Big Guns. Be prepared to spin things. In the aforemen- \ntioned case, you might want to fiddle with the adversaries’ Traits, depending on \nwhether you want them to be defeated or just to trounce the players a little. \nIf you find your game lagging, try to pick up the pace. Having players who have \ntoo much to do is usually better than having nothing to do. People come to the game \nto do something, after all. If matters lag, consider tossing in another character, aclue, \n. a new element or anything to keep things moving. You’ll have to work to keep up, \nof course, but you didn’t think Storytelling was entirely easy, did you? \n’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSTCBRY \nCCBNSIIXRATICBNS \nYour story considerations simply offer possible boundaries to the story itself. \nYou can’t encompass everything, so you need to have some limits. The story \nconsiderations basically determine how much wiggle room you’ll give. \nSCALE \nA game might just be a half-dozen friends in one rmm for an evening, or 200 \nconventioneersrunningaroundahotelforthreedaysandnights.Yourgame’sscalecan \nand will change as players come and go, settings expand and your plots demand new \ndirections. That’s okay. Your only real limit is how much you can logistically handle. \nYou can influence your game’s scale actively by doing things like recruiting \nnew players or putting a cap on the number of players you allow in the game. If \nyou don’t want more than, say, 20 players, just stop accepting new characters at \nthat point. Similarly, if you feel that the game hasn’t hit critical mass, send your \nplayers out to find friends and relatives who want to join in. \nScale is important primarily to two things: how much you can handle, and \nhow much your plot can bear. As a Storyteller, you have to arbitrate a load of work \nalready. If you have too many players, your game becomes unmanageable. You’ll \nwant to recruit Narrators from your player base. A good ratio is one Narrator for \nevery five to 10 players. You might even require that every player spend some time \nas a Narrator every few games, just to make sure that you have enough Narrators \nand antagonist characters. On the plot side, your stories may suffer if too many \npeople become involved. Thirty-eight destructive mages converging on one foe \ncan wreck that angle, while too few mages might not have the skills to muster to \nsolve a specific plot. Your plots should to some degree be driven by scale, to make \nsure that you have stories that everyone has a chance to participate in. If you have \nmore people, you’ll want to have more Narrators and more plots, naturally. \nRemember also that it’s generally a bad idea to hang all of a plot on one hook. \nRegardless of the size of your game, you should have multiple threads ofresolution. \nIf you rely on one specific individual to resolve a plot, you may find yourself out \nof luck if the player doesn’t show up or the character disappears. Your scale dictates \nthe flexibility of response your plots require. The more players involved, the more \nyou’ll want to leave options for yourselfso that aplot can be handled in many ways. \nWhile scale relates to the actual size of the physical game, scope is a bit more \nintangible. The scope covers how far the characters can stray. It is essentially, \nthe illusion of free will that you give the players. \nThe players and characters always act under some constraints. Whether he’s ; \nlimited by game rules or the particular plots in motion, a character can do only so \nmuch. However, your decisions of scope can have agreat effect on what a character ‘ - \ncan do with. Will you allow characters to travel anywhere in the world, or do you \ndecide to limit such travel artificially for the sake of the game? Do you intend to \nlimit the powers of magic a bit more? Can your characters actually affect the \noutcome of world-shaking plots, or are they limited to more modest goals? The \nscope of play is the level at which the characters’ actions have an effect. \nconvention game, you just need a couple of locations and a few plots. Sure, the \nCharacters’ actions may change the world, but they don’t need to fly out to Belize \n; \n* \nSC@E \nScope tends to vary with the game’s length and size. If you’re running ashort ! \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nor Saturn or whatnot unless the plot demands. For that reason, you’ll close off \nsome routes artificially by giving subtle hints like, “You sure you want to do that? \nIt has little bearing on the game” or not-so-subtle ones like, “You probably \nshouldn’t go there because we’re not prepared to run that.” \nPLAYER INPUT \nDon’t forget to ask your players what they think. Running a game shouldn’t \nbe a vanity affair. Check with your players and find out what they want from the \ngame. They will certainly let you know what they want to do to have fun. Take \nit with a grain of salt. If you vote on everything, you’ll find the players voting in \nall the powers and benefits they want. If you at least pay attention to what they’re \nsaying, though, you can compromise. \nA good idea is to have a section for player input on sheets at the end of each \ngame. Let the players write down their input and thoughts (anonymously, if they \nlike). Some good things to ask about include: \nWhat sort of venue do you want - \nwhat moods and themes do you enjoy? \nWhat plots do you enjoy? \nDo you want to play in low-power, gritty games or high-power, spiritual \nDo you prefer a focus on characterization, story or setting? \nDo you want more focus on philosophical meandering or more action? \nexploration games? \nTHE \nSTAGES \nWacky Time magic notwithstanding, most good stories follow a predictable \nformat. The plot shouldn’t be transparent, but rather, discrete stages should mark the \nboundaries of the story’s parts. Just as some mages measure events in cycles mirroring \nthe seasons, so too do stories often follow a cycle of growth and conclusion. \n; \nPreparation \nRemember everything we talked about before? While preparation isn’t part \nof the story per se, it’s everything you need to do first to make sure that you can \nf tell the story. Set up your Narrator characters, make sure that your props are in \nplace, double-check all of your cards and folders of paperwork, and go over your \nplot notes one last time. Have your sign-in sheet and venue sheet ready, and \nprepare for the deluge of game-hungry players. \nGame logistics will take up your prep time a few hours before game \ncompletely. Don’t just anticipate it, expect it. Devote your time to making the \ngame go, because you won’t get anything else done. Even if you take a breather, \naNarrator or player will inevitably show up with aquestion or problem. As a rule \nof thumb, anticipate a good two hours of set-up time right before the game. Take \nmore if you need to make copies of your papers, new item cards and the like. \n’ \nE \nOpening \nA bunch of mages standing around wondering what’s going on doesn’t make \n’ \nI for a compelling new story, but a good back-story, a reason for everyone to show \nup and a little fanfare or conflict does. Be sure to kick off your story with an \nannouncement or event that explains why everyone’s present. Maybe it’s as \ngrandiose as ambassadors calling mages for miles around to meet and discuss the \nfate of the Traditions, or it’s as simple as an auction or will-reading that brings \n’ x g  everyone together. Start off with something to get people involved immediately. \nI \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe very beginning of the game is also the place where you’ll transition from \nout-of-play into play. You should have all the character records set up at a check-in \ntable where players can sign in, get their papers and cards and hear any pertinent info. \nPass out your venue sheets here too, and keep your organization at a central table, \npreferably near the entrance so people can come straight to you to check in. Once \neverybody’s signed in, take a minute to make pertinent announcements about new \nrule changes or important back-story information that everyone should know. \nC1’ imax \nTypically, a game session has a climax somewhere in the middle or near the end \nof the evening. (If it occurs too soon, you’ll have a bunch of bored players the rest of \nthe night.) A long-running story has aclimax as well, which may come amidst a bunch \nof other sessions. Either way, the climax is the focal pint and crux of the action. It’s \nthe point at which the players sweat over their decisions and agonize over their \ncharacters’ capabilities. It’s the point at which the plot becomes mostly clear, and the \nfast, furious resolution takes over. In a large game, you may even have several plots that \nall have different climax points that all occur at different times. Typically, the climax \noccurs when the players have enough clues and story angles to find a resolution to some \nproblem or complication, and they bring their characters’ powers to bear. If you must, \nyou can introduce a Narrator character or the like to set a climax, but it’s usually best \nfor the players to experience the sense of accomplishment themselves. \nDuring play, you’ll probably be running around fast and furious, narrating \nchallenges, shoring up problems, making rules calls on-the-spot and providing supprt \nto Narrator characters. Expect it. Players are a fickle lot, and they often long for \nguidance. You probably won’t have time to play a character of your own. Let your \nNarrators handle the important characters, since you’ll have to set up all the challenges \nfor the climax (especially if you decide to use a plot element that busts the rules). \nDenouement \nAfter the story’s height comes the denouement - \nthe aftermath. The players \ntie up loose ends, find out what was really going on and try to recover from the \nwreckage of the scenery. They also lay the groundwork for the next story. For some, \nit’s the realization that the resolution of one puzzle raised additional questions. For \nothers, it’s simply amatter of moving on to the next enemy target. The denouement \nprovides a little breathing space and a chance to feel the sense of accomplishment. \nAt this point, you’ll find that you’re not running challenges so much as \noverseeing the use of Influence and the dissemination of information. Players will \ntry to get involved in the aftermath or dig up more information about what the hell \njust happened. This point is actually a pretty good one at which to play a side \ncharacter so that you can act as a mouthpiece and clearing-house for information. \nKeep your notes handy. You’ll need them, especially as players tell you what they \nhave planned for the game’s new long-range direction in light of recent events. \nWrap-up \nTechnically, thewrapupisn’tpartofthestoryasmuchasastageofthegame \nitself. \nDuringthewrap-up, youput away yourpropsandsendyourplayerspacking. often, the \nplayers will want to meet somewhere to wind down and talk about the event (perhaps \nstill at the game site, perhaps a restaurant or other location). When they do, you can \ntell how the game went. If the players huddle excitedly to discuss all of the amazing \nthings they did, you know that you had a good story because they want to share it. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAfter the game, it’s customary to let everyone decompress for a bit. This is \na good place to get player feedback and deal with awarding extra experience or \nbookkeeping. For instance, you should take the time to make notes about your \nplots while the results remain fresh in your mind. \npL@TS AND PLANS \nSo you have this phenomenal story to tell. Will the players enjoy it? You \ncan’t guarantee that they will, but you can pay attention to a few game factors \nto help. Telling a live-action story is a collaborative effort. Without the players, \nyou have no cast through which to tell the tale. Therefore, you should take steps \nto involve them in the creation of plots. Sometimes players will surprise you and \ncome up with plots on their own as well. The more that you can tailor your plots \nto the things that players enjoy, the more fun you’ll foster. \nBACKGRBUND \nAND HIST~RY \nPL~TS \nRemember back when your players made their characters and wrote up histories \nand lives for them? You know, the part other than the Traits. These histories are \nwonderful indicators for useful plots. Not only can you use elements of these histories \nin the game, but you can use them to gauge the sorts of things that the players find \ninteresting. Ideally, a history is rife with everything from the character’s first magely \nmentor to his family and friends to fallings-out in jobs or relationships. Perhaps the \ncharacter had some passion - \nlike a desire to become a great baseball player - \nor he \nfailed miserably at some effort. Work these passions into the story. Maybe the mage \nsponsorsormentorssomeone whohas talen tsthatremindthemageofherpast. Perhaps \na jilted lover returns for vengeance or reconciliation. You don’t have to look far. The \nlives that these mages had before the Awakening provide ample fodder for stories. \nEach main plot dovetails into your overall chronicle or story execution as \nwell as your theme. These plots are the ones that drive the whole chronicle \nforward andchange its face. Typically, a main plot’s resolution impacts everyone \nin the game, or it represents a substantial triumph or defeat. \nFor instance, you might center a plot on the Technocracy’s attempt to \nestablish a high-tech base of operations in the city. Mages with Influence will start \nto feel the effects, and their Contacts will tell that something’s up. Gradually, the \nTechnocracy will make its presence known with agents and manipulations to local \ngovernment and society. Mages who fight the Technocracy will need to act early \nI to prevent or slow this change. Others may find their activities curtailed or crushed \n’ as the Technocracy co-opts city resources. No mage’s life will remain unaffected \natter what stance the individual takes toward the Technoc- \nthe consequences of each character’s response should have a \ndirect and measurable result on the overall story. \nlayer will spin off his own little plot or interest. If a Hermetic \n; mage manages to lay his hands on an old tome, for instance, it may help him with \n: \nhis studies but it probably won’t affect the course of the whole game. Every mage \n. \n* goes through ups and downs, just like any other person, and these tribulations \nI ,” form small stories of their own. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nOften, a character’s subplot takes primary importance to the player. A character \nbent on becoming a Master will probably spend more time (and Experience Traits) \non magical development than on the petty squabbles that occupy other mages. \nThese drives aren’t necessarily indications that the main plots aren’t important, but \nyou should pay attention to them. When a player ignores your main plot to do \nsomething else, that’s an indication of a need for a subplot. \nSome subplots are small and tidy enough to resolve on their own. If two \ncharacters argue over ideological differences, for instance, you’ll find that they \ncan sit and harangue one another for hours without interference. Indeed, getting \nin the middle may derail the fun. On the other hand, a character hunting down \na specific goal may need a little attention. Trying to find a hated enemy or long- \nlost treasure usually requires the Storyteller’s intervention. \nSome subplots turn into major plots without warning, which can be good \nfor you. It means you don’t have to do a lot of work, but all the players have \nsomething else to involve themselves in. Just make sure that these plots don’t \novershadow your original game. If a mage’s recruitment drive turns into a huge \nforce to overthrow the Technocracy, your careful game of ideology and wonder \nmay turn into a violence-fest. Pay careful attention to subplots. You can nurture \nthem or turn them to your direction if you intervene early. Besides, your plots \nmay well dovetail with the subplots, making a larger and more involved story. \nMages don’t exist in a vacuum. Membership in a Tradition carries with it the \ncamaraderie ofother mages. Whendifferent Traditions meet, their opinions inevitably \nloom large in their interpersonal relations. Characters will naturally come to settle into \ntheir own patterns of relationships, especially if you encourage a little conflict. \nNovice players may have a little trouble with this aspect of the game at first. \nThe “we’re all in this together” mentality can quash many interesting debates. \nTo fire matters up, try tossing in a Narrator character with some strong opinions. \nLet the players debate back and forth, and have a couple of different Narrator \nmages of different Traditions argue their own points of view, then try to drag in \ntheir allies. Hopefully, your players will take the bait and start debating the \nstrengths and weaknesses of their Tradition policies. \nFurthermore, mages have families, co-workers, lovers and enemies just like \nanyoneelse.Since they dealmostwithothermages, theotherplayersnaturallyfillthese \nroles. As long as everyone’s comfortable with the separation of in-game and out-of- \n* \ngame motives and there aren’t hard feelings between players whose characters dislike :i \none another, this focus makes for good story fodder. A mage might use influence to gain \n7 \npetty revenge against a hated co-worker or sacrifice his ideals to help his family or lover. :! \nAs you put together your plots and ideas, remember that conflict is your \nfriend. Although many players are happy to have games ofpolitical maneuvering f \nand philosophical debate, it’s the clash of ideas and opinions that makes them \nfun. For some players, overcoming the conflict is what’s enjoyable. For others, \nit’s watching how people react to the struggle and how they succeed or fail. \nRegardless, conflict keeps matters moving. \nDon’t hesitate to shake things up. Listen to what the players have planned, \nwhat they hope for and what they’d like to do. Then, throw some barriers in their \nCHARACTER \nRELATICDNS \nCCDNPLICT, \nCCBNRICT, \nCCBNFLICT \nf’;. ,. I \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\npath. Give them problems to overcome. Give them adversaries to hate. Ideally, \nthe players will actually complain a little about the various difficulties of the less- \nthan-ideal world, but they’ll be all the more pleased when they finally do \novercome their problems and get what they want. Nothing galvanizes players as \nquickly as establishing some problem that impacts the characters directly. \nCREATING \nTHE SJZTTING \nThe story’s setting will have an immediate, tangible impact on its tone and \nmood, and it will influence the characters’ actions from the very first game \nsession. Your choice of setting and how you detail it can enhance or encumber \nyour plot dramatically, so don’t skimp on this element of the story. \nFINDING \nG m e  LKATICBNS \nThe normal people out there (read: those who don’t play live-action games) \ngenerally frown upon and don’t understand such activities, especially in public. \nFor this reason, if nothing else, you’ll want a private location to play. \nMost troupes won’t be able to afford to rent an actual building. If you can, \ngreat! Charge a couple bucks to offset costs, and make sure that you are careful \nnot to destroy the scenery. There’s no sense getting on peoples’ bad sides. \nIt’s more likely, though, that you’ll use a friend’s house. If you can arrange \nit, have a couple of different rooms set up. Use one for the main game site, one \nfor the Umbra (if that’s important to your game) and one for off-site actions and \nyour little office where you can store records and check people into play. \nRegardless of locale, make sure that you’re ready to cough up an explanation of \nwhat you’re doing if necessary. If your hends’ family members drop by or a few \nL wandering curious people from the general public spot the game, they may want to \nknow what’s going on. If you’ve been careful not to have too many public displays of \n“magic” you can usually explain the nature of the game. You may want to have a few \npapersonhandwithaquickdescription, perhapsaspartofyourvenuestylesheet. Don’t \nbother arguing with people about your game, especially local community folks like \nchurch leaders and police officers. You maybe just enjoying yourselves, but if they feel \nthat the game is threatening, they have the law and the community on their side. \nObviously, some settings are nigh-impossible to replicate. Most troupes just \ndon’t have the money and materials on hand to build an ancient Chantry, a \ncrumbling palace or an entire spirit world. Players suspend their disbelief in \n* magic for the game -and they’ll have to suspend a little for the location as well \nn E - \nbut the more you can make the location reflect the setting, the more \nf accessible it’ll be and the less it’ll detract from the game itself. \nNaturally you can do only so much with a location. If you’re stuck with a \ndowntown coffee shop, there’s not too much you can do. You’ll have to run with the \ndecor. When you have the opportunity to do your own decorating, use garnishes to \n‘ \nf set the stage for your game’s tone. You can put a map or description on your venue \n1 : - style sheet so that everyone knows what the location’s supposed to be like. Try to pick \na site or decorate one so that it suits not just the physical description of the location \n: \nof the game, but also so that it facilitates the moods you want to convey. Brightly lit, \n. \n* cheery restaurants aren’t the best place for backroom plotting and treachery, nor do \n, I * dank alleyways and run-down tenements inspire hope. \n1 - 1 .  \nt ‘  \ni \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSET UP T@ THR~W \nD ~ W N  \nBefore you open the game for the evening’s play, think about how the \nsetting coheres with the back-story. If your setting is supposed to be a seedy part \nof town across from a cemetery, for instance, then perhaps mages who use Spirit \nmagic will catch occasional glimpses of ghosts, or ghosts may spot them. If you \ndecide that the location’s just a short distance from a police department, then \nthe mages will need to be much more careful to avoid attracting attention. \nThe setting location itself cangive you little plot bombs to seed in the area. Each \none is a subplot waiting to happen. Just make sure to look over the area in advance \nand decide what you want to do or how the rest of the world might impact upon it. \nMages move through varied environments, so use little hints to help set the \nstage. Colors help to set moods. Use bright and hot colors like orange, red and \nyellow for frenetic games; use purple and blue for more languorous environs. \nYour trappings provide a hint for the imagination to springboard from. A piece \nof statuary isn’t only a chunk of background scenery, it’s a mood piece that tells \nabout the setting based on its style and pose. A sparse room without decoration \ncarries a message just as surely as a lavish one does. \nh B L 4 N C E  \nLIGHTING \nThe World of Darkness is intrinsically a darker, more shadowy place. Alleys \nare dangerous with black shade, and clouds loom in the sky with a threat of \nthunder. While you can’t control the weather, you can influence interior \nlighting. For a moody, sedate game, use blue-colored lights, close the blinds and \nput dark rugs on the floor to absorb reflection. Vary the lights as the story \ndemands. Perhaps a great magical working causes lights to blow out, or more \nlights are appropriate for a large meeting. You can use candles or lamps (if you’re \ncareful with the flame) to represent a more archaic setting, like the sanctum of \nan ancient Hermetic. If you’re showcasing the Umbra, try dark blue and violet \nlighting. For the Shadowlands, mix a few dim lights with some blacklight. \n, \nmus1c \nAlthough you must be careful not to allow it to overpower the game, music adds \na definite edge. Queue up a CD player in the comer with some soft ambient music, \npreferably without distracting lyrics, and you’ll generate some undertones without \nmuch effort. Music has a powerful emotional impact, but it’s best when it’s subtle. \nIf you have to shout to be heard over the words of the music, it’s just distracting. \nDifferent sorts of music are appropriate for different venues. New Age and \ntrance help to convey a mystical feeling, as do traditional instrumental pieces \nsuch as folk music. Classical music gives a grandiose, regal bearing, such as might \nbe appropriate for a convocation of Tradition mages. Techno and industrial can \naccompany Technocrats or certain Tradition technomancers. Darkwave and \nGothic music works for Hollow Ones, dealings with ghosts and spirit worlds. So \ndoes Native American folk music. Gregorian chants are appropriate for slow, \nreligious proceedings like high ceremonies and churches, while Akashic Broth- \nerhood initiates would relax among Buddhist chants and Taiko drums. You can \nalso use natural sounds (sounds of rain, running water or the like) to simulate the \nnaturalistic impact of groups like the Verbena or the feel of the spirit world \nmeeting the material. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nPR€BPS \nThe game’s props are the final touches you add to the setting. Since players will \nrecognize them and associate them with various memories or moods, the props have \na powerful impact - \nmore so if they can be picked up and used by your players. \nStage Props \nThe stage props are the pieces of art and furniture that help set the scene. These \nsettings range from the mundane to the magnificent. You don’t need to spend a lot of \nmoneyorbeawizardat interiordesign.Useyourpiecestoaccentuate,nottooverburden. \nYou’ll find many useful stage pieces around your own house. A painting or mural \nin one room can help set a specific tone, or you might bring along some furniture like \nchairs (very handy since your players probably won’t appreciate standing around all \nnight) orlamps intowhichyoucanputyourcoloredlightbulbs. \nDropinarug orcarpet. \nYou can use sheets, drapes or even towels to make wall hangings or to cover an \ninconvenient window. A bowl of h i t  or a vae can add a touch of class to a bare table. \nEven if you don’t have the props you want at home, you can usually pick some \nup cheaply. Offer incentives to your players who help out. An Experience Trait \naward for logistics may be a nice kicker to promote bringing in handy props. Set \nup a prop list of pieces you want (which will also make a nice checklist when you \npack up at the end of a game). You’ll find that antique stores and secondhand stores \noften have some odd knickknacks. These trinkets are especially appropriate for \nmages, since mages tend to collect odd items reminiscent of specific cultures or \nhistorical periods. Therefore, that odd little cherub statue or Aztec mosaic may be \njust the piece to go with your Celestial Chorus or Dreamspeaker characters. \nSmall props tend to be more useful than large props, just because they’re easy \nto use. Remember that you’ll have to lug the props around to set up your game site. \nIf it takes you longer to set up the props than to play the actual game, it’s taking too \nmuch effort. A large oaken table may be just the thing you want, but if you can’t lug \nit around and it keeps people from moving around the room, it may not be worth the \neffort. Accentuate first. Put special lighting near trophy pieces or stick a piece on top \nof a table or whatnot to draw attention without taking up too much room. \nPersonal Props \nNot every player can spare the investment for all the foci and trappings of a \ncharacter. As Storyteller, you should facilitate these things by bringing along some \npersonal props of your own. Not only does doing so allow you to showcase the sorts of \nprops you consider good, but it lets you set a standard of what is and isn’t acceptable. \nIt also helps players who otherwise wouldn’t have the appropriate materials, and it lets \nyou keep a bunch of props on hand with which to supply your Narrator characters. \nLike stage props, you should use personal props judiciously. A great gnarled \nstaff is a nifty conversation piece, but it’s no good when it’s whacking other \nplayers and getting caught in doorways. Look for bits of jewelry or clothing, \nespecially in second-hand stores, for cheap accessories that bring out the \ncharacter’s personality. A Euthanatos might look like an average Joe in black \nclothes, until you add on the necklace of Kali, while a Dreamspeaker could have \n1 . - elaborate feathers, paints, rattles and dream-catchers for a high ritual ceremony. \nAs noted before, Laws of Ascension tends to be rather setup intensive. You \nhave a lot to keep track of, so you’d better do as much as you can ahead of time. \n, \n, \n: * PLAYING \nWITH PAPERW~RK \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nStill, preparation doesn’t obviate the need to keep papers organized during the \ngame as well. A Storyteller might find time to run a character, but more often it’ll \ntake all the time and effort to keep the story moving while keeping records current. \nHard copy is your friend. Many Traits fluctuate wildly in play, so take note as \nbest you can. Obviously you can’t track easily the flow of things like Quintessence \nor every Ability Trait used, but you can take notes on good roleplayers, new rotes \nlearned, plot points that showed up and checklists that you’ve made. You can keep \nrecords during play, then transfer them into your notebook at the close of the game. \nKeep your books as current as you can. Making sure that you follow up quickly will \navoid problems later. Youcan take advantage of computer databases, palm pilots and \nthe like to make your note-taking easier, but be sure to print everything out with \ndates too, just in case something happens to the computer records. \nCHARACTER \nk m ~ s  \nKeep copies of every character record for yourself. Doing so serves many pu~poses. \nIf your players lose their records, you have new copies for them. You can also update \ncharacter records between games. You can even check to see who has certain Back- \ngrounds, Abilities or Advantages. You can put down notes as the game progresses. If a \nplayereamsanExperienceTraitorleamsanewrote,youcanwriteitdownimmediately. \nThen update your database at the end of the game, and you’ll keep current. \nThe advancement rate in your game depends a lot on how much experience \nyou award. Typically, you shouldn’t award more than two or three Traits in a \ngame session, with four tops for the absolute best roleplay, logistical help and the \nlike. Don’t forget that even experience isn’t the only measure of advancement. \nAs shown on p. 137, just learning certain Spheres can take a lot of time. \nMake sure to keep running tallies of Experience Traits on character \nrecords. That way, you know just how much the character needs to advance \nand how much he’s already spent. Plus, the player can calculate on his own \nand savor the anticipation. \nTypically, you should award one Experience Trait for surviving a game \nsession. A strong roleplaying session is worth an extra Trait, and you might award \na Trait for agood costume, achieving a specific goal or helping with Narration and \nlogistics. When you give roleplaying bonuses, popular acclaim is a good measure \nbut it’s not the only measure. Many good characters don’t do their best work in \npublic, and just because someone’s funny or intense doesn’t mean that others \naren’t worthy of notice for roleplaying a more sedate character properly. \nINf LUENCE \nOf all the Backgrounds, Influence is probably the most likely to impact \ndirectly on stories and come into direct conflict. Two characters might use \nopposing Influences to make bids for power. You need to keep careful track of \nwho does what, and when, in order to make sure that Influences clash correctly. \nIf a mage uses Church Influence to stop something at the beginning of the game, \ntake a note so that someone later using Political Influence to change it winds up \nproperly fighting over the Influence clash. Besides, this clash is more good fodder \nfor subplots and non-lethal player conflict. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nplay. It’sup to you todetermine what’s fair for the game, andit’smucheasierjust to leave \nPandora’s box unopened than to close it once you’ve let the twinks out. \nAs an aside, this book says again and again that it’s full of optional rules and that \nit’s up to the Storyteller to pick the rules that are usable and fun for the group. This \nisn’t just talk. On your venue style sheet, be sure to list your house rules, optional rules \nand changes. That way, you can avoid later fights, since you can always pull out the \n: sheet and be certain that the players knew what you had in mind. \n*I THE \nCARE AND FEEDING \nCEF PLAYERS \nThe player-Storyteller relationship is a special one. Players have high \nexpectations, especially since everyone has a unique desire for the direction of \nthe game. Players need to trust the Storyteller to be impartial, and they need to \naccept that the Storyteller knows what he’s doing. Trouble ensues if the players \nget a little too crotchety or rebellious.. . this is all for fun, isn’t it? \nBe sure to talk regularly to the players, not just as the Storyteller, but as an \nacquaintance. You need them to feel comfortable voicing their concerns, and \n, am you should watch them so that you can head off problems before they hit. \nSTCBRY \nEVENTS \nHopefully, your notebook of story materials includes a short synopsis of various \nplots. As certain events occur, you can check them off or make notes about their \nexecution. This’ll help later to determine who exactly was involved in a specific \nfiasco, how torunwithanongoingevolvingstory and what theplayersenjoyedmost. \nBe sure to jot down names, prominent actions and perhaps a few ideas for \nconsequences. In some cases, the players will come up with explanations for a plot \nthat are far off from what you had in mind, but they might be fun anyway. Don’t be \nafraid to run with those ideas in order to make the plot fit a good idea that you hear. \nCHARACT~RCREATI~N \nAlthough character creation occupies its own chapter, it’s a special task for the \nStoryteller as well. Some parts of character creation that seem downright simple can \nrequire aid from a Storyteller all too often. After all, a mage doesn’t drop into avacuum. \nWhat if your game already has enough Hermetics? What if the Storyteller is sick of \nseeing characters with Brawl x5? The venue style sheet should take care of many such \nconflicts, but sometimes it’s unavoidable. Someone could just make something up \nbecause he either doesn’t know better or hopes for special dispensation. \nIdeally, character creation should occupy time before or after a game. The \nStoryteller has too much to do during the game to get bogged down. A helpful \nNarrator can oversee the process, but it’s usually better to have the characters \nin advance specifically so that you can use them to feed subplots later. Also, as \nStoryteller you know best what you want from the game, what would be \nproblematic and what’s likely to find a good niche. Help the players make \ncharacters with vibrant backgrounds and strong plot hooks. \nInaddition toacharacter’sTraits, youneed tolookovercertainancillarymaterials \nthat come with the territory. If you have pre-made rote cards and item cards, you can \njust hand them out, but often you‘ll need to make up new ones for new characters. \nSimilarly, if you use Paradox cards, you’ll need to grab some from your pool or make \nnew ones. All of these cards require your thought and approval beforehand. Don’t let \naplayershoehorn you into approving abunchofquestionablerotesfive minutesbefore \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSome players take the game a little too much to heart. They dwell on what they can \ndo and take it as a personal attack if their characters are laid low. This obsession is a sort \nofbackhanded compliment, since it means that the player is very involved in the game, \nbut it also presents dfficulties because the player may not accept the consequences of \nnegativerepercussionsor characterdeath. Youneed tostopandremind these p p l e  that \nit’s only a game. You may need to have the player head home and cool down for a while \nbefore you talk about consequences of stories. You’ll wind up with a dissatisfied player \notherwise, and dissatisfied players have a tendency to gripe their personal frustrations to \nanyone who’ll listen about how unfair and tyrannical you are. \nSome players just aren’t active enough in the game. They expect things to come \nto them, or they just don’t know what to do. You need to encourage your players to \ntake action.They can’t just sit aroundwaitingfor enlightenment tostrike. Prod them \na little with the threat of enemies who might surpass them if they don’t move, or the \npromise ofbenefits that they might attain. Again, don’t hesitate to mention outside \nthe game that the player might want to think about strategies. If a player is frustrated \nby a lack of accomplishment, encourage him to try a few things or take a few risks. \nSince Laws of Ascension requires so much set-up, it can be daunting to \nfirst-timers. Players who don’t know what they’re diving into, especially if \nthey’ve never roleplayed before, can easily find the game disheartening, too \nchallenging or just too strange. Obviously you don’t want that. You want them \nto have a good time and hopefully to come back for more. \nSetting up a new player is more than just slinging out a character sheet and \nrunning on the fly. New players require special attention. That personal attention \nhelps to build the level of trust between Storyteller and player and gives you the \nchance to explain the game exactly as you see it. That way, you can be sure that \nthe player learns of terms and rules in a way that’s appropriate to how you play. \nFor first-timers, you’ll do well if you sit down ahead of time, perhaps with \na Narrator, and go over the game tenets first. Don’t start with rules, start with \nconcepts. Explain why the game is supposed to be fun and what you do. Explain \nthe concept of roleplaying and go over your venue style sheet to look at what you \npersonally try to promote with the game. Then you can get down to talking about \ncharacter concepts and Traits. The important part is to make sure that the player \nhas an interesting character and doesn’t feel lost coming in to play. \nA good system is the buddy system: Match up a new player with an old-hand \ncharacter. Your new player’s Hermetic mage, for instance, might be an apprentice , \nor contemporary of an existing Hermetic character. Hook up the players and make \nsome introductions, then ask the experienced player to help show the new guy the ; \nropes.Thenewp1ayerhasamentorwhocanguide himandhelphim toavoidpitfalls, \nwhile the experienced player has the chance to sway this fresh mind to his side. \n‘ \nSometimes, you’ll find that older players see new ones as fresh meat. They \nuse their powerful characters to steamroller the new ones, feeling that this \nbehavior somehow conveys a sense of superiority. You should discourage this \nbehavior. At the very least, it’s bad roleplaying. At worst, it’s no fun for the new \nplayers and just encourages them to find a different hobby. You should crack \ndown on this behavior by withholding roleplaying Experience Traits, exempt- \ning new players from challenges or introducing your own powerful Narrator \nNEW PLAYERS \ni: - .: \nh 5  \n1 \ncharacter who frowns upon such steamrollering. \n, &.’a \n, \nil? \nI’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nG~AL+~.IENTED \nvs. ST~RY~~RIENTED \nPLAYERS \nWhile there are as many types of players as there are people, you’ll find that a \nlot of them easily divide into the following two simple categories for game purposes: \ngoal-oriented and story-oriented. Once you figure out which category describes your \nplayer, you’ll find it easier to accommodate the player’s way to enjoy the game. \nA goal-oriented player - \nwhich usually makes up about 80.90% of the \ngroup -relies on achievement and actual measurable steps. These players savor \nthe sense of accomplishment of overcoming adversaries, achieving new levels of \npower and gaining Traits or treasures. To them, the game may tell a story, but \nthey can win if they advance their agendas and improve their characters’ \nstrengths like a protagonist in a popular novel. You’ll satisfy these players if you \ngive them things to beat and chances to earn new Traits, better rotes and more \npowerful Backgrounds or items. Some see the game as an exercise not in \nstorytelling, but in numbers. For these people, the game is about tweaking the \nrules and running the other players (i.e., competitors) into the ground. These \nsorts don’t often cooperate well when you want to tell a story for everyone. \nHowever, goal-orientation isn’t all bad. It keeps the player moving forward, and \nit gives you concrete means to reward them or show success. \nA story-oriented player relishes the emotions and ideas evoked by the game. \nThese players don’t care if their characters die hideously, languish under a \nterrible curse or otherwise “lose.” Numbers and Traits aren’t as important as \ngetting on with the story itself. As in a tragedy where the protagonist dies, goes \ninsane or suffers some other horrible fate, the story-oriented player enjoys the \nconflicts, feelings and conundrums that face the character, not necessarily the \nprocess of beating them. These players often make easy prey for goal-oriented \nplayers, because the latter sometimes enjoy defeating other players and the story- \noriented players aren’t as focused upon Traits and ways to make the rules work \nto their advantage. However, having story-oriented players along helps build a \ncore of people who want a game experience, not just an exercise in engineering. \nMany players fall somewhere between the two extremes. Early game experiences \ne -from sports to board games -usually teach people to play in a goal-oriented mode, \nto score pints and overcome obstacles. Players with more background in theater and \nliterature may be more story-oriented. Ideally you’ll want to strike a balance. Goal- \noriented players help to advance the game and keep it moving, while story-oriented \nplayers provide a good response to the surroundings and play up the drama. \n. \n1 \n: TRAINING \nYem PLAYERS \nSo you’ve got a bunch of players, and you want to turn them into a troupe. \njrli \nDoing so takes some work, especially given the different game styles and the \n”’ introduction of players who don’t know how the game is played. How, then, do \nyou train your players to enjoy the game you’re running? \nTo some degree, you just have to be lucky and have good players. If one of your \n* \nplayers is hell-bent on running over all of the others in the MageMobile or he wants \nI * \nto design the ritual Effect that’ll kill all vampires everywhere, then he is probably \n* \n~ \nmissing the point of the storytelling experience. You can hope, you can wheedle and \n, \nyou can try to limit the player to less outrageous outbursts, but you may not be able \n’ . to change him. That’s just the way it is. If a player’s too problematic, then you need \n, *a to get rid of him before he damages the game for everyone else. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nHowever, you can do a little Pavlovian training to nudge your players in the right \ndirection. The roleplaying Experience Trait award is only one such bonus. Those who \nplay their characters well and take a few hits for the story receive a tangible benefit in \nterms of points. Enforcing consequences for actions is one of the most important things \nyou can do. A lot of things that are technically legal in the rules are just plain bad ideas. \nYou can enforce the social penalties of mages, by branding an offender or even having \npowerful mages show up to deal with a problem child. Don’t hesitate. This sort of \npunishment proves to agoal-oriented player that screwing around is a losing situation, \nwhile a story-oriented player will take this beating in stride and either shape up or drive \nthe character straight into self-destruction. \nRewarding story-crafting is a little harder. Try to cleave to the requirements \nthat add to story building. For instance, insist that players use their Traits to \ndescribe their actions narratively. Doing so isn’t just Storytelling by fiat, but it \nencourages the players to think about the appearance of what they’re doing and \nhow their characters do it. That’s why the Traits are there instead of just \nnumbers, after all. Similarly, if a player doesn’t pantomime or describe the \nactions of foci and casting an Effect, assign a slight penalty to the Arete test. \nObviously, the mage isn’t bothering to use his enlightened tools. \nMost importantly, talk with your players about what you want to accom- \nplish. Sometimes you’ll want to ask a player to bend a little for the good of the \nstory. Maybe a mage can kill someone, but he shouldn’t for the sake of the story. \nGood roleplaying doesn’t mean following an ironclad concept that straightjac- \nkets you into actions that throw the game. It means playing a role to a hilt that’s \nfun, and making sure that it’s equally fun for everyone else. \nNARRAT€BRS \nThe Narrators are the friends, confidants and co-conspirators of the \nStoryteller. While a Narrator usually doesn’t have as much say in plots and rules, \na Narrator does have the authority to moderate scenes, play special characters \nfor the plot and make judgment calls on the spot. The Narrator serves as a \nstopgap to address the fact that you can’t oversee the whole game at once and \nthat you’ll just need a helping hand from time to time. \nObviously there’s no real limit to your Narrating staff, except the number of \npeople you can recruit and trust. A Narrator takes on significant responsibilities, \nso he needs to be someone you’ll put stock in. Also, a Narrator needs a decent \nhandle on the rules, just to make sure that all ofher judgment calls and moderation \nflow smoothly. Beyond that, it’s upon you to decide on your Narrator staff. A good \nratio is one Narrator for every five to 10 players, but it will vary with your own \nenergy and the size of the game. In a game of 20 or fewer people in a small area, \nyou might oversee it yourself, while in a huge convention game, you might want \nNarrators who specifically administer and coordinate other Narrators. \nSince you’ll be so busy during the game, you should encourage your players \nto seek the help of Narrators. For small questions or scenes, a Narrator should do \njust fine. Of course, the Narrators can come to you if they have trouble, but that \nshould be a last resort. Make sure that your Narrators know what you want from \nthe game so that you don’t overrule them later. If you undermine their authority, \nthe players won’t go to them for moderation. In turn, don’t micromanage. Let the \nNarrators handle rule decisions and play out important roles. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nIt’s important for your Narrators to wear nametags or otherwise be identi- \nfied so that people know whom to talk to, and they understand that the kick-ass \nMaster wandering around isn’t some player cheating or getting favoritism. \nIn addition to general rules Narrators and players of your plot characters, you \nmight want to use some specialized Narrators to pick up special needs of the game. \nAn Avatar Guide handles narration for all Avatar-driven events. Usually this \nisn’t too much to do. The Narrator just takes care of the interaction of Avatar and \nmage. Most of the time, this is a simple job of handling the whispers or urges that \nan Avatar may give to a mage. Rarely, the Avatar Guide will take on the role of \nan Avatar as it manifests in a dream (or even physically) to guide its patron. \nThe Avatar Guide’s most important role lies in Seekings. When you arrange a \nSeeking, be sure to have the Avatar Guide along. The Avatar Guide plays the role \nof the individual Avatar, pushing the mage to enlightenment and making demands. \nThis role is difficult, because the Avatar Guide must understand not only the \nAvatar’s Essence, but the mage’s background. Keep the mage’s history on file (You \ndidget ahisto ryonfile fromtheplayer, right?) sothat the AvatarGuidecanreference \nit. When you sit down to craft a Seeking, bring your Avatar Guide along, so that you \ncan work together and make sure that the Avatar reacts appropriately. \nTHE \nAVATAR \nGUIDE \nI \nTHE PARAD@% TUDGE \nSometimes you want a system that encourages a little wild Paradox, but you \ncan’t rely on Paradox cards or you don’t like using straight damage. In such cases, \nyou rely on a Paradox Judge. \nThe Paradox Judge has the difficult job of coming up with Paradox \nBacklashes and events to respond to various magely workings. When a mage \ngains Paradox, it’s up to this Narrator to decide if the Paradox hangs and what \neffect it takes. The Paradox Judge might have a deck of Paradox cards, or you \nmight trust him to come up with results on the spur of the moment. The Paradox \nJudge should create or approve Paradox cards in any case, if you use them. \nEither way, this position is a difficult one. The Paradox Judge has the \nthankless task of inflicting hardship on characters, which always draws ire from \nthe players. Furthermore, players will tend to avoid magic specifically when they \nnotice the Paradox Judge around. For this reason, you should consider using \nwalkie-talkies or headsets to communicate, so that the Paradox Judge can make \njudgment calls from a distance. \n’ \n8 \nTHE \nSPINT \nKEEPER \nFor games with many spirits or lots of Umbral travel, you’ll need a Spirit Keeper. \nThis Narrator handles all matters spiritual, including keeping spirit Traits, tracking \nimportant recurringspirits, deciding onGauntlet 1evelsandclassifyingUmbralrealms. \nWhen a mage summons up a spirit, it’s up to the Spirit Keeper to play out \nI that role and make sure that the spirit is duly recorded for future notice. The \nSpirit Keeper also tracks the notoriety of mages who abuse spirit hospitality, and \n* \nhe decides on the appropriateness of various fetishes. The Spirit Keeper further \nI * \nserves as the final authority on Umbral denizens and characteristics. Therefore, \n‘ \ne the Spirit Keeper determines what sort of magic is coincidental in the Umbra \n, ‘a and what the rules of various Realms are. \n‘ \n! - I .  \nI .  \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nUnless you’re running aone-shot game, you will have some downtime between \nepisodes.That is, the charactersmay exist inasortofperpetuallimbo, shelved in your \nfiles, but that doesn’t mean that they’re necessarily without action.

To moderate this time, you \nshould have downtime sheets available for your players. At the end of the game, let your \nplayers write down on pieces of paper the sorts of actions that they want to take. Have \nthem prioritize their actions, so that they might get to some but not others. Then, between \ngames, you can figure out what happens and set up responses to hand out with the \ncharacter records at the beginning of the next game. These oppormnities are perfect for \nusing Backgrounds such as Allies and Influence so that the character can accomplish \ntricky or lengthy tasks like securing occult instruction, manipulating the mayor’s office \nor putting a lock down on criminal activity within a few blocks. \nWhen you use downtimes, be sure to set a deadline. You don’t need players \nturning in a downtime a day before the game and demanding results. \nGood actions for downtime include: \nDetermining where the mage lives and how she survives day-to-day \nFinding out what Nodes the mage visits \nSearching for occult materials or instructors \nCasting lengthy rituals (especially divinations) \nExercising Allies and Influence \nLearning new Spheres \nYou can also take downtimes through email, if you’re so inclined. \nTR~UBLESH~~TING \n~RR~REEBIT~‘THW’SNC”STCBDCBNTI-I\nThere’s always someone who feels this way. One of the difficulties lies in \nseparating the constant complainers (it happens) from folks with a legitimate \ndifficulty. Problems of this sort can stem from many different difficulties, and they’re \nnot necessarily the fault of the Storyteller. Check the following possibilities: \nIs the player pursuing her character’s goals actively? Some players are too afraid \nof losing their characters, or they just don’t plan out means to pursue their goals. \nIs the player hoarding information she should be sharing? This is a \nconstant problem. Often, one player will gain some information about a plot, \nthen sit on it to the exclusion of everyone else. If the player isn’t sure what to \ndo with it or doesn’t want to risk it, then the plot languishes. \nIs the player refusing to interact with other players during games? Sure, \nsome characters may be loners or have social difficulties, but almost everyone \nhas at least one acquaintance. \nDid the player miss one or more vital clues?This problem might be a story \nissue. You should usually have multiple entry points to a plot and provide \nmultiple ways to enter the story from clues or activities. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDid the player create a full character background? If not, why is the \ncharacter already in play? \nIs the pace of the game too slow for the player? It’s possible that the player \njust demands a faster pace than you want to play. In such a case, the player needs \nto decide whether it’s worth a little boredom to get to the high points. \nIs the player achieving her character goals too easily?Your player may just \nbe clever, or your plots might not be convoluted and challenging enough. \nIs there something in particular the player dislikes or doesn’t understand \nabout the story? Sometimes, the player really wants to play, but he just doesn’t like \nthe game you have to offer. In such a case, you don’t have much choice if you don’t \nwant to change your game. The player just needs to find agame more to his liking. \nEven when you go out of your way to introduce plot elements, some players \nmay still become bored. In some cases, it’s because the player isn’t interested in \nthose elements. Check the character background to see what the player found \ninteresting enough to include there. In other cases, the players feel stampeded \nwhen more powerful characters step in. You might consider directing some of \nthe plots straight at the lesser characters, perhaps by introducing them through \nNarrator characters who go straight to an individual with a targeted plot. \nIn some cases, you’ll have players who just aren’t social or are too passive, \nand they don’t become involved in what’s going on. The buddy system (see p. \n247) is a good helper here, so that a passive player gets dragged along with a more \nactive one. However, if a player is too passive, sometimes there’s not much you \ncan do. You can force the player to react to situations, but if the player won’t \nstand up and become involved, then there’s no way to force him to have fun. \nTGXB \nITIKH VI~XWE \n“ N ~ T A N C D T H E R ~  \nCCB~T!’’ \nLet’s face it, some players out there relish conflict, find nothing more enjoyable \nthan beating down the other players’ characters and happily count up all their Traits \nand powers as measures of personal prowess. These twinks, as they’re not-so- \na affectionately known, believe in engineering their characters to beat all comers, \ntaking the lead by bullying and quashing all opposition. Unless a group of players \nbecomessufficiently motivated tooust them, thetwinksmayrunroughshodoverthe \ngame, wrecking every person and plot in contact with them.

After that, I teleport \naway so that they can’t follow, wait two days to heal the Paradox damage, then come \nback to have my revenge. With +5 Traits from an extended Life ritual.”) \nIt may sound cruel, but there’s little way around it: Do Not Suffer A Twink \nI To Live. A obsessive goaleoriented player like this causes too much conflict to \n4 the rest of the game, especially with the tendency to bully around other players \n, \nwho just want to roleplay and have a good time. You can sometimes keep the \n’ 1  twinks occupied with heavy-duty combat. A twink will leap at the chance to \nI \ncrush enemies that he can be sure of defeating (and, conversely, he will flee at \n‘ the first sign of truly powerful opposition - \nor opposition targeted against him \n: \nspecifically), all so that he can have another victory under his belt. \nHowever, you can’t be expected to spend all of your time moderating \nI ,” combats for one player (or one cabal of twinks). Corner your twink and try to \n.‘ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nfind out what’s motivating him to dominate the game. Many will have some sort \nof excuse. Puncture that with direct evidence: How many other characters have \nbeen killed already? How many times has the game stopped while confused \nNarrators tried to follow the player’s logic for why his Spheres grant unstoppable \npowers? How many of this player’s characters have fought for or demanded \npositions of leadership and threatened others with a good smacking if they were \ndenied? Suggest that the player re-examine his motives and decide whether he \nreally wants to play so competitively in a game that is cooperative by definition. \nIf the player is just gung-ho about the beat-down, then perhaps he should head \nto a game that fosters such attitudes a little more. (Conversely, if you enjoy \nrunning live-action Street Fighter, then go for it. There’s nothing wrong with \nit if everyone’s having fun. The only problem comes when many players stop \nenjoying themselves and start complaining about too much fighting.) \nRant over. On some occasions, you’ll run into excess combat because of \nlemming syndrome. A small fight will break out, and a few bored other players will \nwander over and want to cycle in. You can curb this effect in a couple of ways. Host \nthe game setting in a locale where such uberviolence wouldn’t be tolerated (like \nan important Chantry where Adepts would put a quick stop to it). Or you can just \nmaneuver combats to another room where other characters can’t simply drop in. \nAlso remember to enforce some sense of time limits. If a player wanders on over \nto acombat at the corner of the Quik-Mart, it may well take several turns (at three \nseconds a turn) for the character to actually arrive on the scene. That should be \nlong enough for the combat to finish before the character actually arrives. \n ETAW WING \n“ H W , Y @ W ~ ~ B C A N ~  \nP~SBLY hew THAT!’’ \nPerhaps one of the most pervasive problems in a large-scale format, and one of the \nmost ddficult to curb, lies in metagaming. Some players will migrate their out-of-game \nknowledge into the game. Little snippets ofoverheard conversation or the like will turn \ninto actions. They may not even use it to rationalize their actions; they simply act \naccording to their meta-knowledge. (“No, I was just wandering into the back room for \na smoke, really. I didn’t know that you planned to ambush the Master there.”) \nYou should adopt strict in-character policy for your games. As long as your \nplayers are in the play locale, they’re in play. They’re subject to challenges, and \nanything they say can be used against them, which cuts back marvelously on the \nsupervillain-like gloating. Set aside a room (a kitchen with snacks is a good idea, , \nor a smoking area outside) for out-of-play interactions, but encourage people to \nstay in character as much as possible. \nIf you actually catch someone metagaming, punish it quickly and harshly. \nDon’t ever let people migrate their knowledge facetiously into play. It’s cheat- \ning, plain and simple. \n~.R~NIIE~ATIVE \nPLAYERS \nY ~ U  \nCN T D@ THA~ T @ ~ Y  \nC\n~\n~\nT\n~\nT\nP\nP\n \nRemember (to quote Deird’re Brooks): Story is everything. Obey Your Storyteller. \nYou must establish your storytelling authority early and firmly. Allow a player \none shot at making a position, but if a player argues continually, just say NO.

(You can’t tell them all of your tricks and secret plots.) If the \nplayer continues to argue, suggest that she take a little time out-of-play to cool off. \nSome players can’t deal with the fact that things won’t always go their way, or \nthey will just argue with other players. Step in quickly to resolve these disputes. In \nthe former case, you will probably just have to ask the player to leave. Those who \ncan’t deal with the fact that the game doesn’t always go as they desire can’t be allowed \nto disrupt it for everyone else.

When you absolutely have no more inspiration, or when \nyou start seeing the game as a chore, it’s time to set it aside. \nYou may feel like you have a duty to your players to run the game, but \nconsider this: Your first duty is to entertain. If you can’t do that, if you are just \nout of fun things to do, then you should let someone else take up the mantle. \nThere will be other games. You don’t have to shoulder this burden forever. \nMaybe it’s time for you to be a player. That way, you too can experience what \nit’s like to play and have a Storyteller whose rules and games styles don’t exactly \nj match up with your own.

Some players won’t hesitate to give you a piece \nof their mind, but others will simply drift quietly away from the game. Sometimes \nthat wonderful plot you came up with just isn’t working, and you should pay \nattention. If nobody enjoys the game, it’s time to change gears. Conversely, you \nwill occasionally run into players who gripe whenever they don’t feel like the \ncenter of attention or get what they want. Some are just griping out of habit, and \nthey stay quiet when they’re enjoying themselves. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDon’t take game criticism personally. Sure, it’s your imagination and your \nstory, but just because some people don’t like it doesn’t mean that it’s without \nmerit. You may just need something different to satisfy the group. Also remember \nthat a story runs on conflict. Players will complain loud and long when they feel \nlike they’re given the short end of the stick, but it’s overcoming such adversity that \ngives them a sense of accomplishment and triumph. If a player gripes that the story \nsucks but the real problem is that the character’s in a bad spot, then you may just \nbe in the conflict part of a story cycle, and matters will probably pick up once it’s \nresolved. Also, if a bunch of players dislike a given story element, that dislike is a \ngreat motivator for them to get involved and change it in the course of the game. \nSure, everyone will bitch if a crazed Master shows up and starts dictating policy, \nbut they’ll relish the victory all the more once they beat him or manage to \ncircumvent him and accomdish their own eoals anvwav. \nFAVCHUTISIII: \n“Y&’RE \nCBNLY LETTIN;  HI^ \nPLAY A ~ ~ , S T E R  \nEECAUSE HE s YWR BCDYRUEND!” \nAlthough you shouldn’t always be fair - life isn’t, and neither are \nStorytellers -you should be impartial. That is, if you shaft a character, it should \nbe on the basis of story elements or just random fate, not because you personally \ndislike the player. Similarly, you should not give advantages to people just \nbecause you like them. You might occasionally want to reward a good player with \nextra Experience Traits, but do so only sparingly. You may also hand pick certain \npeople for specific roles, if you think that doing so will facilitate the story. \nQuash favoritism wherever you find it. First, step back and try to ask yourself if \nthere’s any truth to the accusation. If you have a g o d  Narrator who’s not just a yes- \nman, ask for an outside opinion. If you realize that you are actually playing favorites, \nthen you should stop. Chances are, if your relationship with someone is strained over \nafew imaginarypints inagame, thentherelationship wasn’t that strong tobeginwith. \nOn the other hand, if you’re not playing favorites, be sure to address the issue. \nYou don’t need a growing groundswell of player discontentment just because \npeople think that you’re playing favorites and ignoring complaints. Let the players \nknow that they’re heard, and explain your actions and considerations. \nPR~BLEIII \nPLAYERS: “HE‘S RUINING \nTHE Gmd” \nSome players are just freakishly successful at what they do. This isn’t all bad, \nbut if it hoards all the fun plots or stops other people from becoming involved, \nthe game starts to revolve around those players alone, which detracts from other \nplayers’ fun. In such a situation, you can forge an artificial balance again. Ask the \nplayers to step back a little and let some other people have fun too. \nIn other cases, you run afoul of the twink. Don’t hesitate to lay the smack down on \nplayers who really cause a problem. A little inter-player conflict is unavoidable, but it \nshouldn’tcausegrieforruinthegame. Makesurethatthere’sbasistotheaccusationsfirst. \nIf it’s just one personcomplaining, then it maybe aproblemgriper or someone who wound \nup losing out onaplot arc and who’s just dissatisfied. Ifyou hear lotsofcomplaints, chances \nare good that one player is a problem. Deal with it. That’s your job. \nA tough responsibility of the Storyteller is to deal with problem players whom \nyou otherwise like as people. You may really enjoy hanging out with your friend, and \nyou may respect him a lot, but if he’s wrecking the game, he’s got to go. There’s no \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nway around it. Players who are very charismatic and who manage to weasel their way \nout of consequences, intimidate everyone into following their orders, squash anyone \nin their way and ridicule those who don’t follow them eventually cause the game to \nblow up. They add to out-of-game problems as well by wrecking friendships over the \nwhole process. When you have a player calling the cops, making threats and abusing \nother players for some perceived game superiority, it doesn’t matter how much you \nlike the person as an individual or how good the excuses are. This person threatens \nthe integrity of the game and of real life, and he just has to go. \nLA& CBF CU~PABILPIY: “PLAYERS SHWLD PWCE \n,, \n$THER PLAYERS, NCBT ST~RYTELLERCHARACTERS. \nIn a word, wrong! Remember that consequences play a very important role \nin the game, just as they do in real life. A character who runs about doing stupid, \ndangerous or malicious things must feel the consequences of those actions. \nWhen characters don’t suffer the consequences, the players become cocky and \ntry to pull off too many stunts that could wreck the game. Plus, they start sliding \ninto bullying their way through everything. If there are no consequences for \nnegative acts, then they’ll throw morality out the window and do as they please. \nOne reason that mages don’t take over the world is that there are far too \nmany influential Sleepers. Mundane institutions can counter a mage’s influence \nor make his life hellish. Simple solutions often lead to bigger problems. It’s not \nmerely a matter of evading the police or erasing a few memories. A mage who \nwants to effect long-term change must manipulate social institutions to cause \nthe growth of desirable factors. \nNote also that there’s always someone bigger. The reason that cabals don’t \nall run on bullies who beat other mages into submission is that such bullies aren’t \ntolerated. If a Disciple decides that other people will do as he says or else, then \nit’s likely that an Adept (or even a rare Master) will take exception to his \nattitude. Spirits may also frown on him and refuse to cooperate. If several other \nmages find out, they’ll probably brand and ostracize him, and if he’s ever actually \nkilled someone for refusing to follow his orders, then he may himself be killed. \nIt is the Storyteller’s job to represent this balancing force, period. \nPlayers who say, “Well, other players should take care of all this policing in \nplay,” are really saying, “I should be allowed to get away with whatever I want if \nthe other people can’t catch me or don’t build twinky Trait-maximized characters \nto stop me.” Just as you, the Storyteller, represent all of the other factors and \npersonalities of the World of Darkness, so too do you represent the forces of \nconsequences and the mighty powers that keep dangerously maverick elements in \nbalance. Sure, it’s desirable to have a self-policing player system, but that’s not \nalways possible. Don’t hesitate to enforce the balance necessary to play. \nPolicing of this sort applies to abuse of the Spheres too. For instance, if a \nplayer insists that he can use ritual Correspondence to extend the range of his \nmagic and locate and kill every target he wants in the city, remind him gently \nthat other Adepts and Masters of Correspondence will surely notice such a feat. \nPoint out that they will probably intervene to discover what’s happening after \na few such castings. In some cases, the character will discover to his dismay that \nhis great plan is a threat to other, mightier mages, who show up to turn his magic \nawry or use his own methods against him. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCRCBSSCBVER \nHELL: ‘‘e \nCWRSE I C m  Turn A \nV ~ P I W  \nI ~ C B  \nA LWN \nCHAIR.” \nTo some degree, when you throw together multiple games, like tossing in \nsome Laws of the Night with Laws of Ascension, you get what you ask for. Each \ngame has a distinct theme and story angle, so they’re not meant to be mixed \ntogether so much. Generally, one should take the fore, and if other supernatural \ncreatures show up, they’re subplots and subordinate angles to the keystone game. \nBut some people want to run crossover games anyway. \nAs this writer has said before, you can do so if you want. You can also beat \nyour game to death with a stick. \nThere’s a lot of fun to be had in mixing the elements of the World of Darkness. \nAcknowledging the existence of other supernatural creatures makes for a more \nperilous game and a more precarious existence, especially since nobody knows \nwho’s right and who’s wrong. It can also make your game a mess because different \nrules have different scales, power systems and the like. There’s not any way to make \na “complete book of crossovers,” because there’s already so much going on in each \nseparate game that it’s nigh-impossible to cover every combination. \nSo, if you do decide to add multiple game elements together, it’s on your \nhead. However, you can do a few things to minimize problems. First, and it may \nseem obvious, make sure that your power scales are the same. For instance, if you \nuse old rules from Laws of the Hunt, you’ll discover that the power scales and \nhealth scales are different. Your people will be far too fragile unless you use the \ncompressed scale (p. 119) for everyone. Second, watch out for Super Friends \nsyndrome. Within five minutes of sticking two venues together, some enterpris- \ning group will come up with a way for the two to have some sort of truce or peace \ntreaty. You should be sure to enforce the reasons why various groups don’t get \nalong. The Master mage betrays the vampires or the elder werewolf punishes the \nyoung upstarts who have the gall to treat defilers of holy sites as buddies. \nDon’t hesitate to step in directly. Third, consider having Narrators who \nspecialize in each rule set. You may have a Narrator who knows vampires \nbackward and forward, but who doesn’t quite grasp the intricacies of the Spheres. \nHave the vampire players come to that Narrator for questions, and have all of \nthe crossover problems come to you. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nms in syncopation. \n“Any special plans?” Tiernan whispered. \nan feel it rearing down the natura \n“So what do we do?’ \nrhedusronrorheobjecr.

Any mage who walks among the Awakened \nfor long will learn quickly of the other beings that inhabit the World of Darkness. \nTHE TECHNKRACY \nThe Technocracy is chief among the adversaries of the Traditions. This \norder of philosopher-scientists originated from the paragons of reason in the \nRenaissance, but it evolved in the modem age into a loose global affiliation of \nfinanciers, scientists, doctors, researchers, explorers, engineers and bureaucrats. \nNow, all Technocrats are dedicated to the goal of removing the vestiges of \ndangerous randomness, chaos and terror from the world. \nAlthough the Technocracy started with a noble purpose, that purpose fell \nby the wayside as time marched on. The original founders of the Order of Reason \nintended to spare mankind the horrors of magical creatures, demons and \nsuperstitions by promoting repeatable technologies and gifts that everyone \ncould use. Over the centuries, though, the Union came to espouse the ideas of \ncontrol and order at any cost. The Technocracy initiated a Pogrom to seek out \nand destroy “dangerous, deviant, radical elements” like mages and mythical \ncreatures, while taking a shadowy influence over humanity at the same time in \nan attempt to guide mankind to some scientific apotheosis. \nFive Conventions make up the Technocracy, and each one oversees a \nspecific area of scientific endeavor. Unlike the Traditions, though, each \nConvention upholds the overall science and vision of the Union. The Conven- \ntion known as Iteration X, is a group that specializes in tool use, machine-man \ninterface and engineering, and it manipulates Forces. The New World Order is \na shadowy Convention of media representatives and political operatives who \ninfluence society using the Sphere of Mind. The Progenitors are doctors and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmedical technicians who pioneer cloning, genetic engineering and surgery \nthrough scientific applications of the Life Sphere. The Syndicate is a Conven- \ntion of financiers and enforcers who spread big business and the power of money \nby way of a refined sense of the Sphere of Entropy. The Void Engineers are hearty \nexplorers who chart the Earth and the depths beyond in space and alternate \ndimensions through an enlightened understanding of Correspondence. \nAlthough Technocrats seem, on the surface, to be highly advanced scientists, \nthey are actually Awakened mages. A Technocrat uses scientific methods and tools \nto achieve unbelievable results. However, few in the Union would ever pay credence \nto the notion. In their eyes, they are wholly different from their mystical adversaries. \nTechnocratic operatives function much like mages, and they even use \nSpheres, but their foci and justifications for their Effects are always scientific in \nnature. Because of the strength of their Union, Technocrats can access high levels \nof Backgrounds and get their hands on advanced scientific equipment. In recent \nyears, Technocrats have hunted Tradition mages with their terrifying coordina- \ntion and deductive skills, in order to exterminate them or reprogram them. \nIn addition to Technocratic operatives, the Union employs a small number \nof high-tech constructs such as cyborgs or bioengineered creatures. These beings \nare generally Paradoxical by nature, so they suffer Backlashes whenever they \nperform some vulgar feat due to their enhancements. For instance, a cyborg that \nopens up its torso to reveal a hidden chain gun is likely to find itself suffering \nmalfunctions because it has such a Paradoxical weapons system. However, such \nconstructs can be eerie and deadly hunters when they pursue Tradition mages. \n(To build a HIT Mark cyborg or a similar construct, use normal character \ncreation rules, then presume that the creation is modified to have permanent \nLife alterations to its Physical Traits, implanted heavy armor and perhaps even \na technologically concealed miniature chain gun or similar weapon.) \nFortunately for the Traditions, the Technocracy does not exercise com- \nplete control over human society. Rather, the Technocrats influence important \npolitical and economic decisions subtly, and they release their Enlightened \nScience to the Masses until it becomes an accepted (and non-Paradoxical) part \nof the everyday world. With the advent of the Reckoning, however, even the \nTechnocrats have found themselves out of touch with their former leaders. \nYoung Technocrats exhibit a range of personality archetypes from dire villains \nwho seek to stamp out all traces of mysticism and individuality, to lone heroes \nhoping to empower humanity and make the world safe. \nYou can build a Technocrat character like any other mage (including Spheres \nand Arete), but the character should not conceive of the mutable nature of reality ;1: \nlike a Tradition mage does. A Technocrat doesn't do magic, he performs advanced \n9 1  \nprocedures and applies Enlightened Science. Technocrats have different cosmetic \nterminology for many of their devices, procedures and Backgrounds, but they ' \nfunction game mechanically much like the mages of the Traditions. \n-. \n~ \nr€IARAmRs \nWhile most mages dance on the edge of creativity and inspiration, a few tumble \nover the precipice into wild chaos. Be it from some damage to the Avatar, a mystical \ncurse that strikes the Awakened or a severe Quiet that causes these mages to lose \ncontrol, none can say with certainty. Regardless, some mages simply cannot deal ' i!. \n,. 1 \n.* \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwith the magical world on even footing. They see monsters and mythical creations \neverywhere, and they inflict their madness anddynamismon the world without even \nreally trying. These dangerous willworkers are called Marauders. \nMarauders come in as many varieties as other mages. Indeed, it’s even \npossible for a normal mage to become a Marauder, although nobody truly \nunderstands the circumstances that might cause such a change. A Marauder \nmight seem like a totally normal and competent magician, only to reveal his \ninsanity a day later. Some Marauders slide through multiple personalities and \nmagical styles, while a few are stable and rational, and they would like nothing \nmore than to be free of the chaotic weirdness that their broken Avatars subject \nthem to. Some are completely unable to deal coherently with the real world, and \nthey retreat to the Umbra instead. \nA Marauder may have all the powers of a typical mage, and it’s rumored that \nthere may even be Marauder Oracles. However, every Marauder exists more or \nless in a permanent state of Quiet (see p. 174), and every Marauder has a \npermanent Quiet rating that reflects how deeply afflicted he is. What makes \nMarauders dangerous and powerful is the fact that they ignore any Paradox \nTraits they should accumulate from any magic use up to the level of their Quiet \nrating. For instance, a Marauder with a permanent Quiet of one ignores the first \nTrait of Paradox from any and every Effect he creates. Marauders with a \npermanent Quiet rating over five retreat to the Umbra, to represent the fact that \nthey have become incapable of dealing coherently with the real world. \nNEPHANDI \nThe dark mirror of Ascension is the dream of the Nephandi. Each Nephandus is a \nmage who perverts his Avatar and soul (if the two are truly sepamte things) in a sacrifice \nto dark powers. In return, the mage becomes an agent of primordial destructive forces. \nFew foes terrify and galvanize mages as much as the Nephandi. In the past, \nTechnocrats and Traditionalists have even worked side-by-side to fight Nephandi \nmenaces. The Nephandi not only wield strange perversions of the Spheres \n(called Qlipphothic magic), but they give up their senses of conventional \nmorality and Ascension in order to serve the whims of great, malevolent entities \nthat predate mankind. Perhaps foremost on many a mage’s thoughts, though, is \nthe realization that any mage can Fall and take the dark path of the Nephandi. \nFor their part, experienced Nephandi entice nake or embittered mages with \npromises of great power and a unity of vision with all who have Fallen before. Of \ncourse their way is right, they claim. They follow the wisdom of creatures that were \nancient before mankind even existed. Ofcourse the cosmos should end. All things \nmust, and it’s only natural that the Nephandi serve as agents to nurse it at its \nbedside until its demise. Of course there’s nothing wrong with demons and utter \ndarkness and death. They’ve all been around forever, so they must be part of the \nright and proper cycle of existence. Of course the Nephandi have everyone’s real \nand true best interests at heart, even if nobody realizes it. \nThe Nephandi come in many grades. Some young and foolish infernalists \nsell their potential to the outer primordial gods early, then find themselves \ntrapped in a cycle of destructiveness and servitude. Many of these Nephandi \nrevel in their power without consequences, and they becoming simple agents of \ndestruction and vice. The old and truly “enlightened” Nephandi, though, have \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\na deeper goal. They seek Descent, the destruction of the world and the return \nof the imperfect universe to the unformed void that predated the flaw of \ncreation. To this end, the Nephandi seduce, suborn, manipulate and influence \nboth mages and mortals in the name of reaching this goal. \nThe oldestNephandi exist for centuries or millennia, plotting to turn society into \na self-destructive morass of quashed hope and shattered idealism in order to showcase \nand encourage their nihilistic vision. Such tempters may be subtle enough to escape \nnotice for generations. Even if they are caught, they may simply vanish into the deeps \nof the Umbra for a time, only to re-emerge later when they will not be recognized. \nFortunately for humanity, Nephandi are both few in number and rare on \nEarth. The most common Earth-bound Nephandi are self-destructive, and they \ntend to bum themselves out quickly, taking as much as possible with them. The \nremainder usually resides out in twisted Umbral Realms or even in the deeps of \nthe Underworld, where they can ponder the mysteries of destruction and \nentropy or spread their malevolent influence subtly to other willworkers. \nNephandi serve a variety of dark overlords, and they draw their powers from \nthis servitude. Some Nephandi receive infernal taints that function as Paradox- \nfree capabilities equivalent to a single rote. In order to use these powers the \nNephandus must usually fulfill some pact, such as sacrificing 12 innocents at every \nnew moon. Others answer directly to the slumbering primordial things that hail \nfrom the very creation of the universe. These Nephandi use Qlipphothic versions \nof the regular Spheres. Nephandi generally have Traits equivalent to other mages, \nalthough their magic always carries a Qlipphothic Resonance regardless of the \nintent behind the Effect. Many subtle Nephandi take pains to conceal their \nResonance or rely as little as possible on magic when they are around other mages. \nNot everyone who practices magic is Awakened. Through the minor \npowers inherent in specific practices, tools, spirits and chants, some people \ndiscover the means to unlock the hidden mystic energies that survive even in the \nmodem World of Darkness. These sorcerers lack the flexibility and scope of \nAwakened mages, but they are no less than their enlightened cousins - \nboth \nperform magic in a world that would not deign to believe in it. \nSorcerers often serve in the Traditions alongside their Awakened cousins. \nIndeed, some go on to Awaken as well and learn the ways of more flexible, dynamic \nmagic, while others continue to practice more static paths. Few mages really see \nany difference between the two anyway. Anyone who practices magic is a \nmagician, after all, and every magician is an asset in the wake of the Reckoning. \nTherefore, sorcerers are no less viable as students of the occult than their \nAwakened counterparts, despite having a somewhat limited approach to magic. \nTypically, a sorcerer masters one or two rigid forms of magical power \nthrough long study and sacrifice. This magic resembles some Traditional (or \neven Technocratic) form - \na sorcerer might use prayer, spirit invocation, \nchants and gestures or even technological tools - \nand indeed, the foci of many \nTraditions match the practices that still hold power for sorcerers. Sorcerers \ndevelop certain repeatable skills (not unlike rotes), but the difference is that the \nsorcerer does not have the Awakened ability to reshape the Tellurian around his \nwhims. Rather, the sorcerer knows a few threads to pull in order to make the \n..-*- \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTapestry react. A sorcerer can rely on only the magic that remains in the world \nin static forms, not create new and spectacular feats to blaze a visionary trail. \nA sorcerer character is essentially a human being with a certain limited \nunderstanding of magic. See Laws of the Hunt for more information about such \ncharacters. A sorcerer has 6/4/3 Attribute Traits, 3 Ability Traits and 3 Back- \ngrounds, plus 7 Free Traits and 5 levels of various magical Paths. A sorcerous Path \noften resembles a limited application of one Sphere. For instance, a sorcerer could \nstudy separate Paths to create fire, manipulate kinetic energy or control light, \nwhile an Awakened mage can do all the same and more with Forces. \nBYGCBNES \nFaerie tales and myths regale us with stories of unicorns, dragons and griffins, \nand most people consider these tales nothing more than pleasant or frightening \nflights of fancy. Mages know better, however. Such creatures did and do exist, \nalthough they are rarer now in the modern age than in their ancient heyday. Because \nthey have long since vanished from Earth to reside in far.off Realms or hidden \ncomers of the world where nobody visits, these beasts are commonly called Bygones. \nWhile vampires, shapeshifters and similar creatures remain hidden among the \nmasses of humanity (perhaps because they so strongly resemble humans), Bygones \nfind the stifling weight of reality disorienting and disabling. Many wither and die \nunder the combined fdrces of Paradox and Unbelief. Still, a mage might summon \nsuch a creature from the depths of the Umbra for a limited time. Such conjurations \nare difficult to perform, but they can certainly throw an adversary for a loop. \nBygones come in as many forms as there are legends that spawned them, and \na Bygone can have whatever Traits someone might expect of it. There are \nunicorns with horns that heal by touch, dragons that breathe gouts of flame, \ngriffins that fly and sphinxes that whisper mysterious riddles. A sphinx might \nhave strong Attributes and a great deal of the Enigmas Ability, while a dragon's \nmagic and skills would best all but the most heroic ofhumans. A Bygone's powers \nare innate, and they usually don't cause Paradox, but the existence of the Bygone \nitself is Paradoxical on Earth. Bygones suffer damage slowly (about a level a day) \nunless they have magical energy to offset this decay and strengthen their \nPatterns. For this reason, the few Bygones that do stay on Earth usually lair in \nNodes or other places where they can find Quintessence easily. \nSome Bygones arise as expressions of urban legends as well. Things like the \nchupacabra and the dead man with the hook for a hand have their place in dark \ni. pi comers of secluded wilderness or decrepit city areas. \nHUNTERS \nt \nAlthough they are uncommon, some few humans see a threat in the \nsupernatural and decide to take upon themselves the burden of protecting \nhumanity from it. Because of the subtlety of coincidental magic, most careful \nmages have little to fear from such zealots, but the occasional blast of vulgar \nmagic might attract the attention of just the wrong sort of person. \nHunters come in many varieties. The least dangerous or organized are \nusually those individuals who have a wrenching, traumatic experience with the \nsupernatural and take up the job. Religious groups and government agencies that \nR\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\norganize and train specifically to deal with paranormal situations are on the \nother end of the spectrum. A few hunters learn to use strange powers of their \nown, studying sorcery or the like to combat the perceived evils of the supernatu- \nral. Most simply rely on their wits and whatever tools are at hand. \nLone, disorganized hunters are rarely much of a threat. Such individuals might be \nvindictive crusaders, obsessed stalkers or maybe victims who want revenge on the \ncreatures thatwrongedthem. These hunterscome fromany jobsandbackgrounds. The \nperson caught in a mage’s vulgar blast of fire or who witnesses the summoning of a spirit \nmight well become a hunter, seeking out the mage to destroy him.. . or study him. \nThe most fearsome hunter group is probably the Inquisition. Although no \nchurch condones these zealots’ behavior officially, small splinter factions of \nvarious religious groups receive covert funding and training specifically to destroy \n“heretics.” For most Inquisitors, the prime targets are vampires, demons and other \ncreatures of darkness. Some, however, consider magic to be evil, or they take \numbrage at the beliefs of groups like the Celestial Chorus and Akashic Brother- \nhood. Inquisitors range from fresh-faced young priests to hardened mercenaries. \nAll carry weapons supplied by their church orders when they go on the hunt, and \na few are even full-time professionals. Most disturbingly, a disproportionate \nnumber of Inquisitors display True Faith and its concomitant resistance to magic. \nThe most scholarly hunters make up a secretive organization known as the \nArcanum, which is dedicated to the collection of occult knowledge. Quite a few \nArcanum scholars are also sorcerers, although there have been no Arcanum \nmembers to date who are also Traditionalists. The Arcanum rarely seems directly \ndangerous. Members catalog and classify information, and they may even be \ninclined to trade useful information with mages. However, many have strong \nopinions on how magic should work, and they may cause problems for mages who \ndon’t adhere to those opinions. Thankfully, Arcanum members are charged only \nto watch, not to interfere, so they almost never pose a physical threat. \nIn various government agencies, the Technocracy has fostered special project \ngroups to deal with supernatural occurrences. Such groups come under a great deal \nof scrutiny, but they also gather quite a bit of backing as long as they’re in favor. \nOne ritual murder or camera-caught vulgar display of magic can mobilize the FBI’s \nSpecial Affairs Division rapidly, and it can bring to bear all the weight of anational \ngovernment. A few government hunter agencies such as Japan’s Strike Force Zero \neven bring minor cybernetics or cutting-edge weapons to bear when they hunt. \nThese government-sponsored hunters often have inaccurate information, but \nthis can make them all the more dangerous. An agent who believes that all mages \nhave some sort of mystical defense shield is likely to employ very heavy force. \nLastly, a new class of hunters has recently risen to prominence. Since the \n‘1 \nbeginning of the Avatar Storm and the events of the Reckoning, some humans \nhave displayed heretofore unknown supernatural powers and abilities to hunt ‘ \ndown other beings. Some mages argued at first that these humans were untrained \nOrphans or humans who had been possessed by spirits. Time, however, has \nshown that these Imbued hunters have a specific range of capabilities, as if some \nforce had suddenly chosen all of them deliberately for a mission of hunting. \nThe Imbued usually have the power to see through illusions and recognize \nsupernatural beings for what they are. Even those who don’t understand what \nmages are know that something separates willworkers from the rest of humanity. \n= \n1 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nWhile these hunters do also stock up on weapons and tools for their inspired \nmission, most also have asmall array of paranormal Paradox-free powers. They can \ndo anything from healing rapidly to conjuring flame around weapons to halting \nothers in their tracks with a simple spoken phrase. Imbued hunters who survive for \na while, however, become more and more likely to go insane. Eventually the hunt \nconsumes them until they can no longer function as normal people. \nSee Laws of the Hunt for creation rules of hunter characters. Most will be \nnormal humans, with 6/4/3 Attributes, 3 Abilities, 3 Backgrounds and 7 Free Traits. \nTHE U N W  \nEven though the Technocracy holds to the conceit that it shapes human \ndestiny and the Traditions argue that they're the last bastion of mysticism in a \nworld gone mad, neither one is entirely correct. Other beings do hide among \nhumanity and influence the course of mankind. Chief among these beings are \nthe undead, those who exist for millennia and see humanity itself as prey or a \nplaything for amusement and personal gain - \nvampires. \nMagesandvampires havecoexisted-and \ninmany cases fought-since \ntime \nimmemorial. The willworkers often protect or advance humanity, whether out of \naltruism or self-interest. Conversely, vampires must feed from humans, and they \nencourage stasis so as to keep the world familiar. The two lifestyles aren't \nirreconcilable, but they are usually at odds. Most mages quickly recognize vampires \nfor the bloodsucking predators they are and avoid them. Vampires often see mages \nas dangerously powerful and either stay away or try to manipulate them. \nA vampire survives by feeding on the blood of the living. Some rare ones \nsubsist on animal blood, but human prey is more substantive. The vampire must \noften indulge in all manner of monstrosity to feed this hunger. Since a vampire \nis an ambulatory corpse, though, it derives no pleasure or sustenance from food, \nsex or the like. Only blood and the intellectual satisfactions of social maneuver- \ning and vendettas give the undead any gratification. Emotion and hope die when \nth\"e vampire becomes what it is, and all that's left is a paranoid predator that fears \nits own kind or its death at the hands of humans. \nHowever, most vampires still seek out peers to fill their otherwise hollow \nexistence. As a result, they often come across as sensual, charismatic or charming, \nbut this appearance is only a thin veneer. Scratch the surface and only a monster \nlies beneath. A few vampires try to hang on to their human consciences, but the \nuhcontrollable hungers to which they are heir cause this humanity to drop away \nwith the years. The eldest vampires are little more than amoral cannibals. \nVampires are most important to mages because of the historical Massasa \nWar and the fact that one early House of the Order of Hermes turned to \nvampirism during the Dark Ages. What happened to the mages of this House \nremains shrouded in mystery, however, because the newly undead magicians hid \nthemselves among the society of the vampires. A century of warfare between the \nOrder and that betrayer House resulted only in many casualties on both sides, \nleaving mages with little understanding of how vampirism actually works. The \nI \nmost prominent fact that the survivors took away from that war is the horrifying \nrevelation that any mage could become avampire. All avampire has to do to pass \nI e on his curse is drain a person entirely of blood then feed the corpse some of its \na s &  \nI ,  I a undead blood. In a matter of minutes, the recently deceased person will have \n: \nI - , *  \n8\n.\n \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nbecome one of the undead himself. Mages who know of the undead fear this fate, \nfor the curse of vampirism destroys the Avatar and with it any ability to work \nAwakened magic. \nComplete rules for vampires appear in Laws of the Night. For your games, \nyou can assume the following: \nA vampire uses Blood Traits to fuel its mystical powers and to remain \nanimate. The vampire takes this blood by biting mortals (which causes a sort of \nsupernatural ecstasy so that the subject doesn’t resist) and drinking their blood. \nA Blood Trait can be used to activate a vampire power, to gain a Physical Trait \nfor a scene or to heal a health level of non-aggravated damage. \nSince they’re essentially nothing more than dead bodies, bashing damage has \nlittle effect on vampires. Furthermore, vampires suffer only bashing damage from \nbullets. They heal two health levelsofbashing damage withone BlccdTrait. Vampires \ndon’t age, and theyrarely sufferfromdiseaseorpoison. Ifthey arescarredor cosmetically \naltered one evening, they change back the next night when they rise from slumber. \nAvampire usually has asmall a m y  ofsupernatural powers. Some can command \nothers or influence emotions, much like they’re using a Mind Effect. Others can grow \nclawsor call upon phenomenal strength, as if they had used aLife Effect. Assign a young \nvampire three rotes; each rote costs one Blood Trait to use. Vampires don’t understand \nor have access to the Spheres, though. Their powers stem from their cursed blood. \nIf a wooden stake penetrates a vampire’s heart, the unfortunate monster \nis paralyzed. An attacker can try to stake the vampire deliberately with a \nsharpened chunk of wood or a spear by winning or tying two Simple Tests after \na hit. If the attacker succeeds on both tests, the vampire cannot move or use its \npowers until the offending weapon is removed. \nVampires cannot function during the day. Sunlight burns them, and the \narrival of the day itself makes them extremely drowsy. As a general rule, vampires \nsleep all day unless they find themselves under extreme duress. If they are \nexposed to sunlight, the vampire takes an aggravated level of damage every turn. \nVampires can turn human beings into their servitors. A vampire simply \nfeeds a living human a bit of its blood, which grants the person some of the \nvampire’s power as well. These subjects are called ghouls, and they are usually \nfanatically loyal to their masters. Anyone who drinks the blood of a specific \nvampire three times finds himself mystically compelled to love that creature. A \nghoul can refresh its Strength-based Physical Traits once per day at no cost, and \nit doesn’t age as long as it receives vampire blood once per month. \nSince a vampire is a corpse, any spell designed to alter its Pattern must \ninclude Matter as well as Life. \nTHE \nCHANGING \nBREEDS \nBe they stories of the loup-garou of Europe, the nine-tailed foxes of Japan or the \ncoyote shifters of Native America, tales of men who change into animals (or vice- \nversa) are ubiquitous throughout the world. In the World of Darkness, such creatures \nlive among humanity and animals alike. They are children of nature and students \nof spirit, but they are also warriors with fearsome animal prowess and predatory \ninstincts. They are dangerously wild creatures that protect the dwindling natural \nspaces fervently and possess myriad powers that they inherited from spirits. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nMages know little of the shapeshifters, since dealing with them often proves \ndangerous. Many shapeshifters consider mages to be arrogant and treacherous, and \nthey attack as soon as they identify a willworker. Even those inclined to speak rather \nthan do battle tend to treat mages with great suspicion. For their part, the mages with \nthe most contact withshapeshifters are those who work outside the cities. Verbena and \nDreamspeakers in particular have long-standing ties with the shifters, and those mages \nwho travel the Umbra mention that shapeshifters go into the spirit worlds as well. \nShapeshifters appear to have their own sub-culture, even though many of \nthem coexist with humans. Many seem to venerate the forces of nature \nreligiously and practice some form of shamanism or ancestor-worship. Natural \nspirits do communicate with the shifters and treat them favorably. Shapeshifters \noften have both human and animal relatives. Apparently, their families extend \ninto both groups, and some shapeshifters clearly stem more from an animal \nheritage than from a human one. (Those who do have difficulties with human \nlanguages, and they have a hard time understanding and using technology.) \nTnemostknowledgeableDreamspkerslndicatethat \nalthoughtherarewerewolves \nseem to predominate among shapeshifters, other types of animal shifters also exist, \nincludingwildcats, coyotesandravens. Regardless of its breed, eachshapeshiftercan take \non several forms ranging from human to animal to mixed forms in-between, and they all \nhave various gifts that mimic the Charms of spirits. In their hybrid forms, they temfy \nnormal humans, and they have phenomenal battle capabilities. \nMages who stumble accidentally into the wrong parts of the wilderness may \nrun afoul of hostile shapeshifters. The shifters protect their territory religiously, \nand they consider their holy sites too sacred for normal humans to profane with \ntheir presence. The shifters venerate these natural Nodes, and drive out any \nmages who would seek their power. \nSee Laws of the Wild for more complete information regarding shapeshifters. \nFor your games, you can assume the following: \nA shapeshifter has three forms: A human form, an animal form and a \nhybrid battle-form. In battle form, the shifter doubles its normal human Physical \n, Traits. In animal form, the creature has superhuman senses that are equivalent \nto the enhanced perceptions of Apprentice-level Life magic. Changing forms \nrequires one turn. In its battle form, the shifter terrifies normal humans. People \nflee automatically, and they try to blank out or forget about the experience. \nShapeshifters heal rapidly. A shifter heals one health level of non-aggravated \ndamage every single turn. However, silver causes aggravated damage to them. \nA shapeshlfter can move quickly enough to take two actions per turn in combat. \nA shifter can use various spiritual Gifts to perform magical feats. Give \neach shifter the equivalent of any three Apprentice-, Initiate- or Disciple-level \nrotes. Older shifters, or those who are shamans and students of the occult, will \nhave more. Gnosis, the shifter’s spiritual wisdom, powers these Gifts. Young \nshifters may have one to three Gnosis Traits; old, wise shifters have up to 10. \nShapeshifters can step physically into the Umbra by spending a turn \n’ ‘ \n~ \nlooking into a reflective surface. They can then peek back out by concentrating, \nI ’ and they may step out of any reflective surface back to the material world. They \n’ e don’t suffer from the effects of the Avatar Storm when they cross the Gauntlet, \nI ’* but they don’t often go to the same Umbral places that mages frequent. \n~ \n~ \n‘ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSince shapeshifters are creatures of spirit rather than just animals and \nhumans, any magic that would alter ashifter’s Pattern must use Spirit as well as Life. \nTHE \nRESTLESS \nD m  \nEuthanatos have long known that the cycle of life doesn’t always let go of \na soul easily. Even since before Orpheus’ legendary journey into the Under- \nworld, people have seen ghosts and haunts, venerated their ancestors and dwelt \non the questions of existence after death. Mages know that life after death is not \njust speculation - \nin the World of Darkness, it’s often a fact. \nNot every person who dies becomes a ghost, but for those with great passion, a need \nto complete something or an overwhelming drive to survive, death may not be an end. \nThese wraiths inhabit the Underworld or Dark Umbra, a spiritual place of death and \ndecay. They pursue their leftover ambitions there, often looking in on the mortal world \nor sometimes even seeking a new lease on the life they left behind. Attached by need to \noldplacesorpeople, thesehauntingmemoriessometimes intersectwithlost pasions and \noccasionally even manifest to experience a moment of life-indeath. \nPlaces like graveyards and abandoned old houses tend to attract ghosts, \nbecause the Gauntlet between living and dead is difficult to cross. Few ghosts \nhave the power to manifest in the physical world, so they often hang around in \nplaces where death is strong and the barriers are thin. The Reckoning has blown \ngreat spiritual storms across the Underworld, and places of sanctuary are rare. \nNow, wraiths congregate in the few safe havens left for their kind. \nOld ghosts often retreat into the depths of the deadlands where they find \nislands of memory, places that never were and storms that rage over a dark ocean \nof death. A mage might traipse into these lands once or twice, but traveling the \npaths of the dead is a heroically foolish journey that is fraught with peril. Perhaps \nthe dead are best left to their own devices.. . . Certainly the mages who deal with \nthem often commonly learn to regret it. \nFor more information about wraiths, see Oblivion. For your games, you can \nassume the following: \nWraiths are typically immaterial. They exist in the Dark Umbra, which \nreflects the memories of the material world in a dead, decaying state, and it hides \nothers beyond. Wraiths usually can’t touch the material world without effort, \nbut they are also immune to most physical attacks. \nA wraith‘s power stems from Pathos, the emotional strength of its \nmemories. Wraiths are drawn to events that mirror their strongest desires, and \nthey gain Pathos from them. \nWraiths can perform tricks in the material world such as creating sudden \nchills, making walls drip blood, creating haunting voices, possessing living beings \nand even materializing briefly. Performing these tricks requires the use of a Pathos \nTrait, and they function similar to Mind possession or hallucination Effects. \nEven if a wraith is damaged with Spirit magic or physical attacks while it \nis materialized, it can only be banished at most. Only aggravated damage (say, \nfrom spiritual fire or Prime-based attacks) will destroy a wraith permanently. \nOtherwise, the ghost may be banished for a month, but it will return eventually. \nWraiths have Traits and health levels like other characters, although they \nusually can’t use their Physical Traits except against each other or against mages \n1 ‘r’: \nI \n1, \nI’ \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nfoolish enough to enter the Dark Umbra. A wraith suffers no penalties for injury, \nand it can heal one level of non-aggravated damage with a Pathos Trait. \nSince they’re ghosts, wraiths can only be affected by magic that includes \nSpirit, unless they manifest physically or the mage goes to the Underworld. \nTHE FAE \nModern fairy tales tell about shining knights and floating castles, faerie \nprincesses and wicked goblins. However, older stories of the Fair Folk make them \nout to be creatures that play malicious games with humanity, steal away children \nand devour them or ruin crops and kingdoms for their own entertainment. As \nit happens, the latter tales are closer to the truth. Although the days of faerie \nkingdoms are long gone, much like the ancient times of powerful magician-lords \nand philosopher-kings, some remnants of the fae remain behind. Clothed in \nhuman flesh, and given only vague hints as to their true nature, these mortal \ndescendants of the fae are called changelings. \nChangelings resemble humans upon casual inspection. Indeed, they’re indis- \ntinguishable from most people. It’s the presence of the faerie soul that makes the \ndifference. To others of its kind, a changeling’s true faerie nature -be \nit a blue- \nskinned troll, a gorgeous noble or a twisted monster that lurks in shadow - \nis \napparent. Indeed, changelings seem to carry with them a whole host of imaginary, \ndream-like creations, from invisible pets to intangible swords that only they can see. \nMost changelings seem content to exist in their fantasy world and balance \nit with the needs of their normal human lives. They sponsor endeavors of art, \ncreativity and imagination, because dreams fuel and fire them. Changelings \noften exhibit a host of natural powers or magical illusions that are related to \ntrickery, travel and illusion. \nMages find changelings a difficult lot to deal with. While the two groups are \nnot inherently hostile toward one another, the changelings are protected by a \nphenomenon known as the Mists. Those who experience faerie enchantments \ntend to forget them later, which has given rise to the stories of people who have \nbeen captured by changelings and who disappeared for 10 years, only to return \nunaged with little more than hazy memories of a few nights’ revels. Even mages \nare subject to this phenomenon. A mage who is enchanted to experience the \nmass-dream of changelings often forgets much of it once the enchantment ends. \nOnly those with the presence of mind to write down their experiences have a \nchance at remembering and deciphering the strange ways of the fae. \nSee The Shining Host for more about changelings. For now, you can assume: \nA changeling seems perfectly normal and human, but it actually has a \ndream-like faerie form that only those who have been enchanted with fae power \nor who are using highly specialized magic can perceive. This “fae seeming” shows \nthe changeling’s true nature. \nChangelings crave Glamour, the energy of raw imagination, creativity \nand wonder. This energy flows freely from artists and craftsmen, so many \nchangelings frequently patronize them. \nA changeling usually has several faerie powers relating to illusions, befuddling \nthe senses or moving about quickly. Treat these powers as Disciple-level Mind or \nCorrespondence Effects. Each use of such a power costs one Glamour Trait. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nChangelings have Traits and health just like regular human beings. However, \ntheir dream-weapns inflict a sort of imaginary damage on one another that is just as \neffective on other changelings as real weapons are on normal humans. Normal people \ncan neither see nor feel such imaginary weapons, but a changeling who is “killed” by \nsuch a weapon falls into a coma and forgets that he is actually a changeling. \nCold iron - \nraw, unalloyed, unworked iron - \ninflicts extreme pain and \naggravated wounds on a changeling. If a changeling is killed by a cold iron \nweapon (often, a crudely worked and ugly thing, that lacks any Glamour), his \nsoul is snuffed forever. \nIn some circumstances, changelings can actually step into imaginary \ndream-worlds, and disappear from the material world. Doing so isn’t exactly the \nsame as entering the Umbra, and changelings who “walk the Dreaming” are \ndifficult to follow. They can take paths to many places and to many fantastic \nimaginary locations, though. \nA changeling suffers when exposed to boredom, stark rationality and the \nabsence of creative, imaginative energy. Technocrats in particular cause this \npain to the fae, but excessively regimented, boring, static individuals of any sort \ncan do so as well. \nChangelings can use Glamour to enchant someone briefly, causing that \nperson to see the fae dreamworld and true forms. To do so, the changeling must \nspend a Trait of Glamour and either touch the intended victim or give the person \na gift. The person experiences the changeling world for a scene or hour. At the end __ \nof this time, the Mists wipe away memories, leaving only hazy recollections. \nE \nChangelings protect special strongholds called freeholds where they can \nstep into fantasy spaces that adjoin locations in the real world. They collect \nnatural Glamour in freeholds, and they do not age while they remain inside. \nWorking magic on changelings is pretty much like working magic on humans, \nunless the mage wants to affect the imaginary changeling world. Doing so requires \nMind and Spirit as well. Plus, most mages will never be able to study changelings well \nenough to figure out a way to affect the dreamworld because of the Mists. \n‘, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCHANGING \nBREEDS 26F \nATINBUR LI~~IITATICBNS \nI 2 3  \n~“TALTRAI‘TS \n92 \nPHYSICALTRPSTS \n88 \nSKIALTRAITS \n9 0  \nNmm€ I“TAL \nTMS \n93 \nN-TIVE \nPHYSICAL TRAIT’S 89 \n< BACKGRWNDS I02 \nCHALLENGES \nI82 \nCCBI”LICATICBNS \nI84 \n~ N U S T W S  I88 \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCHALLENGE \nSPEEDS I83 \nQRDER @F CHALLENGES \nI88 \n~~VWIDDING 18s \nR E L E ~ G  \n187 \nSI~PLE \nTESTS I86 \nSAnC CHALLENGES 18s \nIN~ALBID I83 \nRCECK+V~R~CISSCBRS \nI84 \nUSINGTWS I82 \nmCBB SCENE I88 \nADVANTAGES 39 \nASSIGNING SPECIALTY SPHEMS F? \nCHWSINGABmB 3? \nCHWSING BACKGRWNDS 80 \nCHmSING ATTRIBUTB 38 \nA ~ W € .
