At last the supernatural denizens of the World of Darkness find\nthemselves confronted with the End Times that they have long viewed through\nprophecy and shadow. Some answer with courage, others with cowardice, but all are\ncalled to an ultimate accounting for everything they have done. The signs are on fire,\nboth epic and intimate events unfold, and no one will walk away from this one\nunchanged — if they walk away at all.\nBefore we go into the details of what is contained within, however, let me tell\nyou a secret:\nThese words were written during a hurricane.\nIt seems only too fitting that as I sat down to compose an introduction to the\nbook that brings an end to Mind’s Eye Theatre, a book devoted to disasters and\nupheaval of all kinds, an actual disaster raged outside. A coincidence like that in\nfiction would be deemed implausible, but there it was. It’s little moments like that,\nwhere the two worlds seem almost too close together for comfort, that make many\nlongtime World of Darkness visitors pause… and then smile as they realize just how\nmuch a part of themselves and their worldview it has become.\nEndings are never easy. Only at the last minute do we ever realize just how much\nremains unsaid and undone, how many more twists and turns we were expecting before\nreaching our destination. Many of us have found best friends or even spouses through these\ngames, and all of us have stories that we never tire of telling. But without an ending, a story\nis a thing incomplete, for ultimately the conclusion puts the rest of the tale into perspective.\nEven if only our imaginations tell us what transpires following the “happily ever after,” we’re\nstill more content for having been given leave to take the story in the direction we desire.\nThis book isn’t about endings, it’s about the entire story so far, what all the characters\nhave laughed, cried and bled for will ultimately mean when they face the greatest test of their\nabilities. More than just a rote translation of the Time of Judgment tabletop series — though\nGehenna, Apocalypse, Ascension and Time of Judgment certainly offer additional useful\nINTRODUCTION:\nTHE SIGNS\nARE ON FIRE\nTo absent friends, lost loves, old gods, and the season of mists;\nand may each and every one of us always give the Devil his due.\n—Hob Gadling, Sandman: A Season of Mists\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

It also details how the brave souls of Laws of the Hunt react as their\nchosen enemies are destroyed — or emerge stronger than ever.\nChapter Two: Gehenna confronts the vampires of Laws of the Night with\ntales of elders rising, cities crumbling and what is a blessing as well as their greatest\nfear: the end of the Curse of Caine.\nChapter Three: Apocalypse heads to the front lines of the Final Battle to save\nGaia, as the were-creatures of Laws of the Wild, Hengeyokai and the Changing\nBreeds series make their last stand.\nChapter Four: Ascension centers around the mages of Laws of Ascension and\ntheir desperate efforts to reach enlightenment before reality calcifies into faceless\nstasis — or unravels into nothingness.\nChapter Five: Endless Winter places the fae of The Shining Host at the heart\nof stories involving fantastic quests, deadly intrigue, terrifying monsters, and the\nhardest task of all: keeping hope alive.\nChapter Six: Reckoning pushes the imbued of Laws of the Reckoning to their\nlimits, as their strange destiny is revealed and the supernatural makes a last push for\ncontrol — or destruction.\nChapter Seven: The Sixth Age travels to the courts of the Kuei-jin vampires\nof Laws of the East as ancient karmic debts are collected and the Demon Emperor\nat last ascends its throne.\nChapter Eight: Armageddon concerns the undying mummies of Laws of the\nResurrection and their noble struggle to return Balance to the universe before it is\nconsumed by its own darkness.\nChapter Nine: Doomsday descends one last time into the dark Underworld of\nOblivion, where a great war and greater storm of the dead combine to change the\nnature of the afterlife forever.\nChapter Ten: Revelations presents material that a Storyteller can apply to any\nkind of End-Times chronicle. From advice on structuring the final plots for maximum\nimpact to troubleshooting difficult scenarios to creating props that help the players feel\nas though they are truly experiencing the End Times, it’s all here and ready for use.\nAlthough these chapters are already packed with information concerning the\nTime of Judgment and how a Storyteller can best bring it to life for her players, the\nmost powerful resource for any chronicle is reading these lines at this very moment.\nNo matter what might be written on one of these pages, what matters most is what\nthe Storyteller feels will be best for her chronicle. Period.\nSo whether this volume comes at the end of a long-running chronicle or sparks\na brand new beginning, remember always that Laws of Judgment — like all Mind’s\nEye Theatre books — is about your stories and the direction you want to take them.\nNothing says that your stories can’t go on as long as you desire just because our world\nis ending. Indeed, it’s in your hands now more than ever.\nFor all of you over the years who have made Mind’s Eye Theatre great, all the\ncountless chronicles and legions of wonderful Storytellers, players and Narrators —\nthank you. None of these stories would be possible without you.\nLet the final show begin.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

A chronicle of the End Times\nmust take into account the reactions of these powerless masses who might never realize\nthat events are happening around them that will cause an end to everything they know.\nTheir stories, in many ways, bring home the true horror of the World of Darkness.\nAt first, only a few perceptive individuals notice that the world is getting stranger, day\nby day. Doomsayers and devout believers in the “end of the world” see signs in news reports\nof natural and man-made calamities. They see it in escalating political tension and acts of\nterrorism. They see it in outbreaks of bizarre diseases that reach pandemic proportions and\nin the general malaise that accompanies the feeling that things are falling apart.\nScientists also suspect that the perfect world of natural law is not quite as\npredictable as they would like it to be. Astronomers notice evidence of “activity” in\nthe asteroid belt or speculate about the likelihood of another cosmic collision similar\nto the one that drove the dinosaurs to extinction. Geologists worry about increasing\nseismic activity between the tectonic plates. Pathologists question the growing\nstrains of anomalous tissue samples collected from victims of violent crimes. These\nindividuals wonder at the proliferation of chaos in the world around them.\nOthers, those mortals who rarely deviate from their daily routine either\nrationalize, ignore or misunderstand the supernatural, hardly noticing the truth —\nthat all things are coming to a close.\nMostly, though, the mortals merely die.\nON J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT D\n D\n D\n D\n DA Y\nA Y\nA Y\nA Y\nA Y\nFor most mortals, the end comes without warning.

Others\nsee the chaos that precedes the events of the End Times as an excuse for their\nanarchistic tendencies, sparking waves of looting and rioting that might be enough\nto topple governments and cause a total breakdown of society.\nUnless they have overt proof of the existence of vampires, werewolves or other\nsupernatural creatures, most humans never even suspect that their world is ending as a\nfulfillment of a prophecy or the culmination of an age-long struggle that is not even theirs.\nThis is the background of terror and incomprehension against which the stories\nof the end play themselves out in the arena of live-action roleplaying.\nWelcome to the end of the world.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E I I I I INQUISITION\nNQUISITION\nNQUISITION\nNQUISITION\nNQUISITION\nSince its beginning in the 11th century, the Inquisition has waged war against\nthe enemies of the Church. During the course of its existence, it has searched out and\ndestroyed heretics, witches and other groups labeled as evil or undesirable. In the\npresent, the secular Inquisition — otherwise known as the Society of Leopold,\ncontinues to wage war against the supernatural. Drawing upon the power of faith and\nmodern weaponry, Inquisitors pit themselves against vampires and other supernaturals.\nWhile the Inquisition provides a good source of antagonists for most live-action\ngames set in the World of Darkness, it is particularly suited to games involving\nvampires and using rules from Laws of the Night and Laws of the Hunt.\nHow will these determined hunters of the supernatural react to the realization\nthat their world is coming to an end at the hands of those they hunt? As a Storyteller,\nyou should consider several alternative scenarios that can affect the actions of your\nInquisition characters, whether they are player-controlled or Storyteller characters.\n• Wormwood: This scenario provides the Inquisition few opportunities to affect its\noutcome, as the few Chosen vampires who are destined to potentially redeem themselves\nare hiding, protected, inside an old church they call Sanctuary. Apparently, this refuge was\ncreated by nothing less than divine power. While they can leave of their own free will, those\nwho do so suffer hideous, agonizing death within days, and none who leave can re-enter.\nInquisition agents are likely to encounter these events only if they are hot on\nthe trail of a target who slips into Sanctuary as the zero hour approaches, which\nleaves the Storyteller with a few options. If they are allowed to enter Sanctuary, they\nfind themselves surrounded by a number of frightened and angry vampires. While\na powerful (and beatific) vampire known as Ferox prevents bloodshed on either side,\nbeing trapped with these creatures for their 40 nights of trial and temptation can\nmake for an incredibly intense roleplaying experience.\nAlternatively, the Inquisition might also surround the Sanctuary and wait to\nsee what happens, making sure that none of the creatures escape. This scenario is\nvery similar to what’s happening within, as the Inquisitors witness strange phenom-\nena but cannot leave or risk dereliction of duty.\n• Fair Is Foul: This scenario involves earth-shaking events for the vampiric\ncommunity that largely escape mortal notice until the very end. Even the most\nvigilant Inquisitors aren’t likely to piece together the entirety of what is happening\n— or be able to comprehend the enormity of what they are seeing if they do.\nThis scenario begins as any other assignment might, with the characters assigned\nto investigate some evidence of powerful vampiric activity. As Lilith’s personal vendetta\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Some\nof Caine’s faithful might exploit the animus placed on the “Lilith heresy” and leak\ninformation to members of the Society of Leopold in order to use the Inquisitors as a\nmeans of injuring or distracting her followers at a critical moment. At the same time, one\nor more of Lilith’s trusted followers might try to manipulate the Inquisition into attacking\na group of younger vampires who are seeking to defeat her plans. Staying alive requires\nmore than just a strong arm or steady Faith — it will force the Inquisitors to stay ahead\nof the ancient schemes that threaten to swallow them whole.\nIn the end, some of the most powerful vampires in existence destroy one\nanother, and for all its knowledge and tenacity, the Inquisition’s role in this event\nis mostly that of inadvertent witness or deluded pawn. Then again, perhaps both\nCaine and Lilith have forgotten the true power of God’s wrath, as made manifest in\nHis chosen agents…\n• Nightshade: When the existence of vampires becomes public knowledge, the\nmortal world reacts with expected outrage, fear, panic and — ultimately — violence.\nThe Inquisition, of course, has known for centuries that vampires and other minions\nof Hell exist. Now, it appears, the Inquisitors’ stance against the monsters of the\nnight is justified. But what do they do about it?\nAs global organizations and governments topple with the realization that they\nare not the ultimate authority on Earth, members of the Inquisition might find\nthemselves thrust into the limelight as the last defenders of the human race with the\nknowledge and the means to destroy the predatory vampires. For the Society of\nLeopold, the emergence of vampires into the public eye is a mixed blessing — and\npossibly more of a hindrance than a boon.\nThe results might be somewhat different from what the Inquisition bargained\nfor. As wholesale panic grips the world at the knowledge that the bloodsucking\nmonsters of ancient myth are not symbols of man’s monstrosity and parasitic nature\nbut concrete entities, members of the Society of Leopold suddenly find themselves\nbeset from all sides.\nPressure mounts for them to “do something” and protect humanity (as if they\nhadn’t been the self-appointed protectors all along). Meanwhile, internal pressures\nthreaten to divide the Society into those who want to wage an all-out war against\nthe vampires and a determined minority (the Sanbenito) who hope to find the latent\nhumanity within the undead and bring them to God and to a life of good works. And\nthen there’s the question of whether the Inquisition can truly defeat such awesome\ncreatures without help from their enemies once the true power of the Antediluvians\nbecomes known…\n• Crucible of God: Even more so than “Nightshade,” this scenario unveils the\nall-out war the Inquisition has been alternately fearing and preparing for since its\ncreation. The predictions of the end of the world come to pass, Gehenna takes on\napocalyptic dimensions, and the Ancients rise to claim entire continents as their\nown. These beings rend reality with their very existence, and their battles lay waste\nto miles in the blink of an eye. Quite simply, the Jyhad threatens not only all life on\nEarth but possibly the existence of the planet itself.\nHow does the Inquisition react to the most direct and literal manifestation of\nthe end of the world? After all, those with religious convictions have probably\nbelieved in the finite nature of God’s universe and its inevitable end. What happens\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Even secularly oriented members of\nthe Society of Leopold might realize that ancient vampires have the same potential\nto destroy the world as nuclear bombs or asteroid strikes.\nThe Society of Leopold could disintegrate altogether in the face of certain\ndestruction of everything in existence (or at least of “civilization as we know it”).\nSome run for cover as the world falls to pieces around them. Others simply commit\ntheir souls to God and go about their business or killing (or saving) vampires as usual.\nStill others strive desperately to prevent God’s wrath from raining down on the\nworld. Mass autos-da-fé and acts of religious fervor could become the order of the day.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E A A A A ARCANUM\nRCANUM\nRCANUM\nRCANUM\nRCANUM\nThe Arcanum has existed as an organization since the 1800s, but individuals\nwho possess a compelling interest in accumulating “secret” or occult knowledge have\nexisted throughout history. Many members of the Arcanum have made a study of\nvarious types of supernaturals, but no group intrigues them as much as those people\nwho call themselves mages and who focus their will through various symbols and\nrituals to alter the fabric of reality.\nThe Arcanum’s interest in all things occult has provided a wealth of information,\nall documented, some pieces contradictory to other pieces. What the Arcanum’s\nmembers do not possess is a strong urge to do something with what they know. In most\ncases, the end of the world takes the Arcanum by surprise, not because these scholars\ndon’t see it coming, but because they don’t know what to do about it when it gets there.\nArcanum members are more suited for live-action games using Laws of\nAscension. The following scenarios consider the role of Arcanum characters in end-\nof-the-world chronicles featuring the Traditions and the Technocracy.\n• Judgment: The Day of Judgment arises for mages, in which those who have followed\nthe call of their Avatars and worked toward Ascension receive their reward, while those\nwho have not done so suffer the penalties for failure. Spontaneous Awakenings of Sleepers\ncrowd the world with magic. A plague of insanity washes over the world.\nThe Arcanum itself might be rocked by the sudden Awakening of many of its\nmembers. After all, the predisposition of many Arcanum members toward all things\noccult makes them potential candidates for Awakening. Those who do Awaken\nmight also go mad as they suddenly become the things they have studied for so long.\nArcanum members have some idea of what constitutes an “Awakened” being\nsuch as a mage. Certainly they realize that the powers wielded by those who call\nthemselves mages have the ability to redefine reality to some extent. But knowing\nand doing are two different things.\nThose who don’t Awaken face the problem of how to deal with the strange events\noccurring in the world around them. The walls of reality break down as the world\napproaches the end point. While mages eventually realize what is going on, the\nArcanum might be slow in picking up the clues. If the scholars do realize what is in store\nfor the world, they realize their own tragic part in events — that of the onlooker.\nThe frustration suffered by most members of the Arcanum is that as they learn\nmore about the imminent apotheosis of mages, they also learn more about how little\nthey can do to affect it. The plight of the helpless is the bane of the Arcanum.\n• A Whimper, Not a Bang: In this scenario, only the mages participate in\nAscension. The world itself and the people without magical potential remain\nblissfully ignorant of the transcendence going on around them.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Arcanum members who are astute enough to discover what is going on\nwill also realize that they have no part in the mages’ Ascension. They can only stand\nby as mages and magic leave the world, feeling within them the chill of the\nknowledge that from here on in, only the inflexible laws of Nature remain.\nFor the Arcanum, all that is left is history.\n• The Revolution Will Be Televised: The Ascension War has historically\nconsisted of a series of battles between the Traditions and the Technocracy (and\nwithin each group) for control of reality and to determine the form that Ascension\nwill take. In a scenario in which the Technocracy wins the ultimate victory and\ncontrols Ascension, magic not only disappears, but science seizes the world in a\ndeath grip of technology that steadily recedes from anything remotely human.\nIn a scenario such as this, the Arcanum could, in fact, play a pivotal role, should\nit manage not to fall afoul of the Technocracy itself. In a world without magic, or one\nin which the Technocracy controls or exterminates all mages, the Arcanum could\nbe the only group left that remembers what magic was. These scholars — like the\nliving books encountered by the hero in Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 — might become\nrepositories of the history of magic. Whether they can do anything with the\nknowledge that they alone hold remains to be seen.\nThe Technocracy, if it knows of the Arcanum’s existence and purpose, might\ncome hunting the scholars after the mages have been neutralized, which could place\nthe Arcanum members in a situation unlike any they have ever encountered. All of\na sudden, they are the observed rather than the observer, and those who observe\nthem don’t just want to take notes.\n• The Earth Will Shake: In this most physical scenario, the emphasis is on\naction and finding solutions to a situation that might not be solvable. While the\nemphasis in a Laws of Ascension game falls naturally on the mage characters,\nArcanum characters could serve as resource persons, particularly if they have access\nto information kept secret from the public in order to avoid wholesale panic.\nArcanum members also possess all sorts of odd pockets of knowledge that might\nbe relevant to any solutions proposed by mages, should any of them think to consult\nsources within Sleeper society. Should averting disaster be impossible, then the\nArcanum might play a role in helping salvage as much of Earth’s population as possible.\nCharacters who belong to the Arcanum might take a more active role in events,\nnot only lending their expertise to mages who seek them out, but also acting as\nliaisons between the Sleeping masses and the magic-wielders who don’t want to “go\npublic” even at the end of the world.\nIn the end, however, the Arcanum might again realize that knowing everything\nis useless without the capacity or will to use the knowledge.\n• Hell on Earth: In a scenario in which neither the Technocracy nor the\nTraditions win but the infernalists steal the victory and define Ascension, the\nArcanum might, in fact, reach its highest potential. For as long as these scholars have\nexisted, they have remained in the background, quietly collecting information,\nsynthesizing it and acting as observers in the World of Darkness. Chances are, the\nNephandi know as little about them as other mages do.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

This\nknowledge can stand Arcanum scholars in good stead in learning how to avoid the\nEarth’s new masters or else provide information for pockets of rebellion (if any are\nleft). Whether the Arcanum steps in to fill a void in the absence of any other group\nof resisters depends largely on whether Arcanum characters elect to take action\nagainst the generally passive nature of the group as a whole.\nTWILIGHT\nWILIGHT\nWILIGHT\nWILIGHT\nWILIGHT A A A A AGENCIES\nGENCIES\nGENCIES\nGENCIES\nGENCIES\nA few special government agencies around the world are aware of the existence\nof the supernatural.  Known informally as “twilight agencies,” their job is to monitor\nsupernatural groups and crack down on any who break the law. For some of them, the\nfact that a werewolf or vampire exists is an illegal act. These groups, which include the\nSpecial Affairs Department (SAD) in the United States, Division Six in Great Britain\nand similar agencies all over the globe, usually figure most prominently as antagonists\nin chronicles using Laws of the Wild.  Because of their primary association with\nWerewolf: The Apocalypse, they come up in this section. Like any of the other mortal\nsecret societies, though, they can figure in any chronicle set in the World of Darkness.\nTwilight agencies have all the resources of their respective governments as well\nas the force of law behind them, but if things go wrong, most governments leave\ntwilight agents to fend for themselves. What they lack most often is true knowledge\nabout the creatures that they hunt. The End-Time scenarios could not provide them\nwith the enlightenment they so avidly desire. Should they discover all they need to\nknow, will their knowledge serve them when they must respond to the end of the\nworld? The following scenarios examine these clandestine agencies’ possible reac-\ntions to various endgames.\n• A Tribe Falls: When events launch a battle between the Garou Nation and\none of its own, the mortal world might experience this event as an increase in riots\nin rural areas — some of which spread into the cities. Savaged bodies turn up in the\ncountryside, farm communities lock their doors in fear, and a few call in the “feds”\nor whatever government group is most appropriate. While SAD might not become\ninvolved in this scenario unless the signs point to bizarre or occult-style crimes, the\nNSA will certainly intervene, trying to put two and two together and figure out\nwhat’s going on. If it does, it might not believe it.\nGroups that have had experience with werewolves will recognize certain\ntelltale signs, but most have never dealt with large-scale incidents. Response might\ninvolve tracking down the supernaturals and bringing massive weaponry against\nthem. As the battle escalates, so does the terror, and these twilight agencies will most\nlikely find themselves sorely outmatched.\n• The Last Battleground: For human governments and their twilight agents, this\nscenario offers the greatest frustration. Most of the action goes on in the spirit world,\nso mortals never see the actual “battles” or their aftermath in casualties. What does\ncome through, however, is an echo of the Umbral events in the real world. Odd events,\ninexplicable manifestations of Umbral beings (possibly mistaken for ghosts or demons)\nand a general sense of malaise and madness piques the interest of pattern-seekers in the\nNSA or conspiracy theorists in the CIA. Some conclude that some dreadful Armaged-\ndon scenario is about to take place, unaware that it is already going on.\nAs the world begin to fall apart around them due to the Final Battle, the physical\nworld takes on the appearance of the now-ravaged Umbra.

Therefore, in a scenario where the Weaver takes\nadvantage of the war between the Garou and the Wyrm, the NSA, SAD and most other\nspecial agencies over the globe will only notice the increasing unrest and the escalation of\nviolence. They might also notice certain forces attempting to stabilize the situation and\nprovide assistance to those groups in restoring order, thus aiding the Weaver unknowingly.\nUnfortunately, twilight agencies have much in common with the Weaver’s\nfollowers. They both stand for order and stability, shy away from change and tend\nto frown upon spontaneity. So even if an agent has a sudden inspiration as to what\nis really going on, she might run into so much red tape trying to get results that any\nactions she takes will most likely come too late.\nThose who play by the rules find themselves unable to break the rules, even\nwhen the fate of the world depends on it. Twilight agents could discover that their\nhands are tied if they attempt any unorthodox maneuvers, such as aiding the Garou\nin their battles. After all, who doesn’t want a safe, stable world where nothing out\nof the ordinary happens — ever?\n• Ragnarok: The most extreme scenario twilight agencies might face is one in\nwhich all the dire prophecies of the Apocalypse come true — literally. The mortal\nworld, including members of twilight agencies, will be too occupied in merely\nkeeping order and handling damage control as things fall apart around them.\nNatural disasters, outbreaks of wars, the breakdown of civilization, an invasion\nfrom “beyond” all seem to happen at once, throwing armies and civilian peacekeep-\ning forces headlong into the battle to hold a line that keeps disappearing out from\nunder their feet — even as the earth itself crumbles away. Nothing is hidden in this\nscenario, and the worst theories of the twilight agencies’ top conspiracy theorists\ncome to pass. Unfortunately, the sight of creatures that can only be called “monsters”\nbattling each other too much for the all-too-human minds of even the best-trained\nagents. Madness strikes down most mortals before the world comes to an end.\nEven the best of the twilight agencies descends into the final darkness, with\nthose they have pursued for so long.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E D\n D\n D\n D\n DAUNTAIN\nAUNTAIN\nAUNTAIN\nAUNTAIN\nAUNTAIN\nDauntain make interesting additions to a live-action End-Times chronicle based on\nThe Shining Host, if for no other reason than their unpredictability.

The end of the world puts\na stop to all that nonsense. The following possible scenarios can have drastic effects on any\nDauntain characters and can make for an intriguing sub-plot within the main chronicle.\n• A Crown of Shadows: A fae chronicle depicting victory for the Unseelie fae and\nthe Shadow Court likewise rouses the opposition of the Dauntain. Even though they\nespouse different techniques of gathering Glamour and do not fear Banality as much as\nSeelie changelings do, the Winter-aspected fae retain the ties to the Dreaming that elicit\nsuch opposition by the Dauntain.

In some instances, the Winter Court might realize that\nthe Dauntain pose a danger and hunt them down remorselessly.\n• Gods and Monsters: Instead of occurring in the background, the battles\nbetween the Summer and Winter fae takes center stage as god-like creatures emerge\nfrom the Dreaming to oppose each other in full view of the mortal world. This sudden\nemergence of so many fae, perhaps including the legendary Tuatha de Danaan and\ntheir Fomorian enemies — as well as mythical creatures such as dragons and unicorns\n— causes a wash of Glamour to sweep over the world, bursting the barriers between\nthe Dreaming and the physical plane.\nImmune to the sleep effects of the Transformation, as are any people with fae\nblood, the Dauntain face what easily seems like their worst nightmares made real.\nThe shock of this awareness might drive some Dauntain insane, or the infusion of\nGlamour might spark a re-awakening of their true faerie selves.

They might have to fight off fae “rescuers” who are determined to save them from\ndestruction.

Faced with the reality of their natures, these individuals try to\nreturn to Arcadia. Their excessive Banality, however, might either prevent them\nfrom doing so, thus condemning them to a life of regret and despair, or they might\nhave to undergo a rigorous purging of Banality from their bodies and spirits before\nthey can safely enter the heart of the Dreaming.\n• Pick Your Poison: A scenario that ends up giving the Dauntain what they\nmost desire — freedom from the burden of their faerie natures — involves the final\nseparation between the Dreaming and the physical world in the wake of some\nterrible announcement. As human creativity, which draws its sustenance from the\nability to touch the world of dreams, fades away, the world stagnates and becomes\nutterly mundane. The Dauntain can at last rejoice in their liberation from the faerie\ncurse… if they even remember that they were once cursed.\nIn the brave, gray post-Dreaming world, the Dauntain can sink into the morass\nof dull sameness that they have apparently desired all along.

Every vampire has heard rumors and legends about this time of\nreckoning, when the Antediluvians will rise and Caine will return to pass judgment\nupon them all.\nThe long darkness of the vampire is finally ending. The Final Nights draw to a\nclose, and the prophesized end in The Book of Nod has begun scourging the world.\nThe countries of the world will be rendered broken and helpless, as the Jyhad spills\nover from the land of night into the world of mortals.\nThis chapter details how to bring the Final Nights to a fitting conclusion in your\ngame, first by introducing some new story elements and game mechanics that you\ncan apply to help simulate the desperate nature of the Kindred at Gehenna’s\napproach, then by addressing some common vampiric concerns a Storyteller might\nhave when preparing her players for the End Times.\nThis chapter concludes with four different End-Time scenarios you may choose to\nimplement for your troupe, ranging from highly personalized stories of redemption to\ntales of great battles and terrible disasters. As always, you may choose to modify them.\nNEW MECHANICS\nThis section details some of the game mechanics that might prove helpful in\ncreating a properly desperate and intriguing atmosphere for Gehenna.

      "text": "LAWS OF JUDGMENT\n18\nThe Withering begins so subtly at first that no one notices. It starts with the\nlowest-generation Cainites and works its way down. The first month of the Withering\naffects only the Third Generation. The second month, the Curse’s decline affects the\nFourth Generation. The third month, the Fifth Generation feels its effects, and so on.\nBy the time this effect reaches many of the characters in your story, they might already\nhave some horrible clue as to what is in store for them. These are mostly suggestions,\nfeel free to modify them as you see fit. This Withering has these effects:\n• Each month that a Cainite suffers the Withering, she loses access to her most\nadvanced Discipline powers. In case of a tie between Discipline levels, the Story-\nteller picks one at random.\n• All vampires affected by the Withering suffer the Thin Blood Flaw (see Laws\nof the Night, p. 115).\n• Blood bonds and Vinculi have a 50% chance each month of breaking, no\nmatter how strongly they are reinforced. Once broken, a bond cannot be reestab-\nlished despite any subsequent attempts to do so.\n• Each time the character deliberately calls on her Blood or activates a\nDiscipline, the player immediately must engage in a pair of Simple Tests. If the player\nfails both tests, the desired result does not take place and the Blood Trait is wasted.\nWhat’s more, the character loses another of her highest-ranked Discipline powers\nand any further attempt that night to expend vitae also requires spending a\nWillpower Trait. If the character fails a second time to activate a Discipline or\nexpend vitae effectively, she cannot use Disciplines or expend vitae at all for the rest\nof the night. This bout of weakness, which Kindred feel as a physical ache, does not\naffect the vitae expended to wake up each night.\n• Torpor does not slow the Withering at all.\nDiablerie\nIn these frantic final hours, many will make up for their lost power by attempting\nto take it from others. Like sharks tasting blood in the water, the feeding frenzy is\nabout to begin in full. In the event that the Withering has begun, diablerizing\nanother Cainite temporarily counters the Withering in the following manner.\n• The Kindred loses the Thin Blood Flaw.\n• The character regains his lost Disciplines, to the limit set by the victim’s\ngeneration. Therefore, an elder who wants to regain high-level Discipline powers\nmust devour another Cainite of suitably low generation.\n• Discipline activation and blood expenditure no longer spontaneously fails.\n• The length of the palliation depends on the victim’s age. It is recommended\nthat the shorter length of time on the following table be assigned. A game with\nmultiple sessions in a month should use the session figure, for instance, while one\nwith sessions spaced farther apart can use the real-time measurement:\nNew Childe*\n1 session/3 nights\nNeonate\n1 session/1 week\nAncilla\n2 sessions/2 weeks\nElder\n2 sessions/3 weeks\nMethuselah or Antediluvian\n4 sessions/1 month\n* Less than five years a Cainite.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The\nchances for any Discipline or vitae use to fail increases to just one failure on the\nSimple Tests. (Willpower Traits may be spent for a retest, at the Storyteller’s\ndiscretion.) By the climax of Gehenna — assuming that any characters survive\nthat long — any use of Cainite powers is chancy at best, thus supplying a great\ntemptation to commit diablerie.\nTHE BLOOD THINS\nAs the Blood weakens, its preservative properties do as well, and the lines\nbetween modern and ancient clans blur. Clan disadvantages magnify as the curses\nupon the clan founders are no longer held at bay by the greater Curse of Caine. These\nconsequences are recommended for the major clans. (The bloodlines and other clans\ncan be slightly less or more severe as their parent clan, depending on your story.) It\nis important to take the time to impress these weaknesses upon each of the\ncharacters, it will be their first clue that the end has come.\n• Assamites — Slowly, Assamites find themselves unable to feed on anything\nbut vampire blood. As Gehenna progresses, they soon find that they can gain\nsustenance from blood only if they commit diablerie after feeding.\n• Brujah — Strange reports of clan members disappearing without a trace\ncirculate throughout the clan with increasing frequency. As Gehenna progresses, all\nclan members gain the Flaw: Lunacy.\n• Gangrel — The Clan of Beasts finds itself becoming more and more\nanimalistic with the passage of time, sometimes even shifting into animal form\nwithout consciously choosing to do so.\n• Giovanni — The Necromancers grow more pale and corpselike than even\nother vampires, coming to resemble the very clan they usurped. (Incidentally, the\nHarbingers of Skulls start to look and smell like the Samedi, and the Samedi are all\nbut falling apart.) The Restless Dead attack them at every turn. Necromancy —\nthough it still works — becomes perilous to use at best.\n• Lasombra — All Lasombra face difficulties in controlling their Obtenebration.\nShadows rage out of control, attacking their creators or — in extreme cases —\nripping holes in the fabric of reality, directly into the Abyss itself.\n• Malkavians — No longer able to contain the madness within them,\nMalkavians find themselves unleashing it upon the world. Bouts of prophesy become\nincreasingly frequent, and Dementation might activate without conscious desire. As\nthe end approaches, the physical world itself might even be warped by the Discipline\nin minor but telling ways.\n• Nosferatu — The Discipline of Obfuscate begins to fail the Nosferatu at the\nmost inopportune times. As Gehenna progresses, Mask of a Thousand Faces fails\nautomatically, and Nosferatu slowly grow even more repulsive than normal.\n• Ravnos — The Beast intensifies, becoming a literal voice in the character’s\near impelling him to evil acts. The voice grows louder throughout Gehenna, until\nby the end, each Ravnos has a wicked nature that takes on a whispering life of its own.\nNear the end, a Chimerstry duplicate might even appear.\n• Setites — The Snakes come to resemble their clan’s epithet. Any time one\nuses Serpentis, the change brought on by it could become permanent. As Set fails to\nrise, faith in him dwindles among the clan.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The difficulty of resisting the descent into debauchery increases as\nGehenna progresses.\n• Tremere — In a true display of irony, each Tremere develops a third eye. The\neye first opens at a time of trauma or stress and allows its bearer to see things even\nAuspex does not normally reveal. As Gehenna progresses, some Tremere develop the\nnew Tzimisce clan disadvantage as well.\n• Tzimisce — The Fiends can no longer reliably control their Vicissitude,\ncausing wild aberrations in both themselves and others. Some demonstrate the\nability to use the Discipline without touch, but even they have reduced control of\nthe fine points of it. As the end comes, many Tzimisce lose the ability to hold the\nsame shape for even a short period of time.\n• Ventrue — In a final ironic twist, the Clan of Kings’ notorious fondness for blood\nof a certain caliber degenerates into a preference for each other’s blood — exclusively.\nVentrue become unable to gain sustenance on anything but the blood of other Ventrue.\nSEVERED BLOODLINES\nWhen a clan’s Antediluvian founder meets Final Death, a terrible shock wave\nresonates through the surviving descendants, causing them to erupt in fits of terrible\nfratricidal madness and diablerie. The events surrounding the death of the Ravnos\nAntediluvian during the Week of Nightmares in 1999 — detailed for tabletop in\nTime of Thin Blood and live-action in the Laws of the Night Storytellers Guide,\np. 77-97 — were an early warning of what the Kindred can expect. As more Ancients\nare destroyed during the great battles of Gehenna, this violence will only become\nmore frequent.\nHere are some guidelines for what happens to members of a clan after their\nfounder meets Final Death. Storytellers should feel free to adjust these guidelines as\nthey see fit for their scenario, but in no event should the death of an Antediluvian\npass by without great repercussions for the clan.\n• In the nights surrounding death of the Antediluvian, all members of the clan\nreceive the Flaw: Nightmares, and are one Trait down on all Mental and Social\nChallenges due to the constant distraction of the images from their dreams. This\neffect increases to a one-Trait penalty as circumstances become truly severe.\n• Clan members might spontaneously exhibit erratic surges of up to three additional\nlevels of one clan Discipline — generally the clan’s proprietary Discipline such as Vicissitude\nor Protean, or the most relevant Discipline to the founder’s demise if no unique Discipline\nexists.

This\nfrenzy test must be made each night upon awakening, or any time another clan member\nis encountered. No form of magical or mundane disguise can block this thirst, as Blood\ncalls to Blood automatically. Failure means that a victim is compelled to seek out the\nnearest clan member and attempt to diablerize him, regardless of his current Path, past\nfriendship with the target or any other personal desires.\n• At the Storyteller’s discretion, Willpower Traits may be spent to stave off\nfratricidal frenzy for a scene, but a number of Traits equal to the difficulty of the Self-\nControl/Instinct Challenge is required, making it extremely costly indeed.\n• Clan members also display unusual behaviors and memories in keeping with\nthe nature of their founder — including abrupt Nature shifts, sudden outbursts in\nancient languages and suddenly recalling places or people never seen before. These\noddities are mostly roleplaying concerns that do not permanently alter a character’s\nTraits, but Storytellers are encouraged to give characters a number of such changes\nto convey the impact of what has occurred.\nSTORYTELLING\nThis section covers a number of topics and ideas that Storytellers might find\ninstructive to address as they prepare to unleash Gehenna.\nTELLTALE SIGNS\nThe very nature of its origin story — God cursing Caine for committing the first\nmurder — gives Masquerade a rather Biblical frame of reference, especially when it\ncomes to something like the End Times. Even if the chronicle has moved away from\nthe Caine story as literal truth, Storytellers are encouraged to look through the Book\nof Revelation or other apocalyptic religious texts for inspiration for events during\ntheir Gehenna scenarios. What follows is a brief listing of some options suitable for\nany scenario that Storytellers can employ for additional dramatic impact.\nThe Ground Shakes\nMany countries around the world experience a surge of minor earthquakes. This\nactivity can be due to something as direct as an Antediluvian rising in the vicinity, or\nsimply something indicative of the uneasy state of the world in general. From a thematic\npoint of view, earthquakes remind people that they are ever at the mercy of larger forces,\nso they are excellent tools for underscoring scenarios involving direct confrontation with\nthe Ancients. Alternatively, minor quakes can be an omen of unrest, an indication that\nsomething is not quite right even if the players can’t see it yet.\nBlood of the Earth\nAcross the globe, active volcanoes erupt with startlingly frequency and even inactive\nvolcanoes begin to stir. Scientists at first say it is probably due to the unprecedented shifting\nof tectonic forces below the earth’s crust, but the players’ characters will quickly come to\nrealize the truth. Some smaller volcanoes actually erupt in urban areas, and geysers of\nscalding steam spring up all over. Like earthquakes, volcanoes illustrate that something\nwithin the earth isn’t right — but it’s something ready to explode in fury and destruction\nas opposed to remaining an anonymous and invisible force in the background.\nA Pestilence upon the Land\nDisease, the expression of an unclean species made manifest on its physical form,\nis another excellent way of highlighting the corruption that has overtaken the world.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "LAWS OF JUDGMENT\n22\nSpringing up in the wake of certain Ancients awakening, a strange epidemic spreads\naround rest of the world. The symptoms are diluted blood and the effects that it brings\nwith it: nausea, mild hallucinations, discolored skin and the occasional outbreak of\nbleeding lesions. No one has seen anything like this, and though it doesn’t seem to be\nlethal (at least for now), it’s highly contagious, spreading through blood and other\nsecretions. In truly extreme scenarios, it might even come to affect the Kindred.\nBrother Against Brother\nWith Gehenna being heralded by nightmares and earthquakes, it doesn’t take\nmuch more for the kine to finally lash out in fear. This hometown threat is something\nthat the players’ characters could have to deal with directly. Their havens might come\nunder fire, their herd might be attacked, or their contacts and allies might be hurt or killed\noutright in the chaos. With the characters resources and influence already stretched thin,\nwhat happens when riots start breaking out in the setting where your game takes place?\nDo the characters take advantage of the carnage to settle scores, or do they pull together\nin mutual defense until the threat passes? Do the other sects and rival clans seek to take\nadvantage of the distress to carve a piece of your characters’ territories?\nMadness, Madness Everywhere\nEven more than damage to the body, many people fear damage to the mind. A\nwound can be treated, a lost limb replaced, but madness? Fear of losing oneself and\nbecoming a stranger both within and without strikes something deep in everyone. As\nGehenna approaches, this threat becomes more urgent than ever. The mortal population\nTHE FACES OF THE ANCIENTS\nMany scenarios call for the Antediluvians or similarly powerful entities\nlike Caine and Lilith to appear at one point or another. It’s a rather formidable\ntask to attempt to accurately portray creatures that lived and breathed in a\ntime before mankind recorded its own history. So how do you and your staff\nof Narrators create the feeling that these characters are in fact the Ancients\nraised from their slumber?\nOne good piece of advice is to avoid direct in-character exchanges between\nthe players’ characters and the Ancients altogether. No matter how well you\nwork to display this level of raw ancient power wrapped into a human-shaped\nform, it’s very possible that you might just accidentally end up sounding more\nlike a bad, overblown imitation of an action movie villain. This isn’t meant as\nan underestimation of your ability as a Storyteller or as a roleplayer; rather, it’s\na suggestion that it might be best to keep the “camera” off the Ancients.\nConsider this: Confronting such powerful entities directly could shatter the\nmind of a lesser creature, so don’t “show” them as much as you intimate their\nhideous (or nigh-divine) presences. The character might witness only the\naftermath of their terrible wake, or simply arrive after the Ancient has already\ndeparted. Characters may even experience “lost time,” wherein they find them-\nselves far from where they remember being a moment before the Ancient passed\nby, with terrible images floating in their heads like memories of a bad dream. Their\nminds, being attached to a rational existence, just couldn’t comprehend the\npresence of these creatures, so they deleted the horrible experience completely.\n(Yet some part in the dark recesses of their minds will always remember the terrible\nbeauty and indescribable horror of what they laid eyes upon.)\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

People begin\ngibbering in tongues, committing horrible acts of violence with no reason, and devolving\ninto mindless savagery. Some suspect it’s just a result of the stress of the times, while the\nKindred whisper that perhaps this is the mad god Malkav manifesting at last. His progeny\nare silent on the subject, but some take this as the silence before the storm.\nCHARACTER ELEMENTS\nDon’t lose sight of the fact that between disasters and catastrophic events, the\ncharacters are still the main focus of your story. The following sections offer some\nadvice on areas Storytellers might wish to cover with the characters in order to coax\nthe maximum dramatic impact out of Gehenna.\nDIGGING IN THE DIRT\nEvery vampire was once a mortal. A likely theme to explore is a matter of taking\ncharacters back to their roots. In the face of Gehenna, perhaps one of the best ways to voice\nits impact is to show the characters, for all their powers and abilities, exactly what it is they\nhave lost in becoming vampires. The best way to point something out is to show it in\ncontrast to its opposite. If you want to focus on the drama of the end of vampire society,\ntouch upon the lost humanity of the characters. Without being too heavy-handed in your\napproach, involve them in the human aspect of the world around them. Remind them of\nthe good things that they might have lost in their transition into Kindred.\nReview each player’s history and see what avenues can be taken. If the typically\ngruff Brujah began his life in the humble part of town, maybe something comes along\nto remind him of his meager beginnings, such as a chance meeting with an old family\nfriend (to remind him of his humanity), or running into the one friendly girl from\nelementary school who is now all grown up (showing the character the path not\ntaken). These encounters don’t have to be obvious digs to elicit emotion from the\ncharacter. Rather they should be unexpected views from broken reflections. By\npointing out how far a character has developed during the course of a story, you let\nthe player see the contrast to what they have ultimately become. This introspection\nmight bring about a depth of roleplaying never before seen in your game, and this is\njust right for a story that is about to come to its potentially dramatic conclusion.\nANGELS AND DEMONS\nWhile the topic of vampire redemption is often talked about in the dark corners of\nElysium, it is rarely sought. Too often the easy path of power that comes with nurturing\ninhuman behavior wins out. During the trials of surviving from night to night in vampire\nsociety, possessing a human heart might seem like a liability. This story you are conducting,\nhowever, doesn’t take place on just another night on the Endless Road — this is a story\nabout the end. In the face of that, perhaps some of the most monstrous vampires attempt\nto rouse some chance of redemption in the eyes of higher powers. A character may finally\nbe forced to ask that burning question, am I truly going to be damned?\nAs Gehenna unfolds, the characters may very well be faced with a no-win situation\n(or at least one they perceive as such). Faced with such terminal knowledge, they might seek\nto make amends and reach for that vain hope that perhaps there is something worth saving\nwithin them. This is a difficult theme to explore given its potentially morbid sensibility. It\ncould be the most rewarding high road to take in the chaos of the end, however.\nUltimately salvation is yours as the Storyteller to define.

Other Storytellers might prefer\nto judge it for themselves based on the reactions of the characters, or perhaps polling\ntheir Narrators, as opposed to relying on Traits to make the decision for them.\nWhatever it is, however, it should not come easily. Some of the noblest figures only\nearned redemption posthumously, after all.\nLAWYERS, GUNS AND MONEY\nChances are good that more than a few of your characters have devoted a lot of time\nand energy to becoming true lords of the night, with amassed networks of Influences,\nAllies, Resources, Contacts and other Traits that would make Washington power brokers\nblush. Therefore, it can be tempting as Gehenna’s chaos unfolds to throw these\ncharacters for a loop by destroying all the temporal power they have carefully amassed,\nforcing them to rely on only their own powers and aptitudes. Be careful with such\nimpulses, however. Your players have likely spent a long time accumulating their various\nInfluences and other Backgrounds. While it’s only natural that they should expect some\nproblems as the world slides into disorder, making them feel as though all their time and\nplanning has been spent for nothing is never a good idea. Especially in such a political,\nintrigue-oriented game as Masquerade, these expenditures are just as valid as spending\nExperience on Disciplines, Attributes or Abilities. As a Storyteller, you should honor\nthat fact with equal consideration during your climactic scenario.\nRather than simply destroying the city’s networks of power and Influence outright,\nthen, present those characters who are invested in them with crises that threaten to take\naway what they’ve fought so hard to obtain. Give them a chance to maintain at least some\nof their grip with some quick thinking and slick manipulation. Heck, they might even\nbe able to expand their powers if they’re really clever. (In the chaos surrounding\nGehenna, who’s going to worry about someone expanding territory behind the scenes?)\nLikewise, as the inevitable threats brought on by Gehenna come their way, give them\nchallenges they can help meet with their mortal connections and resources. Even if their\nvast power is slipping from their grip, they should feel as though they have some chance\nto fight what’s coming, or at least salvage what they can before it’s all over.\nIndeed, it’s a good idea in general to take a good look at your players’ character\nsheets, especially if you haven’t done so in a while. While Traits alone rarely tell the\nwhole story, they might offer a good insight into where to put the focus of upcoming\nevents. Take careful note of the Natures of the characters, as well as their most potent\nDisciplines and Abilities and “plot-oriented” Flaws such as Enemy, Hunted or Dark\nSecret. Conversely, learning which Traits are commonly lacking in your group can\nbe just as helpful. If none of the characters in your setting have any interest in the\noccult, a plot involving gaining a wealth of information on the secrets of the Inconnu\nmight not interest them. Doing so allows you not only to determine what your\nplayers will be interested in, but also where their weak points are — two elements\nthat should never be underestimated as you plan for the Gehenna they deserve.\nBRACING FOR IMPACT\nLast but not least, it’s always been a staple of Kindred society that the end was\ncoming. Camarilla Kindred chose to deny its very existence, while the Sabbat and\nothers have based their entire belief system behind it. Some vampires have been\nwaiting patiently for this time to make their final bid for power amidst the chaos to\ncome. At one time or another, most vampires have posed their own thoughts on\nwhat the shape of Gehenna would be.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Will the\nSabbat actually find themselves a match for the Ancients, or will they be proven\ndeluded fools who never really understood the enemy they faced? Will the Camarilla\nhold together once it can no longer deny the facts? Who thought ahead, and who\ngets caught with their guard down? Why?\nOnce you decide the larger ramifications of these questions, you can scale down\nhow they will impact your setting and your characters directly.\nFAIR IS FOUL\nShe has faced nothing but betrayal from those who claimed only to love her,\ncurses from those who once blessed her and obstacles at every turn. Those who\nbetrayed her, took it upon themselves time and again to destroy what she had\ncreated. Her greatest adversary is beyond reach, but his works are not. She has the\nintellect of a goddess, the power of the most potent supernatural creatures you can\ndream of and several millennia to develop the perfect plan of revenge. This is the\nsituation in which Lilith finds herself when Gehenna finally begins.\nThis is the story of the Jyhad as told from the sympathies of one of its oldest and\nmost passionate players, the Dark Mother herself.\nLilith is well aware of the coming of Gehenna. She’s had eons to refine her\nprophetic powers, and she has had time to gather her allies and implement her plan\nfor drawing Caine into the open in order to destroy him. If you so chose, Lilith’s plan\ncan begin in the same city your characters dwell in. You can do so for any number\nof reasons — location, useful industries, particularly important vampires in the area\nor whatever else. Whatever the reason, don’t short change your game or players by\n“just deciding” the end takes place in the characters’ hometown. Make sure it’s the\nreason that makes the most sense for your chronicle. It will help to personalize this\nfinal story for your players and draw them farther into it.\nSUPPORTING CAST\nAlthough Lilith is the driving force behind this story, her allies and enemies\nform the basis for a rich and multifaceted plot. You might wish to employ a larger\nNarrator staff if you wish to have all of these characters take center stage in your story.\nThe alternative is to simply never have all of the side-characters portrayed at once\nTHE DARK MOTHER\nIt is suggested that Storytellers avoid precisely defining Lilith, not to mention\nher powers and capabilities. She is a far more powerful and engaging character if\nshe remains mysterious. Consider this: Lilith has had longer than nearly anyone\nelse, even Caine, to develop personalized approaches to and applications of her\nabilities. Even if she is recognizably one type of supernatural creature or another,\nthe way her powers manifest should always be unique, personal and memorable.\nUltimately, Lilith can be whatever you want her to be, but don’t feel that\nyou need to pin her down to a single archetype.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

You might want to work out a simple system for\nidentifying each character to your players, such as a certain piece of distinct\ncostuming or jewelry to represent who you are at a given time.\nLUCIFER, THE MORNINGSTAR\nIn this story, Lucifer fell because he allowed Lilith back into the Garden of\nEden. Don’t feel a need to remold your chronicle to conform to the established canon\nof what Lucifer has been up. Simply rework Lucifer so that he fits with the story you\nwant to tell, if you choose to use him at all. As a result, their relationship now has\nmany possibilities. They might have returned to their former roles as lovers,\nremained indifferent to each other or become bitter enemies.\nLYLA, THE DAUGHTER\nLilith’s most important ally, at least as far as the characters’ relationship to her is\nconcerned, will most likely be Lyla, her adopted daughter. Since meeting her “mother” the\nfirst time, Lyla has experienced frequent visions of disturbing clarity, some of which she has\nseen come true. She sometimes also suffers lapses during which she speaks in tongues and\nutters words of prophecy, but afterward she retains no memory of having done so. What Lyla\ndoes not know is that although the trances and visions are real, Lilith can use the blood\nconnection between herself and Lyla to control them (and in doing so, control Lyla) when\nshe chooses. Lilith is likewise unaware that when she is not watching Lyla, the girl’s visions\nand trances often concern the Dark Mother’s plans and actions.\nAs a frightened young girl with powers she barely understands, Lyla is intended\nmostly as a Storyteller plot device. If the characters show her any form of kindness,\nshe will respond well to them. She is a survivor, however, and she will run if things\nturn against her. If Lyla takes an important role in your game, you might want to\nassign this role to a single trusted Narrator or cast member who is well acquainted\nwith the story, so that her gift of prophesy can be used to move the characters along\neffectively if things go astray.\nTHE APOSTATES\nLyla is left to survive on her own in the desolate city streets, with only seven\n“bums” to watch over her, but naturally, these derelicts are far from what they appear\nto be. They are students of the Dark Mother who are hiding their true nature from\nLyla. The “official” number of Antediluvians is 13, but various sources make\nreference to more. For this story, 20 Antediluvians remain. Thirteen of them created\nthe various known vampire clans, but the other seven are in service to Lilith instead.\nTHE SEVEN\nEickos — The strange being that calls itself Eickos is counted among the\nApostates solely because Lilith has never been able to discern what it wants, who it\nis or how to get rid of it. Eickos is beautiful, known for her powers of song, persuasion\nand insight. In truth, Eickos’ natural form is horribly repulsive, something far older\nand more sinister than any of the Apostates (or Lilith) imagine.\nErinye — Erinye is the inspiration for such creatures as the Furies of Ancient\nGreek mythology. Of all the Apostates, Erinye has the most in common with Lilith,\nin that she possesses both a wicked temper and an indomitable will.\nIkopabe — The most primal of the Apostates, even surpassing Erinye in his\nbestial nature, Ikopabe is a master shapeshifter and seldom takes a face twice, though\nhis eyes always remain yellow and catlike.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Even Lilith holds a place in her unloving heart for Malakai.\nMekhet — Formerly a great court magician in a now-forgotten proto-Egyptian\nculture, Mekhet has used his nearly limitless years of existence to become the\nforemost blood magician on the planet.\nENEMIES\nBy now, it should be apparent that Lilith has the cards stacked in her favor when\nGehenna begins. That being said, Caine does still have a few potential allies who\nmight aid him as the story plays out. For the most part, even these “allies” may still\nwish to see Caine die, just not by the hand of Lilith or one of her minions.\nCaine\nCaine has probably spent a good deal of time in torpor, lamenting what he feels\nis an unjust state of affairs. When active, he likely experiences difficulty adjusting\nto the new climate of the world before sinking into torpor once more. The most\nimportant thing to remember about Caine, whatever he has done for the past several\nmillennia, is that he remains a man consumed by pride.\nWere he simply to feel regret for his actions — to wish he hadn’t killed his brother\nout of jealousy all those years ago — the Curse of Caine would lift, and he might ascend\nto Heaven right then and there. Caine’s tragedy is that after all the long years of\nsuffering, he remains unable to see that he was wrong. His true curse is of a self-inflicted\nvariety. His relationship with Lilith falls under the same purview. Unable to admit his\nmistakes, he would rather destroy her than face up to the possibility that he was wrong.\nSaulot\nIf any Antediluvian still retains even a shred of loyalty to Caine, Saulot is the\none. Saulot still understands the necessity of Caine’s destruction, but he wishes to\nbring it about in a certain way. Since Saulot has always been one of the more\nmystically inclined Antediluvians, chances are good that he has come to believe that\nif Caine dies by the hand of anyone but God or himself, either the world will end or\nsome horrible disaster will ensue. Only by asking forgiveness for his actions — or, at\nthe very least, honestly coming to regret them — can Caine end his existence\nwithout throwing the whole of Creation into upheaval.\nA WOMAN SCORNED\nRather than following a single, linear course, “Fair is Foul” is designed to unfold\nthrough a series of separate but related events culminating in a final confrontation.\nLilith’s objective here is to create enough supernatural disturbances to draw Caine’s\nattention, while simultaneously gaining a great enough measure of influence over the\ncity that his defeat will be inevitable when he arrives. If none of the scenes appeal to\nyour game, use them simply as guidelines for the general types of situations that move\nthis scenario along and then design your own, keeping Lilith’s ultimate goals in mind.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

In fact, the diverse nature of the different\nscenes is quite deliberate, with some designed to appeal to more social characters,\nothers for more intellectual types and a few for those who are used to hitting things\nuntil they stop hitting back. At first these may seem isolated incidents, but once the\ncharacters begin comparing notes…\nFOLLOW THE DAUGHTER\nLyla’s status as one of the city’s many homeless people means that she can\nappear at any time in the story — whenever you need a hook to lead into another\nmini-scenario or simply when things begin to slow down. Probably the best idea is\nto have Lyla appear immediately preceding or following another mini-scenario,\nspeaking cryptic messages about the event even though it has not happened yet —\nor, if it already has, even though she was not present for it.\nIf characters treat Lyla well — like a real person, deserving compassion and\nfriendship — they should be rewarded with her trust and some information. Lyla will lead\nthose she trusts to the alley where her mentors, the seven Apostates, reside in their\ndisguises, as she wants her newfound “friends” to meet the closest thing she has to parents.\nDepending on whether Eickos is present, five or six of them cluster near (but not too\nnear…) a burning oil drum to warm themselves. The last — Malakai — huddles far from\nthe fire, muttering to herself and appearing frightened. This scene should be set up in a\nprivate section of your play area, with as much attention given to the details as possible.\nUse the Apostates as you best can, perhaps assigning a couple to Narrator cast members.\nThe characters’ actions here are more critical than perhaps anywhere else in the\nstory, as Lilith frequently watches both the Apostates and Lyla. For her part, Lyla\nspends most of her time in the alley with Malakai, trying to calm her and ease her\nsuffering. Those who approach the fire are treated to cryptic but still relevant bits of\nwisdom from the seemingly eccentric bums. Most of this advice probably centers\nupon questioning one’s path, particularly if the characters have decided to oppose\nLilith by this point. The bums do not reveal themselves as anything more than\nnormal vagrants unless Lyla is directly threatened or someone mentions Lilith, or\nsomething else of great significance.\nIf someone does bring up one of these things, though, the characters most likely\nreceive a direct invitation from Lucian to join Lilith — which could change the\ncomplexion of the story dramatically.\nCOURTLY INTRIGUE\nThis scenario is probably best run as either the very first, to direct the characters\ntoward other mini-scenarios as you see fit, or after all the players’ characters have\nexperienced one of the other mini-scenarios together. Note: Camarilla terms such\nas “prince” will be used from here onward for ease of reading, but adapt the\nterminology for Sabbat or anarchs as need arises.\nThe prince calls a meeting of all the city’s vampires. The main agenda item of the\nmeeting is an act (or several acts) of diablerie. At least one person in the city — preferably\na member of the prince’s own entourage or a well-known elder — has committed the\nheinous deed and must be punished appropriately. If one of your characters has\ncommitted diablerie as her blood has thinned, now is the ideal time to make her pay for\nit, forcing her coterie to choose to go into hiding with her or to turn against her friend.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The prince might\nalready be aware of the potential disturbances posed by some or all of the other mini-\nscenarios. This would be an ideal time to split the characters into different scenes that\ninvolve only a few players at a time while others fill temporary cast roles as antagonists.\nSAULOT’S GAMBIT\nSaulot approaches one, several or all of the characters and tries to convince\nthem to join him in the fight against Lilith. If they don’t trust him, he offers to help\nthem with something they need in return for helping him. If Lyla is present, Saulot\nreveals the nature of her unknowing link to Lilith.\nSaulot’s main bargaining chip is information. He knows the true identities of\nthe bums — or, rather, he knows they’re Antediluvians, having a sense for that sort\nof thing — but he doesn’t know specifics about them. He’s been tailing Lilith for a\nlong time and watching her and her closest allies through his own contacts in the\nInconnu and among the mystics of Clan Tremere. He also suspects that Lyla is the\nLast Daughter of Eve and that she’s connected to Lilith by some type of sympathetic\nlink, believing (correctly) that Lyla is the key to defeating Lilith.\nSaulot’s other main asset is his vast knowledge of Thaumaturgy. Spending years\nin Tremere’s body, Saulot knows a great deal about blood magic, as well as that which\nhe learned during his time in the East. He can build a ritual for the players’ characters\nto enact whether or not they have Thaumaturgy, based on those principles. Saulot\nhas access to rituals that require no extensive prior knowledge of magic, and he’s able\nto teach them to the characters if they choose to help him.\nIf the characters do attack him for some reason, Saulot will try to escape rather than\nreturning the attack, reappearing later in a different guise to try to gain their support again.\nENDGAME\nSince so many different characters might be involved in the final confrontation\nbetween Lilith and Caine, this scene has been broken down by character, with\nactions they might take, as well as actions others might take for or against them.\nLYLA\nSince the greatest likelihood is that the characters will find their way to the alley\nthrough Lyla, she’s the first character presented here. When Caine enters the city,\nLilith sets a call to all of her followers to assemble at the alley where the Apostates\nusually gather in disguise. Lyla feels a strong pull toward the site, her Insight warns her\nof a great number of Ancients gathering in one location.

This effect lasts only while Lyla is in Lilith’s presence, unless Lyla\nor someone else does something (probably involving Lilith’s blood) to make it\npermanent. If the characters have chosen to sacrifice Lyla in their ritual against\nLilith, this sacrifice likewise works only in Lilith’s presence.\nSAULOT\nIf the characters are allied with Saulot, he either gives them a signal and\ndirections to the alley or leads them there himself when the time comes. His main\nobjective is to protect Caine from Lilith, so even though he might help the\ncharacters set up their ritual (if they’re performing one), as soon as Caine arrives,\nSaulot defends him directly.\nUnfortunately for Saulot, the original owner of the body he’s using — Tzimisce,\nnot Tremere — has other plans for it. Sometime during the battle, Saulot begins\ngenerating random manifestations of Vicissitude — limbs elongating while fighting,\nwarping the flesh of his attackers seemingly without effort and so on. Whether Saulot\nis wholly consumed or manages to retain some measure of control is up to you. He did\nsuccessfully resist Tremere for centuries, but Tremere also wasn’t an Antediluvian in\nthe root sense of the word. If the Tzimisce Antediluvian does gain full control of Saulot,\nits mind has likely been so twisted by Vicissitude that it will attack everything in sight,\npossibly retaining enough residual knowledge to know that it wants to eat Caine.\nAlternatively, the Ancient might have consciously been hiding within its bloodline\nfor all this time, and it might still be quite coherent — but also still quite hungry.\nCAINE\nUnless he and Lucifer met before the story began, Caine enters this story highly\nupset. After centuries of enjoying his obscurity and solitude, he finds himself forced\nto travel to some unimportant mortal city due to persistent supernatural distur-\nbances. Once he arrives, he feels Lilith’s presence there and makes straight for her\n(just as Lilith knows he will).\nIt’s a toss-up whether Caine would attack Lilith or the Apostates first, but it’s more\nlikely he’d go for the Apostates, as they directly betrayed him. If he does manage to\ndestroy one or more of them, he has to contend with Lilith’s fury directly — but this\nis unlikely because of the sheer number of monstrous children Lilith can use to slow\nhim down. Caine is very much reacting, rather than instigating, and this is one reason\nthe actions of the players’ characters matter so much in the story — Caine is too\narrogant to realize he’s been set up, so if anyone’s going to save him, it has to be them.\nTHE APOSTATES\nIt’s fair to say that Ilyes, Ikopabe, Erinye and Mekhet fight at Lilith’s side\nunswervingly, in whatever ways you see fit, so more treatment of them is not necessary\nhere. Wounded by her obvious dislike of him despite his loyalty, Lucian might betray\nLilith, but that depends on how much of an advantage you want Lilith to have, as well\nas what interactions Lucian has had with your characters throughout the story.\nAs you should already be aware, Eickos is the one true wild card among the\nApostates. If she does reveal herself as the crone, she might draw Caine’s fire from\nLilith and the Apostates long enough to give Lilith a clear shot at him — if she wants\nto help Lilith at all by now. Eickos might assist with the characters’ ritual against\nLilith, or she might try to kill both Lilith and Caine, forcing the characters to choose\nwhom (if anyone) they wish to save.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Once she’s drawn him to the alley,\nshe sends her many children (on both the physical and the astral planes) against him,\nalong with some or all of the Apostates. Because she knows of the sevenfold curse,\nLilith attacks Caine only if she loses her temper — in other words, only if Lyla or one\nof the Apostates should fall by his hand. She has no problem with using the full range\nof her power against anyone who’s aiding Caine, though.\nAFTERMATH\nAny Cainite still standing dies from thinning of the Blood within a few minutes of\nCaine’s death. Those who were Embraced less than 50 years ago and are of high generation\nmight be able to revert to normal mortals. Ghouls automatically revert to normal mortals\nunless they’ve been ghouls for more than their natural life span, in which case they die.\nRevenants and dhampirs may either revert or remain unchanged, at your discretion.\nIf the characters have defeated Lilith, they’ve really shot themselves in the foot,\nas she was the only guaranteed means by which they might survive. Assuming Lilith\nstill exists, she passes judgment on the characters present before returning to her\nGarden. Lilith is a patient woman, and she’s willing to forgive the characters for being\nmisguided — but not for killing any of her “children.” If they killed Lyla or any of the\nApostates, or even treated Lyla badly, she leaves the characters to die, returning to the\nGarden with whomever she has left. If the characters remained neutral or opposed her\nindirectly, she might offer them a drink of her blood, which allows them to survive\nGehenna as ordinary people with no taint of vampire’s blood left in them. All traces\nof Caine’s curse are removed, and the character’s pick up their lives at the age where\nthe Embrace left off. If the characters aided Lilith’s cause, or if they treated Lyla\nparticularly well, Lilith might invite them to join her in her Garden and become lilim.\nAnother option is to have Lilith offer the character’s her blood and have it\ntransform them wholly into lilim, creatures born (like Lilith) to both divine essence\nand mortal bodies.\nWORMWOOD\nWormwood. With that single word, God has called a second Great Flood to\ncleanse the world of Caine and his children. But He will not break His Covenant\nwith Noah. This flood will be different; it will pass unseen by the Children of Seth\nand by all but the most sensitive of Caine’s progeny, its raging waters more spiritual\nthan physical, drowning only those whose time has come.\nWhen it is over, the Curse of Caine will be gone without a trace, its stain on\nCreation washed clean at last.\nA PROPHET EMERGES\nChosen to be a prophet of Gehenna, Alia was born a dhampir, an abomination\ntrapped between the world of the living and the world of the undead. When Alia\nturned 12, something of her divine role became evident. When she first experienced\nmenstruation — the “mark of the moon” — she fell into a feverish state that lasted\nuntil she shed no more blood. When the fever passed, Alia seemed different. Upon\nentering womanhood, she appeared more serious and the look in her eyes seemed to\nbelong to someone far older and wiser.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

She was to find a\nKindred, one whose faith was stronger than all others combined, and give him God’s\nmessage. Over the next few months, Alia heard God’s voice again and again. She did\nnot reveal what she learned, but she did explain that she could no longer stay with\nher family. Only her Caitiff protectors went with her to continue to ensure her safety.\nFinally, after nearly a year of fruitless searching, she found the one she was looking\nfor and delivered unto him no less than the Word of God.\nWandering into an abandoned mission church far from the busy heart of the\ncity, Alia met a beatific Gargoyle named Ferox, who told her that he was God’s\nservant. He told her of his mission to do God’s bidding and that if she believed as he\ndid, she might be spared from His wrath. When Ferox had finished, Alia lifted her\nhead and gazed into the eyes of the monstrosity before her.\nAlia trembled as she revealed God’s message. God would send a flood that\nwould wipe the Kindred from Creation, and that flood would be called Wormwood,\nand it would appear as a star. God wanted Ferox to gather others of his kind according\nto forthcoming signs and to create for them a Sanctuary. When the flood that is\nWormwood is nigh, God will let him know and he will go into the Sanctuary with\nthe other chosen and stay until 40 nights have passed. During that time, the world\nwill be flooded by Wormwood, though only the Children of Caine will taste its bitter\nwaters. After 40 nights it will be over. Those who remained in the Sanctuary will be\nsafe from the flood, but they too will be judged. Those found wanting will be undone.\nThe next evening, the Red Star appeared in the heavens. God’s plan had been\nset in motion and nothing would stop it. Wormwood approached and with it so did\nGehenna. Ferox and Alia gazed at the star and began their journey. They had work\nto do, and the world’s hour was late already.\nLOCKED ROOMS, GUARDED HEARTS\nAlthough this version of Gehenna might be too subtle for some tastes, it is\nsuitable for any group of characters, from the most bestial and diabolic to the most\ncultured and even repentant. It can be played one-on-one for a very personal\nepilogue to an introspective chronicle, or played out in full with a larger troupe for\nan intense roleplaying exercise. Neonates and elders alike will find themselves\nequally challenged, with neither having any assured advantage. If your troupe\nwants to experience Gehenna as something very personal, a grand ending that\nleaves the beaten path and returns instead to the basics of storytelling and dramatic\ndiscovery, “Wormwood” should please. In many ways, this scenario is played out\nlike a classic “locked-room mystery,” as secrets come to light and souls are laid bare\nin the confines of a place no one wanted to be yet no one can escape.\nFORTY NIGHTS OF GEHENNA\nAs has already been noted, the characters can really be of any clan, generation or\nsect; all are welcome. Although God has chosen the most faithful Child of Caine to\nprovide Sanctuary, He intends to fill that Sanctuary with vampires that represent the full\nspectrum of Caine’s children. Simulating this epic gathering might require an intrepid\nstaff of Narrators to play different parts at different times during these sessions. A\nStoryteller might want to recruit additional staff to help fill the varying roles. Fortunately,\nwith proper set dressing, the Sanctuary should be a large enough place that certain key\ncharacters can “disappear” for a time into other areas of the church, allowing others a\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Naturally, this will necessitate a certain degree of coordination\nbetween you and your Narrator staff, but it is not an insurmountable obstacle.\nThe Storyteller should introduce other Kindred who represent examples of\nwhat the troupe is not. If the characters make up a coterie of relatively moral\nCamarilla neonates, they should be complemented with such opposing figures as a\nBlack Hand assassin, a deranged Samedi or perhaps a few truly warped members of\nClan Malkavian. As a Storyteller, you might even want to include a subtle infernalist\ninto the Sanctuary to tempt the virtuous. (After all, God allowed Jesus to be tempted\nin the desert.) There is little doubt that this infiltrator will perish when God judges\nthose in the Sanctuary (perhaps another character will learn the truth and seek to\nredeem him instead of casting him out, and save himself in doing so), but until then\nthey could really spice up the scenario. Maybe not a full soul-lost infernalist, but\nsomeone with those leanings will offer a great roleplaying opportunity.\nSANCTUARY\nIn addition to simply serving as a place of safety from the storm, the Sanctuary also\nprovides an appropriately gothic atmosphere that captures much of the mood of Masquer-\nade. Because it is a house of God, the feelings of damnation and salvation are also evoked,\nand reminders of God’s presence will be impossible for the characters to avoid within the\nchurch’s walls. It is a fitting example of the World of Darkness itself. The church is no longer\na place of active worship, but rather a barely standing ruin that says more about the\ndesperation, tragedy and hopelessness prevalent on Earth than about religious devotion.\nYour choice of play area should reflect this setting as best it can. Playing in a\nlarge, darkened basement or similarly secluded area would be ideal. The play area\nshould be set up with areas for the players to interact on large scales as well as in more\nprivate circumstances. If needed, designated areas could be blocked off using tarps\nor dark sheets to make crude private rooms. If you aren’t comfortable with having\na blanket serve as a stone support wall, have the private rooms be loosely constructed\nfrom actual blankets by prior residents such as the homeless drifters who might have\nentered the Sanctuary in the past.\nSYSTEMS FOR SANCTUARY\nThe following are the special effects of Sanctuary:\n• Sanctuary is supernaturally difficult to notice, causing most people to\noverlook its existence and making it extremely difficult for Kindred or others\nto penetrate it with supernatural perceptions. This means that while the\nSanctuary is not actually invisible, it does go largely unnoticed.\n• Because of Ferox, Sanctuary has an effective True Faith rating of 5.\n• All Disciplines are limited to the Kindred’s True Faith rating + 1,\nmeaning that most Kindred can use only the first power of a Discipline\n(Alacrity, Endurance, Heightened Senses, etc.). Note that this doesn’t mean the\nentire Basic level, but the very first power of the Basic level.\n• Upon awakening, Kindred lose only one Blood Trait every 10 days,\nrather than the usual one per day.\n• Once Gehenna begins, Sanctuary is impregnable to all Kindred who\nhave not been Chosen. Even the Chosen, should they forgo the protection of\nSanctuary, will be unable to return.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Throughout these events, this remains the case, meaning that most of Caine’s\nchildren won’t even really know the nature of the sudden affliction they experience.\nAlmost no mortals will have any idea that anything unusual is occurring, but only the\nChosen will be spared as vampires around the world feel the wrath of God’s judgment.\nSome characters will inevitably believe they have a way to trick God and escape\nHis wrath, and not by entering the Sanctuary provided. Some might decide to hide\ndeep in the earth (or even become part of it), while others might choose to go into the\nastral plane or some other realm of existence to sit out the flood, hoping that they can\njust come on back when everything is over. It’s nice that they think so, but Wormwood\nis a judgment from the divine. Everything is part of God’s Creation, so everything is\nsubject to the power of Wormwood and the cold justice it brings. That means no tricks,\nno dodges, no hope of escape. No matter how many levels of Disciplines a Kindred has\nor how clever she thinks she is, Wormwood will find her and pass sentence in the end.\nTHE EFFECTS OF WORMWOOD\nEssentially, everyone exposed to Wormwood’s effects suffers a heightened and\nhighly debilitating form of the Withering. All losses are measured in days as opposed\nto weeks or months, each use of a Blood Trait automatically causes Discipline loss,\nand diablerie doesn’t stave off the effects (not that the undead don’t try it). In\naddition, the maximum Generation of all Kindred drops by one every two nights, so\nthat all Kindred are effectively 15th generation by the 27th night.\nEventually even the capacity to contain blood in their system fades. Each\nevening after the 27th, every vampire’s maximum blood pool decreases by one until\nthe 37th night, when they can no longer maintain any vitae in their withered bodies.\nAt this point, only constant introduction by artificial means could possibly enable\na vampire to sustain himself any longer. Without such extreme measures, any\nvampire who is still around slips into torpor. Given the fact that they no longer have\nthe ability to contain vitae, create vitae or otherwise acquire vitae in this state, such\ntorpid Kindred meet their Final Death no later than sunrise on the morning after the\n37th night as Wormwood’s flood quietly takes them as well.\nThese conditions also affect ghouls, revenants and dhampirs. Any beings with\nCaine’s blood in their system suffer until all have been extinguished and the last\ntraces of the Curse of Caine are purged from the world.\nTHE LONGEST NIGHT ENDS\nThe story begins three nights before Wormwood first rains its bitter flood down\nupon the world. Ferox and Alia have been in the city for a few weeks already, seeking\nshelter in an old, abandoned church in the most neglected part of town. If you do not\nfully wish to introduce them into your existing story, feel free to mention them only\nin rumors and unverified sightings. The two have come to the city as a result of their\nongoing search for the Chosen, still unsure how many of these special Kindred they\nmust find and when Gehenna will come.\nAlready a number of the Chosen have found their way to the city, but none have\nyet figured out where it is they must go.

Use this\nfor your setting, perhaps at first using misdirection to hint that some kind of invasion\nor takeover is imminent. The truth will be coming soon enough anyway.\nON THE EVE OF GEHENNA\nSince the players are going to be among the Chosen, you should make them feel that\nfate had some hand in their being in the right place at the right time (as opposed to their\nbeing Chosen having to do with them just being the players). Perhaps a series of\ncoincidences drives them all to the Sanctuary in the final hour. Don’t strong-arm them into\nposition, but plan for delicate and believable reasoning. Maybe that Ventrue “just happens”\nto be meeting with a real estate developer in that neighborhood, while the Nosferatu is\nfollowing him on an “anonymous” tip, and the Brujah gang is chasing a rival gang member\nwho happened to run into that neighborhood. If possible, sow the seeds to put the characters\nin the right neighborhood at the right time sessions or even stories in advance, preferably\nas a minor footnote. If that Ventrue has had this “routine meeting” on his schedule for four\nmonths, having it turn out to be so critical will seem much more mystical.\nTHE BELL TOLLS\nThe precise hour that Gehenna begins is not really important, but the\ncharacters should be no more than a couple of blocks away from the Sanctuary when\nit does. The first thing to happen is the tolling of the church bell that only the\nChosen can hear. It does not ring just once, but continues to peal loudly, signaling\nthat it is time to seek Sanctuary. Characters with some kind of Awareness or Auspex\ncould be given a Simple Test to understand that urgency is called for, though they\nmight not understand why. They just have an instinctual and unnerving sensation\nthat something terrible is looming over them.\nEach of the Chosen has found his way to the Sanctuary at this final moment,\nthough like the characters, none expected the others. As is to be expected, each will\nbe wary, many likely wondering aloud just what kind of trick this is. Some might even\nprepare to defend themselves against the other strange vampires, or from whatever\nancient fiend or power has summoned them here. They really won’t have enough\ntime for introductions or fighting at this point, however. Gehenna is upon them, and\nthe instinct to survive will take precedence over all their other urges.\nOnly moments after the Chosen come face-to-face with one another in front of\nthe church, the most sensitive Kindred will watch as Wormwood appears to go\nsupernova before their unbelieving eyes and the entire night sky suddenly blazes\nbrilliant red. This unexpected flash does not actually blind a viewer for more than a\nsecond or two, but it’s certainly enough to elicit a look of shock and incredulity from\nthose who are able to witness the spectacle. Moments after the supernova, Wormwood\nwill appear to have grown prodigiously. From the Red Star will begin to pour a great\nwaterfall of crimson mist that quickly becomes a cloud of strange fog rolling quickly\nacross the land in every direction. Those characters who cannot directly perceive\nWormwood will still feel something ominous that gives them pause and leaves them\nfeeling a terrible sense of impending doom, every hair on their body standing on end.\nBy now it should be frighteningly clear to the characters, as well as to most of the\nChosen, that whatever it is that is happening, it is definitely not good. Even their arsenal\nof Disciplines will not guarantee surviving the fast-approaching fog.

The rest of the Chosen will rush as quickly\nas possible for the church, each following the lead of the others as much as the odd\ncompulsion that tells them that somehow, this house of God might provide Sanctuary.\nIf for some reason the characters wish to stand at the open doors and watch what\nis happening outside, describe how the floodwaters of Wormwood roll past like a\nsmothering cloud and suck the doors closed as if they caused a tremendous vacuum.\nThis should be a moment when suddenly there is silence and a whole new chapter\nis about to begin, not just for the characters, but for all Kindred. No character can\nprevent or hasten this final closing — they can forget locking out rivals or\nundesirables, if others are meant to be judged, it will not be by the characters.\nINTO THE FIRE\nOnce the Sanctuary doors have closed, the characters and the rest of the\nChosen will have a chance to look around. Inside, the church is even more ruinous\nthan its exterior suggests. Almost nothing of value remains in the entire place, and\nmost of the areas off the central nave are either devastated from fire and collapse or\nentirely impassable, blocked by rubble. Even though most of the stained-glass\nwindows are broken, the flood outside cannot enter. To the eyes of those who can\nsee it, a red mist appears to simply wash past without coming inside. You might wish\nLEAVING SANCTUARY\nIf one or more characters chooses to leave the church and venture even\na step outside its protection at any time during the 40 nights of the flood, they\nwill be tainted by Wormwood and suffer the full effects already discussed. In\naddition, they will not be able to enter the Sanctuary again, for they have\neffectively turned their back on God’s offer of salvation.\nThere is one very special case, however, that allows a Kindred who has left\nto return to Sanctuary even in the middle of the flood. It can occur only if the\nKindred who exits does so to perform some action that is truly selfless and\ndemonstrates the very essence of humanity. If this happens, and the character in\nquestion truly believes he has sacrificed his own chance at salvation to do one last\nact of goodness, then if he does come back to the church, he will find that not only\nmay he reenter, but upon doing so, all the effects of Wormwood will vanish as if\nhe had never left the Sanctuary in the first place. If the same character tries it again\nor another Kindred decides to play copycat without a similarly selfless motive,\nthere will be no turning back. Like the rest of the world’s Kindred, the rest will be\nunable to ever again breach the Sanctuary and must accept their tragic fate.\nYou and your staff should be ready to narrate this type of scene in case someone\ntries to take up this course of action. To avoid “screwball” attempts to leave, you\nmight want to give a test for Awareness or Instinct as the character tries to cross the\nthreshold of the church, letting them know that this would be a “bad idea.” It is\nhighly recommended that you keep this escape clause secret, even from the player\ninvolved, and make everyone wonder about why they were allowed to return. If\nnecessary, give selfless players a test or two to realize they can return, but only after\nthe task is done, and preferably only once they have just about given up hope.\nOtherwise, you might have all the players clamoring to go for “selfless reasons.”\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Speaking quietly yet\nforcefully, they tell the Kindred of the 40 nights they are to remain together and that\nGod has promised that should they redeem themselves, salvation awaits each and\nevery one of them. The rest of the Kindred, however, even the Dark Father himself,\nwill be no more. Finally, Ferox will warn the Chosen not to leave the premises if they\nwish to survive another night, but he also makes it clear that he will not stop anyone\nwho chooses to refuse God’s offer of salvation.\nHELL IS OTHER PEOPLE\nFor the next 40 nights, the Chosen and God’s two agents will spend their every\nwaking hour trapped in the cathedral with only each other as company, doing their\nbest to deal with the situation. Daylight hours will be spent sleeping under pews, in\nthe confessionals, in the choir loft and in the various small sacramental and\nhousekeeping rooms near the altar that are still accessible. The Kindred in the\nSanctuary will have to find ways to pass the time, to handle their hungers and urges,\nand to come to terms with Gehenna.\nThe scenarios that follow are intended to challenge the characters on a variety\nof levels as a way for them to redeem themselves. They are not meant to replace\nanything else going on in the Sanctuary — and, in fact, can be completely discarded\nif the Storyteller has a better way for God to test the characters — but they will probably\nbe useful even if only as a guide as to how to approach this difficult part of the story.\nThere is no particular order in which these scenarios need to take place, and none\nrequires that another occur before or after. Each is a self-contained situation that can\nbe plugged in at any time that the Storyteller feels it might be appropriate.\nKeep in mind that besides these little dramas, nearly anything can be going on\namong the Chosen as they wait for the end of Gehenna. It is very likely that most of\ntheir time will simply be spent in conversation, getting to know one another, arguing\nabout their beliefs and views, and maybe even striking alliances and friendships that\nthey hope will serve them after the worst has ended. Do not underestimate the amount\nof drama that can come from putting enough of these personalities under one roof.\nWhile these scenarios are provided to make sure that they don’t just sit around for 40\nnights, great debates and philosophical conversations among the Kindred should be\nhighly encouraged — this is Mind’s Eye Theatre, after all.\nThe Call for Help\nThe Chosen hear gunshots outside, followed by the squealing of tires, which\ndraws their attention to the church doors or a window. From their vantage, they see\nthat a man is lying on a nearby curb, blood seeping from his body as a dark-colored\nMercedes roars away. The few people who were close enough to witness the scene\nsimply stare, then hurry on as if nothing happened, making no attempt to call\nattention to the crime, to summon the authorities or to help the man. As the\ncharacters watch, they notice the man move slightly, trying to lift an arm, and they\nhear his weak voice calling for help, but no one comes to his aid, fearful of reprisal\nor simply too jaded by life’s horrors to feel any compulsion to intervene.

Surely all manner of schemes\nFORTY DAYS OF NIGHT\nSo how do you play out 40 nights of passing time in Mind’s Eye Theatre?\nThere are a few options for an ambitious Storyteller. One of the first suggestions\nto come to mind is to condense the time so that only the important nights in\nSanctuary are represented with actual game sessions, while less interesting nights\nare handled in downtime. Doing so could create a marathon couple of sessions,\nhowever, and your players could become fatigued, thus costing you some of your\nstory tension. Or this scenario could be run in a series of game sessions all held\nin the same location (perhaps not the whole 40 nights, but three or even four\nsmaller sessions building to the dramatic conclusion).

It’s not God’s judgment\noutside, but Caine’s, and only those that show unflinching fear and obedience to the Father\nof All Vampires will survive. Naturally, a Noddist or follower of the Path of Caine is most\nlikely to start this rumor, but it can come from anywhere, and once it starts, it can grow to\nbecome near hysteria in time. This situation is best introduced quietly early on, and then\nsubtly built up as time passes. It’s easy to dismiss in the beginning, but as fear and tension\nmounts, some Kindred will look for anything they can to assuage their fear, and the notion\nthat the First Vampire is among them might just do it.\nVariations on this theme include Lilith, an ancient Inconnu, a powerful\ninfernalist or even one or more of the Antediluvians. (This last option is especially\npopular if a large number of one or two clans make up the Chosen.)\nRepent!

Having one or two\nfamous “signature” personalities from Vampire trapped with your characters\ncan add a great deal of power and drama to the situation, particularly if they also\nhappen to be personalities that the characters know about or have dealt with\nin the past. What are these famous Kindred doing now that they see their world\nending and their carefully laid plans coming to nothing? Do those trapped with\nthem pay them respect, or is each one just one more Lick now that Gehenna\nis here? As long as you make sure that the Narrators are prepared to play these\nwell-known parts, and these personalities don’t overshadow the players and\ntheir struggles, having a few of these distinctive personalities imparts both the\ngravity of what’s going on and a sense of continuity with the larger setting.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

He is a cranky old bastard, utterly fearless and\nprobably more than a bit crazy, but he is certainly not stupid. He will not give in to\ndemands that he leave and will instead do everything in his power to engage the\ncharacters in conversation, eager to discuss sins, redemption, salvation, damnation and\nanything else along those lines. The man will not allow himself to be lured into the\nchurch under any circumstances, if he can help it. Though he will talk with anyone, he\ntrusts no one.\nDo the characters do their best to ignore him? Do they see him as a possible threat,\nperhaps drawing too much attention to the arcane church? Are they interested in his\nviews? Could he be another messenger from God, or is he just a meal to quench their\nhunger? What if he spouts off something that sounds a little too much like the actual truth\nbehind Gehenna? What do the characters do then?\nRED RAIN\nFor 40 nights, the characters, the rest of the Chosen, Ferox and Alia have remained\ninside the Sanctuary, safe from God’s wrath. Some might not have survived the passing\nof time, but most probably have, at least physically. Now the final night of Gehenna has\ncome. This is the night when the fog will finally lift and the only vampires left will be\nthose in the church. Outside its marred granite walls, the world is dark, but that darkness\nis not as deep as it used to be. For a few hours more, however, the characters are still inside.\nThey are still facing each other and, far more importantly, facing God’s final judgment.\nSalvation was never guaranteed them, only the possibility of salvation.\nThe Kindred will probably be more energized than they have been since the first\nfew nights of their seclusion, each feverishly wondering exactly what will happen now\nthat Gehenna is supposed to end. For those who are still up and about, they will\nprobably be excited at the possibility that they have survived the storm and will now\nbe some of the only vampires still around. They might start plotting how together with\nthe other Chosen they can start a new race of Kindred, never again bowing to the now-\ndeceased vampires who once lorded over them. It is likely that some will begin making\nlast-minute alliances and deals as they think about their new unlife ahead, while some\nmight start thinking about who they wish to Embrace once they leave.\nOf course, that kind of scheming and planning not only proves that they have not\nfigured out what God’s judgment on the Kindred has been, but it is certainly not what\nGod would see as the mark of someone seeking redemption. It should likely spell doom\nfor that vampire no matter how nobly she acted during Wormwood’s flood.\nAt least one of the Chosen might start thinking that now might be a good time\nto try to take out all the other Kindred. He might reason that if the rest are destroyed,\nthen he will be like a new Caine, the father of all future vampires and, in some sense,\nthe “winner” of Gehenna. Of course, such a Kindred will have to believe that he\nreally is safe from God; that perhaps what has been happening outside is not really\ndivine justice. Even given Ferox’s formidable powers, the megalomaniac might still\nbe able to pull something off. And what if he has secret allies to help him stage this\nbloody purge? Desperation makes for strange alliances, as well as powerful foes.\nTHE MORNING AFTER\nGehenna concludes just before dawn, but the end will not come quietly for the\nChosen.

Anything the Kindred can use to hide from the sun’s full glare will be ripped\naway. Ferox and Alia will kneel in prayer near the altar and ignore what is happening,\ntrusting that God will protect them. Most debris is simply blasted away, leaving the\nChosen unharmed, but without protection from the morning light just moments away.\nAnd then the sunlight strikes, blazing into the church as brilliantly as any\nsunrise could, its magnificent rays bathing every inch of the place inside and out,\nleaving no place untouched. Now is the moment when everyone’s fate is revealed,\nwhen each of the Chosen learn what is to become of them. Did they redeem\nthemselves, or does God find them wanting?\nThose vampires who have redeemed themselves, who truly understand what it\nmeans to be human, will find that every last shred of the Curse of Caine is blasted from\nthem — every vampire weakness, every ability, every craving, every fear. God’s light\nscourges the Curse from their body and soul as if they had never been Embraced, and they\nbecome mortal again. It is as if they had not aged a moment since the wrenching night\nwhen they were dragged into the world of nightmare that has been their existence for\nhowever long. They are once again living and breathing, once again human and whole.\nStorytellers should use this time to describe not only the physical changes that\ntake place for certain characters (Gangrel lose any animal features, the Nosferatu\nappear normal, even the Samedi have healthy features), but to also describe the\nexpressions and spoken feelings of the others who have been made mortal.

Your players could be front and center for\nthese events or simply feel their aftershocks. As always, use what works best for you and\nyour individual game setting. This is a grand finale, though, and your sessions should\nhave the special attention deserving of a powerful conclusion either way.\nMASQUERADE’S END\nSome players might feel that their characters never get a chance to play an\nimportant role in Cainite affairs. As a Storyteller, this is your chance to give such\nplayers what they want. If you so choose, they can become the most important Kindred\nin the world: the vampires responsible for finally destroying the Masquerade.\nAnd they say you never let them have any fun.\nAs Storyteller, watch for a moment when the characters perform some act that\nis completely impossible for mortals. Typical examples include a character being\nshot repeatedly but remaining obviously unharmed, Thaumaturgy use, incautious\nfeeding or even the result of a feud with another supernatural group.\nIt’s up to you as a Storyteller to decide when and where this slip takes place. Even\nif the characters are careful, mistakes can always occur. In this case, the mistake will\nset forth a chain of events that will change the existence of vampires everywhere. But\nsomehow, someone does see the characters… and she has a video camera. A lot of\npeople now carry these things everywhere they go, so this is hardly implausible. The\nmortal records the characters without their knowing it. It’s something that vampires\nthe world over having been fearing would eventually take place.\nYour players should feel that this is the inevitable tear in the curtain of the Masquerade\nthat was just waiting to happen, however, and not a well-planned Storyteller event. They\nmight not even realize the magnitude of what has happened until it’s too late. To avoid\nbitter resentment, arguments or feelings of being railroaded, however, make the scenario\nplausible while still being inescapable. If you like, you can even give astute or investigative\ncharacters a glimpse that makes it appear like some larger vampiric power(s) might be\nmanipulating events… to ensure discovery of the Kindred? But who would benefit from\nsuch open violation of the Masquerade and the terrible war that is sure to follow?\nWho, indeed.\nIN THE WRONG HANDS\nThe mortal with the camera shows her footage to a local TV news team. They have\nexperts look for evidence of camera tricks while a reporter tries to find the identities of the\ncharacters.

Unless special steps have been taken, the\nreporter finds the character’s identity. If the character keeps a legally recorded residence,\nthe reporter finds that too. If the character is legally dead, the reporter finds that data even\nmore interesting. Perhaps the reporter follows the characters and sees them interacting with\nother vampires in your setting, thus tying them into this growing conspiracy as well.\nSoon after, the news team knows the identities and has investigated the paper trails\nof at least some of the characters.

The characters may need to evade\neveryone from the FBI to the Centers for Disease Control. Their elders and superiors will\nbe clamoring to hush up the incident, using whatever resources they have to spare. More\nimportant events take up their attention soon enough, however.\nFULL DISCLOSURE\nInevitably, some other Kindred breaks his silence on the matter. If the players’\ncharacters escape the hunt, some other Cainite decides he wants to be famous on\ntelevision by telling everything. (Maybe he even wants a book deal for this\ninterview.) Perhaps some younger and more rebellious vampires take advantage of\nsituation to finally blow the lid off the game of their elders once and for all. They\nbegin talking to as many different parts of the media as possible, spreading the word\nfar too quickly to stop all the leaks. The small tear in the Masquerade quickly\nbecomes a jagged gash. The names of clans are being openly discussed by fascinated\nmortals on television talk shows and in office cubicles across the country.\nUNLIVES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS\nIf you desire to delay the impending conflict and bloodshed somewhat, simply\nhave a few more “photogenic” Kindred come forward and speak on behalf of\nvampire society. Those who achieved fame in life as artists, generals, statesmen and\nthe like are good candidates, though really any older Kindred can become a\ncelebrity as a “living history” specimen for social scientists to study. This is a time\nfor socially adept and manipulative characters to shine. Unrestricted by the need\nto operate in secrecy, they can negotiate all manner of deals and enjoy their\nnewfound status in public, at least for a time. Indeed, it might even seem as though\na lasting peaceful concord between vampires and mortals might be possible, and\nsome Cainites dare to think that the Masquerade’s end might not doom the\nKindred after all. It’s not true, at least not if the timeline of this scenario is to be\nfollowed, but it’s a pleasant fiction for the characters nonetheless.\nSTRIKE A MATCH\nNo matter what the initial reaction of the world might be, eventually someone\nwill slip. Perhaps a Tzimisce haven, or the leftover corpse from a depraved Nosferatu\nfeeding is uncovered. Maybe a Malkavian loses it on the air and attacks everyone is\nsight. The world is faced with the horror of what vampires really are. They aren’t sexy\nactors leaning seductively against lampposts — they are monsters. What started as\na media curiosity is quickly turned to fear and hostility.\nNot every country declares war on Cainites, and even those that do differ widely\nin how well they fight. In the developed world, the Kindred face squads of soldiers\narmed with infrared scopes, night-vision goggles and high-powered weaponry. In\nmany Third-World countries, corrupt governments and militaries prove laughably\neasy for Cainites to bribe or avoid. Most of the danger comes from poorly armed but\nnumerous local militias, fervent and able to act during the day.\nThe extent to which this New Inquisition takes place in your setting is really\nup to you.

They can be used in your\nsetting to give your players a front-row seat to the final battle of the Antediluvians.\nThe Ancients clash with one another in the open now, sensing that some kind of end\nis near. What part your players take in these events is a challenge to your game. They\ncan be there for the whole thing, or they might only have to deal with the ripples in\ntheir small corner of the world.\nHow long does the war between Kindred and kine last? Simply put, it lasts as\nlong as the Storyteller and players find it interesting. If the players are having fun\nusing their skills, resources and supernatural powers to simulate a large-scale conflict\nof this nature, by all means, let them enjoy themselves. If they are bored with warfare\nand logistics, however, feel free to step up the timetable a bit. After all, both sides\nhave more than enough power to do so if they desire. In the end, no one ever knows\nwhether the mortals could exterminate the Kindred before the undead rally and take\ncomplete control — greater powers decide the issue.\nFIRST STRIKES\nThe deaths of so many Kindred resonate back to the Antediluvians, and before\nlong, the Ancients begin to rise. All of the Ancients start by devouring many of their\ndescendants, along with any other Kindred they can find. The Antediluvians are\nmore than 10 millennia old. Only the blood of fellow vampires can sustain them, and\nonly the vitae of Methuselahs can fully slake an Antediluvian’s thirst.\nOnce they are sated (at least for the moment), they turn their eye to humanity\nand begin conquering as they see fit, using their vast powers and legions of servants\nto summon up armies in the blink of an eye and lay claim over vast regions in mere\nmonths or weeks. Again, this conflict can last as long as the players find it interesting.\nIf they submit immediately to avoid destruction, so be it, but if they wish to continue\non as a guerrilla movement, give them time to continue their efforts.\nThe Withering affects the Ancients, at least somewhat, and renders their power\nless than what it might have been. This is good, at least for the characters, as it means\nthat it is actually conceivable to stand against one of these beings, with sufficient\npower and preparation. They remain some of the mightiest creatures ever to walk the\nWorld of Darkness, however, and when their will is set, Kindred and kine fall before\nthem like grain before the scythe.\nIf not for the elder Kindred’s war to cripple the governments that hunt them,\nhumanity might have won the fight. Reduced in power as they are, the Ancients\ncannot survive massed machine gun fire or thermite bombs fired from two miles\naway. The tattered mortal governments, however, can no longer muster such\ntechnologically advanced firepower. The soldiers destroy a few Methuselahs at first,\nbut the Ancients quickly learn from their mistakes, and before long, any kind of\nsignificant human resistance is stamped out.\nEMPIRES OF BLOOD\nWhen the first Antediluvians begin their reign, the world looks very different\nfrom how it did just a year before.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Within the cities, mortals labor to\nbuild strong havens for their undead masters and rebuild some of the amenities —\nrunning water, for instance — to which younger Kindred became accustomed.\nAnyone who cannot work in some capacity — because of age, injury, sickness or\nexhaustion — gets thrown in a pen and served to any vampire who feels hungry.\nNaturally, the system is not tightly controlled. Cainites who are not utterly\nsubsumed by an Antediluvian’s will still scheme for favor and chances to diablerize\neach other. The Ancients also show little concern for anything that does not involve\ntheir arcane agendas, their personal security or the food chain, making it possible for\ncautious characters to survive within their territory if they move carefully and do not\nattract the attention of the Ancient one to them directly.\nSome possible examples of the reign of different Antediluvians are provided.\nStorytellers can also reference Gehenna for more information on a specific Antedilu-\nvian, or they can use these cases as a starting point to design their own nightmarish\nscenario. There is very little beyond the power of the Ancients if they truly desire it,\nand that can serve as the fodder for any number of fantastic and terrifying scenarios.\nREIGN OF MALKAV\nKindred mythology includes no tales about the destruction of the Malkavian clan’s\nfounder. A few legends say that Malkav sleeps in a ruined city somewhere in the Middle\nEast, but no one who followed these legends ever found any trace of the Antediluvian.\nMalkav no longer exists as a corporeal entity. Lunacy’s Master retained stronger\nties to its childer than did most Antediluvians. Many times in Kindred history,\nMalkavians displayed an uncanny coordination between their deeds, with no\napparent way for them to communicate. The occasional spontaneous gatherings of\nMalkavians lent further credence to the notion of a “Malkavian Madness Network”\nthat linked the clan. That “network” was nothing less than every Malkavian’s blood-\ntie to their progenitor. Although Malkav slept the torpor of centuries, it watched the\nworld through the eyes of its unknowing progeny.\nSome years ago, various upsets among the Kindred troubled Malkav’s sleep. The\nAncient did not think about what it did; it acted without conscious volition as one\nacts in dreams. Nevertheless, Malkav desired to see through more eyes than usual,\nso it strengthened its bond to its childer. The Ancient indeed placed its entire being\ninto the Madness Network and left the useless husk of its body to crumble away. As\nits founder spread, the clan itself changed. For centuries, Camarilla Malkavians\nlearned Dominate instead of the clan’s ancient Discipline of Dementation. Malkav\nbrought Dementation back to all his childer, whether they wanted it or not.\nMalkav wakes up with the other Antediluvians and tries to subsume all its\nprogeny. Every Malkavian he overcomes becomes a vehicle for his consciousness.\nThe Ancient becomes one mind, one will, which happens to occupy more than\n1,000 bodies at once. Subsumed Lunatics seldom speak, but they can act together\nwith perfect coordination… at least when Malkav wants them to do so.\nTHE QUEST FOR COMPLETION\nSome Malkavians resist their ancestor’s soul-devouring will.

For a free Malkavian, or\nanyone who learned Dementation or ever diablerized a Lunatic, any meeting with a\nsubsumed Malkavian is a meeting with Malkav itself.\nA subsumed Malkavian can approach a free Malkavian character whenever the\nStoryteller thinks it would make a good story. The Ancient might send one of its bodies\nhundreds or thousands of miles to collect a character. Malkav does not seek its childer\nin an efficient, organized manner, though, and he might miss a character completely.\nAn encounter with subsumed Malkavians should be a chilling experience.\nSome have gotten use to the idea that the Lunatics are harmless or even playful. Now\nhowever, they are of one ancient mind. Your Narrators might need to practice to gain\nthis desired effect, perhaps memorizing certain phrases and practicing turning heads\nand madly grinning in complete unison. Malkav’s direct influence comes and goes,\nbut having a group of Lunatics suddenly snap to attention and turn their focus all to\none player should be enough to unnerve even the most steel-willed Kindred.\nA MADNESS FOR MORTALS\nMalkav also draws mortals into its veil of madness. Like Dementation, this\npower acts without regard for the current strength of Caine’s curse in a vampire.\nMalkav’s mortal victims can work together, though, if the Ancient demands it.\nIndeed, Malkav’s bodies often walk with a retinue of mortals who feed and serve\nit. When Malkav does not need its minions, these mortals howl and gibber, leap\nabout, beat themselves or each other with sticks, feed, couple and sleep when\nthey tire, like beasts. These “bacchantes” are something else the players can\nencounter on a smaller scale in their own setting. A mortal friend or relative\nmight even become one of these cursed creatures, inspiring an effort to depose\ntheir raving master and find some way to restore them to sanity.\nTRIUMPH OF LUCIDITY\nIt’s hard to imagine what could kill a multi-bodied psychic entity like Malkav.\nNevertheless, it is possible, if the characters and their allies are clever and persistent\n— and perhaps just a little bit mad themselves. If they succeed, all Malkavians suffer\nfrom intense fratricidal madness and attempt to wipe each other out, apparently\ndesperate to hide all remaining evidence of what Malkav has done.\nUnless every single clan member is accounted for, however, a shadow of Malkav’s\nhive-mind endures. Pockets of coordinated activity might remain for quite some time,\nrequiring thorough cleansing to ensure that no more lunatic kings emerge in the dark\ncorners of the world. Bands of bacchantes stay together as well, their minds permanently\nlost regardless of the outcome of the great battle. While truly potent Disciplines or inspired\nroleplaying might offer some hope to these poor souls, most are doomed to endless madness.\nTruly sadistic Storytellers might even allow characters to believe they have\nended the threat, only to have it begin festering anew in the cracks of sanity, slowly\nrebuilding once more…\nREIGN OF LASOMBRA\nFor centuries, Lasombra vampires boasted of how they destroyed their clan’s\nfounder in the Anarch Revolt.

After all, the Ancient’s\ndiablerie had plenty of witnesses, and it wasn’t that long ago, as Cainites reckon such\nthings. These Sabbat remember that the Lasombra gifts include the power to twist\nthoughts and alter memories.

Some more humane Kindred\nmight seek out a confrontation with the Ancient in hopes of sparing the world utter\ndestruction. Indeed, after a suitable chase, it might even allow them to think that\nthey are the ones to “defeat” it and return light to the world.\nReversal of Fortune\nAfter three weeks of darkness (or however long the characters take to finish\ntheir plan and confront the creature), lightning flashes in the sky and thunder booms\nin the darkness.

Naturally,\nif the players actually mustered the courage to hunt the Ancient, these events could\nbe the apparent result of their efforts to destroy the creature, perhaps even the last\nthing one of the mortally wounded group sees before going on to Final Death.\nAs suddenly as it began, the Reign of Lasombra is apparently ended.\nOr has it? While the pall of night has dispersed, it’s entirely possible that it has\ndone so precisely because that’s what the Ancient desires. It has engineered its own\napparent destruction before, after all. This sudden reversal should not be presented as\na “happily ever after” moment, but rather, a cause for increased paranoia.

Will\nit re-form and return from the Abyss in some new shape, or is it gone forever?\nEven if the players believe they have successfully defeated the Ancient, a\ncunning Storyteller can keep them jumping at, well, shadows for quite some time,\nnever quite sure whether the darkness is looking back.\nREIGN OF GANGREL\nNoddist legends name the Gangrel founder Ennoia, but as with all the\nAntediluvians, almost nothing is really known about the First Gangrel. Every student\nof Cainite myth agrees, however, that the Gangrel owe their unique aptitude for the\nProtean Discipline to their founder, who surely must have been its greatest master.\nMore than a millennium ago, Ennoia began her transformation from Cainite to\nsomething more. She sank into the earth, deeper than any other Cainite could\nimagine. She spread her substance further, thinner, touching the rocks at the roots\nof mountains and hearing the tolling of earthquakes.\nShe sank deeper still, century after century, learning the slow dreams of the drifting\ncontinents and feeling the vast tides and currents that propel them. She sank into the\nrealms where hot stone flows like water and was not burned; for Fortitude was another gift\nto her clan. She spread and sank until she reached the very heart of the planet.\nEnnoia did not lose all her connection to the Cainite race, though.

The creature tries to absorb them\njust as other Antediluvians try to subsume their childer. Any being who is slain by\nthe shadow-creature is immediately embraced by the Ancient’s oozing shadows\nand utterly consumed, leaving no shred of physical evidence behind. It requires no\ntest to hit unless the Storyteller feels it is dramatically appropriate to allow one, and\nit typically inflicts at least three health levels of aggravated damage per strike.\nOne can attack the shadow-creature, though most strikes do little good. The\nAncient draws on the infinite power of the Abyss — nothing known to Cainites\ncan destroy it. At best, characters can force it back to the Abyss by exposing the\nshadow-creature to true sunlight, or by attacking it with fire. At the Storyteller’s\ndiscretion, more esoteric Thaumaturgy or obscure Paths might also have some\neffect. Indeed, finding a suitable “lost ritual” to harm the creature or send it back\nto the Abyss might make a good story to give the players hope when battling the\nAncient. The creature vanishes and then dissipates once the total damage from\nwhatever sunlight or fire effects the characters inflict upon it exceeds 20 health\nlevels.

Each time Ennoia\nclaims another victim, the result is a powerful but localized earthquake… usually in the\nheart of a major metropolitan area. She feeds only at night — a relic of her Cainite past.\nAround the world, city after city collapses into final ruin as she inexorably seeks out\nher prey. Storytellers may even use Ennoia’s activity to indirectly aid characters\nsuffering under the rule of another Ancient. While the Antediluvian struggles to put\nan end to these strange attacks, the characters might find freedom to take the actions\nthey must in order to depose the Ancient and restore their own form of order.\nCharacters will likely first learn of the threat when they find themselves in the\nsame vicinity as a target elder when Ennoia feeds. They have a chance to escape, but\nmore astute characters should realize that such is the case only because they are not\nthe targets of her attack. For dramatic effect, in fact, this scene works best if the\ncharacter is free to run. The point is to show a scene of awful, apocalyptic destruction\nwithout killing a player’s character. From that point on, once they hear other reports\nand begin putting pieces together, it might be possible for those who become aware\nof what is happening to try to hunt down Ennoia and put an end to her predation.\nWithout some serious magic and some very clever planning, however, chances are\ngood that the only thing the characters do is attract her eye and find the ground\nopening into a lava-filled maw under their own feet one night. After all, how does\none fight the earth itself, much less defeat it?\nFortunately for the characters, Ennoia does not continue her hunt forever regardless\nof their actions — just until the battles of the Ancients no longer trouble her. Exactly what\nthis means remains up to the Storyteller to decide, although it is strongly recommended that\nthey not depict Ennoia as some kind of “avenging angel” who kills only “evil” elders. While\nthere should be a pattern to her attacks for those wise enough to discover it, Ennoia is beyond\nsuch things as good and evil at this point. Once sated, she returns to sleep, waiting until her\nhunger spurs her to action again. As with many other Antediluvians, unless they manage\nto confront Ennoia directly and have some way of determining that she is truly destroyed,\nthe characters will likely never really know if or when the Reign of Gangrel ends. Therefore,\nGangrel characters never suffer the fratricidal madness caused by an Antediluvian\nforebear’s destruction, but the First Gangrel also never subsumes the will of any of her\ndescendants. They are loners to the end.\nNIGHTSHADE\nAll over the world, ancient beings begin to awake. Some are known in legend\nas the Third Generation of vampires, the Antediluvians. Others are so obscured by\nthe passage of time that history’s annals have long forgotten them. One by one, the\nAncients slowly rise from their torpor, and they cry out in hunger for the blood of\ntheir childer. The Methuselahs are first to awaken, and they pick up the strings to\ntheir childer where they left them.\nThe impact of the psychic disturbance caused as a result of the rise of these\nprimeval creatures impacts every single Cainite in the world. But not only vampires\nfeel it. Ghouls, Lupines, sorcerers and other beings with supernatural awareness of\nsorts, including many psychic (or irrevocably insane) mortals, are also affected.

While elements of the two scenarios can certainly be combined, it is\nbest to remember that one is more focused on the world and global events, while the other\nultimately boils down to a willingness to make right what has been wrong for so very long.\nAROUND THE WORLD BY NIGHT\nThe events of this vision of Gehenna take the characters to exotic locations\nto meet powerful and potent creatures of the night (and kill quite a few of them).\nAs a Storyteller you may be asking yourself, “Am I going to have to narrate my\nentire story as the characters trot around the globe? How do I handle these events\nthat are taking place in regard to my chronicle’s hometown with my players?”\nDon’t panic. For one thing, even if some of the events take place on a global scale\nand are not centered around your chronicle’s events, their echoes will be felt no\nmatter where your players are. Not everything needs to land on their doorstep\nfor it to be part of this scenario. If they do go to chase after it, do your best to\nportray the variety of settings and Narrator characters as well as possible,\npotentially holding such trips as side sessions before calling the characters back\nto their home city again for the regular game. This can be a great roleplaying\nopportunity if the characters wind up splitting into several different “hunting\nteams” and going after different targets. Even just seeing who survived to make\nit back to the city at the next game can be a powerful roleplaying lure.\nIf that’s not your speed, it’s very easy to tailor some of the global events of this\nscenario so that one or two are centered around your setting, putting your players on\nthe world stage before they can prepare for it, playing hosts to history. Even just one\nof the major events of this scenario can be more than enough for a city of Kindred\nto handle. Combined with other terrifying events going on in the background, a true\nsense of the panic and confusion of the End Times is easy to create. After all, while\nthe scenario as written involves hunting down several Antediluvians, there’s no\nreason your entire endgame couldn’t involve the characters trying to take down a\nsingle Ancient that has arisen in their general vicinity. (It’s not like one Antedilu-\nvian and its minions can’t cause more than enough trouble to pose a long-running,\nmulti-level threat to even a high-powered chronicle, after all!) As always, take what\nyou find here and tailor it to your own chronicle.\nGETTING THE PLAYERS INVOLVED\nA Storyteller can involve the troupe in “Nightshade” in many different ways.\nWhile the story has been written for Camarilla-based chronicles first and foremost,\nthis is only by default. Given the nature of the events of this scenario and the\nimplications it has for all vampires — indeed, the entire world — it shouldn’t be too\ndifficult to involve the Sabbat, or even the most standoffish independent clans and\napathetic anarchs. An equally esteemed leader from the other sects can replace\nPieterzoon — be it a Narrator character unique to the game or a more established\ncharacter such as Sascha Vykos for the Sabbat or Jeremy MacNeil for the anarchs.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Not only does doing so put players in the proper frame of mind for\nGehenna, but it also makes the appearance of the Ancients feel like it has been a long\ntime coming, rather than simply being the latest surprise the Storyteller felt like unveiling\nto keep the session interesting. Unless presented in suitably atmospheric context, the\nawakening of even one Antediluvian can seem melodramatic and overdone\nTHE FIEND RISING\nOn two different continents, the Tzimisce Antediluvian awakens. One half is\na soulless monstrosity — the corpse of an ancient undead, living only because of the\nVicissitude that its body is marked by. The other half is little more than a malignant\npresence. (What it is driven by is impossible to say.) The Antediluvian corpse in\nNew York City sustains itself by absorbing any living thing it manages to capture, and\nthose that are not made part of it are left shambling and hungry for the essence of\nlife, with no mind to guide them. The growing monster first breaks through the\nunderbelly of New York City, and then crashes through to street level. This signals\nthe beginning of the nightmares that plague the world.\nThe Camarilla is made aware of the horrors in New York, but at this point, no one\nknows that it is, in fact, an Antediluvian. Jan Pieterzoon, well-known enforcer of the\nCamarilla, arrives and explains that he has been charged by the Inner Council to gather\na group of Kindred to go to New York and find out what this new threat might be. No\none actually knows what is happening over there. Parts of the city have been shut down,\nand the Camarilla is working in overdrive in covering it up. If Storytellers wish to take\nthis route, your troupe could be part of the coterie that Pieterzoon takes into New York.\nThis would take special preparation and narration to carry off successfully, but your\nplayers would have a front seat to the epic battle. Be warned, though, that this battle could\neasily result in the Final Death of more than a few vampires.\nThere can be any number of reasons why the troupe is chosen. Perhaps other capable\nKindred are responding to other threats elsewhere (dealing with the natural disasters and\nfending off the assaults of the other sects and clans that take advantage of them), and the\ncharacters make up the only qualified group ready to go. Perhaps some of the characters\nare still riding the notoriety of defeating some other dire threat in the recent past, while\nanother group of characters might have a special magical item or rare Thaumaturgy ritual\nthat the Inner Circle believes could be vital to the success of the operation. Maybe a\npowerful ally or mentor has recommended them for the job as a favor — this is an\nimportant task, after all, with great potential rewards and Status if they succeed. Perhaps\nconversely a hated rival has suggested them in hopes that they will back down and lose\nface, embarrass themselves in the field or even meet Final Death.\nTailor these reasons to your story based upon the strengths of your characters. Try\nto involve as many characters as possible too. Those who don’t fight directly can still\ngo and act as scouts and researchers, or maybe spin doctors and media control. Don’t\nmake the players feel that they are chosen just because they are your players. Once the\nscene is set up for your troupe, however, it should be made clear to the players that this\nis not an offer to be refused — it is a duty their characters are expected to perform.\nCONSEQUENCES\nTruth be told, the actual battle itself can take as long and be as vivid as you\ndesire.

Make no mistake, it should be a hard and\nhorrifying fight, as they are essentially fighting a giant entity of liquid flesh with the\npower to change shape at will and absorb others into itself whole to replenish itself.\nIt is essentially mindless, though, so it is vulnerable to good strategy — not to\nmention strong Disciplines and heavy firepower.\nAs Pieterzoon and the surviving characters stagger through Manhattan after-\nward, wounded and tired, with a mere hour before the sun rises, they start noticing the\ncrowds that have gathered at different places through the city. And above them hang\nthe big screens of Times Square, showing what the coterie has just been through, on\nCNN’s continuous broadcast. They see themselves at the heights of their Discipline\nusage, frantically using every last bit of their vampiric powers as they struggle to defeat\nthe monster. This is one surreal scene, and it should be described in painstaking detail.\nThese vampires are responsible for breaking the Masquerade on a worldwide scale.\nThe world has watched as frenzying vampires have battled an unspeakable evil\non the streets of New York at night. The Masquerade is broken — no, beyond\nbroken, it is shattered into fine dust on the wind. Camarilla elders from all over the\nworld race to New York to try to fix the damage, but it is too late. All the Influence\non Earth cannot take back what the world has seen.\nNATIONS IN FLUX\nGovernments around the world respond quickly to the information. When it\nbecomes obvious that they won’t be able to dismiss this as a hoax, most begin an\naggressive command-and-control strategy to “contain the undead threat.” In the\nUnited States and across most of Europe, emergency laws are passed requiring vampires\nto register with the authorities or face arrest and possible destruction. Those who resist\nare summarily hunted and destroyed with all the power the government can muster.\nInitial confrontations favor the Kindred, but the mortals learn quickly, and with the\nstrength of numbers and technology behind them, the tide quickly turns to the point\nwhere even the most powerful undead must run and hide rather than risk an open fight.\nThis wave of global change is not so much a single scene as a series of events played\nout over a few panicked sessions. At least a few of the more brazen or incautious characters\n(not to mention any who went with Pieterzoon) should face the intense scrutiny of the\nnew hunting agencies, while others might have a chance to use their Influences and other\nBackgrounds to try to keep their own city from turning into a deathtrap. While they\nmight not be able to restore the Masquerade on a global scale, they shouldn’t feel nearly\nas powerless on a local level. Many other events can be related to your players through\nin-character downtime, especially news updates or word of distant hunts.\nDon’t drag this time out so long that the players grow tired of always running\nand hiding, but make sure that the full weight of what has happened sinks in. The\nworld has changed, and that shouldn’t be a casual thing. After all, it’s likely that at\nleast a few of the characters went with Jan on that fateful mission, and becoming the\nfirst people in the world famed for their vampirism should offer a number of\ninteresting roleplaying opportunities.\nREVELATION\nIf your characters were with Pieterzoon, then the following scene is something\nthat the troupe should actively take part in.

He\nstorms out of the meeting, swearing to make right the lie he has believed for so long.\nCONVENTION OF FIRE\nCainites from all over the world begin arriving for the Convention of Fire that Jan\nhas called. If the characters went with him to New York, he might even call the\nconvention in their city, since facing the same judgment is likely to have made them allies\nif not exactly good friends. For the time being at least, it would seem that Pieterzoon’s\nconvention is the one collective with the most control over its subjects. It accepts only\nthose who display a true commitment to breaking the hold of the Camarilla and the\nSabbat, learning the truth and saving the world from the Ancients. Obviously, it’s no easy\ntask dividing those who are in it only to save their skin from those with true commitment,\nbut most seem to work together, with only minor discrepancies.\nThis radical sub-sect of the Camarilla is to be administered by a council of 12\nvampires, and Pieterzoon, its leader. Pieterzoon is a very just and righteous Cainite,\nand it is generally agreed upon that he will make a fit leader. Rest assured that he will\nonly make executive decisions whenever the council is unable to reach an agree-\nment, and that the council is in effect the main body of management.\nPieterzoon’s suggestion for a name for the sect is the Nephtali, which has\nBiblical significance and literally means “the highest point” or “no further,” used in\nprohibiting an advance or encroachment. In this sense, Pieterzoon intends it as a\npointed reference to how Gehenna shall be stopped, allowed no longer.\nRETURN OF THE DRAGON\nIn Europe, the newly formed Nephtali sub-sect receives a visitor — Etrius, the\nchilde of Tremere, and one-time member of the Tremere Council of Seven. He bears\nthe news that some time ago, the body of Tremere himself, having lain dormant in\nthe crypts beneath the clan’s Vienna chantry, disappeared. No one knew where it\nmight have gone, but most are certain that the Founder himself was not behind the\ndisappearance. A massive search was undertaken, proving fruitless, and an immi-\nnent crisis could have been at hand. Then, a few nights ago, the body of Tremere\nreappeared on the doorstep of the chantry. First there was rejoicing, for the Warlocks\nthought that their Founder had returned. They were very wrong.\nThe being in the form of Tremere went rampant, calling on powers beyond any\nthat were familiar to the Tremere, and it killed all the members of the chantry\nwithout discrimination. Only Etrius managed to flee to relative safety, but only after\nlearning what was happening. The being occupying the body of Tremere was none\nother than the Tzimisce Antediluvian, having somehow “materialized” in Tremere’s\nbody. After killing all Tremere, and most likely many other vampires in Vienna, it\nleft a trail of death and terror behind, moving toward the clan’s head Transylvanian\nchantry of the Tremere, Ceoris. Etrius followed it part of the way, but as it started\nto warp and transform into something best described as a giant, dragon-like monster,\nhe finally lost his nerve and escaped to seek help. No matter what the characters\nmight feel about the Tremere or the Tzimisce in general, this situation seems fairly\nclear-cut. The beast must be stopped before it gains whatever additional power it is\nseeking in the chantry and becomes effectively unkillable.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Should any of your players’ characters be of\neither of these bloodlines, they will be forced to make Self-Control/Instinct Chal-\nlenges once every hour for the night of the conflict. Success means that they can\nresist the urges to violence they are channeling through their respective Antediluvians.\nFailure means that they will immediately seek out any members of the opposing clan\nand attempt to destroy them by any means. Spending a Willpower Trait allows a\ncharacter to resist this urge for one hour. This blood haze will continue until the\nfollowing day, when both Antediluvians are dead.\nEven those who remain at home are not spared part of the horror — they will have\nto hold their city together as Tremere and Tzimisce alike rampage through the streets,\ncaught up in the bloodlust of their founders. Sabbat war parties may try to take advantage\nof the rage of their pack mates and call upon former Camarilla cities. Anyone who had\na grudge against either clan will most likely also use this time to take revenge.\n...AND THERE SHALL COME A SAVIOR\nNot long after the Tremere and Tzimisce destroy each other, a strange collection\nof artifacts comes into the possession of the Nephtali — a number of black stones\ninscribed with strange runes that seem to speak of the history of the Children of Caine\nfrom the beginning all the way through the current disaster. After careful consider-\nation, it is concluded that the stones of Enoch speak of one of the Thirteen accepting\nthe burden of all Children of Caine, saving them from the fires of Purgatory and the\nwrath of God. The “gentle one” as it is called, will die at the hands of another but rise\nagain in a form marked by the End Times, without memory. Those who would stand\nagainst the end will bring him forth, and he will eventually save everyone.\nWhatever sense the characters themselves get from this, Noddists can lend light\nto some parts of the fragment. The “gentle one” is a reference to Saulot, the mysterious\nprogenitor of the now-extinct Salubri bloodline. Those who would stand against the\nend could easily be a prediction of the Nephtali, and, by extension, the characters.\nEtrius of the Tremere undertakes the task of locating Saulot’s current resting\nplace if none of the characters are especially skilled in Thaumaturgy. The ritual first\nperformed over a map of the world, and substituted with more detailed region maps\nas it advances, allowing them to find a fairly good match. Starting out with an atlas\nand moving on to satellite photographs ultimately obtains a match: an isolated\nresearch center outside Sydney, Australia.\nREBIRTH\nTraveling to the research center should be fairly straightforward, and as they\napproach, the characters notice that it has been abandoned and locked down,\napparently for months. The search should not be very long, but after a while the\ncharacters find a confined, restricted area. They don’t need to force their way inside,\nthough — it is open. A quick search turns up a separated room housing a sleeping child,\nbut this sleep is clearly not natural. The records explain that although the child\ndisplayed every sign of being in good physical shape, it has been comatose from birth.\nThe child possesses the soul of Saulot, who unknowingly possessed this form\nafter he became incorporeal when the Dragon assumed his borrowed form. When his\nawakened self was rendered unconscious from the blow, his powerful soul subcon-\nsciously hurled itself through the vast space of the spiritual realm, to the only suitable\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

What is this place? What did those people want?” And then,\nno matter what the characters say or do, his forehead splits open to reveal a third eye,\ndeveloping from nothing right in front of their eyes. If nothing else, that should\nconvince them that this is indeed Saulot.\nThe characters return with the child, to find the Nephtali in as much turmoil\nand trouble as is true of the rest of the world. Many of the members of the council\nhave taken to bitter argument over what the goals of the organization are, some\nfavoring petty revenge over the rest of the Camarilla, some the accumulation of\nknowledge, and others taking action to prevent Gehenna.\nJUDGMENT\nWhile the characters were off securing Saulot and possibly putting out other fires,\nthe researchers who are still left at the Nephtali headquarters have been going through\nall the material and objects that the characters and other members have gathered.\nThey have discovered that a phial recently recovered from long-lost Mesopotamian\nruins is one of many artifacts that one of the Ancients gathered for unknown reasons\nback in the time of the Second City. The phial contains some sort of Cainite blood\nsample, but when extracted and tested, it aggressively absorbs Blood Traits.\nOne of the more careless researchers had attempted to swig a bit of the blood,\nhoping it would grant him power over the waning of the Curse, but he immediately\nmet Final Death for doing so, leaving behind only a pulp of ashes and blood. No one\nelse has dared to intimately experiment with the vitae since then.\nTHE VEIL OF DARKNESS\nAfter giving the characters just enough time to investigate the mysterious phial\nand ponder what it might mean, they awaken after a day of horrible dreams to find\nthe world in panic — the sun has been blocked by a strange, shadowy object. From\nthat time on, vampires do not suffer from being awake at day. They still lose one\nBlood Trait per every 24 hours, but the sun is not present to force them into their\ndaily sleep. Horror ensues on the streets around the world, as more and more\nvampires abuse the advantages they have over mortals. Governments topple, cities\nbreak down, and infrastructures crumble and die.\nEveryone feels it, mortal and Cainite alike. There is something terrible within\nthe darkness that veils the land.

All day no sound but the\ncrackling fires being maintained by mortal retainers could be heard.\nHere the Antediluvians have come, casting down their would-be appeasers\nwithout pity or remorse while assuming the mantle of power that they once held.\nThey have taken residence in the citadel, as it is still being constructed. They hold\na precious truce with each other, gathering their underlings to them, waiting in\npatience as they build their reign of terror. From here they shall rule for a thousand\nyears, for so it is written in The Book of Nod.\nAnd then Caine shall return to lay down his judgment.\nARMIES OF DARKNESS\nThe Antediluvians have stopped their childer from destroying their younger.\nInstead, they have ordered more vampires to be created, to make their armies larger, to\nbetter rule the world. It should be pointed out that the Antediluvians are all mad, and\nthat they do not consider the consequences of what they are doing. In addition, this is\nnot their world. They see nothing wrong with reshaping it into what will be their reign.\nIn truth, though, one can safely assume that each Antediluvian has its own\nplans of conquest and dominion. Each wishes the others dead so that it can rule\nalone, and to that end, each amasses an army of undead, ostensibly to conquer the\nworld, but also to check the power of and ultimately destroy its siblings. It is into this\nterrible place that the characters must eventually travel, drawn by the power of those\nwhose blood made their own unlife possible so long ago. And they know they will\ncome as criminals, those who would defy the Ancients and seek to undo them, and\nthat they can expect little mercy for their “crimes” against the founders.\nThey also possess two secrets the Antediluvians have not counted on, however,\nwhich could be the undoing of the Ancients — a phial of ancient vitae and Saulot reborn.\nIf none of the characters realize that bringing both of those things might do something\nto even the odds, have Etrius or another prominent Narrator character suggest it.\nLAST RITES\nUpon arrival, the characters and any others who have worked against the\nAntediluvians in the past are led through the streets of the Last City as criminals.\nAll around them swirl groups of other Kindred and Cainites who have sworn to serve\nthe Antediluvians, watching them mostly in silence, with the occasional insult or\nthrown object the only measure of their attention. The characters are thrown into\na cell by themselves.

If something does occur, Saulot can be kept with Jan\nor Etrius and reunited with the characters during the climactic scene.\nStorytellers are encouraged to allow this final “night” in prison to take up most\nif not all of a game session. It can be a powerful time for characters to say their good-\nbyes to each other and take stock of what they have done, as well as test their resolve\nas they watch the horrors going on outside. If Saulot is with them, they might have\nto alternately comfort the child and be comforted by him. He seems curiously calm\nat times, as though he has been expecting this moment for many years. Those who\nhave been kind to him or simply zealous in their efforts to stop the Antediluvians\nreceive an additional benefit at this time, though they might not suspect what it is\nright away. Saulot traces the Hebrew word for “light” on their forehead with dust or\nash, telling them that the inevitable will be painful, but that life will prevail.\nZENITH\nAfter spending many hours in prison, the characters are at last brought to the\ncenter of the city, where the Antediluvians have gathered around a great basalt throne.\nIt is highly recommended that meeting so many beings as powerful as the Antediluvians\nbe as elliptical yet memorable as possible — it is nigh-impossible for even an\nexperienced undead mind to process the experience of directly meeting one of the\nAncients, let alone many of them. Some of the Ancients should be present as little\nmore than raw description, such as a nebulous shadow of Lasombra or a buzzing mental\npresence for Malkav, while those that the characters directly encounter be portrayed\nas Narrator characters as elaborately costumed and prepared as possible.\nThis is it — what the characters say and do here will decide their own fates as well\nas the fate of the world as a whole. It is probably a good idea to set the tone of the scene\nby having at least one of the Narrator characters with them immediately be given a\nbrief “trial” and put to death in gruesome fashion. Doing so underscores the power and\nwickedness the characters are up against, as well as discouraging them from being\nflippant or otherwise foolishly squandering their own unlives when they approach the\nAncients. Once that has been finished, the Antediluvians turn their attention to the\ncharacters and begin questioning them about what they have done, probing them for\ninformation about the modern world, taunting them with the prospect of their\nimminent deaths and otherwise enjoying the power they have recently regained.\nFortunately, there are several things working in the characters’ favor during this\nscene. First, the Ancients don’t really consider them a threat, at least not directly,\nso they are overconfident enough to let them make the first move in a conflict.\nSecond, it might be possible to goad the Ancients into destroying each other by\nplaying on their personal feuds and paranoia, but this shouldn’t be easy. (Even then\nthe characters are still left with at least one Ancient they must deal with along with\nits followers.) Lastly, if the characters have developed their own plan or proposal\nthey believe will save the world, let them try it here and judge its potential for success\nbased on the quality of their planning and their execution of it. (A simple “Get ’em!”\nis a notably poor plan for slaying vampiric demigods from the dawn of time.) If the\nplan is plausible, the players have worked hard on it and the execution is deserving,\nlet them have their victory, even if the cost is high. It’s their chronicle, after all.\nIf the characters have nothing convincing to say or nothing else has worked,\nSaulot will step forward and attempt to confront the Antediluvians about the error of\ntheir ways and the need for them to turn their backs on the course they have chosen.\nStorytellers are encouraged to let the characters do as much as possible before letting\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

While the debate goes\non, Etrius or another learned character leans over and suggests using the phial. Saulot\nsadly agrees with this plan, having hoped the Ancients would see salvation on their\nown, but he tells the characters that this victory will not come cheaply. At least one\nof them must drink the vitae within, and suffer the consequences.\nIf no one volunteers, Saulot will do it, although most characters should definitely\nlose a Humanity Trait for dooming a small child to a painful death. He (or some other)\nstrides forward and drinks the contents of the phial as the Ancients watch, stunned,\nrecognizing too late what the characters have brought with them. Those who drink the\nvitae are immediately wracked with horrible pain and convulsions, but before the\nAncients can do much to react, a shaft of sunlight pierces the sky and illuminates the area,\ncausing pain and fear but not true damage to all present, including the Antediluvians.\nA presence that is at once a deity, a voice and a thunderclap enters the minds of those\nwho drank from the phial, asking if they are willing to atone for the cursed Children of\nCaine. If they respond in the affirmative, events proceed as outlined here. If they respond\nin the negative, they are burned to ash but Saulot’s answer will save the world.\nAssuming Saulot or at least one of the characters accepts the agreement to\natone, the basalt throne explodes in a supernova-like burst of true divine light.\n(Fortitude, including Aegis, offers no protection or reduction for this damage.) As\none, the howling Antediluvians are burned to ash and cinders, as are any vampires\nwithin 100 feet. The characters and any others who received the mark of light from\nSaulot the night before still suffer five levels of aggravated sunlight damage, and will\nhave a scar from the experience for the rest of their unlives. Those who drank from\nthe phial are also incinerated, but it is a gentle dissolution as opposed to an agonizing\nconflagration, and they die with their spirits at peace.\nAssuming the characters survive this final explosion, there is nothing but\nsilence. There is a valley full of vampires not quite sure what happened, but the thrall\nof the Antediluvians is gone. In a few moments, the effects of their severed\nbloodlines start sinking in for the crowd, and the frenzy of diablerie begins again,\nthough the characters remain curiously immune from this madness. In a few hours,\nthe sun rises once more.\nAFTERMATH\nIf the characters escape the chaos, they are free to do whatever they wish. The\nworld lies in ruins, but humanity has a strange way of recovering from such dire straits,\nand it will likely do so again. Vampires have it worse. Caine’s curse is still Withering,\nand at an alarming rate now. Older vampires are dying, and it seems as though most\nhave as little as weeks left before the Curse of Caine weakens so much that their bodies\ncan no longer subsist. The exact time frame depends on the Storyteller’s wishes, but\nthe characters should know what it is (perhaps through Thaumaturgy rituals or Auspex\nscrying). They should have enough time to say their good-byes, put their affairs in order\nand otherwise make peace with the world before the final stages of the reversion claim\nthem. After all, any characters who have survived to this point have more than earned\na chance to die with dignity at the very least.\nAs the curse of vampirism leaves their bodies, Cainites become mortal once\nmore, but those who have lived beyond their natural life span age and die in the\nprocess.

Curiously enough, while dhampirs also lose all\naccess to Disciplines and any powers related to the Blood (regeneration, extended\nlife span, boosting Attributes, etc.), they all gain the Merit: Perceive Vampires, or\nrather individuals that once were vampires. Whether this means they are destined\nto chronicle the fantastic events those beings have seen or just finish the job is a\nmatter best left to the future and the Storyteller’s desires.\nWhat’s more, at the Storyteller’s discretion, vampires who have achieved Golconda,\npossess True Faith or have even just maintained a very high Humanity through all of their\nstruggles might become mortal again. They do so without aging or suffering other ill\neffects at all, as though a higher power is giving them a second chance at the life that was\ninterrupted so long ago.

It’s not the stuff of second chances. Gaia\nwon’t appear at the end of all things and tell everyone it was just a dream. This is the\ntime of legends, the coming of Ragnarok, the Final Days. It is a time of great deeds and\ngreater glory, the culmination of the underlying themes of Laws of the Wild.\nWith the Apocalypse, there is no room for regret. The world changes forever,\nand Earth might not survive. How can players triumph in a doomed world? How can\nthey avoid feeling railroaded in a game ending with certain tragedy? If the fate of\nGaia is sealed, then why should the Garou struggle?\nThe Apocalypse haunts all Laws of the Wild chronicles, but when each individual\nstands at the end of time, he must face his inner doubts. In a good chronicle, characters\nshould never completely lose hope. Survival might not be possible, but even in some\nsmall way, the Garou make a difference.\nTHE WAR TO END ALL WARS\nAn Apocalypse chronicle arguably demands more attention than a chronicle\nwith no fixed ending. Well, like any chronicle, everyone involved receives a greater\nsatisfaction when a story comes to an end. No one likes to read or watch half a story\nand never know the finale. Some people are so interested in the endings of books that\nthey flip straight to the final chapter before starting their novel. Leaving a chronicle\nunfinished leaves everyone unsatisfied.\nRunning a chronicle with a definite plot and an obvious climax helps keep a\nchronicle from losing focus. As the Apocalypse churns to its end, the main plot of\nthe chronicle reaches its conclusion. With the Apocalypse looming or taking place\nin the background, every moment is precious.\nThe Storyteller must realize that each character has her own story. Players crave\nthe opportunity to resolve their character’s issues, to complete that character’s\ndevelopment and story as part of the chronicle.

It can happen before the Garou go off to fight their last battle, as an Ahroun\nfinds inner peace before committing an act of self sacrifice to save his pack. It could\nhappen in the final conflict when a young werewolf overcomes his fear of a Black\nSpiral to face down the beast that grievously wounded him. A character story might\nconclude after the Final Battle, as a Philodox gains a true understanding of the\nsacrifices of generations of Garou on the final day of conflict.\nStrong endings make strong chronicles that will be remembered for years. To\nstart crafting such an ambitious final story for the Apocalypse, a Storyteller must start\nwith the beginning. Although every Apocalypse chronicle will share themes, moods\nand events, each tale of the end will be unique.\nTRIBES AND TOTEMS\nEach Garou tribe has a different view of the world its role within it and the\nApocalypse. When running the Apocalypse, keep in mind what tribes are represented\nin the chronicle. Chances are that the mighty Ahroun Falling-Rock and his pack of\nrowdy Fenrir and Fianna will be ready for a full-scale Ragnarok scenario, but the more\nmystical Walks-in-Spirit and his Uktena brothers are less likely to be interested in such\ntotal carnage. Likewise, Thunder from a Clear Sky might be a fine leader, but if he’s\na Bone Gnawer and your plot centers around impressing Biting-Truth and his\ntraditional Silver Fang pack in a game of political intrigue, you’re in trouble.\nDon’t forget the totems that your characters follow either. Their individual\nBans can have a large impact on the behavior of the characters, which you should\nbear in mind when designing your stories. If the Sept of the Water’s Claw follows\nBear as its totem, they will be interested in cleansing the land as well as fighting the\nWyrm’s minions, since Bear is both a warrior and a healer. Likewise, having a\nchronicle full of mysteries is great if packs follow totems like patient Rattlesnake or\ncrafty Urban Legend. To make sure that everyone is entertained, though, you also\nshould make sure to include some martial scenarios for packs that follow such totems\nas fierce Wyvern or the relentless Wyld Huntsman.\nUltimately, no matter what tribes and totems the players choose for their\ncharacters, the Storyteller should justify that tribe’s beliefs in the chronicle. No\ngroup of werewolves should have everything it believes turn out to be the truth, but\nneither should everything it believes be wrong. Mixing elements of tribal beliefs into\none grand vision of destruction should satisfy both the players and the Storyteller.\nINCORPORATING SIGNS AND OMENS\nPortents and signs have foretold the coming of the end since humans could first\nunderstand them. The Apocalypse is this time of legend, the culmination of\nmillennia. The Apocalypse marks the end of prophecy, the end of history and the\nend of time. There are no visions of the times after the Apocalypse. This event is the\nfinal chapter, a curtain beyond which no fortune-teller can see. Even Gaia cannot\nbe certain of the outcome of the Apocalypse. Although some prophecies call for a\ngolden age, they only speak of it in hints and vague references. And for each one with\na bright hope, another tale ends in chaos and destruction.\nWithout signs of the impending doom, the Garou would not know about the\nApocalypse. Werewolves might unite and struggle against terrible cataclysms, yet\nthe true impact and horror of the events unfolds only as they realize that they live\nin a time of prophecy. As each omen and portent reveals its meaning, the impact of\nthe Apocalypse drives itself home.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Storytellers should consider\nborrowing parts of these prophecies and adapting them to fit their chronicles. Doing\nso saves time and energy, but the choices should have some particular relevance to\nthe chronicle for maximum affect. Writing down quotes from these books or\nphotocopying prophecies for easy reference during a game will make players pay\nmore attention than reading them out of book.\nSeveral other events have occurred in the “official” timeline that are worth\nconsidering. While they might have defined roles in a particular scenario, Storytell-\ners should always feel free to alter these roles as they see fit.\nTHE PROPHECY OF THE PHOENIX\nPhoenix took me.\nCarried me in his claws.\nHigh above the world.\nSo that I could see beyond tomorrow.\nAnd I looked.\nI beheld the future.\nI saw the decimation of our kin. Hunted beyond hunting, death beyond death,\nto the last one. There were no more children, or grandchildren, or fathers, or\nmothers. This was the first Sign Phoenix gave to me, that the Children of the\nWeaver, the Humans, would give to us, the Garou.\nI looked.\nI beheld the future.\nI saw the Children of the Weaver birthing. A great tide of Humans, rising. I saw\nmore and more, until Gaia groaned at having to carry them all. Their houses\noverrunning, their rakes raping, their hands clawing at the parched earth, trying to\nfeed from Her. This was the second Sign of the last days, that Phoenix showed me,\nthat the Humans would do.\nI looked again.\nI beheld the third Sign.\nSo many. So many children. So many Humans. And they fell against each other,\none to one, and the Wyrm brought forth corruption and gave each a measure. And the\nstrange Fire I saw, out of control, the great Plume rising over the wilderness, spreading\ndeath wherever it shone in that dark and cold land. And I heard the agony of the Sea\nas She keened, for some drunken fool poured a lake of black death out upon her.\nI turned my head away in disgust, but I could not help but look again.\nI beheld, then, the fourth Sign.\nThe Wyrm grew powerful; its winds fanned the breezes of decay. It spread its\ndiseases, and they were horrible: the Herd became afflicted with diseases of the head\nand the blood. Children were born twisted. Animals fell sick and no one could cure\nthem. In these final days, even the Warriors of Gaia could not escape the palsied\ntalons of the sickness-bringing deathbird.\nA tear in my eye, I looked again and the Phoenix showed me the fifth Sign.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The air grew hot; even in the darkness\nof Winter it was warm. The plants withered in the sun. A cry of pain and disease arose\nfrom the dying forests; as one the relations cried tears of mourning.\nThen, as though a veil were torn, the sixth Sign showed itself to me.\nIn the last days, Gaia shakes with rage. Fire boils from the depths. Ash shrouds the\nsky. The Wyrm skulks in the shadows made by these… and rears to strike. The old ones\nare gone; the Guardians of the Pathways and the Crossroads are finished. In these final\ndays, the sixth Sign will make itself known in the Packs that form. Each Pack will have\nunto itself a Quest, a Sacred Journey it must perform. Such is the will of Gaia.\nAnd I saw the sky turn black, and the moon was as blood.\nAnd the seventh Sign I glimpsed, though I could not look on it in full. But its\nheat I could feel. The Apocalypse. The final days of the world. The Moon was\nswallowed by the Sun, and it burned in His belly. Unholy fires fell to the ground,\nburning us all, twisting us and making us vomit blood. The Wyrm made itself\nmanifest in the towers and the rivers and the air and the land, and everywhere its\nchildren ran rampant, devouring, destroyed, calling down curses of every kind. And\nthe Herd ran in fear. And the Dark Ones, children of the Wyrm, crawled from the\ncaves and walked the streets in daylight.\nI turned my head from the sight. Phoenix told me: “This is as it shall be, but not\nas it should.” Phoenix left me then.\nNow, I cannot dream. I can only remember the Signs, each one in perfect detail.\nThese are the last days. May Gaia have mercy on us.\nANTHELIOS\nIn late 1999, a new star appeared in the Umbral sky, Anthelios. Although it was\nvisible only to supernatural eyes initially, it has since become visible to mundane\nobservers. Astronomers are unsure as to what its physical aspect is, but those with\nmystical sensitivities are aware of its supernatural presence. It is Anthelios — the\nRed Star, the anti-sun. Although it is not mentioned in the Prophecy of the Phoenix,\nmost of the other major Garou prophecies refer to Anthelios as the “Eye of the\nWyrm” and say that its arrival signals the beginning of the end.\nIn the End Times, various Wyrm cults have taken it into the heart of their beliefs.\nMany servants of these cults — Black Spirals, fomori, etc. — have begun to show certain\n“benefits” for worshipping the Red Star. Some gain new powers or Gifts. The user’s eyes turn\nthe same shade of red as Anthelios as they express these new abilities. Those who are\nparticularly in tune with the Red Star can develop a third eye.\nTHE PERFECT METIS\nThe significance of the birth of the Perfect Metis was largely lost on the Garou.\nSome considered him a harbinger of doom, while others thought he was destined to\nbe Gaia’s champion. (Some even saw it as a triumph of the Weaver, making orderly\nperfection out of what should be flawed.) Ironically, these schools of thought are\npotentially closer to the truth than they might imagine.\nThe uproar caused by the birth of a perfect metis cub to two metis parents brought\nthe Garou Nation to the brink of civil war. It also resulted in some very odd meetings,\nas a number of agents of the Wyrm wanted nothing more than to make sure that the\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

It was resolved, of course,\nbut agents of the Wyrm (the real Wyrm) kidnapped the child shortly thereafter and\nspirited him away, safeguarding him for use as the Wyrm’s voice in the physical realm.\nSoon, very soon now, the child will return, and his coming will herald a new age.\nWRITING ON THE WALL\nGoing beyond published material helps tailor the events of the Apocalypse to\nyour own chronicle. When creating the prophecies and visions that directly detail\nthe End Times in your chronicle, mind the following rules.\nFirst, write down the symbol, prophecy or sign and all the details about it.\nSecond, keep the meaning of any foretelling vague. By keeping the true meaning\nunclear, a Storyteller can adapt the prophecy to fit the events of a chronicle. Third,\nlet the characters discover the true meanings of prophecies on their own, and listen\ncarefully to their interpretations. Perception is reality. If they believe something,\nthen it’s real to them. They might even come up with an interpretation of a cryptic\nstatement that fits better into the Storyteller’s plots than the Storyteller’s version.\nFinally, don’t let the players utterly miss prophecies. If something happens to\ncause a prophecy to come true, and the players all miss it, but don’t be afraid to\nreveal what happened. Spirits or ancient Theurges will have the mystic awareness\nto realize the significance of what has happened. The Enigmas Ability and Ancestor\nBackground make good tools for revelation as well. If a Storyteller doesn’t\neventually reveal that a prophecy has come true, then the importance of the\nprophecy is lost, because the players never become aware of it. Even worse, they\ncould spend their time chasing down red herrings, looking for a prophecy to come\ntrue that already has.\nHEAVEN HOLDS THE ANSWERS\nMany events in this chapter deal with fallout from the “canonical” events\ndescribed in the tabletop book Rage Across the Heavens. Therein one can find\ndetailed passages concerning the significance of Anthelios, the birth of the Perfect\nMetis and the reasons for Rorg’s decision to “cleanse” Gaia. While it is not\nnecessary to own that book to play a proper Apocalypse scenario, Storytellers\nmight find it helpful and full of additional information that can help add nuance\nand background to their chronicles.\nTHE LEGEND SAYS WE LOSE\nWhen making prophecies, the Storyteller must decide when the future is\nnot set in stone. Sometimes, characters place themselves directly against a\nprophecy in an attempt to change the course of the Apocalypse. One of the best\nways to handle this problem would be to change the prophecy by adding to it.\nA time might come, however, when the Storyteller wants the characters\nto defy a prophecy. Such a deed should come toward the latter stages of a\nchronicle, lest the characters threaten to defy all omens and prophecies. Once\nthe characters are successful, they should have a sense of empowerment, and\nother Garou might seek them out hoping to receive their aid. Disproving a\nprophecy should be a major event during the Apocalypse.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

In order to avoid the climatic scene of the chronicle degrading into\nslow-moving Rock-Paper-Scissors contest, a Storyteller needs to have some plans.\nThe Storyteller must determine which fights need tests and which ones do not.\nIf an avatar of the Wyrm attacks an avatar of Gaia in the Umbra, the Storyteller should\ndescribe the battle and the outcome. A duel between two entities of such tremendous\npower goes far beyond anything the combat system can handle. The importance of the\nresult should be part of the plot, not a randomly determined event. Only the part of\nthe fight that directly involves the characters requires any tests. This keeps the battle\nmoving, rather than having players sit and wait for results. It also frees the Storyteller\nto concentrate on cinematic descriptions and dialogue rather than worrying about the\nrules for potent Charms and Rank-Five Gifts in the background.\nThe most important part of the climax is the role of the characters. The Storyteller\nmust strive to make sure that each character contributes to the outcome. Few players\nwill be happy if they feel useless in the Final Battle. This is an important dramatic\nevent, in some respects, the conclusion of a game system as well as a chronicle. The\nStoryteller wants everyone to have fond memories, even if their characters die in the\nend. Finally, this is the time for heroic deaths. For many Garou, nothing could be better\nthan dying in battle. Again, the character should contribute, but the Storyteller should\nhave no compunctions about having werewolves die in the final scene.\nAFTERMATH\nSo, if the group wants a post-holocaust chronicle, what should it look like?\nWhat is the aftermath of the Apocalypse? What has survived? Here are a few\npossibilities — presuming there’s anything left, of course.\nDEAD WORLD\nThe Apocalypse all but destroys Earth. Gaia still exists, though, and a few of her\nspirits gather around her in an attempt to ease her pain. A few caerns still sustain life.\nCivilization no longer exists, and the remnants of humanity live in tribal groups\nscavenging the ruins. Volcanoes send ash into the heavens. The ground quakes with\nburning rivers of magma, while frozen winds herald the coming of great sheets of ice.\nThe Umbra still holds spiritual power, but much of it has fallen asunder, filled with\nthe death cries of the world. Toxins in the environment deform all new Garou as if\nthey were metis cubs. Werewolves could be on the verge of extinction.\nThis future holds little hope, though perhaps something could save the Earth\nout in the Deep Umbra. Technology and the Weaver might hold the answer, or\nperhaps the Wyld can create life out of desolation. It might even be possible that a\nnew Wyrm, freed of its pre-Apocalypse torment could guide the sept to save Gaia.\nSPIRITUAL UTOPIA\nThe Gauntlet is no more. Once again, the physical and the spiritual are one. It is\na time of spiritual awakening and transformations of life across the globe. Out of the ruin\nof the last age, a dawn time has come, where spiritual gifts flow freely among all living\nthings. Humans have reconnected with Gaia, and they understand their place in the\nworld. Dark powers still exist, but they are on the run, desperately trying to find some way\nto turn the tides and use the new spiritual nature of humans as a way to corrupt them.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

They would have to stop humans and animals who don’t have the\nwill to control their new powers. Werewolves would ferret out the remaining dark\nspirits who plot against Gaia. In many ways, this starts a new golden age for everyone\n— a return to Eden.\nEVOLUTION\nThe world has changed. New life forms emerge from the ruins of the old world.\nStrange spirits take hold across the land. Humanity stands divided between allegiances\nto the Wyld, where some of them now possess spiritual magics, and the Weaver, which\nhas armed its followers with advanced machinery. The Garou must try to sort out the\ngood from the bad and find their place in a world that is no longer their own.\nIn this science fantasy aftermath, werewolves can take any role. Perhaps the tribes\nno longer exist. This world poses the question of identity of the Garou. They must decide\nwho and what they are and how they will find a place in this world.\nWEAPONS FOR THE WORLD’S END\nAlthough the focus of an Apocalypse chronicle should always be the characters\nand the stories built around them, certain systems and mechanics have been devised\nspecifically for the End Times. Storytellers should feel free to use, alter or ignore\nthese mechanics as they see fit for their chronicle.\nTHE RAGE OF GAIA\nThe Apocalypse is a desperate time. While the Garou might not entirely\nunderstand what it is they are feeling, they can sense its approach as Gaia’s pain\nbecomes their pain. During the final five lunar months, the difficulty of all Rage\nChallenges decreases by one. Additionally, whenever he is in an extremely stressful\nsituation, a Garou must retest any Frenzy Challenge in which Willpower succeeds,\nmaking it even more likely that frenzy will occur.\nIf events in the scenario result in the destruction of Luna and/or the severing\nof important totem ties, Rage fluctuates even more. Luna’s destruction immediately\nforces all changers to make a Rage Challenge against three Traits. Those who\nsucceed immediately enter frenzy for the rest of the scene, while those who fail lose\nall Rage instead as their will to fight is sapped. (Rage is regained normally.) Losing\na totem incurs the same problems for members of its family.\nNEW GIFTS\nAs the Apocalypse draws ever closer, a number of powerful, long-lost Gifts are\nmade available to those Garou with the means to learn them. Storytellers are\nencouraged to use the following Gifts as examples to build their own legendary End-\nTimes Gifts. Unless otherwise noted, consider these Gifts to be in-tribe Gifts for the\npurpose of Experience costs. Any character of sufficient rank can learn these Gifts,\nas they are awarded to the Garou Nation as a whole, not one particular breed or tribe.\nGift of the Giants (Advanced)\nA Gift lost to the Garou since the end of the First Times, now it can be learned only\nthrough the Mokolé. By spending a Gnosis Trait, the character physically grows, gaining\nall the benefits of her increased muscle mass as a result. This Gift grants the character the\nbonus Physical Traits: Brawny x2 and Brutal, as well as a free retest in any Physical\nChallenge for the duration of one hour or one scene. These effects are cumulative with\nother similar Gifts, such as the Advanced Fianna Gift: Gift of the Spriggan.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "68\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nMyth Walking (Advanced)\nThrough the use of this Gift, a Garou is able to draw upon the powers of the\ngreatest heroes of her tribe to aid her in the last battle of the Apocalypse. It does more\nthan simply grant the Garou a few extra Traits or access to a few Gifts. Rather, the\nhero called upon will physically manifest within the Gift-user, if he is pleased with\nthe Garou’s prayer for aid, causing her to transform and take the hero’s form. For all\nintents and purposes, the Garou has become this hero until the end of scene. The\nStoryteller should devise the specific capabilities of the hero in question. Most\nheroes of Garou history are quite powerful indeed, but their knowledge of current\ntrends and technologies would be equally limited in most cases. (No ancient Fianna\nwarrior knows anything about computers, for example.) It costs two Gnosis Traits\nto activate this Gift, it lasts one scene, and it may be activated only once in a Garou’s\nlifetime. A Garou learns Myth Walking from an ancestor-spirit or from a Mokolé.\nNEW FETISHES\nFlaming Death Spears\nLevel 3, Gnosis 6\nNamed after the Death Spears of the Prophecy of the Phoenix, these powerful\nweapons are created and used by servants of all three members of the trait. They are\nmost often forged from moonsilver, capped with the obsidian found from the\neruptions of the Jaws of the True Father, or polished from Wyldstones.\nWhen used in combat, these spears deal two levels of aggravated damage to the\nenemies of the maker. For instance, a Wyrm-spear would deal such damage when\nused against servants of the Weaver or the Wyld. Against anything else, the spears\ndeal two levels of lethal damage. These weapons may also be used in the Rite: Flaming\nDeath Spears.\nWolf Skin\nLevel 1, Gnosis 4\nWithout the existence of Wolf Skin fetishes, keeping an entire tribe’s fall to the\nWyrm a secret from the rest of the Nation would be nigh impossible. Upon the tribe’s\nfall, however, the Wyrm grants one of these fetishes to each of the fallen, which will\nprotect them from being detected by such Gifts as Sense Wyrm. They operate in much\nthe same manner as a Bane Skin fetish (see Laws of the Wild).\nThe fetishes are made from a small piece of dried wolf flesh (about an ounce) wrapped\nin silver wire and worn close to the flesh. They are temporary, lasting several months at the\nmost before crumbling to dust. While worn, regardless of how much taint an individual\naccumulates, she will remain immune to detection from the Gift: Sense Wyrm.\nDespite the silver used in its crafting the fetish doesn’t deal damage or siphon\noff Gnosis Traits when worn by Garou.\nNEW TALENS\nLuna-Dust\nGnosis 1\nThis useful talen is found only where pieces of Luna have fallen after the\nShattering. It appears as a gray dust with a gunpowder smell and the ability to cling to\nitself and earthly things. Anyone who finds some Luna-Dust may spread it on himself\nor a small area. If he spreads the dust over a small area, the Gauntlet rating for that area\neffectively becomes 1. If he spreads the dust on a person, then the Gauntlet for that\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Heavy rain washes away the Luna-Dust, thereby ending its effects, as does\nbathing or showering. Otherwise, there is no duration on the dust’s effects.\nClaw of Rorg\nGnosis 6\nPowerful Wyld-talens, Rorg’s claws are the remnants of the asteroid Geographos\nthat he threw at Gaia with the intent of killing the Wyrm before it could eat the\nworld. It was an ill-conceived plan, and only Luna’s sacrifice prevents all life on Gaia\nfrom ending, but the claws remember their original purpose. Each claw seeks to crush\nthe Wyrm in all its forms. When shot or thrown, they accelerate toward the nearest\nWyrm target, regardless of where the thrower was actually aiming.\nThese claws target the Wyrm-creature closest to the point of release, regardless\nof the wishes of the thrower, as long as the target is within line of sight. The thrower\nmust defeat the target in a Physical Challenge (retest with Athletics). If successful,\nthe Claw deals one health level of lethal damage for each five paces it traveled, up\nto a maximum of five levels of lethal damage.\nNEW RITES\nFlaming Death Spears (Intermediate)\nThis rite is nothing short of spectacular in its effects. It is capable of taking any\nranged weapon and, with the aid of a Gaffling of Phoenix, turning it into a weapon\nof terrible destructive power.\nA weapon that has had this rite performed on it is thrown or fired while the Garou\nshouts a word of power. A Physical Challenge ensues as normal to determine whether\nit hits its first target, which deals normal damage. The weapon continues on its straight\npath, however, enabling it to hit any number of other targets — effectively, the weapon\nreceives an infinite range. Additionally, for every five paces the weapon travels, the\ndamage it deals increases by one health level, up to a maximum of five levels of damage.\nThe weapon simply gets more and more powerful as it continues on its path. While\nthese projectiles might not be the Death Spears of prophecy, the rite is impressive\nenough that it is highly sought after during the final battles.\nRite of the Burning Bridge (Intermediate)\nThis ancient rite, designed to permanently sever the moon bridge connecting\ntwo caerns, has rarely seen use in recent years. In fact, the last time it was actually\nused was when the Croatan, Uktena and Wendigo used it to sever connections\nopened by the “Wyrmcomer” tribes into the Pure Lands. Some very extreme\ncircumstances appear during the Apocalypse, however, which might cause some\nGarou to consider such drastic action.\nThis rite cannot be performed alone. It requires three other Garou, and each\nparticipant stands at one of the cardinal directions as the ritual is performed, surrounding\nthe heart of the caern proper. The participants speak the Gaian name of the caern at the\nother end of the moon bridge to be destroyed. Then the participants invoke Luna and offer\nher serious chiminage as compensation for the bridge they are asking her to allow to be\ndestroyed. Players and narrators are encouraged to be creative in determining the\nappropriate chiminage, but as an example, an offering of 10 pounds of silver per participant\nmight do the trick. Finally, a ritual chant to Helios burns the bridge away forever.\nThe entire ritual requires an hour to perform, and should any step be missed for\nany reason, the rite fails. If the rite is successful, the moon bridge is destroyed and\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

It can theoretically be rebuilt, however, as long as Garou in\nboth caerns cooperate and at least a month has passed since its destruction.\nWEAVER ASCENDANT\nConventional Garou wisdom holds that the Wyrm will be the architect of the\nApocalypse. As Garou Theurges scrutinize the Prophecy of the Phoenix, looking for\nanswers within its cryptic passages, they watch as the Wyrm’s maleficent soul spreads\nthroughout the world, defiling everything it touches. It is only a matter of time, they\nsay, before the Garou face their final battle in the war to save the soul of Gaia.\nBlinded by the Wyrm’s obvious evil, few imagine the true threat would reveal\nitself to be the Weaver. But that is about to change.\n“Weaver Ascendant” concerns itself with the events that follow the true\nglobalization of the Weaver’s power within the human sphere. It begins with the rise\nof Shinzui Industries, a Japanese corporation with goals and aspirations that reach far\nbeyond its station. It chronicles the gradual decay of the Wyrm’s stranglehold over\nWestern society and the effects of its collapse on the Garou and all they hold dear.\nINITIALIZE END-TIME ROUTINE\nMeticulous as always, the Weaver’s assault does not begin spontaneously.\nIndeed, the threads of the Weaver’s rise have been coming together for some time,\nthough only too late will the Garou be able to see the entire design for what it really\nis. The Perfect Metis may emerge as a champion of the Weaver, the perfect synthesis\nof the new order, while Anthelios may be explained as the eye of the Machine\nwatching over its creation.\nTHE RISE OF THE MACHINE\nWith the initialization of the computer age, which has made global connectiv-\nity possible, the strength and power of the Weaver has grown like never before.\nWhen or how the Machine gained sentience remains a mystery. Perhaps it was\nsomehow tied to the nuclear detonations in Bangladesh a few years ago. Perhaps it\nwas due to the existence of a certain critical mass of technological artifacts in the\nphysical realm. Or perhaps it was simply time.\nRegardless, the Machine gained awareness and quickly subverted the Weaver in the\nprocess. Where once the Weaver’s influence was subtle and adaptable, now it became\nharsh and unyielding. The Wyrm had been allowed to corrupt the Pattern Web for far\ntoo long, and the Machine was intent on expunging his taint once and for all.\nHostile Takeovers\nThe one thing standing between the Weaver/Machine and its goals was the\nephemeral nature of the Wyrm’s influence. As it turns out, the nascent megacorporation\nShinzui provided the answers the Machine was seeking. Already thralls to the will of\nthe Weaver, Shinzui’s board of directors was expanding the corporation’s influence\nthroughout the Far East and the Pacific Rim. Several of these branch offices found that\ntheir sphere of influence happened to overlap with that of another multinational\nmegacorporation, this one with its roots in America instead of Asia: Pentex. First in\nTokyo, then in Bangkok, Los Angeles and a number of other cities, Shinzui corporate\nofficers found their paths crossing with those of Pentex employees.\nThe Awakened elite of Shinzui began to notice a pattern of corruption within\nthe Pentex hierarchy, and from there it was only a matter of time before the Machine\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The Urge Wyrms exist to spread corruption\nand power however they can, and what better way to make their needs manifest on\na large scale than through the aegis of a powerful, supposedly legitimate corporation?\nTHE WEAVER’S FORCES\nSPIRITS\nIn the months preceding the events described in “Weaver Ascendant,” Weaver\nspirits have undergone a slow but inexorable shift in behavior. They are more active\nthan they’ve been in the past, and they are becoming more aggressive toward non-\nWeaver entities. In game terms, increase difficulties for all tests involving interaction\nwith Weaver spirits by two. This applies to Social Challenges as well as activation\ntests for Gifts and fetishes.\nSHINZUI’S DRONES\nThe Weaver’s Drone assault teams consist of elite Drones who have significant\nexperience interacting with supernatural entities of various sorts. The standard\nformat for a team is six Drones: four soldiers, one reassurance (memory alteration and\nphysical repair powers), and one bricklayer (temporary Gauntlet-raising powers).\nThe teams operate in fairly straightforward fashion. The soldiers secure an area using\nhighly coordinated teamwork, the bricklayer makes sure that the targets do not\nescape, and the reassurance covers the team’s tracks once the wetwork is completed.\nAll members of the team act in perfect synchronicity, and their level of coordination\nis such that it puts that of most Garou packs to shame.\nAlthough Drones can be treated largely like fomori with Weaver-oriented powers,\nmore information can be found in Book of the Weaver or Possessed: A Players Guide.\nTHE PURGE\nShinzui’s efforts to contain the Garou threat are as straightforward as they are brutal.\nAny Garou who can be shown the beauty of the Onesong, and who undergo the process\nof Clarification, will be spared. All others will be annihilated. Shinzui’s strikes against the\nGarou are carried out by small teams of well-equipped Drones, all slaves to the will of the\nMachine. These beings operate with frightening efficiency, striking without warning and\nwasting no time on idle chatter or senseless egotism. Their goal is to wipe their quarry off\nof the face of the Earth, and they extremely good at what they do.\nSHINZUI AND YOU\nShinzui’s conquest of Pentex is more than just back story. It’s also a way\nto directly link characters to the imminent Apocalypse. If any of your\ncharacters has made it his life’s goal to monkeywrench Pentex, he might come\nin contact with Shinzui in any number of ways. Corporate accounts at all levels\nwill display some unusual activity, and it mystifies the suits at Pentex as much\nas anyone. Computer sabotage might wind up being redundant, as other\ncharacters discover that someone else got to their targets before they did. But\nwho? And, more importantly, why? And when the characters hit a particular\nsite, they might find that something else has followed them back home…\nsomething decidedly unfriendly. It doesn’t matter if their efforts are physical,\ndigital or spiritual, they will cross paths with Shinzui eventually.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Indeed, it has only begun. In like fashion,\nShinzui begins to eliminate the septs of the Beast Courts of the Emerald Mother,\nusing the information gleaned from its Hakken directors to dissect the hengeyokai\npiece by piece. The attacks are so swift and savage that the various sentai have no\nchance to react, and it is only a matter of time before they are forced to yield.\nWith the shapeshifters of the East pacified, Shinzui now turns its sights on the\nlands to the West. It approaches the problem from a number of angles. Branches of\nboth Endron International and Consolidex Worldwide — now firmly under Shinzui’s\ncontrol — have reported terrorist activity with an environmental motivation in\nNorthern Europe. Data provided by the few survivors of the Boli Zouhisze Garou\n(mostly through the use of Project: Odyssey fomori) also points to this region, which\nin turn leads Shinzui to the doorsteps of the Glass Walkers.\nThe Walkers are taken completely by surprise. They have never before dealt\nwith a foe that is at once so regimented and so brutal. Shinzui’s operatives use the\ntools of the Machine as well as the Walkers ever did, and they are primed to kill in\na way heretofore seen only in Wyrm-spawn. It is the city walkers’ greatest nightmare\nmade manifest, and their annihilation in Europe is nigh total.\nWhile the Garou are cut to pieces in Europe, things are different in America.\nThe touch of Pentex is strong here, even if the capital behind it is long since gone.\nAdditionally, the cities in America are both many and large, which has made\ntracking the Garou extremely difficult. The remnants of the tribes that were cut\ndown in Europe lay in hiding, while the tribes who have made America their\nhomeland do their best to help their fellows avoid Shinzui’s grasp.\nSPIRIT MATTERS\nAs the Weaver’s assault teams methodically go about their business of extermi-\nnating the Garou, the werewolves find themselves faced with another problem:\nstepping into the Umbra isn’t as easy as it used to be. In game terms, the Gauntlet\nrating everywhere increases by one. It will continue to do so at the rate of one Trait\nper week. Within six weeks, the boundary between the worlds of spirit and flesh will\nbe impassable, and every supernatural being on the planet will lose the abilities that\ndifferentiate them from normal humans.\nThe loss of the spirit world will have devastating consequences for the Garou,\nbut the implications go far beyond that. Every living thing on the planet has a\nconnection of some sort to the spirit world, and without that connection, they will\nlose their will to live. The loss of spirit will lead to the loss of creativity and\nindividuality, and eventually the world and everything on it that is not directly\nconnected to the Weaver will become nothing more than a lifeless shell.\nTHE GREAT CONCOLATION\nAs the Weaver’s forces crack down on the supernatural elements in the world, the\nneed for a concolation among the Garou becomes paramount. Unfortunately, organizing\nsuch a meeting will be a feat in itself. The calcification of the Umbra is making travel via\nmoon bridge exceedingly risky. In fact, only the most powerful caerns can safely be used\nin such a fashion, and many of those have been conquered by Shinzui’s Drones.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Reaching the place should be an adventure in and of itself,\nas the Garou have to outpace Shinzui Drones and other agents of the Weaver\ngunning for their hides. The location should have strong ties to the Umbra and be\nextremely isolated. Anything else is too risky.\nAssessing the Damage\nThe impact of Shinzui’s attacks on the Garou Nation has been staggering.\nNever before have the Garou fought such an organized and implacable foe, and as\nthe Concolation gets underway, they are astonished at just how hard the Weaver has\nhit them. All told, fully 80 percent of the world’s Garou have been killed or\nincapacitated, leaving only a few hundred for the final battles against the Weaver’s\nforces. No one’s sure how to react to this news. Everyone knew they’d been hit hard,\nbut to learn that the strikes had occurred all over the world and that the werewolves’\nstrength had been reduced on a planetary scale is simply mind-blowing. There is no\nmore time for politics. The Garou are desperate, and they have to act now.\nStorytellers and Narrators should work hard on presenting the Concolation as\nvividly as possibly. While you are unlikely to have sufficient numbers to represent\nall the Garou in attendance, be ready to portray a number of famous and influential\nmembers of the Nation. It is also highly recommended that suitable music, lighting\nand other setting preparations be used to create the moot atmosphere. Lastly, while\nthe elders of the Nation will be there, don’t rule out the possibility of letting your\ncharacters be the ones to gather the key bits of information and put together a great\ndeal of the plan that the Garou ultimately embrace. Simply look forward to the plan\noutlined in this scenario (or the one you see as being adopted in your own chronicle),\nand give them information that will lead them to propose just such a strategy as will\nbe required to succeed in your particular vision of the end.\nObviously, this approach requires a good deal of lead time, by placing informa-\ntion for them to find in stories that begin well before you start running “Weaver\nAscendant.” It also diminishes the importance of the Perfect Metis, though he can\nstill be a source of information for the phase of the plan that involves freeing the\nWyrm in Malfeas, since the characters are unlikely to know much about that\nterritory. While it might require a great deal of work, this approach gets the players\ninvolved like no other and lets them feel as if they’ve truly earned their place at the\nhead of the Garou vanguard.\nUnwanted Guests\nAs the Garou plan their next move, their deliberations are interrupted by a most\nunexpected group of guests, namely the remnants of the Black Spiral Dancers. How\nthey knew of the Garou’s Concolation, to say nothing of how they managed to find\nit, is unclear. What is clear, however, is that the Dancers are in a conciliatory mood\nand aren’t really looking for a fight. If the Garou let them say their piece, they’ll\nindicate that they’ve been hit by the Weaver even harder than the Gaian Garou\nhave, and that they’re willing to help the Gaians any way they can as long as it\nundermines the Weaver’s efforts. This offer presents an interesting moral dilemma\nfor the players. The Gaians are desperately short on manpower, but are they willing\nto work with the very embodiment of everything they’ve been fighting up until now,\neven during the final battles of the Apocalypse?\nEven more surprising than the initial arrival of the Black Spiral Dancers, however,\nis the return of the Perfect Metis, thought lost since he was kidnapped years before.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The Perfect Metis has more\nto offer to the Garou Nation than simple aid — he has information as well. He also says\nthat a critical opportunity is close at hand, and that the Gaians and Spirals might in fact\nbe able to defeat the Weaver’s aims once and for all if they are all able to work in concert.\nTHE WEAVER OVERSTEPS\nWhether the players or the Perfect Metis proposes it, a plan emerges at last.\nFirst, the Garou will launch a massive counterattack against the forces of the\nWeaver, doing all they can to loosen her hold on the physical realm. Then they must\nmake their way to the Umbra — still accessible in places like Australia, the Amazon\nand parts of Africa — and travel to Malfeas itself.\nOnce there, they will perform a ritual of great power, offering up their own lives\nto give the Wyrm the power he needs to break free of the Pattern Web. If the ritual\nworks, the worlds of spirit and flesh will be dissolved as the Wyrm breaks free and\nreturns to his normal self. The power of the Machine will be crushed, and the Weaver\nwill be given the opportunity to regain her sanity. The cycle will begin anew,\nrejuvenated by the Garou’s sacrifice and overseen by a wiser, more cautious Triat.\nSTRIKING BACK\nThe methods the Garou take to loosen the Weaver’s grip vary considerably\ndepending on the region of the world and the other supernatural beings the Garou\ncan call upon for aid. The characters might formulate or stumble across any of the\nfollowing plot possibilities, and the Storyteller is encouraged to either choose one\nof the following or use them as inspiration for something else entirely.\nOPERATION: FULL DISCLOSURE\nWhile the other Garou tribes begin to attack the Weaver in their own ways, the\nGlass Walkers announce the beginnings of Operation: Full Disclosure in a particu-\nlarly dramatic way. In short, they access and gain control over every broadcast system\non the planet, be it television, radio or even cellular phone networks, and they use\nthis control to put their enemies under a microscope. They tell the world that all is\nnot as it seems, and that a lot of people have been manipulating the public for a very\nlong time. Everyone’s a target — including vampires, Pentex executives, the\nscientists at DNA, Shinzui’s obviously illegal activities and anything else the sept\ncan think of. It doesn’t stop with the broadcast either. Pack members send email\nmessages to those with something to gain from an enemy’s downfall, and they make\nphone calls asking people if they knew about their bosses’ skeletons in the closet.\nThe players can involve themselves in this scenario in a number of ways. First, they\ncan lead vigilante posses to investigate the targets of the operation, fomenting chaos\nwherever they go in an effort to break the Weaver’s control over the masses. Doing so will\nbe difficult, since the masses are predisposed to obey the dictates of those in control, but it\nshould be quite possible, especially with the right Gifts. The characters can also act as\nbodyguards for the packs who are more directly involved, since Drones in service of the\nWeaver (not to mention anyone “outed” by the broadcast) will be gunning for their heads.\nSABOTAGE, INDUSTRIAL AND OTHERWISE\nWith the commencement of Operation: Full Disclosure and the call for war\nagainst the Weaver, the cities of the world have become a saboteur’s paradise.

They can, however, make guerrilla raids against\nWeaver facilities, lashing out with plastic explosives and industrial sabotage where\nmore traditional methods of battle are inappropriate.\nStorytellers who choose to go this route should present their players with a\nnumber of tempting targets, providing floor plans and timetables as needed so that\nthe characters can plan their strikes accordingly. Don’t worry too much about\nweaponry and gear. This is, after all, the end of the world, so let the characters go out\nwith a bang if they really want to. Acquiring equipment should be easy, given the\nantics of the Random Interrupts lately. Players and Storytellers alike are encouraged\nto let their imaginations run wild and play the scenario to the hilt. And hey, if the\ncharacters live, they can even proceed to the next phase of the story. Even if they\ndon’t, though, this is as good a way to go as any. Cracking the shell of the Weaver\nin the physical realm counts for a lot, and it will give other Garou packs the\nopportunity they need to shatter the Pattern Web in the Umbra.\nALL HAIL DISCORDIA!\nSome Garou take the impending Apocalypse as an opportunity for all-out war and\nsabotage, while others embrace the wonders of technology to cut the Weaver’s many legs\nout from under her. That’s fine and all, but for some Garou, the name of the game is pure,\nunadulterated chaos, and they should have their day in the sun as much as anyone else.\nThis scenario is best chosen by packs with particularly charismatic members, the\nsorts of people who are good at getting people fired up and starting serious trouble.\nCharacters with extensive networks of allies, contacts or kinfolk are also well suited to\nstart up such grass-roots revolutions, and this option might be good for packs that have\ninvested heavily in mortal society for just this reason. High-ranking Bone Gnawers or\nRatkin are also ideal, as they have the Gifts they need to really stir things up. In any event,\nthe point of the endeavor is to create absolute pandemonium over as large a territory as\npossible, turning the unwashed masses against the minions of law and order and using the\nensuing chaos to take out selected targets within the Weaver’s hierarchy.\nTERROR, INC.\nWhile the remnants of the Glass Walkers make their move to co-opt the\ncomputer networks of the world, the Black Spiral Dancers take a more direct route\ntoward shattering the Weaver’s control of reality — they work to sow terror so that\npanic will bloom. Owing to the fact that he is, in fact, a possessed Garou, the Perfect\nMetis has some supernatural powers above and beyond those normally granted to the\nWyrm’s werewolves. One of them is a greatly enhanced form of the Delirium, one that\nworks even on Awakened beings. This is a perfect way to subvert the Weaver’s control\nof her Drones, since even the strongest of them is no match for the raw, animalistic\nhorror the Perfect Metis can instill within them. As the metis and his followers strike,\nrending the Veil with abandon, the earthly minions of the Weaver are torn to pieces.\nMany players might balk at the idea of letting the Black Spiral Dancers run rampant\nwithin their cities, and with good reason. These are creatures of Rage who have been utterly\nconsumed by darkness, and they make the worst of humanity look… well, not benign, but\na whole lot less extreme. But players have to remember that these are the End Times. The\nkey to the Spirals’ motivation now is pure, unadulterated destruction, and in that they serve\nthe original intent of the Balance Wyrm. They are no less corrupt than they have ever been,\nbut at least now they’re striking openly instead of skulking in shadows.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Before they can fight that final battle, however, they have to actually\nreach the Umbra — no small matter given the nature of the times.\nREACHING THE UMBRA\nIn kinder times, the Garou could simply step sideways to enter the Umbra. In\nmost of the world, however, that is no longer possible. The wall between worlds has\nbecome completely calcified, resulting in a Gauntlet rated well over 10 for most of\nthe world. There are, however, a number of alternatives to merely stepping sideways,\nsuch as consulting the Mokolé or the Nuwisha, “swimming sideways” with the\nRokea, et cetera. Storytellers should feel free to make the players work hard to figure\nout how to circumvent the formidable barrier of the Gauntlet in these desperate\ntimes, but ultimately the final challenge is not in the physical realm, but Malfeas.\nTHE MAW OF THE WYRM\nOne way or another, the Garou have reached Malfeas, the lair of the Wyrm.\nNow the trouble really begins. How the characters’ reception in Malfeas unfolds is\nleft to the Storyteller to determine, as it largely depends on how the characters came\nto be in the place, who brought them (if anyone) and what they encountered along\nthe way. Although much has happened already, the Storyteller should see to it that\nthis harrowing journey is every bit as terrifying and difficult as what has come before.\nThis is the final hope of the Garou, and no punches can be pulled by either side.\nRegardless of the circumstances surrounding their arrival, however, the characters\nmust face a number of challenges as they proceed through Malfeas. First of all, the Wyrm\nis at war with itself. Even if they arrive with the Perfect Metis and the Dancers, they are\nsubject to the same hostility as any other group — if not more so. Banes, disloyal Dancers\nand all manner of other creatures fall on them in great waves, forcing the characters to\nstay alert every second or face destruction. Second, the terrain changes constantly,\nmaking it easy for groups to become separated (good fuel for a frightening session) and\ndifficult for the Garou to establish a place to begin the great ritual. Lastly, the minions\nof the Weaver attempt a last-minute invasion as the ritual progresses, in a desperate\nattempt to control the Wyrm forever. As a result, the characters will face not only rogue\nWyrm manifestations but the Weaver’s forces as well.\nROUSING THE WYRM\nOnce the Garou have managed to secure a foothold in Malfeas, all that remain\nare the rituals needed to restore the Wyrm’s vitality. Garou have never attempted\nanything of this magnitude, and the ritemasters involved know the cost will be\nterrible even if they succeed. If the Garou perform the rite themselves, they’re in for\na hard time. Every living Garou that remains participates in the rite, and a Rank-Five\nTheurge from each tribe must help to lead it.\nAlthough the Storyteller may adjust any of the figures for the rite as needed for\nher chronicle (lower totals for games with fewer remaining Garou, higher totals for\nthose with more), performing the rite as written requires a Mental Challenge (retest\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Only one test can be\nattempted per hour of the ritual. Once the leaders of the rite reach the required\nnumber of tests, all of the Garou participants — that is, all of the Garou remaining\n— must contribute permanent Gnosis Traits.\nFive thousand Gnosis Traits are required for the rite to succeed. If the total is\nnot met, the participants begin to suffer aggravated wounds, with each wound\ncounting as three more Gnosis Traits toward the total. These wounds cannot be\nhealed in any way, including Gifts, until the rite has been completed or totally\nabandoned. At this point, Storytellers should increase the drama as much as possible,\nmaking those actively involved in performing the rite feel the strain of channeling\nsuch great energies while those guarding the ritemasters endure wave after wave of\nattackers desperate to halt the ritual before it is completed.\nIt is also important to make sure that even if a character is doomed to die as a result\nof the ritual draining his life away, he has a chance to get some good last words in or\ntake a final parting shot at his enemies. Nothing is more anti-climactic than telling the\nplayers, “Oh, by the way, the rite sucks out seven Gnosis and all your health levels, so\nyou die instantly,” without giving them some chance to nobly face their sacrifice.\nTO HELL AND BACK\nAssuming the rite is successful and any of the characters survive, there is still the\nquestion of what has happened now that the supernatural has been revealed. It is possible\nfor the Storyteller to rule that as part of its return, the Wyrm of Balance removes most\nof the knowledge of the supernatural from humanity as a means of promoting healing.\nEven so, people will never again look so blindly at the world. The other option is to keep\nthe knowledge out there and let the chips fall where they may. The Garou will have to\nadjust to a world that is struggling not only to get back to its feet, but with the knowledge\nof the supernatural as well. The Litany itself will need to be changed, and the leaders of\nthe Garou must find a way to approach the humans, in time.\nThings are certain to be nice and chaotic for a while, indeed.\nTHE LAST BATTLEGROUND\nIn this scenario, the war of the Apocalypse occurs entirely within the Umbra. The\nPenumbra erupts into chaos as Banes emerge in impossible numbers. One by one, the\nrealms become diseased and fall into ruin. The Black Spiral Dancers stand among the\nBanes and lead their forces onto the Last Battleground foreseen by the wise among those\nwerewolves. And the Wyrm itself, its red eyes glaring beyond five columns made of flesh\nand entrails, enters the Penumbra to destroy Gaia and bring about the Apocalypse.\nNor will the physical world be spared. As the soul of the world is crushed in the\nWyrm’s talons, its body is likewise mangled. Spirits are indiscriminately destroyed en\nmasse, causing droves of animals and plants to die mysteriously in the physical world.\nThe Pattern Web is severed and it unravels, tumbling cities to the ground. To\nhumanity, it will be as if God has left Earth forever and taken the savior with Him. To\nthe Garou, there will no longer be any more waiting for any saviors but themselves.\nTHE SOUL OF THE WORLD\nWhile the Garou’s focus rested upon the material world, the Wyrm’s eyes never\nleft the Umbra.

Cut down\na tree, and the Glade Child within would be weakened, but it would still live and\ncreate another tree elsewhere. Kill the Glade Child, though, and the tree would\nwither and die, deprived of its soul. Thus did, the Wyrm intend from the beginning\nto crush the soul of the world, Gaia, by finding her hidden within the Umbra and\nrending her in his talons.\nEarlier attempts to push into reality were met with strong resistance, however.\nSome even dealt the Wyrm serious damage, pushing back the Apocalypse for centuries\nat a time. So the Triatic Wyrm, full of hatred and rage, brooded in Malfeas and planned\nthe ultimate undoing of the world. To prevent its simple — though very costly —\neviction from the Penumbra, it required an anchor to ground it within. In fact, it\nneeded three: one for the Eater-of-Souls, one for the Beast-of-War, and one for the\nDefiler. These anchors would take the form of ritual sacrifices of monsters whose lives\nand deaths both utterly embodied the member of the Wyrm Triat they would tie tight\nto this world. These sacrifices would be known as the Scions of the Wyrm.\nOnce these beings have been sacrificed, the Wyrm will be able to use such\npowerful deaths to secure enough of a hold in reality to escape Malfeas and enter the\nPenumbra — and the Final Battle will begin at last.\nTHE UMBRA IN CHAOS\nWith the Wyrm’s entry into the Near Umbra, the spirits are in a panic. Nobody\nin the Garou Nation or among the spirits is in any doubt that the End Times are now\nhere, and an “every man for himself” mood descends upon the vast majority of the\nspirits. Nor is this mood undeserved, as hordes of Banes flood the Penumbra and\nslaughter everything in their path.\nIn the End Times, the entire Umbra becomes a war zone. Whereas the fear of\na Bane ambush was a constant danger in the Umbra before, they are now a certainty.\nThere is nearly always a Bane somewhere in sight, and frequently there is a rush of\nthem. (Usually coming right toward you.)\nTHE FIVE COLUMNS\nAt the heart of the enemy strategy are the five columns of flesh. Taking from the\ndead souls of the Nuwisha the knowledge of almost every square inch of the Umbra,\neach column links a Near Realm to the Penumbra. A firmer link than a moon bridge,\nthese columns allow the Triatic Wyrms to marshal their troops, bringing forth untold\nnumbers of Banes from the furthest reaches of the Umbra. The first column is linked\nto Malfeas, and this is the second most important column to all three of the enemy.\nFrom here come the largest number of Banes, as well as the most powerful.\nThe second column links to Scar. Not only do many Banes likewise flood the\nPenumbra from this Realm, but many also come armed with foul blades made from\nwaste and built in that Realm’s factories.\nThe third links to the Atrocity Realm. Few Banes come from this column, but\nthe third column soon becomes a symbol of fear among Gaia’s warriors. This is the\nlast thing that any prisoners taken see from the Penumbra.\nThe fourth column provides a gateway to the Abyss, and it still stands. This fact\nterrifies those who think about it too much. The very Wyrm itself, the force of death\nand destruction, has brought himself into the battle.

While the first has already occurred in canon, that\ndoesn’t mean that the Storyteller shouldn’t feel free to alter the timeline to\nsuit her chronicle. Just remember that despite the characters’ best efforts, the\nsacrificeswill go forward — even if they prevent one, it’s possible that another\nscion will be chosen. Truly preventing them all averts this particular vision\nof the Apocalypse, at least for now.\nFirst Scion: The Demon of India\nScion of the Eater-of-Souls, this ancient vampire emerged in 1999 and\nwas promptly destroyed by a massive effort of elder Leeches, detonation of\npowerful magical weapons and the inadvertent aid of a number of Garou. Its\ndestruction led to the appearance of the manifestation of the Eater of Souls:\nAnthelios, the anti-sun. Of course, if the Storyteller desires, these events can\nbe moved around so that the sept is either present during part of its destruction,\nor perhaps hosts survivors of the battle. As long as the shock of these events is\nfelt around the Garou Nation, the first scion’s death has had its proper impact.\nSecond Scion: Zhyzhak, Green Dragon’s Chosen\nNot long before the Apocalypse unfolds, this mighty Black Spiral Dancer\nscion of the Beast-of-War, receives a vision that her prophesied confrontation\nwith“the last Gaian king” is at hand at last. Her pack takes control of a small town\nand begins killing and torturing the inhabitants, baiting King Albrecht to come\nand fulfill the prophecy. The Storyteller can choose to set this story in a nearby\ntown as a way of getting the sept involved, using Narrator characters to portray\nAlbrecht and his pack as they come to hunt down Zhyzhak. Ultimately, Zhyzhak\nand her fearsome pack are destroyed with the aid of the sept, though not before\nshe mortally wounds Albrecht as well. (It is fated to occur, after all.) As the last\nof her blood drains away, a second red star appears in the sky…\nThird Scion: The Perfect Metis\nThis unwitting Garou is the scion of the Defiler Wyrm, rescued from\nnightmarish circumstances by Garou heroes immediately after its birth.\nThough he was raised with love and tenderness by a sept of Gaian Garou\n(possibly even the characters’ sept, if the Storyteller has allowed them to play\nout the events of Rage Across the Heavens), the Perfect Metis actively\nattempts to escape as the caern comes under attack by Black Spiral Dancers.\nDespite a frantic rescue effort, they take it to a remote defiled caern and spend\nweeks torturing it before finally allowing it to die hideously, a ruined mind\ninside a shattered body. Its death heralds the appearance of the final red star,\nand the emergence of the Wyrm into the Penumbra.\nThese four columns form a square, and in the middle is the fifth and most important\ncolumn. This one, taller than the others, links to Battleground. But rather than merely\nproviding a doorway in and out of the Realm, this column acts as an focus to\nBattleground, or specifically one particular part of Battleground — the Plain of the\nApocalypse. The Five Columns stand at one end, and the Wyrm flies above them in wait.\nThe Warring Hordes lie in wait surrounding the Plain. They are unusually expectant,\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The area possesses an eerie, pregnant silence.\nAnd one end of the Plain remains open and waiting for the soldiers of Gaia.\nTHE REALMS\nEach of the following realms lends a different flavor to “Last Battleground”\nscenarios, allowing Storytellers to choose exactly what kind of Final Battle they wish\nto create. Do the Garou join the endless frenzied hordes of the Battleground in a\nbloody melee, or is the final conflict more of an intellectual game of chess in the\nabstract thoughtspace of the Aetherial Realm? Or does the Final Battle take place\nsomewhere else entirely, in a Realm of the Storyteller’s devising?\nEven if a Realm detailed here is not necessarily the best staging ground for the\nFinal Battle itself, it still has potential to offer story hooks or subplots for the Garou\nto explore during the last days. The Storyteller can incorporate any of them to keep\npacks busy and players guessing as the end approaches.\nStorytellers who desire more detail on the various realms and the spirits found\nthere will find the revised Umbra book and Axis Mundi extremely helpful, though\nit is not required to use either of those books to run this scenario.\nThe Abyss\nOne of the many things that the Apocalypse proved, should any Garou take the\ntime to consider it in the final frantic days, is that the Abyss was not the Wyrm. And\nyet, if Malfeas was the heart of the Wyrm, then the Abyss was his soul. Why, some\nGarou ask, does it exist at all? What is its purpose? With so many of the Wyrm’s forces\noccupied elsewhere, it might be possible for brave packs of Garou to venture into this\nnear-abandoned Realm and find a secret concerning the nature of the Wyrm that\nwill turn the tide of battle — if they survive long enough to return, that is.\nThe Aetherial Realm\nEvery single moon bridge passes through the Aetherial Realm. And this makes the\nAetherial Realm a very tempting target indeed for the Wyrm, who has successfully\nscattered most of the planetary guardians and destroyed much of its natural defenses\nsimply by his dramatic appearance there. The spirits in the Aetherial Realm panic and\ngive the Wyrm a wide berth, opening chances and room for Banes to lie in wait and make\nstrategic attacks on the planetary Incarnae and moon bridges. Of course, nothing says\nthat the Garou will give this ground quite so easily. While doing battle in this often\nabstract and confusing Realm might not suit many Garou, it is an excellent way to\nbalance the Wyrm’s superior numbers, particularly if the players are well suited to puzzles\nand enigmas as well as some quick thinking. The Garou might even attempt to ambush\nthe Wyrm’s main force with a surprise Final Battle as it passes through en route to another\ntarget, exploiting their understanding of the Aetherial Realm to its best advantage.\nArcadia Gateway\nArcadia is dying. At its best it was a lie — if a glorious one. It was a Realm of half-\nreal fantasies playing games with each other and those Garou who would step into their\nlair. Unless the chronicle crosses over heavily with the fae of The Shining Host, it’s\nextremely unlikely that the Final Battle will be staged here, as the fae hosts want no\npart of the Garou war. Then again, a group of Garou might travel here to find a way\nto bring back some of the pure hope and inspiration the Gateway represents to the\nGarou forces. Doing so might bring key figures out of Harano or provide the creative\nspark that makes it possible to devise the winning tactics for the Final Battle.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "81\nCHAPTER THREE\nAtrocity Realm\nIn the Atrocity Realm, most of the atrocities that occur every second are\nprojections of the real world — reflections with no physical or spiritual reality. As not\nsimply a victim of an atrocity but a spiritually important signifier of Atrocity, however,\nthe actual spirit of the Perfect Metis was transferred into the Atrocity Realm to\nexperience the horrors of torture and death over and over for eternity. This is no mere\nemanation but an actual living being — whimpering, lame, constantly tortured by\nBanes, and helpless. If he were taken out of the Atrocity Realm and away from the\ntorturing, violating Banes hovering around, the cub’s suffering would end. (This\nrepresents a possible plan for Garou seeking to cripple the Defiler and thus hamstring\none of the Wyrm’s footholds in the Penumbra.) Of course, the Wyrm will be well aware\nof its vulnerability even as it draws strength from it, and those Garou who seek to rescue\nthe poor cub will face a grueling fight in this already nightmarish Realm.\nBattleground\nPerhaps almost too obvious a choice, the Battleground has never been better\nnamed. Before the Apocalypse, Battleground was divided and formal. The wars never\ncrossed, and those walking along the trails were safe. But in superimposing the\nBattleground onto the Penumbra, the Wyrm destroyed that state. Now, the Battle-\nground has become a single, massive war. Nazi soldiers wage blitzkrieg on Nordic hordes\nand see little confusing about the difference. Nor is anywhere safe any longer, as the trails\nhave been drowned in blood and erased by soldiers’ feet and tanks’ treads. Setting the\nFinal Battle here is an invitation to raw, bloody, unadulterated mayhem on the grandest\nscale (and perhaps a rousing scene involving turning all the armies of history against the\nWyrm). In other words, it’s an excellent idea if your troupe enjoys a great deal of combat\nand tactics, but one that also requires a great deal of planning and attention to logistics\nto portray accurately without being drowned in the number of troops involved.\nCyberRealm\nThe CyberRealm is in chaos. A ragtag but well-equipped group of shapeshifters\nand spirits known as the CyberWolves has begun an armed insurrection against the\nspirits that rule the Realm. The Weaver is not sitting still while the Apocalypse\nbegins, however. She is treading very carefully, aware of just how much she stands\nto lose should humanity panic during the End Times. The Weaver is hoping to come\nout of this with the cities and her handiwork intact, not in pieces. This isn’t out of\nmisguided hope, but rather out of her most basic nature as the creature of order. A\nFinal Battle fought here will be extremely high-tech and fast-paced, with all manner\nof incredible technology augmenting both sides. Unless the Glass Walkers are\nleading the charge, however, this is likely to work much more to the detriment of the\nGarou than their aid, as the enemy is generally much better trained with weapons\nof the modern era. The Weaver might also intervene on either (or neither) side,\nseeking to keep the Realm safe and protect her own servants.\nErebus\nWhile other Realms fall swiftly beneath the enemy’s power, Erebus (at least\ninitially) stands firm. The Incarna who rules Erebus, Charyss, is both awesomely powerful\nand furiously opposed to the Wyrm, and the Realm’s natural defenses are highly effective\n— a burning lake of silver renders it impossible to traverse for the Black Spiral Dancers.\nThe frightening spirit guardians of the Realm, the Brood, feed on Rage, making them\nparticularly vicious against the Rage-empowered Banes that are the Wyrm’s foot soldiers.\nIf the Garou fall, it is likely that Erebus will be the last Realm to fall afterward — but it\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Setting the Final Battle in Erebus itself would be a story of\npure desperation, even for the Apocalypse. Garou do not willingly enter this Realm, and\nits natural features would be as fearsome for the Gaian forces as they would be for the\nenemy. Still, if the Garou are to finally redeem themselves (or be damned forever), where\nbetter to have it happen than the Realm of Judgment?\nFlux Realm\nThough discounted as too inherently unstable to be much harm or help during\nthe Final Battle (and it makes a poor field for the fight itself), the Garou might become\naware of a new threat in the Flux Realm during the End Times. Powerful minions of\nthe Wyrm have discovered a way to create a mystical Seed that contains a burst of pure\ncorruption, and they desire to plant this Seed in the Flux Realm. There, they believe,\nit will catalyze the chaos into creating an all-consuming monster of pure entropy. Most\nTheurges scoff at the notion of the Flux Realm, the embodiment of change, being\nconfined to one purpose by something so lowly as a single Seed, but then again, chaos\nis nothing if not unpredictable. Can the Garou take that chance?\nThe Legendary Realm\nThe Legendary Realm’s Apocalypse began early. The goal of the Wyrm here\nwas not to conquer territory, but to destroy the history of the Garou and defile the\nmemory of their greatest heroes. Robbed of the glory and dignity of their ancestors,\nthe Garou will suffer a terrible blow to their morale, and many might submit to\nHarano and choose to die rather than go on after such a crippling defeat. Packs or\neven an entire sept might be sent here to keep a particularly important legend or hero\nfrom falling to the Wyrm, or at least to recover an important item or bit of\ninformation before it is lost forever. Setting the Final Battle here is either a noble\nstand or a cruel joke, depending on the Wyrm’s progress. The Garou might find\nthemselves fighting gloriously alongside their heroes of legend, or else facing down\nthe gloating enemy over a pile of the defiled corpses of their ancestors.\nMalfeas\nHell does a brisk trade in Apocalypse. Malfeas is chaotic come the last days, for\nwhile describing it as the central command post for the Wyrm credits the foul pre-\ncreation thing a greater mind that it has or would deign to use, such a description has\nsome truth. Like the Abyss, many of the Wyrm’s plans stem ultimately from Malfeas,\nthe most blasphemous patch of Terra Umbra the Garou know. Malfeas is also one of\nthe Realms in which the Garou have the most to gain. Werewolves who understand\nstealth and can choose appropriate targets will be able to deal great damage to the\nWyrm deep within its own home. There are many targets available. The only\nproblem is that none of them will be easily reached or destroyed, and time is of the\nessence if they want these missions to have any impact on the outcome of the war.\nPangaea\nWhile it is not immediately obvious, primal Pangaea has become hideously\ndiseased. By corrupting the primitive tribe that inhabits the Realm, the Wyrm exposed\nthe Realm’s most powerful guardian spirit, the Elder Serpent, to a lingering foulness that\nnow festers in its stomach. And if the great beast dies, the disease will spread to consume\nPangaea and Gaia alike. For Pangaea is the soul and heart of Gaia, the primal point of\ncreation from which her life flows. Garou may visit Pangaea in an attempt to heal the\nmighty Elder Serpent and recruit it for the Final Battle. Actually holding the Final Battle\nhere will encourage a scenario of warfare at its most primal — modern weapons and\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The\nlandscape can be anything the Storyteller desires, from endless grasslands to narrow\nmountain passes to blistering deserts to dark jungles and everything in between. It is also\nan excellent staging ground for a “back to basics” End-Time scenario, where the Garou\nmust rely on their traditional weapons and tools as well as their instincts to carry the day.\nScar\nScar is the Realm perhaps the least changed by the coming of Apocalypse.\nAlready strongly aligned with the Wyrm, yet not particularly one of his strongest places\nof power, the spirits in Scar are hardly the most fearsome. Nearly half are weak-willed\ndrones who exist only to toil in the factories and follow the Wyrm more by rote than\nfervor, and the rest are brutal little thugs who usually need only be tough enough to\nmenace the first. While a poor location to hold the Final Battle — its narrow streets\nand crumbling buildings are ill-suited to either army — a clever strategist might note\nthat it is therefore perhaps the perfect location to build up a surprise force. A reasonably\nsized number of Garou warriors would stand a good chance of successfully liberating\nScar and rallying its inhabitants against their previous overlords, particularly since the\nnastiest of the Banes from the Realm have been moved to the Last Battleground. But\ncan it be done in time to make a difference?\nSummer Country\nSooner rather than later, the Wyrm’s minions will find the Summer Country, and\nits defenses will crumble at their approach. The Wyrm cannot launch the Final Battle\nin the Summer Country, however. Even in its weakened state, this Realm resists such\nimpurity to the point of destruction. Indeed, while the Realm cannot be hidden any\nlonger, it also represents an opportunity for the Garou. If the Garou can follow these\nminions, they too can find the Summer Country. Considering that Gaia’s spirit resides\nthere, albeit severely weakened by ongoing events, such a quest could be no less than\nthe stuff of legends to the Nation. It is possible that Gaia could grant those who find\nher a Gift, a fetish or even a humble secret that greatly increases their chances of\nwinning the Final Battle, though she is in no condition to do much more.\nWolfhome\nThe first Garou to step back into Wolfhome in the Apocalypse will notice the change\nimmediately. No helicopters fly overhead anymore. You can’t hear the sounds of guns\nshooting the wolves or the crackle of electricity from the camps. But nor can you hear the\nhowls of the wolves. And, most tellingly of all, no longer do the Garou come to Wolfhome\nas wolves. Wolfhome is dead. Setting the Final Battle in this haunted, empty place is an\nexcellent choice for a chronicle involving many lupus characters, or even just characters\nparticularly dedicated to restoring the wilderness in general. As the final representation of\nall their deepest fears, it can be a uniquely powerful place to bring it all to an end.\nSTORYTELLING THE FINAL BATTLE\nThe Final Battle is literally everything Werewolf has ever been leading up to.\nSlowly but surely, the Garou have gathered together at the Last Battleground under\nthe banner of Margrave Konietzko, or perhaps another leader who has emerged during\nthe course of the chronicle. Some are not there, having chosen to guard their caern to\nthe end, having succumbed to Harano or having died trying to reach the Battlefield.\nWithin the sight of every man, wolf and monster in the Nation, is an army 10 times\nas large, filled with blasphemous horrors and led by the gargantuan form of the Wyrm.\nAt last, it is time.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The Final Battle does have tactics and\nchanging battlefield conditions that allow a Storyteller to vary the action and keep\nthe players excited as the world comes tumbling to an end.\nGoals of Battle\nThe Final Battle is unusual in many ways, most obviously in that the primary\ngoal of the battle does not require the seizing of any territory. The primary goal of\nbattle here is simply the obliteration of the enemy force. Neither side will attempt\nretreat, so maintaining channels of retreat is a pointless gesture. Unless the\nStoryteller desires to really employ the features of the Realm to full effect in the Final\nBattle, the Plain of the Apocalypse is flat and featureless, completely without hills\nor gullies that might be of value strategically. Despite all this, the battle is not\nwithout points of strategic consideration.\nThe first of these is the most obvious: the Five Columns of Flesh. As the mechanism\nby which the Wyrm will bring in any reinforcements, it assumes tremendous strategic\nvalue. The destruction of any of the columns will hamper the Wyrm’s efforts, most\nespecially the columns connecting Malfeas, the Abyss and the Atrocity Realm.\nGaian Stronghold\nSimilarly, the Garou have a wall to their backs in the caern that borders their\nside of the field. While it is not nearly so important to the Garou as the Columns of\nFlesh are to the Wyrm, the caern is an advantage that the Garou should not throw\naway pointlessly. Any spirit refugees who were harbored in this caern will still be\nthere in the Final Battle, and they can form a useful “base camp” that the wounded\nin the battle can be dragged back to. Since werewolves heal so quickly, and not all\nof their enemies deal aggravated damage, this is no small advantage. Maintaining a\nstrong defense of this caern could assist the Garou in maintaining a tougher fight.\nAlso of value are the two sides of the Battlefield. Since the Warring Hordes form\na solid wall, any troops there cannot be flanked. Most of the Banes will ignore this,\nrushing forward in a mad scramble, but the werewolves on the field may prove more\ncunning and use careful advances along the sides of the battlefield for added security\nor even to lure powerful foes to a devastating trap.\nSurprise Attacks\nStorytellers who want to use a surprise attack by the Wyrm should find ways for\nthe attack to come out of nowhere. Create a minor disturbance — something that\nlooks like a surprise attack such as Black Spiral packs using BurroworPatagia to quickly\nflank the Garou Nation and begin attacking. Play it out hard, make it seem genuine.\nAnd then, only when the players have calmed down, slam down 10 Nexus Crawlers,\nturn the ground to silver and rain steaming blood from the sky. And in the middle of\nthat, have the Wyrm attack proper. Pile it on. Try to panic the players, but give them\na way to succeed as well — not without cost, perhaps, but succeed nonetheless.\nBy contrast, if the players are launching a surprise attack, play up the tension.\nLet the alpha be coordinating the strike using communication fetishes or spirit allies.\nRepeatedly ask your players what they are doing, and make note of every last detail\nin your descriptions and placement of Narrators.

And yet, the\nbattle isn’t quite a massive brawl. While the tactics involved aren’t exactly\nmundane, there is certainly still a strong strategic element to the conflict.\nGarou still attack in packs, rather than individually. While the lack of cover\nand flat terrain renders some pack tactics useless, the basics of how werewolves fight\nstill applies. The Wyrm is aware that despite having Banes available that dwarf\nwerewolves in size, the strong pack fighting makes those Banes not nearly so powerful\nas it could hope. As a result, the Wyrm also needs to create tactics that nullify the\npack advantage. The easiest way to do so is with massive numbers. The Wyrm swarms\nGarou packs with massed units of Scrags or Wyrm Elementals. Even massed, they’re\nlittle match for most Garou, but they break apart pack tactics and consume the\nindividual efforts of the werewolves. After this, a larger Bane will attack the divided\npack, further driving the werewolves apart.\nStorytellers should keep these tactics in mind and develop others to throw at\nthe players during the battle. Don’t just keep moving the next warrior into position\n— eventually, your game will become extremely boring. Instead, mix it up a bit.\nCreate that wave of tiny Banes and then pound your players with the big guy,\nshowing them what the Wyrm’s tactics are meant to do, and then let it level out a\nbit into a field of different Banes. Then, when they get swamped the second time,\nyou can get your players waiting for the other shoe to drop. (And, on a third try, hit\nthem with a massive wave of small Banes, and see if they correlate this with a really\nmassive Bane about to attack.) Keep changing things, but make it obvious that it’s\npart of a strategy, not just a Storyteller ploy to keep things fresh.\nThe Big Guns\nIf the Garou don’t have some incredibly large spirit allies backing them up, then\ntheir chances of winning the Final Battle are practically nil, no matter what other\nadvantages they have. Aside from morale, the primary value of having such mighty\nspirits lies primarily in pinning the Wyrm to its spot above the Five Columns of Flesh.\nShould it leave that spot to wreak havoc upon the Garou, then soon after a massive\nstrike would sever the connection, leaving the reserves in the Near Realms with no\nability to enter the Plain of the Apocalypse. If none of the Celestines, Incarnae or\npowerful totem spirits are at the battlefield, then the Wyrm charges from its waiting\npoint and dives upon the Garou. Acid drips from its underbelly, balefire from its\nmouth and eyes. Hundreds of Garou can die with each swoop, and the Final Battle\nis most probably over very quickly indeed.\nOn the other hand, if larger spirits are present, the Garou not only have more\nhope but also more firepower to help them cut through the seemingly endless ranks\nof the Wyrm’s foot soldiers and target more important foes. Very powerful scenes can\nbe centered around accompanying a totem or even several totem spirits on their “last\ncharge” into the enemy ranks, as the spirits give their lives to draw fire and make\nsome other objective possible to obtain. Some clever players might find other ways\nto strategically use the big guns. If they do so, encourage such creative thinking by\nletting it work.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Give the players time\nto have their characters resolve conflicts with rivals (or refuse, even into death, to let\nthem rest) and otherwise show their characters preparing themselves for the final\ncataclysm. Stay hands off, just giving a few gentle nudges by bringing old characters back\ninto view. Remember, practically the entire Garou Nation is here. Any other werewolf\n(who’s still alive) who the characters have reason to love or hate is going to be here too.\nWhen the players are ready to begin the battle, have the Margrave or another\nleader deliver this speech to the Nation, and then charge into history. Naturally, if\none of your characters has assumed a leadership position and would like to give a\nstirring speech, feel free to let him use some or all of the following speech:\n“Know this, warriors of our Mother! There is nothing after this. Our ancestors\nhave been butchered twice, once in body and once in spirit. There is no Heaven,\nthere will be no Hell. Valhalla does not exist. All that is will be destroyed if we fall\ntoday. And many of you will. The enemy is mighty and fearsome, and we march\nforward into the mouth of death. Do not fight for an afterlife reward for your bravery,\nfor it will not come. Fight instead for Gaia. Fight for all that which you know and\nlove. Fight with every last ounce of Rage left inside of you, so that even should the\nWyrm destroy us, they will be awestruck by your mighty fury.\n“Prove your arms so mighty, prove your anger so terrible, prove your love so pure\nand your passion so encompassing. Prove your minds so resourceful and your zeal and\ncourage so overwhelming that even should every one of us fall today, the armies of\nthe Wyrm will never rest easy.\n“In their reign of Oblivion, every one of their soldiers will look over their\nshoulders and sleep with one eye open. They will live with fear — fear that one day,\nwe will find a way back!”\nA TRIBE FALLS\nIn this scenario, a tribe falls into the Wyrm’s service. This betrayal leads to a\ncivil war within the Garou Nation as the tribes loyal to Gaia must defend themselves\nagainst former allies while still protecting Gaia from the forces of the Wyrm. The\nApocalypse comes from within.\nThis scenario has the potential to be the most personal of the Apocalypse scenarios\ndescribed in this book, but its sweep can be just as epic as any of the others. In fact, it’s\neasy to fold a tribal fall element in with pieces of other scenarios to build an Apocalypse\nthat meets your chronicle’s needs precisely. Of course, it will also take more work. The\nApocalypse will begin and end in different fashion depending on which tribe falls, and\nof course there’s the need to fine-tune the tribe so that the fall seems more plausible.\nIt is strongly recommended that the Storyteller have access to the revised\nTribebook of the tribe that falls to the Wyrm. It isn’t strictly necessary, but it will\ncertainly help flesh out the doomed tribe appropriately, as well as provide any\nnumber of plot hooks and other interesting material.\nWHICH TRIBE?\nThe first question that is likely to come to mind when contemplating a tribal-fall\nApocalypse is: Which tribe is the “best” one to have fall? There’s no perfect answer to\nthis question. An easier decision to make is whether the tribe to fall should be one\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

It’s possible that the Storyteller must answer this\nquestion in the affirmative, as the chronicle may well have representatives from all tribes.\nIf not, it’s much easier to make the fallen tribe be one that isn’t represented by\nany of the players, since the Storyteller can then control all aspects of the fall and\nreveal information to the players only when it is truly necessary and appropriate. It\nis much easier to keep the secret of a tribe’s fall when the Storyteller is the only one\nwho knows about it, after all.\nBy contrast, a Storyteller has to walk a very fine line when running a tribal fall\nfor a tribe represented among the players’ sept. The best way to handle it is to give\nplayers a handle on the events surrounding the fall of the tribe, allowing them to\nmake minor changes to the way it plays out without really affecting the fact of the\nfall of the tribe. They might not be able to stop the rest of their tribe, but they might\nbe able to save some close friends or Kinfolk from falling to the Wyrm. Perhaps they\neven emerge as leaders of the remaining fragments of their tribe.\nTRIBAL-FALL ELEMENTS\nEvery tribal-fall story involves a common set of elements. The short version of\nthe story is that a given tribe becomes corrupted by the Wyrm, betrays the Garou\nNation and Gaia to the Wyrm, then brings about the Apocalypse, ending the world\nas the Garou know it.\nNo two tribes experience this fall in quite the same fashion. One might lurk in\nthe service of the Wyrm for years, slowly plotting and planning, while another could\nfall and take the fight to the Garou Nation within a matter of weeks. One tribe might\nfall almost by accident, while another could decide that the Wyrm’s side is the only\none worth standing on. While the broad scope might look similar for each tribe, each\ntribe causes the Apocalypse to spin somewhat differently, and a Storyteller should\nexpect to put his own unique stamp on what happens.\nThe elements listed here are only some of the possible points to consider when creating\nyour story. The examples that follow touch on every one of these points, however.\nFORESHADOWING\nPlot out the activities that a tribe’s leader (or other influential members) takes that\nlead it to be corrupted by the Wyrm. This motivation guides the rest of the tribe’s activities.\nThe werewolves might be tricked into falling — led into a cavern that turns out to echo\nthe Black Spiral, for instance. They might find some other threat that they consider to be\neven worse than the Wyrm, driving it into the arms of the Wyrm out of desperation.\nOf course, the tribe could also turn to the Wyrm out of a cold calculation that the\nApocalypse has already begun and the Wyrm’s side is the one most likely to win…\nOmens: Early in the tribe’s fall — or even before it has begun to fall — the only\nthings noticeable are the gentle shakings of cosmology. The tribe itself occupies an\nimportant place in Gaia’s reality, and the tribe’s totem, as an Incarna, has a key role as\nwell. As the tribe begins to fall, therefore, Theurges, those with high Gnosis or those with\nhigh Occult scores might all experience unsettling omens. They could occur through\ndreams or through observations of mystically significant everyday circumstances.\nTHE FIRST STEP\nWhat step, precisely, does the tribe take that enters it into the Wyrm’s service?\nThis should be a specific thing — a point beyond which no sane person can claim\nthat the tribe does not serve the Wyrm, even if some individual members do not.

It is a dramatic event, with repercussions\nthroughout the physical and spiritual worlds. No one with a Gnosis above two Traits\nfails to recognize that something ominous has taken place, though the signs might\nnot clearly point out just what actually happened.\nPolitics: As some factions of the tribe turn toward the Wyrm, a Garou character\nmight hear rumors of strange activity among her tribemates. Rumor spreads far and\nwide. Perhaps the initial cover story spread through the tribe is that the tribe’s\nleadership has been working on a secret ritual to fight the Weaver or Wyrm. As the\ncircle of fallen Garou expands through the tribe, those who still serve Gaia find\nthemselves excluded from otherwise ordinary rituals or tribal activities. Rumors of\na “cult of the favored” spreads among the Gaian Garou, and many petition to join\nthe “favored” so that they can regain what political power they had, never guessing\nthat such activity will spell their doom. Certain septs could fall in their entirety very\nquickly, while others might be quite resistant to the call of the Wyrm.\nFor the troupe’s packs, this could be a time for careful investigation. At the same time,\nthough, the fallen Garou of the tribe are at their most paranoid. Spirits and young Garou\npatrol the outskirts of nearly every gathering, Garou all wear Wolf Skin fetishes and so on.\nCOVERT ACTIVITY\nCertain tribes might spend weeks, months or even years with their heads down,\nnot yet revealing to the other tribes that they’re in the service of the Wyrm. They\nmight be extending their reach in some fashion, or they could be hunting down rogue\ntribe members who haven’t yet turned.\nThis is a time of great urgency for the fallen werewolves. They have an\nenormous opportunity to strike from surprise, but they must swiftly quell any internal\nopposition, lest those traitors who remain loyal to Gaia reveal the tribe’s subversion.\nAs a result, expect the deaths of many Garou during this period, at the hands of\nmysterious werewolves who give all indication of being Black Spiral Dancers.\nThe troupe’s sept might be called upon to investigate these murders. That\ninvestigation could be the first time that the sept encounters evidence of the Wyrm’s\ntentacles extending deep into a Gaian tribe.\nHunts: Once the fallen Garou of the tribe solidify their power base and control\nroughly 2/3 of the tribe’s numbers, they begin calling nightly hunts of the “rebels” who\nremain in service to Gaia. This is a brief and intense period just before the tribe’s fall\ncomes out into the open, and it really represents the kickoff of the Apocalypse itself.\nThe hunters do their best to capture rebellious tribemates alive, and bring them\nback to the nearest Hive for “re-education.” This gives rebel Garou a fighting\nchance, as their foes aren’t striking to kill — at least not at first. Once the fallen tribe\nhas been exposed to the rest of the Garou Nation, its leadership accepts that most\nremaining rebels are simply losses to their great cause, and they strike at the holdouts\njust as they would strike at any other Gaian Garou.\nIn the end, not every Garou of the fallen tribe falls into the service of the Wyrm.\nSome keep their freedom; some manage to be adopted by another tribe’s totem or live\nas Ronin through the end.\nREVEALED!\nEventually too many factors pile up to enable the fallen tribe to hide its\nexistence from the rest of the Garou Nation.

If the traitors are sufficiently organized, they might even\nannounce their new state openly, defying the other Garou to challenge them.\nAt this stage, be ready for a lot of frantic questions and frenzied activity from\nthe players, particularly if there are characters from that tribe who haven’t learned\nof the corruption yet. Have a plan for what the Nation as a whole will do about the\nmatter, as well as some ideas for how the sept might respond as well, and be ready\nto spring those ideas into action soon after the revelation hits. Players should feel\nlike their world has been turned upside-down and that events are happening\nalmost too fast to keep track of.\nTRIBAL FALL AND TOTEM SPIRITS\nA fallen tribe’s totem has one of several fates. First, the totem spirit itself could\nfall into the service of the Wyrm (or the Weaver). The spirit could become deluded,\ntrapped and poisoned, or deliberately throw itself to the Wyrm’s side. In fact, the spirit’s\nfall might be the cause of its tribe’s fall. Of the tribal totem spirits, the ones most likely\nto end up on the Wyrm’s side seem to be Grandfather Thunder, Griffin, Great Uktena,\nand Great Wendigo, but there’s no tribal totem spirit that is immune to a fall.\nIf the Incarna is killed, its tribe is rudderless. The tribe might simply scatter,\napproaching other tribes of Garou (and their totems) for adoption. A tribe with no\nsurviving totem spirit cannot adopt new members, nor can its members learn Gifts\nfrom Jaggling or Gaffling avatars of the totem. Jaggling pack totems of that Incarna\nbecome listless, distracted and lose half their Gnosis. Garou of a tribe with no totem\nspirit cannot gain Rank, and they are more prone than their brethren to enter\nHarano. The tribe’s Umbral homeland becomes unstable and chaotic. For all these\nreasons, it is imperative that the tribe find a new totem.\nNot every fallen totem follows an identical path, but most perform the same\ngeneral sweep of actions:\nCorrupt the Children. There are several simple ways to corrupt Garou, from\nthe perspective of a tribal totem gone bad. A good way to rapidly turn Garou to the\nWyrm is to feed them corrupt Gnosis. A cunning totem knows when its packs hunt\nspirits for Gnosis, and it makes sure to have subtly corrupted Gafflings and Jagglings\nfall into the pack’s path. More violent and less subtle totems may choose to use the\nwerewolves’ Rage against them. Present a Garou with enough opportunities to frenzy\nand sooner or later, he’ll either do something awful and regrettable during the frenzy\nor be pushed into the Thrall of the Wyrm. A Totem of War might have unusual\nability to affect a werewolf’s Rage in this regard.\nTarget the Leadership. The totem starts by corrupting the highest-ranking\nmembers of the tribe. For ease of access (and concealment) it begins with those Garou\nwho are members of packs dedicated to it. If Stag falls, it goes after high-ranking Fianna\nin Stag packs first. It subsequently spreads its influence, reaching out for high-ranking\nGarou of its tribe who are not members of its packs, and then members of its packs of\nall ranks, and finally low-ranking Garou with other pack totems.\nProvide Tainted Magic. While the charm offensives listed previously are\ngoing on, the totem might begin to provide its more vulnerable — “trusted” —\nTheurges and Philodox with new versions of old rituals, fetishes and Gifts. These\nnew versions rely on Wyrm spirits rather than Gaian spirits, but that might not be\nimmediately obvious.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "90\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nINTO THE TALONS OF THE WYRM\nWhichever tribe falls to the Wyrm, it won’t be alone in its service. The White Howlers\nfell to the Wyrm, many centuries ago, becoming the Black Spiral Dancers. The relationship\nbetween the fallen tribe and the Dancers could be crucial to an Apocalypse chronicle.\nJOINING THE DANCERS\nThe fallen tribe could simply join the brood of Whippoorwill, greatly increasing\nthe size of the Black Spiral Dancer tribe. This is the simplest option, though it does\nraise the question of the fate of the tribe’s original totem. Packs of the fallen tribe\nwould either join Dancer packs or form intact packs of their own. Certainly these\nnew members of the Black Spiral Dancers would be less prone to inbred madness and\nhereditary taint. The flip side is that the integration of old and new Black Spiral\nDancers is never easy or painless. The integration of hundreds of new Wyrm-Garou\nshould lead to chaos and even, possibly, a civil war in the tribe until clear leaders from\nboth old and new emerge and come to terms with one another.\nRIVALS TO THE DANCERS\nThe most likely result of a tribe’s fall to the Wyrm is that that tribe stands\nseparately from the Black Spiral Dancers, becoming another tentacle of the Wyrm.\nWhile it is possible that the two tribes would cooperate in service of the Wyrm, given\nthe rivalry that Whippoorwill is sure to have with another Wyrmish Garou tribal\ntotem, it is much more likely that the tribes’ activities do not seriously overlap. When\nthey do overlap, dark Garou on both sides vie for dominance over the others — a\nsituation that the Wyrm encourages (to see that only the strongest survive to serve it)\nand that clever Garou might be able to exploit if they can learn about it in time.\nDANCERS EXTERMINATED\nA powerful and proud tribe could perhaps destroy the Black Spiral Dancers after\nfalling to the Wyrm’s service. A tribe such as the Silver Fangs might brook no rival in\nJUST FOLLOWING ORDERS\nThe default assumption throughout this chapter is that the fallen tribe\nsuccumbs to the wiles of the Wyrm. Within the last half century, though, it\nhas become more obvious to the Garou that the Weaver, and her madness, is\nat least as big a threat to Gaia as the Wyrm is. Nearly any of the tribes that fall\nto the Wyrm might fall to the Weaver instead. The Wyrm wants to foment\nchaos and destruction in order to drag Gaia to her doom and restart the\nuniverse. The Weaver, by contrast, wants to push Gaia into stasis.\nSo while the Wyrm targets a tribe to fall in order to cause the maximum\ndisruption to the Garou Nation and to Gaia’s spirit hierarchy, the Weaver\ntargets a tribe to fall in order to calm the Garou Nation down, as well as smooth\nout ripples in the spirit realm. Sick of endless war and near despair at the state\nof the world, many Garou would certainly be tempted to embrace a power that\npromises to give them the world of their desires — in return for helping remove\nunwanted “aberrations” while remaking the world in that image, of course.\nStorytellers interested in this angle need only think about what a given\ntribe’s utopia would be like, and how the Weaver could convince them that\nit would be made reality through its service.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Never forget what is said about the path of good intentions. Believing that\nthey will sacrifice their lives for the good of Gaia, the elders of the tribe perform an\nancient ritual to cleanse the Wyrm of its madness — but something goes horribly\nwrong, corrupting the participants to the cause they were attempting to heal.

Many\ninnocent Fianna are summoned to meetings with their fallen kin (carefully disguised to hide\ntheir taint), only to find themselves surrounded and facing the choice to join or die.\nGet of Fenris\nThe Pure arise from a great campaign to cleanse a series of interconnected\nmystic tunnels the Black Spirals have dug under the North Sea, which allow them\nto strike across Europe at great speed.

In the face of opposition from the other\ntribes, Great Wendigo urges his children onward to greater acts of ferocity, until\nfinally the Wyrm takes them all.\nThe Beast Courts\nThe Stargazer tribe of the Garou, along with many of its hengeyokai allies of Asia,\nfinds itself torn between two factions: those who believe the arrival of the Sixth Age (the\nApocalypse) can be delayed, and the Fatalists who believe nothing more can be done\nand give themselves over to the Wyrm in hopes of easing the death agonies of the world.\nTHE WAR ITSELF\nIf the fall of a tribe is simply a prelude to another sort of war, then refer to the other\nsections of this chapter for guidance. If, on the other hand, you wish to focus on the uniquely\ntribal nature of this war, consider a few analogies from the United States Civil War.\nFirst, the fallen tribe’s members know everything that is public knowledge within\nthe Garou Nation. They know where the big caerns are. They know who the\nimportant leaders are, and someone in the fallen tribe probably knows each leader’s\nweaknesses, strengths, preferred Gifts, rites and fetishes to boot.\nIn this scenario, one of the weaknesses of modern-day Garou society that so\nmany elders rail against is exposed as a true weakness: With so many multi-tribe\npacks out there, the fall of a single tribe to the Wyrm exposes the weaknesses and\nsecrets of the majority of Garou. If modern Garou society were more insular — with\nmost packs being single-tribe packs — then the fallen tribe would not have\ninfiltrated the others quite so deeply, and its loss, while still hard, would not be\ncrippling in the way it could be today.\nBy the same token, though, the elders and leaders of the fallen tribe grew up with\nthe rest of the Garou Nation — everybody knows everybody. The modern leaders\nof the Western Concordiat have a good idea of the skills, strengths and weaknesses\nof their erstwhile allies. They all know one another’s fighting styles and should\nprobably spend some time thinking, “I know he’d prefer to do this in a frontal assault,\nbut he knows I know he’d prefer to do this in a frontal assault…”\nFallen and loyal Garou try to use their former pack bonds and mutual loyalties\nagainst the others. Fallen Garou expect their former packmates and allies to fight\nwith regret, perhaps holding back on the killing blow in the hopes of redeeming a\nfriend from a dark fate. Count on fallen Garou to take advantage of this by feigning\nsurrender or showing false loyalty. Gaian werewolves can call on old loyalties and\ndredge up memories that are unpleasant to fallen Garou — they might pull a few\nformer allies into frenzy. Gifts, rites and totem powers that rely on two Garou being\npackmates might well still work on fallen former packmates.\nEND OF THE WAR\nA tribal-fall scenario doesn’t have to stand alone. Any tribe’s fall could lead into\nany of the other three major scenarios presented here. A tribal fall to the Weaver\ncould lead to a “Weaver Ascendant” scenario; tribal totems falling to the Wyrm\nmight lead to a “Last Battleground” scenario; just about any of them could lead to a\n“Ragnarok” scenario. And the tribal fall could be its own thing — the fall results in\nwar among the Garou and the emergence of the Wyrm’s forces.\nIf the story does spin off into other scenarios in this book, it is critically important to\nresolve the tribal fall scenario itself as the war comes to an end. It’s a simple rule of drama.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "94\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nIf the Apocalypse kicks off because of the fall of a tribe to the Wyrm, a satisfying resolution\nto the tribe has to be reached. It can be a tragic resolution — and it probably will be.\nRAGNAROK\nThe Apocalypse has obsessed Garou since the Beginning. While some mystics have\nasked themselves and the spirits about what awaits them — and have come up with a\nvariety of answers — most Garou have looked forward to a battle in which the Nation\nwould fulfill its final purpose of battling the Wyrm to a finish. Now it’s the End Time,\nDoomsday, Judgment Day, Armageddon, Ragnarok, the End of All Songs. The proph-\necies unfold; no doubt the End is here. This story concerns the final enacting of what filled\nthe mouths of poets and sages for so long, what made the Garou and will unmake them.\nIn this section, the Storyteller will find a suggested series of End-Times events\nthat, along with ideas for telling stories centered on the characters’ active involve-\nment in the Final Battle between the Gaian Host and the Hordes of the Wyrm.\nThese events provide space for many stories, even a complete chronicle and a\nframework for chronicles set in that time. Rather than specifying the exact places\nand people involved, it seems better to give events and ideas here, along with some\nstory seeds, and to let the Storyteller fit them into an existing chronicle.\nTHE STORY OF THE FALL\nThe events of Rage Across the Heavens have acquainted the planetary Incarnae\nall too well with the situation of Mother Gaia. While most of the planetary spirits do not\nONE STANDS ALONE\nYou may choose, at the end, to have the entire Garou Nation fall save for\none tribe. Just about any tribe would work in this role, but it makes the most sense\nto have the nature of the other tribes’ fall be something that the chosen tribe is\nmore resistant to. If the Wyrm works through perverting the Ancestor Spirits of\nall the other tribes, then it makes sense that most Silent Striders would be\nresistant to such corruption. If the Wyrm drags Garou to fall by goading their\nRage to intolerable levels, perhaps the Children of Gaia would resist.\nAt the Storyteller’s discretion, the last “tribe” might not even be a single\ntribe at all, but a collection of surviving Garou who share a common tie, or\nperhaps lack a specific Trait that leads to corruption. This connection can be\nanything the Storyteller desires, such as a certain Gift or fetish, high Gnosis,\nlow Rage, Ancestor or Pure Breed Backgrounds or high Willpower. These\nsurvivors band together to form the Tribe of the Apocalypse, forging a new\nidentity and possibly even a new totem bond even as their former allies gather\nthe Wyrm’s minions around them.\nWhichever tribe stands alone surely faces an impossible siege, a guerrilla war\nthat it is sure to lose barring some utterly miraculous event. The tribe members may\nfind individual allies here and there — some Kami, perhaps, a few nature spirits,\nor lone Garou or Fera who have resisted the Wyrm’s call. This situation is even\nmore bleak than most other scenarios portrayed herein, and possibly not for most\ntroupes due to its excessively bleak outlook. Still, those looking for a truly tragic\nlast stand might find that the One Tribe twist suits them just fine.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "95\nCHAPTER THREE\nsee anything that they can do about the tragic situation, one of them decides to take\nmatters into his own claws. Rorg, the Many-Taloned Hunter of the Asteroid Belt, strikes\nat Earth. He wishes to prevent its destruction, and as his own world is long destroyed, he\ncannot be afraid of retaliation. Rorg launches his Claw, the asteroid that humans call\nGeographos, into a trajectory that will strike the Earth. The raging Incarna believes that\ndoing so should make the Earth useless to the Wyrm and to Anthelios. Gaia, he believes,\ncan recover with the Wyrm so crippled. This act causes the Shattering of Luna, the Fall\nand the Great Black, and it sets the stage for the Final Battle.\nAs the asteroid comes closer, visibly deviating from its orbit, Garou and humans\nbecome very worried. Nostradamus was not the only prophet whose work was interpreted\nto foretell a “mountain” falling into the sea. The darkest dreams of the Mokolé hint at\nsuch an event, although millions of years past. Once word reaches them, the Dragon\nBreed themselves begin to panic. Mokolé start to prepare for the end, or the beginning.\nTHE SKY ROAD\nThe coming of the Claw means that the Garou must try to stop it before it strikes\nthe Earth. Mostly likely your characters’ packs are nominated (it being their chronicle).\nIf the packs are too inexperienced, the Storyteller may allow some Narrator “guest\nstars” to help them handle it. The pack must seek entrance to the Deep Umbra,\nwhether at a caern familiar to them with that capability or the Sept of the Stars, a\nStargazer site in the Aetherial Realm of the Near Umbra. Additionally, each Garou\nwill require some means of breathing in the Deep Umbra. A nosegay of fetish flowers\nthat are sniffed to provide oxygen will suffice if no other ideas emerge.\nThe Claw itself appears to be less a world in itself than a flying mountain. Its\nsurface is rock, cracked and pitted by meteorite impacts. The Garou step sideways into\nthe fetish orrery to the Umbra of the asteroid, a brilliantly lit place where Helios dazzles\nthem and burns their eyes. Earth is visible as a blue star accompanied by a white star\n(the moon). They “swim” rather than walk along with the asteroid, floating in the\nocean-sky of the Umbra. The whirling of the Claw means that Helios’ light alternates\nwith starry dark. In this environment the Wyld-spirits who swarm on the Claw will be\nable to attack the Garou almost by surprise. A Vortex leads as many Lesser Wyldlings\nas there are Garou. The Vortex is the “motor” by which the asteroid moves, and its\nCharms of fire, flaming vapors and steam smoke are its secondary weapons. It seems like\na living fountain or volcano. The Wyldlings appear as distortions in the whirling stars\nand put a one-Trait penalty on all attempts to attack them directly unless the Garou\nuses Scent of Sight or a similar power to circumvent the need for vision.\nThe battle should be fierce. If the Garou are driven off the asteroid and back into\nthe Deep Umbra, Geographos will continue toward the Earth and only the sacrifice\nof Luna will enable Earth to survive. If the Garou disperse all the spirits, including\nthe Vortex, then the asteroid will be on an inertial trajectory and might be deflected\nby a Deep Impact style nuke. The sacrifice of Luna is still plausible. The battle on the\nasteroid should not stop the Fall and the Great Black unless the Storyteller doesn’t\nreally want an “Apocalypse” story.\nTHE RECONCILIATION\nNot long after the Claw appears, the Garou are approached by unexpected\nallies: the Mokolé. The Mokolé seek rapprochement with their ancient enemies,\nwith negotiations centered on alliance in the face of imminent catastrophe. The\nMokolé insist that the Garou make a gesture of genuine atonement for the Wars of\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

They might perform Rites of Cleansing and offer a permanent point of Rage\nas a sacrifice to Gaia, for instance. If the players roleplay genuine grief and remorse,\nthe Mokolé are satisfied and full negotiations begin.\nTheir offer is an alliance with the Garou, the restoration of the First Times.\nThey don’t recognize the Garou tribal divisions and assume that the elders who\nconfront them speak for all the canine shapeshifters, including the Nuwisha and\nKitsune. The negotiations should last for some time. Neither Changing Breed fully\ntrusts the other, and with good reason. Cliath Garou could be involved as liaisons,\nmessengers and guards. Elder characters will be sent to conduct the negotiations.\nWhen the Mokolé are satisfied that they can trust the Garou, they will explain\nthe true purpose of their coming. The Garou are the only ones who can attempt a\nquest into the Mokolé realm of Mnesis, the shared memory of Gaia. The Garou must\ndelve into this mental sea to retrieve the lost Gifts of the First Times, Gifts that a\nMokolé cannot use or even know, in order to use them against the Wyrm.\nTHE MNESIS QUEST\nThe werewolf or werewolves who choose to accept this mission first listen to a\nwarning from the Mokolé about the dangers of Mnesis quests. The monsters of\nmemory devour some who seek treasure in the sea of lost time; the memories\nthemselves can lure travelers to their doom, and some memories tear the mind apart.\nThat said, the chosen characters will be sent into the Memory of Gaia through the\nuse of teacher plants. The Dragon Breed cannot do so themselves, as their reptilian\nminds cannot learn Gifts from mammalian beings or spirits.\nThe quest itself is a fabulous roleplaying opportunity for Storytellers to exploit.\nStructure it as a strange descent through memories that the characters recognize as\nbelonging to their own past, to their grandparents, great-grandparents, and so on,\nback further and further in time. Each memory connects to the next through a door\nin a wall, a garden gate, a path through trees, crossing a stream and so on. Dream-\nHunters — powerful memories that take the shape of a dangerous enemy from the\ntime and place where the memory scene is set — might assault the Garou, and they\ncan be permanently killed only if the Garou travel to the memory where the creature\noriginated and destroy it there.\nFinally, the Garou arrive in the First Times, long before the Impergium or the\nWars of Rage, when all shapeshifters lived together in peace with Gaia and each\nother. The Earth is a wild place, and animals long extinct in the material world roam\nhere. A moot convenes to welcome the “visitors.” The Garou see bull-headed and\nboar-shaped changers at the moot that they attend: These are the lost Apis and\nGrondr, along with Camazotz bat-shifters and Khara Bastet. This should be a scene\nof great wonder and mystery, as things the Garou never knew existed make\nthemselves known. Learning the Gifts and rites in question should likewise be a\npowerful experience, especially the Last Rite (described on p. 97), which the\nchangers of the past impart sadly, hoping it will never be needed.\nTHE CLAW DESCENDS\nMeanwhile, humans have learned from their own scientists that the Claw\napproaches, and the result is worldwide hysteria. The Garou should be aware\nanywhere in the human world that humans are panicked, violent and very afraid.\nCaerns see lots of kin seeking shelter. Human governments try to prepare mineshaft\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Among them are vampires, seeking to follow their herds into safety\nwhere a food supply awaits them and the sun never shines. Few other supernaturals\nattempt to enter these Weaver-thickened areas, whose inhabitants will likely be lost\nto the Weaver, even should they survive the Fall.\nAs the Claw nears the Earth, the US, Russia and possibly China try to use\nnuclear weapons or large lasers to shatter the asteroid or change its course.\nDepending on the tenor of the chronicle, the Changing Breeds might be involved\nin this effort as well. The United States sends astronauts with a nuclear charge to\nplant on the Claw; the Garou could even be involved in guarding or warding the\nastronauts from the dangers present on the asteroid. Storytellers might tell two tales\n— one of the astronauts planting the device, and the other of the Garou who follow\nin the Umbra to help them, without the astronauts’ knowledge.\nAt the same time, the use of nuclear weapons is seen as evil by almost all Gaian\ncreatures. How will Gaia respond to this activity? Does she withdraw Her gifts, as she\nis said to do for the Abominations? Will she accept that this is being done to save\nher? If a nuclear device goes out into space, then the Storyteller may rule that for\ndramatic purposes, it goes off and shatters the asteroid, but pieces of the Claw still\nstrike the Earth and the moon.\nWAKING THE MOON\nThe Mnesis quest has found many powerful Gifts and rites, and the threat of an\nasteroid hitting the Earth is sufficient to pull feuding tribes together. As the Claw\ngets closer, it becomes obvious that only one thing can be done to prevent Gaia’s\nabsolute destruction — the Last Rite, the Rite of Waking the Moon. This Level-Six\nrite requires all the permanent Gnosis Traits of all the ritemasters, meaning that they\nalmost certainly never perform any other rites. Despite their fear of this fate and their\nhostility toward one another, ritemasters from each Gaian tribe attend, along with\na few members of other Changing Breeds.\nThe players’ characters may be involved in the Last Rite as assistants to the\nritemasters. Due to the sacrifice it entails, though, they should not be full partici-\npants unless they do not wish to take part in the rest of the chronicle from that point.\nThe rite itself is spectacular — as the ritemasters chant, the moon begins to move,\nat first barely perceptibly, and then visibly slewing away from its usual path. Humans\ngo from panic into utter hysteria at this sight. As it passes through Earth’s shadow,\nthe moon enters eclipse for one final time, turning reddish-gray before becoming\nsmaller as it leaves Earth to block the path of the Claw.\nTHE SHATTERING OF LUNA\nRorg’s Claw strikes Luna with a gigantic explosion. Anyone watching the moon\nsees what seems to be a flaming hammer blow at the edge of the moon’s disc, splitting\nthe Moon in two. All lunar-connected supernatural creatures, including Garou,\nGurahl and Bastet, feel a sharp angina-like pain when that happens, as if they are\nhaving a heart attack. This feeling does not fade until the pieces of the moon set.\nFrom that point forward, it is no longer possible to regain Rage from the moon. Nor\nwill the moon’s light deter the undead.\nThe moon is not destroyed, but huge pieces of it are now blasted into solar orbit.\nIt is both damaged and in the wrong place. The largest remaining chunk ends up in\nan eccentric orbit around the sun, shepherding Earth’s orbit. For most of the time,\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

About one month\nafter the Shattering, a final sign appears in the heavens. Clouds clear for a moment\nover the place where the characters are.\nAs the sun rises or sets, a huge brilliant comet with a prominent tail appears near\nthe place where the sun is about to rise, or has just set. Garou and Kin with any\nscientific knowledge realize that this is a huge chunk of the moon, falling so near the\nsun that it is boiling into space.\nTHE GREAT BLACK\nThe Fall means the end of human civilization for a long time. By itself, this\nwould be a disaster of apocalyptic proportions, but the Wyrm has more ambitious\nplans. The True Father wishes to use the suffering and horror of the Fall and the\nGreat Black to feed its own powers, to enable it to destroy Gaia’s defenders. From this\npoint forward, Garou face two challenges: first, the destruction of human, animal\nand plant life all around them, and second, the onslaught of the Wyrm’s evil in the\nchaos created by the asteroid impacts.\nMany of the quests given to packs relate to the horrors of the Fall and the Great\nBlack, though the skills and loyalties of each tribe and each Garou are part of the Quests\nas well. Silent Striders and Uktena might try to stop the Fall with rites and Umbra\njourneys. The Get and Fianna seek to hunt down the Wyrm-creatures and undead who\nrise to prominence in the new age. Bone Gnawers and Children of Gaia could seek to\naid suffering humans and wolves who freeze or starve in the cold darkness.\nNUKES, KNIVES AND SHARP STICKS\nSo what exactly happens to the world when it suffers multiple impacts from\nsuch large objects? The answer is that while the devastation of such a scenario\nshould always be widespread and terrible, at the same time it should be no more\nterrible than the Storyteller requires for her story. If she wants a number of cities\nto survive more or less intact, so be it. If all she wants left of civilization is a\nsmoldering ruin, let none be spared. Yes, billions of humans will die in the\nimmediate destruction of the impacts and the “follow-up” horrors to come —\npestilence, famine, war, etc. — but the quick-and-dirty answer is that nobody\nthe Storyteller needs to survive will die in the chaos, at least not right away.\nAnother important question is the general technology level she wants to\nhave in effect during the rest of the scenario. Do the impacts quickly reduce\neveryone to primitive tools as supplies of batteries, ammunition and gasoline run\nout? That kind of ending offers some advantages to Garou (well, except the Glass\nWalkers) who are long accustomed to using such tools. On the other hand, the\nend of civilization might see pockets of relatively modern life survive, perhaps\neven advance as governments at last unleash their secret technologies and black-\nbook projects in a desperate effort to maintain control. Players are likely to ask\nearly on exactly what services and utilities are still available, not to mention what\nweapons they can get their hands on, so careful consideration should be given to\njust how much of a technological impact will be felt during Ragnarok.\nIn the end, the Storyteller shouldn’t feel constrained to unleash any more\nchaos, destruction and horror than she feels is necessary for her particular scenario.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Storytellers, again, must decide which part of\nthe end to emphasize, and they should feel free to make both a part of the stories.\nWith septs encompassing multiple packs, they might wish to give each pack one or\nmore of the outlined plots that follow, then bring the survivors back together to face\nthe final stand of the Last Caern.\nHELLMOUTH\nAs Anthelios rises for the first time after the Fall, a new horror begins. Volcanic\nseams open in three places around the Earth, spewing lava and Wyrm-filth into the\ndying world. The Father Below, the True Father, now opens his jaws. These seams\nmanifest in Japan, California and the Great Rift of Africa. Huge cracks open in the\nearth’s body (one mile’s length or so of crack a day), swallowing animals, buildings,\npeople and rivers or lakes. The Jaws vary in width and zigzag and spiral, following no\nknown laws of geology or physics. Anyone viewing them from the air must make a\nWillpower Challenge as versus the Delirium, as the rifts form Wyrm-signs and the\nsight of these shapes can drive one mad.\nIn sight of the Jaws’ opening, all Gaian creatures are at a one-Trait penalty on\nall challenges. Caerns along the Jaws’ cracks drain and die at a rate of one level per\nday. Black Spiral Dancer Hives are planned with the Jaws in mind and aren’t\naffected. Any Gaian creature who comes close to the heat of the volcanic cracks\nsuffers one health level of lethal damage per minute that can be naturally healed only\nonce one is away from the heat. Wyrm creatures grow stronger from the eruptions\nand gain Gnosis from them as from a caern. This is the fulfillment of the Sixth Sign\nof the Prophecy of the Phoenix: Fire boils from the depths.\nNIGHT OF DARK FIRE\nAs if the Garou did not already have enough foes, the undead now pose a serious\nthreat to the continued existence of humans, including Kin. The Great Black enables\nthe vampires and other rots to realize their ancient End-Time “prophecies.” This is the\nSeventh Sign of the Prophecy of the Phoenix. On the first night after the Black begins,\nthe ancient vampires rise from their tombs, the thirst of ages driving them to seek and\nkill not only their offspring, but shapeshifters, whose blood is believed to be very\npotent. The Garou will have to assign packs to control or kill these terrible foes.\nMany tales could also center on the Garou who must make terrible choices, since\nnot all humans can be saved when Garou strength is limited. When Garou must choose,\nwill they favor humans who have needed skills? The young and innocent? Those whom\nthey deem attractive or potential mates? Can they live with their choices afterward?\nWhat of the vampires who offer aid to the Garou, claiming to know secret “magics” that\ncan defeat the ageless monsters? Can the undead be trusted, even for a moment? What\nif the alternative is that an ancient bloodsucker is free to raven and slay?\nSEEKING THE SHARDS\nThe Fall has damaged the Earth immensely, but the Shards and the Claws are\nas valuable as they are destructive. The sky-stones hold power for the Wyld and for\nthe world. The Garou have to reach the Shards of Luna before the Black Spiral\nDancers get to them, as they are almost the only means of regaining Rage as if Luna\nwere still whole. There are three Shards on Earth’s surface.\nThe Storyteller must invent places for the Three Shards of Luna to fall.

Bear in mind that travel during this time is all but impossible by mortal means,\ndue to the chaos of the Great Black, and even Umbral travel is quite risky. Add to\nthat the fact that the Shards have fallen in forbidden places, are being actively\nsought by the minions of the Wyrm and might already be in the possession of another\ninterested party by the time the characters arrive. Material exists for quite a few\ninteresting stories just concerning the recovery of the Shards.\nTHE ASCENT FROM HELL\nThe Great Black, horrific as it is, is only the beginning of the End of All Songs.\nThe deaths of billions of humans and animals to hunger, fire and cold opens the\nmouth of darkness and allows nightmare to walk. The Wyrm’s Horde emerges from\nthe Jaws of the True Father and walks the Earth openly. Materializing bodies on\nEarth or possessing the dead, the Maeljin and their subordinates gather all that is evil\nand mad about them as the world dies.\nThen they begin to march.\nStorytellers should feel free to place any and all Wyrm-tainted enemies the players\nhave ever faced in the ranks of the Horde. Include a few they believed destroyed, newly\nreborn in the fires of the End Times, as well as any notable villains from the Book of the\nWyrm, Freak Legion and Possessed. There is literally no foe too weak or too strong for\nsome place in the Horde. Storytellers are also encouraged to personalize the different\ncamps of the enemy, however, as opposed to presenting it as simply a giant army on the\nmarch (though it is that as well). Agents of the Defiler Wyrm and Eater-of-Souls might\nact as scouts and spies, enticing foes to join the cause of the Horde or subverting their\nefforts at a critical moment. Minions of the Beast-of-War press hapless innocents into the\nranks of the damned or conduct hideous “live-fire” training exercises with their prisoners.\nA faceless army of evil is frightening, but not engaging on an individual level. A\nnightmarish legion headed by some of the characters’ worst enemies is at once epic and\npersonal, the best sort of storytelling for the End Times.\nHuman governments and military oppose the Horde as it advances on caerns,\nhowever unwittingly, but they fail to stop it. Indeed, the Horde absorbs many of the\ntroops arrayed against it in the process. The chaos and devastation that the Horde’s\nbirth and movement causes is secondary, however. The Horde intends to seek out\nGaia’s Defenders, the Garou, and destroy them.\nTHE BATTLES OF THE APOCALYPSE\nThe Wyrm’s Horde erupting onto the Earth ends all semblance of normalcy. No\none can continue to pretend that this is merely a natural disaster. Gaia’s remaining\nchildren now form a Gaian Host to oppose the Wyrm on the Battlefields of the\nApocalypse. The Garou can maneuver to sites near the Wyrm’s Hosts, attempting\nto take the offensive, or they can position themselves around caerns and kin, and\nallow the enemy to come to them. Where exactly the characters wind up during this\nphase of the conflict is up to them and the Storyteller.\nAlmost any place could be a battleground, but the Garou armies form up at places that\nare important to them, to humans or to the spirits. The Fall has killed many humans, but\nenough humans and Garou remain alive that the Wyrm has not yet won. As long as the\nGarou remain viable, even in the Umbra, they could always return and destroy the Wyrm’s\ncontrol of the ruined Earth.

It might even be their own caern. This is\nhighly recommended for maximum dramatic impact, although if their own caern has\nalready been destroyed during the scenario, a suitably famous or important caern will\nalso suffice. Alternatively, the Storyteller could choose to have one caern remaining,\nperiod. While that choice might threaten to overshadow the players’ characters as they\nbecome part of a host of remaining Garou fighting thousands of Wyrm creatures, it has\nits own dramatic potential for a “last stand” of the Garou Nation. As written, however,\nthis scene assumes that the characters’ own caern is under siege.\nWherever and whatever the caern is, it will be the last one the characters must\ndefend. Soon after they have arrived, urgent word comes from beyond that the\nWyrm’s forces have surrounded the last surviving caerns and are readying their final\ncharge. While this means that the Horde’s forces have been spread thinner than\nusual, it also means that there will be nowhere to run if they fail and no help coming\nfrom the outside. The players must hold the caern on their own against an army\ndestined to bring about no less than the end of the world.\nFortunately, the characters have a few advantages. First, they are on their home\nterritory, and they should have at least enough time to make some plans that take\nadvantage of that fact. Second, the Horde must attack the caern directly rather than\nuse weapons of mass destruction. They might seek to capture important characters,\nrecover valuable fetishes (especially Shards) for corruption to the Wyrm or any other\nreason the Storyteller devises, but in the end, it limits their use of large-scale\nweapons. Lastly, in response to the last-ditch nature of the conflict, the caern\nresponds with a flood of Gaian energies, essentially becoming a level-five caern for\nthe duration of the battle. (If it was already such a powerful caern, suitably powerful\nspirits appear to aid the Garou during their final hour.)\nThis is not to say that it will be an easy battle, however, or even just one battle\nat all. Early reports of enemy numbers are grim, and the Storyteller should see to it\nthat the enemies represented are of types particularly suited to the caern’s destruc-\ntion. (The Horde did send forces for this specific purpose, after all.) Likewise, while\narms and tactics vary from place to place, the Fall has made many weapons widely\navailable, and Garou should expect to face gas, grenades and assault rifles loaded\nwith silver. Specifically anti-Garou weapons such as those devised by Pentex should\nbe rare, but still present, likely carried by old enemies of the characters or similar\npowerful foes. At least one or two “probing” attacks are likely to occur as the Horde\ntests the caern’s numbers and defenses, not to mention spying efforts or attempts to\nconvert the defenders to the cause of the Wyrm. Only when the Horde is ready does\nit launch a full-out attack.\nThen the Final Battle begins.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "102\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nNeedless to say, the Storyteller should play up the desperation of this battle as\nmuch as possible. This is the climactic point of the chronicle, if not the actual end of\nthe world. There are no negotiations, no way to make peace. There is no retreat. This\nis the characters’ last stand. Many of the brave Garou, kin and ordinary humans and\nwolves the sept members knew are dead. The spirits they once called friends have been\ncorrupted or destroyed. Cities fall, forests burn, oceans turn to blood. The sky blackens\nwith debris and smoke. Food and fuel run out. Even if all the Wyrm creatures die, the\nsept might not make it. But they have to fight, Garou and kin together.\nAnd that is the true story of the Garou: courage in the face of overwhelming\nodds, an unwillingness to lie down and die even when defeat seems assured.\nBATTLE OR SIEGE?\nOne important question to ask is whether the fight to hold the Last Caern\nwill be a single battle or a protracted siege. Quite simply, the answer is whatever\nyou believe the players will find more entertaining. While some players enjoy\ntrying to figure out the subtleties of siege planning, logistics, establishing\ndefensive positions and so on, others find such mundane details highly tedious.\nBalancing the two extremes is critical to the drama of this last stand. Players\nshould not expect to succeed if all they do is charge blindly into combat without\nplanning, but they also shouldn’t be forced to put many more pins in a map than\nthey find entertaining either.\nAFTERMATH\nAssuming they survive — and that’s a fairly large assumption — the nature of\nthe world the characters encounter upon emerging from the fight for the Last Caern\ndepends on the ending chosen by the Storyteller and achieved by the players. Three\nendings appear here, one for each of the Triat. A fourth ending reflects a more\nmeditative “turning of the wheel” with more open-ended possibilities. While the\nStoryteller will have to choose which ending to use, and whether the chronicle will\ncontinue, these offerings will serve as useful guidelines.\nTHE WYLD’S END\nThe characters find that the impact of Rorg and Luna has caused a mass extinction\n— a “Wonderwork.” Most humans and large animals are dead, along with Garou and\nKin. In fact, the majority of living Garou are probably the survivors of the Final Battle\nthat raged around the world. Human civilization will no longer exist outside a few refuges,\nwhich won’t last forever. Damaged as it is, the world will have returned to nature.\nGaia is alive, though extremely weak. Generations of ritual and sacrifice will\nbarely return her to consciousness, even if the Balance of the Triat is restored and\nmaintained.

Humans steal from, murder and eat each other\nto live, or worse yet, serve the Wyrm-Lords openly for their daily “bread.” If the\ncharacters live to see this horror, make it obvious that this is not simply a “regime\nchange.” It is the death of Gaia, and the corruption of all upon her corpse to the\nservice of hate and filth.\nThis chronicle probably ends with all the characters dying as heroes or refugees.\nMore depressing would be to have them surrender, if the Dark One will have them.\nWhile life as a Wyrm-Lord would never have a dull moment, it would be beyond the\nscope of this chapter.\nStorytellers should be warned to think carefully before using this ending.\nAllowing the characters to triumph in their climactic moment, only to see that their\nefforts ultimately mean nothing, is an extremely harsh twist to spring on them, and\nit might lead to a great deal of dissatisfaction after all the blood and sweat and tears\nthey have endured.

The Beast Courts of the\nOrient, including the Stargazers and other hengeyokai, have long seen time as\ncyclical, and the world as a turning wheel. The end, to some, seems to others to be\nnothing more than another beginning. Perhaps this is a literal change, in which the\ncharacters emerge to find the world entirely different, with few signs of the previous\none anywhere in sight. It might be more metaphorical instead, but in the end, the\nuniverse continues on as it always has.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

What makes it so precious that mages would suffer,\nkill and die for it?\nMost of us muddle along, approaching our finite time on this world with varying\ndegrees of passion, fear, apprehension, generosity and smallmindedness. We are all\ntapestries composed of doubt and desire, selfishness and a higher drive. Each of us is\nthe story of the world we know.\nYet at the same, time, all of these instincts, thoughts, emotions and relation-\nships are contained within us. There is no escape; we have to resolve these paradoxes.\nWhen pain contradicts our desire for comfort, we search for surcease. When\nignorance contradicts our need to know, we learn. That’s no different than what\nmages strive to do. The paradoxes are different, but the motivation is the same. After\neach moment, their stories, like ours, move forward.\nLaws of Ascension is a game about these stories. Mages craft grand tales, taking\nthe universe and weaving it on the looms of their paradigms. Ascension is not the\nend; it is the whole meaning of that story. Mages encounter Paradox when the\nbedrock of their beliefs clashes with the rest of the universe. It’s a continuity\nproblem, a strange leap that makes the story seem less authentic. It calls the meaning\nof the mage’s life into question.\nSo the purpose of Ascension — the purpose of a mage and, some would argue, the\npurpose of our own lives — is to integrate our strange encounters with reality and craft\nthem into a consistent whole. As mages progress, they expand their paradigms to\ninclude new phenomena. Their personal stories open wider windows into the universe.\nWho are they, if they are not that story? That’s where self-actualization,\nmeaning and Ascension come from. The Awakened want to tell a story that\nconfronts all paradoxes — that encompasses the cosmos.\nIt’s a worthy goal for anyone.\nSTORYTELLING THE IMPOSSIBLE\nFive possible paths to Ascension — or Oblivion — have been charted in this chapter,\nfor the Storyteller and the players to use, alter or ignore as they see fit.

Certain Mind, Spirit and Prime Effects\ncan circumvent it; complex scrying spells can detect calm metaphysical spaces.\nFurthermore, mages have identified certain people who can bend the path of the\nstorm to protect themselves. A rare few can even shield other mages. Though the\nStoryteller is free to design her own story behind the Avatar Storm it is (in canonical\nterms) the result of terrible weapons employed by the Technocracy that have\nshattered a number of Avatars mixed with souls of the dead. Feeling the pull of\nAscension approaching, these Avatar shards desperately seek to find hosts so that\nthey can reach enlightenment before it’s too late.\nThis is the reason that passing through the Storm causes so much damage. The\nshards are actually attempting to inhabitthose passing through, clawing at the Avatar\nin residence. As the end approaches, some of their attempts may even succeed,\noccasionally resulting in the bizarre and frightening beings known as the Anakim.\nOf course, many hosts simply die from the strain.\nTHE ROGUE COUNCIL\nTradition mages and some Orphans around the world have begun to receive\nmysterious messages from an entity known as the Sphinx, part of an enigmatic body\nknown as the Rogue Council. These messages appear in countless forms — scrawled\non napkins, sent on DVD, called up as email — but their ultimate message is one of\nresistance and revolution, calling on the Traditions to renew the war against\nmediocrity and seek Ascension. Though few if any characters will ever discover the\ntrue identity of individuals behind the Rogue Council, it is (as a matter of canon)\na collection of the Avatars of former members of the Tradition Council, guided by\na Psychopomp known as the Sphinx.\nNeedless to say, a message from the Rogue Council is an excellent way to introduce\na number of clues (or mysteries) into any scenario, as well as offer guidance if the\ncharacters are truly at a loss. The Rogue Council does not intervene directly, however.\nThat would ruin the free will of those involved, and that goes against its personal goal\nof promoting Ascension. Storytellers might also wish to reinvent the Rogue Council for\ntheir chronicle. (Perhaps the Nephandi corrupted the Avatars, or Control has devised\na devious new strategy to disrupt the Traditions.) Keep in mind that no matter what, the\nRogue Council needs to be untraceable and able to gather information from a wide range\nof sources, and it has to have a compelling motive for communicating with mages. See\nManifesto: Transmissions from the Rogue Council for more on this group.\nTHE PSYCHOPOMPS\nFirst introduced in Manifesto, the Psychopomps (“conductors of souls”) are\nspirits with the power to direct Avatars to specific incarnations. As Ascension\napproaches, these guides act with increasing frequency, trying desperately to sheperd\ntheir charges toward Ascension before all hope of doing so is lost. Their methods are\ndecidedly obscure and indirect — an Avatar cannot be forced to seek Ascension by\na rote series of tasks — and seldom terribly forgiving. While they recognize that the\nmortal shell that houses the Avatar is vital to giving it some direction, they have no\nproblem pushing that flesh to the limit if that is what Ascension requires.

Whether they are cruel taskmasters, benevolent guides or simply enig-\nmatic messengers depends on what the story requires. In no event should the\nPsychopomps take center stage, however, as such action is antithetical to their very\nnature. They might become more direct than ever as Ascension approaches, but that\nis the extent of their involvement.\nYOUR OWN PERSONAL PSYCHOPOMP\nThe Avatar Guide represents the desires of the Avatars in the chronicle. He\nselects when an Avatar will drive a mage to a Seeking, and during Ascension\nplenty of Seekings will be going on. He must know in advance if you have any\nSeekings planned, and if he can initiate spontaneous Seekings. Scout locations\nwith the Avatar Guide and discuss ideas for scenes and settings, addressing how\nyou will handle any required extra characters or represent any magical effects.\nThe race for Ascension can be part of all the scenarios. Avatars feel the\nend approaching and are scared—they have limited time to reach Ascension\nor face Oblivion. Whether the end is due to the Gauntlet closing or the end\nof sentient life on the planet, the race is on. Indeed, the Avatar Guide must\nbecome the monkey on the characters’ backs, urging them to strive to Ascend,\nto better themselves and increase their chances of surviving the events to\ncome. These urges manifest more frequently as the story continues.\nPIECES OF INFINITY\nThe following systems and mechanics are designed to help portray different\naspects of an Ascension scenario, as magic slides out of control, begins to fade away\nor even is extinguished entirely. Also included are mechanics regarding the Anakim,\ntwisted Sleeper victims of the Avatar Storm — or mages who dare to call upon great\npower as the End Times approach.\nREINFORCING CONSENSUS\nAs the Masses move farther from the spiritual aspects of life, magic in all its\nforms becomes harder to use.\nAt the subtlest level, the Domino Effect (Laws of Ascension, pg. 131) increases. Each\ncoincidental effect cast in the same area increases in difficulty by two Traits. Coincidental\nmagic becomes vulgar at four Traits. The Domino effect now bleeds off at only one Trait\nevery two turns. These numbers increase as the story progresses. Eventually, casting more\nthan one Effect in the same area instantly causes the latter Effect to fail, and it might collapse\nthe initial Effect (make a Simple Test). It might even attract a major Paradox Backlash,\nfactoring all the Sphere levels affecting the area into the Paradox Trait total.\nStronger Paradox\nIf you use Paradox decks, increase the number of cards drawn as the Consensus\nsolidifies. At its strongest levels, draw one card per Sphere level used in the Effect,\nor one per Paradox Trait involved in the Backlash.\n• When casting vulgar magic, you gain one additional Paradox Trait (or more),\nas well as the usual one-per-Sphere award.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Ultimately,\nmagic does not work, no matter how much Paradox is risked. Effects simply fail.\nWEAKENING CONSENSUS\nAcceptance of magic, in whatever form, loosens the weave of the Tapestry, and\nmagic is gradually easier to use.\nThe Domino Effect weakens. Effects in the same area increase the Domino\ndifficulty by one Trait on every second subsequent Effect. There is no cap on the\nmodifier, so if you can continue to cast magic as long as you can overcome the\ndifficulty. The difficulty modifier bleeds off at two Traits for each turn spent without\nmagic being cast in the area. Decrease the growth rate of the Domino Effect as the\nConsensus further weakens. At its weakest, there is no Domino Effect, and magic can\nbe cast repeatedly in the area without added difficulty.\nWeaker Paradox\nIf you are using a Paradox deck, reduce the severity of Backlashes on the cards,\nor reduce the incidence of cards being drawn. Backlash effects can be reduced to a\nlevel where only the mage is affected. At this stage, optional Paradox rules could be\ntossed aside, and you could revert to the basic damage system of Paradox. Beyond\nthat, damage reduces further, either in terms of health levels dealt, or by being\nreduced first to lethal, then bashing damage instead. Eventually, there is no Paradox.\n• When casting vulgar magic, you gain one less Paradox Trait than normal,\nwith a minimum of one Trait.\n• Sleepers who are familiar with your paradigm no longer count as witnesses.\n• Vulgar magic incurs half its normal amount of Paradox (rounded down).\n• Botched coincidental Effects grant one less Paradox Trait than normal.\n• Sleepers no longer count as witnesses.\n• All magic is considered coincidental — you gain Paradox only if you botch an Effect.\nA completely free magical world has no Paradox, so anything can happen. With\nthe specter of Paradox gone, mages can twist reality as much as they like. Anything\nthey cosmically screw up is their own problem.\nTHE GAUNTLET\nGreat changes are wrought on the Gauntlet as the End Times re-forge the fabric\nof the Tellurian. While the specific strength of the Gauntlet in any given area will\ndepend on the immediate environment, its history and Storyteller requirements, the\neffects of the changing Gauntlet are wide-reaching. Your Spirit Keeper is going to\nhave a bit of work on her hands keeping track of it.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Some scenarios have their own timeline for this\nphenomenon. The events of Ascension accelerate what has, until now, been a gradual\nprocess. This is reflected in a game by increasing the “Most places” Gauntlet rating (Laws\nof Ascension, pg. 221). The sequence is arbitrary, based on the pace of the story.\nFor example, in a game that meets once a month, or for a network pacing global\nplots, the Gauntlet could thicken at one Trait every three months. If you need it\nfaster or slower for the sake of story, make it so. The maximum Gauntlet rating\nremains 10 Traits. Note: Your metaplot could equally well have a Gauntlet that is\nwinnowed away, reversing the process and decreasing the “Most places” Gauntlet\nrating at your required rate.\nEven if the “Most places” Gauntlet rating reaches that level, there are still areas\nof varying thickness due, in part, to the Avatar Storm. The eventual collapse of the\nGauntlet, if you use that story element, occurs due to a basic physical property —\nfatigue. If you riddle the strongest metal with irregular cracks, and then place it under\ngreat strain in multiple directions, it has to give eventually. Even a 10-Trait Gauntlet\ncollapses under intense metaphysical pressure.\nSHALLOWINGS\nProgressively, the Gauntlet rips due to the continual slicing it receives from the Storm.\nPreviously thin or unstable areas drop to a zero-Trait Gauntlet rating, and the Umbra mixes\nwith the world. Nodes, for example, are usually in thin regions of the Gauntlet, and mystic\nprecautions by the Node’s guardians (if any) normally prevent Shallowings. Shallowings\ncan open anywhere, but they normally do so outside of urban areas, due to the reinforcing\neffect of the Consensus. The duration of these new Shallowings varies, but they appear to\nbe growing longer and more stable. Many grow in size.\nThe Umbra is a reflection of reality. In areas where the Gauntlet reaches 10\nTraits in strength, it has effectively become a cloth draped over the mirror. While\nthe memory of what was once there sustains the reflection for a while, each zone\neventually fades from existence. This gradual fade could be the reason that Umbral\ncreatures are appearing with increasing regularity at Shallowings — they’re crowd-\ning into what little Umbral space remains and spilling out through the cracks.\nAll the threats of the Umbra are just as dangerous as ever. Shallowings allow Umbral\ncreatures to enter the material world. Technocrat characters might be involved in\nbattling or cleaning up after them. The inverse is also possible. Sleepers wandering into\nthe Umbra are ill prepared for what waits within. Those few who do return are likely in\nno condition to relate their adventures, and even if they can, the men with the white\ncuddle-jackets will be happy to listen to them. Additionally, in the “Judgment” scenario,\nSleepers face Avatar shards that thrust Enlightenment upon them.\nTraveling through a Shallowing into the Umbra does not cause Storm damage\n— no Gauntlet, no Storm. Instead shards crowded by a constricting or fading Umbra\nmight actively rush at mages who wander near, drawn by the strength of the Avatar.\nEach scene, at the Storyteller’s discretion, a burst of shards breaks through the\nShallowing, hitting the nearest Awakened target, causing one level of aggravated\ndamage. The mage might be able to predict such a flurry with an Awareness test,\nallowing a few turns of action to avoid the shards. Nearby Sleepers might also be hit\nby shard flurries, possibly Awakening as a result.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

He no longer has a speciality Sphere. All other\naspects of the character remain unaltered.\nNew Advantage: Alien Presence\nThe Psychopomp’s essence is too alien for mages to tame. Anakim cannot be\nsupernaturally compelled with MindorSpirit Effects or by similar powers. Archmaster\nEffects are an exception to this rule, at the Storyteller’s discretion.\nNew Disadvantage: Dedication\nAt any time the Avatar Guide or Storyteller feels the character is not working\ntoward Ascension with his Psychopomp, they can engage the character in a Willpower\nChallenge, with a difficulty based on the character’s lack of diligence. Minor\ndeviations require the Anakim to overcome only three or four Traits. Outright and\nextended avoidance inflicts a nine-Trait difficulty, perhaps more. Failure means that\nthe Psychopomp assumes control for the remainder of the scene. The Avatar is on the\nPsychopomp’s side, so it will not allow the mage to use magic against this effect.\nIf the mage continues to break its agreement with the Psychopomp, it might\nwithdraw its essence and rend the Avatar completely, leaving the mage an insane\ntwisted wreckage of drooling flesh. You have been warned.\nANAKIM ROTES\nYou can use the essence fragment to perform the following Effects. All are\ncast as per the rules for normal rotes, requiring Static Arete Challenges against\na base difficulty of six Traits. These powers are not familiar to the mage, and if\nthe fragment ever leaves his Pattern, he may not use them. The powers come\nstraight from the Psychopomp (being rotes from the Telos Sphere), although\nthey are powered by a mage’s Avatar. Should the Psychopomp feel that the\nactivation of a given power is inappropriate, it will cancel the power, possibly\ninflicting some punishment as well.\nNEW ROTE: HOLY UNION\nAdept Spirit, Disciple Prime, Disciple Mind\nYou call a Psychopomp and ask it to partially possess you with a fragment\nof its essence. Thereafter, you can use a limited version of the spirit’s soul-\nguiding power. It reflexively protects you from the Avatar Storm in its varied\nmanifestations, but it can also incorporate incarnate and disincarnate Avatars.\nSystem:Spiritcalls the Psychopomp from beyond the Horizon, Prime prepares\nyou to assimilate the essence fragment permanently. You can cast the spell without\nPrime, but the duration lasts only one game session. Any corruption effects you gain\nduring this period remain even after the essence is discharged. The fragment is\nactually sentient, so communicating with it telepathically requires Mind.\nThe spell requires 14 Grades of Success to cast permanently (or 10 to last\na single session), plus one per additional subject. As your Avatar balks at the\nalien presence and the Effect is mentally and spiritually taxing, add two Traits\nto the spell’s difficulty. The rote is always vulgar without witness.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Otherwise, you suffer corruption. Storytellers should be aware that\nthe Storm’s primitive consciousness is largely unaware of the suffering it inflicts, but\nliving Avatars certainly oppose attempts to pull them from the path to Ascension.\nControl Avatar Storm: You can adjust the severity of the Avatar Storm in the\nimmediate area by one level of damage, up or down for one minute/conflict. This\npower does not normally attract corruption effects.\nGrades of Success: Each grade adds levels of damage or extends the area or duration.\nAvatar Construct: You can shape the Avatar Storm (if it’s present) into a\nrough form, such as a barrier, weapon or shield. All these forms are invisible to\ncharacters without magical senses, (although Awareness may detect their presence\nand Resonance) and cause damage only to Awakened beings or creations. Unless\nmentioned otherwise, each Effect lasts for only one conflict/minute. This power does\nnot normally inflict corruption effects. Choose one of the following Effects:\n•Shard Blast: You direct a stream of shards at a nearby target, causing one level\nof aggravated damage. Treat this as a normal missile attack. This Effect lasts only a\nsingle action.\n•Weapon: You form a simple weapon that is used as per normal combat rules. It causes\none level of aggravated damage, and it has three Bonus Traits and no Negative Traits.\n• Shield: Similar to a magnetic shield (Laws of Ascension, pg. 204), this small\nbarrier protects against magical damage at up to two Traits per turn, to a maximum\nof 10 total Traits deflected. This Effect expires either when it deflects its last Trait\nof damage or at the end of the minute/conflict.\n• Barrier: A wall of whirling shards protects a small area/room. Susceptible\nsubjects passing through the barrier take one level of aggravated damage, and magic\nEffects attempting to cross the barrier are affected as with the Cocoon.\n• Cocoon: Shards drawn about you distort magic cast at you, opposing the\nmagic with five Traits of Storm-Tainted Resonance. The Cocoon also protects\nagainst similar powers, such as vampiric Thaumaturgy, Psychic Phenomena and\nwerewolf Rites. Static powers such as Dominate or Presence are unaffected.\nGrades of Success: Each grade adds an additional level of damage or an\nadditional target affected, or it extends the duration or range by one grade.\nOverwhelm Sleeping Avatar: You direct the Avatar Storm into a Sleeper with\nsuch intensity that it destroys the Sleeper’s own Avatar and will. You must generate\nmore Grades of Success than the target’s Willpower. Victims become the mage’s\nmindless thralls and eventually mutate to duplicate her physical corruption.\nWhen targeting a supernatural being, you must also generate sufficient Grades\nof Success to exceed the current level of his supernatural power source (Gnosis,\nBlood Traits, Conviction, etc.). If successful, the being loses all of its supernatural\nattributes, leaving it bereft of a soul or spiritual power. Effectively, he becomes a\nmortal minion as his Pattern is violated by the Storm.\nSupernatural creatures and partially Awakened mortals — sorcerers, psychics,\nghouls, etc. — can resist this Effect by expending a permanent Willpower Trait.\nFollowing that expenditure, they cannot ever be targeted by this power again. The\nEffect automatically fails.\nAwakened mages are immune to this Effect, as are the imbued. This power\nalmost always invokes a corruption effect.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Now, we reach the end of that bitter road, to discover why\nAscension and Armageddon are one. In the end, their torment is the key to victory.\nThere are great powers loose in these final days. Voormas. The revealed Rogue\nCouncil. An ancient conspiracy that lies at the root of the Traditions and Technoc-\nracy. But these are not the decisive elements of the story. Your characters will\nultimately decide humanity’s fate.\nUNDER PRESSURE (OPTIONAL RULE)\nIn the rush to Ascend, and if it sees the need, the Avatar pumps the\nPattern of the mage with bursts of inspiration and magic, like hitting a mystic\nnitrous switch. The Avatar grants temporary bursts of raw Quintessence,\nallowing the host to overcome physical hurdles, or it drops pure enlighten-\nment in the mage’s lap so he can get on with more important matters. These\nbursts correspond to matters important to the Avatar, not necessarily the\nmage. Sometimes, the pressure is more than the host can handle.\nThis is not a power that a player can call upon. At the Storyteller or\nAvatar Guide’s discretion, the Avatar grants temporary Arete to the mage,\nwhich can raise her Arete beyond her normal limit, allowing her to use\nstronger magic. Each Trait above that limit either causes one level of\naggravated damage (healed as normal) or inflicts a temporary derangement\nappropriate to the situation. The duration of the boost and any after-effects are\nup to the Storyteller, but all fade by the end of the combat or scene.\nThe Avatar Guide or Storyteller can consider other Trait boosts with\nsimilar results, should the situation require it, such as adding Mental Traits to\nbreak a tie when solving a critical puzzle or granting a Stealth retest during an\nimportant reconnaissance mission. Repeated boosts result in lasting disrup-\ntions to the mage’s Pattern, such as damage that will not heal, reduced\nmaximum Mental Traits or permanent derangements.\nYou might permit characters to undertake Seekings based on the events\nthey just experienced, however, learning why the matter was so important to\nthe Avatar. Allow them to enter Experience debt if necessary, paying for new\nArete with their next few Experience Traits. If this enlightenment takes them\npast their Willpower limit, they cannot use the new Arete Trait until their\nWillpower reaches a suitable level.\nConversely, if the Avatar strongly disagrees with the mage’s forthcoming\nactions, it can attempt to cripple the result. The Avatar Guide initiates a\nSimple Test. Depending on the level of importance to the Avatar, either a win\nor a win-or-tie is required for the mage to resist the Avatar. If the Avatar wins,\nit can interfere in the character’s test to perform its intended action. It can\nrequire a retest or inflict a difficulty penalty up to half the rating of the Avatar.\nIf the Simple Test required a win, the Avatar can require the mage to expend\na temporary Willpower Trait to perform the action.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

That mage carries the Avatar of one of Heylel’s children\nand therefore, half of his mystic secrets — and she’s a member of one of the cabals.\nThe Storyteller should choose one character, portrayed by someone who can play\nout temptation but avoid grandstanding. No special Traits are required, but you\nmight want to use it to justify a high Destiny and foreshadow it in Seekings and other\nstories. This character will be pivotal but not indispensable. In the story, we’ll call\nher (or him; gender is not important) Heylel’s Heir.\nCHAOTIC PROPHECY\nOne sign of the end occurs in the months leading up to our story. Divination\nmagic begins to twist and fail, encountering a cloud of Storm-Tainted Resonance that\nconfuses omens and defeats statistical analysis. Mages can usually foretell their\nimmediate future, but predictions about global events and the fate of magical societies\nbecome confused. In many cases, new visions contradict previous predictions.\nStorytellers should use this fact carefully. Don’t deny players the functional\naspects of Time magic (such as detecting danger or gathering moderate amounts of\nintelligence), but do emphasize that the old rules of causality are being rewritten,\nmaking it difficult to determine the future fate of the world. The one consistent\nelement of them is that everything familiar teeters on the edge of destruction.\nNOT ANOTHER CHOSEN ONE!\nThere are several options for Storytellers who are wary of making one character\nthe center of such an important prophecy. One solution is to simply alter and expand\nthe prophecy so that it includes more characters — perhaps several of the characters\nin the chronicle are reincarnated members of the First Cabal, destined to help unite\nthe Traditions once more. That is just one possible alternative. With some time, an\ninventive Storyteller can devise any number of ways to link a group of characters\n(preferably representing most if not all the cabals in the chronicle) through prophecy.\nDoing so not only makes it less necessary to make sure that one character survives, but\nit also helps balance out the importance of all the characters in the chronicle.\nAnother option is to simply forgo the role of “destined” characters in this\nscenario altogether, or at least downplay their importance to the story. While\nthey might have some important parts to play, so do the other characters.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The Traditions have adapted to the sign of the Sphinx, with some seeing\na call to war and others fearing a coming disaster. The Technocracy eschews the grand\nstrategies of the old Ascension War for street fighting and other bloody conflicts.\nThe characters are called by omens, Rogue Council transmissions and prophetic\ndreams, leading up to a subtle but urgent need to attend no less than a meeting of the\nNew Horizon Council, the current governing body of the Traditions. The Storyteller\nshould feel free to customize, elaborate on and add new signs to augment what follows.\nThe decision to attend the Council meeting should not seem like something the\ncharacters are doing to kill time, but a matter of overwhelming urgency for every cabal.\nTHE DREAMS\nDuring sleep, meditation or a Seeking, Heylel’s Heir dreams. The dream is an\ninfectious one, reaching out to every person with close ties to her — her cabal at least,\nand possibly the rest of the characters as well. The Heir is covered in blood and\nwrapped in a white cloth. A giant looms above her in rich robes, standing three times\nher height, with phoenixes and sphinxes worked in brocade along the collar.\nKnowledgeable characters recognize the robe’s rich, 15th-century cut. The giant’s\nsex is indistinguishable, but it has long, blond hair. Bright twin stars obscure its face.\nThe room has cold, stone floors. Huge tapestries are covered with the sign of the\ncaduceus below a crown: a fusion of common Hermetic and old Solificati symbolism.\nHeylel’s Heir feels exhausted, as if she’s completed a great journey on foot. The other\ndreamers take on their normal self-image but feel like they’re being watched. They sense\nthat the giant is trying to communicate, but the voice seems lost and muted, as though it’s\nspeaking through a room full of babbling voices. Characters with high AwarenessandPrime\nsenses detect voices whispering in the shadows: the Storm-Tainted Resonance associated\nwith the Avatar Storm. No matter what the characters attempt, they cannot communicate\nwith the giant, although it feels more important to do so with each passing attempt.\nPHOENIX PROPHECIES\nA DVD arrives a few days later, stamped with the mark of the Sphinx. As is usual for\na Rogue Council message, there are no arcane connections to any deliverer. It appears\nalongside the rest of a character’s DVDs or in a prominent, mundane place. The DVD has\none track, and showing what appears to be the interrogation of “Phoenix” — a known\nprophet and emissary of the Rogue Council — by two Technocratic agents. She quickly\nturns the tables on her interrogators, however, revealing personal information about them,\ndisabling the security devices placed on her and effortlessly subduing the guards before\nturning and addressing the characters directly, by name. She tells them the following:\n“Go to the Council. Tell Mark that we need two eyes. Three. A thousand. The Ahl-\ni-Batin’s terrible angels are loosed; they won’t be satisfied by a few Awakened spirits.\nTeach them all to see with many eyes! I will see you again, but not in this body. Free\nyourselves. Free the Sleepers. Learn to see. Enigma will take you where dogma cannot.”\nThe video ends there. If you have time to rehearse and prepare, this whole\nsequence can be presented live before the witnessing characters by the storytelling\nteam. You could even create the actual video if you have the resources, so the\ncharacters can review or rewind parts of it for clarity. Such props add an excellent\ndimension to the realism of the chronicle, as well as relieve some of the pressure for the\nNarrators when it comes to remembering exactly what was said or done on the tape.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Storytellers should feel free to\ncustomize the proposed meeting site to suit their chronicle. Perhaps the Council has even\nbeen planning to meet in the characters’ home city for some time, and the dreams and\nomens they have been experiencing only add to the dread that has been building so far.\nIn Session\nUnless they drop in very late at night or early in the morning, the cabals should\nhave about an hour to meet and greet other attendees before the Council sits in session.\nConsors will provide a list of the meeting’s agenda. A number of minor issues are on\nthe table, but the two that stand out are Herald Theora Hetirck’s report on the status\nof the Realm of Entropy and a petition from “a group of mages adhering to the\nprinciples of the so-called Rogue Council Manifesto.” Add any other issues you wish.\nAfter the Councilors announce their names and titles, they move on to\nbusiness. Except for the items detailed here, go through the agenda in any order you\nwish. Use Council protocol to determine how much input the characters have, but\nthey should definitely feel as though they have a voice and aren’t simply there as\nspectators, particularly if they are powerful and respected.\nWhile the Storyteller should allow discussion to flow naturally, three important\npoints must be covered before the meeting is disrupted by the arrival of the Technocracy:\nVoormas Ascendant\nHerald Theora Hetirck, once a servant of the mad archmage Voormas, delivers\na chilling pronouncement: Her former master has nearly assembled the tools\nnecessary to throw the Great Wheel itself off track, ending the Cycle of Death and\nRebirth forever. She knows that Voormas somehow engineered the thinning of the\nGauntlet between the living world and the Underworld, but even as his slave, she\nnever found out how. It’s only a matter of time before the mad archmage attacks. She\nalso knows that Voormas was prepared for the Avatar Storm, and cast certain spells\nto maintain an arcane tie to the Earth and prevent disembodiment. Those who\nattempt to challenge him are ripped apart by the Avatar Storm in seconds, leaving\nthe Traditions with few options if they hope to oppose him. Yet if they do not, it will\nnot be long before reality itself is threatened by his mad scheme.\nPORTRAYING THE COUNCIL\nThe Council is given a set period of time to discuss the day’s agenda, during\nwhich it might ask for comments from the floor. When the time has passed,\nunfinished items are moved to the next session and the floor is open to petitions\nand statements. For all floor remarks, a speakers’ list determines who can talk on\na first-come, first-serve basis. The only exceptions are granted to Heralds, who may\nquestion the Council for points of clarification. Group presentations must be\narranged with the Chancellor pro Tempore’s secretary ahead of time.\nNeedless to say, it is generally best that a number of Narrators be used\nto represent the different Council members, or at least the ones who will\nbe important for this particular meeting. Make sure these Narrators are\nwell briefed on their characters, what they know and what opinions they\nwill have about the topics being discussed.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Represen-\ntatives of this enigmatic body approach and produce the mystical Tenth Seat, to the\namazement of the assembled Councilors. After allowing the Councilors to confirm\nwith whatever magic they feel is necessary that the seat is genuine, the Rogue\nCouncil mages explain that the Seat was recovered during a recent operation in the\nMiddle East following a message from the Sphinx.\nIt seems clear enough to them — the Rogue Council has earned its seat.\nRevelation\nAt some point during the meeting, the truth about the Heir (or whatever prophecy\nis used) should come out, whether due to auspicious use of Time or Entropy magic,\nrecognition by one of the Councilors in attendance, a mysterious pronouncement by one\nof the Emissaries of the Rogue Council. Aside from the personal impact of this revelation,\nit has an important mystical consequence as well. The character(s) will be the ones to\nrediscover the ritual of Holy Union that allows a mage to weather the Avatar Storm,\nabsorb some of the Avatar Shards that compose the storm and guide them to enlighten-\nment. This ritual is extremely dangerous for all who attempt it, but it might be the only\nway to survive the impending disaster, much less achieve Ascension.\nATTACK!\nRevelations regarding the Heir, combined with news of Voormas’ scheme and\nthe appearance of the Tenth Seat finally destroy the assembly’s self-control. Mages\nburst into heated arguments, threaten each other and “step outside” for impromptu\ncertámen bouts. This outside disruption allows a Technocracy task force to deter-\nmine that the Council is in a state of “maximum tactical incoherence,” and it\nprepares to decapitate the leadership of the Traditions with one stroke. Strike teams\nteleport to positions immediately outside at each entrance, with Sleepers covering\nthe HIT Marks as they storm the chantry and take aim at the Councilors.\nAlthough wards prevent teleportation into and out of the location by either side, this\nis not to say that the Councilors or the characters haven’t prepared some contingency plans\nin advance. Mages scatter and try to force their way through the ranks of the Technocrats\nto reach pre-arranged fallback points, springing several prepared Effects on their attackers\nand otherwise demonstrating why they have earned the right to sit on the Council in the\nfirst place. This should be a quick and brutal struggle, forcing the characters to think fast\nand cast faster if they wish to escape. With some good teamwork and planning, however,\nit should be possible for them to escape — injured and frightened, perhaps, but alive.\nDECISIONS\nWhen the smoke clears, the characters and those Councilors who escaped (which\nshould be most if not all of them) convene an emergency session. Bickering is nowhere\nto be seen — the Technocracy assault proved that the Traditions can no longer assume\nthat the Technocracy will leave them alone as it has since the “end” of the Ascension\nWar. In fact, it can be assumed that the opposite is true, and the Pogrom will be reinstated\nwith renewed vigor as the Gauntlet crumbles and the Avatar Storm’s intensity increases.\nTherefore, the Traditions must unite in the face of these threats, escape destruction\nat the hands of the Technocracy, research Holy Union and find some way to confront\nVoormas and put his evil to an end. Mighty tasks, to be sure, but there are no other options\nleft. Due to their prominence and potential, the characters are given positions of special\nimportance to the Council. Some might even become Councilors themselves, if they\nhave sufficient Reputation and magical expertise to be worthy of the honor.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Months pass as the war’s players take their places and begin probing each other’s\ndefenses, seeking a weakness to exploit for ultimate victory. During this time, Storytellers\nshould encourage the players to take their characters through research and small, personal\nstories, so that the tremendous conflict to come seems mightier by contrast.\nRemember that successful Seekings — not to mention a great deal of mundane and\narcane research — will be necessary before characters are able discover the truths of Holy\nUnion, much less empower themselves with it. Give the characters plenty of time for this,\nbut don’t let them rest easily. Just finding the proper texts and tools necessary to master\nthis ritual can be the subject of several challenging sessions, and actually attempting it\nfor the first time should be a cause for great worry as well as celebration. Nevertheless,\neventually they will succeed, or the rest of the scenario is written in vain.\nTHE FLOOD OF SOULS\nAt Voormas’ direction, the Avatar Storm grinds inexorably into the Gauntlet.\nGlobally, Gauntlet ratings drop by one Trait per month. If a regional Gauntlet was\nalready rated at one Trait to begin with, a new Shallowing forms, but local Gauntlets\nrated at two or more before the event leave a last, fragile wall between worlds. For\nTradition mages, this is an unexpected boon; for the Technocracy, it’s a nightmare.\nTechnocrats battle new hauntings and possessions around the world. The Pogrom kicks\ninto high gear, as new recruits and funding are poured into seizing Nodes and Shallowings.\nWAR COUNCIL\nAt some point, the characters should gather mages to renew Tradition unity and\nshare the secret of Holy Union. Only they have the means to do so. Unless the characters\nstep up to help the Traditions, the Traditions will fall. The Technocracy and the Storm\nwill destroy them. The Traditions are scattered in the aftermath of the Council attack,\nbut provided a suitable location can be secured and the word can be spread of the meeting,\nthe characters will find many influential mages coming from around the world to attend.\nWhen they arrive, it’s up to the characters to find a political solution. There are\nmany ways to do this, from sincerity and honesty to subterfuge and backroom deals.\nUnless the characters do something truly atrocious, though, the mere fact that they\nhave uncovered Holy Union combined with their prophesied status should be\nenough to swing the majority of those present to their side.\nOnce some semblance of Tradition unity has been forged, the characters can\nbegin discussing the immediate problems. It soon becomes obvious that the Technoc-\nracy is less the prime threat, than the weakening of the Gauntlet. Rumors point to\narmies of Marauders, Nephandi or even stranger things massing at the edges of reality,\nwaiting to fight their way in. Indeed, in the face of such horrors, the Traditions must\nconsider the once-unthinkable: asking the Technocracy to help save the world.\nConvincing the Technocrats will be difficult, at the very least. The Union is in a\nconstant state of red alert, and it will view any attempt at contact by Tradition members\n— particularly such powerful and well-known Reality Deviants as the characters — with\ndeep suspicion, if not outright hostility. Storytellers should present the characters with\na number of difficult challenges, from locating the hidden base of a high-level Techno-\ncratic commander to researching an argument he might believe to defeating elaborate\nsecurity measures to gain access to the facility.

Ultimately, the characters have a compelling\nargument, but will that be enough for these old enemies to see the light?\nIf all goes well, the last vestiges of the Ascension War end… but Ascension itself\nwill require one final quest.\nWANDERING STARS\nIf the characters manage to avert total war, the Traditions and Technocracy\nbury their dead, repair their strongholds and guide the thousands of Storm-\nAwakened mages. A month after the end of the war, a tenth of humanity throws off\nSleep — and the numbers still rise. Nations either stand on the threshold of collapse\nor have fallen into desperate anarchy. Surviving Sleepers distrust the Awakened,\nand the Consensus grows weaker and less predictable on a daily basis.\nAfter much struggle and hard work, however, the Avatar Storm begins to wane.\nMages with Holy Union and Sleepers weaken it when they host Avatar shards. But\neven fairly inexperienced mages sense that this is only a brief respite at best. If\nsomething isn’t done about the great disturbance in the Underworld, and soon, the\nStorm will simply propagate endlessly until all is lost.\nTHE SPHINX\nAs the Avatar Storm loses strength, the last Rogue Council transmission\narrives. Each character receives it in the language and medium he favors. In all\nmanifestations, it bears the sign of the Sphinx. It says:\nThank you for your trust. Will you trust us one more time?\nWhen the characters finish reading, Dante, the Oracle of Correspondence, is there with\nthem all, even if it entails being many places at once. As an Oracle, it’s a part of his nature.\nTHE SHATTERED DARK\nAfter explaining what they know about the Avatar Storm and congratulating\nthe characters on putting out the last fires of the Ascension War (if that is the case),\nthe Rogue Council asks a final, terrible question: Will the mages go to oppose\nVoormas? They cannot compel the characters for the same reason they can’t simply\ndo it themselves: Direct intervention would destroy the value of free will. They can\nonly communicate and advise. If they do any more, humanity’s choices become\nmeaningless. Such is the nature of judgment.\nIf the characters refuse to oppose Voormas at this point, the rest is simple, if\nexceedingly horrifying. The ritual completed, reality unravels into an agonizing\neternal state of simultaneous life and anti-life, banishing all thought of Ascension\nforever. If the characters choose to go, though, they have time to say their final good-\nbyes, then a portal is opened into the Deep Umbra that will take them to the dark\nand entropic Realm of Castle Helekar.\nReality is falling apart, and they are heading right to the source.\nDOOM\nThis is the last battle for reality. The characters fight it as they wish, but each\nchoice they make has consequences. It should be without question the most difficult\nand terrifying battle they have ever faced, and the Storyteller should spare no effort\nto convey the grim nature of the realm, the howling hordes at Voormas’ command\nor the terrible fury of the mad archmage himself. Their victory is far from assured.\nIn fact, even armed with Holy Union and as many other powers and items as they can\ncarry, the characters should still feel as though the odds are against them.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Before\nthe characters even reach the archmage, the Storyteller is pretty much free to put a\nhorde of any type of enemy imaginable in their path, favoring ones on the entropic\nend of the scale when possible. Hungry ghosts, corrupted mages, foul shapeshifters,\nwicked spirits, hideous aliens, even fierce Hobgoblins created from Voormas’ own\nextended Quiet all assail the characters, requiring a great deal of their power and\ncourage to overcome before they can face the master at the heart of this evil place.\nVoormas himself isn’t subtle. The archmage musters as much magic as he can\nspare to kill or repulse the characters as soon as he notices their presence. Naturally,\nEntropy is his most common Sphere of attack, though Mind and Matter are close,\nespecially if he is trying to keep his foes off guard. If he senses a weakness, he destroys\na character in as horrific a manner as he can fashion, all the while claiming that his\ncause is just. He wants nothing more than to create a world where humanity isn’t\nchained to karma or death — a vision of Ascension.\nIf the characters fail, events play out as described previously. If they succeed,\nthey have achieved the greatest victory of all time.\nASCENSION\nThese are the final moments of the universe.\nAll the barriers are broken; the Outer and Inner Horizon dissolve before the\nracing fragments of the One, questing for human hosts. This is the last tide of\nAwakening. At last, on the broken Earth, everyone is a miracle-worker.\nThe Awakened create wonders and destroy monuments. Cities are raised from\nthe dust, then sundered in the birth pangs of power remembered, but everyone was\nAsleep once. Most people remember the humility and compassion of mortal days.\nThe last miracles are not born of fire and water. Progenitors heal shamans who bear\nwounds from their common war with Marauders.

For\nvisionaries who challenged the very limits of reality, other dimensions beyond human\nperception had once offered limitless adventure.

Void Engineers sometimes call it a\n“Dimensional Barrier,” even though they cannot quantify exactly how it functions.\nShould this barrier fall completely, the threshold that separates the relatively safe world\nof Earth from myriad alien alternatives would be eradicated. Science would hold no\nmeaning; sanity would be irrelevant without a common frame of reference; forces beyond\nspace and time could descend upon the helpless populace of Earth in one rapacious feast.\nThis scenario details a brutal covert struggle in the Technocratic ranks\nbetween two emerging factions: the Loyalists, who seek total control over the\nworld through the annihilation of all magic save their own technomancy, and the\nUnionists, who seek to guide humanity to greatness through Enlightened Science,\nexperimentation and exploration.\nPHASE ONE\nAt the start of Phase One, a dedicated team of Void Engineers issues a warning to\nany amalgam that will listen: Patrols have detected an increase in supernatural\nphenomena. Extradimensional entities — or “spirits,” as some would call them — have\nbroken through the Dimensional Barrier. Such entities occasionally manifest in our\nworld, but these new sightings do not correspond to previously encountered phenomena.\nIn game terms, most of these locations are areas where the Gauntlet rating is low.\nA few sites, however, do not fit this pattern. Instead, they are moderately or highly\npopulated areas. It is as though the spirits are searching for something… or someone.\nTeams then scramble to figure out what they’re looking for, but not before innocent\nSleepers begin to disappear, and innocent witnesses see things they couldn’t possibly\nimagine. This phase should focus on the emerging mysteries of the Avatar Storm, while\nsowing the seeds for the schism between fanatical Loyalists and visionary Unionists.\nAnomalies: An increase in sightings of paranormal phenomena quickly leads to\nactive investigations. Tracking down “extradimensional incursions” becomes the\nmost common mission for collaborative amalgams. Talented teams of agents\n(including your characters) should have the authority to conduct one of these\ninvestigations on their own.\nNew Propaganda: On the Horizon, a group of academics within the Ivory Tower\nsoon posits a new theory that this Dimensional Barrier was strengthened by the Order\nof Reason. Propaganda insists that the Technocracy has abandoned the original ideals\nof the Order, which has led to the current course of events. Furthermore, revised\nhistory insists that the Order was established to protect the Masses from supernatural\nforces, including extradimensional activity and sudden “primal storms.” Radical\nintellectuals try to broadcast this propaganda to the front lines, with mixed results.\nLockdowns: In response to the deadliest and most frightening incursions, teams\nof Void Engineer Dimensional Scientists mobilize to areas where the barrier between\nworlds has given way, accompanied by marines from this Convention. In teams of\nfive or 10 agents, they’re sent through these rifts to patrol for further incursions.\nCasualties are high as the Avatar Storm responds. Most teams are left with one or\ntwo agents who aren’t seriously wounded.\nPHASE TWO\nAt some point in this section or even near the end of Phase One, Control ceases\nall transmissions.

Independent supervisors\nrespond by forming their own battle plans… until the Horizon Constructs interrupt\nwith their own detailed and frequent directives.\nThis phase should further probe the loyalties of the different operatives and\namalgams. If it wasn’t obvious before that a power struggle is taking place in the\nhigher levels of the hierarchy, it should be now, though not necessarily who is\ninvolved and why. As they struggle to cope with increasingly dangerous and\nunpredictable anomalies, agents must begin to watch what they say and do. Control\nis always watching, but who is watching Control?\nA Shift in Power: Eventually, Masters and Managers on the Horizon resume\nbroadcasts as if the Avatar Storm never happened. Agents in any amalgam will suddenly\nfind themselves reporting to higher authorities. If they were performing missions for an\nIvory Tower Supervisor, they soon receive broadcasts from a Manager one rank higher.\nProgenitors sequestered in laboratories might suddenly lose their funding and be sent to\nsupport amalgams in distant cities. Cyborgs receive downloads from sources with which\nthey were previously unfamiliar, and Syndicate reps must contend with a “corporate\nreorg,” forcing them to give detailed reports to managers they have never heard of.\nHorizon immediately asserts its authority… and disgruntled front-line agents do their\nbest to hide any signs of dissatisfaction. The chain of command is re-forged.\nTracking the Anakim: A few of the more unusual dossiers concern theories of an\nalien invasion. A standard background dossier relates publicly known rumors regard-\ning alien abductions, events in Roswell and legendary Men in Black questioning\nwitnesses of such events. Citizens interrogated after various lockdowns have related a\nvast amount of barely credible evidence of what they have encountered. Investigations\ninto this latest “invasion,” on the other hand, can be traced to testimony given by Men\nin Black. A disturbing picture begins to emerge during this stage: It is possible that the\nAvatar Storm is not merely a dimensional phenomena, but that it has begun to\nsomehow empower individuals into Awakening — often with devastating results.\nNew Cults, New Gods: As rifts open in the Dimensional Barrier, extra-\ndimensional forces reach out for weak minds on Earth. Some gather humans with\nmagical potential, bringing them together through dreams and visions to remote and\nunwatched corners of the Earth. Avatar shards awaken such initiates, and revela-\ntions from outside reality guide them to perform rites of summoning. Marauders,\nNephandi or even demons act as the shadowy leaders of these cults. Whatever the\nmotivation is, they are united in perverting these rifts in the Gauntlet. It should not\nbe difficult to spare a few amalgams to seek out one of these new cults and investigate.\nThe Schism Widens: Faced with many failed missions during this stage, mid-\nlevel agents begin to disregard broad and draconian policies sent from the Horizon.\nRank-Three Technocrats — such as Progenitor Research Associates, It-X Pro-\ngrammers, Ivory Tower Intelligence Analysts, Syndicate Chairmen and Void\nEngineer Commanders — continue to direct agents in the field, but they fail to\nreport everything they find to their superiors. As a result, Horizon Managers file\nreports of insubordination against independent Managers… but they cannot send\ntroops down from Horizon to capture and retrieve them for psychological evalu-\nation and social conditioning. It is a stalemate, at least until something happens\nto knock a few pieces off the chessboard.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The\nLoyalists who have assumed control in the Horizon Constructs see it as no less than\na terminal event and seek to clamp down hard on reality in response, but more\nopen-minded Unionists are slower to judge this new phenomenon. They seek\nfurther understanding of it before acting.\nOn the front lines, agents communicating with their contemporaries begin to refer\nto these manifestations as “shards” or “quantum shards.” Independent Technocrats —\nas well as deviant technomancers, Etherites and Virtual Adepts — need a common term\nfor them as well. They make analogies to “dark matter.” Reality Deviants would go so far\nas to call them “Avatar shards,” but that description implies a spiritual, soulful or even\nintelligent component to this activity. Further analysis is required.\nPogrom Restored: Early analysis confirms that “quantum shards,” like the\nextradimensional entities that arrived before them, seek out individuals with\nparanormal or psychic potential. Recent statistical analysis (including high-pow-\nered procedures attempted on the Horizon) suggests that some of these “contactees”\nhave the potential to become Technocrats themselves… or deviant mages. Loyalists\nissue orders that those contacted by the shards or exposed to dark matter are to be\ncontained and examined.\nDark Matter: Unionists begin to witness firsthand what this newly discovered\ndark matter can do to unprepared victims. As these initiates attempt to understand\ntheir deviant abilities, the number of Paradox Backlashes in the world increases. In\nsevere cases, shards seek out victims of Paradox and punish them with the same\nvirulence as the Avatar Storm — by now referred to as “Dimensional Storms” within\nthe Union. Even the subtle workings of Technocratic operatives become vulnerable\nto these unpredictable surges, leading to the destruction of many incautious agents.\nRace Against Time: Independent amalgams are pursuing methods of containing\ndark matter. They can do so only by innovating new applications of Enlightened\nScience and contravening established procedures. To survive this new manifesta-\ntion of the Dimensional Storm, they must find a way to isolate, contain and protect\nthemselves before Loyalist Technocrats discover their activities. If an amalgam can\nfigure out how to survive an encounter with Avatar Shards, or even manipulate\nthem, it will have a significant edge later in this timeline.\nPHASE FOUR\nAs Avatar Shards have worn away the Gauntlet, these razors of primal energy\nhave torn rifts in the barrier between worlds, allowing spirits to manifest in the\nphysical world. Therefore, mages (and Technocrats) trapped beyond the Horizon\nthat have become disembodied can also find new ways back into the physical world.\nMuch of Phase Four deals with the consequences of this change, as the realms of spirit\nand matter come ever closer together. Containing the shifts in reality caused by this\nphenomenon can easily be the focus of several sessions as the characters hunt down\ntroublesome embodied entities and repair breaches in the dimensional fabric.\nFrom a political perspective, this new revelation allows Loyalists to send\nreinforcements from the Horizon to enforce their ideals.

While overt conflict is still some time off,\nthe characters might find themselves forced to choose sides soon — or face\nincreasingly dire consequences.\nSecuring Reality: Forces on the Horizon do not traffic in mysticism and archaic\nphilosophies. High-level Managers on the Horizon choose the Technocracy’s one\nprimary objective during Phase Four: securing the Earth. For all the various theories\nof dark matter and quantum shards, it is clear that overt acts of magic, like blatant\nacts of Enlightened Science, endanger not only the people who practice them, but\ninnocents around them as well. The Loyalists’ final Time Table is then unified in one\npurpose: creating a world where only subtle acts of Enlightened Science work. If\ninnocent lives must be lost in this campaign, so be it — all of reality is at stake.\nReinforcements Arrive: Aligned in purpose, Horizon Constructs send troops\ndown to the front lines in one final push for the War for Reality. Rogue agents —\nalmost certainly including at least a few of the more openly Unionist characters —\nare targeted for assassination or even outright hunted by Loyalist forces. Reality\nDeviants are eliminated. Hidden chantries and headquarters for rogue cells are\ndestroyed after their locations are confirmed by surveillance and interrogation.\nStrengthened by reinforcements, Loyalist forces begin hunting “deviants” and\n“traitors” in their own organization, readying for their endgame.\nPHASE FIVE\nA sudden, massive assault from the Loyalists on deviants and Unionist strong-\nholds rapidly alters the landscape of reality. Surprise attacks lead to massive\ncasualties, as chantries and safe houses alike are compromised. Horizon has been\nwaiting and watching, preparing for a final push in a renewed Ascension War.\nFrightened by the increasingly frequent attacks from extradimensional beings, an\nincreasing number of Sleepers have also begun to fall in with the Loyalists, with\neverything from disorganized mobs to disciplined military forces attacking select\nsupernatural targets around the world. If enough major victories are scored, the War\nfor Reality may soon be over.\nOne amalgam could easily pursue a series of missions against this background of\nshifting realities. If the characters have been willing to defend the common populace\nagainst the Loyalists, the wave of attacks at the end of Phase Four has probably\nhammered their morale. Such devotion can then be rewarded by moral support from\nbeyond the Horizon when the chronicle is at its darkest moment. One transmission\nfrom Control, through as simple an apparatus as a radio, telephone or television set,\nwould confirm that they are not alone in the revolution. In fact, Control could offer\nthem direction just as it seems the conflict with the Loyalists is drawing to a close.\nTransmissions from Control: Control resumes its transmissions at the start of\nPhase Five. It seeks out scattered survivors of the Loyalists’ massive attack, attempt-\ning to unify them in the defense of humanity. The goal is not to isolate a\nself-sufficient Technocracy in a new Ivory Tower on the Horizon. The goal is a far\nolder one: to make humans masters of their own world. The society they started has\nbecome corrupt. Unable to control the Masters who have taken their place, they will\nassist the revolution to destroy the Technocracy’s Loyalist overlords.\nAfter extensive discussions in briefing rooms and rogue Technocrat bunkers, two\nsolutions emerge.

The second is to “open the floodgates,” using Dimensional Science to\ntear open rifts in the Gauntlet at key locations. Doing so would be catastrophic in those\nkey areas, but it would theoretically keep the shards from continuing to wear down the\nDimensional Barrier. If Avatar shards can now silence (or slaughter) mages, they may\ntheoretically purge (or destroy) all magic in the areas where they are channeled.\nPogrom Restored: At this stage, the Pogrom against Tradition mages resumes, but\nTechnocracy agents aren’t the only ones who are hunting them. Fearful of the existence\nof the supernatural, local authorities and government agencies should also act against\nTradition mages. Mages are mortal, after all, so mundane authorities can alter their lives\nwithout having to alter reality. As mankind scores victories against magical forces,\nConsensus should shift against overt and archaic applications of magic. Occasionally,\nTechnocracy agents also hunt particularly dangerous mages during this time, but\ngenerally speaking, it can focus on greater threats… including rival Technocrats.\nThe Storm-Enhanced: Avatar Shards have bestowed great power to Sleepers who\nwere destined to become mages… and possibly even destined to play a role in\nArmageddon. Some survivors have been recruited (or hunted and abducted), but many\nof these initiates — the last generation of mages — will eventually destroy themselves\ntrying to marshal forces they cannot understand. Without Technocracy indoctrination\nor Tradition training, they have the power to summon up forces they cannot put down.\nAt the end of Phase Five, Control broadcasts a warning about the critical mass\nof Avatar shards building around the world. Unless its energy is channeled, the wave\nof extradimensional forces will build until it washes over the Earth, obliterating the\nDimensional Barrier. Whether this event will heal the world or destroy it is a matter\nof great debate. As a result, Unionists and Loyalists race for solutions to this\nproblem… each acting for their own advantage.\nPHASE SIX: ENDGAME\nOn the final day of this timeline, one final wave of reinforcements breaks\nthrough the Horizon: the first real tempest of Avatar shards in the physical world.\nIn the location where this final invasion takes place, the result is an Avatar Storm\nso virulent that it purges its Awakened (or Enlightened) victims of their Arete. (In\ngame terms, it first inflicts aggravated damage as though the victim had passed\nthrough the Gauntlet, then triggers a Paradox Backlash, and then erases the victim’s\nArete.) It doesn’t remove all magic from the world, but it cripples its victims\nsufficiently to end this conflict.\nWith the Technocracy rapidly fragmenting, Loyalists and Unionists contest to\nbe the first to invoke this “final solution” before someone else beats them to the\npunch. If one faction can find a way to survive this storm, or direct it against its\nenemies first, it could act as a “doomsday weapon” in the War for Reality. The world\nis now a chessboard with two opponents — the Unionists and Loyalists — and the\nfirst one to achieve checkmate can finally “control” reality unopposed.\nLaunching the Revolution: At the start of Phase Six, a scientist (or supervisor)\nwho has found a way to exploit the Avatar Storm contacts the characters. He gives\nthem the knowledge they need to open the gates, close the gates or shield\nEnlightened agents from the Avatar Storm. With this head start, the characters must\nchoose what to do with this deadly knowledge. If they’ve been given orders and can\npull off their objective before their enemies do, they will tip the balance in this\nendgame.

Phase Six is a race against time. Four major outcomes are possible:\nLoyalty Triumphs: If the Loyalists “win,” all alternatives to their vision for reality are\nweakened on Earth. The dominant variant of “magic” left is technomancy — coinciden-\ntal applications of technological magic, as developed on the Horizon. Any act of magic\nthat appears openly supernatural summons further Avatar shards. Since the Loyalists\ncontrol the only functional variant of “magic” on Earth, they reassert their control as the\nsecret masters of the world. This could lead to a denouement in which we see what the\nworld is like in a few years… in a dystopia under one absolute Technocracy.\nHumanity United: If the Unionists open their gates first, the Horizon Constructs\nare purged. A chain reaction weakens the network, as the front-line agents free\nthemselves from the oversight of their Masters. Unable to cope with the fact that an\noverwhelming supernatural act is occurring, loyalist Technocrats go insane or into\nQuiet, or they simply expire in a final Paradox Backlash. The storm then cuts off\nsources of Quintessence in the world, extinguishing the energy needed to sustain a\nnetwork of Horizon Constructs. Magic weakens, but the Unionists survive.\nSurvival: In theory, if the technomancers can devise a defense against Avatar\nshards — perhaps by watching and learning from the Anakim, adapting Dimensional\nScience, or even following a procedure detailed by Control — they can survive this\nfinal wave of the Avatar Storm, perhaps even rebuild a new Order of Reason. While\nthis “last mage standing” ending is rather brutal, it might be the only hope if the\nLoyalists have made more overt forms of resistance impossible.\nEverybody Dies: If no one “wins,” and neither side opens a gate to channel this\nworldwide energy, the Dimensional Barrier eventually falls on its own. The resulting\nstorm actually flays all souls in its path, and every mage and Technocrat on Earth is purged\nas the spirit world floods into the physical world. The only Enlightened survivors are then\nthe colonies and a handful of mages and Technocrats on Seekings. Perhaps the characters\nescape on a Void Engineer starship toward a resolution in another realm. They could\nappear before representatives of Control, escape to a Technocracy colony or attempt a\nfinal Seeking on the Far Horizon… one that leads to Ascension or utter annihilation.\nDENOUEMENT\nThe Earth could be reclaimed by the defenders of old ideals; it could be transformed\nin a dystopia ruled by the Loyalists; it could even be purged of all magic, becoming a realm\nwhere even technomancy ceases to function. You must decide which outcome best suits\nyour chronicle… and which side the characters are on when the revolution ends.\nUnfolding this story, act by act, is like broadcasting the final season of a\ntelevision program, one that’s been running for years. Humanity will be watching,\nof course, even if the Masses don’t understand the real significance of what is\noccurring. In a final surrender to technology, the most hopeless citizens will observe\nthese historical events with passive acceptance. Experts enlisted by mass media will\nrationalize what they cannot understand. The revolution will be televised — but\neven during Armageddon, only the Enlightened will see the truth behind the\napocalyptic events.\nThis is the Technocracy, signing off.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

In the World of\nDarkness, it isn’t unusual for players and Storytellers to consider that even the most\nheinous acts occur without the common man on the street taking notice.\nIn this scenario, the population of Earth is losing Avatars one by one. Two\ncompeting alien factions are capturing mages and stripping away their Avatars, each\nfaction doing so for its own reasons. These secret thefts of humanity’s spiritual shards\nof Prime have been going on for some time, but now they are happening with\nunprecedented frequency and purpose. The very fabric of magic in the universe is\nbeing unraveled one thread at a time, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that\nit is being spun onto a new spindle held elsewhere.\nOf course this is occurring beyond the public eye, except perhaps in media\nvenues traditionally perceived as fraudulent or absurd. The end of the magical world\napproaches steadily and quietly. This is a very bleak scenario in many ways, and\nStorytellers should consider its implications before running it with their troupe.\nWhile succeeding only to still fail (at least in part) is a very dramatic theme, it might\nnot be suited for all chronicles or all players.\nTHEY ARE HERE\nTwo obscure groups of radicals have turned up evidence of something bigger\nthan anything paranoid intelligence officers or quixotic UFO nuts ever imagined.\nUnfortunately, the two factions distrust each other, and neither is likely to ever\nsolve the puzzle without certain pieces held by their rivals. Blinded by an\nunbending scientific viewpoint, they would be unlikely to see the truth even if\nthey were to work together.\nTHE STAR COUNCIL\nThe first of these two organizations is the Star Council, a gathering of eccentric\nintellectuals who share beliefs and studies of UFOs. Numbering less than 50, the Star\nCouncil would likely have faded away when the ’60s ended, had it not made a\nremarkable discovery. Following the trail of reported sightings and cracked govern-\nment files, a handful of members of the Council managed to break into a restricted\nhangar in Area 51 in 1969. They made off with ultratech devices of both Techno-\ncratic and alien origin and have been studying them ever since. The pillaging of the\nfamed Technocratic Node has earned the group the unwanted attention of the\nUnion, and only inherent paranoia, unconventional tactics and occasional amazing\nbreakthroughs with the stolen devices have kept the members from capture.\nNO SORCERERS\nThe Star Council and the Thal’hun are sorcerers — also called linear\nmages or hedge mages by various supplements for the World of Darkness. Laws\nof the Hunt contains rules for sorcerers as well as information on the Star\nCouncil. More detailed information on the subject as well as a profile of the\nThal’hun can be found in World of Darkness: Sorcerer. If you do not desire\nto use sorcerers, you can easily present the two groups as independent, but\nsimilar, to the Sons of Ether or Virtual Adepts. Just substitute foci related to\ntheir UFO/alien-studies paradigm and plan their use of rotes accordingly.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The Thal’hun believe that an\nancient race of aliens advanced so greatly in science that they were like unto gods,\nbut their world was destroyed in a terrible plague. This race, which they call Hui:xa,\nsupposedly spread across the universe, hoping to discover those with whom it could\nshare its enlightened science and rebuild its greatest city once again.\nAccording to the Thal’hun, the science of the Hui:xa transcended the physical\nand could be transmitted through the sounds of their special linguistics. They claimed\nto be in contact with the entity Khuvon, who descended to the Earth somewhere in\nMesopotamia thousands of years ago and has made itself responsible for “safeguarding”\nthe essences of divine god-beings in transition between planes. All of this might seem\nquite preposterous were it not for the fact that the Thal’hun can indeed muster their\nown sorcerous effects, not to mention the fact that the expedition they convinced the\nStar Council to send to the Middle East was destroyed by unknown forces.\nEARLY WARNING\nThe first true signs that something is wrong begin to manifest early on in this scenario.\nMagic becomes more difficult and the players likely have little or no idea why — yet. Plant\nsome mysterious seeds of what is happening in the news and rumors they hear from fellow\nTradition members. A rash of strange abductions, whispers of strange beings from beyond\nthe Gauntlet and other “alien” phenomena begin cropping up more and more often. A\nfriend of one cabal might be one of the ones to disappear, or a close ally hear rumors of a\nstrange cult bent on “harvesting” willworkers and others with strong Avatars.\nWork the names of the Star Council and the Thal’hun in gradually and from\na number of sources, letting the players put together the pieces. Try to give as many\nof the cabals a common cause to investigate as possible before moving on, without\nbeing too obvious about drawing them all in. Once the characters are interested,\nenough leads pile up to lead them to the local headquarters of the various groups, as\noutlined in the next phase of this scenario.\nOUT THERE\nThis stage does not follow a linear timeline, but rather is left open for the players\nto investigate as they see fit. Indeed, it’s likely that one cabal might consider it a priority\nMAGIC ALTERATION\nAs this scenario goes forward, the pattern of the Tapestry tightens, its\nmystical weaving becomes a bit threadbare, and magic becomes noticeably harder\nto perform. For each stage of this scenario, add one to the difficulty of all tests to\nperform magic. For stages three through five, subtract one extra Grade of Success\nper casting, and reduce the ratings of all supernatural Nodes, Backgrounds, Merits\nand Flaws by one Trait. (If reduced to zero, the Trait vanishes utterly.) The\nGauntlet strengthens as well, becoming essentially impassable by the end of the\nscenario. All of these effects are cumulative. In addition, the Storyteller may also\ninclude other complications such as cameras and other devices counting as\n“witnesses” for the purposes of vulgar magic, require additional Quintessence\nTraits to activate Wonders and so on. It should be serious enough that the\ncharacters can tell something must be done, lest magic be lost forever.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

As\nlong as the Storyteller takes care to weave all of these different elements back into one\nstory that the whole troupe can participate in, this period of investigation and\nquestioning can take as long and go in as many directions as the Storyteller desires.\nTHE STAR COUNCIL\nScarred by interactions with the Thal’hun and various Technocratic and\ngovernment agencies, the Star Council has gone underground. As such, the\ncharacters will have some difficulty locating any members of the brotherhood. In\nthe end, mages worthy of the title are likely to discover the information they seek\nsomehow. Unless the Storyteller prefers some other locale, the group probably\nfinds one of the warehouses wherein the Star Council has stashed one or more of\nits alien artifacts for study, along with several members of the Star Council\nassigned to study the various items.\nIf the characters approach peacefully and appear interested in the missing\nUFOlogists, the Council members are friendly, and convincing them to allow the\ncharacters to examine it is relatively simple. The Council has determined that the\nflat metal object, scored with silvery markings, might be some sort of computing\ndevice, but they cannot discern what it is designed to do. Appropriate Effects could\ndiscover that the device is a control panel for an alien craft, and that it serves as a\nspecial guidance system. Correspondence or Spirit Effects might further show that the\ndevice could control a vessel with extradimensional capabilities. Impressed by such\nacumen, the Council members might be convinced to allow the characters to take\nthe device, though possibly at the cost of having the impressionable cultists follow\nthem around trying to “help out.”\nIf confronted with violence or abuse, the Council members attempt to flee; if\ncornered, they are surprisingly resourceful. Characters attempting to take the item\nby force should most likely easily handle the amateurish cultists, but they might well\nlose a valuable source of information later on down the line — not to mention incur\nthe wrath of the other Council members at an inopportune time.\nTHE THAL’HUN\nFinding the Thal’hun offices requires similar magic or Background use as\ndiscovering the Star Council did. The difference is that the Thal’hun are no longer\nin residence. Mundane investigations reveal that the cult’s lease expired five months\nago and that the leasing party did not leave a forwarding address. Depending on\nwhich Spheres or other means are employed, additional information can be obtained\nvia magical means. The Thal’hun leadership finally managed to contact its spiritual\nicon Khuvon and embarked upon a new mission to meet its goals. The inner circle\nand its followers have taken to calling themselves the Disciples of Zoraster, after the\ninvisible city of light that is reputed to be the goal of their spiritual master. Extremely\nclever and successful magical investigations might even discover that the Thal’hun\nDisciples have taken to fomenting smaller splinter cults that specialize in tracking\nand kidnapping obscure figures of the occult — and mages.\nStorytellers are encouraged to leave just enough evidence behind at the homes\nand offices of the Thal’hun members to give the characters the impression that these\ncultists have recently graduated to much bigger and more serious activities than they\nwere previously familiar with. Don’t give away too much of their plan yet, though.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Provided the characters are polite\n(perhaps performing a few minor tasks for the busy scholar) and willing to describe the facts\nas they know them so far, she is only too happy to tell them what she knows.\nThe Zigg’raugglurr\nThe first recorded sighting of the Zigg’raugglurr entities was claimed by represen-\ntatives of the Order of Hermes in San Francisco. Hermetic scholars describe them as\nappearing as yellow floating blobs covered with reptilian scales and pulsating veins,\nsporadically changing size from a few inches to a few yards across. Their fairly unwieldy\nname, Zigg’raugglurr, was assigned by Hermetic mages who recorded the first attempt\nto communicate with these beings. (Mages less worried about formality often just call\nthem“Zigg.”) Repeat encounters with the same Zigg proved remarkably easier to resist,\nwith mounting evidence suggesting that specimens actually possessed more knowledge\nof our world in early meetings and less later. They appear intent on capturing mages\nrather than killing them, but what they do with such captives is unknown.\nThe Zigg’raugglurr inhabit an alternate dimension, and they interact with reality in\nbizarre fashion. The alien Zigg may enter the time-stream, step out of it and return at some\nother point. Similarly, they can enter the physical world, depart and return. Alternatively,\nthey can manipulate the portions of their bodies entering three-dimensional space,\nseemingly changing shape or size. The Zigg do not seem to possess Avatars, and thus do not\nperform dynamic magic, yet their extradimensional natures and alien technology allow\nthem to perform miraculous feats that can draw the wrath of Paradox spirits. Indeed Paradox\nspirits, when they do appear, seem particularly vicious and antagonistic toward the Zigg,\nprobably because the outsiders are completely alien to reality.\nKa Luon\nThe“Grays.” Modern pop culture and UFO nuts around the world have embraced\nthe vision of an alien species that has plagued humanity in secret for, at very least, the\npast five or six decades. Nevertheless, more questions arise with each answer that seems\napparent. These beings have been observed abducting and experimenting upon\nhumans, and at times have come into direct conflict with Umbral explorers and the\nTechnocratic Void Engineers. At other times, however, they have been friendly and\neven conciliatory to those they encounter. Likewise, in the history of their contact the\nKa Luon have appeared to be an actual alien race, a form of spirit entity and even\nsomething completely unidentifiable. They apparently possess highly sophisticated\ntechnology, yet some encounters have seen no sign of such devices. Lastly, they appear\nto be hostile toward the Zigg, but for reasons no one has been able to fathom.\nDEATH FROM ABOVE\nAt this point, the characters should be developing a picture of what is going on, and\nat least some of them are on the trail of the Thal’hun (maybe even preparing for the Zigg).\nIt’s clear that the kidnappings are merely indicative of a largely plot at work, and the more\nthey learn about it, the more horrifying it becomes. It seems that these forces are not just\ncapturing mages, but intend to do something terrible with their very Avatars!\nIf this isn’t enough to move the characters to action, a pair of unexpected\nattacks during this section should alert them to the urgency of the threat with which\nthey have become involved.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The timing for this particular event is best\nleft to you, but it should occur preferably at some point when it is late and lonely, or when\na cabal is investigating a depressed and broken area of the city or its surroundings.\nStorytellers are encouraged to devise their own statistics for the Zigg, both to\nscale them to the level of the characters involved as well as to represent how bizarre\nand unpredictable these creatures are. They should be challenging but not impos-\nsible, and since they are more concerned with capturing than killing it should not\nbe a fatal encounter. Given their mastery of time and space (at least as far as their\nindividual bodies), it should be impossible for the troupe to capture one of the Zigg,\nat least at this time. Rather, make it clear that the Zigg are aware of the characters\nand out to capture them if possible, then have them vanish.\nTHE THAL’HUN ATTACK\nThe Thal’hun on the other hand, are turned onto the characters by a snitch who\nobserves some of the mages snooping around the abandoned Thal’hun offices. If this\nnever happens, then perhaps the snitch instead spots a cabal visiting the Star\nCouncil warehouse. Whatever path proves to be the primary link to the cabals, the\nThal’hun mean business, and they send out at least one party after the characters,\nattempting to capture as many as possible.\nShould the Disciples of Zoraster succeed in capturing any of the characters, they\nindividually subject each of them to a ritual hoping to give Khuvon a chance to turn\nthem to its needs. Khuvon will eventually strip the Avatar from the mage’s being and\nentrap it within the hidden realm of Zoraster, although chances are good that the\ncharacter is rescued long before this can succeed. Still, it is a chilling glimpse of what\nthe cult’s true intentions are. If the characters defeat the Thal’hun, they discover\nvarious documents and the like that suggest that the Disciples of Zoraster are busy\nplanning to “liberate” a lost starship supposedly capable of reaching Zoraster,\ncurrently being held in Area 51 of the Nellis Air Force Base north of Las Vegas. The\nlevel of detail is up to the Storyteller, but it should be sufficient to point the\ncharacters toward the base, at least if they need such a ride to reach Zoraster. Perhaps\nmore important to the themes of this story, the troupe should find suitable evidence\nthat the Thal’hun have abducted dozens of mages for unknown purposes.\nKEY TO THE CITY\nIt should become apparent by now that both the Zigg and the Thal’hun are\noperating from locations outside of this reality, which means the characters will have\nto find some way to reach one of their bases if they want to inflict lasting harm.

The vessel’s guidance system has been stripped from it, but if\nall has gone well, this panel will happen to be the one the troupe gained from the Star\nCouncil earlier in the story. A Mental Challenge (retest Technology) against a\ndifficulty of nine Traits will allow someone to install the panel. Alternatively, a\nquick rote or two involving Forces or Matter, potentially paired with Correspondence\nor the like, might prove effective in determining what happened. Ideally, the\ncharacters manage to hijack the alien vessel, armed with the appropriate controls,\nand catapult into the extradimensional spaces where Zoraster lies.\nEither way they choose to travel, there’s no going back now.\nTHE FINAL ASSAULT\nWhether they arrive by ship or under their own power, the characters discover that\nthe alien city of Zoraster is really a Horizon Realm where the powerful spirit called Khuvon\nhas been putting Avatars in order to save them from the Avatar Storm and to keep them\nfrom the clutches of the Zigg’raugglurr. A materialized Khuvon confronts them on their\narrival, angrily demanding to know why they have intruded, and it’s quite possible a fight\nmight break out before very long. Any battle is almost immediately interrupted by an even\ngreater threat, however — the arrival of the Zigg assault force!\nAlthough the characters likely do not agree with the containment strategy of the\nKhuvon and the Thal’hun, it’s even more certain that neither side wants to see the Zigg\ndrain the power of the Avatars for their own alien purposes. Unless the Storyteller\nwants a two-part (or three-way) battle, a temporary alliance is recommended at this\nstage. Some of the restrictions that have burdened magic on Earth might be eased while\nin this Realm, though characters should be aware that this is a temporary benefit at\nbest, meaning that they can meet the attackers nearly full-force. Joined by Khuvon’s\npowers, cultists and mages alike rally to meet the incoming Zigg assault, with the fate\nof the trapped Avatars, and thus the universe, hanging in the balance.\nStorytellers are encouraged to make this battle as bizarre as it is desperate,\nplaying up the alien wonders of Zoraster as well as the strange powers and tactics of\nthe Zigg. Fortunately, many of the Zigg’s most potent powers are somewhat limited\nby the nature of the realm, but they are still formidable enemies possessed of great\nintelligence and obviously superior technology. Khuvon and the majority of the\ncultists should perish during the battle as well, either to buy the characters time to\nrally or perhaps as a great sacrifice designed to disable a good number of the Zigg\nattack force if things are looking grim. In the end, however, if players wish to\ntriumph, they will have to employ strong tactics, quick thinking and some clever\n(not to mention potent) magic as well.\nKA LUON\nAt any time throughout the story, the aliens commonly called the Grays\nmight choose to become involved, making them excellent Storyteller devices\nif the players have a run of bad luck or otherwise find themselves losing through\nno real fault of their own. The Ka Luon have an antagonistic rivalry with the\nZigg’raugglurr and might appear at a critical moment to offer the characters aid\nagainst the Zigg. When the characters enter Zoraster, there is a strong possibility\nthat a few of the Ka Luon are currently in residence. Depending on how things\nprogress, the Grays might prove to be horrible enemies or unexpected allies.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Even the science\nof the Technocracy and the Ka Luon ultimately fails, and everything of wonder,\ninventiveness and magic fades away to become a possession of the Zigg. It is\nquestionable whether their alien minds actually take joy in this, or whether it is\nmerely the logical conclusion of millennia of work. Either way, magic dies, the\nGauntlet becomes impassable and the universe is doomed to a lingering death,\ndrowned in mediocrity.\nShould the characters win, things are a bit more positive, even if they\ncannot reverse the loss of magic in the current universe. With the Zigg repulsed\nand the Thal’hun shattered, the Avatars will remain intact, but during the battle\nthe containment system is damaged. As a result, the Avatars begin draining away\nto… well, where is not immediately apparent. Beyond the walls of Creation, in\nsome other place, these shards of the One begin joining together to start a new\nuniverse. Alas, the soul of the current one is left to die, as its power flows into\na new place. It will take a long time to complete, but the characters have ensured\nthe beginning of the next Cycle, even if it does come at the expense of a\nwhimpering end to this one.\nWhatever the characters have accomplished, magic is fading away rapidly.\nWhile they are capable of returning to Earth, it should be obvious that magic is still\ndying. They may take comfort in their victory and what it has done to continue the\ncycle of Avatars and Ascension, and it is recommended that the Storyteller offer\nsome other rewards and compensations to help ease the sense of failure that might\notherwise surround this conclusion. Ultimately, the characters and their world ease\ngently into normalcy, where magic has no further place — but the potential of\nhumanity might just be about to be realized at last.\nHELL ON EARTH\nWhat if reality’s slow, inexorable slide into decay picks up some steam and the\nNephandi find themselves poised to attain victory over Creation itself? Just as\nAscension can, theoretically, be achieved by humanity as a whole, so, too, can\nDescent. But what happens when the Consensus betrays the promise of its own inner\ndivinity? What happens when mankind chooses darkness over light, death over life?\nIf you choose to walk this way, be careful. You are about to betray everything\nyou ever believed about the Ascension War and humanity’s place in the world of the\nAwakened. Are you still reading? Good. Because this is more than just the story of\nAscension’s most terrible and merciless enemies. It is the tale of humanity’s\nweakness and the dismal failure of the Awakened to champion the cause of\nenlightenment and give Ascension to the Sleepers.\nTHE LEAD-UP\nBefore the final chapter is told, the stage must be well and truly set. Let the\nmages feel that, due to the failings of Sleeper and Awakened alike, things are\ncoming apart at the seams. “Hell on Earth,” after all, should not come as a total\nsurprise when it begins so much as it should seem a grim but logical conclusion\nto reality’s troubles.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

In medieval Europe, they called him the Black Man, patron of witchcraft\nand devil-worship — some believed that he was the Devil. In the Arabic world, where\nhe abided for many years in long ago days, he went by the name of al-Aswad, the name\nhe gave to those who followed after him as Fallen Oracles. To the Sumerians, he was Ut-\nNapishtam, the primordial man who was chosen by the gods to survive the Great Flood\nand was thereafter granted immortality but made to abide apart from all lesser creatures.\nIn truth, he was all these things and none, the anointed champion of the darkness\nfrom beyond Creation, and his True Name is lost to the deep memory of time. Perhaps\nthe most far-thinking human being ever to exist, he was chosen not for his power or\nhis knowledge — for with life enough a man may develop these qualities — but instead\nfor his wisdom, patience and sense of strategy. The gods who raised him up remembered\nbeing outcast from the endless shadow in which they abided, shoved away by the\nhateful presence of something new — existence. They looked on it and were pained\nby jealousy, for they, though powerful and terrible, could never truly be. That privilege\nwas reserved for all that existed within the hateful light.\nAs the Lord of Entropy and master of all things wicked, the Unnamed has at last\nfound the opportunity to grant his masters what they desire — the Descent and utter\ncorruption of this reality.\nTHE OTHER ASWADIM\nIn addition to many “ordinary” Nephandi and other servants of darkness, the\nUnnamed still enjoys the support — maintained through canny politics, incentives and,\nof course, the threat of their destruction — of the first five people to accept his offer. The\nyoungest of them hails from Pharaonic Egypt and all are vastly powerful. Naturally, all have\ntheir own agendas and each has accepted a lesser position only because the Unnamed is so\nmuch more mystically potent than any one or two (or perhaps even three) of them and none\ntrust each other enough to attempt to depose him. Still, it is possible to turn one Fallen\nOracle against another, given time, effort and planning. Perhaps, it is even possible to turn\nall of the Aswadim, including their founder and master, upon one another. Whether such\nan act would allow the world to be freed from the grip of terror or would only set the stage\nfor a tyrant yet more terrible, however, is a question none can answer.\nTHE AVATAR STORM\nIn the Fall, the Avatar Storm plays an entirely different role than the one envisioned\nin the more “standard” Ascension cosmology. Just prior to the fall of the Gauntlet, Fallen\nmagic unleashes this nightmare torrent upon Sleeper and Awakened alike, a singular\nmoment of untold worldwide destruction. The rent and tattered souls become a new kind\nof widderslainte Avatar when the worlds of flesh and spirit bleed together. Or perhaps it\nis more accurate to say that the spirit-shards even bond with Nephandi to become the\nFallen equivalent of Anakim, a new nobility among the damned.\nCLAMING THE PRIZE\nThe first phase of the Unnamed’s final plan involves the capture of Horizon, there\nto eventually exploit the powerful Nodes connected to the realm in order to spread the\ntaint of his masters to the farthest reaches of Earth. Fortunately, little but magic stands\nin his way. Horizon has been sealed since Lord Gilmore barred all from entry (or exit)\nby means of powerful wards.

With a few hours worth of rituals, the\nUnnamed shatters the seals holding Horizon shut and unleashes a terrible conflagra-\ntion, destroying all spirits and disembodied mages who yet reside therein.\nTriumphantly, the Unnamed enters into the blasted ruins of Horizon and begins to\nstrip the realm of its Quintessence stockpiles. He then uses his mastery of the Qlippothic\nSpheres to send connections back along the ley lines that connect the realm to its anchoring\nNodes on Earth, nine of the world’s most powerful. Through these channels, he will pour\nout his corruption and thereby defile the Earth. In the Council Chamber, he sets his left\nhand upon the Saxum Oculorum (the “Stone of Eyes” which records all that has ever been\nsaid within the heart of Horizon) and it burns black, run through with cracks.\nLOST HORIZON\nNaturally, virtually every Tradition mage on Earth, as well as no small number of\nTechnocrats and scattered others, will want to launch an assault against the Aswadim\noccupying Horizon (the heart of the Traditions’ strength). Battling the Nephandi has\nTHE CHANGE\nMost of the Nephandi empowered by the loosing of the Storm become\nquite potent, having channeled the essence of dozens or even hundreds of\npeople into themselves, thus expanding their Awakened abilities. Consider\nthose Nephandi who partake of the dark sacrament of the Storm (a select few,\nperhaps only 10% of all Fallen) to benefit from the following changes: +5 Traits\nto Attributes, +15 Traits of Abilities, +2 Arete Traits (to a maximum of 8), +5\nlevels of Qlippothic Spheres and +2 Willpower Traits (no maximum).\nThese alterations, however, also put a strain on the sanity of the affected\nparties. All such Nephandi gain a permanently active derangement, to reflect\nthe psychic shock of so gruesomely and forcibly incorporating the tormented\nsouls of others into one’s own being. Naturally, as none of them particularly\nneed the boost (and the Unnamed forbids any of them to do so, given the\nprobably of insanity resulting from it), the Aswadim refrain from the rite.\nSIGNING OFF\nThe last transmission from the “Rogue Council” is sent from Horizon.\nNow, the Unnamed feels no need for secrecy, safe within the walls of the most\npowerful man-made realm ever to exist. The Unnamed allows the following\nmessage to reach Traditionalists, Disparates, Orphans and even Technocrats,\nseemingly at random. Larger chronicles can see characters receiving fragments\nof the message, perhaps only a sentence or two, perhaps distorted or in different\nlanguages. Thus do you drive characters to seek each other out to complete the\npuzzle, or to hoard their precious clues, confusing the issue further.\n“I am the one who came before and shall follow after. I am your father and\nyour destroyer, architect of your destiny. I am him who is come in glory to\ncrush the thrones of the Earth beneath my tread. You have known me by many\nnames, my children, but you know not the slightest part of my power. Submit\nto me and know the bounty of my love; defy me and suffer the agonies of my\nboundless wrath.

Even those\nwho realize that this is likely a bad idea don’t know what else to do. In a larger chronicle,\nthe troupe is invited to send a representative cabal or two to this meeting. Those players\nwhose characters choose to remain behind can then portray the Tradition represen-\ntatives from other cities at the symposium. You should prepare a wide range of briefing\nsheets for these Storyteller characters. Full character sheets are probably not required\nat what is ostensibly a peaceful gathering, but if you anticipate trouble or challenges,\ninclude enough statistics to cover the foreseen problems.\nIn the midst of this model of poor planning, the characters are taken aside by a\nhooded and cloaked figure. The individual, a man of seemingly middling years, places\nan elaborate key into the hands of one character and tells her to “seek the Parma Magica\nin the ruins of Doissetep.” He tells the characters that they must go to Horizon with\nthe ill-fated attackers. There they must use the backdoor found in the Tomb of La Salle,\nthe Hermetic Master who is largely credited with the formation of the Traditions, to\nenter the Shard Realm of Forces at the site of the annihilated Chantry. At that, he\nwalks away and all but disappears. Within seconds, the character can’t even remember\nwhich direction he went in. All that is left are his instructions and his key.\nSHIELD OF FAITH\nNo matter what plan they ultimately decide on, the battle at Horizon is fierce\nand desperate. While the characters of the representative cabal follow their path in\ntheir own scenes, the rest of the chronicle can play out the ill-fated assault on\nHorizon, with the failure of the Storyteller characters foreshadowing the Descent to\ncome. While they may encounter some fighting (enough to get their blood going and\nkeep them jumpy), let the characters see only as much as they have to in order to get\nto the tomb. Leave them confused as to what was taking place and with nothing more\nthan the vaguest of descriptions of what has happened to the others. They seem to\nbe drawn to the tomb, and from there into the Shard Realm of Forces. Make the\ncharacters sweat a bit in this frightening Realm, but don’t punish them too harshly.\nThey still have a lot of hard work ahead of them.\nSearching through the ruins, one of the characters eventually finds a charred\nbook titled Bonisagus’ Parma Magica. A quick glance reveals it to be a text about the\nquest to unify the Houses of Hermes and that journey’s reflection in the formation\nof the Nine Mystic Traditions. It was uplifting, perhaps, in better days, but now it\nis seemingly useless. No other trace of a “Parma Magica” is to be found among the\nrubble, but just as the cabal is about to give in to despair, the key given over to one\nof the mages begins to grow warm. Then, of its own accord, it floats into midair,\npassing harmlessly through any container it is stored in. The key “unfolds,” warping\nalong its spatial axes to become a golden gateway, beyond which a battered but still\nbeautiful realm can be seen. The cabal has an open invite to Balador, courtesy of\nAkrites Salonikas and Marianna.\nTHE AEGIS\nWhen the cabal arrives at Balador, the characters discover that, despite any\nrumors they have heard or evidence they have seen to the contrary, the Pleasuredome\nis still very much alive. Marianna, the keeper of the realm, greets them, and along\nwith several prominent Hermetic wizards, reveals the secret of the book. When\nproperly examined, it is revealed to contain a gleaming magical shield within its\npages— the Aegis, otherwise known as the Greater Parma Magica.

Nothing comes in or goes out once the\nGreater Parma Magica is activated. The characters will be asked to help with the\npreparations— huge amounts of Tass have to be fed to the Great Parma Magica when\nit is in place, and circles and seals must be placed in the proper configurations. It then\nfalls to the recipients to inform any characters who didn’t come along (as well as\nanyone else they wish to protect) that they must hurry to receive the protection of\nthe shield. The amount of time the earthbound characters have to prepare for the\njourney once alerted is up to the Storyteller, although it should be a matter of\nminutes rather than hours.\nTo avoid any petty last-minute snubs resulting in pointless character death, the\nStoryteller may also rule that Marianna or one of the other powerful Tradition mages\npresent sends out a massive Mind message to mages around the world alerting them\nto the shelter being provided. They might even transport characters who have no\nmeans of traveling there themselves into Balador. This last should be presented as\na desperate option, however, to avoid the sense that Narrator characters will solve\nall of the players’ characters’ problems in this scenario.\nTHE STORM IS LOOSED\nNot long after the last characters reach the safety of Balador, the Unnamed\ncontends with the wills locked within the Avatar Storm. A great instinctive dread\nhangs within these miserable soul-fragments, a beast’s terror at the thought of being\nforced out of its den. By strictest mental fortitude, the Unnamed “pulls” the Storm\nout of the Gauntlet and unleashes it upon both the world and the Umbrae at once.\nThose Awakened who do not have protections against both Prime and Spirit assaults\ndie horribly. Though spared some of the worst of the storm by their weaker spirits,\ncountless mortals die as well due to the sudden influx of energies.\nAs the Avatar Storm crashes into Balador, it is apparent that the Aegis will hold\nif nothing goes wrong. Of course, something does go wrong. The Unnamed, having\ndefeated the would-be invaders of Horizon and sensing a flaw in his plan, leaves the\nother Aswadim to continue the ritual that keeps the Avatar Storm raging and comes\nto Balador to attend to the Aegis personally. A cataclysmic shaking of the realm’s\nfoundations heralds his arrival. Some of the Storm slips in, probably killing mages\nstanding just paces away from the characters before dissipating. As this happens, the\nUnnamed can be seen outside the Aegis, hurling terrible sorceries at it.\nThis should be a moment of high drama, as the players face down the most potent\nbeing in Creation. It should appear that the Unnamed is about to break through\n(perhaps delayed only by some of their more clever or powerful efforts), when abruptly,\nhe smiles cryptically at them and withdraws, vanishing utterly. Not long afterward, the\nStorm begins to subside, eventually fading back to its “normal” level of disturbance. It\nmay flare up again from time to time, as drama requires, but it has served its main\npurpose — destroying most of the Awakened opposed to the Descent.\nA BRIEF RESPITE\nFor a while, things grow quiet again, as the Unnamed takes stock of his\nsituation, recovers his strength and compensates for unexpected casualties.

Everyone will be busy — there’s plenty left to do now that it’s obvious\nEarth and its nearby dimensions are in serious trouble.\nLet the characters have as much time as they need here, without letting them\nfeel as though they necessarily have any time at all. Some of these plans may work\nand others definitely will not. In general, only the most innovative contingencies\nhave any chance of proving useful in the days to come. This section is more of a\nperiod of time than a series of events. The Fallen entrench themselves, just as the\nremaining mages of Earth do.\nIn addition to any plans and plot the characters might devise, the following\nscenes can offer some additional ideas for quests to undertake during this dark time,\nincluding a potential climactic battle on behalf of the Traditions the characters can\ntake part in. It’s even possible that the characters devise their own last ditch effort\nto destroy the Unnamed, in which case it is highly recommended that the Storyteller\nstructure the closing events of the chronicle around the success of this desperate\neffort — or its failure.\nTHE GAUNTLET FALLS\nOverwhelmed by human fear and the belief in what is impossible and yet plainly\ntrue, the Gauntlet crumbles, allowing the Umbrae to wash into our world. Sprits of\npain, death and torment, drawn close by the suffering inflicted by the Avatar Storm,\nare among the first into the world. Humanity’s shield against the terrors of its dreams\nhas just failed and nothing will ever be the same again. Ghosts walk among the living\nand demons crawl free from the pits of countless hells, eager to feed on warm blood.\nNor is that the extent of the Unnamed’s crusade against the outer realms. Using yet\nmore of his stockpiled Tass and blasphemous rituals scribed on the outer walls of Creation,\nthe Unnamed sends his Aswadim to the Axis Mundi bearing a cauldron of venom, which\nthey pour into a wound in the tree at the heart of the spirit world. Within a week, it withers\nand topples, dropping dying branches throughout the worlds. Some might even end up on\nEarth. A few of these branches might live long enough for people to find them and save\nthem, meaning that hope is not entirely lost. The characters might be able to recover some\nbranches from the Alder Bole. Kept alive and enchanted properly, such remnants of the\ntree can allow for travel between worlds and contact with the surviving Oracles (if any),\nas well as serving as potent weapons against malevolent spirits.\nTHE DEATH OF THE MACHINE\nWith no Gauntlet to hold back superstition, and faith in the power of science and\ntechnology to protect the world at an all-time low, the Technocracy’s paradigm falls\napart. The Umbrae wash over the world, dissolving 10,000 years of human progress and\nreducing mankind to barbarism. Laws that were once true are no longer so. Friction on\na dry branch may cause it to shudder and bleed, but it will not start a fire.\nAs their reality crumbles, the surviving Technocrats approach remaining\nTradition authorities — the characters among them — and ask for succor from the\nNephandi, in exchange for what resources they can bring to bear in the final hours\nof the conflict.

Coupled\nwith the fact that Technocratic magic has become much less reliable on the whole,\nthe debate might be much more heated than it first appears it should be.\nAN OFFER YOU CAN’T REFUSE\nNow that his control is stronger, the Unnamed has no problem with offering a slice\nof the pie to any Awakened person who will hear his pitch. Normally, intermediaries make\nthe pitch, but the characters in the representative cabal are somehow different or special.\nHe will want to offer them their hearts’ deepest desires personally. Larger chronicles will\nsee cabals, op teams or individual mages approached in quieter moments. The Unnamed\nhas some idea of each mage’s nature, and he tailors his approach accordingly.\nPivotally influential mages get the personal treatment, while less influential\nmages merit only an intermediary (portrayed by Narrators). Separate each of the\ngroups, and have your team deal with each group at the same time, to avoid spoiling\nthe surprise and to foster uncertainty between the characters. Did a fellow mage\naccept or decline the offer? Which side is each working for now? Distrust between\nthe mages assists the Unnamed’s cause, a fact he is quick to exploit.\nTHE ORDER’S LAST STAND\nFaced with corruption of every Node on Earth and the inversion of the natural\norder, Lord Gilmore of the Order of Hermes hatches a final, desperate ploy — but\none that, even if successful, will cost the Awakened dearly. This is a brutally\ndangerous mission and the characters are among those elite forces selected to\nundertake it. It’s also possible he might inadvertently select a turncoat, in which case\nthings get interesting indeed…\nGilmore’s plan is simple. He intends to take most of the surviving members of the\nOrder of Hermes and some allied mages and make a final stand at a remote location.\nHe knows it is hopeless, but it is merely to buy time for a second force to infiltrate and\nretake Mus, a secure and easily defended realm conquered by the Fallen during their\ninitial attack. (If the Storyteller desires, another realm more familiar to the chronicle\nor suitable to its needs can be substituted for Mus.) While the massed Hermetics do\ntheir best to occupy the bulk of the Nephandi forces, the characters can infiltrate the\nnear-empty garrison and establish a base where the remaining Tradition members and\ntheir allies can operate from. The characters have enough time to ready themselves,\ndraw up some tactics and say their good-byes, then the attack must begin.\nTrue enough, the Fallen are completely unprepared for the attack and their\narmies are absent, having been sent to deal with the massed army of the Order of\nHermes. Still, there are some defenders there, and they quickly recover their wits.\nTailor the number of Nephandi present to the power of the cabal (and to the number\nof extras and Narrators you have available). The siege should be extremely difficult,\nbut possible. If the cabal makes the right moves, then the realm can be restored to\nthe Traditions, giving them a stable base of operations from which to strike against\nthe Nephandi. It might not be much, but it is better than nothing.\nTHE DESCENT\nNow that the Gauntlet is no more, the ordered ranks of Traditions and the\nTechnocratic Union have fallen and the other willworkers of the Earth are scattered\nin fear and fractiousness, the Unnamed raises high his ultimate weapon, ready to end\nthe war forever and break humanity to his yoke.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Beneath a sky of seething molten crimson and choking black mists, the\nFallen sit in judgment over the desert wastes once known as Earth.\nTHE END OF DAYS\nWhen all is said and done, the world writhes in the throes of Descent,\ndamnation seemingly everlasting. Magic still lives, though the numbers of its\npractitioners are much diminished, save for the Fallen. The Traditions are a frail\nshadow of their former power and the Technocracy is fallen entirely. Perhaps 10%\nof the world’s (non-Nephandic) Awakened have survived this holocaust.\nDemons, dark spirits and Unspeakable Horrors from Beyond walk the Earth\nwith impunity and some lord over scattered enclaves of miserable survivors as dread\ntaskmasters and cruel barons. The Fallen revel in what they have wrought and settle\nin to enjoy an eternity of ruling over a helpless human race largely reduced to Iron\nAge civilization and subject to depredations unknown since the worst excesses of the\npriests of the demon-gods of the ancient world.\nIf the characters have done well, however, then some manner of resistance lives\non, surviving to bring the fight to the Aswadim and perhaps even topple them one\nday. The process of driving out the dark is centuries-long at best, but without courage\nand dedication, one day it can begin anew. For now, however, it is enough to know\nthat the end has come and gone and Ascension has proven to be a lie, a feast of ashes\nsupped upon in sorrow by a failed human race.\nTHE EARTH WILL SHAKE\nIt has been estimated that as much as 100 tons of interplanetary material falls to\nearth every day. During the last three decades, over 100 air bursts — most measured\nin megatons — were detected throughout Earth’s upper atmosphere. Scientists who\nhave calculated the entire heat content of the planet over the course of its existence\nbelieve that the planet might have frozen over by now were it not for the additional\nwarmth that the occasional collision with asteroids and comets generates.\nIn short, space debris collides with our world all the time. Most of it burns up\nor blasts apart from air friction. Objects large enough to reach the surface intact\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Every\nhundred thousand years or so, something large enough to change a lot of people’s\nreligion hits. And around every couple hundred million we catch something big\nenough to knock the top dozen rungs off of the planet’s evolutionary ladder.\nThe following story concerns just such an event. The characters learn that a\nlarge meteoroid is on a collision course with Earth. Is there time to avert it, and what\nmethods must be deployed to do so? And what can be done should these methods\nfail? Can anything be done at all?\nTHE CELESTIAL BALL\nConcurrent with the story in the physical world runs a parallel plot involving\nthe reverberations of the impending impact in the Umbra. Storytellers may wish to\ndownplay this spiritual aspect of the very physical problem — at least in the early\nchapters. Although presented as interstitial scenes bridging the physical chapters,\n“The Celestial Ball” may be run all at once as prelude, interlude or denouement,\ndepending on how the Storyteller chooses to pace the story — fast-paced action in\na race against time, or a drawn-out process of mounting intellectual discovery.\nThe spiritual shock wave of the collision could come all at once on a single\nUmbral voyage foreshadowing the event long in advance, or it could unfold in brief\nglimpses through dreams and visions that increase in frequency and intensity as the\nevent becomes imminent. Conversely, the Storyteller might find that the Umbral\nsubplot gradually eclipses the deteriorating situation in the material world. The\ncharacters might focus their efforts on interacting with the planetary entities rather\nthan dealing with the mounting panic and natural disasters on the material plane —\nacting globally rather than locally, so to speak.\nCONSIDERATIONS\nThis scenario begins with the characters becoming aware of the meteoric\nmenace through an unlikely pair of amateur astronomers, Abner and Whitney\nTripplethorpe. They have observed the asteroid — which they’ve labeled Typhon\n2004 — and calculated its path. They are now attempting to alert both the political\nand scientific authorities to its presence. If one of your characters is into astronomy,\nshe could learn of the Tripplethorpes through any number of amateur publications,\nmessage boards or chatrooms through which they have tried to make their findings\npublic. Otherwise, the characters might bump into them by chance meeting as the\npair travels around seeking any important personage who will hear them out. Not\nonly that, but it appears that other entities have heard what the Tripplethorpes have\nto say and aren’t too happy with them, which means the astronomers might require\nprotection if they hope to live long enough to spread the word.\nUnless the Tripplethorpes find the allies and resources they require to notify the\nworld of its incipient fate within the bounds of the local chronicle, they will move on,\nleaving rumors, speculation and a minimal amount of information for the characters\nto consider. With a small chronicle, you may be able to have the characters travel with\nthe Tripplethorpes, but larger games tend to remain based in the same location.\nCharacters will need to either persuade the Tripplethorpes to remain in their region\nor gather the information that the two possess as quickly as possible. If the two have\nmade some friends, they will attempt to keep in contact with updates about their quest\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Likewise, Storyteller characters such as street prophets or\nmadmen, anyone who might be able to tap into the mystical side of the universe, can\nspout fragments illustrating the growing insanity beyond the Gauntlet. You can use\nthis method to introduce and flesh out the Umbral story or to entice characters to\ncross the Gauntlet and experience the Umbral subplot for themselves.\nWhile the inhabitants of the physical world remain unaware of the threat, the\nspirit world darkens with foreboding. Vistas appear that show events to come, but\nnot their ultimate cause: large-scale disasters, earthquakes, tidal waves, volcanic\neruptions, cities blasted into ruins, black clouds that fill the sky and blot out the sun.\nIn the Low Umbra, mass movements and migrations are underway as the wraith\npopulace makes room for a great influx of the newly dead. In the Spirit Wilds, the\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms seem to be going insane, as herds stampede for no\ndiscernible reason and predators either launch into berserk killing sprees or flee in\nblind terror with their tails between their legs. Ancient trees may uproot themselves\nto join in the panic, while smaller plants shrink and shrivel back into the ground,\nas if trying to hide from the sun. Mages who are normally on friendly terms with such\nspirits can engage them in conversation and learn that they know that some major\nchange is coming, but do not know its exact nature or cause.\nCONFIRMATIONS\nAssuming they can be kept safe from the various forces seeking to do them harm —\nthe Union, doomsday cultists, etc. — Abner and Whitney continue their quest to alert the\nleaders of the world to its peril, presumably with the aid of at least some of the characters\nby this point. Old classmates may be looked up, favors called in, strings pulled, palms\ngreased, backs scratched, hands washed, anything to push the news up the top-heavy chain\nof command. Allies and Contacts Backgrounds, not to mention social and bureaucratic\nskills, must figure heavily into the action here, and rounds of tiresome appointments may\nbe condensed into a series of challenges based on these Traits. Key scenes can be played out\nas cut scenes, with extras in bureaucratic roles, illustrating the static nature of the Masses.\nIn large games, it’s possible some characters are actively opposing the investi-\ngations of those who believe the Tripplethorpes through their own resources. Not\nall of the characters in the game should believe the esoteric claptrap being spouted\nby these eccentric amateurs. Mentors and other Storyteller characters have their\nown opinions and act of their own accord, perhaps even in competition to those they\nmight normally assist. Such conflicts can spur additional subplots and add to the\ndrama of your story. If the characters manage to trap each other in competitive\njockeying for too long, then they have only themselves to blame for the inevitable.\nTHE CELESTIAL BALL: INVITATIONS\nIn the spiritual remnant of the Library of Alexandria, Chief Librarian Aristarchus\ninvokes the aid of Urania, the Muse of Astronomy, to determine the cause of the astral\ndisturbance, while Chief Astronomer Hypatia marks its progress from the Mouseion\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Hypatia asks any\nexperienced Umbral traveler to journey to the Epiphamy known as the Continuum\nOrrery, a sort of programmable interactive planetarium, to see what can be learned there.\nMeanwhile, a beautiful silver-haired woman rides a bluish-white mare through-\nout the lands of the Vulgate, pursuing a quest of her own. She claims to know the cause\nof the invasion, so she will show up at the Library eventually, but the characters may\ncross her path at any point. She gives her name as Diana and has the glamour of a very\npowerful spirit — perhaps even an Incarna. According to her, the stones in the sky\nmake up an advance force sent by a cold and dark entity from beyond the Horizon. This\nspirit is desirous of Diana’s mother and has come to take her by force if she does not\ngive herself to him willingly. Diana seeks allies to secure her mother’s freedom, without\ngiving up much more about her true nature or purpose in the Vulgate.\nCONFLAGRATION\nBeyond the world of Sleeper politics, the leaders of the Awakened community\nrespond in their own way. Some older mages see the asteroid as an agent of their own\nhubris, sent as their punishment for losing the Ascension War, or even for daring to\nwage it in the first place. While they retire to their chambers to await the end, the\nyounger leaders — who have yet to learn the full meaning of hubris — seize the\nopportunity to take a more proactive stance.\nSAVING THE DAY\nIdeas and plans fly about the magical community, and characters in large games\ncan hear about them in a number of ways. Emissaries from the Rogue Council (or\ntransmissions directly from the same body) present their “definitive” plans, pitching\nfor several characters’ help, perhaps splitting and reforming several cabals on the basis\nof skills and/or merit. Prophetic dreams inspire the spiritual. Desperate Avatars\nmanifest in spontaneous Seekings to advise for or against a character’s plans. Develop\nseveral more “solutions” and introduce them through Storyteller characters or devices.\nSpread rumors. Conflicting ideas will confuse efforts even further than they already\nshould be, adding to the stress of the characters and entangling their efforts further.\nWill the Traditions and Technocracy need to work together to avert disaster, or will\nthey each draw their own plans for averting or surviving the inevitable? Perhaps the\nTraditions scramble to divert the asteroid in the Umbra, while the Technocracy works\nsolely in the physical realm. Getting the two groups to actually work together is nearly\nimpossible. The newfound tolerance of certain factions within each group for the others’\nalternative theorems, however, might find splinter cells actively working together. The\nsuccess of a joint operation would go a long way toward encouraging further cross-\npollination of ideas and projects. It’s far more likely they’ll trip over each other’s feet.\nIn the event that their peers laugh at their ideas, or even refuse to acknowledge\nthe risk to humanity in the first place, the characters have to go it alone.\nNUCLEAR DIVERSIONS\nEven if the Tripplethorpes fail to alert the authorities, the major world govern-\nments will learn of the asteroid Typhon through the diligence of NASA’s Near Earth\nAsteroid Tracking program or through the European agency known as Spaceguard.

Those who have already researched the asteroid and its path\npossess invaluable data for the project, and can save the Union considerable time,\npossibly accelerating the project enough to divert or destroy Typhon before it becomes\na real danger. Op teams might be directed by their superiors to counter uncovered plans\nby the Traditions to divert Typhon, plans that would throw their own calculations out\nof whack. By having a secret missile silo nearby, the Technocratic community will stir\ninto action to prepare for launch, drawing information and resources from wherever\nthey can find it, including the characters.\nTHE CELESTIAL BALL: ARRIVALS\nDiana brings the characters to a grove far from the more heavily inhabited regions\nof the Vulgate, back along the River of Language toward the Spirit Wilds. Crouched\nbetween the roots of an impossibly large tree is an old woman dressed in rags, weeping\nsilently. Even those who have already met with Mother Earth in her various guises\nwould probably not recognize this wretched creature. Her initial reaction to human\nvisitors will not be friendly, and might even be outwardly hostile, depending on how\nthe characters act when first seeing her. If treated appropriately, however, both she and\nDiana are open to any suggestions the characters might make about seeking safety.\nAt an especially dramatic moment, the sky above darkens as the invader arrives\nin full force. The stones hanging in the air drift aside to make way for a veritable floating\ncontinent that descends to blot out the astral sky. Its pitted, cratered underbelly nearly\ntouches the ground in places, engulfing or crushing the tallest Spires and triggering\nterrible storms and earthquakes across the Vulgate. Over the uproar, an impossibly\nloud masculine voice booms a warning — Typhon has found them! The characters\nmay choose to face this threat head on by traveling straightaway to the aerial\ncontinent, or they may stay to defend the mother from whatever comes to get her.\nUltimately, though, the defenders will lose to brute strength and force of\nnumbers. The characters will then be seized and taken to the floating continent.\nAlternatively, the characters may elect to leave Diana and her mother behind while\nthey meet the incursion head on, with whatever other forces they can muster —\nother mages, spirit allies, even Patrons. In this case they will still be captured, and\nwill not know what befell the two ladies until the next section.\nCATASTROPHE\nCharacters who are directly involved with any of the plans described in the\nprevious section will naturally see its results for themselves. The progress of the other\nplans can be reported through different Tradition channels, by scrying mages or even\nindependent astronomers. Divergent efforts will undoubtedly conflict with each\nother, and any diplomatic skills the characters might possess could lessen these\nconflicts, and new alliances could develop on their own. Like politics, the threat of\nextinction can make for strange bedfellows.\nIf the players have managed to develop a method (or series of methods) to break\nTyphon away from its course or into pieces, the moment of fragmentation is an ideal time\nto close the game session — a cliffhanger moment. The same applies if their methods have\nfailed and Typhon sails past the moon into Earth’s orbit. The next game session can then\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Characters\nshould be denied any downtime actions between these sessions. Place them in a time stop\nto stretch the suspense until your next game. This will also give the Storyteller team time\nto plan the events of the following session and how they will handle the events of the\nimpact. Regardless of the players’ efforts, though, it should become readily apparent before\nlong that having so many different plans has undercut the efforts of the Awakened, and that\nat least a large portion of Typhon is still on course to impact the Earth.\nDoes this mean that the Storyteller has to look her players in the face and tell\nthem that they fail no matter how well they play? Not entirely. Even a marginal\nsuccess deserves some reward. A best-case scenario would be that Typhon is blasted\napart, or torn apart by gravitational turbulence, leaving at least one kilometer-wide\nchunk on a collision course, if not a number of larger pieces. A direct hit on the moon\nwill still cause a similar-sized piece of lunar debris to detach itself and continue along\nthe same path. Depending on events in “The Celestial Ball,” another hitherto\nunnoticed meteoric body can swoop in, “out of nowhere,” and shatter Typhon. The\nUmbral causes for this will be described forthwith. The difference between such\nmarginal victories and total failure will be described in the final section.\nTHE CELESTIAL BALL: THE DANCE\nCharacters searching for Diana or Mother Earth eventually find themselves at the top\nof a great plateau via rough-hewn steps that wind around the base of the mesa. The plateau\nsurface is even larger than it appeared from below, lit by an immense orb of burning yellow.\nThe whirling lights are also huge, spherical and impossibly distant, occupying places around\nthe perimeter. As they spin, each presents a roughly humanoid face or figure that may seem\nfamiliar to the mages. A veritable sea of smaller man-sized figures mills about the surface,\ndrifting and swaying in time to strange unearthly music and booming spirit-voices.\nThe characters must immediately join the dance, either through their own\nvolition or by being swept up in the press of bodies. Those who do not keep up with\nthe swirling movement around them risk getting trampled. Characters who choose\nto participate will find that they actually have quite a bit of freedom of movement\ndue to the scale and complexity of the overall dance, as partners and teams come\ntogether, exchange places and part. Learning the steps of each different dance\n(Physical Challenge against eight Traits; retest Performance) means that the mages\ncan interact socially with the other planetary dancers, and thus understand a little\nof the intentions and thoughts of the planetary entities themselves.\nUltimately, there is nothing to be done. This plot was hatched eons ago — for the\nplanets could see thousands of years in advance what road humanity was taking — and\nits momentum is nigh unstoppable. Furthermore, Mother Earth subconsciously desires\nthis union. She has secretly renounced her favorite children, ungrateful mankind, and\nwishes to be rid of them. Even Diana’s feelings could change if anyone reminds her that\nshe owes her own existence to a primordial impact. While successful participation in\nthe Celestial Ball can offer the characters a brief glimmer of hope, in the final\nsummation, the asteroid’s path cannot be changed.\nCATACLYSM\nIf one of the plans for saving the world enjoys overwhelming success, or if the\ncharacters can convince various Awakened factions to put aside their hostilities in time\nto coordinate their efforts, the Storyteller may judge that Earth escapes with only a few\nminor impacts and environmental upheaval that stabilizes within a generation or two.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

But this\nis a story about the end of the world, so consideration must be given to what happens.\nPortraying a cataclysm of this nature inevitably requires the storytelling team\nto call upon the Mind’s Eye. Simpler than a special effects extravaganza, however,\nis to focus on what each of the characters, or groups of characters, is doing in the final\nmoments. Those on Earth might be huddled in shelters, wrapped in magical shields,\nhoping devastation will pass them by. Others face tsunami, casting vulgar magics in\na desperate bid to stem the tide. Still more might be out searching for family and\nfriends, wishing to be with their loved ones at the last.\nThe physical impact of Typhon, while spectacular, is simply background\nmaterial. Typhon is the cause of the end of the world, perhaps most simply\nrepresented by turning out the lights, but Typhon isn’t the focus of the story — the\ncharacters are. Playing out each character’s end scenes as cut scenes or mass scenes,\nas need be, allows poignant exposition, shattered dreams, desperate measures, pure\npanic, calm resignation or enlightened escape (among others) to dominate the mood\nof the chronicle in its final hours.\nEPILOGUE: THE UMBRAL EXODUS\nWhen worlds collide on the material plane, the safest place is undoubtedly the\nUmbra. This is not to say that physical changes have no consequence in the lands\nof spirit, however. A mage in the Penumbra might experience a major global impact\nonly as a distant blast of light and heat followed by a slow rolling quake. Nearing the\nSpirit Wilds, the resulting storms, earthquakes and other geophysical effects may be\nfelt with the same deadly intensity as they are in the physical world, but they can be\navoided by those who know the ways of the Wilds.\nThe chaotic energies of global disasters strengthen the Spirit Wilds and erode the\nGauntlet in places where the world has grown more dynamic. Every individual death swells\nthe borders of the Dark Umbra, and it stands to reason that an extinction-level event could\nforce a sudden fusion of the three Umbrae. Regardless of the specific interpretation the\nStoryteller might decide on, the fact remains that, while characters in the Umbra might\nbe safe from some of the immediate effects of the disaster, aside from the perils that might\narise in the spirit realm, their home and just about everyone they ever knew or cared about\nis gone. Forever. Let that fact sink in, and watch how the characters respond.\nStorytellers of a chronicle in which most or all of the characters choose this\noption may decide to continue the chronicle as the characters seek out a new home\nworld to inhabit (or perhaps return to Earth to search for survivors), or they may\nsimply allow the refugees a few hours to put the disaster into context before fading\nto black on such somber meditations.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Legends\nabout this terrible apocalypse — and, some insist, the Spring that must follow it —\nfigure prominently in the histories of all kiths, cut across all geographic boundaries and\neven unite Seelie and Unseelie alike in speculation, supposition and dread.\nOf course, even thinking about the Endless Winter and what it might entail doesn’t\nreally prepare any of the fae for what truly lies in store. As consumed as they are with\nunraveling ancient prophecies and deciphering cryptic metaphors, even the most astute\nfae scholars fail to see the actual signs of the coming disaster unfold around them.\nBuilding up to your personal End-Time scenario properly is critical to its\nsuccess.

Forget notions of “canon” if you like — what has brought about Winter in\nyour timeline? Is it something that naturally happens when the Dreaming is\nendangered?

But is this\ntrue? Is Winter nothing more than a natural cycle, or is it something that was brought\nupon the world by a few poor decisions?\nOr might the real cause of Winter’s arrival be something closer to home for the fae?\nAfter all, it’s entirely possible that the fae allowed this to happen. While they were busy\narguing among themselves and waging petty wars of title and honor during their “golden\nage,” the mortals they once guided and inspired eventually adapted to life apart from the\nfae. Instead of fickle fae lords, they put their faith in the science they could rely on to\nproduce tangible results each time. Over time, mortals became less afraid of the dark than\nthey once were, but also less likely to imagine the fantastic out there as well. Faced with\nalien and often cruel or patronizing faerie nobles, they chose to trade wonder for security.\nUnable to count on the old ways, they learned that dreams are expendable.\nBlaming science and reason is too simple a scapegoat for this kind of scenario,\nhowever, for nockers and other inventive fae know well the Glamour that science\ncan hold. Laying blame thus avoids the responsibility that the Kithain bear for their\nhubris of ages past. Rather, changelings in such a scenario have no other choice but\nto recognize their folly and attempt to convince humanity otherwise, either en masse\nor one humble mortal at a time.\nAnother potential reason for the coming of Winter is an imbalance in the\nnature of the Kithain and their society. Perhaps Winter is coming because the two\ncourts no longer honor the natural balance between light and dark. The Seelie will\nnot give up their power at Samhain, and the Unseelie go too far in their efforts to\nreclaim what they feel is theirs. This struggle creates an imbalance in the Dreaming.\nEventually, such as imbalance becomes too much for the Dreaming to sustain,\ncausing it to automatically “reset” itself to remedy the situation.\nA final option is that perhaps the changelings are not meant to be on Earth any\nlonger after all. Arcadia is their home, but they insisted on inhabiting the human world\nrather than staying where they belonged. This makes them invaders, and it is possible\nthat the Dreaming did not intend for them to exist so long outside its borders. Perhaps\nthe changelings themselves caused the problems simply by leaving Arcadia, thereby\nfracturing the Dreaming and making it increasingly vulnerable. This option is\nexplored in more detail in the “Starlight Exodus” scenario found later in this chapter.\nAny of these options could be incorporated into your chronicle, and they can\nbe used with the scenarios provided as well as with plots of your own making. Of\ncourse, if you decided that the end of the world was brought on by the assassination\nof High King David, then it would be most logical to say that the end of the world\nwas brought on by the fae themselves, rather than blaming it on humans. Overall,\ndeciding on a reason for the end of the world can only strengthen your understanding\nof your chronicle and therefore improve the results overall.\nWHERE IS IT TAKING US?\nSo now that you’ve seen a number of possible causes for the arrival of Endless\nWinter in your game, there comes an equally important question: Is everything really\ncoming apart at the seams? Is it still possible for the world to pull through, whole or\nin part? Will the approach of Endless Winter be something that leaves no Kithain\nor mortal unchanged, or will it be something that only a small portion of the\npopulation is even aware of when it’s over?\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Take your time and make sure you have a clear idea of what you want to see\ncoming, and most of all, think of ways to bring home these great changes as vividly\nand powerfully as possible.\nRemember also that simply because you know the end is coming, that doesn’t\nmean the characters have any idea of what lies in store for them. Armageddon has\nbeen “just around the corner” for millennia, as seen in countless apocalyptic panics\nthroughout history and more recently with the hysteria surrounding the turn of the\nmillennium. While events will eventually reach a point where even the most jaded\nand cynical Kithain must admit what’s going on, that still doesn’t mean your ending\nwill be an open book. Even the most knowledgeable fae scholars still have no idea\nwhat the end will actually look like when it comes. All they can do is read the ancient\nprophecies, look at the signs they see around them and take their best guess.\nTHE STATE OF THE DREAMING\nPerhaps the most important underlying factor in determining the severity and\ndirection of your game’s End-Time scenario is deciding on what kind of shape the\nDreaming is in while it happens. Although the Dreaming is generally presented as slowly\nwithering away, its contact with the Autumn world fading more with each passing day,\nyou do not have to use this model for your own chronicle.\nA Dying Dream\nThe more traditional outlook, this direction supposes that the Dreaming is\nfading, its powers weakening and its children grower ever closer to extinction.\nBanality weighs ever more heavily on the Kithain and their chimerical world, and\nthe approach of Winter is all but assured. Shunned and dismissed by a world that no\nlonger needs them, the fae quietly waste away from the sickness caused by the\ngreatest indignity their proud race could ever endure: being utterly irrelevant.\nThis direction is excellent for showcasing scenarios where the chimerical world\nreceives its final judgment mostly or entirely away from the eyes of mortals and\nProdigals alike. It is also suited to bittersweet tales of loss and separation, as the\nessence of what makes the fae truly wonderful gradually diminishes, perhaps\nallowing the characters one final moment of lucidity before their identities as\nchildren of the Dreaming are snuffed out forever… or perhaps not.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "150\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nOf course, the idea of Glamour fading away doesn’t necessarily mean that the\nDreaming itself is entirely destroyed. While many Kithain assume that the loss of\nGlamour on Earth would trigger the destruction of the Dreaming, nothing says that\nhas to be true. Even if you subscribe to the belief that humans forged the fae from their\nown primal dreams, that doesn’t mean their creations can’t have acquired a life of\ntheir own in the meantime, which might, in turn, enable them to survive the\nrejection of their “parents.” Perhaps Glamour does fade away from the Autumn\nWorld forever but continues to exist beyond the boundaries of its Banal confines,\nforcing the fae to flee into the Dreaming or face extinction.\nA Blaze of Glory\nBy contrast, the Dreaming in this direction refuses to lie down quietly in the face\nof Banality. While it might not undo the damage done by the Shattering, the fae\nexperience a surge of power as Glamour makes a final effort to remain a vital and\npotent force in the world. It might be enough to stir human belief in the fantastic\nonce more, staving off Winter or perhaps even bringing on a new Spring, particularly\nif the Kithain take advantage of the opportunity in time. Even if it is ultimately a\ndoomed expression of power, the results still mark the world in ways that the long-\nsuffering fae would have been hard pressed to imagine in days before the end.\nFae caught in the middle of such a chronicle might believe that a new Spring is\nindeed already at hand, though even if that is your ultimate goal, it is also best to show\nthe players that this newfound power alone will not carry the world to a new age. After\nall, if it was that simple to shake off Winter, the Dreaming could have done it long ago.\nWhile it might make it easier in some ways to achieve their goals, even a ready supply\nof Glamour doesn’t ensure that the fae can guide the Autumn World back to belief in\nchimerical reality. The hardest challenges must still be overcome by the fae themselves.\nNaturally enough, sudden surges of Glamour carry their own potential dangers\nas well. Aside from the wild and unpredictable changes that are inherent to any\npowerful exposure to Glamour, the mortal world is still unprepared to deal with the\nincursion of chimerical reality, and it might strike back harshly if the fae aren’t\ncareful. While this direction presupposes a certain amount of “shielding” against the\nforce of Banality due to the presence of such raw Glamour, having the Mists fall or\nchimerical world suddenly overlap with mundane reality is bound to elicit responses\nof fear and hostility as well as wonder and amazement.\nTHE FINAL SEASON\nWhen dealing with The Shining Host’s mythos, you have an additional\nadvantage to End-Time scenarios as well. Unlike many of their Prodigal cousins, even\nthose fae obsessed with the idea of the end of the world often can’t agree on what shape\nthis end will take or even if it will ultimately be such a bad thing. Vampires fear their\ncannibalistic elders and werewolves arm for their war to end all wars, but very few\nlegends detail exactly what the fae can expect surrounding their End Times.\nAlthough a Winter virtually bereft of Glamour remains the most popular\ntheory, especially considering the amount of Banality already found in the world,\neven that is far from the only belief. For every few doomsayers predicting an Endless\nWinter devoid of all Glamour, there is one equally determined sage who believes a\nnew Spring of renewed connection to the Dreaming must necessarily lie ahead.\nUnderstanding what these seasons mean to the fae and possible outcomes based\non either Winter or Spring coming to pass is essential for presenting an end scenario\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

While the fae might not be aware of exactly\nwhere they stand until all is said and done, they should be able to look back and realize\nthat the seasons have changed once more… even if only because they are the last fae\nwho will ever make note of that distinction.\nWHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?\nAfter settling the basic questions regarding the state of the Dreaming and the\ncoming season, it’s only natural to look to what the players can do about the fate you\nhave designed for their world. Remember that even though you might hold the\ntrump card in terms of plot devices and designs, it is still your responsibility as the\nStoryteller to make sure that the players are entertained by the ending you have in\nstore for them. There’s no reason you can’t have a tragic ending to your story, for\nexample, but if you do, make sure that the characters have a chance to make their\npeace with the world before the end. Or the opposite could be true, where they do\nnot successfully reach their personal goals but manage somehow to save the world.\nAlthough they will likely become world-renowned heroes, can they be content\nwithout being personally fulfilled?\nThat said, the scenarios included in this chapter should give you some ideas for\nways to make sure characters’ actions count in all manner of End-Time scenarios,\nfrom globe-spanning wars to local tales of hope and heartbreak. There’s no scenario\nin which a creative Storyteller can’t find some way to involve the characters in an\nimportant fashion, and if you can’t find a way to make it work for your players, why\nare you doing it in the first place?\nIn short, the answer to the question of what the characters can accomplish should\nalways boil down to “something important.” Whether that something means preventing\nthe end altogether, or just getting the time to say a special good-bye to loved ones before\nit hits, is just a question of detail once that truth is understood. It’s their chronicle as much\nas or more than yours, after all. Make sure the players feel as though they can make their\nmark as it ends, even if their characters won’t necessarily be around to see it.\nDIFFERENT SEASONS\nWinter\nLong Winter — A dark and terrible time when the fae will largely vanish\nand Glamour will be all but extinguished. A new Spring will eventually follow.\nEndless Winter — A world where the fae die out, Glamour fades away and\nthe Dreaming is cut off forever. The mortal world endures in diminished form.\nFimbulwinter — The ultimate destruction of both the Dreaming and the\nAutumn World, snuffing out all life and Glamour forever. Also used to refer to\nthe world if the Fomorians or other dark beings rise to claim it as their own.\nSpring\nMortal Spring — Regardless of the final fate of the Kithain (exodus,\ndestruction, etc.), humanity eventually enters a new era of creativity.\nFae Spring — Mortal society remains trapped in Banality, but the fae experience\na new surge of Glamour, perhaps by leaving the Autumn World, finally making peace\nbetween their dual natures or otherwise undergoing some great change.\nUniversal Spring — Fae and humanity alike enter a new Golden Age,\nhealing the rift between the Autumn World and the Dreaming.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "152\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nWHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?\nOf course, unless there’s no hope for any of the characters to survive what lies\nahead, there’s the inevitable question of what comes after. What are the possibilities\nin terms of the future of the changeling race? Can they survive, and if so, how? Can\nyour chronicle continue even though Winter has arrived? What would the charac-\nters be doing during such a chronicle?\nIf Winter is avoided, then it might be easy to assume that the fae should have\nit easy. It is important to note what happened to avert the coming of Winter,\nhowever. Did the Unseelie seize control of the fae courts from the Seelie in an effort\nto restore the balance? If so, will they relinquish control at Beltaine as they should,\nor will they take this opportunity to repay the Seelie for years of oppression? (It\nshould be noted that, if they attempt the latter, it is only be a matter of time before\nthis whole process repeats itself.)\nWere the changelings forced to seek shelter in the Dreaming, or did they have\nto reestablish ties with mortals in order to weather the storm? Did High King David\nreturn, and if so, is he in any shape to rule? Even if Winter does not come, the\npossibility certainly should have frightened the changelings into paying more\nattention, and if they don’t make some changes in the way things work, they\ncertainly won’t make it very far.\nIf Winter is averted, then there is clearly room for a chronicle to continue in the new\n(and hopefully improved) world. Perhaps the characters could help to implement reforms\nin freeholds throughout the realm or work more closely with mortals in an effort to maintain\nmortal-changeling relations. If Winter comes, the situation is entirely different.\nA chronicle might conceivably continue during the Long Winter, but this is only\nadvisable if you plan to have Spring come afterward. After all, your players want to have\nsomething to work for, and it would be rather discouraging to struggle through the\nWinter only to have the entire group die of old age and simple frustration without ever\nseeing the Spring. The first question to ask is whether the changelings are aware of\nwhat’s happening to them. Perhaps they are forced to retreat into their mortal seemings\nto survive, and their fae seemings reawaken at the coming of Spring as if from a long\nhibernation. Or perhaps they remain fully aware of the happenings around them and\nhave to seek shelter in their freeholds, the only places where a little Glamour is still\navailable for the taking. These chronicles could involve long, drawn-out sieges where\nthe fae attempt to hold on for years against an onslaught of monsters outside their\ndoors. Icewyrms roam the skies and Autumn People attempt to batter down their walls,\nbut the fae hold firm, waiting (and praying) for the coming of the Spring.\nOMENS AND PORTENTS\nIt is not necessary to include any or all of these factors as part of a build-up to unleashing\nhorror on your players, but you may find them useful to help set up an important plot point\nor underscore the drastic changes at work in the world. For convenience, they have been\nroughly divided along the lines of relatively minor or inconsequential phenomena, more\nserious incidents and at last the most dramatic and obvious signs that the end is here.\nFORESHADOWING: THUNDER IN THE NIGHT\nEven in the most direct and overtly disastrous scenarios involving Endless\nWinter and the final fate of the Kithain, there should still be a time of quiet buildup,\nwhere small signs and sweeping omens combine to paint a picture of what is to come\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Think of this phase as the bad dream a\ncharacter has the night before the events of the End Times really begin to unfold.\nIt’s that moment of hesitation before entering the darkest heart of the forest, when\nsomething just isn’t right, yet there’s no choice but to go onward.\nThe Red Star\nIn the summer of 1999, a new astrological phenomena appeared in the heavens,\nvisible only to the fae and their Prodigal cousins — a glaring red star. Soon dubbed the\nEye of Balor by the fae, its crimson light inspires dread and apprehension in all who gaze\nupon it. Its morbid fascination is made no less gripping by the fact that the star’s light\nis rumored to grow brighter during times of war, disaster and other periods of suffering.\nExactly what does the appearance of the Eye of Balor signify? While certain\nscenarios have a specific purpose for it in mind, generally speaking you have\ncomplete control over what its presence signifies in your chronicle. It could be an\nomen of doom, or it could be a sign of the return of the Tuatha de Danaan. The fact\nthat it gives the Kithain an ominous feeling doesn’t necessarily mean it has evil\nconnotations. After all, any period of great change is bound to inspire a certain\namount of unease, even if the ultimate result is positive. The best use for the Eye of\nBalor is reinforcing the atmosphere you’re looking for in your scenario. After all, few\nthings are as effective in establishing mood as seeing an astrological omen glaring\ndown at the characters from the heavens both day and night.\nDreams Deferred\nAt first it might seem a fairly humble concept next to some of the more dramatic\nsigns of Winter’s approach, but never forget that grave threats and disturbances to\nthe Dreaming are reflected on the sleep cycles the world over. And not just the\nKithain are affected either. Prodigals and mortals alike suffer as well when the\nDreaming is thrown out of balance, though they might not easily guess the cause of\ntheir distress. In scenarios where the Dreaming is dying or retreating from the\nAutumn World, it becomes harder to get restful sleep, and the resulting epidemic of\ninsomnia and related conditions adds to the ever-increasing sense of desperation\nthat haunts the world in its final days. Aside from difficulty in recovering Glamour,\nall living beings go mad if denied sleep for too long, after all, and that can add a frantic\nand semi-hallucinatory edge to games where sleep is ever harder to come by.\nConversely, some Dreamers and other inspired individuals start sleeping more\nand find it harder to awaken as the Dreaming slides into disarray — almost as though\nthe Dreaming is pulling for every last ounce of Glamour that it can get. Or perhaps\nit is granting its favored children a bit of mercy as it all comes crashing down.\nErrant Trods\nAs the Dreaming sickens and writhes, trods once familiar and reliable become\nincreasingly unstable and dangerous. Those fae with a grasp of Dream Craft find their talents\nstrained to the limit, and those without that rare and valuable Art are essentially at the mercy\nof the Dreaming as to where they wind up, regardless of where the trod usually leads. While\nthe Silver Path remains as inviolate as ever, travelers of the Dreaming increasingly find even\nthis road almost completely obscured by the surrounding terrain, as though the land itself\nwas actively seeking to lead them astray. At other times, it appears to fragment into hundreds\nof apparently identical paths, daring wayfarers to make the wrong choice and be swallowed\nby the Dreaming. Perhaps worst of all, fae sometimes believe they are following the Silver\nPath correctly, only to find themselves on a Black Path to the Underworld, a Green Path\nto a former Fomorian stronghold or some other twisted and ill-used route.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

All attempts to see the future automatically fail,\nregardless of the talent of the caster or the power of the treasure. Such attempts reveal\nnothing but blackness, as though the future is totally obscured… or that there is no\nfuture whatsoever. (Of course, if the Storyteller desires a particular image or series\nof images to be central to her particular End-Time scenario, she may simply choose\nto use these visions and no others as a means of foreshadowing.) Repeated attempts\nmight even damage the sanity of the observer, as she tries to comprehend a mystery\nthat no single mind was meant to understand.\nIMMINENT CHANGE: THE RISING STORM\nThese phenomena are clearly out of the ordinary, even for beings as used to the\nstrange and unusual as the Kithain. What’s more, no few of them have gone from\nmerely curious or slightly disturbing to outright dangerous for the unwary, and they can\ncause serious problems for those changelings caught in their path. Mortal society also\nbegins to change more noticeably, though still not to the extent of faerie society. At\nthis point, even the most obstinate or skeptical fae must admit that something is going\non. The paranoid and superstitious are likely to be nearly beside themselves with fright.\nTabloid Life\nAt this stage, humanity has definitely begun to notice that something is going on\nand even consciously begun the first approaches to confronting the truth of the matter.\nAccordingly, life begins to take on an slightly surreal or tabloid quality for many\nmortals, as even the more reputable news outlets begin showcasing an increasing\nnumber of stories about “UFO sightings,” “Bigfoot stories,” “alien abductions” and so\non. Devout mortals begin hearing more talk of miracles and visions throughout their\ncongregations, as well as an increasingly urgent amount of speculation about whether\nthis means that Judgment Day is indeed at hand. Even more skeptical mortals find\nthemselves becoming increasingly interested in talk of the End Times, as though their\nsubconscious minds are aware of something they can’t consciously admit.\nNor are fantastic reports limited to the nightly news or the ranks of the faithful.\nScientists around the world puzzle over such strange phenomena as bizarre atmo-\nspheric patterns, odd wildlife behavior and rising trends of mental illness and\ninstability apparently without any connecting cause. Likewise, a rise of missing\nchildren, runaways, school violence and gang fights begin as more Kithain are\nconvinced of what is really happening and become active in their local politics,\nthinly veiled behind such mundane concerns.\nWhile the vast majority of these stories are filtered through the Mists and the\nminds of the humans who witnessed them, particularly clever or insightful Kithain\nmight be able to piece together what actually happened to inspire such reports. Some\nglimpse the larger forces at work by studying enough of these tales.\nCantrips in Flux\nAs the Dreaming destabilizes, cantrips become increasingly unpredictable as\nwell.

Areas of high Banality become “dead magic” zones,\nwhere cantrips become difficult or outright impossible to perform. Worse still,\nAutumn People and other highly Banal souls receive the same protection, making\nthem nigh-unassailable with the tools of Glamour.\nConversely, unpredictable surges of Glamour might wind up generating results\nreminiscent of the mythic past, to the surprise and perhaps even the regret of the\ncaster. A pooka attempting to use Quicksilver to avoid a pursuing gang of redcaps\nmight find himself caught in his accelerated state for hours or even days. This state\nwreaks havoc on his metabolism and makes it impossible to perform delicate tasks\nor even interact with the normal world without incurring heavy doses of Banality in\nthe process. Likewise, a sidhe attempting to command one of her retinue with\nSovereign might find she has quashed all of his free will, leaving a near-mindless\nautomaton who exists only to obey her.\nShallowings\nPrelude to the weakening of the Mists themselves, fae find themselves confronted\nby an increasing number of “shallowings,” incidents where the Autumn World and the\nDreaming briefly overlap, often without warning. Although these incidents begin in\nmore remote areas, they quickly spread to include even the most heavily urbanized\nareas, causing a corresponding amount of the panic for denizens of both worlds.\nIndeed, these incidents are exceedingly dangerous for both sides, as creatures\nnative to the Dreaming find themselves confronted by levels of Banality they are\nunable to withstand, while mortals and even the occasional Prodigal find themselves\ntrapped in a world beyond their imagination, without any way to get home again. (To\nsay nothing of the problems caused by a manticore appearing in Central Park, or a\ngroup of children becoming lost in a Nightmare Realm.) Without Kithain or other\ncapable beings around to sort out the problem and find some way to return these\n“accidental tourists” to their realm of origin, most do not survive long in their new\nworld, making it a problem of particular urgency in its implications.\nJUDGMENT HAS COME: THE STORM BREAKS\nAt this level, there is no mistaking what is taking place. Even the most naïve fae\nknow at a glance that great changes are underway, and while not every fae believes in\nthe tales of Endless Winter, even the skeptical have begun to question their convic-\ntions as these powerful events sweep across the land. At this stage, even mortal society\nis noticeably different, with apocalyptic panics, religious fervor and rising crime all\nevident as the situation with the Dreaming becomes increasingly dire.\nThe Death of the New\nNever forget that while they might be most directly influenced by the gradual\ndeparture of Glamour in its raw form, the fae are not the only population that suffers\nwhen the energy of creativity begins to drain away from the world. With the\nwithdrawal of the Dreaming’s presence, the spark that drives the creation of true art\nis fast fading from the world. It might seem easy to dismiss this on the surface — what\nreal harm can come of a few frustrated artists? — but this loss of a sense of anything\ninnovative and new goes beyond the realm of just the arts.\nAs the connection to the Dreaming begins to fade, the ability of humanity to devise\nanything original goes with it, from fine arts to architecture to military tactics or even\ncriminal enterprise.

And without any outlets to help express pent-up\nemotions and ideas, feelings of frustration and anger begin to rise to alarming levels as the\nlack of originality becomes evident. Violent crimes such as rape, murder and assault begin\nspiraling out of control, and the suicide rate leaps to double or even triple the average as\nhopeless souls give in to their own despair in the face of this bleak world.\nMortals at this stage are near panic constantly, and mob violence is frighteningly\ncommon. The more paranoid or sensitive among them know exactly what is going on, and\neven the skeptical are aware that something Is Not Right, even if they can’t put a finger on\nit. Kithain and Prodigals alike must tread carefully, as even the kindest and most understand-\ning mortals are subtly on edge. Those who are already inclined to do so have no compunction\nwhatsoever about shedding blood or destroying property to get what they want.\nThe Mists in Flux\nAlthough the Mists are always something of a mixed blessing to the Kithain,\nclouding memories even as they shield the fae from the eyes of mortals, even this\nseemingly changeless factor begins to become increasingly unpredictable as the\nDreaming destabilizes. In some instances, the Mists begin to fail outright, leaving\nshocked fae suddenly exposed to the mortal world, their fae miens clearly visible to\nall who look on them and their cantrips as obvious as an amateur stage magician’s\ntricks. Even worse, without the Mists to shield the beautiful and fragile world of the\nDreaming, such naked exposure to the Autumn World is typically accompanied by\ncrippling doses of Banality as well. Such unlucky fae must quickly seek shelter from\nthe unforgiving eyes of the public until the Mists return to normal… if they ever do.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, some fae find the Mists growing too strong,\nessentially causing such changelings to be ignored by the mortals around them or\neven cutting them off from the mortal world entirely. Helpless fae find themselves\nwalking the streets alone, unable to make the world recognize them in the slightest.\nTheir most direct attempts to gain notice result only in a sudden rush of Banality as\nthey push aside the Mists and reveal themselves in their true forms. Even then, as\nsoon as the changeling leaves the immediate area, the Mists slide back as thick as\never, making establishing lasting contact impossible during the fluctuation.\nTroubles with the Mists become worse as time goes by. The periods when they\nfall or strengthen grow longer, until at last they dissolve forever and leave the\nKithain exposed to their worst enemy… or envelop the fae in their suffocating\nembrace until they are entirely forgotten by the mortal world.\nThe Tithed Ones\nNo good deed goes unpunished, so they say, and every bargain with the Devil will\none day see him call it due. While the commoner kiths long ago adopted the\nChangeling Way in order to hide from Banality in mortal flesh, the recent return of\nthe sidhe was much more abrupt — and according to some hushed whispers, much\nmore insidious as well. For when the sidhe return, they do not forge a human disguise,\nbut rather occupy a mortal body outright. While the effects are superficially similar\n(amnesia, struggle with Banality, etc.), the fact remains that the vast majority of sidhe\nare not the original owners of the bodies they inhabit. Of course, the nobles insist that\nthis is an agreement reached willingly, most often going on to suggest that the human\nsoul is ushered to the paradise of Arcadia in exchange for the use of their body.\nThe recent appearance of the foul and disturbing entities known as the Tithed\nOnes, however, would seem to suggest that a far darker exchange takes place.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

They claim\nthat the sidhe did not bargain with them, but rather cast their spirits into the darkest\nrecesses of the Dreaming in their haste to return to the mortal world, stranding them\nin a hellish existence until they were at last rescued. They do not reveal the identity\nof their “benefactors,” save that they provided the means to return to the world and\nthe power to take revenge on those who wronged them.

A mastermind in every way, Meilge has carefully planned the entire series\nof events down to the smallest detail.

If the characters don’t already suspect\nMeilge or Faerilyth of some wrongdoing at the outset of this scenario, it’s important\nto begin pointing them in that direction. Providing them with some background\nmaterial on the major players in the scenario, as well as some increasingly disturbing\nclues as to Meilge’s nefarious nature, is vital in building up the proper atmosphere\nof paranoia and mystery this scenario relies on.\nOf course, this is not to say that some of the more supernatural buildup elements\ndiscussed in the previous section can’t come into play as well, acting as increasingly\nurgent reminders of the onset of Winter or just to give the players a taste of what is to\ncome. The Red Star, Dreams Deferred, Prophecy Fails and Tabloid Life are all relatively\nsubtle yet excellent ways of conveying a sense of a world where something just isn’t quite\nright. The fact that the source of the unease isn’t easily deciphered is excellent for\nillustrating and elaborating on the layers of deception inherent in the scenario.\nASCENSION BY ATTRITION\nThe opening act of this scenario takes place following a particularly bloody and\nbitter series of battles during the current Concordian civil war. Should war not yet\nhave begun during your chronicle, it is possible to achieve the necessary sense of war-\nweariness relatively quickly, simply by having the simmering tensions erupt into a\nrapid series of extremely gory battles and/or a number of heinous atrocities. (Most\ncarefully orchestrated by Meilge to foster just such an outraged desire for peace,\nnaturally.) Chronicles already embroiled in the war can simply include such\nincidents as part of the ongoing story, with a minimum of interruption.\nShould the civil war already have come to a conclusion in your chronicle and\nsomeone other than Faerilyth have ascended the throne, it is still possible to stage\nthe early events of this scenario. Simply replace peace talks with a similar form of\npublic meeting, and much of Faerilyth’s arguments will still carry the requisite\namount of weight to achieve the desired result. Of course, should Faerilyth have\nalready ascended the throne in your timeline, the beginning might be unnecessary.\nNote carefully, though, that certain events must still take place in order to make sure\nthat the proper climax is reached later on.\nTHE WILLOW’S TEARS\nMeilge’s most overt plans begin at a peace council ostensibly called for by\nFaerilyth on behalf of her weary troops. Few arrive expecting anything\nstraightforward from one of the Eiluned, but they walk away from the concord\nspreading news across the land of an amazing development.

In a clear,\nringing voice marked only by discordant notes of sorrow, she says:\n“My husband’s greatest dream was to see his kingdom grown from the land of division\nand malice he saw as a child into a true home for all Kithain, where they might live happily\ntogether and prosper as true children of the Dreaming. He cared not for his crown, but for\nthe Kithain whose strength truly supported it, noble and common. And yet here we are,\nkilling each other over who may lay claim to a soulless piece of metal. I say enough. This\nbloodshed ends tonight. For one final time I assert my title as rightful High Queen of\nConcordia, not that I might further my own glory, but that I might finish building the dream\nmy husband began. So I swear, upon the soul of the Dreaming itself…”\nAs her speech concludes, Caliburn abruptly appears from thin air on the table\nbefore her. With shaking hands, Faerilyth lifts her husband’s blade, and to the\nastonishment of all, it accepts her. Combined with her impassioned rhetoric, it is\nenough to sway even the most cynical fae present, and soon messengers ride across\nConcordia bringing tidings of peace and rumors of the High Queen’s ascension.\nWhile doubts remain in the hearts of some, the return of Caliburn and its acceptance\nof Faerilyth quashes the vast majority of opposition. Several weeks later, a clearly\nmoved Queen Mab allows Faerilyth and her entourage to enter the palace at Tara-\nNar, and the era of a new, fully recognized High Queen begins.\nIndeed, all would be well, save for one small detail. Attentive characters present\nat the council or those with sharp-eyed contacts notice that Meilge, while apparently\nas compassionate and concerned as ever, radiates an almost imperceptible glow of some\nstrange Glamour at several points, particularly immediately before the reappearance\nof Caliburn. It was there and gone in a flash, but for that split second Meilge’s façade\nfailed and a most sinister smile became visible. Combined with some of the rumors that\nthe fae have certainly heard by this point regarding his dishonest character, this should\nbe enough to send the characters on the beginning of their search for the truth.\nThe reason for Meilge’s concentration is simple. Having had little luck with\npast efforts to confuse the mighty sword by simply ordering a drugged and beaten\nDavid to abdicate his throne, Meilge recently switched tracks and tried a different\ntactic. He allowed David to come out of his drug-induced stupor almost entirely,\nthen had David’s brutal handlers confront him with the imminent fact of his demise\nwhile simultaneously reminding him of his love for his wife.\nThe result was predictable enough for a Gwydion. Believing final death was at\nhand, David willingly passed his claim to the throne on to Faerilyth, this time in his\nright mind. The handlers then callously dispatched David’s chimerical form and\nreturned him to his iron cage. True to the High King’s word, this time spoken in his\nright mind, Caliburn was bound to obey and transfer ownership to his wife. The\npulses of Glamour visible during the council resulted from the use of the strange\ntreasures Meilge quietly employs to keep track of David and his handlers, timing the\noperation to achieve the most public and dramatic result possible. It was a near-total\nsuccess, with none save the characters or their contact the wiser.\nAnd what of the revelation of his wicked smile, even through his magical mask,\nwhich supposedly blocks all but the image Meilge intends to project?

He also takes pains to see that the public always sees\nher actions in the most positive possible light, while likewise occasionally slipping\nhis name into the background of such stories as well, always in an equally positive\nlight. Most tellingly, he quietly convinces Faerilyth to sign an agreement that states\nthat should sudden death or incapacitation befall her, Meilge will assume the mantle\nof the High King. Rattled by her husband’s disappearance and seeking only to\nprevent future suffering, Faerilyth does not quite realize what she has agreed to,\nwhich is exactly what Meilge intended, of course. Although he is ready to launch the\nmost dangerous phase of his plan at this point, Meilge takes his time, carefully\nsolidifying public opinion of Faerilyth as kind and virtuous, while likewise establish-\ning himself as a trustworthy and doting advisor. Fortunately, this hesitation also\ngives those fae who are investigating the conspiracy ample time to begin sniffing out\nsome real clues as to the nature of the wrongdoing at work.\nBLOOD SHED IN ANGER\nWhen he at last feels the time is right and his reputation secure enough, Meilge\nsignals his agents to perform their most dangerous duty. Having carefully overseen\nDavid’s gradual recovery from his earlier trauma and conditioned him to accept\ncertain beliefs, Meilge’s men have at last managed to break David to their will and\nconvinced him that his wife betrayed him in order to steal his throne. Just to be\ncertain of achieving the results they desire (for they know well the price of failing\nMeilge), the handlers implant several strong Chicanery cantrips in David as well,\nensuring that his emotions and senses follow the plan they’ve laid out for him.\nSo prepared, they set David free not far from Tara-Nar, carefully wiping all memory\nof his treatment from his mind and replacing it with an overriding desire to punish Faerilyth\nfor her “crimes” against him. They also take time to cover their tracks both magically and\nby mundane means before disappearing once more. It is in this state of mind that David\nsweeps into the palace, sending servants fleeing before his burning gaze until he reaches the\nmain audience chamber with terrified guards and courtiers trailing impotently behind him.\nRaw Glamour radiating from his every gesture, David approaches the throne as the\nassembled nobles watch in shocked awe and silence. His loud and nearly unintelligible\nranting echoes off the high stone walls. At first joyous, Faerilyth grows increasingly wary\nas he approaches, her cries of love drowned out by his infuriated rambling.\nEventually the gist of what he is saying becomes clear. David accuses his bride\nof seducing him, of bewitching him so that he would love her and of having him\ncruelly kidnapped and tortured when he discovered her ruse and sought to remove\nher from power. The diatribe continues until the two are nearly nose to nose,\nFaerilyth silent and unflinching, David livid with rage, the combined Sovereign of\nboth of them locking all onlookers helplessly in place.

David’s eyes widen, then narrow to\ndangerous slits, and he shakes his head in response.\nFaerilyth’s last words follow, tears running down her cheeks even as her voice remains\nfirm and regal. “Is there nothing then that I can say, husband, to make you believe me?”\n“You know our gifts are useless against the Eiluned,” David hisses, punctuating\nthose words with a sudden stab to the chest, the blade drawn so quickly it is little more\nthan a blur. Faerilyth slumps to the ground, human seeming mortally wounded, her\neyes never leaving her husband even past her death. At this time, Meilge steps forward\nand issues an immediate challenge to mortal death, to avenge his fallen kin — a\nchallenge that David accepts, hurling more invectives at his wife’s uncle even as he\ncleans her blood from his blade.\nThough a skilled duelist, Meilge cites their difference in age and appoints a\nchampion to fight in his stead, his new captain of the guard, the fearsome warrior\nLord Bayard Tyrael ap Eiluned. Despite holding the clear upper hand for most of the\nduel, David’s guard falters for a critical second, allowing Lord Tyrael to at last slip\na vicious thrust through and pierce David’s heart in one swift stroke. Several\nonlookers later attribute the success of this blow to a sudden hesitation on David’s\npart, a look of sorrow and confusion as though he had suddenly awakened from a\nterrible nightmare… but Meilge’s own rumormongers quickly quash such rumors.\nHolding Faerilyth’s body in his arms, Meilge tearfully announces that according to\nher own wishes, it is now his sad duty to assume the crown he had hoped she would wear\nfor many years to come, and carry on her work. So saying, he slips the bloodied crown\nfrom her head and places it on his own, then raises Caliburn to the heavens in salute…\nand the approach of Winter quickens its pace.\nNOW FOR RUIN\nNews of the transfer of power sends shock waves throughout Concordia. If the\ncharacters were not present at the palace when the fateful confrontation took place,\nthey quickly hear the details from friends or contacts at court, including the telling\nslip in David’s demeanor right before the fatal blow. By now the characters should\nhave uncovered at least enough circumstantial evidence of Meilge’s complicity in\nDavid’s disappearance, and they will have little trouble concluding that David’s\nsudden reappearance and violent outburst could only have been another part of the\nking’s schemes. Unfortunately, with Meilge’s ascension, they will need to accumu-\nlate enough damning evidence to accuse no less than the High King himself of\nmurder, kidnapping and torture — not to mention survive long enough to see such\naccusations carry any weight once they bring them to light.\nFortunately, the characters are not alone in their quest to topple the new High\nKing. Indeed, some rather unlikely allies will now appear to help them on their quest.\nWhile having David reappear and slay his wife in front of so many witnesses did a\ngreat deal to generate sympathy for Meilge and deflect questions about his rise to\npower, a number of Kithain across Concordia can’t help feeling that something\nterrible has just happened right under their noses. While the characters and their\nallies will have to work delicately and very carefully to avoid alerting Meilge’s\nubiquitous spy network of their activities, especially as his control over the kingdom\ntightens, there might yet be time to depose this foul usurper king and restore\nConcordia to its rightful state.

      "text": "162\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nOver the coming months and years (as long as it takes for the characters to build\ntheir case), Meilge expertly balances two roles. His public face of a grieving monarch\ntrying to hold his kingdom together against the growing threat of Winter, contrasts his\nprivate identity as a Shadow Court mastermind employing his Thallain allies and foul\nProdigal collaborators to ensure that Winter’s icy touch spreads slowly but surely across\nthe kingdom. Like all expert tyrants, Meilge builds his network of control slowly,\ncouching all tightening of restrictions or removal of freedoms in rhetoric about the\ndemand for increased “security measures” or the need for “uniformity of opinion”\nregarding the state of the kingdom. Most often it is a simple enough matter to send some\nof his own Shadow Court or Prodigal minions to stir up trouble or leave evidence of\nanother sign of Winter approaching. His royal agents then appear to “solve” the problem,\nfurther ingratiating him to the masses and making sure that his tightening grip is\nperceived as justified concern for his subjects in this increasingly dangerous world.\nWhile he once envisioned a simple bloodbath against the commoners he\ndespises, the immediacy of Winter’s arrival combined with his own dark intellect\nhave caused him to formulate an even more terrible plan for the Kithain. Meilge’s\nultimate goal now is to gradually usher in a kind of “controlled Winter,” where the\nfae depend on him and his fellow Shadow Courtiers for their very survival in the face\nof overwhelming fear and Banality. By using the Court’s connections to bring ever\nmore Thallain and other dark kith into the world to hasten the arrival of Winter —\nas well as claiming and hoarding precious Glamour resources in the name of\n“Concordian security” — Meilge hopes to eventually place the fae at his mercy.\nIt is an ugly cycle. The more Winter begins to manifest, the more frightened and\ndependent the Kithain become on him to aid them, giving him more power to summon\nmore of the very beings responsible for the season’s coming in the first place. Rather\nthan stave off the coming season of sorrow, Meilge hopes to turn it to his advantage,\nthus ensuring that none will be strong enough to challenge him. As for the rest of the\nworld… well, once Winter is well underway, perhaps they too shall fall in line.\nAfter all, Meilge is a patient man.\nHOW DID IT COME TO THIS?\nSince preventing Meilge’s schemes is extremely unlikely save for the most\ncapable and fast-moving motley, the question then becomes what can be done after\nthe unthinkable has occurred and Meilge ascends to the throne. Once Meilge is firmly\nin power, the task of deposing him becomes increasingly difficult, as leads turn cold,\nclues vanish and important witnesses fall victim to Banality (or more sinister ends).\nYet the failure to dethrone Meilge leads to a horrible consequence: a nightmarish\nWinter where the Shadow Court rules and Glamour is controlled by those in power,\nforcing the fae to live in servitude or face the denial of the very essence their souls require\nto survive. Should Meilge be victorious, Glamour gradually becomes ever rarer and more\nfrequently hoarded by the nobility for the “greater good,” while signs of Winter increase\nand the mortal world slides deeper than ever before into Banality. By the time the Kithain\nas a whole realize the trap they’ve wandered into, it is far too late to do much about it.\nWith the Shadow Court and their dark allies behind him, Meilge is nigh unstoppable,\na tyrant beyond all imagining for the new season at hand. Characters might form an\nunderground movement of sabotage and espionage, but it will take a great deal to turn\nthe world back to the way it was before, if it’s even possible at that point.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Aside from the difficulties of\nreaching such an august personage with a lethal attack, Meilge’s cronies will still be\ninsinuated throughout the halls of power, and his successor would be just as likely\nto fall prey to their poisonous machinations. At the very least, even if it did achieve\nsome positive result, the characters would be branded assassins and traitors, without\nthe evidence to back up their claims of Meilge’s sinister scheming. And if they have\nsuch evidence, why didn’t they try using it first?\nAssuming Meilge can be removed and a just successor appointed with a minimum\nof additional bloodshed, the fae still face a long and difficult road. Already Meilge and\nthe rest of the Shadow Court have done much to advance the approach of Winter, and\neven once he is removed from power that damage won’t go away overnight. Therefore,\nStorytellers have several options for the direction of their chronicles after Meilge has\nbeen removed. They can continue the tone of politics and intrigue dealing with the\nevents surrounding the ascension of the next High King or Queen, or they can shift\nto present more of a unified front in the face of oncoming Winter.\nA PORTRAIT OF THE NEW KING\nAlthough more complete descriptions for Meilge and many of the other\nluminaries involved in this scenario appear elsewhere, most notably in Nobles: The\nShining Host, Noblesse Oblige and Kingdom of Willows, a brief description of\nMeilge is included here for ease of reference. Storytellers are highly encouraged to\nresearch the other individuals involved in the web of intrigue as well as design their\nown unique personas to offer possible story hooks and draw the players deeper into\nthe intrigue at the heart of this scenario.\nKing Meilge ap Eiluned — While Meilge’s schemes and motives are discussed at\nlength, it is important to remember three things: First, Meilge’s mask is a treasure that\nallows him to lie with absolute sincerity, even when magically interrogated, and it\ncauses others to naturally view his actions in the best possible light (one reason he so\noften desires an audience). Second, as High King and a high-ranking Shadow Court\nmember, Meilge has legions of followers he can call on for all manner of tasks, and\nindeed he prefers to use as many intermediaries as possible in order to make tracing\nactions back to him exceedingly difficult. Third, those who confront him directly find\nhim a skilled duelist as well as a masterful magician. While he prefers not to dirty his\nown hands, he is more than capable of defending himself quite capably should the need\narise. He is a consummate mastermind, and he never makes a move without carefully\nconsidering what it entails, or how to escape should it go awry.\nGODS AND MONSTERS\nFor time out of mind, the fae have fallen between the cracks of the World of\nDarkness. Even since the adoption of the Changeling Way and the mingling of fae souls\nwith mortal flesh, the world of the Kithain has remained a distant dream from the human\nlands, the immortal games of the fae seldom but lightly stirring a slumbering world.\nAs some had hoped, the promise of a new Spring is indeed possible on the\nhorizon… but it will be reached only by cutting a bloody swath through the ranks\nof the Fomorians themselves.

This is a series of events that sees the mortal world and the Dreaming\ninescapably intertwined, with the primordial forces that shaped them waging bloody\nwar in front of a shocked and disbelieving world. Many fae feared that they would\nultimately fade away quietly to nothingness, but it seems that the Dreaming and its\nmost ancient children have other plans. Players in this scenario should feel as though\nthey are rapidly drawn into a series of ever-greater events, ultimately leading up to\nbattles that shake the very foundations of the chimerical world and mortal realm alike.\nIt might sound odd to say that such a powerful and world-spanning scenario\nrequires a great deal of attention to little details in order execute it successfully, but it\nis true nonetheless. Without first establishing a clear sense of rhythms of the characters’\nordinary lives as well as the early tremors that signal the approach of these earth-\nshaking events, players won’t feel the change nearly as profoundly as they should when\nthings start elevating to a more epic scale. Watching elder glomes awaken the Rocky\nMountains and commanding them to rise up and do battle with a nightmarish black\nserpent the size of a hurricane is impressive, sure, but if it’s the first thing the characters\nsee as they roll out of bed one morning, it loses a lot of the impact it might have had\nif they had known of the sleeping Inanimae or their dragon opponent beforehand.\nThat much being said, several of the buildup elements presented in the previous\nsection are useful for this scenario, particularly the Red Star, Dreams Deferred,\nCantrips in Flux and Shallowings. In addition, the Tithed Ones add some particu-\nlarly fearsome and nasty foes to the ranks of the Fomorians and their dread allies.\nIndeed, a brilliant flare of the Eye of Balor is the herald of the fall of the Mists\nand the beginning of the Transformation. By this time, however, the fae should have\na feeling that something immense and powerful is about to rear its head. The only\nquestion is which side it will be on.\nTHE MARCH OF THUNDER\nAlthough omens, rumors and other odd prophetic occurrences have certainly\nalerted the fae to the fact that something of immense magnitude is about to occur,\nnothing can really prepare the Kithain for the true opening act of this scenario: the fall\nof the Mists and the re-assertion of the Dreaming across the face of the Autumn World.\nThis series of changes is known as the Transformation, and it happens nearly without\nwarning, sweeping the Autumn World before it and leaving little unchanged in its wake.\nThis beginning is not subtle. Around the world, regardless of the time of day or\nnight, fae find their attention drawn to the heavens, watching in horror and\nfascination as the Eye of Balor grows to triple its previous size, its fearsome red light\ndominating the sky. All who watch are struck with a growing sense of dread and\nwonder, as well as a feeling of their Glamour stirring within them, almost like it was\nbeing brought to a boil. This feeling grows stronger with each passing hour until\nevery fae feels as though his nerve endings are on fire with anticipation.\nSix hours pass while the fae wait in fear and wonder, and then the unbelievable\nbegins. Without warning, a tremendous wave of Glamour bursts from the depths of the\nDreaming and flows across the globe, infusing the chimerical world with tremendous\nvitality and filling changelings to bursting with the energy of ancient dreams.

The chimerical world and the mortal realm are\nnot merely overlapping but actively merging, with the chimerical side clearly taking\nprecedence in all but the most Banal locations. Towering castles replace suburban\nhouses, city streets shift into fantastic fairy-tale avenues, and the most legendary\nfeatures of the mortal realm mix with the fantastic landscape of the chimerical world\nuntil a strangely perfect combination is reached.

With some searching, a clever Storyteller can find any number of\nsurreal paintings, bizarre photographs and dreamlike video clips that show players\nthe kind of mythic-modern mixture that their characters now see all around them.\nWhile chimerical reality has likely always looked at least a little like this to the\ncharacters, having them look at some new sources and telling them that this is\nnow what mundane reality looks like can really bring the change home, not to\nmention adding some excellent mood and ambiance.\nOf course, don’t stint on describing how the specific local environment\nchanges either.

No gift of science or trick of magic will\nprevent this sleep from overtaking a mortal once the Transformation begins.\nWhile it might seem a curse at the time, in truth it is really a blessing — the Mists\nare trying to give humanity time to at least subconsciously come to terms with what\nhas happened before everyone awakens to this new reality. Kinain are immune to\nthis slumber, and indeed thanks to the Augmen they approach the power of full-\nfledged Kithain in many ways. Prodigals with the Kinain or Faerie Affinity Merit are\nlikewise exempt from the enforced slumber, though they receive no other benefit.\nSave for those rare exceptions, however, the rest of the Prodigals are as helpless as\nthe mortals are to resist this slumber.\nAlong with the Transformation and the fall of the Mists comes a potent\nstrengthening of their faerie natures, identical to the first stage of the Augmen.\nGlamour becomes readily available as well, replenishing at a rate of one Trait per hour,\nand can be harvested even more quickly at freeholds and in the presence of Dreamers\nonce mortals begin to reawaken. Bunks are no longer strictly required to perform\ncantrips. As there is essentially no longer any distinction between the chimerical and\nthe Wyrd, all cantrips are considered Wyrd but cost no additional Glamour. Oaths\nsworn on the Dreaming carry more weight than ever. Not only do the consequences\nof violating them grow more severe, but those fae sworn to them feel almost compelled\nto obey them. Taking actions that go against the spirit of an oath requires a Willpower\nTrait per scene, and actively breaking an oath requires two Willpower Traits.\nOtherwise the fae is unable to muster the resolve to go ahead with such a heinous act.\nLastly, as the sleeping ancients of the chimerical awaken and the Kithain find\nthemselves stronger than they have been in centuries, Banality fades overnight to a\nnearly impotent force. The Transformation has essentially suspended Banality for the\ntime being, as the world is simply too fantastic for such utter disbelief to carry any true\nweight. The one exception to this weakening of Banality is cold iron, the fearsome\nproperties of which actually increase. Ordinary fae suffer twice the normal penalties\nassociated with its presence and do not willingly carry it without spending a Willpower\nTrait per scene to stay near the hated metal. Even iron-resistant fae such as House Balor\nsidhe and those rare individuals with the Merit: Iron Tolerance find it harder to be\naround the substance than normal. While they suffer no actual penalties to do so, they\nfind the experience distinctly unpleasant and avoid it if at all possible.\nHUE AND CRY\nWhile humanity yet slumbers and the Kithain struggle to regain their footing in this\nstrange new world, the real forces involved in the war begin to make their appearance.\nPOSSIBLE TWIST: WHAT DREAMS MAY COME\nStorytellers who are looking for an interesting variation on this scenario may\neven rule that mortals and affected Prodigals do not awaken until after the war is\nover, possibly even until after the last traces of the Transformation have faded (if\nthey do at all). While this choice significantly alters the course of the scenario in\nterms of humanity accepting the existence of the fae and their role in the world,\nit might be just the thing to highlight a particularly bittersweet ending concerning\nthe fading importance of the fae or the forgotten debt that humanity owes the\nKithain. It can simply avoid the complications caused by their waking.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

While the\nfollowing list is far from the limit of the available possibilities, it should serve to give an\nidea of the scale of the forces that begin appearing in the wake of the Transformation (not\nto mention the images associated with this rising). Ancient Inanimae cause entire forests\nor rivers to rise up and form bizarre armies. The Nunnehi Nations march, surrounded by\nthe spirits of fallen braves returned from the Higher Hunting Grounds. Hordes of fuath\nand fir-bolgs pour fully armed and ready from ancient trods and assembling into warrior\ncamps. This activity is not limited to just the Kithain and their cousins either. Legendary\nchimerical beasts emerge from their ancient hiding places and patrol their old territories\nonce more, reveling in their freedom.\nAs the ancient powers and hidden forces of the fae emerge, so too do the Kithain\nfind themselves almost irresistibly rallying. While the previous factional lines are not\nimmediately forgotten, the strange energies of the Transformation combined with the\nnatural need for some feeling of safety and solidarity in the face of such sweeping changes\nacts as a powerful inducement to bring Kithain together around the world. Naturally,\nsuch gatherings also quickly become hotbeds of discussion about exactly what is going\non, what it means and what must be done because of it. While different theories are\nrapidly bandied about, most such groups quickly come to the conclusion that some\nmassive conflict or other spectacular event cannot be far away, and preparations begin\naccordingly. Even relatively solitary fae or isolated oathcircles feel the call to join such\ngatherings. Those who don’t choose to participate still see the threads of Kithain society\nTRANSFORMATION AND THE AUGMEN\nAll fae are enhanced by the Transformation, in ways both dramatic and subtle.\nStorytellers should apply the following mechanics once the Transformation begins:\n• Any Traits received from one’s Birthrights, Frailties or sidhe House are\ndoubled. (Thus, a boggan receives the additional Traits: Empathetic and Gullible,\nand a wilder troll receives extra Brawny and Stalwart Traits as well as an another\nhealth level.) This benefit can take a character over his normal Trait maximums.\n• Kithain receive a free retest on any non-combat challenges involving\nAbilities they receive from a Birthright or House. (Therefore, nockers receive a\nfree retest on all Crafts or Repair tests.) Those who receive combat Abilities from\none of these sources receive an extra level of each of those Abilities instead, even\nif it takes them over the normal maximum of five Ability levels.\n• Improvements on “non-mechanical” Birthrights or House Boons such as an\neshu’s Spirit Pathways or goblin Mayhem are left to the Storyteller to adjudicate,\nbut roughly speaking, they function twice as well as normal and/or produce twice\nthe normal result. This boost applies to a changeling’s darker aspects as well.\nFrailties or House Flaws without strict game mechanics are likewise roughly twice\nas debilitating or inconvenient during the Transformation.\n• Kinain who are “promoted” to full Kithain by the Transformation should\nfollow the guidelines from the “Joining the Family” sidebar in The Shining Host\nPlayers Guide, pages 140-141. At the Storyteller’s discretion, characters with the\nMerit: Faerie Affinity may likewise become regular Kinain at this time, though\nthey receive no other immediate benefit. Prodigals are never changed into full\nKithain of any kind, nor can they ever have Glamour, Arts or Realms.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Some areas see fae dividing along lines of\ncourt, while others see nightmare fae such as sluagh and redcaps coming together under\none banner while more “benign” kith gather under another.\nOf course, this is far from a coincidental effect of the Transformation, as most\nlearned Kithain readily suspect. The fae are indeed being called together in\npreparation for the impending conflict, though whether it is by the wiles of the\nFomorians, the dreamlike urgings of the Tuatha or simply the Dreaming itself\ndepends on the Storyteller’s desires. Yet more discerning fae note that the gathering\narmies are not divided by seeming, kith, house or even Court. Indeed, even those\nwho would otherwise have met as enemies in times not long past join under one\nbanner without question, and old friends might find themselves bitterly opposed as\nthey join different alliances. Ultimately, unknown to the Kithain at large, the\ndividing line lies deep within the hearts of the fae. They must choose whether they\nwill stand on the side of the Tuatha and honor their ancient allegiances or align on\nthe side of the Fomorians and Endless Winter.\nThis period of division and shifting alliances lasts as long as the Storyteller desires,\nthough it should remain relatively brief in order to help maintain the atmosphere of fear\nand not just seem like another political power play on the part of the Kithain. Fae should\nhave just long enough to realize roughly what’s going on and perhaps align themselves\nwith a suitable group (if that is their wish), perhaps learn of how widespread this\nphenomena is or even engage an opposing group in a skirmish or two. They should not\nhave so long that they begin to grow impatient or drift apart. At that point, it’s time for\nthe real battles to begin and the true forces at work to make themselves known.\nENTER THE DRAGONS\nAny number of things might herald the arrival of the Fomorians in the world:\nsudden ice storms, rampant fear and madness through the local mortal population,\nunnatural animal activity, hordes of vermin and insects, et cetera. Regardless of what\nthe fae happen to witness, anyone with even a drop of faerie blood in his veins\ninstinctively knows the truth: The Fomorians have returned, and they have come\nto claim this world for themselves. Almost simultaneously, battle is joined across the\nglobe, as the armies of those loyal to these returning evils lunge for the forces\ndedicated to the ancient pacts with the Tuatha, seeking to wipe them from the world.\nCaught in the middle, humans fight both sides as best they can, though even they\nstill find themselves generally fighting on the side that they would choose if the\nchoice were given them.\nActual presentation of these primordial beings depends on the Storyteller’s\ndesires. Some Storytellers prefer to have the Fomorians felt as little more than a\nmalignpresencewatching over the conflict, occasionally manifesting through omens\nor bursts of unpredictable magic, while others wish to have them wade through the\nbattles alongside their troops, dealing devastation to all in their path. For the most\npart, however, this scenario assumes that Fomorians do not actually take to the field,\nespecially those beyond the rank of the White Court. Even in such an epic scenario,\nthe higher orders of the Fomorians are too immensely powerful to fairly pit against\nany Kithain forces. There is simply no way even an augmented Kithain army should\nbe able to slay them without grossly downplaying their power level and thus robbing\nthe scenario of a lot of its inherent drama. Truly dedicated and powerful fae could\nslow one down, maybe even injure it, but short of acquiring the Triumph Casque of\nSorrows, that is about all they can hope to inflict against these terrible foes.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "169\nCHAPTER FIVE\nRegardless of whether the Fomorians are directly present, the course of this\nscenario from this point on is relatively straightforward: all-out war between the\nKithain and the Fomorian armies, with mortals and perhaps some Prodigals thrown\nin on either side. How long the war takes and how detailed the war planning becomes\nis left to the tastes of the Storytellers and players to determine.\nThis is it, so don’t be afraid to pull out all the stops in describing the fantastic\nnature of the combats, the mighty magics being used or the sacrifices being made on\neither side. Whether it’s a prolonged war or a swift series of brutal and frightening\nbattles, the players should know at every turn that the stakes have never been higher\n— but neither has the chance for true heroes to emerge.\nPOSSIBLE OUTCOMES\nAlthough Storytellers are encouraged to allow their own battles to run their course\nnaturally, several likely outcomes to the war deserve special mention for Storytellers\nlooking to plan the path their conflict will take. Even if they choose to use a combination\nof elements from these outcomes or their own original ending, they might find the ideas\nand possibilities discussed here useful in crafting their own unique ending.\nFomorians Triumphant\nConsider this the ultimate worst-case scenario. Should the Fomorians gain\ncontrol of the Triumph Casque of Sorrows and employ it successfully on the\nbattlefield, there is very little chance of stopping them no matter what forces are\nthrown against them. The world takes on a completely nightmarish caste, and while\nsome Glamour survives the resulting Endless Winter, it is only the agonized\ndelusions of those poor souls forced to live under the reign of these terrible overlords.\nTuatha Victorious\nThough it is possible that the Tuatha do not actually show their faces during the\nconflict, the Kithain know very well who they are fighting for. Should the fae prove\nthemselves worthy through such determination and sacrifice, the Tuatha bestow\nupon them the gift of the Triumph Casque of Sorrows at their darkest hour. Victory\ncomes, albeit at high cost.\nMutual Annihilation\nWith all the heavy hitters out on the battlefield, it’s entirely possible that both\nsides wipe each other out to the last, especially if the war drags on long enough that\nhumanity gets to employ its remaining weapons of mass destruction as well. Having\nthe Fomorians and the Tuatha slay each other (presumably setting up others to take\nWHAT ABOUT THE TUATHA?\nDoubtless readers will have noticed that the Tuatha de Danaan have yet to\nappear as directly as their Fomorian counterparts. This is no oversight. While\nStorytellers may choose to have these ancient beings appear and do battle along\nwith everyone else, generally speaking this does far too much to overshadow the role\nof the Kithain, as a single Tuatha can easily accomplish what might take an entire\narmy of fae to do. This is not to say that they are not watching and perhaps even\nsubtly aiding their descendants. Bringing them too much to the forefront, however\n(except possibly for a mutual annihilation outcome), virtually ensures the Kithain’s\ntaking a backseat to the larger-than-life magic and heroics of the Tuatha. And if\nthere’s one thing the players should feel, it’s that their actions are making a real\ndifference, whether they’re saving the world or just saving their own hometown.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

In their haste to undo each other, they wind up losing\ntheir own lives in the process. Perhaps some Kithain survive to survey the resulting\ndevastation, even rebuild from the ashes, or perhaps the characters are among the\nlast to succumb as the fae are utterly consumed in the final conflagration.\nTACKLING A WAR OF THE GODS\nThis section covers several important angles to examine when running a\nscenario of such epic nature. While the outline offered here is certainly sufficient to\ncome up with an engaging scenario, these topics offer a number of ways to add even\nmore layers of depth and complexity to the chronicle. They also handle some\ncommon problems or concerns that arise in a scenario of this nature.\nHomefront or Front Lines?\nBefore the Transformation even begins, the most immediate question you must\nask yourself as a Storyteller is what kind of scope you intend to portray with this\nscenario. Will it be sweeping and epic or local and personal? Obviously, this scenario\nnaturally lends itself to epic battles and mighty confrontations, but that doesn’t\nmean that it’s a requirement either. Some players enjoy things on a smaller scale, and\nthere’s nothing wrong with that. Indeed, Storytellers can find a wealth of dramatic\nmaterial in stories centered around an oathcircle simply trying to defend its\nhometown during this time of crisis, which can make an interesting contrast to the\nworld-spanning events happening outside of the group’s small corner of the world.\nAllies and Enemies\nWhile other scenarios focus on a select few characters and their actions during\nthe End Times, the sweeping nature of this scenario means that the cast of characters\nis limited only by the needs of the Storyteller and the particular chronicle. Like it\nor not, no fae on Earth or in the Dreaming realms beyond are spared from this final\nconflagration. The only question is whether they choose to charge to the vanguard\nor stay behind and try to protect what is left of what they once cherished.\nNaturally enough, the very inclusive nature of this scenario makes it possible for\nStorytellers to involve any or all of the prominent canonical characters they’d like, placing\nthem on either side of the war as suits the personality in question and the needs of the story.\nSettling an account with a particularly hated enemy or rushing to side with an old friend\nor mentor are both excellent ways of drawing the players into the larger conflict without\nmaking it feel as though they’re being led around by their noses. Likewise, the desire to join\nforces with particularly authoritative or well-respected canonical characters can be a\npowerful rallying point to help the players’ characters find a place in the growing armies.\nTriumph Casque of Sorrows\nThis legendary artifact is likely to prove a turning point of the war, for whichever side\nfinds it first. Should the Fomorians obtain it, the Kithain have little chance to survive;\nshould the Kithain locate it and figure out how to use it, even the Fomorians can fall before\nthem. A small group of experienced adventurers (namely, the troupe’s characters) might\nbe recruited to search the world or the Dreaming in hopes of finding this fearsome weapon,\nparticularly if the odds begin to turn against the Kithain. They might also be tasked with\nintercepting a similar expeditionary force sent by the enemy before it can return with the\nCasque. Needless to say, should they learn of the plan, the Fomorian forces will stop at\nnothing to prevent the group from obtaining the Casque, which in itself should present\nenough danger to keep the group running scared for quite some time.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "171\nCHAPTER FIVE\nAFTERMATH\nFirst and foremost, following the last battles of the war, the Transformation\nbegins to reverse itself, particularly if the scenario involves the death of both of the\nancient races. While things do not completely return to the way they were before the\nwar, the chimerical world and mundane reality separate once again, accompanied\nby the rise of the Mists to separate the two. Faeries slip back into their mortal\nseemings, once again hidden from the world.\nThis process is not entirely successful at wiping the minds of humanity,\nhowever. Quite simply, too much has happened for humans to slide blindly back into\nignorance. And so for the first time in thousands of years, mortals are intimately and\nundeniably aware of the existence of the fae, although what they do with this\nknowledge, of course, depends on the outcome of the war. Should humanity\nsomehow be alerted to the threat of the Fomorians and fight alongside the fae against\nthem, victory might bring a glowing new Spring of cooperation between mortals and\nthe Kithain. A devastating loss is likely to incur nothing but bitterness against all\ncreatures of the Dreaming.\nPICK YOUR POISON\nCertainly, the Dreaming isn’t as strong as it was in the old days, or so the grumps\noften say. As science rose in prominence among the mortals, interest in simple\ncreativity and the power of dreams has slowly gone on the wane. Art and music have\nbeen replaced with geometry and physics. Some argue that the changelings have\nallowed this to happen.\nRather than spending their time cultivating and tending their links with the\nhumans, they’ve turned their gazes inward over the years, busying themselves with\ntheir internal political and personal intrigues and all but ignoring the humans that\nthey rely on for Glamour. Unfortunately, while their attention was elsewhere, many\nhumans abandoned their dreams for what seemed to be a sure thing: science.\nThis scenario examines what happens when reason finally takes over and deals\na terrible blow to the world of dreams. The two have been at odds for years, but now\nthe balance has finally shifted in favor of the strictly rational, at great cost to both\nsides. Without their dreams, the mortals can find neither rest nor release. Violent\ncrimes escalate as their frustration mounts. Without the Glamour such dreams\nprovide, the fae grow weaker and the Dreaming sickens rapidly. The Kithain are left\nwith only one option. In the wake of this great crisis, they must find a way to\nreconnect with humanity once more, or they will surely perish.\nUltimately, this is not a scenario about giant battles, Dreaming quests or\ndastardly scheming (though it could contain all of those). Instead, it is a scenario\nabout the power of ideas to either quash the human spirit utterly or elevate it to a\nwhole different realm of existence.\nBUILDUP\nTo a certain extent, the signs of this decay are already here. Changelings have lost\nmuch of their former power over mortals, the Dreaming is not as accessible as it once was,\nand Glamour has become increasingly difficult to come by. Foreshadowing elements\nsuch as Dreams Deferred, Cantrips in Flux and Shallowings can help suggest that\nsomething wicked this way comes.

The poison is yours to pick.\nThe first step in developing such a chronicle is to decide on a cause for the Rift\nand build it into the story. Perhaps the most compelling cause is a sudden break or\nviolent shift in public opinion that opens a great wound in the Dreaming and hastens\nthe decline of Glamour. In this scenario, life continues normally until a sudden\ndevelopment causes the Dreaming to violently rip away from the mortal world. Such\nan abrupt change would be noticeable, if not painful, to the changelings. What\nmight cause such a break? Remember that inspirational scientific advancements\nsuch as the moon landing serve to increase hope for the future, not decrease it.\nIn this instance, the discovery would have to show that something is impossible\nrather than possible. Perhaps scientists have disproved to the populace’s satisfaction\nthe existence of life on other planets, or the possibility of life after death. Maybe a team\nof noted astronomers announces that a giant comet really is going to hit the planet in\na few years after all, killing all dreams of the future in one fell swoop. Geneticists might\nfind an “extinction” gene in the human genome, which will guarantee the extinction\nof the race within a century. Or perhaps a group of prominent ecologists gives Earth\na final “time of death” in the near future, as natural resources diminish or pollution\nrises. Try to think of a suitably massive and compelling discovery that would quash\nhope rather than kindle it, and work from there.\nOf course, if a specific idea doesn’t seem to work, there’s always the possibility that the\nRift is the result of humanity’s overall despair, the weight of apathy finally reaching a critical\nmass that begins dragging the Dreaming down much more quickly than before. As this\nphenomenon becomes more and more pervasive, the Dreaming begins to react little by\nlittle. Glamour gradually becomes scarcer as humans stop producing it. The Dreaming\nslowly distances itself from the mortal world as mortals apathetically shove it away.\nRegardless of whether a specific idea or general indifference is the cause, it soon\nbecomes evident that something must be done to repair the Rift, lest the Dreaming\nbe lost forever. Eventually, the Dreaming completely separates from the mortal\nworld, and the changelings are left with a simple choice: to make do or find some way\nto reestablish that connection.\nFIGHTING THE FUTURE\nOnce you’ve sufficiently built up the problem and convinced the characters\nthat something is very wrong with the world (more so than usual), the next step is\nto call them to action. What can they do to turn the tide against something so\nintangible as an idea, so passive as apathy? While it is impossible for them to\nindividually inspire each and every person in their town or city, it is possible for them\nto start a reaction that would essentially do the same thing.\nRemember, it is the nature of dreams to spread from person to person. Dreams\nare alive, and simply hearing that awe and excitement in someone else’s voice can\nsometimes be enough to pass a dream along from one person to another. What the\ncharacters need to do is find a way to inspire enough people and reconnect back to\nthe Dreaming. Mortals want to dream. It’s the characters’ job to help them do it.\nDepending on the needs of the chronicle and the nature of the theory involved,\nit may also be possible to disprove the idea itself, or at least conduct further research\nthat ameliorates some of the worst of its implications.

Needless to say, this is a bad idea for several reasons.\nFirst of all, the scenario assumes that the idea has already been circulated at least\non a local level, if not nationally (or beyond). Killing the researchers won’t do anything\nto stop its spread, and it might even focus additional attention on the idea as other the\nkillings are investigated and other researchers learn of the work and take interest in it.\nHOLDING BACK THE RAIN\nOnce the characters understand what they need to do, at least in a general sense,\nit’s time for them to get to work. They can hunker down and try to wait it out, or\nthey’ll need to find a way to inspire a large enough group of people to jumpstart the\nDreaming and then protect that group while the Dreaming regains its strength. After\nall, those mortals will just be learning to believe in dreams again, and a major\ncatastrophe would only undermine their burgeoning hopes. This process takes time,\nhowever, since the local residents are likely frightened and dispirited by all of the\nchanges they’ve been witness to since the beginning of the scenario.\nRemember that, as the Dreaming draws farther away, the mortals have been\nincreasingly unable to rest. They’ve been without steady dreams and the REM sleep\nthat comes with them. Most have been feeling frustrated or depressed, or they have a\nloved one who feels that way. These feelings lead to increases in violent crimes,\ndivorces and general unrest among the populace. None of the experts can explain what\nhas happened or why, and as a result, many people feel frustrated by their inability to\nsnap out of it. Inspiring dreams among these people will be difficult at best, and it will\nrequire patience and effort.\nTHE AFTERMATH\nUnfortunately, if the characters have not managed to inspire a sufficient\nnumber of mortals (or whatever number you deem appropriate), the aftermath for\nthe story isn’t pretty. Having failed to find a way to rekindle the spark of hope and\ncreativity in the populace, the characters face a future increasingly devoid of\nGlamour, and they will be Undone before many more months go by.\nDAMN THOSE TECHNOCRATS!\nStorytellers, resist the temptation to have the idea be traced back to the work\nof nefarious Dauntain, Autumn People or even Prodigals. While such sinister\nagents might seize on the idea as a weapon to further their own Banal agendas,\nhaving supernatural forces responsible for creating the idea itself downplays the\nvery heart of the scenario, namely addressing the lapsed and troubled relationship\nbetween humanity and the fae. This damage won’t be undone by defeating a few\nvillains with simple swordplay and cantrips. It will take a renewed commitment\nto the once-proud bond between humanity and the fae to truly have a chance to\nmend the Rift and restore the Dreaming.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The Dreaming in their immediate area has survived and is fairly healthy. It\nrequires constant supervision and cultivation to maintain itself, though, and the\nmortals who live within need constant inspiration and protection to help them\ncontinue to produce Glamour.\nNot only was the local Dreaming seriously weakened over the course of the\nscenario (not that it was entirely healthy to begin with), it is also being eroded from\nthe outside. After all, the decay was not simply limited to this town or this community,\nit was widespread throughout the entire planet. While a few communities managed to\nwithstand and counteract it, particularly as the characters’ efforts spread among\nKithain and mortal alike, many other communities remain dangerously tainted by the\nidea, and the despair carried by the inhabitants of the fallen towns is a constant threat.\nTheir only hope is to band together with the other remaining fae strongholds\nand attempt to push back the grayness, to reestablish the Dreaming. The local\nchimera help as much as they can, but they too are marooned in your town, and while\nthey can help inspire the local mortals, they cannot get out either. But that is the\nmatter for another chronicle and another time.\nTHE GREAT PURGE\nChangelings have long speculated about their origins. The Tuatha de Danaan,\nsaid to be the ancient progenitors of the fae, exist only in legend and song, their motives\nand characteristics lost to time. Truly, the modern fae has no idea whether or not she\nis acting as the Tuatha would have wished. Most changelings would dismiss such a\nquestion as irrelevant, given that it has been such a long time since anyone heard even\na whisper from their forefathers, but perhaps these questions are not so irrelevant after\nall. The Tuatha de Danaan exist in the deepest areas of the Dreaming, unreachable by\nthe Silver Path. Mortal concepts such as time and space have no meaning to them\nthere. The Tuatha nobles have taken an oath to look over their wayward children on\nEarth, however, and they take that oath seriously. Periodically, they send scouts out\ninto the mortal realm to make sure that all is going as they decreed so many years ago.\nUnfortunately for the changelings, it isn’t. Before the Tuatha de Danaan left Earth for\ntheir homeland, they made a series of sacred oaths, and they required their children to swear\nto the oaths as well. One of the oaths was simple: The fae swore never to mingle fae and\nmortal blood. The resulting creature was said to be an abomination against nature, and\nfurthermore would prove to be the undoing of the Dreaming. As the centuries passed, all\nrecord of the sacred oaths was lost, so the changelings never knew that their existence was\noutlawed by the order of the Tuatha. But, now that the scouts have once again returned\nto Earth, they soon find out, and the Great Purge of the changelings begins.\nBUILDUP\nIn this scenario, the end comes quickly, heralded only by the appearance of the\nscouts.

The characters rush to the scene and calm the\nsituation, only to discover the creatures at the center of the commotion, the likes of\nwhich they’ve never seen before. The appearance of the scouts should inspire awe and\ncuriosity among the characters, then the appearance of the foreshadowing elements will\nlead them to the realization that the scouts might not be as wonderful as they seem.\nThe scouts need help, and if the characters provide it, they are in a unique\nsituation to figure out what is happening and take steps to prevent it. The scouts need\nsomeone to help them navigate the mortal world as well as to gain access to the fae\ncourts in order to make a full report to the Tuatha nobles. If the characters make\nthemselves useful enough, the scouts may decide to take pity on them and tell them\nthe truth: that they are scouts sent by the Tuatha de Danaan, and their report will likely\nresult in the extermination of all changelings.\nAt this point, the characters have three choices. They can attempt to persuade\nthe scouts to make a false report, attempt to recruit the scouts to their side or ask them\nto provide as much information and assistance as possible without endangering\nthemselves. Getting assistance from the scouts is very difficult, since they are both\nloyal to their superiors and understandably afraid of them. Depending on how\npersuasive the characters manage to be, the scouts might agree to help them outright,\nbut it is more likely that they will provide help from behind the scenes, by giving\nthem warning of the attacks or by providing them with a safe place to hide. After all,\nthey are acting in accordance with a sacred oath with the Dreaming, and to be a\nTuatha oath-breaker is a dire situation indeed.\nSTORYTELLING THE GREAT PURGE\nThe chances of avoiding a battle are slim to none. After all, it will be very difficult\nto prevent the scouts from making their report, and if the characters somehow manage\nto detain or kill them, the Tuatha nobles simply send out a larger, more powerful group\nof scouts to deal with the problem. It is possible to persuade the scouts to lie to their\nsuperiors, that would be very difficult indeed given the respect and fear that the scouts\nhold for their nobility as well as for the sacred oaths. Remember that, by asking the\nscouts to protect changelings, the characters are asking them to break a sacred oath,\nTHE SCOUTS\nThe Tuatha de Danaan have abilities undreamed of by the average\nchangeling, and as a result, no Traits are provided for them. The scouts\nthemselves are the youngest and least powerful of all of the Tuatha, and their\nyoung and relatively impetuous nature makes them somewhat more sympathetic\nto the plight of the changelings. Furthermore, they have had experience with\nmortals, while many of the Tuatha have not. One option that Storytellers might\nuse to impress the players is to give the scouts names from mythology. Perhaps\nthe scouts inspired a group of mortals during one of their previous visits, and an\nentire religion sprang from their belief. Certainly, the characters would be\ngreatly impressed to meet Poseidon himself on the shores of Myrtle Beach, and\nthis would help them understand the power and longevity of the Tuatha scouts\nlong before they learn what the scouts are.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The trods open more fully than\never before, and the creatures that exit the Dreaming are terrible in their beauty. So\ngreat is their power that the mortals cower under their beds, set out bowls of salt on\ntheir front porches and hang iron over the doorframes without quite knowing why.\nThe warriors methodically ride through the streets, slaying any and all of the\nchangelings in the world. They do not torture or toy with their victims. In fact, the\nmost horrible thing of all is the terrible sadness on the faces of the killers as they slice\ninto the desperate changelings, forever cutting them off from the Dreaming. Yet,\ntheir numbers are many and their loyalty unflagging, and the Great Purge takes only\na few days unless something is done to stop it.\nBut what can be done against so formidable an opponent? The Tuatha de Danaan\nare unstoppable to all but the eldest of changelings, and they have sufficient numbers to\noverwhelm even these changeling elders given enough time. Fighting the Tuatha is\nclearly a losing proposition. The only two options left to the changelings are to run and\nhide, or to attempt to convince the Tuatha that the sacred oath should be lifted.\nRunning is the easier of the two propositions. The one advantage that the\nchangelings have is their understanding of the mortal world, which could work to\ntheir advantage. By hiding in a place of mild Banality, the changelings might be able\nto suppress their fae seemings enough that they pass the notice of the Tuatha killers.\nThe scouts might even be persuaded to give the characters some assistance in healing\nor obtaining Glamour after exposing themselves to such a high level of Banality.\nAnother option would be to hide in the Dreaming itself. By traveling far enough into\nthe Deep Dreaming, the changelings might be able to hide their mortal seemings.\nAgain, the scouts might be persuaded to provide the changelings with a place to stay\nin the Dreaming if they decided to go that route. Either way, the changelings are\nrisking Undoing or Bedlam to avoid the notice of the death squads.\nThe last option would be to convince the Tuatha de Danaan that the sacred\noath is misplaced and is no longer needed. This would be a desperate attempt at best,\nand would require the changelings to prove that the union between mortal and fae\nsomehow strengthens the Dreaming rather than weakening it. How might one do\nthat? The example would need to show how the changelings create Glamour that\nwould not have existed without their influence. Unfortunately, the most difficult\npart might be to get the Tuatha nobility to listen to the argument. Such an effort\nwould definitely require the assistance of the scouts, and the chances of it succeeding\nare slim indeed. Why should the Tuatha de Danaan, the progenitors of the fae, listen\nto the arguments of changelings, who are nothing more than crimes against nature?\nTHE AFTERMATH\nIn terms of the aftermath, many different options exist. The first, and least appealing,\noption is that the characters did not survive. Perhaps they attempted to fight the Tuatha\nde Danaan despite the counsel of the scouts and fell to the Great Purge. Perhaps they\nattempted to hide but were unsuccessful. Or perhaps they attempted to sway the opinion\nof the Tuatha nobles but could not come up with anything persuasive enough to make them\nagree to lift the sacred oath. Regardless, this chronicle is over, correct? Not necessarily.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

It would be possible to continue\nthe chronicle with the same faerie souls. They could be reborn in the Dreaming and\ncould seek revenge there. Or, it might be interesting if they were reborn again as\nchangelings, in mortal bodies. That would certainly provide evidence that the\nDreaming supports the concept of changelings, even if the Tuatha de Danaan do not.\nThe new changelings might get glimpses of the Great Purge, and the remainder of the\nchronicle could examine how the Tuatha nobility react to the changelings’ return.\nThe second option is that the characters have gone into hiding. They might make\nup one of a few rebellious groups of changelings lurking in the shadows, waiting for the\nTuatha de Danaan to return to their home in the Dreaming. If they manage to remain\nhidden long enough, the Tuatha do just that. They leave Earth in the care of their\nscouts. This assumes that the scouts haven’t contradicted a direct order or have\nmanaged to hide any signs that they have compromised their oath. (Remember that\neven hiding the changelings likely results in a chimerical brand of some sort, and the\nscouts need to hide that mark or face the consequences.) This situation would be ideal\nfor the changeling survivors, since the scouts would be able to put them someplace safe\nand hide their continuing existence. Furthermore, Glamour and trods would be ripe\nfor the taking, since the number of changelings would be so greatly diminished. Travel\nthrough the Dreaming itself would need to be diminished or outright banned, since the\nTuatha de Danaan themselves sometimes travel the Silver Path on matters of business\nor pleasure. A chronicle of this sort could end with the establishment of a new\nchangeling society, or it could continue as the characters attempt to find a way to justify\ntheir continued existence to the Tuatha before they are discovered.\nSTARLIGHT EXODUS\nWhat if the end of the Autumn World isn’t the end of the Dreaming?\nThough few Kithain have seriously considered the possibility, the death of\nGlamour in the mortal world does not necessarily signal the death of the Dreaming.\nIt is possible that the coming Winter may simply be the signal for the fae that it is\ntime to return to Arcadia, or perhaps seek a new realm deep in the Dreaming to start\nREMOVING THE SACRED OATH\nWhat if the impossible does happen and the characters manage to convince\nthe nobles that the Sacred Oath is indeed misguided and should be removed? What\ndoes this mean for the changelings, and what kind of effects would this have on the\nDreaming as a whole? First, the Tuatha de Danaan patiently explain that the\nDreaming needs to have sacred oaths to strengthen its connection with the mortal\nworld. Without these oaths, the two worlds would gradually separate. So, in place\nof the existing oath, another needs to be forged. One possibility of a new sacred oath\nwould be to place mankind in the keeping of the changelings. The changelings\nwould be directly accountable to the Dreaming as a result, and they would be\ncharged with making sure that mortals continue to produce Glamour. Provided the\nchangelings agree to swear to the new oath, the Dreaming remains strong and\nhealthy. Conversely, refusing to swear to the oath would harm the Dreaming, and\nit is likely that the Tuatha nobles would order the Great Purge to resume if the\nchangelings do not agree to protect the Dreaming as they ought to do.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The question remains: Do they have the strength to leave behind everything\nthey know and seek a new destiny?\nOn a thematic level, this scenario encompasses some of Changeling’s core\nconcepts — isolation, alienation and the feeling of being orphaned in this world —\nand deals with them in an overt fashion. In the face of Endless Winter, the decision\nto leave might seem like no choice at all, but remember that just as some inmates\ngrow attached to their cells and afraid of the world outside, so too will many fae have\ntrouble cutting their ties to this world.\nLikewise, although it contains a certain amount of adventure and the thrill of\nexploration as the fae return to the Dreaming, Storytellers should remember that this\nis no more of a “happy” ending than any of the other scenarios presented in this\nchapter. Aside from the many dangers of the Dreaming and the potential heartbreak\ninvolved in the search for a new homeland, the fae will have to leave behind the\npeople and places they know forever.\nBUILDUP\nFirst and foremost, the Autumn World should grow increasingly hostile to the\nfae as the time of the exodus approaches, to the point where Kithain are finding it\ndifficult to live their daily lives in the face of rampant Banality and seemingly\nubiquitous Autumn People. The Death of the New element is an excellent way to\nintroduce the idea that the mortal world is indisputably in its last hours.\nThe enchanted world should also be weakening, though not to such a great extent\nthat a mass exodus will seem outright impossible when the idea is finally raised. The\nRed Star could even act as a navigational point later on, while Prophecy Fails can\ndemonstrate the hopeless nature of remaining on Earth. Shallowings also provide a\ngood way to show that something is happening in the Dreaming. It is also very helpful\nif the characters have dealings with or at least heard of Dice (see Kithbook: Eshu) and/\nor the Seekers of Lyonesse (see The Fool’s Luck), though not strictly necessary.\nPerhaps the most critical aspect of the build-up for this scenario, however, is a\nmore widespread form of the Gloomies, the yearning that grumps feel for Arcadia.\nCalled the Longing, that same feeling that they belong somewhere else, begins to\ninfect all Kithain regardless of age or Banality. Even fae who are asleep from excess\nBanality feel restless and increasingly consumed by wanderlust, driven to find a place\nthey cannot name but are compelled to seek out.\nSONGS OF LEAVING\nAt this point, just about all fae have realized that they are feeling an unmistakable\nurge to go somewhere. (Recognition of how widespread these feelings are and discussion\nof what they might mean is an excellent way to bring the buildup period to a close and\nbegin the heart of the scenario itself.) Give the characters just enough time to realize\nthat something large is at work, and then begin the first stage of the exodus.\nTHE UNKNOWN ROAD BECKONS\nOnce the characters have had enough time to discuss what might be happening,\nbut before they become too comfortable with the idea, rumors of a strange traveler\nbegin to reach them, a mysterious Kithain visiting freeholds large and small and\nleaving strange behavior in his wake. Fae who have spoken to him have apparently\ndone such things as sell all they own, disavow their mortal lives, even turn their back\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Some rumors whisper of darker chaos\nfollowing his visits as well, from suicides to vicious duels to uprisings against the local\nnobility, though whether any of this behavior stems directly from his words or simply\nthe reaction to them remains hard to determine. The characters might even hear of\nsuch strange goings-on in a neighboring freehold, giving them just enough time to\nworry about what his mission is or what it means to them before he finally arrives.\nInto the midst of all this curiosity and speculation, a wanderer approaches the\nlocal freehold (or if none is available, the motley directly). If Dice is known to the\ngroup, they recognize the Síocháin immediately. If not, a local sage or savvy eshu\nidentifies him instead. Even those who don’t know the legends of this elusive immortal\ncan see that he is exhausted, however. The trail dust is caked on his clothing, his eyes\nare bleary and his voice is cracked and breaking. He doesn’t arrive so much as slump\nthrough the doorway and collapse. While his condition isn’t serious, boggans and other\nsensitive kiths may fret over him for a couple of hours before he is ready to tell his tale.\nWhen he has had some time to drink a little and eat some simple fare, some of\nthe sparkle returns to Dice’s sad eyes. He quietly but firmly requests that all local\nKithain who are available be sent for immediately, as he has traveled far to make this\nannouncement and has many more stops to make before he can rest again. Until\nthen, he talks cordially with the fae but deflects any questions about his purpose for\ncoming here. If anyone brings up the Longing, his eyes grow darker and he simply\nsays that he has had the same feelings, but he politely refuses to speculate further.\nAfter the local Kithain have been assembled, he rises to his feet, brushes off some of\nthe dust and bows to the assembled Kithain, then begins to speak.\nDice’s exact words are left to the imagination of the Storyteller. While the\n“canonical” speech can be found on p. 41 of Time of Judgment, Storytellers should\nfeel free to alter his words and even the tone of the speech itself to suit the needs of their\nown chronicle. Even if they choose to keep the speech as presented, a difference in\nreading can still be used to underscore the theme of the chronicle in one simple gesture.\nDelivering it in energetic tones with a lot of dramatic flourishes is appropriate for a\nchronicle that is more light-hearted or adventure-oriented. A weary and sorrowful\ndelivery can take these same words and reinforce a more somber, bittersweet chronicle.\nRegardless of how it is said or what other information might be included, Dice’s speech\nshould include at least the following elements. First, the Autumn World is at last sliding\ninto full Winter, and nothing the fae can do here will stop that. Second, in the light of such\na revelation, the only hope for the continued survival of the Kithain is to leave for Arcadia\n(or another realm in the Dreaming). Third, Dice will use a treasure that can create a portals\ninto the Dreaming to help the fae begin such a journey, though only those who swear the\nOath of the Unknown Road will be able to enter these portals. (The oath is provided.)\nFourth, there is precious little time left before the journey must begin — enough for perhaps\ntwo or three full sessions of play is recommended, though the Storyteller may adjust this to\nsuit her chronicle. Finally, any fae suffering mortal death before the exodus will be trapped\non Earth forever, their souls unable to reincarnate properly.\nALL THAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND\nAfter Dice leaves, the local Kithain community is likely to be thrown into quite\nan uproar. While the sworn oath of such a powerful and ancient fae puts the truth of\nthe matter largely beyond question, things won’t likely be decided very quickly! Many\nfae are stunned at the implications of what must come next. While they were aware\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

For some, the idea of leaving is\nimmensely liberating (though that’s not necessarily a good thing). For others, it is a\ntime of fear or even anger at the mystery to come and the world they must give up.\nAside from any unique local or oathcircle-specific concerns that come up\nfollowing Dice’s announcement, there are several critical factors that Storytellers\nshould incorporate when running this section of the scenario. Without at least\ntouching on these bases, the eventual exodus will seem yet more abrupt and one-\ndimensional. It is only by giving the characters a strong sense of what they are giving\nup and how that makes them feel that the players will be able to play them honestly\nduring a time of such momentous change. Even if all that is done is a brief glossing\nover of some parts, having at least considered them will help flesh out the scenario\nin their minds, making it feel like a real goodbye rather than heading off on just\nanother (albeit prolonged) quest.\nDon’t be fooled. Despite the title, this section truly forms the heart of this\nscenario. After all, once the fae step onto the trod and begin the long way home, it’s\nreally more of a new beginning than an ending. Part of the trick involved in this\nscenario is that while Winter would eventually settle their accounts for them (if only\nby annihilation), it is truly the characters themselves who will decide what the End\nOATH OF THE UNKNOWN ROAD\nI pledge this day to prepare myself for the long journey home, and swear on my\nhonor and my faerie soul that once I take my first steps, I shall not turn back, nor shall\nI long for what is lost forever. I turn my face from the winds of Winter and set my eyes\nupon Arcadia, and pledge my life and my effort to reaching her silver gates for the final\ntime. I go forward with my heart confident, my mind clear and my spirit rejoicing, for\nI am going home at last. So swearing, with these words I leave this world behind.\nIn addition to giving those who are about to undertake the journey a sense of\npurpose and direction, this oath also provides certain benefits when traveling through\nthe Dreaming. The oath prevents the fae from being reincarnated back on Earth,\nalbeit at the risk of possibly having their essence lost in the Dreaming forever instead.\nIt does so by infusing a small talisman or other personal item of the character’s with\na unique purpose. Should the owner die, his fae spirit does not enter the normal\nprocess of reincarnation, but retreats into the item instead, remaining there until such\ntime as it is utterly destroyed or until the oath’s destination is reached. Objects infused\nin this fashion cannot be stolen, nor can they be destroyed short of powerful magic\nor the use of cold iron. Only small objects such as rings or necklaces are infused in this\nfashion. Weapons and armor never become foci in this fashion.\nAlso, should a motley swear this oath together, these trinkets immediately\ntransfer to other members upon the death of the owner, making it possible for the\nentire motley to reach the final destination, even if only one member actually survives\nthe journey. (The characters will have to wait to be reincarnated until then, but that\nis a small price to pay compared to being reborn on Earth during Endless Winter.) Of\ncourse, should a changeling die after swearing this oath alone or an entire motley fall\nalong the way, their essences remain lost somewhere in the Dreaming. While Dice\ndoes his best to search out such lost relics, there is always the chance that they might\nbe destroyed by some quirk of fate… or that sinister forces will find them first.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Whether the final days are spent in quiet merri-\nment and bittersweet goodbyes, or drenched in bloody feuds and mindless vandalism,\ndepends entirely on the fae themselves and the choices they make. In short, they\nreceive precisely what their actions deserve — which is at least as fitting and often\nfar more terrible than any sort of judgment from on high.\nTherefore, while the players shouldn’t feel as though they are becoming too\nbogged down in such details, do not underestimate their value or their importance\nto the success of this scenario. In particular, those parts dealing with saying goodbye\nto mortal society and the reaction of the Kithain themselves deserve extra attention,\nfor it is from those stories that the characters derive a great deal of their impression\nabout the end and what it means.\nKithain Society\nFor the most part, Kithain react to the announcement in one of three ways:\nrevelry, madness or sorrow. For some fae, the knowledge that the return to the\nDreaming is at hand is cause for celebration. While they do not deny that departing\nthis world brings a certain amount of sadness, it is a time of great rejoicing, for they\nare going home at last. These Kithain spend a great deal of their remaining time\ngoing out partying, holding “wakes” for the Autumn World and otherwise indulging\nevery earthly desire before the journey begins. Once-forbidden trysts become more\nnumerous and more open, parties take on a frenzied air of mixed joy and desperation,\nand even the most polite and tactful fae truly speak their minds at last. After all,\nwhat’s the harm in the stoic troll bodyguard finally confessing his love for his\nbeautiful sidhe lady in the face of a journey of great danger and uncertainty to come?\nOf course, this air of reckless abandon has its own consequences as well. Despite\nDice’s warning, many fae see it as a time to settle long-standing grudges as well. Duels\nbecome more common, and in particularly volatile regions, minor skirmishes occur\nas feuding factions take their parting shots at each other. Even those who don’t wish\nto take part in such violence might find themselves caught in the ensuing crossfire.\nStopping the violence before anyone becomes trapped on Earth forever might be an\nimportant goal for the motley, especially if the characters hold positions of authority\nor feel any responsibility to their fellow fae. What’s more, even if the Kithain don’t\nattack each other, they must still be cautious at this time, as many of the antics of\nTHE EASY WAY OUT\nOf course, there are some players who will ask that since all faerie souls are\nsupposed to return to Arcadia between lives, why shouldn’t they just kill\nthemselves and beat the rush? The answer to this inane line of reasoning is very\nsimple: No one really knows what happens to fae between lives, especially with\nsuch a tremendous cloud as Winter looming on the horizon. Sure, fae killed in the\nDreaming appear to have their spirits carried off by a strange purple flame — but\nnobody knows exactly where that flame goes, either. Though it’s possible fae\nsuicides would wind up in Arcadia, it’s far more likely that they’ll wind up back\non Earth, trapped in Endless Winter with their final chance at escape lost at their\nown foolish hands. For the purposes of this scenario, in fact, that’s exactly what\nwill happen, which should curb those with overly self-destructive urges.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Despite\nthe certainty of Winter and the terrible fate that it entails, some fae will still choose\nto remain behind, whether out of love for mortal friends and family, a sense of\nobligation to an important cause or simply because they cannot bring themselves to\ngive up this world. Still others might be afraid of the journey or object to it based on\ndeep-seated personal beliefs, sometimes even surprising their closest friends and\nlongtime oathmates with their conviction on the matter. For all the hope characters\nmight have of possibly returning to be reunited with their friends one day, most fae\nrecognize that even if this isn’t actually their final goodbye, it will likely be the last\none for hundreds if not thousands of years. Trying to talk one of these reluctant fae\nout of this decision, or coming to terms with the fact that they refuse to change their\nmind can be the focus of a number of very intense and very involving sessions.\nRescuing the Sleepers\nThere is also the question of what should be done about those Kithain whose\nfae spirits are still clinging to their mortal forms, yet hopelessly quashed by Banality?\nIt is possible to bring these poor souls along, though the Banality they carry with\nthem will make the going slow and the way more treacherous. (Not to mention that\nconvincing them to freely swear the Oath of the Unknown Road in their slumbering\nstate will be difficult, to say the least.) This is especially important if any of the\ncharacters know any mentors, patrons or even former motley members who have\nfallen to Banality in this fashion. Even if they don’t, though, the Storyteller can still\neasily involve the characters in a quest or two to rescue such sleeping changelings\nbefore it’s too late. A local noble might charge the characters with completing the\ntask as their final service, or a weeping childling might approach them and ask them\nto save their Kithain grandparent before the exodus begins. Given the tricky nature\nof involving these Banality-laden fae in anything of the Dreaming without harming\nthem or acquiring too much Banality themselves in the process, even one such quest\ncan prove quite challenging to perform. And time is short…\nOf course, there is also the matter of rescuing fae trapped in prisons and\ninstitutions in time for them to make the journey. Aside from the difficulties and\ncomplications inherent in any kind of jailbreak scenario, certain other questions arise\nas well. Apart from overcoming the Banality that surrounds such institutions and\ninfects their inhabitants, the characters have to wrestle with the implications of\nreleasing potentially dangerous or unbalanced fae. While many Kithain are wrongly\nimprisoned by mortals or even other fae, not all of them are. Can the characters really\nrelease a hardened murderer or a fae in the deepest throes of Bedlam, even for such an\nimportant purpose as this? What happens if the prisoner they free goes on to commit\nheinous acts before the exodus? Can they take that risk? Should they?\nAnd what of the Dauntain? To be sure, they are hopelessly lost to the service\nof Banality in this lifetime, but is that a reason to condemn their future incarnations\nto a possible eternity of suffocating Winter?

Arriving at the gates of Arcadia after a suitably\namazing and harrowing journey can act as a wonderful epilogue to a chronicle,\nthough it is still advised that aside from some powerful and poignant description\nStorytellers not try to continue the action once the fae have actually re-entered\nArcadia. Even in Changeling, some things are best left to the imagination of each\nindividual player.\nOur Own Place and Time\nAt the same time, some Storytellers might wish to avoid the idea of returning\nto Arcadia in favor of having the fae establish a new home somewhere in the\nDreaming. While the scenario was designed with a journey to Arcadia in mind, it can\nvery easily be changed to direct the fae to find a new realm instead. Perhaps Arcadia\nis poised to fall in a bitter war and some of the survivors have been sent out to gather\nthe fae to find a new homeland. Maybe the Dreaming simply desires that the fae seek\nout a new realm where they can establish the same kind of ties they once had with\nEarth. Perhaps like the Seekers, the fae are seeking the mythic realm of Lyonesse, or\nmaybe they feel that the Red Cities of Mars are the ideal site for a new fae society\nto begin. Different groups might even split up in pursuit of differing destinations,\nleading to competing factions or other unusual twists.\nUltimately, the reasons for mounting such a grand exploration are as limitless\nas the potential realms themselves. While Dreams and Nightmares offers a great\nnumber of possible destinations (not to mention places to see along the way),\nStorytellers should not feel limited to what is contained in that book when designing\nthe realm where they want the fae to eventually relocate. While creating an entire\nnew world for the fae to inhabit requires a great deal of time and effort to portray\nconvincingly, the reward can be well worth it.\nEarthbound\nThough perhaps rarest of all, it might happen that the characters aren’t the ones\ncrossing through the portal. They might be the ones wishing those who do farewell.\nWhile the final fates of characters who choose to remain behind are likely to be\nrather unpleasant, that doesn’t mean that the Storyteller can’t imbue them with the\ngravity and pathos they deserve. Even if it’s just quietly fading away to Banality in\nthe presence of loved ones, handling a group of Kithain who are facing the end of\nGlamour as they know it can be an intense roleplaying experience. Storytellers\nshould just make sure that players are well aware beforehand that there will be no\n11th-hour rescue. Provided they understand that, portraying the world at last\nsurrendering to the smothering chill of Winter can be as compelling as any journey\nthrough the Dreaming.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The Mayans said the world would end in 2012.\nRomans believed that 12 mystical eagles revealed to the founders of the empire the\nexact date when civilization would collapse around their ears. The Book of Daniel and\nthe Book of Revelation both pull back the curtain to show exactly how God’s wrath\nwill send sinners to Hell and believers to salvation. Modern-day doomsday prophecies\nsuggest that we will die by meteor, comet, plague, biological warfare, nuclear winter,\nterrorism or by a thousand other ways to meet our proverbial maker. We have predicted\nArmageddon time and again, and we were wrong each time.\nNot this time.\nHunters have a special relationship with Armageddon. Unwittingly, the\nimbued are both signposts marking the demise of the world and key participants in\nthe approaching doom. Those brutal taskmasters, the Messengers, seem to have\nchosen certain people to be their eyes and ears during the last days — perhaps not\nto stop the end of the world, but to simply diminish its impact. The very appearance\nof hunters is indicative that the end is on its way, and now that it’s all hitting the fan,\nthe chosen have to decide.

Alternatively, the Storyteller could choose one or more of the End-\nTime scenarios found in other chapters and put it into effect, distorting the events\nthrough the flawed and imperfect lens of the hunters’ perceptions.\nAnatural end quite literally involves the natural world going berserk. Earthquakes\nshatter cities, chaotic weather systems ground planes and sink ships, the ice caps melt\nand oceans rise over coastlines to drown humanity. The monstrous angle is seemingly\nput aside as the world veritably rejects its inhabitants. In a strange way, both monsters\nand human beings are on almost even footing before such large and terrifying disasters.\nEPIC OR HUMAN?\nAn epic Reckoning game hasn’t been touched on much in other supplements,\nbut a story set in the context of Armageddon is a good chance to finally play one. Epic\ntales unfold in grand spectacle, not with small steps. The imbued might literally go\nto war, assaulting a wizardly power base in a major metropolitan area. Shapechangers\nand bloodsuckers clash openly under a blood-red moon. The skies darken with\nspirits, and damned creatures howl over the wind. An epic tale involves hunters\nactually having a place in the end, not simply being anonymous participants. The\ncharacters themselves affect the course of the world, perhaps even whether every-\nthing is destroyed or humanity somehow endures. You allow the characters to take\ncenter stage as heroes — troubled heroes, flawed heroes — but heroes nonetheless.\nA human approach to the End Times is subtle. The world probably falls apart\naround the characters’ ears, but they’re not central to Armageddon itself. They’re\nstill the focus of your chronicle, but the story is personal. Instead of marshaling a\ntroop of Zealots against a bloodsucker stronghold, the hunters finally go up against\na long-standing, single enemy. They don’t go to the front lines to heal fallen\ncomrades. They try to make their neighborhood better in these last days. This human\nangle is a microcosm of what’s going on in the broader world. Chaos ensues and\neverything falls apart, but the hunters deal with only one small portion of the chaos,\ntrying to keep friends, family and themselves from being victims.\nIt’s also possible that epic and human styles can be blended. In fact, given the troupe-\nstyle play encouraged by Reckoning, this option might wind up being the best one. The\nhunters still have their human, inner story of making peace with loved ones and enacting\nvengeance (or salvation) upon long-elusive enemies, but this “small” story contributes\nto the larger whole. Personal stories contribute to bigger victories and apocalyptic\ndevelopments, and characters could be swept into events that never involved them\nbefore. And from there comes the chance for salvation or a “stay of execution.”\nIMPOSED OR SELF-INDUCED?\nOne of the questions that needs to be answered is what caused this? Armageddon\ndoesn’t just happen. Somehow, somewhere, there must be a reason, however inscrutable,\nbehind the coming of the last days. If the end of the world is self-induced, humanity is\nresponsible for bringing it down on everybody’s head. If it’s imposed, the cause of the end\nis outside humanity’s control and, more importantly, not humankind’s fault.\nIn a self-induced scenario, humanity brings about its own undoing. Perhaps our\ndark side was long ago made manifest in monsters, and now the damning repercussions\nare felt. It could be that humanity’s compulsion to dominate the world and tap its\nresources causes global death. Or maybe humankind has simply created too many\nhavens and weapons for the creatures and becomes a victim of its own handiwork.\nThematically, using this scenario makes humanity the architect of its own unmaking.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The good news is that perhaps there’s a chance to turn things\naround — which is where hunters come in.\nIf the end of the world is imposed, some outside force has levied an abstract judgment\non civilization and plans to destroy it for some reason. Humanity is essentially without\nblame. If a host of primeval vampires awakens and sets in motion a plan to enslave\nhumankind, the end is imposed. It’s not humanity’s fault if werewolves “cull the herd”\nand kill people or put them in slave-labor camps. Or if a conspiracy of magicians decides\nto assassinate major political figures in an effort to trigger World War III.\nULTIMATE END OR NEW BEGINNING?\nIn an ultimate-end chronicle, hunters fail at the Heralds’ task and the world ends\nin oblivion, never to enter another age. What’s the purpose of playing a chronicle\nthat culminates in annihilation? Characters who discover that there’s really no\nhope, no light at the end of the tunnel might feel that the only option is to eat a\nbullet. Or maybe not. Seeing that the true end nears, hunters might seek to make\npeace with the world however they can. This could mean reconciling with lost\nfamily, obtaining a long-sought answer from a reluctant monster, or driving a truck\nfull of explosives into a creature’s stronghold. It’s also possible that characters learn\nof the final end and refuse to believe it, continuing to rage against the dying of the\nlight. A strong sense of dramatic irony is achieved when players believe that the end\nis coming but their characters do not.\nOn the other hand, A new beginning is the intended outcome of Armageddon,\nat least according to the Messengers’ designs. Currently, the world is in autumn and\nthe End Times are winter. If hunters do their job, winter ends and spring becomes\nthe “new beginning.” Sure, the world is changed and there’s no telling how little of\nthe population might remain, but the point is that things don’t truly end. Storytellers\nusing this scenario might want to continue the chronicle in a “what if?” capacity,\noffering an altered world in the wake of the last days. This scenario allows for more\nhope than the previous option, because hunters can make a difference.\nTHE HUNT EVOLVES\nThe events that lead up to and demonstrate the End Times should be somewhat\nhunter-specific in order to get the message through to characters. That way they can\nsee it coming and act accordingly, rather than just be victims of it all like every other\nperson on Earth. Several conditions of being imbued, as hunters know them, can\nchange to suggest that something big is underway.\nEdges\nA hunter’s edges are among his few unprecedented tools available for dealing\nwith monsters. At the end, all bets are off and the circumstances of even the\nsupernatural are in flux. Hunters’ powers are already mysterious and frightening.\nAlmost anything could happen to them when any and all rules are broken in the last\ndays. Hunters might lose all of their edges as their connection to the Messengers is\nsevered, or the Heralds might seek to strengthen the connection, hoping to infuse\nthe chosen with a greater sense of purpose and ability.\nPerhaps each character gets an additional level in her primary edge path,\nincreasing her preternatural aptitude. Or maybe the Messengers go all out and every\nhunter is afforded the sudden opportunity to advance to the level-five edge in his\nprimary path. Characters whose goals and calling don’t compel them to such\nextremity might aim for more subtle effects, such as extra Virtue Traits that can be\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

If\nnot, are the imbued no longer “necessary” according to the grand design, their\nsupernatural arsenal weakened or even severed?\nHunter Code\nThe hunter code allows for mysterious, clandestine communication between\nthe chosen. Whether sprayed on a wall or printed in a classified ad, the code allows\na certain level of covert contact among the imbued. But it’s not learned, it’s intrinsic\nto the chosen from the very moment of their change. And that means the hunter code\nis a spiritual entity, another gift from the Heralds. What does the advent of\nArmageddon do to the code? Are hunters’ bestowed capabilities weakened, strength-\nened or do they simply become erratic? Does the code explode with hundreds — or\nthousands — of new symbols, becoming a full language? (Perhaps even a spoken\none?) Does it cease to make sense, becoming meaningless to any hunter who sees it?\nMaybe only those imbued with Inspired- or Exalted-level edges can read it, implying\nthat the Heralds demand powerful soldiers in these grim times. Perhaps normal humans\ncan suddenly understand the signs. Or worse, what if monsters can read it? What happens\nwhen the enemy can suddenly tap into the secret cipher shared by the imbued?\nThe Heralds\nNo hunter exists without the guidance of the Heralds. Some consider communication\n“from above” gospel. Others believe it to be little more than hallucination. One hunter\nmight have a constant connection, while another has suffered otherworldly intrusion only\nonce, at the imbuing. The Messengers exist beyond this reality, but they are still affected\nby it. When Armageddon builds and hits, the “transmissions” hunters receive are sure to\nbe altered. Perhaps all (or only some) chosen experience a disturbing escalation in the\nnumber of messages they receive (imposing or increasing Patron levels). It’s also feasible that\nhunters could lose points in Patron as their connection falters. Or hunters’ Background\nscores might remain the same, but the messages change. They become louder, more obvious,\nmore persistent. The communication comes across more clearly or transmissions are\ngarbled, meaning the messages are more inscrutable now than ever.\nOf course, those options are severe and might be over the top for your game.\nAlternatively, the Messengers might “visit” individual (or all) hunters instead of\nrelying on messages. These visitations can manifest as visions, hallucinations or\ndreams. Or maybe these entities possess hunters and make them high-Virtue\nextremists for a time. The Heralds might even gift characters with new and different\ncapabilities to offset or survive Armageddon. The chosen could gain two extra\nBruised health levels, or a hunter might be able to treat all damage as bashing damage\nwhen Conviction is expended to activate second sight. The Powers That Be might\nmake impromptu modifications of the hunter “blueprint,” observing the rule that\ndesperate times call for desperate measures.\nBefore you get carried away with such changes, however, remember a few basic\ntruths. First of all, hunters are not and never should be out-and-out superhuman. Period.\nWhile Exalted edges push that limit, they are the result of close communion with the\nHeralds and/or extreme mental disturbance, not just generic super powers gained from\na fortuitous chemical spill or lucky dose of radiation. Even in the End Times, hunters\nshould always pay for what they gain, whether it’s with their blood, their sweat, their\nsanity or their soul.

Even if you are running a Zeal-oriented scenario, that doesn’t mean\nthat your Zealots should gain all manner of benefits while followers of other Virtues get\nnothing. Doing so breeds argument among the players and downplays the seriousness of\nwhat’s going on while players argue about Trait totals and new powers.\nIf you decide to “ramp up” the level of the Heralds’ involvement with the\nhunters, it is important that the Storyteller and Narrators have enough messages\nprepared in advance to keep from getting stale or confused. It is good to have enough\ncommon themes present to keep the players from getting lost, but it is also important\nto vary the content enough to keep things fresh.\nStorytellers should also consider varying the medium of the Heralds’ messages\nto keep visions from getting too monotonous. Radio blurbs, scoreboards, baby\nprattling, pop-up Internet ads, bus destination signs and breaking news crawls at the\nbottom of new shows are all good alternatives to the usual trio of visions, voices and\nheadlines. If any of the characters know alternative methods of communication such\nas Ameslan or Morse code, you could consider working messages into these as well,\nSEVERING CONNECTIONS\nOne of your apocalyptic options is to sever the connection between the\nMessengers and the hunters. The end interferes with the hunter-Herald\nrelationship, the powers revoke their blessings, or the imbued are deemed no\nlonger necessary and are left to contend on their own. This severance is also\nproposed in other chapters in this book as other beings lose their connection\nto the source of their capabilities at the end of the world. If you decide to go that\nroute for the denizens of your World of Darkness, it’s recommended that\nhunters retain a thing or two.\nAny derangements a hunter suffers due to his imbuing or high Virtue\nscores should remain. Such ailments are imprinted on his brain.\nA hunter should always retain access to second sight. Once a person has\nseen the truth, there’s no closing that door again. Since Conviction is no longer\nneeded to “fuel” hunters’ lost powers, second sight can be handled in a couple\nof different ways. You can decree that the sight is always on. The chosen can’t\nturn it off (a la the Wayward creed), and it always reveals monsters everywhere\nthe imbued turn. The second option is to replace Conviction with Willpower\nto activate the sight. It’s no longer a matter of tapping bestowed reserves to see\nmonsters for what they are, but an act of inherent human determination. (Bear\nin mind that Willpower is much scarcer than Conviction, however, and harder\nto replenish.)\nWhile second sight can persist, hunters might no longer receive its associated\nprotection against monsters’ mind-, emotion- and fear-controlling powers. Acti-\nvating second sight reveals monsters for their true selves, but it no longer buffers the\nchosen from creatures’ supernatural capabilities. You may allow a limited version\nof such resistance using Willpower, though. A hunter with his Herald connection\neradicated might still have some strength to deny a monster’s influence. You could\nallow a Willpower Challenge (difficulty four Traits) for a hunter to resist a creature’s\ndominating effects.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

It’s\nalso possible that you just want to show bystanders to have had an important role\nafter all, perhaps foreseen or intended by the Heralds. Before the end, the\nmajority of bystanders remained on the sidelines of the hunt, but now they\norganize. They might go to battle with the chosen or form their own circles that\nassume roles and fill holes that hunters cannot. They can spread information,\nprovide support to wounded chosen, ground the imbued who teeter on madness,\nand exemplify what ordinary people can do.\nThere are other, more… extreme options, as well.

Perhaps they gain second sight or a single dot in a\nsingle creed path. It’s even possible that bystanders do not become hunters, but raw conduits\nfor information sent directly from the Messengers. What happens if bystanders lose all sense\nof self and identity and their personalities are subsumed by one personality from beyond?\nWhat happens when bystanders summarily lose their humanity?\nTHE CREEDS\nHunters are driven by their individual personalities, first and foremost, but\nsecondary are their Virtues and creeds. The imbued are people, yet their very\noutlooks and predilections establish guidelines and suggestions for how they react to\nmonsters and cope with the hunt. Creeds and Virtues derive from such identity and\ncan be used to estimate how a hunter might think and behave. Someone might be\nintuitive (suggesting Vision) or dedicated to protecting friends (suggesting De-\nfense), or if she is predominantly hopeful and good-willed, she could be an Innocent.\nSo what general roles do hunters of different Virtues and creeds assume at the\nend of the world? Do they remain individuals working separately from each other,\nor can they find some common ground and cause? Can they set their differences\naside, or are their seemingly insurmountable differences part of some grand plan?

And what happens when a Martyr starts to appreciate the end\nof the world and his place in it? Could a hunter of this stripe actively work to oppose\ntoo much good so that he can fully embrace his calling in this dark time?\nInnocents might be able to see some good at the end, at least in theory. While not\nnecessarily eternal optimists, many believers cling to the hope that something watches out\nfor the world. If they can honor and share that belief, maybe there will be a reward after\nso much tribulation. (And if not, isn’t making the final days better reward in itself?)\nInnocents can assuage people’s fears and offset the erratic, angry behavior of some\nmonsters.

If a\ngroup of imbued is about to sneak into a slave-labor camp and a Hermit sees the act as\ncontrary to Messenger desires, he might intentionally blow the hunters’ cover.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Men and women are chosen for the sole\npurpose of dealing with creatures by one means or another. But at the end of the world, what\nare monsters doing and how might hunters get involved to stop the beings? The following\nare ideas for creature activity in the End Times, whether as direct contribution to\nannihilation or as a result of it. Principle antagonists in your chronicle might have very\nspecific agendas for themselves and the imbued. Or perhaps they have particular goals based\non the Armageddon scenario you choose from those proposed earlier in this chapter. Other\ncreatures make their own final bids or exult in the end in their own ways.\nSPIRITS AND WALKING DEAD\nGhosts and zombies are intrinsically related. After all, most walking dead are\nlittle more than ghosts trapped in sacks of animated meat. The End Times are sure\nto send reverberations throughout the spirit world. Indeed, the recent influx of the\ndead into the lands of the living (which also signaled the emergence of the imbued)\nmight have been a sign of the end. Do spirits look forward to and help shepherd the\nEnd Times, seeking to bolster their armies with fallen spirits? Or does the final\nreckoning mean that even the dead will be judged and sent screaming into the void?\nStranger still, what does it mean if spirits and zombies don’t proliferate at the\nend, but disappear altogether? They go from hunters’ most common antagonists to\nnonexistent. Do the chosen mistakenly consider this absence a triumph, or do they\nsee it as the bad omen it is? Are even the dead able to die? Worse, did something\ndestroy them, something far worse than the very menace of the living dead?\nVAMPIRES\nThe End Times are chaos incarnate. Do bloodsuckers take advantage of it, or are\nthey punished by it? Why care about a few exsanguinated bodies when an earthquake just\ndecimated the whole town? Vampires can capitalize on such disorder and grow fat on the\nblood of the defenseless. Other questions arise, too. Do vampires reveal themselves to the\nmortal masses, dropping any pretense of secrecy, or do they have to remain hidden,\navoiding the mobs that fill the streets in search of the cause of society’s failure?\nMost important, how can hunters respond to vampire activity? Rather than\nreact to bloodsuckers’ tactics, hunters could be proactive and take advantage of the\nchaos to deal with their enemies. They might attack vampire havens or interests\n(corporations, warehouses) under the guise of “looting” or “terrorism.” Alterna-\ntively, hunters might see this as a time to build bridges. The Merciful might save\nvampires from angry mobs, and Visionary hunters might recruit the undead for\ninformation — or be recruited by vampires to get close to other monstrous targets.\nSHAPECHANGERS\nDo changers enter mainstream society? Do they declare war on humans, hoping\nto remove them from the world so as to truly save it? Or do the creatures hope to\nannounce their existence to ask for — or demand — cooperation in salvaging\nreality? Some shapechangers (be they werewolves, rat-men or cat-changers) might\ndecide to damn it all and attempt to hasten the coming doom rather than allay it,\nin search of a clean break.\nDo hunters attempt to stem the tide of beast-men with violence? Do they see\nthese aberrations and decide that the monsters have brought about the last days? Is\nit possible that the two could form a tenuous alliance? Both consider themselves\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Hunters\nhave some domain over protecting people, and werewolves have some domain over\nprotecting wild places. Would this commonality allow an alliance?\nWITCHES\nWhat could Armageddon spell for manipulators? Many witches seek out global\n“ascension,” which involves the masses suddenly awaking with belief and acceptance that\nreality is utterly flexible. Do these last days provide mages with that possibility? Can they\nopen collective human consciousness? Does cataclysm blast open the doors of perception\nfor every human being? Would such awareness allow people to see monsters for what they\nare and free hunters to operate openly? Could public understanding leave monsters exposed\nand vulnerable, making wizardly and hunter goals akin at the end of the world?\nUltimately, if previously ordinary people start awakening into magical powers,\nhow do hunters respond? Is the phenomenon indicative of the plague of monsters\nthat rises out of Armageddon? Are these newly made mages friends, enemies or\nsomething to watch from a distance? What if hunters’ friends or loved ones awaken?\nMORTALS\nThere are six billion people on Earth. Humanity has unwittingly had a\nrelationship with monsters for its entire existence. People are food for vampires,\nbreeding stock for shapeshifters, playthings for manipulators, sources of passion for\nspirits and worshippers for the infernal. And yet, mankind has remained ignorant of\nthe abuses that it’s suffered. We’ve been kept confused and ignorant, always left to\nwonder why a little voice warns us to be afraid of the dark. With the End Times here,\ndoes humanity’s place change?\nNow is the ideal time to shatter mankind’s ignorance of monsters. Any mystical\nveil that keeps people deaf and dumb might simply collapse, allowing the masses to\nsee creatures for what they are. (This wouldn’t be the same thing as hunters’ second\nsight, but a person wouldn’t forget or rationalize away seeing a man change into a\nwolf. He would understand it and be horrified by it.) This revelation might allow\nhunters to rally people to their cause. The outrage and revulsion experienced by the\nmasses could be harnessed and turned against the supernatural. But it could backfire,\ntoo. Fearful (or enterprising) folks, always afflicted with self-interest, might side with\nmonsters in an effort to pick the winning “team.” What can hunters do when regular\npeople, untouched by monstrous taint, stand in the way of their goals? Can regular\nfolks be spared, or must they become casualties of war?\nYou might have the masses remain in complete ignorance of the truth. Mankind’s\nlong-standing blindness is resilient, even when monsters and hunters act openly. The\nsupernatural veil might keep people blind or they might subconsciously refuse to see\nwhat goes on before them. The world is falling apart, but in “understandable” terms —\nearthquakes, civil strife, war. It’s certainly not due to “monsters.” It could be that\ncreatures still operate in the shadows. They conduct annihilation unseen, except by\nthe imbued. If monsters fear that warring in the streets will cause the human herd to\nrise up and destroy them, beasts will continue their secret maneuvers, now intended\nto save themselves at the end or to emerge as the new powers that be. And then, there’s\na certain comfort and confidence that comes in pulling puppet-strings from behind the\nscenes. Some monsters have done it for so long they know no other existence and can’t\nhelp themselves now, even when their doom is imminent. The result is a humanity that\nunwittingly remains controlled up until the last.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Armageddon is coming, foreshadowed through\nsecret warnings and premonitions. As Storyteller, you may use such tools as the Book\nof Revelation or Fyodor’s Apocrypha as evidence for characters that the last days have\ntruly arrived. Application of these interpretive signs gives an apocalyptic chronicle\nweight. Instead of being some random, haphazard affair, the end feels like something\nthat’s been planned by a calculating hand and has culminated for ages.\nHunters (those of Vision creeds in particular) might seek out such prophecy and\nportent in hopes of understanding and averting the end. Those without the\nbackground or access might not be interested in the signs of literature, but they could\nbuild theories based on news reports, public trends or urban legends. At first, these\nomens might not seem too serious, at least until they start coming true.\nFYODOR’S APOCRYPHA\nThe Visionary Fyodor is responsible for the rambling collection of prophetic\nmusings typically called Apocrypha. The Hermit Violin99 is responsible for putting\nthe collection together and disseminating it to the general hunter population. The\nhaphazardly termed “book” reads like a lunatic’s rumination on what it means to be\nchosen, what the history of the imbued might be, and where the future of the world\ncould lead. It’s this last part that’s potentially important to your game.\nFyodor describes many scenarios — both beginning and end — that could come\nto pass in an apocalyptic chronicle. A character with a copy of the book could interpret\njust about any occurrence in the last days as applicable to the warnings in the text, no\nmatter how coincidental or damning the comparison seems. You, as Storyteller, might\nwant to orchestrate events that match the prophecies. Do you follow Fyodor’s events\nto the letter, making them fairly obvious? Do you allow the events to occur but disguise\nthem behind metaphor and musing? Do you invoke one or two events but allow the\nrest to fall to the wayside, leaving hunters confused about what could happen next?\nWhat events from the book happen, and how do you present them in game?\nOMENS AND PORTENTS\nWritten prophecy or science alone doesn’t decide indications of the end.\nThey’re also inspired by superstition, perhaps passed culturally like urban legends.\nA simple omen, one most everyone knows, is that it’s bad luck for a black cat to cross\nyour path. The message is simple, direct and somewhat foreboding. These kinds of\nill-fated occurrences can pepper your game before Armageddon begins, and con-\ntinue to happen thereafter.\nSigns pointing to the last days could involve anything: a blood-red moon, a\ndrastic increase in crime rate, a funny taste to the water. And don’t be afraid to make\nit personal, going so far as to encourage players to explore their own superstitions.\nDoes an Avenger feel a sense of cosmic apprehension when his favorite sturdy\nweapon falls apart in his hands? Does a Defender who loses her good-luck charm\nsense some intrinsic warning? A Redeemer might freak out over the fact that no\nmonster has been able to look her in the eye for the last month, like they’re all afraid.\nA Wayward might be convinced that he has to walk out of each battle with a new\nscar. He’s come out of the last several fights clean, and that’s a bad sign. Shadows look\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Maybe local hunter activity seems overly frenzied\nand bloodthirsty. Almost any ominous event or trend can suggest bad tidings to\nsensitive imbued, hinting at what’s to come in a Judgment Day chronicle.\nHUNTER-NET\nEvery hunter is like a small piece of a riddle’s answer, written on slips of paper\nand cast to the wind. They’re all over the world, and each might individually hold\none tiny part of the truth. Each hunter potentially knows a little bit of the collective\nnature and the fate of the world, and each imbued has a different answer — some\nright, some wrong. Hunter-net is useful because all of these little truths can come\ntogether and provide a better (though incomplete) answer. You can also use hunter-\nnet to disseminate the “realities” of Armageddon. What one hunter encounters in\nSacramento is probably quite different from what another undergoes in Jerusalem.\nThe first might see a “plague of flies” descend upon his hometown, while the other\nwrites about a magician that spoke of the “approaching Lord of the Flies.” A\npotential connection emerges, but only a tenuous one that requires characters to\nexplore and research further. What clues to the end do different posters offer,\nwhether they know it or not, and how can those pieces be sorted out?\nHunter-net is also an excellent place to disseminate false or misunderstood\ninformation, or to lead characters astray about the truth of the end. What if the\naforementioned hunter mistranslated what the magician said? Or what if an extremist\nlike God45 writes a grand dissertation on the “cancer of the president” and demands\nthat the leader of the free world be assassinated? Could even the most conservative\nhunters fall in line with a madman’s online explanation of Armageddon?\nMONSTERS\nThis is the World of Darkness. Monsters are probably complicit in the end to\nsome degree. If they’re not the cause, they’re a symptom. It’s possible that some\nmonsters are able to give hunters insight into the architecture of the last days\n(intentionally or inadvertently). Granted, they don’t have to be right. While\nmonsters have their own glimpses, they should be far from the whole picture. But\nsuch suggestions can hold the seeds of truth and be springboards from which hunters\nsee more of what’s really going on.\nThe Merciful might learn from shapechanger kin about some awful “red star”\nin the sky that’s secretly the eye of an ancient beast coming to consume the world.\nZealots putting the torch to a nest of leeches might find blood-spattered graffiti —\nurban prophecy about vampires rising up against humans. A Visionary reading\nforbidden texts stolen from a demon could learn secrets about the end of the world.\nMonsters have their own distorted views of Armageddon and its causes, and\nhunters can be exposed to them, but the imbued must always remember the source.\nGod forbid that a monster’s insights into the end actually hasten the last days when\nacted upon.\nSCIENCE\nWhether it means to or not, science, does a lot of doomsaying. For every article\nor pronouncement that researchers work toward a new drug or cure, there’s a\ndeclaration that a meteor is heading toward Earth, that a new form of pneumonia\nspreads like wildfire, or that no country in the world is prepared for a biological or\nchemical attack.

This isn’t some guy on an island\nspouting off about a Great Dragon trying to seduce the moral majority. These are\npresumably erudite, academic individuals who hold “truth” in their hands. The\nquestion is, can you use this kind of fatalism in your end chronicle?\nYou don’t need to resort to such drastic scientific proclamations. An intensifi-\ncation of “weird” stories on the news might do the trick. You can use real-world\nexamples such as the strange half-extinction of honeybees a few years ago, outbreaks\nof hantavirus or cholera, or an increase in shark attacks. You can also make stuff up.\nWhat if birds start acting weird, attacking people like in Hitchcock’s film? What if\na prominent constellation such as Orion simply disappears from the sky? What\nhappens when dolphins go extinct, a new communicable disease is discovered or\ncrops across the Midwest are inexplicably wiped out? All of these things, which\narguably have scientific explanations, offer foreshadowing. You can use these events\nas imagery to imply the coming end, or you can have such tragedies occur during\nArmageddon as a sign that things have really gone wrong.\nDANGEROUS PATHS\nThe Heralds might not be the only game in town when it comes to patrons for the\nimbued. In the “official” World of Darkness, the Heralds have attempted to offer enough\npower to select members of humanity to let them put the world back into balance without\ngranting them so much power that they become corrupt (thus a part of the problem). If\nthe Storyteller is willing to add another element to her saga, this attention on the part\nof the Messengers might also draw the attention, and intervention, of other, more\nextreme powers: the divine, the corrupt or even the power of human potential unleashed.\nImbued characters do not lightly come to follow any of these paths. Only those\nwho reach the pinnacle of their Virtues or somehow come to the direct attention of\nthese entities (Storyteller’s discretion) have any chance of reaching this status, and\neven then, it is not guaranteed. Storytellers should make sure that suitable roleplaying\nand soul-searching accompanies any potential “conversions.” They should also strip\na character of this status if he sought it for power as opposed to a way to express a\nfitting character development.\nSee the tabletop sourcebook Hunter: Fall From Grace for more on these types\nof imbued and how they come to arrive in these extreme situations.\nDIVINE INSPIRATION\nAs unknowable as the Heralds are, they stand as far beneath these forces of pure\ndivinity as mortals stand beneath them. These divine forces choose only the\nworthiest and most dedicated of hunters — those who qualify for an Exalted-level\nedge and pass the ordeals set by the divine spirits without losing their ways. The\ncombination of divine tests and the derangements accrued acquiring 10 primary\nVirtue Traits usually produce hunters who are alienated from humanity in general,\nand often from the rest of the imbued as well. Do not mistake these divine spirits for\ncherubic guardian angels. Their goals and methods are beyond human morality, and\ntheir servants are perforce drawn from it as well.\nThose who qualify for divine patronage receive a flood of communication from\nthe Ministers and above in whatever form the hunter’s mind can fathom.

Of\ncourse, this is a book about the end of the world, so it’s all relative.\nDivine Edge: Servants of the divine gain a single divine edge. This edge is of\nExalted level and can be designed by the Storyteller, adapted from Fall From Grace\nor taken from the existing edges in Laws of the Reckoning. (A sample divine edge\nis provided.) Since divine edges are direct outpourings of divine power, they are\ndifferent from conventional edges. They are generally quite obvious, with light and/\nor thunder that anyone nearby will notice. Divine edges affect everyone equally —\ndistinctions of monsters, imbued and mortal are too subtle for these forces. Divine\nedges cost four Conviction Traits instead of two.\nPatron: Those who accept divine patronage receive Patron x 5, and start\nreceiving direct commands from beyond.\nDivine Aura: All other imbued within three paces of the character receive\nspillover messages from the Ministers as if they had Patron x 3. If these characters\nalready have three or more Patron Traits, they notice that the “volume” of the messages\nseems to be a little louder when they are near the divine hunter.\nConviction: If the hunter’s starting Conviction rating is less than 4, it is\npermanently raised to 4.\nPersonality: Nature and Demeanor become the same and must be chosen from\nAutocrat, Dreamer or Fanatic.\nDerangement: The hunter’s player must pick a derangement that best encap-\nsulates his character. Any other derangements no longer affect him, but this one\nremains and can no longer be suppressed by expending Willpower Traits. Even edges\ncannot calm his raging mind.\nWillpower: Simple, human victories no longer matter. The divine hunter\nregains Willpower Traits only from acting according to her new Nature and from\nachieving important victories in the path set by his divine patrons.\nINFERNAL CORRUPTION\nDangerous entities, cast from this universe by the divine forces, compose the\nother side of the battle. Filled with hatred for the worlds and people that spurned them,\nthey offer power to those who can do their work and prepare everything for their return,\nbit by bit. The forces of corruption will accept anyone who has the ability to further\ntheir goals and who allows them into their hearts — again, those who qualify for an\nExalted-level edge, as well as being open to what they offer. Typically, these creatures\napproach the imbued in a manner similar to the Heralds, but offering something\ndifferent — be it extra pain for the monsters, fewer problems with pylons or just the\nability to kick more ass. If the hunter refuses the offer, the corrupter might seek easier\nprey elsewhere or just wait and see if the hunter comes around. If the hunter agrees, he\nimmediately gains the horrific patronage of a corrupt master.\nShould an imbued accept this offer, he has access to the promised edge, but the\ncorrupting presence gains a toehold within his soul. The portion of the entity that\noccupies the demon is relatively minor. Killing the hunter is only enough to cause\nit temporary pain. It can see through the hunter and communicate with him as long\nas he does not have second sight active. As the relationship continues, the corrupter\nslowly increases its loathsome demands, both to break down the hunter’s resistance\nand to further its personal agenda.

Because of their alien origin, corrupt edges are different from conven-\ntional edges. They can do things completely unlike other edges such as raise the dead,\nwarp reality and alter the hunter’s form. They are not subtle, and they instill horror and\nrevulsion in unprotected witnesses. Corrupt edges affect everyone equally, monsters,\nimbued and mortal alike. Corrupt edges cost four Conviction Traits instead of two.\nPatron: The possessing creature acts as Patron x 5 for the hunter, but the hunter\nloses all communication with the Heralds.\nSecond Sight: While he is using second sight, the corrupting presence is incapable\nof perceiving or affecting him in any way (including granting the corrupt edge).\nTaint: The corrupt hunter now registers as “wrong” to second sight and is affected\nby edges such as Ward that work on monsters. As the corruption spreads, the Storyteller\nmay declare that there are other signs of his fallen nature. This is permanent. Should\nthe corrupt hunter manage to expel her patron, the taint remains.\nRevulsion: Communion with such a malignant presence is more than the mortal\nmind can handle. At the end of any scene in which the hunter interacts extensively\nwith the corrupter or uses her corrupt edge, the player must make a Willpower\nChallenge against a difficulty of four Traits. Should she fail the test, she loses one\npermanent Willpower Trait as her mind succumbs to this assault. When the hunter\nloses her last Willpower Trait, her soul is destroyed and the horrific presence takes\ncommand of her body. Willpower may be spent to retest this challenge.\nHUMAN POTENTIAL\nAs terrifying as divine and corrupt hunters are, certain imbued take an even\nmore extreme path: the path of the independent. Independent hunters are unwilling\nto become a conduit for divine or corrupt forces — or, rarely, no one ever thought\nto ask — but they have the same fanatical drive (and 10 primary Virtue Traits and\na derangement). These hunters become the hunt incarnate and transcend the\nlimitations the Heralds normally place upon their servants in the process. While the\nbreakthrough itself should be a dramatic event, the steps leading to it can take place\nover as long a time as the chronicle allows.\nFirst, the hunter’s Nature becomes either Autocrat, Fanatic or Perfectionist as the\nhunt itself consumes the hunter. Later, his Demeanor changes to match his nature as\nhe stops devoting the effort to hiding what he is. Then, after the character has\nestablished his ultimate commitment to stopping the monsters, something happens —\nsome critical event that the hunter has to act upon, but for all his power, cannot. At\nthat moment, through a supreme act of will, he forces his way through to a higher level\nof power and understanding. Once that happens, the following conditions apply:\nExaltedEdge: The hunter gains use of a single Exalted-level edge. This edge can\nbe designed by the Storyteller for the character or adapted from the existing edges\nin Laws of the Reckoning, but it must be appropriate to the hunter’s creed and\nNature. It was his commitment to the creed that brought him to this point.\nPatron: The experience of transcending the Messengers’ limitations shatters\nthe hunter’s natural barriers, giving him an effective Patron x 5. This increase does\nnot represent any additional attention from the Heralds, though, merely an increase\nin the imbued’s sensitivity to their messages and visions.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The old\norder is gone, and with it the need for restraint. Now is the time to rise up and take\nthe bastards down, cleansing the city — and perhaps the world — of evil.\n“Cleansing Fires” is a scenario that emphasizes the Zeal Virtue. In the final days,\nthe monsters and supernatural creatures grow desperate, throwing away their\ndisguises and political power struggles. Now they fight for survival any way they can.\nThe characters have a chance to throw the monsters down and prevent their\nsurvival, clearing their city of the supernatural so that predation and horror finally\ncease. Negotiation and redemption are no longer priorities — it’s all-out war. This\nis a straightforward, fairly linear story of warfare. Complexity doesn’t derive from\nevents, it arises from the personalities and actions of the hunters themselves, and\nfrom the choices they make.\nTHINGS FALL APART\nSociety has collapsed. The corruption of the supernatural, hidden under the\nskin of civilization for so long, has finally burst forth and infected reality. Undead\nhordes rampage through the streets, killing and destroying in mindless rage.\nVampires wage war with each other over precious blood and slaves. Witches throw\noff their guise of normality and attempt to win over armies of acolytes in their quest\nfor ultimate power. Monsters and nightmares rip cities apart and murder thousands,\neven millions, in pursuit of incomprehensible horror. The truth is revealed, showing\nthe sick and impossible face behind the lies.\nGovernment, business and society crumble with the revelation of the super-\nnatural. Riots and mass suicides are just the start. What really causes society’s\ndownfall is the disintegration of its support structure as hysterical and angry citizens\nstop obeying the rules and believing in the law. Like a nation that’s lost a war, society\nlies in ruins, and formerly happy and affluent citizens scramble for basic survival.\nAcross America — across the world — the situation is the same. Governments\nstill control weapons and armies, police and firemen, but now they are openly in the\nservice of dark powers. The media, if it still exists, broadcasts nothing but propa-\nganda. Since few cities have electricity, though, few can hear the lies anyway. Money\nmeans nothing, prestige means nothing, hope means nothing.

In rescuing the\nfriend, the hunters see that the creature dispenses with secrecy and seeks to rule the\nruined city with an iron fist. The only way to fight back effectively against the\ncreature (and the other horrors overtaking the city) is to use the same tactics.\n• Another hunter asks the characters for assistance in fighting back against\nmonsters, or he gives them information about the way the horrors now operate. The\nneedy hunter is convinced that the rules have changed; it’s time to fight the darkness\npublicly. The characters must be careful, however, that their ally’s information isn’t\nslanted toward her own agenda.\n• Hunters of the Zeal creeds or with a high Zeal rating receive a vision, in which\nthe city is razed to the ground. From the rubble erupts a geyser of blood, from which\nleap hideous, shadowy forms. Out of the wreckage emerge human forms, wreathed\nin flames and wielding weapons of light, to do battle. Many of the human forms are\ndestroyed, but the shadows are wiped out. In the aftermath, the flaming warriors lead\na stream of refugees to the outside world. Along with the vision comes a message:\n“STAND AGAINST THE DARKNESS,” “WIPE THE CORRUPTION FROM\nTHE WORLD,” or “CLEANSE THE EARTH THAT IS TO COME.”\nIt’s time for the last and final battle with the forces of darkness, and this time,\nthe imbued have an advantage they didn’t enjoy before. All the impediments to the\nhunt that civilization once posed are gone. No police to avoid. No skepticism to\novercome. No need for secrecy. This is open warfare, not a covert operation. The\ncharacters are free to break the old rules with impunity.\nOf course, so are their opponents.\nCHOOSE YOUR TARGETS\nJust what kind of opposition the hunters face in this war depends on the events\nof your chronicle to date. As Storyteller, you’ve already developed a picture of what\ncreatures and forces exist in the characters’ home city, forces they might have\ncontended with frequently in the past. New creatures and dangers appear and take\nadvantage of the chaos, and some established horrors could fall in the first days of\nanarchy. But for the most part, the creatures arrayed against the hunters now are those\nthat have dominated the chronicle to date. What changes is the methods and openness\nof these creatures, who can now commit atrocities without the need for secrecy.\nThe biggest thing that’s likely to change is the creation of territories — districts\nopenly controlled by a monster or group of monsters, where any human survivors are\nenslaved or murdered. Almost all the creatures of the World of Darkness need humans\nfor some reason, be it food, energy or simply for the gratification of desires. Similarly,\ncreatures crave power and influence, perhaps in hopes of saving themselves, or because\nruling a pocket kingdom or tattered empire satisfies their obsession with dominance.\nNaturally, it is important that each such domain have its own feel, in keeping with\nthe nature of its new “lords.” A visit to enemy territory should be a powerful and\nunnerving experience for the characters. Go all out when conveying the magnitude of\nwhat has occurred. On top of any descriptions you feel are necessary, don’t be afraid to\nuse a lot of props, costuming, visual aids, music and set dressing to get just the mood you\ndesire. A neighborhood destroyed by roving shapechanger packs that rule by force should\nhave a distinctly different feel from a domain under the sway of a hypnotic bloodsucker,\nfor instance, and both should be quite different from a neighborhood living in fear of\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

If the players feel as though the scene or session could just\nas easily be taking place in any other location you’ve used in the past, something has gone\nvery wrong. Fortunately, unless the chronicle is set entirely inside one of these territories,\nyou should have the time to prepare appropriately for sessions that take place “on the\ninside,” which should help keep such experiences fresh and compelling.\nNever forget that having Narrator characters portraying residents and victims\nis your most valuable tool for providing the players with information on these\nterritories, not to mention underscoring the horrific nature of the fate that has\nbefallen the hapless residents. Work with your Narrators well in advance to come up\nwith a set of strange behaviors, taboos or other quirks based on the adjustments their\ncharacters have made to living under monstrous rule. Unless the creature exerts\nabsolute control every second of every day, you’re better off mixing small habits with\nmore serious ones when you can. While having all the residents reduced to shuffling\ndrones chanting the name of their master can be extremely unsettling, it also\nseverely limits the amount of possible roleplaying and interaction. It can be just as\neerie to have a seemingly normal conversation with a resident, only to have him\nmake a special sign every time the name of his master is mentioned or suddenly recite\na long passage or prayer from memory whenever a certain topic comes up.\nWhat’s more, try to tailor the characters’ habits to the type of creature that is\nin control. Not only does that add to the depth of what has happened, but it also\nmight provide perceptive characters with some additional information about the\nruling creature’s strengths and weaknesses. For example, residents of a territory\ncontrolled by creatures with superior senses might have abandoned all verbal\ncommunication for fear of being overheard, writing down everything instead.\nHapless mortals controlled by a powerful ghost who died in a fire might all exhibit\nthe creature’s insane phobia of open flame.\nIn game terms, the hunters’ ability to exert Influence in a monster’s territory will\nprobably suffer. For each territory, the Storyteller may give the creature in control\nspecial Territory Influence to represent its control over the area. The good news is that\nin order to maintain the level of control implicit in its Influence, the monster must\nkeep his domain somewhat organized. This means that even if things are in total chaos\neverywhere else, and Influence is useless throughout the rest of the city, the Influence\nratings of others (such as hunters) should drop to only one Trait less than the domain’s\nmaster’s Influence. The bad news is that any attempt to use Influence in the territory\nnow calls for a Social Challenge against the Social Traits of the monster in control, and\nif the player fails the challenge, the monster may learn of her attempt. Also, external\nInfluence lasts only as long as the institutions it affects still exist. If a warlock replaces\nthe police with steam-powered robots, any attempt to use Police Influence within its\ndomain is futile.\nExampleofPlay:ApowerfulbloodsuckerhastakencontrolovermostofPhiladelphia’s\nOldCity,gaininganeffective Territory Influencex3.Sam,aMartyrholedupinasafehouse\nby the art museum, needs to obtain more ammunition for his team, and his supplier in\nUniversity City is accepting only gold.

A portion of\nthe pre- and post-session planning should go toward discussing the various schemes and\nhow the different masters are reacting to what the players and other creatures are doing.\nThe following creatures all have reasons for taking territories throughout the\ncity. Other beings might also try to stake out turf for their own reasons — or they\ncould simply rampage through the city, killing and destroying anything in their path.\nGhosts/Walking Dead: The spirits of the dead draw strength from human\nemotion, especially negative emotion. Ghosts might assemble cults of followers,\npossessing hosts temporarily and drinking the pain and misery of their slaves.\nWalking dead are inclined to simple destruction and the fear and terror their victims\nfeel. The territories of these beings are probably the most disorganized and chaotic\nof all, focusing on graveyards, cemeteries and disaster sites.\nVampires: The bloodsuckers might now act openly, without fear of discovery,\nbut they must also compete with their own kind for precious blood. Competition\nbetween vampire warlords is likely to be fierce, and well-armed ghouls and slaves\npatrol various territories. Some vampires set up “blood camps,” prisons for survivors\nand mortals. Established in defensible locations such as hospitals and jails, these\ncamps are packed with mortals who are (comparatively) well fed and protected —\nuntil undead commandants come to claim more victims.\nShapechangers: Were-creatures draw power from nature rather than from\nhumans, so they set up territories in parks and wild spaces with their sacred places\nat the center. Shapechangers do need humans for one reason, though — as breeding\nstock. While were-creatures are unlikely to try to expand their territories, they\naggressively raid human refuges for new breeding captives or simply for prey.\nWarlocks: Manipulators and wizards lose many of their advantages, influence and\npurpose with the fall of the civilization that concealed them. But now they can practice\ntheir magic freely, unfettered by the collective disbelief of human civilization. In these\nhorrific End Times, people realize that anything is possible. Warlocks left in the city\nattempt to gather acolytes who can assist in magic rituals and protect their masters from\ndanger. Witches might also gather legions of followers with promises and bribes, but they\naren’t likely to be aggressive or expansionist against one another, unless a warlock sends\nout raiding parties to steal food, supplies or artifacts needed for his magic.\nBLOCK BY BLOCK\nOnce the characters have identified their enemies, the task is simple. Uncom-\nplicated, that is, but not easy. Taking back the city is a matter of strategy, supply lines\nand zones of control — reclaiming locations that monsters control and destroying\ntheir power bases. The hunters are guerrillas taking on an invading army, or they are\ninvaders themselves.

The three Zeal creeds have\ndifferent roles to play in this war, and an effective campaign against the darkness\ndemands that hunters do what they do best.\nOf course, skill and personality have at least as big a role here as a hunter’s\ncreed does. A Martyr might possess tactical skills and an insightful mind, and play\nthe part of a leader in the war. An Innocent may care so much for the refugees in\nher care that she does anything to protect them, fighting attackers in the manner\nof a Defender. The creeds have natural ability in some areas, thanks to their Virtues\nand edges, but that doesn’t override the identity of a person or make a hunter\n“wrong” for the role he assumes.\nAvengers: These hunters are the front-line soldiers of the war, the first in and the\nlast out. With their offensive, combat-focused edges, Avengers are best suited to one-on-\none combat with the supernatural and its minions. Before that point is reached, however,\nAvengers need to focus on gaining access to an enemy’s territory, scouting out possible\navenues of entry (and escape), and on slowly wearing down monsters’ followers and\ndefenses. These are the most hazardous roles a hunter can play in this scenario, and an\nAvenger who is careless or lacks dedication will soon be killed. Avengers who want to\nsurvive must explore their anger, that need for vengeance burning away their human\nweaknesses— and running the risk of losing their humanity in the process. The war will\nbring many opportunities for these hunters to gain Conviction and increase their Virtues.\nMadness might be an inevitable side effect of victory.\nDefenders: While Avengers are charged with destroying the enemy, Defenders\nhave an equally important task: protecting the home front. The protectors of the\nwar, Defenders must safeguard hunters’ own territory from attack and reprisal. That\nrole places them in constant danger — and might drive them to madness before the\nwar is done, too. Defenders are also invaluable in rescuing people who have been\ncaptured or enslaved. Rescuing the downtrodden is a challenging obligation,\ninvolving anything from silently leading chains of refugees through the sewers to\nramming barricades with trucks and pulling hostages out through a hail of gunfire.\nAnd once refugees are safe, Defenders must continue to protect them so that former\ncaptors (or other creatures) cannot take advantage again.\nJudges: If Avengers are soldiers and Defenders are guardians, Judges are officers\nand leaders, the tactical planners and decision-makers of the war. It falls to Judges\nto decide how to conduct attacks, what defenses and resources to target, and how to\nweaken the enemy before the final confrontation. This role demands data and\nintelligence. Judges need to endanger themselves to ferret out enemies’ secrets.\nJudges might also decide how a group’s resources are best used and maintained, and\nthey must consider how to keep the imbued supplied and protected. Judges aren’t as\nprevalent on the front lines as Avengers or even Defenders are, but their role is\ndemanding nonetheless. As the commanding officers of the war, Judges are called\nupon to make the hard choices — who undertakes missions, who gets rescued, who\ngets left behind, who lives and who dies. It’s a role that can take a heavy toll on a\nhunter’s morale and sanity. Judges might be pushed to the edge and beyond by the\nburden of their responsibilities.\nWAR STORIES\nAs the scenario progresses, the characters might make headway against the\nmonsters, retaking territory and casting down their dark masters.

These re-\nsources must be found or created, but searching for them can take up all the “spare”\ntime a hunter has. And once these necessities are found, they must be protected lest\nthe enemy — or other humans — steal them.\nThe Home Front: Casting an undead tyrant down is just the beginning of the\njob. An enemy’s territory can’t be left empty — it’s a resource that must be used by\nthe imbued, lest it be claimed by a different enemy. Once a territory is taken, it must\nbe populated with refugees and survivors, the human supporters and aides of the\nimbued. Resources must be found to feed, clothe and shelter these people. Fresh\nwater and sanitation must be provided, and borders must be protected from invasion.\nNew Faces: As one enemy is cast down, another might take its place. New\nmonsters could enter the city looking for a chance to grab power, while others (such\nas the walking dead) might simply be created in the wake of a battle. At the same time,\npotential new allies could appear, from imbued outsiders come to fight for the\ncharacters’ cause to courageous refugees prepared to go against the enemy. But even\nthese allies can pose problems as precious resources are stretched ever thinner to\nprovide for them. And do other hunters really have the same goals as the characters?\nBlack Allegiances: Faced with attack from the imbued, supernatural beings\nmight band together to fight back. While these creatures hate each other and\ncompete for followers and resources, they fear or hate the characters more. Besieged\nenemies might attempt to turn the tables, launching attacks on hunter territories,\nor bringing in allies of their own to bolster forces for a decisive strike.\nTHE OTHER CREEDS\n“Cleansing Fires” emphasizes the role and purpose of the Zeal Virtue, to wipe\naway the infection of the supernatural from this world and prevent it from\ncorrupting anything that rises anew. But the other creeds and Virtues have a part\nto play in this war. There are many opportunities for non-Zealot characters to get\ninvolved in this scenario.\nThe Merciful: These hunters focus on aiding the war effort through\nintelligence, diplomacy and providing hope when all seems lost. Innocents can\ngather information through scouting raids and negotiate with one enemy to\nfight another. Martyrs could rally hunters and ordinary people alike, filling\nhearts with hope through courage and sacrifice. Redeemers might tend to the\nwounded and persuade enemies to surrender or withdraw with the promise of\nforgiveness or salvation.\nThe Visionary: War is more than fighting, it’s information. It’s purpose,\nand that’s what these hunters provide. Hermits can hang back and gather\ninsights with their edges, providing the data needed to draw up battle plans.\nVisionaries can develop long-term strategies, coordinating their fellows and\nmaking sure each battle is a step toward winning the war. And Waywards could\ninspire and direct from the front lines, demonstrating savage power.

War is never a simple affair, however. The imbued are likely to\nsuffer terrible casualties, even if they gain the upper hand. Success demands sacrifice\nand brings with it new complications and obstacles. Ultimately, it comes down to\na single bid — a last stand, a final battle against the darkness.\nNo matter how the war has been fought thus far, this is the hardest battle of all.\nThe final enemy (whoever that might be) has had the opportunity to conserve its\nresources, to prepare and plan for this, its last stand. The characters, on the other\nhand, have fought battle after battle in their campaign and are bound to have paid\na heavy price in sanity and lives.\nAs Storyteller, you need to make this battle matter. It’s time to pull out all the\nstops and show the hunters the fight of their lives. The enemy fights dirty and\ndesperately, and the imbued must do the same to have a hope of winning. This is\nthe final battle of a war story, and not everyone can make it out alive. In fact, none\nof the characters might live. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Tragic endings are\nall too possible in Reckoning. Even if all the imbued die, the battle might not be\nlost. Not if the refugees and survivors they have cared for rise up and fight in\nmemory of their protectors.\nWhen the dust settles and the last of the dead have been carted from the\nbattlefield, what then? Do the Messengers appear in a burst of light and say “well\ndone” to the survivors? Probably not. What’s more likely is that nothing happens at\nall. The city is cleansed. If other imbued elsewhere have successfully waged similar\ncampaigns, the country might be free of supernatural contamination. The hunters\nhave the remains of a society under them, a nation of survivors who seek leaders. The\ncharacters can protect that realm and work to stop the darkness from returning.\nEven if the imbued win their battle, the war isn’t necessarily over. Who knows\nwhat’s happening across the rest of the world? Perhaps the end is inevitable; nothing\ncan hold it back. The hunters might have liberated their city only to have it be\ndestroyed by an unstoppable Armageddon. Or perhaps the city is an island of weak\nand fading light in a sea of darkness and corruption. And, of course, there’s the\nchance that the characters fall in battle and the city is not claimed from monsters.\nYou decide what happens after the battle. The imbued have done all that they\ncan; all that a band of fragile and fallible humans can achieve in the final days. What\nhappens after that might be out of their hands. All they can hope is that their blood,\nsweat and tears have wiped the sins from one world and consecrated a new, pure one.\nGLIMMER OF HOPE\nOverview: As the world burns, a miracle happens. A power is unleashed that\ncan heal monsters of their corruption, returning them to a normal human state. The\nimbued become the custodians of this power as supernatural creatures flock to their\ncity to be saved, or the characters might seek to destroy this new and awesome power.\n“Glimmer of Hope” emphasizes the Mercy Virtue. The coming Armageddon\nshatters the normal boundaries of reality. Events that were once impossible now come\nto pass. The possibility of healing or pardoning monsters is a reality, and the characters\ncontrol that power. But this gift can’t be used on a whim.

The wall between the possible and impossible crumbles, as does the barrier\nbetween the worlds of the living and dead. Anything can happen, and a miracle occurs\nin the characters’ city. It’s known as the glimmer— a power that can remove the taint\nof corruption from a supernatural creature. Under the glimmer’s light, a monster is\ncleansed of darkness, forgiven its sins and returned to humanity or allowed to pass\ninto peaceful oblivion.\n“Glimmer” is just convenient shorthand for describing the power of this\nscenario. You can call it anything you like, or not call it anything at all. Just what\nform the glimmer takes is for you to decide based on the needs of your chronicle. Here\nare a few suggestions.\n• An extremist Merciful hunter develops the power to heal monsters as an\nExalted-level edge. This hunter may be one of the players’ characters or a Storyteller\ncharacter. You should design an edge to encompass the effect, using the powers in\nother sourcebooks as guidelines. Expiate is a possible model, only the power at work\nhere could be more lasting. This edge may come from deep inside the possessor or\nfrom an external source (see Fall from Grace for more details). The power seems\nbenevolent, but it could be a gift from a corrupt or evil source that uses the imbued\nto weaken the supernatural opposition.\n• An extremist Redeemer battles a powerful creature, perhaps a demon,\nwarlock or other being with knowledge of spirit worlds. Both fall, and in their death\nthroes a fountain of light erupts, birthed from their spiritual power. This version of\nthe glimmer is a stationary field of mystic light. It emits a kind of spiritual gravity that\ndraws supernatural corruption to itself. It might be tall enough to reach into the sky\nlike a skyscraper or small enough to illuminate a room.\n• A scientist or technically minded hunter discovers a “cure” for supernatural\ncorruption, a serum made from unusual ingredients. The treatment shouldn’t work,\nbut somehow — in a world where the laws of physics and life fray — it does, purging\neven dead flesh of supernatural toxins. The cure cannot be made easily, however.\nPerhaps it’s based on chemicals found on a site of mystic activity, or only the inventor\ncan make it work and she isn’t sure how.\nNo matter what the glimmer is in your chronicle, the hunters are the ones who\nlearn of its existence. Perhaps the possessor of the power comes to them for help, or\na vision from the Messengers drives them to the discovery. Maybe they’re the ones\nto create this miracle in the first place. In any case, the characters are the first to find\nout about the glimmer. The first, but not the last.\nHEALING LIGHT\nWhatever form the glimmer takes in your chronicle, it possesses the same\nproperties — qualities that shape the course of the scenario. (You may, of course,\ndecide to change these features to better suit the story you want to tell.)\nItturnsmonstersintonormalhumans. Exposure to the glimmer eradicates any\nsupernatural properties of a being. (Depending on the form the glimmer takes, some\ncreatures might be immune.

Hunters are completely unaffected by the\nglimmer. If it is a physical effect like a serum, it has no toxic or beneficial result when\nadministered.

Every time the power is applied, its strength is diminished. The\nserum cannot be remade. The light fades. The possessing hunter’s vitality and sanity\nerodes.

More subtle creatures might attempt to win the\ncharacters’ favor, directing the glimmer toward their allies and minions and not at\ntheir enemies — or vice versa.

They also need protection from their enemies.\nMonsters (or other hunters) might seek to strike at a recovered monster now that she\nhas lost her power and defenses.\nGUARDING HOPE\nNot every creature in the world wants to be saved or cured by the glimmer. Many\nmonsters are so corrupt that they relish their supernatural existence and perceive the\nglimmer as a threat. The glimmer is destruction, not a reward, and they seek to lash out\nagainst it any way they can. They aren’t alone, either. Some hunters might attempt to\ndestroy the glimmer rather than permit the forgiveness of their hated enemies.\nProtecting the source from attack plays a major part in this scenario. The\nfollowing are some possible issues involving the power’s defense.\nThe simplest form of attack is, of course, direct physical force. Less subtle\nmonsters or creatures with powerful physical abilities might try to destroy the\nglimmer. This could mean murdering the hunter who channels the power or blowing\nup the location that houses the nexus.

This kind of direct physical challenge can\nbe bloody — and not just for the hunters. Normal people and saved monsters might\nbe injured or lost in the battle.\nCunning monsters such as vampires, warlocks and demons may put subtle\nschemes into play. A monster might strike at the glimmer by capturing a hunter’s\nfamily, threatening to kill loved ones if the power is not destroyed. Another option\nmight be to distract the hunters with minions or other monster groups, leaving the\nglimmer unguarded. Monsters who influence governments, police or other institu-\ntions — even as damaged as these groups are in the final days — could use them to\nharass, arrest or destabilize the characters, their allies or their friends. In response,\nREDEMPTIONS THAT DO NOT BEGET INTERVENTIONS\nThe administration of the glimmer and the possible redemption of a\nmonster is likely to be an incredibly intense situation for all involved. Enjoy\nit, but be careful. Just as the hunters find themselves persecuted for trying to\nrecondition monsters, players might accidentally cross the line while trying to\nportray their commitment to redemption. As always, it is important that the\nIt’s Just a Game, No Touching, Be Mindful of Others and Have Fun rules stay\nfirmly in mind, especially during such powerful scenes as these.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

They have something or someone personal to lose.\nDepending on the nature of the glimmer, the hunters might not be able to\ndefend it against certain attacks. If the power flows from a crack in reality or a spirit\nrealm, the imbued cannot enter such an alien plane — but monsters such as demons,\nghosts and werewolves can, and might strike at the source directly. The hunters\nmight have to approach former or current enemies for aid, asking one set of monsters\nto fight another. But even if other creatures agree to help the characters, they’re\nbound to demand a price. Can the imbued grant the blessing of the glimmer to\ncreatures who don’t deserve it — or withhold it from beings who do — in order to\nbuy another day of protection?\nBeyond monsters, another threat is posed to the glimmer: other hunters. Some\nchosen (especially those of the Mercy creeds) see it as a boon, but others see it as\na get-out-of-jail-free card being handed out to monsters who deserve punishment.\nThese angry hunters want to either destroy the glimmer and any imbued who\nprotect it or use it as a way of stripping creatures’ powers before murdering the\nbeings. Like monsters, enemy hunters might be overt or subtle in their attacks on\nthe glimmer. Guardians might have to justify their actions to former allies in a\ncalm debate, or they might have to find God45 before the Wayward detonates a\ndirty nuclear bomb in the middle of the monster shantytown. How far are the\nhunters prepared to go to defend themselves against erstwhile allies, and how do\nmonsters react to inter-hunter conflict?\nTHE QUALITY OF MERCY\nThe control and protection of the glimmer falls primarily to characters of the\nMercy creeds. Through the use of the source, the Merciful can fulfill personal goals: to\nheal the supernatural corruption of this world and lessen the taint that spills into any\nsubsequent world. It’s a daunting task — the Merciful can never completely heal the\nworld or negate the supernatural — but if the right monsters can be redeemed, if enough\ncan be done with the glimmer before it fades, then the hunters might make a difference.\nThe glimmer is limited in power and comes closer to exhaustion every time it’s\nused. Ultimate responsibility for it, for making sure it’s used as effectively as possible,\ngoes to Merciful hunters.\nInnocents: These hunters are the peacemakers and diplomats of the imbued.\nThey might communicate with supernatural supplicants who seek (or demand) the\nglimmer’s touch. When monsters come to the glimmer like moths to a flame, they\ncould be confused, angry, violent or suspicious. Innocents can calm these beings,\nallay their fears that the glimmer is bait or prevent them from lashing out at hunters\nand other people. As more creatures gather around the hunters, Innocents can spend\neven more time interacting with them. Their duties might include administering to\nthe growth of a shantytown, mediating a peace between rival creatures or helping\nmonsters evade attacks and reprisals from enemy hunters. Innocents can be the\n“public face” of the glimmer, bearing the attention, temptation and aggression of\nunnatural supplicants.\nRedeemers: No hunters have a more terrible task than Redeemers. They may\nfeel responsible for deciding which creatures benefit from the glimmer’s power. Not\nevery hopeful can be saved, and only the most deserving may feel the power’s touch.\nRedeemers are charged with picking and choosing between monsters, using their\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Some Redeemers might\nchoose to bless those creatures who are truly repentant, who have worked to push\nback their own damnation and who wish for nothing more than the return of their\nhumanity. Other hunters might decide to use the glimmer on monsters who are truly\nevil and corrupt, to remove their hideous power from the world and neutralize their\ninfluence. No matter what criteria Redeemers use, no matter what advice they take,\nthe final choice is theirs alone. And if the wrong creature is touched by the glimmer,\nthey must take responsibility for the outcome.\nMartyrs: The blessing of the glimmer is a process, almost like a 12-step program\nto forgiveness. Innocents handle the intake of monsters, Redeemers control the actual\nmoment of healing, while Martyrs take charge of the aftereffects, the return of former\nmonsters to humanity. This is a time of confusion, weakness and simple emotional\nsuffering for a creature. No hunters understand pain and suffering better than Martyrs.\nIt’s up to these imbued to counsel saved monsters in what it means to be human, to\nprotect them in their time of weakness and to bring them back into the community.\nMartyrs also play a strong part in protecting the glimmer from attack, fighting alongside\nZealots or on their own, and inspiring their comrades — and perhaps even the ranks\nof former creatures — with their courage, devotion and sacrifice.\nTHE LIGHT FADES\nThe power of the glimmer is immense and world-changing, but it’s not infinite.\nSooner or later, depending on how heavily the characters draw upon it, the phenomenon\nis spent. The healing energy runs dry, the serum reserves are exhausted or the extremist\nis consumed by her own power. The glimmer is gone and the story draws to a close.\nTHE OTHER CREEDS\n“Glimmer of Hope” emphasizes the role and purpose of the Mercy Virtue,\nto heal supernatural beings and in turn diminish their influence upon this age\nand that to come. But the Merciful aren’t alone in their fight. Other creeds have\na part to play in this scenario.\nThe Visionary: Using the glimmer on every monster that stumbles across\none’s path isn’t a wise way to share a miracle. To have a true impact on the world\nand to make a real difference, hunters of Vision can direct the glimmer where\nit can best be used. Hermits can gather information about monsters and\nsupplicants to the power, finding out which creatures have honest intentions\nand which are hopelessly corrupt. Visionaries look at the big picture, predicting\nwhat effects will follow the salvation of this monster rather than that one. As\nfor Waywards, while the mad hunters can use their gifts to guide the use of the\nglimmer, they’re likely to use it as a weapon, a means of crippling the powers\nof the supernatural.\nThe Zealous: Some see the glimmer not as a beacon of hope, but as an\nabomination that must be destroyed or as a resource to be exploited for their own\nends. Adherents of Zeal are called upon to fight such aggressors. Avengers can\ntake the fight to the attackers, striking at monsters and rogue hunters. Defenders\nprotect the glimmer and the Merciful from harm, holding attackers at arm’s\nlength until help arrives. Judges determine battle plans, mapping out tactics to\nremove a threat while minimizing the toll on mortals and hopefuls alike.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The hunters have\nfought to control the power of the miracle, to heal willing (and perhaps unwilling)\nmonsters of their unnatural state, and to make the final days less terrifying. They’ve\nprobably suffered losses and setbacks, but they’ve (hopefully) also had triumphs.\nHave their actions made the next world a cleaner, less corrupt place?\nIf you don’t want to wrap up the story there, a number of stories and situations\ncan spin out of “Glimmer of Hope.” Consider the following issues:\n• What happens to monsters who are human again? Can they be integrated into\nnormal human society (or whatever society exists after the final days)? Some of them\nmight have a change of heart once they experience all the bad aspects of being mortal\nand seek to return to their damned state, or take revenge on the hunters. Others\nmight become targets of their old enemies or of humans who want to punish their\nformer dictators. Will the hunters protect them from such enemies or let them reap\nwhat they have sown?\n• What about the monsters who didn’t receive the glimmer, who were rejected\nor turned away by the hunters? These creatures might seek revenge on the people\nwho denied them salvation. Alternatively, some might pursue other means of\nredemption — means that could be true blessings or false promises held out as a\nmonstrous trick. What do characters do if they learn that a demon is undoing all of\ntheir efforts by drawing repentant monsters back into damnation?\n• For that matter, are there truly other means of salvation out there that the\nhunters can put to use? The glimmer was a singular power, but it might not be unique.\nIf another similar force exists, the hunters might be able to find it and avoid any\nmistakes made before. Of course, other forces — from monsters to other hunters to\nformer creatures of darkness — are desperate to find and control this new power, too.\nWINDS OF CHANGE\nOverview: The old rules have broken and now seemingly small changes can\nsweep the world. When normal humans are motivated to hew closer to the imbued\nand acknowledge the protectors in their midst, it’s a golden opportunity to make a\nreal difference. But to do so, the imbued must finally unify and dedicate themselves\nto a single cause.\n“Winds of Change” emphasizes the Vision Virtue. The imbued have always\nbeen held back by the inability of humanity to recognize the corruption of the\nsupernatural. But what happens when normal folks start to believe? With the power\nof the people behind them, hunters can act openly, coming together to fight the\ndarkness. Before that can happen, though, the imbued must overcome their own\ndifferences and agree on a goal that can be achieved, a dream that can be realized.\nThis story focuses heavily on interaction between hunters, other imbued groups and\nordinary people. The emphasis is on planning, leading and organizing, on aiming for\na lofty goal and doing whatever it takes to reach it.\nA CRACK IN THE MIRROR\nFor millennia, humanity has lived in ignorance of the monsters that lurk at\nsociety’s heart, that influence nations and that commit atrocities behind the scenes.\nThis ignorance is due to supernatural powers of subterfuge and disguise, and to those\nbeings’ cunning and secrecy. But the most important factor is humanity’s reluctance\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

They want to remain blissfully ignorant.\nNot anymore.\n“Winds of Change” proposes that normal people are ready to believe in the\nsupernatural. This change might come about as a result or side effect of civilization’s\ndestruction in the final days, or this newfound resilience could be the trigger for the\nfinal days and the tearing down of the old order. In either case, something has\nstripped away the human tendency for amnesia. Now when normal people encoun-\nter the supernatural — whether they see a ghost in a deserted house, survive a\nvampire’s attack or watch footage of a rampaging werewolf — they accept it for what\nit is, not for what they’ve been told it should be.\nOf course, all this change doesn’t mean that humans can suddenly detect\nmonsters or see through supernatural tricks. That capacity remains beyond people,\nas the burden of hunters who activate second sight. Nor can mortals read hunter code\nor resist a monster’s mind-control powers. Yet, the underpinning of the world’s\ncorruption — the inability of the human masses to even see that corruption exists —\nis gone. This upset of the status quo changes the world forever.\nEARLY DAYS\nThe hunters already believe in the supernatural, of course, so they aren’t\ndirectly affected by the change in the world’s rules. The scenario starts with the\ndawning realization that reality has changed, that the characters can take advantage\nof this new situation. The following are possible hooks to draw the hunters into the\nstory, but many possibilities exist.\n• In the aftermath of a confrontation with the supernatural (be it peaceful or\nviolent), the hunters are surrounded by people who want to know what the hell that\ncreature was, or what just happened. Accustomed to onlookers panicking or\nrationalizing away the supernatural, characters might be startled to realize that\npeople believe the evidence before their eyes, or at least don’t instantly reject the\nnotion of the inhuman.\n• Footage of a monster fighting a hunter appears on the Internet or on\ntelevision. The corrupt controllers of the media pull the images and bury the story,\nbut the damage is done. As they go about their daily lives, the characters encounter\npeople debating what the footage really depicted and whether supernatural forces\nwere actually involved.\n• When a creature (perhaps a warlock or demon) uses its powers openly in a\nconfrontation with the characters, mortal onlookers don’t run. Indeed, a mob of\nangry people attacks the creature, forcing it to flee or perhaps giving the hunters a\nchance to take it down.\nThis change in people’s beliefs might occur slowly over the course of several\nstories, or it might happen overnight. In either case, the change is not just local but\nglobal. Stories of humanity’s acceptance of the supernatural surface in the media and\nin underground networks such as hunter-net, and propagate by word of mouth.\nOpen acceptance of monsters means that the greatest obstacles facing the\nimbued — their inability to act openly or gain support from their friends or society\nat large — are eliminated. The characters are still vulnerable to attacks and reprisals\nfrom enemies. They might still have to work in secret to remain safe, but now they\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

But with a\nlegion of human supporters and believers behind them, the imbued can now become\nguides— leaders of an army, a political revolution or a spiritual reawakening. If hunters\ncan convince normal people to aid them, to lend support to a specific goal, the chosen\ncan make real headway in the struggle. This is a time for hunters (especially those of\nthe Vision creeds) to set their sights on major, concrete objectives. It’s an opportunity\nto stop maintaining the status quo and start making a real difference.\nIt’s likely that characters make large-scale plans as soon as they realize that they\ncan gain the support of the masses. If they don’t, other imbued groups elsewhere do,\nand the characters see the results. Perhaps news reports show riots in other cities,\nwith the ringleaders holding up banners bearing hunter code symbols. A politician\nis torn apart by a mob after other hunters expose him as a monster. A cult movement\nforms around a charismatic preacher who claims that monsters are real. You can use\nscenes such as these to light a fire under players, driving home the point that the old\nrules have changed and that great things are possible.\nOf course, if hunters want to draw on the strength and support of the people, they\nneed to win that support. People might no longer dismiss the supernatural out of hand,\nbut they still need to be convinced that accusers are right — and be persuaded to aid\nin any effort. It doesn’t help that people are still afraid of the supernatural and likely\nto panic when they encounter monsters. If the characters want converts, they need to\nchallenge public fear by motivating normal humans to fight back.\nFear can be overridden with outrage. If the characters know of a particularly vile\nor abhorrent creature, revealing its true nature could infuriate people such that\nthey’re more incensed than terrified. If the hunters prove that a prominent figure\nsuch as a politician or celebrity is a murderer, child molester or ruthless manipulator\nbefore revealing his monstrous nature, mobs might respond by swarming the creature\nrather than running away. Once the furor dies down, hunters can try to rally the\nfrightened but (hopefully) convinced and invigorated humans to their cause.\nAlternatively, characters might try to gain supporters more peacefully and\nrationally, convincing them of the truth intellectually without exposing folks to\ndanger or terror. For instance, hunters could gather evidence that the supernatural is\nreal — photographs, videotapes, witnesses, even the corpses of monsters — and\npresent it all to appropriate people. Taking this material to journalists is one possibility,\nbut it has its dangers. The media might still be controlled or manipulated by monsters\nDOUBLE-EDGED SWORD\nThe fading of the masses’ disbelief isn’t a completely positive development for\nthe imbued. Some creatures — most notably demons, warlocks and goblins —\nwere actually hampered by disbelief before. The great secret suppressed their\nsupernatural powers and forced them to work quietly. With disbelief gone, these\ncreatures are free to do as they wish and put overt plans and powers into motion.\nHunters might set out to achieve bold new goals only to find some of their\nopposition even more powerful than before.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Another possibility is for the chosen to personally convince\nfriends, families and personal contacts, everyone from co-workers to church members.\nWord of mouth spreads from there, from other people who are trusted.\nMany other methods exist for hunters to gain support. They could form a cult,\npreaching the truth about the supernatural. They could rally a street gang around\nthemselves, recruiting new members as society crumbles. They could even set up a\nwebsite with photos, documents and forums, almost like a “civilian” version of\nhunter-net, tapping into the rising tide of online belief.\nHowever the hunters approach the task, the process of gathering followers can\noccupy several chapters of the story. Once they win support, however, they need to\nuse it. They need a purpose.\nPERSISTENCE OF VISION\nGoals, plans and foresight are the province of the Vision creeds, which might\nhave been intended by the Messengers to lead the imbued into the final days. That’s\nnot a role that the other hunters have always accepted, of course, or that Visionary\nhunters have understood themselves. Before now, the business of planning and\nthinking about where the imbued are going has often taken a back seat to simple\nsurvival, and long-term goals have given way to short-term successes.\nWith humanity emerging from its blindness, however, the situation has\nchanged. It’s time for Vision to take command, and for the leaders of hunters to take\ntheir rightful place in imbued society. But the three Vision creeds are very different\nin their approaches to the hunt, other imbued and humanity. Those differences\naffect the goals such leaders choose and the relationships they form with supporters.\nHermits: Separated from their fellow imbued by crippling headaches and\nmental static, Hermits naturally prefer the company of ordinary people (when they\nmust endure company at all). Hermits are best suited to working directly with\nhunters’ supporters. As the imbued form a support network, Hermits can work\nwithin that normal community, sharing information and relaying the general\nmentality of the masses to other hunters. Hermits are also vital to gathering the\ndetails needed to develop plans and goals, using their edges and capabilities to learn\nand disseminate information. The challenge for Hermits is balancing any loyalty to\nordinary friends and associates with the overall sacrifice and loss demanded by\nhunters’ plans. Can individual losses be tolerated for the greater good?\nWaywards: Just as Hermits can work within society, so are the near-psychotic\nWaywards connected to the imbued. Waywards tend to be contemptuous of other\nhunters, but at least they recognize that other chosen have a function. Normal humans,\nhowever, might be considered little more than cannon fodder or bait. That attitude\nthat can only drive supporters away. A hunter group led by a Wayward is likely to work\ntoward a violent and bloody goal, and it will probably suffer great losses in the struggle\nto reach it. Even other hunters may be expendable to a Wayward, and imbued allies\ncould become enemies once the destructive plans of a Wayward are revealed. But in\nthe final days, when monsters rampage and civilization crumbles, the savage inspira-\ntion and power of a Wayward might be the only means of fulfilling a goal.\nVisionaries: Making up the only truly sane creed following the Vision Virtue,\nthese hunters are perhaps best suited to lead both imbued and ordinary people to a\ndream.

But with that purpose and presence comes\nresponsibility, more so than for Hermits and Waywards. A Visionary must be the\ninterface between hunters and their supporters, able to lead from the front lines and\nadvise from safety. No other hunter better understands the price that must be paid\nto reach important goals. A Visionary must justify that price to both imbued and\nhuman allies. This is the role for which seers were created, perhaps the purpose the\nMessengers always intended. It’s a thankless and punishing task, however. One that\ncan destroy a leader before her aspiration is fulfilled.\nAIMING HIGH\nGreat things can be achieved only if hunters strive for them. Until now, most\nhunters have had to settle for small victories and minor achievements, unable to\nmake truly significant changes to the world. But now the status quo has changed, the\nimpossible is possible. Difficult and dangerous, but possible. With the backing of\nsupporters and the potential to gain more, hunters can move beyond their old arenas\nand set their sights on meaningful and important accomplishments. Such as? Well,\nthat’s up to the characters to determine. The central purpose of “Winds of Change”\nis to put the imbued in a position to achieve great things, assuming they have the\ninspiration to find a meaningful goal.\nA major goal is nothing more or less than changing the world. This is action on\na national or even international scale. Rather than exposing the mayor’s mon-\nstrous nature, the characters try to bring down the entire government.

Innocents can lift the spirits of battle-scarred and frightened\nimbued with edges and sheer optimism, and they can fan the flame of hope in\nhuman supporters. Martyrs can inspire ordinary people with their courage and\nreadiness for sacrifice and protect folks from the terrors of the supernatural.\nRedeemers can heal the sick and give strength to the weak, inspiring loyalty in\nthe most cynical of skeptics.\nThe Zealous: As the imbued work toward their goals, monsters lash out\nagainst the upstarts. The Zealous must be ready to protect their leaders. Avengers\nare charged with bringing the battle to the enemy, taking out creatures that stand\nin the path of the imbued agenda.

To actually attain these goals\n— to change the world irrevocably even as it crumbles around their ears — the\nimbued must gain the support of not just a few dozen or even hundreds of normal\nfolks. They must gain the support of thousands. This is not something that can be\naccomplished alone or at once. To attain a major goal, the hunters must ally with\nother imbued across the world.\nINHERITING THE EARTH\nIf and when the characters decide to aim for a major goal and realize that they\nneed help, “Winds of Change” moves into its final phase. To reach their goal, the\nimbued need to recruit other hunter groups (and their human supporters) to the\ncause. The greater the goal, the bigger the network needs to be. In the process of\nbringing hunters together, the characters may accomplish something even more\nimportant — the creation of a hunter society. And even after the goal is reached\n(or perhaps even if the plan fails), that society of hunters, working openly to\nchange the world, remains in the wake of the final days. Perhaps that unification\nwas the unseen, greatest goal possible.\nThe final phase of “Winds of Change” is open-ended. The story could wrap up\nquickly as the hunters overcome every obstacle in their path, or they might be cut\ndown before their crusade even begins. More likely, though, is a story told through\nseveral chapters, with the imbued slowly marshaling their allies. The story ends\nwhen their goal is finally fulfilled or lost. Here are some factors to consider when\ndeveloping the chronicle.\nKeeping the Faith: To maintain the support of normal people, hunters need to\ndo more than simply use edges and fight monsters. People must be protected from\ndanger and kept safe from the chaos and terrors of the final days, even if it puts\nhunters at great risk. If some supporters are lost to violence, the characters have to\nwork all the harder to preserve the loyalty of those who remain.\nCommunication: If the hunters want to recruit the help of other imbued, they\nneed to reach those hunters somehow. Hunter-net is one means of contact, but it might\nnot function as society falls apart. Characters might have to resort to simpler methods\nsuch as telephone calls, face-to-face meetings or even letters. Other options include\nusing the media, sending messengers or the use of edges and creed capabilities.\nNegotiation and Compromise: The characters are not the only hunters trying\nto make a difference in the final days. Other groups work toward their own goals and\nmay have little or no interest in cooperating with the characters. Indeed, other\ngroups might try to persuade the characters to abandon their goal and dedicate\nthemselves to a different agenda. If the imbued want the help of their fellows, they\nmight need to make formal alliances and deals, quid-pro-quo arrangements to help\nboth groups achieve their desires.\nKilling Rivalries: Some hunter groups have no interest in compromise or\nagreement. Their goals are intrinsically opposed to the characters’. If one group\nseeks to make an alliance with demons to uncover the mysteries of reality while\nanother seeks to wipe demons from the face of the Earth, there can be only conflict\nbetween them.\nMonstrous Reprisal: Of course, the supernatural corrupters of the world do not\nsit idly by while humanity unites against them.

The signs are there for even the blind to see.\nThe Age of Darkness is over. The Age of Sorrow dawns. The end has come.\nThe end for the Laws of the East setting is a part of the eschatological lore of the\nKuei-jin. The Asian vampires believe that time moves in cycles, transitioning from one\nAge to the next. There have already been several such Ages, five to be exact, and the\nworld sits on the cusp of the coming Sixth Age. Exactly when the Sixth Age, the Age\nof Sorrow, will arrive is a matter of considerable speculation and debate among the Kuei-\njin, but the time for debate is over. The Sixth Age is not only coming, it has arrived.\nThis chapter describes different ways for you to bring about the arrival of the Sixth\nAge in your own chronicle. It can come as a climatic ending to an existing chronicle,\nor you can create an entirely new game to play out the ending foretold by the sutras\nand traditions of the Demon People. You can even use the material in this chapter as\ninspiration for creating an all-new Laws of the East chronicle set in the Sixth Age\nitself, after the world familiar to the Kuei-jin has changed irrevocably.

The arrival\nof the Sixth Age may include dramatic alterations in the nature of the Kuei-jin and\ntheir powers, in the relationship between the material and spirit worlds, in the flow\nand character of Chi and many other things. Some system changes that normally\nwouldn’t be suitable for an ongoing chronicle can work just fine as temporary\nchanges heralding the end. After all, if a particular change doesn’t work, it’s fairly\neasy to change it again, saying that the whims of karma are fickle in the Age of\nSorrow. In the end, no system change matters that much, since the chronicle will\nsoon be over anyway.\nHere are just a few ways in which you can change the Laws of the East systems\nto suit your own particular vision of the end. Some of these systems come into play\nin the scenarios described earlier in this book while others are just jumping-off points\nfor you own version of the Sixth Age.\nCHI\nThe power of Chi is one of the key elements of Laws of the East. It is the power\nthat sustains the Hungry Dead — and other shen as well. Wars are fought over control\nof the dragon nests and the dragon lines that connect them. Mortals are valuable to\nthe Kuei-jin for the Chi they possess, making them the prey of the vampires. Chi is also\ntied to the changing of the Ages. The passing of the Age of Legends came when the\nAugust Personage of Jade cursed the Wan Xian, taking away their ability to breathe\nin Chi from the very air, forcing them to steal it from others to survive, transforming\nthem into the Wan Kuei, the Ten Thousand Demons. Another change in the Age\ncould affect the nature of Chi and the Kuei-jin ability to gather and use it.\nConsider some of the following potential changes in the nature of Chi and its use:\n• Chi Imbalance: The type of Chi available to the Kuei-jin changes, favoring\neither Yin or Yang Chi. For example, as the Sixth Age dawns, Yang Chi might\nbecome increasingly rare, while Yin Chi, the energy of darkness and stillness,\npredominates. As a result, it is harder for the Kuei-jin to maintain their Chi balance.\nTemporary imbalance becomes more common, which means that they risk damage\nwhenever they expend Chi. The rarer type of Chi becomes far more precious, and\nKuei-jin are likely to struggle to secure supplies of it. Consider a shortage of Yang Chi\nin the Sixth Age, where surviving hengeyokai or hsien safeguard the few remaining\npockets. In a Sixth Age with a shortage of Yin Chi, wild Kuei-jin might hunt ghosts\nand stalk the dead for the power to cool the fires that burn within them.\nA lack of a particular type of Chi also predisposes the Kuei-jin more toward\npermanent Chi imbalance. If Yin Chi is plentiful but Yang Chi is rare, the Kuei-jin\nare more likely to become ch’ing shih: decayed walking corpses, hideous to behold. A\nSixth Age glutted with Yang Chi begets wild and passionate Kuei-jin, ruled by their\nemotions and capable of spawning dhampyrs (perhaps so many that the remaining\nhuman population begins to shrink). This can create a very different atmosphere for\na chronicle that takes place during the Sixth Age.\n• Demon Chi: The Age of Sorrow is the rise of the Yama Kings and the Demon\nEmperor, and it might lead to their dominion over the Middle Kingdom. As the\npower of Yomi grows, the world’s Chi becomes increasingly tainted or defiled,\nDemon Chi. This is the power of the P’o soul. In the Sixth Age, all of the world’s Chi\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

If Demon Chi is the only\nsource of Chi available to them, then the Kuei-jin can gain and store only as much as\ntheir P’o rating allows. This means that Kuei-jin with greater P’o will feed and survive\nmore easily, while those who rely strongly on Hun will be forced either to allow their\nDemon Soul greater influence or to become the prey of more powerful Kuei-jin.\n• Scarce Chi: The Sixth Age may be a time when Chi drains from the world\nlike blood from a corpse, leaving the Kuei-jin to starve and eventually fade away. As\nthe August Personage denied the Wan Xian the power to breathe, so the Sixth Age\nmight limit or deny the Wan Kuei the ability to feed. Rather than a particular kind\nof Chi becoming scare, as described previously, all Chi becomes harder to find, or at\nleast less accessible to the Kuei-jin. This means the Hungry Dead must more carefully\nhorde their Chi and are more reluctant to spend it unless absolutely necessary.\n• Restricted Feeding: A variation on the Scarce Chi option is that the Age of\nSorrow may limit the Kuei-jin ability to feed on sources of Chi. This has a number\nof variations of its own, depending on just how restricted Kuei-jin feeding becomes.\nIf bodhisattvas and arhats lose the ability to acquire Chi through osmosis, then\nthey must find prey to feed upon once more. This makes the dragon nests worthless\nto the Kuei-jin as a source of Chi, though they might remain useful as gateways\nbetween the worlds. (See the discussion on the Wall and the Spirit Worlds that\nfollows.) Having more elder vampires hunting places a greater strain on the Wan\nKuei’s chosen prey, humanity. Scarlet screens will have to work overtime to conceal\nthe increased feeding and provide sources of Chi for the Kuei-jin. Competition for\nprey might cause friction between different factions of vampires and more hunting\nmight attract the attention of those who hunt the Kuei-jin.\nLimiting Kuei-jin to obtaining Chi from blood makes them much like Western\nKindred in terms of feeding. The more subtle means of breath draining and osmosis\ndenied them, Kuei-jin must hunt prey like the Westerners do. Even the most exalted\nancestor needs vessels to provide blood. This creates even more risk of drawing mortal\nattention, as well as more direct competition for sources of Chi. If it continues over a\nlong period of time, scarlet screens devoted to providing vessels and the art of aspecting\na vessel’s Chi will become more common among the Kuei-jin to meet their needs.\n• Restricted Use: Along with restrictions on obtaining Chi, Kuei-jin might\nface limits on their ability to channel and use the Chi that they do obtain. The nature\nof the Sixth Age might require more Chi to fuel the supernatural Disciplines and\nother powers of the Hungry Dead, allowing Kuei-jin to use those abilities less often\nthan before. How restricted vampires become depends on the amount of Chi their\npowers now demand. At first it might be a relatively slight increase, an additional\nTrait of Chi to use a Discipline, for example. This restriction may increase, with an\ninitial outlay of Chi between two and five Traits needed to activate any particular\nDiscipline, or by Chi costs increasing by 50% to 100% (or even more).\nIncreasing Chi costs might not affect uses of Demon Chi, in which case it\nbecomes the more economical option compared to some Disciplines. Of course,\nusing Demon Chi comes with its own risks, but some Kuei-jin will gladly take them\nin order to save their Yin and Yang Chi for sustenance. This will make the Demon\nArts more common and effective among Kuei-jin, perhaps the first step on the road\nto corruption by the Yama Kings.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "226\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nTHE WALL AND THE SPIRIT WORLDS\nThe connection between the material and spirit worlds is a vital part of the\nexistence of the Kuei-jin and the key to many of their abilities. The Sixth Age might\nlead to an imbalance between the spirit worlds and the Middle Kingdom, making the\nWall harder or easier to overcome, with particular consequences for the Kuei-jin.\n• Raising the Wall: An increase in the strength of the Wall might come from\ndiminishing levels of Chi in the world or from an increasing gulf between the material\nand spiritual worlds. The Wall might strengthen to a particular point and then stop,\nor it could become so thick that travel between the worlds is impossible. See “The\nRising of One Hundred Clouds” for an example of what might happen if the Wall cuts\noff contact between the worlds, trapping the Kuei-jin in the Middle Kingdom.\nAn increase in the strength of the Wall affects not only the ability of the Wan Kuei\nto step from one world to another, but also the ability to feed on ambient Chi, since the\ndifficulty is based on the local Wall rating. This imposes a form of limited feeding, leading\nto an increased need for Chi among the arhats and bodhisattvas of the Hungry Dead.\n• Lowering the Wall: Alternatively, the coming of the Age of Sorrow might\nbatter down the Wall between the worlds, or at least weaken it to the point where\ntraversing them is relatively easy for anyone with the means.\nEXPERIENCE AND ENLIGHTENMENT\nThe Dharmas of the Kuei-jin — or at least those of the Fivefold Path recognized\nby the August Courts — are dedicated to achieving a state of enlightenment. The\nending of a chronicle might signal the end of the characters’ Dharmic journey toward\nthat enlightenment. A time of ending can also be a time of revelation and insight\nthat guides characters toward the enlightenment espoused by their Dharmas.\nSuch momentous lessons in the characters’ unlives can speed up advancement, in\nterms of both Dharma and experience. This allows characters the opportunity, however\nbriefly, to experience the power possessed by arhats and ancestors of the courts, to wield\ngreater status and influence. It can be like a time-lapse film of the characters’ progress,\nbringing them to a point where they can face the challenges of the end of the Age.\nMore opportunities for both auspicious occasions and acts of blindness fit in\nwith the theme of endings and transition. They are “interesting times” indeed for the\nKuei-jin, facing young jina with unprecedented challenges and opportunities. Part\nof the ending story arc might be the characters reaching toward enlightenment or\nturning away from it because of the demands of their unlives.\nBy the same token, the momentous events happening all around the characters\n(and to them, in many cases) are good reasons to grant additional Experience Traits,\nallowing the characters to learn from the hard lessons that face them. You can even\nwaive things like training, saying that even the Kuei-jin have to learn by doing and\nacquire their skills the hard way in such times of crisis.\nIf you’re planning on continuing your chronicle into the Sixth Age, consider\nthe effects of increased Dharma and Experience on the characters. Your troupe\nmight retire them to become the arhats and bodhisattvas of the new Age, or you can\nstart a new chronicle in which the characters function on an entirely different level\nthan before because of their newfound insight and abilities.\nTHE SECOND BREATH\nA vampire’s unlife begins with the Second Breath, when the Kuei-jin’s divided\nspirit escapes the torments of Yomi and rends the Wall to re-enter its corpse (or another\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Whether the Second Breath\nis an opportunity for redemption and enlightenment or a terrible curse, it is the source\nof the Kuei-jin. In the Age of Sorrow, the nature or very existence of the Second Breath\ncould change, and change the Kuei-jin along with it.\n• Fewer Return: In the Sixth Age, fewer souls escape from the clutches of the\nYama Kings and manage to return to the Middle Kingdom to rise as Kuei-jin. A sign\nof the dawning Sixth Age is that fewer Kuei-jin come into being. As they meet Final\nDeath, fewer vampires are left in the world. Eventually, the number of Wan Kuei\ndestroyed might exceed the number that come into being, diminishing their ranks.\nHaving fewer Running Monkeys might seem positive to the elders of the Courts, but\nover time it means fewer subordinates to take on the various tasks of the Courts.\n• None Return: At the extreme end of fewer souls returning from death is the point\nwhere none return, and no new Kuei-jin come into being. This could spell the eventual\nend of the vampires. Although they are eternal, even the Wan Kuei meet Final Death\nin various ways. With none to replace them, the ranks of the various Courts grow fewer\nwith the passing of the years, until the number of Kuei-jin is reduced to a mere handful.\nThis attrition could take centuries, or even millennia, but eventually it will happen. If\nthe Kuei-jin are still faced with enemies like the Shih and the Kin-jin, their inability to\nreplenish their ranks could lead to their end that much sooner.\n• More Return: On the other hand, the Age of Sorrow comes when more souls\nescape from Yomi and rise as the Hungry Dead, swelling the ranks of the Kuei-jin.\nTheir numbers grow, perhaps too rapidly for the slow-moving Courts to adjust to the\ninflux of new vampires. More Running Monkeys means more potential for imbal-\nance, chaos and even rebellion as different factions recruit among the new Kuei-jin\nand try to create power blocks of their own within the Courts. Having more vampires\nalso increases the chances that mortals will discover the existence of the Kuei-jin\nand take action against them. The ancestors of the August Courts might see the\nappearance of many more Kuei-jin as an opportunity, sending more off to support the\nGreat Leap Outward. Kuei-jin holdings outside the Middle Kingdom could also\nbecome places where more Kuei-jin arise among the local Asian populations.\n• All Return: At the extreme end of this scenario, all souls with ties to the Middle\nKingdom become Kuei-jin after death. This quickly and vastly changes the nature of Kuei-\njin existence, as the Hungry Dead quickly become known throughout Asia and the world.\nThe mortal authorities are soon swamped by the rising number of savage and hungry\nvampires, and the existing Kuei-jin are quite unable to hunt and tame so many chih-meh.\nEven though many of the new vampires are destroyed, those killed by them also take the\nSecond Breath. The Age of Sorrow becomes a terrible war between the living and the dead,\nand between the lands of the Middle Kingdom and the outside world as well.\n• Servants of the Yama Kings: In addition to the preceding options, the nature\nof the Second Breath might change in the Sixth Age. Perhaps the souls that escape\nYomi do not escape at all, but are released by the Yama Kings to become not only Kuei-\njin, but akuma dedicated to their service. These vampires are sworn to the Lords of\nYomi before their souls even leave hell, so they rise in control of their vampiric nature\nto take up their duties to corrupt the Kuei-jin of the Middle Kingdom and bring them\ninto the service of their masters. In this case some of the newly created Kuei-jin might\nbe “akuma-born,” or all Kuei-jin who arise after the changing of the Age might be in\nthe service of the Yama Kings. Soon they will join others of their kind, and it will only\nbe a matter of time before the unclaimed Wan Kuei are a hunted minority.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

It is only recently that the signs of the end\nhave become unmistakable, though there are still those who do not wish to believe.\nStorytellers can use these and other inauspicious signs of the impending Sixth\nAge in the buildup to the end of a Laws of the East chronicle. In order to maintain\nsome amount of mystery in your chronicle, we recommend creating your own signs\nof the Sixth Age in addition to those presented here. Not every character should be\naware of what’s going on, and even your most enlightened and insightful characters\nshould receive (at most) only two different hints. Although the decision of which\ncharacters to tap for visions or hints is yours, Merits and Flaws can be a big help\n(especially ones like Medium, Haunted, Oracular Ability and Nightmares). Characters\nwho spend a good deal of time visiting the Yin or Yang Worlds might also make good\ncandidates for hints about the Sixth Age.\nENDING A LAWS OF THE EAST CHRONICLE\n“All good things must end,” as they say, and although it’s possible for a Laws of\nthe East game to run on for years, even the best games grow stale and tired over time.\nYou’ve told what stories you can with the characters. They have changed and\ndeveloped, perhaps becoming quite powerful and influential in their own right. The\nplayers have grown familiar with all the elements of the setting and the chronicle,\nand they have had a hand in creating and shaping them. Sooner or later, it comes\ntime to bring your story to a close and move on to other new and exciting stories you\nand your players can create. It’s time to end your chronicle.\nLet the Sixth Age begin.\nTHE RISING OF ONE HUNDRED CLOUDS\nThroughout their tormented existence, the Kuei-jin have sought peace and\nenlightenment, harmony between the divided halves of their nature: Hun and P’o,\nYin and Yang. There are many stories of bodhisattvas finding the hidden path to the\nslopes of Mount Meru and attaining the enlightenment of the Hundred Clouds, but\nare they just tales, stories for damned souls with no hope of redemption? With the\nportents of the Age of Sorrow all around them, the Kuei-jin hope that there is more\nto their Dharmas than merely holding the demon within them at bay another night,\nand it seems that they might be right.\nINTRODUCTION\nIt ends, not with a roar, but with a sigh, like the resigned last breath of a dying man.\nThe Sixth Age arrives in a form quite unexpected by the Kuei-jin, and they are forced\nto adapt to a diminished existence in the Age of Sorrow, or to accept Final Death at last.\nThe changing of the Age comes with the strengthening of the Wall between the\nMiddle Kingdom and the spirit worlds. It grows from a barrier to an impassable gulf,\nclosing off the world of spirit from the world of matter. The shen, denizens of the Yin\nand Yang Worlds, withdraw. With the ascension of the Demon Emperor, the Yomi\nWorld is sealed off and the Yama Kings are no longer a threat to the world. The\ninhabitants of the Middle Kingdom, Kuei-jin and mortal, are left alone with an\nuncertain future.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

      "text": "229\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nBUILDING THE DRAGON WALL\nThe first sign of the coming Sixth Age is the strengthening of the Wall between\nthe material world and the spirit world. Kuei-jin should notice a gradual increase in\nthe Wall rating of certain areas, making access to the spirit worlds more difficult. It\nbegins first in places where the Wall ratings are the highest. Some areas with initial\nWall ratings of 8 or 9 become completely impassable as the Wall rating exceeds 10.\nThe Wall between the worlds is simply too thick for any force to overcome it. Kuei-\njin who have passed through the Wall in those places might need to travel to find\na place where they can return to the Middle Kingdom.\nWhat begins as a troublesome oddity becomes a serious concern when the Wall\nstrengthens again, and again. Soon all urban areas are completely impassable, and even\nthe wild places and dragon nests have their Chi reduced from wellsprings to mere trickles.\nPassing through the Wall isn’t easy anywhere, and Kuei-jin notice that the Wall seems\nthicker, the spirit worlds more distant, as if they were drifting further out of reach.\nTHE WEIGHT OF DEATH\nThe strengthening of the Wall has a number of effects on Kuei-jin in the Middle\nKingdom and throughout the world. Feeding becomes more difficult for elder Kuei-jin, cut\noff from the Chi of the spirit worlds. The ability to traverse the paths of the spirit worlds\nbecomes less reliable, depriving the Kuei-jin of a valuable weapon in their arsenal. An\nincreasing number of vampires look to their elders for guidance, but they receive none.\nWith the situation surrounding the Two-Fang Serpent Plan becoming increas-\ningly unstable and Kuei-jin around the world concerned about the unexplained\ngrowth of the Wall, the Ancestors of the Courts are expected to act. They do, but\nnot in the ways that are expected.\nINVOLVING THE CHARACTERS\nThe events of this part of “The Rising of One Hundred Clouds” are best\nincorporated into an ongoing Laws of the East chronicle as background material\nand a new wrinkle on whatever challenges the characters already face. For example,\nthe characters might notice an increase in the difficulty of overcoming the Wall in\nsome places at first, followed by even greater increases. Perhaps an attempt to enter\nor leave the spirit worlds fails unexpectedly, forcing the characters to improvise.\nNor are the Kuei-jin the only ones to be affected by this sudden shift. Spirits and\nother shen known to them are suddenly absent or more difficult to contact. Those\nplaces where shen have typically gathered grow deserted.\nTHE CLOUDS RISE\nAs the Wall becomes impassable, ancestors of the Kuei-jin courts begin to\ndisappear. The realization of the dawning Sixth Age has proven a tremendous\nmoment of insight for the eldest of the Kuei-jin, allowing some of them to achieve\nthe enlightenment of dâh. They have ascended to the Hundred Clouds. Like the\nspirit worlds, they are leaving the Middle Kingdom, and the younger Kuei-jin,\nbehind. For other elder Kuei-jin, the rising of the Wall means something else. The\nYama Kings call the hidden akuma of the courts home, and some ancestors walk into\nHell willingly, while others are dragged there by the demons to pay their debts to the\nLords of Yomi. Either way, they will not return.\nIf the characters have an elder mentor, ally or even enemy, they should be\nwitness to that bodhisattva’s departure.

Even if the\nelder was antagonistic toward the characters before, the time for enmity is past. Then\nthe ancestor steps across the Wall, heedless of the local difficulty of doing so, and\nvanishes into the spirit worlds, never to be seen again. This is an excellent\nopportunity to start the end with a dramatic and possibly pivotal scene for your\ncharacters — savor it if you think your players will appreciate it.\nFOLLOWING THE BODHISATTVA’S PATH\nThe departure of so many ancestors and bodhisattvas throws the Kuei-jin courts\ninto chaos. Younger mandarins and jina attempt to step in and take up the reins of\npower, but many factions are seeking to do the same. During this time, the Kuei-jin\nare divided, following various goals. Some wish to follow in the footsteps of the\nancestors to find their path to Mount Meru. Others try to seize the opportunity to\nattain power and influence, even control over the courts now that the ancestors are\ngone. Finally, some Kuei-jin see the separation of the spirit worlds as a sign that they\nwill never achieve true enlightenment, or that they will achieve it only through\ndeath, so they set about trying to destroy themselves and possibly the world. The\ncharacters may try to follow any or all of these paths, and they might get entangled\nin the efforts of other Wan Kuei.\n• Seeking Enlightenment: Many Kuei-jin believe that the vanished ancestors\nachieved the enlightenment of the Hundred Clouds, that they discovered the secret\nof true immortality and freedom from cursed unlife. These younger vampires diligently\npursue the same goal, usually by renewed dedication to their Dharmas and efforts to\nexplore the paths of the spirit worlds before they are lost to the Kuei-jin altogether.\nThere might be an exodus into the Yin or Yang World before the Walls closes them\noff altogether. Even more Kuei-jin depart the Middle Kingdom, never to return.\nExtremists and would-be gurus among the various Dharmas become more common.\n• Seeking Power: The departure of the ancestors represents an unprecedented\nopportunity for younger Kuei-jin to finally seize power. Some ancestors carefully set\ntheir affairs in order and appoint successors to their duties, but others do not, and\nsome successions are disputed. Shadow wars break out among all of the courts of the\nMiddle Kingdom as the mandarins and jina struggle for power and control. If the\nGreat Leap Outward hasn’t already collapsed from the growth of the Wall, it almost\ncertainly will once the August Courts turn inward, consumed by their own affairs.\nThe power struggles of the Cathayans can form the basis for an entire short\nchronicle, or they can quickly erode the structure and traditions of the courts,\nbringing on the chaos of the Sixth Age.\n• Seeking Death: Finally, some Kuei-jin are overcome with despair and\nhopelessness. With the signs of the Sixth Age all around them, these vampires follow\nthe example of those ancestors who chose Final Death over unlife in the Age of\nSorrow. They face the Eye of Heaven or find other means of ending their existence.\nSome Kuei-jin might not deliberately seek death but might find it anyway when their\nenemies begin moving against them.\nTHE BARRED GATES OF HELL\nPerhaps the most important effect of the Wall’s growth is that it closes off more\nthan just the Yin and Yang Worlds. Like the Great Wall protecting China from the\ninvasion of barbarians, it also closes the Middle Kingdom off from the Yomi World\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Their akuma servants are either drawn into Hell to serve their masters there\nfor all time, or they are abandoned to their fate (i.e., inevitable Final Death at the\nhands of Kuei-jin hunters). Although one of the Yama Kings must assume the throne\nof the Demon Emperor as foretold, the hosts of Yomi Wan are no longer a threat to\nthe material world.\nOf course, this also means that no souls return from beyond the Wall to inhabit\ntheir corpses and rise as the Hungry Dead. From the moment the gates of Hell are\nclosed, no more Kuei-jin arise in the world and no more will ever arise. The Wan Kuei\nare the last of their kind. If mortal souls are still drawn into Yomi upon their deaths,\nnone of them return to tell of it. The fate of Yulan-jin is yours to decide. Perhaps their\nnext Little Death is their last, returning them to Yomi, from which they cannot return.\nOr perhaps from now on, the Little Death carries them somewhere entirely different.\nCONCLUSIONS\nYou can take this story in several different directions, depending on the\noutcome you prefer. The Sixth Age can spell the end of the Kuei-jin and all\nsupernatural forces in the World of Darkness, or it might mean only a significant\nchange in the world and in the existence of the Hungry Dead.\nRATS IN THE WALLS\nOnce the Wall has cut off all contact with the spirit worlds, things might settle\ninto a new status quo among the surviving supernatural inhabitants of the World of\nDarkness. True, there will be no more Kuei-jin taking the Second Breath, and most\nof the shen are gone, but the vampires that remain are still immortal. Even faced with\ndemon-hunters and other enemies, they can survive for quite some time, continuing\nto follow their Dharmas and their own agendas, while reconstructing Kuei-jin\nsociety as best they can. This can lead to a new and different Laws of the East\nchronicle where Kuei-jin are not as numerous or powerful, in a world where they are\nslowly fading.\nTHE HAMMER FALLS\nThe disarray within the courts of the Kuei-jin has not gone unnoticed. The growth\nof the Wall and the increased need for Chi it created among the elders has attracted the\nattention of those aware of the Kuei-jin, notably the Shih and the Western Kindred, both\nof whom see the opportunity to seize upon their enemy’s weakness. With so many\nbodhisattvas and arhats gone, the enemies of the Wan Kuei strike, from Shih demon-\nhunters to Strike Force Zero agents to Kin-jin coteries, the weakened position of the\nKuei-jin invites all manner of attack. In this scenario, it is only a matter of time before\nthe enemies of the Kuei-jin hunt them all down and destroy them.\nSERPENT BITES THE HAND\nThe struggle between East and West, between the Kuei-jin and the Kindred, has\nbeen a theme of Laws of the East from the very beginning. The conflict heated up with\nthe Great Leap Outward and the Two-Fang Serpent Plan that sent Kuei-jin to the west\ncoast of North America, where they seized control of the cities of Los Angeles and later\nSan Francisco. The invasion provoked a shadow war between the Eastern and Western\nvampires. Now, with the coming of the Sixth Age, that war draws to a fateful conclusion.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Not only have the Tremere been instrumental in the\nCamarilla’s counterstrikes against the invading Cathayans but Tremere Oliver Thrace\nalso apparently betrayed the Camarilla to the Quincunx in order to save his own skin.\nThis act placed certain Kindred secrets into Cathayan hands and gave them an\nadvantage over their Western enemies. The Kuei-jin have underestimated Oliver\nThrace, though, and their error in judgment will cost them, and the world, dearly.\nThrace has used his time as a “guest” of the Quincunx to study the Kuei-jin and\nlearn about them. He has learned how the Asian vampires come into being through\nthe descent into Yomi and the return to the world of the living when they take the\nSecond Breath. More importantly, he has contacted the Yama Kings and made a\ndevil’s bargain. He has pledged his service to Yomi in exchange for the means to\nensure permanent defeat for the Kuei-jin in their conflict.\nWith Thrace’s aid, the Tremere perform a powerful ritual that severs the ties\nbetween the Kuei-jin and the material world, banishing them back to Yomi forever and\npreventing any new souls from taking the Second Breath. The Kuei-jin are decimated\nand, as the ritual spreads, in danger of becoming extinct. The Kindred have won, but\nthey have also been deceived. The destruction of the Kuei-jin and the collection of so\nmany powerful souls grants the Yama Kings what they need to open the gates of the\nYomi World. The Tremere become the akuma pawns of the Thousand Hells, with\nOliver Thrace as agent of the Demon Emperor. The Kindred can either bow to their\nnew master or be hunted down and destroyed along with his other enemies.\nRISE OF THE WHITE DEVIL\nHow early the characters become involved with Oliver Thrace depends on\ntheir relationship with the rogue Tremere and with the August Courts of the\nQuincunx in the chronicle. If Thrace is already a recurring character in your\nchronicle, then it’s likely the characters are acquainted with him when he finally\nplays his hand. This scenario is particularly appropriate if Oliver Thrace has been a\nregular antagonist for the characters.\nIf Thrace has not entered the chronicle in the past, or the characters are not in\nthe good graces of the Quincunx, then you need to approach things differently to\nintroduce the characters to Thrace and the potential threat that he poses.

This is no oversight. Rather, while it is an intriguing vision of the End\nTimes, it was designed primarily for chronicles involving Shih demon-\nhunters as characters. While Shih characters can certainly be found in Laws\nof the East, on the whole they do not form the basis of entire troupes, and\ncombined with the increased antagonism it fosters between Shih characters\nand the rest of the shen, it was decided that this scenario was best left largely\nfor tabletop play. Therefore, while Storytellers are certainly free to look up\n“The Trumpet of Mt. Meru” in that book and adapt what they find there for\nuse in their Mind’s Eye Theatre chronicle, it has not been included here.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Given how important his\nplans become, it should be fairly easy to get a diverse group of characters interested in\nhis capture before long by dropping a few hints as to his grand scheme.\nTHRACE’S ESCAPE\nUltimately, despite the best efforts of the characters or their connections,\nThrace escapes from the Quincunx and makes his way back to his fellow Tremere.\nThrace’s means of escape are up to you. What is important is that he makes good his\nescape before anyone can prevent it, although the characters may pursue Thrace one\nthey discover that he’s gone. Some potential escape routes include rescue by akuma\nor fellow Tremere, Thaumaturgy rituals, spirit walking or other esoteric means.\nNo matter what option you ultimately choose, it’s important to avoid giving the\nplayers the perception that Thrace’s escape is inevitable. As soon as your players start\nto feel as though you’re herding them toward a particular outcome, their faith in your\nchronicle will start to wane. If your characters carry out a well-developed plan to\ncapture Thrace or to prevent his escape, that’s perfectly fine. He can always escape later\nusing a different method, after all.\nIf they manage to keep him confined, preventing the start of the Screaming Plague,\nthis might be the time to start with a different end scenario, rather than inventing an\nimplausible reason for Thrace to disappear. Like reality, a good Mind’s Eye Theatre game\nshould have infinite possibilities. Nothing is set in stone or fated to happen, so if your\ncharacters are able to take Thrace out of the picture, more power to them. The end will\nstill come, just in a different way than they (or you) might have expected.\nTHE SCREAMING PLAGUE\nOliver Thrace teaches the essentials of the Breaking the Demon Bonds rite to\nother Tremere, at least enough to convince them that the ritual can work and that\nthey need him in order to perform it properly. Eager to eliminate the Kuei-jin threat,\nthe Camarilla grants Thrace permission to perform the ritual, beginning in the\noccupied areas of California. The ritual breaks the ties holding the Kuei-jin to their\nmortal corpses, sending them back into exile in Yomi. To observers in the material\nworld, the Kuei-jin simply begin keeling over and rotting away en masse, their spirits\ndragged screaming back into Hell.\nThe Wan Kuei call this outbreak the Screaming Plague, and they find that no\ndefense is sufficient to work against it. Kuei-jin meet Final Death by the dozens, then\nthe hundreds, as the Tremere continue the ritual and its power expands. At your\ndiscretion, Kuei-jin who attempt to escape into the Yin World might be safe, since\nafter being separated from their bodies, they are really little more than wraiths. If\nthey succeed in doing so, though, crossing the Wall back into the Middle Kingdom\nstill sends them instantly back to Yomi unless the ritual has been stopped.\nDRAGGED DOWN INTO HELL\nThe characters are in the presence of other Kuei-jin — perhaps their elders are\nwelcoming them to the city or hearing a report of their activities — when one of the\nKuei-jin convulses, screams in agony and collapses. Almost immediately the Kuei-jin’s\ncorpse begins to rot into dust. Then another one collapses, and another.

So the first vampires destroyed by it are the eldest in the city, throwing\neverything into chaos as the younger mandarins and jina are forced to assume control,\nonly to eventually fall victim to what becomes known as the “Screaming Plague.”\nThe characters are left without the guidance of their elders, but also with the\nopportunity to take charge of the situation, if they can. Unfortunately, there is little\nthey can do except try to find out what is happening and help organize an evacuation\nof the surviving Kuei-jin, since the ritual destroys the eldest vampires on the first\nnight, then slowly builds in power until no Kuei-jin can survive in the area. Younger\nvampires show signs resembling permanent Yin imbalance after the first day, and\nafter seven days, even the youngest Kuei-jin in the city is destroyed. (This timeline\nmight need to be adjusted to suit the needs of your chronicle. It is advised, however,\nnot to make it too long, lest the urgency of the threat be lost.)\nWhat happens next depends on what the characters do. They might try to find\na way to stop the Tremere ritual, seek a cure or defense against the Screaming Plague,\nor even be willing to bargain with one of the Yama Kings in order to ensure their own\nsurvival (and that of their kind).\nQUINCUNX COUNTERSTRIKE\nIf the characters believe (correctly) that Oliver Thrace and the Tremere are\nresponsible for the Screaming Plague, they might want to try to stop the Kin-jin.\nKuei-jin may discover the origin of the plague through their own rituals and Occult\nknowledge, although a means of overcoming the Tremere ritual is a far more\ncomplicated matter, particularly given the loss of so many ancestors and mandarins.\nBy the time the remaining Kuei-jin figure out a defense, it could be too late.\nOne possibility is to strike against the Tremere and stop them from continuing\nthe ritual. The Kuei-jin may make a concerted effort to launch an attack on every\nTremere chantry that they can reach. The difficulty is that the ritual has an extensive\nreach and the Tremere are well guarded by their Camarilla allies, who intend to buy\nthem the time they need to wipe out the Cathayans once and for all. Any attack on\na chantry would have to be well coordinated and quick, and the Kuei-jin would face\na group of well-armed Kin-jin defenders.\nThis allows you the opportunity to run some major battle scenes between the\nKuei-jin and their enemies. Out of their desperation to survive, the Kuei-jin might\neven ignore the usual efforts to hide from the mortal world, compromising the\nexistence of vampires among mortals.\nDEVIL’S BARGAIN\nAlthough the remaining Kuei-jin might not have either the time or the means to\ncreate a defense against the Tremere rituals, they do have one other option: bargaining\nwith the Yama Kings who gave Oliver Thrace the secrets of the ritual in the first place.\nDoing so requires a wu to either travel into Yomi or to summon a Yama King to Earth\n— neither particularly easy tasks. They can either try to cut a deal with the particular\nYama Kings who gave Thrace the ritual (Mikaboshi and Tou Mu), or they can contact\none (or more) of the other Yama Kings.\nNegotiation with one or more of the Yama Kings opens an excellent opportunity for\nextended roleplaying. Depending on which Yama King the characters decide to contact,\nthey might have to go to Yomi to negotiate or submit to a test to prove their worth before\nthe Yama King will even hear them.

The more time you spend planning their\nconfrontation with one of the Yama Kings — whom they’ve most likely spent the majority\nof the game trying to avoid — the more your players will thank you for it later.\nRAISED UPON TEN THOUSAND SOULS\nThe purpose of the Breaking the Demon Bonds rite is actually twofold. First, it\nallows the Tremere to eliminate the Kuei-jin, sending their souls to Yomi. But it also\nputs the souls of the destroyed Kuei-jin into the hands of Mikaboshi and Tou Mu,\ngreatly increasing their power. It corrupts the Tremere and binds their souls to the\nservice of the Yama Kings. As the ritual nears its conclusion, the Sixth Age dawns\nand the Yama Kings come to claim their rightful thrones.\nThe Tremere chantries where the ritual is performed become broken mirrors,\ngateways into the Yomi World, as the fabric of the Wall is ripped apart by the passage\nof so many Kuei-jin torn from their corpses and cast back into Hell. Corrupt Chi\nwells up from these sores in the surface of the world, spreading outward. The Tremere\nare the first to be corrupted by it, and they become the demonically tainted servants\nof the Yama Kings. But that is only the beginning.\nAt first, nearly invisible waves of corrupt Chi spread a pall across the world.\nDespair and corruption intensifies immensely. Riots and small wars break out as\nmortals are influenced by the power of Yomi. Violence and crime skyrocket. The\nauthorities respond with increasingly brutal countermeasures. Despite their best\nefforts, supernatural beings such as the Kindred can do nothing to stop this tsunami\nof violence and destructiveness. In fact, they also become caught up in it, as childe\nrebels against elder, anarch against Camarilla, turning on each other like wild dogs.\nEven at this point, characters may try to stem the tide of Yomi’s victory. They\nmight be able to seal one of the hellgates created by the Tremere ritual, either with\na ritual of their own or through self-sacrifice. If they’re successful, they create a small\nisland of untainted Chi, which might become a stronghold to oppose the Yama\nKings, if the chronicle continues. Otherwise, it is merely a fading remnant of the\nFifth Age that will eventually yield to the inevitable.\nAs the violence peaks, Yomi begins to flood into the world through the rents\nand gaps in the Wall, spreading everywhere. Hordes of demons and ghosts are loosed.\nMillions die at the hands of the creatures of Hell, and their souls swell the ranks of\nthe Yama Kings’ armies.

Alternatively, the\ncharacters could be Shih demon-hunters, the last defenders of humanity, seeking to\noverthrow the tyrant Yama Kings (or perhaps even an alliance between the Shih and\nthe remaining Wan Kuei).\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

If you prefer, you could instead run\na chronicle where characters exiled to Yomi or the Yin World try to work from within\nto destroy the power base of the Demon Emperor.\nWICKED CITY\nFor Ages, the Yama Kings have fought and struggled for dominion over souls, for\ngreater power both in Yomi and in the Middle Kingdom. They have sought the souls\nof the Kuei-jin in particular, souls that were once theirs, but which escaped from the\ntorments of Yomi to return to the world of the living. All of those struggles have been\ntoward one end: the coming of the Sixth Age and the time when one of the Yama Kings\nwould ascend to the throne of the Demon Emperor and rule over the world. That time\nhas come, and the Lords of Yomi — one in particular — are ready to make their move.\nINTRODUCTION\nMikaboshi, Lord of the Wicked City, is something of a non-traditional Yama\nKing, fascinated with the trappings and doings of the modern world, rather than\nsome hell described in ancient sutras. Mikaboshi is a cutting-edge demon, invested\nin what he sees as a growth market — one that is about to pay off handsomely.\nCities, and the blight they breed, are Mikaboshi’s stock in trade. Over the years,\nhe has wormed tendrils of his Wicked City into metropolises across the world. Not\njust in the Middle Kingdom, but in any city the Kuei-jin have penetrated. His latest\nconquests have been the North American cities occupied by the Ocean-Crossing\nCrusaders of the Great Leap Outward, but he has been cultivating cities throughout\nthe Middle Kingdom for many years now. Throughout all those cities, in the darkest\nplaces of urban decay, the seeds of Mikaboshi’s power germinate, and now the time\nis right for them to sprout.\nOne of the seeds that the Lord of the Wicked City has planted is in the heart\nof Strike Force Zero, the secret organization of Japanese demon-hunters. Although\nthe Zaibatsu considers SF0 its agents for hunting down and eliminating “Reality\nDeviants,” it is unaware that the Strike Force ultimately serves Mikaboshi’s purpose\nby eliminating potential threats and agents of his rivals, ensuring that the Yama King\nwill rise to power when the time is right.\nBROKEN MIRRORS\nThe first signs of Mikaboshi’s rise to power are the places where the flows of Chi\nhave become so fouled by urban blight that the Wall has grown tattered and as thin\nas rice paper, allowing light and shadows from Yomi to spill over into the material\nworld. These “broken mirrors” are extensions of Mikaboshi’s Hell on Earth, places\nwhere the Wicked City touches the real world and where it is possible to step\nbetween the two, sometimes without even knowing it.\nA wu can discover a broken mirror in whatever city it calls home. Perhaps the\ncharacters are asked to investigate strange portents and sightings in the area or they\ndo so on their own initiative. They discover that the Yomi World is pressing its way\ninto the Middle Kingdom like a cancer, and that it is growing. In fact, after they are\ndiscovered, the broken mirrors begin to grow and multiply. Not only do they begin\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Rituals to cleanse and re-\nbalance the Chi in an area are temporarily effective against some of the newly formed\nsores in the skin of reality, but the hellgates erupt elsewhere a short while later, and\nthe sorcerers of the Kuei-jin cannot keep pace with their appearances.\nThe signs are clear. The Sixth Age has come, and the Kuei-jin must prepare for war.\nFIRST, PREPARE FOR WAR\nAlthough most Kuei-jin — at least the followers of the Fivefold Way of Xue —\nagree that it is their duty to oppose the Yama Kings and their akuma servants, the\ncourts of the Wan Kuei are nowhere near united. Not even the impending invasion\nof Hell can force them to set aside their differences to work together, though the\nefforts of the characters might.\nAncestors and arhats call war councils and meetings across the Middle King-\ndom. Different courts prepare to repel the forces of Yomi, whatever the cost. After\nall, the Kuei-jin have all experienced the domain and the power of the Yama Kings\nfirsthand, and they know that even Final Death is preferable to existing in the realm\nof Yomi on Earth. In fact, some Kuei-jin, faced with the arrival of the Sixth Age,\nmight choose Final Death rather than battle the armies of the Yama Kings, leading\nthem to face the Eye of Heaven or otherwise abandon their hold on unlife.\nEvery wu in the city can take part in various war councils. If the characters are in\npositions of influence, they might be entrusted with planning the defense of their area\nor domain. If not, then perhaps the characters’ superiors fall victim to an attack by\nakuma or one of the first assaults by Strike Force Zero, leaving the characters in charge.\nCharacters can also take on a diplomatic role, going among the different courts\nof the Kuei-jin trying to rally support for a unified defense against the Yomi Wan,\nperhaps even a pre-emptive strike that takes the fight to the Yama Kings themselves.\nThey can act as representatives of a particular court or ancestor, or they can go it alone,\ntrying to put together an alliance among the suspicious and treacherous undead.\nHow successful the characters are depends on their efforts, but even the most\nsuccessful plans sometimes go awry, and the Kuei-jin must deal with Mikaboshi’s\nown preemptive strikes by the Yama King’s secret weapon.\nZERO HOUR\nThe secret organization known as Strike Force Zero has been hunting monsters\nfor years, using high-tech weapons and equipment beyond that of even the most\nsophisticated government black-ops program. What most of the agents of SF0 don’t\nknow is that their equipment and their mandate comes from the Zaibatsu, the\nJapanese branch of the Technocracy — a secret alliance that seeks to define and\ncontrol the nature of reality. What even the Zaibatsu doesn’t know is that Strike\nForce Zero ultimately serves Mikaboshi’s ends. The Lord of the Wicked City intends\nto infuse the technology and the agents of Strike Force Zero with his corrupt Chi and\nturn the hunters of demons into his secret weapons.\nAs the Kuei-jin discover and investigate the broken mirrors spreading throughout\nthe world’s cities, they also encounter Strike Force Zero agents, apparently doing the\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Failing that, they attempt\nto simply destroy the vampires. These encounters become increasingly common, and\nSF0 begins to gather more information about the Kuei-jin and their activities.\nThe more time the SF0 agents spend in the broken mirrors, the more the corrupt\nDemon Chi of Yomi and the Wicked City begins to influence them. This influence\nspreads among the other agents of the organization like a plague, as SF0 spends more\ntime “investigating” the broken mirrors. Characters might notice that the mortal\nagents become more callous and violent than usual. They care less for civilian\ncasualties or the need for secrecy, doing whatever it takes to get at the monsters\nthey’re hunting. They’re willing to allow torture, mutilation and massive collateral\ndamage — whatever it takes to get the job done.\nRISE OF THE WICKED CITY\nOnce Mikaboshi’s broken mirrors have corrupted most of the agents of Strike\nForce Zero and the characters have had an opportunity to try to rally the forces of the\nMiddle Kingdom to repel the threat of the Yama Kings, the next step in Mikaboshi’s\nplan takes place. The corrupt Demon Chi of the broken mirrors and the wickedness\nit inspires in the mortal populace causes the sores in the world’s Chi to expand, as the\nWicked City begins to invade the Middle Kingdom and eat away at reality.\nInitially, the broken mirrors are confined to urban areas, which are incorpo-\nrated into Mikaboshi’s Wicked City. Soon, all major cities in the world are part of\nthe Yama King’s domain. The shen inhabiting them have no choice but to flee or to\nswear their allegiance to Mikaboshi. This includes Western cities and shen such as\nthe Kin-jin, who find their own squabbles brought to a halt by the sudden invasion.\nMany Kin-jin fall victim to the corruption of Yomi, giving themselves over to\nMikaboshi for the opportunity to feed within his domain, tainted by the Demon Chi\nof the mortals they hunt.\nMikaboshi’s agents hunt Kuei-jin in cities from Hong Kong to San Francisco.\nAkuma become increasingly common and emerge from the shadows to take their place\nleading hunting parties. Although they attempt to hold them, the August Courts are\nforced to retreat from their urban stronghold, at the cost of many Kuei-jin being\ndestroyed by Mikaboshi’s mechanized demons. The same is true for courts across the\nMiddle Kingdom. The savage Kuei-jin of the Golden Courts fare slightly better than\nthe rest, able to flee into the jungles, but even there the hunters become the hunted.\nCharacters might attempt to help defend one or more of the courts against the\ninvasion of demons, bakemono and akuma, fighting a losing battle against the forces\nof the Wicked City before they are forced to either flee or make a final stand they\ncan’t possibly survive. Meeting Final Death in the defense of Kuei-jin history and\ntradition is a fitting end for some characters, while others might help engineer an\nevacuation of the strongholds of the Hungry Dead, allowing surviving Kuei-jin to\nescape the cities that are now under the Yama King’s dominion.\nDEFENDING THE DRAGON NESTS\nOnce the broken mirrors have extended over all the cities in the world, their\ncharacter changes significantly. Every city becomes an extension of the Wicked\nCity, a beachhead of the Yomi World. The buildings become taller, more jagged and\nloom overhead: dark towers that block out the sun and leave the streets in perpetual\nshadow.

Clouds gather day and night over the\ntops of the towers of glass and steel, blocking out the sun and spitting acidic rain\ndown on the masses below.\nThe inhabitants of the cities are transformed as well. Some become raw\nmaterials for the factories and chop shops turning out legions of Mikaboshi’s Demons\nof Iron and Violence. The rest are still twisted by the corruption, looking out solely\nfor themselves and more than willing to look the other way as Mikaboshi works his\nwill on the world. Order in the cities is brutally maintained while law and order in\nthe countryside gives way to fear and panic.\nThen the cities begin to grow.\nIt’s slow at first, but then it comes increasingly faster, to the point where the urban\ncenters expand outward hundreds of feet each day. They send out root-like tendrils of\nwire, asphalt and steel that dig deep into the Earth. They flow along roads, rivers and\nthe dragon lines of Chi, stretching out in all directions, spreading like bloodstains in\nthe fabric of the Earth, and nothing seems able to halt their growth. Indeed, anyone\nwho tries must deal with legions of the Yama King’s demons and bakemono.\nThe Wicked City infiltrates and assimilates places with the lowest ambient Chi\nfirst, gradually working its way into the dragon lines and, finally, the dragon nests, to\nconsume the Chi there and feed it into the great machine of Mikaboshi’s empire.\nTherefore, the dragon nests are the last havens of the Kuei-jin and any others who oppose\nMikaboshi’s conquest. The characters might attempt to organize the defense of the\ndragon nests, hoping to keep such powerful sources of Chi from falling to the Yama King.\nThe nests also serve as the last remaining sources of Yin and Yang Chi for the Kuei-jin,\nallowing them to feed without being corrupted by the Demon Chi of Yomi.\nFURTHER STORIES\nIn addition to being the end of a Laws of the East chronicle, “Wicked City” can\nserve as the basis for an entirely new chronicle, set in a Sixth Age under the rule of\nthe Yama King Mikaboshi and his Iron Empress, Tou Mu. In this world, the Wicked\nCity extends everywhere, even paving over the oceans, creating vast, lightless seas\nbeneath iron and concrete skies. Black, skeletal buildings reach up to a sky the color\nof blood, covered with slate-gray clouds that pour poisonous rain. All creatures are\nsubject to Mikaboshi’s will, cogs in the vast machine that is the Wicked City, ruled\nby his demon lieutenants, some of them akuma Kuei-jin.\nThe characters in this chronicle can be Kuei-jin survivors of Mikaboshi’s purge,\nrogue agents of Strike Force Zero, Shih demon-hunters, dhampyrs, or any combina-\ntion thereof. Perhaps the characters are mortals born and raised in this hellish world,\nrecruited by surviving demon-hunters and trained as part of an underground\nresistance against the Demon Emperor’s rule. There is a prophecy, foretold in\nancient sutras, that says the righteous will one day rise up against the Demon\nEmperor and his Wicked City will be swept away, bringing about a new Age of peace,\nbeauty and serenity.

Nonetheless, the\nimmortals of the World of Darkness see the growing signs and portents that suggest\ntheir efforts to restore the balance, to serve as champions of life, might have come\ntoo late. Everywhere there are signs of corruption and the rising power of Apophis,\nand it seems that the Undying, who once had all eternity stretched out before them,\nare rapidly running out of time.\nThis chapter details the end of the World of Darkness as seen by the Undying\n— the mummies of Egypt, described in Laws of the Resurrection. It describes two\ndifferent approaches to the last days of the Reborn and how they deal with the ending\nof an existence they once thought would never end. Like the endings given in this\nbook, the scenarios are speculation, simply two of the possibilities of what might\nhappen. As always, the ultimate direction of the story is up to the Storyteller.\nAPOPHIS ASCENDS\nOsiris and Isis created the first Egyptian mummies to defend the world from the\nminions of Apophis.

Yet, some ghosts refuse the\ngift of resurrection, for reasons of madness or pride or cynicism. It is their right, and\nnone receive a second chance.

She made her own perilous hajj to the Web of\nFaith and sought out the cultists of which the tem-akh had spoken. She repre-\nsented a sorrow to them, for they could not give her life.

Something called her away from her masquerades\namong the undead, her endless, pointless series of impersonations. Something had\ncalled her into the deep desert of Egypt to receive a prophecy — and a message.\nEurydice would live again, and vanished Set would no longer bear favor as the\nChosen of Apophis.\nEurydice offered gracious hospitality to her strange and godlike guest, butcher-\ning her servants when they failed to bring sufficient victims to satisfy the Ancient’s\nhunger. Yet, little more than mad rambles escaped Kemintiri’s blood-soaked lips. In\ntime, Eurydice grew impatient with the babble. She had heard enough, and still,\ndreadful hope stirred in her unbeating heart. As Set’s child lay writhing in the throes\nof some seizure or revelation one evening — Eurydice no longer cared which — the\narisen ghost plunged a stake into the vampire’s heart. Kemintiri stilled and muttered\nno more. Under order from their ambitious leader, the Amkhat took the blood of\ntheir captive and worked foul alchemy upon it. Her ramblings and fragmented notes\nmerged with stolen and forbidden spells of necromancy. Together, the Amkhat\nmade their own mockery of the Spell of Life, crude and rooted in magic older and\ndeeper than even they knew.\nA great assembly of the Amkhat gathered in a secret place for the casting of the\nspell. Fully one-third perished when the magic grew beyond their control and sucked\naway their souls to fuel the forbidden enchantment. Infused with alchemy distilled\nfrom the blood of Kemintiri, and through her the blood of the first Chosen of\nApophis, Eurydice was transformed. For seven agonizing beats her heart pumped,\nand seven breaths filled her dead lungs. And yet, she did not live. Out of failure she\nbecame something more, something terrible. The favor of her god lay upon her with\ndread purpose, and she knew at last how she might live again. Apophis stirred\nbeneath the realm of the dead, rising in slow coils. He would be her tem-akh and she\nwas now his chosen instrument of that ascent. All she needed was to reclaim the\nseven ifrit of the Great Serpent’s soul from those who dared call themselves Children\nof Apophis. Their death would be her life.\nAnd her life would birth Apophis into this world.\nASSASSINATION\nAs the story begins, Eurydice has sent her stalkers to locate and slay the\nseven Apepnu. The characters should discover this plot early enough to inter-\nvene before Eurydice grows too powerful. Presented here are the two most likely\ndiscovery scenarios.\nTHE FACE OF EVIL\nThe characters have already been tracking the actions of a Bane mummy,\nperhaps as part of an earlier story. Well-prepared with equipment, architectural\nplans and strategy, they break into the lair of one of the ancient fiends only to find\nthe mangled corpses of his guards strewn about and the walls spattered with warm\ngore. The dwar carefully works its way through secret passages, half-sprung traps and\nother obstacles to the innermost sanctum of the fortified haven. There the charac-\nters find their undying quarry kneeling battered and bleeding, surrounded by a pack\nof strange animal-headed creatures. Before any of the characters can intervene, the\nleader of the pack strikes a deathblow and inserts a long tongue into one of the\nApepnu’s wounds.

As the characters leap into the fray\nor prepare for attack, the leader of the beasts barks an order in its strange rasping\nlanguage and the entire pack dissolves into wisps of fine sand. Alone in the silence\nof the abattoir, the characters may retrieve the corpse of their slain enemy or simply\nescape to inform their superiors.\nAN UNLIKELY TALE\nLess militant Amenti might learn about the strange assassination of the Bane\nMummy indirectly. Superiors could forward the transcripts and reports provided by\nmummies who directly observed such events. Alternatively, the characters’ dwar\nmight be called to assist in the interrogation of a mortal witness who hid and saw\neverything through a crack in a doorway. Such a witness would be unreliable at best,\nand probably quite mad from the sheer horror of the events. Information obtained\nfrom such questioning would be rife with falsehoods and exaggerations, while\ncontaining enough truth to scare the characters and suggest the arrival of a new\nplayer in the immortal game. For a stranger twist, the characters might find\nthemselves approached by a Four Jar or other thrall of the murdered Apepnu, willing\nto trade information for protection from the monsters. The characters shouldn’t\ntrust such a tainted informant and might suspect a trap. But then, what could scare\nan undead monster so badly that it would turn to its enemies for safety? Such an\nencounter should shake the characters and impress upon them the level of danger\nposed by the mysterious assassins.\nRegardless of how the characters learn of the first assassination, it will not be\nthe last. Within a week of the killing, another Bane Mummy dies under similarly\ngruesome circumstances. It is clear that someone — or something — is systemati-\ncally hunting the Apepnu. The five remaining Bane Mummies scatter, each\nsuspecting one another of masterminding the deaths. The leadership of the Amenti\nshares this suspicion, yet none of the evidence points to any of the survivors as\nsuspects. No one wants to believe that there might be a new power among them, least\nof all the Children of Apophis.\nSTALKING THE STALKERS\nIn the wake of the two assassinations, the Apepnu go to ground. Many of their\nknown agents or associates likewise retreat into seclusion or take extended vacations\nfar from their usual hangouts. The Amenti leaders sense that this conflict is more\nthan a turf war among the Children of Apophis. Such undying monsters have little\nreason to fear assassination, except as a temporary setback. And yet, the Bane\nMummies hide and send their most trusted agents across the world searching for\nanswers. It soon becomes apparent that they are truly afraid, and that that fear makes\nthem vulnerable. How the characters investigate this situation depends on their\nstrengths and upon the needs of the Storyteller.\nDIGGING FOR CLUES\nThe characters may seek out the killers, trying to find out the identity and origin\nof the strange monstrosities. Such an investigation could follow any number of\npaths. The characters can hunt in old occult libraries and somehow buy, barter or\neven break into private collections on a trail of vague references and tantalizing\nclues.

For example, a single success might yield the fact that\nfigures bearing strong resemblance to the animal-headed assassins appear on a\ncartouche unearthed at a dig south of Abydos. The characters would then have to\ntrack down this cartouche and translate it, which in turn might point them\nelsewhere. Players should not feel they are getting the runaround, but their\ncharacters should recognize the obscurity and elusiveness of their quarry. Amenti\nwho are familiar with the supernatural might be tempted to assume that the attacks\nwere carried out by werewolves or other shapeshifters, but all their research (as well\nas any direct experience they might have had with the beasts) leads them elsewhere.\nThese assassins are not werewolves.\nOther useful facts the characters might obtain through more thorough\nresearch include the following: Though sunlight does them no harm, the beasts\nhunt only at night (three successful tests). The creatures serve Apophis directly,\nand only the greatest champions of the Great Serpent may control them (four\nsuccessful tests). These “stalkers” have the power to travel as the racing\nsandstorm and to smell sin like desert beasts smell water (five successful tests).\nThe ritual used to summon these stalkers requires large quantities of human\nblood and certain specific herbs and unguents. Enterprising characters might\nbegin tracking recent purchases of these materials and match the purchase\nlocations against missing-person reports.\nCALLING IN OLD DEBTS\nMummies less interested in archeology and research can investigate directly,\napproaching long-time informants and those “in the know” about the twilight world\nof the supernatural. It takes little effort to recognize the undercurrent of fear. Old\ncontacts don’t want to talk about it or claim retirement from the business, but very\nfew have any idea what is actually happening. Vampires of Set’s bloodline might\nknow that a few of their older members have disappeared recently (though certainly\nnot the identity of the true culprit), but they might be lying or feigning ignorance.\nOther vampires don’t have a clue, except for the most sorcerously inclined, and even\nthey have only vague omens and auguries of impending doom.\nMages certainly know more, if only because more wizards are prone to checking\ntheir horoscopes and doing the kinds of tarot spreads that simply aren’t fashionable.\nComets, ill omens and other portents suggest that something horrible is coming, and\nall the signs point back to the Middle East and the Web of Faith. It’s not much to\ngo on, but it’s enough to set the stage for deeper inquiry and to establish a tone of\nforeboding. Extremely fortunate and/or well-connected characters can learn about\na recent shake-up in the leadership of the Amkhat and the rise of a new priestess in\nthe cult. The Amkhat should not appear as likely suspects in the assassinations,\nhowever, at least not at first.\nTHE FIEND OF MY FIEND\nInstead of tracking the killers, the characters might focus on the victims.\nInvestigation into the slain Apepnu reveals little of much worth, unfortunately. The\nslain were up to their necks in dirty deals and schemes, but that was usual. Indeed,\nnothing about their unfinished plots seems any more or less dastardly than any\nprevious exploits. Profiling to discover what made the slain immortals any different\nfrom their surviving counterparts suggests only one possible common link: Both of\nthem perished in strongholds they had established long ago.

With the rest of\nthe Apepnu scattered, that common thread no longer applies to any of the others.\nRACING THE HUNT\nIn a slight variation of the preceding, the characters can hunt down the\nsurviving Apepnu — or at least try. Such a feat is extremely dangerous, regardless of\nsuccess. Either the quarry will learn of the search and send minions to deal with the\nmeddlesome sleuths, or the stalkers will discover the search in progress and allow the\ncharacters to ferret out their prey. An extremely “successful” investigation might\nswiftly lead the characters into the grasp of a paranoid Bane Mummy who was eager\nto make an example of any rival or threat. The ancient monster might even believe\nthat the characters are the assassins of his brethren, come to kill him. Those who are\nunfortunate enough to fall captive to the Apepnu can probably look forward to a slow\nand painful demise unless rescued.\nCAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE\nIf the characters do not seem to grasp the gravity of the situation, or if their\ninvestigation runs into a maze of dead ends, the Storyteller may consider dramati-\ncally upping the stakes. Another Bane Mummy dies, but not without taking out\na city block — or a city district — with powerful Dark Hekau. Such a cataclysm\ncertainly points to a previously unconsidered danger, namely the possibility that\nmany innocent bystanders will suffer or perish as a result of the mysterious power\nsquabble. In any case, another Bane Mummy should eventually die during the\ncourse of the investigation.\nTHE GATHERING STORM\nWith the third murder among the Apepnu, the Dja-akh abruptly stops. The\nshrieking clouds pull back into the dark recesses of Duat and an eerie calm settles\nover the Lands of the Dead. However welcome, the lull feels distinctly unnatural —\nless a sign of peace than the rushing out of the tide before a great tsunami.\nWorldwide, the Shroud rating drops by one to a minimum rating of 2 in any specific\nlocation. Mediums, psychics and mages blessed with prescience suffer dreams rife\nwith ill portents, haunted even in waking by images of a red star and a maimed hydra\ncleaved of its many heads. One or more of the characters might experience such\ndreams or dreams of like symbolism. It won’t take much to realize the likely (and,\nindeed, accurate) significance: Apophis recalls its own. What was once many\ngathers to one. The Apepnu are not being murdered… they are being harvested.\nAs portents grow worse and the characters come to realize the plan behind the\nplot, their investigations should bear fruit that leads them steadily back to Eurydice\nand the Amkhat. Any of the following revelations will prove useful.\nBURIED OMENS\nResearch into the stalkers eventually leads to a previously undiscovered crypt\nlocated anywhere the Storyteller desires. Inside the tomb, a torpid vampire lies in a\nsarcophagus surrounded by prophetic murals. The pictures narrate the rise and fall\nof the Amkhat through many civilizations, some of which history does not record or\nremember. The last picture of the series shows a bloody harvest.

The clues could\nbe a trap set by Eurydice or a canny aide, in which case the characters have to fight\ntheir way free from well-armed cultists. A red herring of this magnitude should\ncertainly point the way to the true location if the characters escape, allowing players\nto feel a sense of progress.\nAlternatively, and more simply, the village is as it appears. This is where\nEurydice first summoned her stalkers, and the characters might even find Kemintiri\nhidden and staked in a cistern or deep cellar. The Chosen of Apophis is long gone,\nhaving sought a more auspicious location for her ascension. She might have left\nsurprises or assassins behind to make sure that she is not interrupted during her\napotheosis. In any case, the characters should have the opportunity to interrogate\na captured Amkhat cultist who proudly boasts, “Eurydice will devour the flesh of the\nsun. In darkness she will feast upon the children of Osiris, and all the world shall be\nher blackened banquet.”\nSTRANGE BEDFELLOWS\nAs Eurydice’s plot draws close to cataclysmic fruition, more Apepnu die. The\nmanner of their passing is irrelevant except insofar as the Storyteller wishes\notherwise. The Bane Mummies are beings of immense power, and their passing\nshould not be wholly without incident. Whether they are slain after fierce,\nearthshaking battle or cut down pathetically where they hide, they all die.\nAll except one, that is.\nTwo of the Apepnu yet remain when emissaries of Saatet-ta, the self-appointed\n“Darkener of the Earth,” approaches the Amenti with an offer. She will cooperate\ntoward the singular goal of eliminating Eurydice. In exchange, she wants protection.\nIt is clear that Saatet-ta does not seek defection. Her motives are no more pure, and\ncorruption still festers in her soul. Yet, she does not want to die, and her selfishness\nmakes her an unlikely ally. Before the leaders of the Amenti choose a reply,\nEurydice’s assassins strike again and Saatet-ta becomes the last of her kind. The\nchosen of Osiris no longer have a choice. Eurydice must not gain the last ifrit. She\nmust not complete her dread ritual. Horus himself issues the response to Saatet-ta\nand the distasteful order to the Shemsu-heru: Preserve the “Ebon Horror of Khutu”\nabove all else. The Amenti accept her deal.\nSaatet-ta arrives garbed in regal illusion, accompanied by a full bodyguard of\nreapers. The characters stand by as Horus receives her and gives his word on behalf\nof the Amenti as she demanded. The palpable distaste between the two does not end\nin violence, but only just. Horus leaves and entrusts Saatet-ta to the characters. As\nthey establish a hidden “safe house” in a remote location, the last of the Apepnu\nenjoys taunting her reluctant guardians.

A trio of stalkers\nmaterializes in Saatet-ta’s bedchambers, while the remaining three systematically\nand quietly eliminate all of the reapers and any mortal guards. The characters quickly\nturn the tide of battle, as the stalkers had not planned or prepared for Amenti\ninterference. Their momentary surprise gives Saatet-ta a chance to snare one in\nbindings of black lightning. A few more turns of combat follow, but the surviving\nstalkers retreat in a spray of sand. The captive stalker writhes and strains at its bonds,\nfutilely trying to dissipate through the ward. It soon runs out of Willpower and can\nonly snarl impotently.\nSaatet-ta boasts and brags, jeering at the caged beast — but she keeps a\nconspicuously healthy distance. It barks something incomprehensible at her, clearly\nan insult by the sudden pallor that spreads across her face. She turns her angry gaze\nfrom the beast and boasts that she can follow the stalker to its source and catch\nEurydice by surprise. She tries to bully the characters into accompanying her, but she\nresorts to cajoling and ultimately playing on their moral obligation if they refuse.\nWhenever and however they accept (and possibly even if they do not), she seizes an\namulet from beneath her clothes and throws it to the floor. It flashes a putrid green,\nand painfully tears the characters across space toward Eurydice’s lair.\nARMAGEDDON\nWhen the light and roaring winds fade, the dwar finds itself on the outskirts of\na small town. Characters with appropriate knowledge might recognize this place as\nMegiddo in Palestine, though if none are present to identify their surroundings,\nSaatet-ta makes note of it with surprise and scorn. Few people remain in the town,\nand many buildings have crumbled to ruin. If the characters theorize that this is the\nwork of Eurydice and her Amkhat, Saatet-ta corrects them, saying, “This is what\nmen do to their own kind. They bring ruin and pain upon themselves even in our\n— or her — absence. And it appears we have company.”\nAs Saatet-ta finishes her observation, armed Israeli soldiers emerge from a\nsearch of nearby rubble and notice the dwar. They approach with weapons drawn\nand demand that the characters present identification papers. They might even\nattack outright if the characters show visible weapons. The characters have less than\na minute to talk their way past the soldiers before Saatet-ta casts a lethal necromantic\nspell that burns the lot to stinking ash. The Bane Mummy does not apologize for her\naction but insistently leads the characters on into the rubble and mumbles, “We\ndon’t have time for this!”\nFollowing Saatet-ta, the dwar eventually locates and enters a damaged\nbuilding whose cracked foundation opens upon a descending staircase of ancient\ndesign. They can smell smoke wafting from below. At the bottom of the\nstaircase, the characters find a corridor opening into a wide stone platform. A\nvaulted cathedral ceiling looms far above, but the musty air and lingering scent\nof death betrays the place as a crypt of some kind. The interlopers’ attention\nimmediately draws to Eurydice herself, resplendent and hypnotically beautiful as\nshe stands unabashedly naked in the center of the platform.

She exchanges brief taunts with Saatet-ta then unleashes her\nstalkers with a casual wave. The pack comes snarling at the characters while Saatet-\nta unleashes an angry torrent of destructive magic at Eurydice. The Chosen of\nApophis casually swats the spell aside and begins draining Saatet-ta of her Corrup-\ntion. Try as they might, the characters cannot intervene due to the attacking\nmonsters (and even if the stalkers weren’t an issue, the dwar has no viable means of\npreventing Eurydice’s action at this time). When Eurydice finishes absorbing the\npower of Saatet-ta, she smiles horrifically and falls limp to the ground. The Amkhat\nbegin chanting a broken version of the Spell of Life that Saatet-ta recognizes in utter\nhorror before she, too, collapses at the edge of death.\nThe characters must finish off the stalkers so that they can attack the cultists\nand break their spell. From the first turn of chant, a shape begins taking form in the\nperfumed smoke. It begins as shapeless coils and then grows more distinct into a\nserpent of unthinkable proportions. Only a fraction of its sinuous bulk remains\nvisible in the eddying smoke at any given time, but the sight fills the characters with\ndread. The Storyteller should set a time limit in which to stop the ritual before it\nconcludes and the Great Serpent pours in a vortex to fill Eurydice with blasphemous\nlife. Suggested means of stopping the ritual include:\n• Kill the cultists. This is the simplest and most brutal method. If over a third\nof the cultists perish, the magic fails. Note that simply attempting to stop them from\nchanting will not be sufficient at this point. Their very bodies swarm with the unholy\npower of Apophis, and those conduits must be closed permanently for the magic to\nfail. This means that no fewer than 17 cultists must die if the Amenti are to prevail.\nThe good news is that the cultists are nothing special, physically. They have no\nmagic to protect themselves, so use the statistics for ordinary mortals.\n• Only sacrifice may break the ritual. At least one of the Amenti must leap\nupon Eurydice and take the searing evil of Apophis into himself.

The cultists shriek in horror, retreating\nto the handful of entry tunnels at the edge of the room. Eurydice remains alone,\ndenied her last chance at true life.

This scenario is perhaps the most subtle ending for a\nResurrection chronicle, at least insofar as the mundane world is concerned. For the\nUndying, it is just as much of an end as the setting sun.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn “Long Day’s Journey into Night”, Eurydice uses a different plan to achieve\nthe eternal life that she so desperately desires. Using an ancient spell fueled by her\nneed and the rage of the Ghost Storm, Eurydice tears down the Shroud between\nworlds, merging the Lands of the Living with those of the dead. Not only does this\nact allow restless ghosts to return to their lost flesh, it releases many others whose\nbodies are long since dust, seeking mortal hosts to inhabit. In a perverse imitation\nof the Amenti joining, these shades seize mortal hosts, and not necessarily in\ncooperation with their current inhabitants.\nEurydice’s actions gravely upset the balance of the world, threatening a future\nwhere the dead increasingly outnumber the living, or a world of unliving immortals\nwhere nothing ever changes because death has been rendered impotent. There is a\nmeans of stopping the deterioration of the Shroud and restoring the balance, but it\nis difficult and has a high price, assuming the characters are willing to pay it.\nDARK OMENS\nStorytellers can involve a dwar of characters in the events of “Long Day’s\nJourney into Night” in various ways, depending on the needs and style of the\nchronicle.

These ghosts seem to be gathering — called by some unseen source,\nfor reasons not even they can name. Sightings of ghostly phenomena are also\nbecoming more common. It seems that the Veil is thinning, allowing mortals to\nnotice the presence of spirits more in the Web of Faith. The stories are mere\ncuriosities at first, but as they become more common, they grow harder to dismiss.\nSIGNS\nThe Amenti see signs of imminent disaster more and more often. It is written\nin the stars for those with knowledge of the celestial arts. A strange red star appears\nover much of the Nile, casting a shadow wherein people see ghosts and spirits lurking\naround them. Urban graffiti looks like ancient Egyptian symbols. Images of jackals\nand other death trappings seem prominent.\nTHE JUDGMENT OF MA’AT\nFinally, Amenti traveling to Duat and meeting the Judges of Ma’at hear the\nwords of impending doom from their own lips, or from others in the depths of the\nUnderworld. Mummies who go to face the Judges of Ma’at for their advancement in\nBalance may hear them whisper prophecies of a great trial they will soon face, of the\nrestless dead walking among the living and the Shroud between worlds being torn\nasunder.\nPerhaps even more disconcerting to the Amenti is how the ever-silent Anubis,\nthe guide and guardian of the dead, seems saddened and regards them with a mixture\nof pity and sympathy upon meeting them in the depths of Duat. Mummies may hear\nvoices whispering in the winds of the Ghost Storm, perhaps saying the name\n“Eurydice” or repeating “soon, soon…” over and over again. Who do they speak of,\nand what are they waiting for?\nTHE TATTERED SHROUD\nEvents are set in motion when the wraith Eurydice uses a combination of her\nburning desire for life, ancient secrets wrested from the depths of the Underworld,\nand the blessings of Apophis to rend the fabric of the Shroud with the power of the\nDja-akh. This unleashes the forces of the Lands of the Dead on the Lands of the\nLiving, with disastrous consequences.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Throughout the\nLands of Faith, the Shroud rating drops by one at sunset. Amenti using their abilities\nmay notice that the Shroud offers them less resistance than normal. More impor-\ntantly, mortals in the Lands of Faith begin to sense the Lands of the Dead more\nclearly. There are reports of spiritual visitations, visions, strange dreams and so forth.\nThe Shroud has not weakened sufficiently for the two lands to touch, but in places\nwhere the Shroud rating drops as low as 1, cases of possession or more active\nhaunting, visions of a great and terrible storm or poltergeist phenomena are\ncommon.\nThe characters may look into the unusual things happening in the Lands of\nFaith, but they can find no reason for the increasing strength of the Dja-akh or the\nweakening of the Shroud. The strange happenings in places where the Shroud has\ngrown especially thin add to the other ill omens facing the Undying.\nTHE SHROUD FALLS\nThe following sunset, the Shroud rating drops by another point in the Lands\nof Faith and the Shroud rating worldwide also drops by one. In a few places (those\nwith an initial Shroud Rating of 2), the Shroud collapses altogether, leaving a\n“hole” between the Lands of the Living and Neter-khertet. The Shadowlands\nfall across the living world like a pall, and the two become as one. This has a\nnumber of dire effects:\n• The Veil: The Veil is still in effect in places where the Shroud has fallen,\nrevealing the true existence of the Shadowlands and the dead to mortals. Therefore,\nmany mortals (with less than three Willpower Traits) are utterly terror-stricken by\nthe appearance of the Shadowlands, causing panicked mobs and bouts of madness\nas humanity tries to block out the terrible truth. This leads to complete mayhem in\nplaces with a Shroud rating of 0, spreading outward as the Shroud grows weaker.\nThese conflicts, in turn, provide ample opportunities for the restless dead to possess\nliving bodies. As supernatural creatures themselves, mummies are unaffected by the\nVeil, but the madness and chaos surrounding the manifestation of the Shadowlands\nis certain to make their efforts more difficult.\n• The Restless Dead: In places where the Shroud has fallen, the ghosts and\nspirits of the dead that dwell in Neter-khertet are free to interact with the Lands of\nthe Living once more. Ghosts are still immaterial, but they can use their powers\nfreely without regard for the Shroud, and ordinary mortals can see them clearly,\nprovoking the effects of the Veil. Additionally, ghosts can attempt to possess living\nbodies or return to their own flesh to become risen.\nIf a ghost attempts to possess a living host body, make a Willpower\nChallenge for the ghost with a difficulty equal to the mortal’s Willpower. If the\nghost wins, it is in control of the body and the mortal loses a temporary\nWillpower Trait. If the mortal wins, the ghost cannot attempt to possess that\nperson for a day, and he loses a temporary Willpower Trait. Each day the ghost\npossesses a body, make a new Willpower test. If the ghost wins, the mortal loses\nanother temporary Willpower Trait. If the mortal wins, the ghost is ousted from\nthe host body. If a mortal host reaches zero Willpower Traits, the ghost takes\ncontrol of the body permanently.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The ghost gains physical abilities similar to a vampire (including\nthe ability to soak lethal damage with Stamina), but the ghost’s body is still a\ncorpse. The ghost is not really alive. The physical condition of the corpse affects\nthe ghost’s appearance and physical abilities. The recently dead are more\ncapable and lifelike than those whose bodies have been decomposing for days,\nweeks or even months.\n• Sekhem: Of greatest concern to the Amenti is the effect that the fallen\nShroud has on the presence of Sekhem in the Lands of the Living. On one hand, the\nAmenti lose the Gift of Ra in any place where the Shroud has been reduced to 0.\nThey do not automatically regain a Trait of Sekhem at sunrise each day. On the other\nhand, Osiris’ Blessing is enhanced. In places where the Shadowlands have emerged\nwithin the Web of Faith, mummies automatically regain their Balance score in\nSekhem every 24 hours. Outside the Web of Faith, the difficulties for regaining\nSekhem decrease by two Traits.\nThis means that Amenti in the areas where the Shroud has fallen feel\nempowered by the closeness of Osiris’ presence. They also feel a terrible sense of\nurgency. The weakening of the Shroud must be stopped, or life and death will be\nmixed beyond all undoing and life will cease to have any real meaning.\nThe Shroud loses a point of its rating each day at sunset, meaning that most\nplaces in the Web of Faith are completely exposed to the Shadowlands in less than\na week. The entire world will be engulfed by the Lands of the Dead in a little more\nthan a week’s time. At that point, it might be too late for the Undying to do anything\nexcept try and deal with the damage. Fortunately, the Reborn have an opportunity\nto address the problem before that happens.\nTHE NILE QUEEN\nThe ancient Shemsu-heru mummy Hatshepsut is aware of what is happening\nand why, and she has a means of doing something about it — with the aid of the dwar.\nHatshepsut gets in contact with the characters, either through conventional means\nsuch as telephone or telegram (if the characters are accessible in that way) or through\nmystical means like Hekau, such as a Nomenclature ritual to contact the characters\nby their names or a Necromancy ritual that allows Hatshepsut’s ka to visit the dwar\nin spirit form and summon them to her. Regardless of the means, Hatshepsut invokes\nher authority as one of the Shemsu-heru and an elder of the Undying, bidding the\ndwar to attend her in Cairo. She’s reluctant to discuss matters over great distance,\npreferring to do so in person when the dwar arrives.\nREACHING CAIRO\nThe difficulty of the dwar’s journey to Cairo to meet Hatshepsut is entirely up\nto the Storyteller, depending on the chronicle. If the dwar happens to be in Cairo,\nthen it may be as simple as a messenger delivering Hatshepsut’s summons and the\ncharacters going to meet her at her home. On the other hand, if the characters are\nin another country when the elder mummy’s message reaches them, then their trip\nto meet with her may be considerably more involved.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The first is the chaos\ncaused by the thinning of the Shroud, which has already begun by the time\nHatshepsut contacts the dwar. Depending on how far along things are, Cairo is likely\nin chaos, with the authorities doing their best to keep order. There are ghostly and\nspiritual visitations, as well as numerous cases of possession and encounters with the\nwalking dead as wraiths extend their reach into the Lands of the Living and mortals\nbecome increasingly aware of Neter-khertet. Travel in and out of Cairo (or Egypt,\nor the Middle East, for that matter) might become restricted, forcing the dwar to find\ndifferent routes. Of course, the longer the trip takes, the worse the situation becomes\nand the more urgent the dwar’s mission.\nThe second factor is Eurydice, herself. She is supernaturally aware of Hatshepsut’s\ndivinations into her plans and intends to do something about them. She dispatches\none or more of her stalkers, either to intercept the dwar and keep it from reaching\nHatshepsut or to attack both the characters and the Shemsu-heru at Hatshepsut’s\nhome in Cairo and prevent them from interfering in her plans.\nOther challenges may await the dwar along the journey to Cairo, from fierce\nsandstorms to fear-maddened terrorists or military patrols to sheer amounts of\nbureaucratic red tape. The actual trip can be a significant segment of the story or a\nsimple scene change as the characters go from wherever they are to Hatshepsut’s\nhome in Cairo.\nMEETING WITH THE PAST\nThrough one means or another, the dwar arrives in Cairo and makes its way to\nHatshepsut’s small but opulent home. The house is well protected from the chaos in\nthe city and surrounding area by various wards and amulets, allowing the dwar to\nmeet with the elder Shemsu-heru in relative peace, although it’s clear that matters\nare becoming more urgent. Attending her at all times are members of the Disciples\nof Anubis, her undead caretakers, who welcome the dwar graciously.\nHatshepsut dispenses with any formalities, welcoming the characters and\ntelling them what has happened. A powerful wraith initially chosen to be reborn as\nAmenti has been corrupted by Apophis, chosen as the Corrupter’s champion and\navatar. Using mystic secrets wrested from the depths of the Underworld, this wraith,\nEurydice, is tearing down the Shroud between the Lands of the Living and Neter-\nkhertet. This act is causing the Shadowlands to merge with the mundane world,\nloosing a flood of ghosts and restless spirits and exposing mortals to the Lands of the\nDead before their time. The effects of the Veil are causing chaos in the mortal world,\nand it will only get worse as time passes. In a matter of days, Eurydice will tear down\nthe Shroud altogether, the Lands of the Living and the Lands of the Dead will\nbecome as one, and Apophis will triumph.\nThere is hope, however. Hatshepsut and the other Shemsu-heru are aware of\na secret ritual, inscribed upon the wall of the Temple of Osiris in the lost city of\nAmenti in the depths of the Underworld. This powerful rite was always intended as\na last-ditch means of preventing Apophis’ victory and safeguarding the world, and\nit requires the power of the Reborn — those who have lived three lives — to use it.\n(Some might conclude that this is one of the reasons Osiris created the Amenti in\nthe first place. If someone points this out, Hatshepsut does not deny it.)\nTo use the ritual, the characters must prematurely abandon their khat to travel\ninto Duat and reach Amenti in time. In order to make the journey, they must die.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Hatshepsut can insist on a more involved ritual, if necessary.\nPerhaps the characters must first be wrapped up in treated bandages and placed in\nancient sarcophagi before they travel into Neter-khertet.\nAlternatively, Eurydice might inadvertently help the characters along their\njourney. The corrupt wraith’s stalkers might attack Hatshepsut’s home as the\nAmenti prepare to depart for the Lands of the Dead. The monstrous creatures slay\nthe mummies, including Hatshepsut, although she makes them pay dearly for her\nlife, using powerful Hekau to defend herself and the characters. The key difference\nis that one of the stalkers captures Hatshepsut’s soul. In fact, she might willingly\nsacrifice herself to allow the characters the opportunity to liberate their spirits and\ngo into the Shadowlands. This leaves the dwar on its own, with the characters aware\nof just how high the stakes are, if a millennia-old immortal is willing to sacrifice\nherself to give them their chance.\nJOURNEY TO THE WEST\nOnce the characters have entered Neter-khertet, they must travel to the Pillars\nof the West, the entrance to Duat, the Underworld. They travel through the\nShadowlands of Cairo, dealing with wandering ghosts and even noticing that some\nmortals are aware of them as they pass. (How many depends on how thin the Shroud\nhas become in the area.) It should be an unsettling experience for the Amenti,\nthough the spirits they encounter shouldn’t pose too much of a challenge for them.\nThe mummies make their way out past the pyramids and into the western\ndesert, which eventually leads deeper into Neter-khertet, away from the Lands of the\nLiving and toward the Underworld. In time, the characters see the Pillars of the West\nin the distance as they approach their destination.\nTHE PILLARS OF THE WEST\nThe Pillars of the West mark the border between Neter-khertet and Duat. The\ndwar must make its way through the caverns and tunnels between the Pillars to reach\nthe Underworld.\nNormally, the Judges of Ma’at pose various tests of a traveler’s worthiness. In\nthis case, however, the power of Apophis has grown great enough that the Corrupter\nuses the tests of the Pillars as obstacles in the Amenti’s path. The tests that the\ncharacters face should be manifestations of their deepest fears and desires, brought\nto terrifying life.\nStorytellers should tailor the different experiences and challenges to the\nindividual characters in the chronicle. The common themes should be what the\ncharacters have to lose and what they most fear. Apophis wants to encourage the\nAmenti to cling to life above all else, much like Eurydice, who values her own life\nabove that of every other living creature and is willing to sacrifice the whole world\nto Apophis in order to spare herself from death.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Friends and loved ones might plead with the Undying\nnot to leave them, and Apophis might offer tempting tastes of the many\npleasures life has to offer, coupled with the terrifying mystery of what lies beyond\nthe dark of Duat.\nANUBIS SPEAKS\nOnce the dwar makes its way through the Pillars of the West, it arrives in the\nvast desert of Duat, wracked by the terrible Dja-akh. The storm’s fury is greater than\nanything the characters have seen before, howling and shrieking, the winds filled\nwith moaning spirits. The power of the storm seems to be building, encouraged by\nEurydice and the power of Apophis until it is strong enough to tear apart the Shroud\nbetween the worlds. The characters should find themselves buffeted by the howling\nwinds and blowing sand, even in the relative shelter of the caverns.\nThen they see a faint light in the distance, through the blowing sand and clouds,\nand a dark figure appears. Anubis, the guide of the dead, strides through the storm,\ncarrying a glowing lantern suspended from the end of a long pole. The jackal-headed\ngod nods gravely to the characters, then speaks to them in a low voice that somehow\ncarries clearly over the howl of the storm around them.\n“Has the time come?” Anubis asks them.\nIf the characters answer in the affirmative, or otherwise tell Anubis why they\nhave traveled to Duat, he nods and asks. “Are you prepared?”\nIf the characters say yes, then the guide of the dead turns and leads them out into\nthe Dja-akh. If the characters answer in the negative to either question, or ask\nAnubis for clarification, the jackal-god silently turns and leads them out into the\nstorm, but does not speak to them again. He leads them to Amenti, but it is up to\nthem to decide to stop there, following Hatshepsut’s instructions, and to find the\nTemple of Osiris.\nAs long as the characters remain within the glow of Anubis’ lantern, they are\nprotected from the effects of the Ghost Storm and the wraiths and spectres within\nit. If you wish, you can subject the characters to another challenge by having one or\nmore spirits break through Anubis’ protection to attack the dwar. The jackal-god is\noccupied strengthening his sphere of influence and keeping out the fury of the storm,\nleaving the characters to deal with the rogue spirits on their own.\nTHE RITE OF THE SLAIN KING\nFinally, Anubis leads the Amenti to their namesake, the ruined city buried in\nthe dark sands of Duat, buffeted by the winds of the Dja-akh. If the characters told\nAnubis their mission, he leads them through the broken and buried streets of the city\nto its single intact structure. If not, he leads them past Amenti, and it’s up to the\ncharacters to choose to strike out on their own for the city and find the temple. If they\ncontinue on with Anubis, they encounter the Judges of Ma’at, who send them back\nto complete their mission before it’s too late.\nThe Temple of Osiris is a massive sandstone building supported by giant\ncolumns. Inside it is dark and eerily silent, unaffected by the storm raging\noutside. The centerpiece is a giant throne, now empty, and the walls are\ninscribed with Egyptian hieroglyphics.

If neither is an option, feel free to offer\nthe characters a moment of divine inspiration, the total memories of their First\nLives flooding back to them.\nTHE RITUAL\nThe Rite of the Slain King is easily the most powerful Hekau ritual the characters\nhave seen. In essence, the rite weaves a new and impenetrable Shroud, but it requires\nunique and perfected souls of beings like the Amenti as its raw material. The rite will\ntransform the souls of the Undying into a Shroud that will separate the two worlds\npermanently, but the Amenti will be no more. They will not die, precisely, but their\nessence will be forever bound into the Shroud. For the world to live, the immortals\nmust die.\nThe rite is designed so that only the Undying themselves can use it, but the\ncharacters must still decide to sacrifice not only themselves, but all of their kind in\norder for the ritual to work. Note that the rite does not require the permission of the\nother Amenti. Even one mummy can attempt it, and all the other Undying are\naffected by it, whether they wish to be or not.\nThe Rite of the Slain King is an extended ritual against a difficulty of 10\nTraits, using a Mental Challenge (retest Occult). A total of 10 successful tests are\nrequired, with one test per five minutes of play. Failure on any one of these tests\nrequires an additional Simple Test. If this test results in a loss, the rite is\nconsidered botched and all accumulated successful tests are lost, though it can\nbe restarted. There is no Sekhem cost, since the rite is empowered by the souls\nof the Reborn themselves. The dwar can cooperate in performing the rite or just\nsome of the characters can perform it, perhaps leaving the others to defend them,\nsince they will not complete the rite unopposed.\nDON’T LOOK BACK\nAfter the characters begin the ritual and have made their first successful test,\nEurydice enters the temple in her full and terrible glory as the Avatar of Apophis.\nShe glows with power, hovering in the midst of a swirling storm of black clouds,\nlightning flashing from her eyes and crackling over her skin. Her voice is like thunder\nthat shakes the pillars of the temple as she commands the Amenti to stop what they\nare doing. For this last confrontation with Eurydice, Storytellers have a couple of\noptions, depending on the sort of climatic scene they desire.\nFirst, one or more ghosts or stalkers may accompany Eurydice. She commands\nthem to attack the mummies, allowing a final battle where some of the characters\nfight to hold off Eurydice and her minions long enough for the others to complete\nthe rite. Regardless of their power and number, Eurydice should be powerful enough\nto pose a serious challenge to the dwar.\nAlternatively, the power of the rite might prevent Eurydice from directly\nattacking the dwar once it has begun. All she can hope to do is convince the\ncharacters to stop what they are doing of their own free will before the ritual is\ncomplete. She uses threats, logic, persuasion, seduction and any other means\navailable to her to convince the Amenti.

As long as the dwar remains steadfast, the\nCorrupter’s avatar is powerless to stop them.\nCLOSING THE SHROUD\nWhen the Rite of the Slain King is complete, the souls of all Reborn, everywhere\nin the world, are drawn from their khat and merged into a newer and more powerful\nShroud that rises up between the world of the living and the Lands of the Dead.\nEurydice screams in terror and rage as the Shroud separates the two worlds forever,\ndrawing all the spirits of the dead back into the Shadowlands and preventing any of\nthem from ever returning. The dead will remain dead, and never reach the Lands of\nthe Living again.\nOf course, the Amenti are only dimly aware of this as their consciousness\nmerges in a single transcendent moment. They are aware of the presence of\nOsiris himself, a part of the foundation of the ritual, sacrificed once more for the\ncause of his people; of the eldest Shemsu-heru (including Horus); even of Ma’at,\nherself, lending her power to this most noble and balanced of acts.

She is empowered by Apophis and her own khaibit to tear down the\nShroud between the worlds, to merge the Lands of the Living and the Lands of the\nDead into one. Only then will she attain the resurrection that she seeks, and she will\nreign over the two worlds in the name of the Corrupter.\nEurydice is every bit as powerful as the players have feared, except that she is\nnot embodied in this scenario and exists as a wraith in Duat, albeit one with the\npower of Apophis at her command. Eurydice is completely and utterly mad. She\ncares nothing for anyone or anything, and she will gladly sacrifice the whole world\nto Apophis if that is what it takes to regain her grip on life.\nHATSHEPSUT\nHatshepsut understands well the meaning of sacrifice. She is one of the\nShemsu-heru, the original mummies created by the Spell of Life, an ally of Horus\nhimself. More importantly, the Nile Queen served as one of the greatest\nchampions against the machinations of Apophis, although few actually know it.\nHatshepsut was the subject of a mighty enchantment known as the Rite of the Sun\nKing, which made her a barrier in the Shadowlands against Apophis’ full power\nmanifesting in the Lands of the Living. The barrier was designed to keep the\nCorrupter at bay so that he was forced to operate through his various agents.\nHatshepsut was aided and supported by the Disciples of Anubis, a secret society\nprivy to the rite and her duties.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

She cannot prevent the tragedy, so she focuses on\nseeing how much can be rescued from the ruins. She appears only at the end of the\nstory, to answer lingering questions and pass on what hope she can for the future.\nGoing through the story itself, the characters should not know that someone with\nher power watches and hopes for them. The Lady of Fate provides succor and\nemergency assistance if the characters have truly fought their hardest yet still find\nthemselves faced with failure, but she does not do other wraiths’ work for them.\nYu Huang and the Smiling Lord\nThe Emperor of the Yellow Springs spent decades preparing for the invasion he\nlaunches now. His advisors recognized an opportunity in the era of the Great War and\ninsinuated highly trained agents among the prisoners harvested by Stygian Reapers\nworking in eastern Russia. They’ve sent in more from time to time ever since. Yu Huang\nalso enjoys the advantage of covert assistance from the Smiling Lord. Each believes he\ncan use the other. Yu Huang expects to let the Smiling Lord weaken Stygian defenses\nenough that Jade troops can sweep away all resistance, then remove the Smiling Lord\nhimself at his leisure. The Smiling Lord believes that he can use Jade forces to crush all\ncompetition and then drive back the invaders through superior strategy and firepower\n(to wit, the relic nuclear devices he’s been harvesting for decades).\nTHE LAST DANCE MACABRE\nCharon’s empire is under assault from all directions, beset by foes without and\ntraitors within. In desperation, the most powerful defenders of the empire set in\nmotion plans laid down in prophecy and developed centuries ago, to recover the soul\nGETTING EVERYONE ONBOARD\nAt first it might seem daunting to try to figure out ways to get the troupe’s\ncharacters to go through with some of the tasks this scenario requires of them together,\nbut it isn’t necessarily as difficult as it appears. Few relationships in the Underworld\nare as tidy as “firm friends or allies with no complicating factors” or “implacable\nenemies.” Whatever official declarations say, wraiths of varying allegiances must learn\nto cooperate with the wraiths they come into regular contact with. Hierarch, Heretic\nand Renegade might all share a favored leisure spot, have Fetters attached to the same\ngeneral location or have a mutual interest in some constructive task. Wraiths on\nopposite sides of a political fence might share an enemy or a Passion.\nWhat’s more, given the overwhelming importance of the tasks they are\npresented with during this scenario, getting the characters to work together through-\nout the story shouldn’t be as difficult as some other scenarios. Even the most selfish or\nstandoffish character can’t help but see the value of staving off the forces of Oblivion,\nif only to claim some reward or save his own hide. Still, when mixing characters of\ndiverse allegiances, be sure to provide points of contact that are strong enough to keep\nthe characters together in the depths of the crisis. Characters need not be profound\nconfidants, but neither should they carry serious hostility toward each other, especially\nnear the end. There are enough wraiths out there who want to tear the various Circles\nasunder already without giving them more help from the inside.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

They move from\nNecropolis battlefield to the heart of Stygia itself, and have a voice in the last council\nof the Stygian Empire.\n“The Last Danse Macabre” is a story of hope in the midst of tragedy. The institutions\nbuilt up over millennia to unite and govern the Restless Dead fail. As things fall apart,\nhowever, the characters move into position to pick up the pieces, or perhaps to build\nsomething new. The Underworld does not come to an end in this story, and its future form\ndepends greatly on what the characters do now. One era might be coming to an end, but\nthe next one is just beginning, with the characters at its epicenter.\nPART ONE: ENVIOUS GAZES\nThe first chapter begins with war. Yu Huang’s long-planned invasion of the\nDark Kingdom of Iron erupts, exploiting two advantages: the extent to which\nStygian military forces are committed to the destruction of the recently discovered\nblack city of vampires, and the Smiling Lord’s subtle treachery. The finest soldiers\nof the Dark Kingdom of Jade pour through artificial Byways, bypassing all the usual\nStygian defenses. The characters take part in the desperate battle for control of the\nNecropolis: the surprise of the attack, rallying for defense, engagements along the\nbeachhead perimeter and chases and clashes throughout the city.\nIn this first installment, the characters first face the basic challenges of mere\nsurvival, primarily those involved in getting away from shock troops (and complica-\ntions like exploding Artifact vehicles). Storytellers should pull out all the stops to\ncreate the impression of the sudden fear and confusion of the invasion. Dim the lights\nto simulate candlelight or “emergency power.” Play recorded sound effects of bombs\nand gunfire to create raging battles in the distance. Give the players all manner of\nfrantic reports from friends and allies around town. Narrator characters playing\ninvading Jade soldiers or local militia forces should naturally make frequent appear-\nances in one form or another, and characters should feel that there is little time to do\nanything other than escape the brunt of the invasion long enough to fight back.\nThen they join the ranks of Iron Kingdom wraiths taking the battle back to the\ninvaders. The key for the Storyteller here is to ensure all the characters’ utility during\nthe invasion. Physically fearsome wraiths are naturally able to find much to do, but\nsneakier types can also find places to hide or perform sabotage missions, while\nintellectual characters can plan strategy or research the weaknesses of the enemy.\nMore socially inclined characters can serve as leaders and firebrands to keep the\ntroops motivated. Weaving several subplots geared toward each type of character\naround the main arc of the invasion is generally the best way to make sure that\neveryone has a role to fulfill in the city’s common defense.\nRegardless of how they respond, this episode should ultimately conclude with\nthe wraiths helping repulse the invasion and securing the liberty of at least part of\nthe city to stage the next phase of their response — unless the characters seriously\nbotch their efforts.\nPART TWO: INTO THE DEPTHS\nJust as the characters have a chance to get their bearings again, the unexpected\ninterrupts their plans to push the invaders further back from their perimeters. A\nhigh-ranking Oracle arrives from Stygia with a fresh mission for the characters.

Knowing he was fated to perish in battle with Gorool, Charon long\nago entrusted his memories to the Mnemoi, who then disappeared under the guise\nof the empire’s greatest enemies and scattered to keep his memories from being kept\nin one place. After Charon’s fall, he was eventually reborn as an unassuming\ninvestment banker named Charles Anderson. Desperate times call for his early\nreturn, however, and the characters or the Oracle must fulfill Fate’s decrees by killing\nCharon, Reaping him and escorting him safely to Stygia to be reunited with his\nmemories, which have been kept safe for him by a most unlikely agent.\nOnce Charon has died a second time, the characters and their Oracle guide set\nout for Stygia, dealing with complications along the way. The battlefields across the\nNecropolis present risks from ambush to accidents amid the rubble, and once the\ncharacters descend into the Tempest, they face the turbulence and local storms\ncreated by the Jade invasion. Through all of this, they also have to deal with Charon,\nignorant of his role or indeed of anything else about the Underworld.\nWithin the upper reaches of the Tempest, the characters rescue a lone wraith\nfrom Shadow-eaten assassins only to find themselves the recipients of an unexpected\ngift. The wraith they rescue is a gentle, ancient wraith named Niska, one of the\nMnemoi, who transfers her share of Charon’s memories to the characters before\nsuccumbing to her terrible wounds. The characters then have the option of spending\na long subjective moment exploring some of Charon’s past before proceeding.\n(Flashbacks intermittently intrude throughout the rest of the scenario.)\nSpecific images for these memories are provided in Ends of Empire, pages 53-\n55. Storytellers without this resource should provide glimpses of scenes from the\ndistant past such as the founding of Stygia, an early conversation with the Lady of\nFate or similarly mysterious but powerful moments in Charon’s life.\nAt last, the Midnight Express arrives to provide the characters with some\nassistance. The characters get some much-needed rest and recuperation and get to\nspend a little time visiting with the train’s denizens. Elsewhere in the Tempest, the\nbattle against Enoch comes to its climax with the use of one of the Smiling Lord’s\nPERSONALITIES OF PART TWO\nStorytellers will note that no Traits are given for any of these characters.\nThis is deliberate, as their Traits should be whatever the Storyteller feels it is\nappropriate for them to have in her chronicle. This is not to say that they should\nbe mighty gods that outshine the players’ characters at everything, merely that\nthey should possess what the story requires them to have — no more, no less.\nThe Oracle — As written, the Oracle who arrives is John Davis, a dapper\nand charismatic 19th-century Southern gentleman and gambler. For the purposes\nof Oblivion, however, it is entirely appropriate to substitute a more familiar face\nif an Oracle or other servant of Fate has an established presence in the chronicle.\nRegardless of his identity, the Oracle should serve only as a guide, reluctant to\nintervene more directly lest his actions tangle the skein and alter the future.\nCharles Anderson — Charon’s mortal incarnation has no idea of his real\nidentity or his place in existence. He’s polite and unassuming, a heavy smoker in bad\nhealth with a quiet love of hymns and lullabies. As a wraith, he is unremarkable\nexcept for the fact that he has no Shadow whatsoever. Due to this internal cohesion,\nall attempts to manipulate him or control him incur a two-Trait penalty.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The Midnight Express is derailed, and tension mounts as the characters\nand their companions must begin the very dangerous passage from the Midnight\nExpress to Stygia, dogged by rising numbers of Spectres and nightmarish Maelstrom\nwinds. Fortunately, just as things look their worst, the Skeletal Lord and his forces\nemerge from the darkness. Together the two groups fight their way to safety.\nOnce they are within the multiple layers of Stygian defense, the characters take\npart in the final council of the Deathlords. Needless to say, this should be a powerful\nroleplaying experience for all involved. It is highly recommended that a number of\nNarrator characters in full costume be enlisted to do justice to the various Deathlords\npresent. Business turns to restoring Charon after a brief discussion of the invasion,\nbut first the Lady of Fate announces that they must expose the traitor in their midst,\nthe one who sold out the empire to the Yellow Springs and opened the path for\ninvasion. The Smiling Lord’s treachery is exposed, and the characters have a chance\nto help catch the fleeing Deathlord and bring him to justice. Sentence is either\nimmediate destruction or being turned over to Lord Nhudri. It’s anyone’s guess\nwhich is really worse.\nOnce justice has been served, the task returns to aiding the Mnemoi in\nrebuilding Charon’s memories. This should be an imaginative and enigmatic scene,\ninvolving the characters and the Mnemoi attempting to take fractured pieces of\nfleeting moments and powerful memories and forge them into a whole again.\nStorytellers might wish to require a number of Mental Challenges with the Enigmas\nAbility to help, or even just ask the players to put together a real jigsaw puzzle or solve\nsome other real conundrum to represent the difficulty of the task. Colored lighting,\nA PERFECT CIRCLE\nIt can be all too easy to read each instance of “the characters” as referring to\na single specific Circle in the troupe becoming the sole “heroes” of this scenario,\nparticularly during the second and fourth parts. Don’t let this happen. While many\n“scripted” events must occur to move the story forward as described, nothing says\nonly one particular Circle can be the one to do it all. In Part Two, for instance, one\nCircle might be made responsible for the grim yet vital task of killing Charles\nAnderson and helping him adjust to the afterlife, while another might be the\ngroup that finds Niska and receives some of Charon’s memories. In Part Four, the\nmost combat-oriented wraiths might band together to take down Coldheart,\nwhile a more socially adept group could find itself talking down important allies\nfrom Catharsis. Simply make sure that each Circle’s work keeps it cooperating and\nultimately leads back to the main story. Look at the players and what their Circles\nenjoy, and make sure there’s plenty of important work for all characters and Circles\nto do as the story builds.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Quite simply, too many Mnemoi have been\ndestroyed, too many of Charon’s memories lost over time to fully rebuild the memory\npalace. Therefore, the episode ends with Charon, though restored to his old\npersonality and some semblance of his previous grandeur, sadly announcing that he\ncan no longer be the leader he once was.\nPART FOUR: THE END OF ALL THINGS\nThe scenario’s final chapter opens not too long after, with Stygia coming under\nattack from within as well as without. As the Great Maelstrom lashes Stygia, the\nthousands of Spectres captured by Martyr Knights and stored in the city’s catacombs\nburst loose. Adding more misery to this total, the Pardoners’ vast container of Angst\nexplodes, drenching many hapless wraiths with purified liquid Angst and sending\nthose so exposed into instant Catharsis. While the Spectral assault from the Tempest\nescalates, the city’s wraiths fight against unexpected enemies and their own\ncomrades fallen to Oblivion. Charon and the Deathlords ride into a battle that ebbs\nand flows across the breadth of the city.\nThe battle brings in all the forces opposed to Oblivion, including the Ferrymen,\nreturning to the city for the first time since they turned their backs on Charon. Victory\ndoes not come easily — some of the empire’s most powerful wraiths sacrifice\nthemselves to buy time for others. If there was ever a time during this scenario to not\nhold back with staging and atmosphere, this is it. Storytellers should do all they can\nPERSONALITIES OF PART FOUR\nColdheart — The general of the Labyrinth, this ancient Nephwrack has\nlong dreamt of the day he would finally tear Stygia apart and rend its society\nasunder. Surrounded by an elite force of Doppelgangers and Mortwights and\nmaster of countless forms of magic and killing, he is a nightmarish foe on the\nbattlefield, easily a worthy adversary for two or even three Circles of powerful\nwraiths. Stepping forward to battle Coldheart should be the most terrifying\nexperience a wraith will ever have, as his power and fury at being challenged will\nbe almost beyond their imagining. Defeating him routs the armies of Oblivion in\none stroke, however, not to mention making for a stirring and intense scene.\nThe Mourners — These bizarre and terrifying creatures appear as a mob of\nwailing, grieving wraiths clad in simple mourning clothes. Though they never\nappear to hurry, they inexorably gain ground on a character who catches their\nattention, and they cannot be slain — only driven off with powerful Arcanoi or\nartifacts. Most terrifying of all, any wraith who touches one of them or attempts\nto read their thoughts contracts Mournerism and transforms into one of the mob\nin mere moments. Absolutely no power or skill can prevent this transformation.\n(It is generally best to have the players witness one or two Narrator characters\nsuffer this fate in order to avoid losing characters to such simple contact during\nan initial encounter with the Mourners.)

When the Spectral hordes\nat last retreat, however, the Isle of Sorrows has been so badly battered that it cannot be\nrestored. After the fighting ends, Charon’s final acts as emperor before his Transcen-\ndence in a glowing column of light include opening the way for his heirs (namely the\ncharacters) to find a new home and found a new society for the Underworld.\nThe scenario ends with the prospect of rebuilding. The characters and the other\nwraiths face a future in which the old powers are gone forever. Now it’s time to rebuild\nand prepare for the immediate challenges — the continuing devastation wrought by\nSixth Great Maelstrom foremost among them — and for the long-term futures. They\ncan choose to take their fellow survivors and begin building a new social order (perhaps\ntaking over where one of the previous groups left off), or they may choose to lead an\nexodus in search of a new “homeland” in the Underworld, where they may seek their\nfinal destiny. Perhaps they will even do both, with some remaining behind to forge a\nnew order while others explore the far ranges of the undiscovered country. What\nhappens from there is entirely up to the players to determine (if they wish to continue\nat all).

What follows is a brief discussion of\ntwo other possible endings Storytellers might want to explore.\nSTORM-TOSSED REFUGEES\nNot all wraiths caught in the Sixth Great Maelstrom are instantly sent into\nDestruction Harrowings. Some exceptionally lucky or determined wraiths find\nthemselves inexplicably returned to the lands of the living, as though the storm had\nliterally blown them back into the physical world once more. Unlike normal Risen,\nhowever, these creatures do not require a Conduit for their Shadow to inhabit. Both\nPsyche and Shadow remain in the body together, bound together as they always have\nbeen. No longer do Fetters bind them or Passions rule their every thought (though\nboth remain extremely important in any event). Such wraiths are closer to their pre-\ndeath mental state than ever.\nThis is not to say that the process is without drawbacks, however. To begin with,\nit is not something that can be done intentionally, not unless the wraith is suicidal\nenough to risk the storm in the hopes it will carry him back to the living instead of\njust to his own destruction. Furthermore, not all wraiths find themselves back in\ntheir own bodies. While some reconstitute centuries-old corpses to inhabit (even\nmake them reasonably lifelike), others find themselves trapped in rotting shells or\neven the body of another departed soul. Either can have dire consequences on the\nsanity of the Psyche, not to mention feeding the Shadow great amounts of Angst\nfrom the miserable conditions and lingering separation from true living that the\nPsyche must endure daily. Lastly, the agony of the crossing and condition of the body\nrenders many of these unfortunate wraiths little more than animalistic zombies,\nexisting only to prey on the living.\nHaving the troupe’s characters caught up in the storm and unexpectedly blown\nback into the living world as a group can make for an extremely fascinating and\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

(Perhaps the communal Haunt finally gives way\nunder the pounding of the storm after a tense session of waiting and fearing the worst,\nonly to deliver the characters to this unexpected fate instead of the Labyrinth.)\nFormer enemies might potentially turn to each other for comfort in the face of the\npain and isolation they feel as undead walking among the living — or take the\nopportunity to settle some scores with each other and the Skinlands in ways they\nnever could dream of across the Shroud. The characters might even attempt to break\noff and form their own “community of the dead” away from the eyes of the living,\nwhich has its own fantastic possibilities.\nIn terms of game mechanics, such characters are subject to the normal creation\nor conversion rules as ordinary Risen, with the following exceptions. First, they do\nnot require a Conduit, nor are subject to any rules or conditions relating to one. They\ngain Angst, experience Catharsis and suffer from the predations of their Shadows\njust like ordinary wraiths. Second, while they do not require the normal minimum\nlevels of certain Arcanoi to “rise” (since the storm does it for them), the same\nArcanoi remain impossible to utilize in the living world. They do have the same\npotential to develop a small number of vampiric Disciplines to simulate their\nenhanced physical prowess, though.\nLast but not least, such restless dead often find themselves dealing with the imbued\nhunters of Laws of the Reckoning at one time or another. The circumstances that\ncreated the imbued and drove the wraiths back to their bodies appear to be mysteriously\nlinked, somehow. Of course, whether contact means a bloody battle or a tender\nexamination of life and the nature of letting go depends entirely on the attitudes of\nindividual imbued encountered, as determined by the Storyteller. Exploring the appar-\nent connection between the wraiths of Oblivion and the imbued of, however, Reckoning\ncan make for a fascinating series of stories as both sides try to figure out what must be done\nabout the peril they find themselves in during the End Times.\nDON’T LOOK BACK\nSome inquisitive and creative Oblivion Storytellers have doubtless looked into\nthe material found in the Orpheus limited series as a possible direction to take their\ngames. Naturally, Storytellers who wish to take this road are naturally free to do so\nif they desire, but they should weigh a few facts before proceeding.\nMost importantly, while it certainly has similarities, Orpheus was not designed\nfor compatibility with either Wraith or Mind’s Eye Theatre. It is a game in full, with\nits own rules, flavor, history and setting material that requires a great deal of\nexamination and testing if the Storyteller wishes to make full use of what it has to\noffer, without making both games unplayable in the process. In addition, its story arc\nhas already been determined, meaning that unless they intend to switch their\ncontinuity to match that of Orpheus, Storytellers should expect to do additional\nwork to mesh the disparate elements of these two games without losing what\ninterested them in the first place.\nWith that in mind, if both players and Storytellers still desire to investigate a\ntransition from the hope, horror and tragedy of Oblivion to the mystery, danger and\nintrigue of Orpheus, then of course the choice is theirs to make.

It’s not easy. Life doesn’t come packaged in neat, easily\ndigestible pieces you can slot in when they’re convenient. Neither do most roleplaying\nchronicles, despite the best designs of the Storyteller. Having said that, let us hasten\nto add that this is exactly what this book is all about: helping Storytellers bring their\nchronicles to a smashing close. Hopefully this end will provoke, entertain, sadden and\nsatisfy all the Storytellers and players who have dedicated themselves to and immersed\nthemselves in this engaging and complex chronicle world.\nFine. But exactly how do you go about doing that? Few Storytellers and even\nfewer players have ever participated in a chronicle that came to an end on purpose.\nWe’ve all seen chronicles die out as players move away or need to put a game on hold\nto accommodate real-life concerns. Some of these games end abruptly, without any\nreal resolution. Others simply never get underway again. But this time how you make\nthe exit is in your own hands.\nTo do so, Storytellers need do no more than consider all those elements they’ve\nconsidered when building the chronicle. So, no big surprises! Just do what you’ve\nbeen doing all along but with an eye toward tying up the loose ends. Such elements\nas plot, scope, scale, direction and pacing should be old hat by now, and they can\neven be used to cover up your true intent so the players don’t even realize that the\nchronicle is ending until it slaps them in the face. Though bringing existing\nchronicles to an end receives most of the emphasis of this chapter, there’s no reason\na Storyteller can’t begin a chronicle with an eye toward the ultimate end. Whichever\nyou’re doing, the following considerations are the nuts and bolts you can use to build\nan End-Times chronicle from scratch or incorporate it into an existing chronicle. By\nconsidering all these elements as well as the preferences of your players, you can judge\nwhich end best fits your chronicle, build the framework to bring that story into being\nand prep your players so they’re ready and eager to undertake an End-Time story.\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

So you’re probably asking, “Now\nwhat?” How can you create a plot that’s so far reaching it ends the entire world while\ntying up loose ends you’ve left hanging throughout your chronicle? Doing so, how\ncan you make your players not only accept the world’s demise but enjoy it? It ain’t\neasy, but it can indeed be worth it.\nSource materials have been hinting and threatening and almost, but not quite,\ngetting to “The End” for some time now. Your players have probably become inured\nto the “Oh no, it’s the end of the world” scenario long since, so how do you awaken\nthem from their it’s-just-another-save-the-world-scenario ennui and ready them for\na true end to it all?\nUse a bit of shock factor. The easiest way to invoke shock, fear and trepidation\nis to kill lots and lots of characters. Preferably all those Narrator characters the\ncharacters have grown attached to and accustomed to having around. Go after\nwards, kinfolk, lovers, teachers, superiors, apprentices, little brothers, parents,\nfriends, co-workers, the guy that runs the news kiosk and the girl who serves\ncappuccino. Don’t kill characters just for the sake of being mean or showing that\nyou’re serious, but don’t be afraid to be ruthless either. The players will get the\nmessage pretty quickly that things are taking a turn for the worse.\nOf course, if this seems a little too radical for you, there are other options. You\ncan slowly increase the tension by steadily piling one disaster on top of another until\nthe characters can’t see any way out. Doing so gives them more time to notice subtler\nclues and to attempt more fixes to take care of the problem. Most players will go on\nfocusing their characters’ actions on alleviating the symptoms as long as you never\nquite make it clear that the actual disease is not only inevitable, but looming right\noverhead. The other type of plot focuses more on quick, often disjointed seeming\nscenarios, all of which lead to an inescapable conclusion — the world is doomed. You\ncan, of course, combine these two methods.\nWhichever method you choose, you must incorporate elements into this final\nplot that truly mean something to the characters and tie up many of the loose ends\nyou’ve left hanging. Just another raid on the corporate criminals who are to blame\nfor the awful state of the world won’t mean anything to your players unless the\ncompany soldiers murdered their families. If their sisters are married to the CEO and\nthe poisons the bad guys are emitting from their factories are corrupting the\ncharacters’ closest allies, you have something worth their time. The plot must make\nsense in the context of the stories you’ve told in the past and must lead to the\ninevitable, no matter how slowly. Keep the plotting tight, and make every session\naim a little more pointedly toward the finale. Some troupes prefer to know\nbeforehand that this will lead to the end. If you think your players would want that,\nby all means, let them in on things and even ask for issues they’d like to see covered\nor stories they’d like to be told before the demise of the chronicle.\nOne major point: Be aware that not all players will want to end the chronicle\nand may attempt to turn aside or subvert the story. Some may flatly refuse to play if\nyou’re going to kill their characters or conclude the game. Don’t let players derail the\nstory because they’re afraid of losing their characters or because they are reluctant\nto face the sorts of issues an End-Times chronicle inevitably raises. If you cave in to\npressure, you won’t be happy that you have no control over your own game — and\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Stick with the plan and eventually they will see the\nincredible roleplaying potential in the End-Times game.\nJust make certain that you’ve chosen an end that fits your strengths as a\nStoryteller as well as your players’ talents. If you’ve spent two years running a\nhighly charged mega-action game, they won’t enjoy a sudden switch to subtle\npolitical maneuvering where their characters’ best kung fu moves mean nothing.\nEven if they go down fighting, they should feel that it was worth every drop of blood\nspent.

After all, so much is happening, and on such a grand scale, that it\nis very easy to focus on what happens next rather than let smaller moments of\nsatisfaction linger. Remember, though, that roleplaying is a group effort — especially\nlive-action roleplaying — and the real issue is not the catastrophe at hand, but the\ncharacters’ experience of it. If you’ve taken steps to make sure that all of the\ncharacters can be involved with the action, you’re well on your way to ensuring a\nsuccessful chronicle. You can do a few more things, however, to make sure that your\nplayers feel they are essential parts of this story.\nWith an epic tale come equally dramatic moments. Each character should have\na chance to shine, even if only the player recognizes it for what it is at the time. Perhaps\nshe has an unusual ability that is essential to the success of a mission. Perhaps she has\nthe opportunity to finally reconcile with a long-lost love after years spent apart. Or the\ncharacters might find themselves, at the end, sacrificing themselves for the greater\ngood (or ill). Your players’ characters are the heroes and anti-heroes of the story, and\nthey deserve that opportunity. Just remember not to blatantly telegraph these\nmoments. If the other players are saying things like, “Oh, so I guess this is Rick’s special\nmoment now, let’s all stand aside and wait our turn,” something is very wrong.\nTry to incorporate as many personal stories into the End-Times game as\npossible. There’s nothing more frustrating for players than to feel like their charac-\nters just happen to be handy cardboard cutouts the Storyteller can run through their\npaces. If Baron September’s greatest fear is to be separated from his true love, off to\nthe tower she goes. If Defends-the-Peace dreams of rallying the disparate packs of his\nsept against the Wyrm in the final hours of the world, let him have a chance to make\nthe speech that will bring them all together at last. Even if it’s something as simple\nas allowing Tony a chance to tell Rae how much he loves her, give him the moment\nto do so, if only with his dying breath. Personalizing the game, especially the End-\nTime story, is the only real way to make this the best story possible.\nThe only unbreakable guideline is to never ruin a player’s moment. Although\nyou’re understandably excited to find out what happens when he discovers that the\nGarou Nation will sing of his glorious day until the end of time, that’s no excuse to\nrush his dramatic death scene. This rule goes for the other players, too. If another\nplayer decides to ask you about a ruling just as the eshu has gotten on his knees to\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Throw them for a loop. Take part of one scenario and fuse it with an element\nof another (maybe even from a different game), throw some of your own original\nideas into the mix and voila!

In fact, that could well be the\nbest solution to tying up a number of loose ends, especially if your chronicle has\ngrown as truly… eclectic as many older ones do over time.\nIt will probably be a tad more effective, however, to limit the scope of the game\na little. While things are happening all over the world and affecting all supernatural\nbeings, there’s no point in dragging in elements that have not been an integral part\nof the chronicle all along to confound the characters at the last minute. It confuses\nthe issue and diffuses the players’ energies.\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t use needed story elements, just make certain they\nactually relate to the characters and the situation they’re in.

Will she\ndo what she can to mitigate the situation (thereby rediscovering the humanity she\nthought she’d lost) and try to salvage something for others even as she is destroyed?\nTo fully involve the players, you might need to limit the scope of the game to\nthe personal telling against a wider background. The world may be going to hell in\na hand basket, but the characters need to be grounded in what they care about to truly\nfeel their essential part in things. Then again, showing some of the wider ramifica-\ntions and events happening elsewhere will bring home the gravity of the situation.\nThat’s where scale comes in.\nSCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nMost Storytellers hope to tell a grand, sweeping story, a great chronicle\nthat encompasses myriad story lines and might take years to complete — if it\nis ever finished. Even such epic stories pale in comparison to the End-Times\nchronicle, however.\nIn even the smallest, most local story, you’ve always got to consider the breadth\nof the drama. How local is it? Does what happens in one place affect what happens\nelsewhere? What about events from outside the area covered in a chronicle? Do\nevents that happen somewhere else in the world impinge upon the local game?\nENDING\nNDING\nNDING\nNDING\nNDING E E E E EVERY\nVERY\nVERY\nVERY\nVERY S S S S STORY\nTORY\nTORY\nTORY\nTORY\nWith a chronicle’s end comes the end of all the individual stories of the\ncharacters. Storytellers should not neglect the small, personal stories that form\nthe various subplots and defining moments surrounding the players’ characters\n— the son estranged from his mother, the businessman whose company was\ntaken over by demonic thralls, the former junkie trying to rescue his lover from\na blood cult.\nThese stories can easily be swept aside and forgotten in the chaos of the\nfinal days, but that would be a shame. Now more than ever, these “little” events\nare important to characters. These personal matters are last chances for\nrevenge, forgiveness or simply closure before everything burns away.\nStorytellers should look for opportunities to include characters’ personal\nstories, plot hooks and unresolved issues in the finale of the chronicle. These\nstories don’t have to end happily or cleanly. There are bound to be tragic,\nterrible conclusions to some — say, a lover killed by a rival out of spite. Others\nmay end well, even in the chaos and horror of the last of days. A distant child\nmight forgive his mother in the face of Armageddon. If the characters are to\nface the threat of eternal night and march toward an uncertain tomorrow, it’s\nbest if lingering matters are resolved so they don’t hold anyone back.

All of this has to do with the scale\nof the game.\nIn other words, when the World of Darkness comes to an end, your players’\ncharacters — no matter how insular — will be part of it whether they engage\nonly in local matters or trot all over the world interacting with characters from\nexotic and far-flung locales. Individual Storytellers will have to decide whether\nto make their games global in nature or confine them to those events that have\nthe most meaning for their players’ characters. This will be especially impor-\ntant to games that involve players from several home chronicles who travel to\nother areas to play.\nWhile it is best to limit the scale of the game to the immediate locale, brining\nin elements from foreign climes — even just as rumors of events — will strengthen\nthe overall story the characters are experiencing. In essence, the characters play out\ntheir drama against a far more massive backdrop than their local theatre can\nencompass. That grand scale doesn’t have to impinge directly on the neighborhood,\nbut the characters should be aware that they are only a part of a vast undertaking.\nGiving them that sense of scale should make clear how serious these events are, and\nit might bring out some of the helplessness many people feel in the face of disasters\nthey can’t avert. Nonetheless, the characters should always be made to feel that no\nmatter how small their part seems, it is still vital and might just turn the tide in the\nend. “Think globally, act locally” is a major cliché nowadays, but it pretty accurately\nsums up what the scale of the game should strive to be.\nDIRECTION\nIRECTION\nIRECTION\nIRECTION\nIRECTION\nMore than with any other chronicle, the last chronicle needs to have a specific\ndirection, starting from an identifiable beginning, through the meat of the chronicle\nand building toward the finale. Too many side issues will ruin the flavor of the story\nbeing told, so unless something is of major importance to the characters, it’s best to\nleave it out. Naturally, some characters might feel that their political aspirations or\ntheir magical ranking are the story. But seriously, what does politicking matter when\nthe sun’s being snuffed out? Who cares about prestige or magical ranking when all\nthe air just left the planet?\nWhile it is essential to treat the characters’ concerns as the central frame around\nwhich you build your story, you must direct the action toward specific ends. Almost\nevery troupe has one or two players who insist on wheeling and dealing to the\nexclusion of everything else. How will you involve those players without sacrificing\nthe rest and without losing the direction you want the story to take? There won’t be\ntime for some character’s crafty and politically convoluted yearlong chronicle to\nmaneuver her opponents aside and win the throne or gain the princedom. Why\nwould the character want those things anyway when the world is ending? Some\nplayers will realize the foolishness of the character’s aspirations at that point and join\nthe main story thread. Others will not. So if that’s the only thing that means\nanything to the character, by all means, work it in and leave her sitting atop a\ntoppling throne ruling over empty nothingness as the world crashes to an end.

It works like this:\nIf the character insists on playing up her political maneuvering, nobody else acts\nlike they care. They all ignore her as she plots and plans, then allow her to take the\nthrone and pay no attention whatsoever to her decrees. It’s hard for a ruler to enforce\nher will when nobody plays along. While she’s playing queen for a day, the rest of the\ncharacters can go about the actual story you’ve woven for them while seeing how\nhollow such trappings as rulership truly are in the face of annihilation. At the\nextreme, if the character is disrupting things too much, the rest of the characters can\ntopple her from the throne and force her compliance or — sigh — destroy or banish\nthe character. Meanwhile, this becomes a lesson in group dynamics and cooperation\nfor the good of all.\nThen again, if this is all too harsh and if the character is truly crafty, you\nmight allow her to play out her little game. She might win the princedom or\nqueenship and brilliantly lead everyone along the shining glorious road to\nvictory — or conversely, provide a delicious distraction that undercuts what the\ncharacters are struggling to achieve.\nIn any case, if you’ve read your players correctly, it shouldn’t be too hard to\ninvolve them in End-Time stories they’ll be looking for. Give them a clear sign of\nthe way you want them to go, and they’ll write the story for you.\nPACING\nACING\nACING\nACING\nACING\nAt some time or another, everyone has experienced a game that seemed to drag\non forever with nothing really happening, where eventually characters were left\nwith nothing to talk about but frivolous or out-of-game topics. That generally\nhappens when the Storyteller has to run a game without sufficient time to plan it,\nwhen he can’t think of anything to run or when he’s afraid the session will end too\nquickly. It’s incredibly frustrating and boring for the players. Presumably, with the\nend looming just ahead, the Storyteller won’t lack for material.\nOn the other hand, you’ve probably played in games where there’s so much\ngoing on — all of it in different places — that you don’t understand what’s happening\nand can’t adjust what you’re doing in time to be in on anything exciting. The\ncharacter careens from scene to scene with no clear idea of why or what it’s all about.\nThat can be equally frustrating, because while it is perfectly fine to make the\ncharacters feel as though they can’t keep up with what’s going on, having events\noccurring so rapidly that the players feel lost just breeds confusion and frustration.\nUnfortunately, with everything that needs to be brought out in an End-Times\nchronicle, it’s all too possible for things to get lost in the shuffle.\nIn an End-Time scenario, pacing is critical. Because the end is coming — but\nnot quite yet — you must give the characters and the players mile markers along the\nway. Goals to accomplish in the short run that have an effect on how soon and under\nwhat conditions the end comes. Once you’ve begun the beginning of the end, you\nwon’t be able to turn aside from it, but you also can’t postpone it forever. You need\nto set a certain time (even if just for your own knowledge) by which the end willcome\nwhether the characters are ready or not.\nDoing so creates tension and a sense of needing to spend their time wisely\nto accomplish what they can before they’re wiped out of existence.

There’s\nnothing wrong with having the characters just run out of time as they race to\navert disaster, at least if they deserve it due to their prior apathy or inaction.\nCertainly it’s a more realistic ending, if a bit less satisfying emotionally. Just\ndon’t put them out there on a crash course to Armageddon, then keep delaying\nthe denouement until they’re sick of the whole mess.\nFLAVOR\nLAVOR\nLAVOR\nLAVOR\nLAVOR\nThe exact flavor of the game depends heavily on which scenario you choose as\nmost appropriate for your players. If you decide that things should go out with a\nwhimper, it’s highly unlikely you’ll strive for a triumphant feel to the game. Likewise,\nif you plan on sending them out with a bang, a totally pessimistic slant (with no hope\nfor what comes after) will drag the game down no matter how many pyrotechnics you\ntry to include. Do you plan on triumph or disaster? Are you shooting for a game in\nwhich the characters go down to sweet oblivion knowing they’ve saved something\nfor the people of the future? Will they be dragged down kicking and screaming to a\ndark abyss never knowing if their sacrifice was for nothing? Or are you trying for a\nflavor that is something in between those two? Do you plan to offer the optimists in\nthe group hope that they just might survive? Or would your players rather throw their\ncharacters into the fray knowing they’ll die and expecting nothing less than a\nhorrible, painful, meaningless death? Is this all about greatness or a cynical telling\nof disaster that can’t be averted, death that can’t be avoided and the obliteration of\nall the characters ever meant for no purpose other than nihilism?\nMost players would rather see favorite characters survive, but if that’s not\npossible, they want their deaths to be noble, heroic, honorable or meaningful. Who\nwants to be the hapless soul that slips on grease from his cheese fries and breaks his\nneck falling downstairs?\nOn another note, far too many games begin with grave matters consuming the\nattention of the players, yet somehow humor manages to intrude. It’s a fact that\nhuman beings just aren’t made for unalloyed horror and fear, and in appropriate\ndoses, humor often provides the sauce that makes the rest of the game spicier. In\nhis most powerful tragedies, after all, Shakespeare still included at least a little\nhumor because its inclusion contrasted the heavier emotions of the rest of the\nwork. If all we ever do is weep, why fight to keep anything going? Players and\ncharacters alike need a little of the lighter emotions to give them something worth\nfighting for. This is not to say that non-stop joking should be encouraged\n(especially out of character), but if you allow it judiciously, as an accent at the right\nplaces, it can make or break a story.\nBUILDUP\nUILDUP\nUILDUP\nUILDUP\nUILDUP\nPacing and buildup are related but have an important difference that bears\nmentioning. No good story starts at the top of the action and runs headlong to the\nfinish unless it’s a very short film. Even then, there’s usually some sort of slower start,\nthen the action builds gradually from there. With an End-Time story, you should\nbegin by inserting small clues, then some other clues, resolve some and finally move\ninto the action phase while adding even more to the initial information.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Feel free to build slowly and methodically if that’s what the\nplayers prefer, but be prepared to have to accommodate those who make greater\nintuitive leaps forward.\nOMENS\nMENS\nMENS\nMENS\nMENS\nOne of the joys of running an End-Times chronicle is the omens you can scatter\nthroughout the story. Go ahead and write some cool prophecies early on, just\nremember to work them into the story at some point. Naturally, it’s best if the omens\necho some of the ones already made known through various World of Darkness\nbooks (notably Rage Across the Heavens for Werewolf and several later Vampire\nbooks, such as Time of Thin Blood). The various “in-game” books from different\nlines such as The Book of Nod, The Chronicle of the Black Labyrinth and Apocrypha are\nalso excellent sources that you can mine for more ideas. But feel free to make up your\nown to customize your own games.\nSome of the omens or prophecies should relate directly to your players’\ncharacters. You could involve something from their backgrounds, people they know,\ninformation they know, items they have acquired or deeds they need to perform. You\ncan even work your own prophecies and omens into some of the published ones to\nreflect special attributes, knowledge or skills your players’ characters possess.\nFor example, if a character is a scholar, you might involve her in discovering\nsome esoteric knowledge or uncovering an ancient tale that has a prophecy that\nconcerns her buried within it. A more physical character might defeat a foe only to\nfind he’s carrying some item that gives a clue the character has needed to work out\na mystery that has plagued him for some time. If it also gives the other characters\ninformation or provides them with an omen or the answer to questions they’ve had\nconcerning events in the chronicle, so much the better.\nFORESHADOWING\nORESHADOWING\nORESHADOWING\nORESHADOWING\nORESHADOWING\nOne of the best ways to get fully into an End-Times chronicle is through the\ntechnique of foreshadowing. When constructing the story, add in elements that will\nrecur and people who will appear again and again so the players learn who they need\nto know and the sorts of things they need to do to bring the story to a great\nconclusion. Foreshadowing prepares the players and their characters for events yet\nto come, introducing themes and situations they’ll encounter several times before\nthe end. A smaller version of what will eventually play out is always cool. A character\nmight lose something she values, but she’ll realize that she lost it accomplishing\nsomething worthwhile. Foreshadowing need not be some huge occurrence, but it\nshould presage things to come.\nIn foreshadowing, things don’t need to be exactly the same. In fact, it’s better\nif the earlier occurrence is symbolic of later events rather than literal. Loss, betrayal,\nsorrow and death come to mind as appropriate topics, but you can easily foreshadow\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

It’s best to have a number\nof different events planned and allow the players to fit their characters into the ones\nthat make the most sense to them and provide them with the most sense of closure.\nThose who want to follow the story to its conclusion won’t appreciate a big fight in\nwhich they die nobly unless their questions are all answered first, while action\njunkies will resent long-winded winding down when they just want to go out in a\nblaze of glory.\nMake certain you know which kinds of scenarios your players prefer, then point\nthings in that direction and let events lead up to the finale they’re looking for. If the\nplayers are satisfied, if you’ve incorporated the elements that mean something to\neach character, and if the players feel that their characters have received a proper\nsend-off and been instrumental in the events surrounding the End Times, they’ll help\nyou bring the story to a rousing conclusion.\nSTAGECRAFT\nTAGECRAFT\nTAGECRAFT\nTAGECRAFT\nTAGECRAFT\nNever underestimate how valuable some elements of basic staging can be when\nsetting up a stirring scene for a chronicle. It’s important to make players feel as\ngrounded as possible during Laws of Judgment scenarios, especially where large\ndisasters and other epic story elements may already be putting additional pressure on\nsuspension of disbelief.\nAfter all, it requires a certain amount of concentration for players to stay in\ncharacter as well as view the play area and the other characters through that lens at\nall times. When you begin adding things like, “OK, um, when you look outside, you\nsee that, like, the city just fell over and caught fire,” it gets harder for even\nexperienced players to maintain their suspension of disbelief and react in character\nto the events unfolding around them.\nThe more you can make them feel as though they are really immersed in the\nscene, the less they have to concentrate on maintaining their sense of character and\nsetting — and the more they can focus on the events that are changing their world\nforever. What follows is a brief discussion of tips and techniques you can use to do\njust that.\nLOCATION\nOCATION\nOCATION\nOCATION\nOCATION\nChances are, you’re going to have to make do with the same location or set of\nlocations that you’ve been using the entire chronicle. With that in mind, what\nshould you do to evoke the proper sense of setting when meteors start falling, bombs\nstart dropping and other huge End-Times events shake up your in-game location?\nFortunately, the answers aren’t quite as difficult as you might think.\nFirst of all, before considering any changes, make sure you’re not going to\ndamage any part of the play area in the process.

Think about what the effect is that you wish to create and\nhow to move things around to best achieve that result.\nA bombed-out building, barricaded against outside attack? No problem. Flip\nover any furniture that can safely endure such treatment, move most of it to the edges\nof the room (draping it with dull gray or brown cloth is also good), affix a few black\nfabric scraps to make holes in the floor or ceiling, tape a few jagged “blocked by\nrubble” signs to any doors and windows you don’t want used, and cut some cardboard\nboxes into strips to make “boards” to cover the windows and doors. It looks close\nenough to pass in live-action, but it isn’t so sturdy that it will pose any danger if its\nabrupt removal is required. How about a natural glen deep in the forest? Bring in\nwhat plants you can that won’t be in danger from a gaming session, spread brown\ncloth or a simple brown rug on the ground (careful to make sure players don’t slip on\nit), drape furniture pieces with green cloth, then set up some incense with an earthy\nor floral scent, and you have a serviceable glen at your disposal.\nThe key to dressing a location for the End Times is moving, altering or covering\nas many familiar pieces in the location as possible. The more that has happened to\nchange the location in game, the more you want to try to change the out-of-game\nlocation from what the players are used to. Prominent description cards and signs are\nalso good, especially if they substitute for otherwise dangerous phenomena (such as\nobjects supposedly on fire), or they can be combined with a covering or alteration\nthat removes the original from the eyes of the players. Free of what they normally\nexpect to see in front of them, such descriptions become even more potent as the\nminds of the players do not have to try to overlay the description on top of existing\nfamiliar objects.\nLIGHTING\nIGHTING\nIGHTING\nIGHTING\nIGHTING A N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D S S S S SOUND\nOUND\nOUND\nOUND\nOUND\nThe lighting of your play area and the sounds heard during play are two of the\nbiggest and most immediate influences you can use to create the right atmosphere\nfor your game. The right music and lighting can put players in the mood you’re\nlooking for before they ever interact with another character. Likewise, choosing\npoor music and lighting can actively work against the atmosphere you’re trying to\ncreate. Most of the books of the Mind’s Eye Theatre line include some basic lighting\nand music tips, so those won’t be repeated here, but some specific pointers useful for\nJudgment chronicles are included.\nLighting\nAside from making sure there is always enough light so players can move about\nsafely, lighting’s most important rule for live-action gaming is quite simply to always\ndo your best to change the lighting from how it appears normally. If all you do is just\nmove around a couple of lamps or put in brighter (or darker) bulbs, those small\nchanges still do a lot to separate your game space and take it from something familiar\ninto a whole new place — namely, your in-game location. Likewise, unless you’re\ngoing for a Technocratic stronghold or sterile Pentex lab, avoid as much overhead\nfluorescent lighting as possible, even if it means bringing in floor lamps and the like.\nIt’s horribly modern, terribly unflattering and creates very little in the way of shadow\nand mystery for you to work with.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

While\nflashlights tend to be too limited to light your main play areas (though characters\nmay need to carry them when traveling), many camping stores sell a variety of\ninexpensive electric emergency lanterns that can be used to light key spaces.\nProvidedextremecaution is used and open flame of any kind is never left unattended,\ncandles or actual hurricane lanterns can also be used to the same effect, reminding\nplayers just how precious light becomes when the electricity goes out and simple\ntools are all they have left. Flickering light is a wonderful way to indicate a building\nthat has sustained severe damage or possibly a fire of some kind. If individual light\nsources aren’t a viable option, white electric lights can be dimmed to simulate\n“emergency power,” while using soft yellow light can simulate diffuse candlelight.\nIf supernatural effects are altering the lighting conditions in the chronicle, do\nyour best to simulate them in game. If the red light of Anthelios is shining down day\nand night, put some red bulbs in lamps near windows or even in outside lights such\nas floodlights, porch lights or over a doorway. That way, whenever the players step\noutside or go near a window, you can simply click on the red light and help keep them\nimmersed in the world you’re creating. Green bulbs or glow sticks can be used to mark\nareas that are sick with Wyrm-taint, while blue light can be used to denote an\nUmbral area or a potential source of valuable Quintessence. Done properly, players\nwill come to understand your lighting scheme, and eventually you can even use it\nto give them quick visual cues about the nature of a scene or prop without needing\nconstant narration or “you see” interruptions.\nSound\nAfter lighting, sound becomes the quickest means of establishing mood and\nbuilding the atmosphere you desire. Perhaps the most important rule of sound design\nfor Mind’s Eye Theatre is that no matter how cool you might think it would be,\nnever let the sound in your scene overpower your players. It’s one thing if they know\nthey’ll be entering a rowdy club or running through a thunderstorm, but if the\nvolume is so loud that it’s painful or impossible to communicate vital out-of-game\ninformation (such as posing challenges), your audio environment is an obstacle, not\na benefit. Limit things to a dull roar at most, and don’t give anyone a hard time for\nasking you to turn it down. Likewise, don’t play anything distracting. If lyrics drag\nplayers out of game or sound effects trigger a player’s real-life phobia, that’s a problem\nand should be eliminated.\nOnce you’ve addressed those concerns, the first question to answer is whether\nthe sound will be in game (such as playing music that is supposedly the band playing\nat the bar), or out of game (such as “fight songs” or other mood music). In-game\nsounds reinforce the feeling of reality. Rather than just imagining a busy nightclub,\nhaving some pounding drum and bass playing lets the players actually experience\npart of the environment directly. Don’t only think of music when it comes to in-\ngame sounds, though. For example, many stores offer inexpensive “sounds of nature”\ndiscs that can help create the impression of raging storm, dark bayou or calm forest\nglade. Just make sure they are purely nature sounds and do not also include music or\nlyrics. Likewise, a disc of military sound effects such as gunshots and air raids can help\nsimulate urban warfare or a nearby battle raging, while a disc of creepier effects such\nas howls and demonic laughter can add an eerie, otherworldly tone. The only word\nof caution is to check the quality of sound effects CDs before you buy them if at all\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

While many are perfectly suitable for play, quite a few are very hokey\n(especially “spooky” ones), and they will only set players to snickering instead of\ninspiring the reaction you want. Listen before playing.\nOut-of-game sound is a bit easier to arrange, since it requires no in-game\njustification, but it is also easier to overdo. While playing a haunting track is a good\nway to create atmosphere, if the players always hear a swell of dramatic or ominous\nmusic every time they walk into a room, it will quickly lose all potency. It’s the\nmusical equivalent of the cliché crash of thunder following a dire announcement,\nand it will get just as old if used too often. Repetition is also an important pitfall to\navoid. We all have favorite albums and tracks for creating different moods, but most\nplayers have had at least one experience with a Storyteller who always puts on the\nsame CD of “fight music” or sets one particular track on repeat when preparing any\nkind of “scary” scene, to the point where it became a joke or even an annoyance. Vary\nyour selections as much as possible, or if you don’t have such variety, use what you\nhave wisely and let eloquent silence rule otherwise.\nSome Storytellers might even wish to experiment with a “blended” audio\narrangement with a pair stereos. One creates in-game sound effects like the sound\nof a thunderstorm or a battle, while another plays out-of-game mood music. This can\nbe tricky to set up, especially if you want to time certain sounds to play in a particular\norder on both machines, but the result can be a very rewarding complex, layered\naudio environment that establishes atmosphere for the game on several different\nlevels at once.\nIt is also worth noting that not every scene requires audio accompaniment to\nbegin with. This is especially true for games that maintain a sense of gritty reality and/\nor a strong grounding in the everyday. This is especially true for games with actual\nhuman protagonists such as Laws of the Reckoning and Laws of the Hunt, but it\nshould by no means be limited to those games either. After all, real life doesn’t have\na soundtrack, and while games are meant to be tales of heroes and anti-heroes,\nnothing says they need a tragically hip soundtrack for every moment. If the players\nare crying over a fallen comrade, there’s no need to put on sad music to reinforce the\nmood. In fact, it might seem intrusive to the scene — an audio suggestion they don’t\nneed. Likewise, an absence of “fight music” can help make combat seem much less\nlike an action movie and more like a real life-and-death struggle. This can be a\ndifficult matter to judge, but the best way to find the right balance is simply to observe\nwhat the players enjoy, ask them some questions and arrive at what works best for\nyour chronicle.\nTOOLS\nOOLS\nOOLS\nOOLS\nOOLS O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E T T T T TRADE\nRADE\nRADE\nRADE\nRADE\nAlmost as important as setting up the play area is what you will be presenting\nyour players with when your Narrator characters arrive on the scene.

These requirements also help\nplayers make potentially critical in-game distinctions without needing to ask out-of-\ngame questions. If they know that anyone wearing a red bandanna with a black skull\non it is part of the dreaded Blood of the All-Father gang, they don’t have to think\ntwice about what they’re seeing when your Narrators arrive wearing that gear.\nYou shouldn’t feel obligated to limit such costuming changes to the Narrator\ncharacters, either. If some of the players have formed a militia, for example, it only\nmakes sense in character that they would have some kind of uniform or insignia to\nidentify their own members and avoid friendly fire incidents. Encourage them to\ndevelop and wear armbands, badges, bandannas or even just a specific set of colors\nand stick with it as long as necessary. Likewise, if the events of your chronicle have\ngrown truly dire and civilization has collapsed, it’s reasonable to promote the notion\nof wearing dirty and ripped-up costuming to the players, to give them a better idea\nof what their characters are going through and create a strong visual impression of\nwhat has happened to them.\nBear in mind some basic guidelines on costuming, however. Most importantly,\nno matter how apocalyptic the scenario becomes, costuming should never smell so\nfoul, cover so little or just generally be so offensive as to cause out-of-game problems\nbetween players or with the authorities. Lastly, anything that is required should be\nsimple and inexpensive to obtain (hence the suggestion of things like bandannas or\nspecific color schemes). Requiring players or Narrators to spend serious money on\nthings like leather jackets or military uniforms is overly severe and often counter-\nproductive. If your troupe wishes to do something voluntarily, that’s one thing, but\ntrying to demand that everyone fork over a lot of cash just to keep playing\n“appropriately” is an abuse of power.\nProps\nAs with creating distinctive costume designs, carrying specific props can be a\ngreat way to indicate a number of things at a glance, particularly during the End\nTimes. If certain types of objects become extremely powerful, dangerous, coveted or\nscarce during your Judgment scenario, assign a specific prop or set of props to such\nitems and let the players know about it beforehand. That way, when your Narrator\ncharacter walks in bearing the item in question, you don’t have to interrupt play and\ntell your gathered troupe something like, “Oh yeah, by the way, see that thing he’s\ncarrying? It’s <really cool item X>, and you all want it.” They’ll automatically know\nit when they see it, and they won’t have to suddenly adjust their play or their\nperceptions to accommodate this new idea. Before long, even just having a few such\nprops scattered around the room will be cause for great conflict or discussion, and all\nwithout much fuss on the part of the Narrator.\nLikewise, on the opposite end of the scale, if an object or objects become\nextremely common during the End Times, it’s often best to give it a distinct prop or\nappearance as well. If all the Garou start carrying spears tipped with fallen stars, you\nmay wish to make item cards a different color or shape to differentiate them from the\nrest of the weapons being carried, as Garou will likely recognize their comrades as\nsoon as they see those weapons.

If the Narrators are portraying refugees of a\nvampire slave camp, give them a few humble, ordinary items and little else. Finding\na downed opponent carrying only weapons and gear implies a trained military force\nat work (as opposed to civilian militia members, who tend to carry small personal\neffects with them). The possibilities are endless for clever Storytellers who are\nwilling to take some time to design prop sets for their Narrators. As with costuming,\nthe only major limitation on props is to avoid objects that are too expensive or time-\nconsuming unless players and Narrators explicitly consent to such items. If nothing\nelse, it’s a fact of gaming that props get lost, trashed or otherwise rendered useless\nduring sessions, no matter how careful players might be.

Although it would be great if you could play every Narrator\ncharacter yourself, even most Storytellers haven’t quite mastered being in two\nor three places at once, so you’ll probably have to pick a trusted player or\nNarrator to play your crucial characters for you. Particularly if you haven’t used\nsuch a powerful being before, your choice of which player to portray her will\nlargely determine how she comes across to the other players, which is why it’s\ncrucial to pick that person carefully. It should, of course, be someone you know\nto be a good and versatile roleplayer.\nIf possible, try to pick someone who has played a wide range of characters\nin this group in the past. If you pick someone whose characters are always\ncalculating and devious, some of your players may just assume that their new\npersona is as well, and your game may be shot down before it starts by repeated\nassassination attempts based on this out-of-character information. If you do\nhave to pick someone who tends toward playing similar characters most of the\ntime, try to choose a person whose characters display a good amount of\ncharisma, as well as the ability to handle large problems efficiently. This will\nhopefully help counteract the “typecasting” downfall.\nNeedless to say, it’s also vital that your Narrator understands not only her\nrole and any background information that goes with it, but also when to use her\nvast power — and more importantly when not to use it. Don’t let her throw her\nweight around solely for the sake of doing so. Make sure also that she isn’t\nunconsciously favoring friends or former allies in her dealings with the players.\nThe best Narrator characters entertain the players and provide them with vital\ninformation or opportunities to take action, not solve every riddle or defeat\nevery enemy themselves. No matter how important a particular Narrator\ncharacter might be in the “official” timeline, your players and their characters\nare the heroes of your story. They should always take center stage. During the\nEnd Times, it’s vital that the players feel that their actions make a difference.\nIf not, then they’re little better than spectators to their own demise, and that’s\nno fun at all.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

They include mocked-up newspapers dealing with\nEnd-Times topics, altered photos of bizarre phenomena, homemade religious tracts\nproclaiming “THE END IS HERE,” doctored video clips showing strange creatures\non the loose, letters from important Narrator characters expressing dread over recent\nevents, strange stones simulating the meteors that have fallen from the sky, phony\nnews broadcasts inserted into music CDs that break in to announce some new\ndisaster and a reclusive hermit’s dusty old journal filled with scrawled sketches and\nprophecies. Such artifacts help bring home the reality of what the characters are\ngoing through in a way few pure descriptions can. The more such props you can show\nthem, play for them or actually put into their hands, the less fantastic events of the\nEnd Times become and the more players feel as though they are actually immersed\nin a world going through such immense changes.\nThis is not to say you should break yourself slaving to create such props for every\nsession, or that you should abandon descriptions as a means of conveying what is\noccurring. The more often you can join your descriptions of events with such\nconcrete props for the players to latch onto, though, the more it will reinforce the\nnotion of the world you are creating.\nMAKEUP\nAKEUP\nAKEUP\nAKEUP\nAKEUP\nProperly applying even a little bit of makeup is the final way to quickly\ngenerate a distinctive appearance for Narrator characters, as well as an easy way\nto keep track of character conditions such as sickness, injury or even some visible\nsupernatural effects. A pathetic refugee cowering in fear looks that much more\nhelpless and victimized with some added bruises or scratches or a light tracing of\nthe bones of the face with dark shading (which creates a hollow, starved appear-\nance). Unkempt hair and a few days’ worth of stubble for men can suggest those\nwho have been without the comforts of civilization for some time, while blacked\nout teeth and dirty hands make an instant beggar or scavenger. Perhaps certain\ngangs that have arisen in the fall of civilization give their members ritual scars or\ntattoos. A vivid depiction of these traits can help cement their identity in the\nminds of the players extremely quickly.\nIn addition to these basic steps, consider having players apply specific types of\nmakeup to indicate their current health or visible injuries they have suffered. This\nis most useful in scenarios featuring plagues or other conditions that are immediately\napparent, but it can be just as powerful if used for more mundane causes as well.\nHaving a visible record that allows you to watch other characters gradually\nsuccumbing to wounds or sickness or judge how badly hurt a Narrator character is\njust by looking at him can be a wonderful way to help underscore how desperate\nthings have become.\nDon’t forget the supernatural, either. As the mechanisms that have hidden the\nshadowy beings of the World of Darkness begin to fall away, requiring supernatural\ncreatures to wear particular kinds of makeup can show just how exposed they’ve\nbecome, as well as allowing players to recognize such creatures at a glance. As long\nas your makeup doesn’t disturb non-players or get you bounced from a game location,\nfeel free to pull out all the stops in depicting just how strange, desperate and different\nthe characters appear.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Laws\nof Judgment scenarios are not exempt from this phenomenon. This section provides\na troubleshooting guide for Storytellers (and players) to help prepare for those times\nwhen a chronicle just doesn’t follow the plan. In addition, some suggestions for\ncontinuing a chronicle in the aftermath of the “end” provide help for Storytellers\nwho want to take their games to the next level.\nAfter all, your story doesn’t have to end just because the “world” does. Think\nof the final episode of a favorite television series. In all but a few cases, a few loose\nends are left dangling, waiting for someone to pick them up. When a beloved multi-\nvolume series of books reaches its last installment, some subplots remain unresolved\nor with open endings, ready for another round of books to begin with a new\ngeneration of characters.\nThis section of the chapter has applications for Storytellers and players. We\ndon’t need to emphasize the difference between player and “Storyteller-only”\nmaterial in this section. We expect players to realize that if they intend to enjoy a\nstory, they should avoid reading certain sections of this book or rely on their\nStorytellers to share appropriate sections with them.\nTOPICS\nOPICS\nOPICS\nOPICS\nOPICS FOR\nFOR\nFOR\nFOR\nFOR S S S S STORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nConsider the following topics a primer on common problem areas or questions\nabout “what comes next,” things to consider once you decide to take the chronicle\ndown the road to its end. Take the advice given here to heart or adapt it to your own\nparticular circumstances. Ends are almost always beginnings, after a fashion. What\nsort of chronicle will your End-Time story begin?\nWH Y\nH Y\nH Y\nH Y\nH Y E E E E EN D\nN D\nN D\nN D\nN D I I I I IT?\nWhy should you end your Mind’s Eye Theatre chronicle? This might seem a\ncurious question to ask at this point, but give it some serious thought. If the only\nreason you want to bring on the end of everything the players know is because you\nthink one of the end scenarios in this book is “neat,” you’re probably better off\nwaiting until a more solid justification presents itself. Otherwise, the players might\nresent you for ending the game on little more than a whim.\nOnce you have laid aside any such passing thoughts, however, there are several\nreasons to begin discussing the end of a chronicle. The first and foremost is simply\nbecause the chronicle isn’t fun and exciting anymore and you’re prepared to move\non to something else. Other reasons for ending a chronicle include providing a\nsatisfying ending to the overall story, or providing a clear break between an old\nchronicle and an entirely new one.\nThe first reason is the simplest. If your chronicle isn’t providing your troupe\nwith the enjoyment it once did, then it’s probably time to wrap things up and move\non. Chronicles sometimes flicker out slowly rather than ending cleanly, particularly\nif the Storyteller’s interest wanes.

Ending a\nchronicle can actually invigorate your creativity, since it opens up so many new\npossibilities, and in the chronicle’s ending, you may find seeds of a newer, fresher and\nmore exciting story.\nAlthough it’s theoretically possible for chronicles to go on indefinitely, it’s\noften wise to consider an ending to your chronicle. Good stories include a beginning,\nmiddle and end, and an ending helps neatly tie together everything that came\npreviously in the chronicle, just like the ending of a good book, film or other story.\nTherefore, it’s a good idea to have your chronicle go out on a high note, when things\nare going well, rather than allowing it to run out of steam and die a slow death. If your\nending leaves players wanting more, you can always start a new chronicle as a sequel\nto the old — with the same characters or different ones — and take things in a new\ndirection, knowing that the previous chapter is closed.\nIn fact, ending a chronicle can provide a clean and clear break between that\nstory and the next Mind’s Eye Theatre chronicle your troupe creates.

Some\nStorytellers might be concerned that informing the players that the chronicle is\nending might affect their actions and their enjoyment of the game. If they know that\nit’s all going to end soon, they might act differently than if they didn’t know. This\nis true, but good players can separate what they know from what their characters\nknow. A change in player behavior might also be exactly what you want for the\nending of your story.\nIt’s usually fairly hard to hide the fact that a chronicle is coming to an end,\nespecially if all the signs are there for the characters to see. Players are also likely to\nstruggle against the ending of the chronicle if they don’t know that it’s inevitable.\nWhile you might want the characters to struggle, putting the players in a situation\nwhere they feel like their struggles are pointless only frustrates them.\nSo it’s probably best to inform your players that you intend to end the chronicle\nand solicit their help in doing so. Find out what plot threads and loose ends the\nplayers want to see resolved before it’s all over. Ask if there are things that they want\ntheir characters to accomplish before the end. You can even get player input as to\nhow they want their characters written out of the story (or if they do at all). Given\nthe opportunity, many players are quite enthusiastic about an opportunity to be in\non the destruction of the world and a dramatic ending to the chronicle.\nGETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING E E E E EVERYONE\nVERYONE\nVERYONE\nVERYONE\nVERYONE I I I I INVOLVED\nNVOLVED\nNVOLVED\nNVOLVED\nNVOLVED\nYour players have devoted countless hours, months and even years to your\nchronicle. They’ve invested time and passion in their characters, meticulously\nbringing them to life (or “unlife”), developing their personalities, ambitions and\ncontacts from session to session. Now you want to bring the whole thing to an end,\nand you need everyone’s help to do it. The first step in bringing every character into\nthe scenario is to know your characters (and the people who play them). Who are\nthey? What are their goals? What can spark their interest or drive them into taking\npart in the story you plan to tell?\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

The\npeople who go to see certain movies or read certain books do so because they enjoy\nthe subject matter, whether it’s action-adventure, gothic suspense, intrigue, horror\nor some other genre. They’ve seen the trailers for movies or read the cover text for\nbooks, and their interest has been piqued. The advertisements for those movies and\nbooks play to the entertainment desires of their audiences.\nThink of your chronicle as if it were a movie or a book. What kind of audience\nwill it attract (or has it attracted)? How can you make it seem attractive to those\noutside that audience?\nIf the majority of your characters enjoy action, whether engaging in combat\nagainst their enemies or racing against the clock to accomplish a goal, make certain\nyour pre-chronicle descriptions emphasize the action sequences. If you are the\nStoryteller for a live-action troupe that prefers intense roleplaying and only relies on\nchallenges as a last resort, talk up the drama of your scenario.\nThink about who your players are. By now, if you’ve been running an ongoing\nchronicle, you probably have a pretty good idea of what their interests are. Make\ncertain you have designed your “endgame” to appeal to your players first and\nforemost. Then gradually let them know that you have a memorable way to bring\nyour chronicle to an end.\nSome players might not want to see the chronicle (or their characters) end.\nThat’s natural, considering the enjoyment they’ve had as well as the time they’ve\ninvested in the game, and it deserves a thoughtful response. Talk with them and\nemphasize the importance of rounding out a good tale. Remind them that their\ncharacters’ personal plots will be accounted for, and suggest that they might want to\nhave a say in their characters’ destinies rather than have them disposed of by\nStoryteller fiat.\nFinally, if you make your players feel that they are a part of your chronicle, they\nwill become involved. Ask their advice on how they want you to work their\ncharacters into your plot and suggest some ways they can help you put the chronicle\ntogether. Enlist their aid in forming some of the subplots. Build some scenes around\ntheir characters and let them know you’re doing that. Find out what loose ends their\ncharacters have and let them know that they finally have the opportunity to\nconfront the primogen member who has been the bane of their undeath or confront\nthe Black Spiral Dancer who murdered their first pack leader or track down a cabal\nmember who defected to the Technocracy.

Does\neveryone have to die, be saved or escape to a different reality if that’s the general\nfate of the world?\nThis is a trick question. In fact, no two people (or characters) ever experience\nthe same thing in the same way.

The real question involves how you handle each character’s\nexperience of the same event.\nYour endgame might result in a world without supernaturals. Your original\nintentions for the final session might involve a cataclysmic event targeting only\nthose individuals with extra-human powers. On the surface, this seems like a\nfoolproof climax, one that affects all the characters in the same way but still allows\nfor individual reactions to the same general fate. In reality, some characters will\nundoubtedly discover a loophole in your scenario — either a way to flee to a realm\n(or another dimension) not affected by the final catastrophe or a way to regain their\nmortality and make themselves no longer a target.\nIf this happens, don’t concern yourself too much. Those characters have\neffectively written themselves out of your game and ended their own story, which\naccomplishes the same purpose. The freedom to modify the story is essential to live-\naction gaming and distinguishes it from other kinds of storytelling. In live-action\nplay, everyone is a storyteller to some degree, though consensus decrees that there\nwill be a single Storyteller (that’s you) to direct the plot. The cooperation of\neveryone, players and Storyteller, to tell a mutually satisfying story is the heart of\nlive-action play.\nIf some players choose to rewrite the script you have planned for their characters\nwithout changing the outcome of the story itself, give them your blessing and make\nsure they earn it every bit as much as everyone else.\nHANDLING\nANDLING\nANDLING\nANDLING\nANDLING A A A A AN T I\nN T I\nN T I\nN T I\nN T I- H\n- H\n- H\n- H\n- HEROIC\nEROIC\nEROIC\nEROIC\nEROIC C C C C CHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nFace it — not every character is a hero in the traditional sense of the word. If\nyour game requires the characters to sacrifice themselves in a dramatic battle to\ndecide the fate of the world, what do you do with characters who are not suited for\nsuch heroics? When confronted with the prospect of facing down the ultimate foe,\nwhether the long-prophesied rising of the Antediluvians, the full force of the\nWyrm’s wrath, an army of Fomorians from the Deep Dreaming or the unified army\nof the Technocracy, some characters will seek any means to avoid direct conflict. In\nfact, some might try to sell out the other characters to the enemy!\nIt’s a truism of live-action games many that many players enjoy playing\ncharacters who live by their wits rather than by their muscle. After all, live-\naction emphasizes social skills over brute force. Such characters prefer to rely\non getting others to do their dirty work or using the force of their personality\nor cunning to influence those around them so they do not have to fight. In an\nend scenario, such actions often seem inappropriate or frivolous, yet they can\nbe the essence of certain characters. How do you make certain that these\ncharacters have a vital part to play in your end scenario without forcing\ncharacters to act against their natures? Furthermore, how do you bring these\nplayers into the action or create a place for them in your story without losing\nthe rest of the group in the process?\nThere are a number of different approaches to this dilemma, which is a common\none regardless of a troupe’s size. Even in a small troupe of less than 10 players, one\nor two individuals generally prefer to play characters with little skill in direct\nconfrontation. Sometimes such characters are loners by nature, preferring to act on\ntheir own, either as information gatherers or spies.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

Not all events, however, need to\ninvolve Physical Challenges or combat of any kind. Make certain that you\ninclude in your chronicle scenes that are geared for your less combat-\noriented characters. As long as you find ways to make every character feel she\nis playing a vital role in your chronicle, you can keep everyone involved. You\nmight even find that some of the characters least likely to sacrifice them-\nselves might end up leading the charge — or else meeting their end on their\nown terms, though no less dramatically.\nIf all else fails, and some characters simply do not want to participate in the end\nscenario you have planned, you can always provide them with an out — an escape\nthat only they know of and that they alone can take advantage of. While they might\nnot enjoy a hero’s fate, they will at least enjoy the story.\nTITANIC\nITANIC\nITANIC\nITANIC\nITANIC B\n B B\n B BATTLES\nATTLES\nATTLES\nATTLES\nATTLES\nNo matter how much you try to avoid it in the presentation of a scenario,\nchances are combat will creep in sooner or later, as characters settle personal grudges\nor defend themselves from enemies bent on preventing them from succeeding at\ntheir last desperate mission. And then there’s the question of characters caught up\nin scenarios involving huge battles or even all-out war. Combat can be a big\nheadache for Storytellers, especially on a large scale, but there’s no reason it must be\nthat way, particularly with sufficient preparation and a skilled Narrator or two acting\nas backup.\nGiven the nature of combat in Mind’s Eye Theatre, Storytellers are\nencouraged to handle most large battles with some sweeping overall descrip-\ntions. You can influence them with the outcome of several Mental or Social\nChallenges related to Leadership, Sovereign and the like if any characters have\nassumed command roles and are plotting strategy and tactics for their side. Then\nshift focus back to the characters and their immediate surroundings by playing\nout a few particularly dramatic moments that the characters get caught up in as\nthe battle goes on. (Such moments include rescuing a downed comrade, bracing\nfor a charge, rallying their troops, challenging the enemy leader and her dreaded\npersonal guards, retrieving a powerful lost treasure, et cetera.) You can even allot\na certain amount of time for each scene in order to keep the action flowing. (If\nthe characters don’t defeat the enemy leader in an hour, events conspire to sweep\nboth sides apart to fight another day, for instance.) In between each such\npersonal scene, give an update of the overall state of the battle as the characters\nwould see it, and you’ll quickly find the dreaded bogeyman of mass combat\nbecoming an exciting tool to portray the End Times.\nOnce you’ve brought the characters into the thick of battle, make sure the\naction is, well, action — always keep it moving, vivid and dramatic. Don’t get bogged\ndown in rules or waste time adjudicating combat with every single peon blocking the\nobjective. Let them dish out punishment on the enemy rank and file without too\nmuch trouble, then resume regular combat rules and difficulty when they confront\nthe real enemies or true obstacles involved in the scene. Doing so not only keeps the\nplayers pumped up and feeling as though their characters are the heroes of the tale,\nbut it also trims a lot of time off combat while allowing the players to feel as though\nthey are caught up in a grand battle of epic proportions.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

This means generally tying up any loose plot threads from\nthe chronicle. As a result, players won’t always be left wondering what might have\nhappened, or what that subplot was really all about. It helps to wind down the\nchronicle and wrap things up neatly.\nThe trick is to keep from wrapping things up too neatly. You don’t want to tie\nup all the loose ends of your chronicle in a single story or, worse yet, in a single\nepilogue, since it can come off as rushed and artificial. If you have the luxury of\nwrapping up your chronicle in its own good time, address the various hanging plot\nthreads, one by one, until they’re all done. Take care along the way not to introduce\nany major new plot threads that won’t be resolved by the time the chronicle is done.\nThis way, things draw to a close naturally as the characters resolve their various\npersonal stories and the overall plot of the chronicle plays itself out.\nCONSTRUCTING\nONSTRUCTING\nONSTRUCTING\nONSTRUCTING\nONSTRUCTING A N\nA N\nA N\nA N\nA N A A A A AFTERMATH\nFTERMATH\nFTERMATH\nFTERMATH\nFTERMATH\nYou’ve ended the world, either through political, social, divine or natural\ncatastrophe. Have you destroyed the planet itself? If you haven’t, what’s left? In\nrunning an end of the World of Darkness scenario, you need to establish for yourself\njust how much of the world you are going to end. If you use a scenario that calls for\nnot only the end of supernatural life on Earth but the end of life in general (and\nperhaps even an end to the planet), then the answer to this question is relatively easy.\nWhat’s left is, well, not much.\nIf, however, you intend only to end the world as it has existed for your players,\nyou need to decide what sort of world is left. A scenario that removes only\nsupernaturals from the world will still leave behind a society of mortals. How will the\nabsence of supernatural beings change the world? Will mortals suddenly find\nthemselves free of many of the institutions that have constrained their freedom?\nWill they at last inhabit a world in which the police serve and protect all the people\ninstead of their Kindred masters? Will mortals inherit an earth devoid of Gnosis and\nopen to all sorts of opportunists? Will the human race grow less creative without\nchangelings to spur them on, or will they find themselves able to create without\ngoing through periods of stagnation? Will the departure of magic from the world\nguarantee a safe but dull society? Will the victorious Technocracy realize that\nwithout magic, science itself does not work properly?\nIf the Nephandi or other sinister forces have conquered the world, what sort of\ndepredations do they visit on mortals? Does the advent of the Sixth Age, the period\nof greatest darkness and evil on the Great Wheel, herald a dismal future for everyone?\nAsk yourself what happens after the chronicle is over. Does the world keep\ngoing without the characters, or does it grind to a halt after the final curtain drops?\nThis question is particularly important if you plan to continue using the same\n“world” as a background for later chronicles. If the world goes on without the\ncharacters, you need to know what kind of world remains and what kind of stories\nyou can tell in that “brave new world.”\nGenerally speaking, unless you and your players are very excited about the idea,\nlet them know in advance that you do not plan on running a “post-apocalyptic”\nchronicle.

What happens in an end-\nof-the-world scenario if characters manage to avert the planned disaster?\nThe answer to this question is simple. Let them “win.”\nThe process behind the answer is not so simple. If the characters manage to\ndefeat the scenario, whether you hit the world with a killer asteroid, shatter the\nGauntlet between the physical world and the Umbra or raise legions of zombies\naround the world, then give them the reward that comes with clever planning, hard\nfighting and noble sacrifice.\nBefore you do, however, make certain that the players have, in fact, truly earned\ntheir victory. Regardless of whether they win or succumb to your endgame, the\ncharacters should feel as if they’ve been through a hard fight. The players, as well,\nshould feel that you taxed all their abilities, stretched their roleplaying talents to the\nmaximum and drawn every ounce of clever thinking from them that you could in\norder to bring about that rarest of rarities — victory against impossible odds.\nKeep in mind that clever play and convincing roleplaying should always be\nrewarded. Just because you intend to bring a long-running chronicle to an earth-\nshattering close doesn’t mean that everything will go according to plan. Players have\na knack for finding loopholes in the plot, taking advantage of every weakness and\nfinding hidden strengths within their characters.

The story does allow for the\nplayers to win if they can. This is what live-action roleplaying is all about.\nIn the event that the players do find a way to save the world or avert disaster,\nmake sure you have a suitable ending for victory as well as defeat — one that leaves\nthe characters with the feeling that they have overcome overwhelming opposition\nto emerge triumphant.

An epilogue serves to wrap up any\nremaining loose ends, and it shows the players the results of the ending if few or none\nof them are left to see it in character.\nGenerally, an epilogue should be relatively brief.

Storytellers review the various plots for everyone, so that players\nwhose characters were involved in only part of the overall story receive a recounting\nof the big picture. Players share their favorite moments during the game and reveal\nthe secrets about their characters that they have spent all weekend assiduously\nhiding from other players.\nRegular live-action troupes often hold such post-mortem sessions after a\nchronicle ends and before a new one begins. Some do so at regular intervals after\nthe players have passed significant milestones in the story arc. In an End-Time\nscenario, a special post-mortem gathering is not only advised, it’s critical to the\nsense of closure players and Storytellers need to avoid the feeling that they’ve left\nsomething undone.\nMeet with your players as a group. Go over the actions of your game and\nexplain why certain things happened as they did. If players sacrificed their\ncharacters, let them know what their characters’ deaths achieved so they don’t feel\nthat what they did was for nothing. Ask players to share their memorable\nmoments, not only from your last scenario, but from the beginning of your\nchronicle or any other point along its length.

Allow those players whose characters are being eulogized\nto reprise their characters in flashback scenes for one last farewell, perhaps even\ndramatize their last moments that no one else survived to see.

Or you can have each player,\nin character, interact non-violently with her greatest rival. Ask each player to state\nwhat she would want others to remember about her character and have her relate\nwhat her memories are of the other characters.

(Don’t be afraid to ask players to help fund this endeavor, though,\nas it can get expensive.)\nAnother possible idea might be to create a notebook for each player that\ncontains a summary of your endgame, a list of all the players and their\ncharacters (and the fates of those characters). Include some blank sheets for\nplayers to sign as their characters, including brief messages if they wish.\nAssemble a literary and artistic pastiche commemorating the chronicle. Ask\nplayers to contribute poetry, drawings or stories so that, when bound together\nand copied, each player will have a permanent memory book of the game.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"

At last the supernatural denizens of the World of Darkness find\nthemselves confronted with the End Times that they have long viewed through\nprophecy and shadow. Some answer with courage, others with cowardice, but all are\ncalled to an ultimate accounting for everything they have done. The signs are on fire,\nboth epic and intimate events unfold, and no one will walk away from this one\nunchanged — if they walk away at all.\nBefore we go into the details of what is contained within, however, let me tell\nyou a secret:\nThese words were written during a hurricane.\nIt seems only too fitting that as I sat down to compose an introduction to the\nbook that brings an end to Mind’s Eye Theatre, a book devoted to disasters and\nupheaval of all kinds, an actual disaster raged outside. A coincidence like that in\nfiction would be deemed implausible, but there it was. It’s little moments like that,\nwhere the two worlds seem almost too close together for comfort, that make many\nlongtime World of Darkness visitors pause… and then smile as they realize just how\nmuch a part of themselves and their worldview it has become.\nEndings are never easy. Only at the last minute do we ever realize just how much\nremains unsaid and undone, how many more twists and turns we were expecting before\nreaching our destination. Many of us have found best friends or even spouses through these\ngames, and all of us have stories that we never tire of telling. But without an ending, a story\nis a thing incomplete, for ultimately the conclusion puts the rest of the tale into perspective.\nEven if only our imaginations tell us what transpires following the “happily ever after,” we’re\nstill more content for having been given leave to take the story in the direction we desire.\nThis book isn’t about endings, it’s about the entire story so far, what all the characters\nhave laughed, cried and bled for will ultimately mean when they face the greatest test of their\nabilities. More than just a rote translation of the Time of Judgment tabletop series — though\nGehenna, Apocalypse, Ascension and Time of Judgment certainly offer additional useful\nINTRODUCTION:\nTHE SIGNS\nARE ON FIRE\nTo absent friends, lost loves, old gods, and the season of mists;\nand may each and every one of us always give the Devil his due.\n—Hob Gadling, Sandman: A Season of Mists\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n5\nINTRODUCTION\nNTRODUCTION\nNTRODUCTION\nNTRODUCTION\nNTRODUCTION\ninformation — Laws of Judgment has been specifically designed to help Storytellers take\nthese epic tales and tell them in ways that only Mind’s Eye Theatre really can.\nA summary follows of each chapter and the stories it contains:\nChapter One: Judgment Day explores what the masses perceive as the world\nslides into chaos. It also details how the brave souls of Laws of the Hunt react as their\nchosen enemies are destroyed — or emerge stronger than ever.\nChapter Two: Gehenna confronts the vampires of Laws of the Night with\ntales of elders rising, cities crumbling and what is a blessing as well as their greatest\nfear: the end of the Curse of Caine.\nChapter Three: Apocalypse heads to the front lines of the Final Battle to save\nGaia, as the were-creatures of Laws of the Wild, Hengeyokai and the Changing\nBreeds series make their last stand.\nChapter Four: Ascension centers around the mages of Laws of Ascension and\ntheir desperate efforts to reach enlightenment before reality calcifies into faceless\nstasis — or unravels into nothingness.\nChapter Five: Endless Winter places the fae of The Shining Host at the heart\nof stories involving fantastic quests, deadly intrigue, terrifying monsters, and the\nhardest task of all: keeping hope alive.\nChapter Six: Reckoning pushes the imbued of Laws of the Reckoning to their\nlimits, as their strange destiny is revealed and the supernatural makes a last push for\ncontrol — or destruction.\nChapter Seven: The Sixth Age travels to the courts of the Kuei-jin vampires\nof Laws of the East as ancient karmic debts are collected and the Demon Emperor\nat last ascends its throne.\nChapter Eight: Armageddon concerns the undying mummies of Laws of the\nResurrection and their noble struggle to return Balance to the universe before it is\nconsumed by its own darkness.\nChapter Nine: Doomsday descends one last time into the dark Underworld of\nOblivion, where a great war and greater storm of the dead combine to change the\nnature of the afterlife forever.\nChapter Ten: Revelations presents material that a Storyteller can apply to any\nkind of End-Times chronicle. From advice on structuring the final plots for maximum\nimpact to troubleshooting difficult scenarios to creating props that help the players feel\nas though they are truly experiencing the End Times, it’s all here and ready for use.\nAlthough these chapters are already packed with information concerning the\nTime of Judgment and how a Storyteller can best bring it to life for her players, the\nmost powerful resource for any chronicle is reading these lines at this very moment.\nNo matter what might be written on one of these pages, what matters most is what\nthe Storyteller feels will be best for her chronicle. Period.\nSo whether this volume comes at the end of a long-running chronicle or sparks\na brand new beginning, remember always that Laws of Judgment — like all Mind’s\nEye Theatre books — is about your stories and the direction you want to take them.\nNothing says that your stories can’t go on as long as you desire just because our world\nis ending. Indeed, it’s in your hands now more than ever.\nFor all of you over the years who have made Mind’s Eye Theatre great, all the\ncountless chronicles and legions of wonderful Storytellers, players and Narrators —\nthank you. None of these stories would be possible without you.\nLet the final show begin.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n6\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n7\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER O\n O\n O\n O\n ON E\nN E\nN E\nN E\nN E\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E M\n M\n M\n M\n MORTAL\nORTAL\nORTAL\nORTAL\nORTAL W\n W\n W\n W\n WORLD\nORLD\nORLD\nORLD\nORLD\nMore than six billion humans crowd the surface of the Earth, even in the World\nof Darkness. Most of them live their lives never knowing of the supernatural creatures\nthat exist just beyond the fringes of mortal knowledge. A chronicle of the End Times\nmust take into account the reactions of these powerless masses who might never realize\nthat events are happening around them that will cause an end to everything they know.\nTheir stories, in many ways, bring home the true horror of the World of Darkness.\nAt first, only a few perceptive individuals notice that the world is getting stranger, day\nby day. Doomsayers and devout believers in the “end of the world” see signs in news reports\nof natural and man-made calamities. They see it in escalating political tension and acts of\nterrorism. They see it in outbreaks of bizarre diseases that reach pandemic proportions and\nin the general malaise that accompanies the feeling that things are falling apart.\nScientists also suspect that the perfect world of natural law is not quite as\npredictable as they would like it to be. Astronomers notice evidence of “activity” in\nthe asteroid belt or speculate about the likelihood of another cosmic collision similar\nto the one that drove the dinosaurs to extinction. Geologists worry about increasing\nseismic activity between the tectonic plates. Pathologists question the growing\nstrains of anomalous tissue samples collected from victims of violent crimes. These\nindividuals wonder at the proliferation of chaos in the world around them.\nOthers, those mortals who rarely deviate from their daily routine either\nrationalize, ignore or misunderstand the supernatural, hardly noticing the truth —\nthat all things are coming to a close.\nMostly, though, the mortals merely die.\nON J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT D\n D\n D\n D\n DA Y\nA Y\nA Y\nA Y\nA Y\nFor most mortals, the end comes without warning. A sudden breakdown in\ncommunications, mass destruction — either natural or manmade — then silence.\nWhile the Kindred, Garou, mages, changelings and the imbued all experience the\nclimactic moments of their existence, the human race, which is so closely tied into\nall these supernatural societies, simply reaps the consequences.\nCHAPTER ONE:\nJUDGMENT DAY\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n8\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nSome religious groups recognize the telltale marks of the end and actually look\nforward to it with the faith that they will be among the “saved” or chosen. Others\nsee the chaos that precedes the events of the End Times as an excuse for their\nanarchistic tendencies, sparking waves of looting and rioting that might be enough\nto topple governments and cause a total breakdown of society.\nUnless they have overt proof of the existence of vampires, werewolves or other\nsupernatural creatures, most humans never even suspect that their world is ending as a\nfulfillment of a prophecy or the culmination of an age-long struggle that is not even theirs.\nThis is the background of terror and incomprehension against which the stories\nof the end play themselves out in the arena of live-action roleplaying.\nWelcome to the end of the world.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E I I I I INQUISITION\nNQUISITION\nNQUISITION\nNQUISITION\nNQUISITION\nSince its beginning in the 11th century, the Inquisition has waged war against\nthe enemies of the Church. During the course of its existence, it has searched out and\ndestroyed heretics, witches and other groups labeled as evil or undesirable. In the\npresent, the secular Inquisition — otherwise known as the Society of Leopold,\ncontinues to wage war against the supernatural. Drawing upon the power of faith and\nmodern weaponry, Inquisitors pit themselves against vampires and other supernaturals.\nWhile the Inquisition provides a good source of antagonists for most live-action\ngames set in the World of Darkness, it is particularly suited to games involving\nvampires and using rules from Laws of the Night and Laws of the Hunt.\nHow will these determined hunters of the supernatural react to the realization\nthat their world is coming to an end at the hands of those they hunt? As a Storyteller,\nyou should consider several alternative scenarios that can affect the actions of your\nInquisition characters, whether they are player-controlled or Storyteller characters.\n• Wormwood: This scenario provides the Inquisition few opportunities to affect its\noutcome, as the few Chosen vampires who are destined to potentially redeem themselves\nare hiding, protected, inside an old church they call Sanctuary. Apparently, this refuge was\ncreated by nothing less than divine power. While they can leave of their own free will, those\nwho do so suffer hideous, agonizing death within days, and none who leave can re-enter.\nInquisition agents are likely to encounter these events only if they are hot on\nthe trail of a target who slips into Sanctuary as the zero hour approaches, which\nleaves the Storyteller with a few options. If they are allowed to enter Sanctuary, they\nfind themselves surrounded by a number of frightened and angry vampires. While\na powerful (and beatific) vampire known as Ferox prevents bloodshed on either side,\nbeing trapped with these creatures for their 40 nights of trial and temptation can\nmake for an incredibly intense roleplaying experience.\nAlternatively, the Inquisition might also surround the Sanctuary and wait to\nsee what happens, making sure that none of the creatures escape. This scenario is\nvery similar to what’s happening within, as the Inquisitors witness strange phenom-\nena but cannot leave or risk dereliction of duty.\n• Fair Is Foul: This scenario involves earth-shaking events for the vampiric\ncommunity that largely escape mortal notice until the very end. Even the most\nvigilant Inquisitors aren’t likely to piece together the entirety of what is happening\n— or be able to comprehend the enormity of what they are seeing if they do.\nThis scenario begins as any other assignment might, with the characters assigned\nto investigate some evidence of powerful vampiric activity. As Lilith’s personal vendetta\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n9\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER O\n O\n O\n O\n ON E\nN E\nN E\nN E\nN E\nbuilds to its conclusion, any Inquisitors dispatched to the city she chooses as her final\nbattleground are almost certain to find themselves dupes of one side or the other. Some\nof Caine’s faithful might exploit the animus placed on the “Lilith heresy” and leak\ninformation to members of the Society of Leopold in order to use the Inquisitors as a\nmeans of injuring or distracting her followers at a critical moment. At the same time, one\nor more of Lilith’s trusted followers might try to manipulate the Inquisition into attacking\na group of younger vampires who are seeking to defeat her plans. Staying alive requires\nmore than just a strong arm or steady Faith — it will force the Inquisitors to stay ahead\nof the ancient schemes that threaten to swallow them whole.\nIn the end, some of the most powerful vampires in existence destroy one\nanother, and for all its knowledge and tenacity, the Inquisition’s role in this event\nis mostly that of inadvertent witness or deluded pawn. Then again, perhaps both\nCaine and Lilith have forgotten the true power of God’s wrath, as made manifest in\nHis chosen agents…\n• Nightshade: When the existence of vampires becomes public knowledge, the\nmortal world reacts with expected outrage, fear, panic and — ultimately — violence.\nThe Inquisition, of course, has known for centuries that vampires and other minions\nof Hell exist. Now, it appears, the Inquisitors’ stance against the monsters of the\nnight is justified. But what do they do about it?\nAs global organizations and governments topple with the realization that they\nare not the ultimate authority on Earth, members of the Inquisition might find\nthemselves thrust into the limelight as the last defenders of the human race with the\nknowledge and the means to destroy the predatory vampires. For the Society of\nLeopold, the emergence of vampires into the public eye is a mixed blessing — and\npossibly more of a hindrance than a boon.\nThe results might be somewhat different from what the Inquisition bargained\nfor. As wholesale panic grips the world at the knowledge that the bloodsucking\nmonsters of ancient myth are not symbols of man’s monstrosity and parasitic nature\nbut concrete entities, members of the Society of Leopold suddenly find themselves\nbeset from all sides.\nPressure mounts for them to “do something” and protect humanity (as if they\nhadn’t been the self-appointed protectors all along). Meanwhile, internal pressures\nthreaten to divide the Society into those who want to wage an all-out war against\nthe vampires and a determined minority (the Sanbenito) who hope to find the latent\nhumanity within the undead and bring them to God and to a life of good works. And\nthen there’s the question of whether the Inquisition can truly defeat such awesome\ncreatures without help from their enemies once the true power of the Antediluvians\nbecomes known…\n• Crucible of God: Even more so than “Nightshade,” this scenario unveils the\nall-out war the Inquisition has been alternately fearing and preparing for since its\ncreation. The predictions of the end of the world come to pass, Gehenna takes on\napocalyptic dimensions, and the Ancients rise to claim entire continents as their\nown. These beings rend reality with their very existence, and their battles lay waste\nto miles in the blink of an eye. Quite simply, the Jyhad threatens not only all life on\nEarth but possibly the existence of the planet itself.\nHow does the Inquisition react to the most direct and literal manifestation of\nthe end of the world? After all, those with religious convictions have probably\nbelieved in the finite nature of God’s universe and its inevitable end. What happens\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n10\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nwhen they come face to face with their belief? Even secularly oriented members of\nthe Society of Leopold might realize that ancient vampires have the same potential\nto destroy the world as nuclear bombs or asteroid strikes.\nThe Society of Leopold could disintegrate altogether in the face of certain\ndestruction of everything in existence (or at least of “civilization as we know it”).\nSome run for cover as the world falls to pieces around them. Others simply commit\ntheir souls to God and go about their business or killing (or saving) vampires as usual.\nStill others strive desperately to prevent God’s wrath from raining down on the\nworld. Mass autos-da-fé and acts of religious fervor could become the order of the day.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E A A A A ARCANUM\nRCANUM\nRCANUM\nRCANUM\nRCANUM\nThe Arcanum has existed as an organization since the 1800s, but individuals\nwho possess a compelling interest in accumulating “secret” or occult knowledge have\nexisted throughout history. Many members of the Arcanum have made a study of\nvarious types of supernaturals, but no group intrigues them as much as those people\nwho call themselves mages and who focus their will through various symbols and\nrituals to alter the fabric of reality.\nThe Arcanum’s interest in all things occult has provided a wealth of information,\nall documented, some pieces contradictory to other pieces. What the Arcanum’s\nmembers do not possess is a strong urge to do something with what they know. In most\ncases, the end of the world takes the Arcanum by surprise, not because these scholars\ndon’t see it coming, but because they don’t know what to do about it when it gets there.\nArcanum members are more suited for live-action games using Laws of\nAscension. The following scenarios consider the role of Arcanum characters in end-\nof-the-world chronicles featuring the Traditions and the Technocracy.\n• Judgment: The Day of Judgment arises for mages, in which those who have followed\nthe call of their Avatars and worked toward Ascension receive their reward, while those\nwho have not done so suffer the penalties for failure. Spontaneous Awakenings of Sleepers\ncrowd the world with magic. A plague of insanity washes over the world.\nThe Arcanum itself might be rocked by the sudden Awakening of many of its\nmembers. After all, the predisposition of many Arcanum members toward all things\noccult makes them potential candidates for Awakening. Those who do Awaken\nmight also go mad as they suddenly become the things they have studied for so long.\nArcanum members have some idea of what constitutes an “Awakened” being\nsuch as a mage. Certainly they realize that the powers wielded by those who call\nthemselves mages have the ability to redefine reality to some extent. But knowing\nand doing are two different things.\nThose who don’t Awaken face the problem of how to deal with the strange events\noccurring in the world around them. The walls of reality break down as the world\napproaches the end point. While mages eventually realize what is going on, the\nArcanum might be slow in picking up the clues. If the scholars do realize what is in store\nfor the world, they realize their own tragic part in events — that of the onlooker.\nThe frustration suffered by most members of the Arcanum is that as they learn\nmore about the imminent apotheosis of mages, they also learn more about how little\nthey can do to affect it. The plight of the helpless is the bane of the Arcanum.\n• A Whimper, Not a Bang: In this scenario, only the mages participate in\nAscension. The world itself and the people without magical potential remain\nblissfully ignorant of the transcendence going on around them.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n11\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER O\n O\n O\n O\n ON E\nN E\nN E\nN E\nN E\nThe Arcanum might have a role in piecing together some of the disparate parts\nof the puzzle, realizing that some esoteric struggle is taking place just outside its ken.\nVery likely, they will find themselves in the position of the historical reconstructionist,\nwho deciphers the past from musty documents but cannot change what has already\nhappened. Arcanum members who are astute enough to discover what is going on\nwill also realize that they have no part in the mages’ Ascension. They can only stand\nby as mages and magic leave the world, feeling within them the chill of the\nknowledge that from here on in, only the inflexible laws of Nature remain.\nFor the Arcanum, all that is left is history.\n• The Revolution Will Be Televised: The Ascension War has historically\nconsisted of a series of battles between the Traditions and the Technocracy (and\nwithin each group) for control of reality and to determine the form that Ascension\nwill take. In a scenario in which the Technocracy wins the ultimate victory and\ncontrols Ascension, magic not only disappears, but science seizes the world in a\ndeath grip of technology that steadily recedes from anything remotely human.\nIn a scenario such as this, the Arcanum could, in fact, play a pivotal role, should\nit manage not to fall afoul of the Technocracy itself. In a world without magic, or one\nin which the Technocracy controls or exterminates all mages, the Arcanum could\nbe the only group left that remembers what magic was. These scholars — like the\nliving books encountered by the hero in Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 — might become\nrepositories of the history of magic. Whether they can do anything with the\nknowledge that they alone hold remains to be seen.\nThe Technocracy, if it knows of the Arcanum’s existence and purpose, might\ncome hunting the scholars after the mages have been neutralized, which could place\nthe Arcanum members in a situation unlike any they have ever encountered. All of\na sudden, they are the observed rather than the observer, and those who observe\nthem don’t just want to take notes.\n• The Earth Will Shake: In this most physical scenario, the emphasis is on\naction and finding solutions to a situation that might not be solvable. While the\nemphasis in a Laws of Ascension game falls naturally on the mage characters,\nArcanum characters could serve as resource persons, particularly if they have access\nto information kept secret from the public in order to avoid wholesale panic.\nArcanum members also possess all sorts of odd pockets of knowledge that might\nbe relevant to any solutions proposed by mages, should any of them think to consult\nsources within Sleeper society. Should averting disaster be impossible, then the\nArcanum might play a role in helping salvage as much of Earth’s population as possible.\nCharacters who belong to the Arcanum might take a more active role in events,\nnot only lending their expertise to mages who seek them out, but also acting as\nliaisons between the Sleeping masses and the magic-wielders who don’t want to “go\npublic” even at the end of the world.\nIn the end, however, the Arcanum might again realize that knowing everything\nis useless without the capacity or will to use the knowledge.\n• Hell on Earth: In a scenario in which neither the Technocracy nor the\nTraditions win but the infernalists steal the victory and define Ascension, the\nArcanum might, in fact, reach its highest potential. For as long as these scholars have\nexisted, they have remained in the background, quietly collecting information,\nsynthesizing it and acting as observers in the World of Darkness. Chances are, the\nNephandi know as little about them as other mages do.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n12\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nThe Arcanum, however, might know something about the infernal mages\nbased on their knowledge of ancient magic, black magic and demonic pacts. This\nknowledge can stand Arcanum scholars in good stead in learning how to avoid the\nEarth’s new masters or else provide information for pockets of rebellion (if any are\nleft). Whether the Arcanum steps in to fill a void in the absence of any other group\nof resisters depends largely on whether Arcanum characters elect to take action\nagainst the generally passive nature of the group as a whole.\nTWILIGHT\nWILIGHT\nWILIGHT\nWILIGHT\nWILIGHT A A A A AGENCIES\nGENCIES\nGENCIES\nGENCIES\nGENCIES\nA few special government agencies around the world are aware of the existence\nof the supernatural.  Known informally as “twilight agencies,” their job is to monitor\nsupernatural groups and crack down on any who break the law. For some of them, the\nfact that a werewolf or vampire exists is an illegal act. These groups, which include the\nSpecial Affairs Department (SAD) in the United States, Division Six in Great Britain\nand similar agencies all over the globe, usually figure most prominently as antagonists\nin chronicles using Laws of the Wild.  Because of their primary association with\nWerewolf: The Apocalypse, they come up in this section. Like any of the other mortal\nsecret societies, though, they can figure in any chronicle set in the World of Darkness.\nTwilight agencies have all the resources of their respective governments as well\nas the force of law behind them, but if things go wrong, most governments leave\ntwilight agents to fend for themselves. What they lack most often is true knowledge\nabout the creatures that they hunt. The End-Time scenarios could not provide them\nwith the enlightenment they so avidly desire. Should they discover all they need to\nknow, will their knowledge serve them when they must respond to the end of the\nworld? The following scenarios examine these clandestine agencies’ possible reac-\ntions to various endgames.\n• A Tribe Falls: When events launch a battle between the Garou Nation and\none of its own, the mortal world might experience this event as an increase in riots\nin rural areas — some of which spread into the cities. Savaged bodies turn up in the\ncountryside, farm communities lock their doors in fear, and a few call in the “feds”\nor whatever government group is most appropriate. While SAD might not become\ninvolved in this scenario unless the signs point to bizarre or occult-style crimes, the\nNSA will certainly intervene, trying to put two and two together and figure out\nwhat’s going on. If it does, it might not believe it.\nGroups that have had experience with werewolves will recognize certain\ntelltale signs, but most have never dealt with large-scale incidents. Response might\ninvolve tracking down the supernaturals and bringing massive weaponry against\nthem. As the battle escalates, so does the terror, and these twilight agencies will most\nlikely find themselves sorely outmatched.\n• The Last Battleground: For human governments and their twilight agents, this\nscenario offers the greatest frustration. Most of the action goes on in the spirit world,\nso mortals never see the actual “battles” or their aftermath in casualties. What does\ncome through, however, is an echo of the Umbral events in the real world. Odd events,\ninexplicable manifestations of Umbral beings (possibly mistaken for ghosts or demons)\nand a general sense of malaise and madness piques the interest of pattern-seekers in the\nNSA or conspiracy theorists in the CIA. Some conclude that some dreadful Armaged-\ndon scenario is about to take place, unaware that it is already going on.\nAs the world begin to fall apart around them due to the Final Battle, the physical\nworld takes on the appearance of the now-ravaged Umbra. When Earth’s wild places\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n13\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER O\n O\n O\n O\n ON E\nN E\nN E\nN E\nN E\nerode and disappear without any apparent cause, twilight agencies might realize too\nlate that the time for action has passed them by.\n• Weaver Ascendant: Twilight agencies know nothing to speak of about the\ndistinctions between Wyrm and Weaver. Therefore, in a scenario where the Weaver takes\nadvantage of the war between the Garou and the Wyrm, the NSA, SAD and most other\nspecial agencies over the globe will only notice the increasing unrest and the escalation of\nviolence. They might also notice certain forces attempting to stabilize the situation and\nprovide assistance to those groups in restoring order, thus aiding the Weaver unknowingly.\nUnfortunately, twilight agencies have much in common with the Weaver’s\nfollowers. They both stand for order and stability, shy away from change and tend\nto frown upon spontaneity. So even if an agent has a sudden inspiration as to what\nis really going on, she might run into so much red tape trying to get results that any\nactions she takes will most likely come too late.\nThose who play by the rules find themselves unable to break the rules, even\nwhen the fate of the world depends on it. Twilight agents could discover that their\nhands are tied if they attempt any unorthodox maneuvers, such as aiding the Garou\nin their battles. After all, who doesn’t want a safe, stable world where nothing out\nof the ordinary happens — ever?\n• Ragnarok: The most extreme scenario twilight agencies might face is one in\nwhich all the dire prophecies of the Apocalypse come true — literally. The mortal\nworld, including members of twilight agencies, will be too occupied in merely\nkeeping order and handling damage control as things fall apart around them.\nNatural disasters, outbreaks of wars, the breakdown of civilization, an invasion\nfrom “beyond” all seem to happen at once, throwing armies and civilian peacekeep-\ning forces headlong into the battle to hold a line that keeps disappearing out from\nunder their feet — even as the earth itself crumbles away. Nothing is hidden in this\nscenario, and the worst theories of the twilight agencies’ top conspiracy theorists\ncome to pass. Unfortunately, the sight of creatures that can only be called “monsters”\nbattling each other too much for the all-too-human minds of even the best-trained\nagents. Madness strikes down most mortals before the world comes to an end.\nEven the best of the twilight agencies descends into the final darkness, with\nthose they have pursued for so long.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E D\n D\n D\n D\n DAUNTAIN\nAUNTAIN\nAUNTAIN\nAUNTAIN\nAUNTAIN\nDauntain make interesting additions to a live-action End-Times chronicle based on\nThe Shining Host, if for no other reason than their unpredictability. The repressed\nchangelings spend their time either hunting other changelings or attempting to pretend to\nthemselves and the world that they are normal, mundane mortals. The end of the world puts\na stop to all that nonsense. The following possible scenarios can have drastic effects on any\nDauntain characters and can make for an intriguing sub-plot within the main chronicle.\n• A Crown of Shadows: A fae chronicle depicting victory for the Unseelie fae and\nthe Shadow Court likewise rouses the opposition of the Dauntain. Even though they\nespouse different techniques of gathering Glamour and do not fear Banality as much as\nSeelie changelings do, the Winter-aspected fae retain the ties to the Dreaming that elicit\nsuch opposition by the Dauntain. Those Autumn fae who actively hunt changelings find\ngame plentiful as battles rage in the Dreaming and in the mundane world.\nUnaware Dauntain might become confused and uneasy at the unrest all around\nthem as war among the fae takes a decidedly chaotic turn. Some might even find\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n14\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nthemselves used as weapons by the Unseelie against the opposition, using the\nDauntain’s high Banality to negate the powers of their Seelie foes (who may be too\n“honorable” to return the favor).\nDepending on the nature of the Unseelie rulers of the Winter Court, Dauntain\nmight find themselves either driven permanently into Banality, thus achieving their\nown personal goal of denial of their nature, or else thrown into their fae natures by\na new kind of dark Glamour. In some instances, the Winter Court might realize that\nthe Dauntain pose a danger and hunt them down remorselessly.\n• Gods and Monsters: Instead of occurring in the background, the battles\nbetween the Summer and Winter fae takes center stage as god-like creatures emerge\nfrom the Dreaming to oppose each other in full view of the mortal world. This sudden\nemergence of so many fae, perhaps including the legendary Tuatha de Danaan and\ntheir Fomorian enemies — as well as mythical creatures such as dragons and unicorns\n— causes a wash of Glamour to sweep over the world, bursting the barriers between\nthe Dreaming and the physical plane.\nImmune to the sleep effects of the Transformation, as are any people with fae\nblood, the Dauntain face what easily seems like their worst nightmares made real.\nThe shock of this awareness might drive some Dauntain insane, or the infusion of\nGlamour might spark a re-awakening of their true faerie selves. Others finally\nsurrender themselves to the truth and join in the fray on one side or another, casting\ntheir lot with the children of the Dreaming.\n• Starlight Exodus: Dauntain in this scenario face the choice of returning to Arcadia\nor remaining behind to face cold Banality. It is not as easy a decision for them as it sounds,\nhowever. Certainly, some decide to renounce their fae ties forever and stay, becoming mere\nmortals. They might have to fight off fae “rescuers” who are determined to save them from\ndestruction. Others find their fae soul struggling to avoid eternal destruction, compelling\nthem to join with the beings they despise in order to escape this world.\nSome Dauntain may even experience a true “conversion” and renounce their\nhatred for the fae. Faced with the reality of their natures, these individuals try to\nreturn to Arcadia. Their excessive Banality, however, might either prevent them\nfrom doing so, thus condemning them to a life of regret and despair, or they might\nhave to undergo a rigorous purging of Banality from their bodies and spirits before\nthey can safely enter the heart of the Dreaming.\n• Pick Your Poison: A scenario that ends up giving the Dauntain what they\nmost desire — freedom from the burden of their faerie natures — involves the final\nseparation between the Dreaming and the physical world in the wake of some\nterrible announcement. As human creativity, which draws its sustenance from the\nability to touch the world of dreams, fades away, the world stagnates and becomes\nutterly mundane. The Dauntain can at last rejoice in their liberation from the faerie\ncurse… if they even remember that they were once cursed.\nIn the brave, gray post-Dreaming world, the Dauntain can sink into the morass\nof dull sameness that they have apparently desired all along. Best of all, they will\nnever know that they were ever anything other than “normal.”\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E O\n O O\n O\n ORPHIC\nRPHIC\nRPHIC\nRPHIC\nRPHIC C C C C CIRCLE\nIRCLE\nIRCLE\nIRCLE\nIRCLE\nThis group of occultists once served the darker powers of the Underworld or\nShadowlands in return for power.

Instead, the\nentities they called forth massacred the Orphic leadership and most of the members,\nleaving behind a remnant of cowed, fearful former members… and a raging storm in\nthe land of the dead.\nWhere do the remnants of the Orphic Circle fit in an End-Times chronicle? Most\nappropriate for LARP stories involving either Oblivion, Laws of the Hunt or Laws of\nthe Reckoning, Orphics have a lot of strikes against them. Hunted by their own kind,\nthey trust few people. They await death at the hands of either the living or the dead.\nSome might view the end of the world as a great relief. Not only do they finally\nface their ultimate fate, they get to take the rest of the world with them! Others might\nseek to prevent the utter destruction of the world or of modern civilization in an\nattempt to atone for their past misdeeds. Some might attempt to save their souls\nthrough a religious conversion, turning against anyone with supernatural abilities\nand becoming a more zealous “hunter” than many hunters consider themselves to be.\nOthers might be driven to join with the forces of chaos and destruction as\nminions of the Wyrm, demons from the infernal regions, powerful vampires or\nFomorians from the Deep Dreaming in order to save themselves. They might be\nsorely disappointed in the results, having traded one form of hell for another.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E B\n B B\n B BENANDANTI\nENANDANTI\nENANDANTI\nENANDANTI\nENANDANTI\nThese rare and unusual humans have the ability to leave their bodies and enter\nthe Shadowlands. Born with a caul and trained by other Benandanti, they usually\nlabor in the other world to accomplish one of two goals. Some seek to guide the spirits\nof the dead that are still attached to the material world to their appropriate afterlife,\nsmoothing their passage and convincing them that they need not hold onto their old\nlife. Others see ghosts as spirits who are avoiding their just punishments by lingering\nnear Earth. The goal of these Benandanti is to hasten the spirits’ journey to “hell.”\nSince the collapse of Shadowlands society, the Benandanti have been at loose ends,\nunsure of their purpose. Some try to locate spirits of the dead that have fled to the material\nworld, either through possession of humans or by the animation of fresh corpses.\nIn an end-of-the-world scenario, Benandanti might place themselves in the\nforefront of the fight between the living and the dead, trying to prevent the dead\nfrom taking over the world of the living. But these individuals are few and far\nbetween, and should they lose any of the talismans that give them their powers, they\nhave only their mortal skills left (though they are still sensitive to the presence of\nthe supernatural).\nLike members of the Arcanum, the Benandanti might be aware of what is going\non in an endgame scenario long before other characters are. Unlike the Arcanum,\nthey are more willing to place themselves at risk to accomplish whatever serves as\ntheir goal, since they have been trained for this purpose.

Every vampire has heard rumors and legends about this time of\nreckoning, when the Antediluvians will rise and Caine will return to pass judgment\nupon them all.\nThe long darkness of the vampire is finally ending. The Final Nights draw to a\nclose, and the prophesized end in The Book of Nod has begun scourging the world.\nThe countries of the world will be rendered broken and helpless, as the Jyhad spills\nover from the land of night into the world of mortals.\nThis chapter details how to bring the Final Nights to a fitting conclusion in your\ngame, first by introducing some new story elements and game mechanics that you\ncan apply to help simulate the desperate nature of the Kindred at Gehenna’s\napproach, then by addressing some common vampiric concerns a Storyteller might\nhave when preparing her players for the End Times.\nThis chapter concludes with four different End-Time scenarios you may choose to\nimplement for your troupe, ranging from highly personalized stories of redemption to\ntales of great battles and terrible disasters. As always, you may choose to modify them.\nNEW MECHANICS\nThis section details some of the game mechanics that might prove helpful in\ncreating a properly desperate and intriguing atmosphere for Gehenna. Indeed, a few\nscenarios assume the use of some of these elements (particularly the Withering) as\npart of their makeup, while others leave it more open-ended.\nTHE WITHERING\nThere are many possibilities in regard to how the coming of Gehenna physically\neffects vampires across the globe. As with all things, the ultimate authority of what\nhappens during the Final Nights is the Storyteller. No player can dictate how his\ncharacter should be affected (but some might try anyway). The chapters offer their\nown individuals versions of how the end weighs upon the Blood of Caine. As a\ngeneral reference however, here is one version of what could happen during this\ntumultuous time.\nCHAPTER TWO:\nGEHENNA\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n18\nThe Withering begins so subtly at first that no one notices. It starts with the\nlowest-generation Cainites and works its way down. The first month of the Withering\naffects only the Third Generation. The second month, the Curse’s decline affects the\nFourth Generation. The third month, the Fifth Generation feels its effects, and so on.\nBy the time this effect reaches many of the characters in your story, they might already\nhave some horrible clue as to what is in store for them. These are mostly suggestions,\nfeel free to modify them as you see fit. This Withering has these effects:\n• Each month that a Cainite suffers the Withering, she loses access to her most\nadvanced Discipline powers. In case of a tie between Discipline levels, the Story-\nteller picks one at random.\n• All vampires affected by the Withering suffer the Thin Blood Flaw (see Laws\nof the Night, p. 115).\n• Blood bonds and Vinculi have a 50% chance each month of breaking, no\nmatter how strongly they are reinforced. Once broken, a bond cannot be reestab-\nlished despite any subsequent attempts to do so.\n• Each time the character deliberately calls on her Blood or activates a\nDiscipline, the player immediately must engage in a pair of Simple Tests. If the player\nfails both tests, the desired result does not take place and the Blood Trait is wasted.\nWhat’s more, the character loses another of her highest-ranked Discipline powers\nand any further attempt that night to expend vitae also requires spending a\nWillpower Trait. If the character fails a second time to activate a Discipline or\nexpend vitae effectively, she cannot use Disciplines or expend vitae at all for the rest\nof the night. This bout of weakness, which Kindred feel as a physical ache, does not\naffect the vitae expended to wake up each night.\n• Torpor does not slow the Withering at all.\nDiablerie\nIn these frantic final hours, many will make up for their lost power by attempting\nto take it from others. Like sharks tasting blood in the water, the feeding frenzy is\nabout to begin in full. In the event that the Withering has begun, diablerizing\nanother Cainite temporarily counters the Withering in the following manner.\n• The Kindred loses the Thin Blood Flaw.\n• The character regains his lost Disciplines, to the limit set by the victim’s\ngeneration. Therefore, an elder who wants to regain high-level Discipline powers\nmust devour another Cainite of suitably low generation.\n• Discipline activation and blood expenditure no longer spontaneously fails.\n• The length of the palliation depends on the victim’s age. It is recommended\nthat the shorter length of time on the following table be assigned. A game with\nmultiple sessions in a month should use the session figure, for instance, while one\nwith sessions spaced farther apart can use the real-time measurement:\nNew Childe*\n1 session/3 nights\nNeonate\n1 session/1 week\nAncilla\n2 sessions/2 weeks\nElder\n2 sessions/3 weeks\nMethuselah or Antediluvian\n4 sessions/1 month\n* Less than five years a Cainite.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n19\nCHAPTER TWO\nProgression of the Withering\nAfter the Antediluvians rise, the Withering becomes more severe. The\nchances for any Discipline or vitae use to fail increases to just one failure on the\nSimple Tests. (Willpower Traits may be spent for a retest, at the Storyteller’s\ndiscretion.) By the climax of Gehenna — assuming that any characters survive\nthat long — any use of Cainite powers is chancy at best, thus supplying a great\ntemptation to commit diablerie.\nTHE BLOOD THINS\nAs the Blood weakens, its preservative properties do as well, and the lines\nbetween modern and ancient clans blur. Clan disadvantages magnify as the curses\nupon the clan founders are no longer held at bay by the greater Curse of Caine. These\nconsequences are recommended for the major clans. (The bloodlines and other clans\ncan be slightly less or more severe as their parent clan, depending on your story.) It\nis important to take the time to impress these weaknesses upon each of the\ncharacters, it will be their first clue that the end has come.\n• Assamites — Slowly, Assamites find themselves unable to feed on anything\nbut vampire blood. As Gehenna progresses, they soon find that they can gain\nsustenance from blood only if they commit diablerie after feeding.\n• Brujah — Strange reports of clan members disappearing without a trace\ncirculate throughout the clan with increasing frequency. As Gehenna progresses, all\nclan members gain the Flaw: Lunacy.\n• Gangrel — The Clan of Beasts finds itself becoming more and more\nanimalistic with the passage of time, sometimes even shifting into animal form\nwithout consciously choosing to do so.\n• Giovanni — The Necromancers grow more pale and corpselike than even\nother vampires, coming to resemble the very clan they usurped. (Incidentally, the\nHarbingers of Skulls start to look and smell like the Samedi, and the Samedi are all\nbut falling apart.) The Restless Dead attack them at every turn. Necromancy —\nthough it still works — becomes perilous to use at best.\n• Lasombra — All Lasombra face difficulties in controlling their Obtenebration.\nShadows rage out of control, attacking their creators or — in extreme cases —\nripping holes in the fabric of reality, directly into the Abyss itself.\n• Malkavians — No longer able to contain the madness within them,\nMalkavians find themselves unleashing it upon the world. Bouts of prophesy become\nincreasingly frequent, and Dementation might activate without conscious desire. As\nthe end approaches, the physical world itself might even be warped by the Discipline\nin minor but telling ways.\n• Nosferatu — The Discipline of Obfuscate begins to fail the Nosferatu at the\nmost inopportune times. As Gehenna progresses, Mask of a Thousand Faces fails\nautomatically, and Nosferatu slowly grow even more repulsive than normal.\n• Ravnos — The Beast intensifies, becoming a literal voice in the character’s\near impelling him to evil acts. The voice grows louder throughout Gehenna, until\nby the end, each Ravnos has a wicked nature that takes on a whispering life of its own.\nNear the end, a Chimerstry duplicate might even appear.\n• Setites — The Snakes come to resemble their clan’s epithet. Any time one\nuses Serpentis, the change brought on by it could become permanent. As Set fails to\nrise, faith in him dwindles among the clan.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n20\n• Toreador — The clan of Degenerates becomes more and more easily addicted\nto excesses. The difficulty of resisting the descent into debauchery increases as\nGehenna progresses.\n• Tremere — In a true display of irony, each Tremere develops a third eye. The\neye first opens at a time of trauma or stress and allows its bearer to see things even\nAuspex does not normally reveal. As Gehenna progresses, some Tremere develop the\nnew Tzimisce clan disadvantage as well.\n• Tzimisce — The Fiends can no longer reliably control their Vicissitude,\ncausing wild aberrations in both themselves and others. Some demonstrate the\nability to use the Discipline without touch, but even they have reduced control of\nthe fine points of it. As the end comes, many Tzimisce lose the ability to hold the\nsame shape for even a short period of time.\n• Ventrue — In a final ironic twist, the Clan of Kings’ notorious fondness for blood\nof a certain caliber degenerates into a preference for each other’s blood — exclusively.\nVentrue become unable to gain sustenance on anything but the blood of other Ventrue.\nSEVERED BLOODLINES\nWhen a clan’s Antediluvian founder meets Final Death, a terrible shock wave\nresonates through the surviving descendants, causing them to erupt in fits of terrible\nfratricidal madness and diablerie. The events surrounding the death of the Ravnos\nAntediluvian during the Week of Nightmares in 1999 — detailed for tabletop in\nTime of Thin Blood and live-action in the Laws of the Night Storytellers Guide,\np. 77-97 — were an early warning of what the Kindred can expect. As more Ancients\nare destroyed during the great battles of Gehenna, this violence will only become\nmore frequent.\nHere are some guidelines for what happens to members of a clan after their\nfounder meets Final Death. Storytellers should feel free to adjust these guidelines as\nthey see fit for their scenario, but in no event should the death of an Antediluvian\npass by without great repercussions for the clan.\n• In the nights surrounding death of the Antediluvian, all members of the clan\nreceive the Flaw: Nightmares, and are one Trait down on all Mental and Social\nChallenges due to the constant distraction of the images from their dreams. This\neffect increases to a one-Trait penalty as circumstances become truly severe.\n• Clan members might spontaneously exhibit erratic surges of up to three additional\nlevels of one clan Discipline — generally the clan’s proprietary Discipline such as Vicissitude\nor Protean, or the most relevant Discipline to the founder’s demise if no unique Discipline\nexists. Generation limits are ignored, as it is the power of the Antediluvian at work, though\nthis power may wax and wane in keeping with the final struggle of the Ancient.\n• Clan members do not naturally regain Willpower for the period beginning\nseveral days before their founder’s destruction and continuing until after the last of\nthe fratricidal madness has passed.\n• For at least three nights following the destruction of the founder, clan members\nare locked in near-constant frenzy, in which they instinctively seek out fellow clan\nmembers and attempt to diablerize them. A Self-Control/Instinct Challenge is required\nto resist these urges, with a difficulty determined by the vampire’s generation.\nVampires of the Twelfth Generation test against two Traits. Vampires of the Eleventh\nthrough Eighth Generation against three Traits. Seventh or lower generation vam-\npires test against four Traits. Vampires of the highest generations — 15th through 13th\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n21\nCHAPTER TWO\n— are immune to this condition due to their thin blood, though clan members of lower\ngeneration will still perceive them as targets and attempt to destroy them on sight. This\nfrenzy test must be made each night upon awakening, or any time another clan member\nis encountered. No form of magical or mundane disguise can block this thirst, as Blood\ncalls to Blood automatically. Failure means that a victim is compelled to seek out the\nnearest clan member and attempt to diablerize him, regardless of his current Path, past\nfriendship with the target or any other personal desires.\n• At the Storyteller’s discretion, Willpower Traits may be spent to stave off\nfratricidal frenzy for a scene, but a number of Traits equal to the difficulty of the Self-\nControl/Instinct Challenge is required, making it extremely costly indeed.\n• Clan members also display unusual behaviors and memories in keeping with\nthe nature of their founder — including abrupt Nature shifts, sudden outbursts in\nancient languages and suddenly recalling places or people never seen before. These\noddities are mostly roleplaying concerns that do not permanently alter a character’s\nTraits, but Storytellers are encouraged to give characters a number of such changes\nto convey the impact of what has occurred.\nSTORYTELLING\nThis section covers a number of topics and ideas that Storytellers might find\ninstructive to address as they prepare to unleash Gehenna.\nTELLTALE SIGNS\nThe very nature of its origin story — God cursing Caine for committing the first\nmurder — gives Masquerade a rather Biblical frame of reference, especially when it\ncomes to something like the End Times. Even if the chronicle has moved away from\nthe Caine story as literal truth, Storytellers are encouraged to look through the Book\nof Revelation or other apocalyptic religious texts for inspiration for events during\ntheir Gehenna scenarios. What follows is a brief listing of some options suitable for\nany scenario that Storytellers can employ for additional dramatic impact.\nThe Ground Shakes\nMany countries around the world experience a surge of minor earthquakes. This\nactivity can be due to something as direct as an Antediluvian rising in the vicinity, or\nsimply something indicative of the uneasy state of the world in general. From a thematic\npoint of view, earthquakes remind people that they are ever at the mercy of larger forces,\nso they are excellent tools for underscoring scenarios involving direct confrontation with\nthe Ancients. Alternatively, minor quakes can be an omen of unrest, an indication that\nsomething is not quite right even if the players can’t see it yet.\nBlood of the Earth\nAcross the globe, active volcanoes erupt with startlingly frequency and even inactive\nvolcanoes begin to stir. Scientists at first say it is probably due to the unprecedented shifting\nof tectonic forces below the earth’s crust, but the players’ characters will quickly come to\nrealize the truth. Some smaller volcanoes actually erupt in urban areas, and geysers of\nscalding steam spring up all over. Like earthquakes, volcanoes illustrate that something\nwithin the earth isn’t right — but it’s something ready to explode in fury and destruction\nas opposed to remaining an anonymous and invisible force in the background.\nA Pestilence upon the Land\nDisease, the expression of an unclean species made manifest on its physical form,\nis another excellent way of highlighting the corruption that has overtaken the world.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n22\nSpringing up in the wake of certain Ancients awakening, a strange epidemic spreads\naround rest of the world. The symptoms are diluted blood and the effects that it brings\nwith it: nausea, mild hallucinations, discolored skin and the occasional outbreak of\nbleeding lesions. No one has seen anything like this, and though it doesn’t seem to be\nlethal (at least for now), it’s highly contagious, spreading through blood and other\nsecretions. In truly extreme scenarios, it might even come to affect the Kindred.\nBrother Against Brother\nWith Gehenna being heralded by nightmares and earthquakes, it doesn’t take\nmuch more for the kine to finally lash out in fear. This hometown threat is something\nthat the players’ characters could have to deal with directly. Their havens might come\nunder fire, their herd might be attacked, or their contacts and allies might be hurt or killed\noutright in the chaos. With the characters resources and influence already stretched thin,\nwhat happens when riots start breaking out in the setting where your game takes place?\nDo the characters take advantage of the carnage to settle scores, or do they pull together\nin mutual defense until the threat passes? Do the other sects and rival clans seek to take\nadvantage of the distress to carve a piece of your characters’ territories?\nMadness, Madness Everywhere\nEven more than damage to the body, many people fear damage to the mind. A\nwound can be treated, a lost limb replaced, but madness? Fear of losing oneself and\nbecoming a stranger both within and without strikes something deep in everyone. As\nGehenna approaches, this threat becomes more urgent than ever. The mortal population\nTHE FACES OF THE ANCIENTS\nMany scenarios call for the Antediluvians or similarly powerful entities\nlike Caine and Lilith to appear at one point or another. It’s a rather formidable\ntask to attempt to accurately portray creatures that lived and breathed in a\ntime before mankind recorded its own history. So how do you and your staff\nof Narrators create the feeling that these characters are in fact the Ancients\nraised from their slumber?\nOne good piece of advice is to avoid direct in-character exchanges between\nthe players’ characters and the Ancients altogether. No matter how well you\nwork to display this level of raw ancient power wrapped into a human-shaped\nform, it’s very possible that you might just accidentally end up sounding more\nlike a bad, overblown imitation of an action movie villain. This isn’t meant as\nan underestimation of your ability as a Storyteller or as a roleplayer; rather, it’s\na suggestion that it might be best to keep the “camera” off the Ancients.\nConsider this: Confronting such powerful entities directly could shatter the\nmind of a lesser creature, so don’t “show” them as much as you intimate their\nhideous (or nigh-divine) presences. The character might witness only the\naftermath of their terrible wake, or simply arrive after the Ancient has already\ndeparted. Characters may even experience “lost time,” wherein they find them-\nselves far from where they remember being a moment before the Ancient passed\nby, with terrible images floating in their heads like memories of a bad dream. Their\nminds, being attached to a rational existence, just couldn’t comprehend the\npresence of these creatures, so they deleted the horrible experience completely.\n(Yet some part in the dark recesses of their minds will always remember the terrible\nbeauty and indescribable horror of what they laid eyes upon.)\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n23\nCHAPTER TWO\nbegins to fall victim to an inexplicable epidemic of spontaneous insanity. People begin\ngibbering in tongues, committing horrible acts of violence with no reason, and devolving\ninto mindless savagery. Some suspect it’s just a result of the stress of the times, while the\nKindred whisper that perhaps this is the mad god Malkav manifesting at last. His progeny\nare silent on the subject, but some take this as the silence before the storm.\nCHARACTER ELEMENTS\nDon’t lose sight of the fact that between disasters and catastrophic events, the\ncharacters are still the main focus of your story. The following sections offer some\nadvice on areas Storytellers might wish to cover with the characters in order to coax\nthe maximum dramatic impact out of Gehenna.\nDIGGING IN THE DIRT\nEvery vampire was once a mortal. A likely theme to explore is a matter of taking\ncharacters back to their roots. In the face of Gehenna, perhaps one of the best ways to voice\nits impact is to show the characters, for all their powers and abilities, exactly what it is they\nhave lost in becoming vampires. The best way to point something out is to show it in\ncontrast to its opposite. If you want to focus on the drama of the end of vampire society,\ntouch upon the lost humanity of the characters. Without being too heavy-handed in your\napproach, involve them in the human aspect of the world around them. Remind them of\nthe good things that they might have lost in their transition into Kindred.\nReview each player’s history and see what avenues can be taken. If the typically\ngruff Brujah began his life in the humble part of town, maybe something comes along\nto remind him of his meager beginnings, such as a chance meeting with an old family\nfriend (to remind him of his humanity), or running into the one friendly girl from\nelementary school who is now all grown up (showing the character the path not\ntaken). These encounters don’t have to be obvious digs to elicit emotion from the\ncharacter. Rather they should be unexpected views from broken reflections. By\npointing out how far a character has developed during the course of a story, you let\nthe player see the contrast to what they have ultimately become. This introspection\nmight bring about a depth of roleplaying never before seen in your game, and this is\njust right for a story that is about to come to its potentially dramatic conclusion.\nANGELS AND DEMONS\nWhile the topic of vampire redemption is often talked about in the dark corners of\nElysium, it is rarely sought. Too often the easy path of power that comes with nurturing\ninhuman behavior wins out. During the trials of surviving from night to night in vampire\nsociety, possessing a human heart might seem like a liability. This story you are conducting,\nhowever, doesn’t take place on just another night on the Endless Road — this is a story\nabout the end. In the face of that, perhaps some of the most monstrous vampires attempt\nto rouse some chance of redemption in the eyes of higher powers. A character may finally\nbe forced to ask that burning question, am I truly going to be damned?\nAs Gehenna unfolds, the characters may very well be faced with a no-win situation\n(or at least one they perceive as such). Faced with such terminal knowledge, they might seek\nto make amends and reach for that vain hope that perhaps there is something worth saving\nwithin them. This is a difficult theme to explore given its potentially morbid sensibility. It\ncould be the most rewarding high road to take in the chaos of the end, however.\nUltimately salvation is yours as the Storyteller to define. If this means that the\ncharacters require a certain amount of Humanity before the final curtain draws close\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n24\nin order to achieve a hope of redemption, so be it. Other Storytellers might prefer\nto judge it for themselves based on the reactions of the characters, or perhaps polling\ntheir Narrators, as opposed to relying on Traits to make the decision for them.\nWhatever it is, however, it should not come easily. Some of the noblest figures only\nearned redemption posthumously, after all.\nLAWYERS, GUNS AND MONEY\nChances are good that more than a few of your characters have devoted a lot of time\nand energy to becoming true lords of the night, with amassed networks of Influences,\nAllies, Resources, Contacts and other Traits that would make Washington power brokers\nblush. Therefore, it can be tempting as Gehenna’s chaos unfolds to throw these\ncharacters for a loop by destroying all the temporal power they have carefully amassed,\nforcing them to rely on only their own powers and aptitudes. Be careful with such\nimpulses, however. Your players have likely spent a long time accumulating their various\nInfluences and other Backgrounds. While it’s only natural that they should expect some\nproblems as the world slides into disorder, making them feel as though all their time and\nplanning has been spent for nothing is never a good idea. Especially in such a political,\nintrigue-oriented game as Masquerade, these expenditures are just as valid as spending\nExperience on Disciplines, Attributes or Abilities. As a Storyteller, you should honor\nthat fact with equal consideration during your climactic scenario.\nRather than simply destroying the city’s networks of power and Influence outright,\nthen, present those characters who are invested in them with crises that threaten to take\naway what they’ve fought so hard to obtain. Give them a chance to maintain at least some\nof their grip with some quick thinking and slick manipulation. Heck, they might even\nbe able to expand their powers if they’re really clever. (In the chaos surrounding\nGehenna, who’s going to worry about someone expanding territory behind the scenes?)\nLikewise, as the inevitable threats brought on by Gehenna come their way, give them\nchallenges they can help meet with their mortal connections and resources. Even if their\nvast power is slipping from their grip, they should feel as though they have some chance\nto fight what’s coming, or at least salvage what they can before it’s all over.\nIndeed, it’s a good idea in general to take a good look at your players’ character\nsheets, especially if you haven’t done so in a while. While Traits alone rarely tell the\nwhole story, they might offer a good insight into where to put the focus of upcoming\nevents. Take careful note of the Natures of the characters, as well as their most potent\nDisciplines and Abilities and “plot-oriented” Flaws such as Enemy, Hunted or Dark\nSecret. Conversely, learning which Traits are commonly lacking in your group can\nbe just as helpful. If none of the characters in your setting have any interest in the\noccult, a plot involving gaining a wealth of information on the secrets of the Inconnu\nmight not interest them. Doing so allows you not only to determine what your\nplayers will be interested in, but also where their weak points are — two elements\nthat should never be underestimated as you plan for the Gehenna they deserve.\nBRACING FOR IMPACT\nLast but not least, it’s always been a staple of Kindred society that the end was\ncoming. Camarilla Kindred chose to deny its very existence, while the Sabbat and\nothers have based their entire belief system behind it. Some vampires have been\nwaiting patiently for this time to make their final bid for power amidst the chaos to\ncome. At one time or another, most vampires have posed their own thoughts on\nwhat the shape of Gehenna would be.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n25\nCHAPTER TWO\nMost likely no one side has ever gotten the right of it — prophecy is never an\nexact science. How these different organizations and societies play a role in this final\nstory should reflect the tone and scope of what you have already established. Will\nthe characters be consumed in the final bloody revolution of the anarchs? Will the\nSabbat actually find themselves a match for the Ancients, or will they be proven\ndeluded fools who never really understood the enemy they faced? Will the Camarilla\nhold together once it can no longer deny the facts? Who thought ahead, and who\ngets caught with their guard down? Why?\nOnce you decide the larger ramifications of these questions, you can scale down\nhow they will impact your setting and your characters directly.\nFAIR IS FOUL\nShe has faced nothing but betrayal from those who claimed only to love her,\ncurses from those who once blessed her and obstacles at every turn. Those who\nbetrayed her, took it upon themselves time and again to destroy what she had\ncreated. Her greatest adversary is beyond reach, but his works are not. She has the\nintellect of a goddess, the power of the most potent supernatural creatures you can\ndream of and several millennia to develop the perfect plan of revenge. This is the\nsituation in which Lilith finds herself when Gehenna finally begins.\nThis is the story of the Jyhad as told from the sympathies of one of its oldest and\nmost passionate players, the Dark Mother herself.\nLilith is well aware of the coming of Gehenna. She’s had eons to refine her\nprophetic powers, and she has had time to gather her allies and implement her plan\nfor drawing Caine into the open in order to destroy him. If you so chose, Lilith’s plan\ncan begin in the same city your characters dwell in. You can do so for any number\nof reasons — location, useful industries, particularly important vampires in the area\nor whatever else. Whatever the reason, don’t short change your game or players by\n“just deciding” the end takes place in the characters’ hometown. Make sure it’s the\nreason that makes the most sense for your chronicle. It will help to personalize this\nfinal story for your players and draw them farther into it.\nSUPPORTING CAST\nAlthough Lilith is the driving force behind this story, her allies and enemies\nform the basis for a rich and multifaceted plot. You might wish to employ a larger\nNarrator staff if you wish to have all of these characters take center stage in your story.\nThe alternative is to simply never have all of the side-characters portrayed at once\nTHE DARK MOTHER\nIt is suggested that Storytellers avoid precisely defining Lilith, not to mention\nher powers and capabilities. She is a far more powerful and engaging character if\nshe remains mysterious. Consider this: Lilith has had longer than nearly anyone\nelse, even Caine, to develop personalized approaches to and applications of her\nabilities. Even if she is recognizably one type of supernatural creature or another,\nthe way her powers manifest should always be unique, personal and memorable.\nUltimately, Lilith can be whatever you want her to be, but don’t feel that\nyou need to pin her down to a single archetype.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n26\nand to switch off from time to time. You might want to work out a simple system for\nidentifying each character to your players, such as a certain piece of distinct\ncostuming or jewelry to represent who you are at a given time.\nLUCIFER, THE MORNINGSTAR\nIn this story, Lucifer fell because he allowed Lilith back into the Garden of\nEden. Don’t feel a need to remold your chronicle to conform to the established canon\nof what Lucifer has been up. Simply rework Lucifer so that he fits with the story you\nwant to tell, if you choose to use him at all. As a result, their relationship now has\nmany possibilities. They might have returned to their former roles as lovers,\nremained indifferent to each other or become bitter enemies.\nLYLA, THE DAUGHTER\nLilith’s most important ally, at least as far as the characters’ relationship to her is\nconcerned, will most likely be Lyla, her adopted daughter. Since meeting her “mother” the\nfirst time, Lyla has experienced frequent visions of disturbing clarity, some of which she has\nseen come true. She sometimes also suffers lapses during which she speaks in tongues and\nutters words of prophecy, but afterward she retains no memory of having done so. What Lyla\ndoes not know is that although the trances and visions are real, Lilith can use the blood\nconnection between herself and Lyla to control them (and in doing so, control Lyla) when\nshe chooses. Lilith is likewise unaware that when she is not watching Lyla, the girl’s visions\nand trances often concern the Dark Mother’s plans and actions.\nAs a frightened young girl with powers she barely understands, Lyla is intended\nmostly as a Storyteller plot device. If the characters show her any form of kindness,\nshe will respond well to them. She is a survivor, however, and she will run if things\nturn against her. If Lyla takes an important role in your game, you might want to\nassign this role to a single trusted Narrator or cast member who is well acquainted\nwith the story, so that her gift of prophesy can be used to move the characters along\neffectively if things go astray.\nTHE APOSTATES\nLyla is left to survive on her own in the desolate city streets, with only seven\n“bums” to watch over her, but naturally, these derelicts are far from what they appear\nto be. They are students of the Dark Mother who are hiding their true nature from\nLyla. The “official” number of Antediluvians is 13, but various sources make\nreference to more. For this story, 20 Antediluvians remain. Thirteen of them created\nthe various known vampire clans, but the other seven are in service to Lilith instead.\nTHE SEVEN\nEickos — The strange being that calls itself Eickos is counted among the\nApostates solely because Lilith has never been able to discern what it wants, who it\nis or how to get rid of it. Eickos is beautiful, known for her powers of song, persuasion\nand insight. In truth, Eickos’ natural form is horribly repulsive, something far older\nand more sinister than any of the Apostates (or Lilith) imagine.\nErinye — Erinye is the inspiration for such creatures as the Furies of Ancient\nGreek mythology. Of all the Apostates, Erinye has the most in common with Lilith,\nin that she possesses both a wicked temper and an indomitable will.\nIkopabe — The most primal of the Apostates, even surpassing Erinye in his\nbestial nature, Ikopabe is a master shapeshifter and seldom takes a face twice, though\nhis eyes always remain yellow and catlike.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n27\nCHAPTER TWO\nIlyes — Cold and passionless, Ilyes harbors a great hatred for all of the line of\nBrujah, and he searches even now for Troile, hunting down and destroying her\ntreacherous “Brujah” progeny whenever he encounters them.\nLucian — Intelligent, confident, charismatic and preternaturally attractive,\nLucian is at once the natural leader of the group, though Lilith does not hold him\nin any particular esteem, as he represents all she hates about men.\nMalakai — Afflicted with the same madness as her twin brother, Malkav, her\nmadness has consumed her, driving her to untold depths of paranoia, despair and, at\ntimes, violence. Even Lilith holds a place in her unloving heart for Malakai.\nMekhet — Formerly a great court magician in a now-forgotten proto-Egyptian\nculture, Mekhet has used his nearly limitless years of existence to become the\nforemost blood magician on the planet.\nENEMIES\nBy now, it should be apparent that Lilith has the cards stacked in her favor when\nGehenna begins. That being said, Caine does still have a few potential allies who\nmight aid him as the story plays out. For the most part, even these “allies” may still\nwish to see Caine die, just not by the hand of Lilith or one of her minions.\nCaine\nCaine has probably spent a good deal of time in torpor, lamenting what he feels\nis an unjust state of affairs. When active, he likely experiences difficulty adjusting\nto the new climate of the world before sinking into torpor once more. The most\nimportant thing to remember about Caine, whatever he has done for the past several\nmillennia, is that he remains a man consumed by pride.\nWere he simply to feel regret for his actions — to wish he hadn’t killed his brother\nout of jealousy all those years ago — the Curse of Caine would lift, and he might ascend\nto Heaven right then and there. Caine’s tragedy is that after all the long years of\nsuffering, he remains unable to see that he was wrong. His true curse is of a self-inflicted\nvariety. His relationship with Lilith falls under the same purview. Unable to admit his\nmistakes, he would rather destroy her than face up to the possibility that he was wrong.\nSaulot\nIf any Antediluvian still retains even a shred of loyalty to Caine, Saulot is the\none. Saulot still understands the necessity of Caine’s destruction, but he wishes to\nbring it about in a certain way. Since Saulot has always been one of the more\nmystically inclined Antediluvians, chances are good that he has come to believe that\nif Caine dies by the hand of anyone but God or himself, either the world will end or\nsome horrible disaster will ensue. Only by asking forgiveness for his actions — or, at\nthe very least, honestly coming to regret them — can Caine end his existence\nwithout throwing the whole of Creation into upheaval.\nA WOMAN SCORNED\nRather than following a single, linear course, “Fair is Foul” is designed to unfold\nthrough a series of separate but related events culminating in a final confrontation.\nLilith’s objective here is to create enough supernatural disturbances to draw Caine’s\nattention, while simultaneously gaining a great enough measure of influence over the\ncity that his defeat will be inevitable when he arrives. If none of the scenes appeal to\nyour game, use them simply as guidelines for the general types of situations that move\nthis scenario along and then design your own, keeping Lilith’s ultimate goals in mind.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n28\nIt’s important to realize that by no means does every player’s character have to\nbe involved in every mini-scenario you run. In fact, the diverse nature of the different\nscenes is quite deliberate, with some designed to appeal to more social characters,\nothers for more intellectual types and a few for those who are used to hitting things\nuntil they stop hitting back. At first these may seem isolated incidents, but once the\ncharacters begin comparing notes…\nFOLLOW THE DAUGHTER\nLyla’s status as one of the city’s many homeless people means that she can\nappear at any time in the story — whenever you need a hook to lead into another\nmini-scenario or simply when things begin to slow down. Probably the best idea is\nto have Lyla appear immediately preceding or following another mini-scenario,\nspeaking cryptic messages about the event even though it has not happened yet —\nor, if it already has, even though she was not present for it.\nIf characters treat Lyla well — like a real person, deserving compassion and\nfriendship — they should be rewarded with her trust and some information. Lyla will lead\nthose she trusts to the alley where her mentors, the seven Apostates, reside in their\ndisguises, as she wants her newfound “friends” to meet the closest thing she has to parents.\nDepending on whether Eickos is present, five or six of them cluster near (but not too\nnear…) a burning oil drum to warm themselves. The last — Malakai — huddles far from\nthe fire, muttering to herself and appearing frightened. This scene should be set up in a\nprivate section of your play area, with as much attention given to the details as possible.\nUse the Apostates as you best can, perhaps assigning a couple to Narrator cast members.\nThe characters’ actions here are more critical than perhaps anywhere else in the\nstory, as Lilith frequently watches both the Apostates and Lyla. For her part, Lyla\nspends most of her time in the alley with Malakai, trying to calm her and ease her\nsuffering. Those who approach the fire are treated to cryptic but still relevant bits of\nwisdom from the seemingly eccentric bums. Most of this advice probably centers\nupon questioning one’s path, particularly if the characters have decided to oppose\nLilith by this point. The bums do not reveal themselves as anything more than\nnormal vagrants unless Lyla is directly threatened or someone mentions Lilith, or\nsomething else of great significance.\nIf someone does bring up one of these things, though, the characters most likely\nreceive a direct invitation from Lucian to join Lilith — which could change the\ncomplexion of the story dramatically.\nCOURTLY INTRIGUE\nThis scenario is probably best run as either the very first, to direct the characters\ntoward other mini-scenarios as you see fit, or after all the players’ characters have\nexperienced one of the other mini-scenarios together. Note: Camarilla terms such\nas “prince” will be used from here onward for ease of reading, but adapt the\nterminology for Sabbat or anarchs as need arises.\nThe prince calls a meeting of all the city’s vampires. The main agenda item of the\nmeeting is an act (or several acts) of diablerie. At least one person in the city — preferably\na member of the prince’s own entourage or a well-known elder — has committed the\nheinous deed and must be punished appropriately. If one of your characters has\ncommitted diablerie as her blood has thinned, now is the ideal time to make her pay for\nit, forcing her coterie to choose to go into hiding with her or to turn against her friend.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n29\nCHAPTER TWO\nIf the individual under blood hunt is not one of the players’ characters, the\nperson either is not present at the gathering or somehow manages to escape.\nRegardless, the prince (or an elder, if the prince is under a de-facto hunt by now) calls\nfor everyone in his domain to pursue the wrongdoer and bring him to justice.\nPursuing the fugitive should eventually lead into one of the other mini-scenarios.\nIf the players’ characters do not join the pursuit of the newly hunted individual, or if\nthe prince asks them to stay behind, they may take on other tasks instead. The prince might\nalready be aware of the potential disturbances posed by some or all of the other mini-\nscenarios. This would be an ideal time to split the characters into different scenes that\ninvolve only a few players at a time while others fill temporary cast roles as antagonists.\nSAULOT’S GAMBIT\nSaulot approaches one, several or all of the characters and tries to convince\nthem to join him in the fight against Lilith. If they don’t trust him, he offers to help\nthem with something they need in return for helping him. If Lyla is present, Saulot\nreveals the nature of her unknowing link to Lilith.\nSaulot’s main bargaining chip is information. He knows the true identities of\nthe bums — or, rather, he knows they’re Antediluvians, having a sense for that sort\nof thing — but he doesn’t know specifics about them. He’s been tailing Lilith for a\nlong time and watching her and her closest allies through his own contacts in the\nInconnu and among the mystics of Clan Tremere. He also suspects that Lyla is the\nLast Daughter of Eve and that she’s connected to Lilith by some type of sympathetic\nlink, believing (correctly) that Lyla is the key to defeating Lilith.\nSaulot’s other main asset is his vast knowledge of Thaumaturgy. Spending years\nin Tremere’s body, Saulot knows a great deal about blood magic, as well as that which\nhe learned during his time in the East. He can build a ritual for the players’ characters\nto enact whether or not they have Thaumaturgy, based on those principles. Saulot\nhas access to rituals that require no extensive prior knowledge of magic, and he’s able\nto teach them to the characters if they choose to help him.\nIf the characters do attack him for some reason, Saulot will try to escape rather than\nreturning the attack, reappearing later in a different guise to try to gain their support again.\nENDGAME\nSince so many different characters might be involved in the final confrontation\nbetween Lilith and Caine, this scene has been broken down by character, with\nactions they might take, as well as actions others might take for or against them.\nLYLA\nSince the greatest likelihood is that the characters will find their way to the alley\nthrough Lyla, she’s the first character presented here. When Caine enters the city,\nLilith sets a call to all of her followers to assemble at the alley where the Apostates\nusually gather in disguise. Lyla feels a strong pull toward the site, her Insight warns her\nof a great number of Ancients gathering in one location. She will make any reasonable\nattempt to go to the alley, with or without the characters. If she’s physically restrained,\nshe quickly develops a supernaturally intense migraine, causing her to scream and flail\naround until she’s either silenced somehow or brought to the alley.\nOnce she’s in Lilith’s presence, things get complicated. Because she’s (in\nessence) Lilith’s avatar, Lyla has access to all of Lilith’s abilities. This means that if\nshe stands with Lilith, Lyla changes aspects whenever Lilith does. If the characters\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n30\nhave convinced her to oppose the Dark Mother, they gain (in effect) a “virtual”\nLilith to help them. This effect lasts only while Lyla is in Lilith’s presence, unless Lyla\nor someone else does something (probably involving Lilith’s blood) to make it\npermanent. If the characters have chosen to sacrifice Lyla in their ritual against\nLilith, this sacrifice likewise works only in Lilith’s presence.\nSAULOT\nIf the characters are allied with Saulot, he either gives them a signal and\ndirections to the alley or leads them there himself when the time comes. His main\nobjective is to protect Caine from Lilith, so even though he might help the\ncharacters set up their ritual (if they’re performing one), as soon as Caine arrives,\nSaulot defends him directly.\nUnfortunately for Saulot, the original owner of the body he’s using — Tzimisce,\nnot Tremere — has other plans for it. Sometime during the battle, Saulot begins\ngenerating random manifestations of Vicissitude — limbs elongating while fighting,\nwarping the flesh of his attackers seemingly without effort and so on. Whether Saulot\nis wholly consumed or manages to retain some measure of control is up to you. He did\nsuccessfully resist Tremere for centuries, but Tremere also wasn’t an Antediluvian in\nthe root sense of the word. If the Tzimisce Antediluvian does gain full control of Saulot,\nits mind has likely been so twisted by Vicissitude that it will attack everything in sight,\npossibly retaining enough residual knowledge to know that it wants to eat Caine.\nAlternatively, the Ancient might have consciously been hiding within its bloodline\nfor all this time, and it might still be quite coherent — but also still quite hungry.\nCAINE\nUnless he and Lucifer met before the story began, Caine enters this story highly\nupset. After centuries of enjoying his obscurity and solitude, he finds himself forced\nto travel to some unimportant mortal city due to persistent supernatural distur-\nbances. Once he arrives, he feels Lilith’s presence there and makes straight for her\n(just as Lilith knows he will).\nIt’s a toss-up whether Caine would attack Lilith or the Apostates first, but it’s more\nlikely he’d go for the Apostates, as they directly betrayed him. If he does manage to\ndestroy one or more of them, he has to contend with Lilith’s fury directly — but this\nis unlikely because of the sheer number of monstrous children Lilith can use to slow\nhim down. Caine is very much reacting, rather than instigating, and this is one reason\nthe actions of the players’ characters matter so much in the story — Caine is too\narrogant to realize he’s been set up, so if anyone’s going to save him, it has to be them.\nTHE APOSTATES\nIt’s fair to say that Ilyes, Ikopabe, Erinye and Mekhet fight at Lilith’s side\nunswervingly, in whatever ways you see fit, so more treatment of them is not necessary\nhere. Wounded by her obvious dislike of him despite his loyalty, Lucian might betray\nLilith, but that depends on how much of an advantage you want Lilith to have, as well\nas what interactions Lucian has had with your characters throughout the story.\nAs you should already be aware, Eickos is the one true wild card among the\nApostates. If she does reveal herself as the crone, she might draw Caine’s fire from\nLilith and the Apostates long enough to give Lilith a clear shot at him — if she wants\nto help Lilith at all by now. Eickos might assist with the characters’ ritual against\nLilith, or she might try to kill both Lilith and Caine, forcing the characters to choose\nwhom (if anyone) they wish to save.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n31\nCHAPTER TWO\nLILITH\nThis story begins and ends with Lilith, as her desire for revenge against Caine\nshapes and directs the very course of Gehenna. Once she’s drawn him to the alley,\nshe sends her many children (on both the physical and the astral planes) against him,\nalong with some or all of the Apostates. Because she knows of the sevenfold curse,\nLilith attacks Caine only if she loses her temper — in other words, only if Lyla or one\nof the Apostates should fall by his hand. She has no problem with using the full range\nof her power against anyone who’s aiding Caine, though.\nAFTERMATH\nAny Cainite still standing dies from thinning of the Blood within a few minutes of\nCaine’s death. Those who were Embraced less than 50 years ago and are of high generation\nmight be able to revert to normal mortals. Ghouls automatically revert to normal mortals\nunless they’ve been ghouls for more than their natural life span, in which case they die.\nRevenants and dhampirs may either revert or remain unchanged, at your discretion.\nIf the characters have defeated Lilith, they’ve really shot themselves in the foot,\nas she was the only guaranteed means by which they might survive. Assuming Lilith\nstill exists, she passes judgment on the characters present before returning to her\nGarden. Lilith is a patient woman, and she’s willing to forgive the characters for being\nmisguided — but not for killing any of her “children.” If they killed Lyla or any of the\nApostates, or even treated Lyla badly, she leaves the characters to die, returning to the\nGarden with whomever she has left. If the characters remained neutral or opposed her\nindirectly, she might offer them a drink of her blood, which allows them to survive\nGehenna as ordinary people with no taint of vampire’s blood left in them. All traces\nof Caine’s curse are removed, and the character’s pick up their lives at the age where\nthe Embrace left off. If the characters aided Lilith’s cause, or if they treated Lyla\nparticularly well, Lilith might invite them to join her in her Garden and become lilim.\nAnother option is to have Lilith offer the character’s her blood and have it\ntransform them wholly into lilim, creatures born (like Lilith) to both divine essence\nand mortal bodies.\nWORMWOOD\nWormwood. With that single word, God has called a second Great Flood to\ncleanse the world of Caine and his children. But He will not break His Covenant\nwith Noah. This flood will be different; it will pass unseen by the Children of Seth\nand by all but the most sensitive of Caine’s progeny, its raging waters more spiritual\nthan physical, drowning only those whose time has come.\nWhen it is over, the Curse of Caine will be gone without a trace, its stain on\nCreation washed clean at last.\nA PROPHET EMERGES\nChosen to be a prophet of Gehenna, Alia was born a dhampir, an abomination\ntrapped between the world of the living and the world of the undead. When Alia\nturned 12, something of her divine role became evident. When she first experienced\nmenstruation — the “mark of the moon” — she fell into a feverish state that lasted\nuntil she shed no more blood. When the fever passed, Alia seemed different. Upon\nentering womanhood, she appeared more serious and the look in her eyes seemed to\nbelong to someone far older and wiser.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n32\nAlia had heard the voice of God, and it had changed her. She was to find a\nKindred, one whose faith was stronger than all others combined, and give him God’s\nmessage. Over the next few months, Alia heard God’s voice again and again. She did\nnot reveal what she learned, but she did explain that she could no longer stay with\nher family. Only her Caitiff protectors went with her to continue to ensure her safety.\nFinally, after nearly a year of fruitless searching, she found the one she was looking\nfor and delivered unto him no less than the Word of God.\nWandering into an abandoned mission church far from the busy heart of the\ncity, Alia met a beatific Gargoyle named Ferox, who told her that he was God’s\nservant. He told her of his mission to do God’s bidding and that if she believed as he\ndid, she might be spared from His wrath. When Ferox had finished, Alia lifted her\nhead and gazed into the eyes of the monstrosity before her.\nAlia trembled as she revealed God’s message. God would send a flood that\nwould wipe the Kindred from Creation, and that flood would be called Wormwood,\nand it would appear as a star. God wanted Ferox to gather others of his kind according\nto forthcoming signs and to create for them a Sanctuary. When the flood that is\nWormwood is nigh, God will let him know and he will go into the Sanctuary with\nthe other chosen and stay until 40 nights have passed. During that time, the world\nwill be flooded by Wormwood, though only the Children of Caine will taste its bitter\nwaters. After 40 nights it will be over. Those who remained in the Sanctuary will be\nsafe from the flood, but they too will be judged. Those found wanting will be undone.\nThe next evening, the Red Star appeared in the heavens. God’s plan had been\nset in motion and nothing would stop it. Wormwood approached and with it so did\nGehenna. Ferox and Alia gazed at the star and began their journey. They had work\nto do, and the world’s hour was late already.\nLOCKED ROOMS, GUARDED HEARTS\nAlthough this version of Gehenna might be too subtle for some tastes, it is\nsuitable for any group of characters, from the most bestial and diabolic to the most\ncultured and even repentant. It can be played one-on-one for a very personal\nepilogue to an introspective chronicle, or played out in full with a larger troupe for\nan intense roleplaying exercise. Neonates and elders alike will find themselves\nequally challenged, with neither having any assured advantage. If your troupe\nwants to experience Gehenna as something very personal, a grand ending that\nleaves the beaten path and returns instead to the basics of storytelling and dramatic\ndiscovery, “Wormwood” should please. In many ways, this scenario is played out\nlike a classic “locked-room mystery,” as secrets come to light and souls are laid bare\nin the confines of a place no one wanted to be yet no one can escape.\nFORTY NIGHTS OF GEHENNA\nAs has already been noted, the characters can really be of any clan, generation or\nsect; all are welcome. Although God has chosen the most faithful Child of Caine to\nprovide Sanctuary, He intends to fill that Sanctuary with vampires that represent the full\nspectrum of Caine’s children. Simulating this epic gathering might require an intrepid\nstaff of Narrators to play different parts at different times during these sessions. A\nStoryteller might want to recruit additional staff to help fill the varying roles. Fortunately,\nwith proper set dressing, the Sanctuary should be a large enough place that certain key\ncharacters can “disappear” for a time into other areas of the church, allowing others a\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n33\nCHAPTER TWO\nchance to emerge. Naturally, this will necessitate a certain degree of coordination\nbetween you and your Narrator staff, but it is not an insurmountable obstacle.\nThe Storyteller should introduce other Kindred who represent examples of\nwhat the troupe is not. If the characters make up a coterie of relatively moral\nCamarilla neonates, they should be complemented with such opposing figures as a\nBlack Hand assassin, a deranged Samedi or perhaps a few truly warped members of\nClan Malkavian. As a Storyteller, you might even want to include a subtle infernalist\ninto the Sanctuary to tempt the virtuous. (After all, God allowed Jesus to be tempted\nin the desert.) There is little doubt that this infiltrator will perish when God judges\nthose in the Sanctuary (perhaps another character will learn the truth and seek to\nredeem him instead of casting him out, and save himself in doing so), but until then\nthey could really spice up the scenario. Maybe not a full soul-lost infernalist, but\nsomeone with those leanings will offer a great roleplaying opportunity.\nSANCTUARY\nIn addition to simply serving as a place of safety from the storm, the Sanctuary also\nprovides an appropriately gothic atmosphere that captures much of the mood of Masquer-\nade. Because it is a house of God, the feelings of damnation and salvation are also evoked,\nand reminders of God’s presence will be impossible for the characters to avoid within the\nchurch’s walls. It is a fitting example of the World of Darkness itself. The church is no longer\na place of active worship, but rather a barely standing ruin that says more about the\ndesperation, tragedy and hopelessness prevalent on Earth than about religious devotion.\nYour choice of play area should reflect this setting as best it can. Playing in a\nlarge, darkened basement or similarly secluded area would be ideal. The play area\nshould be set up with areas for the players to interact on large scales as well as in more\nprivate circumstances. If needed, designated areas could be blocked off using tarps\nor dark sheets to make crude private rooms. If you aren’t comfortable with having\na blanket serve as a stone support wall, have the private rooms be loosely constructed\nfrom actual blankets by prior residents such as the homeless drifters who might have\nentered the Sanctuary in the past.\nSYSTEMS FOR SANCTUARY\nThe following are the special effects of Sanctuary:\n• Sanctuary is supernaturally difficult to notice, causing most people to\noverlook its existence and making it extremely difficult for Kindred or others\nto penetrate it with supernatural perceptions. This means that while the\nSanctuary is not actually invisible, it does go largely unnoticed.\n• Because of Ferox, Sanctuary has an effective True Faith rating of 5.\n• All Disciplines are limited to the Kindred’s True Faith rating + 1,\nmeaning that most Kindred can use only the first power of a Discipline\n(Alacrity, Endurance, Heightened Senses, etc.). Note that this doesn’t mean the\nentire Basic level, but the very first power of the Basic level.\n• Upon awakening, Kindred lose only one Blood Trait every 10 days,\nrather than the usual one per day.\n• Once Gehenna begins, Sanctuary is impregnable to all Kindred who\nhave not been Chosen. Even the Chosen, should they forgo the protection of\nSanctuary, will be unable to return.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n34\nWORMWOOD\nThe Red Star has been visible in the sky since 1999 to those Kindred possessed\nof Auspex, as well as others — such as some Malkavians, thin-blooded Kindred and\neven some very rare mortals — who have similarly sensitive, albeit different, percep-\ntions. Throughout these events, this remains the case, meaning that most of Caine’s\nchildren won’t even really know the nature of the sudden affliction they experience.\nAlmost no mortals will have any idea that anything unusual is occurring, but only the\nChosen will be spared as vampires around the world feel the wrath of God’s judgment.\nSome characters will inevitably believe they have a way to trick God and escape\nHis wrath, and not by entering the Sanctuary provided. Some might decide to hide\ndeep in the earth (or even become part of it), while others might choose to go into the\nastral plane or some other realm of existence to sit out the flood, hoping that they can\njust come on back when everything is over. It’s nice that they think so, but Wormwood\nis a judgment from the divine. Everything is part of God’s Creation, so everything is\nsubject to the power of Wormwood and the cold justice it brings. That means no tricks,\nno dodges, no hope of escape. No matter how many levels of Disciplines a Kindred has\nor how clever she thinks she is, Wormwood will find her and pass sentence in the end.\nTHE EFFECTS OF WORMWOOD\nEssentially, everyone exposed to Wormwood’s effects suffers a heightened and\nhighly debilitating form of the Withering. All losses are measured in days as opposed\nto weeks or months, each use of a Blood Trait automatically causes Discipline loss,\nand diablerie doesn’t stave off the effects (not that the undead don’t try it). In\naddition, the maximum Generation of all Kindred drops by one every two nights, so\nthat all Kindred are effectively 15th generation by the 27th night.\nEventually even the capacity to contain blood in their system fades. Each\nevening after the 27th, every vampire’s maximum blood pool decreases by one until\nthe 37th night, when they can no longer maintain any vitae in their withered bodies.\nAt this point, only constant introduction by artificial means could possibly enable\na vampire to sustain himself any longer. Without such extreme measures, any\nvampire who is still around slips into torpor. Given the fact that they no longer have\nthe ability to contain vitae, create vitae or otherwise acquire vitae in this state, such\ntorpid Kindred meet their Final Death no later than sunrise on the morning after the\n37th night as Wormwood’s flood quietly takes them as well.\nThese conditions also affect ghouls, revenants and dhampirs. Any beings with\nCaine’s blood in their system suffer until all have been extinguished and the last\ntraces of the Curse of Caine are purged from the world.\nTHE LONGEST NIGHT ENDS\nThe story begins three nights before Wormwood first rains its bitter flood down\nupon the world. Ferox and Alia have been in the city for a few weeks already, seeking\nshelter in an old, abandoned church in the most neglected part of town. If you do not\nfully wish to introduce them into your existing story, feel free to mention them only\nin rumors and unverified sightings. The two have come to the city as a result of their\nongoing search for the Chosen, still unsure how many of these special Kindred they\nmust find and when Gehenna will come.\nAlready a number of the Chosen have found their way to the city, but none have\nyet figured out where it is they must go. Again, this strange phenomenon is\nsomething that you can mention as rumor in your story prior to the events of\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n35\nCHAPTER TWO\nWormwood as a buildup to the final hours. Simply spotting these many new faces in\nthe setting should be enough to send most vampires into a paranoid frenzy. Use this\nfor your setting, perhaps at first using misdirection to hint that some kind of invasion\nor takeover is imminent. The truth will be coming soon enough anyway.\nON THE EVE OF GEHENNA\nSince the players are going to be among the Chosen, you should make them feel that\nfate had some hand in their being in the right place at the right time (as opposed to their\nbeing Chosen having to do with them just being the players). Perhaps a series of\ncoincidences drives them all to the Sanctuary in the final hour. Don’t strong-arm them into\nposition, but plan for delicate and believable reasoning. Maybe that Ventrue “just happens”\nto be meeting with a real estate developer in that neighborhood, while the Nosferatu is\nfollowing him on an “anonymous” tip, and the Brujah gang is chasing a rival gang member\nwho happened to run into that neighborhood. If possible, sow the seeds to put the characters\nin the right neighborhood at the right time sessions or even stories in advance, preferably\nas a minor footnote. If that Ventrue has had this “routine meeting” on his schedule for four\nmonths, having it turn out to be so critical will seem much more mystical.\nTHE BELL TOLLS\nThe precise hour that Gehenna begins is not really important, but the\ncharacters should be no more than a couple of blocks away from the Sanctuary when\nit does. The first thing to happen is the tolling of the church bell that only the\nChosen can hear. It does not ring just once, but continues to peal loudly, signaling\nthat it is time to seek Sanctuary. Characters with some kind of Awareness or Auspex\ncould be given a Simple Test to understand that urgency is called for, though they\nmight not understand why. They just have an instinctual and unnerving sensation\nthat something terrible is looming over them.\nEach of the Chosen has found his way to the Sanctuary at this final moment,\nthough like the characters, none expected the others. As is to be expected, each will\nbe wary, many likely wondering aloud just what kind of trick this is. Some might even\nprepare to defend themselves against the other strange vampires, or from whatever\nancient fiend or power has summoned them here. They really won’t have enough\ntime for introductions or fighting at this point, however. Gehenna is upon them, and\nthe instinct to survive will take precedence over all their other urges.\nOnly moments after the Chosen come face-to-face with one another in front of\nthe church, the most sensitive Kindred will watch as Wormwood appears to go\nsupernova before their unbelieving eyes and the entire night sky suddenly blazes\nbrilliant red. This unexpected flash does not actually blind a viewer for more than a\nsecond or two, but it’s certainly enough to elicit a look of shock and incredulity from\nthose who are able to witness the spectacle. Moments after the supernova, Wormwood\nwill appear to have grown prodigiously. From the Red Star will begin to pour a great\nwaterfall of crimson mist that quickly becomes a cloud of strange fog rolling quickly\nacross the land in every direction. Those characters who cannot directly perceive\nWormwood will still feel something ominous that gives them pause and leaves them\nfeeling a terrible sense of impending doom, every hair on their body standing on end.\nBy now it should be frighteningly clear to the characters, as well as to most of the\nChosen, that whatever it is that is happening, it is definitely not good. Even their arsenal\nof Disciplines will not guarantee surviving the fast-approaching fog. Even if the\ncharacters are so obtuse as to not get it, the sight of all these strange Kindred, the pilgrims\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n36\nincluded, suddenly high-tailing it toward what appears to be a barely standing ruin of a\nchurch should kick-start them into action. The rest of the Chosen will rush as quickly\nas possible for the church, each following the lead of the others as much as the odd\ncompulsion that tells them that somehow, this house of God might provide Sanctuary.\nIf for some reason the characters wish to stand at the open doors and watch what\nis happening outside, describe how the floodwaters of Wormwood roll past like a\nsmothering cloud and suck the doors closed as if they caused a tremendous vacuum.\nThis should be a moment when suddenly there is silence and a whole new chapter\nis about to begin, not just for the characters, but for all Kindred. No character can\nprevent or hasten this final closing — they can forget locking out rivals or\nundesirables, if others are meant to be judged, it will not be by the characters.\nINTO THE FIRE\nOnce the Sanctuary doors have closed, the characters and the rest of the\nChosen will have a chance to look around. Inside, the church is even more ruinous\nthan its exterior suggests. Almost nothing of value remains in the entire place, and\nmost of the areas off the central nave are either devastated from fire and collapse or\nentirely impassable, blocked by rubble. Even though most of the stained-glass\nwindows are broken, the flood outside cannot enter. To the eyes of those who can\nsee it, a red mist appears to simply wash past without coming inside. You might wish\nLEAVING SANCTUARY\nIf one or more characters chooses to leave the church and venture even\na step outside its protection at any time during the 40 nights of the flood, they\nwill be tainted by Wormwood and suffer the full effects already discussed. In\naddition, they will not be able to enter the Sanctuary again, for they have\neffectively turned their back on God’s offer of salvation.\nThere is one very special case, however, that allows a Kindred who has left\nto return to Sanctuary even in the middle of the flood. It can occur only if the\nKindred who exits does so to perform some action that is truly selfless and\ndemonstrates the very essence of humanity. If this happens, and the character in\nquestion truly believes he has sacrificed his own chance at salvation to do one last\nact of goodness, then if he does come back to the church, he will find that not only\nmay he reenter, but upon doing so, all the effects of Wormwood will vanish as if\nhe had never left the Sanctuary in the first place. If the same character tries it again\nor another Kindred decides to play copycat without a similarly selfless motive,\nthere will be no turning back. Like the rest of the world’s Kindred, the rest will be\nunable to ever again breach the Sanctuary and must accept their tragic fate.\nYou and your staff should be ready to narrate this type of scene in case someone\ntries to take up this course of action. To avoid “screwball” attempts to leave, you\nmight want to give a test for Awareness or Instinct as the character tries to cross the\nthreshold of the church, letting them know that this would be a “bad idea.” It is\nhighly recommended that you keep this escape clause secret, even from the player\ninvolved, and make everyone wonder about why they were allowed to return. If\nnecessary, give selfless players a test or two to realize they can return, but only after\nthe task is done, and preferably only once they have just about given up hope.\nOtherwise, you might have all the players clamoring to go for “selfless reasons.”\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n37\nCHAPTER TWO\nto place pre-typed cards at the locations where the windows would be, describing this\neffect. That way you get to be as descriptive as you wish in regard to detail while\nfreeing yourself up for narration duties. Keep these narratives simple and only to\ndescribe things that you can’t actually safely simulate yourself.\nAlia and Ferox introduce themselves after the Kindred have some time to look\naround and take in the basic dimensions of their new haven. Speaking quietly yet\nforcefully, they tell the Kindred of the 40 nights they are to remain together and that\nGod has promised that should they redeem themselves, salvation awaits each and\nevery one of them. The rest of the Kindred, however, even the Dark Father himself,\nwill be no more. Finally, Ferox will warn the Chosen not to leave the premises if they\nwish to survive another night, but he also makes it clear that he will not stop anyone\nwho chooses to refuse God’s offer of salvation.\nHELL IS OTHER PEOPLE\nFor the next 40 nights, the Chosen and God’s two agents will spend their every\nwaking hour trapped in the cathedral with only each other as company, doing their\nbest to deal with the situation. Daylight hours will be spent sleeping under pews, in\nthe confessionals, in the choir loft and in the various small sacramental and\nhousekeeping rooms near the altar that are still accessible. The Kindred in the\nSanctuary will have to find ways to pass the time, to handle their hungers and urges,\nand to come to terms with Gehenna.\nThe scenarios that follow are intended to challenge the characters on a variety\nof levels as a way for them to redeem themselves. They are not meant to replace\nanything else going on in the Sanctuary — and, in fact, can be completely discarded\nif the Storyteller has a better way for God to test the characters — but they will probably\nbe useful even if only as a guide as to how to approach this difficult part of the story.\nThere is no particular order in which these scenarios need to take place, and none\nrequires that another occur before or after. Each is a self-contained situation that can\nbe plugged in at any time that the Storyteller feels it might be appropriate.\nKeep in mind that besides these little dramas, nearly anything can be going on\namong the Chosen as they wait for the end of Gehenna. It is very likely that most of\ntheir time will simply be spent in conversation, getting to know one another, arguing\nabout their beliefs and views, and maybe even striking alliances and friendships that\nthey hope will serve them after the worst has ended. Do not underestimate the amount\nof drama that can come from putting enough of these personalities under one roof.\nWhile these scenarios are provided to make sure that they don’t just sit around for 40\nnights, great debates and philosophical conversations among the Kindred should be\nhighly encouraged — this is Mind’s Eye Theatre, after all.\nThe Call for Help\nThe Chosen hear gunshots outside, followed by the squealing of tires, which\ndraws their attention to the church doors or a window. From their vantage, they see\nthat a man is lying on a nearby curb, blood seeping from his body as a dark-colored\nMercedes roars away. The few people who were close enough to witness the scene\nsimply stare, then hurry on as if nothing happened, making no attempt to call\nattention to the crime, to summon the authorities or to help the man. As the\ncharacters watch, they notice the man move slightly, trying to lift an arm, and they\nhear his weak voice calling for help, but no one comes to his aid, fearful of reprisal\nor simply too jaded by life’s horrors to feel any compulsion to intervene. The man\nis less than 20 yards away, but still in the middle of Wormwood’s swirling fog.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n38\nDo the characters try to coerce someone to help the man? Will they go through all\ntheir own possessions, find a mobile phone and call the authorities or emergency services\nthemselves? Or do they also just watch, being concerned for their own problems?\nDon’t Do It!\nA few hours before sundown, a young man enters the church through the rubble\nin the back and climbs up to the highest point. The young man cannot take it any\nlonger. He has decided to end his life, climbing up onto the old church so that he\ncan. The characters will notice him at some point, but should not be able to easily\nget to him due to where he is. The young man will be startled by the characters, but\nwill be vaguely defiant and tell them to leave him alone. He is going to jump if they\ntry to stop him. And he will jump, if they are not careful.\nIf they decide to save him, how do they do it? Direct action might force him to\njump, while talking to him could also upset him and cause him to make the leap.\n(Remember, their Disciplines are limited in power.) Will they just let him go,\nchalking it up to another useless life well ended?\nBon Voyage\nOne of the Chosen Narrator characters has decided that she cannot take it\nanymore. This Kindred declares her intention to leave, wondering aloud if there\nreally is any Gehenna after all; maybe it’s just a trick that Ferox has invented for his\nown obscure purposes. She might even try to convince other Kindred to go with her,\nto hunt for some fresh blood and revive her unlife. Surely all manner of schemes\nFORTY DAYS OF NIGHT\nSo how do you play out 40 nights of passing time in Mind’s Eye Theatre?\nThere are a few options for an ambitious Storyteller. One of the first suggestions\nto come to mind is to condense the time so that only the important nights in\nSanctuary are represented with actual game sessions, while less interesting nights\nare handled in downtime. Doing so could create a marathon couple of sessions,\nhowever, and your players could become fatigued, thus costing you some of your\nstory tension. Or this scenario could be run in a series of game sessions all held\nin the same location (perhaps not the whole 40 nights, but three or even four\nsmaller sessions building to the dramatic conclusion). Just make sure to schedule\nthese sessions close enough together to keep the dramatic tension building.\nAnd what happens if players or key staff can’t make it to one session?\nWhat’s a Storyteller to do? These are not unassailable obstacles but rather\nthings to keep in mind for planning this most important session.\nWith a little creativity, even this absence can be explained. Perhaps the\ncharacter is speaking privately with Ferox and Alia (or another reclusive\ncontact). Maybe he is resting or praying under the church in a secure room; no\ndiablerie or assassination on Ferox’s watch. You might even be able to have a\nproperly briefed Narrator stand in for the character, at least for part of the\nsession — though don’t let such demands get in the way of the story for those\nplayers that have made the time to come and play. Provided that players\nunderstand that attempting to abuse these privileges to avoid death or plot will\nbe punished accordingly, it should be a good way to make sure that the\nchronicle goes on without leaving people out of the loop.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n39\nCHAPTER TWO\ncould have been hatched against them during their absence, so why are they just\nsitting here in an old church hiding from phantasmal fog? She has every intention\nof going, but if that’s true, why doesn’t she just go? Why give a soliloquy and try to\nget others to join her? This person should be someone unexpected to the troupe.\nMaybe she’s not a Brujah rabble-rouser, but a more contemplative or well-liked\nKindred. Without an element of fear and outrage to the thought of this individual\ndeparting to possible destruction, this situation will lose all dramatic value.\nDo the characters try to convince her not to go, or do they simply wish her the\nbest of luck and wave goodbye as she leaves? Do any of them take her side or speak\nout on her behalf? Do they actually try to force her to stay, possibly against her will?\nWill they risk injuring her to save her from what they believe is her own destruction?\nOne of Us\nA rumor starts among the Kindred of Sanctuary — that great Caine is among them,\ndisguised as one them and watching to see who is most loyal to him. It’s not God’s judgment\noutside, but Caine’s, and only those that show unflinching fear and obedience to the Father\nof All Vampires will survive. Naturally, a Noddist or follower of the Path of Caine is most\nlikely to start this rumor, but it can come from anywhere, and once it starts, it can grow to\nbecome near hysteria in time. This situation is best introduced quietly early on, and then\nsubtly built up as time passes. It’s easy to dismiss in the beginning, but as fear and tension\nmounts, some Kindred will look for anything they can to assuage their fear, and the notion\nthat the First Vampire is among them might just do it.\nVariations on this theme include Lilith, an ancient Inconnu, a powerful\ninfernalist or even one or more of the Antediluvians. (This last option is especially\npopular if a large number of one or two clans make up the Chosen.)\nRepent! The End is Here!\nOne evening, a homeless doomsayer in a shabby and formerly white robe takes up\nresidence on the steps in front of the church carrying a large sign declaring, “Repent! The\nTHE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE\nIt might not be a bad idea to include some well-known Narrator characters.\nMaybe some locally famous (or infamous) personalities have arrived, such as the\nmysterious Inconnu no one ever actually saw for the entire chronicle, or the\nfearsome Sabbat archbishop that was always plotting against the characters\nfrom across the river. Or maybe the characters are in even more illustrious\ncompany. Do the characters find themselves holed up with Lambach Ruthven?\nSascha Vykos? Jan Pieterzoon? Theo Bell? Beckett? Lucita? Having one or two\nfamous “signature” personalities from Vampire trapped with your characters\ncan add a great deal of power and drama to the situation, particularly if they also\nhappen to be personalities that the characters know about or have dealt with\nin the past. What are these famous Kindred doing now that they see their world\nending and their carefully laid plans coming to nothing? Do those trapped with\nthem pay them respect, or is each one just one more Lick now that Gehenna\nis here? As long as you make sure that the Narrators are prepared to play these\nwell-known parts, and these personalities don’t overshadow the players and\ntheir struggles, having a few of these distinctive personalities imparts both the\ngravity of what’s going on and a sense of continuity with the larger setting.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n40\nEnd is Here!” He gives his end-of-the-world speech to anyone who happens to wander\nby in this mostly desolate neighborhood. He is a cranky old bastard, utterly fearless and\nprobably more than a bit crazy, but he is certainly not stupid. He will not give in to\ndemands that he leave and will instead do everything in his power to engage the\ncharacters in conversation, eager to discuss sins, redemption, salvation, damnation and\nanything else along those lines. The man will not allow himself to be lured into the\nchurch under any circumstances, if he can help it. Though he will talk with anyone, he\ntrusts no one.\nDo the characters do their best to ignore him? Do they see him as a possible threat,\nperhaps drawing too much attention to the arcane church? Are they interested in his\nviews? Could he be another messenger from God, or is he just a meal to quench their\nhunger? What if he spouts off something that sounds a little too much like the actual truth\nbehind Gehenna? What do the characters do then?\nRED RAIN\nFor 40 nights, the characters, the rest of the Chosen, Ferox and Alia have remained\ninside the Sanctuary, safe from God’s wrath. Some might not have survived the passing\nof time, but most probably have, at least physically. Now the final night of Gehenna has\ncome. This is the night when the fog will finally lift and the only vampires left will be\nthose in the church. Outside its marred granite walls, the world is dark, but that darkness\nis not as deep as it used to be. For a few hours more, however, the characters are still inside.\nThey are still facing each other and, far more importantly, facing God’s final judgment.\nSalvation was never guaranteed them, only the possibility of salvation.\nThe Kindred will probably be more energized than they have been since the first\nfew nights of their seclusion, each feverishly wondering exactly what will happen now\nthat Gehenna is supposed to end. For those who are still up and about, they will\nprobably be excited at the possibility that they have survived the storm and will now\nbe some of the only vampires still around. They might start plotting how together with\nthe other Chosen they can start a new race of Kindred, never again bowing to the now-\ndeceased vampires who once lorded over them. It is likely that some will begin making\nlast-minute alliances and deals as they think about their new unlife ahead, while some\nmight start thinking about who they wish to Embrace once they leave.\nOf course, that kind of scheming and planning not only proves that they have not\nfigured out what God’s judgment on the Kindred has been, but it is certainly not what\nGod would see as the mark of someone seeking redemption. It should likely spell doom\nfor that vampire no matter how nobly she acted during Wormwood’s flood.\nAt least one of the Chosen might start thinking that now might be a good time\nto try to take out all the other Kindred. He might reason that if the rest are destroyed,\nthen he will be like a new Caine, the father of all future vampires and, in some sense,\nthe “winner” of Gehenna. Of course, such a Kindred will have to believe that he\nreally is safe from God; that perhaps what has been happening outside is not really\ndivine justice. Even given Ferox’s formidable powers, the megalomaniac might still\nbe able to pull something off. And what if he has secret allies to help him stage this\nbloody purge? Desperation makes for strange alliances, as well as powerful foes.\nTHE MORNING AFTER\nGehenna concludes just before dawn, but the end will not come quietly for the\nChosen. Just before the sun comes over the city’s horizon, an unexpected and unusually\npowerful rush of Wormwood’s force sweeps over the church. Sanctuary shakes as it is\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n41\nCHAPTER TWO\nsuddenly battered, and its structural instability will be sorely tested. Large sections of the\nroof and wall will be torn away from on high along with stained-glass windows and chunks\nof granite. Anything the Kindred can use to hide from the sun’s full glare will be ripped\naway. Ferox and Alia will kneel in prayer near the altar and ignore what is happening,\ntrusting that God will protect them. Most debris is simply blasted away, leaving the\nChosen unharmed, but without protection from the morning light just moments away.\nAnd then the sunlight strikes, blazing into the church as brilliantly as any\nsunrise could, its magnificent rays bathing every inch of the place inside and out,\nleaving no place untouched. Now is the moment when everyone’s fate is revealed,\nwhen each of the Chosen learn what is to become of them. Did they redeem\nthemselves, or does God find them wanting?\nThose vampires who have redeemed themselves, who truly understand what it\nmeans to be human, will find that every last shred of the Curse of Caine is blasted from\nthem — every vampire weakness, every ability, every craving, every fear. God’s light\nscourges the Curse from their body and soul as if they had never been Embraced, and they\nbecome mortal again. It is as if they had not aged a moment since the wrenching night\nwhen they were dragged into the world of nightmare that has been their existence for\nhowever long. They are once again living and breathing, once again human and whole.\nStorytellers should use this time to describe not only the physical changes that\ntake place for certain characters (Gangrel lose any animal features, the Nosferatu\nappear normal, even the Samedi have healthy features), but to also describe the\nexpressions and spoken feelings of the others who have been made mortal. Don’t let\nit seem like, “Hey, this is all we get?” Instead, remind the players of the infinite joys\nof being alive, even as rediscovered while standing in the ruined church.\nThose who did not redeem themselves will not know salvation and will not taste\nthe sweet flavor of life again. Instead, the sunlight will hit them full force. God chose\nthem from among the multitude and offered them one final chance at salvation. He\ngave these Kindred 40 nights to try to show Him that they were worthy of His merciful\ngift, yet still they refused and cared not for redemption. Now they will burn with no\nchance to escape, and not even ash will remain of these truly damnable monsters.\nAt this point, the church is really destroyed. It is no longer a sanctuary, but\nsimply a ruined building. Outside, the neighborhood is still what it was, a place where\nlife is cheap and sorrow is no stranger, but the characters should see it very differently\nnow. Just point out that even here in what seemed the most inhuman part of the city,\nhope, love and the possibility for something better is alive and well, despite all\nevidence to the contrary.\nAnd maybe it was there the whole time, but they never really saw it.\nTHE CRUCIBLE OF GOD\nIn this scenario, the end comes in a series of events, at first small, that ultimately\nspiral out of control and result in widespread destruction throughout the world.\nReason and order are uprooted as the worst fears of Kindred and kine alike are\nrealized. The Masquerade is forever broken, and the ensuing war rouses the Ancients\nto come and claim the world their childer have been preparing for them.\nWhat follows is an outline of the escalating events that take place to bring about\nthis end, as well as some suggested directions for that end to take when it finally reaches\nits climatic point. Storytellers should feel free to translate these events into their\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n42\nindividual game setting as they best see fit. A scene or two done locally to get the point\nof what is going on should get the players involved in the enormity of this story. The\nstorm might begin with your characters, but it won’t end until the world is consumed.\nLater events are far more epic in scale. Your players could be front and center for\nthese events or simply feel their aftershocks. As always, use what works best for you and\nyour individual game setting. This is a grand finale, though, and your sessions should\nhave the special attention deserving of a powerful conclusion either way.\nMASQUERADE’S END\nSome players might feel that their characters never get a chance to play an\nimportant role in Cainite affairs. As a Storyteller, this is your chance to give such\nplayers what they want. If you so choose, they can become the most important Kindred\nin the world: the vampires responsible for finally destroying the Masquerade.\nAnd they say you never let them have any fun.\nAs Storyteller, watch for a moment when the characters perform some act that\nis completely impossible for mortals. Typical examples include a character being\nshot repeatedly but remaining obviously unharmed, Thaumaturgy use, incautious\nfeeding or even the result of a feud with another supernatural group.\nIt’s up to you as a Storyteller to decide when and where this slip takes place. Even\nif the characters are careful, mistakes can always occur. In this case, the mistake will\nset forth a chain of events that will change the existence of vampires everywhere. But\nsomehow, someone does see the characters… and she has a video camera. A lot of\npeople now carry these things everywhere they go, so this is hardly implausible. The\nmortal records the characters without their knowing it. It’s something that vampires\nthe world over having been fearing would eventually take place.\nYour players should feel that this is the inevitable tear in the curtain of the Masquerade\nthat was just waiting to happen, however, and not a well-planned Storyteller event. They\nmight not even realize the magnitude of what has happened until it’s too late. To avoid\nbitter resentment, arguments or feelings of being railroaded, however, make the scenario\nplausible while still being inescapable. If you like, you can even give astute or investigative\ncharacters a glimpse that makes it appear like some larger vampiric power(s) might be\nmanipulating events… to ensure discovery of the Kindred? But who would benefit from\nsuch open violation of the Masquerade and the terrible war that is sure to follow?\nWho, indeed.\nIN THE WRONG HANDS\nThe mortal with the camera shows her footage to a local TV news team. They have\nexperts look for evidence of camera tricks while a reporter tries to find the identities of the\ncharacters. Did any character have a driver’s license, a criminal record or any incident in\nhis past that left his picture in government files? Unless special steps have been taken, the\nreporter finds the character’s identity. If the character keeps a legally recorded residence,\nthe reporter finds that too. If the character is legally dead, the reporter finds that data even\nmore interesting. Perhaps the reporter follows the characters and sees them interacting with\nother vampires in your setting, thus tying them into this growing conspiracy as well.\nSoon after, the news team knows the identities and has investigated the paper trails\nof at least some of the characters. The film goes on the national six o’clock news (not to\nmention the Internet), and from there, there’s no going back. Too many mortals have\nseen the footage to all be dominated or intimidated into silence. Within another week,\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n43\nCHAPTER TWO\nthe characters become internationally notorious. Their footage is being downloaded\ndaily on multiple sites across the Internet. The cops might want to arrest them for any\nviolent acts in the footage. Scientists want to study their unexplained powers, or at least\nmake a name by tying themselves to this media circus. The characters may need to evade\neveryone from the FBI to the Centers for Disease Control. Their elders and superiors will\nbe clamoring to hush up the incident, using whatever resources they have to spare. More\nimportant events take up their attention soon enough, however.\nFULL DISCLOSURE\nInevitably, some other Kindred breaks his silence on the matter. If the players’\ncharacters escape the hunt, some other Cainite decides he wants to be famous on\ntelevision by telling everything. (Maybe he even wants a book deal for this\ninterview.) Perhaps some younger and more rebellious vampires take advantage of\nsituation to finally blow the lid off the game of their elders once and for all. They\nbegin talking to as many different parts of the media as possible, spreading the word\nfar too quickly to stop all the leaks. The small tear in the Masquerade quickly\nbecomes a jagged gash. The names of clans are being openly discussed by fascinated\nmortals on television talk shows and in office cubicles across the country.\nUNLIVES OF THE RICH AND FAMOUS\nIf you desire to delay the impending conflict and bloodshed somewhat, simply\nhave a few more “photogenic” Kindred come forward and speak on behalf of\nvampire society. Those who achieved fame in life as artists, generals, statesmen and\nthe like are good candidates, though really any older Kindred can become a\ncelebrity as a “living history” specimen for social scientists to study. This is a time\nfor socially adept and manipulative characters to shine. Unrestricted by the need\nto operate in secrecy, they can negotiate all manner of deals and enjoy their\nnewfound status in public, at least for a time. Indeed, it might even seem as though\na lasting peaceful concord between vampires and mortals might be possible, and\nsome Cainites dare to think that the Masquerade’s end might not doom the\nKindred after all. It’s not true, at least not if the timeline of this scenario is to be\nfollowed, but it’s a pleasant fiction for the characters nonetheless.\nSTRIKE A MATCH\nNo matter what the initial reaction of the world might be, eventually someone\nwill slip. Perhaps a Tzimisce haven, or the leftover corpse from a depraved Nosferatu\nfeeding is uncovered. Maybe a Malkavian loses it on the air and attacks everyone is\nsight. The world is faced with the horror of what vampires really are. They aren’t sexy\nactors leaning seductively against lampposts — they are monsters. What started as\na media curiosity is quickly turned to fear and hostility.\nNot every country declares war on Cainites, and even those that do differ widely\nin how well they fight. In the developed world, the Kindred face squads of soldiers\narmed with infrared scopes, night-vision goggles and high-powered weaponry. In\nmany Third-World countries, corrupt governments and militaries prove laughably\neasy for Cainites to bribe or avoid. Most of the danger comes from poorly armed but\nnumerous local militias, fervent and able to act during the day.\nThe extent to which this New Inquisition takes place in your setting is really\nup to you. The characters might be fighting for their unlives on a nightly basis, or\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n44\nthey could be cleverly using these hastily put together hunting parties against their\nenemies by directing them elsewhere (just as their elders did the first time). Use what\nworks best for your individual setting.\nTHE RISING OF THE ANCIENTS\nThe following events take place on a global scale. They can be used in your\nsetting to give your players a front-row seat to the final battle of the Antediluvians.\nThe Ancients clash with one another in the open now, sensing that some kind of end\nis near. What part your players take in these events is a challenge to your game. They\ncan be there for the whole thing, or they might only have to deal with the ripples in\ntheir small corner of the world.\nHow long does the war between Kindred and kine last? Simply put, it lasts as\nlong as the Storyteller and players find it interesting. If the players are having fun\nusing their skills, resources and supernatural powers to simulate a large-scale conflict\nof this nature, by all means, let them enjoy themselves. If they are bored with warfare\nand logistics, however, feel free to step up the timetable a bit. After all, both sides\nhave more than enough power to do so if they desire. In the end, no one ever knows\nwhether the mortals could exterminate the Kindred before the undead rally and take\ncomplete control — greater powers decide the issue.\nFIRST STRIKES\nThe deaths of so many Kindred resonate back to the Antediluvians, and before\nlong, the Ancients begin to rise. All of the Ancients start by devouring many of their\ndescendants, along with any other Kindred they can find. The Antediluvians are\nmore than 10 millennia old. Only the blood of fellow vampires can sustain them, and\nonly the vitae of Methuselahs can fully slake an Antediluvian’s thirst.\nOnce they are sated (at least for the moment), they turn their eye to humanity\nand begin conquering as they see fit, using their vast powers and legions of servants\nto summon up armies in the blink of an eye and lay claim over vast regions in mere\nmonths or weeks. Again, this conflict can last as long as the players find it interesting.\nIf they submit immediately to avoid destruction, so be it, but if they wish to continue\non as a guerrilla movement, give them time to continue their efforts.\nThe Withering affects the Ancients, at least somewhat, and renders their power\nless than what it might have been. This is good, at least for the characters, as it means\nthat it is actually conceivable to stand against one of these beings, with sufficient\npower and preparation. They remain some of the mightiest creatures ever to walk the\nWorld of Darkness, however, and when their will is set, Kindred and kine fall before\nthem like grain before the scythe.\nIf not for the elder Kindred’s war to cripple the governments that hunt them,\nhumanity might have won the fight. Reduced in power as they are, the Ancients\ncannot survive massed machine gun fire or thermite bombs fired from two miles\naway. The tattered mortal governments, however, can no longer muster such\ntechnologically advanced firepower. The soldiers destroy a few Methuselahs at first,\nbut the Ancients quickly learn from their mistakes, and before long, any kind of\nsignificant human resistance is stamped out.\nEMPIRES OF BLOOD\nWhen the first Antediluvians begin their reign, the world looks very different\nfrom how it did just a year before.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n45\nCHAPTER TWO\nIn time, the surviving Ancients organize a patchwork of fiefdoms centered on\nthe half-ruined cities. A single Antediluvian or, more often, Methuselah rules the\ncity and surrounding countryside as its prince. Within the cities, mortals labor to\nbuild strong havens for their undead masters and rebuild some of the amenities —\nrunning water, for instance — to which younger Kindred became accustomed.\nAnyone who cannot work in some capacity — because of age, injury, sickness or\nexhaustion — gets thrown in a pen and served to any vampire who feels hungry.\nNaturally, the system is not tightly controlled. Cainites who are not utterly\nsubsumed by an Antediluvian’s will still scheme for favor and chances to diablerize\neach other. The Ancients also show little concern for anything that does not involve\ntheir arcane agendas, their personal security or the food chain, making it possible for\ncautious characters to survive within their territory if they move carefully and do not\nattract the attention of the Ancient one to them directly.\nSome possible examples of the reign of different Antediluvians are provided.\nStorytellers can also reference Gehenna for more information on a specific Antedilu-\nvian, or they can use these cases as a starting point to design their own nightmarish\nscenario. There is very little beyond the power of the Ancients if they truly desire it,\nand that can serve as the fodder for any number of fantastic and terrifying scenarios.\nREIGN OF MALKAV\nKindred mythology includes no tales about the destruction of the Malkavian clan’s\nfounder. A few legends say that Malkav sleeps in a ruined city somewhere in the Middle\nEast, but no one who followed these legends ever found any trace of the Antediluvian.\nMalkav no longer exists as a corporeal entity. Lunacy’s Master retained stronger\nties to its childer than did most Antediluvians. Many times in Kindred history,\nMalkavians displayed an uncanny coordination between their deeds, with no\napparent way for them to communicate. The occasional spontaneous gatherings of\nMalkavians lent further credence to the notion of a “Malkavian Madness Network”\nthat linked the clan. That “network” was nothing less than every Malkavian’s blood-\ntie to their progenitor. Although Malkav slept the torpor of centuries, it watched the\nworld through the eyes of its unknowing progeny.\nSome years ago, various upsets among the Kindred troubled Malkav’s sleep. The\nAncient did not think about what it did; it acted without conscious volition as one\nacts in dreams. Nevertheless, Malkav desired to see through more eyes than usual,\nso it strengthened its bond to its childer. The Ancient indeed placed its entire being\ninto the Madness Network and left the useless husk of its body to crumble away. As\nits founder spread, the clan itself changed. For centuries, Camarilla Malkavians\nlearned Dominate instead of the clan’s ancient Discipline of Dementation. Malkav\nbrought Dementation back to all his childer, whether they wanted it or not.\nMalkav wakes up with the other Antediluvians and tries to subsume all its\nprogeny. Every Malkavian he overcomes becomes a vehicle for his consciousness.\nThe Ancient becomes one mind, one will, which happens to occupy more than\n1,000 bodies at once. Subsumed Lunatics seldom speak, but they can act together\nwith perfect coordination… at least when Malkav wants them to do so.\nTHE QUEST FOR COMPLETION\nSome Malkavians resist their ancestor’s soul-devouring will. Malkav seeks\nthem from an obscure urge to complete itself and unite all its childer. The Ancient\ncan sense its rebel progeny. If one of its bodies wanders near a free Malkavian, it sends\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n46\nthe body to confront the errant Lunatic and subsume it. For a free Malkavian, or\nanyone who learned Dementation or ever diablerized a Lunatic, any meeting with a\nsubsumed Malkavian is a meeting with Malkav itself.\nA subsumed Malkavian can approach a free Malkavian character whenever the\nStoryteller thinks it would make a good story. The Ancient might send one of its bodies\nhundreds or thousands of miles to collect a character. Malkav does not seek its childer\nin an efficient, organized manner, though, and he might miss a character completely.\nAn encounter with subsumed Malkavians should be a chilling experience.\nSome have gotten use to the idea that the Lunatics are harmless or even playful. Now\nhowever, they are of one ancient mind. Your Narrators might need to practice to gain\nthis desired effect, perhaps memorizing certain phrases and practicing turning heads\nand madly grinning in complete unison. Malkav’s direct influence comes and goes,\nbut having a group of Lunatics suddenly snap to attention and turn their focus all to\none player should be enough to unnerve even the most steel-willed Kindred.\nA MADNESS FOR MORTALS\nMalkav also draws mortals into its veil of madness. Like Dementation, this\npower acts without regard for the current strength of Caine’s curse in a vampire.\nMalkav’s mortal victims can work together, though, if the Ancient demands it.\nIndeed, Malkav’s bodies often walk with a retinue of mortals who feed and serve\nit. When Malkav does not need its minions, these mortals howl and gibber, leap\nabout, beat themselves or each other with sticks, feed, couple and sleep when\nthey tire, like beasts. These “bacchantes” are something else the players can\nencounter on a smaller scale in their own setting. A mortal friend or relative\nmight even become one of these cursed creatures, inspiring an effort to depose\ntheir raving master and find some way to restore them to sanity.\nTRIUMPH OF LUCIDITY\nIt’s hard to imagine what could kill a multi-bodied psychic entity like Malkav.\nNevertheless, it is possible, if the characters and their allies are clever and persistent\n— and perhaps just a little bit mad themselves. If they succeed, all Malkavians suffer\nfrom intense fratricidal madness and attempt to wipe each other out, apparently\ndesperate to hide all remaining evidence of what Malkav has done.\nUnless every single clan member is accounted for, however, a shadow of Malkav’s\nhive-mind endures. Pockets of coordinated activity might remain for quite some time,\nrequiring thorough cleansing to ensure that no more lunatic kings emerge in the dark\ncorners of the world. Bands of bacchantes stay together as well, their minds permanently\nlost regardless of the outcome of the great battle. While truly potent Disciplines or inspired\nroleplaying might offer some hope to these poor souls, most are doomed to endless madness.\nTruly sadistic Storytellers might even allow characters to believe they have\nended the threat, only to have it begin festering anew in the cracks of sanity, slowly\nrebuilding once more…\nREIGN OF LASOMBRA\nFor centuries, Lasombra vampires boasted of how they destroyed their clan’s\nfounder in the Anarch Revolt. Gratiano, the Antediluvian’s youngest childe, led a\nstrike force of Lasombra and Assamites into his sire’s vast Sicilian fortress… and then\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n47\nCHAPTER TWO\nthe stories become a little vague. Some ascribe the Ancient’s diablerie to Gratiano,\nwho took his sire’s place in the Third Generation. Others say that an Assamite\ncompleted the deed, though many Cainites feasted on the Antediluvian’s vitae.\nSome Sabbat find these contradictions disquieting. After all, the Ancient’s\ndiablerie had plenty of witnesses, and it wasn’t that long ago, as Cainites reckon such\nthings. These Sabbat remember that the Lasombra gifts include the power to twist\nthoughts and alter memories. They worry that the Lasombra Antediluvian used his\nchilde to fake his own destruction.\nConcurrent with the waning of the Curse of Caine, something emerges\nunbidden from the Abyss. This formless creature of darkness seeks out the Lasombra.\nIt speaks to them in the voice of a destroyed sire, rival, childe or other clanmate.\nAlthough the shadow-creature begins its feeding with the younger and weaker\nmembers of the clan, it hunts Lasombra elders soon enough. The reigns of other\nAntediluvians, if any others have risen in the chronicle, apparently concern it not\nat all, at least not at first.\nAs the world crumbles under the onslaught of the Ancients’ battles for control,\ndarkness covers the entire world. No light penetrates the inky shroud. Deprived of\nthe sun, the Earth grows cold. White snow drifts down from the black sky. Leaves\nturn crisp and dead beneath lacy frost. The lakes and rivers freeze more slowly, but\nin a few days, a rime of ice covers them as well. The flowers, insects, birds and animals\nof summer are the first to die. As the cold sweeps into the tropics, creatures that never\nfelt winter shiver and die. Humanity resists as best it can. Where the power grid\nremains intact, generators hum and lights shine against the darkness. Less fortunate\npeople huddle around fireplaces and light candles. The people who remain in cities\nare hit the hardest. Few among their undead masters care very much.\nNaturally, vampires and other literal creatures of darkness exult in this time,\nemerging to slake their lusts on a world helpless to stop them. Surviving Lasombra\nlead this effort, capturing wide swaths of territory in the name of the darkness, but\nall vampires might find themselves caught up in the frenzy of activity as their most\nancient and implacable foe is removed from the sky. Some more humane Kindred\nmight seek out a confrontation with the Ancient in hopes of sparing the world utter\ndestruction. Indeed, after a suitable chase, it might even allow them to think that\nthey are the ones to “defeat” it and return light to the world.\nReversal of Fortune\nAfter three weeks of darkness (or however long the characters take to finish\ntheir plan and confront the creature), lightning flashes in the sky and thunder booms\nin the darkness. A mighty wind rises as the sky slowly brightens, roils and turns red.\nCurtains of scarlet drops descend and a hurricane of blood lashes the world. An hour\nlater, the ruddy clouds break and the true sky becomes visible once more. Naturally,\nif the players actually mustered the courage to hunt the Ancient, these events could\nbe the apparent result of their efforts to destroy the creature, perhaps even the last\nthing one of the mortally wounded group sees before going on to Final Death.\nAs suddenly as it began, the Reign of Lasombra is apparently ended.\nOr has it? While the pall of night has dispersed, it’s entirely possible that it has\ndone so precisely because that’s what the Ancient desires. It has engineered its own\napparent destruction before, after all. This sudden reversal should not be presented as\na “happily ever after” moment, but rather, a cause for increased paranoia. Why did the\nAncient release its grip on the world? Is it destroyed? Did it achieve some unseen end\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n48\nin the time it blocked the sun, and let go because control was no longer necessary? Will\nit re-form and return from the Abyss in some new shape, or is it gone forever?\nEven if the players believe they have successfully defeated the Ancient, a\ncunning Storyteller can keep them jumping at, well, shadows for quite some time,\nnever quite sure whether the darkness is looking back.\nREIGN OF GANGREL\nNoddist legends name the Gangrel founder Ennoia, but as with all the\nAntediluvians, almost nothing is really known about the First Gangrel. Every student\nof Cainite myth agrees, however, that the Gangrel owe their unique aptitude for the\nProtean Discipline to their founder, who surely must have been its greatest master.\nMore than a millennium ago, Ennoia began her transformation from Cainite to\nsomething more. She sank into the earth, deeper than any other Cainite could\nimagine. She spread her substance further, thinner, touching the rocks at the roots\nof mountains and hearing the tolling of earthquakes.\nShe sank deeper still, century after century, learning the slow dreams of the drifting\ncontinents and feeling the vast tides and currents that propel them. She sank into the\nrealms where hot stone flows like water and was not burned; for Fortitude was another gift\nto her clan. She spread and sank until she reached the very heart of the planet.\nEnnoia did not lose all her connection to the Cainite race, though. The battles of the\nAntediluvians and the ruination of their childer troubled the geologic dreams of Ennoia.\nShe woke up hungry.\nTHE DEVOURING EARTH\nBest paired with a scenario involving the rising of at least one other Antediluvian,\nthe Reign of Gangrel spells final doom for many would-be rulers. The Kindred,\nespecially the remaining Methuselahs and Antediluvians, still dwell in the crumbling\nA STEADY DIET OF NOTHINGNESS\nLasombra characters might encounter the shadow-creature that their ances-\ntor has become any time after Gehenna begins. The creature tries to absorb them\njust as other Antediluvians try to subsume their childer. Any being who is slain by\nthe shadow-creature is immediately embraced by the Ancient’s oozing shadows\nand utterly consumed, leaving no shred of physical evidence behind. It requires no\ntest to hit unless the Storyteller feels it is dramatically appropriate to allow one, and\nit typically inflicts at least three health levels of aggravated damage per strike.\nOne can attack the shadow-creature, though most strikes do little good. The\nAncient draws on the infinite power of the Abyss — nothing known to Cainites\ncan destroy it. At best, characters can force it back to the Abyss by exposing the\nshadow-creature to true sunlight, or by attacking it with fire. At the Storyteller’s\ndiscretion, more esoteric Thaumaturgy or obscure Paths might also have some\neffect. Indeed, finding a suitable “lost ritual” to harm the creature or send it back\nto the Abyss might make a good story to give the players hope when battling the\nAncient. The creature vanishes and then dissipates once the total damage from\nwhatever sunlight or fire effects the characters inflict upon it exceeds 20 health\nlevels. The shadow-creature has more important things to do than strike back at\nfeisty childer, so it will seek easier prey elsewhere. But it will remember…\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n49\nCHAPTER TWO\ncities, and Ennoia wants their vitae. She sucks whole city blocks into the earth to\ndevour one Methuselah, and skyscrapers topple from the shaking. Each time Ennoia\nclaims another victim, the result is a powerful but localized earthquake… usually in the\nheart of a major metropolitan area. She feeds only at night — a relic of her Cainite past.\nAround the world, city after city collapses into final ruin as she inexorably seeks out\nher prey. Storytellers may even use Ennoia’s activity to indirectly aid characters\nsuffering under the rule of another Ancient. While the Antediluvian struggles to put\nan end to these strange attacks, the characters might find freedom to take the actions\nthey must in order to depose the Ancient and restore their own form of order.\nCharacters will likely first learn of the threat when they find themselves in the\nsame vicinity as a target elder when Ennoia feeds. They have a chance to escape, but\nmore astute characters should realize that such is the case only because they are not\nthe targets of her attack. For dramatic effect, in fact, this scene works best if the\ncharacter is free to run. The point is to show a scene of awful, apocalyptic destruction\nwithout killing a player’s character. From that point on, once they hear other reports\nand begin putting pieces together, it might be possible for those who become aware\nof what is happening to try to hunt down Ennoia and put an end to her predation.\nWithout some serious magic and some very clever planning, however, chances are\ngood that the only thing the characters do is attract her eye and find the ground\nopening into a lava-filled maw under their own feet one night. After all, how does\none fight the earth itself, much less defeat it?\nFortunately for the characters, Ennoia does not continue her hunt forever regardless\nof their actions — just until the battles of the Ancients no longer trouble her. Exactly what\nthis means remains up to the Storyteller to decide, although it is strongly recommended that\nthey not depict Ennoia as some kind of “avenging angel” who kills only “evil” elders. While\nthere should be a pattern to her attacks for those wise enough to discover it, Ennoia is beyond\nsuch things as good and evil at this point. Once sated, she returns to sleep, waiting until her\nhunger spurs her to action again. As with many other Antediluvians, unless they manage\nto confront Ennoia directly and have some way of determining that she is truly destroyed,\nthe characters will likely never really know if or when the Reign of Gangrel ends. Therefore,\nGangrel characters never suffer the fratricidal madness caused by an Antediluvian\nforebear’s destruction, but the First Gangrel also never subsumes the will of any of her\ndescendants. They are loners to the end.\nNIGHTSHADE\nAll over the world, ancient beings begin to awake. Some are known in legend\nas the Third Generation of vampires, the Antediluvians. Others are so obscured by\nthe passage of time that history’s annals have long forgotten them. One by one, the\nAncients slowly rise from their torpor, and they cry out in hunger for the blood of\ntheir childer. The Methuselahs are first to awaken, and they pick up the strings to\ntheir childer where they left them.\nThe impact of the psychic disturbance caused as a result of the rise of these\nprimeval creatures impacts every single Cainite in the world. But not only vampires\nfeel it. Ghouls, Lupines, sorcerers and other beings with supernatural awareness of\nsorts, including many psychic (or irrevocably insane) mortals, are also affected. The\nWeek of Nightmares saw something similar as the Ravnos Antediluvian awoke.\n“Nightshade” is not set to any particular timeline or dates of events. The Storyteller\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n50\ncan advance the story in the time it takes the characters to do what they need, so that\nshe can run the scenario to fit whatever prearranged plans she has, as with a plan to\nuse this scenario as the end to a long-running chronicle.\nUnlike “Crucible of God,” which deals largely with struggling under the reign of the\nAntediluvians, “Nightshade” focuses more on one particular arc of desperation, redemp-\ntion and triumph. While elements of the two scenarios can certainly be combined, it is\nbest to remember that one is more focused on the world and global events, while the other\nultimately boils down to a willingness to make right what has been wrong for so very long.\nAROUND THE WORLD BY NIGHT\nThe events of this vision of Gehenna take the characters to exotic locations\nto meet powerful and potent creatures of the night (and kill quite a few of them).\nAs a Storyteller you may be asking yourself, “Am I going to have to narrate my\nentire story as the characters trot around the globe? How do I handle these events\nthat are taking place in regard to my chronicle’s hometown with my players?”\nDon’t panic. For one thing, even if some of the events take place on a global scale\nand are not centered around your chronicle’s events, their echoes will be felt no\nmatter where your players are. Not everything needs to land on their doorstep\nfor it to be part of this scenario. If they do go to chase after it, do your best to\nportray the variety of settings and Narrator characters as well as possible,\npotentially holding such trips as side sessions before calling the characters back\nto their home city again for the regular game. This can be a great roleplaying\nopportunity if the characters wind up splitting into several different “hunting\nteams” and going after different targets. Even just seeing who survived to make\nit back to the city at the next game can be a powerful roleplaying lure.\nIf that’s not your speed, it’s very easy to tailor some of the global events of this\nscenario so that one or two are centered around your setting, putting your players on\nthe world stage before they can prepare for it, playing hosts to history. Even just one\nof the major events of this scenario can be more than enough for a city of Kindred\nto handle. Combined with other terrifying events going on in the background, a true\nsense of the panic and confusion of the End Times is easy to create. After all, while\nthe scenario as written involves hunting down several Antediluvians, there’s no\nreason your entire endgame couldn’t involve the characters trying to take down a\nsingle Ancient that has arisen in their general vicinity. (It’s not like one Antedilu-\nvian and its minions can’t cause more than enough trouble to pose a long-running,\nmulti-level threat to even a high-powered chronicle, after all!) As always, take what\nyou find here and tailor it to your own chronicle.\nGETTING THE PLAYERS INVOLVED\nA Storyteller can involve the troupe in “Nightshade” in many different ways.\nWhile the story has been written for Camarilla-based chronicles first and foremost,\nthis is only by default. Given the nature of the events of this scenario and the\nimplications it has for all vampires — indeed, the entire world — it shouldn’t be too\ndifficult to involve the Sabbat, or even the most standoffish independent clans and\napathetic anarchs. An equally esteemed leader from the other sects can replace\nPieterzoon — be it a Narrator character unique to the game or a more established\ncharacter such as Sascha Vykos for the Sabbat or Jeremy MacNeil for the anarchs.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n51\nCHAPTER TWO\nThat being said, it is recommended that the rising of the Ancients be heralded by\nsome of the “common” events found in the storytelling section, such as earthquakes,\nplagues and wars. Not only does doing so put players in the proper frame of mind for\nGehenna, but it also makes the appearance of the Ancients feel like it has been a long\ntime coming, rather than simply being the latest surprise the Storyteller felt like unveiling\nto keep the session interesting. Unless presented in suitably atmospheric context, the\nawakening of even one Antediluvian can seem melodramatic and overdone\nTHE FIEND RISING\nOn two different continents, the Tzimisce Antediluvian awakens. One half is\na soulless monstrosity — the corpse of an ancient undead, living only because of the\nVicissitude that its body is marked by. The other half is little more than a malignant\npresence. (What it is driven by is impossible to say.) The Antediluvian corpse in\nNew York City sustains itself by absorbing any living thing it manages to capture, and\nthose that are not made part of it are left shambling and hungry for the essence of\nlife, with no mind to guide them. The growing monster first breaks through the\nunderbelly of New York City, and then crashes through to street level. This signals\nthe beginning of the nightmares that plague the world.\nThe Camarilla is made aware of the horrors in New York, but at this point, no one\nknows that it is, in fact, an Antediluvian. Jan Pieterzoon, well-known enforcer of the\nCamarilla, arrives and explains that he has been charged by the Inner Council to gather\na group of Kindred to go to New York and find out what this new threat might be. No\none actually knows what is happening over there. Parts of the city have been shut down,\nand the Camarilla is working in overdrive in covering it up. If Storytellers wish to take\nthis route, your troupe could be part of the coterie that Pieterzoon takes into New York.\nThis would take special preparation and narration to carry off successfully, but your\nplayers would have a front seat to the epic battle. Be warned, though, that this battle could\neasily result in the Final Death of more than a few vampires.\nThere can be any number of reasons why the troupe is chosen. Perhaps other capable\nKindred are responding to other threats elsewhere (dealing with the natural disasters and\nfending off the assaults of the other sects and clans that take advantage of them), and the\ncharacters make up the only qualified group ready to go. Perhaps some of the characters\nare still riding the notoriety of defeating some other dire threat in the recent past, while\nanother group of characters might have a special magical item or rare Thaumaturgy ritual\nthat the Inner Circle believes could be vital to the success of the operation. Maybe a\npowerful ally or mentor has recommended them for the job as a favor — this is an\nimportant task, after all, with great potential rewards and Status if they succeed. Perhaps\nconversely a hated rival has suggested them in hopes that they will back down and lose\nface, embarrass themselves in the field or even meet Final Death.\nTailor these reasons to your story based upon the strengths of your characters. Try\nto involve as many characters as possible too. Those who don’t fight directly can still\ngo and act as scouts and researchers, or maybe spin doctors and media control. Don’t\nmake the players feel that they are chosen just because they are your players. Once the\nscene is set up for your troupe, however, it should be made clear to the players that this\nis not an offer to be refused — it is a duty their characters are expected to perform.\nCONSEQUENCES\nTruth be told, the actual battle itself can take as long and be as vivid as you\ndesire. If the characters are very combat-oriented, feel free to play up every moment\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n52\nof the melee, but if they’re more interested in this as a political opportunity, you can\nplay down the blow-by-blow somewhat. Make no mistake, it should be a hard and\nhorrifying fight, as they are essentially fighting a giant entity of liquid flesh with the\npower to change shape at will and absorb others into itself whole to replenish itself.\nIt is essentially mindless, though, so it is vulnerable to good strategy — not to\nmention strong Disciplines and heavy firepower.\nAs Pieterzoon and the surviving characters stagger through Manhattan after-\nward, wounded and tired, with a mere hour before the sun rises, they start noticing the\ncrowds that have gathered at different places through the city. And above them hang\nthe big screens of Times Square, showing what the coterie has just been through, on\nCNN’s continuous broadcast. They see themselves at the heights of their Discipline\nusage, frantically using every last bit of their vampiric powers as they struggle to defeat\nthe monster. This is one surreal scene, and it should be described in painstaking detail.\nThese vampires are responsible for breaking the Masquerade on a worldwide scale.\nThe world has watched as frenzying vampires have battled an unspeakable evil\non the streets of New York at night. The Masquerade is broken — no, beyond\nbroken, it is shattered into fine dust on the wind. Camarilla elders from all over the\nworld race to New York to try to fix the damage, but it is too late. All the Influence\non Earth cannot take back what the world has seen.\nNATIONS IN FLUX\nGovernments around the world respond quickly to the information. When it\nbecomes obvious that they won’t be able to dismiss this as a hoax, most begin an\naggressive command-and-control strategy to “contain the undead threat.” In the\nUnited States and across most of Europe, emergency laws are passed requiring vampires\nto register with the authorities or face arrest and possible destruction. Those who resist\nare summarily hunted and destroyed with all the power the government can muster.\nInitial confrontations favor the Kindred, but the mortals learn quickly, and with the\nstrength of numbers and technology behind them, the tide quickly turns to the point\nwhere even the most powerful undead must run and hide rather than risk an open fight.\nThis wave of global change is not so much a single scene as a series of events played\nout over a few panicked sessions. At least a few of the more brazen or incautious characters\n(not to mention any who went with Pieterzoon) should face the intense scrutiny of the\nnew hunting agencies, while others might have a chance to use their Influences and other\nBackgrounds to try to keep their own city from turning into a deathtrap. While they\nmight not be able to restore the Masquerade on a global scale, they shouldn’t feel nearly\nas powerless on a local level. Many other events can be related to your players through\nin-character downtime, especially news updates or word of distant hunts.\nDon’t drag this time out so long that the players grow tired of always running\nand hiding, but make sure that the full weight of what has happened sinks in. The\nworld has changed, and that shouldn’t be a casual thing. After all, it’s likely that at\nleast a few of the characters went with Jan on that fateful mission, and becoming the\nfirst people in the world famed for their vampirism should offer a number of\ninteresting roleplaying opportunities.\nREVELATION\nIf your characters were with Pieterzoon, then the following scene is something\nthat the troupe should actively take part in. Otherwise, your characters should hear\nabout what has taken place through fellow vampires.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n53\nCHAPTER TWO\nPieterzoon and those with him in New York are summoned to a Camarilla safe\nhouse, where it is revealed that the Antediluvians are, in fact, rising once again.\nPieterzoon is furious at the revelation that was kept from him and most of the\nCamarilla, but he is resolved to oppose these ancient undead even at this late hour. He\nstorms out of the meeting, swearing to make right the lie he has believed for so long.\nCONVENTION OF FIRE\nCainites from all over the world begin arriving for the Convention of Fire that Jan\nhas called. If the characters went with him to New York, he might even call the\nconvention in their city, since facing the same judgment is likely to have made them allies\nif not exactly good friends. For the time being at least, it would seem that Pieterzoon’s\nconvention is the one collective with the most control over its subjects. It accepts only\nthose who display a true commitment to breaking the hold of the Camarilla and the\nSabbat, learning the truth and saving the world from the Ancients. Obviously, it’s no easy\ntask dividing those who are in it only to save their skin from those with true commitment,\nbut most seem to work together, with only minor discrepancies.\nThis radical sub-sect of the Camarilla is to be administered by a council of 12\nvampires, and Pieterzoon, its leader. Pieterzoon is a very just and righteous Cainite,\nand it is generally agreed upon that he will make a fit leader. Rest assured that he will\nonly make executive decisions whenever the council is unable to reach an agree-\nment, and that the council is in effect the main body of management.\nPieterzoon’s suggestion for a name for the sect is the Nephtali, which has\nBiblical significance and literally means “the highest point” or “no further,” used in\nprohibiting an advance or encroachment. In this sense, Pieterzoon intends it as a\npointed reference to how Gehenna shall be stopped, allowed no longer.\nRETURN OF THE DRAGON\nIn Europe, the newly formed Nephtali sub-sect receives a visitor — Etrius, the\nchilde of Tremere, and one-time member of the Tremere Council of Seven. He bears\nthe news that some time ago, the body of Tremere himself, having lain dormant in\nthe crypts beneath the clan’s Vienna chantry, disappeared. No one knew where it\nmight have gone, but most are certain that the Founder himself was not behind the\ndisappearance. A massive search was undertaken, proving fruitless, and an immi-\nnent crisis could have been at hand. Then, a few nights ago, the body of Tremere\nreappeared on the doorstep of the chantry. First there was rejoicing, for the Warlocks\nthought that their Founder had returned. They were very wrong.\nThe being in the form of Tremere went rampant, calling on powers beyond any\nthat were familiar to the Tremere, and it killed all the members of the chantry\nwithout discrimination. Only Etrius managed to flee to relative safety, but only after\nlearning what was happening. The being occupying the body of Tremere was none\nother than the Tzimisce Antediluvian, having somehow “materialized” in Tremere’s\nbody. After killing all Tremere, and most likely many other vampires in Vienna, it\nleft a trail of death and terror behind, moving toward the clan’s head Transylvanian\nchantry of the Tremere, Ceoris. Etrius followed it part of the way, but as it started\nto warp and transform into something best described as a giant, dragon-like monster,\nhe finally lost his nerve and escaped to seek help. No matter what the characters\nmight feel about the Tremere or the Tzimisce in general, this situation seems fairly\nclear-cut. The beast must be stopped before it gains whatever additional power it is\nseeking in the chantry and becomes effectively unkillable.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n54\nEven if your characters are not there to witness the eventual confrontation, the\neffects of it can be felt elsewhere. Characters of Tremere and Tzimisce blood will be\ncaught in the conflict of their founders. Should any of your players’ characters be of\neither of these bloodlines, they will be forced to make Self-Control/Instinct Chal-\nlenges once every hour for the night of the conflict. Success means that they can\nresist the urges to violence they are channeling through their respective Antediluvians.\nFailure means that they will immediately seek out any members of the opposing clan\nand attempt to destroy them by any means. Spending a Willpower Trait allows a\ncharacter to resist this urge for one hour. This blood haze will continue until the\nfollowing day, when both Antediluvians are dead.\nEven those who remain at home are not spared part of the horror — they will have\nto hold their city together as Tremere and Tzimisce alike rampage through the streets,\ncaught up in the bloodlust of their founders. Sabbat war parties may try to take advantage\nof the rage of their pack mates and call upon former Camarilla cities. Anyone who had\na grudge against either clan will most likely also use this time to take revenge.\n...AND THERE SHALL COME A SAVIOR\nNot long after the Tremere and Tzimisce destroy each other, a strange collection\nof artifacts comes into the possession of the Nephtali — a number of black stones\ninscribed with strange runes that seem to speak of the history of the Children of Caine\nfrom the beginning all the way through the current disaster. After careful consider-\nation, it is concluded that the stones of Enoch speak of one of the Thirteen accepting\nthe burden of all Children of Caine, saving them from the fires of Purgatory and the\nwrath of God. The “gentle one” as it is called, will die at the hands of another but rise\nagain in a form marked by the End Times, without memory. Those who would stand\nagainst the end will bring him forth, and he will eventually save everyone.\nWhatever sense the characters themselves get from this, Noddists can lend light\nto some parts of the fragment. The “gentle one” is a reference to Saulot, the mysterious\nprogenitor of the now-extinct Salubri bloodline. Those who would stand against the\nend could easily be a prediction of the Nephtali, and, by extension, the characters.\nEtrius of the Tremere undertakes the task of locating Saulot’s current resting\nplace if none of the characters are especially skilled in Thaumaturgy. The ritual first\nperformed over a map of the world, and substituted with more detailed region maps\nas it advances, allowing them to find a fairly good match. Starting out with an atlas\nand moving on to satellite photographs ultimately obtains a match: an isolated\nresearch center outside Sydney, Australia.\nREBIRTH\nTraveling to the research center should be fairly straightforward, and as they\napproach, the characters notice that it has been abandoned and locked down,\napparently for months. The search should not be very long, but after a while the\ncharacters find a confined, restricted area. They don’t need to force their way inside,\nthough — it is open. A quick search turns up a separated room housing a sleeping child,\nbut this sleep is clearly not natural. The records explain that although the child\ndisplayed every sign of being in good physical shape, it has been comatose from birth.\nThe child possesses the soul of Saulot, who unknowingly possessed this form\nafter he became incorporeal when the Dragon assumed his borrowed form. When his\nawakened self was rendered unconscious from the blow, his powerful soul subcon-\nsciously hurled itself through the vast space of the spiritual realm, to the only suitable\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n55\nCHAPTER TWO\nbody in the world it could inhabit without struggle. Now Saulot has reawakened, but\nwithout the memories of his life, in the body of a six year-old boy.\nWhen the characters finally approach Saulot, his eyes fly open and he asks\nthem, “Who are you? What is this place? What did those people want?” And then,\nno matter what the characters say or do, his forehead splits open to reveal a third eye,\ndeveloping from nothing right in front of their eyes. If nothing else, that should\nconvince them that this is indeed Saulot.\nThe characters return with the child, to find the Nephtali in as much turmoil\nand trouble as is true of the rest of the world. Many of the members of the council\nhave taken to bitter argument over what the goals of the organization are, some\nfavoring petty revenge over the rest of the Camarilla, some the accumulation of\nknowledge, and others taking action to prevent Gehenna.\nJUDGMENT\nWhile the characters were off securing Saulot and possibly putting out other fires,\nthe researchers who are still left at the Nephtali headquarters have been going through\nall the material and objects that the characters and other members have gathered.\nThey have discovered that a phial recently recovered from long-lost Mesopotamian\nruins is one of many artifacts that one of the Ancients gathered for unknown reasons\nback in the time of the Second City. The phial contains some sort of Cainite blood\nsample, but when extracted and tested, it aggressively absorbs Blood Traits.\nOne of the more careless researchers had attempted to swig a bit of the blood,\nhoping it would grant him power over the waning of the Curse, but he immediately\nmet Final Death for doing so, leaving behind only a pulp of ashes and blood. No one\nelse has dared to intimately experiment with the vitae since then.\nTHE VEIL OF DARKNESS\nAfter giving the characters just enough time to investigate the mysterious phial\nand ponder what it might mean, they awaken after a day of horrible dreams to find\nthe world in panic — the sun has been blocked by a strange, shadowy object. From\nthat time on, vampires do not suffer from being awake at day. They still lose one\nBlood Trait per every 24 hours, but the sun is not present to force them into their\ndaily sleep. Horror ensues on the streets around the world, as more and more\nvampires abuse the advantages they have over mortals. Governments topple, cities\nbreak down, and infrastructures crumble and die.\nEveryone feels it, mortal and Cainite alike. There is something terrible within\nthe darkness that veils the land. In every dark corner, in every deep wood, in every\ncave and under every bed, there is something there — a presence. And in the skies,\none star takes the attention away from all the others: A bright, red one, nearly as big\nas the moon. It is just as unnerving as the unnatural eclipse.\nEXODUS\nAlthough the characters will likely have their hands full dealing with the\nincreased vampire activity of the extended eclipse and the total terror that has\nengulfed human society, circumstances beyond their control conspire to dictate a\nmore sudden resolution to their problems — indeed, the problems of vampires\neverywhere. Mere days after the disappearance of the sun, a strange urge begins\ncalling the undead toward a distant, unknown land. Although this call can initially\nbe pushed aside with a simple Self-Control/Instinct Challenge, it eventually requires\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n56\na Willpower Trait per night until the Kindred finally runs out of Willpower or\nchooses to submit to the urge.\nThis is the final stage of the End Times. Now the Ancients have gathered at\nGehenna and are calling their childer to them.\nGEHENNA, THE LAST CITY\n“Gehenna” is synonymous with “Place of Torment.” Strictly geographically\nspeaking, it is the Valley of Hinnom, southwest of Jerusalem. During the weeks\nfollowing the destruction of the Masquerade, elder vampires started gathering\naround this place, offering their childer as sacrifices in the hope that the Antediluvians\nwould spare them. They dared not diablerize these victims, instead releasing their\nsouls through fire. The pits have burned continuously day and night as countless\nvampires meet fiery Final Deaths. All night long, the sounds of the lamentation of\nthese elders and the screams of their childer have endured. All day no sound but the\ncrackling fires being maintained by mortal retainers could be heard.\nHere the Antediluvians have come, casting down their would-be appeasers\nwithout pity or remorse while assuming the mantle of power that they once held.\nThey have taken residence in the citadel, as it is still being constructed. They hold\na precious truce with each other, gathering their underlings to them, waiting in\npatience as they build their reign of terror. From here they shall rule for a thousand\nyears, for so it is written in The Book of Nod.\nAnd then Caine shall return to lay down his judgment.\nARMIES OF DARKNESS\nThe Antediluvians have stopped their childer from destroying their younger.\nInstead, they have ordered more vampires to be created, to make their armies larger, to\nbetter rule the world. It should be pointed out that the Antediluvians are all mad, and\nthat they do not consider the consequences of what they are doing. In addition, this is\nnot their world. They see nothing wrong with reshaping it into what will be their reign.\nIn truth, though, one can safely assume that each Antediluvian has its own\nplans of conquest and dominion. Each wishes the others dead so that it can rule\nalone, and to that end, each amasses an army of undead, ostensibly to conquer the\nworld, but also to check the power of and ultimately destroy its siblings. It is into this\nterrible place that the characters must eventually travel, drawn by the power of those\nwhose blood made their own unlife possible so long ago. And they know they will\ncome as criminals, those who would defy the Ancients and seek to undo them, and\nthat they can expect little mercy for their “crimes” against the founders.\nThey also possess two secrets the Antediluvians have not counted on, however,\nwhich could be the undoing of the Ancients — a phial of ancient vitae and Saulot reborn.\nIf none of the characters realize that bringing both of those things might do something\nto even the odds, have Etrius or another prominent Narrator character suggest it.\nLAST RITES\nUpon arrival, the characters and any others who have worked against the\nAntediluvians in the past are led through the streets of the Last City as criminals.\nAll around them swirl groups of other Kindred and Cainites who have sworn to serve\nthe Antediluvians, watching them mostly in silence, with the occasional insult or\nthrown object the only measure of their attention. The characters are thrown into\na cell by themselves. They should have to do some last-minute explaining to be\nallowed to keep Saulot with them, but unless they botch things horribly the\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n57\nCHAPTER TWO\nunsuspecting guards allow it. If something does occur, Saulot can be kept with Jan\nor Etrius and reunited with the characters during the climactic scene.\nStorytellers are encouraged to allow this final “night” in prison to take up most\nif not all of a game session. It can be a powerful time for characters to say their good-\nbyes to each other and take stock of what they have done, as well as test their resolve\nas they watch the horrors going on outside. If Saulot is with them, they might have\nto alternately comfort the child and be comforted by him. He seems curiously calm\nat times, as though he has been expecting this moment for many years. Those who\nhave been kind to him or simply zealous in their efforts to stop the Antediluvians\nreceive an additional benefit at this time, though they might not suspect what it is\nright away. Saulot traces the Hebrew word for “light” on their forehead with dust or\nash, telling them that the inevitable will be painful, but that life will prevail.\nZENITH\nAfter spending many hours in prison, the characters are at last brought to the\ncenter of the city, where the Antediluvians have gathered around a great basalt throne.\nIt is highly recommended that meeting so many beings as powerful as the Antediluvians\nbe as elliptical yet memorable as possible — it is nigh-impossible for even an\nexperienced undead mind to process the experience of directly meeting one of the\nAncients, let alone many of them. Some of the Ancients should be present as little\nmore than raw description, such as a nebulous shadow of Lasombra or a buzzing mental\npresence for Malkav, while those that the characters directly encounter be portrayed\nas Narrator characters as elaborately costumed and prepared as possible.\nThis is it — what the characters say and do here will decide their own fates as well\nas the fate of the world as a whole. It is probably a good idea to set the tone of the scene\nby having at least one of the Narrator characters with them immediately be given a\nbrief “trial” and put to death in gruesome fashion. Doing so underscores the power and\nwickedness the characters are up against, as well as discouraging them from being\nflippant or otherwise foolishly squandering their own unlives when they approach the\nAncients. Once that has been finished, the Antediluvians turn their attention to the\ncharacters and begin questioning them about what they have done, probing them for\ninformation about the modern world, taunting them with the prospect of their\nimminent deaths and otherwise enjoying the power they have recently regained.\nFortunately, there are several things working in the characters’ favor during this\nscene. First, the Ancients don’t really consider them a threat, at least not directly,\nso they are overconfident enough to let them make the first move in a conflict.\nSecond, it might be possible to goad the Ancients into destroying each other by\nplaying on their personal feuds and paranoia, but this shouldn’t be easy. (Even then\nthe characters are still left with at least one Ancient they must deal with along with\nits followers.) Lastly, if the characters have developed their own plan or proposal\nthey believe will save the world, let them try it here and judge its potential for success\nbased on the quality of their planning and their execution of it. (A simple “Get ’em!”\nis a notably poor plan for slaying vampiric demigods from the dawn of time.) If the\nplan is plausible, the players have worked hard on it and the execution is deserving,\nlet them have their victory, even if the cost is high. It’s their chronicle, after all.\nIf the characters have nothing convincing to say or nothing else has worked,\nSaulot will step forward and attempt to confront the Antediluvians about the error of\ntheir ways and the need for them to turn their backs on the course they have chosen.\nStorytellers are encouraged to let the characters do as much as possible before letting\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n58\nSaulot take center stage, however. After all, watching Narrators duke it out for the big\nfinish robs the players of their role as the center of the chronicle. While the debate goes\non, Etrius or another learned character leans over and suggests using the phial. Saulot\nsadly agrees with this plan, having hoped the Ancients would see salvation on their\nown, but he tells the characters that this victory will not come cheaply. At least one\nof them must drink the vitae within, and suffer the consequences.\nIf no one volunteers, Saulot will do it, although most characters should definitely\nlose a Humanity Trait for dooming a small child to a painful death. He (or some other)\nstrides forward and drinks the contents of the phial as the Ancients watch, stunned,\nrecognizing too late what the characters have brought with them. Those who drink the\nvitae are immediately wracked with horrible pain and convulsions, but before the\nAncients can do much to react, a shaft of sunlight pierces the sky and illuminates the area,\ncausing pain and fear but not true damage to all present, including the Antediluvians.\nA presence that is at once a deity, a voice and a thunderclap enters the minds of those\nwho drank from the phial, asking if they are willing to atone for the cursed Children of\nCaine. If they respond in the affirmative, events proceed as outlined here. If they respond\nin the negative, they are burned to ash but Saulot’s answer will save the world.\nAssuming Saulot or at least one of the characters accepts the agreement to\natone, the basalt throne explodes in a supernova-like burst of true divine light.\n(Fortitude, including Aegis, offers no protection or reduction for this damage.) As\none, the howling Antediluvians are burned to ash and cinders, as are any vampires\nwithin 100 feet. The characters and any others who received the mark of light from\nSaulot the night before still suffer five levels of aggravated sunlight damage, and will\nhave a scar from the experience for the rest of their unlives. Those who drank from\nthe phial are also incinerated, but it is a gentle dissolution as opposed to an agonizing\nconflagration, and they die with their spirits at peace.\nAssuming the characters survive this final explosion, there is nothing but\nsilence. There is a valley full of vampires not quite sure what happened, but the thrall\nof the Antediluvians is gone. In a few moments, the effects of their severed\nbloodlines start sinking in for the crowd, and the frenzy of diablerie begins again,\nthough the characters remain curiously immune from this madness. In a few hours,\nthe sun rises once more.\nAFTERMATH\nIf the characters escape the chaos, they are free to do whatever they wish. The\nworld lies in ruins, but humanity has a strange way of recovering from such dire straits,\nand it will likely do so again. Vampires have it worse. Caine’s curse is still Withering,\nand at an alarming rate now. Older vampires are dying, and it seems as though most\nhave as little as weeks left before the Curse of Caine weakens so much that their bodies\ncan no longer subsist. The exact time frame depends on the Storyteller’s wishes, but\nthe characters should know what it is (perhaps through Thaumaturgy rituals or Auspex\nscrying). They should have enough time to say their good-byes, put their affairs in order\nand otherwise make peace with the world before the final stages of the reversion claim\nthem. After all, any characters who have survived to this point have more than earned\na chance to die with dignity at the very least.\nAs the curse of vampirism leaves their bodies, Cainites become mortal once\nmore, but those who have lived beyond their natural life span age and die in the\nprocess. Those who are still within their own life span can possibly survive the\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n59\nCHAPTER TWO\ntransformation, but typically gain at least a few applicable Flaws or Negative Traits\nreflecting the physical stress of the reversion. Ghouls and revenants suffer the same\nfate as a vampire of their age would. Curiously enough, while dhampirs also lose all\naccess to Disciplines and any powers related to the Blood (regeneration, extended\nlife span, boosting Attributes, etc.), they all gain the Merit: Perceive Vampires, or\nrather individuals that once were vampires. Whether this means they are destined\nto chronicle the fantastic events those beings have seen or just finish the job is a\nmatter best left to the future and the Storyteller’s desires.\nWhat’s more, at the Storyteller’s discretion, vampires who have achieved Golconda,\npossess True Faith or have even just maintained a very high Humanity through all of their\nstruggles might become mortal again. They do so without aging or suffering other ill\neffects at all, as though a higher power is giving them a second chance at the life that was\ninterrupted so long ago. Unless very good cause exists to do so, however, this blessing\nshould not apply to vampires with low Humanity or any who follow a Path other than\nHumanity. While scrupulous adherence to such other codes might earn a follower a more\npeaceful death or similar final mercy, this miraculous benefit should be reserved for those\nwho fought to retain their humanity throughout their long night.\nBefore long, vampires are little more than history and a handful of survivor\nmemories, and the nights of the world hold no unnatural horrors.\nNot anymore.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n60\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n61\nCHAPTER THREE\nCHAPTER THREE:\nCHAPTER THREE:\nCHAPTER THREE:\nCHAPTER THREE:\nCHAPTER THREE:\nAPOCALYPSE\nAPOCALYPSE\nAPOCALYPSE\nAPOCALYPSE\nAPOCALYPSE\nCHAPTER THREE:\nCHAPTER THREE:\nCHAPTER THREE:\nCHAPTER THREE:\nCHAPTER THREE:\nAPOCALYPSE\nAPOCALYPSE\nAPOCALYPSE\nAPOCALYPSE\nAPOCALYPSE\nNO REGRETS, NO MERCY\nThe Apocalypse is the end for the Garou. It’s not the stuff of second chances. Gaia\nwon’t appear at the end of all things and tell everyone it was just a dream. This is the\ntime of legends, the coming of Ragnarok, the Final Days. It is a time of great deeds and\ngreater glory, the culmination of the underlying themes of Laws of the Wild.\nWith the Apocalypse, there is no room for regret. The world changes forever,\nand Earth might not survive. How can players triumph in a doomed world? How can\nthey avoid feeling railroaded in a game ending with certain tragedy? If the fate of\nGaia is sealed, then why should the Garou struggle?\nThe Apocalypse haunts all Laws of the Wild chronicles, but when each individual\nstands at the end of time, he must face his inner doubts. In a good chronicle, characters\nshould never completely lose hope. Survival might not be possible, but even in some\nsmall way, the Garou make a difference.\nTHE WAR TO END ALL WARS\nAn Apocalypse chronicle arguably demands more attention than a chronicle\nwith no fixed ending. Well, like any chronicle, everyone involved receives a greater\nsatisfaction when a story comes to an end. No one likes to read or watch half a story\nand never know the finale. Some people are so interested in the endings of books that\nthey flip straight to the final chapter before starting their novel. Leaving a chronicle\nunfinished leaves everyone unsatisfied.\nRunning a chronicle with a definite plot and an obvious climax helps keep a\nchronicle from losing focus. As the Apocalypse churns to its end, the main plot of\nthe chronicle reaches its conclusion. With the Apocalypse looming or taking place\nin the background, every moment is precious.\nThe Storyteller must realize that each character has her own story. Players crave\nthe opportunity to resolve their character’s issues, to complete that character’s\ndevelopment and story as part of the chronicle. As much as possible, the resolution\nof a character’s personal subplots should coincide with the conclusion of the main\nCHAPTER THREE:\nAPOCALYPSE\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n62\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nplot. It can happen before the Garou go off to fight their last battle, as an Ahroun\nfinds inner peace before committing an act of self sacrifice to save his pack. It could\nhappen in the final conflict when a young werewolf overcomes his fear of a Black\nSpiral to face down the beast that grievously wounded him. A character story might\nconclude after the Final Battle, as a Philodox gains a true understanding of the\nsacrifices of generations of Garou on the final day of conflict.\nStrong endings make strong chronicles that will be remembered for years. To\nstart crafting such an ambitious final story for the Apocalypse, a Storyteller must start\nwith the beginning. Although every Apocalypse chronicle will share themes, moods\nand events, each tale of the end will be unique.\nTRIBES AND TOTEMS\nEach Garou tribe has a different view of the world its role within it and the\nApocalypse. When running the Apocalypse, keep in mind what tribes are represented\nin the chronicle. Chances are that the mighty Ahroun Falling-Rock and his pack of\nrowdy Fenrir and Fianna will be ready for a full-scale Ragnarok scenario, but the more\nmystical Walks-in-Spirit and his Uktena brothers are less likely to be interested in such\ntotal carnage. Likewise, Thunder from a Clear Sky might be a fine leader, but if he’s\na Bone Gnawer and your plot centers around impressing Biting-Truth and his\ntraditional Silver Fang pack in a game of political intrigue, you’re in trouble.\nDon’t forget the totems that your characters follow either. Their individual\nBans can have a large impact on the behavior of the characters, which you should\nbear in mind when designing your stories. If the Sept of the Water’s Claw follows\nBear as its totem, they will be interested in cleansing the land as well as fighting the\nWyrm’s minions, since Bear is both a warrior and a healer. Likewise, having a\nchronicle full of mysteries is great if packs follow totems like patient Rattlesnake or\ncrafty Urban Legend. To make sure that everyone is entertained, though, you also\nshould make sure to include some martial scenarios for packs that follow such totems\nas fierce Wyvern or the relentless Wyld Huntsman.\nUltimately, no matter what tribes and totems the players choose for their\ncharacters, the Storyteller should justify that tribe’s beliefs in the chronicle. No\ngroup of werewolves should have everything it believes turn out to be the truth, but\nneither should everything it believes be wrong. Mixing elements of tribal beliefs into\none grand vision of destruction should satisfy both the players and the Storyteller.\nINCORPORATING SIGNS AND OMENS\nPortents and signs have foretold the coming of the end since humans could first\nunderstand them. The Apocalypse is this time of legend, the culmination of\nmillennia. The Apocalypse marks the end of prophecy, the end of history and the\nend of time. There are no visions of the times after the Apocalypse. This event is the\nfinal chapter, a curtain beyond which no fortune-teller can see. Even Gaia cannot\nbe certain of the outcome of the Apocalypse. Although some prophecies call for a\ngolden age, they only speak of it in hints and vague references. And for each one with\na bright hope, another tale ends in chaos and destruction.\nWithout signs of the impending doom, the Garou would not know about the\nApocalypse. Werewolves might unite and struggle against terrible cataclysms, yet\nthe true impact and horror of the events unfolds only as they realize that they live\nin a time of prophecy. As each omen and portent reveals its meaning, the impact of\nthe Apocalypse drives itself home.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n63\nCHAPTER THREE\nUSING PUBLISHED PROPHECY\nSeveral products, including Rage Across the Heavens and The Silver Record,\ninclude prophecies, omens and signs of the Apocalypse. Storytellers should consider\nborrowing parts of these prophecies and adapting them to fit their chronicles. Doing\nso saves time and energy, but the choices should have some particular relevance to\nthe chronicle for maximum affect. Writing down quotes from these books or\nphotocopying prophecies for easy reference during a game will make players pay\nmore attention than reading them out of book.\nSeveral other events have occurred in the “official” timeline that are worth\nconsidering. While they might have defined roles in a particular scenario, Storytell-\ners should always feel free to alter these roles as they see fit.\nTHE PROPHECY OF THE PHOENIX\nPhoenix took me.\nCarried me in his claws.\nHigh above the world.\nSo that I could see beyond tomorrow.\nAnd I looked.\nI beheld the future.\nI saw the decimation of our kin. Hunted beyond hunting, death beyond death,\nto the last one. There were no more children, or grandchildren, or fathers, or\nmothers. This was the first Sign Phoenix gave to me, that the Children of the\nWeaver, the Humans, would give to us, the Garou.\nI looked.\nI beheld the future.\nI saw the Children of the Weaver birthing. A great tide of Humans, rising. I saw\nmore and more, until Gaia groaned at having to carry them all. Their houses\noverrunning, their rakes raping, their hands clawing at the parched earth, trying to\nfeed from Her. This was the second Sign of the last days, that Phoenix showed me,\nthat the Humans would do.\nI looked again.\nI beheld the third Sign.\nSo many. So many children. So many Humans. And they fell against each other,\none to one, and the Wyrm brought forth corruption and gave each a measure. And the\nstrange Fire I saw, out of control, the great Plume rising over the wilderness, spreading\ndeath wherever it shone in that dark and cold land. And I heard the agony of the Sea\nas She keened, for some drunken fool poured a lake of black death out upon her.\nI turned my head away in disgust, but I could not help but look again.\nI beheld, then, the fourth Sign.\nThe Wyrm grew powerful; its winds fanned the breezes of decay. It spread its\ndiseases, and they were horrible: the Herd became afflicted with diseases of the head\nand the blood. Children were born twisted. Animals fell sick and no one could cure\nthem. In these final days, even the Warriors of Gaia could not escape the palsied\ntalons of the sickness-bringing deathbird.\nA tear in my eye, I looked again and the Phoenix showed me the fifth Sign.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n64\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nI saw the Plumes rising like death-spears towards the beautiful sky, piercing it,\nletting the Father Sun burn and parch Gaia. The air grew hot; even in the darkness\nof Winter it was warm. The plants withered in the sun. A cry of pain and disease arose\nfrom the dying forests; as one the relations cried tears of mourning.\nThen, as though a veil were torn, the sixth Sign showed itself to me.\nIn the last days, Gaia shakes with rage. Fire boils from the depths. Ash shrouds the\nsky. The Wyrm skulks in the shadows made by these… and rears to strike. The old ones\nare gone; the Guardians of the Pathways and the Crossroads are finished. In these final\ndays, the sixth Sign will make itself known in the Packs that form. Each Pack will have\nunto itself a Quest, a Sacred Journey it must perform. Such is the will of Gaia.\nAnd I saw the sky turn black, and the moon was as blood.\nAnd the seventh Sign I glimpsed, though I could not look on it in full. But its\nheat I could feel. The Apocalypse. The final days of the world. The Moon was\nswallowed by the Sun, and it burned in His belly. Unholy fires fell to the ground,\nburning us all, twisting us and making us vomit blood. The Wyrm made itself\nmanifest in the towers and the rivers and the air and the land, and everywhere its\nchildren ran rampant, devouring, destroyed, calling down curses of every kind. And\nthe Herd ran in fear. And the Dark Ones, children of the Wyrm, crawled from the\ncaves and walked the streets in daylight.\nI turned my head from the sight. Phoenix told me: “This is as it shall be, but not\nas it should.” Phoenix left me then.\nNow, I cannot dream. I can only remember the Signs, each one in perfect detail.\nThese are the last days. May Gaia have mercy on us.\nANTHELIOS\nIn late 1999, a new star appeared in the Umbral sky, Anthelios. Although it was\nvisible only to supernatural eyes initially, it has since become visible to mundane\nobservers. Astronomers are unsure as to what its physical aspect is, but those with\nmystical sensitivities are aware of its supernatural presence. It is Anthelios — the\nRed Star, the anti-sun. Although it is not mentioned in the Prophecy of the Phoenix,\nmost of the other major Garou prophecies refer to Anthelios as the “Eye of the\nWyrm” and say that its arrival signals the beginning of the end.\nIn the End Times, various Wyrm cults have taken it into the heart of their beliefs.\nMany servants of these cults — Black Spirals, fomori, etc. — have begun to show certain\n“benefits” for worshipping the Red Star. Some gain new powers or Gifts. The user’s eyes turn\nthe same shade of red as Anthelios as they express these new abilities. Those who are\nparticularly in tune with the Red Star can develop a third eye.\nTHE PERFECT METIS\nThe significance of the birth of the Perfect Metis was largely lost on the Garou.\nSome considered him a harbinger of doom, while others thought he was destined to\nbe Gaia’s champion. (Some even saw it as a triumph of the Weaver, making orderly\nperfection out of what should be flawed.) Ironically, these schools of thought are\npotentially closer to the truth than they might imagine.\nThe uproar caused by the birth of a perfect metis cub to two metis parents brought\nthe Garou Nation to the brink of civil war. It also resulted in some very odd meetings,\nas a number of agents of the Wyrm wanted nothing more than to make sure that the\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n65\nCHAPTER THREE\ncub was blessed with their own special brand of corruption. It was resolved, of course,\nbut agents of the Wyrm (the real Wyrm) kidnapped the child shortly thereafter and\nspirited him away, safeguarding him for use as the Wyrm’s voice in the physical realm.\nSoon, very soon now, the child will return, and his coming will herald a new age.\nWRITING ON THE WALL\nGoing beyond published material helps tailor the events of the Apocalypse to\nyour own chronicle. When creating the prophecies and visions that directly detail\nthe End Times in your chronicle, mind the following rules.\nFirst, write down the symbol, prophecy or sign and all the details about it.\nSecond, keep the meaning of any foretelling vague. By keeping the true meaning\nunclear, a Storyteller can adapt the prophecy to fit the events of a chronicle. Third,\nlet the characters discover the true meanings of prophecies on their own, and listen\ncarefully to their interpretations. Perception is reality. If they believe something,\nthen it’s real to them. They might even come up with an interpretation of a cryptic\nstatement that fits better into the Storyteller’s plots than the Storyteller’s version.\nFinally, don’t let the players utterly miss prophecies. If something happens to\ncause a prophecy to come true, and the players all miss it, but don’t be afraid to\nreveal what happened. Spirits or ancient Theurges will have the mystic awareness\nto realize the significance of what has happened. The Enigmas Ability and Ancestor\nBackground make good tools for revelation as well. If a Storyteller doesn’t\neventually reveal that a prophecy has come true, then the importance of the\nprophecy is lost, because the players never become aware of it. Even worse, they\ncould spend their time chasing down red herrings, looking for a prophecy to come\ntrue that already has.\nHEAVEN HOLDS THE ANSWERS\nMany events in this chapter deal with fallout from the “canonical” events\ndescribed in the tabletop book Rage Across the Heavens. Therein one can find\ndetailed passages concerning the significance of Anthelios, the birth of the Perfect\nMetis and the reasons for Rorg’s decision to “cleanse” Gaia. While it is not\nnecessary to own that book to play a proper Apocalypse scenario, Storytellers\nmight find it helpful and full of additional information that can help add nuance\nand background to their chronicles.\nTHE LEGEND SAYS WE LOSE\nWhen making prophecies, the Storyteller must decide when the future is\nnot set in stone. Sometimes, characters place themselves directly against a\nprophecy in an attempt to change the course of the Apocalypse. One of the best\nways to handle this problem would be to change the prophecy by adding to it.\nA time might come, however, when the Storyteller wants the characters\nto defy a prophecy. Such a deed should come toward the latter stages of a\nchronicle, lest the characters threaten to defy all omens and prophecies. Once\nthe characters are successful, they should have a sense of empowerment, and\nother Garou might seek them out hoping to receive their aid. Disproving a\nprophecy should be a major event during the Apocalypse.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n66\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nTHE FINAL BATTLE\nEventually, everything leads to a final confrontation, the Mother of All Battles,\nwith warriors of sickening power levels dueling each other while the fabric of reality\nrips asunder. In order to avoid the climatic scene of the chronicle degrading into\nslow-moving Rock-Paper-Scissors contest, a Storyteller needs to have some plans.\nThe Storyteller must determine which fights need tests and which ones do not.\nIf an avatar of the Wyrm attacks an avatar of Gaia in the Umbra, the Storyteller should\ndescribe the battle and the outcome. A duel between two entities of such tremendous\npower goes far beyond anything the combat system can handle. The importance of the\nresult should be part of the plot, not a randomly determined event. Only the part of\nthe fight that directly involves the characters requires any tests. This keeps the battle\nmoving, rather than having players sit and wait for results. It also frees the Storyteller\nto concentrate on cinematic descriptions and dialogue rather than worrying about the\nrules for potent Charms and Rank-Five Gifts in the background.\nThe most important part of the climax is the role of the characters. The Storyteller\nmust strive to make sure that each character contributes to the outcome. Few players\nwill be happy if they feel useless in the Final Battle. This is an important dramatic\nevent, in some respects, the conclusion of a game system as well as a chronicle. The\nStoryteller wants everyone to have fond memories, even if their characters die in the\nend. Finally, this is the time for heroic deaths. For many Garou, nothing could be better\nthan dying in battle. Again, the character should contribute, but the Storyteller should\nhave no compunctions about having werewolves die in the final scene.\nAFTERMATH\nSo, if the group wants a post-holocaust chronicle, what should it look like?\nWhat is the aftermath of the Apocalypse? What has survived? Here are a few\npossibilities — presuming there’s anything left, of course.\nDEAD WORLD\nThe Apocalypse all but destroys Earth. Gaia still exists, though, and a few of her\nspirits gather around her in an attempt to ease her pain. A few caerns still sustain life.\nCivilization no longer exists, and the remnants of humanity live in tribal groups\nscavenging the ruins. Volcanoes send ash into the heavens. The ground quakes with\nburning rivers of magma, while frozen winds herald the coming of great sheets of ice.\nThe Umbra still holds spiritual power, but much of it has fallen asunder, filled with\nthe death cries of the world. Toxins in the environment deform all new Garou as if\nthey were metis cubs. Werewolves could be on the verge of extinction.\nThis future holds little hope, though perhaps something could save the Earth\nout in the Deep Umbra. Technology and the Weaver might hold the answer, or\nperhaps the Wyld can create life out of desolation. It might even be possible that a\nnew Wyrm, freed of its pre-Apocalypse torment could guide the sept to save Gaia.\nSPIRITUAL UTOPIA\nThe Gauntlet is no more. Once again, the physical and the spiritual are one. It is\na time of spiritual awakening and transformations of life across the globe. Out of the ruin\nof the last age, a dawn time has come, where spiritual gifts flow freely among all living\nthings. Humans have reconnected with Gaia, and they understand their place in the\nworld. Dark powers still exist, but they are on the run, desperately trying to find some way\nto turn the tides and use the new spiritual nature of humans as a way to corrupt them.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n67\nCHAPTER THREE\nIn this world, the Garou would have to help humans and wolves repopulate and\nrebuild the world. They would have to stop humans and animals who don’t have the\nwill to control their new powers. Werewolves would ferret out the remaining dark\nspirits who plot against Gaia. In many ways, this starts a new golden age for everyone\n— a return to Eden.\nEVOLUTION\nThe world has changed. New life forms emerge from the ruins of the old world.\nStrange spirits take hold across the land. Humanity stands divided between allegiances\nto the Wyld, where some of them now possess spiritual magics, and the Weaver, which\nhas armed its followers with advanced machinery. The Garou must try to sort out the\ngood from the bad and find their place in a world that is no longer their own.\nIn this science fantasy aftermath, werewolves can take any role. Perhaps the tribes\nno longer exist. This world poses the question of identity of the Garou. They must decide\nwho and what they are and how they will find a place in this world.\nWEAPONS FOR THE WORLD’S END\nAlthough the focus of an Apocalypse chronicle should always be the characters\nand the stories built around them, certain systems and mechanics have been devised\nspecifically for the End Times. Storytellers should feel free to use, alter or ignore\nthese mechanics as they see fit for their chronicle.\nTHE RAGE OF GAIA\nThe Apocalypse is a desperate time. While the Garou might not entirely\nunderstand what it is they are feeling, they can sense its approach as Gaia’s pain\nbecomes their pain. During the final five lunar months, the difficulty of all Rage\nChallenges decreases by one. Additionally, whenever he is in an extremely stressful\nsituation, a Garou must retest any Frenzy Challenge in which Willpower succeeds,\nmaking it even more likely that frenzy will occur.\nIf events in the scenario result in the destruction of Luna and/or the severing\nof important totem ties, Rage fluctuates even more. Luna’s destruction immediately\nforces all changers to make a Rage Challenge against three Traits. Those who\nsucceed immediately enter frenzy for the rest of the scene, while those who fail lose\nall Rage instead as their will to fight is sapped. (Rage is regained normally.) Losing\na totem incurs the same problems for members of its family.\nNEW GIFTS\nAs the Apocalypse draws ever closer, a number of powerful, long-lost Gifts are\nmade available to those Garou with the means to learn them. Storytellers are\nencouraged to use the following Gifts as examples to build their own legendary End-\nTimes Gifts. Unless otherwise noted, consider these Gifts to be in-tribe Gifts for the\npurpose of Experience costs. Any character of sufficient rank can learn these Gifts,\nas they are awarded to the Garou Nation as a whole, not one particular breed or tribe.\nGift of the Giants (Advanced)\nA Gift lost to the Garou since the end of the First Times, now it can be learned only\nthrough the Mokolé. By spending a Gnosis Trait, the character physically grows, gaining\nall the benefits of her increased muscle mass as a result. This Gift grants the character the\nbonus Physical Traits: Brawny x2 and Brutal, as well as a free retest in any Physical\nChallenge for the duration of one hour or one scene. These effects are cumulative with\nother similar Gifts, such as the Advanced Fianna Gift: Gift of the Spriggan.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n68\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nMyth Walking (Advanced)\nThrough the use of this Gift, a Garou is able to draw upon the powers of the\ngreatest heroes of her tribe to aid her in the last battle of the Apocalypse. It does more\nthan simply grant the Garou a few extra Traits or access to a few Gifts. Rather, the\nhero called upon will physically manifest within the Gift-user, if he is pleased with\nthe Garou’s prayer for aid, causing her to transform and take the hero’s form. For all\nintents and purposes, the Garou has become this hero until the end of scene. The\nStoryteller should devise the specific capabilities of the hero in question. Most\nheroes of Garou history are quite powerful indeed, but their knowledge of current\ntrends and technologies would be equally limited in most cases. (No ancient Fianna\nwarrior knows anything about computers, for example.) It costs two Gnosis Traits\nto activate this Gift, it lasts one scene, and it may be activated only once in a Garou’s\nlifetime. A Garou learns Myth Walking from an ancestor-spirit or from a Mokolé.\nNEW FETISHES\nFlaming Death Spears\nLevel 3, Gnosis 6\nNamed after the Death Spears of the Prophecy of the Phoenix, these powerful\nweapons are created and used by servants of all three members of the trait. They are\nmost often forged from moonsilver, capped with the obsidian found from the\neruptions of the Jaws of the True Father, or polished from Wyldstones.\nWhen used in combat, these spears deal two levels of aggravated damage to the\nenemies of the maker. For instance, a Wyrm-spear would deal such damage when\nused against servants of the Weaver or the Wyld. Against anything else, the spears\ndeal two levels of lethal damage. These weapons may also be used in the Rite: Flaming\nDeath Spears.\nWolf Skin\nLevel 1, Gnosis 4\nWithout the existence of Wolf Skin fetishes, keeping an entire tribe’s fall to the\nWyrm a secret from the rest of the Nation would be nigh impossible. Upon the tribe’s\nfall, however, the Wyrm grants one of these fetishes to each of the fallen, which will\nprotect them from being detected by such Gifts as Sense Wyrm. They operate in much\nthe same manner as a Bane Skin fetish (see Laws of the Wild).\nThe fetishes are made from a small piece of dried wolf flesh (about an ounce) wrapped\nin silver wire and worn close to the flesh. They are temporary, lasting several months at the\nmost before crumbling to dust. While worn, regardless of how much taint an individual\naccumulates, she will remain immune to detection from the Gift: Sense Wyrm.\nDespite the silver used in its crafting the fetish doesn’t deal damage or siphon\noff Gnosis Traits when worn by Garou.\nNEW TALENS\nLuna-Dust\nGnosis 1\nThis useful talen is found only where pieces of Luna have fallen after the\nShattering. It appears as a gray dust with a gunpowder smell and the ability to cling to\nitself and earthly things. Anyone who finds some Luna-Dust may spread it on himself\nor a small area. If he spreads the dust over a small area, the Gauntlet rating for that area\neffectively becomes 1. If he spreads the dust on a person, then the Gauntlet for that\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n69\nCHAPTER THREE\nperson (no matter where she happens to be) is considered to be 1 until she steps\nsideways. Heavy rain washes away the Luna-Dust, thereby ending its effects, as does\nbathing or showering. Otherwise, there is no duration on the dust’s effects.\nClaw of Rorg\nGnosis 6\nPowerful Wyld-talens, Rorg’s claws are the remnants of the asteroid Geographos\nthat he threw at Gaia with the intent of killing the Wyrm before it could eat the\nworld. It was an ill-conceived plan, and only Luna’s sacrifice prevents all life on Gaia\nfrom ending, but the claws remember their original purpose. Each claw seeks to crush\nthe Wyrm in all its forms. When shot or thrown, they accelerate toward the nearest\nWyrm target, regardless of where the thrower was actually aiming.\nThese claws target the Wyrm-creature closest to the point of release, regardless\nof the wishes of the thrower, as long as the target is within line of sight. The thrower\nmust defeat the target in a Physical Challenge (retest with Athletics). If successful,\nthe Claw deals one health level of lethal damage for each five paces it traveled, up\nto a maximum of five levels of lethal damage.\nNEW RITES\nFlaming Death Spears (Intermediate)\nThis rite is nothing short of spectacular in its effects. It is capable of taking any\nranged weapon and, with the aid of a Gaffling of Phoenix, turning it into a weapon\nof terrible destructive power.\nA weapon that has had this rite performed on it is thrown or fired while the Garou\nshouts a word of power. A Physical Challenge ensues as normal to determine whether\nit hits its first target, which deals normal damage. The weapon continues on its straight\npath, however, enabling it to hit any number of other targets — effectively, the weapon\nreceives an infinite range. Additionally, for every five paces the weapon travels, the\ndamage it deals increases by one health level, up to a maximum of five levels of damage.\nThe weapon simply gets more and more powerful as it continues on its path. While\nthese projectiles might not be the Death Spears of prophecy, the rite is impressive\nenough that it is highly sought after during the final battles.\nRite of the Burning Bridge (Intermediate)\nThis ancient rite, designed to permanently sever the moon bridge connecting\ntwo caerns, has rarely seen use in recent years. In fact, the last time it was actually\nused was when the Croatan, Uktena and Wendigo used it to sever connections\nopened by the “Wyrmcomer” tribes into the Pure Lands. Some very extreme\ncircumstances appear during the Apocalypse, however, which might cause some\nGarou to consider such drastic action.\nThis rite cannot be performed alone. It requires three other Garou, and each\nparticipant stands at one of the cardinal directions as the ritual is performed, surrounding\nthe heart of the caern proper. The participants speak the Gaian name of the caern at the\nother end of the moon bridge to be destroyed. Then the participants invoke Luna and offer\nher serious chiminage as compensation for the bridge they are asking her to allow to be\ndestroyed. Players and narrators are encouraged to be creative in determining the\nappropriate chiminage, but as an example, an offering of 10 pounds of silver per participant\nmight do the trick. Finally, a ritual chant to Helios burns the bridge away forever.\nThe entire ritual requires an hour to perform, and should any step be missed for\nany reason, the rite fails. If the rite is successful, the moon bridge is destroyed and\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n70\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\ncannot be re-opened. It can theoretically be rebuilt, however, as long as Garou in\nboth caerns cooperate and at least a month has passed since its destruction.\nWEAVER ASCENDANT\nConventional Garou wisdom holds that the Wyrm will be the architect of the\nApocalypse. As Garou Theurges scrutinize the Prophecy of the Phoenix, looking for\nanswers within its cryptic passages, they watch as the Wyrm’s maleficent soul spreads\nthroughout the world, defiling everything it touches. It is only a matter of time, they\nsay, before the Garou face their final battle in the war to save the soul of Gaia.\nBlinded by the Wyrm’s obvious evil, few imagine the true threat would reveal\nitself to be the Weaver. But that is about to change.\n“Weaver Ascendant” concerns itself with the events that follow the true\nglobalization of the Weaver’s power within the human sphere. It begins with the rise\nof Shinzui Industries, a Japanese corporation with goals and aspirations that reach far\nbeyond its station. It chronicles the gradual decay of the Wyrm’s stranglehold over\nWestern society and the effects of its collapse on the Garou and all they hold dear.\nINITIALIZE END-TIME ROUTINE\nMeticulous as always, the Weaver’s assault does not begin spontaneously.\nIndeed, the threads of the Weaver’s rise have been coming together for some time,\nthough only too late will the Garou be able to see the entire design for what it really\nis. The Perfect Metis may emerge as a champion of the Weaver, the perfect synthesis\nof the new order, while Anthelios may be explained as the eye of the Machine\nwatching over its creation.\nTHE RISE OF THE MACHINE\nWith the initialization of the computer age, which has made global connectiv-\nity possible, the strength and power of the Weaver has grown like never before.\nWhen or how the Machine gained sentience remains a mystery. Perhaps it was\nsomehow tied to the nuclear detonations in Bangladesh a few years ago. Perhaps it\nwas due to the existence of a certain critical mass of technological artifacts in the\nphysical realm. Or perhaps it was simply time.\nRegardless, the Machine gained awareness and quickly subverted the Weaver in the\nprocess. Where once the Weaver’s influence was subtle and adaptable, now it became\nharsh and unyielding. The Wyrm had been allowed to corrupt the Pattern Web for far\ntoo long, and the Machine was intent on expunging his taint once and for all.\nHostile Takeovers\nThe one thing standing between the Weaver/Machine and its goals was the\nephemeral nature of the Wyrm’s influence. As it turns out, the nascent megacorporation\nShinzui provided the answers the Machine was seeking. Already thralls to the will of\nthe Weaver, Shinzui’s board of directors was expanding the corporation’s influence\nthroughout the Far East and the Pacific Rim. Several of these branch offices found that\ntheir sphere of influence happened to overlap with that of another multinational\nmegacorporation, this one with its roots in America instead of Asia: Pentex. First in\nTokyo, then in Bangkok, Los Angeles and a number of other cities, Shinzui corporate\nofficers found their paths crossing with those of Pentex employees.\nThe Awakened elite of Shinzui began to notice a pattern of corruption within\nthe Pentex hierarchy, and from there it was only a matter of time before the Machine\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n71\nCHAPTER THREE\nhad a startling epiphany: Control the corporation, and you control the Wyrm. In\nretrospect, it was really pretty obvious. The Urge Wyrms exist to spread corruption\nand power however they can, and what better way to make their needs manifest on\na large scale than through the aegis of a powerful, supposedly legitimate corporation?\nTHE WEAVER’S FORCES\nSPIRITS\nIn the months preceding the events described in “Weaver Ascendant,” Weaver\nspirits have undergone a slow but inexorable shift in behavior. They are more active\nthan they’ve been in the past, and they are becoming more aggressive toward non-\nWeaver entities. In game terms, increase difficulties for all tests involving interaction\nwith Weaver spirits by two. This applies to Social Challenges as well as activation\ntests for Gifts and fetishes.\nSHINZUI’S DRONES\nThe Weaver’s Drone assault teams consist of elite Drones who have significant\nexperience interacting with supernatural entities of various sorts. The standard\nformat for a team is six Drones: four soldiers, one reassurance (memory alteration and\nphysical repair powers), and one bricklayer (temporary Gauntlet-raising powers).\nThe teams operate in fairly straightforward fashion. The soldiers secure an area using\nhighly coordinated teamwork, the bricklayer makes sure that the targets do not\nescape, and the reassurance covers the team’s tracks once the wetwork is completed.\nAll members of the team act in perfect synchronicity, and their level of coordination\nis such that it puts that of most Garou packs to shame.\nAlthough Drones can be treated largely like fomori with Weaver-oriented powers,\nmore information can be found in Book of the Weaver or Possessed: A Players Guide.\nTHE PURGE\nShinzui’s efforts to contain the Garou threat are as straightforward as they are brutal.\nAny Garou who can be shown the beauty of the Onesong, and who undergo the process\nof Clarification, will be spared. All others will be annihilated. Shinzui’s strikes against the\nGarou are carried out by small teams of well-equipped Drones, all slaves to the will of the\nMachine. These beings operate with frightening efficiency, striking without warning and\nwasting no time on idle chatter or senseless egotism. Their goal is to wipe their quarry off\nof the face of the Earth, and they extremely good at what they do.\nSHINZUI AND YOU\nShinzui’s conquest of Pentex is more than just back story. It’s also a way\nto directly link characters to the imminent Apocalypse. If any of your\ncharacters has made it his life’s goal to monkeywrench Pentex, he might come\nin contact with Shinzui in any number of ways. Corporate accounts at all levels\nwill display some unusual activity, and it mystifies the suits at Pentex as much\nas anyone. Computer sabotage might wind up being redundant, as other\ncharacters discover that someone else got to their targets before they did. But\nwho? And, more importantly, why? And when the characters hit a particular\nsite, they might find that something else has followed them back home…\nsomething decidedly unfriendly. It doesn’t matter if their efforts are physical,\ndigital or spiritual, they will cross paths with Shinzui eventually.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n72\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nSHATTERED GLASS\nPerhaps not surprisingly, Shinzui’s first strike against the Garou utterly annihi-\nlates the Mother of Peach Trees Caern, the last bastion of the Boli Zouhisze in Asia.\nBut the slaughter does not stop there. Indeed, it has only begun. In like fashion,\nShinzui begins to eliminate the septs of the Beast Courts of the Emerald Mother,\nusing the information gleaned from its Hakken directors to dissect the hengeyokai\npiece by piece. The attacks are so swift and savage that the various sentai have no\nchance to react, and it is only a matter of time before they are forced to yield.\nWith the shapeshifters of the East pacified, Shinzui now turns its sights on the\nlands to the West. It approaches the problem from a number of angles. Branches of\nboth Endron International and Consolidex Worldwide — now firmly under Shinzui’s\ncontrol — have reported terrorist activity with an environmental motivation in\nNorthern Europe. Data provided by the few survivors of the Boli Zouhisze Garou\n(mostly through the use of Project: Odyssey fomori) also points to this region, which\nin turn leads Shinzui to the doorsteps of the Glass Walkers.\nThe Walkers are taken completely by surprise. They have never before dealt\nwith a foe that is at once so regimented and so brutal. Shinzui’s operatives use the\ntools of the Machine as well as the Walkers ever did, and they are primed to kill in\na way heretofore seen only in Wyrm-spawn. It is the city walkers’ greatest nightmare\nmade manifest, and their annihilation in Europe is nigh total.\nWhile the Garou are cut to pieces in Europe, things are different in America.\nThe touch of Pentex is strong here, even if the capital behind it is long since gone.\nAdditionally, the cities in America are both many and large, which has made\ntracking the Garou extremely difficult. The remnants of the tribes that were cut\ndown in Europe lay in hiding, while the tribes who have made America their\nhomeland do their best to help their fellows avoid Shinzui’s grasp.\nSPIRIT MATTERS\nAs the Weaver’s assault teams methodically go about their business of extermi-\nnating the Garou, the werewolves find themselves faced with another problem:\nstepping into the Umbra isn’t as easy as it used to be. In game terms, the Gauntlet\nrating everywhere increases by one. It will continue to do so at the rate of one Trait\nper week. Within six weeks, the boundary between the worlds of spirit and flesh will\nbe impassable, and every supernatural being on the planet will lose the abilities that\ndifferentiate them from normal humans.\nThe loss of the spirit world will have devastating consequences for the Garou,\nbut the implications go far beyond that. Every living thing on the planet has a\nconnection of some sort to the spirit world, and without that connection, they will\nlose their will to live. The loss of spirit will lead to the loss of creativity and\nindividuality, and eventually the world and everything on it that is not directly\nconnected to the Weaver will become nothing more than a lifeless shell.\nTHE GREAT CONCOLATION\nAs the Weaver’s forces crack down on the supernatural elements in the world, the\nneed for a concolation among the Garou becomes paramount. Unfortunately, organizing\nsuch a meeting will be a feat in itself. The calcification of the Umbra is making travel via\nmoon bridge exceedingly risky. In fact, only the most powerful caerns can safely be used\nin such a fashion, and many of those have been conquered by Shinzui’s Drones.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n73\nCHAPTER THREE\nThe location of the final Great Concolation is left up to the Storyteller, but it\nshould be fairly remote. Reaching the place should be an adventure in and of itself,\nas the Garou have to outpace Shinzui Drones and other agents of the Weaver\ngunning for their hides. The location should have strong ties to the Umbra and be\nextremely isolated. Anything else is too risky.\nAssessing the Damage\nThe impact of Shinzui’s attacks on the Garou Nation has been staggering.\nNever before have the Garou fought such an organized and implacable foe, and as\nthe Concolation gets underway, they are astonished at just how hard the Weaver has\nhit them. All told, fully 80 percent of the world’s Garou have been killed or\nincapacitated, leaving only a few hundred for the final battles against the Weaver’s\nforces. No one’s sure how to react to this news. Everyone knew they’d been hit hard,\nbut to learn that the strikes had occurred all over the world and that the werewolves’\nstrength had been reduced on a planetary scale is simply mind-blowing. There is no\nmore time for politics. The Garou are desperate, and they have to act now.\nStorytellers and Narrators should work hard on presenting the Concolation as\nvividly as possibly. While you are unlikely to have sufficient numbers to represent\nall the Garou in attendance, be ready to portray a number of famous and influential\nmembers of the Nation. It is also highly recommended that suitable music, lighting\nand other setting preparations be used to create the moot atmosphere. Lastly, while\nthe elders of the Nation will be there, don’t rule out the possibility of letting your\ncharacters be the ones to gather the key bits of information and put together a great\ndeal of the plan that the Garou ultimately embrace. Simply look forward to the plan\noutlined in this scenario (or the one you see as being adopted in your own chronicle),\nand give them information that will lead them to propose just such a strategy as will\nbe required to succeed in your particular vision of the end.\nObviously, this approach requires a good deal of lead time, by placing informa-\ntion for them to find in stories that begin well before you start running “Weaver\nAscendant.” It also diminishes the importance of the Perfect Metis, though he can\nstill be a source of information for the phase of the plan that involves freeing the\nWyrm in Malfeas, since the characters are unlikely to know much about that\nterritory. While it might require a great deal of work, this approach gets the players\ninvolved like no other and lets them feel as if they’ve truly earned their place at the\nhead of the Garou vanguard.\nUnwanted Guests\nAs the Garou plan their next move, their deliberations are interrupted by a most\nunexpected group of guests, namely the remnants of the Black Spiral Dancers. How\nthey knew of the Garou’s Concolation, to say nothing of how they managed to find\nit, is unclear. What is clear, however, is that the Dancers are in a conciliatory mood\nand aren’t really looking for a fight. If the Garou let them say their piece, they’ll\nindicate that they’ve been hit by the Weaver even harder than the Gaian Garou\nhave, and that they’re willing to help the Gaians any way they can as long as it\nundermines the Weaver’s efforts. This offer presents an interesting moral dilemma\nfor the players. The Gaians are desperately short on manpower, but are they willing\nto work with the very embodiment of everything they’ve been fighting up until now,\neven during the final battles of the Apocalypse?\nEven more surprising than the initial arrival of the Black Spiral Dancers, however,\nis the return of the Perfect Metis, thought lost since he was kidnapped years before.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n74\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nHowever he shows himself, it is clear by the end of the day that he speaks for the Black\nSpiral Dancers, and that his is the true voice of the Wyrm. The Perfect Metis has more\nto offer to the Garou Nation than simple aid — he has information as well. He also says\nthat a critical opportunity is close at hand, and that the Gaians and Spirals might in fact\nbe able to defeat the Weaver’s aims once and for all if they are all able to work in concert.\nTHE WEAVER OVERSTEPS\nWhether the players or the Perfect Metis proposes it, a plan emerges at last.\nFirst, the Garou will launch a massive counterattack against the forces of the\nWeaver, doing all they can to loosen her hold on the physical realm. Then they must\nmake their way to the Umbra — still accessible in places like Australia, the Amazon\nand parts of Africa — and travel to Malfeas itself.\nOnce there, they will perform a ritual of great power, offering up their own lives\nto give the Wyrm the power he needs to break free of the Pattern Web. If the ritual\nworks, the worlds of spirit and flesh will be dissolved as the Wyrm breaks free and\nreturns to his normal self. The power of the Machine will be crushed, and the Weaver\nwill be given the opportunity to regain her sanity. The cycle will begin anew,\nrejuvenated by the Garou’s sacrifice and overseen by a wiser, more cautious Triat.\nSTRIKING BACK\nThe methods the Garou take to loosen the Weaver’s grip vary considerably\ndepending on the region of the world and the other supernatural beings the Garou\ncan call upon for aid. The characters might formulate or stumble across any of the\nfollowing plot possibilities, and the Storyteller is encouraged to either choose one\nof the following or use them as inspiration for something else entirely.\nOPERATION: FULL DISCLOSURE\nWhile the other Garou tribes begin to attack the Weaver in their own ways, the\nGlass Walkers announce the beginnings of Operation: Full Disclosure in a particu-\nlarly dramatic way. In short, they access and gain control over every broadcast system\non the planet, be it television, radio or even cellular phone networks, and they use\nthis control to put their enemies under a microscope. They tell the world that all is\nnot as it seems, and that a lot of people have been manipulating the public for a very\nlong time. Everyone’s a target — including vampires, Pentex executives, the\nscientists at DNA, Shinzui’s obviously illegal activities and anything else the sept\ncan think of. It doesn’t stop with the broadcast either. Pack members send email\nmessages to those with something to gain from an enemy’s downfall, and they make\nphone calls asking people if they knew about their bosses’ skeletons in the closet.\nThe players can involve themselves in this scenario in a number of ways. First, they\ncan lead vigilante posses to investigate the targets of the operation, fomenting chaos\nwherever they go in an effort to break the Weaver’s control over the masses. Doing so will\nbe difficult, since the masses are predisposed to obey the dictates of those in control, but it\nshould be quite possible, especially with the right Gifts. The characters can also act as\nbodyguards for the packs who are more directly involved, since Drones in service of the\nWeaver (not to mention anyone “outed” by the broadcast) will be gunning for their heads.\nSABOTAGE, INDUSTRIAL AND OTHERWISE\nWith the commencement of Operation: Full Disclosure and the call for war\nagainst the Weaver, the cities of the world have become a saboteur’s paradise. The\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n75\nCHAPTER THREE\nGarou cannot attack the Weaver and her minions openly since their numbers have\nbeen reduced to a mere handful. They can, however, make guerrilla raids against\nWeaver facilities, lashing out with plastic explosives and industrial sabotage where\nmore traditional methods of battle are inappropriate.\nStorytellers who choose to go this route should present their players with a\nnumber of tempting targets, providing floor plans and timetables as needed so that\nthe characters can plan their strikes accordingly. Don’t worry too much about\nweaponry and gear. This is, after all, the end of the world, so let the characters go out\nwith a bang if they really want to. Acquiring equipment should be easy, given the\nantics of the Random Interrupts lately. Players and Storytellers alike are encouraged\nto let their imaginations run wild and play the scenario to the hilt. And hey, if the\ncharacters live, they can even proceed to the next phase of the story. Even if they\ndon’t, though, this is as good a way to go as any. Cracking the shell of the Weaver\nin the physical realm counts for a lot, and it will give other Garou packs the\nopportunity they need to shatter the Pattern Web in the Umbra.\nALL HAIL DISCORDIA!\nSome Garou take the impending Apocalypse as an opportunity for all-out war and\nsabotage, while others embrace the wonders of technology to cut the Weaver’s many legs\nout from under her. That’s fine and all, but for some Garou, the name of the game is pure,\nunadulterated chaos, and they should have their day in the sun as much as anyone else.\nThis scenario is best chosen by packs with particularly charismatic members, the\nsorts of people who are good at getting people fired up and starting serious trouble.\nCharacters with extensive networks of allies, contacts or kinfolk are also well suited to\nstart up such grass-roots revolutions, and this option might be good for packs that have\ninvested heavily in mortal society for just this reason. High-ranking Bone Gnawers or\nRatkin are also ideal, as they have the Gifts they need to really stir things up. In any event,\nthe point of the endeavor is to create absolute pandemonium over as large a territory as\npossible, turning the unwashed masses against the minions of law and order and using the\nensuing chaos to take out selected targets within the Weaver’s hierarchy.\nTERROR, INC.\nWhile the remnants of the Glass Walkers make their move to co-opt the\ncomputer networks of the world, the Black Spiral Dancers take a more direct route\ntoward shattering the Weaver’s control of reality — they work to sow terror so that\npanic will bloom. Owing to the fact that he is, in fact, a possessed Garou, the Perfect\nMetis has some supernatural powers above and beyond those normally granted to the\nWyrm’s werewolves. One of them is a greatly enhanced form of the Delirium, one that\nworks even on Awakened beings. This is a perfect way to subvert the Weaver’s control\nof her Drones, since even the strongest of them is no match for the raw, animalistic\nhorror the Perfect Metis can instill within them. As the metis and his followers strike,\nrending the Veil with abandon, the earthly minions of the Weaver are torn to pieces.\nMany players might balk at the idea of letting the Black Spiral Dancers run rampant\nwithin their cities, and with good reason. These are creatures of Rage who have been utterly\nconsumed by darkness, and they make the worst of humanity look… well, not benign, but\na whole lot less extreme. But players have to remember that these are the End Times. The\nkey to the Spirals’ motivation now is pure, unadulterated destruction, and in that they serve\nthe original intent of the Balance Wyrm. They are no less corrupt than they have ever been,\nbut at least now they’re striking openly instead of skulking in shadows.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n76\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nFREEING THE WYRM\nWith the Garou striking on multiple fronts, the Weaver’s control of the\nphysical realm eventually fractures. This is not to say that the Garou have won the\nwar, however — far from it. Rather, their sustained assaults against the minions of\nthe Weaver have given them the opening they need to scatter into the Umbra, and\nfrom there to make their way to Malfeas where they will hopefully free the Wyrm\nfrom its prison. Before they can fight that final battle, however, they have to actually\nreach the Umbra — no small matter given the nature of the times.\nREACHING THE UMBRA\nIn kinder times, the Garou could simply step sideways to enter the Umbra. In\nmost of the world, however, that is no longer possible. The wall between worlds has\nbecome completely calcified, resulting in a Gauntlet rated well over 10 for most of\nthe world. There are, however, a number of alternatives to merely stepping sideways,\nsuch as consulting the Mokolé or the Nuwisha, “swimming sideways” with the\nRokea, et cetera. Storytellers should feel free to make the players work hard to figure\nout how to circumvent the formidable barrier of the Gauntlet in these desperate\ntimes, but ultimately the final challenge is not in the physical realm, but Malfeas.\nTHE MAW OF THE WYRM\nOne way or another, the Garou have reached Malfeas, the lair of the Wyrm.\nNow the trouble really begins. How the characters’ reception in Malfeas unfolds is\nleft to the Storyteller to determine, as it largely depends on how the characters came\nto be in the place, who brought them (if anyone) and what they encountered along\nthe way. Although much has happened already, the Storyteller should see to it that\nthis harrowing journey is every bit as terrifying and difficult as what has come before.\nThis is the final hope of the Garou, and no punches can be pulled by either side.\nRegardless of the circumstances surrounding their arrival, however, the characters\nmust face a number of challenges as they proceed through Malfeas. First of all, the Wyrm\nis at war with itself. Even if they arrive with the Perfect Metis and the Dancers, they are\nsubject to the same hostility as any other group — if not more so. Banes, disloyal Dancers\nand all manner of other creatures fall on them in great waves, forcing the characters to\nstay alert every second or face destruction. Second, the terrain changes constantly,\nmaking it easy for groups to become separated (good fuel for a frightening session) and\ndifficult for the Garou to establish a place to begin the great ritual. Lastly, the minions\nof the Weaver attempt a last-minute invasion as the ritual progresses, in a desperate\nattempt to control the Wyrm forever. As a result, the characters will face not only rogue\nWyrm manifestations but the Weaver’s forces as well.\nROUSING THE WYRM\nOnce the Garou have managed to secure a foothold in Malfeas, all that remain\nare the rituals needed to restore the Wyrm’s vitality. Garou have never attempted\nanything of this magnitude, and the ritemasters involved know the cost will be\nterrible even if they succeed. If the Garou perform the rite themselves, they’re in for\na hard time. Every living Garou that remains participates in the rite, and a Rank-Five\nTheurge from each tribe must help to lead it.\nAlthough the Storyteller may adjust any of the figures for the rite as needed for\nher chronicle (lower totals for games with fewer remaining Garou, higher totals for\nthose with more), performing the rite as written requires a Mental Challenge (retest\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n77\nCHAPTER THREE\nwith Rituals), against a difficulty of 14 Traits. Each of the Garou leading the rite can\nmake this test, and total success requires 100 successful tests. Only one test can be\nattempted per hour of the ritual. Once the leaders of the rite reach the required\nnumber of tests, all of the Garou participants — that is, all of the Garou remaining\n— must contribute permanent Gnosis Traits.\nFive thousand Gnosis Traits are required for the rite to succeed. If the total is\nnot met, the participants begin to suffer aggravated wounds, with each wound\ncounting as three more Gnosis Traits toward the total. These wounds cannot be\nhealed in any way, including Gifts, until the rite has been completed or totally\nabandoned. At this point, Storytellers should increase the drama as much as possible,\nmaking those actively involved in performing the rite feel the strain of channeling\nsuch great energies while those guarding the ritemasters endure wave after wave of\nattackers desperate to halt the ritual before it is completed.\nIt is also important to make sure that even if a character is doomed to die as a result\nof the ritual draining his life away, he has a chance to get some good last words in or\ntake a final parting shot at his enemies. Nothing is more anti-climactic than telling the\nplayers, “Oh, by the way, the rite sucks out seven Gnosis and all your health levels, so\nyou die instantly,” without giving them some chance to nobly face their sacrifice.\nTO HELL AND BACK\nAssuming the rite is successful and any of the characters survive, there is still the\nquestion of what has happened now that the supernatural has been revealed. It is possible\nfor the Storyteller to rule that as part of its return, the Wyrm of Balance removes most\nof the knowledge of the supernatural from humanity as a means of promoting healing.\nEven so, people will never again look so blindly at the world. The other option is to keep\nthe knowledge out there and let the chips fall where they may. The Garou will have to\nadjust to a world that is struggling not only to get back to its feet, but with the knowledge\nof the supernatural as well. The Litany itself will need to be changed, and the leaders of\nthe Garou must find a way to approach the humans, in time.\nThings are certain to be nice and chaotic for a while, indeed.\nTHE LAST BATTLEGROUND\nIn this scenario, the war of the Apocalypse occurs entirely within the Umbra. The\nPenumbra erupts into chaos as Banes emerge in impossible numbers. One by one, the\nrealms become diseased and fall into ruin. The Black Spiral Dancers stand among the\nBanes and lead their forces onto the Last Battleground foreseen by the wise among those\nwerewolves. And the Wyrm itself, its red eyes glaring beyond five columns made of flesh\nand entrails, enters the Penumbra to destroy Gaia and bring about the Apocalypse.\nNor will the physical world be spared. As the soul of the world is crushed in the\nWyrm’s talons, its body is likewise mangled. Spirits are indiscriminately destroyed en\nmasse, causing droves of animals and plants to die mysteriously in the physical world.\nThe Pattern Web is severed and it unravels, tumbling cities to the ground. To\nhumanity, it will be as if God has left Earth forever and taken the savior with Him. To\nthe Garou, there will no longer be any more waiting for any saviors but themselves.\nTHE SOUL OF THE WORLD\nWhile the Garou’s focus rested upon the material world, the Wyrm’s eyes never\nleft the Umbra. While incidents within the physical world could create ripples\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n78\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nwithin the Umbra, the physical world was shaped entirely by the spirits. Cut down\na tree, and the Glade Child within would be weakened, but it would still live and\ncreate another tree elsewhere. Kill the Glade Child, though, and the tree would\nwither and die, deprived of its soul. Thus did, the Wyrm intend from the beginning\nto crush the soul of the world, Gaia, by finding her hidden within the Umbra and\nrending her in his talons.\nEarlier attempts to push into reality were met with strong resistance, however.\nSome even dealt the Wyrm serious damage, pushing back the Apocalypse for centuries\nat a time. So the Triatic Wyrm, full of hatred and rage, brooded in Malfeas and planned\nthe ultimate undoing of the world. To prevent its simple — though very costly —\neviction from the Penumbra, it required an anchor to ground it within. In fact, it\nneeded three: one for the Eater-of-Souls, one for the Beast-of-War, and one for the\nDefiler. These anchors would take the form of ritual sacrifices of monsters whose lives\nand deaths both utterly embodied the member of the Wyrm Triat they would tie tight\nto this world. These sacrifices would be known as the Scions of the Wyrm.\nOnce these beings have been sacrificed, the Wyrm will be able to use such\npowerful deaths to secure enough of a hold in reality to escape Malfeas and enter the\nPenumbra — and the Final Battle will begin at last.\nTHE UMBRA IN CHAOS\nWith the Wyrm’s entry into the Near Umbra, the spirits are in a panic. Nobody\nin the Garou Nation or among the spirits is in any doubt that the End Times are now\nhere, and an “every man for himself” mood descends upon the vast majority of the\nspirits. Nor is this mood undeserved, as hordes of Banes flood the Penumbra and\nslaughter everything in their path.\nIn the End Times, the entire Umbra becomes a war zone. Whereas the fear of\na Bane ambush was a constant danger in the Umbra before, they are now a certainty.\nThere is nearly always a Bane somewhere in sight, and frequently there is a rush of\nthem. (Usually coming right toward you.)\nTHE FIVE COLUMNS\nAt the heart of the enemy strategy are the five columns of flesh. Taking from the\ndead souls of the Nuwisha the knowledge of almost every square inch of the Umbra,\neach column links a Near Realm to the Penumbra. A firmer link than a moon bridge,\nthese columns allow the Triatic Wyrms to marshal their troops, bringing forth untold\nnumbers of Banes from the furthest reaches of the Umbra. The first column is linked\nto Malfeas, and this is the second most important column to all three of the enemy.\nFrom here come the largest number of Banes, as well as the most powerful.\nThe second column links to Scar. Not only do many Banes likewise flood the\nPenumbra from this Realm, but many also come armed with foul blades made from\nwaste and built in that Realm’s factories.\nThe third links to the Atrocity Realm. Few Banes come from this column, but\nthe third column soon becomes a symbol of fear among Gaia’s warriors. This is the\nlast thing that any prisoners taken see from the Penumbra.\nThe fourth column provides a gateway to the Abyss, and it still stands. This fact\nterrifies those who think about it too much. The very Wyrm itself, the force of death\nand destruction, has brought himself into the battle. What possible force is he\nexpecting to emerge from the Abyss and enter the battlefield?\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n79\nCHAPTER THREE\nTHE SCIONS OF THE WYRM\nEach of the following sacrifices makes an excellent point to begin an\nApocalypse chronicle. While the first has already occurred in canon, that\ndoesn’t mean that the Storyteller shouldn’t feel free to alter the timeline to\nsuit her chronicle. Just remember that despite the characters’ best efforts, the\nsacrificeswill go forward — even if they prevent one, it’s possible that another\nscion will be chosen. Truly preventing them all averts this particular vision\nof the Apocalypse, at least for now.\nFirst Scion: The Demon of India\nScion of the Eater-of-Souls, this ancient vampire emerged in 1999 and\nwas promptly destroyed by a massive effort of elder Leeches, detonation of\npowerful magical weapons and the inadvertent aid of a number of Garou. Its\ndestruction led to the appearance of the manifestation of the Eater of Souls:\nAnthelios, the anti-sun. Of course, if the Storyteller desires, these events can\nbe moved around so that the sept is either present during part of its destruction,\nor perhaps hosts survivors of the battle. As long as the shock of these events is\nfelt around the Garou Nation, the first scion’s death has had its proper impact.\nSecond Scion: Zhyzhak, Green Dragon’s Chosen\nNot long before the Apocalypse unfolds, this mighty Black Spiral Dancer\nscion of the Beast-of-War, receives a vision that her prophesied confrontation\nwith“the last Gaian king” is at hand at last. Her pack takes control of a small town\nand begins killing and torturing the inhabitants, baiting King Albrecht to come\nand fulfill the prophecy. The Storyteller can choose to set this story in a nearby\ntown as a way of getting the sept involved, using Narrator characters to portray\nAlbrecht and his pack as they come to hunt down Zhyzhak. Ultimately, Zhyzhak\nand her fearsome pack are destroyed with the aid of the sept, though not before\nshe mortally wounds Albrecht as well. (It is fated to occur, after all.) As the last\nof her blood drains away, a second red star appears in the sky…\nThird Scion: The Perfect Metis\nThis unwitting Garou is the scion of the Defiler Wyrm, rescued from\nnightmarish circumstances by Garou heroes immediately after its birth.\nThough he was raised with love and tenderness by a sept of Gaian Garou\n(possibly even the characters’ sept, if the Storyteller has allowed them to play\nout the events of Rage Across the Heavens), the Perfect Metis actively\nattempts to escape as the caern comes under attack by Black Spiral Dancers.\nDespite a frantic rescue effort, they take it to a remote defiled caern and spend\nweeks torturing it before finally allowing it to die hideously, a ruined mind\ninside a shattered body. Its death heralds the appearance of the final red star,\nand the emergence of the Wyrm into the Penumbra.\nThese four columns form a square, and in the middle is the fifth and most important\ncolumn. This one, taller than the others, links to Battleground. But rather than merely\nproviding a doorway in and out of the Realm, this column acts as an focus to\nBattleground, or specifically one particular part of Battleground — the Plain of the\nApocalypse. The Five Columns stand at one end, and the Wyrm flies above them in wait.\nThe Warring Hordes lie in wait surrounding the Plain. They are unusually expectant,\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n80\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nquiet and passive. No noise is heard here. The area possesses an eerie, pregnant silence.\nAnd one end of the Plain remains open and waiting for the soldiers of Gaia.\nTHE REALMS\nEach of the following realms lends a different flavor to “Last Battleground”\nscenarios, allowing Storytellers to choose exactly what kind of Final Battle they wish\nto create. Do the Garou join the endless frenzied hordes of the Battleground in a\nbloody melee, or is the final conflict more of an intellectual game of chess in the\nabstract thoughtspace of the Aetherial Realm? Or does the Final Battle take place\nsomewhere else entirely, in a Realm of the Storyteller’s devising?\nEven if a Realm detailed here is not necessarily the best staging ground for the\nFinal Battle itself, it still has potential to offer story hooks or subplots for the Garou\nto explore during the last days. The Storyteller can incorporate any of them to keep\npacks busy and players guessing as the end approaches.\nStorytellers who desire more detail on the various realms and the spirits found\nthere will find the revised Umbra book and Axis Mundi extremely helpful, though\nit is not required to use either of those books to run this scenario.\nThe Abyss\nOne of the many things that the Apocalypse proved, should any Garou take the\ntime to consider it in the final frantic days, is that the Abyss was not the Wyrm. And\nyet, if Malfeas was the heart of the Wyrm, then the Abyss was his soul. Why, some\nGarou ask, does it exist at all? What is its purpose? With so many of the Wyrm’s forces\noccupied elsewhere, it might be possible for brave packs of Garou to venture into this\nnear-abandoned Realm and find a secret concerning the nature of the Wyrm that\nwill turn the tide of battle — if they survive long enough to return, that is.\nThe Aetherial Realm\nEvery single moon bridge passes through the Aetherial Realm. And this makes the\nAetherial Realm a very tempting target indeed for the Wyrm, who has successfully\nscattered most of the planetary guardians and destroyed much of its natural defenses\nsimply by his dramatic appearance there. The spirits in the Aetherial Realm panic and\ngive the Wyrm a wide berth, opening chances and room for Banes to lie in wait and make\nstrategic attacks on the planetary Incarnae and moon bridges. Of course, nothing says\nthat the Garou will give this ground quite so easily. While doing battle in this often\nabstract and confusing Realm might not suit many Garou, it is an excellent way to\nbalance the Wyrm’s superior numbers, particularly if the players are well suited to puzzles\nand enigmas as well as some quick thinking. The Garou might even attempt to ambush\nthe Wyrm’s main force with a surprise Final Battle as it passes through en route to another\ntarget, exploiting their understanding of the Aetherial Realm to its best advantage.\nArcadia Gateway\nArcadia is dying. At its best it was a lie — if a glorious one. It was a Realm of half-\nreal fantasies playing games with each other and those Garou who would step into their\nlair. Unless the chronicle crosses over heavily with the fae of The Shining Host, it’s\nextremely unlikely that the Final Battle will be staged here, as the fae hosts want no\npart of the Garou war. Then again, a group of Garou might travel here to find a way\nto bring back some of the pure hope and inspiration the Gateway represents to the\nGarou forces. Doing so might bring key figures out of Harano or provide the creative\nspark that makes it possible to devise the winning tactics for the Final Battle.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n81\nCHAPTER THREE\nAtrocity Realm\nIn the Atrocity Realm, most of the atrocities that occur every second are\nprojections of the real world — reflections with no physical or spiritual reality. As not\nsimply a victim of an atrocity but a spiritually important signifier of Atrocity, however,\nthe actual spirit of the Perfect Metis was transferred into the Atrocity Realm to\nexperience the horrors of torture and death over and over for eternity. This is no mere\nemanation but an actual living being — whimpering, lame, constantly tortured by\nBanes, and helpless. If he were taken out of the Atrocity Realm and away from the\ntorturing, violating Banes hovering around, the cub’s suffering would end. (This\nrepresents a possible plan for Garou seeking to cripple the Defiler and thus hamstring\none of the Wyrm’s footholds in the Penumbra.) Of course, the Wyrm will be well aware\nof its vulnerability even as it draws strength from it, and those Garou who seek to rescue\nthe poor cub will face a grueling fight in this already nightmarish Realm.\nBattleground\nPerhaps almost too obvious a choice, the Battleground has never been better\nnamed. Before the Apocalypse, Battleground was divided and formal. The wars never\ncrossed, and those walking along the trails were safe. But in superimposing the\nBattleground onto the Penumbra, the Wyrm destroyed that state. Now, the Battle-\nground has become a single, massive war. Nazi soldiers wage blitzkrieg on Nordic hordes\nand see little confusing about the difference. Nor is anywhere safe any longer, as the trails\nhave been drowned in blood and erased by soldiers’ feet and tanks’ treads. Setting the\nFinal Battle here is an invitation to raw, bloody, unadulterated mayhem on the grandest\nscale (and perhaps a rousing scene involving turning all the armies of history against the\nWyrm). In other words, it’s an excellent idea if your troupe enjoys a great deal of combat\nand tactics, but one that also requires a great deal of planning and attention to logistics\nto portray accurately without being drowned in the number of troops involved.\nCyberRealm\nThe CyberRealm is in chaos. A ragtag but well-equipped group of shapeshifters\nand spirits known as the CyberWolves has begun an armed insurrection against the\nspirits that rule the Realm. The Weaver is not sitting still while the Apocalypse\nbegins, however. She is treading very carefully, aware of just how much she stands\nto lose should humanity panic during the End Times. The Weaver is hoping to come\nout of this with the cities and her handiwork intact, not in pieces. This isn’t out of\nmisguided hope, but rather out of her most basic nature as the creature of order. A\nFinal Battle fought here will be extremely high-tech and fast-paced, with all manner\nof incredible technology augmenting both sides. Unless the Glass Walkers are\nleading the charge, however, this is likely to work much more to the detriment of the\nGarou than their aid, as the enemy is generally much better trained with weapons\nof the modern era. The Weaver might also intervene on either (or neither) side,\nseeking to keep the Realm safe and protect her own servants.\nErebus\nWhile other Realms fall swiftly beneath the enemy’s power, Erebus (at least\ninitially) stands firm. The Incarna who rules Erebus, Charyss, is both awesomely powerful\nand furiously opposed to the Wyrm, and the Realm’s natural defenses are highly effective\n— a burning lake of silver renders it impossible to traverse for the Black Spiral Dancers.\nThe frightening spirit guardians of the Realm, the Brood, feed on Rage, making them\nparticularly vicious against the Rage-empowered Banes that are the Wyrm’s foot soldiers.\nIf the Garou fall, it is likely that Erebus will be the last Realm to fall afterward — but it\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n82\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nwill fall. Despite all the Realm’s resources, not even Charyss can withstand the awesome\nmight of the Wyrm’s armies. Setting the Final Battle in Erebus itself would be a story of\npure desperation, even for the Apocalypse. Garou do not willingly enter this Realm, and\nits natural features would be as fearsome for the Gaian forces as they would be for the\nenemy. Still, if the Garou are to finally redeem themselves (or be damned forever), where\nbetter to have it happen than the Realm of Judgment?\nFlux Realm\nThough discounted as too inherently unstable to be much harm or help during\nthe Final Battle (and it makes a poor field for the fight itself), the Garou might become\naware of a new threat in the Flux Realm during the End Times. Powerful minions of\nthe Wyrm have discovered a way to create a mystical Seed that contains a burst of pure\ncorruption, and they desire to plant this Seed in the Flux Realm. There, they believe,\nit will catalyze the chaos into creating an all-consuming monster of pure entropy. Most\nTheurges scoff at the notion of the Flux Realm, the embodiment of change, being\nconfined to one purpose by something so lowly as a single Seed, but then again, chaos\nis nothing if not unpredictable. Can the Garou take that chance?\nThe Legendary Realm\nThe Legendary Realm’s Apocalypse began early. The goal of the Wyrm here\nwas not to conquer territory, but to destroy the history of the Garou and defile the\nmemory of their greatest heroes. Robbed of the glory and dignity of their ancestors,\nthe Garou will suffer a terrible blow to their morale, and many might submit to\nHarano and choose to die rather than go on after such a crippling defeat. Packs or\neven an entire sept might be sent here to keep a particularly important legend or hero\nfrom falling to the Wyrm, or at least to recover an important item or bit of\ninformation before it is lost forever. Setting the Final Battle here is either a noble\nstand or a cruel joke, depending on the Wyrm’s progress. The Garou might find\nthemselves fighting gloriously alongside their heroes of legend, or else facing down\nthe gloating enemy over a pile of the defiled corpses of their ancestors.\nMalfeas\nHell does a brisk trade in Apocalypse. Malfeas is chaotic come the last days, for\nwhile describing it as the central command post for the Wyrm credits the foul pre-\ncreation thing a greater mind that it has or would deign to use, such a description has\nsome truth. Like the Abyss, many of the Wyrm’s plans stem ultimately from Malfeas,\nthe most blasphemous patch of Terra Umbra the Garou know. Malfeas is also one of\nthe Realms in which the Garou have the most to gain. Werewolves who understand\nstealth and can choose appropriate targets will be able to deal great damage to the\nWyrm deep within its own home. There are many targets available. The only\nproblem is that none of them will be easily reached or destroyed, and time is of the\nessence if they want these missions to have any impact on the outcome of the war.\nPangaea\nWhile it is not immediately obvious, primal Pangaea has become hideously\ndiseased. By corrupting the primitive tribe that inhabits the Realm, the Wyrm exposed\nthe Realm’s most powerful guardian spirit, the Elder Serpent, to a lingering foulness that\nnow festers in its stomach. And if the great beast dies, the disease will spread to consume\nPangaea and Gaia alike. For Pangaea is the soul and heart of Gaia, the primal point of\ncreation from which her life flows. Garou may visit Pangaea in an attempt to heal the\nmighty Elder Serpent and recruit it for the Final Battle. Actually holding the Final Battle\nhere will encourage a scenario of warfare at its most primal — modern weapons and\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n83\nCHAPTER THREE\ntechnology quickly fail in Pangaea, resulting in savage klaive and claw battles. The\nlandscape can be anything the Storyteller desires, from endless grasslands to narrow\nmountain passes to blistering deserts to dark jungles and everything in between. It is also\nan excellent staging ground for a “back to basics” End-Time scenario, where the Garou\nmust rely on their traditional weapons and tools as well as their instincts to carry the day.\nScar\nScar is the Realm perhaps the least changed by the coming of Apocalypse.\nAlready strongly aligned with the Wyrm, yet not particularly one of his strongest places\nof power, the spirits in Scar are hardly the most fearsome. Nearly half are weak-willed\ndrones who exist only to toil in the factories and follow the Wyrm more by rote than\nfervor, and the rest are brutal little thugs who usually need only be tough enough to\nmenace the first. While a poor location to hold the Final Battle — its narrow streets\nand crumbling buildings are ill-suited to either army — a clever strategist might note\nthat it is therefore perhaps the perfect location to build up a surprise force. A reasonably\nsized number of Garou warriors would stand a good chance of successfully liberating\nScar and rallying its inhabitants against their previous overlords, particularly since the\nnastiest of the Banes from the Realm have been moved to the Last Battleground. But\ncan it be done in time to make a difference?\nSummer Country\nSooner rather than later, the Wyrm’s minions will find the Summer Country, and\nits defenses will crumble at their approach. The Wyrm cannot launch the Final Battle\nin the Summer Country, however. Even in its weakened state, this Realm resists such\nimpurity to the point of destruction. Indeed, while the Realm cannot be hidden any\nlonger, it also represents an opportunity for the Garou. If the Garou can follow these\nminions, they too can find the Summer Country. Considering that Gaia’s spirit resides\nthere, albeit severely weakened by ongoing events, such a quest could be no less than\nthe stuff of legends to the Nation. It is possible that Gaia could grant those who find\nher a Gift, a fetish or even a humble secret that greatly increases their chances of\nwinning the Final Battle, though she is in no condition to do much more.\nWolfhome\nThe first Garou to step back into Wolfhome in the Apocalypse will notice the change\nimmediately. No helicopters fly overhead anymore. You can’t hear the sounds of guns\nshooting the wolves or the crackle of electricity from the camps. But nor can you hear the\nhowls of the wolves. And, most tellingly of all, no longer do the Garou come to Wolfhome\nas wolves. Wolfhome is dead. Setting the Final Battle in this haunted, empty place is an\nexcellent choice for a chronicle involving many lupus characters, or even just characters\nparticularly dedicated to restoring the wilderness in general. As the final representation of\nall their deepest fears, it can be a uniquely powerful place to bring it all to an end.\nSTORYTELLING THE FINAL BATTLE\nThe Final Battle is literally everything Werewolf has ever been leading up to.\nSlowly but surely, the Garou have gathered together at the Last Battleground under\nthe banner of Margrave Konietzko, or perhaps another leader who has emerged during\nthe course of the chronicle. Some are not there, having chosen to guard their caern to\nthe end, having succumbed to Harano or having died trying to reach the Battlefield.\nWithin the sight of every man, wolf and monster in the Nation, is an army 10 times\nas large, filled with blasphemous horrors and led by the gargantuan form of the Wyrm.\nAt last, it is time.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n84\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nTACTICS\nWhile the Final Battle should be a chaotic, sprawling affair as the Garou face\noff against sentient death for the fate of life, perpetual and unchanging combat\nquickly becomes boring in a storytelling game. The Final Battle does have tactics and\nchanging battlefield conditions that allow a Storyteller to vary the action and keep\nthe players excited as the world comes tumbling to an end.\nGoals of Battle\nThe Final Battle is unusual in many ways, most obviously in that the primary\ngoal of the battle does not require the seizing of any territory. The primary goal of\nbattle here is simply the obliteration of the enemy force. Neither side will attempt\nretreat, so maintaining channels of retreat is a pointless gesture. Unless the\nStoryteller desires to really employ the features of the Realm to full effect in the Final\nBattle, the Plain of the Apocalypse is flat and featureless, completely without hills\nor gullies that might be of value strategically. Despite all this, the battle is not\nwithout points of strategic consideration.\nThe first of these is the most obvious: the Five Columns of Flesh. As the mechanism\nby which the Wyrm will bring in any reinforcements, it assumes tremendous strategic\nvalue. The destruction of any of the columns will hamper the Wyrm’s efforts, most\nespecially the columns connecting Malfeas, the Abyss and the Atrocity Realm.\nGaian Stronghold\nSimilarly, the Garou have a wall to their backs in the caern that borders their\nside of the field. While it is not nearly so important to the Garou as the Columns of\nFlesh are to the Wyrm, the caern is an advantage that the Garou should not throw\naway pointlessly. Any spirit refugees who were harbored in this caern will still be\nthere in the Final Battle, and they can form a useful “base camp” that the wounded\nin the battle can be dragged back to. Since werewolves heal so quickly, and not all\nof their enemies deal aggravated damage, this is no small advantage. Maintaining a\nstrong defense of this caern could assist the Garou in maintaining a tougher fight.\nAlso of value are the two sides of the Battlefield. Since the Warring Hordes form\na solid wall, any troops there cannot be flanked. Most of the Banes will ignore this,\nrushing forward in a mad scramble, but the werewolves on the field may prove more\ncunning and use careful advances along the sides of the battlefield for added security\nor even to lure powerful foes to a devastating trap.\nSurprise Attacks\nStorytellers who want to use a surprise attack by the Wyrm should find ways for\nthe attack to come out of nowhere. Create a minor disturbance — something that\nlooks like a surprise attack such as Black Spiral packs using BurroworPatagia to quickly\nflank the Garou Nation and begin attacking. Play it out hard, make it seem genuine.\nAnd then, only when the players have calmed down, slam down 10 Nexus Crawlers,\nturn the ground to silver and rain steaming blood from the sky. And in the middle of\nthat, have the Wyrm attack proper. Pile it on. Try to panic the players, but give them\na way to succeed as well — not without cost, perhaps, but succeed nonetheless.\nBy contrast, if the players are launching a surprise attack, play up the tension.\nLet the alpha be coordinating the strike using communication fetishes or spirit allies.\nRepeatedly ask your players what they are doing, and make note of every last detail\nin your descriptions and placement of Narrators. Try to suggest to your players that\nthey should be obviously doing something, without saying anything. Regardless of\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n85\nCHAPTER THREE\nwhether the surprise attack eventually works or not, you should be able to produce\na sigh of relief from your players when it happens.\nFoot Soldiers and Massed Charges\nAt the center of the Final Battle is the massive collision of Garou and any spirits\nor other allies they have gathered throwing themselves headlong against the\ncoalition of Black Spiral Dancers and Banes the Wyrm has gathered. And yet, the\nbattle isn’t quite a massive brawl. While the tactics involved aren’t exactly\nmundane, there is certainly still a strong strategic element to the conflict.\nGarou still attack in packs, rather than individually. While the lack of cover\nand flat terrain renders some pack tactics useless, the basics of how werewolves fight\nstill applies. The Wyrm is aware that despite having Banes available that dwarf\nwerewolves in size, the strong pack fighting makes those Banes not nearly so powerful\nas it could hope. As a result, the Wyrm also needs to create tactics that nullify the\npack advantage. The easiest way to do so is with massive numbers. The Wyrm swarms\nGarou packs with massed units of Scrags or Wyrm Elementals. Even massed, they’re\nlittle match for most Garou, but they break apart pack tactics and consume the\nindividual efforts of the werewolves. After this, a larger Bane will attack the divided\npack, further driving the werewolves apart.\nStorytellers should keep these tactics in mind and develop others to throw at\nthe players during the battle. Don’t just keep moving the next warrior into position\n— eventually, your game will become extremely boring. Instead, mix it up a bit.\nCreate that wave of tiny Banes and then pound your players with the big guy,\nshowing them what the Wyrm’s tactics are meant to do, and then let it level out a\nbit into a field of different Banes. Then, when they get swamped the second time,\nyou can get your players waiting for the other shoe to drop. (And, on a third try, hit\nthem with a massive wave of small Banes, and see if they correlate this with a really\nmassive Bane about to attack.) Keep changing things, but make it obvious that it’s\npart of a strategy, not just a Storyteller ploy to keep things fresh.\nThe Big Guns\nIf the Garou don’t have some incredibly large spirit allies backing them up, then\ntheir chances of winning the Final Battle are practically nil, no matter what other\nadvantages they have. Aside from morale, the primary value of having such mighty\nspirits lies primarily in pinning the Wyrm to its spot above the Five Columns of Flesh.\nShould it leave that spot to wreak havoc upon the Garou, then soon after a massive\nstrike would sever the connection, leaving the reserves in the Near Realms with no\nability to enter the Plain of the Apocalypse. If none of the Celestines, Incarnae or\npowerful totem spirits are at the battlefield, then the Wyrm charges from its waiting\npoint and dives upon the Garou. Acid drips from its underbelly, balefire from its\nmouth and eyes. Hundreds of Garou can die with each swoop, and the Final Battle\nis most probably over very quickly indeed.\nOn the other hand, if larger spirits are present, the Garou not only have more\nhope but also more firepower to help them cut through the seemingly endless ranks\nof the Wyrm’s foot soldiers and target more important foes. Very powerful scenes can\nbe centered around accompanying a totem or even several totem spirits on their “last\ncharge” into the enemy ranks, as the spirits give their lives to draw fire and make\nsome other objective possible to obtain. Some clever players might find other ways\nto strategically use the big guns. If they do so, encourage such creative thinking by\nletting it work.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n86\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nSTARTING THE FINAL BATTLE\nLess important than how to end it, but still worth thought. Give the players time\nto have their characters resolve conflicts with rivals (or refuse, even into death, to let\nthem rest) and otherwise show their characters preparing themselves for the final\ncataclysm. Stay hands off, just giving a few gentle nudges by bringing old characters back\ninto view. Remember, practically the entire Garou Nation is here. Any other werewolf\n(who’s still alive) who the characters have reason to love or hate is going to be here too.\nWhen the players are ready to begin the battle, have the Margrave or another\nleader deliver this speech to the Nation, and then charge into history. Naturally, if\none of your characters has assumed a leadership position and would like to give a\nstirring speech, feel free to let him use some or all of the following speech:\n“Know this, warriors of our Mother! There is nothing after this. Our ancestors\nhave been butchered twice, once in body and once in spirit. There is no Heaven,\nthere will be no Hell. Valhalla does not exist. All that is will be destroyed if we fall\ntoday. And many of you will. The enemy is mighty and fearsome, and we march\nforward into the mouth of death. Do not fight for an afterlife reward for your bravery,\nfor it will not come. Fight instead for Gaia. Fight for all that which you know and\nlove. Fight with every last ounce of Rage left inside of you, so that even should the\nWyrm destroy us, they will be awestruck by your mighty fury.\n“Prove your arms so mighty, prove your anger so terrible, prove your love so pure\nand your passion so encompassing. Prove your minds so resourceful and your zeal and\ncourage so overwhelming that even should every one of us fall today, the armies of\nthe Wyrm will never rest easy.\n“In their reign of Oblivion, every one of their soldiers will look over their\nshoulders and sleep with one eye open. They will live with fear — fear that one day,\nwe will find a way back!”\nA TRIBE FALLS\nIn this scenario, a tribe falls into the Wyrm’s service. This betrayal leads to a\ncivil war within the Garou Nation as the tribes loyal to Gaia must defend themselves\nagainst former allies while still protecting Gaia from the forces of the Wyrm. The\nApocalypse comes from within.\nThis scenario has the potential to be the most personal of the Apocalypse scenarios\ndescribed in this book, but its sweep can be just as epic as any of the others. In fact, it’s\neasy to fold a tribal fall element in with pieces of other scenarios to build an Apocalypse\nthat meets your chronicle’s needs precisely. Of course, it will also take more work. The\nApocalypse will begin and end in different fashion depending on which tribe falls, and\nof course there’s the need to fine-tune the tribe so that the fall seems more plausible.\nIt is strongly recommended that the Storyteller have access to the revised\nTribebook of the tribe that falls to the Wyrm. It isn’t strictly necessary, but it will\ncertainly help flesh out the doomed tribe appropriately, as well as provide any\nnumber of plot hooks and other interesting material.\nWHICH TRIBE?\nThe first question that is likely to come to mind when contemplating a tribal-fall\nApocalypse is: Which tribe is the “best” one to have fall? There’s no perfect answer to\nthis question. An easier decision to make is whether the tribe to fall should be one\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n87\nCHAPTER THREE\nrepresented in your troupe’s sept. It’s possible that the Storyteller must answer this\nquestion in the affirmative, as the chronicle may well have representatives from all tribes.\nIf not, it’s much easier to make the fallen tribe be one that isn’t represented by\nany of the players, since the Storyteller can then control all aspects of the fall and\nreveal information to the players only when it is truly necessary and appropriate. It\nis much easier to keep the secret of a tribe’s fall when the Storyteller is the only one\nwho knows about it, after all.\nBy contrast, a Storyteller has to walk a very fine line when running a tribal fall\nfor a tribe represented among the players’ sept. The best way to handle it is to give\nplayers a handle on the events surrounding the fall of the tribe, allowing them to\nmake minor changes to the way it plays out without really affecting the fact of the\nfall of the tribe. They might not be able to stop the rest of their tribe, but they might\nbe able to save some close friends or Kinfolk from falling to the Wyrm. Perhaps they\neven emerge as leaders of the remaining fragments of their tribe.\nTRIBAL-FALL ELEMENTS\nEvery tribal-fall story involves a common set of elements. The short version of\nthe story is that a given tribe becomes corrupted by the Wyrm, betrays the Garou\nNation and Gaia to the Wyrm, then brings about the Apocalypse, ending the world\nas the Garou know it.\nNo two tribes experience this fall in quite the same fashion. One might lurk in\nthe service of the Wyrm for years, slowly plotting and planning, while another could\nfall and take the fight to the Garou Nation within a matter of weeks. One tribe might\nfall almost by accident, while another could decide that the Wyrm’s side is the only\none worth standing on. While the broad scope might look similar for each tribe, each\ntribe causes the Apocalypse to spin somewhat differently, and a Storyteller should\nexpect to put his own unique stamp on what happens.\nThe elements listed here are only some of the possible points to consider when creating\nyour story. The examples that follow touch on every one of these points, however.\nFORESHADOWING\nPlot out the activities that a tribe’s leader (or other influential members) takes that\nlead it to be corrupted by the Wyrm. This motivation guides the rest of the tribe’s activities.\nThe werewolves might be tricked into falling — led into a cavern that turns out to echo\nthe Black Spiral, for instance. They might find some other threat that they consider to be\neven worse than the Wyrm, driving it into the arms of the Wyrm out of desperation.\nOf course, the tribe could also turn to the Wyrm out of a cold calculation that the\nApocalypse has already begun and the Wyrm’s side is the one most likely to win…\nOmens: Early in the tribe’s fall — or even before it has begun to fall — the only\nthings noticeable are the gentle shakings of cosmology. The tribe itself occupies an\nimportant place in Gaia’s reality, and the tribe’s totem, as an Incarna, has a key role as\nwell. As the tribe begins to fall, therefore, Theurges, those with high Gnosis or those with\nhigh Occult scores might all experience unsettling omens. They could occur through\ndreams or through observations of mystically significant everyday circumstances.\nTHE FIRST STEP\nWhat step, precisely, does the tribe take that enters it into the Wyrm’s service?\nThis should be a specific thing — a point beyond which no sane person can claim\nthat the tribe does not serve the Wyrm, even if some individual members do not. This\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n88\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\ncould be a great ritual conducted by tribal elders, a field trip through the Black Spiral,\na crusade to Malfeas or a dozen other things. It is a dramatic event, with repercussions\nthroughout the physical and spiritual worlds. No one with a Gnosis above two Traits\nfails to recognize that something ominous has taken place, though the signs might\nnot clearly point out just what actually happened.\nPolitics: As some factions of the tribe turn toward the Wyrm, a Garou character\nmight hear rumors of strange activity among her tribemates. Rumor spreads far and\nwide. Perhaps the initial cover story spread through the tribe is that the tribe’s\nleadership has been working on a secret ritual to fight the Weaver or Wyrm. As the\ncircle of fallen Garou expands through the tribe, those who still serve Gaia find\nthemselves excluded from otherwise ordinary rituals or tribal activities. Rumors of\na “cult of the favored” spreads among the Gaian Garou, and many petition to join\nthe “favored” so that they can regain what political power they had, never guessing\nthat such activity will spell their doom. Certain septs could fall in their entirety very\nquickly, while others might be quite resistant to the call of the Wyrm.\nFor the troupe’s packs, this could be a time for careful investigation. At the same time,\nthough, the fallen Garou of the tribe are at their most paranoid. Spirits and young Garou\npatrol the outskirts of nearly every gathering, Garou all wear Wolf Skin fetishes and so on.\nCOVERT ACTIVITY\nCertain tribes might spend weeks, months or even years with their heads down,\nnot yet revealing to the other tribes that they’re in the service of the Wyrm. They\nmight be extending their reach in some fashion, or they could be hunting down rogue\ntribe members who haven’t yet turned.\nThis is a time of great urgency for the fallen werewolves. They have an\nenormous opportunity to strike from surprise, but they must swiftly quell any internal\nopposition, lest those traitors who remain loyal to Gaia reveal the tribe’s subversion.\nAs a result, expect the deaths of many Garou during this period, at the hands of\nmysterious werewolves who give all indication of being Black Spiral Dancers.\nThe troupe’s sept might be called upon to investigate these murders. That\ninvestigation could be the first time that the sept encounters evidence of the Wyrm’s\ntentacles extending deep into a Gaian tribe.\nHunts: Once the fallen Garou of the tribe solidify their power base and control\nroughly 2/3 of the tribe’s numbers, they begin calling nightly hunts of the “rebels” who\nremain in service to Gaia. This is a brief and intense period just before the tribe’s fall\ncomes out into the open, and it really represents the kickoff of the Apocalypse itself.\nThe hunters do their best to capture rebellious tribemates alive, and bring them\nback to the nearest Hive for “re-education.” This gives rebel Garou a fighting\nchance, as their foes aren’t striking to kill — at least not at first. Once the fallen tribe\nhas been exposed to the rest of the Garou Nation, its leadership accepts that most\nremaining rebels are simply losses to their great cause, and they strike at the holdouts\njust as they would strike at any other Gaian Garou.\nIn the end, not every Garou of the fallen tribe falls into the service of the Wyrm.\nSome keep their freedom; some manage to be adopted by another tribe’s totem or live\nas Ronin through the end.\nREVEALED!\nEventually too many factors pile up to enable the fallen tribe to hide its\nexistence from the rest of the Garou Nation. Powerful spirits might reveal the tribe’s\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n89\nCHAPTER THREE\ncorruption to other Garou, or a single event could occur that draws everyone’s\nattention to the fallen tribe. If the traitors are sufficiently organized, they might even\nannounce their new state openly, defying the other Garou to challenge them.\nAt this stage, be ready for a lot of frantic questions and frenzied activity from\nthe players, particularly if there are characters from that tribe who haven’t learned\nof the corruption yet. Have a plan for what the Nation as a whole will do about the\nmatter, as well as some ideas for how the sept might respond as well, and be ready\nto spring those ideas into action soon after the revelation hits. Players should feel\nlike their world has been turned upside-down and that events are happening\nalmost too fast to keep track of.\nTRIBAL FALL AND TOTEM SPIRITS\nA fallen tribe’s totem has one of several fates. First, the totem spirit itself could\nfall into the service of the Wyrm (or the Weaver). The spirit could become deluded,\ntrapped and poisoned, or deliberately throw itself to the Wyrm’s side. In fact, the spirit’s\nfall might be the cause of its tribe’s fall. Of the tribal totem spirits, the ones most likely\nto end up on the Wyrm’s side seem to be Grandfather Thunder, Griffin, Great Uktena,\nand Great Wendigo, but there’s no tribal totem spirit that is immune to a fall.\nIf the Incarna is killed, its tribe is rudderless. The tribe might simply scatter,\napproaching other tribes of Garou (and their totems) for adoption. A tribe with no\nsurviving totem spirit cannot adopt new members, nor can its members learn Gifts\nfrom Jaggling or Gaffling avatars of the totem. Jaggling pack totems of that Incarna\nbecome listless, distracted and lose half their Gnosis. Garou of a tribe with no totem\nspirit cannot gain Rank, and they are more prone than their brethren to enter\nHarano. The tribe’s Umbral homeland becomes unstable and chaotic. For all these\nreasons, it is imperative that the tribe find a new totem.\nNot every fallen totem follows an identical path, but most perform the same\ngeneral sweep of actions:\nCorrupt the Children. There are several simple ways to corrupt Garou, from\nthe perspective of a tribal totem gone bad. A good way to rapidly turn Garou to the\nWyrm is to feed them corrupt Gnosis. A cunning totem knows when its packs hunt\nspirits for Gnosis, and it makes sure to have subtly corrupted Gafflings and Jagglings\nfall into the pack’s path. More violent and less subtle totems may choose to use the\nwerewolves’ Rage against them. Present a Garou with enough opportunities to frenzy\nand sooner or later, he’ll either do something awful and regrettable during the frenzy\nor be pushed into the Thrall of the Wyrm. A Totem of War might have unusual\nability to affect a werewolf’s Rage in this regard.\nTarget the Leadership. The totem starts by corrupting the highest-ranking\nmembers of the tribe. For ease of access (and concealment) it begins with those Garou\nwho are members of packs dedicated to it. If Stag falls, it goes after high-ranking Fianna\nin Stag packs first. It subsequently spreads its influence, reaching out for high-ranking\nGarou of its tribe who are not members of its packs, and then members of its packs of\nall ranks, and finally low-ranking Garou with other pack totems.\nProvide Tainted Magic. While the charm offensives listed previously are\ngoing on, the totem might begin to provide its more vulnerable — “trusted” —\nTheurges and Philodox with new versions of old rituals, fetishes and Gifts. These\nnew versions rely on Wyrm spirits rather than Gaian spirits, but that might not be\nimmediately obvious.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n90\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nINTO THE TALONS OF THE WYRM\nWhichever tribe falls to the Wyrm, it won’t be alone in its service. The White Howlers\nfell to the Wyrm, many centuries ago, becoming the Black Spiral Dancers. The relationship\nbetween the fallen tribe and the Dancers could be crucial to an Apocalypse chronicle.\nJOINING THE DANCERS\nThe fallen tribe could simply join the brood of Whippoorwill, greatly increasing\nthe size of the Black Spiral Dancer tribe. This is the simplest option, though it does\nraise the question of the fate of the tribe’s original totem. Packs of the fallen tribe\nwould either join Dancer packs or form intact packs of their own. Certainly these\nnew members of the Black Spiral Dancers would be less prone to inbred madness and\nhereditary taint. The flip side is that the integration of old and new Black Spiral\nDancers is never easy or painless. The integration of hundreds of new Wyrm-Garou\nshould lead to chaos and even, possibly, a civil war in the tribe until clear leaders from\nboth old and new emerge and come to terms with one another.\nRIVALS TO THE DANCERS\nThe most likely result of a tribe’s fall to the Wyrm is that that tribe stands\nseparately from the Black Spiral Dancers, becoming another tentacle of the Wyrm.\nWhile it is possible that the two tribes would cooperate in service of the Wyrm, given\nthe rivalry that Whippoorwill is sure to have with another Wyrmish Garou tribal\ntotem, it is much more likely that the tribes’ activities do not seriously overlap. When\nthey do overlap, dark Garou on both sides vie for dominance over the others — a\nsituation that the Wyrm encourages (to see that only the strongest survive to serve it)\nand that clever Garou might be able to exploit if they can learn about it in time.\nDANCERS EXTERMINATED\nA powerful and proud tribe could perhaps destroy the Black Spiral Dancers after\nfalling to the Wyrm’s service. A tribe such as the Silver Fangs might brook no rival in\nJUST FOLLOWING ORDERS\nThe default assumption throughout this chapter is that the fallen tribe\nsuccumbs to the wiles of the Wyrm. Within the last half century, though, it\nhas become more obvious to the Garou that the Weaver, and her madness, is\nat least as big a threat to Gaia as the Wyrm is. Nearly any of the tribes that fall\nto the Wyrm might fall to the Weaver instead. The Wyrm wants to foment\nchaos and destruction in order to drag Gaia to her doom and restart the\nuniverse. The Weaver, by contrast, wants to push Gaia into stasis.\nSo while the Wyrm targets a tribe to fall in order to cause the maximum\ndisruption to the Garou Nation and to Gaia’s spirit hierarchy, the Weaver\ntargets a tribe to fall in order to calm the Garou Nation down, as well as smooth\nout ripples in the spirit realm. Sick of endless war and near despair at the state\nof the world, many Garou would certainly be tempted to embrace a power that\npromises to give them the world of their desires — in return for helping remove\nunwanted “aberrations” while remaking the world in that image, of course.\nStorytellers interested in this angle need only think about what a given\ntribe’s utopia would be like, and how the Weaver could convince them that\nit would be made reality through its service.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n91\nCHAPTER THREE\nthe Great Destroyer’s affections, for example. The tribe wouldn’t be lured into a fall\nif the majority of the Wyrm’s forces weren’t prepared to back the newly fallen tribe in\nits assault on the Black Spiral Dancers, after all. Surviving Black Spiral Dancers might\neven turn to Gaian Garou for assistance, offering their knowledge of the Wyrm’s\nresources and activities in return for protection against the Wyrm’s newest army. Such\na scenario should be good for hours of in-character argument, at the very least.\nTHE TRIBES IN SHADOW\nWhat follows is a brief accounting of what might happen to each of the tribes\nsurrounding a fall. It should not be considered “canonical,” but instead a suggestion\nof what might push enough of the tribe to fall and what they would do once\ncorrupted. Storytellers should feel free to alter the story hooks provided or even\ninvent their own as necessary for their chronicle.\nBlack Furies\nThe Widows, as they come to be known, turn due to a strange illness from their\nexposure to Wyld energies that begins unpredictably changing their physical forms. Unable\nto stop the change but unwilling to snare themselves in the web of the Weaver, they reason\nthat this change must herald greater things. They attempt to awaken the long-slumbering\nWyrm of Balance and restore the natural world to its former state, but they are slowly drawn\ninto darkness by other Wyrm-spirits until they are given entirely to the cause of corruption.\nBone Gnawers\nWhat drives the creation of the Plague Rats is ultimately simple avarice. Tired\nof being poor and rejected for so very long, these embittered Garou are finally\nseduced by the promises of the Wyrm to deliver them the riches and respect they\ndeserve if they help it remake the world. Allying with Leeches and Ratkin, they\nspread chaos and destruction as only those with nothing to lose really can, becoming\naccomplished assassins and purveyors of terror and disease.\nChildren of Gaia\nHow could these noble Garou become the terrible killers known as the\nReavers? Never forget what is said about the path of good intentions. Believing that\nthey will sacrifice their lives for the good of Gaia, the elders of the tribe perform an\nancient ritual to cleanse the Wyrm of its madness — but something goes horribly\nwrong, corrupting the participants to the cause they were attempting to heal. As one,\nthey reach a decision: Gaia’s suffering must end. Right now.\nFianna\nPlaying on the simmering leadership tensions within the tribe, the faction known as\ntheBlack Stags makes deals with Black Spiral Dancers and other terrible allies in order to\n“restore the tribe to its ‘pure’ state.” Striking in a series of devastating ambushes, they kill\nor capture a number of prominent packs, forcing survivors to walk the Black Spiral. Many\ninnocent Fianna are summoned to meetings with their fallen kin (carefully disguised to hide\ntheir taint), only to find themselves surrounded and facing the choice to join or die.\nGet of Fenris\nThe Pure arise from a great campaign to cleanse a series of interconnected\nmystic tunnels the Black Spirals have dug under the North Sea, which allow them\nto strike across Europe at great speed. Following a great tribal moot, the Get resolve\nto purge the Pit that dwells at the heart of the tunnels — and like the White Howlers\nbefore them, emerge deranged and wholly given to the Wyrm. They promptly\nunleash their fury on the Nation, and Gaia trembles.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n92\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nGlass Walkers\nThe Raiders arise from the pragmatism for which the tribe is famous for.\nOverpowered by the awakened Corporate Father totem spirit of the Pentex Corpo-\nration, their Cockroach totem negotiates a settlement where the Walkers will be\nspared and allowed a place in the next world hierarchy in return for serving Pentex\nduring the Apocalypse. Naturally, some Walkers refuse, and are promptly turned\nover to “human resources” for a bloody “downsizing.”\nRed Talons\nAs a mysterious disease decimates the remaining wolf packs of the world, the\nPredators declare that the time has come to cull the human population once more.\nWhile this war on humanity leaves them with few allies in this realm, many angry\nspirits join the war effort, causing disasters around the globe. When the Wyrm offers\nits aid, the enraged and grief-maddened Predators accept.\nShadow Lords\nAttempting to boost Grandfather Thunder to the status of Celestine to help\ncombat the Wyrm, all Shadow Lords are assigned a great task to prove their totem\nis worthy — and they fail. Not only are they weaker for the effort, but their enemies\nare stronger than ever, and the other tribes heap shame upon them. Though at they\nsimply lash out in anger first, proud Thunder eventually turns to the Wyrm in spite\n— and takes his dearest children with him, name and all.\nSilent Striders\nThe Hungry Ghosts arise in the wake of a terrifying discovery in the Dark\nUmbra — a gigantic entity known as Grandmother that walks the land of the dead,\na vast storm of angry souls forever swirling around her. The haunted tribe decides to\ngo willingly to the Wyrm and lead its minions into direct conflict with this being,\nin the hopes that the other tribes will be able to defeat the weakened forces of either\nside. Of course, once they walk the Black Spiral, not all of them desire a conflict\nbetween the fallen powers — but rather an alliance.\nSilver Fangs\nFollowing a great sacrifice to Falcon, the Silver Fangs find their madness lifted\nfor a year and a day, and begin a great campaign to destroy some of the most powerful\nHives around the world. Garou rejoice as these forces emerge victorious — until the\nwarriors of the Fiery Crown declare that with minds clear, they see that Gaia’s cause\nis hopeless. They eliminated the Dancers because they were unworthy allies. Now\nthe Crown leads the Wyrm’s minions, using all their inside information and natural\ntalents to tear the Nation apart.\nUktena\nSeduced by sweet whispers and promises of power during their lonely mystic\nvigils, the Snakes do far more harm than any Garou might have expected as they\nunleash many of the sleeping Banes they have been tending for centuries, as well as\nuse some of the powerful Wyrm fetishes they have kept in their care. Striking back\nat these elusive and mystically gifted Garou is a daunting prospect, and their\nknowledge of great occult secrets makes them dangerous foes indeed.\nWendigo\nEnraged by grievous violence against native activists, the Devourers emerge as\nthe tribe takes on a war footing against the Wyrmcomers and the Garou who support\nthem, using their great Gifts to lash the precious cities of the enemy with natural\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n93\nCHAPTER THREE\ndisasters and other devastating setbacks. In the face of opposition from the other\ntribes, Great Wendigo urges his children onward to greater acts of ferocity, until\nfinally the Wyrm takes them all.\nThe Beast Courts\nThe Stargazer tribe of the Garou, along with many of its hengeyokai allies of Asia,\nfinds itself torn between two factions: those who believe the arrival of the Sixth Age (the\nApocalypse) can be delayed, and the Fatalists who believe nothing more can be done\nand give themselves over to the Wyrm in hopes of easing the death agonies of the world.\nTHE WAR ITSELF\nIf the fall of a tribe is simply a prelude to another sort of war, then refer to the other\nsections of this chapter for guidance. If, on the other hand, you wish to focus on the uniquely\ntribal nature of this war, consider a few analogies from the United States Civil War.\nFirst, the fallen tribe’s members know everything that is public knowledge within\nthe Garou Nation. They know where the big caerns are. They know who the\nimportant leaders are, and someone in the fallen tribe probably knows each leader’s\nweaknesses, strengths, preferred Gifts, rites and fetishes to boot.\nIn this scenario, one of the weaknesses of modern-day Garou society that so\nmany elders rail against is exposed as a true weakness: With so many multi-tribe\npacks out there, the fall of a single tribe to the Wyrm exposes the weaknesses and\nsecrets of the majority of Garou. If modern Garou society were more insular — with\nmost packs being single-tribe packs — then the fallen tribe would not have\ninfiltrated the others quite so deeply, and its loss, while still hard, would not be\ncrippling in the way it could be today.\nBy the same token, though, the elders and leaders of the fallen tribe grew up with\nthe rest of the Garou Nation — everybody knows everybody. The modern leaders\nof the Western Concordiat have a good idea of the skills, strengths and weaknesses\nof their erstwhile allies. They all know one another’s fighting styles and should\nprobably spend some time thinking, “I know he’d prefer to do this in a frontal assault,\nbut he knows I know he’d prefer to do this in a frontal assault…”\nFallen and loyal Garou try to use their former pack bonds and mutual loyalties\nagainst the others. Fallen Garou expect their former packmates and allies to fight\nwith regret, perhaps holding back on the killing blow in the hopes of redeeming a\nfriend from a dark fate. Count on fallen Garou to take advantage of this by feigning\nsurrender or showing false loyalty. Gaian werewolves can call on old loyalties and\ndredge up memories that are unpleasant to fallen Garou — they might pull a few\nformer allies into frenzy. Gifts, rites and totem powers that rely on two Garou being\npackmates might well still work on fallen former packmates.\nEND OF THE WAR\nA tribal-fall scenario doesn’t have to stand alone. Any tribe’s fall could lead into\nany of the other three major scenarios presented here. A tribal fall to the Weaver\ncould lead to a “Weaver Ascendant” scenario; tribal totems falling to the Wyrm\nmight lead to a “Last Battleground” scenario; just about any of them could lead to a\n“Ragnarok” scenario. And the tribal fall could be its own thing — the fall results in\nwar among the Garou and the emergence of the Wyrm’s forces.\nIf the story does spin off into other scenarios in this book, it is critically important to\nresolve the tribal fall scenario itself as the war comes to an end. It’s a simple rule of drama.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n94\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nIf the Apocalypse kicks off because of the fall of a tribe to the Wyrm, a satisfying resolution\nto the tribe has to be reached. It can be a tragic resolution — and it probably will be.\nRAGNAROK\nThe Apocalypse has obsessed Garou since the Beginning. While some mystics have\nasked themselves and the spirits about what awaits them — and have come up with a\nvariety of answers — most Garou have looked forward to a battle in which the Nation\nwould fulfill its final purpose of battling the Wyrm to a finish. Now it’s the End Time,\nDoomsday, Judgment Day, Armageddon, Ragnarok, the End of All Songs. The proph-\necies unfold; no doubt the End is here. This story concerns the final enacting of what filled\nthe mouths of poets and sages for so long, what made the Garou and will unmake them.\nIn this section, the Storyteller will find a suggested series of End-Times events\nthat, along with ideas for telling stories centered on the characters’ active involve-\nment in the Final Battle between the Gaian Host and the Hordes of the Wyrm.\nThese events provide space for many stories, even a complete chronicle and a\nframework for chronicles set in that time. Rather than specifying the exact places\nand people involved, it seems better to give events and ideas here, along with some\nstory seeds, and to let the Storyteller fit them into an existing chronicle.\nTHE STORY OF THE FALL\nThe events of Rage Across the Heavens have acquainted the planetary Incarnae\nall too well with the situation of Mother Gaia. While most of the planetary spirits do not\nONE STANDS ALONE\nYou may choose, at the end, to have the entire Garou Nation fall save for\none tribe. Just about any tribe would work in this role, but it makes the most sense\nto have the nature of the other tribes’ fall be something that the chosen tribe is\nmore resistant to. If the Wyrm works through perverting the Ancestor Spirits of\nall the other tribes, then it makes sense that most Silent Striders would be\nresistant to such corruption. If the Wyrm drags Garou to fall by goading their\nRage to intolerable levels, perhaps the Children of Gaia would resist.\nAt the Storyteller’s discretion, the last “tribe” might not even be a single\ntribe at all, but a collection of surviving Garou who share a common tie, or\nperhaps lack a specific Trait that leads to corruption. This connection can be\nanything the Storyteller desires, such as a certain Gift or fetish, high Gnosis,\nlow Rage, Ancestor or Pure Breed Backgrounds or high Willpower. These\nsurvivors band together to form the Tribe of the Apocalypse, forging a new\nidentity and possibly even a new totem bond even as their former allies gather\nthe Wyrm’s minions around them.\nWhichever tribe stands alone surely faces an impossible siege, a guerrilla war\nthat it is sure to lose barring some utterly miraculous event. The tribe members may\nfind individual allies here and there — some Kami, perhaps, a few nature spirits,\nor lone Garou or Fera who have resisted the Wyrm’s call. This situation is even\nmore bleak than most other scenarios portrayed herein, and possibly not for most\ntroupes due to its excessively bleak outlook. Still, those looking for a truly tragic\nlast stand might find that the One Tribe twist suits them just fine.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n95\nCHAPTER THREE\nsee anything that they can do about the tragic situation, one of them decides to take\nmatters into his own claws. Rorg, the Many-Taloned Hunter of the Asteroid Belt, strikes\nat Earth. He wishes to prevent its destruction, and as his own world is long destroyed, he\ncannot be afraid of retaliation. Rorg launches his Claw, the asteroid that humans call\nGeographos, into a trajectory that will strike the Earth. The raging Incarna believes that\ndoing so should make the Earth useless to the Wyrm and to Anthelios. Gaia, he believes,\ncan recover with the Wyrm so crippled. This act causes the Shattering of Luna, the Fall\nand the Great Black, and it sets the stage for the Final Battle.\nAs the asteroid comes closer, visibly deviating from its orbit, Garou and humans\nbecome very worried. Nostradamus was not the only prophet whose work was interpreted\nto foretell a “mountain” falling into the sea. The darkest dreams of the Mokolé hint at\nsuch an event, although millions of years past. Once word reaches them, the Dragon\nBreed themselves begin to panic. Mokolé start to prepare for the end, or the beginning.\nTHE SKY ROAD\nThe coming of the Claw means that the Garou must try to stop it before it strikes\nthe Earth. Mostly likely your characters’ packs are nominated (it being their chronicle).\nIf the packs are too inexperienced, the Storyteller may allow some Narrator “guest\nstars” to help them handle it. The pack must seek entrance to the Deep Umbra,\nwhether at a caern familiar to them with that capability or the Sept of the Stars, a\nStargazer site in the Aetherial Realm of the Near Umbra. Additionally, each Garou\nwill require some means of breathing in the Deep Umbra. A nosegay of fetish flowers\nthat are sniffed to provide oxygen will suffice if no other ideas emerge.\nThe Claw itself appears to be less a world in itself than a flying mountain. Its\nsurface is rock, cracked and pitted by meteorite impacts. The Garou step sideways into\nthe fetish orrery to the Umbra of the asteroid, a brilliantly lit place where Helios dazzles\nthem and burns their eyes. Earth is visible as a blue star accompanied by a white star\n(the moon). They “swim” rather than walk along with the asteroid, floating in the\nocean-sky of the Umbra. The whirling of the Claw means that Helios’ light alternates\nwith starry dark. In this environment the Wyld-spirits who swarm on the Claw will be\nable to attack the Garou almost by surprise. A Vortex leads as many Lesser Wyldlings\nas there are Garou. The Vortex is the “motor” by which the asteroid moves, and its\nCharms of fire, flaming vapors and steam smoke are its secondary weapons. It seems like\na living fountain or volcano. The Wyldlings appear as distortions in the whirling stars\nand put a one-Trait penalty on all attempts to attack them directly unless the Garou\nuses Scent of Sight or a similar power to circumvent the need for vision.\nThe battle should be fierce. If the Garou are driven off the asteroid and back into\nthe Deep Umbra, Geographos will continue toward the Earth and only the sacrifice\nof Luna will enable Earth to survive. If the Garou disperse all the spirits, including\nthe Vortex, then the asteroid will be on an inertial trajectory and might be deflected\nby a Deep Impact style nuke. The sacrifice of Luna is still plausible. The battle on the\nasteroid should not stop the Fall and the Great Black unless the Storyteller doesn’t\nreally want an “Apocalypse” story.\nTHE RECONCILIATION\nNot long after the Claw appears, the Garou are approached by unexpected\nallies: the Mokolé. The Mokolé seek rapprochement with their ancient enemies,\nwith negotiations centered on alliance in the face of imminent catastrophe. The\nMokolé insist that the Garou make a gesture of genuine atonement for the Wars of\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n96\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nRage as a means of sealing the truce. How, exactly, the Garou choose to do so is up\nto them. They might perform Rites of Cleansing and offer a permanent point of Rage\nas a sacrifice to Gaia, for instance. If the players roleplay genuine grief and remorse,\nthe Mokolé are satisfied and full negotiations begin.\nTheir offer is an alliance with the Garou, the restoration of the First Times.\nThey don’t recognize the Garou tribal divisions and assume that the elders who\nconfront them speak for all the canine shapeshifters, including the Nuwisha and\nKitsune. The negotiations should last for some time. Neither Changing Breed fully\ntrusts the other, and with good reason. Cliath Garou could be involved as liaisons,\nmessengers and guards. Elder characters will be sent to conduct the negotiations.\nWhen the Mokolé are satisfied that they can trust the Garou, they will explain\nthe true purpose of their coming. The Garou are the only ones who can attempt a\nquest into the Mokolé realm of Mnesis, the shared memory of Gaia. The Garou must\ndelve into this mental sea to retrieve the lost Gifts of the First Times, Gifts that a\nMokolé cannot use or even know, in order to use them against the Wyrm.\nTHE MNESIS QUEST\nThe werewolf or werewolves who choose to accept this mission first listen to a\nwarning from the Mokolé about the dangers of Mnesis quests. The monsters of\nmemory devour some who seek treasure in the sea of lost time; the memories\nthemselves can lure travelers to their doom, and some memories tear the mind apart.\nThat said, the chosen characters will be sent into the Memory of Gaia through the\nuse of teacher plants. The Dragon Breed cannot do so themselves, as their reptilian\nminds cannot learn Gifts from mammalian beings or spirits.\nThe quest itself is a fabulous roleplaying opportunity for Storytellers to exploit.\nStructure it as a strange descent through memories that the characters recognize as\nbelonging to their own past, to their grandparents, great-grandparents, and so on,\nback further and further in time. Each memory connects to the next through a door\nin a wall, a garden gate, a path through trees, crossing a stream and so on. Dream-\nHunters — powerful memories that take the shape of a dangerous enemy from the\ntime and place where the memory scene is set — might assault the Garou, and they\ncan be permanently killed only if the Garou travel to the memory where the creature\noriginated and destroy it there.\nFinally, the Garou arrive in the First Times, long before the Impergium or the\nWars of Rage, when all shapeshifters lived together in peace with Gaia and each\nother. The Earth is a wild place, and animals long extinct in the material world roam\nhere. A moot convenes to welcome the “visitors.” The Garou see bull-headed and\nboar-shaped changers at the moot that they attend: These are the lost Apis and\nGrondr, along with Camazotz bat-shifters and Khara Bastet. This should be a scene\nof great wonder and mystery, as things the Garou never knew existed make\nthemselves known. Learning the Gifts and rites in question should likewise be a\npowerful experience, especially the Last Rite (described on p. 97), which the\nchangers of the past impart sadly, hoping it will never be needed.\nTHE CLAW DESCENDS\nMeanwhile, humans have learned from their own scientists that the Claw\napproaches, and the result is worldwide hysteria. The Garou should be aware\nanywhere in the human world that humans are panicked, violent and very afraid.\nCaerns see lots of kin seeking shelter. Human governments try to prepare mineshaft\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n97\nCHAPTER THREE\nrefuges (complete with vending machines and cable TV) in places such as Cheyenne\nMountain. Among them are vampires, seeking to follow their herds into safety\nwhere a food supply awaits them and the sun never shines. Few other supernaturals\nattempt to enter these Weaver-thickened areas, whose inhabitants will likely be lost\nto the Weaver, even should they survive the Fall.\nAs the Claw nears the Earth, the US, Russia and possibly China try to use\nnuclear weapons or large lasers to shatter the asteroid or change its course.\nDepending on the tenor of the chronicle, the Changing Breeds might be involved\nin this effort as well. The United States sends astronauts with a nuclear charge to\nplant on the Claw; the Garou could even be involved in guarding or warding the\nastronauts from the dangers present on the asteroid. Storytellers might tell two tales\n— one of the astronauts planting the device, and the other of the Garou who follow\nin the Umbra to help them, without the astronauts’ knowledge.\nAt the same time, the use of nuclear weapons is seen as evil by almost all Gaian\ncreatures. How will Gaia respond to this activity? Does she withdraw Her gifts, as she\nis said to do for the Abominations? Will she accept that this is being done to save\nher? If a nuclear device goes out into space, then the Storyteller may rule that for\ndramatic purposes, it goes off and shatters the asteroid, but pieces of the Claw still\nstrike the Earth and the moon.\nWAKING THE MOON\nThe Mnesis quest has found many powerful Gifts and rites, and the threat of an\nasteroid hitting the Earth is sufficient to pull feuding tribes together. As the Claw\ngets closer, it becomes obvious that only one thing can be done to prevent Gaia’s\nabsolute destruction — the Last Rite, the Rite of Waking the Moon. This Level-Six\nrite requires all the permanent Gnosis Traits of all the ritemasters, meaning that they\nalmost certainly never perform any other rites. Despite their fear of this fate and their\nhostility toward one another, ritemasters from each Gaian tribe attend, along with\na few members of other Changing Breeds.\nThe players’ characters may be involved in the Last Rite as assistants to the\nritemasters. Due to the sacrifice it entails, though, they should not be full partici-\npants unless they do not wish to take part in the rest of the chronicle from that point.\nThe rite itself is spectacular — as the ritemasters chant, the moon begins to move,\nat first barely perceptibly, and then visibly slewing away from its usual path. Humans\ngo from panic into utter hysteria at this sight. As it passes through Earth’s shadow,\nthe moon enters eclipse for one final time, turning reddish-gray before becoming\nsmaller as it leaves Earth to block the path of the Claw.\nTHE SHATTERING OF LUNA\nRorg’s Claw strikes Luna with a gigantic explosion. Anyone watching the moon\nsees what seems to be a flaming hammer blow at the edge of the moon’s disc, splitting\nthe Moon in two. All lunar-connected supernatural creatures, including Garou,\nGurahl and Bastet, feel a sharp angina-like pain when that happens, as if they are\nhaving a heart attack. This feeling does not fade until the pieces of the moon set.\nFrom that point forward, it is no longer possible to regain Rage from the moon. Nor\nwill the moon’s light deter the undead.\nThe moon is not destroyed, but huge pieces of it are now blasted into solar orbit.\nIt is both damaged and in the wrong place. The largest remaining chunk ends up in\nan eccentric orbit around the sun, shepherding Earth’s orbit. For most of the time,\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n98\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nit is a bright unwinking star, as are the other planets, and Luna is reduced to Incarna\nstatus, incapable of doing much for Earth’s changers if any survive. About one month\nafter the Shattering, a final sign appears in the heavens. Clouds clear for a moment\nover the place where the characters are.\nAs the sun rises or sets, a huge brilliant comet with a prominent tail appears near\nthe place where the sun is about to rise, or has just set. Garou and Kin with any\nscientific knowledge realize that this is a huge chunk of the moon, falling so near the\nsun that it is boiling into space.\nTHE GREAT BLACK\nThe Fall means the end of human civilization for a long time. By itself, this\nwould be a disaster of apocalyptic proportions, but the Wyrm has more ambitious\nplans. The True Father wishes to use the suffering and horror of the Fall and the\nGreat Black to feed its own powers, to enable it to destroy Gaia’s defenders. From this\npoint forward, Garou face two challenges: first, the destruction of human, animal\nand plant life all around them, and second, the onslaught of the Wyrm’s evil in the\nchaos created by the asteroid impacts.\nMany of the quests given to packs relate to the horrors of the Fall and the Great\nBlack, though the skills and loyalties of each tribe and each Garou are part of the Quests\nas well. Silent Striders and Uktena might try to stop the Fall with rites and Umbra\njourneys. The Get and Fianna seek to hunt down the Wyrm-creatures and undead who\nrise to prominence in the new age. Bone Gnawers and Children of Gaia could seek to\naid suffering humans and wolves who freeze or starve in the cold darkness.\nNUKES, KNIVES AND SHARP STICKS\nSo what exactly happens to the world when it suffers multiple impacts from\nsuch large objects? The answer is that while the devastation of such a scenario\nshould always be widespread and terrible, at the same time it should be no more\nterrible than the Storyteller requires for her story. If she wants a number of cities\nto survive more or less intact, so be it. If all she wants left of civilization is a\nsmoldering ruin, let none be spared. Yes, billions of humans will die in the\nimmediate destruction of the impacts and the “follow-up” horrors to come —\npestilence, famine, war, etc. — but the quick-and-dirty answer is that nobody\nthe Storyteller needs to survive will die in the chaos, at least not right away.\nAnother important question is the general technology level she wants to\nhave in effect during the rest of the scenario. Do the impacts quickly reduce\neveryone to primitive tools as supplies of batteries, ammunition and gasoline run\nout? That kind of ending offers some advantages to Garou (well, except the Glass\nWalkers) who are long accustomed to using such tools. On the other hand, the\nend of civilization might see pockets of relatively modern life survive, perhaps\neven advance as governments at last unleash their secret technologies and black-\nbook projects in a desperate effort to maintain control. Players are likely to ask\nearly on exactly what services and utilities are still available, not to mention what\nweapons they can get their hands on, so careful consideration should be given to\njust how much of a technological impact will be felt during Ragnarok.\nIn the end, the Storyteller shouldn’t feel constrained to unleash any more\nchaos, destruction and horror than she feels is necessary for her particular scenario.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n99\nCHAPTER THREE\nFinally, remaining Garou must face the hell-hordes of the Wyrm in the Final\nBattles or defending the Last Caern. Storytellers, again, must decide which part of\nthe end to emphasize, and they should feel free to make both a part of the stories.\nWith septs encompassing multiple packs, they might wish to give each pack one or\nmore of the outlined plots that follow, then bring the survivors back together to face\nthe final stand of the Last Caern.\nHELLMOUTH\nAs Anthelios rises for the first time after the Fall, a new horror begins. Volcanic\nseams open in three places around the Earth, spewing lava and Wyrm-filth into the\ndying world. The Father Below, the True Father, now opens his jaws. These seams\nmanifest in Japan, California and the Great Rift of Africa. Huge cracks open in the\nearth’s body (one mile’s length or so of crack a day), swallowing animals, buildings,\npeople and rivers or lakes. The Jaws vary in width and zigzag and spiral, following no\nknown laws of geology or physics. Anyone viewing them from the air must make a\nWillpower Challenge as versus the Delirium, as the rifts form Wyrm-signs and the\nsight of these shapes can drive one mad.\nIn sight of the Jaws’ opening, all Gaian creatures are at a one-Trait penalty on\nall challenges. Caerns along the Jaws’ cracks drain and die at a rate of one level per\nday. Black Spiral Dancer Hives are planned with the Jaws in mind and aren’t\naffected. Any Gaian creature who comes close to the heat of the volcanic cracks\nsuffers one health level of lethal damage per minute that can be naturally healed only\nonce one is away from the heat. Wyrm creatures grow stronger from the eruptions\nand gain Gnosis from them as from a caern. This is the fulfillment of the Sixth Sign\nof the Prophecy of the Phoenix: Fire boils from the depths.\nNIGHT OF DARK FIRE\nAs if the Garou did not already have enough foes, the undead now pose a serious\nthreat to the continued existence of humans, including Kin. The Great Black enables\nthe vampires and other rots to realize their ancient End-Time “prophecies.” This is the\nSeventh Sign of the Prophecy of the Phoenix. On the first night after the Black begins,\nthe ancient vampires rise from their tombs, the thirst of ages driving them to seek and\nkill not only their offspring, but shapeshifters, whose blood is believed to be very\npotent. The Garou will have to assign packs to control or kill these terrible foes.\nMany tales could also center on the Garou who must make terrible choices, since\nnot all humans can be saved when Garou strength is limited. When Garou must choose,\nwill they favor humans who have needed skills? The young and innocent? Those whom\nthey deem attractive or potential mates? Can they live with their choices afterward?\nWhat of the vampires who offer aid to the Garou, claiming to know secret “magics” that\ncan defeat the ageless monsters? Can the undead be trusted, even for a moment? What\nif the alternative is that an ancient bloodsucker is free to raven and slay?\nSEEKING THE SHARDS\nThe Fall has damaged the Earth immensely, but the Shards and the Claws are\nas valuable as they are destructive. The sky-stones hold power for the Wyld and for\nthe world. The Garou have to reach the Shards of Luna before the Black Spiral\nDancers get to them, as they are almost the only means of regaining Rage as if Luna\nwere still whole. There are three Shards on Earth’s surface.\nThe Storyteller must invent places for the Three Shards of Luna to fall. While\nit is recommended that (metaphorically speaking) one fall to earth, one fall to sea\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n100\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nand one fall to sky, there is literally no end of possibilities for where they might be\nfound. Bear in mind that travel during this time is all but impossible by mortal means,\ndue to the chaos of the Great Black, and even Umbral travel is quite risky. Add to\nthat the fact that the Shards have fallen in forbidden places, are being actively\nsought by the minions of the Wyrm and might already be in the possession of another\ninterested party by the time the characters arrive. Material exists for quite a few\ninteresting stories just concerning the recovery of the Shards.\nTHE ASCENT FROM HELL\nThe Great Black, horrific as it is, is only the beginning of the End of All Songs.\nThe deaths of billions of humans and animals to hunger, fire and cold opens the\nmouth of darkness and allows nightmare to walk. The Wyrm’s Horde emerges from\nthe Jaws of the True Father and walks the Earth openly. Materializing bodies on\nEarth or possessing the dead, the Maeljin and their subordinates gather all that is evil\nand mad about them as the world dies.\nThen they begin to march.\nStorytellers should feel free to place any and all Wyrm-tainted enemies the players\nhave ever faced in the ranks of the Horde. Include a few they believed destroyed, newly\nreborn in the fires of the End Times, as well as any notable villains from the Book of the\nWyrm, Freak Legion and Possessed. There is literally no foe too weak or too strong for\nsome place in the Horde. Storytellers are also encouraged to personalize the different\ncamps of the enemy, however, as opposed to presenting it as simply a giant army on the\nmarch (though it is that as well). Agents of the Defiler Wyrm and Eater-of-Souls might\nact as scouts and spies, enticing foes to join the cause of the Horde or subverting their\nefforts at a critical moment. Minions of the Beast-of-War press hapless innocents into the\nranks of the damned or conduct hideous “live-fire” training exercises with their prisoners.\nA faceless army of evil is frightening, but not engaging on an individual level. A\nnightmarish legion headed by some of the characters’ worst enemies is at once epic and\npersonal, the best sort of storytelling for the End Times.\nHuman governments and military oppose the Horde as it advances on caerns,\nhowever unwittingly, but they fail to stop it. Indeed, the Horde absorbs many of the\ntroops arrayed against it in the process. The chaos and devastation that the Horde’s\nbirth and movement causes is secondary, however. The Horde intends to seek out\nGaia’s Defenders, the Garou, and destroy them.\nTHE BATTLES OF THE APOCALYPSE\nThe Wyrm’s Horde erupting onto the Earth ends all semblance of normalcy. No\none can continue to pretend that this is merely a natural disaster. Gaia’s remaining\nchildren now form a Gaian Host to oppose the Wyrm on the Battlefields of the\nApocalypse. The Garou can maneuver to sites near the Wyrm’s Hosts, attempting\nto take the offensive, or they can position themselves around caerns and kin, and\nallow the enemy to come to them. Where exactly the characters wind up during this\nphase of the conflict is up to them and the Storyteller.\nAlmost any place could be a battleground, but the Garou armies form up at places that\nare important to them, to humans or to the spirits. The Fall has killed many humans, but\nenough humans and Garou remain alive that the Wyrm has not yet won. As long as the\nGarou remain viable, even in the Umbra, they could always return and destroy the Wyrm’s\ncontrol of the ruined Earth. They must be annihilated for the conquest to be complete.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n101\nCHAPTER THREE\nIt is therefore recommended that the Storyteller devise a number of different\nsessions or even stories surrounding the battles that engulf the world during this time.\nWhether the sept moves as one to respond to various threats or individual packs split\nup and play a number of side sessions devoted to resolving smaller conflicts around\nthe world, the characters should be involved in a number of battles during this time\nas the Changing Breeds seek to turn back the tide of the Apocalypse.\nTHE LAST CAERN\nAfter a number of thrilling stories and pitched battles, the characters are called\nback together in one place, charged with finding any remaining Garou and kin they\ncan and defending them all at a vital caern. It might even be their own caern. This is\nhighly recommended for maximum dramatic impact, although if their own caern has\nalready been destroyed during the scenario, a suitably famous or important caern will\nalso suffice. Alternatively, the Storyteller could choose to have one caern remaining,\nperiod. While that choice might threaten to overshadow the players’ characters as they\nbecome part of a host of remaining Garou fighting thousands of Wyrm creatures, it has\nits own dramatic potential for a “last stand” of the Garou Nation. As written, however,\nthis scene assumes that the characters’ own caern is under siege.\nWherever and whatever the caern is, it will be the last one the characters must\ndefend. Soon after they have arrived, urgent word comes from beyond that the\nWyrm’s forces have surrounded the last surviving caerns and are readying their final\ncharge. While this means that the Horde’s forces have been spread thinner than\nusual, it also means that there will be nowhere to run if they fail and no help coming\nfrom the outside. The players must hold the caern on their own against an army\ndestined to bring about no less than the end of the world.\nFortunately, the characters have a few advantages. First, they are on their home\nterritory, and they should have at least enough time to make some plans that take\nadvantage of that fact. Second, the Horde must attack the caern directly rather than\nuse weapons of mass destruction. They might seek to capture important characters,\nrecover valuable fetishes (especially Shards) for corruption to the Wyrm or any other\nreason the Storyteller devises, but in the end, it limits their use of large-scale\nweapons. Lastly, in response to the last-ditch nature of the conflict, the caern\nresponds with a flood of Gaian energies, essentially becoming a level-five caern for\nthe duration of the battle. (If it was already such a powerful caern, suitably powerful\nspirits appear to aid the Garou during their final hour.)\nThis is not to say that it will be an easy battle, however, or even just one battle\nat all. Early reports of enemy numbers are grim, and the Storyteller should see to it\nthat the enemies represented are of types particularly suited to the caern’s destruc-\ntion. (The Horde did send forces for this specific purpose, after all.) Likewise, while\narms and tactics vary from place to place, the Fall has made many weapons widely\navailable, and Garou should expect to face gas, grenades and assault rifles loaded\nwith silver. Specifically anti-Garou weapons such as those devised by Pentex should\nbe rare, but still present, likely carried by old enemies of the characters or similar\npowerful foes. At least one or two “probing” attacks are likely to occur as the Horde\ntests the caern’s numbers and defenses, not to mention spying efforts or attempts to\nconvert the defenders to the cause of the Wyrm. Only when the Horde is ready does\nit launch a full-out attack.\nThen the Final Battle begins.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n102\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nNeedless to say, the Storyteller should play up the desperation of this battle as\nmuch as possible. This is the climactic point of the chronicle, if not the actual end of\nthe world. There are no negotiations, no way to make peace. There is no retreat. This\nis the characters’ last stand. Many of the brave Garou, kin and ordinary humans and\nwolves the sept members knew are dead. The spirits they once called friends have been\ncorrupted or destroyed. Cities fall, forests burn, oceans turn to blood. The sky blackens\nwith debris and smoke. Food and fuel run out. Even if all the Wyrm creatures die, the\nsept might not make it. But they have to fight, Garou and kin together.\nAnd that is the true story of the Garou: courage in the face of overwhelming\nodds, an unwillingness to lie down and die even when defeat seems assured.\nBATTLE OR SIEGE?\nOne important question to ask is whether the fight to hold the Last Caern\nwill be a single battle or a protracted siege. Quite simply, the answer is whatever\nyou believe the players will find more entertaining. While some players enjoy\ntrying to figure out the subtleties of siege planning, logistics, establishing\ndefensive positions and so on, others find such mundane details highly tedious.\nBalancing the two extremes is critical to the drama of this last stand. Players\nshould not expect to succeed if all they do is charge blindly into combat without\nplanning, but they also shouldn’t be forced to put many more pins in a map than\nthey find entertaining either.\nAFTERMATH\nAssuming they survive — and that’s a fairly large assumption — the nature of\nthe world the characters encounter upon emerging from the fight for the Last Caern\ndepends on the ending chosen by the Storyteller and achieved by the players. Three\nendings appear here, one for each of the Triat. A fourth ending reflects a more\nmeditative “turning of the wheel” with more open-ended possibilities. While the\nStoryteller will have to choose which ending to use, and whether the chronicle will\ncontinue, these offerings will serve as useful guidelines.\nTHE WYLD’S END\nThe characters find that the impact of Rorg and Luna has caused a mass extinction\n— a “Wonderwork.” Most humans and large animals are dead, along with Garou and\nKin. In fact, the majority of living Garou are probably the survivors of the Final Battle\nthat raged around the world. Human civilization will no longer exist outside a few refuges,\nwhich won’t last forever. Damaged as it is, the world will have returned to nature.\nGaia is alive, though extremely weak. Generations of ritual and sacrifice will\nbarely return her to consciousness, even if the Balance of the Triat is restored and\nmaintained. The characters will find it hard to survive; homids will mourn the deaths\nof almost all their kind, while lupus have trouble finding either prey or mates. The\nWyld world will seem harsh to many, but it will slowly return to a balanced whole.\nTHE WEAVER’S ENDING\nThe world might live, but bereft of spirit. Earth recovers slowly from the impact\nof the huge chunks of Rorg and Luna. The Gauntlet is almost impassable (rated nine\nor higher everywhere), and Garou huddle in Umbral Realms. Other supernatural\nbeings are mostly gone also; the world operates according to science. Magic is dying\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n103\nCHAPTER THREE\nor dead. Garou who remain in this world no longer change. Homids return to being\nhumans, with “wolf souls” and an intense love for the wild. Lupus are “wise wolves.”\nSurviving metis become humans or wolves for the rest of their lives, or they remain\nin Crinos, Hispo or Glabro form almost permanently.\nThe Weaver’s ending leaves some humans and animals alive in the possibility\nof growth, life and renewal. Stories set here would be like those in our own (non-\nmagical) world, with the memory of the lost Mother, Gaia.\nTHE WYRM’S ENDING\nThe Wyrm’s victory is the world’s ruin. Life continues, but horribly changed.\nThe land is covered with toxin-resistant weeds and dead trees, as well as vermin and\npests where larger animals have died. Humans steal from, murder and eat each other\nto live, or worse yet, serve the Wyrm-Lords openly for their daily “bread.” If the\ncharacters live to see this horror, make it obvious that this is not simply a “regime\nchange.” It is the death of Gaia, and the corruption of all upon her corpse to the\nservice of hate and filth.\nThis chronicle probably ends with all the characters dying as heroes or refugees.\nMore depressing would be to have them surrender, if the Dark One will have them.\nWhile life as a Wyrm-Lord would never have a dull moment, it would be beyond the\nscope of this chapter.\nStorytellers should be warned to think carefully before using this ending.\nAllowing the characters to triumph in their climactic moment, only to see that their\nefforts ultimately mean nothing, is an extremely harsh twist to spring on them, and\nit might lead to a great deal of dissatisfaction after all the blood and sweat and tears\nthey have endured. Yes, the overall theme of Werewolf has always been tragic,\nwithout much possibility of a happy ending, but that doesn’t mean your players want\nit to end that way — and if you’re not trying to entertain them, what have you been\ndoing all along?\nTHE WHEEL TURNS\nThese three endings are not the only possible ones. The Beast Courts of the\nOrient, including the Stargazers and other hengeyokai, have long seen time as\ncyclical, and the world as a turning wheel. The end, to some, seems to others to be\nnothing more than another beginning. Perhaps this is a literal change, in which the\ncharacters emerge to find the world entirely different, with few signs of the previous\none anywhere in sight. It might be more metaphorical instead, but in the end, the\nuniverse continues on as it always has.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n104\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n105\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nCHAPTER FOUR:\nASCENSION\nCHAPTER FOUR:\nASCENSION\n105\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nTHE BITTER ROAD\nWhy is Ascension desirable? What makes it so precious that mages would suffer,\nkill and die for it?\nMost of us muddle along, approaching our finite time on this world with varying\ndegrees of passion, fear, apprehension, generosity and smallmindedness. We are all\ntapestries composed of doubt and desire, selfishness and a higher drive. Each of us is\nthe story of the world we know.\nYet at the same, time, all of these instincts, thoughts, emotions and relation-\nships are contained within us. There is no escape; we have to resolve these paradoxes.\nWhen pain contradicts our desire for comfort, we search for surcease. When\nignorance contradicts our need to know, we learn. That’s no different than what\nmages strive to do. The paradoxes are different, but the motivation is the same. After\neach moment, their stories, like ours, move forward.\nLaws of Ascension is a game about these stories. Mages craft grand tales, taking\nthe universe and weaving it on the looms of their paradigms. Ascension is not the\nend; it is the whole meaning of that story. Mages encounter Paradox when the\nbedrock of their beliefs clashes with the rest of the universe. It’s a continuity\nproblem, a strange leap that makes the story seem less authentic. It calls the meaning\nof the mage’s life into question.\nSo the purpose of Ascension — the purpose of a mage and, some would argue, the\npurpose of our own lives — is to integrate our strange encounters with reality and craft\nthem into a consistent whole. As mages progress, they expand their paradigms to\ninclude new phenomena. Their personal stories open wider windows into the universe.\nWho are they, if they are not that story? That’s where self-actualization,\nmeaning and Ascension come from. The Awakened want to tell a story that\nconfronts all paradoxes — that encompasses the cosmos.\nIt’s a worthy goal for anyone.\nSTORYTELLING THE IMPOSSIBLE\nFive possible paths to Ascension — or Oblivion — have been charted in this chapter,\nfor the Storyteller and the players to use, alter or ignore as they see fit. Before those scenarios\nCHAPTER FOUR:\nASCENSION\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n106\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nare detailed, however, a few additional topics have been covered to help Storytellers address\nsome of the unique concerns of an Ascension chronicle and help bring it to life.\nTHE AVATAR STORM\nAlthough it is the most notorious sign of the End Times, mages are only\nbeginning to understand the Avatar Storm. Certain Mind, Spirit and Prime Effects\ncan circumvent it; complex scrying spells can detect calm metaphysical spaces.\nFurthermore, mages have identified certain people who can bend the path of the\nstorm to protect themselves. A rare few can even shield other mages. Though the\nStoryteller is free to design her own story behind the Avatar Storm it is (in canonical\nterms) the result of terrible weapons employed by the Technocracy that have\nshattered a number of Avatars mixed with souls of the dead. Feeling the pull of\nAscension approaching, these Avatar shards desperately seek to find hosts so that\nthey can reach enlightenment before it’s too late.\nThis is the reason that passing through the Storm causes so much damage. The\nshards are actually attempting to inhabitthose passing through, clawing at the Avatar\nin residence. As the end approaches, some of their attempts may even succeed,\noccasionally resulting in the bizarre and frightening beings known as the Anakim.\nOf course, many hosts simply die from the strain.\nTHE ROGUE COUNCIL\nTradition mages and some Orphans around the world have begun to receive\nmysterious messages from an entity known as the Sphinx, part of an enigmatic body\nknown as the Rogue Council. These messages appear in countless forms — scrawled\non napkins, sent on DVD, called up as email — but their ultimate message is one of\nresistance and revolution, calling on the Traditions to renew the war against\nmediocrity and seek Ascension. Though few if any characters will ever discover the\ntrue identity of individuals behind the Rogue Council, it is (as a matter of canon)\na collection of the Avatars of former members of the Tradition Council, guided by\na Psychopomp known as the Sphinx.\nNeedless to say, a message from the Rogue Council is an excellent way to introduce\na number of clues (or mysteries) into any scenario, as well as offer guidance if the\ncharacters are truly at a loss. The Rogue Council does not intervene directly, however.\nThat would ruin the free will of those involved, and that goes against its personal goal\nof promoting Ascension. Storytellers might also wish to reinvent the Rogue Council for\ntheir chronicle. (Perhaps the Nephandi corrupted the Avatars, or Control has devised\na devious new strategy to disrupt the Traditions.) Keep in mind that no matter what, the\nRogue Council needs to be untraceable and able to gather information from a wide range\nof sources, and it has to have a compelling motive for communicating with mages. See\nManifesto: Transmissions from the Rogue Council for more on this group.\nTHE PSYCHOPOMPS\nFirst introduced in Manifesto, the Psychopomps (“conductors of souls”) are\nspirits with the power to direct Avatars to specific incarnations. As Ascension\napproaches, these guides act with increasing frequency, trying desperately to sheperd\ntheir charges toward Ascension before all hope of doing so is lost. Their methods are\ndecidedly obscure and indirect — an Avatar cannot be forced to seek Ascension by\na rote series of tasks — and seldom terribly forgiving. While they recognize that the\nmortal shell that houses the Avatar is vital to giving it some direction, they have no\nproblem pushing that flesh to the limit if that is what Ascension requires. Concerns\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n107\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nunrelated to Ascension, such as feelings of affection for one’s family or a personal\ninterest in a particular mundane subject, are utterly unimportant to them.\nStorytellers are encouraged to use these alien spirits however they desire in their\nchronicle. Whether they are cruel taskmasters, benevolent guides or simply enig-\nmatic messengers depends on what the story requires. In no event should the\nPsychopomps take center stage, however, as such action is antithetical to their very\nnature. They might become more direct than ever as Ascension approaches, but that\nis the extent of their involvement.\nYOUR OWN PERSONAL PSYCHOPOMP\nThe Avatar Guide represents the desires of the Avatars in the chronicle. He\nselects when an Avatar will drive a mage to a Seeking, and during Ascension\nplenty of Seekings will be going on. He must know in advance if you have any\nSeekings planned, and if he can initiate spontaneous Seekings. Scout locations\nwith the Avatar Guide and discuss ideas for scenes and settings, addressing how\nyou will handle any required extra characters or represent any magical effects.\nThe race for Ascension can be part of all the scenarios. Avatars feel the\nend approaching and are scared—they have limited time to reach Ascension\nor face Oblivion. Whether the end is due to the Gauntlet closing or the end\nof sentient life on the planet, the race is on. Indeed, the Avatar Guide must\nbecome the monkey on the characters’ backs, urging them to strive to Ascend,\nto better themselves and increase their chances of surviving the events to\ncome. These urges manifest more frequently as the story continues.\nPIECES OF INFINITY\nThe following systems and mechanics are designed to help portray different\naspects of an Ascension scenario, as magic slides out of control, begins to fade away\nor even is extinguished entirely. Also included are mechanics regarding the Anakim,\ntwisted Sleeper victims of the Avatar Storm — or mages who dare to call upon great\npower as the End Times approach.\nREINFORCING CONSENSUS\nAs the Masses move farther from the spiritual aspects of life, magic in all its\nforms becomes harder to use.\nAt the subtlest level, the Domino Effect (Laws of Ascension, pg. 131) increases. Each\ncoincidental effect cast in the same area increases in difficulty by two Traits. Coincidental\nmagic becomes vulgar at four Traits. The Domino effect now bleeds off at only one Trait\nevery two turns. These numbers increase as the story progresses. Eventually, casting more\nthan one Effect in the same area instantly causes the latter Effect to fail, and it might collapse\nthe initial Effect (make a Simple Test). It might even attract a major Paradox Backlash,\nfactoring all the Sphere levels affecting the area into the Paradox Trait total.\nStronger Paradox\nIf you use Paradox decks, increase the number of cards drawn as the Consensus\nsolidifies. At its strongest levels, draw one card per Sphere level used in the Effect,\nor one per Paradox Trait involved in the Backlash.\n• When casting vulgar magic, you gain one additional Paradox Trait (or more),\nas well as the usual one-per-Sphere award.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n108\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\n• Sleepers who witness vulgar Effects inflict two (or more) Paradox Traits.\n• Conjunctional vulgar Effects attract one Paradox Trait per Sphere level used,\nnot just per the highest level.\n• Coincidental Effects grant one Paradox Trait.\n• Botched coincidental Effects garner double the normal level of Paradox Traits.\n• Coincidental Effects draw Paradox Traits just like vulgar magic — effectively,\nthere is no coincidence.\n• Botched vulgar Effects garner double the normal level of Paradox Traits.\n• Effects draw two Paradox Traits per Sphere level used.\nEventually, the Consensus can no longer tolerate magic, and any Effect attracts\nParadox spirits, or whisks the mage into a Paradox Realm or Quiet. Ultimately,\nmagic does not work, no matter how much Paradox is risked. Effects simply fail.\nWEAKENING CONSENSUS\nAcceptance of magic, in whatever form, loosens the weave of the Tapestry, and\nmagic is gradually easier to use.\nThe Domino Effect weakens. Effects in the same area increase the Domino\ndifficulty by one Trait on every second subsequent Effect. There is no cap on the\nmodifier, so if you can continue to cast magic as long as you can overcome the\ndifficulty. The difficulty modifier bleeds off at two Traits for each turn spent without\nmagic being cast in the area. Decrease the growth rate of the Domino Effect as the\nConsensus further weakens. At its weakest, there is no Domino Effect, and magic can\nbe cast repeatedly in the area without added difficulty.\nWeaker Paradox\nIf you are using a Paradox deck, reduce the severity of Backlashes on the cards,\nor reduce the incidence of cards being drawn. Backlash effects can be reduced to a\nlevel where only the mage is affected. At this stage, optional Paradox rules could be\ntossed aside, and you could revert to the basic damage system of Paradox. Beyond\nthat, damage reduces further, either in terms of health levels dealt, or by being\nreduced first to lethal, then bashing damage instead. Eventually, there is no Paradox.\n• When casting vulgar magic, you gain one less Paradox Trait than normal,\nwith a minimum of one Trait.\n• Sleepers who are familiar with your paradigm no longer count as witnesses.\n• Vulgar magic incurs half its normal amount of Paradox (rounded down).\n• Botched coincidental Effects grant one less Paradox Trait than normal.\n• Sleepers no longer count as witnesses.\n• All magic is considered coincidental — you gain Paradox only if you botch an Effect.\nA completely free magical world has no Paradox, so anything can happen. With\nthe specter of Paradox gone, mages can twist reality as much as they like. Anything\nthey cosmically screw up is their own problem.\nTHE GAUNTLET\nGreat changes are wrought on the Gauntlet as the End Times re-forge the fabric\nof the Tellurian. While the specific strength of the Gauntlet in any given area will\ndepend on the immediate environment, its history and Storyteller requirements, the\neffects of the changing Gauntlet are wide-reaching. Your Spirit Keeper is going to\nhave a bit of work on her hands keeping track of it.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n109\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nClenching the Fist\nAs the Masses drift deeper into their apathy and farther from their spiritual roots,\nthe Gauntlet’s fingers inexorably close. Some scenarios have their own timeline for this\nphenomenon. The events of Ascension accelerate what has, until now, been a gradual\nprocess. This is reflected in a game by increasing the “Most places” Gauntlet rating (Laws\nof Ascension, pg. 221). The sequence is arbitrary, based on the pace of the story.\nFor example, in a game that meets once a month, or for a network pacing global\nplots, the Gauntlet could thicken at one Trait every three months. If you need it\nfaster or slower for the sake of story, make it so. The maximum Gauntlet rating\nremains 10 Traits. Note: Your metaplot could equally well have a Gauntlet that is\nwinnowed away, reversing the process and decreasing the “Most places” Gauntlet\nrating at your required rate.\nEven if the “Most places” Gauntlet rating reaches that level, there are still areas\nof varying thickness due, in part, to the Avatar Storm. The eventual collapse of the\nGauntlet, if you use that story element, occurs due to a basic physical property —\nfatigue. If you riddle the strongest metal with irregular cracks, and then place it under\ngreat strain in multiple directions, it has to give eventually. Even a 10-Trait Gauntlet\ncollapses under intense metaphysical pressure.\nSHALLOWINGS\nProgressively, the Gauntlet rips due to the continual slicing it receives from the Storm.\nPreviously thin or unstable areas drop to a zero-Trait Gauntlet rating, and the Umbra mixes\nwith the world. Nodes, for example, are usually in thin regions of the Gauntlet, and mystic\nprecautions by the Node’s guardians (if any) normally prevent Shallowings. Shallowings\ncan open anywhere, but they normally do so outside of urban areas, due to the reinforcing\neffect of the Consensus. The duration of these new Shallowings varies, but they appear to\nbe growing longer and more stable. Many grow in size.\nThe Umbra is a reflection of reality. In areas where the Gauntlet reaches 10\nTraits in strength, it has effectively become a cloth draped over the mirror. While\nthe memory of what was once there sustains the reflection for a while, each zone\neventually fades from existence. This gradual fade could be the reason that Umbral\ncreatures are appearing with increasing regularity at Shallowings — they’re crowd-\ning into what little Umbral space remains and spilling out through the cracks.\nAll the threats of the Umbra are just as dangerous as ever. Shallowings allow Umbral\ncreatures to enter the material world. Technocrat characters might be involved in\nbattling or cleaning up after them. The inverse is also possible. Sleepers wandering into\nthe Umbra are ill prepared for what waits within. Those few who do return are likely in\nno condition to relate their adventures, and even if they can, the men with the white\ncuddle-jackets will be happy to listen to them. Additionally, in the “Judgment” scenario,\nSleepers face Avatar shards that thrust Enlightenment upon them.\nTraveling through a Shallowing into the Umbra does not cause Storm damage\n— no Gauntlet, no Storm. Instead shards crowded by a constricting or fading Umbra\nmight actively rush at mages who wander near, drawn by the strength of the Avatar.\nEach scene, at the Storyteller’s discretion, a burst of shards breaks through the\nShallowing, hitting the nearest Awakened target, causing one level of aggravated\ndamage. The mage might be able to predict such a flurry with an Awareness test,\nallowing a few turns of action to avoid the shards. Nearby Sleepers might also be hit\nby shard flurries, possibly Awakening as a result.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n110\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nANAKIM\nOnce the permanent version of this ritual is completed, the mage has become\na new creature: an Anakim — part mage, part spirit.\nReflecting this alteration, the character’s prior Advantage and Disadvantage\nchanges to reflect this new status. He no longer has a speciality Sphere. All other\naspects of the character remain unaltered.\nNew Advantage: Alien Presence\nThe Psychopomp’s essence is too alien for mages to tame. Anakim cannot be\nsupernaturally compelled with MindorSpirit Effects or by similar powers. Archmaster\nEffects are an exception to this rule, at the Storyteller’s discretion.\nNew Disadvantage: Dedication\nAt any time the Avatar Guide or Storyteller feels the character is not working\ntoward Ascension with his Psychopomp, they can engage the character in a Willpower\nChallenge, with a difficulty based on the character’s lack of diligence. Minor\ndeviations require the Anakim to overcome only three or four Traits. Outright and\nextended avoidance inflicts a nine-Trait difficulty, perhaps more. Failure means that\nthe Psychopomp assumes control for the remainder of the scene. The Avatar is on the\nPsychopomp’s side, so it will not allow the mage to use magic against this effect.\nIf the mage continues to break its agreement with the Psychopomp, it might\nwithdraw its essence and rend the Avatar completely, leaving the mage an insane\ntwisted wreckage of drooling flesh. You have been warned.\nANAKIM ROTES\nYou can use the essence fragment to perform the following Effects. All are\ncast as per the rules for normal rotes, requiring Static Arete Challenges against\na base difficulty of six Traits. These powers are not familiar to the mage, and if\nthe fragment ever leaves his Pattern, he may not use them. The powers come\nstraight from the Psychopomp (being rotes from the Telos Sphere), although\nthey are powered by a mage’s Avatar. Should the Psychopomp feel that the\nactivation of a given power is inappropriate, it will cancel the power, possibly\ninflicting some punishment as well.\nNEW ROTE: HOLY UNION\nAdept Spirit, Disciple Prime, Disciple Mind\nYou call a Psychopomp and ask it to partially possess you with a fragment\nof its essence. Thereafter, you can use a limited version of the spirit’s soul-\nguiding power. It reflexively protects you from the Avatar Storm in its varied\nmanifestations, but it can also incorporate incarnate and disincarnate Avatars.\nSystem:Spiritcalls the Psychopomp from beyond the Horizon, Prime prepares\nyou to assimilate the essence fragment permanently. You can cast the spell without\nPrime, but the duration lasts only one game session. Any corruption effects you gain\nduring this period remain even after the essence is discharged. The fragment is\nactually sentient, so communicating with it telepathically requires Mind.\nThe spell requires 14 Grades of Success to cast permanently (or 10 to last\na single session), plus one per additional subject. As your Avatar balks at the\nalien presence and the Effect is mentally and spiritually taxing, add two Traits\nto the spell’s difficulty. The rote is always vulgar without witness.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n111\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nYou can influence only those Avatars (including Avatar shards) that don’t\noppose your will. Otherwise, you suffer corruption. Storytellers should be aware that\nthe Storm’s primitive consciousness is largely unaware of the suffering it inflicts, but\nliving Avatars certainly oppose attempts to pull them from the path to Ascension.\nControl Avatar Storm: You can adjust the severity of the Avatar Storm in the\nimmediate area by one level of damage, up or down for one minute/conflict. This\npower does not normally attract corruption effects.\nGrades of Success: Each grade adds levels of damage or extends the area or duration.\nAvatar Construct: You can shape the Avatar Storm (if it’s present) into a\nrough form, such as a barrier, weapon or shield. All these forms are invisible to\ncharacters without magical senses, (although Awareness may detect their presence\nand Resonance) and cause damage only to Awakened beings or creations. Unless\nmentioned otherwise, each Effect lasts for only one conflict/minute. This power does\nnot normally inflict corruption effects. Choose one of the following Effects:\n•Shard Blast: You direct a stream of shards at a nearby target, causing one level\nof aggravated damage. Treat this as a normal missile attack. This Effect lasts only a\nsingle action.\n•Weapon: You form a simple weapon that is used as per normal combat rules. It causes\none level of aggravated damage, and it has three Bonus Traits and no Negative Traits.\n• Shield: Similar to a magnetic shield (Laws of Ascension, pg. 204), this small\nbarrier protects against magical damage at up to two Traits per turn, to a maximum\nof 10 total Traits deflected. This Effect expires either when it deflects its last Trait\nof damage or at the end of the minute/conflict.\n• Barrier: A wall of whirling shards protects a small area/room. Susceptible\nsubjects passing through the barrier take one level of aggravated damage, and magic\nEffects attempting to cross the barrier are affected as with the Cocoon.\n• Cocoon: Shards drawn about you distort magic cast at you, opposing the\nmagic with five Traits of Storm-Tainted Resonance. The Cocoon also protects\nagainst similar powers, such as vampiric Thaumaturgy, Psychic Phenomena and\nwerewolf Rites. Static powers such as Dominate or Presence are unaffected.\nGrades of Success: Each grade adds an additional level of damage or an\nadditional target affected, or it extends the duration or range by one grade.\nOverwhelm Sleeping Avatar: You direct the Avatar Storm into a Sleeper with\nsuch intensity that it destroys the Sleeper’s own Avatar and will. You must generate\nmore Grades of Success than the target’s Willpower. Victims become the mage’s\nmindless thralls and eventually mutate to duplicate her physical corruption.\nWhen targeting a supernatural being, you must also generate sufficient Grades\nof Success to exceed the current level of his supernatural power source (Gnosis,\nBlood Traits, Conviction, etc.). If successful, the being loses all of its supernatural\nattributes, leaving it bereft of a soul or spiritual power. Effectively, he becomes a\nmortal minion as his Pattern is violated by the Storm.\nSupernatural creatures and partially Awakened mortals — sorcerers, psychics,\nghouls, etc. — can resist this Effect by expending a permanent Willpower Trait.\nFollowing that expenditure, they cannot ever be targeted by this power again. The\nEffect automatically fails.\nAwakened mages are immune to this Effect, as are the imbued. This power\nalmost always invokes a corruption effect.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n112\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nJUDGMENT\nThe tenth and final Sphere is Judgement; bliss and damnation are at hand.\nAs mages progress, they suffer. Thus has it always been, regardless of time, place\nor culture. The Traditions call the journey the Path of Thorns: a trail that has bled their\nfellowship to the last drop. Now, we reach the end of that bitter road, to discover why\nAscension and Armageddon are one. In the end, their torment is the key to victory.\nThere are great powers loose in these final days. Voormas. The revealed Rogue\nCouncil. An ancient conspiracy that lies at the root of the Traditions and Technoc-\nracy. But these are not the decisive elements of the story. Your characters will\nultimately decide humanity’s fate.\nUNDER PRESSURE (OPTIONAL RULE)\nIn the rush to Ascend, and if it sees the need, the Avatar pumps the\nPattern of the mage with bursts of inspiration and magic, like hitting a mystic\nnitrous switch. The Avatar grants temporary bursts of raw Quintessence,\nallowing the host to overcome physical hurdles, or it drops pure enlighten-\nment in the mage’s lap so he can get on with more important matters. These\nbursts correspond to matters important to the Avatar, not necessarily the\nmage. Sometimes, the pressure is more than the host can handle.\nThis is not a power that a player can call upon. At the Storyteller or\nAvatar Guide’s discretion, the Avatar grants temporary Arete to the mage,\nwhich can raise her Arete beyond her normal limit, allowing her to use\nstronger magic. Each Trait above that limit either causes one level of\naggravated damage (healed as normal) or inflicts a temporary derangement\nappropriate to the situation. The duration of the boost and any after-effects are\nup to the Storyteller, but all fade by the end of the combat or scene.\nThe Avatar Guide or Storyteller can consider other Trait boosts with\nsimilar results, should the situation require it, such as adding Mental Traits to\nbreak a tie when solving a critical puzzle or granting a Stealth retest during an\nimportant reconnaissance mission. Repeated boosts result in lasting disrup-\ntions to the mage’s Pattern, such as damage that will not heal, reduced\nmaximum Mental Traits or permanent derangements.\nYou might permit characters to undertake Seekings based on the events\nthey just experienced, however, learning why the matter was so important to\nthe Avatar. Allow them to enter Experience debt if necessary, paying for new\nArete with their next few Experience Traits. If this enlightenment takes them\npast their Willpower limit, they cannot use the new Arete Trait until their\nWillpower reaches a suitable level.\nConversely, if the Avatar strongly disagrees with the mage’s forthcoming\nactions, it can attempt to cripple the result. The Avatar Guide initiates a\nSimple Test. Depending on the level of importance to the Avatar, either a win\nor a win-or-tie is required for the mage to resist the Avatar. If the Avatar wins,\nit can interfere in the character’s test to perform its intended action. It can\nrequire a retest or inflict a difficulty penalty up to half the rating of the Avatar.\nIf the Simple Test required a win, the Avatar can require the mage to expend\na temporary Willpower Trait to perform the action.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n113\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nLet’s look at what led us to this point, but don’t forget that all of this has come to\npass so that your characters can face a choice: Will they trust the universe, or damn it?\nREALITY ON THE BRINK\nNow, in the wake of the Reckoning and turmoil throughout the Tellurian,\nmages plot and struggle. The Awakened suspect that humanity’s Final Days are at\nhand. Some factors deserve special consideration as the End Times approach.\nHEIR APPARENT\nInThe Fragile Path, Akrites Salonikas warned that, if allowed to live, Heylel Teomim\nwould do more than betray the Traditions. He would graft them onto the Order of Reason.\nCombined, the Awakened under his banner would turn Earth into a charnel house. He\nwould rule under the name Moloch and cast rebel magi from the Earth. Moloch’s dynasty\nwould last beyond his death, and surviving mages would return to the world to overthrow\nhis two heirs. Despite the suspect motives of the Council, it was a good thing that the\nBetrayer died hundreds of years ago. It avoided a terrifying future — didn’t it?\nOne successor remains. That mage carries the Avatar of one of Heylel’s children\nand therefore, half of his mystic secrets — and she’s a member of one of the cabals.\nThe Storyteller should choose one character, portrayed by someone who can play\nout temptation but avoid grandstanding. No special Traits are required, but you\nmight want to use it to justify a high Destiny and foreshadow it in Seekings and other\nstories. This character will be pivotal but not indispensable. In the story, we’ll call\nher (or him; gender is not important) Heylel’s Heir.\nCHAOTIC PROPHECY\nOne sign of the end occurs in the months leading up to our story. Divination\nmagic begins to twist and fail, encountering a cloud of Storm-Tainted Resonance that\nconfuses omens and defeats statistical analysis. Mages can usually foretell their\nimmediate future, but predictions about global events and the fate of magical societies\nbecome confused. In many cases, new visions contradict previous predictions.\nStorytellers should use this fact carefully. Don’t deny players the functional\naspects of Time magic (such as detecting danger or gathering moderate amounts of\nintelligence), but do emphasize that the old rules of causality are being rewritten,\nmaking it difficult to determine the future fate of the world. The one consistent\nelement of them is that everything familiar teeters on the edge of destruction.\nNOT ANOTHER CHOSEN ONE!\nThere are several options for Storytellers who are wary of making one character\nthe center of such an important prophecy. One solution is to simply alter and expand\nthe prophecy so that it includes more characters — perhaps several of the characters\nin the chronicle are reincarnated members of the First Cabal, destined to help unite\nthe Traditions once more. That is just one possible alternative. With some time, an\ninventive Storyteller can devise any number of ways to link a group of characters\n(preferably representing most if not all the cabals in the chronicle) through prophecy.\nDoing so not only makes it less necessary to make sure that one character survives, but\nit also helps balance out the importance of all the characters in the chronicle.\nAnother option is to simply forgo the role of “destined” characters in this\nscenario altogether, or at least downplay their importance to the story. While\nthey might have some important parts to play, so do the other characters.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n114\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nLIGHT OF THE PHOENIX\nThis scenario formally begins with rumors and ominous dreams plaguing the\nAwakened. The Traditions have adapted to the sign of the Sphinx, with some seeing\na call to war and others fearing a coming disaster. The Technocracy eschews the grand\nstrategies of the old Ascension War for street fighting and other bloody conflicts.\nThe characters are called by omens, Rogue Council transmissions and prophetic\ndreams, leading up to a subtle but urgent need to attend no less than a meeting of the\nNew Horizon Council, the current governing body of the Traditions. The Storyteller\nshould feel free to customize, elaborate on and add new signs to augment what follows.\nThe decision to attend the Council meeting should not seem like something the\ncharacters are doing to kill time, but a matter of overwhelming urgency for every cabal.\nTHE DREAMS\nDuring sleep, meditation or a Seeking, Heylel’s Heir dreams. The dream is an\ninfectious one, reaching out to every person with close ties to her — her cabal at least,\nand possibly the rest of the characters as well. The Heir is covered in blood and\nwrapped in a white cloth. A giant looms above her in rich robes, standing three times\nher height, with phoenixes and sphinxes worked in brocade along the collar.\nKnowledgeable characters recognize the robe’s rich, 15th-century cut. The giant’s\nsex is indistinguishable, but it has long, blond hair. Bright twin stars obscure its face.\nThe room has cold, stone floors. Huge tapestries are covered with the sign of the\ncaduceus below a crown: a fusion of common Hermetic and old Solificati symbolism.\nHeylel’s Heir feels exhausted, as if she’s completed a great journey on foot. The other\ndreamers take on their normal self-image but feel like they’re being watched. They sense\nthat the giant is trying to communicate, but the voice seems lost and muted, as though it’s\nspeaking through a room full of babbling voices. Characters with high AwarenessandPrime\nsenses detect voices whispering in the shadows: the Storm-Tainted Resonance associated\nwith the Avatar Storm. No matter what the characters attempt, they cannot communicate\nwith the giant, although it feels more important to do so with each passing attempt.\nPHOENIX PROPHECIES\nA DVD arrives a few days later, stamped with the mark of the Sphinx. As is usual for\na Rogue Council message, there are no arcane connections to any deliverer. It appears\nalongside the rest of a character’s DVDs or in a prominent, mundane place. The DVD has\none track, and showing what appears to be the interrogation of “Phoenix” — a known\nprophet and emissary of the Rogue Council — by two Technocratic agents. She quickly\nturns the tables on her interrogators, however, revealing personal information about them,\ndisabling the security devices placed on her and effortlessly subduing the guards before\nturning and addressing the characters directly, by name. She tells them the following:\n“Go to the Council. Tell Mark that we need two eyes. Three. A thousand. The Ahl-\ni-Batin’s terrible angels are loosed; they won’t be satisfied by a few Awakened spirits.\nTeach them all to see with many eyes! I will see you again, but not in this body. Free\nyourselves. Free the Sleepers. Learn to see. Enigma will take you where dogma cannot.”\nThe video ends there. If you have time to rehearse and prepare, this whole\nsequence can be presented live before the witnessing characters by the storytelling\nteam. You could even create the actual video if you have the resources, so the\ncharacters can review or rewind parts of it for clarity. Such props add an excellent\ndimension to the realism of the chronicle, as well as relieve some of the pressure for the\nNarrators when it comes to remembering exactly what was said or done on the tape.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n115\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nTHE COUNCIL CONVENES\nIt doesn’t take long for any Traditional members in good standing to discover that\nthe New Horizon Council is meeting in the near future. Storytellers should feel free to\ncustomize the proposed meeting site to suit their chronicle. Perhaps the Council has even\nbeen planning to meet in the characters’ home city for some time, and the dreams and\nomens they have been experiencing only add to the dread that has been building so far.\nIn Session\nUnless they drop in very late at night or early in the morning, the cabals should\nhave about an hour to meet and greet other attendees before the Council sits in session.\nConsors will provide a list of the meeting’s agenda. A number of minor issues are on\nthe table, but the two that stand out are Herald Theora Hetirck’s report on the status\nof the Realm of Entropy and a petition from “a group of mages adhering to the\nprinciples of the so-called Rogue Council Manifesto.” Add any other issues you wish.\nAfter the Councilors announce their names and titles, they move on to\nbusiness. Except for the items detailed here, go through the agenda in any order you\nwish. Use Council protocol to determine how much input the characters have, but\nthey should definitely feel as though they have a voice and aren’t simply there as\nspectators, particularly if they are powerful and respected.\nWhile the Storyteller should allow discussion to flow naturally, three important\npoints must be covered before the meeting is disrupted by the arrival of the Technocracy:\nVoormas Ascendant\nHerald Theora Hetirck, once a servant of the mad archmage Voormas, delivers\na chilling pronouncement: Her former master has nearly assembled the tools\nnecessary to throw the Great Wheel itself off track, ending the Cycle of Death and\nRebirth forever. She knows that Voormas somehow engineered the thinning of the\nGauntlet between the living world and the Underworld, but even as his slave, she\nnever found out how. It’s only a matter of time before the mad archmage attacks. She\nalso knows that Voormas was prepared for the Avatar Storm, and cast certain spells\nto maintain an arcane tie to the Earth and prevent disembodiment. Those who\nattempt to challenge him are ripped apart by the Avatar Storm in seconds, leaving\nthe Traditions with few options if they hope to oppose him. Yet if they do not, it will\nnot be long before reality itself is threatened by his mad scheme.\nPORTRAYING THE COUNCIL\nThe Council is given a set period of time to discuss the day’s agenda, during\nwhich it might ask for comments from the floor. When the time has passed,\nunfinished items are moved to the next session and the floor is open to petitions\nand statements. For all floor remarks, a speakers’ list determines who can talk on\na first-come, first-serve basis. The only exceptions are granted to Heralds, who may\nquestion the Council for points of clarification. Group presentations must be\narranged with the Chancellor pro Tempore’s secretary ahead of time.\nNeedless to say, it is generally best that a number of Narrators be used\nto represent the different Council members, or at least the ones who will\nbe important for this particular meeting. Make sure these Narrators are\nwell briefed on their characters, what they know and what opinions they\nwill have about the topics being discussed.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n116\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nThe Rogue Seat\nThe second major item on the agenda is the Rogue Council Petition. Represen-\ntatives of this enigmatic body approach and produce the mystical Tenth Seat, to the\namazement of the assembled Councilors. After allowing the Councilors to confirm\nwith whatever magic they feel is necessary that the seat is genuine, the Rogue\nCouncil mages explain that the Seat was recovered during a recent operation in the\nMiddle East following a message from the Sphinx.\nIt seems clear enough to them — the Rogue Council has earned its seat.\nRevelation\nAt some point during the meeting, the truth about the Heir (or whatever prophecy\nis used) should come out, whether due to auspicious use of Time or Entropy magic,\nrecognition by one of the Councilors in attendance, a mysterious pronouncement by one\nof the Emissaries of the Rogue Council. Aside from the personal impact of this revelation,\nit has an important mystical consequence as well. The character(s) will be the ones to\nrediscover the ritual of Holy Union that allows a mage to weather the Avatar Storm,\nabsorb some of the Avatar Shards that compose the storm and guide them to enlighten-\nment. This ritual is extremely dangerous for all who attempt it, but it might be the only\nway to survive the impending disaster, much less achieve Ascension.\nATTACK!\nRevelations regarding the Heir, combined with news of Voormas’ scheme and\nthe appearance of the Tenth Seat finally destroy the assembly’s self-control. Mages\nburst into heated arguments, threaten each other and “step outside” for impromptu\ncertámen bouts. This outside disruption allows a Technocracy task force to deter-\nmine that the Council is in a state of “maximum tactical incoherence,” and it\nprepares to decapitate the leadership of the Traditions with one stroke. Strike teams\nteleport to positions immediately outside at each entrance, with Sleepers covering\nthe HIT Marks as they storm the chantry and take aim at the Councilors.\nAlthough wards prevent teleportation into and out of the location by either side, this\nis not to say that the Councilors or the characters haven’t prepared some contingency plans\nin advance. Mages scatter and try to force their way through the ranks of the Technocrats\nto reach pre-arranged fallback points, springing several prepared Effects on their attackers\nand otherwise demonstrating why they have earned the right to sit on the Council in the\nfirst place. This should be a quick and brutal struggle, forcing the characters to think fast\nand cast faster if they wish to escape. With some good teamwork and planning, however,\nit should be possible for them to escape — injured and frightened, perhaps, but alive.\nDECISIONS\nWhen the smoke clears, the characters and those Councilors who escaped (which\nshould be most if not all of them) convene an emergency session. Bickering is nowhere\nto be seen — the Technocracy assault proved that the Traditions can no longer assume\nthat the Technocracy will leave them alone as it has since the “end” of the Ascension\nWar. In fact, it can be assumed that the opposite is true, and the Pogrom will be reinstated\nwith renewed vigor as the Gauntlet crumbles and the Avatar Storm’s intensity increases.\nTherefore, the Traditions must unite in the face of these threats, escape destruction\nat the hands of the Technocracy, research Holy Union and find some way to confront\nVoormas and put his evil to an end. Mighty tasks, to be sure, but there are no other options\nleft. Due to their prominence and potential, the characters are given positions of special\nimportance to the Council. Some might even become Councilors themselves, if they\nhave sufficient Reputation and magical expertise to be worthy of the honor.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n117\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nTHE LAST WAR\nAt this point, the characters have been thrust into the center of a renewed Ascension\nWar. Months pass as the war’s players take their places and begin probing each other’s\ndefenses, seeking a weakness to exploit for ultimate victory. During this time, Storytellers\nshould encourage the players to take their characters through research and small, personal\nstories, so that the tremendous conflict to come seems mightier by contrast.\nRemember that successful Seekings — not to mention a great deal of mundane and\narcane research — will be necessary before characters are able discover the truths of Holy\nUnion, much less empower themselves with it. Give the characters plenty of time for this,\nbut don’t let them rest easily. Just finding the proper texts and tools necessary to master\nthis ritual can be the subject of several challenging sessions, and actually attempting it\nfor the first time should be a cause for great worry as well as celebration. Nevertheless,\neventually they will succeed, or the rest of the scenario is written in vain.\nTHE FLOOD OF SOULS\nAt Voormas’ direction, the Avatar Storm grinds inexorably into the Gauntlet.\nGlobally, Gauntlet ratings drop by one Trait per month. If a regional Gauntlet was\nalready rated at one Trait to begin with, a new Shallowing forms, but local Gauntlets\nrated at two or more before the event leave a last, fragile wall between worlds. For\nTradition mages, this is an unexpected boon; for the Technocracy, it’s a nightmare.\nTechnocrats battle new hauntings and possessions around the world. The Pogrom kicks\ninto high gear, as new recruits and funding are poured into seizing Nodes and Shallowings.\nWAR COUNCIL\nAt some point, the characters should gather mages to renew Tradition unity and\nshare the secret of Holy Union. Only they have the means to do so. Unless the characters\nstep up to help the Traditions, the Traditions will fall. The Technocracy and the Storm\nwill destroy them. The Traditions are scattered in the aftermath of the Council attack,\nbut provided a suitable location can be secured and the word can be spread of the meeting,\nthe characters will find many influential mages coming from around the world to attend.\nWhen they arrive, it’s up to the characters to find a political solution. There are\nmany ways to do this, from sincerity and honesty to subterfuge and backroom deals.\nUnless the characters do something truly atrocious, though, the mere fact that they\nhave uncovered Holy Union combined with their prophesied status should be\nenough to swing the majority of those present to their side.\nOnce some semblance of Tradition unity has been forged, the characters can\nbegin discussing the immediate problems. It soon becomes obvious that the Technoc-\nracy is less the prime threat, than the weakening of the Gauntlet. Rumors point to\narmies of Marauders, Nephandi or even stranger things massing at the edges of reality,\nwaiting to fight their way in. Indeed, in the face of such horrors, the Traditions must\nconsider the once-unthinkable: asking the Technocracy to help save the world.\nConvincing the Technocrats will be difficult, at the very least. The Union is in a\nconstant state of red alert, and it will view any attempt at contact by Tradition members\n— particularly such powerful and well-known Reality Deviants as the characters — with\ndeep suspicion, if not outright hostility. Storytellers should present the characters with\na number of difficult challenges, from locating the hidden base of a high-level Techno-\ncratic commander to researching an argument he might believe to defeating elaborate\nsecurity measures to gain access to the facility. (This condition doesn’t even cover the\nincredible roleplaying that will be required to convince the appropriate Technocrats that\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n118\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nthis is the best solution for both sides.) Ultimately, the characters have a compelling\nargument, but will that be enough for these old enemies to see the light?\nIf all goes well, the last vestiges of the Ascension War end… but Ascension itself\nwill require one final quest.\nWANDERING STARS\nIf the characters manage to avert total war, the Traditions and Technocracy\nbury their dead, repair their strongholds and guide the thousands of Storm-\nAwakened mages. A month after the end of the war, a tenth of humanity throws off\nSleep — and the numbers still rise. Nations either stand on the threshold of collapse\nor have fallen into desperate anarchy. Surviving Sleepers distrust the Awakened,\nand the Consensus grows weaker and less predictable on a daily basis.\nAfter much struggle and hard work, however, the Avatar Storm begins to wane.\nMages with Holy Union and Sleepers weaken it when they host Avatar shards. But\neven fairly inexperienced mages sense that this is only a brief respite at best. If\nsomething isn’t done about the great disturbance in the Underworld, and soon, the\nStorm will simply propagate endlessly until all is lost.\nTHE SPHINX\nAs the Avatar Storm loses strength, the last Rogue Council transmission\narrives. Each character receives it in the language and medium he favors. In all\nmanifestations, it bears the sign of the Sphinx. It says:\nThank you for your trust. Will you trust us one more time?\nWhen the characters finish reading, Dante, the Oracle of Correspondence, is there with\nthem all, even if it entails being many places at once. As an Oracle, it’s a part of his nature.\nTHE SHATTERED DARK\nAfter explaining what they know about the Avatar Storm and congratulating\nthe characters on putting out the last fires of the Ascension War (if that is the case),\nthe Rogue Council asks a final, terrible question: Will the mages go to oppose\nVoormas? They cannot compel the characters for the same reason they can’t simply\ndo it themselves: Direct intervention would destroy the value of free will. They can\nonly communicate and advise. If they do any more, humanity’s choices become\nmeaningless. Such is the nature of judgment.\nIf the characters refuse to oppose Voormas at this point, the rest is simple, if\nexceedingly horrifying. The ritual completed, reality unravels into an agonizing\neternal state of simultaneous life and anti-life, banishing all thought of Ascension\nforever. If the characters choose to go, though, they have time to say their final good-\nbyes, then a portal is opened into the Deep Umbra that will take them to the dark\nand entropic Realm of Castle Helekar.\nReality is falling apart, and they are heading right to the source.\nDOOM\nThis is the last battle for reality. The characters fight it as they wish, but each\nchoice they make has consequences. It should be without question the most difficult\nand terrifying battle they have ever faced, and the Storyteller should spare no effort\nto convey the grim nature of the realm, the howling hordes at Voormas’ command\nor the terrible fury of the mad archmage himself. Their victory is far from assured.\nIn fact, even armed with Holy Union and as many other powers and items as they can\ncarry, the characters should still feel as though the odds are against them.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n119\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nUnfortunately for the characters, Voormas isn’t alone in his madness. Before\nthe characters even reach the archmage, the Storyteller is pretty much free to put a\nhorde of any type of enemy imaginable in their path, favoring ones on the entropic\nend of the scale when possible. Hungry ghosts, corrupted mages, foul shapeshifters,\nwicked spirits, hideous aliens, even fierce Hobgoblins created from Voormas’ own\nextended Quiet all assail the characters, requiring a great deal of their power and\ncourage to overcome before they can face the master at the heart of this evil place.\nVoormas himself isn’t subtle. The archmage musters as much magic as he can\nspare to kill or repulse the characters as soon as he notices their presence. Naturally,\nEntropy is his most common Sphere of attack, though Mind and Matter are close,\nespecially if he is trying to keep his foes off guard. If he senses a weakness, he destroys\na character in as horrific a manner as he can fashion, all the while claiming that his\ncause is just. He wants nothing more than to create a world where humanity isn’t\nchained to karma or death — a vision of Ascension.\nIf the characters fail, events play out as described previously. If they succeed,\nthey have achieved the greatest victory of all time.\nASCENSION\nThese are the final moments of the universe.\nAll the barriers are broken; the Outer and Inner Horizon dissolve before the\nracing fragments of the One, questing for human hosts. This is the last tide of\nAwakening. At last, on the broken Earth, everyone is a miracle-worker.\nThe Awakened create wonders and destroy monuments. Cities are raised from\nthe dust, then sundered in the birth pangs of power remembered, but everyone was\nAsleep once. Most people remember the humility and compassion of mortal days.\nThe last miracles are not born of fire and water. Progenitors heal shamans who bear\nwounds from their common war with Marauders. Little gods repair Enlightened\nmachines. At night, a red glow lights the world: the purifying fire of Telos’ Red Star.\nOthers find their Unity, their Akasha, their True Ether, their uncorrupted\ntongue of Enoch, all integral links in the chain of reality. The Enetelechy conquers\nthe last barriers of magic and Paradox. Joyously, they move back through time, and\ncreate themselves. Thothmes, Bhât, the Himalayan War, MECHA, Concordia —\nall are part of the thread that is cast back through the ages to pull history again, to\nthe moment of Ascension.\nThere is always the One, but diversity — the Cycle and the Other — is never\nexcluded. There are uncountable paradigms, but they don’t chain belief or power.\nIn the end, they are games.\nTHE REVOLUTION\nWILL BE TELEVISED\nAt the end of the 20th century — as one millennium ended and another began —\na cosmic event called the Avatar Storm swept across the boundaries of Creation. For\nvisionaries who challenged the very limits of reality, other dimensions beyond human\nperception had once offered limitless adventure. Surrounding the Earth, a mathemati-\ncally impossible boundary separated the precise and ordered world of conventional\nreality from all its alternatives. The boundary still exists, but it is growing weaker.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n120\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nAlthough this phenomenon is known by many names, it is most commonly referred\nto as the “Gauntlet”— since those who pass through it, whether through shamanic rites\nor advanced technology, are invariably punished. Void Engineers sometimes call it a\n“Dimensional Barrier,” even though they cannot quantify exactly how it functions.\nShould this barrier fall completely, the threshold that separates the relatively safe world\nof Earth from myriad alien alternatives would be eradicated. Science would hold no\nmeaning; sanity would be irrelevant without a common frame of reference; forces beyond\nspace and time could descend upon the helpless populace of Earth in one rapacious feast.\nThis scenario details a brutal covert struggle in the Technocratic ranks\nbetween two emerging factions: the Loyalists, who seek total control over the\nworld through the annihilation of all magic save their own technomancy, and the\nUnionists, who seek to guide humanity to greatness through Enlightened Science,\nexperimentation and exploration.\nPHASE ONE\nAt the start of Phase One, a dedicated team of Void Engineers issues a warning to\nany amalgam that will listen: Patrols have detected an increase in supernatural\nphenomena. Extradimensional entities — or “spirits,” as some would call them — have\nbroken through the Dimensional Barrier. Such entities occasionally manifest in our\nworld, but these new sightings do not correspond to previously encountered phenomena.\nIn game terms, most of these locations are areas where the Gauntlet rating is low.\nA few sites, however, do not fit this pattern. Instead, they are moderately or highly\npopulated areas. It is as though the spirits are searching for something… or someone.\nTeams then scramble to figure out what they’re looking for, but not before innocent\nSleepers begin to disappear, and innocent witnesses see things they couldn’t possibly\nimagine. This phase should focus on the emerging mysteries of the Avatar Storm, while\nsowing the seeds for the schism between fanatical Loyalists and visionary Unionists.\nAnomalies: An increase in sightings of paranormal phenomena quickly leads to\nactive investigations. Tracking down “extradimensional incursions” becomes the\nmost common mission for collaborative amalgams. Talented teams of agents\n(including your characters) should have the authority to conduct one of these\ninvestigations on their own.\nNew Propaganda: On the Horizon, a group of academics within the Ivory Tower\nsoon posits a new theory that this Dimensional Barrier was strengthened by the Order\nof Reason. Propaganda insists that the Technocracy has abandoned the original ideals\nof the Order, which has led to the current course of events. Furthermore, revised\nhistory insists that the Order was established to protect the Masses from supernatural\nforces, including extradimensional activity and sudden “primal storms.” Radical\nintellectuals try to broadcast this propaganda to the front lines, with mixed results.\nLockdowns: In response to the deadliest and most frightening incursions, teams\nof Void Engineer Dimensional Scientists mobilize to areas where the barrier between\nworlds has given way, accompanied by marines from this Convention. In teams of\nfive or 10 agents, they’re sent through these rifts to patrol for further incursions.\nCasualties are high as the Avatar Storm responds. Most teams are left with one or\ntwo agents who aren’t seriously wounded.\nPHASE TWO\nAt some point in this section or even near the end of Phase One, Control ceases\nall transmissions. This in itself is not remarkable, since messages from this cryptic\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n121\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nsource are normally infrequent. Concurrently, agents should encounter even more\nof the phenomena mentioned earlier in this scenario: disappearances, abductions,\nsightings of new and unidentified phenomena and so forth. Independent supervisors\nrespond by forming their own battle plans… until the Horizon Constructs interrupt\nwith their own detailed and frequent directives.\nThis phase should further probe the loyalties of the different operatives and\namalgams. If it wasn’t obvious before that a power struggle is taking place in the\nhigher levels of the hierarchy, it should be now, though not necessarily who is\ninvolved and why. As they struggle to cope with increasingly dangerous and\nunpredictable anomalies, agents must begin to watch what they say and do. Control\nis always watching, but who is watching Control?\nA Shift in Power: Eventually, Masters and Managers on the Horizon resume\nbroadcasts as if the Avatar Storm never happened. Agents in any amalgam will suddenly\nfind themselves reporting to higher authorities. If they were performing missions for an\nIvory Tower Supervisor, they soon receive broadcasts from a Manager one rank higher.\nProgenitors sequestered in laboratories might suddenly lose their funding and be sent to\nsupport amalgams in distant cities. Cyborgs receive downloads from sources with which\nthey were previously unfamiliar, and Syndicate reps must contend with a “corporate\nreorg,” forcing them to give detailed reports to managers they have never heard of.\nHorizon immediately asserts its authority… and disgruntled front-line agents do their\nbest to hide any signs of dissatisfaction. The chain of command is re-forged.\nTracking the Anakim: A few of the more unusual dossiers concern theories of an\nalien invasion. A standard background dossier relates publicly known rumors regard-\ning alien abductions, events in Roswell and legendary Men in Black questioning\nwitnesses of such events. Citizens interrogated after various lockdowns have related a\nvast amount of barely credible evidence of what they have encountered. Investigations\ninto this latest “invasion,” on the other hand, can be traced to testimony given by Men\nin Black. A disturbing picture begins to emerge during this stage: It is possible that the\nAvatar Storm is not merely a dimensional phenomena, but that it has begun to\nsomehow empower individuals into Awakening — often with devastating results.\nNew Cults, New Gods: As rifts open in the Dimensional Barrier, extra-\ndimensional forces reach out for weak minds on Earth. Some gather humans with\nmagical potential, bringing them together through dreams and visions to remote and\nunwatched corners of the Earth. Avatar shards awaken such initiates, and revela-\ntions from outside reality guide them to perform rites of summoning. Marauders,\nNephandi or even demons act as the shadowy leaders of these cults. Whatever the\nmotivation is, they are united in perverting these rifts in the Gauntlet. It should not\nbe difficult to spare a few amalgams to seek out one of these new cults and investigate.\nThe Schism Widens: Faced with many failed missions during this stage, mid-\nlevel agents begin to disregard broad and draconian policies sent from the Horizon.\nRank-Three Technocrats — such as Progenitor Research Associates, It-X Pro-\ngrammers, Ivory Tower Intelligence Analysts, Syndicate Chairmen and Void\nEngineer Commanders — continue to direct agents in the field, but they fail to\nreport everything they find to their superiors. As a result, Horizon Managers file\nreports of insubordination against independent Managers… but they cannot send\ntroops down from Horizon to capture and retrieve them for psychological evalu-\nation and social conditioning. It is a stalemate, at least until something happens\nto knock a few pieces off the chessboard.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n122\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nPHASE THREE\n“Forces from outside our world have infiltrated our reality.” That much\nshould be apparent to characters by now as the Anakim and the plans of the\nPsychopomps become ever clearer. Of course, whether these entities will destroy\nreality or repair it depends increasingly on the loyalties of individual agents. The\nLoyalists who have assumed control in the Horizon Constructs see it as no less than\na terminal event and seek to clamp down hard on reality in response, but more\nopen-minded Unionists are slower to judge this new phenomenon. They seek\nfurther understanding of it before acting.\nOn the front lines, agents communicating with their contemporaries begin to refer\nto these manifestations as “shards” or “quantum shards.” Independent Technocrats —\nas well as deviant technomancers, Etherites and Virtual Adepts — need a common term\nfor them as well. They make analogies to “dark matter.” Reality Deviants would go so far\nas to call them “Avatar shards,” but that description implies a spiritual, soulful or even\nintelligent component to this activity. Further analysis is required.\nPogrom Restored: Early analysis confirms that “quantum shards,” like the\nextradimensional entities that arrived before them, seek out individuals with\nparanormal or psychic potential. Recent statistical analysis (including high-pow-\nered procedures attempted on the Horizon) suggests that some of these “contactees”\nhave the potential to become Technocrats themselves… or deviant mages. Loyalists\nissue orders that those contacted by the shards or exposed to dark matter are to be\ncontained and examined.\nDark Matter: Unionists begin to witness firsthand what this newly discovered\ndark matter can do to unprepared victims. As these initiates attempt to understand\ntheir deviant abilities, the number of Paradox Backlashes in the world increases. In\nsevere cases, shards seek out victims of Paradox and punish them with the same\nvirulence as the Avatar Storm — by now referred to as “Dimensional Storms” within\nthe Union. Even the subtle workings of Technocratic operatives become vulnerable\nto these unpredictable surges, leading to the destruction of many incautious agents.\nRace Against Time: Independent amalgams are pursuing methods of containing\ndark matter. They can do so only by innovating new applications of Enlightened\nScience and contravening established procedures. To survive this new manifesta-\ntion of the Dimensional Storm, they must find a way to isolate, contain and protect\nthemselves before Loyalist Technocrats discover their activities. If an amalgam can\nfigure out how to survive an encounter with Avatar Shards, or even manipulate\nthem, it will have a significant edge later in this timeline.\nPHASE FOUR\nAs Avatar Shards have worn away the Gauntlet, these razors of primal energy\nhave torn rifts in the barrier between worlds, allowing spirits to manifest in the\nphysical world. Therefore, mages (and Technocrats) trapped beyond the Horizon\nthat have become disembodied can also find new ways back into the physical world.\nMuch of Phase Four deals with the consequences of this change, as the realms of spirit\nand matter come ever closer together. Containing the shifts in reality caused by this\nphenomenon can easily be the focus of several sessions as the characters hunt down\ntroublesome embodied entities and repair breaches in the dimensional fabric.\nFrom a political perspective, this new revelation allows Loyalists to send\nreinforcements from the Horizon to enforce their ideals. The “cold war” between the\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n123\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nLoyalists and the Unionists erupts in actual violence for the first time, with sneak\nattacks and lightning raids on both sides. While overt conflict is still some time off,\nthe characters might find themselves forced to choose sides soon — or face\nincreasingly dire consequences.\nSecuring Reality: Forces on the Horizon do not traffic in mysticism and archaic\nphilosophies. High-level Managers on the Horizon choose the Technocracy’s one\nprimary objective during Phase Four: securing the Earth. For all the various theories\nof dark matter and quantum shards, it is clear that overt acts of magic, like blatant\nacts of Enlightened Science, endanger not only the people who practice them, but\ninnocents around them as well. The Loyalists’ final Time Table is then unified in one\npurpose: creating a world where only subtle acts of Enlightened Science work. If\ninnocent lives must be lost in this campaign, so be it — all of reality is at stake.\nReinforcements Arrive: Aligned in purpose, Horizon Constructs send troops\ndown to the front lines in one final push for the War for Reality. Rogue agents —\nalmost certainly including at least a few of the more openly Unionist characters —\nare targeted for assassination or even outright hunted by Loyalist forces. Reality\nDeviants are eliminated. Hidden chantries and headquarters for rogue cells are\ndestroyed after their locations are confirmed by surveillance and interrogation.\nStrengthened by reinforcements, Loyalist forces begin hunting “deviants” and\n“traitors” in their own organization, readying for their endgame.\nPHASE FIVE\nA sudden, massive assault from the Loyalists on deviants and Unionist strong-\nholds rapidly alters the landscape of reality. Surprise attacks lead to massive\ncasualties, as chantries and safe houses alike are compromised. Horizon has been\nwaiting and watching, preparing for a final push in a renewed Ascension War.\nFrightened by the increasingly frequent attacks from extradimensional beings, an\nincreasing number of Sleepers have also begun to fall in with the Loyalists, with\neverything from disorganized mobs to disciplined military forces attacking select\nsupernatural targets around the world. If enough major victories are scored, the War\nfor Reality may soon be over.\nOne amalgam could easily pursue a series of missions against this background of\nshifting realities. If the characters have been willing to defend the common populace\nagainst the Loyalists, the wave of attacks at the end of Phase Four has probably\nhammered their morale. Such devotion can then be rewarded by moral support from\nbeyond the Horizon when the chronicle is at its darkest moment. One transmission\nfrom Control, through as simple an apparatus as a radio, telephone or television set,\nwould confirm that they are not alone in the revolution. In fact, Control could offer\nthem direction just as it seems the conflict with the Loyalists is drawing to a close.\nTransmissions from Control: Control resumes its transmissions at the start of\nPhase Five. It seeks out scattered survivors of the Loyalists’ massive attack, attempt-\ning to unify them in the defense of humanity. The goal is not to isolate a\nself-sufficient Technocracy in a new Ivory Tower on the Horizon. The goal is a far\nolder one: to make humans masters of their own world. The society they started has\nbecome corrupt. Unable to control the Masters who have taken their place, they will\nassist the revolution to destroy the Technocracy’s Loyalist overlords.\nAfter extensive discussions in briefing rooms and rogue Technocrat bunkers, two\nsolutions emerge. The first is to find a way to grant immunity to the hazardous effects of\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n124\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nthe Avatar Storm. The second is to “open the floodgates,” using Dimensional Science to\ntear open rifts in the Gauntlet at key locations. Doing so would be catastrophic in those\nkey areas, but it would theoretically keep the shards from continuing to wear down the\nDimensional Barrier. If Avatar shards can now silence (or slaughter) mages, they may\ntheoretically purge (or destroy) all magic in the areas where they are channeled.\nPogrom Restored: At this stage, the Pogrom against Tradition mages resumes, but\nTechnocracy agents aren’t the only ones who are hunting them. Fearful of the existence\nof the supernatural, local authorities and government agencies should also act against\nTradition mages. Mages are mortal, after all, so mundane authorities can alter their lives\nwithout having to alter reality. As mankind scores victories against magical forces,\nConsensus should shift against overt and archaic applications of magic. Occasionally,\nTechnocracy agents also hunt particularly dangerous mages during this time, but\ngenerally speaking, it can focus on greater threats… including rival Technocrats.\nThe Storm-Enhanced: Avatar Shards have bestowed great power to Sleepers who\nwere destined to become mages… and possibly even destined to play a role in\nArmageddon. Some survivors have been recruited (or hunted and abducted), but many\nof these initiates — the last generation of mages — will eventually destroy themselves\ntrying to marshal forces they cannot understand. Without Technocracy indoctrination\nor Tradition training, they have the power to summon up forces they cannot put down.\nAt the end of Phase Five, Control broadcasts a warning about the critical mass\nof Avatar shards building around the world. Unless its energy is channeled, the wave\nof extradimensional forces will build until it washes over the Earth, obliterating the\nDimensional Barrier. Whether this event will heal the world or destroy it is a matter\nof great debate. As a result, Unionists and Loyalists race for solutions to this\nproblem… each acting for their own advantage.\nPHASE SIX: ENDGAME\nOn the final day of this timeline, one final wave of reinforcements breaks\nthrough the Horizon: the first real tempest of Avatar shards in the physical world.\nIn the location where this final invasion takes place, the result is an Avatar Storm\nso virulent that it purges its Awakened (or Enlightened) victims of their Arete. (In\ngame terms, it first inflicts aggravated damage as though the victim had passed\nthrough the Gauntlet, then triggers a Paradox Backlash, and then erases the victim’s\nArete.) It doesn’t remove all magic from the world, but it cripples its victims\nsufficiently to end this conflict.\nWith the Technocracy rapidly fragmenting, Loyalists and Unionists contest to\nbe the first to invoke this “final solution” before someone else beats them to the\npunch. If one faction can find a way to survive this storm, or direct it against its\nenemies first, it could act as a “doomsday weapon” in the War for Reality. The world\nis now a chessboard with two opponents — the Unionists and Loyalists — and the\nfirst one to achieve checkmate can finally “control” reality unopposed.\nLaunching the Revolution: At the start of Phase Six, a scientist (or supervisor)\nwho has found a way to exploit the Avatar Storm contacts the characters. He gives\nthem the knowledge they need to open the gates, close the gates or shield\nEnlightened agents from the Avatar Storm. With this head start, the characters must\nchoose what to do with this deadly knowledge. If they’ve been given orders and can\npull off their objective before their enemies do, they will tip the balance in this\nendgame. For added drama, they might be informed that the other side is also racing\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n125\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nto open the floodgates and will be ready to unleash its final solution at a specific time.\nIf the heroes do not act quickly, their enemies will.\nOnce they have been moved to action, the most important move in this\nendgame is the location of the first gateway that floods the Avatar shards into the\nrealm of flesh. Phase Six is a race against time. Four major outcomes are possible:\nLoyalty Triumphs: If the Loyalists “win,” all alternatives to their vision for reality are\nweakened on Earth. The dominant variant of “magic” left is technomancy — coinciden-\ntal applications of technological magic, as developed on the Horizon. Any act of magic\nthat appears openly supernatural summons further Avatar shards. Since the Loyalists\ncontrol the only functional variant of “magic” on Earth, they reassert their control as the\nsecret masters of the world. This could lead to a denouement in which we see what the\nworld is like in a few years… in a dystopia under one absolute Technocracy.\nHumanity United: If the Unionists open their gates first, the Horizon Constructs\nare purged. A chain reaction weakens the network, as the front-line agents free\nthemselves from the oversight of their Masters. Unable to cope with the fact that an\noverwhelming supernatural act is occurring, loyalist Technocrats go insane or into\nQuiet, or they simply expire in a final Paradox Backlash. The storm then cuts off\nsources of Quintessence in the world, extinguishing the energy needed to sustain a\nnetwork of Horizon Constructs. Magic weakens, but the Unionists survive.\nSurvival: In theory, if the technomancers can devise a defense against Avatar\nshards — perhaps by watching and learning from the Anakim, adapting Dimensional\nScience, or even following a procedure detailed by Control — they can survive this\nfinal wave of the Avatar Storm, perhaps even rebuild a new Order of Reason. While\nthis “last mage standing” ending is rather brutal, it might be the only hope if the\nLoyalists have made more overt forms of resistance impossible.\nEverybody Dies: If no one “wins,” and neither side opens a gate to channel this\nworldwide energy, the Dimensional Barrier eventually falls on its own. The resulting\nstorm actually flays all souls in its path, and every mage and Technocrat on Earth is purged\nas the spirit world floods into the physical world. The only Enlightened survivors are then\nthe colonies and a handful of mages and Technocrats on Seekings. Perhaps the characters\nescape on a Void Engineer starship toward a resolution in another realm. They could\nappear before representatives of Control, escape to a Technocracy colony or attempt a\nfinal Seeking on the Far Horizon… one that leads to Ascension or utter annihilation.\nDENOUEMENT\nThe Earth could be reclaimed by the defenders of old ideals; it could be transformed\nin a dystopia ruled by the Loyalists; it could even be purged of all magic, becoming a realm\nwhere even technomancy ceases to function. You must decide which outcome best suits\nyour chronicle… and which side the characters are on when the revolution ends.\nUnfolding this story, act by act, is like broadcasting the final season of a\ntelevision program, one that’s been running for years. Humanity will be watching,\nof course, even if the Masses don’t understand the real significance of what is\noccurring. In a final surrender to technology, the most hopeless citizens will observe\nthese historical events with passive acceptance. Experts enlisted by mass media will\nrationalize what they cannot understand. The revolution will be televised — but\neven during Armageddon, only the Enlightened will see the truth behind the\napocalyptic events.\nThis is the Technocracy, signing off.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n126\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nA WHIMPER, NOT A BANG\nWhat if the end of the world came and nobody noticed? In the World of\nDarkness, it isn’t unusual for players and Storytellers to consider that even the most\nheinous acts occur without the common man on the street taking notice.\nIn this scenario, the population of Earth is losing Avatars one by one. Two\ncompeting alien factions are capturing mages and stripping away their Avatars, each\nfaction doing so for its own reasons. These secret thefts of humanity’s spiritual shards\nof Prime have been going on for some time, but now they are happening with\nunprecedented frequency and purpose. The very fabric of magic in the universe is\nbeing unraveled one thread at a time, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that\nit is being spun onto a new spindle held elsewhere.\nOf course this is occurring beyond the public eye, except perhaps in media\nvenues traditionally perceived as fraudulent or absurd. The end of the magical world\napproaches steadily and quietly. This is a very bleak scenario in many ways, and\nStorytellers should consider its implications before running it with their troupe.\nWhile succeeding only to still fail (at least in part) is a very dramatic theme, it might\nnot be suited for all chronicles or all players.\nTHEY ARE HERE\nTwo obscure groups of radicals have turned up evidence of something bigger\nthan anything paranoid intelligence officers or quixotic UFO nuts ever imagined.\nUnfortunately, the two factions distrust each other, and neither is likely to ever\nsolve the puzzle without certain pieces held by their rivals. Blinded by an\nunbending scientific viewpoint, they would be unlikely to see the truth even if\nthey were to work together.\nTHE STAR COUNCIL\nThe first of these two organizations is the Star Council, a gathering of eccentric\nintellectuals who share beliefs and studies of UFOs. Numbering less than 50, the Star\nCouncil would likely have faded away when the ’60s ended, had it not made a\nremarkable discovery. Following the trail of reported sightings and cracked govern-\nment files, a handful of members of the Council managed to break into a restricted\nhangar in Area 51 in 1969. They made off with ultratech devices of both Techno-\ncratic and alien origin and have been studying them ever since. The pillaging of the\nfamed Technocratic Node has earned the group the unwanted attention of the\nUnion, and only inherent paranoia, unconventional tactics and occasional amazing\nbreakthroughs with the stolen devices have kept the members from capture.\nNO SORCERERS\nThe Star Council and the Thal’hun are sorcerers — also called linear\nmages or hedge mages by various supplements for the World of Darkness. Laws\nof the Hunt contains rules for sorcerers as well as information on the Star\nCouncil. More detailed information on the subject as well as a profile of the\nThal’hun can be found in World of Darkness: Sorcerer. If you do not desire\nto use sorcerers, you can easily present the two groups as independent, but\nsimilar, to the Sons of Ether or Virtual Adepts. Just substitute foci related to\ntheir UFO/alien-studies paradigm and plan their use of rotes accordingly.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n127\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nTHAL’HUN\nThe Thal’hun is a fringe group that joined the Council in the early ’60s and led\nmany of those who believed in them into destruction. The Thal’hun believe that an\nancient race of aliens advanced so greatly in science that they were like unto gods,\nbut their world was destroyed in a terrible plague. This race, which they call Hui:xa,\nsupposedly spread across the universe, hoping to discover those with whom it could\nshare its enlightened science and rebuild its greatest city once again.\nAccording to the Thal’hun, the science of the Hui:xa transcended the physical\nand could be transmitted through the sounds of their special linguistics. They claimed\nto be in contact with the entity Khuvon, who descended to the Earth somewhere in\nMesopotamia thousands of years ago and has made itself responsible for “safeguarding”\nthe essences of divine god-beings in transition between planes. All of this might seem\nquite preposterous were it not for the fact that the Thal’hun can indeed muster their\nown sorcerous effects, not to mention the fact that the expedition they convinced the\nStar Council to send to the Middle East was destroyed by unknown forces.\nEARLY WARNING\nThe first true signs that something is wrong begin to manifest early on in this scenario.\nMagic becomes more difficult and the players likely have little or no idea why — yet. Plant\nsome mysterious seeds of what is happening in the news and rumors they hear from fellow\nTradition members. A rash of strange abductions, whispers of strange beings from beyond\nthe Gauntlet and other “alien” phenomena begin cropping up more and more often. A\nfriend of one cabal might be one of the ones to disappear, or a close ally hear rumors of a\nstrange cult bent on “harvesting” willworkers and others with strong Avatars.\nWork the names of the Star Council and the Thal’hun in gradually and from\na number of sources, letting the players put together the pieces. Try to give as many\nof the cabals a common cause to investigate as possible before moving on, without\nbeing too obvious about drawing them all in. Once the characters are interested,\nenough leads pile up to lead them to the local headquarters of the various groups, as\noutlined in the next phase of this scenario.\nOUT THERE\nThis stage does not follow a linear timeline, but rather is left open for the players\nto investigate as they see fit. Indeed, it’s likely that one cabal might consider it a priority\nMAGIC ALTERATION\nAs this scenario goes forward, the pattern of the Tapestry tightens, its\nmystical weaving becomes a bit threadbare, and magic becomes noticeably harder\nto perform. For each stage of this scenario, add one to the difficulty of all tests to\nperform magic. For stages three through five, subtract one extra Grade of Success\nper casting, and reduce the ratings of all supernatural Nodes, Backgrounds, Merits\nand Flaws by one Trait. (If reduced to zero, the Trait vanishes utterly.) The\nGauntlet strengthens as well, becoming essentially impassable by the end of the\nscenario. All of these effects are cumulative. In addition, the Storyteller may also\ninclude other complications such as cameras and other devices counting as\n“witnesses” for the purposes of vulgar magic, require additional Quintessence\nTraits to activate Wonders and so on. It should be serious enough that the\ncharacters can tell something must be done, lest magic be lost forever.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n128\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nto investigate the Star Council, while another two track down the Thal’hun and yet\nanother investigates what the Hermetics know about the Zigg and the Ka Luon. As\nlong as the Storyteller takes care to weave all of these different elements back into one\nstory that the whole troupe can participate in, this period of investigation and\nquestioning can take as long and go in as many directions as the Storyteller desires.\nTHE STAR COUNCIL\nScarred by interactions with the Thal’hun and various Technocratic and\ngovernment agencies, the Star Council has gone underground. As such, the\ncharacters will have some difficulty locating any members of the brotherhood. In\nthe end, mages worthy of the title are likely to discover the information they seek\nsomehow. Unless the Storyteller prefers some other locale, the group probably\nfinds one of the warehouses wherein the Star Council has stashed one or more of\nits alien artifacts for study, along with several members of the Star Council\nassigned to study the various items.\nIf the characters approach peacefully and appear interested in the missing\nUFOlogists, the Council members are friendly, and convincing them to allow the\ncharacters to examine it is relatively simple. The Council has determined that the\nflat metal object, scored with silvery markings, might be some sort of computing\ndevice, but they cannot discern what it is designed to do. Appropriate Effects could\ndiscover that the device is a control panel for an alien craft, and that it serves as a\nspecial guidance system. Correspondence or Spirit Effects might further show that the\ndevice could control a vessel with extradimensional capabilities. Impressed by such\nacumen, the Council members might be convinced to allow the characters to take\nthe device, though possibly at the cost of having the impressionable cultists follow\nthem around trying to “help out.”\nIf confronted with violence or abuse, the Council members attempt to flee; if\ncornered, they are surprisingly resourceful. Characters attempting to take the item\nby force should most likely easily handle the amateurish cultists, but they might well\nlose a valuable source of information later on down the line — not to mention incur\nthe wrath of the other Council members at an inopportune time.\nTHE THAL’HUN\nFinding the Thal’hun offices requires similar magic or Background use as\ndiscovering the Star Council did. The difference is that the Thal’hun are no longer\nin residence. Mundane investigations reveal that the cult’s lease expired five months\nago and that the leasing party did not leave a forwarding address. Depending on\nwhich Spheres or other means are employed, additional information can be obtained\nvia magical means. The Thal’hun leadership finally managed to contact its spiritual\nicon Khuvon and embarked upon a new mission to meet its goals. The inner circle\nand its followers have taken to calling themselves the Disciples of Zoraster, after the\ninvisible city of light that is reputed to be the goal of their spiritual master. Extremely\nclever and successful magical investigations might even discover that the Thal’hun\nDisciples have taken to fomenting smaller splinter cults that specialize in tracking\nand kidnapping obscure figures of the occult — and mages.\nStorytellers are encouraged to leave just enough evidence behind at the homes\nand offices of the Thal’hun members to give the characters the impression that these\ncultists have recently graduated to much bigger and more serious activities than they\nwere previously familiar with. Don’t give away too much of their plan yet, though.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n129\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nHERMES TO THE RESCUE\nCharacters seeking information about aliens such as the Zigg’raugglurr or the Ka Luon\nfind themselves directed to a nearby scholar from the Order of Hermes, who is a known\nauthority on the subject of spirits and extraterrestrials. Provided the characters are polite\n(perhaps performing a few minor tasks for the busy scholar) and willing to describe the facts\nas they know them so far, she is only too happy to tell them what she knows.\nThe Zigg’raugglurr\nThe first recorded sighting of the Zigg’raugglurr entities was claimed by represen-\ntatives of the Order of Hermes in San Francisco. Hermetic scholars describe them as\nappearing as yellow floating blobs covered with reptilian scales and pulsating veins,\nsporadically changing size from a few inches to a few yards across. Their fairly unwieldy\nname, Zigg’raugglurr, was assigned by Hermetic mages who recorded the first attempt\nto communicate with these beings. (Mages less worried about formality often just call\nthem“Zigg.”) Repeat encounters with the same Zigg proved remarkably easier to resist,\nwith mounting evidence suggesting that specimens actually possessed more knowledge\nof our world in early meetings and less later. They appear intent on capturing mages\nrather than killing them, but what they do with such captives is unknown.\nThe Zigg’raugglurr inhabit an alternate dimension, and they interact with reality in\nbizarre fashion. The alien Zigg may enter the time-stream, step out of it and return at some\nother point. Similarly, they can enter the physical world, depart and return. Alternatively,\nthey can manipulate the portions of their bodies entering three-dimensional space,\nseemingly changing shape or size. The Zigg do not seem to possess Avatars, and thus do not\nperform dynamic magic, yet their extradimensional natures and alien technology allow\nthem to perform miraculous feats that can draw the wrath of Paradox spirits. Indeed Paradox\nspirits, when they do appear, seem particularly vicious and antagonistic toward the Zigg,\nprobably because the outsiders are completely alien to reality.\nKa Luon\nThe“Grays.” Modern pop culture and UFO nuts around the world have embraced\nthe vision of an alien species that has plagued humanity in secret for, at very least, the\npast five or six decades. Nevertheless, more questions arise with each answer that seems\napparent. These beings have been observed abducting and experimenting upon\nhumans, and at times have come into direct conflict with Umbral explorers and the\nTechnocratic Void Engineers. At other times, however, they have been friendly and\neven conciliatory to those they encounter. Likewise, in the history of their contact the\nKa Luon have appeared to be an actual alien race, a form of spirit entity and even\nsomething completely unidentifiable. They apparently possess highly sophisticated\ntechnology, yet some encounters have seen no sign of such devices. Lastly, they appear\nto be hostile toward the Zigg, but for reasons no one has been able to fathom.\nDEATH FROM ABOVE\nAt this point, the characters should be developing a picture of what is going on, and\nat least some of them are on the trail of the Thal’hun (maybe even preparing for the Zigg).\nIt’s clear that the kidnappings are merely indicative of a largely plot at work, and the more\nthey learn about it, the more horrifying it becomes. It seems that these forces are not just\ncapturing mages, but intend to do something terrible with their very Avatars!\nIf this isn’t enough to move the characters to action, a pair of unexpected\nattacks during this section should alert them to the urgency of the threat with which\nthey have become involved.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n130\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nZIGGS INCOMING!\nIf the mages have not yet faced a Zigg attack, then you should consider having a lone\nalien or pair of aliens seek to capture and abduct some of the Avatar-bearing specimens\nit spotted in contact with witnesses previously. The timing for this particular event is best\nleft to you, but it should occur preferably at some point when it is late and lonely, or when\na cabal is investigating a depressed and broken area of the city or its surroundings.\nStorytellers are encouraged to devise their own statistics for the Zigg, both to\nscale them to the level of the characters involved as well as to represent how bizarre\nand unpredictable these creatures are. They should be challenging but not impos-\nsible, and since they are more concerned with capturing than killing it should not\nbe a fatal encounter. Given their mastery of time and space (at least as far as their\nindividual bodies), it should be impossible for the troupe to capture one of the Zigg,\nat least at this time. Rather, make it clear that the Zigg are aware of the characters\nand out to capture them if possible, then have them vanish.\nTHE THAL’HUN ATTACK\nThe Thal’hun on the other hand, are turned onto the characters by a snitch who\nobserves some of the mages snooping around the abandoned Thal’hun offices. If this\nnever happens, then perhaps the snitch instead spots a cabal visiting the Star\nCouncil warehouse. Whatever path proves to be the primary link to the cabals, the\nThal’hun mean business, and they send out at least one party after the characters,\nattempting to capture as many as possible.\nShould the Disciples of Zoraster succeed in capturing any of the characters, they\nindividually subject each of them to a ritual hoping to give Khuvon a chance to turn\nthem to its needs. Khuvon will eventually strip the Avatar from the mage’s being and\nentrap it within the hidden realm of Zoraster, although chances are good that the\ncharacter is rescued long before this can succeed. Still, it is a chilling glimpse of what\nthe cult’s true intentions are. If the characters defeat the Thal’hun, they discover\nvarious documents and the like that suggest that the Disciples of Zoraster are busy\nplanning to “liberate” a lost starship supposedly capable of reaching Zoraster,\ncurrently being held in Area 51 of the Nellis Air Force Base north of Las Vegas. The\nlevel of detail is up to the Storyteller, but it should be sufficient to point the\ncharacters toward the base, at least if they need such a ride to reach Zoraster. Perhaps\nmore important to the themes of this story, the troupe should find suitable evidence\nthat the Thal’hun have abducted dozens of mages for unknown purposes.\nKEY TO THE CITY\nIt should become apparent by now that both the Zigg and the Thal’hun are\noperating from locations outside of this reality, which means the characters will have\nto find some way to reach one of their bases if they want to inflict lasting harm. Since\neven the most learned Hermetics don’t know anything about where the Zigg originate\nfrom, that means the Thal’hun and their mystical city of Zoraster will have to do, at\nleast for starters. If the characters have their own means of traveling to the Horizon\nRealm where Zoraster is located, that is one option. Otherwise, their research can have\nturned up that the government has a captured Thal’hun ship under guard in Nellis Air\nForce Base — the very one the Star Council artifact came from, in fact.\nCharacters attempting to sneak into the military base will have a tough time of\nit, but with good planning, tight teamwork and a little judicious magic, they should\neventually be able to do so. Once inside the base, their search will turn up a heavily\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n131\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nguarded alien vessel. The vessel’s guidance system has been stripped from it, but if\nall has gone well, this panel will happen to be the one the troupe gained from the Star\nCouncil earlier in the story. A Mental Challenge (retest Technology) against a\ndifficulty of nine Traits will allow someone to install the panel. Alternatively, a\nquick rote or two involving Forces or Matter, potentially paired with Correspondence\nor the like, might prove effective in determining what happened. Ideally, the\ncharacters manage to hijack the alien vessel, armed with the appropriate controls,\nand catapult into the extradimensional spaces where Zoraster lies.\nEither way they choose to travel, there’s no going back now.\nTHE FINAL ASSAULT\nWhether they arrive by ship or under their own power, the characters discover that\nthe alien city of Zoraster is really a Horizon Realm where the powerful spirit called Khuvon\nhas been putting Avatars in order to save them from the Avatar Storm and to keep them\nfrom the clutches of the Zigg’raugglurr. A materialized Khuvon confronts them on their\narrival, angrily demanding to know why they have intruded, and it’s quite possible a fight\nmight break out before very long. Any battle is almost immediately interrupted by an even\ngreater threat, however — the arrival of the Zigg assault force!\nAlthough the characters likely do not agree with the containment strategy of the\nKhuvon and the Thal’hun, it’s even more certain that neither side wants to see the Zigg\ndrain the power of the Avatars for their own alien purposes. Unless the Storyteller\nwants a two-part (or three-way) battle, a temporary alliance is recommended at this\nstage. Some of the restrictions that have burdened magic on Earth might be eased while\nin this Realm, though characters should be aware that this is a temporary benefit at\nbest, meaning that they can meet the attackers nearly full-force. Joined by Khuvon’s\npowers, cultists and mages alike rally to meet the incoming Zigg assault, with the fate\nof the trapped Avatars, and thus the universe, hanging in the balance.\nStorytellers are encouraged to make this battle as bizarre as it is desperate,\nplaying up the alien wonders of Zoraster as well as the strange powers and tactics of\nthe Zigg. Fortunately, many of the Zigg’s most potent powers are somewhat limited\nby the nature of the realm, but they are still formidable enemies possessed of great\nintelligence and obviously superior technology. Khuvon and the majority of the\ncultists should perish during the battle as well, either to buy the characters time to\nrally or perhaps as a great sacrifice designed to disable a good number of the Zigg\nattack force if things are looking grim. In the end, however, if players wish to\ntriumph, they will have to employ strong tactics, quick thinking and some clever\n(not to mention potent) magic as well.\nKA LUON\nAt any time throughout the story, the aliens commonly called the Grays\nmight choose to become involved, making them excellent Storyteller devices\nif the players have a run of bad luck or otherwise find themselves losing through\nno real fault of their own. The Ka Luon have an antagonistic rivalry with the\nZigg’raugglurr and might appear at a critical moment to offer the characters aid\nagainst the Zigg. When the characters enter Zoraster, there is a strong possibility\nthat a few of the Ka Luon are currently in residence. Depending on how things\nprogress, the Grays might prove to be horrible enemies or unexpected allies.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n132\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nTHIS IS THE WAY THE WORLD ENDS\nIf the Zigg have triumphed, then they have garnered the majority of the Avatars\nof the universe and its magical forces have inexorably drained away. Even the science\nof the Technocracy and the Ka Luon ultimately fails, and everything of wonder,\ninventiveness and magic fades away to become a possession of the Zigg. It is\nquestionable whether their alien minds actually take joy in this, or whether it is\nmerely the logical conclusion of millennia of work. Either way, magic dies, the\nGauntlet becomes impassable and the universe is doomed to a lingering death,\ndrowned in mediocrity.\nShould the characters win, things are a bit more positive, even if they\ncannot reverse the loss of magic in the current universe. With the Zigg repulsed\nand the Thal’hun shattered, the Avatars will remain intact, but during the battle\nthe containment system is damaged. As a result, the Avatars begin draining away\nto… well, where is not immediately apparent. Beyond the walls of Creation, in\nsome other place, these shards of the One begin joining together to start a new\nuniverse. Alas, the soul of the current one is left to die, as its power flows into\na new place. It will take a long time to complete, but the characters have ensured\nthe beginning of the next Cycle, even if it does come at the expense of a\nwhimpering end to this one.\nWhatever the characters have accomplished, magic is fading away rapidly.\nWhile they are capable of returning to Earth, it should be obvious that magic is still\ndying. They may take comfort in their victory and what it has done to continue the\ncycle of Avatars and Ascension, and it is recommended that the Storyteller offer\nsome other rewards and compensations to help ease the sense of failure that might\notherwise surround this conclusion. Ultimately, the characters and their world ease\ngently into normalcy, where magic has no further place — but the potential of\nhumanity might just be about to be realized at last.\nHELL ON EARTH\nWhat if reality’s slow, inexorable slide into decay picks up some steam and the\nNephandi find themselves poised to attain victory over Creation itself? Just as\nAscension can, theoretically, be achieved by humanity as a whole, so, too, can\nDescent. But what happens when the Consensus betrays the promise of its own inner\ndivinity? What happens when mankind chooses darkness over light, death over life?\nIf you choose to walk this way, be careful. You are about to betray everything\nyou ever believed about the Ascension War and humanity’s place in the world of the\nAwakened. Are you still reading? Good. Because this is more than just the story of\nAscension’s most terrible and merciless enemies. It is the tale of humanity’s\nweakness and the dismal failure of the Awakened to champion the cause of\nenlightenment and give Ascension to the Sleepers.\nTHE LEAD-UP\nBefore the final chapter is told, the stage must be well and truly set. Let the\nmages feel that, due to the failings of Sleeper and Awakened alike, things are\ncoming apart at the seams. “Hell on Earth,” after all, should not come as a total\nsurprise when it begins so much as it should seem a grim but logical conclusion\nto reality’s troubles.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n133\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nTHE UNNAMED\nThe Master of the Tenth Seat has worn many names over the many millennia of\nhis existence. In medieval Europe, they called him the Black Man, patron of witchcraft\nand devil-worship — some believed that he was the Devil. In the Arabic world, where\nhe abided for many years in long ago days, he went by the name of al-Aswad, the name\nhe gave to those who followed after him as Fallen Oracles. To the Sumerians, he was Ut-\nNapishtam, the primordial man who was chosen by the gods to survive the Great Flood\nand was thereafter granted immortality but made to abide apart from all lesser creatures.\nIn truth, he was all these things and none, the anointed champion of the darkness\nfrom beyond Creation, and his True Name is lost to the deep memory of time. Perhaps\nthe most far-thinking human being ever to exist, he was chosen not for his power or\nhis knowledge — for with life enough a man may develop these qualities — but instead\nfor his wisdom, patience and sense of strategy. The gods who raised him up remembered\nbeing outcast from the endless shadow in which they abided, shoved away by the\nhateful presence of something new — existence. They looked on it and were pained\nby jealousy, for they, though powerful and terrible, could never truly be. That privilege\nwas reserved for all that existed within the hateful light.\nAs the Lord of Entropy and master of all things wicked, the Unnamed has at last\nfound the opportunity to grant his masters what they desire — the Descent and utter\ncorruption of this reality.\nTHE OTHER ASWADIM\nIn addition to many “ordinary” Nephandi and other servants of darkness, the\nUnnamed still enjoys the support — maintained through canny politics, incentives and,\nof course, the threat of their destruction — of the first five people to accept his offer. The\nyoungest of them hails from Pharaonic Egypt and all are vastly powerful. Naturally, all have\ntheir own agendas and each has accepted a lesser position only because the Unnamed is so\nmuch more mystically potent than any one or two (or perhaps even three) of them and none\ntrust each other enough to attempt to depose him. Still, it is possible to turn one Fallen\nOracle against another, given time, effort and planning. Perhaps, it is even possible to turn\nall of the Aswadim, including their founder and master, upon one another. Whether such\nan act would allow the world to be freed from the grip of terror or would only set the stage\nfor a tyrant yet more terrible, however, is a question none can answer.\nTHE AVATAR STORM\nIn the Fall, the Avatar Storm plays an entirely different role than the one envisioned\nin the more “standard” Ascension cosmology. Just prior to the fall of the Gauntlet, Fallen\nmagic unleashes this nightmare torrent upon Sleeper and Awakened alike, a singular\nmoment of untold worldwide destruction. The rent and tattered souls become a new kind\nof widderslainte Avatar when the worlds of flesh and spirit bleed together. Or perhaps it\nis more accurate to say that the spirit-shards even bond with Nephandi to become the\nFallen equivalent of Anakim, a new nobility among the damned.\nCLAMING THE PRIZE\nThe first phase of the Unnamed’s final plan involves the capture of Horizon, there\nto eventually exploit the powerful Nodes connected to the realm in order to spread the\ntaint of his masters to the farthest reaches of Earth. Fortunately, little but magic stands\nin his way. Horizon has been sealed since Lord Gilmore barred all from entry (or exit)\nby means of powerful wards. The Aswadim, however, are arguably the most powerful\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n134\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nindividual mages within or beyond Creation. With a few hours worth of rituals, the\nUnnamed shatters the seals holding Horizon shut and unleashes a terrible conflagra-\ntion, destroying all spirits and disembodied mages who yet reside therein.\nTriumphantly, the Unnamed enters into the blasted ruins of Horizon and begins to\nstrip the realm of its Quintessence stockpiles. He then uses his mastery of the Qlippothic\nSpheres to send connections back along the ley lines that connect the realm to its anchoring\nNodes on Earth, nine of the world’s most powerful. Through these channels, he will pour\nout his corruption and thereby defile the Earth. In the Council Chamber, he sets his left\nhand upon the Saxum Oculorum (the “Stone of Eyes” which records all that has ever been\nsaid within the heart of Horizon) and it burns black, run through with cracks.\nLOST HORIZON\nNaturally, virtually every Tradition mage on Earth, as well as no small number of\nTechnocrats and scattered others, will want to launch an assault against the Aswadim\noccupying Horizon (the heart of the Traditions’ strength). Battling the Nephandi has\nTHE CHANGE\nMost of the Nephandi empowered by the loosing of the Storm become\nquite potent, having channeled the essence of dozens or even hundreds of\npeople into themselves, thus expanding their Awakened abilities. Consider\nthose Nephandi who partake of the dark sacrament of the Storm (a select few,\nperhaps only 10% of all Fallen) to benefit from the following changes: +5 Traits\nto Attributes, +15 Traits of Abilities, +2 Arete Traits (to a maximum of 8), +5\nlevels of Qlippothic Spheres and +2 Willpower Traits (no maximum).\nThese alterations, however, also put a strain on the sanity of the affected\nparties. All such Nephandi gain a permanently active derangement, to reflect\nthe psychic shock of so gruesomely and forcibly incorporating the tormented\nsouls of others into one’s own being. Naturally, as none of them particularly\nneed the boost (and the Unnamed forbids any of them to do so, given the\nprobably of insanity resulting from it), the Aswadim refrain from the rite.\nSIGNING OFF\nThe last transmission from the “Rogue Council” is sent from Horizon.\nNow, the Unnamed feels no need for secrecy, safe within the walls of the most\npowerful man-made realm ever to exist. The Unnamed allows the following\nmessage to reach Traditionalists, Disparates, Orphans and even Technocrats,\nseemingly at random. Larger chronicles can see characters receiving fragments\nof the message, perhaps only a sentence or two, perhaps distorted or in different\nlanguages. Thus do you drive characters to seek each other out to complete the\npuzzle, or to hoard their precious clues, confusing the issue further.\n“I am the one who came before and shall follow after. I am your father and\nyour destroyer, architect of your destiny. I am him who is come in glory to\ncrush the thrones of the Earth beneath my tread. You have known me by many\nnames, my children, but you know not the slightest part of my power. Submit\nto me and know the bounty of my love; defy me and suffer the agonies of my\nboundless wrath.

Even those\nwho realize that this is likely a bad idea don’t know what else to do. In a larger chronicle,\nthe troupe is invited to send a representative cabal or two to this meeting. Those players\nwhose characters choose to remain behind can then portray the Tradition represen-\ntatives from other cities at the symposium. You should prepare a wide range of briefing\nsheets for these Storyteller characters. Full character sheets are probably not required\nat what is ostensibly a peaceful gathering, but if you anticipate trouble or challenges,\ninclude enough statistics to cover the foreseen problems.\nIn the midst of this model of poor planning, the characters are taken aside by a\nhooded and cloaked figure. The individual, a man of seemingly middling years, places\nan elaborate key into the hands of one character and tells her to “seek the Parma Magica\nin the ruins of Doissetep.” He tells the characters that they must go to Horizon with\nthe ill-fated attackers. There they must use the backdoor found in the Tomb of La Salle,\nthe Hermetic Master who is largely credited with the formation of the Traditions, to\nenter the Shard Realm of Forces at the site of the annihilated Chantry. At that, he\nwalks away and all but disappears. Within seconds, the character can’t even remember\nwhich direction he went in. All that is left are his instructions and his key.\nSHIELD OF FAITH\nNo matter what plan they ultimately decide on, the battle at Horizon is fierce\nand desperate. While the characters of the representative cabal follow their path in\ntheir own scenes, the rest of the chronicle can play out the ill-fated assault on\nHorizon, with the failure of the Storyteller characters foreshadowing the Descent to\ncome. While they may encounter some fighting (enough to get their blood going and\nkeep them jumpy), let the characters see only as much as they have to in order to get\nto the tomb. Leave them confused as to what was taking place and with nothing more\nthan the vaguest of descriptions of what has happened to the others. They seem to\nbe drawn to the tomb, and from there into the Shard Realm of Forces. Make the\ncharacters sweat a bit in this frightening Realm, but don’t punish them too harshly.\nThey still have a lot of hard work ahead of them.\nSearching through the ruins, one of the characters eventually finds a charred\nbook titled Bonisagus’ Parma Magica. A quick glance reveals it to be a text about the\nquest to unify the Houses of Hermes and that journey’s reflection in the formation\nof the Nine Mystic Traditions. It was uplifting, perhaps, in better days, but now it\nis seemingly useless. No other trace of a “Parma Magica” is to be found among the\nrubble, but just as the cabal is about to give in to despair, the key given over to one\nof the mages begins to grow warm. Then, of its own accord, it floats into midair,\npassing harmlessly through any container it is stored in. The key “unfolds,” warping\nalong its spatial axes to become a golden gateway, beyond which a battered but still\nbeautiful realm can be seen. The cabal has an open invite to Balador, courtesy of\nAkrites Salonikas and Marianna.\nTHE AEGIS\nWhen the cabal arrives at Balador, the characters discover that, despite any\nrumors they have heard or evidence they have seen to the contrary, the Pleasuredome\nis still very much alive. Marianna, the keeper of the realm, greets them, and along\nwith several prominent Hermetic wizards, reveals the secret of the book. When\nproperly examined, it is revealed to contain a gleaming magical shield within its\npages— the Aegis, otherwise known as the Greater Parma Magica. She explains that,\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n136\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nwith the help of the characters, this powerful spell can, hopefully, help a number of\nthe world’s Awakened to weather the coming storm alive.\nThe shield itself holds extraordinarily powerful enchantments in it, designed to\ncreate a two-way ward with all nine Spheres. Nothing comes in or goes out once the\nGreater Parma Magica is activated. The characters will be asked to help with the\npreparations— huge amounts of Tass have to be fed to the Great Parma Magica when\nit is in place, and circles and seals must be placed in the proper configurations. It then\nfalls to the recipients to inform any characters who didn’t come along (as well as\nanyone else they wish to protect) that they must hurry to receive the protection of\nthe shield. The amount of time the earthbound characters have to prepare for the\njourney once alerted is up to the Storyteller, although it should be a matter of\nminutes rather than hours.\nTo avoid any petty last-minute snubs resulting in pointless character death, the\nStoryteller may also rule that Marianna or one of the other powerful Tradition mages\npresent sends out a massive Mind message to mages around the world alerting them\nto the shelter being provided. They might even transport characters who have no\nmeans of traveling there themselves into Balador. This last should be presented as\na desperate option, however, to avoid the sense that Narrator characters will solve\nall of the players’ characters’ problems in this scenario.\nTHE STORM IS LOOSED\nNot long after the last characters reach the safety of Balador, the Unnamed\ncontends with the wills locked within the Avatar Storm. A great instinctive dread\nhangs within these miserable soul-fragments, a beast’s terror at the thought of being\nforced out of its den. By strictest mental fortitude, the Unnamed “pulls” the Storm\nout of the Gauntlet and unleashes it upon both the world and the Umbrae at once.\nThose Awakened who do not have protections against both Prime and Spirit assaults\ndie horribly. Though spared some of the worst of the storm by their weaker spirits,\ncountless mortals die as well due to the sudden influx of energies.\nAs the Avatar Storm crashes into Balador, it is apparent that the Aegis will hold\nif nothing goes wrong. Of course, something does go wrong. The Unnamed, having\ndefeated the would-be invaders of Horizon and sensing a flaw in his plan, leaves the\nother Aswadim to continue the ritual that keeps the Avatar Storm raging and comes\nto Balador to attend to the Aegis personally. A cataclysmic shaking of the realm’s\nfoundations heralds his arrival. Some of the Storm slips in, probably killing mages\nstanding just paces away from the characters before dissipating. As this happens, the\nUnnamed can be seen outside the Aegis, hurling terrible sorceries at it.\nThis should be a moment of high drama, as the players face down the most potent\nbeing in Creation. It should appear that the Unnamed is about to break through\n(perhaps delayed only by some of their more clever or powerful efforts), when abruptly,\nhe smiles cryptically at them and withdraws, vanishing utterly. Not long afterward, the\nStorm begins to subside, eventually fading back to its “normal” level of disturbance. It\nmay flare up again from time to time, as drama requires, but it has served its main\npurpose — destroying most of the Awakened opposed to the Descent.\nA BRIEF RESPITE\nFor a while, things grow quiet again, as the Unnamed takes stock of his\nsituation, recovers his strength and compensates for unexpected casualties. Give the\ncharacters enough time to perform some missions of their own during this period.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n137\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nSome might wish to research powerful magics or Wonders they hope will help turn\nthe tide, while others will seek out missing allies and mentors to see if they have\nsurvived the terrible conflagration. Others might have yet more humble goals, such\nas finding un-Awakened friends and family members and doing what they can to\nkeep them safe. Everyone will be busy — there’s plenty left to do now that it’s obvious\nEarth and its nearby dimensions are in serious trouble.\nLet the characters have as much time as they need here, without letting them\nfeel as though they necessarily have any time at all. Some of these plans may work\nand others definitely will not. In general, only the most innovative contingencies\nhave any chance of proving useful in the days to come. This section is more of a\nperiod of time than a series of events. The Fallen entrench themselves, just as the\nremaining mages of Earth do.\nIn addition to any plans and plot the characters might devise, the following\nscenes can offer some additional ideas for quests to undertake during this dark time,\nincluding a potential climactic battle on behalf of the Traditions the characters can\ntake part in. It’s even possible that the characters devise their own last ditch effort\nto destroy the Unnamed, in which case it is highly recommended that the Storyteller\nstructure the closing events of the chronicle around the success of this desperate\neffort — or its failure.\nTHE GAUNTLET FALLS\nOverwhelmed by human fear and the belief in what is impossible and yet plainly\ntrue, the Gauntlet crumbles, allowing the Umbrae to wash into our world. Sprits of\npain, death and torment, drawn close by the suffering inflicted by the Avatar Storm,\nare among the first into the world. Humanity’s shield against the terrors of its dreams\nhas just failed and nothing will ever be the same again. Ghosts walk among the living\nand demons crawl free from the pits of countless hells, eager to feed on warm blood.\nNor is that the extent of the Unnamed’s crusade against the outer realms. Using yet\nmore of his stockpiled Tass and blasphemous rituals scribed on the outer walls of Creation,\nthe Unnamed sends his Aswadim to the Axis Mundi bearing a cauldron of venom, which\nthey pour into a wound in the tree at the heart of the spirit world. Within a week, it withers\nand topples, dropping dying branches throughout the worlds. Some might even end up on\nEarth. A few of these branches might live long enough for people to find them and save\nthem, meaning that hope is not entirely lost. The characters might be able to recover some\nbranches from the Alder Bole. Kept alive and enchanted properly, such remnants of the\ntree can allow for travel between worlds and contact with the surviving Oracles (if any),\nas well as serving as potent weapons against malevolent spirits.\nTHE DEATH OF THE MACHINE\nWith no Gauntlet to hold back superstition, and faith in the power of science and\ntechnology to protect the world at an all-time low, the Technocracy’s paradigm falls\napart. The Umbrae wash over the world, dissolving 10,000 years of human progress and\nreducing mankind to barbarism. Laws that were once true are no longer so. Friction on\na dry branch may cause it to shudder and bleed, but it will not start a fire.\nAs their reality crumbles, the surviving Technocrats approach remaining\nTradition authorities — the characters among them — and ask for succor from the\nNephandi, in exchange for what resources they can bring to bear in the final hours\nof the conflict. This should be a pivotal roleplaying session, where the characters are\namong the policy-makers. Accepting the help of the Technocracy might seem a\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n138\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nnatural option in the face of the opposition, but some old enmities die hard. Coupled\nwith the fact that Technocratic magic has become much less reliable on the whole,\nthe debate might be much more heated than it first appears it should be.\nAN OFFER YOU CAN’T REFUSE\nNow that his control is stronger, the Unnamed has no problem with offering a slice\nof the pie to any Awakened person who will hear his pitch. Normally, intermediaries make\nthe pitch, but the characters in the representative cabal are somehow different or special.\nHe will want to offer them their hearts’ deepest desires personally. Larger chronicles will\nsee cabals, op teams or individual mages approached in quieter moments. The Unnamed\nhas some idea of each mage’s nature, and he tailors his approach accordingly.\nPivotally influential mages get the personal treatment, while less influential\nmages merit only an intermediary (portrayed by Narrators). Separate each of the\ngroups, and have your team deal with each group at the same time, to avoid spoiling\nthe surprise and to foster uncertainty between the characters. Did a fellow mage\naccept or decline the offer? Which side is each working for now? Distrust between\nthe mages assists the Unnamed’s cause, a fact he is quick to exploit.\nTHE ORDER’S LAST STAND\nFaced with corruption of every Node on Earth and the inversion of the natural\norder, Lord Gilmore of the Order of Hermes hatches a final, desperate ploy — but\none that, even if successful, will cost the Awakened dearly. This is a brutally\ndangerous mission and the characters are among those elite forces selected to\nundertake it. It’s also possible he might inadvertently select a turncoat, in which case\nthings get interesting indeed…\nGilmore’s plan is simple. He intends to take most of the surviving members of the\nOrder of Hermes and some allied mages and make a final stand at a remote location.\nHe knows it is hopeless, but it is merely to buy time for a second force to infiltrate and\nretake Mus, a secure and easily defended realm conquered by the Fallen during their\ninitial attack. (If the Storyteller desires, another realm more familiar to the chronicle\nor suitable to its needs can be substituted for Mus.) While the massed Hermetics do\ntheir best to occupy the bulk of the Nephandi forces, the characters can infiltrate the\nnear-empty garrison and establish a base where the remaining Tradition members and\ntheir allies can operate from. The characters have enough time to ready themselves,\ndraw up some tactics and say their good-byes, then the attack must begin.\nTrue enough, the Fallen are completely unprepared for the attack and their\narmies are absent, having been sent to deal with the massed army of the Order of\nHermes. Still, there are some defenders there, and they quickly recover their wits.\nTailor the number of Nephandi present to the power of the cabal (and to the number\nof extras and Narrators you have available). The siege should be extremely difficult,\nbut possible. If the cabal makes the right moves, then the realm can be restored to\nthe Traditions, giving them a stable base of operations from which to strike against\nthe Nephandi. It might not be much, but it is better than nothing.\nTHE DESCENT\nNow that the Gauntlet is no more, the ordered ranks of Traditions and the\nTechnocratic Union have fallen and the other willworkers of the Earth are scattered\nin fear and fractiousness, the Unnamed raises high his ultimate weapon, ready to end\nthe war forever and break humanity to his yoke.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n139\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nIn a ritual held at the new site of his rule, in the blasted wasteland that was once\nEden, the Unnamed summons his masters to Earth, giving them leave to incarnate\nphysically within Creation. As they do so, pockets of the Tapestry dissolve forever,\nunable to support the weight of the chthonic titans. Here and there, around the world,\npregnant women miscarry children, finding horribly misshapen things that crawl away\nof their own accord. Animals bleat and howl, some of them going mad and rabid and\nothers just dying. Bodies of water turn to blood and venom. The order of Creation is\nbroken, and Those Who Came Before are again given dominion over all that is.\nOf course, the Unnamed keeps his word to most of those Fallen who supported him\nin his rise and subsequent conquest. Each of the Aswadim is given an abode from which\nto exert his or her will, though most of the day-to-day affairs of running Creation fall to\nthe lesser Nephandi, the gilledians and adsinistrati, supported by Storm-born shock\ntroops. Characters who previously accepted the Unnamed’s offer, and who have worked\nwell toward his will, are likewise rewarded with domain over the local chronicle area.\nThe Nephandi are virtually unstoppable at this point and victories, when they\nare had at all, are small and come only through hit-and-run tactics. None can now\ndelude themselves into believing that the war persists. For now and perhaps forever,\nit is ended. Beneath a sky of seething molten crimson and choking black mists, the\nFallen sit in judgment over the desert wastes once known as Earth.\nTHE END OF DAYS\nWhen all is said and done, the world writhes in the throes of Descent,\ndamnation seemingly everlasting. Magic still lives, though the numbers of its\npractitioners are much diminished, save for the Fallen. The Traditions are a frail\nshadow of their former power and the Technocracy is fallen entirely. Perhaps 10%\nof the world’s (non-Nephandic) Awakened have survived this holocaust.\nDemons, dark spirits and Unspeakable Horrors from Beyond walk the Earth\nwith impunity and some lord over scattered enclaves of miserable survivors as dread\ntaskmasters and cruel barons. The Fallen revel in what they have wrought and settle\nin to enjoy an eternity of ruling over a helpless human race largely reduced to Iron\nAge civilization and subject to depredations unknown since the worst excesses of the\npriests of the demon-gods of the ancient world.\nIf the characters have done well, however, then some manner of resistance lives\non, surviving to bring the fight to the Aswadim and perhaps even topple them one\nday. The process of driving out the dark is centuries-long at best, but without courage\nand dedication, one day it can begin anew. For now, however, it is enough to know\nthat the end has come and gone and Ascension has proven to be a lie, a feast of ashes\nsupped upon in sorrow by a failed human race.\nTHE EARTH WILL SHAKE\nIt has been estimated that as much as 100 tons of interplanetary material falls to\nearth every day. During the last three decades, over 100 air bursts — most measured\nin megatons — were detected throughout Earth’s upper atmosphere. Scientists who\nhave calculated the entire heat content of the planet over the course of its existence\nbelieve that the planet might have frozen over by now were it not for the additional\nwarmth that the occasional collision with asteroids and comets generates.\nIn short, space debris collides with our world all the time. Most of it burns up\nor blasts apart from air friction. Objects large enough to reach the surface intact\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n140\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nbecome a cause for what surface dweller Professor Richard Binzel of MIT defines as\n“concern.” By his reckoning and others, a meteorite large enough to ruin a prime\npiece of real estate comes down approximately once every thousand years. Every\nhundred thousand years or so, something large enough to change a lot of people’s\nreligion hits. And around every couple hundred million we catch something big\nenough to knock the top dozen rungs off of the planet’s evolutionary ladder.\nThe following story concerns just such an event. The characters learn that a\nlarge meteoroid is on a collision course with Earth. Is there time to avert it, and what\nmethods must be deployed to do so? And what can be done should these methods\nfail? Can anything be done at all?\nTHE CELESTIAL BALL\nConcurrent with the story in the physical world runs a parallel plot involving\nthe reverberations of the impending impact in the Umbra. Storytellers may wish to\ndownplay this spiritual aspect of the very physical problem — at least in the early\nchapters. Although presented as interstitial scenes bridging the physical chapters,\n“The Celestial Ball” may be run all at once as prelude, interlude or denouement,\ndepending on how the Storyteller chooses to pace the story — fast-paced action in\na race against time, or a drawn-out process of mounting intellectual discovery.\nThe spiritual shock wave of the collision could come all at once on a single\nUmbral voyage foreshadowing the event long in advance, or it could unfold in brief\nglimpses through dreams and visions that increase in frequency and intensity as the\nevent becomes imminent. Conversely, the Storyteller might find that the Umbral\nsubplot gradually eclipses the deteriorating situation in the material world. The\ncharacters might focus their efforts on interacting with the planetary entities rather\nthan dealing with the mounting panic and natural disasters on the material plane —\nacting globally rather than locally, so to speak.\nCONSIDERATIONS\nThis scenario begins with the characters becoming aware of the meteoric\nmenace through an unlikely pair of amateur astronomers, Abner and Whitney\nTripplethorpe. They have observed the asteroid — which they’ve labeled Typhon\n2004 — and calculated its path. They are now attempting to alert both the political\nand scientific authorities to its presence. If one of your characters is into astronomy,\nshe could learn of the Tripplethorpes through any number of amateur publications,\nmessage boards or chatrooms through which they have tried to make their findings\npublic. Otherwise, the characters might bump into them by chance meeting as the\npair travels around seeking any important personage who will hear them out. Not\nonly that, but it appears that other entities have heard what the Tripplethorpes have\nto say and aren’t too happy with them, which means the astronomers might require\nprotection if they hope to live long enough to spread the word.\nUnless the Tripplethorpes find the allies and resources they require to notify the\nworld of its incipient fate within the bounds of the local chronicle, they will move on,\nleaving rumors, speculation and a minimal amount of information for the characters\nto consider. With a small chronicle, you may be able to have the characters travel with\nthe Tripplethorpes, but larger games tend to remain based in the same location.\nCharacters will need to either persuade the Tripplethorpes to remain in their region\nor gather the information that the two possess as quickly as possible. If the two have\nmade some friends, they will attempt to keep in contact with updates about their quest\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n141\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\neven after they have departed, possibly via email or registered post, allowing the\nStoryteller team to demonstrate the couple’s progress through the use of props.\nMEANWHILE, IN THE UMBRA…\nCharacters who are sensitive to the spirit world — such as those with the\nMedium, or Nightmares Merits or Flaws, mages with high levels in the Mind or Spirit\nSpheres, seers and the like — may experience dreams or visions related to events\ndeveloping in the Umbra. Likewise, Storyteller characters such as street prophets or\nmadmen, anyone who might be able to tap into the mystical side of the universe, can\nspout fragments illustrating the growing insanity beyond the Gauntlet. You can use\nthis method to introduce and flesh out the Umbral story or to entice characters to\ncross the Gauntlet and experience the Umbral subplot for themselves.\nWhile the inhabitants of the physical world remain unaware of the threat, the\nspirit world darkens with foreboding. Vistas appear that show events to come, but\nnot their ultimate cause: large-scale disasters, earthquakes, tidal waves, volcanic\neruptions, cities blasted into ruins, black clouds that fill the sky and blot out the sun.\nIn the Low Umbra, mass movements and migrations are underway as the wraith\npopulace makes room for a great influx of the newly dead. In the Spirit Wilds, the\nanimal and vegetable kingdoms seem to be going insane, as herds stampede for no\ndiscernible reason and predators either launch into berserk killing sprees or flee in\nblind terror with their tails between their legs. Ancient trees may uproot themselves\nto join in the panic, while smaller plants shrink and shrivel back into the ground,\nas if trying to hide from the sun. Mages who are normally on friendly terms with such\nspirits can engage them in conversation and learn that they know that some major\nchange is coming, but do not know its exact nature or cause.\nCONFIRMATIONS\nAssuming they can be kept safe from the various forces seeking to do them harm —\nthe Union, doomsday cultists, etc. — Abner and Whitney continue their quest to alert the\nleaders of the world to its peril, presumably with the aid of at least some of the characters\nby this point. Old classmates may be looked up, favors called in, strings pulled, palms\ngreased, backs scratched, hands washed, anything to push the news up the top-heavy chain\nof command. Allies and Contacts Backgrounds, not to mention social and bureaucratic\nskills, must figure heavily into the action here, and rounds of tiresome appointments may\nbe condensed into a series of challenges based on these Traits. Key scenes can be played out\nas cut scenes, with extras in bureaucratic roles, illustrating the static nature of the Masses.\nIn large games, it’s possible some characters are actively opposing the investi-\ngations of those who believe the Tripplethorpes through their own resources. Not\nall of the characters in the game should believe the esoteric claptrap being spouted\nby these eccentric amateurs. Mentors and other Storyteller characters have their\nown opinions and act of their own accord, perhaps even in competition to those they\nmight normally assist. Such conflicts can spur additional subplots and add to the\ndrama of your story. If the characters manage to trap each other in competitive\njockeying for too long, then they have only themselves to blame for the inevitable.\nTHE CELESTIAL BALL: INVITATIONS\nIn the spiritual remnant of the Library of Alexandria, Chief Librarian Aristarchus\ninvokes the aid of Urania, the Muse of Astronomy, to determine the cause of the astral\ndisturbance, while Chief Astronomer Hypatia marks its progress from the Mouseion\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n142\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nobservatory. Mages who have had favorable dealing with the Library in the past might\nbe approached and called upon by name to help in the crisis. Hypatia asks any\nexperienced Umbral traveler to journey to the Epiphamy known as the Continuum\nOrrery, a sort of programmable interactive planetarium, to see what can be learned there.\nMeanwhile, a beautiful silver-haired woman rides a bluish-white mare through-\nout the lands of the Vulgate, pursuing a quest of her own. She claims to know the cause\nof the invasion, so she will show up at the Library eventually, but the characters may\ncross her path at any point. She gives her name as Diana and has the glamour of a very\npowerful spirit — perhaps even an Incarna. According to her, the stones in the sky\nmake up an advance force sent by a cold and dark entity from beyond the Horizon. This\nspirit is desirous of Diana’s mother and has come to take her by force if she does not\ngive herself to him willingly. Diana seeks allies to secure her mother’s freedom, without\ngiving up much more about her true nature or purpose in the Vulgate.\nCONFLAGRATION\nBeyond the world of Sleeper politics, the leaders of the Awakened community\nrespond in their own way. Some older mages see the asteroid as an agent of their own\nhubris, sent as their punishment for losing the Ascension War, or even for daring to\nwage it in the first place. While they retire to their chambers to await the end, the\nyounger leaders — who have yet to learn the full meaning of hubris — seize the\nopportunity to take a more proactive stance.\nSAVING THE DAY\nIdeas and plans fly about the magical community, and characters in large games\ncan hear about them in a number of ways. Emissaries from the Rogue Council (or\ntransmissions directly from the same body) present their “definitive” plans, pitching\nfor several characters’ help, perhaps splitting and reforming several cabals on the basis\nof skills and/or merit. Prophetic dreams inspire the spiritual. Desperate Avatars\nmanifest in spontaneous Seekings to advise for or against a character’s plans. Develop\nseveral more “solutions” and introduce them through Storyteller characters or devices.\nSpread rumors. Conflicting ideas will confuse efforts even further than they already\nshould be, adding to the stress of the characters and entangling their efforts further.\nWill the Traditions and Technocracy need to work together to avert disaster, or will\nthey each draw their own plans for averting or surviving the inevitable? Perhaps the\nTraditions scramble to divert the asteroid in the Umbra, while the Technocracy works\nsolely in the physical realm. Getting the two groups to actually work together is nearly\nimpossible. The newfound tolerance of certain factions within each group for the others’\nalternative theorems, however, might find splinter cells actively working together. The\nsuccess of a joint operation would go a long way toward encouraging further cross-\npollination of ideas and projects. It’s far more likely they’ll trip over each other’s feet.\nIn the event that their peers laugh at their ideas, or even refuse to acknowledge\nthe risk to humanity in the first place, the characters have to go it alone.\nNUCLEAR DIVERSIONS\nEven if the Tripplethorpes fail to alert the authorities, the major world govern-\nments will learn of the asteroid Typhon through the diligence of NASA’s Near Earth\nAsteroid Tracking program or through the European agency known as Spaceguard. For\nthe purposes of this story, the response of the geopolitical superpowers is essentially\nthat of the Technocracy, a pragmatically hard-nosed countering of raw physical force\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n143\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nwith raw physical force. Of course, the Void Engineers will be at the forefront of this\neffort — raising the question of how a couple of amateurs were able to identify the\nthreat before the Enlightened Scientists entrusted with this very job…\nIn a Technocratic chronicle, the characters can become involved in the nuclear\nsolution on several levels. Those who have already researched the asteroid and its path\npossess invaluable data for the project, and can save the Union considerable time,\npossibly accelerating the project enough to divert or destroy Typhon before it becomes\na real danger. Op teams might be directed by their superiors to counter uncovered plans\nby the Traditions to divert Typhon, plans that would throw their own calculations out\nof whack. By having a secret missile silo nearby, the Technocratic community will stir\ninto action to prepare for launch, drawing information and resources from wherever\nthey can find it, including the characters.\nTHE CELESTIAL BALL: ARRIVALS\nDiana brings the characters to a grove far from the more heavily inhabited regions\nof the Vulgate, back along the River of Language toward the Spirit Wilds. Crouched\nbetween the roots of an impossibly large tree is an old woman dressed in rags, weeping\nsilently. Even those who have already met with Mother Earth in her various guises\nwould probably not recognize this wretched creature. Her initial reaction to human\nvisitors will not be friendly, and might even be outwardly hostile, depending on how\nthe characters act when first seeing her. If treated appropriately, however, both she and\nDiana are open to any suggestions the characters might make about seeking safety.\nAt an especially dramatic moment, the sky above darkens as the invader arrives\nin full force. The stones hanging in the air drift aside to make way for a veritable floating\ncontinent that descends to blot out the astral sky. Its pitted, cratered underbelly nearly\ntouches the ground in places, engulfing or crushing the tallest Spires and triggering\nterrible storms and earthquakes across the Vulgate. Over the uproar, an impossibly\nloud masculine voice booms a warning — Typhon has found them! The characters\nmay choose to face this threat head on by traveling straightaway to the aerial\ncontinent, or they may stay to defend the mother from whatever comes to get her.\nUltimately, though, the defenders will lose to brute strength and force of\nnumbers. The characters will then be seized and taken to the floating continent.\nAlternatively, the characters may elect to leave Diana and her mother behind while\nthey meet the incursion head on, with whatever other forces they can muster —\nother mages, spirit allies, even Patrons. In this case they will still be captured, and\nwill not know what befell the two ladies until the next section.\nCATASTROPHE\nCharacters who are directly involved with any of the plans described in the\nprevious section will naturally see its results for themselves. The progress of the other\nplans can be reported through different Tradition channels, by scrying mages or even\nindependent astronomers. Divergent efforts will undoubtedly conflict with each\nother, and any diplomatic skills the characters might possess could lessen these\nconflicts, and new alliances could develop on their own. Like politics, the threat of\nextinction can make for strange bedfellows.\nIf the players have managed to develop a method (or series of methods) to break\nTyphon away from its course or into pieces, the moment of fragmentation is an ideal time\nto close the game session — a cliffhanger moment. The same applies if their methods have\nfailed and Typhon sails past the moon into Earth’s orbit. The next game session can then\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n144\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nbe dedicated to the five or so hours remaining before the asteroid finally hits. Characters\nshould be denied any downtime actions between these sessions. Place them in a time stop\nto stretch the suspense until your next game. This will also give the Storyteller team time\nto plan the events of the following session and how they will handle the events of the\nimpact. Regardless of the players’ efforts, though, it should become readily apparent before\nlong that having so many different plans has undercut the efforts of the Awakened, and that\nat least a large portion of Typhon is still on course to impact the Earth.\nDoes this mean that the Storyteller has to look her players in the face and tell\nthem that they fail no matter how well they play? Not entirely. Even a marginal\nsuccess deserves some reward. A best-case scenario would be that Typhon is blasted\napart, or torn apart by gravitational turbulence, leaving at least one kilometer-wide\nchunk on a collision course, if not a number of larger pieces. A direct hit on the moon\nwill still cause a similar-sized piece of lunar debris to detach itself and continue along\nthe same path. Depending on events in “The Celestial Ball,” another hitherto\nunnoticed meteoric body can swoop in, “out of nowhere,” and shatter Typhon. The\nUmbral causes for this will be described forthwith. The difference between such\nmarginal victories and total failure will be described in the final section.\nTHE CELESTIAL BALL: THE DANCE\nCharacters searching for Diana or Mother Earth eventually find themselves at the top\nof a great plateau via rough-hewn steps that wind around the base of the mesa. The plateau\nsurface is even larger than it appeared from below, lit by an immense orb of burning yellow.\nThe whirling lights are also huge, spherical and impossibly distant, occupying places around\nthe perimeter. As they spin, each presents a roughly humanoid face or figure that may seem\nfamiliar to the mages. A veritable sea of smaller man-sized figures mills about the surface,\ndrifting and swaying in time to strange unearthly music and booming spirit-voices.\nThe characters must immediately join the dance, either through their own\nvolition or by being swept up in the press of bodies. Those who do not keep up with\nthe swirling movement around them risk getting trampled. Characters who choose\nto participate will find that they actually have quite a bit of freedom of movement\ndue to the scale and complexity of the overall dance, as partners and teams come\ntogether, exchange places and part. Learning the steps of each different dance\n(Physical Challenge against eight Traits; retest Performance) means that the mages\ncan interact socially with the other planetary dancers, and thus understand a little\nof the intentions and thoughts of the planetary entities themselves.\nUltimately, there is nothing to be done. This plot was hatched eons ago — for the\nplanets could see thousands of years in advance what road humanity was taking — and\nits momentum is nigh unstoppable. Furthermore, Mother Earth subconsciously desires\nthis union. She has secretly renounced her favorite children, ungrateful mankind, and\nwishes to be rid of them. Even Diana’s feelings could change if anyone reminds her that\nshe owes her own existence to a primordial impact. While successful participation in\nthe Celestial Ball can offer the characters a brief glimmer of hope, in the final\nsummation, the asteroid’s path cannot be changed.\nCATACLYSM\nIf one of the plans for saving the world enjoys overwhelming success, or if the\ncharacters can convince various Awakened factions to put aside their hostilities in time\nto coordinate their efforts, the Storyteller may judge that Earth escapes with only a few\nminor impacts and environmental upheaval that stabilizes within a generation or two.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n145\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F F F F FOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nHumans and other large animals could thus avoid extinction, even decimation. “The\nEarth Will Shake” might then serve as a prelude or subplot for a different kind of\nApocalypse described elsewhere in this book or of the Storyteller’s own devising. But this\nis a story about the end of the world, so consideration must be given to what happens.\nPortraying a cataclysm of this nature inevitably requires the storytelling team\nto call upon the Mind’s Eye. Simpler than a special effects extravaganza, however,\nis to focus on what each of the characters, or groups of characters, is doing in the final\nmoments. Those on Earth might be huddled in shelters, wrapped in magical shields,\nhoping devastation will pass them by. Others face tsunami, casting vulgar magics in\na desperate bid to stem the tide. Still more might be out searching for family and\nfriends, wishing to be with their loved ones at the last.\nThe physical impact of Typhon, while spectacular, is simply background\nmaterial. Typhon is the cause of the end of the world, perhaps most simply\nrepresented by turning out the lights, but Typhon isn’t the focus of the story — the\ncharacters are. Playing out each character’s end scenes as cut scenes or mass scenes,\nas need be, allows poignant exposition, shattered dreams, desperate measures, pure\npanic, calm resignation or enlightened escape (among others) to dominate the mood\nof the chronicle in its final hours.\nEPILOGUE: THE UMBRAL EXODUS\nWhen worlds collide on the material plane, the safest place is undoubtedly the\nUmbra. This is not to say that physical changes have no consequence in the lands\nof spirit, however. A mage in the Penumbra might experience a major global impact\nonly as a distant blast of light and heat followed by a slow rolling quake. Nearing the\nSpirit Wilds, the resulting storms, earthquakes and other geophysical effects may be\nfelt with the same deadly intensity as they are in the physical world, but they can be\navoided by those who know the ways of the Wilds.\nThe chaotic energies of global disasters strengthen the Spirit Wilds and erode the\nGauntlet in places where the world has grown more dynamic. Every individual death swells\nthe borders of the Dark Umbra, and it stands to reason that an extinction-level event could\nforce a sudden fusion of the three Umbrae. Regardless of the specific interpretation the\nStoryteller might decide on, the fact remains that, while characters in the Umbra might\nbe safe from some of the immediate effects of the disaster, aside from the perils that might\narise in the spirit realm, their home and just about everyone they ever knew or cared about\nis gone. Forever. Let that fact sink in, and watch how the characters respond.\nStorytellers of a chronicle in which most or all of the characters choose this\noption may decide to continue the chronicle as the characters seek out a new home\nworld to inhabit (or perhaps return to Earth to search for survivors), or they may\nsimply allow the refugees a few hours to put the disaster into context before fading\nto black on such somber meditations.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n146\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n147\nCHAPTER FIVE\nCHAPTER FIVE:\nENDLESS\nWINTER\nCHAPTER FIVE:\nENDLESS\nWINTER\n147\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER F\n F F\n F FIVE\nIVE\nIVE\nIVE\nIVE\nTHE END OF ALL DREAMS\nEndless Winter\nFor millennia, the fae have whispered of this terrible time, when Glamour is\nsnuffed out, Banality triumphs and the Dreaming itself dies. Even darker versions speak\nof the Fomorians rising to usher in a hellish new age of shadow and tyranny, where these\nelder monsters rule fae and mortal alike with absolute power and cruelty. Legends\nabout this terrible apocalypse — and, some insist, the Spring that must follow it —\nfigure prominently in the histories of all kiths, cut across all geographic boundaries and\neven unite Seelie and Unseelie alike in speculation, supposition and dread.\nOf course, even thinking about the Endless Winter and what it might entail doesn’t\nreally prepare any of the fae for what truly lies in store. As consumed as they are with\nunraveling ancient prophecies and deciphering cryptic metaphors, even the most astute\nfae scholars fail to see the actual signs of the coming disaster unfold around them.\nBuilding up to your personal End-Time scenario properly is critical to its\nsuccess. It’s no fun if the motley wakes up one morning, and gosh darn it, the\nFomorians have risen and laid waste to Concordia. No matter what kind of direction\nyou ultimately want your chronicle to take, none of it will seem as real or dramatic\nunless it is contrasted to the “ordinary” lives the characters knew before events began\ntumbling toward the inevitable end.\nTherefore, take some time to consider how both worlds came to be in such dire\nstraits, how you intend to express these final days to your players and what you think\nwill be left standing when all the drama and fireworks have faded.\nWHY IS THIS HAPPENING?\nIt might seem elementary, but take a moment to think about why Winter is\ncoming. Forget notions of “canon” if you like — what has brought about Winter in\nyour timeline? Is it something that naturally happens when the Dreaming is\nendangered? It could be that Winter is a natural defense mechanism of dreams. The\nDreaming goes into a self-imposed hibernation, and it takes this time to heal its many\nCHAPTER FIVE:\nENDLESS\nWINTER\nCHAPTER FIVE:\nENDLESS\nWINTER\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n148\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nwounds and grow significantly stronger. Then, when it is ready, all it takes is one\namazing achievement to bring the power of dreams back into the world. But is this\ntrue? Is Winter nothing more than a natural cycle, or is it something that was brought\nupon the world by a few poor decisions?\nOr might the real cause of Winter’s arrival be something closer to home for the fae?\nAfter all, it’s entirely possible that the fae allowed this to happen. While they were busy\narguing among themselves and waging petty wars of title and honor during their “golden\nage,” the mortals they once guided and inspired eventually adapted to life apart from the\nfae. Instead of fickle fae lords, they put their faith in the science they could rely on to\nproduce tangible results each time. Over time, mortals became less afraid of the dark than\nthey once were, but also less likely to imagine the fantastic out there as well. Faced with\nalien and often cruel or patronizing faerie nobles, they chose to trade wonder for security.\nUnable to count on the old ways, they learned that dreams are expendable.\nBlaming science and reason is too simple a scapegoat for this kind of scenario,\nhowever, for nockers and other inventive fae know well the Glamour that science\ncan hold. Laying blame thus avoids the responsibility that the Kithain bear for their\nhubris of ages past. Rather, changelings in such a scenario have no other choice but\nto recognize their folly and attempt to convince humanity otherwise, either en masse\nor one humble mortal at a time.\nAnother potential reason for the coming of Winter is an imbalance in the\nnature of the Kithain and their society. Perhaps Winter is coming because the two\ncourts no longer honor the natural balance between light and dark. The Seelie will\nnot give up their power at Samhain, and the Unseelie go too far in their efforts to\nreclaim what they feel is theirs. This struggle creates an imbalance in the Dreaming.\nEventually, such as imbalance becomes too much for the Dreaming to sustain,\ncausing it to automatically “reset” itself to remedy the situation.\nA final option is that perhaps the changelings are not meant to be on Earth any\nlonger after all. Arcadia is their home, but they insisted on inhabiting the human world\nrather than staying where they belonged. This makes them invaders, and it is possible\nthat the Dreaming did not intend for them to exist so long outside its borders. Perhaps\nthe changelings themselves caused the problems simply by leaving Arcadia, thereby\nfracturing the Dreaming and making it increasingly vulnerable. This option is\nexplored in more detail in the “Starlight Exodus” scenario found later in this chapter.\nAny of these options could be incorporated into your chronicle, and they can\nbe used with the scenarios provided as well as with plots of your own making. Of\ncourse, if you decided that the end of the world was brought on by the assassination\nof High King David, then it would be most logical to say that the end of the world\nwas brought on by the fae themselves, rather than blaming it on humans. Overall,\ndeciding on a reason for the end of the world can only strengthen your understanding\nof your chronicle and therefore improve the results overall.\nWHERE IS IT TAKING US?\nSo now that you’ve seen a number of possible causes for the arrival of Endless\nWinter in your game, there comes an equally important question: Is everything really\ncoming apart at the seams? Is it still possible for the world to pull through, whole or\nin part? Will the approach of Endless Winter be something that leaves no Kithain\nor mortal unchanged, or will it be something that only a small portion of the\npopulation is even aware of when it’s over?\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n149\nCHAPTER FIVE\nThese might seem like odd questions to raise when one is discussing the end of\nthe world, but it’s important not to get hung up on preconceived notions of what that\nmust mean for your world and your game. Even the scenarios offered in this chapter\naren’t written in stone. There’s a great deal of space to alter, expand, combine and\notherwise interpret them to suit the ending you want your chronicle to have. While\nnot everything can be laid out in advance — players have a wonderful way of\nthrowing even the best-laid plans for a loop at strange times — you should definitely\nhave an idea of where you see the overall setting going as the end runs its course.\nWill the end mean Long Winter for the fae but leave humanity largely\nuntouched? Do the characters have a chance to help bring about a bright new\nSpring? Will the Dreaming collapse, leaving the fae stranded on Earth and slowly\nstarving for lack of Glamour? Do horrific battles between fae and mortal ravage the\nglobe after the Mists fall and the Dreaming is exposed? Even if you intend to make\nit possible for the characters to escape the worst of your particular scenario — such\nas finding a defensible ever-flowing Glamour spring they can shelter around to wait\nout the Long Winter — you must still decide what will happen to the rest of the\nworld. Take your time and make sure you have a clear idea of what you want to see\ncoming, and most of all, think of ways to bring home these great changes as vividly\nand powerfully as possible.\nRemember also that simply because you know the end is coming, that doesn’t\nmean the characters have any idea of what lies in store for them. Armageddon has\nbeen “just around the corner” for millennia, as seen in countless apocalyptic panics\nthroughout history and more recently with the hysteria surrounding the turn of the\nmillennium. While events will eventually reach a point where even the most jaded\nand cynical Kithain must admit what’s going on, that still doesn’t mean your ending\nwill be an open book. Even the most knowledgeable fae scholars still have no idea\nwhat the end will actually look like when it comes. All they can do is read the ancient\nprophecies, look at the signs they see around them and take their best guess.\nTHE STATE OF THE DREAMING\nPerhaps the most important underlying factor in determining the severity and\ndirection of your game’s End-Time scenario is deciding on what kind of shape the\nDreaming is in while it happens. Although the Dreaming is generally presented as slowly\nwithering away, its contact with the Autumn world fading more with each passing day,\nyou do not have to use this model for your own chronicle.\nA Dying Dream\nThe more traditional outlook, this direction supposes that the Dreaming is\nfading, its powers weakening and its children grower ever closer to extinction.\nBanality weighs ever more heavily on the Kithain and their chimerical world, and\nthe approach of Winter is all but assured. Shunned and dismissed by a world that no\nlonger needs them, the fae quietly waste away from the sickness caused by the\ngreatest indignity their proud race could ever endure: being utterly irrelevant.\nThis direction is excellent for showcasing scenarios where the chimerical world\nreceives its final judgment mostly or entirely away from the eyes of mortals and\nProdigals alike. It is also suited to bittersweet tales of loss and separation, as the\nessence of what makes the fae truly wonderful gradually diminishes, perhaps\nallowing the characters one final moment of lucidity before their identities as\nchildren of the Dreaming are snuffed out forever… or perhaps not.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n150\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nOf course, the idea of Glamour fading away doesn’t necessarily mean that the\nDreaming itself is entirely destroyed. While many Kithain assume that the loss of\nGlamour on Earth would trigger the destruction of the Dreaming, nothing says that\nhas to be true. Even if you subscribe to the belief that humans forged the fae from their\nown primal dreams, that doesn’t mean their creations can’t have acquired a life of\ntheir own in the meantime, which might, in turn, enable them to survive the\nrejection of their “parents.” Perhaps Glamour does fade away from the Autumn\nWorld forever but continues to exist beyond the boundaries of its Banal confines,\nforcing the fae to flee into the Dreaming or face extinction.\nA Blaze of Glory\nBy contrast, the Dreaming in this direction refuses to lie down quietly in the face\nof Banality. While it might not undo the damage done by the Shattering, the fae\nexperience a surge of power as Glamour makes a final effort to remain a vital and\npotent force in the world. It might be enough to stir human belief in the fantastic\nonce more, staving off Winter or perhaps even bringing on a new Spring, particularly\nif the Kithain take advantage of the opportunity in time. Even if it is ultimately a\ndoomed expression of power, the results still mark the world in ways that the long-\nsuffering fae would have been hard pressed to imagine in days before the end.\nFae caught in the middle of such a chronicle might believe that a new Spring is\nindeed already at hand, though even if that is your ultimate goal, it is also best to show\nthe players that this newfound power alone will not carry the world to a new age. After\nall, if it was that simple to shake off Winter, the Dreaming could have done it long ago.\nWhile it might make it easier in some ways to achieve their goals, even a ready supply\nof Glamour doesn’t ensure that the fae can guide the Autumn World back to belief in\nchimerical reality. The hardest challenges must still be overcome by the fae themselves.\nNaturally enough, sudden surges of Glamour carry their own potential dangers\nas well. Aside from the wild and unpredictable changes that are inherent to any\npowerful exposure to Glamour, the mortal world is still unprepared to deal with the\nincursion of chimerical reality, and it might strike back harshly if the fae aren’t\ncareful. While this direction presupposes a certain amount of “shielding” against the\nforce of Banality due to the presence of such raw Glamour, having the Mists fall or\nchimerical world suddenly overlap with mundane reality is bound to elicit responses\nof fear and hostility as well as wonder and amazement.\nTHE FINAL SEASON\nWhen dealing with The Shining Host’s mythos, you have an additional\nadvantage to End-Time scenarios as well. Unlike many of their Prodigal cousins, even\nthose fae obsessed with the idea of the end of the world often can’t agree on what shape\nthis end will take or even if it will ultimately be such a bad thing. Vampires fear their\ncannibalistic elders and werewolves arm for their war to end all wars, but very few\nlegends detail exactly what the fae can expect surrounding their End Times.\nAlthough a Winter virtually bereft of Glamour remains the most popular\ntheory, especially considering the amount of Banality already found in the world,\neven that is far from the only belief. For every few doomsayers predicting an Endless\nWinter devoid of all Glamour, there is one equally determined sage who believes a\nnew Spring of renewed connection to the Dreaming must necessarily lie ahead.\nUnderstanding what these seasons mean to the fae and possible outcomes based\non either Winter or Spring coming to pass is essential for presenting an end scenario\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n151\nCHAPTER FIVE\nthat has the proper feel of Kithain legend. While the fae might not be aware of exactly\nwhere they stand until all is said and done, they should be able to look back and realize\nthat the seasons have changed once more… even if only because they are the last fae\nwho will ever make note of that distinction.\nWHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?\nAfter settling the basic questions regarding the state of the Dreaming and the\ncoming season, it’s only natural to look to what the players can do about the fate you\nhave designed for their world. Remember that even though you might hold the\ntrump card in terms of plot devices and designs, it is still your responsibility as the\nStoryteller to make sure that the players are entertained by the ending you have in\nstore for them. There’s no reason you can’t have a tragic ending to your story, for\nexample, but if you do, make sure that the characters have a chance to make their\npeace with the world before the end. Or the opposite could be true, where they do\nnot successfully reach their personal goals but manage somehow to save the world.\nAlthough they will likely become world-renowned heroes, can they be content\nwithout being personally fulfilled?\nThat said, the scenarios included in this chapter should give you some ideas for\nways to make sure characters’ actions count in all manner of End-Time scenarios,\nfrom globe-spanning wars to local tales of hope and heartbreak. There’s no scenario\nin which a creative Storyteller can’t find some way to involve the characters in an\nimportant fashion, and if you can’t find a way to make it work for your players, why\nare you doing it in the first place?\nIn short, the answer to the question of what the characters can accomplish should\nalways boil down to “something important.” Whether that something means preventing\nthe end altogether, or just getting the time to say a special good-bye to loved ones before\nit hits, is just a question of detail once that truth is understood. It’s their chronicle as much\nas or more than yours, after all. Make sure the players feel as though they can make their\nmark as it ends, even if their characters won’t necessarily be around to see it.\nDIFFERENT SEASONS\nWinter\nLong Winter — A dark and terrible time when the fae will largely vanish\nand Glamour will be all but extinguished. A new Spring will eventually follow.\nEndless Winter — A world where the fae die out, Glamour fades away and\nthe Dreaming is cut off forever. The mortal world endures in diminished form.\nFimbulwinter — The ultimate destruction of both the Dreaming and the\nAutumn World, snuffing out all life and Glamour forever. Also used to refer to\nthe world if the Fomorians or other dark beings rise to claim it as their own.\nSpring\nMortal Spring — Regardless of the final fate of the Kithain (exodus,\ndestruction, etc.), humanity eventually enters a new era of creativity.\nFae Spring — Mortal society remains trapped in Banality, but the fae experience\na new surge of Glamour, perhaps by leaving the Autumn World, finally making peace\nbetween their dual natures or otherwise undergoing some great change.\nUniversal Spring — Fae and humanity alike enter a new Golden Age,\nhealing the rift between the Autumn World and the Dreaming.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n152\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nWHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?\nOf course, unless there’s no hope for any of the characters to survive what lies\nahead, there’s the inevitable question of what comes after. What are the possibilities\nin terms of the future of the changeling race? Can they survive, and if so, how? Can\nyour chronicle continue even though Winter has arrived? What would the charac-\nters be doing during such a chronicle?\nIf Winter is avoided, then it might be easy to assume that the fae should have\nit easy. It is important to note what happened to avert the coming of Winter,\nhowever. Did the Unseelie seize control of the fae courts from the Seelie in an effort\nto restore the balance? If so, will they relinquish control at Beltaine as they should,\nor will they take this opportunity to repay the Seelie for years of oppression? (It\nshould be noted that, if they attempt the latter, it is only be a matter of time before\nthis whole process repeats itself.)\nWere the changelings forced to seek shelter in the Dreaming, or did they have\nto reestablish ties with mortals in order to weather the storm? Did High King David\nreturn, and if so, is he in any shape to rule? Even if Winter does not come, the\npossibility certainly should have frightened the changelings into paying more\nattention, and if they don’t make some changes in the way things work, they\ncertainly won’t make it very far.\nIf Winter is averted, then there is clearly room for a chronicle to continue in the new\n(and hopefully improved) world. Perhaps the characters could help to implement reforms\nin freeholds throughout the realm or work more closely with mortals in an effort to maintain\nmortal-changeling relations. If Winter comes, the situation is entirely different.\nA chronicle might conceivably continue during the Long Winter, but this is only\nadvisable if you plan to have Spring come afterward. After all, your players want to have\nsomething to work for, and it would be rather discouraging to struggle through the\nWinter only to have the entire group die of old age and simple frustration without ever\nseeing the Spring. The first question to ask is whether the changelings are aware of\nwhat’s happening to them. Perhaps they are forced to retreat into their mortal seemings\nto survive, and their fae seemings reawaken at the coming of Spring as if from a long\nhibernation. Or perhaps they remain fully aware of the happenings around them and\nhave to seek shelter in their freeholds, the only places where a little Glamour is still\navailable for the taking. These chronicles could involve long, drawn-out sieges where\nthe fae attempt to hold on for years against an onslaught of monsters outside their\ndoors. Icewyrms roam the skies and Autumn People attempt to batter down their walls,\nbut the fae hold firm, waiting (and praying) for the coming of the Spring.\nOMENS AND PORTENTS\nIt is not necessary to include any or all of these factors as part of a build-up to unleashing\nhorror on your players, but you may find them useful to help set up an important plot point\nor underscore the drastic changes at work in the world. For convenience, they have been\nroughly divided along the lines of relatively minor or inconsequential phenomena, more\nserious incidents and at last the most dramatic and obvious signs that the end is here.\nFORESHADOWING: THUNDER IN THE NIGHT\nEven in the most direct and overtly disastrous scenarios involving Endless\nWinter and the final fate of the Kithain, there should still be a time of quiet buildup,\nwhere small signs and sweeping omens combine to paint a picture of what is to come\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n153\nCHAPTER FIVE\n— and how it will make itself known. Think of this phase as the bad dream a\ncharacter has the night before the events of the End Times really begin to unfold.\nIt’s that moment of hesitation before entering the darkest heart of the forest, when\nsomething just isn’t right, yet there’s no choice but to go onward.\nThe Red Star\nIn the summer of 1999, a new astrological phenomena appeared in the heavens,\nvisible only to the fae and their Prodigal cousins — a glaring red star. Soon dubbed the\nEye of Balor by the fae, its crimson light inspires dread and apprehension in all who gaze\nupon it. Its morbid fascination is made no less gripping by the fact that the star’s light\nis rumored to grow brighter during times of war, disaster and other periods of suffering.\nExactly what does the appearance of the Eye of Balor signify? While certain\nscenarios have a specific purpose for it in mind, generally speaking you have\ncomplete control over what its presence signifies in your chronicle. It could be an\nomen of doom, or it could be a sign of the return of the Tuatha de Danaan. The fact\nthat it gives the Kithain an ominous feeling doesn’t necessarily mean it has evil\nconnotations. After all, any period of great change is bound to inspire a certain\namount of unease, even if the ultimate result is positive. The best use for the Eye of\nBalor is reinforcing the atmosphere you’re looking for in your scenario. After all, few\nthings are as effective in establishing mood as seeing an astrological omen glaring\ndown at the characters from the heavens both day and night.\nDreams Deferred\nAt first it might seem a fairly humble concept next to some of the more dramatic\nsigns of Winter’s approach, but never forget that grave threats and disturbances to\nthe Dreaming are reflected on the sleep cycles the world over. And not just the\nKithain are affected either. Prodigals and mortals alike suffer as well when the\nDreaming is thrown out of balance, though they might not easily guess the cause of\ntheir distress. In scenarios where the Dreaming is dying or retreating from the\nAutumn World, it becomes harder to get restful sleep, and the resulting epidemic of\ninsomnia and related conditions adds to the ever-increasing sense of desperation\nthat haunts the world in its final days. Aside from difficulty in recovering Glamour,\nall living beings go mad if denied sleep for too long, after all, and that can add a frantic\nand semi-hallucinatory edge to games where sleep is ever harder to come by.\nConversely, some Dreamers and other inspired individuals start sleeping more\nand find it harder to awaken as the Dreaming slides into disarray — almost as though\nthe Dreaming is pulling for every last ounce of Glamour that it can get. Or perhaps\nit is granting its favored children a bit of mercy as it all comes crashing down.\nErrant Trods\nAs the Dreaming sickens and writhes, trods once familiar and reliable become\nincreasingly unstable and dangerous. Those fae with a grasp of Dream Craft find their talents\nstrained to the limit, and those without that rare and valuable Art are essentially at the mercy\nof the Dreaming as to where they wind up, regardless of where the trod usually leads. While\nthe Silver Path remains as inviolate as ever, travelers of the Dreaming increasingly find even\nthis road almost completely obscured by the surrounding terrain, as though the land itself\nwas actively seeking to lead them astray. At other times, it appears to fragment into hundreds\nof apparently identical paths, daring wayfarers to make the wrong choice and be swallowed\nby the Dreaming. Perhaps worst of all, fae sometimes believe they are following the Silver\nPath correctly, only to find themselves on a Black Path to the Underworld, a Green Path\nto a former Fomorian stronghold or some other twisted and ill-used route.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n154\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nProphecy Fails\nThis simple yet highly effective hair-raising technique involves the utter and\nabsolute failure of all attempts at divining the future, whether through use of the\nSoothsay Art, scrying treasures or any other means, including the prophetic talents\nof gifted mortals or Prodigals as well. All attempts to see the future automatically fail,\nregardless of the talent of the caster or the power of the treasure. Such attempts reveal\nnothing but blackness, as though the future is totally obscured… or that there is no\nfuture whatsoever. (Of course, if the Storyteller desires a particular image or series\nof images to be central to her particular End-Time scenario, she may simply choose\nto use these visions and no others as a means of foreshadowing.) Repeated attempts\nmight even damage the sanity of the observer, as she tries to comprehend a mystery\nthat no single mind was meant to understand.\nIMMINENT CHANGE: THE RISING STORM\nThese phenomena are clearly out of the ordinary, even for beings as used to the\nstrange and unusual as the Kithain. What’s more, no few of them have gone from\nmerely curious or slightly disturbing to outright dangerous for the unwary, and they can\ncause serious problems for those changelings caught in their path. Mortal society also\nbegins to change more noticeably, though still not to the extent of faerie society. At\nthis point, even the most obstinate or skeptical fae must admit that something is going\non. The paranoid and superstitious are likely to be nearly beside themselves with fright.\nTabloid Life\nAt this stage, humanity has definitely begun to notice that something is going on\nand even consciously begun the first approaches to confronting the truth of the matter.\nAccordingly, life begins to take on an slightly surreal or tabloid quality for many\nmortals, as even the more reputable news outlets begin showcasing an increasing\nnumber of stories about “UFO sightings,” “Bigfoot stories,” “alien abductions” and so\non. Devout mortals begin hearing more talk of miracles and visions throughout their\ncongregations, as well as an increasingly urgent amount of speculation about whether\nthis means that Judgment Day is indeed at hand. Even more skeptical mortals find\nthemselves becoming increasingly interested in talk of the End Times, as though their\nsubconscious minds are aware of something they can’t consciously admit.\nNor are fantastic reports limited to the nightly news or the ranks of the faithful.\nScientists around the world puzzle over such strange phenomena as bizarre atmo-\nspheric patterns, odd wildlife behavior and rising trends of mental illness and\ninstability apparently without any connecting cause. Likewise, a rise of missing\nchildren, runaways, school violence and gang fights begin as more Kithain are\nconvinced of what is really happening and become active in their local politics,\nthinly veiled behind such mundane concerns.\nWhile the vast majority of these stories are filtered through the Mists and the\nminds of the humans who witnessed them, particularly clever or insightful Kithain\nmight be able to piece together what actually happened to inspire such reports. Some\nglimpse the larger forces at work by studying enough of these tales.\nCantrips in Flux\nAs the Dreaming destabilizes, cantrips become increasingly unpredictable as\nwell. The fading contact with the Dreaming makes even the most potent invoca-\ntions little more than shadows of their former power. Bunks become more numerous\nand demanding to perform, while bestowing less power than ever, and at the most\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n155\nCHAPTER FIVE\nextreme end, cantrips begin costing additional Glamour Traits even if the caster\nfulfills the usual requirements. Areas of high Banality become “dead magic” zones,\nwhere cantrips become difficult or outright impossible to perform. Worse still,\nAutumn People and other highly Banal souls receive the same protection, making\nthem nigh-unassailable with the tools of Glamour.\nConversely, unpredictable surges of Glamour might wind up generating results\nreminiscent of the mythic past, to the surprise and perhaps even the regret of the\ncaster. A pooka attempting to use Quicksilver to avoid a pursuing gang of redcaps\nmight find himself caught in his accelerated state for hours or even days. This state\nwreaks havoc on his metabolism and makes it impossible to perform delicate tasks\nor even interact with the normal world without incurring heavy doses of Banality in\nthe process. Likewise, a sidhe attempting to command one of her retinue with\nSovereign might find she has quashed all of his free will, leaving a near-mindless\nautomaton who exists only to obey her.\nShallowings\nPrelude to the weakening of the Mists themselves, fae find themselves confronted\nby an increasing number of “shallowings,” incidents where the Autumn World and the\nDreaming briefly overlap, often without warning. Although these incidents begin in\nmore remote areas, they quickly spread to include even the most heavily urbanized\nareas, causing a corresponding amount of the panic for denizens of both worlds.\nIndeed, these incidents are exceedingly dangerous for both sides, as creatures\nnative to the Dreaming find themselves confronted by levels of Banality they are\nunable to withstand, while mortals and even the occasional Prodigal find themselves\ntrapped in a world beyond their imagination, without any way to get home again. (To\nsay nothing of the problems caused by a manticore appearing in Central Park, or a\ngroup of children becoming lost in a Nightmare Realm.) Without Kithain or other\ncapable beings around to sort out the problem and find some way to return these\n“accidental tourists” to their realm of origin, most do not survive long in their new\nworld, making it a problem of particular urgency in its implications.\nJUDGMENT HAS COME: THE STORM BREAKS\nAt this level, there is no mistaking what is taking place. Even the most naïve fae\nknow at a glance that great changes are underway, and while not every fae believes in\nthe tales of Endless Winter, even the skeptical have begun to question their convic-\ntions as these powerful events sweep across the land. At this stage, even mortal society\nis noticeably different, with apocalyptic panics, religious fervor and rising crime all\nevident as the situation with the Dreaming becomes increasingly dire.\nThe Death of the New\nNever forget that while they might be most directly influenced by the gradual\ndeparture of Glamour in its raw form, the fae are not the only population that suffers\nwhen the energy of creativity begins to drain away from the world. With the\nwithdrawal of the Dreaming’s presence, the spark that drives the creation of true art\nis fast fading from the world. It might seem easy to dismiss this on the surface — what\nreal harm can come of a few frustrated artists? — but this loss of a sense of anything\ninnovative and new goes beyond the realm of just the arts.\nAs the connection to the Dreaming begins to fade, the ability of humanity to devise\nanything original goes with it, from fine arts to architecture to military tactics or even\ncriminal enterprise. Even individuals without much creative inclination of their own\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n156\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nsuffer from this phenomena, as they rely just as surely on the creations of others to help\nthem experience emotional catharsis. And without any outlets to help express pent-up\nemotions and ideas, feelings of frustration and anger begin to rise to alarming levels as the\nlack of originality becomes evident. Violent crimes such as rape, murder and assault begin\nspiraling out of control, and the suicide rate leaps to double or even triple the average as\nhopeless souls give in to their own despair in the face of this bleak world.\nMortals at this stage are near panic constantly, and mob violence is frighteningly\ncommon. The more paranoid or sensitive among them know exactly what is going on, and\neven the skeptical are aware that something Is Not Right, even if they can’t put a finger on\nit. Kithain and Prodigals alike must tread carefully, as even the kindest and most understand-\ning mortals are subtly on edge. Those who are already inclined to do so have no compunction\nwhatsoever about shedding blood or destroying property to get what they want.\nThe Mists in Flux\nAlthough the Mists are always something of a mixed blessing to the Kithain,\nclouding memories even as they shield the fae from the eyes of mortals, even this\nseemingly changeless factor begins to become increasingly unpredictable as the\nDreaming destabilizes. In some instances, the Mists begin to fail outright, leaving\nshocked fae suddenly exposed to the mortal world, their fae miens clearly visible to\nall who look on them and their cantrips as obvious as an amateur stage magician’s\ntricks. Even worse, without the Mists to shield the beautiful and fragile world of the\nDreaming, such naked exposure to the Autumn World is typically accompanied by\ncrippling doses of Banality as well. Such unlucky fae must quickly seek shelter from\nthe unforgiving eyes of the public until the Mists return to normal… if they ever do.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, some fae find the Mists growing too strong,\nessentially causing such changelings to be ignored by the mortals around them or\neven cutting them off from the mortal world entirely. Helpless fae find themselves\nwalking the streets alone, unable to make the world recognize them in the slightest.\nTheir most direct attempts to gain notice result only in a sudden rush of Banality as\nthey push aside the Mists and reveal themselves in their true forms. Even then, as\nsoon as the changeling leaves the immediate area, the Mists slide back as thick as\never, making establishing lasting contact impossible during the fluctuation.\nTroubles with the Mists become worse as time goes by. The periods when they\nfall or strengthen grow longer, until at last they dissolve forever and leave the\nKithain exposed to their worst enemy… or envelop the fae in their suffocating\nembrace until they are entirely forgotten by the mortal world.\nThe Tithed Ones\nNo good deed goes unpunished, so they say, and every bargain with the Devil will\none day see him call it due. While the commoner kiths long ago adopted the\nChangeling Way in order to hide from Banality in mortal flesh, the recent return of\nthe sidhe was much more abrupt — and according to some hushed whispers, much\nmore insidious as well. For when the sidhe return, they do not forge a human disguise,\nbut rather occupy a mortal body outright. While the effects are superficially similar\n(amnesia, struggle with Banality, etc.), the fact remains that the vast majority of sidhe\nare not the original owners of the bodies they inhabit. Of course, the nobles insist that\nthis is an agreement reached willingly, most often going on to suggest that the human\nsoul is ushered to the paradise of Arcadia in exchange for the use of their body.\nThe recent appearance of the foul and disturbing entities known as the Tithed\nOnes, however, would seem to suggest that a far darker exchange takes place.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n157\nCHAPTER FIVE\nAt first, their attacks are little more than rumors and apparently coincidental\nhappenings, easily mistaken for “ordinary” assassinations or vicious chimera attacks.\nSurviving nobles report harrowing encounters with utterly silent, black-clad attackers\nwielding weapons of burning ice, their faces disguised save for burning, hateful eyes.\nThese strange beings flow like shadows around most attacks, making them madden-\ningly elusive targets, yet when grappled they demonstrate the strength of a full-grown\ntroll, easily tossing aside most foes or cleaving through heavy armor with a single stroke\nof their weapons. They focus their efforts entirely on eliminating one particular sidhe,\nthough they slay those who interfere without hesitation if necessary.\nEventually, the terrible secret comes to light — these assailants are none other\nthan the souls of those whose bodies the sidhe claimed, their faces twisted into hideous\nmasks of hatred and their minds consumed with thoughts of vengeance. They claim\nthat the sidhe did not bargain with them, but rather cast their spirits into the darkest\nrecesses of the Dreaming in their haste to return to the mortal world, stranding them\nin a hellish existence until they were at last rescued. They do not reveal the identity\nof their “benefactors,” save that they provided the means to return to the world and\nthe power to take revenge on those who wronged them. Those skeptical of their\nidentity find that the so-called Tithed Ones, as they refer to themselves, possess\nintimate knowledge of their former bodies and lives, to a degree that defies refutation.\nOf course, it is possible that these beings are little more than clever doppelgangers\ncreated by enemies of the Kithain (perhaps even the Fomorians themselves) in order\nto sow confusion and fear amid the ranks of the fae at a critical moment. Or perhaps\nthe truth is somewhere in between, with some sidhe having made this devil’s bargain\nwhile others are targeted unfairly. Regardless of what the ultimate truth might be,\nthe Tithed Ones gather in ever-greater numbers, eager for a chance to strike down\nthe rulers of the Kithain. Despite the hopes of such like-minded groups as the Urban\nRenewal League, however, the Tithed Ones refuse to play politics or make alle-\ngiances. They have their targets, and that is all that matters to them anymore.\nA CROWN OF SHADOWS\nMany Kithain who are determined to prevent (or at least better predict) the end\nlose themselves in ancient texts or explorations of long-forgotten mystic realms. They\nare convinced that Winter can be prevented if they can only learn the right moldy\nincantations or find some ancient treasure that has the power to ward off Winter’s chill.\nIt hasn’t occurred to any of them that Winter might just be invited in.\nFollowing his orchestration of High King David’s disappearance and the\nensuing civil war, King Meilge has employed his network of spies, agitators and\nassassins to fan the flames of war and weaken his opposition in the process, using his\nward, the heartbroken High Queen Faerilyth, to shield himself from scrutiny.\nOnce the war has dragged on to the point of numbing atrocity and the fae of Concordia\nhave grown tired of bloodshed, he uses his cunning Arts to convince Faerilyth to make such\na demonstration of love and devotion that none can contest her claim or the peaceful\nalternative it provides. After Faerilyth rides this wave of approval back to Tara-Nar, Meilge\ncarefully insinuates himself into the new regime, then springs the final and most dangerous\nphase of his plan: the return of David… and the murder of Faerilyth at David’s hands.\nFollowing the subsequent defeat of the fallen High King at the hands of a\nsinister champion, Meilge tearfully steps forward to assume the crown in honor of his\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n158\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nfallen ward — and the Shadow Court owns the throne of Concordia, ensuring the\narrival of the Long Winter at last.\nBUILDUP\nIn contrast to some of the more overt and spectacular End-Time stories, the\nascension of Meilge to the throne of the High King is a much more subdued, secretive\nscenario. A mastermind in every way, Meilge has carefully planned the entire series\nof events down to the smallest detail. In addition to the standard ability to swing a\nsword and cast a cantrip, characters need sharp investigative skills, polished\nespionage talents and most of all the ability to survive in the cutthroat world of high-\nlevel fae politics if they have any hope of stopping Meilge’s plan in time.\nTherefore, Storytellers interested in building up to the events of this scenario\nshouldn’t overlook the Kithain rumor mill. If the characters don’t already suspect\nMeilge or Faerilyth of some wrongdoing at the outset of this scenario, it’s important\nto begin pointing them in that direction. Providing them with some background\nmaterial on the major players in the scenario, as well as some increasingly disturbing\nclues as to Meilge’s nefarious nature, is vital in building up the proper atmosphere\nof paranoia and mystery this scenario relies on.\nOf course, this is not to say that some of the more supernatural buildup elements\ndiscussed in the previous section can’t come into play as well, acting as increasingly\nurgent reminders of the onset of Winter or just to give the players a taste of what is to\ncome. The Red Star, Dreams Deferred, Prophecy Fails and Tabloid Life are all relatively\nsubtle yet excellent ways of conveying a sense of a world where something just isn’t quite\nright. The fact that the source of the unease isn’t easily deciphered is excellent for\nillustrating and elaborating on the layers of deception inherent in the scenario.\nASCENSION BY ATTRITION\nThe opening act of this scenario takes place following a particularly bloody and\nbitter series of battles during the current Concordian civil war. Should war not yet\nhave begun during your chronicle, it is possible to achieve the necessary sense of war-\nweariness relatively quickly, simply by having the simmering tensions erupt into a\nrapid series of extremely gory battles and/or a number of heinous atrocities. (Most\ncarefully orchestrated by Meilge to foster just such an outraged desire for peace,\nnaturally.) Chronicles already embroiled in the war can simply include such\nincidents as part of the ongoing story, with a minimum of interruption.\nShould the civil war already have come to a conclusion in your chronicle and\nsomeone other than Faerilyth have ascended the throne, it is still possible to stage\nthe early events of this scenario. Simply replace peace talks with a similar form of\npublic meeting, and much of Faerilyth’s arguments will still carry the requisite\namount of weight to achieve the desired result. Of course, should Faerilyth have\nalready ascended the throne in your timeline, the beginning might be unnecessary.\nNote carefully, though, that certain events must still take place in order to make sure\nthat the proper climax is reached later on.\nTHE WILLOW’S TEARS\nMeilge’s most overt plans begin at a peace council ostensibly called for by\nFaerilyth on behalf of her weary troops. Few arrive expecting anything\nstraightforward from one of the Eiluned, but they walk away from the concord\nspreading news across the land of an amazing development. Experienced\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n159\nCHAPTER FIVE\ncharacters might be invited to attend the council themselves, but even those\nnot present that night soon hear of the remarkable events.\nAfter a customary amount of bickering about various military points of order\nand whatnot, Faerilyth arises from her place at the table, tears streaming down her\nbeautiful face as she looks on the abruptly hushed and expectant crowd. In a clear,\nringing voice marked only by discordant notes of sorrow, she says:\n“My husband’s greatest dream was to see his kingdom grown from the land of division\nand malice he saw as a child into a true home for all Kithain, where they might live happily\ntogether and prosper as true children of the Dreaming. He cared not for his crown, but for\nthe Kithain whose strength truly supported it, noble and common. And yet here we are,\nkilling each other over who may lay claim to a soulless piece of metal. I say enough. This\nbloodshed ends tonight. For one final time I assert my title as rightful High Queen of\nConcordia, not that I might further my own glory, but that I might finish building the dream\nmy husband began. So I swear, upon the soul of the Dreaming itself…”\nAs her speech concludes, Caliburn abruptly appears from thin air on the table\nbefore her. With shaking hands, Faerilyth lifts her husband’s blade, and to the\nastonishment of all, it accepts her. Combined with her impassioned rhetoric, it is\nenough to sway even the most cynical fae present, and soon messengers ride across\nConcordia bringing tidings of peace and rumors of the High Queen’s ascension.\nWhile doubts remain in the hearts of some, the return of Caliburn and its acceptance\nof Faerilyth quashes the vast majority of opposition. Several weeks later, a clearly\nmoved Queen Mab allows Faerilyth and her entourage to enter the palace at Tara-\nNar, and the era of a new, fully recognized High Queen begins.\nIndeed, all would be well, save for one small detail. Attentive characters present\nat the council or those with sharp-eyed contacts notice that Meilge, while apparently\nas compassionate and concerned as ever, radiates an almost imperceptible glow of some\nstrange Glamour at several points, particularly immediately before the reappearance\nof Caliburn. It was there and gone in a flash, but for that split second Meilge’s façade\nfailed and a most sinister smile became visible. Combined with some of the rumors that\nthe fae have certainly heard by this point regarding his dishonest character, this should\nbe enough to send the characters on the beginning of their search for the truth.\nThe reason for Meilge’s concentration is simple. Having had little luck with\npast efforts to confuse the mighty sword by simply ordering a drugged and beaten\nDavid to abdicate his throne, Meilge recently switched tracks and tried a different\ntactic. He allowed David to come out of his drug-induced stupor almost entirely,\nthen had David’s brutal handlers confront him with the imminent fact of his demise\nwhile simultaneously reminding him of his love for his wife.\nThe result was predictable enough for a Gwydion. Believing final death was at\nhand, David willingly passed his claim to the throne on to Faerilyth, this time in his\nright mind. The handlers then callously dispatched David’s chimerical form and\nreturned him to his iron cage. True to the High King’s word, this time spoken in his\nright mind, Caliburn was bound to obey and transfer ownership to his wife. The\npulses of Glamour visible during the council resulted from the use of the strange\ntreasures Meilge quietly employs to keep track of David and his handlers, timing the\noperation to achieve the most public and dramatic result possible. It was a near-total\nsuccess, with none save the characters or their contact the wiser.\nAnd what of the revelation of his wicked smile, even through his magical mask,\nwhich supposedly blocks all but the image Meilge intends to project? Perhaps\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n160\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nCaliburn isn’t quite so fooled as it pretends to be… or perhaps some evils are too great\neven for such a potent treasure to disguise.\nNOW FOR WRATH\nFollowing the end of the civil war and Faerilyth’s official installment as the new\nHigh Queen of Concordia, life begins to return to an approximation of normal.\nWhile minor outbreaks of rebellion still linger in some areas, the Kithain largely\nconsider the evidence sufficient to prove Faerilyth’s claim to the throne is legitimate.\nMeanwhile, Meilge moves into the palace as well, continuing his role as\n“mentor” to his young ward, while steadily making sure that his own agents and\nsympathizers staff the palace. He also takes pains to see that the public always sees\nher actions in the most positive possible light, while likewise occasionally slipping\nhis name into the background of such stories as well, always in an equally positive\nlight. Most tellingly, he quietly convinces Faerilyth to sign an agreement that states\nthat should sudden death or incapacitation befall her, Meilge will assume the mantle\nof the High King. Rattled by her husband’s disappearance and seeking only to\nprevent future suffering, Faerilyth does not quite realize what she has agreed to,\nwhich is exactly what Meilge intended, of course. Although he is ready to launch the\nmost dangerous phase of his plan at this point, Meilge takes his time, carefully\nsolidifying public opinion of Faerilyth as kind and virtuous, while likewise establish-\ning himself as a trustworthy and doting advisor. Fortunately, this hesitation also\ngives those fae who are investigating the conspiracy ample time to begin sniffing out\nsome real clues as to the nature of the wrongdoing at work.\nBLOOD SHED IN ANGER\nWhen he at last feels the time is right and his reputation secure enough, Meilge\nsignals his agents to perform their most dangerous duty. Having carefully overseen\nDavid’s gradual recovery from his earlier trauma and conditioned him to accept\ncertain beliefs, Meilge’s men have at last managed to break David to their will and\nconvinced him that his wife betrayed him in order to steal his throne. Just to be\ncertain of achieving the results they desire (for they know well the price of failing\nMeilge), the handlers implant several strong Chicanery cantrips in David as well,\nensuring that his emotions and senses follow the plan they’ve laid out for him.\nSo prepared, they set David free not far from Tara-Nar, carefully wiping all memory\nof his treatment from his mind and replacing it with an overriding desire to punish Faerilyth\nfor her “crimes” against him. They also take time to cover their tracks both magically and\nby mundane means before disappearing once more. It is in this state of mind that David\nsweeps into the palace, sending servants fleeing before his burning gaze until he reaches the\nmain audience chamber with terrified guards and courtiers trailing impotently behind him.\nRaw Glamour radiating from his every gesture, David approaches the throne as the\nassembled nobles watch in shocked awe and silence. His loud and nearly unintelligible\nranting echoes off the high stone walls. At first joyous, Faerilyth grows increasingly wary\nas he approaches, her cries of love drowned out by his infuriated rambling.\nEventually the gist of what he is saying becomes clear. David accuses his bride\nof seducing him, of bewitching him so that he would love her and of having him\ncruelly kidnapped and tortured when he discovered her ruse and sought to remove\nher from power. The diatribe continues until the two are nearly nose to nose,\nFaerilyth silent and unflinching, David livid with rage, the combined Sovereign of\nboth of them locking all onlookers helplessly in place. For a long moment, the two\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n161\nCHAPTER FIVE\nstand opposite each other, barely moving, and then Faerilyth says something so\nquietly that even the sluagh cannot make it out. David’s eyes widen, then narrow to\ndangerous slits, and he shakes his head in response.\nFaerilyth’s last words follow, tears running down her cheeks even as her voice remains\nfirm and regal. “Is there nothing then that I can say, husband, to make you believe me?”\n“You know our gifts are useless against the Eiluned,” David hisses, punctuating\nthose words with a sudden stab to the chest, the blade drawn so quickly it is little more\nthan a blur. Faerilyth slumps to the ground, human seeming mortally wounded, her\neyes never leaving her husband even past her death. At this time, Meilge steps forward\nand issues an immediate challenge to mortal death, to avenge his fallen kin — a\nchallenge that David accepts, hurling more invectives at his wife’s uncle even as he\ncleans her blood from his blade.\nThough a skilled duelist, Meilge cites their difference in age and appoints a\nchampion to fight in his stead, his new captain of the guard, the fearsome warrior\nLord Bayard Tyrael ap Eiluned. Despite holding the clear upper hand for most of the\nduel, David’s guard falters for a critical second, allowing Lord Tyrael to at last slip\na vicious thrust through and pierce David’s heart in one swift stroke. Several\nonlookers later attribute the success of this blow to a sudden hesitation on David’s\npart, a look of sorrow and confusion as though he had suddenly awakened from a\nterrible nightmare… but Meilge’s own rumormongers quickly quash such rumors.\nHolding Faerilyth’s body in his arms, Meilge tearfully announces that according to\nher own wishes, it is now his sad duty to assume the crown he had hoped she would wear\nfor many years to come, and carry on her work. So saying, he slips the bloodied crown\nfrom her head and places it on his own, then raises Caliburn to the heavens in salute…\nand the approach of Winter quickens its pace.\nNOW FOR RUIN\nNews of the transfer of power sends shock waves throughout Concordia. If the\ncharacters were not present at the palace when the fateful confrontation took place,\nthey quickly hear the details from friends or contacts at court, including the telling\nslip in David’s demeanor right before the fatal blow. By now the characters should\nhave uncovered at least enough circumstantial evidence of Meilge’s complicity in\nDavid’s disappearance, and they will have little trouble concluding that David’s\nsudden reappearance and violent outburst could only have been another part of the\nking’s schemes. Unfortunately, with Meilge’s ascension, they will need to accumu-\nlate enough damning evidence to accuse no less than the High King himself of\nmurder, kidnapping and torture — not to mention survive long enough to see such\naccusations carry any weight once they bring them to light.\nFortunately, the characters are not alone in their quest to topple the new High\nKing. Indeed, some rather unlikely allies will now appear to help them on their quest.\nWhile having David reappear and slay his wife in front of so many witnesses did a\ngreat deal to generate sympathy for Meilge and deflect questions about his rise to\npower, a number of Kithain across Concordia can’t help feeling that something\nterrible has just happened right under their noses. While the characters and their\nallies will have to work delicately and very carefully to avoid alerting Meilge’s\nubiquitous spy network of their activities, especially as his control over the kingdom\ntightens, there might yet be time to depose this foul usurper king and restore\nConcordia to its rightful state. Perhaps there is even time to turn back the approach\nof the Winter Meilge so callously welcomes.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n162\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nOver the coming months and years (as long as it takes for the characters to build\ntheir case), Meilge expertly balances two roles. His public face of a grieving monarch\ntrying to hold his kingdom together against the growing threat of Winter, contrasts his\nprivate identity as a Shadow Court mastermind employing his Thallain allies and foul\nProdigal collaborators to ensure that Winter’s icy touch spreads slowly but surely across\nthe kingdom. Like all expert tyrants, Meilge builds his network of control slowly,\ncouching all tightening of restrictions or removal of freedoms in rhetoric about the\ndemand for increased “security measures” or the need for “uniformity of opinion”\nregarding the state of the kingdom. Most often it is a simple enough matter to send some\nof his own Shadow Court or Prodigal minions to stir up trouble or leave evidence of\nanother sign of Winter approaching. His royal agents then appear to “solve” the problem,\nfurther ingratiating him to the masses and making sure that his tightening grip is\nperceived as justified concern for his subjects in this increasingly dangerous world.\nWhile he once envisioned a simple bloodbath against the commoners he\ndespises, the immediacy of Winter’s arrival combined with his own dark intellect\nhave caused him to formulate an even more terrible plan for the Kithain. Meilge’s\nultimate goal now is to gradually usher in a kind of “controlled Winter,” where the\nfae depend on him and his fellow Shadow Courtiers for their very survival in the face\nof overwhelming fear and Banality. By using the Court’s connections to bring ever\nmore Thallain and other dark kith into the world to hasten the arrival of Winter —\nas well as claiming and hoarding precious Glamour resources in the name of\n“Concordian security” — Meilge hopes to eventually place the fae at his mercy.\nIt is an ugly cycle. The more Winter begins to manifest, the more frightened and\ndependent the Kithain become on him to aid them, giving him more power to summon\nmore of the very beings responsible for the season’s coming in the first place. Rather\nthan stave off the coming season of sorrow, Meilge hopes to turn it to his advantage,\nthus ensuring that none will be strong enough to challenge him. As for the rest of the\nworld… well, once Winter is well underway, perhaps they too shall fall in line.\nAfter all, Meilge is a patient man.\nHOW DID IT COME TO THIS?\nSince preventing Meilge’s schemes is extremely unlikely save for the most\ncapable and fast-moving motley, the question then becomes what can be done after\nthe unthinkable has occurred and Meilge ascends to the throne. Once Meilge is firmly\nin power, the task of deposing him becomes increasingly difficult, as leads turn cold,\nclues vanish and important witnesses fall victim to Banality (or more sinister ends).\nYet the failure to dethrone Meilge leads to a horrible consequence: a nightmarish\nWinter where the Shadow Court rules and Glamour is controlled by those in power,\nforcing the fae to live in servitude or face the denial of the very essence their souls require\nto survive. Should Meilge be victorious, Glamour gradually becomes ever rarer and more\nfrequently hoarded by the nobility for the “greater good,” while signs of Winter increase\nand the mortal world slides deeper than ever before into Banality. By the time the Kithain\nas a whole realize the trap they’ve wandered into, it is far too late to do much about it.\nWith the Shadow Court and their dark allies behind him, Meilge is nigh unstoppable,\na tyrant beyond all imagining for the new season at hand. Characters might form an\nunderground movement of sabotage and espionage, but it will take a great deal to turn\nthe world back to the way it was before, if it’s even possible at that point.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n163\nCHAPTER FIVE\nSimply killing Meilge outright is unsatisfactory. Aside from the difficulties of\nreaching such an august personage with a lethal attack, Meilge’s cronies will still be\ninsinuated throughout the halls of power, and his successor would be just as likely\nto fall prey to their poisonous machinations. At the very least, even if it did achieve\nsome positive result, the characters would be branded assassins and traitors, without\nthe evidence to back up their claims of Meilge’s sinister scheming. And if they have\nsuch evidence, why didn’t they try using it first?\nAssuming Meilge can be removed and a just successor appointed with a minimum\nof additional bloodshed, the fae still face a long and difficult road. Already Meilge and\nthe rest of the Shadow Court have done much to advance the approach of Winter, and\neven once he is removed from power that damage won’t go away overnight. Therefore,\nStorytellers have several options for the direction of their chronicles after Meilge has\nbeen removed. They can continue the tone of politics and intrigue dealing with the\nevents surrounding the ascension of the next High King or Queen, or they can shift\nto present more of a unified front in the face of oncoming Winter.\nA PORTRAIT OF THE NEW KING\nAlthough more complete descriptions for Meilge and many of the other\nluminaries involved in this scenario appear elsewhere, most notably in Nobles: The\nShining Host, Noblesse Oblige and Kingdom of Willows, a brief description of\nMeilge is included here for ease of reference. Storytellers are highly encouraged to\nresearch the other individuals involved in the web of intrigue as well as design their\nown unique personas to offer possible story hooks and draw the players deeper into\nthe intrigue at the heart of this scenario.\nKing Meilge ap Eiluned — While Meilge’s schemes and motives are discussed at\nlength, it is important to remember three things: First, Meilge’s mask is a treasure that\nallows him to lie with absolute sincerity, even when magically interrogated, and it\ncauses others to naturally view his actions in the best possible light (one reason he so\noften desires an audience). Second, as High King and a high-ranking Shadow Court\nmember, Meilge has legions of followers he can call on for all manner of tasks, and\nindeed he prefers to use as many intermediaries as possible in order to make tracing\nactions back to him exceedingly difficult. Third, those who confront him directly find\nhim a skilled duelist as well as a masterful magician. While he prefers not to dirty his\nown hands, he is more than capable of defending himself quite capably should the need\narise. He is a consummate mastermind, and he never makes a move without carefully\nconsidering what it entails, or how to escape should it go awry.\nGODS AND MONSTERS\nFor time out of mind, the fae have fallen between the cracks of the World of\nDarkness. Even since the adoption of the Changeling Way and the mingling of fae souls\nwith mortal flesh, the world of the Kithain has remained a distant dream from the human\nlands, the immortal games of the fae seldom but lightly stirring a slumbering world.\nAs some had hoped, the promise of a new Spring is indeed possible on the\nhorizon… but it will be reached only by cutting a bloody swath through the ranks\nof the Fomorians themselves. To fail is to doom the entire world to Endless Winter.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n164\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nBLOOD ON THE WIND\nMore so than perhaps any other scenario presented in this chapter, this is a truly\nepic finale. This is a series of events that sees the mortal world and the Dreaming\ninescapably intertwined, with the primordial forces that shaped them waging bloody\nwar in front of a shocked and disbelieving world. Many fae feared that they would\nultimately fade away quietly to nothingness, but it seems that the Dreaming and its\nmost ancient children have other plans. Players in this scenario should feel as though\nthey are rapidly drawn into a series of ever-greater events, ultimately leading up to\nbattles that shake the very foundations of the chimerical world and mortal realm alike.\nIt might sound odd to say that such a powerful and world-spanning scenario\nrequires a great deal of attention to little details in order execute it successfully, but it\nis true nonetheless. Without first establishing a clear sense of rhythms of the characters’\nordinary lives as well as the early tremors that signal the approach of these earth-\nshaking events, players won’t feel the change nearly as profoundly as they should when\nthings start elevating to a more epic scale. Watching elder glomes awaken the Rocky\nMountains and commanding them to rise up and do battle with a nightmarish black\nserpent the size of a hurricane is impressive, sure, but if it’s the first thing the characters\nsee as they roll out of bed one morning, it loses a lot of the impact it might have had\nif they had known of the sleeping Inanimae or their dragon opponent beforehand.\nThat much being said, several of the buildup elements presented in the previous\nsection are useful for this scenario, particularly the Red Star, Dreams Deferred,\nCantrips in Flux and Shallowings. In addition, the Tithed Ones add some particu-\nlarly fearsome and nasty foes to the ranks of the Fomorians and their dread allies.\nIndeed, a brilliant flare of the Eye of Balor is the herald of the fall of the Mists\nand the beginning of the Transformation. By this time, however, the fae should have\na feeling that something immense and powerful is about to rear its head. The only\nquestion is which side it will be on.\nTHE MARCH OF THUNDER\nAlthough omens, rumors and other odd prophetic occurrences have certainly\nalerted the fae to the fact that something of immense magnitude is about to occur,\nnothing can really prepare the Kithain for the true opening act of this scenario: the fall\nof the Mists and the re-assertion of the Dreaming across the face of the Autumn World.\nThis series of changes is known as the Transformation, and it happens nearly without\nwarning, sweeping the Autumn World before it and leaving little unchanged in its wake.\nThis beginning is not subtle. Around the world, regardless of the time of day or\nnight, fae find their attention drawn to the heavens, watching in horror and\nfascination as the Eye of Balor grows to triple its previous size, its fearsome red light\ndominating the sky. All who watch are struck with a growing sense of dread and\nwonder, as well as a feeling of their Glamour stirring within them, almost like it was\nbeing brought to a boil. This feeling grows stronger with each passing hour until\nevery fae feels as though his nerve endings are on fire with anticipation.\nSix hours pass while the fae wait in fear and wonder, and then the unbelievable\nbegins. Without warning, a tremendous wave of Glamour bursts from the depths of the\nDreaming and flows across the globe, infusing the chimerical world with tremendous\nvitality and filling changelings to bursting with the energy of ancient dreams. Inanimate\nchimera that have been slowly fading or falling apart appear totally pristine once more,\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n165\nCHAPTER FIVE\nand chimerical creatures appear in the prime of health, reveling in their renewed vitality.\nActive trods open wide and remain gaping without any need to maintain them with\nGlamour. Even ancient trods swing ajar, revealing worlds not seen since the time before\nthe Shattering. Balefires flare into barely contained columns of energy, healing all those\nfae around them of even the oldest and most chronic conditions.\nTHE TRANSFORMATION\nEven as the fae are still staggering from this infusion of energy, the world itself\nbegins to change around them. To the eyes of the changelings, it appears as though they\nare seeing both of the worlds they dwell in at once, but it quickly becomes evident that\nmuch more powerful forces are at work. The chimerical world and the mortal realm are\nnot merely overlapping but actively merging, with the chimerical side clearly taking\nprecedence in all but the most Banal locations. Towering castles replace suburban\nhouses, city streets shift into fantastic fairy-tale avenues, and the most legendary\nfeatures of the mortal realm mix with the fantastic landscape of the chimerical world\nuntil a strangely perfect combination is reached. This is the world as it might have\nbeen, had the Sundering never occurred and fae lived in open harmony with mortals.\nHumanity is allowed one small grace period through this change. Although\nthey cannot withstand the sheer assault of Glamour that heralds the approach of the\nOld Ones and the merging of the worlds, the Mists perform one last act of mercy for\ntheir creators. When the Transformation begins, every human around the world\nimmediately falls into a deep slumber for one full week. Those in dangerous\nsituations — flying planes, skydiving, driving cars, etc. — head to a place of safety\nas quickly as possible and then fall asleep there (unless it would be more in keeping\nwith the Storyteller’s view of the end for the chips to fall where they may). Nothing\nshort of violence will wake these mortals once sleep has begun, and even then they\nremain awake only long enough to defend themselves before falling senseless again.\nThey react to anything they see while awake as a particularly vivid dream or a\nPREPARING FOR THE MARCH OF THUNDER\nIt is a vital duty for the Storyteller to make sure that even through all the wild\nchanges brought about by the Transformation, the players still feel as though they\nhave a grasp of what’s going on and how their characters would relate to it. Visual\naids provide a great means of conveying a sense of what has happened to the world\nin general. With some searching, a clever Storyteller can find any number of\nsurreal paintings, bizarre photographs and dreamlike video clips that show players\nthe kind of mythic-modern mixture that their characters now see all around them.\nWhile chimerical reality has likely always looked at least a little like this to the\ncharacters, having them look at some new sources and telling them that this is\nnow what mundane reality looks like can really bring the change home, not to\nmention adding some excellent mood and ambiance.\nOf course, don’t stint on describing how the specific local environment\nchanges either. Aside from obvious points such as any local freeholds and glens,\nmake sure the rest of the important local buildings, parks and landmarks are covered\nso that the characters know what has changed and how much. You don’t want to\nhave play come grinding to a halt because the players assumed the elementary\nschool had transformed into the fairy tale castle it used to be in chimerical reality,\nwhen you had planned for it to turn into a flying Arabian palace instead.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n166\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nnightmare, and they absolutely refuse to believe otherwise regardless of the means\nused to try to convince them otherwise. No gift of science or trick of magic will\nprevent this sleep from overtaking a mortal once the Transformation begins.\nWhile it might seem a curse at the time, in truth it is really a blessing — the Mists\nare trying to give humanity time to at least subconsciously come to terms with what\nhas happened before everyone awakens to this new reality. Kinain are immune to\nthis slumber, and indeed thanks to the Augmen they approach the power of full-\nfledged Kithain in many ways. Prodigals with the Kinain or Faerie Affinity Merit are\nlikewise exempt from the enforced slumber, though they receive no other benefit.\nSave for those rare exceptions, however, the rest of the Prodigals are as helpless as\nthe mortals are to resist this slumber.\nAlong with the Transformation and the fall of the Mists comes a potent\nstrengthening of their faerie natures, identical to the first stage of the Augmen.\nGlamour becomes readily available as well, replenishing at a rate of one Trait per hour,\nand can be harvested even more quickly at freeholds and in the presence of Dreamers\nonce mortals begin to reawaken. Bunks are no longer strictly required to perform\ncantrips. As there is essentially no longer any distinction between the chimerical and\nthe Wyrd, all cantrips are considered Wyrd but cost no additional Glamour. Oaths\nsworn on the Dreaming carry more weight than ever. Not only do the consequences\nof violating them grow more severe, but those fae sworn to them feel almost compelled\nto obey them. Taking actions that go against the spirit of an oath requires a Willpower\nTrait per scene, and actively breaking an oath requires two Willpower Traits.\nOtherwise the fae is unable to muster the resolve to go ahead with such a heinous act.\nLastly, as the sleeping ancients of the chimerical awaken and the Kithain find\nthemselves stronger than they have been in centuries, Banality fades overnight to a\nnearly impotent force. The Transformation has essentially suspended Banality for the\ntime being, as the world is simply too fantastic for such utter disbelief to carry any true\nweight. The one exception to this weakening of Banality is cold iron, the fearsome\nproperties of which actually increase. Ordinary fae suffer twice the normal penalties\nassociated with its presence and do not willingly carry it without spending a Willpower\nTrait per scene to stay near the hated metal. Even iron-resistant fae such as House Balor\nsidhe and those rare individuals with the Merit: Iron Tolerance find it harder to be\naround the substance than normal. While they suffer no actual penalties to do so, they\nfind the experience distinctly unpleasant and avoid it if at all possible.\nHUE AND CRY\nWhile humanity yet slumbers and the Kithain struggle to regain their footing in this\nstrange new world, the real forces involved in the war begin to make their appearance.\nPOSSIBLE TWIST: WHAT DREAMS MAY COME\nStorytellers who are looking for an interesting variation on this scenario may\neven rule that mortals and affected Prodigals do not awaken until after the war is\nover, possibly even until after the last traces of the Transformation have faded (if\nthey do at all). While this choice significantly alters the course of the scenario in\nterms of humanity accepting the existence of the fae and their role in the world,\nit might be just the thing to highlight a particularly bittersweet ending concerning\nthe fading importance of the fae or the forgotten debt that humanity owes the\nKithain. It can simply avoid the complications caused by their waking.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n167\nCHAPTER FIVE\nWhile the actual beings that the characters see depend to a certain degree on their\nlocation, the arrivals should be impressive to behold no matter where they are. While the\nfollowing list is far from the limit of the available possibilities, it should serve to give an\nidea of the scale of the forces that begin appearing in the wake of the Transformation (not\nto mention the images associated with this rising). Ancient Inanimae cause entire forests\nor rivers to rise up and form bizarre armies. The Nunnehi Nations march, surrounded by\nthe spirits of fallen braves returned from the Higher Hunting Grounds. Hordes of fuath\nand fir-bolgs pour fully armed and ready from ancient trods and assembling into warrior\ncamps. This activity is not limited to just the Kithain and their cousins either. Legendary\nchimerical beasts emerge from their ancient hiding places and patrol their old territories\nonce more, reveling in their freedom.\nAs the ancient powers and hidden forces of the fae emerge, so too do the Kithain\nfind themselves almost irresistibly rallying. While the previous factional lines are not\nimmediately forgotten, the strange energies of the Transformation combined with the\nnatural need for some feeling of safety and solidarity in the face of such sweeping changes\nacts as a powerful inducement to bring Kithain together around the world. Naturally,\nsuch gatherings also quickly become hotbeds of discussion about exactly what is going\non, what it means and what must be done because of it. While different theories are\nrapidly bandied about, most such groups quickly come to the conclusion that some\nmassive conflict or other spectacular event cannot be far away, and preparations begin\naccordingly. Even relatively solitary fae or isolated oathcircles feel the call to join such\ngatherings. Those who don’t choose to participate still see the threads of Kithain society\nTRANSFORMATION AND THE AUGMEN\nAll fae are enhanced by the Transformation, in ways both dramatic and subtle.\nStorytellers should apply the following mechanics once the Transformation begins:\n• Any Traits received from one’s Birthrights, Frailties or sidhe House are\ndoubled. (Thus, a boggan receives the additional Traits: Empathetic and Gullible,\nand a wilder troll receives extra Brawny and Stalwart Traits as well as an another\nhealth level.) This benefit can take a character over his normal Trait maximums.\n• Kithain receive a free retest on any non-combat challenges involving\nAbilities they receive from a Birthright or House. (Therefore, nockers receive a\nfree retest on all Crafts or Repair tests.) Those who receive combat Abilities from\none of these sources receive an extra level of each of those Abilities instead, even\nif it takes them over the normal maximum of five Ability levels.\n• Improvements on “non-mechanical” Birthrights or House Boons such as an\neshu’s Spirit Pathways or goblin Mayhem are left to the Storyteller to adjudicate,\nbut roughly speaking, they function twice as well as normal and/or produce twice\nthe normal result. This boost applies to a changeling’s darker aspects as well.\nFrailties or House Flaws without strict game mechanics are likewise roughly twice\nas debilitating or inconvenient during the Transformation.\n• Kinain who are “promoted” to full Kithain by the Transformation should\nfollow the guidelines from the “Joining the Family” sidebar in The Shining Host\nPlayers Guide, pages 140-141. At the Storyteller’s discretion, characters with the\nMerit: Faerie Affinity may likewise become regular Kinain at this time, though\nthey receive no other immediate benefit. Prodigals are never changed into full\nKithain of any kind, nor can they ever have Glamour, Arts or Realms.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n168\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nweaving tighter together, for better or worse. Some areas see fae dividing along lines of\ncourt, while others see nightmare fae such as sluagh and redcaps coming together under\none banner while more “benign” kith gather under another.\nOf course, this is far from a coincidental effect of the Transformation, as most\nlearned Kithain readily suspect. The fae are indeed being called together in\npreparation for the impending conflict, though whether it is by the wiles of the\nFomorians, the dreamlike urgings of the Tuatha or simply the Dreaming itself\ndepends on the Storyteller’s desires. Yet more discerning fae note that the gathering\narmies are not divided by seeming, kith, house or even Court. Indeed, even those\nwho would otherwise have met as enemies in times not long past join under one\nbanner without question, and old friends might find themselves bitterly opposed as\nthey join different alliances. Ultimately, unknown to the Kithain at large, the\ndividing line lies deep within the hearts of the fae. They must choose whether they\nwill stand on the side of the Tuatha and honor their ancient allegiances or align on\nthe side of the Fomorians and Endless Winter.\nThis period of division and shifting alliances lasts as long as the Storyteller desires,\nthough it should remain relatively brief in order to help maintain the atmosphere of fear\nand not just seem like another political power play on the part of the Kithain. Fae should\nhave just long enough to realize roughly what’s going on and perhaps align themselves\nwith a suitable group (if that is their wish), perhaps learn of how widespread this\nphenomena is or even engage an opposing group in a skirmish or two. They should not\nhave so long that they begin to grow impatient or drift apart. At that point, it’s time for\nthe real battles to begin and the true forces at work to make themselves known.\nENTER THE DRAGONS\nAny number of things might herald the arrival of the Fomorians in the world:\nsudden ice storms, rampant fear and madness through the local mortal population,\nunnatural animal activity, hordes of vermin and insects, et cetera. Regardless of what\nthe fae happen to witness, anyone with even a drop of faerie blood in his veins\ninstinctively knows the truth: The Fomorians have returned, and they have come\nto claim this world for themselves. Almost simultaneously, battle is joined across the\nglobe, as the armies of those loyal to these returning evils lunge for the forces\ndedicated to the ancient pacts with the Tuatha, seeking to wipe them from the world.\nCaught in the middle, humans fight both sides as best they can, though even they\nstill find themselves generally fighting on the side that they would choose if the\nchoice were given them.\nActual presentation of these primordial beings depends on the Storyteller’s\ndesires. Some Storytellers prefer to have the Fomorians felt as little more than a\nmalignpresencewatching over the conflict, occasionally manifesting through omens\nor bursts of unpredictable magic, while others wish to have them wade through the\nbattles alongside their troops, dealing devastation to all in their path. For the most\npart, however, this scenario assumes that Fomorians do not actually take to the field,\nespecially those beyond the rank of the White Court. Even in such an epic scenario,\nthe higher orders of the Fomorians are too immensely powerful to fairly pit against\nany Kithain forces. There is simply no way even an augmented Kithain army should\nbe able to slay them without grossly downplaying their power level and thus robbing\nthe scenario of a lot of its inherent drama. Truly dedicated and powerful fae could\nslow one down, maybe even injure it, but short of acquiring the Triumph Casque of\nSorrows, that is about all they can hope to inflict against these terrible foes.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n169\nCHAPTER FIVE\nRegardless of whether the Fomorians are directly present, the course of this\nscenario from this point on is relatively straightforward: all-out war between the\nKithain and the Fomorian armies, with mortals and perhaps some Prodigals thrown\nin on either side. How long the war takes and how detailed the war planning becomes\nis left to the tastes of the Storytellers and players to determine.\nThis is it, so don’t be afraid to pull out all the stops in describing the fantastic\nnature of the combats, the mighty magics being used or the sacrifices being made on\neither side. Whether it’s a prolonged war or a swift series of brutal and frightening\nbattles, the players should know at every turn that the stakes have never been higher\n— but neither has the chance for true heroes to emerge.\nPOSSIBLE OUTCOMES\nAlthough Storytellers are encouraged to allow their own battles to run their course\nnaturally, several likely outcomes to the war deserve special mention for Storytellers\nlooking to plan the path their conflict will take. Even if they choose to use a combination\nof elements from these outcomes or their own original ending, they might find the ideas\nand possibilities discussed here useful in crafting their own unique ending.\nFomorians Triumphant\nConsider this the ultimate worst-case scenario. Should the Fomorians gain\ncontrol of the Triumph Casque of Sorrows and employ it successfully on the\nbattlefield, there is very little chance of stopping them no matter what forces are\nthrown against them. The world takes on a completely nightmarish caste, and while\nsome Glamour survives the resulting Endless Winter, it is only the agonized\ndelusions of those poor souls forced to live under the reign of these terrible overlords.\nTuatha Victorious\nThough it is possible that the Tuatha do not actually show their faces during the\nconflict, the Kithain know very well who they are fighting for. Should the fae prove\nthemselves worthy through such determination and sacrifice, the Tuatha bestow\nupon them the gift of the Triumph Casque of Sorrows at their darkest hour. Victory\ncomes, albeit at high cost.\nMutual Annihilation\nWith all the heavy hitters out on the battlefield, it’s entirely possible that both\nsides wipe each other out to the last, especially if the war drags on long enough that\nhumanity gets to employ its remaining weapons of mass destruction as well. Having\nthe Fomorians and the Tuatha slay each other (presumably setting up others to take\nWHAT ABOUT THE TUATHA?\nDoubtless readers will have noticed that the Tuatha de Danaan have yet to\nappear as directly as their Fomorian counterparts. This is no oversight. While\nStorytellers may choose to have these ancient beings appear and do battle along\nwith everyone else, generally speaking this does far too much to overshadow the role\nof the Kithain, as a single Tuatha can easily accomplish what might take an entire\narmy of fae to do. This is not to say that they are not watching and perhaps even\nsubtly aiding their descendants. Bringing them too much to the forefront, however\n(except possibly for a mutual annihilation outcome), virtually ensures the Kithain’s\ntaking a backseat to the larger-than-life magic and heroics of the Tuatha. And if\nthere’s one thing the players should feel, it’s that their actions are making a real\ndifference, whether they’re saving the world or just saving their own hometown.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n170\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\ntheir place) is a wonderful way to underscore just how vicious but ultimately\npointless their ancient feud is. In their haste to undo each other, they wind up losing\ntheir own lives in the process. Perhaps some Kithain survive to survey the resulting\ndevastation, even rebuild from the ashes, or perhaps the characters are among the\nlast to succumb as the fae are utterly consumed in the final conflagration.\nTACKLING A WAR OF THE GODS\nThis section covers several important angles to examine when running a\nscenario of such epic nature. While the outline offered here is certainly sufficient to\ncome up with an engaging scenario, these topics offer a number of ways to add even\nmore layers of depth and complexity to the chronicle. They also handle some\ncommon problems or concerns that arise in a scenario of this nature.\nHomefront or Front Lines?\nBefore the Transformation even begins, the most immediate question you must\nask yourself as a Storyteller is what kind of scope you intend to portray with this\nscenario. Will it be sweeping and epic or local and personal? Obviously, this scenario\nnaturally lends itself to epic battles and mighty confrontations, but that doesn’t\nmean that it’s a requirement either. Some players enjoy things on a smaller scale, and\nthere’s nothing wrong with that. Indeed, Storytellers can find a wealth of dramatic\nmaterial in stories centered around an oathcircle simply trying to defend its\nhometown during this time of crisis, which can make an interesting contrast to the\nworld-spanning events happening outside of the group’s small corner of the world.\nAllies and Enemies\nWhile other scenarios focus on a select few characters and their actions during\nthe End Times, the sweeping nature of this scenario means that the cast of characters\nis limited only by the needs of the Storyteller and the particular chronicle. Like it\nor not, no fae on Earth or in the Dreaming realms beyond are spared from this final\nconflagration. The only question is whether they choose to charge to the vanguard\nor stay behind and try to protect what is left of what they once cherished.\nNaturally enough, the very inclusive nature of this scenario makes it possible for\nStorytellers to involve any or all of the prominent canonical characters they’d like, placing\nthem on either side of the war as suits the personality in question and the needs of the story.\nSettling an account with a particularly hated enemy or rushing to side with an old friend\nor mentor are both excellent ways of drawing the players into the larger conflict without\nmaking it feel as though they’re being led around by their noses. Likewise, the desire to join\nforces with particularly authoritative or well-respected canonical characters can be a\npowerful rallying point to help the players’ characters find a place in the growing armies.\nTriumph Casque of Sorrows\nThis legendary artifact is likely to prove a turning point of the war, for whichever side\nfinds it first. Should the Fomorians obtain it, the Kithain have little chance to survive;\nshould the Kithain locate it and figure out how to use it, even the Fomorians can fall before\nthem. A small group of experienced adventurers (namely, the troupe’s characters) might\nbe recruited to search the world or the Dreaming in hopes of finding this fearsome weapon,\nparticularly if the odds begin to turn against the Kithain. They might also be tasked with\nintercepting a similar expeditionary force sent by the enemy before it can return with the\nCasque. Needless to say, should they learn of the plan, the Fomorian forces will stop at\nnothing to prevent the group from obtaining the Casque, which in itself should present\nenough danger to keep the group running scared for quite some time.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n171\nCHAPTER FIVE\nAFTERMATH\nFirst and foremost, following the last battles of the war, the Transformation\nbegins to reverse itself, particularly if the scenario involves the death of both of the\nancient races. While things do not completely return to the way they were before the\nwar, the chimerical world and mundane reality separate once again, accompanied\nby the rise of the Mists to separate the two. Faeries slip back into their mortal\nseemings, once again hidden from the world.\nThis process is not entirely successful at wiping the minds of humanity,\nhowever. Quite simply, too much has happened for humans to slide blindly back into\nignorance. And so for the first time in thousands of years, mortals are intimately and\nundeniably aware of the existence of the fae, although what they do with this\nknowledge, of course, depends on the outcome of the war. Should humanity\nsomehow be alerted to the threat of the Fomorians and fight alongside the fae against\nthem, victory might bring a glowing new Spring of cooperation between mortals and\nthe Kithain. A devastating loss is likely to incur nothing but bitterness against all\ncreatures of the Dreaming.\nPICK YOUR POISON\nCertainly, the Dreaming isn’t as strong as it was in the old days, or so the grumps\noften say. As science rose in prominence among the mortals, interest in simple\ncreativity and the power of dreams has slowly gone on the wane. Art and music have\nbeen replaced with geometry and physics. Some argue that the changelings have\nallowed this to happen.\nRather than spending their time cultivating and tending their links with the\nhumans, they’ve turned their gazes inward over the years, busying themselves with\ntheir internal political and personal intrigues and all but ignoring the humans that\nthey rely on for Glamour. Unfortunately, while their attention was elsewhere, many\nhumans abandoned their dreams for what seemed to be a sure thing: science.\nThis scenario examines what happens when reason finally takes over and deals\na terrible blow to the world of dreams. The two have been at odds for years, but now\nthe balance has finally shifted in favor of the strictly rational, at great cost to both\nsides. Without their dreams, the mortals can find neither rest nor release. Violent\ncrimes escalate as their frustration mounts. Without the Glamour such dreams\nprovide, the fae grow weaker and the Dreaming sickens rapidly. The Kithain are left\nwith only one option. In the wake of this great crisis, they must find a way to\nreconnect with humanity once more, or they will surely perish.\nUltimately, this is not a scenario about giant battles, Dreaming quests or\ndastardly scheming (though it could contain all of those). Instead, it is a scenario\nabout the power of ideas to either quash the human spirit utterly or elevate it to a\nwhole different realm of existence.\nBUILDUP\nTo a certain extent, the signs of this decay are already here. Changelings have lost\nmuch of their former power over mortals, the Dreaming is not as accessible as it once was,\nand Glamour has become increasingly difficult to come by. Foreshadowing elements\nsuch as Dreams Deferred, Cantrips in Flux and Shallowings can help suggest that\nsomething wicked this way comes. This scenario examines what happens when the ax\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n172\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nfinally falls. Although the Dreaming has weakened in recent years, a precarious balance\nhas held. Now, something has happened to topple it. The poison is yours to pick.\nThe first step in developing such a chronicle is to decide on a cause for the Rift\nand build it into the story. Perhaps the most compelling cause is a sudden break or\nviolent shift in public opinion that opens a great wound in the Dreaming and hastens\nthe decline of Glamour. In this scenario, life continues normally until a sudden\ndevelopment causes the Dreaming to violently rip away from the mortal world. Such\nan abrupt change would be noticeable, if not painful, to the changelings. What\nmight cause such a break? Remember that inspirational scientific advancements\nsuch as the moon landing serve to increase hope for the future, not decrease it.\nIn this instance, the discovery would have to show that something is impossible\nrather than possible. Perhaps scientists have disproved to the populace’s satisfaction\nthe existence of life on other planets, or the possibility of life after death. Maybe a team\nof noted astronomers announces that a giant comet really is going to hit the planet in\na few years after all, killing all dreams of the future in one fell swoop. Geneticists might\nfind an “extinction” gene in the human genome, which will guarantee the extinction\nof the race within a century. Or perhaps a group of prominent ecologists gives Earth\na final “time of death” in the near future, as natural resources diminish or pollution\nrises. Try to think of a suitably massive and compelling discovery that would quash\nhope rather than kindle it, and work from there.\nOf course, if a specific idea doesn’t seem to work, there’s always the possibility that the\nRift is the result of humanity’s overall despair, the weight of apathy finally reaching a critical\nmass that begins dragging the Dreaming down much more quickly than before. As this\nphenomenon becomes more and more pervasive, the Dreaming begins to react little by\nlittle. Glamour gradually becomes scarcer as humans stop producing it. The Dreaming\nslowly distances itself from the mortal world as mortals apathetically shove it away.\nRegardless of whether a specific idea or general indifference is the cause, it soon\nbecomes evident that something must be done to repair the Rift, lest the Dreaming\nbe lost forever. Eventually, the Dreaming completely separates from the mortal\nworld, and the changelings are left with a simple choice: to make do or find some way\nto reestablish that connection.\nFIGHTING THE FUTURE\nOnce you’ve sufficiently built up the problem and convinced the characters\nthat something is very wrong with the world (more so than usual), the next step is\nto call them to action. What can they do to turn the tide against something so\nintangible as an idea, so passive as apathy? While it is impossible for them to\nindividually inspire each and every person in their town or city, it is possible for them\nto start a reaction that would essentially do the same thing.\nRemember, it is the nature of dreams to spread from person to person. Dreams\nare alive, and simply hearing that awe and excitement in someone else’s voice can\nsometimes be enough to pass a dream along from one person to another. What the\ncharacters need to do is find a way to inspire enough people and reconnect back to\nthe Dreaming. Mortals want to dream. It’s the characters’ job to help them do it.\nDepending on the needs of the chronicle and the nature of the theory involved,\nit may also be possible to disprove the idea itself, or at least conduct further research\nthat ameliorates some of the worst of its implications. (“Sure, we’re going to run out\nof oil in five years, but with the improved solar engines I’ve designed, we won’t even\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n173\nCHAPTER FIVE\nnotice it’s gone!”) Doing so is a worthy goal of more studious or inventive characters.\nEven if they find compelling evidence that contradicts the original idea, though, they\nstill must find a way to get the word out to the general population (relatively easy) as\nwell convince a disheartened public that what they are saying is true (not so easy).\nIt is the nature of the fae that as soon as they learn of the problem, some less\nscrupulous characters will likely be tempted to kill the problem by killing the\nmessengers — namely the esteemed scientist or team of researchers that made the\nannouncement in the first place. Needless to say, this is a bad idea for several reasons.\nFirst of all, the scenario assumes that the idea has already been circulated at least\non a local level, if not nationally (or beyond). Killing the researchers won’t do anything\nto stop its spread, and it might even focus additional attention on the idea as other the\nkillings are investigated and other researchers learn of the work and take interest in it.\nHOLDING BACK THE RAIN\nOnce the characters understand what they need to do, at least in a general sense,\nit’s time for them to get to work. They can hunker down and try to wait it out, or\nthey’ll need to find a way to inspire a large enough group of people to jumpstart the\nDreaming and then protect that group while the Dreaming regains its strength. After\nall, those mortals will just be learning to believe in dreams again, and a major\ncatastrophe would only undermine their burgeoning hopes. This process takes time,\nhowever, since the local residents are likely frightened and dispirited by all of the\nchanges they’ve been witness to since the beginning of the scenario.\nRemember that, as the Dreaming draws farther away, the mortals have been\nincreasingly unable to rest. They’ve been without steady dreams and the REM sleep\nthat comes with them. Most have been feeling frustrated or depressed, or they have a\nloved one who feels that way. These feelings lead to increases in violent crimes,\ndivorces and general unrest among the populace. None of the experts can explain what\nhas happened or why, and as a result, many people feel frustrated by their inability to\nsnap out of it. Inspiring dreams among these people will be difficult at best, and it will\nrequire patience and effort.\nTHE AFTERMATH\nUnfortunately, if the characters have not managed to inspire a sufficient\nnumber of mortals (or whatever number you deem appropriate), the aftermath for\nthe story isn’t pretty. Having failed to find a way to rekindle the spark of hope and\ncreativity in the populace, the characters face a future increasingly devoid of\nGlamour, and they will be Undone before many more months go by.\nDAMN THOSE TECHNOCRATS!\nStorytellers, resist the temptation to have the idea be traced back to the work\nof nefarious Dauntain, Autumn People or even Prodigals. While such sinister\nagents might seize on the idea as a weapon to further their own Banal agendas,\nhaving supernatural forces responsible for creating the idea itself downplays the\nvery heart of the scenario, namely addressing the lapsed and troubled relationship\nbetween humanity and the fae. This damage won’t be undone by defeating a few\nvillains with simple swordplay and cantrips. It will take a renewed commitment\nto the once-proud bond between humanity and the fae to truly have a chance to\nmend the Rift and restore the Dreaming.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n174\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nEven if the Rift is mended and a healthy connection to the Dreaming is re-\nestablished, which is a difficult proposition to say the least, it is still possible that the\nlingering effects of confronting such a virulently Banal idea traps the characters in\ntheir mortal seemings forever.\nIf the characters have in fact succeeded, however, the story does have a brighter\nending. The Dreaming in their immediate area has survived and is fairly healthy. It\nrequires constant supervision and cultivation to maintain itself, though, and the\nmortals who live within need constant inspiration and protection to help them\ncontinue to produce Glamour.\nNot only was the local Dreaming seriously weakened over the course of the\nscenario (not that it was entirely healthy to begin with), it is also being eroded from\nthe outside. After all, the decay was not simply limited to this town or this community,\nit was widespread throughout the entire planet. While a few communities managed to\nwithstand and counteract it, particularly as the characters’ efforts spread among\nKithain and mortal alike, many other communities remain dangerously tainted by the\nidea, and the despair carried by the inhabitants of the fallen towns is a constant threat.\nTheir only hope is to band together with the other remaining fae strongholds\nand attempt to push back the grayness, to reestablish the Dreaming. The local\nchimera help as much as they can, but they too are marooned in your town, and while\nthey can help inspire the local mortals, they cannot get out either. But that is the\nmatter for another chronicle and another time.\nTHE GREAT PURGE\nChangelings have long speculated about their origins. The Tuatha de Danaan,\nsaid to be the ancient progenitors of the fae, exist only in legend and song, their motives\nand characteristics lost to time. Truly, the modern fae has no idea whether or not she\nis acting as the Tuatha would have wished. Most changelings would dismiss such a\nquestion as irrelevant, given that it has been such a long time since anyone heard even\na whisper from their forefathers, but perhaps these questions are not so irrelevant after\nall. The Tuatha de Danaan exist in the deepest areas of the Dreaming, unreachable by\nthe Silver Path. Mortal concepts such as time and space have no meaning to them\nthere. The Tuatha nobles have taken an oath to look over their wayward children on\nEarth, however, and they take that oath seriously. Periodically, they send scouts out\ninto the mortal realm to make sure that all is going as they decreed so many years ago.\nUnfortunately for the changelings, it isn’t. Before the Tuatha de Danaan left Earth for\ntheir homeland, they made a series of sacred oaths, and they required their children to swear\nto the oaths as well. One of the oaths was simple: The fae swore never to mingle fae and\nmortal blood. The resulting creature was said to be an abomination against nature, and\nfurthermore would prove to be the undoing of the Dreaming. As the centuries passed, all\nrecord of the sacred oaths was lost, so the changelings never knew that their existence was\noutlawed by the order of the Tuatha. But, now that the scouts have once again returned\nto Earth, they soon find out, and the Great Purge of the changelings begins.\nBUILDUP\nIn this scenario, the end comes quickly, heralded only by the appearance of the\nscouts. Foreshadowing elements such as Errant Trods and the Tithed Ones can add\ntension and depth to a chronicle. For example, one possible method for structuring such\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n175\nCHAPTER FIVE\na chronicle is to have the scouts show up and immediately become enraptured or enraged\nby the mortal world. Although they are quite literally unstoppable in the Dreaming, they\nhave no understanding of mortal doings, and they could very easily start a riot without\nquite realizing what they’ve done. The characters rush to the scene and calm the\nsituation, only to discover the creatures at the center of the commotion, the likes of\nwhich they’ve never seen before. The appearance of the scouts should inspire awe and\ncuriosity among the characters, then the appearance of the foreshadowing elements will\nlead them to the realization that the scouts might not be as wonderful as they seem.\nThe scouts need help, and if the characters provide it, they are in a unique\nsituation to figure out what is happening and take steps to prevent it. The scouts need\nsomeone to help them navigate the mortal world as well as to gain access to the fae\ncourts in order to make a full report to the Tuatha nobles. If the characters make\nthemselves useful enough, the scouts may decide to take pity on them and tell them\nthe truth: that they are scouts sent by the Tuatha de Danaan, and their report will likely\nresult in the extermination of all changelings.\nAt this point, the characters have three choices. They can attempt to persuade\nthe scouts to make a false report, attempt to recruit the scouts to their side or ask them\nto provide as much information and assistance as possible without endangering\nthemselves. Getting assistance from the scouts is very difficult, since they are both\nloyal to their superiors and understandably afraid of them. Depending on how\npersuasive the characters manage to be, the scouts might agree to help them outright,\nbut it is more likely that they will provide help from behind the scenes, by giving\nthem warning of the attacks or by providing them with a safe place to hide. After all,\nthey are acting in accordance with a sacred oath with the Dreaming, and to be a\nTuatha oath-breaker is a dire situation indeed.\nSTORYTELLING THE GREAT PURGE\nThe chances of avoiding a battle are slim to none. After all, it will be very difficult\nto prevent the scouts from making their report, and if the characters somehow manage\nto detain or kill them, the Tuatha nobles simply send out a larger, more powerful group\nof scouts to deal with the problem. It is possible to persuade the scouts to lie to their\nsuperiors, that would be very difficult indeed given the respect and fear that the scouts\nhold for their nobility as well as for the sacred oaths. Remember that, by asking the\nscouts to protect changelings, the characters are asking them to break a sacred oath,\nTHE SCOUTS\nThe Tuatha de Danaan have abilities undreamed of by the average\nchangeling, and as a result, no Traits are provided for them. The scouts\nthemselves are the youngest and least powerful of all of the Tuatha, and their\nyoung and relatively impetuous nature makes them somewhat more sympathetic\nto the plight of the changelings. Furthermore, they have had experience with\nmortals, while many of the Tuatha have not. One option that Storytellers might\nuse to impress the players is to give the scouts names from mythology. Perhaps\nthe scouts inspired a group of mortals during one of their previous visits, and an\nentire religion sprang from their belief. Certainly, the characters would be\ngreatly impressed to meet Poseidon himself on the shores of Myrtle Beach, and\nthis would help them understand the power and longevity of the Tuatha scouts\nlong before they learn what the scouts are.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n176\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nand such a thing is not done lightly for a creature that exists entirely in the Dreaming.\n(In fact, the scouts should face some kind of punishment if they decide to help the\ncharacters. It could range from a chimerical mark of some sort that indicates a mild\nbetrayal to a physical impairment if they take direct steps against their orders.)\nWhen the battle comes, it is swift and terrible. The trods open more fully than\never before, and the creatures that exit the Dreaming are terrible in their beauty. So\ngreat is their power that the mortals cower under their beds, set out bowls of salt on\ntheir front porches and hang iron over the doorframes without quite knowing why.\nThe warriors methodically ride through the streets, slaying any and all of the\nchangelings in the world. They do not torture or toy with their victims. In fact, the\nmost horrible thing of all is the terrible sadness on the faces of the killers as they slice\ninto the desperate changelings, forever cutting them off from the Dreaming. Yet,\ntheir numbers are many and their loyalty unflagging, and the Great Purge takes only\na few days unless something is done to stop it.\nBut what can be done against so formidable an opponent? The Tuatha de Danaan\nare unstoppable to all but the eldest of changelings, and they have sufficient numbers to\noverwhelm even these changeling elders given enough time. Fighting the Tuatha is\nclearly a losing proposition. The only two options left to the changelings are to run and\nhide, or to attempt to convince the Tuatha that the sacred oath should be lifted.\nRunning is the easier of the two propositions. The one advantage that the\nchangelings have is their understanding of the mortal world, which could work to\ntheir advantage. By hiding in a place of mild Banality, the changelings might be able\nto suppress their fae seemings enough that they pass the notice of the Tuatha killers.\nThe scouts might even be persuaded to give the characters some assistance in healing\nor obtaining Glamour after exposing themselves to such a high level of Banality.\nAnother option would be to hide in the Dreaming itself. By traveling far enough into\nthe Deep Dreaming, the changelings might be able to hide their mortal seemings.\nAgain, the scouts might be persuaded to provide the changelings with a place to stay\nin the Dreaming if they decided to go that route. Either way, the changelings are\nrisking Undoing or Bedlam to avoid the notice of the death squads.\nThe last option would be to convince the Tuatha de Danaan that the sacred\noath is misplaced and is no longer needed. This would be a desperate attempt at best,\nand would require the changelings to prove that the union between mortal and fae\nsomehow strengthens the Dreaming rather than weakening it. How might one do\nthat? The example would need to show how the changelings create Glamour that\nwould not have existed without their influence. Unfortunately, the most difficult\npart might be to get the Tuatha nobility to listen to the argument. Such an effort\nwould definitely require the assistance of the scouts, and the chances of it succeeding\nare slim indeed. Why should the Tuatha de Danaan, the progenitors of the fae, listen\nto the arguments of changelings, who are nothing more than crimes against nature?\nTHE AFTERMATH\nIn terms of the aftermath, many different options exist. The first, and least appealing,\noption is that the characters did not survive. Perhaps they attempted to fight the Tuatha\nde Danaan despite the counsel of the scouts and fell to the Great Purge. Perhaps they\nattempted to hide but were unsuccessful. Or perhaps they attempted to sway the opinion\nof the Tuatha nobles but could not come up with anything persuasive enough to make them\nagree to lift the sacred oath. Regardless, this chronicle is over, correct? Not necessarily.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n177\nCHAPTER FIVE\nRemember that, while mortal bodies can die, some changelings believe that their\nfaerie souls return to Arcadia after chimerical death. It would be possible to continue\nthe chronicle with the same faerie souls. They could be reborn in the Dreaming and\ncould seek revenge there. Or, it might be interesting if they were reborn again as\nchangelings, in mortal bodies. That would certainly provide evidence that the\nDreaming supports the concept of changelings, even if the Tuatha de Danaan do not.\nThe new changelings might get glimpses of the Great Purge, and the remainder of the\nchronicle could examine how the Tuatha nobility react to the changelings’ return.\nThe second option is that the characters have gone into hiding. They might make\nup one of a few rebellious groups of changelings lurking in the shadows, waiting for the\nTuatha de Danaan to return to their home in the Dreaming. If they manage to remain\nhidden long enough, the Tuatha do just that. They leave Earth in the care of their\nscouts. This assumes that the scouts haven’t contradicted a direct order or have\nmanaged to hide any signs that they have compromised their oath. (Remember that\neven hiding the changelings likely results in a chimerical brand of some sort, and the\nscouts need to hide that mark or face the consequences.) This situation would be ideal\nfor the changeling survivors, since the scouts would be able to put them someplace safe\nand hide their continuing existence. Furthermore, Glamour and trods would be ripe\nfor the taking, since the number of changelings would be so greatly diminished. Travel\nthrough the Dreaming itself would need to be diminished or outright banned, since the\nTuatha de Danaan themselves sometimes travel the Silver Path on matters of business\nor pleasure. A chronicle of this sort could end with the establishment of a new\nchangeling society, or it could continue as the characters attempt to find a way to justify\ntheir continued existence to the Tuatha before they are discovered.\nSTARLIGHT EXODUS\nWhat if the end of the Autumn World isn’t the end of the Dreaming?\nThough few Kithain have seriously considered the possibility, the death of\nGlamour in the mortal world does not necessarily signal the death of the Dreaming.\nIt is possible that the coming Winter may simply be the signal for the fae that it is\ntime to return to Arcadia, or perhaps seek a new realm deep in the Dreaming to start\nREMOVING THE SACRED OATH\nWhat if the impossible does happen and the characters manage to convince\nthe nobles that the Sacred Oath is indeed misguided and should be removed? What\ndoes this mean for the changelings, and what kind of effects would this have on the\nDreaming as a whole? First, the Tuatha de Danaan patiently explain that the\nDreaming needs to have sacred oaths to strengthen its connection with the mortal\nworld. Without these oaths, the two worlds would gradually separate. So, in place\nof the existing oath, another needs to be forged. One possibility of a new sacred oath\nwould be to place mankind in the keeping of the changelings. The changelings\nwould be directly accountable to the Dreaming as a result, and they would be\ncharged with making sure that mortals continue to produce Glamour. Provided the\nchangelings agree to swear to the new oath, the Dreaming remains strong and\nhealthy. Conversely, refusing to swear to the oath would harm the Dreaming, and\nit is likely that the Tuatha nobles would order the Great Purge to resume if the\nchangelings do not agree to protect the Dreaming as they ought to do.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n178\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nover. The question remains: Do they have the strength to leave behind everything\nthey know and seek a new destiny?\nOn a thematic level, this scenario encompasses some of Changeling’s core\nconcepts — isolation, alienation and the feeling of being orphaned in this world —\nand deals with them in an overt fashion. In the face of Endless Winter, the decision\nto leave might seem like no choice at all, but remember that just as some inmates\ngrow attached to their cells and afraid of the world outside, so too will many fae have\ntrouble cutting their ties to this world.\nLikewise, although it contains a certain amount of adventure and the thrill of\nexploration as the fae return to the Dreaming, Storytellers should remember that this\nis no more of a “happy” ending than any of the other scenarios presented in this\nchapter. Aside from the many dangers of the Dreaming and the potential heartbreak\ninvolved in the search for a new homeland, the fae will have to leave behind the\npeople and places they know forever.\nBUILDUP\nFirst and foremost, the Autumn World should grow increasingly hostile to the\nfae as the time of the exodus approaches, to the point where Kithain are finding it\ndifficult to live their daily lives in the face of rampant Banality and seemingly\nubiquitous Autumn People. The Death of the New element is an excellent way to\nintroduce the idea that the mortal world is indisputably in its last hours.\nThe enchanted world should also be weakening, though not to such a great extent\nthat a mass exodus will seem outright impossible when the idea is finally raised. The\nRed Star could even act as a navigational point later on, while Prophecy Fails can\ndemonstrate the hopeless nature of remaining on Earth. Shallowings also provide a\ngood way to show that something is happening in the Dreaming. It is also very helpful\nif the characters have dealings with or at least heard of Dice (see Kithbook: Eshu) and/\nor the Seekers of Lyonesse (see The Fool’s Luck), though not strictly necessary.\nPerhaps the most critical aspect of the build-up for this scenario, however, is a\nmore widespread form of the Gloomies, the yearning that grumps feel for Arcadia.\nCalled the Longing, that same feeling that they belong somewhere else, begins to\ninfect all Kithain regardless of age or Banality. Even fae who are asleep from excess\nBanality feel restless and increasingly consumed by wanderlust, driven to find a place\nthey cannot name but are compelled to seek out.\nSONGS OF LEAVING\nAt this point, just about all fae have realized that they are feeling an unmistakable\nurge to go somewhere. (Recognition of how widespread these feelings are and discussion\nof what they might mean is an excellent way to bring the buildup period to a close and\nbegin the heart of the scenario itself.) Give the characters just enough time to realize\nthat something large is at work, and then begin the first stage of the exodus.\nTHE UNKNOWN ROAD BECKONS\nOnce the characters have had enough time to discuss what might be happening,\nbut before they become too comfortable with the idea, rumors of a strange traveler\nbegin to reach them, a mysterious Kithain visiting freeholds large and small and\nleaving strange behavior in his wake. Fae who have spoken to him have apparently\ndone such things as sell all they own, disavow their mortal lives, even turn their back\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n179\nCHAPTER FIVE\non the local fae and head for parts unknown. Some rumors whisper of darker chaos\nfollowing his visits as well, from suicides to vicious duels to uprisings against the local\nnobility, though whether any of this behavior stems directly from his words or simply\nthe reaction to them remains hard to determine. The characters might even hear of\nsuch strange goings-on in a neighboring freehold, giving them just enough time to\nworry about what his mission is or what it means to them before he finally arrives.\nInto the midst of all this curiosity and speculation, a wanderer approaches the\nlocal freehold (or if none is available, the motley directly). If Dice is known to the\ngroup, they recognize the Síocháin immediately. If not, a local sage or savvy eshu\nidentifies him instead. Even those who don’t know the legends of this elusive immortal\ncan see that he is exhausted, however. The trail dust is caked on his clothing, his eyes\nare bleary and his voice is cracked and breaking. He doesn’t arrive so much as slump\nthrough the doorway and collapse. While his condition isn’t serious, boggans and other\nsensitive kiths may fret over him for a couple of hours before he is ready to tell his tale.\nWhen he has had some time to drink a little and eat some simple fare, some of\nthe sparkle returns to Dice’s sad eyes. He quietly but firmly requests that all local\nKithain who are available be sent for immediately, as he has traveled far to make this\nannouncement and has many more stops to make before he can rest again. Until\nthen, he talks cordially with the fae but deflects any questions about his purpose for\ncoming here. If anyone brings up the Longing, his eyes grow darker and he simply\nsays that he has had the same feelings, but he politely refuses to speculate further.\nAfter the local Kithain have been assembled, he rises to his feet, brushes off some of\nthe dust and bows to the assembled Kithain, then begins to speak.\nDice’s exact words are left to the imagination of the Storyteller. While the\n“canonical” speech can be found on p. 41 of Time of Judgment, Storytellers should\nfeel free to alter his words and even the tone of the speech itself to suit the needs of their\nown chronicle. Even if they choose to keep the speech as presented, a difference in\nreading can still be used to underscore the theme of the chronicle in one simple gesture.\nDelivering it in energetic tones with a lot of dramatic flourishes is appropriate for a\nchronicle that is more light-hearted or adventure-oriented. A weary and sorrowful\ndelivery can take these same words and reinforce a more somber, bittersweet chronicle.\nRegardless of how it is said or what other information might be included, Dice’s speech\nshould include at least the following elements. First, the Autumn World is at last sliding\ninto full Winter, and nothing the fae can do here will stop that. Second, in the light of such\na revelation, the only hope for the continued survival of the Kithain is to leave for Arcadia\n(or another realm in the Dreaming). Third, Dice will use a treasure that can create a portals\ninto the Dreaming to help the fae begin such a journey, though only those who swear the\nOath of the Unknown Road will be able to enter these portals. (The oath is provided.)\nFourth, there is precious little time left before the journey must begin — enough for perhaps\ntwo or three full sessions of play is recommended, though the Storyteller may adjust this to\nsuit her chronicle. Finally, any fae suffering mortal death before the exodus will be trapped\non Earth forever, their souls unable to reincarnate properly.\nALL THAT YOU LEAVE BEHIND\nAfter Dice leaves, the local Kithain community is likely to be thrown into quite\nan uproar. While the sworn oath of such a powerful and ancient fae puts the truth of\nthe matter largely beyond question, things won’t likely be decided very quickly! Many\nfae are stunned at the implications of what must come next. While they were aware\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n180\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nthat things were growing steadily worse in this world, the abrupt knowledge that they\nneed to evacuate it in order to survive is something not even the most paranoid or\nsuperstitious fae were really expecting to hear. For some, the idea of leaving is\nimmensely liberating (though that’s not necessarily a good thing). For others, it is a\ntime of fear or even anger at the mystery to come and the world they must give up.\nAside from any unique local or oathcircle-specific concerns that come up\nfollowing Dice’s announcement, there are several critical factors that Storytellers\nshould incorporate when running this section of the scenario. Without at least\ntouching on these bases, the eventual exodus will seem yet more abrupt and one-\ndimensional. It is only by giving the characters a strong sense of what they are giving\nup and how that makes them feel that the players will be able to play them honestly\nduring a time of such momentous change. Even if all that is done is a brief glossing\nover of some parts, having at least considered them will help flesh out the scenario\nin their minds, making it feel like a real goodbye rather than heading off on just\nanother (albeit prolonged) quest.\nDon’t be fooled. Despite the title, this section truly forms the heart of this\nscenario. After all, once the fae step onto the trod and begin the long way home, it’s\nreally more of a new beginning than an ending. Part of the trick involved in this\nscenario is that while Winter would eventually settle their accounts for them (if only\nby annihilation), it is truly the characters themselves who will decide what the End\nOATH OF THE UNKNOWN ROAD\nI pledge this day to prepare myself for the long journey home, and swear on my\nhonor and my faerie soul that once I take my first steps, I shall not turn back, nor shall\nI long for what is lost forever. I turn my face from the winds of Winter and set my eyes\nupon Arcadia, and pledge my life and my effort to reaching her silver gates for the final\ntime. I go forward with my heart confident, my mind clear and my spirit rejoicing, for\nI am going home at last. So swearing, with these words I leave this world behind.\nIn addition to giving those who are about to undertake the journey a sense of\npurpose and direction, this oath also provides certain benefits when traveling through\nthe Dreaming. The oath prevents the fae from being reincarnated back on Earth,\nalbeit at the risk of possibly having their essence lost in the Dreaming forever instead.\nIt does so by infusing a small talisman or other personal item of the character’s with\na unique purpose. Should the owner die, his fae spirit does not enter the normal\nprocess of reincarnation, but retreats into the item instead, remaining there until such\ntime as it is utterly destroyed or until the oath’s destination is reached. Objects infused\nin this fashion cannot be stolen, nor can they be destroyed short of powerful magic\nor the use of cold iron. Only small objects such as rings or necklaces are infused in this\nfashion. Weapons and armor never become foci in this fashion.\nAlso, should a motley swear this oath together, these trinkets immediately\ntransfer to other members upon the death of the owner, making it possible for the\nentire motley to reach the final destination, even if only one member actually survives\nthe journey. (The characters will have to wait to be reincarnated until then, but that\nis a small price to pay compared to being reborn on Earth during Endless Winter.) Of\ncourse, should a changeling die after swearing this oath alone or an entire motley fall\nalong the way, their essences remain lost somewhere in the Dreaming. While Dice\ndoes his best to search out such lost relics, there is always the chance that they might\nbe destroyed by some quirk of fate… or that sinister forces will find them first.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n181\nCHAPTER FIVE\nTimes will be like. No terrible disaster or contagion lays the realm to waste, nor does\nany great war or sudden mystic impulse force the fae to react any particular way to\nthe announcement they receive. Whether the final days are spent in quiet merri-\nment and bittersweet goodbyes, or drenched in bloody feuds and mindless vandalism,\ndepends entirely on the fae themselves and the choices they make. In short, they\nreceive precisely what their actions deserve — which is at least as fitting and often\nfar more terrible than any sort of judgment from on high.\nTherefore, while the players shouldn’t feel as though they are becoming too\nbogged down in such details, do not underestimate their value or their importance\nto the success of this scenario. In particular, those parts dealing with saying goodbye\nto mortal society and the reaction of the Kithain themselves deserve extra attention,\nfor it is from those stories that the characters derive a great deal of their impression\nabout the end and what it means.\nKithain Society\nFor the most part, Kithain react to the announcement in one of three ways:\nrevelry, madness or sorrow. For some fae, the knowledge that the return to the\nDreaming is at hand is cause for celebration. While they do not deny that departing\nthis world brings a certain amount of sadness, it is a time of great rejoicing, for they\nare going home at last. These Kithain spend a great deal of their remaining time\ngoing out partying, holding “wakes” for the Autumn World and otherwise indulging\nevery earthly desire before the journey begins. Once-forbidden trysts become more\nnumerous and more open, parties take on a frenzied air of mixed joy and desperation,\nand even the most polite and tactful fae truly speak their minds at last. After all,\nwhat’s the harm in the stoic troll bodyguard finally confessing his love for his\nbeautiful sidhe lady in the face of a journey of great danger and uncertainty to come?\nOf course, this air of reckless abandon has its own consequences as well. Despite\nDice’s warning, many fae see it as a time to settle long-standing grudges as well. Duels\nbecome more common, and in particularly volatile regions, minor skirmishes occur\nas feuding factions take their parting shots at each other. Even those who don’t wish\nto take part in such violence might find themselves caught in the ensuing crossfire.\nStopping the violence before anyone becomes trapped on Earth forever might be an\nimportant goal for the motley, especially if the characters hold positions of authority\nor feel any responsibility to their fellow fae. What’s more, even if the Kithain don’t\nattack each other, they must still be cautious at this time, as many of the antics of\nTHE EASY WAY OUT\nOf course, there are some players who will ask that since all faerie souls are\nsupposed to return to Arcadia between lives, why shouldn’t they just kill\nthemselves and beat the rush? The answer to this inane line of reasoning is very\nsimple: No one really knows what happens to fae between lives, especially with\nsuch a tremendous cloud as Winter looming on the horizon. Sure, fae killed in the\nDreaming appear to have their spirits carried off by a strange purple flame — but\nnobody knows exactly where that flame goes, either. Though it’s possible fae\nsuicides would wind up in Arcadia, it’s far more likely that they’ll wind up back\non Earth, trapped in Endless Winter with their final chance at escape lost at their\nown foolish hands. For the purposes of this scenario, in fact, that’s exactly what\nwill happen, which should curb those with overly self-destructive urges.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n182\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nthe more celebratory or nihilistic fae have the potential to draw down the wrath of\nmortal authorities, Prodigals or even the dreaded Dauntain. After all, it may be more\ntrue than the mortal realizes when a wilder hellion tells a police officer, “Don’t worry,\nyou won’t have to see me around here ever again.” That still doesn’t make it any less\nlikely the wilder will be arrested if the crime is serious enough, though.\nLast but certainly not least, there is bound to be a great deal of sorrow\nsurrounding these events, whether the fae choose to admit it openly or not. Despite\nthe certainty of Winter and the terrible fate that it entails, some fae will still choose\nto remain behind, whether out of love for mortal friends and family, a sense of\nobligation to an important cause or simply because they cannot bring themselves to\ngive up this world. Still others might be afraid of the journey or object to it based on\ndeep-seated personal beliefs, sometimes even surprising their closest friends and\nlongtime oathmates with their conviction on the matter. For all the hope characters\nmight have of possibly returning to be reunited with their friends one day, most fae\nrecognize that even if this isn’t actually their final goodbye, it will likely be the last\none for hundreds if not thousands of years. Trying to talk one of these reluctant fae\nout of this decision, or coming to terms with the fact that they refuse to change their\nmind can be the focus of a number of very intense and very involving sessions.\nRescuing the Sleepers\nThere is also the question of what should be done about those Kithain whose\nfae spirits are still clinging to their mortal forms, yet hopelessly quashed by Banality?\nIt is possible to bring these poor souls along, though the Banality they carry with\nthem will make the going slow and the way more treacherous. (Not to mention that\nconvincing them to freely swear the Oath of the Unknown Road in their slumbering\nstate will be difficult, to say the least.) This is especially important if any of the\ncharacters know any mentors, patrons or even former motley members who have\nfallen to Banality in this fashion. Even if they don’t, though, the Storyteller can still\neasily involve the characters in a quest or two to rescue such sleeping changelings\nbefore it’s too late. A local noble might charge the characters with completing the\ntask as their final service, or a weeping childling might approach them and ask them\nto save their Kithain grandparent before the exodus begins. Given the tricky nature\nof involving these Banality-laden fae in anything of the Dreaming without harming\nthem or acquiring too much Banality themselves in the process, even one such quest\ncan prove quite challenging to perform. And time is short…\nOf course, there is also the matter of rescuing fae trapped in prisons and\ninstitutions in time for them to make the journey. Aside from the difficulties and\ncomplications inherent in any kind of jailbreak scenario, certain other questions arise\nas well. Apart from overcoming the Banality that surrounds such institutions and\ninfects their inhabitants, the characters have to wrestle with the implications of\nreleasing potentially dangerous or unbalanced fae. While many Kithain are wrongly\nimprisoned by mortals or even other fae, not all of them are. Can the characters really\nrelease a hardened murderer or a fae in the deepest throes of Bedlam, even for such an\nimportant purpose as this? What happens if the prisoner they free goes on to commit\nheinous acts before the exodus? Can they take that risk? Should they?\nAnd what of the Dauntain? To be sure, they are hopelessly lost to the service\nof Banality in this lifetime, but is that a reason to condemn their future incarnations\nto a possible eternity of suffocating Winter? Can they be brought back to the way of\nGlamour at this final hour, or are their spirits forever lost for the sins of this life?\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n183\nCHAPTER FIVE\nWhile this question of redemption might not be something for every game, those\ngames that have featured Dauntain antagonists might inspire the Storyteller to at\nleast confront the players with the question of what to do with them, particularly if\nthe Dauntain were once sympathetic figures.\nHumanity’s Last Look\nObviously, all but the most reclusive and Bedlam-inclined fae have a number\nof mortal contacts and connections that they will desire to put in order before they\nleave this world. In contrast to the more openly dramatic or violent conflicts of\nKithain society, this is an excellent time to showcase a great deal of deeply personal\nroleplaying. After all, fighting off a gang of nihilistic redcaps is merely dangerous,\nwhile kissing a spouse and children goodbye forever is truly wrenching. Storytellers\nshould take care to make sure that each character receives some chance to settle his\naffairs and reconcile with his mortal life during this time, even if only to give it all\na final defiant gesture of disrespect. After all, even the most standoffish wilder or\nbitter grump still defines himself by his human nature as much as his faerie self, if only\nby his staunch opposition to everything the mortal world stands for. As such, it would\nbe remiss not to at least allow him to restate this position one last time.\nFIRES AT MIDNIGHT\nNo matter how busy the fae are in the wake of the announcement or how wisely\nthey choose to spend their remaining earthly hours, time eventually runs out and the\ndeadline for the beginning of the exodus is at hand. During the days immediately\nleading up to the departure time, disturbances in the Dreaming grow stronger and\nmore frequent, as do violence and disorder in the Autumn World. If any fae still\nharbored any doubts that the End Times were at hand, some of the phenomena\nwitnessed during these last hours should lay such concerns to rest. If nothing else, the\nEye of Balor grows to the size of a small moon on the penultimate night, bathing the\nchimerical world in its eerie reddish glow. The roars of great beasts of legend can be\nheard faintly on the wind, as well as the thudding and unmistakable footsteps of\ngiants echoing across the land.\nAs promised, fae gather at the appointed sites and witness a strange glow\nbeginning to appear as the sun’s light begins to fade on the horizon. At first it appears\nto be little more than a softly pulsing circle of light, but it gradually grows stronger\nuntil it is nearly as bright as the summer sun. Items infused by the Oath of the\nUnknown Road glow faintly in response, especially as the bearer draws nearer the\ncircle, but regardless no individual can enter. Those who attempt to do so are\nrepulsed gently but firmly, regardless of skill or strength, and repeated attempts only\nincur more forceful (but never lethal) reactions. With the fleeing of the last rays of\nsunlight, silhouettes appear in the center of the glare, first barely discernible but\ngrowing clearer until they are unmistakably fae, at which time they step from the\ncircle and greet the travelers.\nA surprise awaits with the arrival of these mysterious fae. At least one if not all\nof the fae who come through are known to the characters, whether they are fallen\nfriends, mentors long since passed or otherwise faces the characters know and\nrespect. They are dressed in resplendent armor and fine clothes, but they otherwise\nappear exactly as they did in the prime of their life, and they favor the characters with\nwelcoming looks and warm expressions. They spend a few minutes catching up with\ntheir old acquaintances. While they remain cagey about Arcadia and what awaits\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n184\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nbeyond (“You have to see it for yourself.”), they tell the characters that they are there\nto help them on their way, because part of the security surrounding Arcadia ensures\nthat passage from that realm does not guarantee a safe return trip, even for them.\nStill, even knowing that risk, they have come back for their friends and family,\ndetermined to help lead them back to their homeland. If Dice was particularly close\nto the characters, he appears at this time as well, though he will not journey far with\nthem on the other side. He wishes to keep track of many different groups along the\nway in case they need assistance.\nParting Words\nAfter everyone has said their goodbyes to those who are remaining behind and\notherwise made their peace, the Arcadians indicate that it is time to go and lead the\nfae into the circle of light. Entering the circle fills the fae with a sense of wonder and\nresolve, and all lost Willpower or Glamour Traits are immediately refreshed.\nCharacters have one last moment to speak or glance at the world they’re leaving\nbehind, then the light grows so bright that even those with their eyes shut see\nnothing but white radiance, and the sounds of the mortal world fade away to\nnothingness, replaced by the softly alien sounds of the Dreaming. There is a slight\npain, as though some last tie was severed, then nothing but a sense of belonging.\nCharacters open their eyes to discover that they are in the Near Dreaming, but with\nno sign of the mortal world in sight. There is a moment of heavy realization as the\nknowledge that the Autumn World is gone forever sinks in, and then they take stock\nof their surroundings.\nThe Silver Path stretches out before them.\nThe stars shine down on them.\nThe Longing calls to them.\nThe journey begins.\nDON’T LOOK BACK\nThe choices confronting the characters from that auspicious starting point offer\nan endless array of possibilities. Some Storytellers might even choose to end their\nchronicles at that moment, allowing the players to envision the hardships and\nadventures their characters overcome along their journey. While that is certainly\nnot an ending for every group, it can prove a surprisingly satisfactory one, as it grants\nthe players the freedom to imagine exactly the ending they desire.\nOf course, with the end of one world behind them, no few players will be\nclamoring to continue their adventures into the new one stretched out before them.\nGiven the vastness of the Dreaming and the difficulty of even a relatively guided\nreturn to Arcadia, this journey can easily be the subject of months or even years of\nfurther play. Generally speaking, however, most chronicles will take one of the\nfollowing three different approaches at this point.\nArcadia, Ho!\nGiven the themes of isolation and alienation that run throughout Change-\nling, the prospect of returning to their ancient homeland has a uniquely powerful\nappeal to the lost and wandering fae, who have been cut off from paradise for so\nlong. Getting to Arcadia might seem an incredibly distant goal at times, even with\nthe help of Dice and the Arcadians, but thanks to the sacrifices they’ve made and\nthe oaths they’ve sworn, the fae know it is possible. It might mean months or years\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n185\nCHAPTER FIVE\nof constant wandering through the many wondrous and bizarre realms of the\nDreaming, but it can be done. Arriving at the gates of Arcadia after a suitably\namazing and harrowing journey can act as a wonderful epilogue to a chronicle,\nthough it is still advised that aside from some powerful and poignant description\nStorytellers not try to continue the action once the fae have actually re-entered\nArcadia. Even in Changeling, some things are best left to the imagination of each\nindividual player.\nOur Own Place and Time\nAt the same time, some Storytellers might wish to avoid the idea of returning\nto Arcadia in favor of having the fae establish a new home somewhere in the\nDreaming. While the scenario was designed with a journey to Arcadia in mind, it can\nvery easily be changed to direct the fae to find a new realm instead. Perhaps Arcadia\nis poised to fall in a bitter war and some of the survivors have been sent out to gather\nthe fae to find a new homeland. Maybe the Dreaming simply desires that the fae seek\nout a new realm where they can establish the same kind of ties they once had with\nEarth. Perhaps like the Seekers, the fae are seeking the mythic realm of Lyonesse, or\nmaybe they feel that the Red Cities of Mars are the ideal site for a new fae society\nto begin. Different groups might even split up in pursuit of differing destinations,\nleading to competing factions or other unusual twists.\nUltimately, the reasons for mounting such a grand exploration are as limitless\nas the potential realms themselves. While Dreams and Nightmares offers a great\nnumber of possible destinations (not to mention places to see along the way),\nStorytellers should not feel limited to what is contained in that book when designing\nthe realm where they want the fae to eventually relocate. While creating an entire\nnew world for the fae to inhabit requires a great deal of time and effort to portray\nconvincingly, the reward can be well worth it.\nEarthbound\nThough perhaps rarest of all, it might happen that the characters aren’t the ones\ncrossing through the portal. They might be the ones wishing those who do farewell.\nWhile the final fates of characters who choose to remain behind are likely to be\nrather unpleasant, that doesn’t mean that the Storyteller can’t imbue them with the\ngravity and pathos they deserve. Even if it’s just quietly fading away to Banality in\nthe presence of loved ones, handling a group of Kithain who are facing the end of\nGlamour as they know it can be an intense roleplaying experience. Storytellers\nshould just make sure that players are well aware beforehand that there will be no\n11th-hour rescue. Provided they understand that, portraying the world at last\nsurrendering to the smothering chill of Winter can be as compelling as any journey\nthrough the Dreaming.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n186\n186\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n187\nCHAPTER SIX\n187\nThe end is nigh. The Book of Life is about to slam shut. Welcome to Armageddon.\nMan has long predicted its coming. The Mayans said the world would end in 2012.\nRomans believed that 12 mystical eagles revealed to the founders of the empire the\nexact date when civilization would collapse around their ears. The Book of Daniel and\nthe Book of Revelation both pull back the curtain to show exactly how God’s wrath\nwill send sinners to Hell and believers to salvation. Modern-day doomsday prophecies\nsuggest that we will die by meteor, comet, plague, biological warfare, nuclear winter,\nterrorism or by a thousand other ways to meet our proverbial maker. We have predicted\nArmageddon time and again, and we were wrong each time.\nNot this time.\nHunters have a special relationship with Armageddon. Unwittingly, the\nimbued are both signposts marking the demise of the world and key participants in\nthe approaching doom. Those brutal taskmasters, the Messengers, seem to have\nchosen certain people to be their eyes and ears during the last days — perhaps not\nto stop the end of the world, but to simply diminish its impact. The very appearance\nof hunters is indicative that the end is on its way, and now that it’s all hitting the fan,\nthe chosen have to decide. Do they help cushion the fall of mankind, refusing to\naccept that the finale is necessary and unstoppable, or do they stand aside and let\nannihilation happen, leaving reality to sink into oblivion? Is it possible that the end\ncan be stopped, that it can be denied and defeated in the last critical hours? It’s time\nto find out, because the final nails in humanity’s coffin are about to be driven.\nTHE NATURE OF THE END\nA lot of options are available when plotting the last gasp of the world. What\nfollows is a brief discussion of some design choices that might help you decide exactly\nwhat mood, theme and style of Armageddon you want to occur in your chronicle.\nYou don’t need to decide on a single element. Most of these can be combined to\ncreate your own approach.\nNATURAL OR MONSTROUS?\nCreatures poison the foundation of the world, corrupting society and bleeding the\nplanet of its mystical resources. A monstrous Armageddon is directly caused by and\ninvolves beasts. Vampires enslave humanity. People who die end up as the walking dead.\nWerewolves breed uncontrollably, plaguing the civilized world. All are examples of\nCHAPTER SIX:\nRECKONING\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n188\n188\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nmonstrous ends. Alternatively, the Storyteller could choose one or more of the End-\nTime scenarios found in other chapters and put it into effect, distorting the events\nthrough the flawed and imperfect lens of the hunters’ perceptions.\nAnatural end quite literally involves the natural world going berserk. Earthquakes\nshatter cities, chaotic weather systems ground planes and sink ships, the ice caps melt\nand oceans rise over coastlines to drown humanity. The monstrous angle is seemingly\nput aside as the world veritably rejects its inhabitants. In a strange way, both monsters\nand human beings are on almost even footing before such large and terrifying disasters.\nEPIC OR HUMAN?\nAn epic Reckoning game hasn’t been touched on much in other supplements,\nbut a story set in the context of Armageddon is a good chance to finally play one. Epic\ntales unfold in grand spectacle, not with small steps. The imbued might literally go\nto war, assaulting a wizardly power base in a major metropolitan area. Shapechangers\nand bloodsuckers clash openly under a blood-red moon. The skies darken with\nspirits, and damned creatures howl over the wind. An epic tale involves hunters\nactually having a place in the end, not simply being anonymous participants. The\ncharacters themselves affect the course of the world, perhaps even whether every-\nthing is destroyed or humanity somehow endures. You allow the characters to take\ncenter stage as heroes — troubled heroes, flawed heroes — but heroes nonetheless.\nA human approach to the End Times is subtle. The world probably falls apart\naround the characters’ ears, but they’re not central to Armageddon itself. They’re\nstill the focus of your chronicle, but the story is personal. Instead of marshaling a\ntroop of Zealots against a bloodsucker stronghold, the hunters finally go up against\na long-standing, single enemy. They don’t go to the front lines to heal fallen\ncomrades. They try to make their neighborhood better in these last days. This human\nangle is a microcosm of what’s going on in the broader world. Chaos ensues and\neverything falls apart, but the hunters deal with only one small portion of the chaos,\ntrying to keep friends, family and themselves from being victims.\nIt’s also possible that epic and human styles can be blended. In fact, given the troupe-\nstyle play encouraged by Reckoning, this option might wind up being the best one. The\nhunters still have their human, inner story of making peace with loved ones and enacting\nvengeance (or salvation) upon long-elusive enemies, but this “small” story contributes\nto the larger whole. Personal stories contribute to bigger victories and apocalyptic\ndevelopments, and characters could be swept into events that never involved them\nbefore. And from there comes the chance for salvation or a “stay of execution.”\nIMPOSED OR SELF-INDUCED?\nOne of the questions that needs to be answered is what caused this? Armageddon\ndoesn’t just happen. Somehow, somewhere, there must be a reason, however inscrutable,\nbehind the coming of the last days. If the end of the world is self-induced, humanity is\nresponsible for bringing it down on everybody’s head. If it’s imposed, the cause of the end\nis outside humanity’s control and, more importantly, not humankind’s fault.\nIn a self-induced scenario, humanity brings about its own undoing. Perhaps our\ndark side was long ago made manifest in monsters, and now the damning repercussions\nare felt. It could be that humanity’s compulsion to dominate the world and tap its\nresources causes global death. Or maybe humankind has simply created too many\nhavens and weapons for the creatures and becomes a victim of its own handiwork.\nThematically, using this scenario makes humanity the architect of its own unmaking.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n189\nCHAPTER SIX\n189\nThat’s the bad news. The good news is that perhaps there’s a chance to turn things\naround — which is where hunters come in.\nIf the end of the world is imposed, some outside force has levied an abstract judgment\non civilization and plans to destroy it for some reason. Humanity is essentially without\nblame. If a host of primeval vampires awakens and sets in motion a plan to enslave\nhumankind, the end is imposed. It’s not humanity’s fault if werewolves “cull the herd”\nand kill people or put them in slave-labor camps. Or if a conspiracy of magicians decides\nto assassinate major political figures in an effort to trigger World War III.\nULTIMATE END OR NEW BEGINNING?\nIn an ultimate-end chronicle, hunters fail at the Heralds’ task and the world ends\nin oblivion, never to enter another age. What’s the purpose of playing a chronicle\nthat culminates in annihilation? Characters who discover that there’s really no\nhope, no light at the end of the tunnel might feel that the only option is to eat a\nbullet. Or maybe not. Seeing that the true end nears, hunters might seek to make\npeace with the world however they can. This could mean reconciling with lost\nfamily, obtaining a long-sought answer from a reluctant monster, or driving a truck\nfull of explosives into a creature’s stronghold. It’s also possible that characters learn\nof the final end and refuse to believe it, continuing to rage against the dying of the\nlight. A strong sense of dramatic irony is achieved when players believe that the end\nis coming but their characters do not.\nOn the other hand, A new beginning is the intended outcome of Armageddon,\nat least according to the Messengers’ designs. Currently, the world is in autumn and\nthe End Times are winter. If hunters do their job, winter ends and spring becomes\nthe “new beginning.” Sure, the world is changed and there’s no telling how little of\nthe population might remain, but the point is that things don’t truly end. Storytellers\nusing this scenario might want to continue the chronicle in a “what if?” capacity,\noffering an altered world in the wake of the last days. This scenario allows for more\nhope than the previous option, because hunters can make a difference.\nTHE HUNT EVOLVES\nThe events that lead up to and demonstrate the End Times should be somewhat\nhunter-specific in order to get the message through to characters. That way they can\nsee it coming and act accordingly, rather than just be victims of it all like every other\nperson on Earth. Several conditions of being imbued, as hunters know them, can\nchange to suggest that something big is underway.\nEdges\nA hunter’s edges are among his few unprecedented tools available for dealing\nwith monsters. At the end, all bets are off and the circumstances of even the\nsupernatural are in flux. Hunters’ powers are already mysterious and frightening.\nAlmost anything could happen to them when any and all rules are broken in the last\ndays. Hunters might lose all of their edges as their connection to the Messengers is\nsevered, or the Heralds might seek to strengthen the connection, hoping to infuse\nthe chosen with a greater sense of purpose and ability.\nPerhaps each character gets an additional level in her primary edge path,\nincreasing her preternatural aptitude. Or maybe the Messengers go all out and every\nhunter is afforded the sudden opportunity to advance to the level-five edge in his\nprimary path. Characters whose goals and calling don’t compel them to such\nextremity might aim for more subtle effects, such as extra Virtue Traits that can be\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n190\n190\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nspent on more and different creed paths. Maybe the cost to purchase new Virtues is\nhalved, or perhaps it is doubled.\nYou need to decide if the hunters’ spiritual weaponry is fortified at the end. If\nnot, are the imbued no longer “necessary” according to the grand design, their\nsupernatural arsenal weakened or even severed?\nHunter Code\nThe hunter code allows for mysterious, clandestine communication between\nthe chosen. Whether sprayed on a wall or printed in a classified ad, the code allows\na certain level of covert contact among the imbued. But it’s not learned, it’s intrinsic\nto the chosen from the very moment of their change. And that means the hunter code\nis a spiritual entity, another gift from the Heralds. What does the advent of\nArmageddon do to the code? Are hunters’ bestowed capabilities weakened, strength-\nened or do they simply become erratic? Does the code explode with hundreds — or\nthousands — of new symbols, becoming a full language? (Perhaps even a spoken\none?) Does it cease to make sense, becoming meaningless to any hunter who sees it?\nMaybe only those imbued with Inspired- or Exalted-level edges can read it, implying\nthat the Heralds demand powerful soldiers in these grim times. Perhaps normal humans\ncan suddenly understand the signs. Or worse, what if monsters can read it? What happens\nwhen the enemy can suddenly tap into the secret cipher shared by the imbued?\nThe Heralds\nNo hunter exists without the guidance of the Heralds. Some consider communication\n“from above” gospel. Others believe it to be little more than hallucination. One hunter\nmight have a constant connection, while another has suffered otherworldly intrusion only\nonce, at the imbuing. The Messengers exist beyond this reality, but they are still affected\nby it. When Armageddon builds and hits, the “transmissions” hunters receive are sure to\nbe altered. Perhaps all (or only some) chosen experience a disturbing escalation in the\nnumber of messages they receive (imposing or increasing Patron levels). It’s also feasible that\nhunters could lose points in Patron as their connection falters. Or hunters’ Background\nscores might remain the same, but the messages change. They become louder, more obvious,\nmore persistent. The communication comes across more clearly or transmissions are\ngarbled, meaning the messages are more inscrutable now than ever.\nOf course, those options are severe and might be over the top for your game.\nAlternatively, the Messengers might “visit” individual (or all) hunters instead of\nrelying on messages. These visitations can manifest as visions, hallucinations or\ndreams. Or maybe these entities possess hunters and make them high-Virtue\nextremists for a time. The Heralds might even gift characters with new and different\ncapabilities to offset or survive Armageddon. The chosen could gain two extra\nBruised health levels, or a hunter might be able to treat all damage as bashing damage\nwhen Conviction is expended to activate second sight. The Powers That Be might\nmake impromptu modifications of the hunter “blueprint,” observing the rule that\ndesperate times call for desperate measures.\nBefore you get carried away with such changes, however, remember a few basic\ntruths. First of all, hunters are not and never should be out-and-out superhuman. Period.\nWhile Exalted edges push that limit, they are the result of close communion with the\nHeralds and/or extreme mental disturbance, not just generic super powers gained from\na fortuitous chemical spill or lucky dose of radiation. Even in the End Times, hunters\nshould always pay for what they gain, whether it’s with their blood, their sweat, their\nsanity or their soul. Second, as Storyteller it is your duty to bear game balance in mind\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n191\nCHAPTER SIX\n191\nand not “hook up” one character or group of characters while the other members of the\ntroupe get nothing. Even if you are running a Zeal-oriented scenario, that doesn’t mean\nthat your Zealots should gain all manner of benefits while followers of other Virtues get\nnothing. Doing so breeds argument among the players and downplays the seriousness of\nwhat’s going on while players argue about Trait totals and new powers.\nIf you decide to “ramp up” the level of the Heralds’ involvement with the\nhunters, it is important that the Storyteller and Narrators have enough messages\nprepared in advance to keep from getting stale or confused. It is good to have enough\ncommon themes present to keep the players from getting lost, but it is also important\nto vary the content enough to keep things fresh.\nStorytellers should also consider varying the medium of the Heralds’ messages\nto keep visions from getting too monotonous. Radio blurbs, scoreboards, baby\nprattling, pop-up Internet ads, bus destination signs and breaking news crawls at the\nbottom of new shows are all good alternatives to the usual trio of visions, voices and\nheadlines. If any of the characters know alternative methods of communication such\nas Ameslan or Morse code, you could consider working messages into these as well,\nSEVERING CONNECTIONS\nOne of your apocalyptic options is to sever the connection between the\nMessengers and the hunters. The end interferes with the hunter-Herald\nrelationship, the powers revoke their blessings, or the imbued are deemed no\nlonger necessary and are left to contend on their own. This severance is also\nproposed in other chapters in this book as other beings lose their connection\nto the source of their capabilities at the end of the world. If you decide to go that\nroute for the denizens of your World of Darkness, it’s recommended that\nhunters retain a thing or two.\nAny derangements a hunter suffers due to his imbuing or high Virtue\nscores should remain. Such ailments are imprinted on his brain.\nA hunter should always retain access to second sight. Once a person has\nseen the truth, there’s no closing that door again. Since Conviction is no longer\nneeded to “fuel” hunters’ lost powers, second sight can be handled in a couple\nof different ways. You can decree that the sight is always on. The chosen can’t\nturn it off (a la the Wayward creed), and it always reveals monsters everywhere\nthe imbued turn. The second option is to replace Conviction with Willpower\nto activate the sight. It’s no longer a matter of tapping bestowed reserves to see\nmonsters for what they are, but an act of inherent human determination. (Bear\nin mind that Willpower is much scarcer than Conviction, however, and harder\nto replenish.)\nWhile second sight can persist, hunters might no longer receive its associated\nprotection against monsters’ mind-, emotion- and fear-controlling powers. Acti-\nvating second sight reveals monsters for their true selves, but it no longer buffers the\nchosen from creatures’ supernatural capabilities. You may allow a limited version\nof such resistance using Willpower, though. A hunter with his Herald connection\neradicated might still have some strength to deny a monster’s influence. You could\nallow a Willpower Challenge (difficulty four Traits) for a hunter to resist a creature’s\ndominating effects.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n192\n192\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nas long as you maintain the mood. Likewise, Storytellers are encouraged to stay\ncreative when communicating these messages — mock up newspaper headlines,\ndoctor photographs, make audio or video recordings, et cetera.\nThese aids and props need not always be terribly elaborate. They should serve\nyour story, not hinder it by taking up a great deal of time to create. Having at least\nsome such prepared messages keeps things fresh, though, as opposed to constantly\ntaking players aside and telling them, “You have a vision of…”\nBystanders\nAssuming monsters don’t openly do battle in the streets, humanity at large\nmight still need to be shown the truth in the last days. Bystanders could be the\nagents who go among the masses, revealing events and showing individuals for\nwhat they are. Bystanders could also be charged with organizing informed people\ninto a revolutionary force, and they might be better at it than the imbued. It’s\nalso possible that you just want to show bystanders to have had an important role\nafter all, perhaps foreseen or intended by the Heralds. Before the end, the\nmajority of bystanders remained on the sidelines of the hunt, but now they\norganize. They might go to battle with the chosen or form their own circles that\nassume roles and fill holes that hunters cannot. They can spread information,\nprovide support to wounded chosen, ground the imbued who teeter on madness,\nand exemplify what ordinary people can do.\nThere are other, more… extreme options, as well. Consider what might happen if all\nbystanders are given something of a second chance. Perhaps they’re allowed to turn and face\nthe truth and become full-fledged hunters. Or perhaps they aren’t given the choice and are\nsimply forced into a second imbuing, one they’reunable to deny. In this last case, how is their\ncreed determined? Are they oddly without creed, able to assume any combination of\nVirtues and edges? Or maybe they’re not miraculously “promoted” after all, but given\nlimited access to a few hunter powers. Perhaps they gain second sight or a single dot in a\nsingle creed path. It’s even possible that bystanders do not become hunters, but raw conduits\nfor information sent directly from the Messengers. What happens if bystanders lose all sense\nof self and identity and their personalities are subsumed by one personality from beyond?\nWhat happens when bystanders summarily lose their humanity?\nTHE CREEDS\nHunters are driven by their individual personalities, first and foremost, but\nsecondary are their Virtues and creeds. The imbued are people, yet their very\noutlooks and predilections establish guidelines and suggestions for how they react to\nmonsters and cope with the hunt. Creeds and Virtues derive from such identity and\ncan be used to estimate how a hunter might think and behave. Someone might be\nintuitive (suggesting Vision) or dedicated to protecting friends (suggesting De-\nfense), or if she is predominantly hopeful and good-willed, she could be an Innocent.\nSo what general roles do hunters of different Virtues and creeds assume at the\nend of the world? Do they remain individuals working separately from each other,\nor can they find some common ground and cause? Can they set their differences\naside, or are their seemingly insurmountable differences part of some grand plan? Do\nZealots stand in the way of the Merciful at every turn, and is that how the Visionaries\nwant it? Here are a few ideas on what hunters of the three Virtues might do during\nthe last days, as well as suggestions for Storytellers on possible themes and events\nwith which to confront them.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n193\nCHAPTER SIX\n193\nMERCIFUL\nRedeemers sense that something has to be done. They can’t usually sit idly by. Their\npersonalities and capabilities tend to motivate them to help at every turn. Such calling\ncertainly makes them needed. Humans get hurt, monsters go mad and others hunters\nexhaust themselves and their resources. Redeemers are there to help, rejuvenate and\nforgive. But does their mission demand too high a price? Those on the path of\nRedemption might become obsessed with saving everyone. Everywhere they look is pain,\nloss and suffering. The inability to save everyone can drive Redeemers to dangerous\nlengths. They might overextend themselves or fall to addictions such as drugs to stay\nawake or to numb their pain. It’s also possible that they could go insane through a\nmessianic complex. They might believe that they are divinely inspired “saviors,” placing\nthemselves at the center of their own mythology and religion that must save the world.\nA group that is almost bound to push itself too far, too fast is the Martyrs. These\nhunters have no shortage of demand (especially in their own minds) during the end.\nThey might take on any mission, from getting food to a group of hungry children to\nstrapping C-4 to their bellies and walking into a penthouse filled with vampires. But\nat what cost? Martyrs can go beyond the distance, resisting the need for sleep,\nsustenance and shelter. But can they have long-term usefulness in the last days if they\nmanage to restrain any self-destructive tendencies? Why would they preserve or pace\nthemselves? The clock is ticking and there’s little time left. With little to lose except\na chance to maybe make a bigger sacrifice tomorrow, what holds these masochistic\nhunters back today? And what happens when a Martyr starts to appreciate the end\nof the world and his place in it? Could a hunter of this stripe actively work to oppose\ntoo much good so that he can fully embrace his calling in this dark time?\nInnocents might be able to see some good at the end, at least in theory. While not\nnecessarily eternal optimists, many believers cling to the hope that something watches out\nfor the world. If they can honor and share that belief, maybe there will be a reward after\nso much tribulation. (And if not, isn’t making the final days better reward in itself?)\nInnocents can assuage people’s fears and offset the erratic, angry behavior of some\nmonsters. A vampire might be lost in temporary madness, caught in the throes of fear and\ndread, and an Innocent could help the being resist its destructive instinct. The hopeful\ncan also be useful in information-gathering and performing thankless tasks due to a\nwillingness to go places few else will and to trust those who others refuse to.\nVISIONARIES\nAre those of the Vision Virtue — specifically Visionaries — truly meant to be\nleaders or scholars or strategists? Are they simply insane people unraveling enigmas\nwith little idea as to how or why? The Ministers ostensibly have a mission for hunters\nof this creed, and it relates directly to the end. They are intended to uncover means\nof saving (or more appropriately, surviving and rebuilding) the world, and to lead\nothers to such solutions. It can seem as if these seers are made for times like these.\nThey are often chosen for their curiosity, drive, foresight and imagination. They can\nstudy monsters and pick apart the causes and effects of the End Times. These dark\ndays call for answers, and Visionaries might provide them.\nBut metaplot aside, Visionaries can fill any number of niches in your game.\nThey can be hoarse-throated doomsayers walking the streets, screaming their\nprophecies to anyone who will listen. They might be investigators acting in the\nshadows, secretly researching (through books, monsters or dreams) the path\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n194\n194\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\ndestruction might take and how best to stop (or encourage) it. They could be\nstrategists for other hunters, sketching a blueprint for success. Or they could be the\ngenerals of the chosen, marshaling the forces of the imbued community, rallying\nthem to battle against the inhuman denizens of the world. The clarity and focus\nthat these imbued often possess can give direction to disparate hunters, allowing\nall to work toward some goal before time runs out.\nZEALOTS\nAvengers might assemble cults of personality, perhaps comprising other hunters, but\nit’s possible that normal people heed the summons in this apocalyptic age. The vengeful\npoint to religious evidence (Book of Revelation, the Koran) to “prove” the righteousness\nof their call to arms. Do Avengers endorse extreme violence, engaging in and encouraging\nwanton destruction (as opposed to the calculated levels of devastation aimed for by\nWaywards)? Is it possible that an Avenger’s faith in his “crusade” falters with the end?\nMany Defenders do what they’ve always done, only ever more intently. They\ncan hole people (including friends and family) up in safe and remote locations to\n“weather the storm.” Some protectors might attempt to save humanity from the\ndepredations of monsters and other hunters, fearing that something must be saved\nbefore all is lost. Guardians’ “line of defense” can be drawn anywhere — at a door,\na city block or at a town’s limits. If the time comes that a safe house is violated, these\nhunters assume responsibility for leading their charges to new, safer places elsewhere.\nDefenders are anchors against the storm, but their value assumes that something will\nsurvive to see the next day’s calm.\nJudges might find their impartiality useful in deciding which monsters, hunters\nand people are worthwhile in the madness of the end. They can decide what must\nbe saved and what must be tossed overboard in order to remain afloat. They can make\nthe split-second decisions that mean life or death, moment to moment. But what\nhappens when these decision-makers go too far? Do they form cults based on their\nown megalomania? Do they become jury and executioner, too, taking their brand of\ncondemnation to the undeserving? Or do they judge themselves too harshly, leaving\nthemselves ineffective and indecisive when others need them most?\nEXTREMISTS\nWaywards are capable of carrying out intricate plots of deliberate devastation in\nan effort to harm monsters. To them, Armageddon is a Grand Guignol of possibility.\nCreatures are everywhere, and Waywards couldn’t turn off their sight even if they\nwanted to. Do these people finally marshal the troops as was their original intent?\nMaybe world devastation is a sufficiently desperate situation to warrant other hunters\nto follow a Wayward lead. Perhaps God45 and Peleus assemble a small army of other\nextremists and carry out brutal attacks on monstrous holdings everywhere.\nHermits, too, must have a place in the end. They have an intense connection to the\nMessengers, but it’s usually incoherent babble. What happens if the constant messages start\nmaking sense? Do Hermits become prophets among hunters, delivering the “truth” to any\nand all who will listen? Waywards might stand in the way of other hunters with their violent\ndesigns. Hermits can also stand in the way, but in a different manner. Possibly believing\nthemselves the mouthpieces of the Heralds, Hermits might disrupt other hunters’ efforts\nwhen they go against the “plan” (which potentially exists only in an intruder’s mind). If a\ngroup of imbued is about to sneak into a slave-labor camp and a Hermit sees the act as\ncontrary to Messenger desires, he might intentionally blow the hunters’ cover.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n195\nCHAPTER SIX\n195\nMONSTERS\nWithout monsters there would be no imbued. Men and women are chosen for the sole\npurpose of dealing with creatures by one means or another. But at the end of the world, what\nare monsters doing and how might hunters get involved to stop the beings? The following\nare ideas for creature activity in the End Times, whether as direct contribution to\nannihilation or as a result of it. Principle antagonists in your chronicle might have very\nspecific agendas for themselves and the imbued. Or perhaps they have particular goals based\non the Armageddon scenario you choose from those proposed earlier in this chapter. Other\ncreatures make their own final bids or exult in the end in their own ways.\nSPIRITS AND WALKING DEAD\nGhosts and zombies are intrinsically related. After all, most walking dead are\nlittle more than ghosts trapped in sacks of animated meat. The End Times are sure\nto send reverberations throughout the spirit world. Indeed, the recent influx of the\ndead into the lands of the living (which also signaled the emergence of the imbued)\nmight have been a sign of the end. Do spirits look forward to and help shepherd the\nEnd Times, seeking to bolster their armies with fallen spirits? Or does the final\nreckoning mean that even the dead will be judged and sent screaming into the void?\nStranger still, what does it mean if spirits and zombies don’t proliferate at the\nend, but disappear altogether? They go from hunters’ most common antagonists to\nnonexistent. Do the chosen mistakenly consider this absence a triumph, or do they\nsee it as the bad omen it is? Are even the dead able to die? Worse, did something\ndestroy them, something far worse than the very menace of the living dead?\nVAMPIRES\nThe End Times are chaos incarnate. Do bloodsuckers take advantage of it, or are\nthey punished by it? Why care about a few exsanguinated bodies when an earthquake just\ndecimated the whole town? Vampires can capitalize on such disorder and grow fat on the\nblood of the defenseless. Other questions arise, too. Do vampires reveal themselves to the\nmortal masses, dropping any pretense of secrecy, or do they have to remain hidden,\navoiding the mobs that fill the streets in search of the cause of society’s failure?\nMost important, how can hunters respond to vampire activity? Rather than\nreact to bloodsuckers’ tactics, hunters could be proactive and take advantage of the\nchaos to deal with their enemies. They might attack vampire havens or interests\n(corporations, warehouses) under the guise of “looting” or “terrorism.” Alterna-\ntively, hunters might see this as a time to build bridges. The Merciful might save\nvampires from angry mobs, and Visionary hunters might recruit the undead for\ninformation — or be recruited by vampires to get close to other monstrous targets.\nSHAPECHANGERS\nDo changers enter mainstream society? Do they declare war on humans, hoping\nto remove them from the world so as to truly save it? Or do the creatures hope to\nannounce their existence to ask for — or demand — cooperation in salvaging\nreality? Some shapechangers (be they werewolves, rat-men or cat-changers) might\ndecide to damn it all and attempt to hasten the coming doom rather than allay it,\nin search of a clean break.\nDo hunters attempt to stem the tide of beast-men with violence? Do they see\nthese aberrations and decide that the monsters have brought about the last days? Is\nit possible that the two could form a tenuous alliance? Both consider themselves\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n196\n196\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nprotectors of the world, at least more so than many denizens of the world do. Hunters\nhave some domain over protecting people, and werewolves have some domain over\nprotecting wild places. Would this commonality allow an alliance?\nWITCHES\nWhat could Armageddon spell for manipulators? Many witches seek out global\n“ascension,” which involves the masses suddenly awaking with belief and acceptance that\nreality is utterly flexible. Do these last days provide mages with that possibility? Can they\nopen collective human consciousness? Does cataclysm blast open the doors of perception\nfor every human being? Would such awareness allow people to see monsters for what they\nare and free hunters to operate openly? Could public understanding leave monsters exposed\nand vulnerable, making wizardly and hunter goals akin at the end of the world?\nUltimately, if previously ordinary people start awakening into magical powers,\nhow do hunters respond? Is the phenomenon indicative of the plague of monsters\nthat rises out of Armageddon? Are these newly made mages friends, enemies or\nsomething to watch from a distance? What if hunters’ friends or loved ones awaken?\nMORTALS\nThere are six billion people on Earth. Humanity has unwittingly had a\nrelationship with monsters for its entire existence. People are food for vampires,\nbreeding stock for shapeshifters, playthings for manipulators, sources of passion for\nspirits and worshippers for the infernal. And yet, mankind has remained ignorant of\nthe abuses that it’s suffered. We’ve been kept confused and ignorant, always left to\nwonder why a little voice warns us to be afraid of the dark. With the End Times here,\ndoes humanity’s place change?\nNow is the ideal time to shatter mankind’s ignorance of monsters. Any mystical\nveil that keeps people deaf and dumb might simply collapse, allowing the masses to\nsee creatures for what they are. (This wouldn’t be the same thing as hunters’ second\nsight, but a person wouldn’t forget or rationalize away seeing a man change into a\nwolf. He would understand it and be horrified by it.) This revelation might allow\nhunters to rally people to their cause. The outrage and revulsion experienced by the\nmasses could be harnessed and turned against the supernatural. But it could backfire,\ntoo. Fearful (or enterprising) folks, always afflicted with self-interest, might side with\nmonsters in an effort to pick the winning “team.” What can hunters do when regular\npeople, untouched by monstrous taint, stand in the way of their goals? Can regular\nfolks be spared, or must they become casualties of war?\nYou might have the masses remain in complete ignorance of the truth. Mankind’s\nlong-standing blindness is resilient, even when monsters and hunters act openly. The\nsupernatural veil might keep people blind or they might subconsciously refuse to see\nwhat goes on before them. The world is falling apart, but in “understandable” terms —\nearthquakes, civil strife, war. It’s certainly not due to “monsters.” It could be that\ncreatures still operate in the shadows. They conduct annihilation unseen, except by\nthe imbued. If monsters fear that warring in the streets will cause the human herd to\nrise up and destroy them, beasts will continue their secret maneuvers, now intended\nto save themselves at the end or to emerge as the new powers that be. And then, there’s\na certain comfort and confidence that comes in pulling puppet-strings from behind the\nscenes. Some monsters have done it for so long they know no other existence and can’t\nhelp themselves now, even when their doom is imminent. The result is a humanity that\nunwittingly remains controlled up until the last.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n197\nCHAPTER SIX\n197\nAPOCALYPTIC SIGNS\nFor those gifted (or paranoid) enough to see them, there are hints of the\nimpending end in all things… in the books of the Bible, the patterns of birds in the\nsky, in the headline bar on CNN. Armageddon is coming, foreshadowed through\nsecret warnings and premonitions. As Storyteller, you may use such tools as the Book\nof Revelation or Fyodor’s Apocrypha as evidence for characters that the last days have\ntruly arrived. Application of these interpretive signs gives an apocalyptic chronicle\nweight. Instead of being some random, haphazard affair, the end feels like something\nthat’s been planned by a calculating hand and has culminated for ages.\nHunters (those of Vision creeds in particular) might seek out such prophecy and\nportent in hopes of understanding and averting the end. Those without the\nbackground or access might not be interested in the signs of literature, but they could\nbuild theories based on news reports, public trends or urban legends. At first, these\nomens might not seem too serious, at least until they start coming true.\nFYODOR’S APOCRYPHA\nThe Visionary Fyodor is responsible for the rambling collection of prophetic\nmusings typically called Apocrypha. The Hermit Violin99 is responsible for putting\nthe collection together and disseminating it to the general hunter population. The\nhaphazardly termed “book” reads like a lunatic’s rumination on what it means to be\nchosen, what the history of the imbued might be, and where the future of the world\ncould lead. It’s this last part that’s potentially important to your game.\nFyodor describes many scenarios — both beginning and end — that could come\nto pass in an apocalyptic chronicle. A character with a copy of the book could interpret\njust about any occurrence in the last days as applicable to the warnings in the text, no\nmatter how coincidental or damning the comparison seems. You, as Storyteller, might\nwant to orchestrate events that match the prophecies. Do you follow Fyodor’s events\nto the letter, making them fairly obvious? Do you allow the events to occur but disguise\nthem behind metaphor and musing? Do you invoke one or two events but allow the\nrest to fall to the wayside, leaving hunters confused about what could happen next?\nWhat events from the book happen, and how do you present them in game?\nOMENS AND PORTENTS\nWritten prophecy or science alone doesn’t decide indications of the end.\nThey’re also inspired by superstition, perhaps passed culturally like urban legends.\nA simple omen, one most everyone knows, is that it’s bad luck for a black cat to cross\nyour path. The message is simple, direct and somewhat foreboding. These kinds of\nill-fated occurrences can pepper your game before Armageddon begins, and con-\ntinue to happen thereafter.\nSigns pointing to the last days could involve anything: a blood-red moon, a\ndrastic increase in crime rate, a funny taste to the water. And don’t be afraid to make\nit personal, going so far as to encourage players to explore their own superstitions.\nDoes an Avenger feel a sense of cosmic apprehension when his favorite sturdy\nweapon falls apart in his hands? Does a Defender who loses her good-luck charm\nsense some intrinsic warning? A Redeemer might freak out over the fact that no\nmonster has been able to look her in the eye for the last month, like they’re all afraid.\nA Wayward might be convinced that he has to walk out of each battle with a new\nscar. He’s come out of the last several fights clean, and that’s a bad sign. Shadows look\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n198\n198\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\na little darker, the sun constantly seems dim, police sirens sound throughout the\nnight like they never have before. Maybe local hunter activity seems overly frenzied\nand bloodthirsty. Almost any ominous event or trend can suggest bad tidings to\nsensitive imbued, hinting at what’s to come in a Judgment Day chronicle.\nHUNTER-NET\nEvery hunter is like a small piece of a riddle’s answer, written on slips of paper\nand cast to the wind. They’re all over the world, and each might individually hold\none tiny part of the truth. Each hunter potentially knows a little bit of the collective\nnature and the fate of the world, and each imbued has a different answer — some\nright, some wrong. Hunter-net is useful because all of these little truths can come\ntogether and provide a better (though incomplete) answer. You can also use hunter-\nnet to disseminate the “realities” of Armageddon. What one hunter encounters in\nSacramento is probably quite different from what another undergoes in Jerusalem.\nThe first might see a “plague of flies” descend upon his hometown, while the other\nwrites about a magician that spoke of the “approaching Lord of the Flies.” A\npotential connection emerges, but only a tenuous one that requires characters to\nexplore and research further. What clues to the end do different posters offer,\nwhether they know it or not, and how can those pieces be sorted out?\nHunter-net is also an excellent place to disseminate false or misunderstood\ninformation, or to lead characters astray about the truth of the end. What if the\naforementioned hunter mistranslated what the magician said? Or what if an extremist\nlike God45 writes a grand dissertation on the “cancer of the president” and demands\nthat the leader of the free world be assassinated? Could even the most conservative\nhunters fall in line with a madman’s online explanation of Armageddon?\nMONSTERS\nThis is the World of Darkness. Monsters are probably complicit in the end to\nsome degree. If they’re not the cause, they’re a symptom. It’s possible that some\nmonsters are able to give hunters insight into the architecture of the last days\n(intentionally or inadvertently). Granted, they don’t have to be right. While\nmonsters have their own glimpses, they should be far from the whole picture. But\nsuch suggestions can hold the seeds of truth and be springboards from which hunters\nsee more of what’s really going on.\nThe Merciful might learn from shapechanger kin about some awful “red star”\nin the sky that’s secretly the eye of an ancient beast coming to consume the world.\nZealots putting the torch to a nest of leeches might find blood-spattered graffiti —\nurban prophecy about vampires rising up against humans. A Visionary reading\nforbidden texts stolen from a demon could learn secrets about the end of the world.\nMonsters have their own distorted views of Armageddon and its causes, and\nhunters can be exposed to them, but the imbued must always remember the source.\nGod forbid that a monster’s insights into the end actually hasten the last days when\nacted upon.\nSCIENCE\nWhether it means to or not, science, does a lot of doomsaying. For every article\nor pronouncement that researchers work toward a new drug or cure, there’s a\ndeclaration that a meteor is heading toward Earth, that a new form of pneumonia\nspreads like wildfire, or that no country in the world is prepared for a biological or\nchemical attack. In conjunction with mass media, science constantly predicts our\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n199\nCHAPTER SIX\n199\ndemise with what would appear to be hard evidence. This isn’t some guy on an island\nspouting off about a Great Dragon trying to seduce the moral majority. These are\npresumably erudite, academic individuals who hold “truth” in their hands. The\nquestion is, can you use this kind of fatalism in your end chronicle?\nYou don’t need to resort to such drastic scientific proclamations. An intensifi-\ncation of “weird” stories on the news might do the trick. You can use real-world\nexamples such as the strange half-extinction of honeybees a few years ago, outbreaks\nof hantavirus or cholera, or an increase in shark attacks. You can also make stuff up.\nWhat if birds start acting weird, attacking people like in Hitchcock’s film? What if\na prominent constellation such as Orion simply disappears from the sky? What\nhappens when dolphins go extinct, a new communicable disease is discovered or\ncrops across the Midwest are inexplicably wiped out? All of these things, which\narguably have scientific explanations, offer foreshadowing. You can use these events\nas imagery to imply the coming end, or you can have such tragedies occur during\nArmageddon as a sign that things have really gone wrong.\nDANGEROUS PATHS\nThe Heralds might not be the only game in town when it comes to patrons for the\nimbued. In the “official” World of Darkness, the Heralds have attempted to offer enough\npower to select members of humanity to let them put the world back into balance without\ngranting them so much power that they become corrupt (thus a part of the problem). If\nthe Storyteller is willing to add another element to her saga, this attention on the part\nof the Messengers might also draw the attention, and intervention, of other, more\nextreme powers: the divine, the corrupt or even the power of human potential unleashed.\nImbued characters do not lightly come to follow any of these paths. Only those\nwho reach the pinnacle of their Virtues or somehow come to the direct attention of\nthese entities (Storyteller’s discretion) have any chance of reaching this status, and\neven then, it is not guaranteed. Storytellers should make sure that suitable roleplaying\nand soul-searching accompanies any potential “conversions.” They should also strip\na character of this status if he sought it for power as opposed to a way to express a\nfitting character development.\nSee the tabletop sourcebook Hunter: Fall From Grace for more on these types\nof imbued and how they come to arrive in these extreme situations.\nDIVINE INSPIRATION\nAs unknowable as the Heralds are, they stand as far beneath these forces of pure\ndivinity as mortals stand beneath them. These divine forces choose only the\nworthiest and most dedicated of hunters — those who qualify for an Exalted-level\nedge and pass the ordeals set by the divine spirits without losing their ways. The\ncombination of divine tests and the derangements accrued acquiring 10 primary\nVirtue Traits usually produce hunters who are alienated from humanity in general,\nand often from the rest of the imbued as well. Do not mistake these divine spirits for\ncherubic guardian angels. Their goals and methods are beyond human morality, and\ntheir servants are perforce drawn from it as well.\nThose who qualify for divine patronage receive a flood of communication from\nthe Ministers and above in whatever form the hunter’s mind can fathom. This vision\ninforms her that her dedication has been recognized and that she will be rewarded\nwith even greater power if she is willing to serve them directly. If she agrees, they\ngrant her the powers and drawbacks listed here. If not, she continues as before. In\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n200\n200\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\neither case, the aftermath of her ordeals is likely to have placed her in dire straits. Of\ncourse, this is a book about the end of the world, so it’s all relative.\nDivine Edge: Servants of the divine gain a single divine edge. This edge is of\nExalted level and can be designed by the Storyteller, adapted from Fall From Grace\nor taken from the existing edges in Laws of the Reckoning. (A sample divine edge\nis provided.) Since divine edges are direct outpourings of divine power, they are\ndifferent from conventional edges. They are generally quite obvious, with light and/\nor thunder that anyone nearby will notice. Divine edges affect everyone equally —\ndistinctions of monsters, imbued and mortal are too subtle for these forces. Divine\nedges cost four Conviction Traits instead of two.\nPatron: Those who accept divine patronage receive Patron x 5, and start\nreceiving direct commands from beyond.\nDivine Aura: All other imbued within three paces of the character receive\nspillover messages from the Ministers as if they had Patron x 3. If these characters\nalready have three or more Patron Traits, they notice that the “volume” of the messages\nseems to be a little louder when they are near the divine hunter.\nConviction: If the hunter’s starting Conviction rating is less than 4, it is\npermanently raised to 4.\nPersonality: Nature and Demeanor become the same and must be chosen from\nAutocrat, Dreamer or Fanatic.\nDerangement: The hunter’s player must pick a derangement that best encap-\nsulates his character. Any other derangements no longer affect him, but this one\nremains and can no longer be suppressed by expending Willpower Traits. Even edges\ncannot calm his raging mind.\nWillpower: Simple, human victories no longer matter. The divine hunter\nregains Willpower Traits only from acting according to her new Nature and from\nachieving important victories in the path set by his divine patrons.\nINFERNAL CORRUPTION\nDangerous entities, cast from this universe by the divine forces, compose the\nother side of the battle. Filled with hatred for the worlds and people that spurned them,\nthey offer power to those who can do their work and prepare everything for their return,\nbit by bit. The forces of corruption will accept anyone who has the ability to further\ntheir goals and who allows them into their hearts — again, those who qualify for an\nExalted-level edge, as well as being open to what they offer. Typically, these creatures\napproach the imbued in a manner similar to the Heralds, but offering something\ndifferent — be it extra pain for the monsters, fewer problems with pylons or just the\nability to kick more ass. If the hunter refuses the offer, the corrupter might seek easier\nprey elsewhere or just wait and see if the hunter comes around. If the hunter agrees, he\nimmediately gains the horrific patronage of a corrupt master.\nShould an imbued accept this offer, he has access to the promised edge, but the\ncorrupting presence gains a toehold within his soul. The portion of the entity that\noccupies the demon is relatively minor. Killing the hunter is only enough to cause\nit temporary pain. It can see through the hunter and communicate with him as long\nas he does not have second sight active. As the relationship continues, the corrupter\nslowly increases its loathsome demands, both to break down the hunter’s resistance\nand to further its personal agenda. After the corrupt presence worms its way into the\nhunter, the following conditions apply.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n201\nCHAPTER SIX\n201\nCorrupt Edge: Corrupted imbued gain the use of a single corrupt edge as long as\ntheir master wishes it. This edge can be designed by the Storyteller for the character,\nadapted from Fall From Grace or taken from the existing edges in Laws of the\nReckoning. Because of their alien origin, corrupt edges are different from conven-\ntional edges. They can do things completely unlike other edges such as raise the dead,\nwarp reality and alter the hunter’s form. They are not subtle, and they instill horror and\nrevulsion in unprotected witnesses. Corrupt edges affect everyone equally, monsters,\nimbued and mortal alike. Corrupt edges cost four Conviction Traits instead of two.\nPatron: The possessing creature acts as Patron x 5 for the hunter, but the hunter\nloses all communication with the Heralds.\nSecond Sight: While he is using second sight, the corrupting presence is incapable\nof perceiving or affecting him in any way (including granting the corrupt edge).\nTaint: The corrupt hunter now registers as “wrong” to second sight and is affected\nby edges such as Ward that work on monsters. As the corruption spreads, the Storyteller\nmay declare that there are other signs of his fallen nature. This is permanent. Should\nthe corrupt hunter manage to expel her patron, the taint remains.\nRevulsion: Communion with such a malignant presence is more than the mortal\nmind can handle. At the end of any scene in which the hunter interacts extensively\nwith the corrupter or uses her corrupt edge, the player must make a Willpower\nChallenge against a difficulty of four Traits. Should she fail the test, she loses one\npermanent Willpower Trait as her mind succumbs to this assault. When the hunter\nloses her last Willpower Trait, her soul is destroyed and the horrific presence takes\ncommand of her body. Willpower may be spent to retest this challenge.\nHUMAN POTENTIAL\nAs terrifying as divine and corrupt hunters are, certain imbued take an even\nmore extreme path: the path of the independent. Independent hunters are unwilling\nto become a conduit for divine or corrupt forces — or, rarely, no one ever thought\nto ask — but they have the same fanatical drive (and 10 primary Virtue Traits and\na derangement). These hunters become the hunt incarnate and transcend the\nlimitations the Heralds normally place upon their servants in the process. While the\nbreakthrough itself should be a dramatic event, the steps leading to it can take place\nover as long a time as the chronicle allows.\nFirst, the hunter’s Nature becomes either Autocrat, Fanatic or Perfectionist as the\nhunt itself consumes the hunter. Later, his Demeanor changes to match his nature as\nhe stops devoting the effort to hiding what he is. Then, after the character has\nestablished his ultimate commitment to stopping the monsters, something happens —\nsome critical event that the hunter has to act upon, but for all his power, cannot. At\nthat moment, through a supreme act of will, he forces his way through to a higher level\nof power and understanding. Once that happens, the following conditions apply:\nExaltedEdge: The hunter gains use of a single Exalted-level edge. This edge can\nbe designed by the Storyteller for the character or adapted from the existing edges\nin Laws of the Reckoning, but it must be appropriate to the hunter’s creed and\nNature. It was his commitment to the creed that brought him to this point.\nPatron: The experience of transcending the Messengers’ limitations shatters\nthe hunter’s natural barriers, giving him an effective Patron x 5. This increase does\nnot represent any additional attention from the Heralds, though, merely an increase\nin the imbued’s sensitivity to their messages and visions.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n202\n202\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nDedication: The hunter’s manifest adherence to his crusade is so strong that it\nis almost impossible to sway him from his chosen task. The hunter always resists\nsupernatural powers targeted at him as if he were using the sight. The hunter must\nstill spend a Conviction Trait to use the sight for the recognition of monsters.\nVirtues: The hunter has reached the pinnacle of his personal development and\ncan no longer purchase new Virtue Traits. Unspent Virtue Traits from before can\nstill be used to purchase new edges.\nDisturbing Presence: The hunter has moved so far from humanity that he no\nlonger reacts to it in a meaningful way, and it is very obvious. The hunter is\nautomatically five Traits down in any Social Challenge involving regular humans,\nlesser imbued and the more human monsters. More inhuman creatures — powerful\nmonsters and other hunters of this level — are different enough that he can still use\nall of his Social Traits on them.\nCompulsion: Even beyond the hunter’s derangements, he now sees the world\nthrough the focus of his primary Virtue. Once every other session, the Storyteller can\ndirect an independent hunter to manifest his primary Virtue. Merciful hunters can\nbe told that they must protect a certain creature from all harm, regardless of the\ncircumstances. Visionary hunters may be told a certain fact and must act upon it with\ntheir full determination. Zealous hunters may be directed at a certain target that they\nmust single out for punishment.\nWillpower: Simple, human victories no longer matter. The divine hunter\nregains Willpower Traits only from acting according to her new Nature and from\nachieving important victories in the path set by her divine patrons.\nTHE DAY AFTER\nIf your story doesn’t lead to utter ruin, what remains? Maybe humanity is\nenslaved by demons, discarnate spirits or by ancient vampires. What place do\nhunters have in this grisly New World Order? Are they hunted in turn? Are they\nenslaved along with everyone else, but willing lead a revolt? Do they operate in\nclandestine cabals and guerrilla groups, making attacks on monstrous overlords? Do\nhunters and humans cooperate to break monsters’ grip on the world? Is it creatures\nthat are destroyed or enslaved? Perhaps monsters are left scattered, going to ground\nto rise again one day.\nIf monsters are all destroyed, driven off or placated, does the world assume an\nEdenic state? What does this new utopia look like? While characters might seek such\na happy ending, they might also have no place in it — at least, not as imbued. Are their\ngifts revoked once the menace is thwarted? Perhaps they’re allowed to return to\nnormal, ordinary lives (if that’s even possible after all they’ve seen and done). Or\nmaybe hunters are given a new role by the Messengers — leaders. Could the Heralds\ncharge the imbued with the responsibility of shepherding society into a new Golden\nAge. How successful might they be? Do hunters assume the role naturally, or do they\nsink into megalomania and wear the mask that monsters once did? It’s possible that\nhunters cannot agree and disparate groups fall into civil war. Does one hunter side fight\nfor humanity and another for the “right” to abuse the mortal populace? Or do all groups\nsimply wage war over a selfish slice of the pie, just as monsters once did? Do bystanders\nbecome the new hunters, going against the monstrous heirs of the new order?\nThe end of the world doesn’t need to mean the end of your game. The path is\nwide open and the territory uncharted.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n203\nCHAPTER SIX\n203\nCLEANSING FIRES\nOverview: As civilization crumbles into anarchy, supernatural creatures oper-\nate openly, claiming victims and running death camps to house their prey. The old\norder is gone, and with it the need for restraint. Now is the time to rise up and take\nthe bastards down, cleansing the city — and perhaps the world — of evil.\n“Cleansing Fires” is a scenario that emphasizes the Zeal Virtue. In the final days,\nthe monsters and supernatural creatures grow desperate, throwing away their\ndisguises and political power struggles. Now they fight for survival any way they can.\nThe characters have a chance to throw the monsters down and prevent their\nsurvival, clearing their city of the supernatural so that predation and horror finally\ncease. Negotiation and redemption are no longer priorities — it’s all-out war. This\nis a straightforward, fairly linear story of warfare. Complexity doesn’t derive from\nevents, it arises from the personalities and actions of the hunters themselves, and\nfrom the choices they make.\nTHINGS FALL APART\nSociety has collapsed. The corruption of the supernatural, hidden under the\nskin of civilization for so long, has finally burst forth and infected reality. Undead\nhordes rampage through the streets, killing and destroying in mindless rage.\nVampires wage war with each other over precious blood and slaves. Witches throw\noff their guise of normality and attempt to win over armies of acolytes in their quest\nfor ultimate power. Monsters and nightmares rip cities apart and murder thousands,\neven millions, in pursuit of incomprehensible horror. The truth is revealed, showing\nthe sick and impossible face behind the lies.\nGovernment, business and society crumble with the revelation of the super-\nnatural. Riots and mass suicides are just the start. What really causes society’s\ndownfall is the disintegration of its support structure as hysterical and angry citizens\nstop obeying the rules and believing in the law. Like a nation that’s lost a war, society\nlies in ruins, and formerly happy and affluent citizens scramble for basic survival.\nAcross America — across the world — the situation is the same. Governments\nstill control weapons and armies, police and firemen, but now they are openly in the\nservice of dark powers. The media, if it still exists, broadcasts nothing but propa-\nganda. Since few cities have electricity, though, few can hear the lies anyway. Money\nmeans nothing, prestige means nothing, hope means nothing. All that matters is\nfood, shelter, weapons and endurance.\nHunters are not protected from civilization’s destruction. They might even\ncontribute to it by exposing the secrets of the supernatural. Their jobs are gone,\ntheir homes destroyed, their families starving. All that they had sought to protect\nhas been washed away in a sea of chaos and blood. Storytellers might wish to spend\nseveral chapters simply dealing with matters of mundane survival, testing the\nmettle of the imbued in a world in which the certainties and protection of modern\nlife has disintegrated.\nA CALL TO ARMS\nAs the imbued attempt to survive and protect themselves and their loved ones,\na bigger picture emerges. Monsters are in the open now, preying upon surviving\nhumans. If the hunters want to make a real difference, they have to protect their\nhomes. The Storyteller can use any of the following hooks to get the scenario started.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n204\n204\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n• A character’s friend, family member or ally is captured by a monster,\nbecoming a shapechanger’s brood mare or a demon’s worshipper. In rescuing the\nfriend, the hunters see that the creature dispenses with secrecy and seeks to rule the\nruined city with an iron fist. The only way to fight back effectively against the\ncreature (and the other horrors overtaking the city) is to use the same tactics.\n• Another hunter asks the characters for assistance in fighting back against\nmonsters, or he gives them information about the way the horrors now operate. The\nneedy hunter is convinced that the rules have changed; it’s time to fight the darkness\npublicly. The characters must be careful, however, that their ally’s information isn’t\nslanted toward her own agenda.\n• Hunters of the Zeal creeds or with a high Zeal rating receive a vision, in which\nthe city is razed to the ground. From the rubble erupts a geyser of blood, from which\nleap hideous, shadowy forms. Out of the wreckage emerge human forms, wreathed\nin flames and wielding weapons of light, to do battle. Many of the human forms are\ndestroyed, but the shadows are wiped out. In the aftermath, the flaming warriors lead\na stream of refugees to the outside world. Along with the vision comes a message:\n“STAND AGAINST THE DARKNESS,” “WIPE THE CORRUPTION FROM\nTHE WORLD,” or “CLEANSE THE EARTH THAT IS TO COME.”\nIt’s time for the last and final battle with the forces of darkness, and this time,\nthe imbued have an advantage they didn’t enjoy before. All the impediments to the\nhunt that civilization once posed are gone. No police to avoid. No skepticism to\novercome. No need for secrecy. This is open warfare, not a covert operation. The\ncharacters are free to break the old rules with impunity.\nOf course, so are their opponents.\nCHOOSE YOUR TARGETS\nJust what kind of opposition the hunters face in this war depends on the events\nof your chronicle to date. As Storyteller, you’ve already developed a picture of what\ncreatures and forces exist in the characters’ home city, forces they might have\ncontended with frequently in the past. New creatures and dangers appear and take\nadvantage of the chaos, and some established horrors could fall in the first days of\nanarchy. But for the most part, the creatures arrayed against the hunters now are those\nthat have dominated the chronicle to date. What changes is the methods and openness\nof these creatures, who can now commit atrocities without the need for secrecy.\nThe biggest thing that’s likely to change is the creation of territories — districts\nopenly controlled by a monster or group of monsters, where any human survivors are\nenslaved or murdered. Almost all the creatures of the World of Darkness need humans\nfor some reason, be it food, energy or simply for the gratification of desires. Similarly,\ncreatures crave power and influence, perhaps in hopes of saving themselves, or because\nruling a pocket kingdom or tattered empire satisfies their obsession with dominance.\nNaturally, it is important that each such domain have its own feel, in keeping with\nthe nature of its new “lords.” A visit to enemy territory should be a powerful and\nunnerving experience for the characters. Go all out when conveying the magnitude of\nwhat has occurred. On top of any descriptions you feel are necessary, don’t be afraid to\nuse a lot of props, costuming, visual aids, music and set dressing to get just the mood you\ndesire. A neighborhood destroyed by roving shapechanger packs that rule by force should\nhave a distinctly different feel from a domain under the sway of a hypnotic bloodsucker,\nfor instance, and both should be quite different from a neighborhood living in fear of\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n205\nCHAPTER SIX\n205\nswarms of malicious ghosts. If the players feel as though the scene or session could just\nas easily be taking place in any other location you’ve used in the past, something has gone\nvery wrong. Fortunately, unless the chronicle is set entirely inside one of these territories,\nyou should have the time to prepare appropriately for sessions that take place “on the\ninside,” which should help keep such experiences fresh and compelling.\nNever forget that having Narrator characters portraying residents and victims\nis your most valuable tool for providing the players with information on these\nterritories, not to mention underscoring the horrific nature of the fate that has\nbefallen the hapless residents. Work with your Narrators well in advance to come up\nwith a set of strange behaviors, taboos or other quirks based on the adjustments their\ncharacters have made to living under monstrous rule. Unless the creature exerts\nabsolute control every second of every day, you’re better off mixing small habits with\nmore serious ones when you can. While having all the residents reduced to shuffling\ndrones chanting the name of their master can be extremely unsettling, it also\nseverely limits the amount of possible roleplaying and interaction. It can be just as\neerie to have a seemingly normal conversation with a resident, only to have him\nmake a special sign every time the name of his master is mentioned or suddenly recite\na long passage or prayer from memory whenever a certain topic comes up.\nWhat’s more, try to tailor the characters’ habits to the type of creature that is\nin control. Not only does that add to the depth of what has happened, but it also\nmight provide perceptive characters with some additional information about the\nruling creature’s strengths and weaknesses. For example, residents of a territory\ncontrolled by creatures with superior senses might have abandoned all verbal\ncommunication for fear of being overheard, writing down everything instead.\nHapless mortals controlled by a powerful ghost who died in a fire might all exhibit\nthe creature’s insane phobia of open flame.\nIn game terms, the hunters’ ability to exert Influence in a monster’s territory will\nprobably suffer. For each territory, the Storyteller may give the creature in control\nspecial Territory Influence to represent its control over the area. The good news is that\nin order to maintain the level of control implicit in its Influence, the monster must\nkeep his domain somewhat organized. This means that even if things are in total chaos\neverywhere else, and Influence is useless throughout the rest of the city, the Influence\nratings of others (such as hunters) should drop to only one Trait less than the domain’s\nmaster’s Influence. The bad news is that any attempt to use Influence in the territory\nnow calls for a Social Challenge against the Social Traits of the monster in control, and\nif the player fails the challenge, the monster may learn of her attempt. Also, external\nInfluence lasts only as long as the institutions it affects still exist. If a warlock replaces\nthe police with steam-powered robots, any attempt to use Police Influence within its\ndomain is futile.\nExampleofPlay:ApowerfulbloodsuckerhastakencontrolovermostofPhiladelphia’s\nOldCity,gaininganeffective Territory Influencex3.Sam,aMartyrholedupinasafehouse\nby the art museum, needs to obtain more ammunition for his team, and his supplier in\nUniversity City is accepting only gold.

A portion of\nthe pre- and post-session planning should go toward discussing the various schemes and\nhow the different masters are reacting to what the players and other creatures are doing.\nThe following creatures all have reasons for taking territories throughout the\ncity. Other beings might also try to stake out turf for their own reasons — or they\ncould simply rampage through the city, killing and destroying anything in their path.\nGhosts/Walking Dead: The spirits of the dead draw strength from human\nemotion, especially negative emotion. Ghosts might assemble cults of followers,\npossessing hosts temporarily and drinking the pain and misery of their slaves.\nWalking dead are inclined to simple destruction and the fear and terror their victims\nfeel. The territories of these beings are probably the most disorganized and chaotic\nof all, focusing on graveyards, cemeteries and disaster sites.\nVampires: The bloodsuckers might now act openly, without fear of discovery,\nbut they must also compete with their own kind for precious blood. Competition\nbetween vampire warlords is likely to be fierce, and well-armed ghouls and slaves\npatrol various territories. Some vampires set up “blood camps,” prisons for survivors\nand mortals. Established in defensible locations such as hospitals and jails, these\ncamps are packed with mortals who are (comparatively) well fed and protected —\nuntil undead commandants come to claim more victims.\nShapechangers: Were-creatures draw power from nature rather than from\nhumans, so they set up territories in parks and wild spaces with their sacred places\nat the center. Shapechangers do need humans for one reason, though — as breeding\nstock. While were-creatures are unlikely to try to expand their territories, they\naggressively raid human refuges for new breeding captives or simply for prey.\nWarlocks: Manipulators and wizards lose many of their advantages, influence and\npurpose with the fall of the civilization that concealed them. But now they can practice\ntheir magic freely, unfettered by the collective disbelief of human civilization. In these\nhorrific End Times, people realize that anything is possible. Warlocks left in the city\nattempt to gather acolytes who can assist in magic rituals and protect their masters from\ndanger. Witches might also gather legions of followers with promises and bribes, but they\naren’t likely to be aggressive or expansionist against one another, unless a warlock sends\nout raiding parties to steal food, supplies or artifacts needed for his magic.\nBLOCK BY BLOCK\nOnce the characters have identified their enemies, the task is simple. Uncom-\nplicated, that is, but not easy. Taking back the city is a matter of strategy, supply lines\nand zones of control — reclaiming locations that monsters control and destroying\ntheir power bases. The hunters are guerrillas taking on an invading army, or they are\ninvaders themselves. They need every weapon they possess to reclaim their home.\nTaking a territory involves more than just guns and fight scenes. The creatures\ncontrolling and patrolling these kingdoms have a great deal to lose, and they guard\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n207\nCHAPTER SIX\n207\nthemselves with barricades, soldiers and mortal hostages. The three Zeal creeds have\ndifferent roles to play in this war, and an effective campaign against the darkness\ndemands that hunters do what they do best.\nOf course, skill and personality have at least as big a role here as a hunter’s\ncreed does. A Martyr might possess tactical skills and an insightful mind, and play\nthe part of a leader in the war. An Innocent may care so much for the refugees in\nher care that she does anything to protect them, fighting attackers in the manner\nof a Defender. The creeds have natural ability in some areas, thanks to their Virtues\nand edges, but that doesn’t override the identity of a person or make a hunter\n“wrong” for the role he assumes.\nAvengers: These hunters are the front-line soldiers of the war, the first in and the\nlast out. With their offensive, combat-focused edges, Avengers are best suited to one-on-\none combat with the supernatural and its minions. Before that point is reached, however,\nAvengers need to focus on gaining access to an enemy’s territory, scouting out possible\navenues of entry (and escape), and on slowly wearing down monsters’ followers and\ndefenses. These are the most hazardous roles a hunter can play in this scenario, and an\nAvenger who is careless or lacks dedication will soon be killed. Avengers who want to\nsurvive must explore their anger, that need for vengeance burning away their human\nweaknesses— and running the risk of losing their humanity in the process. The war will\nbring many opportunities for these hunters to gain Conviction and increase their Virtues.\nMadness might be an inevitable side effect of victory.\nDefenders: While Avengers are charged with destroying the enemy, Defenders\nhave an equally important task: protecting the home front. The protectors of the\nwar, Defenders must safeguard hunters’ own territory from attack and reprisal. That\nrole places them in constant danger — and might drive them to madness before the\nwar is done, too. Defenders are also invaluable in rescuing people who have been\ncaptured or enslaved. Rescuing the downtrodden is a challenging obligation,\ninvolving anything from silently leading chains of refugees through the sewers to\nramming barricades with trucks and pulling hostages out through a hail of gunfire.\nAnd once refugees are safe, Defenders must continue to protect them so that former\ncaptors (or other creatures) cannot take advantage again.\nJudges: If Avengers are soldiers and Defenders are guardians, Judges are officers\nand leaders, the tactical planners and decision-makers of the war. It falls to Judges\nto decide how to conduct attacks, what defenses and resources to target, and how to\nweaken the enemy before the final confrontation. This role demands data and\nintelligence. Judges need to endanger themselves to ferret out enemies’ secrets.\nJudges might also decide how a group’s resources are best used and maintained, and\nthey must consider how to keep the imbued supplied and protected. Judges aren’t as\nprevalent on the front lines as Avengers or even Defenders are, but their role is\ndemanding nonetheless. As the commanding officers of the war, Judges are called\nupon to make the hard choices — who undertakes missions, who gets rescued, who\ngets left behind, who lives and who dies. It’s a role that can take a heavy toll on a\nhunter’s morale and sanity. Judges might be pushed to the edge and beyond by the\nburden of their responsibilities.\nWAR STORIES\nAs the scenario progresses, the characters might make headway against the\nmonsters, retaking territory and casting down their dark masters. But a story that’s\nsimply raid after raid is both boring and unrealistic. The following are suggestions for\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n208\n208\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\ndevelopments and events to keep the story moving, issues with which hunters must\ndeal on the way to the final chapter, the final battle with the darkness.\nSupply Lines: To continue the battle, the imbued need constant aid and\nsupplies: weapons, medicine, equipment and simple food and shelter. These re-\nsources must be found or created, but searching for them can take up all the “spare”\ntime a hunter has. And once these necessities are found, they must be protected lest\nthe enemy — or other humans — steal them.\nThe Home Front: Casting an undead tyrant down is just the beginning of the\njob. An enemy’s territory can’t be left empty — it’s a resource that must be used by\nthe imbued, lest it be claimed by a different enemy. Once a territory is taken, it must\nbe populated with refugees and survivors, the human supporters and aides of the\nimbued. Resources must be found to feed, clothe and shelter these people. Fresh\nwater and sanitation must be provided, and borders must be protected from invasion.\nNew Faces: As one enemy is cast down, another might take its place. New\nmonsters could enter the city looking for a chance to grab power, while others (such\nas the walking dead) might simply be created in the wake of a battle. At the same time,\npotential new allies could appear, from imbued outsiders come to fight for the\ncharacters’ cause to courageous refugees prepared to go against the enemy. But even\nthese allies can pose problems as precious resources are stretched ever thinner to\nprovide for them. And do other hunters really have the same goals as the characters?\nBlack Allegiances: Faced with attack from the imbued, supernatural beings\nmight band together to fight back. While these creatures hate each other and\ncompete for followers and resources, they fear or hate the characters more. Besieged\nenemies might attempt to turn the tables, launching attacks on hunter territories,\nor bringing in allies of their own to bolster forces for a decisive strike.\nTHE OTHER CREEDS\n“Cleansing Fires” emphasizes the role and purpose of the Zeal Virtue, to wipe\naway the infection of the supernatural from this world and prevent it from\ncorrupting anything that rises anew. But the other creeds and Virtues have a part\nto play in this war. There are many opportunities for non-Zealot characters to get\ninvolved in this scenario.\nThe Merciful: These hunters focus on aiding the war effort through\nintelligence, diplomacy and providing hope when all seems lost. Innocents can\ngather information through scouting raids and negotiate with one enemy to\nfight another. Martyrs could rally hunters and ordinary people alike, filling\nhearts with hope through courage and sacrifice. Redeemers might tend to the\nwounded and persuade enemies to surrender or withdraw with the promise of\nforgiveness or salvation.\nThe Visionary: War is more than fighting, it’s information. It’s purpose,\nand that’s what these hunters provide. Hermits can hang back and gather\ninsights with their edges, providing the data needed to draw up battle plans.\nVisionaries can develop long-term strategies, coordinating their fellows and\nmaking sure each battle is a step toward winning the war. And Waywards could\ninspire and direct from the front lines, demonstrating savage power. (The price\nof that effectiveness, though, could be ordinary people, their lives used as bait\nor weapons.)\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n209\nCHAPTER SIX\n209\nWAR’S END\nThe purpose of this scenario is simple: Take back the city and cast out or destroy\nsupernatural evil. War is never a simple affair, however. The imbued are likely to\nsuffer terrible casualties, even if they gain the upper hand. Success demands sacrifice\nand brings with it new complications and obstacles. Ultimately, it comes down to\na single bid — a last stand, a final battle against the darkness.\nNo matter how the war has been fought thus far, this is the hardest battle of all.\nThe final enemy (whoever that might be) has had the opportunity to conserve its\nresources, to prepare and plan for this, its last stand. The characters, on the other\nhand, have fought battle after battle in their campaign and are bound to have paid\na heavy price in sanity and lives.\nAs Storyteller, you need to make this battle matter. It’s time to pull out all the\nstops and show the hunters the fight of their lives. The enemy fights dirty and\ndesperately, and the imbued must do the same to have a hope of winning. This is\nthe final battle of a war story, and not everyone can make it out alive. In fact, none\nof the characters might live. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. Tragic endings are\nall too possible in Reckoning. Even if all the imbued die, the battle might not be\nlost. Not if the refugees and survivors they have cared for rise up and fight in\nmemory of their protectors.\nWhen the dust settles and the last of the dead have been carted from the\nbattlefield, what then? Do the Messengers appear in a burst of light and say “well\ndone” to the survivors? Probably not. What’s more likely is that nothing happens at\nall. The city is cleansed. If other imbued elsewhere have successfully waged similar\ncampaigns, the country might be free of supernatural contamination. The hunters\nhave the remains of a society under them, a nation of survivors who seek leaders. The\ncharacters can protect that realm and work to stop the darkness from returning.\nEven if the imbued win their battle, the war isn’t necessarily over. Who knows\nwhat’s happening across the rest of the world? Perhaps the end is inevitable; nothing\ncan hold it back. The hunters might have liberated their city only to have it be\ndestroyed by an unstoppable Armageddon. Or perhaps the city is an island of weak\nand fading light in a sea of darkness and corruption. And, of course, there’s the\nchance that the characters fall in battle and the city is not claimed from monsters.\nYou decide what happens after the battle. The imbued have done all that they\ncan; all that a band of fragile and fallible humans can achieve in the final days. What\nhappens after that might be out of their hands. All they can hope is that their blood,\nsweat and tears have wiped the sins from one world and consecrated a new, pure one.\nGLIMMER OF HOPE\nOverview: As the world burns, a miracle happens. A power is unleashed that\ncan heal monsters of their corruption, returning them to a normal human state. The\nimbued become the custodians of this power as supernatural creatures flock to their\ncity to be saved, or the characters might seek to destroy this new and awesome power.\n“Glimmer of Hope” emphasizes the Mercy Virtue. The coming Armageddon\nshatters the normal boundaries of reality. Events that were once impossible now come\nto pass. The possibility of healing or pardoning monsters is a reality, and the characters\ncontrol that power. But this gift can’t be used on a whim. It’s a dwindling resource that\nmust be guarded and protected. To the characters falls the responsibility of deciding\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n210\n210\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nwhich monsters may be saved and which must be turned aside — where mercy can be\noffered out and where it must be withheld. The story focuses on interaction between\nhunters and inhuman beings, on hard choices and heavy responsibilities.\nMIRACLE IN THE AFTERMATH\nIn the terror of the final days, it’s more than just human civilization that falls\napart. The wall between the possible and impossible crumbles, as does the barrier\nbetween the worlds of the living and dead. Anything can happen, and a miracle occurs\nin the characters’ city. It’s known as the glimmer— a power that can remove the taint\nof corruption from a supernatural creature. Under the glimmer’s light, a monster is\ncleansed of darkness, forgiven its sins and returned to humanity or allowed to pass\ninto peaceful oblivion.\n“Glimmer” is just convenient shorthand for describing the power of this\nscenario. You can call it anything you like, or not call it anything at all. Just what\nform the glimmer takes is for you to decide based on the needs of your chronicle. Here\nare a few suggestions.\n• An extremist Merciful hunter develops the power to heal monsters as an\nExalted-level edge. This hunter may be one of the players’ characters or a Storyteller\ncharacter. You should design an edge to encompass the effect, using the powers in\nother sourcebooks as guidelines. Expiate is a possible model, only the power at work\nhere could be more lasting. This edge may come from deep inside the possessor or\nfrom an external source (see Fall from Grace for more details). The power seems\nbenevolent, but it could be a gift from a corrupt or evil source that uses the imbued\nto weaken the supernatural opposition.\n• An extremist Redeemer battles a powerful creature, perhaps a demon,\nwarlock or other being with knowledge of spirit worlds. Both fall, and in their death\nthroes a fountain of light erupts, birthed from their spiritual power. This version of\nthe glimmer is a stationary field of mystic light. It emits a kind of spiritual gravity that\ndraws supernatural corruption to itself. It might be tall enough to reach into the sky\nlike a skyscraper or small enough to illuminate a room.\n• A scientist or technically minded hunter discovers a “cure” for supernatural\ncorruption, a serum made from unusual ingredients. The treatment shouldn’t work,\nbut somehow — in a world where the laws of physics and life fray — it does, purging\neven dead flesh of supernatural toxins. The cure cannot be made easily, however.\nPerhaps it’s based on chemicals found on a site of mystic activity, or only the inventor\ncan make it work and she isn’t sure how.\nNo matter what the glimmer is in your chronicle, the hunters are the ones who\nlearn of its existence. Perhaps the possessor of the power comes to them for help, or\na vision from the Messengers drives them to the discovery. Maybe they’re the ones\nto create this miracle in the first place. In any case, the characters are the first to find\nout about the glimmer. The first, but not the last.\nHEALING LIGHT\nWhatever form the glimmer takes in your chronicle, it possesses the same\nproperties — qualities that shape the course of the scenario. (You may, of course,\ndecide to change these features to better suit the story you want to tell.)\nItturnsmonstersintonormalhumans. Exposure to the glimmer eradicates any\nsupernatural properties of a being. (Depending on the form the glimmer takes, some\ncreatures might be immune. It’s hard to inject a ghost with a serum, for example.)\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n211\nCHAPTER SIX\n211\nVampires, warlocks, shapechangers and other “altered humans” become normal\npeople with no supernatural powers of any kind. Ghosts and the walking dead simply\ndie, their souls going on to some kind of final reward. Demons, nightmares and other\n“possessors” are expelled from their hosts (and pass into oblivion like ghosts), or they\nmerge permanently with their hosts to become normal humans.\nIt has no effect on the imbued. Hunters are completely unaffected by the\nglimmer. If it is a physical effect like a serum, it has no toxic or beneficial result when\nadministered. If it is a spiritual phenomenon like a column of healing light, it is not\naffected by edges and appears no different to second sight than to normal senses.\nEven if the glimmer has an effect on normal people, hunters are immune. They are\nthe custodians of this power, not the recipients, and they get no benefit from it.\nIt is a limited resource. The glimmer cannot simply be used to cure every\nmonster in the world. Every time the power is applied, its strength is diminished. The\nserum cannot be remade. The light fades. The possessing hunter’s vitality and sanity\nerodes. Only a select number of monsters can benefit from the glimmer, and it falls\nto the characters to decide which creatures should be saved. Most of the drama in\n“Glimmer of Hope” comes from the weight of responsibility, in deciding which\nmonsters will be saved and which will remain damned.\nItattractsmonsters. Somehow, the supernatural creatures of the world become\naware of the glimmer’s existence. This information might spread by mundane means,\nsuch as rumors of its power spreading through vampire or demon circles. The\nglimmer might send out a spiritual signal of sorts just by existing, so that monsters\nbecome instinctively aware of its properties. In any case, creatures soon learn of the\nglimmer and come to the city to take advantage of its power.\nThe characters are in control of immense power. But they can’t simply use it for\ntheir own advantage or as they please. They must decide which monsters are\ndeserving. And they can’t simply hide it and not use it, because monsters come to\nthem demanding to be healed (or to destroy it).\nPILGRIMAGE\nAttracted by the promise of salvation, creatures flood into the city, demanding\nor begging for the release of the glimmer. The hunters have to deal with this influx,\ncontrolling not only access to the source but also the damage creatures inflict on\nhuman refugees and inhabitants.\nThe following are some of the issues that hunters face. Others may emerge,\ndepending on what beings come for the glimmer’s blessing.\nIf monsters flock to the city, they have to stay somewhere. What effect does this\nsudden influx of people — not just monsters, but perhaps their human followers —\nhave on the ruined infrastructure of the city? Monsters such as vampires and ghosts\nthat prey on humans to survive can’t just stop while waiting for a chance at\nredemption. The hunters have to police their émigrés and keep them from destroy-\ning what’s left of the city.\nWhere do the creatures stay in the city? Some don’t need shelter or food, but they\nwant to stay close to the glimmer lest they miss a chance to be blessed. A shantytown of\nmonsters and their followers might spring up around the glimmer’s location. Such a town\nis a tense, dangerous place as its inhabitants vie for position and precious resources.\nMonsters who come to the city might not leave their old grudges and agendas\nbehind. Rivals and bitter enemies could be forced to wait side by side for access to\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n212\n212\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nthe glimmer. Violence between creatures is inevitable, and such clashes are bound\nto have a toll in human lives. Perhaps those outbreaks even injure or destroy other\ncreatures who deserved the glimmer’s healing.\nOf course, some monsters refuse to wait meekly for their turn at forgiveness.\nThey try to take control of the glimmer in some way, by seizing it or capturing the\nhunter who channels the power. More subtle creatures might attempt to win the\ncharacters’ favor, directing the glimmer toward their allies and minions and not at\ntheir enemies — or vice versa. The hunters need to defend the glimmer from the\nefforts of those who would steal or corrupt it.\nAnd what of the glimmer’s recipients, the creatures who are blessed? These\nnewly normal humans need food, water and shelter, resources that are already scarce\nin the damaged world of the final days. They also need protection from their enemies.\nMonsters (or other hunters) might seek to strike at a recovered monster now that she\nhas lost her power and defenses.\nGUARDING HOPE\nNot every creature in the world wants to be saved or cured by the glimmer. Many\nmonsters are so corrupt that they relish their supernatural existence and perceive the\nglimmer as a threat. The glimmer is destruction, not a reward, and they seek to lash out\nagainst it any way they can. They aren’t alone, either. Some hunters might attempt to\ndestroy the glimmer rather than permit the forgiveness of their hated enemies.\nProtecting the source from attack plays a major part in this scenario. The\nfollowing are some possible issues involving the power’s defense.\nThe simplest form of attack is, of course, direct physical force. Less subtle\nmonsters or creatures with powerful physical abilities might try to destroy the\nglimmer. This could mean murdering the hunter who channels the power or blowing\nup the location that houses the nexus. Depending on the monsters involved, this\ncould be a surgical strike by an assassin or demolitions expert, or an all-out assault\nby a horde of creatures and their followers. This kind of direct physical challenge can\nbe bloody — and not just for the hunters. Normal people and saved monsters might\nbe injured or lost in the battle.\nCunning monsters such as vampires, warlocks and demons may put subtle\nschemes into play. A monster might strike at the glimmer by capturing a hunter’s\nfamily, threatening to kill loved ones if the power is not destroyed. Another option\nmight be to distract the hunters with minions or other monster groups, leaving the\nglimmer unguarded. Monsters who influence governments, police or other institu-\ntions — even as damaged as these groups are in the final days — could use them to\nharass, arrest or destabilize the characters, their allies or their friends. In response,\nREDEMPTIONS THAT DO NOT BEGET INTERVENTIONS\nThe administration of the glimmer and the possible redemption of a\nmonster is likely to be an incredibly intense situation for all involved. Enjoy\nit, but be careful. Just as the hunters find themselves persecuted for trying to\nrecondition monsters, players might accidentally cross the line while trying to\nportray their commitment to redemption. As always, it is important that the\nIt’s Just a Game, No Touching, Be Mindful of Others and Have Fun rules stay\nfirmly in mind, especially during such powerful scenes as these.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n213\nCHAPTER SIX\n213\nhunters must draw on their own ingenuity and diplomatic skills rather than\nfirepower and edges. They have something or someone personal to lose.\nDepending on the nature of the glimmer, the hunters might not be able to\ndefend it against certain attacks. If the power flows from a crack in reality or a spirit\nrealm, the imbued cannot enter such an alien plane — but monsters such as demons,\nghosts and werewolves can, and might strike at the source directly. The hunters\nmight have to approach former or current enemies for aid, asking one set of monsters\nto fight another. But even if other creatures agree to help the characters, they’re\nbound to demand a price. Can the imbued grant the blessing of the glimmer to\ncreatures who don’t deserve it — or withhold it from beings who do — in order to\nbuy another day of protection?\nBeyond monsters, another threat is posed to the glimmer: other hunters. Some\nchosen (especially those of the Mercy creeds) see it as a boon, but others see it as\na get-out-of-jail-free card being handed out to monsters who deserve punishment.\nThese angry hunters want to either destroy the glimmer and any imbued who\nprotect it or use it as a way of stripping creatures’ powers before murdering the\nbeings. Like monsters, enemy hunters might be overt or subtle in their attacks on\nthe glimmer. Guardians might have to justify their actions to former allies in a\ncalm debate, or they might have to find God45 before the Wayward detonates a\ndirty nuclear bomb in the middle of the monster shantytown. How far are the\nhunters prepared to go to defend themselves against erstwhile allies, and how do\nmonsters react to inter-hunter conflict?\nTHE QUALITY OF MERCY\nThe control and protection of the glimmer falls primarily to characters of the\nMercy creeds. Through the use of the source, the Merciful can fulfill personal goals: to\nheal the supernatural corruption of this world and lessen the taint that spills into any\nsubsequent world. It’s a daunting task — the Merciful can never completely heal the\nworld or negate the supernatural — but if the right monsters can be redeemed, if enough\ncan be done with the glimmer before it fades, then the hunters might make a difference.\nThe glimmer is limited in power and comes closer to exhaustion every time it’s\nused. Ultimate responsibility for it, for making sure it’s used as effectively as possible,\ngoes to Merciful hunters.\nInnocents: These hunters are the peacemakers and diplomats of the imbued.\nThey might communicate with supernatural supplicants who seek (or demand) the\nglimmer’s touch. When monsters come to the glimmer like moths to a flame, they\ncould be confused, angry, violent or suspicious. Innocents can calm these beings,\nallay their fears that the glimmer is bait or prevent them from lashing out at hunters\nand other people. As more creatures gather around the hunters, Innocents can spend\neven more time interacting with them. Their duties might include administering to\nthe growth of a shantytown, mediating a peace between rival creatures or helping\nmonsters evade attacks and reprisals from enemy hunters. Innocents can be the\n“public face” of the glimmer, bearing the attention, temptation and aggression of\nunnatural supplicants.\nRedeemers: No hunters have a more terrible task than Redeemers. They may\nfeel responsible for deciding which creatures benefit from the glimmer’s power. Not\nevery hopeful can be saved, and only the most deserving may feel the power’s touch.\nRedeemers are charged with picking and choosing between monsters, using their\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n214\n214\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nedges, knowledge and instincts to decide whom to forgive. Some Redeemers might\nchoose to bless those creatures who are truly repentant, who have worked to push\nback their own damnation and who wish for nothing more than the return of their\nhumanity. Other hunters might decide to use the glimmer on monsters who are truly\nevil and corrupt, to remove their hideous power from the world and neutralize their\ninfluence. No matter what criteria Redeemers use, no matter what advice they take,\nthe final choice is theirs alone. And if the wrong creature is touched by the glimmer,\nthey must take responsibility for the outcome.\nMartyrs: The blessing of the glimmer is a process, almost like a 12-step program\nto forgiveness. Innocents handle the intake of monsters, Redeemers control the actual\nmoment of healing, while Martyrs take charge of the aftereffects, the return of former\nmonsters to humanity. This is a time of confusion, weakness and simple emotional\nsuffering for a creature. No hunters understand pain and suffering better than Martyrs.\nIt’s up to these imbued to counsel saved monsters in what it means to be human, to\nprotect them in their time of weakness and to bring them back into the community.\nMartyrs also play a strong part in protecting the glimmer from attack, fighting alongside\nZealots or on their own, and inspiring their comrades — and perhaps even the ranks\nof former creatures — with their courage, devotion and sacrifice.\nTHE LIGHT FADES\nThe power of the glimmer is immense and world-changing, but it’s not infinite.\nSooner or later, depending on how heavily the characters draw upon it, the phenomenon\nis spent. The healing energy runs dry, the serum reserves are exhausted or the extremist\nis consumed by her own power. The glimmer is gone and the story draws to a close.\nTHE OTHER CREEDS\n“Glimmer of Hope” emphasizes the role and purpose of the Mercy Virtue,\nto heal supernatural beings and in turn diminish their influence upon this age\nand that to come. But the Merciful aren’t alone in their fight. Other creeds have\na part to play in this scenario.\nThe Visionary: Using the glimmer on every monster that stumbles across\none’s path isn’t a wise way to share a miracle. To have a true impact on the world\nand to make a real difference, hunters of Vision can direct the glimmer where\nit can best be used. Hermits can gather information about monsters and\nsupplicants to the power, finding out which creatures have honest intentions\nand which are hopelessly corrupt. Visionaries look at the big picture, predicting\nwhat effects will follow the salvation of this monster rather than that one. As\nfor Waywards, while the mad hunters can use their gifts to guide the use of the\nglimmer, they’re likely to use it as a weapon, a means of crippling the powers\nof the supernatural.\nThe Zealous: Some see the glimmer not as a beacon of hope, but as an\nabomination that must be destroyed or as a resource to be exploited for their own\nends. Adherents of Zeal are called upon to fight such aggressors. Avengers can\ntake the fight to the attackers, striking at monsters and rogue hunters. Defenders\nprotect the glimmer and the Merciful from harm, holding attackers at arm’s\nlength until help arrives. Judges determine battle plans, mapping out tactics to\nremove a threat while minimizing the toll on mortals and hopefuls alike.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n215\nCHAPTER SIX\n215\nA story that results in the loss of the glimmer ends in a climax. The hunters have\nfought to control the power of the miracle, to heal willing (and perhaps unwilling)\nmonsters of their unnatural state, and to make the final days less terrifying. They’ve\nprobably suffered losses and setbacks, but they’ve (hopefully) also had triumphs.\nHave their actions made the next world a cleaner, less corrupt place?\nIf you don’t want to wrap up the story there, a number of stories and situations\ncan spin out of “Glimmer of Hope.” Consider the following issues:\n• What happens to monsters who are human again? Can they be integrated into\nnormal human society (or whatever society exists after the final days)? Some of them\nmight have a change of heart once they experience all the bad aspects of being mortal\nand seek to return to their damned state, or take revenge on the hunters. Others\nmight become targets of their old enemies or of humans who want to punish their\nformer dictators. Will the hunters protect them from such enemies or let them reap\nwhat they have sown?\n• What about the monsters who didn’t receive the glimmer, who were rejected\nor turned away by the hunters? These creatures might seek revenge on the people\nwho denied them salvation. Alternatively, some might pursue other means of\nredemption — means that could be true blessings or false promises held out as a\nmonstrous trick. What do characters do if they learn that a demon is undoing all of\ntheir efforts by drawing repentant monsters back into damnation?\n• For that matter, are there truly other means of salvation out there that the\nhunters can put to use? The glimmer was a singular power, but it might not be unique.\nIf another similar force exists, the hunters might be able to find it and avoid any\nmistakes made before. Of course, other forces — from monsters to other hunters to\nformer creatures of darkness — are desperate to find and control this new power, too.\nWINDS OF CHANGE\nOverview: The old rules have broken and now seemingly small changes can\nsweep the world. When normal humans are motivated to hew closer to the imbued\nand acknowledge the protectors in their midst, it’s a golden opportunity to make a\nreal difference. But to do so, the imbued must finally unify and dedicate themselves\nto a single cause.\n“Winds of Change” emphasizes the Vision Virtue. The imbued have always\nbeen held back by the inability of humanity to recognize the corruption of the\nsupernatural. But what happens when normal folks start to believe? With the power\nof the people behind them, hunters can act openly, coming together to fight the\ndarkness. Before that can happen, though, the imbued must overcome their own\ndifferences and agree on a goal that can be achieved, a dream that can be realized.\nThis story focuses heavily on interaction between hunters, other imbued groups and\nordinary people. The emphasis is on planning, leading and organizing, on aiming for\na lofty goal and doing whatever it takes to reach it.\nA CRACK IN THE MIRROR\nFor millennia, humanity has lived in ignorance of the monsters that lurk at\nsociety’s heart, that influence nations and that commit atrocities behind the scenes.\nThis ignorance is due to supernatural powers of subterfuge and disguise, and to those\nbeings’ cunning and secrecy. But the most important factor is humanity’s reluctance\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n216\n216\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nor inability to believe the truth, even when evidence is shoved in people’s faces.\nWhen confronted with the supernatural, humans tend to rationalize it away, lapse\ninto hysteria or simply deny the truth. They want to remain blissfully ignorant.\nNot anymore.\n“Winds of Change” proposes that normal people are ready to believe in the\nsupernatural. This change might come about as a result or side effect of civilization’s\ndestruction in the final days, or this newfound resilience could be the trigger for the\nfinal days and the tearing down of the old order. In either case, something has\nstripped away the human tendency for amnesia. Now when normal people encoun-\nter the supernatural — whether they see a ghost in a deserted house, survive a\nvampire’s attack or watch footage of a rampaging werewolf — they accept it for what\nit is, not for what they’ve been told it should be.\nOf course, all this change doesn’t mean that humans can suddenly detect\nmonsters or see through supernatural tricks. That capacity remains beyond people,\nas the burden of hunters who activate second sight. Nor can mortals read hunter code\nor resist a monster’s mind-control powers. Yet, the underpinning of the world’s\ncorruption — the inability of the human masses to even see that corruption exists —\nis gone. This upset of the status quo changes the world forever.\nEARLY DAYS\nThe hunters already believe in the supernatural, of course, so they aren’t\ndirectly affected by the change in the world’s rules. The scenario starts with the\ndawning realization that reality has changed, that the characters can take advantage\nof this new situation. The following are possible hooks to draw the hunters into the\nstory, but many possibilities exist.\n• In the aftermath of a confrontation with the supernatural (be it peaceful or\nviolent), the hunters are surrounded by people who want to know what the hell that\ncreature was, or what just happened. Accustomed to onlookers panicking or\nrationalizing away the supernatural, characters might be startled to realize that\npeople believe the evidence before their eyes, or at least don’t instantly reject the\nnotion of the inhuman.\n• Footage of a monster fighting a hunter appears on the Internet or on\ntelevision. The corrupt controllers of the media pull the images and bury the story,\nbut the damage is done. As they go about their daily lives, the characters encounter\npeople debating what the footage really depicted and whether supernatural forces\nwere actually involved.\n• When a creature (perhaps a warlock or demon) uses its powers openly in a\nconfrontation with the characters, mortal onlookers don’t run. Indeed, a mob of\nangry people attacks the creature, forcing it to flee or perhaps giving the hunters a\nchance to take it down.\nThis change in people’s beliefs might occur slowly over the course of several\nstories, or it might happen overnight. In either case, the change is not just local but\nglobal. Stories of humanity’s acceptance of the supernatural surface in the media and\nin underground networks such as hunter-net, and propagate by word of mouth.\nOpen acceptance of monsters means that the greatest obstacles facing the\nimbued — their inability to act openly or gain support from their friends or society\nat large — are eliminated. The characters are still vulnerable to attacks and reprisals\nfrom enemies. They might still have to work in secret to remain safe, but now they\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n217\nCHAPTER SIX\n217\ncan attract followers and aid, explain their actions to the people they love and aim\nat important goals.\nHEARTS AND MINDS\nIndividually, each hunter is a lone soldier, peacemaker or planner. But with a\nlegion of human supporters and believers behind them, the imbued can now become\nguides— leaders of an army, a political revolution or a spiritual reawakening. If hunters\ncan convince normal people to aid them, to lend support to a specific goal, the chosen\ncan make real headway in the struggle. This is a time for hunters (especially those of\nthe Vision creeds) to set their sights on major, concrete objectives. It’s an opportunity\nto stop maintaining the status quo and start making a real difference.\nIt’s likely that characters make large-scale plans as soon as they realize that they\ncan gain the support of the masses. If they don’t, other imbued groups elsewhere do,\nand the characters see the results. Perhaps news reports show riots in other cities,\nwith the ringleaders holding up banners bearing hunter code symbols. A politician\nis torn apart by a mob after other hunters expose him as a monster. A cult movement\nforms around a charismatic preacher who claims that monsters are real. You can use\nscenes such as these to light a fire under players, driving home the point that the old\nrules have changed and that great things are possible.\nOf course, if hunters want to draw on the strength and support of the people, they\nneed to win that support. People might no longer dismiss the supernatural out of hand,\nbut they still need to be convinced that accusers are right — and be persuaded to aid\nin any effort. It doesn’t help that people are still afraid of the supernatural and likely\nto panic when they encounter monsters. If the characters want converts, they need to\nchallenge public fear by motivating normal humans to fight back.\nFear can be overridden with outrage. If the characters know of a particularly vile\nor abhorrent creature, revealing its true nature could infuriate people such that\nthey’re more incensed than terrified. If the hunters prove that a prominent figure\nsuch as a politician or celebrity is a murderer, child molester or ruthless manipulator\nbefore revealing his monstrous nature, mobs might respond by swarming the creature\nrather than running away. Once the furor dies down, hunters can try to rally the\nfrightened but (hopefully) convinced and invigorated humans to their cause.\nAlternatively, characters might try to gain supporters more peacefully and\nrationally, convincing them of the truth intellectually without exposing folks to\ndanger or terror. For instance, hunters could gather evidence that the supernatural is\nreal — photographs, videotapes, witnesses, even the corpses of monsters — and\npresent it all to appropriate people. Taking this material to journalists is one possibility,\nbut it has its dangers. The media might still be controlled or manipulated by monsters\nDOUBLE-EDGED SWORD\nThe fading of the masses’ disbelief isn’t a completely positive development for\nthe imbued. Some creatures — most notably demons, warlocks and goblins —\nwere actually hampered by disbelief before. The great secret suppressed their\nsupernatural powers and forced them to work quietly. With disbelief gone, these\ncreatures are free to do as they wish and put overt plans and powers into motion.\nHunters might set out to achieve bold new goals only to find some of their\nopposition even more powerful than before.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n218\n218\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nand their followers, and hunters’ efforts might only attract unwanted attention from\ndangerous enemies. Another possibility is for the chosen to personally convince\nfriends, families and personal contacts, everyone from co-workers to church members.\nWord of mouth spreads from there, from other people who are trusted.\nMany other methods exist for hunters to gain support. They could form a cult,\npreaching the truth about the supernatural. They could rally a street gang around\nthemselves, recruiting new members as society crumbles. They could even set up a\nwebsite with photos, documents and forums, almost like a “civilian” version of\nhunter-net, tapping into the rising tide of online belief.\nHowever the hunters approach the task, the process of gathering followers can\noccupy several chapters of the story. Once they win support, however, they need to\nuse it. They need a purpose.\nPERSISTENCE OF VISION\nGoals, plans and foresight are the province of the Vision creeds, which might\nhave been intended by the Messengers to lead the imbued into the final days. That’s\nnot a role that the other hunters have always accepted, of course, or that Visionary\nhunters have understood themselves. Before now, the business of planning and\nthinking about where the imbued are going has often taken a back seat to simple\nsurvival, and long-term goals have given way to short-term successes.\nWith humanity emerging from its blindness, however, the situation has\nchanged. It’s time for Vision to take command, and for the leaders of hunters to take\ntheir rightful place in imbued society. But the three Vision creeds are very different\nin their approaches to the hunt, other imbued and humanity. Those differences\naffect the goals such leaders choose and the relationships they form with supporters.\nHermits: Separated from their fellow imbued by crippling headaches and\nmental static, Hermits naturally prefer the company of ordinary people (when they\nmust endure company at all). Hermits are best suited to working directly with\nhunters’ supporters. As the imbued form a support network, Hermits can work\nwithin that normal community, sharing information and relaying the general\nmentality of the masses to other hunters. Hermits are also vital to gathering the\ndetails needed to develop plans and goals, using their edges and capabilities to learn\nand disseminate information. The challenge for Hermits is balancing any loyalty to\nordinary friends and associates with the overall sacrifice and loss demanded by\nhunters’ plans. Can individual losses be tolerated for the greater good?\nWaywards: Just as Hermits can work within society, so are the near-psychotic\nWaywards connected to the imbued. Waywards tend to be contemptuous of other\nhunters, but at least they recognize that other chosen have a function. Normal humans,\nhowever, might be considered little more than cannon fodder or bait. That attitude\nthat can only drive supporters away. A hunter group led by a Wayward is likely to work\ntoward a violent and bloody goal, and it will probably suffer great losses in the struggle\nto reach it. Even other hunters may be expendable to a Wayward, and imbued allies\ncould become enemies once the destructive plans of a Wayward are revealed. But in\nthe final days, when monsters rampage and civilization crumbles, the savage inspira-\ntion and power of a Wayward might be the only means of fulfilling a goal.\nVisionaries: Making up the only truly sane creed following the Vision Virtue,\nthese hunters are perhaps best suited to lead both imbued and ordinary people to a\ndream. With their predictive and information-gathering edges, they can uncover\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n219\nCHAPTER SIX\n219\nthe data needed to formulate plans and strategies, while their humanity and\ninspirational powers can rally support. But with that purpose and presence comes\nresponsibility, more so than for Hermits and Waywards. A Visionary must be the\ninterface between hunters and their supporters, able to lead from the front lines and\nadvise from safety. No other hunter better understands the price that must be paid\nto reach important goals. A Visionary must justify that price to both imbued and\nhuman allies. This is the role for which seers were created, perhaps the purpose the\nMessengers always intended. It’s a thankless and punishing task, however. One that\ncan destroy a leader before her aspiration is fulfilled.\nAIMING HIGH\nGreat things can be achieved only if hunters strive for them. Until now, most\nhunters have had to settle for small victories and minor achievements, unable to\nmake truly significant changes to the world. But now the status quo has changed, the\nimpossible is possible. Difficult and dangerous, but possible. With the backing of\nsupporters and the potential to gain more, hunters can move beyond their old arenas\nand set their sights on meaningful and important accomplishments. Such as? Well,\nthat’s up to the characters to determine. The central purpose of “Winds of Change”\nis to put the imbued in a position to achieve great things, assuming they have the\ninspiration to find a meaningful goal.\nA major goal is nothing more or less than changing the world. This is action on\na national or even international scale. Rather than exposing the mayor’s mon-\nstrous nature, the characters try to bring down the entire government. Instead of\ndisrupting vampiric control of a crime family, the hunters attempt to break the\nbloodsuckers’ control over the country. And rather than be satisfied with small\nglimpses of the truth and the meaning behind the imbuing, the chosen settle for\nTHE OTHER CREEDS\n“Winds of Change” focuses on the Vision creeds, revolving around lofty\ngoals and the organization required to meet them, but the Vision creeds are\nnot alone in this struggle. Other imbued have a part to play in attaining the\nfinal reward.\nThe Merciful: To these hunters falls the responsibility of protecting and\nnurturing both hunters and supporters — not just physically, but emotionally\nand spiritually. Innocents can lift the spirits of battle-scarred and frightened\nimbued with edges and sheer optimism, and they can fan the flame of hope in\nhuman supporters. Martyrs can inspire ordinary people with their courage and\nreadiness for sacrifice and protect folks from the terrors of the supernatural.\nRedeemers can heal the sick and give strength to the weak, inspiring loyalty in\nthe most cynical of skeptics.\nThe Zealous: As the imbued work toward their goals, monsters lash out\nagainst the upstarts. The Zealous must be ready to protect their leaders. Avengers\nare charged with bringing the battle to the enemy, taking out creatures that stand\nin the path of the imbued agenda. Defenders protect planners and information\ngatherers from attack, and shield allies from harm. Judges can work closely with\nVisionary leaders, developing tactical plans to win the battles that take the\nimbued closer to winning the war.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\n220\n220\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nnothing less than knowing everything. Major goals are conceivable only once\nhunters know that the masses can accept the truth. To actually attain these goals\n— to change the world irrevocably even as it crumbles around their ears — the\nimbued must gain the support of not just a few dozen or even hundreds of normal\nfolks. They must gain the support of thousands. This is not something that can be\naccomplished alone or at once. To attain a major goal, the hunters must ally with\nother imbued across the world.\nINHERITING THE EARTH\nIf and when the characters decide to aim for a major goal and realize that they\nneed help, “Winds of Change” moves into its final phase. To reach their goal, the\nimbued need to recruit other hunter groups (and their human supporters) to the\ncause. The greater the goal, the bigger the network needs to be. In the process of\nbringing hunters together, the characters may accomplish something even more\nimportant — the creation of a hunter society. And even after the goal is reached\n(or perhaps even if the plan fails), that society of hunters, working openly to\nchange the world, remains in the wake of the final days. Perhaps that unification\nwas the unseen, greatest goal possible.\nThe final phase of “Winds of Change” is open-ended. The story could wrap up\nquickly as the hunters overcome every obstacle in their path, or they might be cut\ndown before their crusade even begins. More likely, though, is a story told through\nseveral chapters, with the imbued slowly marshaling their allies. The story ends\nwhen their goal is finally fulfilled or lost. Here are some factors to consider when\ndeveloping the chronicle.\nKeeping the Faith: To maintain the support of normal people, hunters need to\ndo more than simply use edges and fight monsters. People must be protected from\ndanger and kept safe from the chaos and terrors of the final days, even if it puts\nhunters at great risk. If some supporters are lost to violence, the characters have to\nwork all the harder to preserve the loyalty of those who remain.\nCommunication: If the hunters want to recruit the help of other imbued, they\nneed to reach those hunters somehow. Hunter-net is one means of contact, but it might\nnot function as society falls apart. Characters might have to resort to simpler methods\nsuch as telephone calls, face-to-face meetings or even letters. Other options include\nusing the media, sending messengers or the use of edges and creed capabilities.\nNegotiation and Compromise: The characters are not the only hunters trying\nto make a difference in the final days. Other groups work toward their own goals and\nmay have little or no interest in cooperating with the characters. Indeed, other\ngroups might try to persuade the characters to abandon their goal and dedicate\nthemselves to a different agenda. If the imbued want the help of their fellows, they\nmight need to make formal alliances and deals, quid-pro-quo arrangements to help\nboth groups achieve their desires.\nKilling Rivalries: Some hunter groups have no interest in compromise or\nagreement. Their goals are intrinsically opposed to the characters’. If one group\nseeks to make an alliance with demons to uncover the mysteries of reality while\nanother seeks to wipe demons from the face of the Earth, there can be only conflict\nbetween them.\nMonstrous Reprisal: Of course, the supernatural corrupters of the world do not\nsit idly by while humanity unites against them. Even in the final days, monsters\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\nCHAPTER SIX\n221\nCHAPTER SIX\n221\ninfluence society, control gangs and police forces, and they possess terrible powers.\nUnited and public hunter groups make themselves — and their supporters — targets.\nSuccess: If, despite all these obstacles and complications, the hunters finally\nreach their goal and change the world, you don’t have to stop there. Anything is\npossible in the final days. Backed by a web of imbued and a nation of supporters,\nperhaps the characters can do the impossible. Maybe they can build a new world for\nhumanity, free reality from corruption and truly inherit the Earth. At the very least,\nthey can try.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n222\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n223\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nCHAPTER SEVEN:\nTHE SIXTH AGE\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Wheel of Ages turns. The Eye of the Demon Emperor is visible in the\nheavens. The signs and portents have come to pass and the Age of Darkness draws\nto a close, but most of the Kuei-jin, the Hungry Dead, remain ignorant of the turning\nof the Age. They either do not see or choose not to see the future that awaits them,\nbut the Wheel cannot be stopped. The passing of the Fifth Age comes, whether the\nDemon People acknowledge it or not. The signs are there for even the blind to see.\nThe Age of Darkness is over. The Age of Sorrow dawns. The end has come.\nThe end for the Laws of the East setting is a part of the eschatological lore of the\nKuei-jin. The Asian vampires believe that time moves in cycles, transitioning from one\nAge to the next. There have already been several such Ages, five to be exact, and the\nworld sits on the cusp of the coming Sixth Age. Exactly when the Sixth Age, the Age\nof Sorrow, will arrive is a matter of considerable speculation and debate among the Kuei-\njin, but the time for debate is over. The Sixth Age is not only coming, it has arrived.\nThis chapter describes different ways for you to bring about the arrival of the Sixth\nAge in your own chronicle. It can come as a climatic ending to an existing chronicle,\nor you can create an entirely new game to play out the ending foretold by the sutras\nand traditions of the Demon People. You can even use the material in this chapter as\ninspiration for creating an all-new Laws of the East chronicle set in the Sixth Age\nitself, after the world familiar to the Kuei-jin has changed irrevocably. The power is in\nyour hands, as it always has been.\nThat includes the power to decide exactly how the Sixth Age arrives in your\nown World of Darkness setting. This chapter presents three different versions of the\nend of the Fifth Age and the beginning of the Age of Sorrow. You can choose any\none of them or take elements from each to create your own version of the Sixth Age\nfor your chronicle.\nSTORYTELLING IN THE SIXTH AGE\nThis chapter provides advice and information useful to Storytellers who are\nconsidering or planning to end a Laws of the East chronicle with the advent of the\nSixth Age. It offers advice on how to wrap up a chronicle, how to run a successful\nconclusion to your chronicle and things to consider while planning and running the\nfinal games. It also includes ideas on modifying the existing Laws of the East rules\nand game systems to suit particular types of ending scenarios and follow-up\nchronicles set in the Sixth Age.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n224\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nNEW SYSTEMS & MECHANICS\nEnding an ongoing Laws of the East chronicle allows you a greater opportunity\nto tinker with the game’s systems and the capabilities of the characters. The arrival\nof the Sixth Age may include dramatic alterations in the nature of the Kuei-jin and\ntheir powers, in the relationship between the material and spirit worlds, in the flow\nand character of Chi and many other things. Some system changes that normally\nwouldn’t be suitable for an ongoing chronicle can work just fine as temporary\nchanges heralding the end. After all, if a particular change doesn’t work, it’s fairly\neasy to change it again, saying that the whims of karma are fickle in the Age of\nSorrow. In the end, no system change matters that much, since the chronicle will\nsoon be over anyway.\nHere are just a few ways in which you can change the Laws of the East systems\nto suit your own particular vision of the end. Some of these systems come into play\nin the scenarios described earlier in this book while others are just jumping-off points\nfor you own version of the Sixth Age.\nCHI\nThe power of Chi is one of the key elements of Laws of the East. It is the power\nthat sustains the Hungry Dead — and other shen as well. Wars are fought over control\nof the dragon nests and the dragon lines that connect them. Mortals are valuable to\nthe Kuei-jin for the Chi they possess, making them the prey of the vampires. Chi is also\ntied to the changing of the Ages. The passing of the Age of Legends came when the\nAugust Personage of Jade cursed the Wan Xian, taking away their ability to breathe\nin Chi from the very air, forcing them to steal it from others to survive, transforming\nthem into the Wan Kuei, the Ten Thousand Demons. Another change in the Age\ncould affect the nature of Chi and the Kuei-jin ability to gather and use it.\nConsider some of the following potential changes in the nature of Chi and its use:\n• Chi Imbalance: The type of Chi available to the Kuei-jin changes, favoring\neither Yin or Yang Chi. For example, as the Sixth Age dawns, Yang Chi might\nbecome increasingly rare, while Yin Chi, the energy of darkness and stillness,\npredominates. As a result, it is harder for the Kuei-jin to maintain their Chi balance.\nTemporary imbalance becomes more common, which means that they risk damage\nwhenever they expend Chi. The rarer type of Chi becomes far more precious, and\nKuei-jin are likely to struggle to secure supplies of it. Consider a shortage of Yang Chi\nin the Sixth Age, where surviving hengeyokai or hsien safeguard the few remaining\npockets. In a Sixth Age with a shortage of Yin Chi, wild Kuei-jin might hunt ghosts\nand stalk the dead for the power to cool the fires that burn within them.\nA lack of a particular type of Chi also predisposes the Kuei-jin more toward\npermanent Chi imbalance. If Yin Chi is plentiful but Yang Chi is rare, the Kuei-jin\nare more likely to become ch’ing shih: decayed walking corpses, hideous to behold. A\nSixth Age glutted with Yang Chi begets wild and passionate Kuei-jin, ruled by their\nemotions and capable of spawning dhampyrs (perhaps so many that the remaining\nhuman population begins to shrink). This can create a very different atmosphere for\na chronicle that takes place during the Sixth Age.\n• Demon Chi: The Age of Sorrow is the rise of the Yama Kings and the Demon\nEmperor, and it might lead to their dominion over the Middle Kingdom. As the\npower of Yomi grows, the world’s Chi becomes increasingly tainted or defiled,\nDemon Chi. This is the power of the P’o soul. In the Sixth Age, all of the world’s Chi\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n225\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nmay become Demon Chi with only a slight amount of Yin- and Yang-aspected Chi\nremaining, or none at all.\nThis has an inevitably corrupting effect on Kuei-jin. If Demon Chi is the only\nsource of Chi available to them, then the Kuei-jin can gain and store only as much as\ntheir P’o rating allows. This means that Kuei-jin with greater P’o will feed and survive\nmore easily, while those who rely strongly on Hun will be forced either to allow their\nDemon Soul greater influence or to become the prey of more powerful Kuei-jin.\n• Scarce Chi: The Sixth Age may be a time when Chi drains from the world\nlike blood from a corpse, leaving the Kuei-jin to starve and eventually fade away. As\nthe August Personage denied the Wan Xian the power to breathe, so the Sixth Age\nmight limit or deny the Wan Kuei the ability to feed. Rather than a particular kind\nof Chi becoming scare, as described previously, all Chi becomes harder to find, or at\nleast less accessible to the Kuei-jin. This means the Hungry Dead must more carefully\nhorde their Chi and are more reluctant to spend it unless absolutely necessary.\n• Restricted Feeding: A variation on the Scarce Chi option is that the Age of\nSorrow may limit the Kuei-jin ability to feed on sources of Chi. This has a number\nof variations of its own, depending on just how restricted Kuei-jin feeding becomes.\nIf bodhisattvas and arhats lose the ability to acquire Chi through osmosis, then\nthey must find prey to feed upon once more. This makes the dragon nests worthless\nto the Kuei-jin as a source of Chi, though they might remain useful as gateways\nbetween the worlds. (See the discussion on the Wall and the Spirit Worlds that\nfollows.) Having more elder vampires hunting places a greater strain on the Wan\nKuei’s chosen prey, humanity. Scarlet screens will have to work overtime to conceal\nthe increased feeding and provide sources of Chi for the Kuei-jin. Competition for\nprey might cause friction between different factions of vampires and more hunting\nmight attract the attention of those who hunt the Kuei-jin.\nLimiting Kuei-jin to obtaining Chi from blood makes them much like Western\nKindred in terms of feeding. The more subtle means of breath draining and osmosis\ndenied them, Kuei-jin must hunt prey like the Westerners do. Even the most exalted\nancestor needs vessels to provide blood. This creates even more risk of drawing mortal\nattention, as well as more direct competition for sources of Chi. If it continues over a\nlong period of time, scarlet screens devoted to providing vessels and the art of aspecting\na vessel’s Chi will become more common among the Kuei-jin to meet their needs.\n• Restricted Use: Along with restrictions on obtaining Chi, Kuei-jin might\nface limits on their ability to channel and use the Chi that they do obtain. The nature\nof the Sixth Age might require more Chi to fuel the supernatural Disciplines and\nother powers of the Hungry Dead, allowing Kuei-jin to use those abilities less often\nthan before. How restricted vampires become depends on the amount of Chi their\npowers now demand. At first it might be a relatively slight increase, an additional\nTrait of Chi to use a Discipline, for example. This restriction may increase, with an\ninitial outlay of Chi between two and five Traits needed to activate any particular\nDiscipline, or by Chi costs increasing by 50% to 100% (or even more).\nIncreasing Chi costs might not affect uses of Demon Chi, in which case it\nbecomes the more economical option compared to some Disciplines. Of course,\nusing Demon Chi comes with its own risks, but some Kuei-jin will gladly take them\nin order to save their Yin and Yang Chi for sustenance. This will make the Demon\nArts more common and effective among Kuei-jin, perhaps the first step on the road\nto corruption by the Yama Kings.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n226\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nTHE WALL AND THE SPIRIT WORLDS\nThe connection between the material and spirit worlds is a vital part of the\nexistence of the Kuei-jin and the key to many of their abilities. The Sixth Age might\nlead to an imbalance between the spirit worlds and the Middle Kingdom, making the\nWall harder or easier to overcome, with particular consequences for the Kuei-jin.\n• Raising the Wall: An increase in the strength of the Wall might come from\ndiminishing levels of Chi in the world or from an increasing gulf between the material\nand spiritual worlds. The Wall might strengthen to a particular point and then stop,\nor it could become so thick that travel between the worlds is impossible. See “The\nRising of One Hundred Clouds” for an example of what might happen if the Wall cuts\noff contact between the worlds, trapping the Kuei-jin in the Middle Kingdom.\nAn increase in the strength of the Wall affects not only the ability of the Wan Kuei\nto step from one world to another, but also the ability to feed on ambient Chi, since the\ndifficulty is based on the local Wall rating. This imposes a form of limited feeding, leading\nto an increased need for Chi among the arhats and bodhisattvas of the Hungry Dead.\n• Lowering the Wall: Alternatively, the coming of the Age of Sorrow might\nbatter down the Wall between the worlds, or at least weaken it to the point where\ntraversing them is relatively easy for anyone with the means.\nEXPERIENCE AND ENLIGHTENMENT\nThe Dharmas of the Kuei-jin — or at least those of the Fivefold Path recognized\nby the August Courts — are dedicated to achieving a state of enlightenment. The\nending of a chronicle might signal the end of the characters’ Dharmic journey toward\nthat enlightenment. A time of ending can also be a time of revelation and insight\nthat guides characters toward the enlightenment espoused by their Dharmas.\nSuch momentous lessons in the characters’ unlives can speed up advancement, in\nterms of both Dharma and experience. This allows characters the opportunity, however\nbriefly, to experience the power possessed by arhats and ancestors of the courts, to wield\ngreater status and influence. It can be like a time-lapse film of the characters’ progress,\nbringing them to a point where they can face the challenges of the end of the Age.\nMore opportunities for both auspicious occasions and acts of blindness fit in\nwith the theme of endings and transition. They are “interesting times” indeed for the\nKuei-jin, facing young jina with unprecedented challenges and opportunities. Part\nof the ending story arc might be the characters reaching toward enlightenment or\nturning away from it because of the demands of their unlives.\nBy the same token, the momentous events happening all around the characters\n(and to them, in many cases) are good reasons to grant additional Experience Traits,\nallowing the characters to learn from the hard lessons that face them. You can even\nwaive things like training, saying that even the Kuei-jin have to learn by doing and\nacquire their skills the hard way in such times of crisis.\nIf you’re planning on continuing your chronicle into the Sixth Age, consider\nthe effects of increased Dharma and Experience on the characters. Your troupe\nmight retire them to become the arhats and bodhisattvas of the new Age, or you can\nstart a new chronicle in which the characters function on an entirely different level\nthan before because of their newfound insight and abilities.\nTHE SECOND BREATH\nA vampire’s unlife begins with the Second Breath, when the Kuei-jin’s divided\nspirit escapes the torments of Yomi and rends the Wall to re-enter its corpse (or another\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n227\nCHAPTER SEVEN\ncorpse) and take up existence as one of the Hungry Dead. Whether the Second Breath\nis an opportunity for redemption and enlightenment or a terrible curse, it is the source\nof the Kuei-jin. In the Age of Sorrow, the nature or very existence of the Second Breath\ncould change, and change the Kuei-jin along with it.\n• Fewer Return: In the Sixth Age, fewer souls escape from the clutches of the\nYama Kings and manage to return to the Middle Kingdom to rise as Kuei-jin. A sign\nof the dawning Sixth Age is that fewer Kuei-jin come into being. As they meet Final\nDeath, fewer vampires are left in the world. Eventually, the number of Wan Kuei\ndestroyed might exceed the number that come into being, diminishing their ranks.\nHaving fewer Running Monkeys might seem positive to the elders of the Courts, but\nover time it means fewer subordinates to take on the various tasks of the Courts.\n• None Return: At the extreme end of fewer souls returning from death is the point\nwhere none return, and no new Kuei-jin come into being. This could spell the eventual\nend of the vampires. Although they are eternal, even the Wan Kuei meet Final Death\nin various ways. With none to replace them, the ranks of the various Courts grow fewer\nwith the passing of the years, until the number of Kuei-jin is reduced to a mere handful.\nThis attrition could take centuries, or even millennia, but eventually it will happen. If\nthe Kuei-jin are still faced with enemies like the Shih and the Kin-jin, their inability to\nreplenish their ranks could lead to their end that much sooner.\n• More Return: On the other hand, the Age of Sorrow comes when more souls\nescape from Yomi and rise as the Hungry Dead, swelling the ranks of the Kuei-jin.\nTheir numbers grow, perhaps too rapidly for the slow-moving Courts to adjust to the\ninflux of new vampires. More Running Monkeys means more potential for imbal-\nance, chaos and even rebellion as different factions recruit among the new Kuei-jin\nand try to create power blocks of their own within the Courts. Having more vampires\nalso increases the chances that mortals will discover the existence of the Kuei-jin\nand take action against them. The ancestors of the August Courts might see the\nappearance of many more Kuei-jin as an opportunity, sending more off to support the\nGreat Leap Outward. Kuei-jin holdings outside the Middle Kingdom could also\nbecome places where more Kuei-jin arise among the local Asian populations.\n• All Return: At the extreme end of this scenario, all souls with ties to the Middle\nKingdom become Kuei-jin after death. This quickly and vastly changes the nature of Kuei-\njin existence, as the Hungry Dead quickly become known throughout Asia and the world.\nThe mortal authorities are soon swamped by the rising number of savage and hungry\nvampires, and the existing Kuei-jin are quite unable to hunt and tame so many chih-meh.\nEven though many of the new vampires are destroyed, those killed by them also take the\nSecond Breath. The Age of Sorrow becomes a terrible war between the living and the dead,\nand between the lands of the Middle Kingdom and the outside world as well.\n• Servants of the Yama Kings: In addition to the preceding options, the nature\nof the Second Breath might change in the Sixth Age. Perhaps the souls that escape\nYomi do not escape at all, but are released by the Yama Kings to become not only Kuei-\njin, but akuma dedicated to their service. These vampires are sworn to the Lords of\nYomi before their souls even leave hell, so they rise in control of their vampiric nature\nto take up their duties to corrupt the Kuei-jin of the Middle Kingdom and bring them\ninto the service of their masters. In this case some of the newly created Kuei-jin might\nbe “akuma-born,” or all Kuei-jin who arise after the changing of the Age might be in\nthe service of the Yama Kings. Soon they will join others of their kind, and it will only\nbe a matter of time before the unclaimed Wan Kuei are a hunted minority.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n228\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nINAUSPICIOUS SIGNS\nThe signs of the impending Sixth Age are everywhere, for those with eyes to see them.\nIndeed, the signs have been there for some time, but many Kuei-jin have been unwilling\n— or unable — to see them for what they are. It is only recently that the signs of the end\nhave become unmistakable, though there are still those who do not wish to believe.\nStorytellers can use these and other inauspicious signs of the impending Sixth\nAge in the buildup to the end of a Laws of the East chronicle. In order to maintain\nsome amount of mystery in your chronicle, we recommend creating your own signs\nof the Sixth Age in addition to those presented here. Not every character should be\naware of what’s going on, and even your most enlightened and insightful characters\nshould receive (at most) only two different hints. Although the decision of which\ncharacters to tap for visions or hints is yours, Merits and Flaws can be a big help\n(especially ones like Medium, Haunted, Oracular Ability and Nightmares). Characters\nwho spend a good deal of time visiting the Yin or Yang Worlds might also make good\ncandidates for hints about the Sixth Age.\nENDING A LAWS OF THE EAST CHRONICLE\n“All good things must end,” as they say, and although it’s possible for a Laws of\nthe East game to run on for years, even the best games grow stale and tired over time.\nYou’ve told what stories you can with the characters. They have changed and\ndeveloped, perhaps becoming quite powerful and influential in their own right. The\nplayers have grown familiar with all the elements of the setting and the chronicle,\nand they have had a hand in creating and shaping them. Sooner or later, it comes\ntime to bring your story to a close and move on to other new and exciting stories you\nand your players can create. It’s time to end your chronicle.\nLet the Sixth Age begin.\nTHE RISING OF ONE HUNDRED CLOUDS\nThroughout their tormented existence, the Kuei-jin have sought peace and\nenlightenment, harmony between the divided halves of their nature: Hun and P’o,\nYin and Yang. There are many stories of bodhisattvas finding the hidden path to the\nslopes of Mount Meru and attaining the enlightenment of the Hundred Clouds, but\nare they just tales, stories for damned souls with no hope of redemption? With the\nportents of the Age of Sorrow all around them, the Kuei-jin hope that there is more\nto their Dharmas than merely holding the demon within them at bay another night,\nand it seems that they might be right.\nINTRODUCTION\nIt ends, not with a roar, but with a sigh, like the resigned last breath of a dying man.\nThe Sixth Age arrives in a form quite unexpected by the Kuei-jin, and they are forced\nto adapt to a diminished existence in the Age of Sorrow, or to accept Final Death at last.\nThe changing of the Age comes with the strengthening of the Wall between the\nMiddle Kingdom and the spirit worlds. It grows from a barrier to an impassable gulf,\nclosing off the world of spirit from the world of matter. The shen, denizens of the Yin\nand Yang Worlds, withdraw. With the ascension of the Demon Emperor, the Yomi\nWorld is sealed off and the Yama Kings are no longer a threat to the world. The\ninhabitants of the Middle Kingdom, Kuei-jin and mortal, are left alone with an\nuncertain future.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n229\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nBUILDING THE DRAGON WALL\nThe first sign of the coming Sixth Age is the strengthening of the Wall between\nthe material world and the spirit world. Kuei-jin should notice a gradual increase in\nthe Wall rating of certain areas, making access to the spirit worlds more difficult. It\nbegins first in places where the Wall ratings are the highest. Some areas with initial\nWall ratings of 8 or 9 become completely impassable as the Wall rating exceeds 10.\nThe Wall between the worlds is simply too thick for any force to overcome it. Kuei-\njin who have passed through the Wall in those places might need to travel to find\na place where they can return to the Middle Kingdom.\nWhat begins as a troublesome oddity becomes a serious concern when the Wall\nstrengthens again, and again. Soon all urban areas are completely impassable, and even\nthe wild places and dragon nests have their Chi reduced from wellsprings to mere trickles.\nPassing through the Wall isn’t easy anywhere, and Kuei-jin notice that the Wall seems\nthicker, the spirit worlds more distant, as if they were drifting further out of reach.\nTHE WEIGHT OF DEATH\nThe strengthening of the Wall has a number of effects on Kuei-jin in the Middle\nKingdom and throughout the world. Feeding becomes more difficult for elder Kuei-jin, cut\noff from the Chi of the spirit worlds. The ability to traverse the paths of the spirit worlds\nbecomes less reliable, depriving the Kuei-jin of a valuable weapon in their arsenal. An\nincreasing number of vampires look to their elders for guidance, but they receive none.\nWith the situation surrounding the Two-Fang Serpent Plan becoming increas-\ningly unstable and Kuei-jin around the world concerned about the unexplained\ngrowth of the Wall, the Ancestors of the Courts are expected to act. They do, but\nnot in the ways that are expected.\nINVOLVING THE CHARACTERS\nThe events of this part of “The Rising of One Hundred Clouds” are best\nincorporated into an ongoing Laws of the East chronicle as background material\nand a new wrinkle on whatever challenges the characters already face. For example,\nthe characters might notice an increase in the difficulty of overcoming the Wall in\nsome places at first, followed by even greater increases. Perhaps an attempt to enter\nor leave the spirit worlds fails unexpectedly, forcing the characters to improvise.\nNor are the Kuei-jin the only ones to be affected by this sudden shift. Spirits and\nother shen known to them are suddenly absent or more difficult to contact. Those\nplaces where shen have typically gathered grow deserted.\nTHE CLOUDS RISE\nAs the Wall becomes impassable, ancestors of the Kuei-jin courts begin to\ndisappear. The realization of the dawning Sixth Age has proven a tremendous\nmoment of insight for the eldest of the Kuei-jin, allowing some of them to achieve\nthe enlightenment of dâh. They have ascended to the Hundred Clouds. Like the\nspirit worlds, they are leaving the Middle Kingdom, and the younger Kuei-jin,\nbehind. For other elder Kuei-jin, the rising of the Wall means something else. The\nYama Kings call the hidden akuma of the courts home, and some ancestors walk into\nHell willingly, while others are dragged there by the demons to pay their debts to the\nLords of Yomi. Either way, they will not return.\nIf the characters have an elder mentor, ally or even enemy, they should be\nwitness to that bodhisattva’s departure. The Kuei-jin comes to the characters and\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n230\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\ntells them that the Cycle of the Great Wheel is moving on, that the next Age is\ncoming, and that it will be their destiny to deal with it in their own way. Even if the\nelder was antagonistic toward the characters before, the time for enmity is past. Then\nthe ancestor steps across the Wall, heedless of the local difficulty of doing so, and\nvanishes into the spirit worlds, never to be seen again. This is an excellent\nopportunity to start the end with a dramatic and possibly pivotal scene for your\ncharacters — savor it if you think your players will appreciate it.\nFOLLOWING THE BODHISATTVA’S PATH\nThe departure of so many ancestors and bodhisattvas throws the Kuei-jin courts\ninto chaos. Younger mandarins and jina attempt to step in and take up the reins of\npower, but many factions are seeking to do the same. During this time, the Kuei-jin\nare divided, following various goals. Some wish to follow in the footsteps of the\nancestors to find their path to Mount Meru. Others try to seize the opportunity to\nattain power and influence, even control over the courts now that the ancestors are\ngone. Finally, some Kuei-jin see the separation of the spirit worlds as a sign that they\nwill never achieve true enlightenment, or that they will achieve it only through\ndeath, so they set about trying to destroy themselves and possibly the world. The\ncharacters may try to follow any or all of these paths, and they might get entangled\nin the efforts of other Wan Kuei.\n• Seeking Enlightenment: Many Kuei-jin believe that the vanished ancestors\nachieved the enlightenment of the Hundred Clouds, that they discovered the secret\nof true immortality and freedom from cursed unlife. These younger vampires diligently\npursue the same goal, usually by renewed dedication to their Dharmas and efforts to\nexplore the paths of the spirit worlds before they are lost to the Kuei-jin altogether.\nThere might be an exodus into the Yin or Yang World before the Walls closes them\noff altogether. Even more Kuei-jin depart the Middle Kingdom, never to return.\nExtremists and would-be gurus among the various Dharmas become more common.\n• Seeking Power: The departure of the ancestors represents an unprecedented\nopportunity for younger Kuei-jin to finally seize power. Some ancestors carefully set\ntheir affairs in order and appoint successors to their duties, but others do not, and\nsome successions are disputed. Shadow wars break out among all of the courts of the\nMiddle Kingdom as the mandarins and jina struggle for power and control. If the\nGreat Leap Outward hasn’t already collapsed from the growth of the Wall, it almost\ncertainly will once the August Courts turn inward, consumed by their own affairs.\nThe power struggles of the Cathayans can form the basis for an entire short\nchronicle, or they can quickly erode the structure and traditions of the courts,\nbringing on the chaos of the Sixth Age.\n• Seeking Death: Finally, some Kuei-jin are overcome with despair and\nhopelessness. With the signs of the Sixth Age all around them, these vampires follow\nthe example of those ancestors who chose Final Death over unlife in the Age of\nSorrow. They face the Eye of Heaven or find other means of ending their existence.\nSome Kuei-jin might not deliberately seek death but might find it anyway when their\nenemies begin moving against them.\nTHE BARRED GATES OF HELL\nPerhaps the most important effect of the Wall’s growth is that it closes off more\nthan just the Yin and Yang Worlds. Like the Great Wall protecting China from the\ninvasion of barbarians, it also closes the Middle Kingdom off from the Yomi World\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n231\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nforever. The Yama Kings and their demons are barred from influencing the world any\nfurther. Their akuma servants are either drawn into Hell to serve their masters there\nfor all time, or they are abandoned to their fate (i.e., inevitable Final Death at the\nhands of Kuei-jin hunters). Although one of the Yama Kings must assume the throne\nof the Demon Emperor as foretold, the hosts of Yomi Wan are no longer a threat to\nthe material world.\nOf course, this also means that no souls return from beyond the Wall to inhabit\ntheir corpses and rise as the Hungry Dead. From the moment the gates of Hell are\nclosed, no more Kuei-jin arise in the world and no more will ever arise. The Wan Kuei\nare the last of their kind. If mortal souls are still drawn into Yomi upon their deaths,\nnone of them return to tell of it. The fate of Yulan-jin is yours to decide. Perhaps their\nnext Little Death is their last, returning them to Yomi, from which they cannot return.\nOr perhaps from now on, the Little Death carries them somewhere entirely different.\nCONCLUSIONS\nYou can take this story in several different directions, depending on the\noutcome you prefer. The Sixth Age can spell the end of the Kuei-jin and all\nsupernatural forces in the World of Darkness, or it might mean only a significant\nchange in the world and in the existence of the Hungry Dead.\nRATS IN THE WALLS\nOnce the Wall has cut off all contact with the spirit worlds, things might settle\ninto a new status quo among the surviving supernatural inhabitants of the World of\nDarkness. True, there will be no more Kuei-jin taking the Second Breath, and most\nof the shen are gone, but the vampires that remain are still immortal. Even faced with\ndemon-hunters and other enemies, they can survive for quite some time, continuing\nto follow their Dharmas and their own agendas, while reconstructing Kuei-jin\nsociety as best they can. This can lead to a new and different Laws of the East\nchronicle where Kuei-jin are not as numerous or powerful, in a world where they are\nslowly fading.\nTHE HAMMER FALLS\nThe disarray within the courts of the Kuei-jin has not gone unnoticed. The growth\nof the Wall and the increased need for Chi it created among the elders has attracted the\nattention of those aware of the Kuei-jin, notably the Shih and the Western Kindred, both\nof whom see the opportunity to seize upon their enemy’s weakness. With so many\nbodhisattvas and arhats gone, the enemies of the Wan Kuei strike, from Shih demon-\nhunters to Strike Force Zero agents to Kin-jin coteries, the weakened position of the\nKuei-jin invites all manner of attack. In this scenario, it is only a matter of time before\nthe enemies of the Kuei-jin hunt them all down and destroy them.\nSERPENT BITES THE HAND\nThe struggle between East and West, between the Kuei-jin and the Kindred, has\nbeen a theme of Laws of the East from the very beginning. The conflict heated up with\nthe Great Leap Outward and the Two-Fang Serpent Plan that sent Kuei-jin to the west\ncoast of North America, where they seized control of the cities of Los Angeles and later\nSan Francisco. The invasion provoked a shadow war between the Eastern and Western\nvampires. Now, with the coming of the Sixth Age, that war draws to a fateful conclusion.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n232\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Tremere clan of Kin-jin has become the focus of the conflict between the\nKuei-jin and the Camarilla. Not only have the Tremere been instrumental in the\nCamarilla’s counterstrikes against the invading Cathayans but Tremere Oliver Thrace\nalso apparently betrayed the Camarilla to the Quincunx in order to save his own skin.\nThis act placed certain Kindred secrets into Cathayan hands and gave them an\nadvantage over their Western enemies. The Kuei-jin have underestimated Oliver\nThrace, though, and their error in judgment will cost them, and the world, dearly.\nThrace has used his time as a “guest” of the Quincunx to study the Kuei-jin and\nlearn about them. He has learned how the Asian vampires come into being through\nthe descent into Yomi and the return to the world of the living when they take the\nSecond Breath. More importantly, he has contacted the Yama Kings and made a\ndevil’s bargain. He has pledged his service to Yomi in exchange for the means to\nensure permanent defeat for the Kuei-jin in their conflict.\nWith Thrace’s aid, the Tremere perform a powerful ritual that severs the ties\nbetween the Kuei-jin and the material world, banishing them back to Yomi forever and\npreventing any new souls from taking the Second Breath. The Kuei-jin are decimated\nand, as the ritual spreads, in danger of becoming extinct. The Kindred have won, but\nthey have also been deceived. The destruction of the Kuei-jin and the collection of so\nmany powerful souls grants the Yama Kings what they need to open the gates of the\nYomi World. The Tremere become the akuma pawns of the Thousand Hells, with\nOliver Thrace as agent of the Demon Emperor. The Kindred can either bow to their\nnew master or be hunted down and destroyed along with his other enemies.\nRISE OF THE WHITE DEVIL\nHow early the characters become involved with Oliver Thrace depends on\ntheir relationship with the rogue Tremere and with the August Courts of the\nQuincunx in the chronicle. If Thrace is already a recurring character in your\nchronicle, then it’s likely the characters are acquainted with him when he finally\nplays his hand. This scenario is particularly appropriate if Oliver Thrace has been a\nregular antagonist for the characters.\nIf Thrace has not entered the chronicle in the past, or the characters are not in\nthe good graces of the Quincunx, then you need to approach things differently to\nintroduce the characters to Thrace and the potential threat that he poses. There are\nECHO OF THE VANISHED MOUNTAIN\nThose familiar with the tabletop Time of Judgment book have no doubt\nrealized that one scenario, “The Trumpet of Mt. Meru,” is missing from this\nchapter. This is no oversight. Rather, while it is an intriguing vision of the End\nTimes, it was designed primarily for chronicles involving Shih demon-\nhunters as characters. While Shih characters can certainly be found in Laws\nof the East, on the whole they do not form the basis of entire troupes, and\ncombined with the increased antagonism it fosters between Shih characters\nand the rest of the shen, it was decided that this scenario was best left largely\nfor tabletop play. Therefore, while Storytellers are certainly free to look up\n“The Trumpet of Mt. Meru” in that book and adapt what they find there for\nuse in their Mind’s Eye Theatre chronicle, it has not been included here.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n233\nCHAPTER SEVEN\na number of ways to do this, ranging from assignments handed down by the Quincunx,\nmercenary bounties placed on Thrace’s head or even just a request from an ally or\nmentor to aid in tracking down the troublesome Warlock. Given how important his\nplans become, it should be fairly easy to get a diverse group of characters interested in\nhis capture before long by dropping a few hints as to his grand scheme.\nTHRACE’S ESCAPE\nUltimately, despite the best efforts of the characters or their connections,\nThrace escapes from the Quincunx and makes his way back to his fellow Tremere.\nThrace’s means of escape are up to you. What is important is that he makes good his\nescape before anyone can prevent it, although the characters may pursue Thrace one\nthey discover that he’s gone. Some potential escape routes include rescue by akuma\nor fellow Tremere, Thaumaturgy rituals, spirit walking or other esoteric means.\nNo matter what option you ultimately choose, it’s important to avoid giving the\nplayers the perception that Thrace’s escape is inevitable. As soon as your players start\nto feel as though you’re herding them toward a particular outcome, their faith in your\nchronicle will start to wane. If your characters carry out a well-developed plan to\ncapture Thrace or to prevent his escape, that’s perfectly fine. He can always escape later\nusing a different method, after all.\nIf they manage to keep him confined, preventing the start of the Screaming Plague,\nthis might be the time to start with a different end scenario, rather than inventing an\nimplausible reason for Thrace to disappear. Like reality, a good Mind’s Eye Theatre game\nshould have infinite possibilities. Nothing is set in stone or fated to happen, so if your\ncharacters are able to take Thrace out of the picture, more power to them. The end will\nstill come, just in a different way than they (or you) might have expected.\nTHE SCREAMING PLAGUE\nOliver Thrace teaches the essentials of the Breaking the Demon Bonds rite to\nother Tremere, at least enough to convince them that the ritual can work and that\nthey need him in order to perform it properly. Eager to eliminate the Kuei-jin threat,\nthe Camarilla grants Thrace permission to perform the ritual, beginning in the\noccupied areas of California. The ritual breaks the ties holding the Kuei-jin to their\nmortal corpses, sending them back into exile in Yomi. To observers in the material\nworld, the Kuei-jin simply begin keeling over and rotting away en masse, their spirits\ndragged screaming back into Hell.\nThe Wan Kuei call this outbreak the Screaming Plague, and they find that no\ndefense is sufficient to work against it. Kuei-jin meet Final Death by the dozens, then\nthe hundreds, as the Tremere continue the ritual and its power expands. At your\ndiscretion, Kuei-jin who attempt to escape into the Yin World might be safe, since\nafter being separated from their bodies, they are really little more than wraiths. If\nthey succeed in doing so, though, crossing the Wall back into the Middle Kingdom\nstill sends them instantly back to Yomi unless the ritual has been stopped.\nDRAGGED DOWN INTO HELL\nThe characters are in the presence of other Kuei-jin — perhaps their elders are\nwelcoming them to the city or hearing a report of their activities — when one of the\nKuei-jin convulses, screams in agony and collapses. Almost immediately the Kuei-jin’s\ncorpse begins to rot into dust. Then another one collapses, and another. Fortunately\nfor the characters, but unfortunately for the Kuei-jin, the Tremere ritual is most\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n234\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\neffective against the elder Cathayans, who carry the greatest weight of years upon\nthem. So the first vampires destroyed by it are the eldest in the city, throwing\neverything into chaos as the younger mandarins and jina are forced to assume control,\nonly to eventually fall victim to what becomes known as the “Screaming Plague.”\nThe characters are left without the guidance of their elders, but also with the\nopportunity to take charge of the situation, if they can. Unfortunately, there is little\nthey can do except try to find out what is happening and help organize an evacuation\nof the surviving Kuei-jin, since the ritual destroys the eldest vampires on the first\nnight, then slowly builds in power until no Kuei-jin can survive in the area. Younger\nvampires show signs resembling permanent Yin imbalance after the first day, and\nafter seven days, even the youngest Kuei-jin in the city is destroyed. (This timeline\nmight need to be adjusted to suit the needs of your chronicle. It is advised, however,\nnot to make it too long, lest the urgency of the threat be lost.)\nWhat happens next depends on what the characters do. They might try to find\na way to stop the Tremere ritual, seek a cure or defense against the Screaming Plague,\nor even be willing to bargain with one of the Yama Kings in order to ensure their own\nsurvival (and that of their kind).\nQUINCUNX COUNTERSTRIKE\nIf the characters believe (correctly) that Oliver Thrace and the Tremere are\nresponsible for the Screaming Plague, they might want to try to stop the Kin-jin.\nKuei-jin may discover the origin of the plague through their own rituals and Occult\nknowledge, although a means of overcoming the Tremere ritual is a far more\ncomplicated matter, particularly given the loss of so many ancestors and mandarins.\nBy the time the remaining Kuei-jin figure out a defense, it could be too late.\nOne possibility is to strike against the Tremere and stop them from continuing\nthe ritual. The Kuei-jin may make a concerted effort to launch an attack on every\nTremere chantry that they can reach. The difficulty is that the ritual has an extensive\nreach and the Tremere are well guarded by their Camarilla allies, who intend to buy\nthem the time they need to wipe out the Cathayans once and for all. Any attack on\na chantry would have to be well coordinated and quick, and the Kuei-jin would face\na group of well-armed Kin-jin defenders.\nThis allows you the opportunity to run some major battle scenes between the\nKuei-jin and their enemies. Out of their desperation to survive, the Kuei-jin might\neven ignore the usual efforts to hide from the mortal world, compromising the\nexistence of vampires among mortals.\nDEVIL’S BARGAIN\nAlthough the remaining Kuei-jin might not have either the time or the means to\ncreate a defense against the Tremere rituals, they do have one other option: bargaining\nwith the Yama Kings who gave Oliver Thrace the secrets of the ritual in the first place.\nDoing so requires a wu to either travel into Yomi or to summon a Yama King to Earth\n— neither particularly easy tasks. They can either try to cut a deal with the particular\nYama Kings who gave Thrace the ritual (Mikaboshi and Tou Mu), or they can contact\none (or more) of the other Yama Kings.\nNegotiation with one or more of the Yama Kings opens an excellent opportunity for\nextended roleplaying. Depending on which Yama King the characters decide to contact,\nthey might have to go to Yomi to negotiate or submit to a test to prove their worth before\nthe Yama King will even hear them. Use your imagination for these tests and for depicting\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n235\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nwhichever of the Thousand Hells the King presides over, as the end of the chronicle should\nbe as memorable as possible for your players. The more time you spend planning their\nconfrontation with one of the Yama Kings — whom they’ve most likely spent the majority\nof the game trying to avoid — the more your players will thank you for it later.\nRAISED UPON TEN THOUSAND SOULS\nThe purpose of the Breaking the Demon Bonds rite is actually twofold. First, it\nallows the Tremere to eliminate the Kuei-jin, sending their souls to Yomi. But it also\nputs the souls of the destroyed Kuei-jin into the hands of Mikaboshi and Tou Mu,\ngreatly increasing their power. It corrupts the Tremere and binds their souls to the\nservice of the Yama Kings. As the ritual nears its conclusion, the Sixth Age dawns\nand the Yama Kings come to claim their rightful thrones.\nThe Tremere chantries where the ritual is performed become broken mirrors,\ngateways into the Yomi World, as the fabric of the Wall is ripped apart by the passage\nof so many Kuei-jin torn from their corpses and cast back into Hell. Corrupt Chi\nwells up from these sores in the surface of the world, spreading outward. The Tremere\nare the first to be corrupted by it, and they become the demonically tainted servants\nof the Yama Kings. But that is only the beginning.\nAt first, nearly invisible waves of corrupt Chi spread a pall across the world.\nDespair and corruption intensifies immensely. Riots and small wars break out as\nmortals are influenced by the power of Yomi. Violence and crime skyrocket. The\nauthorities respond with increasingly brutal countermeasures. Despite their best\nefforts, supernatural beings such as the Kindred can do nothing to stop this tsunami\nof violence and destructiveness. In fact, they also become caught up in it, as childe\nrebels against elder, anarch against Camarilla, turning on each other like wild dogs.\nEven at this point, characters may try to stem the tide of Yomi’s victory. They\nmight be able to seal one of the hellgates created by the Tremere ritual, either with\na ritual of their own or through self-sacrifice. If they’re successful, they create a small\nisland of untainted Chi, which might become a stronghold to oppose the Yama\nKings, if the chronicle continues. Otherwise, it is merely a fading remnant of the\nFifth Age that will eventually yield to the inevitable.\nAs the violence peaks, Yomi begins to flood into the world through the rents\nand gaps in the Wall, spreading everywhere. Hordes of demons and ghosts are loosed.\nMillions die at the hands of the creatures of Hell, and their souls swell the ranks of\nthe Yama Kings’ armies. The Sixth Age comes and the victorious Yama King (with\nthe greatest number of souls reaped from the rituals) claims the title of Demon\nEmperor, to rule over the world until the Wheel of Ages turns once more.\nFURTHER STORIES\nAlthough this story spells the end of the Fifth Age, it does not necessarily have\nto spell the end of your Laws of the East chronicle, particularly if the characters\nsurvived the events of Yomi’s ascension. “Serpent Bites the Hand” can form the\nbeginning of an entirely new chronicle set in a future world dominated by the Yama\nKings, with the players taking the roles of the few surviving Kuei-jin who still\nstruggle against the Demon Emperor and his akuma servants. Alternatively, the\ncharacters could be Shih demon-hunters, the last defenders of humanity, seeking to\noverthrow the tyrant Yama Kings (or perhaps even an alliance between the Shih and\nthe remaining Wan Kuei).\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n236\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nYou can run a long-term chronicle of survival and rebellion in the Sixth Age, or\na story that culminates in victory over the Yama Kings, ushering in a new turning of\nthe Wheel of Ages, starting the cycle all over again. If you prefer, you could instead run\na chronicle where characters exiled to Yomi or the Yin World try to work from within\nto destroy the power base of the Demon Emperor.\nWICKED CITY\nFor Ages, the Yama Kings have fought and struggled for dominion over souls, for\ngreater power both in Yomi and in the Middle Kingdom. They have sought the souls\nof the Kuei-jin in particular, souls that were once theirs, but which escaped from the\ntorments of Yomi to return to the world of the living. All of those struggles have been\ntoward one end: the coming of the Sixth Age and the time when one of the Yama Kings\nwould ascend to the throne of the Demon Emperor and rule over the world. That time\nhas come, and the Lords of Yomi — one in particular — are ready to make their move.\nINTRODUCTION\nMikaboshi, Lord of the Wicked City, is something of a non-traditional Yama\nKing, fascinated with the trappings and doings of the modern world, rather than\nsome hell described in ancient sutras. Mikaboshi is a cutting-edge demon, invested\nin what he sees as a growth market — one that is about to pay off handsomely.\nCities, and the blight they breed, are Mikaboshi’s stock in trade. Over the years,\nhe has wormed tendrils of his Wicked City into metropolises across the world. Not\njust in the Middle Kingdom, but in any city the Kuei-jin have penetrated. His latest\nconquests have been the North American cities occupied by the Ocean-Crossing\nCrusaders of the Great Leap Outward, but he has been cultivating cities throughout\nthe Middle Kingdom for many years now. Throughout all those cities, in the darkest\nplaces of urban decay, the seeds of Mikaboshi’s power germinate, and now the time\nis right for them to sprout.\nOne of the seeds that the Lord of the Wicked City has planted is in the heart\nof Strike Force Zero, the secret organization of Japanese demon-hunters. Although\nthe Zaibatsu considers SF0 its agents for hunting down and eliminating “Reality\nDeviants,” it is unaware that the Strike Force ultimately serves Mikaboshi’s purpose\nby eliminating potential threats and agents of his rivals, ensuring that the Yama King\nwill rise to power when the time is right.\nBROKEN MIRRORS\nThe first signs of Mikaboshi’s rise to power are the places where the flows of Chi\nhave become so fouled by urban blight that the Wall has grown tattered and as thin\nas rice paper, allowing light and shadows from Yomi to spill over into the material\nworld. These “broken mirrors” are extensions of Mikaboshi’s Hell on Earth, places\nwhere the Wicked City touches the real world and where it is possible to step\nbetween the two, sometimes without even knowing it.\nA wu can discover a broken mirror in whatever city it calls home. Perhaps the\ncharacters are asked to investigate strange portents and sightings in the area or they\ndo so on their own initiative. They discover that the Yomi World is pressing its way\ninto the Middle Kingdom like a cancer, and that it is growing. In fact, after they are\ndiscovered, the broken mirrors begin to grow and multiply. Not only do they begin\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n237\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nto appear in cities around the world, some cities also have more than one place where\nthe jaws of Yomi yawn wide.\nAccusations and counter-accusations fly among the Kuei-jin, but it becomes\nevident that not only are the broken mirrors becoming more extensive, there doesn’t\nseem to be much that the Wan Kuei can do about them. Rituals to cleanse and re-\nbalance the Chi in an area are temporarily effective against some of the newly formed\nsores in the skin of reality, but the hellgates erupt elsewhere a short while later, and\nthe sorcerers of the Kuei-jin cannot keep pace with their appearances.\nThe signs are clear. The Sixth Age has come, and the Kuei-jin must prepare for war.\nFIRST, PREPARE FOR WAR\nAlthough most Kuei-jin — at least the followers of the Fivefold Way of Xue —\nagree that it is their duty to oppose the Yama Kings and their akuma servants, the\ncourts of the Wan Kuei are nowhere near united. Not even the impending invasion\nof Hell can force them to set aside their differences to work together, though the\nefforts of the characters might.\nAncestors and arhats call war councils and meetings across the Middle King-\ndom. Different courts prepare to repel the forces of Yomi, whatever the cost. After\nall, the Kuei-jin have all experienced the domain and the power of the Yama Kings\nfirsthand, and they know that even Final Death is preferable to existing in the realm\nof Yomi on Earth. In fact, some Kuei-jin, faced with the arrival of the Sixth Age,\nmight choose Final Death rather than battle the armies of the Yama Kings, leading\nthem to face the Eye of Heaven or otherwise abandon their hold on unlife.\nEvery wu in the city can take part in various war councils. If the characters are in\npositions of influence, they might be entrusted with planning the defense of their area\nor domain. If not, then perhaps the characters’ superiors fall victim to an attack by\nakuma or one of the first assaults by Strike Force Zero, leaving the characters in charge.\nCharacters can also take on a diplomatic role, going among the different courts\nof the Kuei-jin trying to rally support for a unified defense against the Yomi Wan,\nperhaps even a pre-emptive strike that takes the fight to the Yama Kings themselves.\nThey can act as representatives of a particular court or ancestor, or they can go it alone,\ntrying to put together an alliance among the suspicious and treacherous undead.\nHow successful the characters are depends on their efforts, but even the most\nsuccessful plans sometimes go awry, and the Kuei-jin must deal with Mikaboshi’s\nown preemptive strikes by the Yama King’s secret weapon.\nZERO HOUR\nThe secret organization known as Strike Force Zero has been hunting monsters\nfor years, using high-tech weapons and equipment beyond that of even the most\nsophisticated government black-ops program. What most of the agents of SF0 don’t\nknow is that their equipment and their mandate comes from the Zaibatsu, the\nJapanese branch of the Technocracy — a secret alliance that seeks to define and\ncontrol the nature of reality. What even the Zaibatsu doesn’t know is that Strike\nForce Zero ultimately serves Mikaboshi’s ends. The Lord of the Wicked City intends\nto infuse the technology and the agents of Strike Force Zero with his corrupt Chi and\nturn the hunters of demons into his secret weapons.\nAs the Kuei-jin discover and investigate the broken mirrors spreading throughout\nthe world’s cities, they also encounter Strike Force Zero agents, apparently doing the\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n238\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nsame. Naturally, the SF0 agents assume that the Kuei-jin are responsible for the unusual\nphenomena and do their best to capture and interrogate them. Failing that, they attempt\nto simply destroy the vampires. These encounters become increasingly common, and\nSF0 begins to gather more information about the Kuei-jin and their activities.\nThe more time the SF0 agents spend in the broken mirrors, the more the corrupt\nDemon Chi of Yomi and the Wicked City begins to influence them. This influence\nspreads among the other agents of the organization like a plague, as SF0 spends more\ntime “investigating” the broken mirrors. Characters might notice that the mortal\nagents become more callous and violent than usual. They care less for civilian\ncasualties or the need for secrecy, doing whatever it takes to get at the monsters\nthey’re hunting. They’re willing to allow torture, mutilation and massive collateral\ndamage — whatever it takes to get the job done.\nRISE OF THE WICKED CITY\nOnce Mikaboshi’s broken mirrors have corrupted most of the agents of Strike\nForce Zero and the characters have had an opportunity to try to rally the forces of the\nMiddle Kingdom to repel the threat of the Yama Kings, the next step in Mikaboshi’s\nplan takes place. The corrupt Demon Chi of the broken mirrors and the wickedness\nit inspires in the mortal populace causes the sores in the world’s Chi to expand, as the\nWicked City begins to invade the Middle Kingdom and eat away at reality.\nInitially, the broken mirrors are confined to urban areas, which are incorpo-\nrated into Mikaboshi’s Wicked City. Soon, all major cities in the world are part of\nthe Yama King’s domain. The shen inhabiting them have no choice but to flee or to\nswear their allegiance to Mikaboshi. This includes Western cities and shen such as\nthe Kin-jin, who find their own squabbles brought to a halt by the sudden invasion.\nMany Kin-jin fall victim to the corruption of Yomi, giving themselves over to\nMikaboshi for the opportunity to feed within his domain, tainted by the Demon Chi\nof the mortals they hunt.\nMikaboshi’s agents hunt Kuei-jin in cities from Hong Kong to San Francisco.\nAkuma become increasingly common and emerge from the shadows to take their place\nleading hunting parties. Although they attempt to hold them, the August Courts are\nforced to retreat from their urban stronghold, at the cost of many Kuei-jin being\ndestroyed by Mikaboshi’s mechanized demons. The same is true for courts across the\nMiddle Kingdom. The savage Kuei-jin of the Golden Courts fare slightly better than\nthe rest, able to flee into the jungles, but even there the hunters become the hunted.\nCharacters might attempt to help defend one or more of the courts against the\ninvasion of demons, bakemono and akuma, fighting a losing battle against the forces\nof the Wicked City before they are forced to either flee or make a final stand they\ncan’t possibly survive. Meeting Final Death in the defense of Kuei-jin history and\ntradition is a fitting end for some characters, while others might help engineer an\nevacuation of the strongholds of the Hungry Dead, allowing surviving Kuei-jin to\nescape the cities that are now under the Yama King’s dominion.\nDEFENDING THE DRAGON NESTS\nOnce the broken mirrors have extended over all the cities in the world, their\ncharacter changes significantly. Every city becomes an extension of the Wicked\nCity, a beachhead of the Yomi World. The buildings become taller, more jagged and\nloom overhead: dark towers that block out the sun and leave the streets in perpetual\nshadow. Architecture twists and becomes more gothic while also taking on a more\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n239\nCHAPTER SEVEN\nfuturistic Asian flavor. The negative aspects of the cities become more pronounced.\nCorruption, violence and malice run rampant. Homelessness, substance abuse,\ncruelty and vice become increasingly common. Clouds gather day and night over the\ntops of the towers of glass and steel, blocking out the sun and spitting acidic rain\ndown on the masses below.\nThe inhabitants of the cities are transformed as well. Some become raw\nmaterials for the factories and chop shops turning out legions of Mikaboshi’s Demons\nof Iron and Violence. The rest are still twisted by the corruption, looking out solely\nfor themselves and more than willing to look the other way as Mikaboshi works his\nwill on the world. Order in the cities is brutally maintained while law and order in\nthe countryside gives way to fear and panic.\nThen the cities begin to grow.\nIt’s slow at first, but then it comes increasingly faster, to the point where the urban\ncenters expand outward hundreds of feet each day. They send out root-like tendrils of\nwire, asphalt and steel that dig deep into the Earth. They flow along roads, rivers and\nthe dragon lines of Chi, stretching out in all directions, spreading like bloodstains in\nthe fabric of the Earth, and nothing seems able to halt their growth. Indeed, anyone\nwho tries must deal with legions of the Yama King’s demons and bakemono.\nThe Wicked City infiltrates and assimilates places with the lowest ambient Chi\nfirst, gradually working its way into the dragon lines and, finally, the dragon nests, to\nconsume the Chi there and feed it into the great machine of Mikaboshi’s empire.\nTherefore, the dragon nests are the last havens of the Kuei-jin and any others who oppose\nMikaboshi’s conquest. The characters might attempt to organize the defense of the\ndragon nests, hoping to keep such powerful sources of Chi from falling to the Yama King.\nThe nests also serve as the last remaining sources of Yin and Yang Chi for the Kuei-jin,\nallowing them to feed without being corrupted by the Demon Chi of Yomi.\nFURTHER STORIES\nIn addition to being the end of a Laws of the East chronicle, “Wicked City” can\nserve as the basis for an entirely new chronicle, set in a Sixth Age under the rule of\nthe Yama King Mikaboshi and his Iron Empress, Tou Mu. In this world, the Wicked\nCity extends everywhere, even paving over the oceans, creating vast, lightless seas\nbeneath iron and concrete skies. Black, skeletal buildings reach up to a sky the color\nof blood, covered with slate-gray clouds that pour poisonous rain. All creatures are\nsubject to Mikaboshi’s will, cogs in the vast machine that is the Wicked City, ruled\nby his demon lieutenants, some of them akuma Kuei-jin.\nThe characters in this chronicle can be Kuei-jin survivors of Mikaboshi’s purge,\nrogue agents of Strike Force Zero, Shih demon-hunters, dhampyrs, or any combina-\ntion thereof. Perhaps the characters are mortals born and raised in this hellish world,\nrecruited by surviving demon-hunters and trained as part of an underground\nresistance against the Demon Emperor’s rule. There is a prophecy, foretold in\nancient sutras, that says the righteous will one day rise up against the Demon\nEmperor and his Wicked City will be swept away, bringing about a new Age of peace,\nbeauty and serenity. The few other shen remaining might also be involved in a\nchronicle of this type.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n240\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n241\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER E\n E\n E\n E\n EIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nINTRODUCTION\nAll things must come to an end, or so mortals believe. But the Undying, those\nreborn into immortal life, know that what seems to be an ending can also be a\nbeginning — perhaps the beginning of something never-ending. Nonetheless, the\nimmortals of the World of Darkness see the growing signs and portents that suggest\ntheir efforts to restore the balance, to serve as champions of life, might have come\ntoo late. Everywhere there are signs of corruption and the rising power of Apophis,\nand it seems that the Undying, who once had all eternity stretched out before them,\nare rapidly running out of time.\nThis chapter details the end of the World of Darkness as seen by the Undying\n— the mummies of Egypt, described in Laws of the Resurrection. It describes two\ndifferent approaches to the last days of the Reborn and how they deal with the ending\nof an existence they once thought would never end. Like the endings given in this\nbook, the scenarios are speculation, simply two of the possibilities of what might\nhappen. As always, the ultimate direction of the story is up to the Storyteller.\nAPOPHIS ASCENDS\nOsiris and Isis created the first Egyptian mummies to defend the world from the\nminions of Apophis. These Shemsu-heru waged war upon the undead children of Set\nand the seven immortal blasphemies known as the Apepnu. As the conflict dragged\non for millennia without end, the champions of Osiris lost their way, diminished by\nthe weight of ennui, selfishness and the seeming futility of their burdensome quest.\nAnd so they failed, and the howling winds of the Dja-akh scoured the beloved city\nof Amenti. Those mummies reborn in the modern era from the shattered relics of the\nancient and modern dead owe their existence to the failure of their predecessors.\nAnd yet, out of failure and despair, hope arises. The Amenti awaken with new\npurpose and passion, certain they have both the power to save the world and an\neternity in which to save it.\nThey are wrong.\nCHAPTER EIGHT:\nARMAGEDDON\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n242\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nApophis stirs.

Loyal cultists cull the ranks of monsters and reclaim\nthe scattered shards of their dead god’s soul. The bloodline of Set and the brood of\nthe Corrupter fall to treachery in back alleys and hidden crypts. Even the mighty\nApepnu find themselves hunted by demons they do not know, roughly cast aside in\nfavor of a new champion.\nThe final battle between the champions of Ma’at and Apophis is at hand.\nPRELUDE: THE COMING OF EURYDICE\nWhen a tem-akh appears to a new ghost and offers a second chance at life, the\nsoul must accept the joining. Most do. The dead crave life as nothing else and\nhungrily seize any chance at renewed warmth and breath. Yet, some ghosts refuse the\ngift of resurrection, for reasons of madness or pride or cynicism. It is their right, and\nnone receive a second chance. Such ghosts go on with their shadowed afterlives,\nclinging to the wan sustenance of memory and regret. One such soul was Eurydice.\nEurydice’s true name remains lost to her along with most of the details of her\nlife. When the ancient soul of a tem-akh appeared before her and spoke of rebirth\nand hope, she recoiled in fear and bade the shade leave her. Saddened, the tem-\nakh departed and found another host. This would have ended the ghost’s story in\nthe greater tale of the Amenti, were it not for the woman’s unusual tenacity of will.\nAfter a time in the Underworld, she was eventually led her back to her corpse,\nwhere she found the strength to rise as one of the walking dead. Touched by the\nwisps of memory left by her brief contact with the tem-akh, the ghost knew that\nher destiny somehow lay in Egypt. She made her own perilous hajj to the Web of\nFaith and sought out the cultists of which the tem-akh had spoken. She repre-\nsented a sorrow to them, for they could not give her life. So they turned her away\nto find her own path.\nThe nameless revenant remained in the holy lands, watching and ultimately\nenvying the Reborn from afar. She grew obsessed with resurrection, even as her\nrelentless khaibit gnawed at her nobler self. Envy grew to hate, and she felt\nabandoned and betrayed. She thought it unjust that she could not have life when\ncorpse after corpse stumbled from the far corners of the world to breathe again. She\nblamed the tem-akh for failing to overcome her fear. When her hate and the\nwhispers of the Devourer swallowed the last of her soul, she followed the voice of\ncorruption to a hidden cell of Amkhat cannibal-sorcerers. In a defiled crypt hidden\ndeep in the sands, she interrupted the cult’s bloody feast and butchered them one by\none until the survivors bowed before her. Aided by her new servants, the embittered\nEurydice began a bold plot to steal the resurrection she believed the world owed her.\nHer agents roamed the Web of Faith and kidnapped sorcerers faithful to Osiris, but\nsuch victims proved useless. They knew only part of the ritual, and even then, only\nthe part that required access to the Sekhem of Osiris. Eurydice personally captured\none of the Amenti, but this target knew even less about the Spell of Life, so she\nturned his flesh over to her servants. All seemed hopeless…\nUntil Kemintiri found her.\nKnown and feared among other vampires as an ancient, maddened demigod,\nKemintiri stumbled out of the moon-draped dunes like a prophet of old. In her veins\nflowed the blood of Set, first Chosen of Apophis, and her shattered mind held\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n243\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER E\n E\n E\n E\n EIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nrevelations better left unspoken. Something called her away from her masquerades\namong the undead, her endless, pointless series of impersonations. Something had\ncalled her into the deep desert of Egypt to receive a prophecy — and a message.\nEurydice would live again, and vanished Set would no longer bear favor as the\nChosen of Apophis.\nEurydice offered gracious hospitality to her strange and godlike guest, butcher-\ning her servants when they failed to bring sufficient victims to satisfy the Ancient’s\nhunger. Yet, little more than mad rambles escaped Kemintiri’s blood-soaked lips. In\ntime, Eurydice grew impatient with the babble. She had heard enough, and still,\ndreadful hope stirred in her unbeating heart. As Set’s child lay writhing in the throes\nof some seizure or revelation one evening — Eurydice no longer cared which — the\narisen ghost plunged a stake into the vampire’s heart. Kemintiri stilled and muttered\nno more. Under order from their ambitious leader, the Amkhat took the blood of\ntheir captive and worked foul alchemy upon it. Her ramblings and fragmented notes\nmerged with stolen and forbidden spells of necromancy. Together, the Amkhat\nmade their own mockery of the Spell of Life, crude and rooted in magic older and\ndeeper than even they knew.\nA great assembly of the Amkhat gathered in a secret place for the casting of the\nspell. Fully one-third perished when the magic grew beyond their control and sucked\naway their souls to fuel the forbidden enchantment. Infused with alchemy distilled\nfrom the blood of Kemintiri, and through her the blood of the first Chosen of\nApophis, Eurydice was transformed. For seven agonizing beats her heart pumped,\nand seven breaths filled her dead lungs. And yet, she did not live. Out of failure she\nbecame something more, something terrible. The favor of her god lay upon her with\ndread purpose, and she knew at last how she might live again. Apophis stirred\nbeneath the realm of the dead, rising in slow coils. He would be her tem-akh and she\nwas now his chosen instrument of that ascent. All she needed was to reclaim the\nseven ifrit of the Great Serpent’s soul from those who dared call themselves Children\nof Apophis. Their death would be her life.\nAnd her life would birth Apophis into this world.\nASSASSINATION\nAs the story begins, Eurydice has sent her stalkers to locate and slay the\nseven Apepnu. The characters should discover this plot early enough to inter-\nvene before Eurydice grows too powerful. Presented here are the two most likely\ndiscovery scenarios.\nTHE FACE OF EVIL\nThe characters have already been tracking the actions of a Bane mummy,\nperhaps as part of an earlier story. Well-prepared with equipment, architectural\nplans and strategy, they break into the lair of one of the ancient fiends only to find\nthe mangled corpses of his guards strewn about and the walls spattered with warm\ngore. The dwar carefully works its way through secret passages, half-sprung traps and\nother obstacles to the innermost sanctum of the fortified haven. There the charac-\nters find their undying quarry kneeling battered and bleeding, surrounded by a pack\nof strange animal-headed creatures. Before any of the characters can intervene, the\nleader of the pack strikes a deathblow and inserts a long tongue into one of the\nApepnu’s wounds. Sickly green light flows into the fanged muzzle, and the lifeless\nbody of the mummy falls to the ground. It is then that the creatures notice the\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n244\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\ncharacters, growl at them and crouch to pounce. As the characters leap into the fray\nor prepare for attack, the leader of the beasts barks an order in its strange rasping\nlanguage and the entire pack dissolves into wisps of fine sand. Alone in the silence\nof the abattoir, the characters may retrieve the corpse of their slain enemy or simply\nescape to inform their superiors.\nAN UNLIKELY TALE\nLess militant Amenti might learn about the strange assassination of the Bane\nMummy indirectly. Superiors could forward the transcripts and reports provided by\nmummies who directly observed such events. Alternatively, the characters’ dwar\nmight be called to assist in the interrogation of a mortal witness who hid and saw\neverything through a crack in a doorway. Such a witness would be unreliable at best,\nand probably quite mad from the sheer horror of the events. Information obtained\nfrom such questioning would be rife with falsehoods and exaggerations, while\ncontaining enough truth to scare the characters and suggest the arrival of a new\nplayer in the immortal game. For a stranger twist, the characters might find\nthemselves approached by a Four Jar or other thrall of the murdered Apepnu, willing\nto trade information for protection from the monsters. The characters shouldn’t\ntrust such a tainted informant and might suspect a trap. But then, what could scare\nan undead monster so badly that it would turn to its enemies for safety? Such an\nencounter should shake the characters and impress upon them the level of danger\nposed by the mysterious assassins.\nRegardless of how the characters learn of the first assassination, it will not be\nthe last. Within a week of the killing, another Bane Mummy dies under similarly\ngruesome circumstances. It is clear that someone — or something — is systemati-\ncally hunting the Apepnu. The five remaining Bane Mummies scatter, each\nsuspecting one another of masterminding the deaths. The leadership of the Amenti\nshares this suspicion, yet none of the evidence points to any of the survivors as\nsuspects. No one wants to believe that there might be a new power among them, least\nof all the Children of Apophis.\nSTALKING THE STALKERS\nIn the wake of the two assassinations, the Apepnu go to ground. Many of their\nknown agents or associates likewise retreat into seclusion or take extended vacations\nfar from their usual hangouts. The Amenti leaders sense that this conflict is more\nthan a turf war among the Children of Apophis. Such undying monsters have little\nreason to fear assassination, except as a temporary setback. And yet, the Bane\nMummies hide and send their most trusted agents across the world searching for\nanswers. It soon becomes apparent that they are truly afraid, and that that fear makes\nthem vulnerable. How the characters investigate this situation depends on their\nstrengths and upon the needs of the Storyteller.\nDIGGING FOR CLUES\nThe characters may seek out the killers, trying to find out the identity and origin\nof the strange monstrosities. Such an investigation could follow any number of\npaths. The characters can hunt in old occult libraries and somehow buy, barter or\neven break into private collections on a trail of vague references and tantalizing\nclues. All tests for such an obscure subject as the stalkers has a minimum difficulty\nof 11 Traits, with each additional successful test yielding assorted clues that seem to\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n245\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER E\n E\n E\n E\n EIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\ntrail back into one another. For example, a single success might yield the fact that\nfigures bearing strong resemblance to the animal-headed assassins appear on a\ncartouche unearthed at a dig south of Abydos. The characters would then have to\ntrack down this cartouche and translate it, which in turn might point them\nelsewhere. Players should not feel they are getting the runaround, but their\ncharacters should recognize the obscurity and elusiveness of their quarry. Amenti\nwho are familiar with the supernatural might be tempted to assume that the attacks\nwere carried out by werewolves or other shapeshifters, but all their research (as well\nas any direct experience they might have had with the beasts) leads them elsewhere.\nThese assassins are not werewolves.\nOther useful facts the characters might obtain through more thorough\nresearch include the following: Though sunlight does them no harm, the beasts\nhunt only at night (three successful tests). The creatures serve Apophis directly,\nand only the greatest champions of the Great Serpent may control them (four\nsuccessful tests). These “stalkers” have the power to travel as the racing\nsandstorm and to smell sin like desert beasts smell water (five successful tests).\nThe ritual used to summon these stalkers requires large quantities of human\nblood and certain specific herbs and unguents. Enterprising characters might\nbegin tracking recent purchases of these materials and match the purchase\nlocations against missing-person reports.\nCALLING IN OLD DEBTS\nMummies less interested in archeology and research can investigate directly,\napproaching long-time informants and those “in the know” about the twilight world\nof the supernatural. It takes little effort to recognize the undercurrent of fear. Old\ncontacts don’t want to talk about it or claim retirement from the business, but very\nfew have any idea what is actually happening. Vampires of Set’s bloodline might\nknow that a few of their older members have disappeared recently (though certainly\nnot the identity of the true culprit), but they might be lying or feigning ignorance.\nOther vampires don’t have a clue, except for the most sorcerously inclined, and even\nthey have only vague omens and auguries of impending doom.\nMages certainly know more, if only because more wizards are prone to checking\ntheir horoscopes and doing the kinds of tarot spreads that simply aren’t fashionable.\nComets, ill omens and other portents suggest that something horrible is coming, and\nall the signs point back to the Middle East and the Web of Faith. It’s not much to\ngo on, but it’s enough to set the stage for deeper inquiry and to establish a tone of\nforeboding. Extremely fortunate and/or well-connected characters can learn about\na recent shake-up in the leadership of the Amkhat and the rise of a new priestess in\nthe cult. The Amkhat should not appear as likely suspects in the assassinations,\nhowever, at least not at first.\nTHE FIEND OF MY FIEND\nInstead of tracking the killers, the characters might focus on the victims.\nInvestigation into the slain Apepnu reveals little of much worth, unfortunately. The\nslain were up to their necks in dirty deals and schemes, but that was usual. Indeed,\nnothing about their unfinished plots seems any more or less dastardly than any\nprevious exploits. Profiling to discover what made the slain immortals any different\nfrom their surviving counterparts suggests only one possible common link: Both of\nthem perished in strongholds they had established long ago. In short, they died\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n246\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nwhere someone in the know might reasonably expect to find them. With the rest of\nthe Apepnu scattered, that common thread no longer applies to any of the others.\nRACING THE HUNT\nIn a slight variation of the preceding, the characters can hunt down the\nsurviving Apepnu — or at least try. Such a feat is extremely dangerous, regardless of\nsuccess. Either the quarry will learn of the search and send minions to deal with the\nmeddlesome sleuths, or the stalkers will discover the search in progress and allow the\ncharacters to ferret out their prey. An extremely “successful” investigation might\nswiftly lead the characters into the grasp of a paranoid Bane Mummy who was eager\nto make an example of any rival or threat. The ancient monster might even believe\nthat the characters are the assassins of his brethren, come to kill him. Those who are\nunfortunate enough to fall captive to the Apepnu can probably look forward to a slow\nand painful demise unless rescued.\nCAUGHT IN THE CROSSFIRE\nIf the characters do not seem to grasp the gravity of the situation, or if their\ninvestigation runs into a maze of dead ends, the Storyteller may consider dramati-\ncally upping the stakes. Another Bane Mummy dies, but not without taking out\na city block — or a city district — with powerful Dark Hekau. Such a cataclysm\ncertainly points to a previously unconsidered danger, namely the possibility that\nmany innocent bystanders will suffer or perish as a result of the mysterious power\nsquabble. In any case, another Bane Mummy should eventually die during the\ncourse of the investigation.\nTHE GATHERING STORM\nWith the third murder among the Apepnu, the Dja-akh abruptly stops. The\nshrieking clouds pull back into the dark recesses of Duat and an eerie calm settles\nover the Lands of the Dead. However welcome, the lull feels distinctly unnatural —\nless a sign of peace than the rushing out of the tide before a great tsunami.\nWorldwide, the Shroud rating drops by one to a minimum rating of 2 in any specific\nlocation. Mediums, psychics and mages blessed with prescience suffer dreams rife\nwith ill portents, haunted even in waking by images of a red star and a maimed hydra\ncleaved of its many heads. One or more of the characters might experience such\ndreams or dreams of like symbolism. It won’t take much to realize the likely (and,\nindeed, accurate) significance: Apophis recalls its own. What was once many\ngathers to one. The Apepnu are not being murdered… they are being harvested.\nAs portents grow worse and the characters come to realize the plan behind the\nplot, their investigations should bear fruit that leads them steadily back to Eurydice\nand the Amkhat. Any of the following revelations will prove useful.\nBURIED OMENS\nResearch into the stalkers eventually leads to a previously undiscovered crypt\nlocated anywhere the Storyteller desires. Inside the tomb, a torpid vampire lies in a\nsarcophagus surrounded by prophetic murals. The pictures narrate the rise and fall\nof the Amkhat through many civilizations, some of which history does not record or\nremember. The last picture of the series shows a bloody harvest. The Eaters of Flesh\nprostrate themselves like wheat before the dead flesh of a woman enthroned, a coiled\nserpent on her brow.

Over and silhouetted behind the goddess sits a blackened sun, and each\nray is the unmistakable form of a lunging stalker.\nA NEST OF VIPERS\nAll the leads and financial tracing of alchemical supplies and mysterious\ndisappearances points back to a rural village in Egypt or Palestine. The clues could\nbe a trap set by Eurydice or a canny aide, in which case the characters have to fight\ntheir way free from well-armed cultists. A red herring of this magnitude should\ncertainly point the way to the true location if the characters escape, allowing players\nto feel a sense of progress.\nAlternatively, and more simply, the village is as it appears. This is where\nEurydice first summoned her stalkers, and the characters might even find Kemintiri\nhidden and staked in a cistern or deep cellar. The Chosen of Apophis is long gone,\nhaving sought a more auspicious location for her ascension. She might have left\nsurprises or assassins behind to make sure that she is not interrupted during her\napotheosis. In any case, the characters should have the opportunity to interrogate\na captured Amkhat cultist who proudly boasts, “Eurydice will devour the flesh of the\nsun. In darkness she will feast upon the children of Osiris, and all the world shall be\nher blackened banquet.”\nSTRANGE BEDFELLOWS\nAs Eurydice’s plot draws close to cataclysmic fruition, more Apepnu die. The\nmanner of their passing is irrelevant except insofar as the Storyteller wishes\notherwise. The Bane Mummies are beings of immense power, and their passing\nshould not be wholly without incident. Whether they are slain after fierce,\nearthshaking battle or cut down pathetically where they hide, they all die.\nAll except one, that is.\nTwo of the Apepnu yet remain when emissaries of Saatet-ta, the self-appointed\n“Darkener of the Earth,” approaches the Amenti with an offer. She will cooperate\ntoward the singular goal of eliminating Eurydice. In exchange, she wants protection.\nIt is clear that Saatet-ta does not seek defection. Her motives are no more pure, and\ncorruption still festers in her soul. Yet, she does not want to die, and her selfishness\nmakes her an unlikely ally. Before the leaders of the Amenti choose a reply,\nEurydice’s assassins strike again and Saatet-ta becomes the last of her kind. The\nchosen of Osiris no longer have a choice. Eurydice must not gain the last ifrit. She\nmust not complete her dread ritual. Horus himself issues the response to Saatet-ta\nand the distasteful order to the Shemsu-heru: Preserve the “Ebon Horror of Khutu”\nabove all else. The Amenti accept her deal.\nSaatet-ta arrives garbed in regal illusion, accompanied by a full bodyguard of\nreapers. The characters stand by as Horus receives her and gives his word on behalf\nof the Amenti as she demanded. The palpable distaste between the two does not end\nin violence, but only just. Horus leaves and entrusts Saatet-ta to the characters. As\nthey establish a hidden “safe house” in a remote location, the last of the Apepnu\nenjoys taunting her reluctant guardians. She assures them they will be granted swift\nand painless passage to oblivion when this little truce ends — as a reward, of course.\nTorment shall fall upon Horus, she bitterly claims. The characters may realize the\ndesperation in her taunts. She fears for her life and deeply resents the need for help.\nUltimately, she’s all talk.

A trio of stalkers\nmaterializes in Saatet-ta’s bedchambers, while the remaining three systematically\nand quietly eliminate all of the reapers and any mortal guards. The characters quickly\nturn the tide of battle, as the stalkers had not planned or prepared for Amenti\ninterference. Their momentary surprise gives Saatet-ta a chance to snare one in\nbindings of black lightning. A few more turns of combat follow, but the surviving\nstalkers retreat in a spray of sand. The captive stalker writhes and strains at its bonds,\nfutilely trying to dissipate through the ward. It soon runs out of Willpower and can\nonly snarl impotently.\nSaatet-ta boasts and brags, jeering at the caged beast — but she keeps a\nconspicuously healthy distance. It barks something incomprehensible at her, clearly\nan insult by the sudden pallor that spreads across her face. She turns her angry gaze\nfrom the beast and boasts that she can follow the stalker to its source and catch\nEurydice by surprise. She tries to bully the characters into accompanying her, but she\nresorts to cajoling and ultimately playing on their moral obligation if they refuse.\nWhenever and however they accept (and possibly even if they do not), she seizes an\namulet from beneath her clothes and throws it to the floor. It flashes a putrid green,\nand painfully tears the characters across space toward Eurydice’s lair.\nARMAGEDDON\nWhen the light and roaring winds fade, the dwar finds itself on the outskirts of\na small town. Characters with appropriate knowledge might recognize this place as\nMegiddo in Palestine, though if none are present to identify their surroundings,\nSaatet-ta makes note of it with surprise and scorn. Few people remain in the town,\nand many buildings have crumbled to ruin. If the characters theorize that this is the\nwork of Eurydice and her Amkhat, Saatet-ta corrects them, saying, “This is what\nmen do to their own kind. They bring ruin and pain upon themselves even in our\n— or her — absence. And it appears we have company.”\nAs Saatet-ta finishes her observation, armed Israeli soldiers emerge from a\nsearch of nearby rubble and notice the dwar. They approach with weapons drawn\nand demand that the characters present identification papers. They might even\nattack outright if the characters show visible weapons. The characters have less than\na minute to talk their way past the soldiers before Saatet-ta casts a lethal necromantic\nspell that burns the lot to stinking ash. The Bane Mummy does not apologize for her\naction but insistently leads the characters on into the rubble and mumbles, “We\ndon’t have time for this!”\nFollowing Saatet-ta, the dwar eventually locates and enters a damaged\nbuilding whose cracked foundation opens upon a descending staircase of ancient\ndesign. They can smell smoke wafting from below. At the bottom of the\nstaircase, the characters find a corridor opening into a wide stone platform. A\nvaulted cathedral ceiling looms far above, but the musty air and lingering scent\nof death betrays the place as a crypt of some kind. The interlopers’ attention\nimmediately draws to Eurydice herself, resplendent and hypnotically beautiful as\nshe stands unabashedly naked in the center of the platform. Around her crouch\nsix stalkers fawning and whimpering like dogs, while 49 robed Amkhat priests\nstand in a circle at the edge of the platform. The chamber’s illumination springs\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n249\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER E\n E\n E\n E\n EIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nfrom torch sconces chiseled into the walls. Heavy incense burns with overripe\nsweetness in gathering clouds of smoke far above.\nEurydice turns immediately, casting brief, dismissive appraisal over Saatet-ta\nand the Amenti. She exchanges brief taunts with Saatet-ta then unleashes her\nstalkers with a casual wave. The pack comes snarling at the characters while Saatet-\nta unleashes an angry torrent of destructive magic at Eurydice. The Chosen of\nApophis casually swats the spell aside and begins draining Saatet-ta of her Corrup-\ntion. Try as they might, the characters cannot intervene due to the attacking\nmonsters (and even if the stalkers weren’t an issue, the dwar has no viable means of\npreventing Eurydice’s action at this time). When Eurydice finishes absorbing the\npower of Saatet-ta, she smiles horrifically and falls limp to the ground. The Amkhat\nbegin chanting a broken version of the Spell of Life that Saatet-ta recognizes in utter\nhorror before she, too, collapses at the edge of death.\nThe characters must finish off the stalkers so that they can attack the cultists\nand break their spell. From the first turn of chant, a shape begins taking form in the\nperfumed smoke. It begins as shapeless coils and then grows more distinct into a\nserpent of unthinkable proportions. Only a fraction of its sinuous bulk remains\nvisible in the eddying smoke at any given time, but the sight fills the characters with\ndread. The Storyteller should set a time limit in which to stop the ritual before it\nconcludes and the Great Serpent pours in a vortex to fill Eurydice with blasphemous\nlife. Suggested means of stopping the ritual include:\n• Kill the cultists. This is the simplest and most brutal method. If over a third\nof the cultists perish, the magic fails. Note that simply attempting to stop them from\nchanting will not be sufficient at this point. Their very bodies swarm with the unholy\npower of Apophis, and those conduits must be closed permanently for the magic to\nfail. This means that no fewer than 17 cultists must die if the Amenti are to prevail.\nThe good news is that the cultists are nothing special, physically. They have no\nmagic to protect themselves, so use the statistics for ordinary mortals.\n• Only sacrifice may break the ritual. At least one of the Amenti must leap\nupon Eurydice and take the searing evil of Apophis into himself. The Balance\nresiding in the Amenti’s core will prevent Apophis from taking form, but the\nawesome power will annihilate the character(s) utterly.\nNEITHER EAST NOR WEST\nFans of the Wu T’ian and the Teomallki, other races of the\nUndying found in the tabletop Mummy Players Guide, will\ndoubtless take note that the Armageddon scenarios involving\nthose immortals that are found in Time of Judgment — “The\nDawn of the Sixth Age” and “The World Goes Westward” — are\nnot included in this book. Quite simply, they have been omitted\nbecause Laws of the Resurrection deals only with the Amenti, so\ntheir scenarios must take precedence in this already tightly packed\nvolume. Storytellers are free to convert those character types and\nthe scenarios surrounding them for Mind’s Eye Theatre play as\nthey desire, of course, using the guidelines found in the Mummy\nPlayers Guide and Resurrection.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n250\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\n• Kill Eurydice. Considering her astounding resilience, characters may be\nhard-pressed to injure the Chosen of Apophis, let alone slay her. Of course, any\ncharacter that jumps on the revenant to stick a blade in her chest may have just\nvolunteered for heroic martyrdom…\nIf the characters do not stop the ascension, Eurydice draws deafening breath\nas a living embodiment of Apophis. Her first action will likely be to annihilate\nthe characters on the spot, though perhaps she appreciates the ironic sport of\nsaving them for last so they can watch her end the world. In such a scenario, the\ncharacters might yet find some heroic and increasingly improbable means of\nstopping Eurydice, but it’s considerably more likely that the real story ends in\ntragedy and horror.\nIf the characters stop the ascension, the coils of the Great Serpent unwind and\ntwist in tangles of smoke, then fade away. The cultists shriek in horror, retreating\nto the handful of entry tunnels at the edge of the room. Eurydice remains alone,\ndenied her last chance at true life. Even without ascension, her power is vast. It will\ntake everything the characters have to stop her, but with her destruction, victory\nbelongs to Ma’at.\nLONG DAY’S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT\nAs certain as Ra’s boat descends into the Underworld at the end of each day,\nso is the ending of all things, even to those who might believe they are eternal. Just\nas the setting of the sun does not mean the end of everything, only the dying of the\nlight, so the End Times do not necessarily mean the end of the world, but perhaps\nonly the end of the Undying. This scenario is perhaps the most subtle ending for a\nResurrection chronicle, at least insofar as the mundane world is concerned. For the\nUndying, it is just as much of an end as the setting sun.\nINTRODUCTION\nIn “Long Day’s Journey into Night”, Eurydice uses a different plan to achieve\nthe eternal life that she so desperately desires. Using an ancient spell fueled by her\nneed and the rage of the Ghost Storm, Eurydice tears down the Shroud between\nworlds, merging the Lands of the Living with those of the dead. Not only does this\nact allow restless ghosts to return to their lost flesh, it releases many others whose\nbodies are long since dust, seeking mortal hosts to inhabit. In a perverse imitation\nof the Amenti joining, these shades seize mortal hosts, and not necessarily in\ncooperation with their current inhabitants.\nEurydice’s actions gravely upset the balance of the world, threatening a future\nwhere the dead increasingly outnumber the living, or a world of unliving immortals\nwhere nothing ever changes because death has been rendered impotent. There is a\nmeans of stopping the deterioration of the Shroud and restoring the balance, but it\nis difficult and has a high price, assuming the characters are willing to pay it.\nDARK OMENS\nStorytellers can involve a dwar of characters in the events of “Long Day’s\nJourney into Night” in various ways, depending on the needs and style of the\nchronicle. Essentially, there should be various hints and omens that indicate to the\ncharacters something unusual is happening. The material in Signs in the Dust\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n251\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER E\n E\n E\n E\n EIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nprovides some examples, while some others are given here. They can be incorporated\nin other stories leading up to the events of this story.\nDISTURBING DREAMS\nThe sleep of the Undying is troubled by disturbing images. Characters may\ndream about walking through Neter-khertet, seeing the Ghost Storm rage and\nwitnessing the Shroud between the Lands of the Living and those of the dead grow\ntattered and torn. The fierce winds of the Dja-akh tear at the fabric of the Shroud\nas hungry ghosts seek to reach the living world. Characters may even make out a\nglowing, ghostly shape at the heart of the storm, a woman who seems to be directing\nthe force of the storm, with legions of ghosts at her back. The Shroud sunders and\nthe character wakes up.\nSHADOWS OF THINGS TO COME\nMummies in the Shadowlands begin to notice signs of what is to come. The Dja-\nakh blows in fierce gusts, and there are more and more restless ghosts blown upon its\nwinds, taking shelter in islands of safety and calm in Neter-khertet and throughout\nthe Web of Faith. These ghosts seem to be gathering — called by some unseen source,\nfor reasons not even they can name. Sightings of ghostly phenomena are also\nbecoming more common. It seems that the Veil is thinning, allowing mortals to\nnotice the presence of spirits more in the Web of Faith. The stories are mere\ncuriosities at first, but as they become more common, they grow harder to dismiss.\nSIGNS\nThe Amenti see signs of imminent disaster more and more often. It is written\nin the stars for those with knowledge of the celestial arts. A strange red star appears\nover much of the Nile, casting a shadow wherein people see ghosts and spirits lurking\naround them. Urban graffiti looks like ancient Egyptian symbols. Images of jackals\nand other death trappings seem prominent.\nTHE JUDGMENT OF MA’AT\nFinally, Amenti traveling to Duat and meeting the Judges of Ma’at hear the\nwords of impending doom from their own lips, or from others in the depths of the\nUnderworld. Mummies who go to face the Judges of Ma’at for their advancement in\nBalance may hear them whisper prophecies of a great trial they will soon face, of the\nrestless dead walking among the living and the Shroud between worlds being torn\nasunder.\nPerhaps even more disconcerting to the Amenti is how the ever-silent Anubis,\nthe guide and guardian of the dead, seems saddened and regards them with a mixture\nof pity and sympathy upon meeting them in the depths of Duat. Mummies may hear\nvoices whispering in the winds of the Ghost Storm, perhaps saying the name\n“Eurydice” or repeating “soon, soon…” over and over again. Who do they speak of,\nand what are they waiting for?\nTHE TATTERED SHROUD\nEvents are set in motion when the wraith Eurydice uses a combination of her\nburning desire for life, ancient secrets wrested from the depths of the Underworld,\nand the blessings of Apophis to rend the fabric of the Shroud with the power of the\nDja-akh. This unleashes the forces of the Lands of the Dead on the Lands of the\nLiving, with disastrous consequences.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n252\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nTHE FIRST SIGNS\nAs Eurydice works her will upon the Shadowlands, the fierceness of the Ghost\nStorm increases in intensity and the Shroud begins to weaken. Throughout the\nLands of Faith, the Shroud rating drops by one at sunset. Amenti using their abilities\nmay notice that the Shroud offers them less resistance than normal. More impor-\ntantly, mortals in the Lands of Faith begin to sense the Lands of the Dead more\nclearly. There are reports of spiritual visitations, visions, strange dreams and so forth.\nThe Shroud has not weakened sufficiently for the two lands to touch, but in places\nwhere the Shroud rating drops as low as 1, cases of possession or more active\nhaunting, visions of a great and terrible storm or poltergeist phenomena are\ncommon.\nThe characters may look into the unusual things happening in the Lands of\nFaith, but they can find no reason for the increasing strength of the Dja-akh or the\nweakening of the Shroud. The strange happenings in places where the Shroud has\ngrown especially thin add to the other ill omens facing the Undying.\nTHE SHROUD FALLS\nThe following sunset, the Shroud rating drops by another point in the Lands\nof Faith and the Shroud rating worldwide also drops by one. In a few places (those\nwith an initial Shroud Rating of 2), the Shroud collapses altogether, leaving a\n“hole” between the Lands of the Living and Neter-khertet. The Shadowlands\nfall across the living world like a pall, and the two become as one. This has a\nnumber of dire effects:\n• The Veil: The Veil is still in effect in places where the Shroud has fallen,\nrevealing the true existence of the Shadowlands and the dead to mortals. Therefore,\nmany mortals (with less than three Willpower Traits) are utterly terror-stricken by\nthe appearance of the Shadowlands, causing panicked mobs and bouts of madness\nas humanity tries to block out the terrible truth. This leads to complete mayhem in\nplaces with a Shroud rating of 0, spreading outward as the Shroud grows weaker.\nThese conflicts, in turn, provide ample opportunities for the restless dead to possess\nliving bodies. As supernatural creatures themselves, mummies are unaffected by the\nVeil, but the madness and chaos surrounding the manifestation of the Shadowlands\nis certain to make their efforts more difficult.\n• The Restless Dead: In places where the Shroud has fallen, the ghosts and\nspirits of the dead that dwell in Neter-khertet are free to interact with the Lands of\nthe Living once more. Ghosts are still immaterial, but they can use their powers\nfreely without regard for the Shroud, and ordinary mortals can see them clearly,\nprovoking the effects of the Veil. Additionally, ghosts can attempt to possess living\nbodies or return to their own flesh to become risen.\nIf a ghost attempts to possess a living host body, make a Willpower\nChallenge for the ghost with a difficulty equal to the mortal’s Willpower. If the\nghost wins, it is in control of the body and the mortal loses a temporary\nWillpower Trait. If the mortal wins, the ghost cannot attempt to possess that\nperson for a day, and he loses a temporary Willpower Trait. Each day the ghost\npossesses a body, make a new Willpower test. If the ghost wins, the mortal loses\nanother temporary Willpower Trait. If the mortal wins, the ghost is ousted from\nthe host body. If a mortal host reaches zero Willpower Traits, the ghost takes\ncontrol of the body permanently.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n253\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER E\n E\n E\n E\n EIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nGhosts cannot attempt to possess Amenti, because of their unusual spiritual\nnature and fortitude, nor can they possess a mortal form that is already inhabited by\nanother ghost.\nAlternatively, ghosts can automatically re-inhabit and reanimate their\nformer bodies. The ghost gains physical abilities similar to a vampire (including\nthe ability to soak lethal damage with Stamina), but the ghost’s body is still a\ncorpse. The ghost is not really alive. The physical condition of the corpse affects\nthe ghost’s appearance and physical abilities. The recently dead are more\ncapable and lifelike than those whose bodies have been decomposing for days,\nweeks or even months.\n• Sekhem: Of greatest concern to the Amenti is the effect that the fallen\nShroud has on the presence of Sekhem in the Lands of the Living. On one hand, the\nAmenti lose the Gift of Ra in any place where the Shroud has been reduced to 0.\nThey do not automatically regain a Trait of Sekhem at sunrise each day. On the other\nhand, Osiris’ Blessing is enhanced. In places where the Shadowlands have emerged\nwithin the Web of Faith, mummies automatically regain their Balance score in\nSekhem every 24 hours. Outside the Web of Faith, the difficulties for regaining\nSekhem decrease by two Traits.\nThis means that Amenti in the areas where the Shroud has fallen feel\nempowered by the closeness of Osiris’ presence. They also feel a terrible sense of\nurgency. The weakening of the Shroud must be stopped, or life and death will be\nmixed beyond all undoing and life will cease to have any real meaning.\nThe Shroud loses a point of its rating each day at sunset, meaning that most\nplaces in the Web of Faith are completely exposed to the Shadowlands in less than\na week. The entire world will be engulfed by the Lands of the Dead in a little more\nthan a week’s time. At that point, it might be too late for the Undying to do anything\nexcept try and deal with the damage. Fortunately, the Reborn have an opportunity\nto address the problem before that happens.\nTHE NILE QUEEN\nThe ancient Shemsu-heru mummy Hatshepsut is aware of what is happening\nand why, and she has a means of doing something about it — with the aid of the dwar.\nHatshepsut gets in contact with the characters, either through conventional means\nsuch as telephone or telegram (if the characters are accessible in that way) or through\nmystical means like Hekau, such as a Nomenclature ritual to contact the characters\nby their names or a Necromancy ritual that allows Hatshepsut’s ka to visit the dwar\nin spirit form and summon them to her. Regardless of the means, Hatshepsut invokes\nher authority as one of the Shemsu-heru and an elder of the Undying, bidding the\ndwar to attend her in Cairo. She’s reluctant to discuss matters over great distance,\npreferring to do so in person when the dwar arrives.\nREACHING CAIRO\nThe difficulty of the dwar’s journey to Cairo to meet Hatshepsut is entirely up\nto the Storyteller, depending on the chronicle. If the dwar happens to be in Cairo,\nthen it may be as simple as a messenger delivering Hatshepsut’s summons and the\ncharacters going to meet her at her home. On the other hand, if the characters are\nin another country when the elder mummy’s message reaches them, then their trip\nto meet with her may be considerably more involved.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n254\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nTake two factors into account for the dwar’s trip to Cairo. The first is the chaos\ncaused by the thinning of the Shroud, which has already begun by the time\nHatshepsut contacts the dwar. Depending on how far along things are, Cairo is likely\nin chaos, with the authorities doing their best to keep order. There are ghostly and\nspiritual visitations, as well as numerous cases of possession and encounters with the\nwalking dead as wraiths extend their reach into the Lands of the Living and mortals\nbecome increasingly aware of Neter-khertet. Travel in and out of Cairo (or Egypt,\nor the Middle East, for that matter) might become restricted, forcing the dwar to find\ndifferent routes. Of course, the longer the trip takes, the worse the situation becomes\nand the more urgent the dwar’s mission.\nThe second factor is Eurydice, herself. She is supernaturally aware of Hatshepsut’s\ndivinations into her plans and intends to do something about them. She dispatches\none or more of her stalkers, either to intercept the dwar and keep it from reaching\nHatshepsut or to attack both the characters and the Shemsu-heru at Hatshepsut’s\nhome in Cairo and prevent them from interfering in her plans.\nOther challenges may await the dwar along the journey to Cairo, from fierce\nsandstorms to fear-maddened terrorists or military patrols to sheer amounts of\nbureaucratic red tape. The actual trip can be a significant segment of the story or a\nsimple scene change as the characters go from wherever they are to Hatshepsut’s\nhome in Cairo.\nMEETING WITH THE PAST\nThrough one means or another, the dwar arrives in Cairo and makes its way to\nHatshepsut’s small but opulent home. The house is well protected from the chaos in\nthe city and surrounding area by various wards and amulets, allowing the dwar to\nmeet with the elder Shemsu-heru in relative peace, although it’s clear that matters\nare becoming more urgent. Attending her at all times are members of the Disciples\nof Anubis, her undead caretakers, who welcome the dwar graciously.\nHatshepsut dispenses with any formalities, welcoming the characters and\ntelling them what has happened. A powerful wraith initially chosen to be reborn as\nAmenti has been corrupted by Apophis, chosen as the Corrupter’s champion and\navatar. Using mystic secrets wrested from the depths of the Underworld, this wraith,\nEurydice, is tearing down the Shroud between the Lands of the Living and Neter-\nkhertet. This act is causing the Shadowlands to merge with the mundane world,\nloosing a flood of ghosts and restless spirits and exposing mortals to the Lands of the\nDead before their time. The effects of the Veil are causing chaos in the mortal world,\nand it will only get worse as time passes. In a matter of days, Eurydice will tear down\nthe Shroud altogether, the Lands of the Living and the Lands of the Dead will\nbecome as one, and Apophis will triumph.\nThere is hope, however. Hatshepsut and the other Shemsu-heru are aware of\na secret ritual, inscribed upon the wall of the Temple of Osiris in the lost city of\nAmenti in the depths of the Underworld. This powerful rite was always intended as\na last-ditch means of preventing Apophis’ victory and safeguarding the world, and\nit requires the power of the Reborn — those who have lived three lives — to use it.\n(Some might conclude that this is one of the reasons Osiris created the Amenti in\nthe first place. If someone points this out, Hatshepsut does not deny it.)\nTo use the ritual, the characters must prematurely abandon their khat to travel\ninto Duat and reach Amenti in time. In order to make the journey, they must die.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n255\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER E\n E\n E\n E\n EIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nEMBRACING DEATH\nAssuming the characters accept the mission Hatshepsut lays before them, they\nfirst need to die in order to make the transition into Neter-khertet and travel\nwestward to Duat and places beyond.\nThe death rite can also be as simple or complex as the Storyteller desires.\nHatshepsut has considerable knowledge of various poisons that can quickly and\npainlessly send the dwar’s bodies into the sleep of death, allowing their spirits to\ntravel into the afterlife. Hatshepsut can insist on a more involved ritual, if necessary.\nPerhaps the characters must first be wrapped up in treated bandages and placed in\nancient sarcophagi before they travel into Neter-khertet.\nAlternatively, Eurydice might inadvertently help the characters along their\njourney. The corrupt wraith’s stalkers might attack Hatshepsut’s home as the\nAmenti prepare to depart for the Lands of the Dead. The monstrous creatures slay\nthe mummies, including Hatshepsut, although she makes them pay dearly for her\nlife, using powerful Hekau to defend herself and the characters. The key difference\nis that one of the stalkers captures Hatshepsut’s soul. In fact, she might willingly\nsacrifice herself to allow the characters the opportunity to liberate their spirits and\ngo into the Shadowlands. This leaves the dwar on its own, with the characters aware\nof just how high the stakes are, if a millennia-old immortal is willing to sacrifice\nherself to give them their chance.\nJOURNEY TO THE WEST\nOnce the characters have entered Neter-khertet, they must travel to the Pillars\nof the West, the entrance to Duat, the Underworld. They travel through the\nShadowlands of Cairo, dealing with wandering ghosts and even noticing that some\nmortals are aware of them as they pass. (How many depends on how thin the Shroud\nhas become in the area.) It should be an unsettling experience for the Amenti,\nthough the spirits they encounter shouldn’t pose too much of a challenge for them.\nThe mummies make their way out past the pyramids and into the western\ndesert, which eventually leads deeper into Neter-khertet, away from the Lands of the\nLiving and toward the Underworld. In time, the characters see the Pillars of the West\nin the distance as they approach their destination.\nTHE PILLARS OF THE WEST\nThe Pillars of the West mark the border between Neter-khertet and Duat. The\ndwar must make its way through the caverns and tunnels between the Pillars to reach\nthe Underworld.\nNormally, the Judges of Ma’at pose various tests of a traveler’s worthiness. In\nthis case, however, the power of Apophis has grown great enough that the Corrupter\nuses the tests of the Pillars as obstacles in the Amenti’s path. The tests that the\ncharacters face should be manifestations of their deepest fears and desires, brought\nto terrifying life.\nStorytellers should tailor the different experiences and challenges to the\nindividual characters in the chronicle. The common themes should be what the\ncharacters have to lose and what they most fear. Apophis wants to encourage the\nAmenti to cling to life above all else, much like Eurydice, who values her own life\nabove that of every other living creature and is willing to sacrifice the whole world\nto Apophis in order to spare herself from death.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n256\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nPotential experiences include flashbacks from the characters’ previous\nlives, particularly stressing how they have changed for the better (or foibles they\nhave not yet overcome). Friends and loved ones might plead with the Undying\nnot to leave them, and Apophis might offer tempting tastes of the many\npleasures life has to offer, coupled with the terrifying mystery of what lies beyond\nthe dark of Duat.\nANUBIS SPEAKS\nOnce the dwar makes its way through the Pillars of the West, it arrives in the\nvast desert of Duat, wracked by the terrible Dja-akh. The storm’s fury is greater than\nanything the characters have seen before, howling and shrieking, the winds filled\nwith moaning spirits. The power of the storm seems to be building, encouraged by\nEurydice and the power of Apophis until it is strong enough to tear apart the Shroud\nbetween the worlds. The characters should find themselves buffeted by the howling\nwinds and blowing sand, even in the relative shelter of the caverns.\nThen they see a faint light in the distance, through the blowing sand and clouds,\nand a dark figure appears. Anubis, the guide of the dead, strides through the storm,\ncarrying a glowing lantern suspended from the end of a long pole. The jackal-headed\ngod nods gravely to the characters, then speaks to them in a low voice that somehow\ncarries clearly over the howl of the storm around them.\n“Has the time come?” Anubis asks them.\nIf the characters answer in the affirmative, or otherwise tell Anubis why they\nhave traveled to Duat, he nods and asks. “Are you prepared?”\nIf the characters say yes, then the guide of the dead turns and leads them out into\nthe Dja-akh. If the characters answer in the negative to either question, or ask\nAnubis for clarification, the jackal-god silently turns and leads them out into the\nstorm, but does not speak to them again. He leads them to Amenti, but it is up to\nthem to decide to stop there, following Hatshepsut’s instructions, and to find the\nTemple of Osiris.\nAs long as the characters remain within the glow of Anubis’ lantern, they are\nprotected from the effects of the Ghost Storm and the wraiths and spectres within\nit. If you wish, you can subject the characters to another challenge by having one or\nmore spirits break through Anubis’ protection to attack the dwar. The jackal-god is\noccupied strengthening his sphere of influence and keeping out the fury of the storm,\nleaving the characters to deal with the rogue spirits on their own.\nTHE RITE OF THE SLAIN KING\nFinally, Anubis leads the Amenti to their namesake, the ruined city buried in\nthe dark sands of Duat, buffeted by the winds of the Dja-akh. If the characters told\nAnubis their mission, he leads them through the broken and buried streets of the city\nto its single intact structure. If not, he leads them past Amenti, and it’s up to the\ncharacters to choose to strike out on their own for the city and find the temple. If they\ncontinue on with Anubis, they encounter the Judges of Ma’at, who send them back\nto complete their mission before it’s too late.\nThe Temple of Osiris is a massive sandstone building supported by giant\ncolumns. Inside it is dark and eerily silent, unaffected by the storm raging\noutside. The centerpiece is a giant throne, now empty, and the walls are\ninscribed with Egyptian hieroglyphics. One wall behind the throne holds the rite\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n257\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER E\n E\n E\n E\n EIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nthe dwar seeks, and any character able to translate the symbols can read it. If\nnone of the characters are fluent in Ancient Egyptian, they can use the Memory\nBackground to recall enough to read it. If neither is an option, feel free to offer\nthe characters a moment of divine inspiration, the total memories of their First\nLives flooding back to them.\nTHE RITUAL\nThe Rite of the Slain King is easily the most powerful Hekau ritual the characters\nhave seen. In essence, the rite weaves a new and impenetrable Shroud, but it requires\nunique and perfected souls of beings like the Amenti as its raw material. The rite will\ntransform the souls of the Undying into a Shroud that will separate the two worlds\npermanently, but the Amenti will be no more. They will not die, precisely, but their\nessence will be forever bound into the Shroud. For the world to live, the immortals\nmust die.\nThe rite is designed so that only the Undying themselves can use it, but the\ncharacters must still decide to sacrifice not only themselves, but all of their kind in\norder for the ritual to work. Note that the rite does not require the permission of the\nother Amenti. Even one mummy can attempt it, and all the other Undying are\naffected by it, whether they wish to be or not.\nThe Rite of the Slain King is an extended ritual against a difficulty of 10\nTraits, using a Mental Challenge (retest Occult). A total of 10 successful tests are\nrequired, with one test per five minutes of play. Failure on any one of these tests\nrequires an additional Simple Test. If this test results in a loss, the rite is\nconsidered botched and all accumulated successful tests are lost, though it can\nbe restarted. There is no Sekhem cost, since the rite is empowered by the souls\nof the Reborn themselves. The dwar can cooperate in performing the rite or just\nsome of the characters can perform it, perhaps leaving the others to defend them,\nsince they will not complete the rite unopposed.\nDON’T LOOK BACK\nAfter the characters begin the ritual and have made their first successful test,\nEurydice enters the temple in her full and terrible glory as the Avatar of Apophis.\nShe glows with power, hovering in the midst of a swirling storm of black clouds,\nlightning flashing from her eyes and crackling over her skin. Her voice is like thunder\nthat shakes the pillars of the temple as she commands the Amenti to stop what they\nare doing. For this last confrontation with Eurydice, Storytellers have a couple of\noptions, depending on the sort of climatic scene they desire.\nFirst, one or more ghosts or stalkers may accompany Eurydice. She commands\nthem to attack the mummies, allowing a final battle where some of the characters\nfight to hold off Eurydice and her minions long enough for the others to complete\nthe rite. Regardless of their power and number, Eurydice should be powerful enough\nto pose a serious challenge to the dwar.\nAlternatively, the power of the rite might prevent Eurydice from directly\nattacking the dwar once it has begun. All she can hope to do is convince the\ncharacters to stop what they are doing of their own free will before the ritual is\ncomplete. She uses threats, logic, persuasion, seduction and any other means\navailable to her to convince the Amenti. She will promise them dominion over their\nown kingdoms, wealth and power, harems of lovers, virtually anything in order to\nsway them. She might also threaten to destroy people and places important to the\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n258\nLAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS\nAWS OF\nOF\nOF\nOF\nOF J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\ncharacters, and she has the means to do so, forcing the characters to decide what they\nare willing to sacrifice in order to succeed. As long as the dwar remains steadfast, the\nCorrupter’s avatar is powerless to stop them.\nCLOSING THE SHROUD\nWhen the Rite of the Slain King is complete, the souls of all Reborn, everywhere\nin the world, are drawn from their khat and merged into a newer and more powerful\nShroud that rises up between the world of the living and the Lands of the Dead.\nEurydice screams in terror and rage as the Shroud separates the two worlds forever,\ndrawing all the spirits of the dead back into the Shadowlands and preventing any of\nthem from ever returning. The dead will remain dead, and never reach the Lands of\nthe Living again.\nOf course, the Amenti are only dimly aware of this as their consciousness\nmerges in a single transcendent moment. They are aware of the presence of\nOsiris himself, a part of the foundation of the ritual, sacrificed once more for the\ncause of his people; of the eldest Shemsu-heru (including Horus); even of Ma’at,\nherself, lending her power to this most noble and balanced of acts. For a shining\nmoment, the Amenti are aware of the perfect balance and rightness of all things,\nand then they are no more.\nMAJOR CHARACTERS\nThe following characters are pivotal to the events in “Long Day’s Journey into\nNight.” Feel free to modify these supporting characters to suit the events of the\nchronicle, or even substitute other characters in their places if suitable replacements\nhave emerged in the course of your chronicle.\nEURYDICE\nIn this scenario, the corrupt wraith is the Avatar of Apophis, but rather than\na risen embodiment of death and corruption, Eurydice is still a wraith, with a terrible\nhunger for life. She is empowered by Apophis and her own khaibit to tear down the\nShroud between the worlds, to merge the Lands of the Living and the Lands of the\nDead into one. Only then will she attain the resurrection that she seeks, and she will\nreign over the two worlds in the name of the Corrupter.\nEurydice is every bit as powerful as the players have feared, except that she is\nnot embodied in this scenario and exists as a wraith in Duat, albeit one with the\npower of Apophis at her command. Eurydice is completely and utterly mad. She\ncares nothing for anyone or anything, and she will gladly sacrifice the whole world\nto Apophis if that is what it takes to regain her grip on life.\nHATSHEPSUT\nHatshepsut understands well the meaning of sacrifice. She is one of the\nShemsu-heru, the original mummies created by the Spell of Life, an ally of Horus\nhimself. More importantly, the Nile Queen served as one of the greatest\nchampions against the machinations of Apophis, although few actually know it.\nHatshepsut was the subject of a mighty enchantment known as the Rite of the Sun\nKing, which made her a barrier in the Shadowlands against Apophis’ full power\nmanifesting in the Lands of the Living. The barrier was designed to keep the\nCorrupter at bay so that he was forced to operate through his various agents.\nHatshepsut was aided and supported by the Disciples of Anubis, a secret society\nprivy to the rite and her duties.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n259\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER E\n E\n E\n E\n EIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nIGHT\nHatshepsut and the rite helped safeguard the world until the coming of the Dja-\nakh.

Now the Destroyer\nhas found an avatar and the end is near. Hatshepsut is entrusted with the knowledge\nthat may yet turn the tide, but with a high price. She understands sacrifice and what\nshe must now ask of the dwar.\nHatshepsut’s role in this scenario is that of a guide and ally of the Amenti,\nso her traits are largely irrelevant. She is an elder and powerful Shemsu-heru. She\nhas extensive knowledge of ancient lore and powerful Hekau, but she is still\nlimited when it comes to dealing with the modern world.

It begins with an examination summary\nof “The Last Dance Macabre,” the final story of the Dark Kingdom of Iron, as well\nas some Storytelling advice for how to make that scenario accessible to their own\nOblivion chronicles.\nIt also contains information about the nature of Great Maelstroms, the impact\nof the Reckoning and possibilities for Storytellers interested in continuing beyond\nthe end scenario outlined here.\nTHE POWERS BEHIND THE SCENES\nThe events of this chapter truly began with plots set in motion centuries ago. This\nsection reviews the plans laid by some of the Dark Kingdom’s most powerful individuals\nand groups, as well as the complications that fouled up their various agendas.\nThe Mnemoi\nThe Mnemoi were long ago entrusted with the most precious burden in all of\nStygia: Charon’s complete memories. The Guild was to hold those memories in\nsafekeeping against the day Charon would leave the Underworld, be reborn and\neventually return. To cement the illusion, Charon had the Mnemoi “banished” —\nas much to prevent his memories from being taken advantage of by Stygian society\nas to keep them safe in the hinterlands of the Underworld.\nOver the centuries, the Mnemoi were hunted down before they could pass on\ntheir precious burdens, or they succumbed to the pressures of persecution and went\nSpectre. The current leaders of the Guild know that they have not fulfilled their\nmission. They only hope they’ve been able to save enough of Charon so that he might\nin turn be able to save them. As a result, the Mnemoi act with desperate purpose. They\nare among the very few extant wraiths who know what precisely is at stake.\nCHAPTER NINE: DOOMSDAY\nCHAPTER NINE: DOOMSDAY\nCHAPTER NINE: DOOMSDAY\nCHAPTER NINE: DOOMSDAY\nCHAPTER NINE: DOOMSDAY\n261\nCHAPTER NINE\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n262\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nThe Lady of Fate\nThe Lady of Fate, the first wraith, is the only one to know the full outline of the\nevents unfolding in this tale. She cannot prevent the tragedy, so she focuses on\nseeing how much can be rescued from the ruins. She appears only at the end of the\nstory, to answer lingering questions and pass on what hope she can for the future.\nGoing through the story itself, the characters should not know that someone with\nher power watches and hopes for them. The Lady of Fate provides succor and\nemergency assistance if the characters have truly fought their hardest yet still find\nthemselves faced with failure, but she does not do other wraiths’ work for them.\nYu Huang and the Smiling Lord\nThe Emperor of the Yellow Springs spent decades preparing for the invasion he\nlaunches now. His advisors recognized an opportunity in the era of the Great War and\ninsinuated highly trained agents among the prisoners harvested by Stygian Reapers\nworking in eastern Russia. They’ve sent in more from time to time ever since. Yu Huang\nalso enjoys the advantage of covert assistance from the Smiling Lord. Each believes he\ncan use the other. Yu Huang expects to let the Smiling Lord weaken Stygian defenses\nenough that Jade troops can sweep away all resistance, then remove the Smiling Lord\nhimself at his leisure. The Smiling Lord believes that he can use Jade forces to crush all\ncompetition and then drive back the invaders through superior strategy and firepower\n(to wit, the relic nuclear devices he’s been harvesting for decades).\nTHE LAST DANCE MACABRE\nCharon’s empire is under assault from all directions, beset by foes without and\ntraitors within. In desperation, the most powerful defenders of the empire set in\nmotion plans laid down in prophecy and developed centuries ago, to recover the soul\nGETTING EVERYONE ONBOARD\nAt first it might seem daunting to try to figure out ways to get the troupe’s\ncharacters to go through with some of the tasks this scenario requires of them together,\nbut it isn’t necessarily as difficult as it appears. Few relationships in the Underworld\nare as tidy as “firm friends or allies with no complicating factors” or “implacable\nenemies.” Whatever official declarations say, wraiths of varying allegiances must learn\nto cooperate with the wraiths they come into regular contact with. Hierarch, Heretic\nand Renegade might all share a favored leisure spot, have Fetters attached to the same\ngeneral location or have a mutual interest in some constructive task. Wraiths on\nopposite sides of a political fence might share an enemy or a Passion.\nWhat’s more, given the overwhelming importance of the tasks they are\npresented with during this scenario, getting the characters to work together through-\nout the story shouldn’t be as difficult as some other scenarios. Even the most selfish or\nstandoffish character can’t help but see the value of staving off the forces of Oblivion,\nif only to claim some reward or save his own hide. Still, when mixing characters of\ndiverse allegiances, be sure to provide points of contact that are strong enough to keep\nthe characters together in the depths of the crisis. Characters need not be profound\nconfidants, but neither should they carry serious hostility toward each other, especially\nnear the end. There are enough wraiths out there who want to tear the various Circles\nasunder already without giving them more help from the inside.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n263\nCHAPTER NINE\nand mind of Charon. The characters become part of the plans, marked by Fate for\na crucial role as smoothly running operations stumble and fall. They move from\nNecropolis battlefield to the heart of Stygia itself, and have a voice in the last council\nof the Stygian Empire.\n“The Last Danse Macabre” is a story of hope in the midst of tragedy. The institutions\nbuilt up over millennia to unite and govern the Restless Dead fail. As things fall apart,\nhowever, the characters move into position to pick up the pieces, or perhaps to build\nsomething new. The Underworld does not come to an end in this story, and its future form\ndepends greatly on what the characters do now. One era might be coming to an end, but\nthe next one is just beginning, with the characters at its epicenter.\nPART ONE: ENVIOUS GAZES\nThe first chapter begins with war. Yu Huang’s long-planned invasion of the\nDark Kingdom of Iron erupts, exploiting two advantages: the extent to which\nStygian military forces are committed to the destruction of the recently discovered\nblack city of vampires, and the Smiling Lord’s subtle treachery. The finest soldiers\nof the Dark Kingdom of Jade pour through artificial Byways, bypassing all the usual\nStygian defenses. The characters take part in the desperate battle for control of the\nNecropolis: the surprise of the attack, rallying for defense, engagements along the\nbeachhead perimeter and chases and clashes throughout the city.\nIn this first installment, the characters first face the basic challenges of mere\nsurvival, primarily those involved in getting away from shock troops (and complica-\ntions like exploding Artifact vehicles). Storytellers should pull out all the stops to\ncreate the impression of the sudden fear and confusion of the invasion. Dim the lights\nto simulate candlelight or “emergency power.” Play recorded sound effects of bombs\nand gunfire to create raging battles in the distance. Give the players all manner of\nfrantic reports from friends and allies around town. Narrator characters playing\ninvading Jade soldiers or local militia forces should naturally make frequent appear-\nances in one form or another, and characters should feel that there is little time to do\nanything other than escape the brunt of the invasion long enough to fight back.\nThen they join the ranks of Iron Kingdom wraiths taking the battle back to the\ninvaders. The key for the Storyteller here is to ensure all the characters’ utility during\nthe invasion. Physically fearsome wraiths are naturally able to find much to do, but\nsneakier types can also find places to hide or perform sabotage missions, while\nintellectual characters can plan strategy or research the weaknesses of the enemy.\nMore socially inclined characters can serve as leaders and firebrands to keep the\ntroops motivated. Weaving several subplots geared toward each type of character\naround the main arc of the invasion is generally the best way to make sure that\neveryone has a role to fulfill in the city’s common defense.\nRegardless of how they respond, this episode should ultimately conclude with\nthe wraiths helping repulse the invasion and securing the liberty of at least part of\nthe city to stage the next phase of their response — unless the characters seriously\nbotch their efforts.\nPART TWO: INTO THE DEPTHS\nJust as the characters have a chance to get their bearings again, the unexpected\ninterrupts their plans to push the invaders further back from their perimeters. A\nhigh-ranking Oracle arrives from Stygia with a fresh mission for the characters. He\nexplains Charon’s plan for rebirth (or at least as much as they need to know to get\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n264\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nthem moving). Knowing he was fated to perish in battle with Gorool, Charon long\nago entrusted his memories to the Mnemoi, who then disappeared under the guise\nof the empire’s greatest enemies and scattered to keep his memories from being kept\nin one place. After Charon’s fall, he was eventually reborn as an unassuming\ninvestment banker named Charles Anderson. Desperate times call for his early\nreturn, however, and the characters or the Oracle must fulfill Fate’s decrees by killing\nCharon, Reaping him and escorting him safely to Stygia to be reunited with his\nmemories, which have been kept safe for him by a most unlikely agent.\nOnce Charon has died a second time, the characters and their Oracle guide set\nout for Stygia, dealing with complications along the way. The battlefields across the\nNecropolis present risks from ambush to accidents amid the rubble, and once the\ncharacters descend into the Tempest, they face the turbulence and local storms\ncreated by the Jade invasion. Through all of this, they also have to deal with Charon,\nignorant of his role or indeed of anything else about the Underworld.\nWithin the upper reaches of the Tempest, the characters rescue a lone wraith\nfrom Shadow-eaten assassins only to find themselves the recipients of an unexpected\ngift. The wraith they rescue is a gentle, ancient wraith named Niska, one of the\nMnemoi, who transfers her share of Charon’s memories to the characters before\nsuccumbing to her terrible wounds. The characters then have the option of spending\na long subjective moment exploring some of Charon’s past before proceeding.\n(Flashbacks intermittently intrude throughout the rest of the scenario.)\nSpecific images for these memories are provided in Ends of Empire, pages 53-\n55. Storytellers without this resource should provide glimpses of scenes from the\ndistant past such as the founding of Stygia, an early conversation with the Lady of\nFate or similarly mysterious but powerful moments in Charon’s life.\nAt last, the Midnight Express arrives to provide the characters with some\nassistance. The characters get some much-needed rest and recuperation and get to\nspend a little time visiting with the train’s denizens. Elsewhere in the Tempest, the\nbattle against Enoch comes to its climax with the use of one of the Smiling Lord’s\nPERSONALITIES OF PART TWO\nStorytellers will note that no Traits are given for any of these characters.\nThis is deliberate, as their Traits should be whatever the Storyteller feels it is\nappropriate for them to have in her chronicle. This is not to say that they should\nbe mighty gods that outshine the players’ characters at everything, merely that\nthey should possess what the story requires them to have — no more, no less.\nThe Oracle — As written, the Oracle who arrives is John Davis, a dapper\nand charismatic 19th-century Southern gentleman and gambler. For the purposes\nof Oblivion, however, it is entirely appropriate to substitute a more familiar face\nif an Oracle or other servant of Fate has an established presence in the chronicle.\nRegardless of his identity, the Oracle should serve only as a guide, reluctant to\nintervene more directly lest his actions tangle the skein and alter the future.\nCharles Anderson — Charon’s mortal incarnation has no idea of his real\nidentity or his place in existence. He’s polite and unassuming, a heavy smoker in bad\nhealth with a quiet love of hymns and lullabies. As a wraith, he is unremarkable\nexcept for the fact that he has no Shadow whatsoever. Due to this internal cohesion,\nall attempts to manipulate him or control him incur a two-Trait penalty.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n265\nCHAPTER NINE\nrelic nuclear weapons. The characters know only that the Sixth Great Maelstrom\nerupts with the Midnight Express in sight of Stygia but not yet there.\nPART THREE: JOURNEY TO NO END\nAfter a long ride that provides some time to relax and discuss what has happened\n(perhaps also providing an interesting “locked room” session or two for all the\ncharacters as they find themselves confined to close quarters together), disaster strikes\nelsewhere in the Underworld as the Smiling Lord detonates his relic nuclear device\nover Enoch, destroying the black city of the vampires and unleashing the Sixth Great\nMaelstrom. The Midnight Express is derailed, and tension mounts as the characters\nand their companions must begin the very dangerous passage from the Midnight\nExpress to Stygia, dogged by rising numbers of Spectres and nightmarish Maelstrom\nwinds. Fortunately, just as things look their worst, the Skeletal Lord and his forces\nemerge from the darkness. Together the two groups fight their way to safety.\nOnce they are within the multiple layers of Stygian defense, the characters take\npart in the final council of the Deathlords. Needless to say, this should be a powerful\nroleplaying experience for all involved. It is highly recommended that a number of\nNarrator characters in full costume be enlisted to do justice to the various Deathlords\npresent. Business turns to restoring Charon after a brief discussion of the invasion,\nbut first the Lady of Fate announces that they must expose the traitor in their midst,\nthe one who sold out the empire to the Yellow Springs and opened the path for\ninvasion. The Smiling Lord’s treachery is exposed, and the characters have a chance\nto help catch the fleeing Deathlord and bring him to justice. Sentence is either\nimmediate destruction or being turned over to Lord Nhudri. It’s anyone’s guess\nwhich is really worse.\nOnce justice has been served, the task returns to aiding the Mnemoi in\nrebuilding Charon’s memories. This should be an imaginative and enigmatic scene,\ninvolving the characters and the Mnemoi attempting to take fractured pieces of\nfleeting moments and powerful memories and forge them into a whole again.\nStorytellers might wish to require a number of Mental Challenges with the Enigmas\nAbility to help, or even just ask the players to put together a real jigsaw puzzle or solve\nsome other real conundrum to represent the difficulty of the task. Colored lighting,\nA PERFECT CIRCLE\nIt can be all too easy to read each instance of “the characters” as referring to\na single specific Circle in the troupe becoming the sole “heroes” of this scenario,\nparticularly during the second and fourth parts. Don’t let this happen. While many\n“scripted” events must occur to move the story forward as described, nothing says\nonly one particular Circle can be the one to do it all. In Part Two, for instance, one\nCircle might be made responsible for the grim yet vital task of killing Charles\nAnderson and helping him adjust to the afterlife, while another might be the\ngroup that finds Niska and receives some of Charon’s memories. In Part Four, the\nmost combat-oriented wraiths might band together to take down Coldheart,\nwhile a more socially adept group could find itself talking down important allies\nfrom Catharsis. Simply make sure that each Circle’s work keeps it cooperating and\nultimately leads back to the main story. Look at the players and what their Circles\nenjoy, and make sure there’s plenty of important work for all characters and Circles\nto do as the story builds.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n266\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nmontages of bizarre and ancient images and ethereal music might also go a long way\ntoward portraying the bizarrely beautiful halls of the memory palace.\nUnfortunately, it is ultimately a task that is already destined to end in only\npartial success, despite their efforts. Quite simply, too many Mnemoi have been\ndestroyed, too many of Charon’s memories lost over time to fully rebuild the memory\npalace. Therefore, the episode ends with Charon, though restored to his old\npersonality and some semblance of his previous grandeur, sadly announcing that he\ncan no longer be the leader he once was.\nPART FOUR: THE END OF ALL THINGS\nThe scenario’s final chapter opens not too long after, with Stygia coming under\nattack from within as well as without. As the Great Maelstrom lashes Stygia, the\nthousands of Spectres captured by Martyr Knights and stored in the city’s catacombs\nburst loose. Adding more misery to this total, the Pardoners’ vast container of Angst\nexplodes, drenching many hapless wraiths with purified liquid Angst and sending\nthose so exposed into instant Catharsis. While the Spectral assault from the Tempest\nescalates, the city’s wraiths fight against unexpected enemies and their own\ncomrades fallen to Oblivion. Charon and the Deathlords ride into a battle that ebbs\nand flows across the breadth of the city.\nThe battle brings in all the forces opposed to Oblivion, including the Ferrymen,\nreturning to the city for the first time since they turned their backs on Charon. Victory\ndoes not come easily — some of the empire’s most powerful wraiths sacrifice\nthemselves to buy time for others. If there was ever a time during this scenario to not\nhold back with staging and atmosphere, this is it. Storytellers should do all they can\nPERSONALITIES OF PART FOUR\nColdheart — The general of the Labyrinth, this ancient Nephwrack has\nlong dreamt of the day he would finally tear Stygia apart and rend its society\nasunder. Surrounded by an elite force of Doppelgangers and Mortwights and\nmaster of countless forms of magic and killing, he is a nightmarish foe on the\nbattlefield, easily a worthy adversary for two or even three Circles of powerful\nwraiths. Stepping forward to battle Coldheart should be the most terrifying\nexperience a wraith will ever have, as his power and fury at being challenged will\nbe almost beyond their imagining. Defeating him routs the armies of Oblivion in\none stroke, however, not to mention making for a stirring and intense scene.\nThe Mourners — These bizarre and terrifying creatures appear as a mob of\nwailing, grieving wraiths clad in simple mourning clothes. Though they never\nappear to hurry, they inexorably gain ground on a character who catches their\nattention, and they cannot be slain — only driven off with powerful Arcanoi or\nartifacts. Most terrifying of all, any wraith who touches one of them or attempts\nto read their thoughts contracts Mournerism and transforms into one of the mob\nin mere moments. Absolutely no power or skill can prevent this transformation.\n(It is generally best to have the players witness one or two Narrator characters\nsuffer this fate in order to avoid losing characters to such simple contact during\nan initial encounter with the Mourners.) They wander the streets of Stygia\nduring the battle, eventually herding the characters to the base of Charon’s tower\nas the final moments of this scenario play out.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n267\nCHAPTER NINE\nMAELSTROM FORCE LEVELS\n• Force One — Winds blow up to 40 mph. “Rain” includes liquids carried\nup from the Tempest and some small pieces of solid debris. Unprotected wraiths\nmust make a Physical Challenge (retest Survival) against three Traits or suffer two\nlevels of normal damage per scene of exposure. Light armor and minimal shelter\noffer complete protection. Haunts reduce damage by one level per Haunt rating.\n• Force Two — Winds blow up to 80 mph. All tasks undertaken outdoors\nor in places the wind can reach incur a one-Trait penalty. “Rain” includes\nstrange, noxious liquids and wriggling live plasmics. Solid debris includes\nchunks of pavement, wind-sharpened fragments of bone and Stygian steel and\nother dangerous objects. Spectres often move through the storm. Unprotected\nwraiths must make a Physical test as described before, but the difficulty is five\nTraits, the damage becomes three levels per scene, and it is aggravated up to one\nquarter of the time. Armor provides its usual protection, while Haunts reduce\ndamage by one level per Haunt rating. The storm blows in windows, rips away\nloose roofs and the like, but it cannot break through solid structures.\n• Force Three — Winds blow up to 120 mph. Outdoor activities are at a two-\nTrait penalty. “Rain” consists of a mixture of harmless and dangerous elements,\nincluding dangerous fluids from the Tempest and hostile plasmics. Spectres fill the\nstorm and converge on exposed wraiths. Unprotected wraiths must make a Physical\ntest against a difficulty of seven Traits or suffer four levels of damage per scene. This\ndamage is aggravated about half the time. Armor counts for only half its normal health\nlevels for the purposes of the storm. Haunts reduce damage by one level per Haunt\nrating. The storm easily smashes through flimsy Shadowlands doors, roofs and walls.\n• Force Four — Winds blow to at least 200 mph. Outdoor activities are at +3\ndifficulty (or higher). Rain and debris slashes in from all angles, penetrating any\nplace that is not tightly sealed. Spectres fill the storm and attack anyone outdoors\nfor more than a minute or two. Exposed wraiths must test against difficulty 10 or\nsuffer six levels of damage each scene. This damage is aggravated half the time.\nArmor counts for half its normal value. Haunts reduce damage by one less level than\nthe Haunt ratings. Buildings that lack strong reinforcement might collapse.\n• Force Five — Storms this strong blow only at the moments of greatest\nchaos, like the outbreak of a Great Maelstrom. Wind speeds are immeasurable.\nOutdoor activities are at a minimum of a four-Trait penalty, and possibly much\nhigher. Spectres converge almost instantly on exposed targets. Exposed wraiths\nmust succeed at a test against a difficulty of 16 Traits or suffer eight levels of\ndamage per scene, usually aggravated. Armor provides two less levels of\nprotection than normal, rounded down. Haunts reduce damage by one level per\ntwo points of Haunt rating, rounded down. Only massive Citadels, structures of\nStygian steel and the like stand much chance of surviving.\nto convey the chaos of the Maelstrom and the raging battle, keeping the players\ndesperately hunting for ways their characters can turn back what appears to be certain\ndoom. Friends and foes are cut down forever all around, everything they consider\nprecious is on the line, and the fate of the world is in the balance. The players should\nfeel that this is it, all or nothing, and be expecting either outcome as equally likely.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n268\nLAWS OF JUDGMENT\nAt last, however, the sacrifice pays off. Coldheart, the enemy general, is destroyed\nat the hands of a brave band of characters, and the forces of the Labyrinth fall into\ndisarray, until they are driven from the field in a total rout. When the Spectral hordes\nat last retreat, however, the Isle of Sorrows has been so badly battered that it cannot be\nrestored. After the fighting ends, Charon’s final acts as emperor before his Transcen-\ndence in a glowing column of light include opening the way for his heirs (namely the\ncharacters) to find a new home and found a new society for the Underworld.\nThe scenario ends with the prospect of rebuilding. The characters and the other\nwraiths face a future in which the old powers are gone forever. Now it’s time to rebuild\nand prepare for the immediate challenges — the continuing devastation wrought by\nSixth Great Maelstrom foremost among them — and for the long-term futures. They\ncan choose to take their fellow survivors and begin building a new social order (perhaps\ntaking over where one of the previous groups left off), or they may choose to lead an\nexodus in search of a new “homeland” in the Underworld, where they may seek their\nfinal destiny. Perhaps they will even do both, with some remaining behind to forge a\nnew order while others explore the far ranges of the undiscovered country. What\nhappens from there is entirely up to the players to determine (if they wish to continue\nat all). For its part, however, “The Last Dance Macabre” has ended.\nALTERNATIVE ENDINGS\nOf course, while it ties together many of the stories that have been part of\nOblivion since the beginning, “The Last Dance Macabre” is not the only direction\nan Oblivion story of the End Times could take. What follows is a brief discussion of\ntwo other possible endings Storytellers might want to explore.\nSTORM-TOSSED REFUGEES\nNot all wraiths caught in the Sixth Great Maelstrom are instantly sent into\nDestruction Harrowings. Some exceptionally lucky or determined wraiths find\nthemselves inexplicably returned to the lands of the living, as though the storm had\nliterally blown them back into the physical world once more. Unlike normal Risen,\nhowever, these creatures do not require a Conduit for their Shadow to inhabit. Both\nPsyche and Shadow remain in the body together, bound together as they always have\nbeen. No longer do Fetters bind them or Passions rule their every thought (though\nboth remain extremely important in any event). Such wraiths are closer to their pre-\ndeath mental state than ever.\nThis is not to say that the process is without drawbacks, however. To begin with,\nit is not something that can be done intentionally, not unless the wraith is suicidal\nenough to risk the storm in the hopes it will carry him back to the living instead of\njust to his own destruction. Furthermore, not all wraiths find themselves back in\ntheir own bodies. While some reconstitute centuries-old corpses to inhabit (even\nmake them reasonably lifelike), others find themselves trapped in rotting shells or\neven the body of another departed soul. Either can have dire consequences on the\nsanity of the Psyche, not to mention feeding the Shadow great amounts of Angst\nfrom the miserable conditions and lingering separation from true living that the\nPsyche must endure daily. Lastly, the agony of the crossing and condition of the body\nrenders many of these unfortunate wraiths little more than animalistic zombies,\nexisting only to prey on the living.\nHaving the troupe’s characters caught up in the storm and unexpectedly blown\nback into the living world as a group can make for an extremely fascinating and\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n269\nCHAPTER NINE\nintense roleplaying experience. (Perhaps the communal Haunt finally gives way\nunder the pounding of the storm after a tense session of waiting and fearing the worst,\nonly to deliver the characters to this unexpected fate instead of the Labyrinth.)\nFormer enemies might potentially turn to each other for comfort in the face of the\npain and isolation they feel as undead walking among the living — or take the\nopportunity to settle some scores with each other and the Skinlands in ways they\nnever could dream of across the Shroud. The characters might even attempt to break\noff and form their own “community of the dead” away from the eyes of the living,\nwhich has its own fantastic possibilities.\nIn terms of game mechanics, such characters are subject to the normal creation\nor conversion rules as ordinary Risen, with the following exceptions. First, they do\nnot require a Conduit, nor are subject to any rules or conditions relating to one. They\ngain Angst, experience Catharsis and suffer from the predations of their Shadows\njust like ordinary wraiths. Second, while they do not require the normal minimum\nlevels of certain Arcanoi to “rise” (since the storm does it for them), the same\nArcanoi remain impossible to utilize in the living world. They do have the same\npotential to develop a small number of vampiric Disciplines to simulate their\nenhanced physical prowess, though.\nLast but not least, such restless dead often find themselves dealing with the imbued\nhunters of Laws of the Reckoning at one time or another. The circumstances that\ncreated the imbued and drove the wraiths back to their bodies appear to be mysteriously\nlinked, somehow. Of course, whether contact means a bloody battle or a tender\nexamination of life and the nature of letting go depends entirely on the attitudes of\nindividual imbued encountered, as determined by the Storyteller. Exploring the appar-\nent connection between the wraiths of Oblivion and the imbued of, however, Reckoning\ncan make for a fascinating series of stories as both sides try to figure out what must be done\nabout the peril they find themselves in during the End Times.\nDON’T LOOK BACK\nSome inquisitive and creative Oblivion Storytellers have doubtless looked into\nthe material found in the Orpheus limited series as a possible direction to take their\ngames. Naturally, Storytellers who wish to take this road are naturally free to do so\nif they desire, but they should weigh a few facts before proceeding.\nMost importantly, while it certainly has similarities, Orpheus was not designed\nfor compatibility with either Wraith or Mind’s Eye Theatre. It is a game in full, with\nits own rules, flavor, history and setting material that requires a great deal of\nexamination and testing if the Storyteller wishes to make full use of what it has to\noffer, without making both games unplayable in the process. In addition, its story arc\nhas already been determined, meaning that unless they intend to switch their\ncontinuity to match that of Orpheus, Storytellers should expect to do additional\nwork to mesh the disparate elements of these two games without losing what\ninterested them in the first place.\nWith that in mind, if both players and Storytellers still desire to investigate a\ntransition from the hope, horror and tragedy of Oblivion to the mystery, danger and\nintrigue of Orpheus, then of course the choice is theirs to make.

It’s not easy. Life doesn’t come packaged in neat, easily\ndigestible pieces you can slot in when they’re convenient. Neither do most roleplaying\nchronicles, despite the best designs of the Storyteller. Having said that, let us hasten\nto add that this is exactly what this book is all about: helping Storytellers bring their\nchronicles to a smashing close. Hopefully this end will provoke, entertain, sadden and\nsatisfy all the Storytellers and players who have dedicated themselves to and immersed\nthemselves in this engaging and complex chronicle world.\nFine. But exactly how do you go about doing that? Few Storytellers and even\nfewer players have ever participated in a chronicle that came to an end on purpose.\nWe’ve all seen chronicles die out as players move away or need to put a game on hold\nto accommodate real-life concerns. Some of these games end abruptly, without any\nreal resolution. Others simply never get underway again. But this time how you make\nthe exit is in your own hands.\nTo do so, Storytellers need do no more than consider all those elements they’ve\nconsidered when building the chronicle. So, no big surprises! Just do what you’ve\nbeen doing all along but with an eye toward tying up the loose ends. Such elements\nas plot, scope, scale, direction and pacing should be old hat by now, and they can\neven be used to cover up your true intent so the players don’t even realize that the\nchronicle is ending until it slaps them in the face. Though bringing existing\nchronicles to an end receives most of the emphasis of this chapter, there’s no reason\na Storyteller can’t begin a chronicle with an eye toward the ultimate end. Whichever\nyou’re doing, the following considerations are the nuts and bolts you can use to build\nan End-Times chronicle from scratch or incorporate it into an existing chronicle. By\nconsidering all these elements as well as the preferences of your players, you can judge\nwhich end best fits your chronicle, build the framework to bring that story into being\nand prep your players so they’re ready and eager to undertake an End-Time story.\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nCHAPTER TEN:\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nREVELATIONS\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n272\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nPLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nThis is it. The final curtain; the last hurrah. So you’re probably asking, “Now\nwhat?” How can you create a plot that’s so far reaching it ends the entire world while\ntying up loose ends you’ve left hanging throughout your chronicle? Doing so, how\ncan you make your players not only accept the world’s demise but enjoy it? It ain’t\neasy, but it can indeed be worth it.\nSource materials have been hinting and threatening and almost, but not quite,\ngetting to “The End” for some time now. Your players have probably become inured\nto the “Oh no, it’s the end of the world” scenario long since, so how do you awaken\nthem from their it’s-just-another-save-the-world-scenario ennui and ready them for\na true end to it all?\nUse a bit of shock factor. The easiest way to invoke shock, fear and trepidation\nis to kill lots and lots of characters. Preferably all those Narrator characters the\ncharacters have grown attached to and accustomed to having around. Go after\nwards, kinfolk, lovers, teachers, superiors, apprentices, little brothers, parents,\nfriends, co-workers, the guy that runs the news kiosk and the girl who serves\ncappuccino. Don’t kill characters just for the sake of being mean or showing that\nyou’re serious, but don’t be afraid to be ruthless either. The players will get the\nmessage pretty quickly that things are taking a turn for the worse.\nOf course, if this seems a little too radical for you, there are other options. You\ncan slowly increase the tension by steadily piling one disaster on top of another until\nthe characters can’t see any way out. Doing so gives them more time to notice subtler\nclues and to attempt more fixes to take care of the problem. Most players will go on\nfocusing their characters’ actions on alleviating the symptoms as long as you never\nquite make it clear that the actual disease is not only inevitable, but looming right\noverhead. The other type of plot focuses more on quick, often disjointed seeming\nscenarios, all of which lead to an inescapable conclusion — the world is doomed. You\ncan, of course, combine these two methods.\nWhichever method you choose, you must incorporate elements into this final\nplot that truly mean something to the characters and tie up many of the loose ends\nyou’ve left hanging. Just another raid on the corporate criminals who are to blame\nfor the awful state of the world won’t mean anything to your players unless the\ncompany soldiers murdered their families. If their sisters are married to the CEO and\nthe poisons the bad guys are emitting from their factories are corrupting the\ncharacters’ closest allies, you have something worth their time. The plot must make\nsense in the context of the stories you’ve told in the past and must lead to the\ninevitable, no matter how slowly. Keep the plotting tight, and make every session\naim a little more pointedly toward the finale. Some troupes prefer to know\nbeforehand that this will lead to the end. If you think your players would want that,\nby all means, let them in on things and even ask for issues they’d like to see covered\nor stories they’d like to be told before the demise of the chronicle.\nOne major point: Be aware that not all players will want to end the chronicle\nand may attempt to turn aside or subvert the story. Some may flatly refuse to play if\nyou’re going to kill their characters or conclude the game. Don’t let players derail the\nstory because they’re afraid of losing their characters or because they are reluctant\nto face the sorts of issues an End-Times chronicle inevitably raises. If you cave in to\npressure, you won’t be happy that you have no control over your own game — and\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n273\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nneither will they in the long run. You’ll be resentful and they’ll never trust that you\naren’t sneaking in elements that will railroad them into the end anyway. If some\nplayers don’t wish to continue, write them out, but do not let a few naysayers ruin\nthings for the whole troupe. Stick with the plan and eventually they will see the\nincredible roleplaying potential in the End-Times game.\nJust make certain that you’ve chosen an end that fits your strengths as a\nStoryteller as well as your players’ talents. If you’ve spent two years running a\nhighly charged mega-action game, they won’t enjoy a sudden switch to subtle\npolitical maneuvering where their characters’ best kung fu moves mean nothing.\nEven if they go down fighting, they should feel that it was worth every drop of blood\nspent. If you go for excitement, a worthwhile goal and lots of emotional involve-\nment, it won’t matter if you fail to address a minor issue here or there. They’ll talk\nabout this for years.\nPERSONALIZING\nERSONALIZING\nERSONALIZING\nERSONALIZING\nERSONALIZING T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E S S S S SCENARIO\nCENARIO\nCENARIO\nCENARIO\nCENARIO\nWith chronicles of this magnitude, it’s easy for characters to become overshad-\nowed by events. After all, so much is happening, and on such a grand scale, that it\nis very easy to focus on what happens next rather than let smaller moments of\nsatisfaction linger. Remember, though, that roleplaying is a group effort — especially\nlive-action roleplaying — and the real issue is not the catastrophe at hand, but the\ncharacters’ experience of it. If you’ve taken steps to make sure that all of the\ncharacters can be involved with the action, you’re well on your way to ensuring a\nsuccessful chronicle. You can do a few more things, however, to make sure that your\nplayers feel they are essential parts of this story.\nWith an epic tale come equally dramatic moments. Each character should have\na chance to shine, even if only the player recognizes it for what it is at the time. Perhaps\nshe has an unusual ability that is essential to the success of a mission. Perhaps she has\nthe opportunity to finally reconcile with a long-lost love after years spent apart. Or the\ncharacters might find themselves, at the end, sacrificing themselves for the greater\ngood (or ill). Your players’ characters are the heroes and anti-heroes of the story, and\nthey deserve that opportunity. Just remember not to blatantly telegraph these\nmoments. If the other players are saying things like, “Oh, so I guess this is Rick’s special\nmoment now, let’s all stand aside and wait our turn,” something is very wrong.\nTry to incorporate as many personal stories into the End-Times game as\npossible. There’s nothing more frustrating for players than to feel like their charac-\nters just happen to be handy cardboard cutouts the Storyteller can run through their\npaces. If Baron September’s greatest fear is to be separated from his true love, off to\nthe tower she goes. If Defends-the-Peace dreams of rallying the disparate packs of his\nsept against the Wyrm in the final hours of the world, let him have a chance to make\nthe speech that will bring them all together at last. Even if it’s something as simple\nas allowing Tony a chance to tell Rae how much he loves her, give him the moment\nto do so, if only with his dying breath. Personalizing the game, especially the End-\nTime story, is the only real way to make this the best story possible.\nThe only unbreakable guideline is to never ruin a player’s moment. Although\nyou’re understandably excited to find out what happens when he discovers that the\nGarou Nation will sing of his glorious day until the end of time, that’s no excuse to\nrush his dramatic death scene. This rule goes for the other players, too. If another\nplayer decides to ask you about a ruling just as the eshu has gotten on his knees to\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n274\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nbeg for forgiveness from his long-lost true love, quietly inform the intruder that this\nisn’t the appropriate time. It’s your job to protect those moments, particularly since\nit’s usually those moments that players often remember years later.\nTWISTS\nWISTS\nWISTS\nWISTS\nWISTS A N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D T T T T TURNS\nURNS\nURNS\nURNS\nURNS\nNo real situation ever moves in a straight line from inception to conclusion\nwithout plenty of turns and twists along the way. Try to anticipate the points where\nthe players will be expecting certain things, then do something totally unexpected\ninstead. Or give them what they’re expecting but in a radically different form.\nApproach things from a new angle. Introduce a story where the characters must\ncooperate with someone they detest. Try a scene in which someone they absolutely\nlove and trust betrays them — maybe just so she can prevent the characters from\nbeing killed outright — yet leave them wondering what the real reason was.\nOr let them get their revenge for the betrayal, then find out later that their\nfriend was innocent. What if everything they thought they knew is a horrible load\nof propaganda brokered by ancient power players they’ve had no clue existed until\nnow? Worse yet, what if they’ve acted all along while assuming those ancient power\nmongers are controlling everything and there aren’t any? What if everything they’ve\ndone can be laid squarely at their own doors rather than blamed on circumstance?\nFeel free to take a few hairpin turns along the way so your story doesn’t become static.\nThe players and their characters might know they’re headed for disaster, but those\nfew unexpected reprieves along the way could give them the necessary courage or\ndetermination to continue to the end.\nTwists are another means of avoiding the problem of players who decide to ruin\ntheir own fun and read all the scenarios in this book so they know what will happen\nnext. Throw them for a loop. Take part of one scenario and fuse it with an element\nof another (maybe even from a different game), throw some of your own original\nideas into the mix and voila! Your game just became a lot harder for your bibliophile\nto predict, and therefore more fun as well.\nSCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE\nPotentially, the scope of an End-Times chronicle is limitless. After all, this is\nthe biggest thing to ever happen in the world, and it affects everyone (at least\neveryone the players care about). There’s nothing to stop you from having Lasombra\nvampires cooperating with Red Talons while flying around the world in an Ether\nship on their way to the Dreaming to rescue the last surviving wraiths in some wild\nattempt to stave off disaster, if that’s what you want. In fact, that could well be the\nbest solution to tying up a number of loose ends, especially if your chronicle has\ngrown as truly… eclectic as many older ones do over time.\nIt will probably be a tad more effective, however, to limit the scope of the game\na little. While things are happening all over the world and affecting all supernatural\nbeings, there’s no point in dragging in elements that have not been an integral part\nof the chronicle all along to confound the characters at the last minute. It confuses\nthe issue and diffuses the players’ energies.\nThat doesn’t mean you can’t use needed story elements, just make certain they\nactually relate to the characters and the situation they’re in. No matter how\nimportant the story is, the players won’t respond to it if it doesn’t involve their\ncharacters and bring their tales to satisfying conclusions.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n275\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nWhat about the vampire character who has struggled through the whole\nchronicle vainly attempting to regain her lost humanity, searching for some elixir\nor magical device that will restore her to what she once was? Will she care about some\nplan to avert disaster if it doesn’t involve her either achieving her goal or discovering\nthat the very powers she despises are essential to overcoming the catastrophe? What\nif even those powers aren’t enough? Will she strive to gain new powers (as she feels\nherself becoming ever less human) to try to succeed in an impossible task? Will she\ndo what she can to mitigate the situation (thereby rediscovering the humanity she\nthought she’d lost) and try to salvage something for others even as she is destroyed?\nTo fully involve the players, you might need to limit the scope of the game to\nthe personal telling against a wider background. The world may be going to hell in\na hand basket, but the characters need to be grounded in what they care about to truly\nfeel their essential part in things. Then again, showing some of the wider ramifica-\ntions and events happening elsewhere will bring home the gravity of the situation.\nThat’s where scale comes in.\nSCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nMost Storytellers hope to tell a grand, sweeping story, a great chronicle\nthat encompasses myriad story lines and might take years to complete — if it\nis ever finished. Even such epic stories pale in comparison to the End-Times\nchronicle, however.\nIn even the smallest, most local story, you’ve always got to consider the breadth\nof the drama. How local is it? Does what happens in one place affect what happens\nelsewhere? What about events from outside the area covered in a chronicle? Do\nevents that happen somewhere else in the world impinge upon the local game?\nENDING\nNDING\nNDING\nNDING\nNDING E E E E EVERY\nVERY\nVERY\nVERY\nVERY S S S S STORY\nTORY\nTORY\nTORY\nTORY\nWith a chronicle’s end comes the end of all the individual stories of the\ncharacters. Storytellers should not neglect the small, personal stories that form\nthe various subplots and defining moments surrounding the players’ characters\n— the son estranged from his mother, the businessman whose company was\ntaken over by demonic thralls, the former junkie trying to rescue his lover from\na blood cult.\nThese stories can easily be swept aside and forgotten in the chaos of the\nfinal days, but that would be a shame. Now more than ever, these “little” events\nare important to characters. These personal matters are last chances for\nrevenge, forgiveness or simply closure before everything burns away.\nStorytellers should look for opportunities to include characters’ personal\nstories, plot hooks and unresolved issues in the finale of the chronicle. These\nstories don’t have to end happily or cleanly. There are bound to be tragic,\nterrible conclusions to some — say, a lover killed by a rival out of spite. Others\nmay end well, even in the chaos and horror of the last of days. A distant child\nmight forgive his mother in the face of Armageddon. If the characters are to\nface the threat of eternal night and march toward an uncertain tomorrow, it’s\nbest if lingering matters are resolved so they don’t hold anyone back. Best for\nthe characters, best for the players, and best for your final story.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n276\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nThose who have played Apocalypse can’t help but be affected by the departure of\nthe Stargazers or the rampant paranoia surrounding the appearance of Anthelios.\nMasquerade players might have felt the loss of Ravnos characters when that clan was\nall but destroyed during the Week of Nightmares. All of this has to do with the scale\nof the game.\nIn other words, when the World of Darkness comes to an end, your players’\ncharacters — no matter how insular — will be part of it whether they engage\nonly in local matters or trot all over the world interacting with characters from\nexotic and far-flung locales. Individual Storytellers will have to decide whether\nto make their games global in nature or confine them to those events that have\nthe most meaning for their players’ characters. This will be especially impor-\ntant to games that involve players from several home chronicles who travel to\nother areas to play.\nWhile it is best to limit the scale of the game to the immediate locale, brining\nin elements from foreign climes — even just as rumors of events — will strengthen\nthe overall story the characters are experiencing. In essence, the characters play out\ntheir drama against a far more massive backdrop than their local theatre can\nencompass. That grand scale doesn’t have to impinge directly on the neighborhood,\nbut the characters should be aware that they are only a part of a vast undertaking.\nGiving them that sense of scale should make clear how serious these events are, and\nit might bring out some of the helplessness many people feel in the face of disasters\nthey can’t avert. Nonetheless, the characters should always be made to feel that no\nmatter how small their part seems, it is still vital and might just turn the tide in the\nend. “Think globally, act locally” is a major cliché nowadays, but it pretty accurately\nsums up what the scale of the game should strive to be.\nDIRECTION\nIRECTION\nIRECTION\nIRECTION\nIRECTION\nMore than with any other chronicle, the last chronicle needs to have a specific\ndirection, starting from an identifiable beginning, through the meat of the chronicle\nand building toward the finale. Too many side issues will ruin the flavor of the story\nbeing told, so unless something is of major importance to the characters, it’s best to\nleave it out. Naturally, some characters might feel that their political aspirations or\ntheir magical ranking are the story. But seriously, what does politicking matter when\nthe sun’s being snuffed out? Who cares about prestige or magical ranking when all\nthe air just left the planet?\nWhile it is essential to treat the characters’ concerns as the central frame around\nwhich you build your story, you must direct the action toward specific ends. Almost\nevery troupe has one or two players who insist on wheeling and dealing to the\nexclusion of everything else. How will you involve those players without sacrificing\nthe rest and without losing the direction you want the story to take? There won’t be\ntime for some character’s crafty and politically convoluted yearlong chronicle to\nmaneuver her opponents aside and win the throne or gain the princedom. Why\nwould the character want those things anyway when the world is ending? Some\nplayers will realize the foolishness of the character’s aspirations at that point and join\nthe main story thread. Others will not. So if that’s the only thing that means\nanything to the character, by all means, work it in and leave her sitting atop a\ntoppling throne ruling over empty nothingness as the world crashes to an end. Just\nincorporate it into the direction you are pushing your chronicle. If necessary, secretly\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n277\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nmeet with the rest of the players and gain their cooperation in the old tactic of\nshunning. It works like this:\nIf the character insists on playing up her political maneuvering, nobody else acts\nlike they care. They all ignore her as she plots and plans, then allow her to take the\nthrone and pay no attention whatsoever to her decrees. It’s hard for a ruler to enforce\nher will when nobody plays along. While she’s playing queen for a day, the rest of the\ncharacters can go about the actual story you’ve woven for them while seeing how\nhollow such trappings as rulership truly are in the face of annihilation. At the\nextreme, if the character is disrupting things too much, the rest of the characters can\ntopple her from the throne and force her compliance or — sigh — destroy or banish\nthe character. Meanwhile, this becomes a lesson in group dynamics and cooperation\nfor the good of all.\nThen again, if this is all too harsh and if the character is truly crafty, you\nmight allow her to play out her little game. She might win the princedom or\nqueenship and brilliantly lead everyone along the shining glorious road to\nvictory — or conversely, provide a delicious distraction that undercuts what the\ncharacters are struggling to achieve.\nIn any case, if you’ve read your players correctly, it shouldn’t be too hard to\ninvolve them in End-Time stories they’ll be looking for. Give them a clear sign of\nthe way you want them to go, and they’ll write the story for you.\nPACING\nACING\nACING\nACING\nACING\nAt some time or another, everyone has experienced a game that seemed to drag\non forever with nothing really happening, where eventually characters were left\nwith nothing to talk about but frivolous or out-of-game topics. That generally\nhappens when the Storyteller has to run a game without sufficient time to plan it,\nwhen he can’t think of anything to run or when he’s afraid the session will end too\nquickly. It’s incredibly frustrating and boring for the players. Presumably, with the\nend looming just ahead, the Storyteller won’t lack for material.\nOn the other hand, you’ve probably played in games where there’s so much\ngoing on — all of it in different places — that you don’t understand what’s happening\nand can’t adjust what you’re doing in time to be in on anything exciting. The\ncharacter careens from scene to scene with no clear idea of why or what it’s all about.\nThat can be equally frustrating, because while it is perfectly fine to make the\ncharacters feel as though they can’t keep up with what’s going on, having events\noccurring so rapidly that the players feel lost just breeds confusion and frustration.\nUnfortunately, with everything that needs to be brought out in an End-Times\nchronicle, it’s all too possible for things to get lost in the shuffle.\nIn an End-Time scenario, pacing is critical. Because the end is coming — but\nnot quite yet — you must give the characters and the players mile markers along the\nway. Goals to accomplish in the short run that have an effect on how soon and under\nwhat conditions the end comes. Once you’ve begun the beginning of the end, you\nwon’t be able to turn aside from it, but you also can’t postpone it forever. You need\nto set a certain time (even if just for your own knowledge) by which the end willcome\nwhether the characters are ready or not.\nDoing so creates tension and a sense of needing to spend their time wisely\nto accomplish what they can before they’re wiped out of existence. Then, stick\nto this timetable as much as possible. You can always fudge a little if an incredible\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n278\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nstory is in the middle of unfolding that will become the greatest End-Times\nchronicle anyone could have ever hoped to run. You can also shorten the time\nand set the bomb ticking faster if the characters just aren’t responding. There’s\nnothing wrong with having the characters just run out of time as they race to\navert disaster, at least if they deserve it due to their prior apathy or inaction.\nCertainly it’s a more realistic ending, if a bit less satisfying emotionally. Just\ndon’t put them out there on a crash course to Armageddon, then keep delaying\nthe denouement until they’re sick of the whole mess.\nFLAVOR\nLAVOR\nLAVOR\nLAVOR\nLAVOR\nThe exact flavor of the game depends heavily on which scenario you choose as\nmost appropriate for your players. If you decide that things should go out with a\nwhimper, it’s highly unlikely you’ll strive for a triumphant feel to the game. Likewise,\nif you plan on sending them out with a bang, a totally pessimistic slant (with no hope\nfor what comes after) will drag the game down no matter how many pyrotechnics you\ntry to include. Do you plan on triumph or disaster? Are you shooting for a game in\nwhich the characters go down to sweet oblivion knowing they’ve saved something\nfor the people of the future? Will they be dragged down kicking and screaming to a\ndark abyss never knowing if their sacrifice was for nothing? Or are you trying for a\nflavor that is something in between those two? Do you plan to offer the optimists in\nthe group hope that they just might survive? Or would your players rather throw their\ncharacters into the fray knowing they’ll die and expecting nothing less than a\nhorrible, painful, meaningless death? Is this all about greatness or a cynical telling\nof disaster that can’t be averted, death that can’t be avoided and the obliteration of\nall the characters ever meant for no purpose other than nihilism?\nMost players would rather see favorite characters survive, but if that’s not\npossible, they want their deaths to be noble, heroic, honorable or meaningful. Who\nwants to be the hapless soul that slips on grease from his cheese fries and breaks his\nneck falling downstairs?\nOn another note, far too many games begin with grave matters consuming the\nattention of the players, yet somehow humor manages to intrude. It’s a fact that\nhuman beings just aren’t made for unalloyed horror and fear, and in appropriate\ndoses, humor often provides the sauce that makes the rest of the game spicier. In\nhis most powerful tragedies, after all, Shakespeare still included at least a little\nhumor because its inclusion contrasted the heavier emotions of the rest of the\nwork. If all we ever do is weep, why fight to keep anything going? Players and\ncharacters alike need a little of the lighter emotions to give them something worth\nfighting for. This is not to say that non-stop joking should be encouraged\n(especially out of character), but if you allow it judiciously, as an accent at the right\nplaces, it can make or break a story.\nBUILDUP\nUILDUP\nUILDUP\nUILDUP\nUILDUP\nPacing and buildup are related but have an important difference that bears\nmentioning. No good story starts at the top of the action and runs headlong to the\nfinish unless it’s a very short film. Even then, there’s usually some sort of slower start,\nthen the action builds gradually from there. With an End-Time story, you should\nbegin by inserting small clues, then some other clues, resolve some and finally move\ninto the action phase while adding even more to the initial information.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n279\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nContinuing to increase the action while making the final picture come more\ninto focus increases the tension of the game while always giving the characters\nsomething to do. Information without action is boring. Action without information\nto work with becomes tiring and frustrating. Use both to build from a slow beginning\nwith a few hints of what’s to come, increasing the stakes until your troupe is rushing\nto an inescapable end.\nEven if the end doesn’t bode well for the characters personally, it might provide\nthem with the opportunity to strike some sort of telling blow to mitigate an otherwise\nwholly dark future. Feel free to build slowly and methodically if that’s what the\nplayers prefer, but be prepared to have to accommodate those who make greater\nintuitive leaps forward.\nOMENS\nMENS\nMENS\nMENS\nMENS\nOne of the joys of running an End-Times chronicle is the omens you can scatter\nthroughout the story. Go ahead and write some cool prophecies early on, just\nremember to work them into the story at some point. Naturally, it’s best if the omens\necho some of the ones already made known through various World of Darkness\nbooks (notably Rage Across the Heavens for Werewolf and several later Vampire\nbooks, such as Time of Thin Blood). The various “in-game” books from different\nlines such as The Book of Nod, The Chronicle of the Black Labyrinth and Apocrypha are\nalso excellent sources that you can mine for more ideas. But feel free to make up your\nown to customize your own games.\nSome of the omens or prophecies should relate directly to your players’\ncharacters. You could involve something from their backgrounds, people they know,\ninformation they know, items they have acquired or deeds they need to perform. You\ncan even work your own prophecies and omens into some of the published ones to\nreflect special attributes, knowledge or skills your players’ characters possess.\nFor example, if a character is a scholar, you might involve her in discovering\nsome esoteric knowledge or uncovering an ancient tale that has a prophecy that\nconcerns her buried within it. A more physical character might defeat a foe only to\nfind he’s carrying some item that gives a clue the character has needed to work out\na mystery that has plagued him for some time. If it also gives the other characters\ninformation or provides them with an omen or the answer to questions they’ve had\nconcerning events in the chronicle, so much the better.\nFORESHADOWING\nORESHADOWING\nORESHADOWING\nORESHADOWING\nORESHADOWING\nOne of the best ways to get fully into an End-Times chronicle is through the\ntechnique of foreshadowing. When constructing the story, add in elements that will\nrecur and people who will appear again and again so the players learn who they need\nto know and the sorts of things they need to do to bring the story to a great\nconclusion. Foreshadowing prepares the players and their characters for events yet\nto come, introducing themes and situations they’ll encounter several times before\nthe end. A smaller version of what will eventually play out is always cool. A character\nmight lose something she values, but she’ll realize that she lost it accomplishing\nsomething worthwhile. Foreshadowing need not be some huge occurrence, but it\nshould presage things to come.\nIn foreshadowing, things don’t need to be exactly the same. In fact, it’s better\nif the earlier occurrence is symbolic of later events rather than literal. Loss, betrayal,\nsorrow and death come to mind as appropriate topics, but you can easily foreshadow\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n280\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\ntriumph, fellowship and other more positive themes. Go ahead and give the\ncharacters a taste of what’s to come, then twist things a little so the foreshadowing\nisn’t too obvious — otherwise it gets boring and predictable.\nCLIMAX\nLIMAX\nLIMAX\nLIMAX\nLIMAX\nThis is the culmination of months of hard work for both you and your players,\nso you should make sure that the events that transpire during this time are worth it\nto the characters after all you’ve put them through. Whatever conclusion you plan\nto use, make sure it satisfies all your players on some level. It’s best to have a number\nof different events planned and allow the players to fit their characters into the ones\nthat make the most sense to them and provide them with the most sense of closure.\nThose who want to follow the story to its conclusion won’t appreciate a big fight in\nwhich they die nobly unless their questions are all answered first, while action\njunkies will resent long-winded winding down when they just want to go out in a\nblaze of glory.\nMake certain you know which kinds of scenarios your players prefer, then point\nthings in that direction and let events lead up to the finale they’re looking for. If the\nplayers are satisfied, if you’ve incorporated the elements that mean something to\neach character, and if the players feel that their characters have received a proper\nsend-off and been instrumental in the events surrounding the End Times, they’ll help\nyou bring the story to a rousing conclusion.\nSTAGECRAFT\nTAGECRAFT\nTAGECRAFT\nTAGECRAFT\nTAGECRAFT\nNever underestimate how valuable some elements of basic staging can be when\nsetting up a stirring scene for a chronicle. It’s important to make players feel as\ngrounded as possible during Laws of Judgment scenarios, especially where large\ndisasters and other epic story elements may already be putting additional pressure on\nsuspension of disbelief.\nAfter all, it requires a certain amount of concentration for players to stay in\ncharacter as well as view the play area and the other characters through that lens at\nall times. When you begin adding things like, “OK, um, when you look outside, you\nsee that, like, the city just fell over and caught fire,” it gets harder for even\nexperienced players to maintain their suspension of disbelief and react in character\nto the events unfolding around them.\nThe more you can make them feel as though they are really immersed in the\nscene, the less they have to concentrate on maintaining their sense of character and\nsetting — and the more they can focus on the events that are changing their world\nforever. What follows is a brief discussion of tips and techniques you can use to do\njust that.\nLOCATION\nOCATION\nOCATION\nOCATION\nOCATION\nChances are, you’re going to have to make do with the same location or set of\nlocations that you’ve been using the entire chronicle. With that in mind, what\nshould you do to evoke the proper sense of setting when meteors start falling, bombs\nstart dropping and other huge End-Times events shake up your in-game location?\nFortunately, the answers aren’t quite as difficult as you might think.\nFirst of all, before considering any changes, make sure you’re not going to\ndamage any part of the play area in the process. This sounds like common sense, but\nyou’d be surprised how many Storytellers decide they want to simulate a war zone and\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n281\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nwind up smashing a valuable piece of furniture as they do their best to “ruin things\nup a bit.” Once it’s established that nothing of value is wrecked, make sure that there\nare no obvious safety hazards — all the exits are clear, there are safe paths through\nall play areas and so on. Think about what the effect is that you wish to create and\nhow to move things around to best achieve that result.\nA bombed-out building, barricaded against outside attack? No problem. Flip\nover any furniture that can safely endure such treatment, move most of it to the edges\nof the room (draping it with dull gray or brown cloth is also good), affix a few black\nfabric scraps to make holes in the floor or ceiling, tape a few jagged “blocked by\nrubble” signs to any doors and windows you don’t want used, and cut some cardboard\nboxes into strips to make “boards” to cover the windows and doors. It looks close\nenough to pass in live-action, but it isn’t so sturdy that it will pose any danger if its\nabrupt removal is required. How about a natural glen deep in the forest? Bring in\nwhat plants you can that won’t be in danger from a gaming session, spread brown\ncloth or a simple brown rug on the ground (careful to make sure players don’t slip on\nit), drape furniture pieces with green cloth, then set up some incense with an earthy\nor floral scent, and you have a serviceable glen at your disposal.\nThe key to dressing a location for the End Times is moving, altering or covering\nas many familiar pieces in the location as possible. The more that has happened to\nchange the location in game, the more you want to try to change the out-of-game\nlocation from what the players are used to. Prominent description cards and signs are\nalso good, especially if they substitute for otherwise dangerous phenomena (such as\nobjects supposedly on fire), or they can be combined with a covering or alteration\nthat removes the original from the eyes of the players. Free of what they normally\nexpect to see in front of them, such descriptions become even more potent as the\nminds of the players do not have to try to overlay the description on top of existing\nfamiliar objects.\nLIGHTING\nIGHTING\nIGHTING\nIGHTING\nIGHTING A N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D S S S S SOUND\nOUND\nOUND\nOUND\nOUND\nThe lighting of your play area and the sounds heard during play are two of the\nbiggest and most immediate influences you can use to create the right atmosphere\nfor your game. The right music and lighting can put players in the mood you’re\nlooking for before they ever interact with another character. Likewise, choosing\npoor music and lighting can actively work against the atmosphere you’re trying to\ncreate. Most of the books of the Mind’s Eye Theatre line include some basic lighting\nand music tips, so those won’t be repeated here, but some specific pointers useful for\nJudgment chronicles are included.\nLighting\nAside from making sure there is always enough light so players can move about\nsafely, lighting’s most important rule for live-action gaming is quite simply to always\ndo your best to change the lighting from how it appears normally. If all you do is just\nmove around a couple of lamps or put in brighter (or darker) bulbs, those small\nchanges still do a lot to separate your game space and take it from something familiar\ninto a whole new place — namely, your in-game location. Likewise, unless you’re\ngoing for a Technocratic stronghold or sterile Pentex lab, avoid as much overhead\nfluorescent lighting as possible, even if it means bringing in floor lamps and the like.\nIt’s horribly modern, terribly unflattering and creates very little in the way of shadow\nand mystery for you to work with.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n282\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nWith all the catastrophes and civil unrest found in many Judgment scenarios,\nit’s worth looking into simulating blackouts and other disaster conditions. While\nflashlights tend to be too limited to light your main play areas (though characters\nmay need to carry them when traveling), many camping stores sell a variety of\ninexpensive electric emergency lanterns that can be used to light key spaces.\nProvidedextremecaution is used and open flame of any kind is never left unattended,\ncandles or actual hurricane lanterns can also be used to the same effect, reminding\nplayers just how precious light becomes when the electricity goes out and simple\ntools are all they have left. Flickering light is a wonderful way to indicate a building\nthat has sustained severe damage or possibly a fire of some kind. If individual light\nsources aren’t a viable option, white electric lights can be dimmed to simulate\n“emergency power,” while using soft yellow light can simulate diffuse candlelight.\nIf supernatural effects are altering the lighting conditions in the chronicle, do\nyour best to simulate them in game. If the red light of Anthelios is shining down day\nand night, put some red bulbs in lamps near windows or even in outside lights such\nas floodlights, porch lights or over a doorway. That way, whenever the players step\noutside or go near a window, you can simply click on the red light and help keep them\nimmersed in the world you’re creating. Green bulbs or glow sticks can be used to mark\nareas that are sick with Wyrm-taint, while blue light can be used to denote an\nUmbral area or a potential source of valuable Quintessence. Done properly, players\nwill come to understand your lighting scheme, and eventually you can even use it\nto give them quick visual cues about the nature of a scene or prop without needing\nconstant narration or “you see” interruptions.\nSound\nAfter lighting, sound becomes the quickest means of establishing mood and\nbuilding the atmosphere you desire. Perhaps the most important rule of sound design\nfor Mind’s Eye Theatre is that no matter how cool you might think it would be,\nnever let the sound in your scene overpower your players. It’s one thing if they know\nthey’ll be entering a rowdy club or running through a thunderstorm, but if the\nvolume is so loud that it’s painful or impossible to communicate vital out-of-game\ninformation (such as posing challenges), your audio environment is an obstacle, not\na benefit. Limit things to a dull roar at most, and don’t give anyone a hard time for\nasking you to turn it down. Likewise, don’t play anything distracting. If lyrics drag\nplayers out of game or sound effects trigger a player’s real-life phobia, that’s a problem\nand should be eliminated.\nOnce you’ve addressed those concerns, the first question to answer is whether\nthe sound will be in game (such as playing music that is supposedly the band playing\nat the bar), or out of game (such as “fight songs” or other mood music). In-game\nsounds reinforce the feeling of reality. Rather than just imagining a busy nightclub,\nhaving some pounding drum and bass playing lets the players actually experience\npart of the environment directly. Don’t only think of music when it comes to in-\ngame sounds, though. For example, many stores offer inexpensive “sounds of nature”\ndiscs that can help create the impression of raging storm, dark bayou or calm forest\nglade. Just make sure they are purely nature sounds and do not also include music or\nlyrics. Likewise, a disc of military sound effects such as gunshots and air raids can help\nsimulate urban warfare or a nearby battle raging, while a disc of creepier effects such\nas howls and demonic laughter can add an eerie, otherworldly tone. The only word\nof caution is to check the quality of sound effects CDs before you buy them if at all\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n283\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\npossible. While many are perfectly suitable for play, quite a few are very hokey\n(especially “spooky” ones), and they will only set players to snickering instead of\ninspiring the reaction you want. Listen before playing.\nOut-of-game sound is a bit easier to arrange, since it requires no in-game\njustification, but it is also easier to overdo. While playing a haunting track is a good\nway to create atmosphere, if the players always hear a swell of dramatic or ominous\nmusic every time they walk into a room, it will quickly lose all potency. It’s the\nmusical equivalent of the cliché crash of thunder following a dire announcement,\nand it will get just as old if used too often. Repetition is also an important pitfall to\navoid. We all have favorite albums and tracks for creating different moods, but most\nplayers have had at least one experience with a Storyteller who always puts on the\nsame CD of “fight music” or sets one particular track on repeat when preparing any\nkind of “scary” scene, to the point where it became a joke or even an annoyance. Vary\nyour selections as much as possible, or if you don’t have such variety, use what you\nhave wisely and let eloquent silence rule otherwise.\nSome Storytellers might even wish to experiment with a “blended” audio\narrangement with a pair stereos. One creates in-game sound effects like the sound\nof a thunderstorm or a battle, while another plays out-of-game mood music. This can\nbe tricky to set up, especially if you want to time certain sounds to play in a particular\norder on both machines, but the result can be a very rewarding complex, layered\naudio environment that establishes atmosphere for the game on several different\nlevels at once.\nIt is also worth noting that not every scene requires audio accompaniment to\nbegin with. This is especially true for games that maintain a sense of gritty reality and/\nor a strong grounding in the everyday. This is especially true for games with actual\nhuman protagonists such as Laws of the Reckoning and Laws of the Hunt, but it\nshould by no means be limited to those games either. After all, real life doesn’t have\na soundtrack, and while games are meant to be tales of heroes and anti-heroes,\nnothing says they need a tragically hip soundtrack for every moment. If the players\nare crying over a fallen comrade, there’s no need to put on sad music to reinforce the\nmood. In fact, it might seem intrusive to the scene — an audio suggestion they don’t\nneed. Likewise, an absence of “fight music” can help make combat seem much less\nlike an action movie and more like a real life-and-death struggle. This can be a\ndifficult matter to judge, but the best way to find the right balance is simply to observe\nwhat the players enjoy, ask them some questions and arrive at what works best for\nyour chronicle.\nTOOLS\nOOLS\nOOLS\nOOLS\nOOLS O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E T T T T TRADE\nRADE\nRADE\nRADE\nRADE\nAlmost as important as setting up the play area is what you will be presenting\nyour players with when your Narrator characters arrive on the scene. Likewise, as\nevents of your End-Time scenario unfold, you might wish to require players to carry\ncertain props or even adopt certain costuming elements to reflect the changes\noccurring in the game world. This section addresses how to handle such concerns\nwith a minimum of fuss (and a minimal budget).\nCostuming\nGiving members of a group distinctive costuming elements is an excellent way\nto indicate membership in some of the emerging social elements or new character\ntypes that are part of many Judgment scenarios. Whether it’s something relatively\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n284\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nminor, such as stipulating that all members of the Cult of Everlasting Doom wear\nblack scarves, or a larger dress code at work, such as having your Narrator characters\nall dress in military-style olive green to simulate the militia members who have\nplaced the city under martial law, distinctive costuming elements reinforce the\nimpression that events are having a real impact. These requirements also help\nplayers make potentially critical in-game distinctions without needing to ask out-of-\ngame questions. If they know that anyone wearing a red bandanna with a black skull\non it is part of the dreaded Blood of the All-Father gang, they don’t have to think\ntwice about what they’re seeing when your Narrators arrive wearing that gear.\nYou shouldn’t feel obligated to limit such costuming changes to the Narrator\ncharacters, either. If some of the players have formed a militia, for example, it only\nmakes sense in character that they would have some kind of uniform or insignia to\nidentify their own members and avoid friendly fire incidents. Encourage them to\ndevelop and wear armbands, badges, bandannas or even just a specific set of colors\nand stick with it as long as necessary. Likewise, if the events of your chronicle have\ngrown truly dire and civilization has collapsed, it’s reasonable to promote the notion\nof wearing dirty and ripped-up costuming to the players, to give them a better idea\nof what their characters are going through and create a strong visual impression of\nwhat has happened to them.\nBear in mind some basic guidelines on costuming, however. Most importantly,\nno matter how apocalyptic the scenario becomes, costuming should never smell so\nfoul, cover so little or just generally be so offensive as to cause out-of-game problems\nbetween players or with the authorities. Lastly, anything that is required should be\nsimple and inexpensive to obtain (hence the suggestion of things like bandannas or\nspecific color schemes). Requiring players or Narrators to spend serious money on\nthings like leather jackets or military uniforms is overly severe and often counter-\nproductive. If your troupe wishes to do something voluntarily, that’s one thing, but\ntrying to demand that everyone fork over a lot of cash just to keep playing\n“appropriately” is an abuse of power.\nProps\nAs with creating distinctive costume designs, carrying specific props can be a\ngreat way to indicate a number of things at a glance, particularly during the End\nTimes. If certain types of objects become extremely powerful, dangerous, coveted or\nscarce during your Judgment scenario, assign a specific prop or set of props to such\nitems and let the players know about it beforehand. That way, when your Narrator\ncharacter walks in bearing the item in question, you don’t have to interrupt play and\ntell your gathered troupe something like, “Oh yeah, by the way, see that thing he’s\ncarrying? It’s <really cool item X>, and you all want it.” They’ll automatically know\nit when they see it, and they won’t have to suddenly adjust their play or their\nperceptions to accommodate this new idea. Before long, even just having a few such\nprops scattered around the room will be cause for great conflict or discussion, and all\nwithout much fuss on the part of the Narrator.\nLikewise, on the opposite end of the scale, if an object or objects become\nextremely common during the End Times, it’s often best to give it a distinct prop or\nappearance as well. If all the Garou start carrying spears tipped with fallen stars, you\nmay wish to make item cards a different color or shape to differentiate them from the\nrest of the weapons being carried, as Garou will likely recognize their comrades as\nsoon as they see those weapons. This is not to say that every type of item must receive\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n285\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nits own variety of item card, merely those deemed most important to identify quickly,\nwhether due to rarity, ubiquity, power, et cetera.\nA lack of props can also be telling. If the Narrators are portraying refugees of a\nvampire slave camp, give them a few humble, ordinary items and little else. Finding\na downed opponent carrying only weapons and gear implies a trained military force\nat work (as opposed to civilian militia members, who tend to carry small personal\neffects with them). The possibilities are endless for clever Storytellers who are\nwilling to take some time to design prop sets for their Narrators. As with costuming,\nthe only major limitation on props is to avoid objects that are too expensive or time-\nconsuming unless players and Narrators explicitly consent to such items. If nothing\nelse, it’s a fact of gaming that props get lost, trashed or otherwise rendered useless\nduring sessions, no matter how careful players might be. Don’t make such mistakes\ncostly out of game.\nON N\n N\n N\n N\n NARRATOR\nARRATOR\nARRATOR\nARRATOR\nARRATOR C C C C CHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nMany of the powerful Narrator characters who appear in Laws of\nJudgment games require particular attention to accurately portray in Mind’s\nEye Theatre. Although it would be great if you could play every Narrator\ncharacter yourself, even most Storytellers haven’t quite mastered being in two\nor three places at once, so you’ll probably have to pick a trusted player or\nNarrator to play your crucial characters for you. Particularly if you haven’t used\nsuch a powerful being before, your choice of which player to portray her will\nlargely determine how she comes across to the other players, which is why it’s\ncrucial to pick that person carefully. It should, of course, be someone you know\nto be a good and versatile roleplayer.\nIf possible, try to pick someone who has played a wide range of characters\nin this group in the past. If you pick someone whose characters are always\ncalculating and devious, some of your players may just assume that their new\npersona is as well, and your game may be shot down before it starts by repeated\nassassination attempts based on this out-of-character information. If you do\nhave to pick someone who tends toward playing similar characters most of the\ntime, try to choose a person whose characters display a good amount of\ncharisma, as well as the ability to handle large problems efficiently. This will\nhopefully help counteract the “typecasting” downfall.\nNeedless to say, it’s also vital that your Narrator understands not only her\nrole and any background information that goes with it, but also when to use her\nvast power — and more importantly when not to use it. Don’t let her throw her\nweight around solely for the sake of doing so. Make sure also that she isn’t\nunconsciously favoring friends or former allies in her dealings with the players.\nThe best Narrator characters entertain the players and provide them with vital\ninformation or opportunities to take action, not solve every riddle or defeat\nevery enemy themselves. No matter how important a particular Narrator\ncharacter might be in the “official” timeline, your players and their characters\nare the heroes of your story. They should always take center stage. During the\nEnd Times, it’s vital that the players feel that their actions make a difference.\nIf not, then they’re little better than spectators to their own demise, and that’s\nno fun at all.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n286\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nSetting Artifacts\nSetting artifacts are perhaps the most important types of props to consider when\nrunning a Judgment scenario. They include mocked-up newspapers dealing with\nEnd-Times topics, altered photos of bizarre phenomena, homemade religious tracts\nproclaiming “THE END IS HERE,” doctored video clips showing strange creatures\non the loose, letters from important Narrator characters expressing dread over recent\nevents, strange stones simulating the meteors that have fallen from the sky, phony\nnews broadcasts inserted into music CDs that break in to announce some new\ndisaster and a reclusive hermit’s dusty old journal filled with scrawled sketches and\nprophecies. Such artifacts help bring home the reality of what the characters are\ngoing through in a way few pure descriptions can. The more such props you can show\nthem, play for them or actually put into their hands, the less fantastic events of the\nEnd Times become and the more players feel as though they are actually immersed\nin a world going through such immense changes.\nThis is not to say you should break yourself slaving to create such props for every\nsession, or that you should abandon descriptions as a means of conveying what is\noccurring. The more often you can join your descriptions of events with such\nconcrete props for the players to latch onto, though, the more it will reinforce the\nnotion of the world you are creating.\nMAKEUP\nAKEUP\nAKEUP\nAKEUP\nAKEUP\nProperly applying even a little bit of makeup is the final way to quickly\ngenerate a distinctive appearance for Narrator characters, as well as an easy way\nto keep track of character conditions such as sickness, injury or even some visible\nsupernatural effects. A pathetic refugee cowering in fear looks that much more\nhelpless and victimized with some added bruises or scratches or a light tracing of\nthe bones of the face with dark shading (which creates a hollow, starved appear-\nance). Unkempt hair and a few days’ worth of stubble for men can suggest those\nwho have been without the comforts of civilization for some time, while blacked\nout teeth and dirty hands make an instant beggar or scavenger. Perhaps certain\ngangs that have arisen in the fall of civilization give their members ritual scars or\ntattoos. A vivid depiction of these traits can help cement their identity in the\nminds of the players extremely quickly.\nIn addition to these basic steps, consider having players apply specific types of\nmakeup to indicate their current health or visible injuries they have suffered. This\nis most useful in scenarios featuring plagues or other conditions that are immediately\napparent, but it can be just as powerful if used for more mundane causes as well.\nHaving a visible record that allows you to watch other characters gradually\nsuccumbing to wounds or sickness or judge how badly hurt a Narrator character is\njust by looking at him can be a wonderful way to help underscore how desperate\nthings have become.\nDon’t forget the supernatural, either. As the mechanisms that have hidden the\nshadowy beings of the World of Darkness begin to fall away, requiring supernatural\ncreatures to wear particular kinds of makeup can show just how exposed they’ve\nbecome, as well as allowing players to recognize such creatures at a glance. As long\nas your makeup doesn’t disturb non-players or get you bounced from a game location,\nfeel free to pull out all the stops in depicting just how strange, desperate and different\nthe characters appear.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n287\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nTROUBLESHOOTING\nROUBLESHOOTING\nROUBLESHOOTING\nROUBLESHOOTING\nROUBLESHOOTING\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE E E E E EN D\nN D\nN D\nN D\nN D O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F THE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE W\n W\n W\n W\n WORLD\nORLD\nORLD\nORLD\nORLD\nOne of the joys of live action roleplaying is its spontaneity. No matter how well\nplanned and choreographed a story it, there are always ways for the players to change\nthe scenario due to some unexpected action or some unforeseen complication. Laws\nof Judgment scenarios are not exempt from this phenomenon. This section provides\na troubleshooting guide for Storytellers (and players) to help prepare for those times\nwhen a chronicle just doesn’t follow the plan. In addition, some suggestions for\ncontinuing a chronicle in the aftermath of the “end” provide help for Storytellers\nwho want to take their games to the next level.\nAfter all, your story doesn’t have to end just because the “world” does. Think\nof the final episode of a favorite television series. In all but a few cases, a few loose\nends are left dangling, waiting for someone to pick them up. When a beloved multi-\nvolume series of books reaches its last installment, some subplots remain unresolved\nor with open endings, ready for another round of books to begin with a new\ngeneration of characters.\nThis section of the chapter has applications for Storytellers and players. We\ndon’t need to emphasize the difference between player and “Storyteller-only”\nmaterial in this section. We expect players to realize that if they intend to enjoy a\nstory, they should avoid reading certain sections of this book or rely on their\nStorytellers to share appropriate sections with them.\nTOPICS\nOPICS\nOPICS\nOPICS\nOPICS FOR\nFOR\nFOR\nFOR\nFOR S S S S STORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nConsider the following topics a primer on common problem areas or questions\nabout “what comes next,” things to consider once you decide to take the chronicle\ndown the road to its end. Take the advice given here to heart or adapt it to your own\nparticular circumstances. Ends are almost always beginnings, after a fashion. What\nsort of chronicle will your End-Time story begin?\nWH Y\nH Y\nH Y\nH Y\nH Y E E E E EN D\nN D\nN D\nN D\nN D I I I I IT?\nWhy should you end your Mind’s Eye Theatre chronicle? This might seem a\ncurious question to ask at this point, but give it some serious thought. If the only\nreason you want to bring on the end of everything the players know is because you\nthink one of the end scenarios in this book is “neat,” you’re probably better off\nwaiting until a more solid justification presents itself. Otherwise, the players might\nresent you for ending the game on little more than a whim.\nOnce you have laid aside any such passing thoughts, however, there are several\nreasons to begin discussing the end of a chronicle. The first and foremost is simply\nbecause the chronicle isn’t fun and exciting anymore and you’re prepared to move\non to something else. Other reasons for ending a chronicle include providing a\nsatisfying ending to the overall story, or providing a clear break between an old\nchronicle and an entirely new one.\nThe first reason is the simplest. If your chronicle isn’t providing your troupe\nwith the enjoyment it once did, then it’s probably time to wrap things up and move\non. Chronicles sometimes flicker out slowly rather than ending cleanly, particularly\nif the Storyteller’s interest wanes. Rather than let your chronicle sputter out, you can\nhave some fun coming up with a spectacular ending for it and going out on top rather\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n288\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nthan just pulling the plug months later when the story is on life support. Ending a\nchronicle can actually invigorate your creativity, since it opens up so many new\npossibilities, and in the chronicle’s ending, you may find seeds of a newer, fresher and\nmore exciting story.\nAlthough it’s theoretically possible for chronicles to go on indefinitely, it’s\noften wise to consider an ending to your chronicle. Good stories include a beginning,\nmiddle and end, and an ending helps neatly tie together everything that came\npreviously in the chronicle, just like the ending of a good book, film or other story.\nTherefore, it’s a good idea to have your chronicle go out on a high note, when things\nare going well, rather than allowing it to run out of steam and die a slow death. If your\nending leaves players wanting more, you can always start a new chronicle as a sequel\nto the old — with the same characters or different ones — and take things in a new\ndirection, knowing that the previous chapter is closed.\nIn fact, ending a chronicle can provide a clean and clear break between that\nstory and the next Mind’s Eye Theatre chronicle your troupe creates. If the ending\nof the previous chronicle significantly changed the setting, then future stories will\nnecessarily be different and new characters will be faced with fresh challenges rather\nthan a rehash of the same old thing from your previous games.\nPLAYER\nLAYER\nLAYER\nLAYER\nLAYER K\n K K\n K KNOWLEDGE\nNOWLEDGE\nNOWLEDGE\nNOWLEDGE\nNOWLEDGE\nShould you tell your players that you are ending the chronicle or not? Some\nStorytellers might be concerned that informing the players that the chronicle is\nending might affect their actions and their enjoyment of the game. If they know that\nit’s all going to end soon, they might act differently than if they didn’t know. This\nis true, but good players can separate what they know from what their characters\nknow. A change in player behavior might also be exactly what you want for the\nending of your story.\nIt’s usually fairly hard to hide the fact that a chronicle is coming to an end,\nespecially if all the signs are there for the characters to see. Players are also likely to\nstruggle against the ending of the chronicle if they don’t know that it’s inevitable.\nWhile you might want the characters to struggle, putting the players in a situation\nwhere they feel like their struggles are pointless only frustrates them.\nSo it’s probably best to inform your players that you intend to end the chronicle\nand solicit their help in doing so. Find out what plot threads and loose ends the\nplayers want to see resolved before it’s all over. Ask if there are things that they want\ntheir characters to accomplish before the end. You can even get player input as to\nhow they want their characters written out of the story (or if they do at all). Given\nthe opportunity, many players are quite enthusiastic about an opportunity to be in\non the destruction of the world and a dramatic ending to the chronicle.\nGETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING E E E E EVERYONE\nVERYONE\nVERYONE\nVERYONE\nVERYONE I I I I INVOLVED\nNVOLVED\nNVOLVED\nNVOLVED\nNVOLVED\nYour players have devoted countless hours, months and even years to your\nchronicle. They’ve invested time and passion in their characters, meticulously\nbringing them to life (or “unlife”), developing their personalities, ambitions and\ncontacts from session to session. Now you want to bring the whole thing to an end,\nand you need everyone’s help to do it. The first step in bringing every character into\nthe scenario is to know your characters (and the people who play them). Who are\nthey? What are their goals? What can spark their interest or drive them into taking\npart in the story you plan to tell?\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n289\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nMovies and books rely on hooking their audience through advertising. The\npeople who go to see certain movies or read certain books do so because they enjoy\nthe subject matter, whether it’s action-adventure, gothic suspense, intrigue, horror\nor some other genre. They’ve seen the trailers for movies or read the cover text for\nbooks, and their interest has been piqued. The advertisements for those movies and\nbooks play to the entertainment desires of their audiences.\nThink of your chronicle as if it were a movie or a book. What kind of audience\nwill it attract (or has it attracted)? How can you make it seem attractive to those\noutside that audience?\nIf the majority of your characters enjoy action, whether engaging in combat\nagainst their enemies or racing against the clock to accomplish a goal, make certain\nyour pre-chronicle descriptions emphasize the action sequences. If you are the\nStoryteller for a live-action troupe that prefers intense roleplaying and only relies on\nchallenges as a last resort, talk up the drama of your scenario.\nThink about who your players are. By now, if you’ve been running an ongoing\nchronicle, you probably have a pretty good idea of what their interests are. Make\ncertain you have designed your “endgame” to appeal to your players first and\nforemost. Then gradually let them know that you have a memorable way to bring\nyour chronicle to an end.\nSome players might not want to see the chronicle (or their characters) end.\nThat’s natural, considering the enjoyment they’ve had as well as the time they’ve\ninvested in the game, and it deserves a thoughtful response. Talk with them and\nemphasize the importance of rounding out a good tale. Remind them that their\ncharacters’ personal plots will be accounted for, and suggest that they might want to\nhave a say in their characters’ destinies rather than have them disposed of by\nStoryteller fiat.\nFinally, if you make your players feel that they are a part of your chronicle, they\nwill become involved. Ask their advice on how they want you to work their\ncharacters into your plot and suggest some ways they can help you put the chronicle\ntogether. Enlist their aid in forming some of the subplots. Build some scenes around\ntheir characters and let them know you’re doing that. Find out what loose ends their\ncharacters have and let them know that they finally have the opportunity to\nconfront the primogen member who has been the bane of their undeath or confront\nthe Black Spiral Dancer who murdered their first pack leader or track down a cabal\nmember who defected to the Technocracy. Make the game mean something to your\ncharacters (and players), and they will be sure to be a part of it.\nENDING\nNDING\nNDING\nNDING\nNDING E E E E EVERYTHING\nVERYTHING\nVERYTHING\nVERYTHING\nVERYTHING E E E E EQUALLY\nQUALLY\nQUALLY\nQUALLY\nQUALLY\nHow important is it for your chronicle that all the characters experience the\nsame ending? Should you make allowances for characters who make different\nchoices and veer slightly off course from the end you have plotted? Does\neveryone have to die, be saved or escape to a different reality if that’s the general\nfate of the world?\nThis is a trick question. In fact, no two people (or characters) ever experience\nthe same thing in the same way. Even if your chronicle mandates the literal end of\nthe world and of all the characters who inhabit the world, each character will have\na different experience of that end. Some might meet their fate heroically, regretting\nnothing and casting themselves to their allotted destiny. Others might fight to the\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n290\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nlast against annihilation, while still others attempt to deny their own demise even\nas it is happening. The real question involves how you handle each character’s\nexperience of the same event.\nYour endgame might result in a world without supernaturals. Your original\nintentions for the final session might involve a cataclysmic event targeting only\nthose individuals with extra-human powers. On the surface, this seems like a\nfoolproof climax, one that affects all the characters in the same way but still allows\nfor individual reactions to the same general fate. In reality, some characters will\nundoubtedly discover a loophole in your scenario — either a way to flee to a realm\n(or another dimension) not affected by the final catastrophe or a way to regain their\nmortality and make themselves no longer a target.\nIf this happens, don’t concern yourself too much. Those characters have\neffectively written themselves out of your game and ended their own story, which\naccomplishes the same purpose. The freedom to modify the story is essential to live-\naction gaming and distinguishes it from other kinds of storytelling. In live-action\nplay, everyone is a storyteller to some degree, though consensus decrees that there\nwill be a single Storyteller (that’s you) to direct the plot. The cooperation of\neveryone, players and Storyteller, to tell a mutually satisfying story is the heart of\nlive-action play.\nIf some players choose to rewrite the script you have planned for their characters\nwithout changing the outcome of the story itself, give them your blessing and make\nsure they earn it every bit as much as everyone else.\nHANDLING\nANDLING\nANDLING\nANDLING\nANDLING A A A A AN T I\nN T I\nN T I\nN T I\nN T I- H\n- H\n- H\n- H\n- HEROIC\nEROIC\nEROIC\nEROIC\nEROIC C C C C CHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nFace it — not every character is a hero in the traditional sense of the word. If\nyour game requires the characters to sacrifice themselves in a dramatic battle to\ndecide the fate of the world, what do you do with characters who are not suited for\nsuch heroics? When confronted with the prospect of facing down the ultimate foe,\nwhether the long-prophesied rising of the Antediluvians, the full force of the\nWyrm’s wrath, an army of Fomorians from the Deep Dreaming or the unified army\nof the Technocracy, some characters will seek any means to avoid direct conflict. In\nfact, some might try to sell out the other characters to the enemy!\nIt’s a truism of live-action games many that many players enjoy playing\ncharacters who live by their wits rather than by their muscle. After all, live-\naction emphasizes social skills over brute force. Such characters prefer to rely\non getting others to do their dirty work or using the force of their personality\nor cunning to influence those around them so they do not have to fight. In an\nend scenario, such actions often seem inappropriate or frivolous, yet they can\nbe the essence of certain characters. How do you make certain that these\ncharacters have a vital part to play in your end scenario without forcing\ncharacters to act against their natures? Furthermore, how do you bring these\nplayers into the action or create a place for them in your story without losing\nthe rest of the group in the process?\nThere are a number of different approaches to this dilemma, which is a common\none regardless of a troupe’s size. Even in a small troupe of less than 10 players, one\nor two individuals generally prefer to play characters with little skill in direct\nconfrontation. Sometimes such characters are loners by nature, preferring to act on\ntheir own, either as information gatherers or spies.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n291\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nIn an end-of-the-world scenario, all the events should lead up to the\nfinal confrontation, whatever that is. Not all events, however, need to\ninvolve Physical Challenges or combat of any kind. Make certain that you\ninclude in your chronicle scenes that are geared for your less combat-\noriented characters. As long as you find ways to make every character feel she\nis playing a vital role in your chronicle, you can keep everyone involved. You\nmight even find that some of the characters least likely to sacrifice them-\nselves might end up leading the charge — or else meeting their end on their\nown terms, though no less dramatically.\nIf all else fails, and some characters simply do not want to participate in the end\nscenario you have planned, you can always provide them with an out — an escape\nthat only they know of and that they alone can take advantage of. While they might\nnot enjoy a hero’s fate, they will at least enjoy the story.\nTITANIC\nITANIC\nITANIC\nITANIC\nITANIC B\n B B\n B BATTLES\nATTLES\nATTLES\nATTLES\nATTLES\nNo matter how much you try to avoid it in the presentation of a scenario,\nchances are combat will creep in sooner or later, as characters settle personal grudges\nor defend themselves from enemies bent on preventing them from succeeding at\ntheir last desperate mission. And then there’s the question of characters caught up\nin scenarios involving huge battles or even all-out war. Combat can be a big\nheadache for Storytellers, especially on a large scale, but there’s no reason it must be\nthat way, particularly with sufficient preparation and a skilled Narrator or two acting\nas backup.\nGiven the nature of combat in Mind’s Eye Theatre, Storytellers are\nencouraged to handle most large battles with some sweeping overall descrip-\ntions. You can influence them with the outcome of several Mental or Social\nChallenges related to Leadership, Sovereign and the like if any characters have\nassumed command roles and are plotting strategy and tactics for their side. Then\nshift focus back to the characters and their immediate surroundings by playing\nout a few particularly dramatic moments that the characters get caught up in as\nthe battle goes on. (Such moments include rescuing a downed comrade, bracing\nfor a charge, rallying their troops, challenging the enemy leader and her dreaded\npersonal guards, retrieving a powerful lost treasure, et cetera.) You can even allot\na certain amount of time for each scene in order to keep the action flowing. (If\nthe characters don’t defeat the enemy leader in an hour, events conspire to sweep\nboth sides apart to fight another day, for instance.) In between each such\npersonal scene, give an update of the overall state of the battle as the characters\nwould see it, and you’ll quickly find the dreaded bogeyman of mass combat\nbecoming an exciting tool to portray the End Times.\nOnce you’ve brought the characters into the thick of battle, make sure the\naction is, well, action — always keep it moving, vivid and dramatic. Don’t get bogged\ndown in rules or waste time adjudicating combat with every single peon blocking the\nobjective. Let them dish out punishment on the enemy rank and file without too\nmuch trouble, then resume regular combat rules and difficulty when they confront\nthe real enemies or true obstacles involved in the scene. Doing so not only keeps the\nplayers pumped up and feeling as though their characters are the heroes of the tale,\nbut it also trims a lot of time off combat while allowing the players to feel as though\nthey are caught up in a grand battle of epic proportions.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n292\nLA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S\nA W S O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F J J J J JUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nUDGMENT\nTYING\nYING\nYING\nYING\nYING L L L L LOOSE\nOOSE\nOOSE\nOOSE\nOOSE E E E E ENDS\nNDS\nNDS\nNDS\nNDS\nOne thing that a good ending should provide is closure for the players in the\nstory, and their characters. This means generally tying up any loose plot threads from\nthe chronicle. As a result, players won’t always be left wondering what might have\nhappened, or what that subplot was really all about. It helps to wind down the\nchronicle and wrap things up neatly.\nThe trick is to keep from wrapping things up too neatly. You don’t want to tie\nup all the loose ends of your chronicle in a single story or, worse yet, in a single\nepilogue, since it can come off as rushed and artificial. If you have the luxury of\nwrapping up your chronicle in its own good time, address the various hanging plot\nthreads, one by one, until they’re all done. Take care along the way not to introduce\nany major new plot threads that won’t be resolved by the time the chronicle is done.\nThis way, things draw to a close naturally as the characters resolve their various\npersonal stories and the overall plot of the chronicle plays itself out.\nCONSTRUCTING\nONSTRUCTING\nONSTRUCTING\nONSTRUCTING\nONSTRUCTING A N\nA N\nA N\nA N\nA N A A A A AFTERMATH\nFTERMATH\nFTERMATH\nFTERMATH\nFTERMATH\nYou’ve ended the world, either through political, social, divine or natural\ncatastrophe. Have you destroyed the planet itself? If you haven’t, what’s left? In\nrunning an end of the World of Darkness scenario, you need to establish for yourself\njust how much of the world you are going to end. If you use a scenario that calls for\nnot only the end of supernatural life on Earth but the end of life in general (and\nperhaps even an end to the planet), then the answer to this question is relatively easy.\nWhat’s left is, well, not much.\nIf, however, you intend only to end the world as it has existed for your players,\nyou need to decide what sort of world is left. A scenario that removes only\nsupernaturals from the world will still leave behind a society of mortals. How will the\nabsence of supernatural beings change the world? Will mortals suddenly find\nthemselves free of many of the institutions that have constrained their freedom?\nWill they at last inhabit a world in which the police serve and protect all the people\ninstead of their Kindred masters? Will mortals inherit an earth devoid of Gnosis and\nopen to all sorts of opportunists? Will the human race grow less creative without\nchangelings to spur them on, or will they find themselves able to create without\ngoing through periods of stagnation? Will the departure of magic from the world\nguarantee a safe but dull society? Will the victorious Technocracy realize that\nwithout magic, science itself does not work properly?\nIf the Nephandi or other sinister forces have conquered the world, what sort of\ndepredations do they visit on mortals? Does the advent of the Sixth Age, the period\nof greatest darkness and evil on the Great Wheel, herald a dismal future for everyone?\nAsk yourself what happens after the chronicle is over. Does the world keep\ngoing without the characters, or does it grind to a halt after the final curtain drops?\nThis question is particularly important if you plan to continue using the same\n“world” as a background for later chronicles. If the world goes on without the\ncharacters, you need to know what kind of world remains and what kind of stories\nyou can tell in that “brave new world.”\nGenerally speaking, unless you and your players are very excited about the idea,\nlet them know in advance that you do not plan on running a “post-apocalyptic”\nchronicle. That way if you change your mind later on, you are always free to\ncontinue, but otherwise you can feel as though you are building toward a definite\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n293\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nending and not have to worry about building a new world for them to play in. Even\nif you do plan on continuing, make sure you’re still building toward a truly climactic\nevent; no matter what, the Time of Judgment should be a dramatic time of great\nchange and upheaval, not simply one more stop on the way to the next phase of the\nchronicle.\nPREVENTING\nREVENTING\nREVENTING\nREVENTING\nREVENTING T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E E E E E EN D\nN D\nN D\nN D\nN D\nIn many games, players (and their characters) are meant to triumph if they take\nthe correct actions and avoid the pitfalls of the scenario. What happens in an end-\nof-the-world scenario if characters manage to avert the planned disaster?\nThe answer to this question is simple. Let them “win.”\nThe process behind the answer is not so simple. If the characters manage to\ndefeat the scenario, whether you hit the world with a killer asteroid, shatter the\nGauntlet between the physical world and the Umbra or raise legions of zombies\naround the world, then give them the reward that comes with clever planning, hard\nfighting and noble sacrifice.\nBefore you do, however, make certain that the players have, in fact, truly earned\ntheir victory. Regardless of whether they win or succumb to your endgame, the\ncharacters should feel as if they’ve been through a hard fight. The players, as well,\nshould feel that you taxed all their abilities, stretched their roleplaying talents to the\nmaximum and drawn every ounce of clever thinking from them that you could in\norder to bring about that rarest of rarities — victory against impossible odds.\nKeep in mind that clever play and convincing roleplaying should always be\nrewarded. Just because you intend to bring a long-running chronicle to an earth-\nshattering close doesn’t mean that everything will go according to plan. Players have\na knack for finding loopholes in the plot, taking advantage of every weakness and\nfinding hidden strengths within their characters. If they manage to put it all together\nand beat your scenario, tell the story the way they play it.\nNo one likes coming up with a clever solution to an unbeatable puzzle and\nhaving it declared meaningless, so don’t overrule your players’ actions simply\nbecause the story doesn’t allow for the characters to win. The story does allow for the\nplayers to win if they can. This is what live-action roleplaying is all about.\nIn the event that the players do find a way to save the world or avert disaster,\nmake sure you have a suitable ending for victory as well as defeat — one that leaves\nthe characters with the feeling that they have overcome overwhelming opposition\nto emerge triumphant. Then, wrap up the game and plan your next chronicle —\neither in the changed world your players have created or wherever your imagination\ndecides to lead you.\nAFTERMATH\nFTERMATH\nFTERMATH\nFTERMATH\nFTERMATH:\nBRINGING\nRINGING\nRINGING\nRINGING\nRINGING C C C C CLOSURE\nLOSURE\nLOSURE\nLOSURE\nLOSURE T O\nT O\nT O\nT O\nT O Y Y Y Y YOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR\nOUR S S S S SCENARIO\nCENARIO\nCENARIO\nCENARIO\nCENARIO\nYou’ve just run the climactic scene of your chronicle.

How do you\nand your players handle the fact that the imaginary world populated with characters\ncreated by you and your friends no longer exists — or, if it does, is radically changed?\nThis section deals with coping with the aftermath of an End-Times chronicle\nin ways that will solidify the game in your mind and provide lots of satisfying\nmemories for everyone concerned.\nEPILOGUE\nPILOGUE\nPILOGUE\nPILOGUE\nPILOGUE\nYou may wish to include an epilogue at the very end of your chronicle. It comes\nafter the climax of the ending and provides a sort of “cool-down” from the\nexcitement and action that led up to the end. An epilogue serves to wrap up any\nremaining loose ends, and it shows the players the results of the ending if few or none\nof them are left to see it in character.\nGenerally, an epilogue should be relatively brief. With the story over, all that’s\nleft is to wrap up a few things. You might even wish to simply describe the epilogue\nto the players, although it’s best if any surviving characters are at least indirectly\ninvolved and they can participate in it.\nA P\nA P\nA P\nA P\nA POSTMORTEM\nOSTMORTEM\nOSTMORTEM\nOSTMORTEM\nOSTMORTEM WITH\nWITH\nWITH\nWITH\nWITH M\n M\n M\n M\n MEANING\nEANING\nEANING\nEANING\nEANING\nMany live-action games that take place at roleplaying conventions and involve\na few days of intensive interaction followed by a rousing conclusion hold “wrap-up”\nsessions in which players and Storytellers gather to discuss the high points and low\npoints of the game. Storytellers review the various plots for everyone, so that players\nwhose characters were involved in only part of the overall story receive a recounting\nof the big picture. Players share their favorite moments during the game and reveal\nthe secrets about their characters that they have spent all weekend assiduously\nhiding from other players.\nRegular live-action troupes often hold such post-mortem sessions after a\nchronicle ends and before a new one begins. Some do so at regular intervals after\nthe players have passed significant milestones in the story arc. In an End-Time\nscenario, a special post-mortem gathering is not only advised, it’s critical to the\nsense of closure players and Storytellers need to avoid the feeling that they’ve left\nsomething undone.\nMeet with your players as a group. Go over the actions of your game and\nexplain why certain things happened as they did. If players sacrificed their\ncharacters, let them know what their characters’ deaths achieved so they don’t feel\nthat what they did was for nothing. Ask players to share their memorable\nmoments, not only from your last scenario, but from the beginning of your\nchronicle or any other point along its length. If you know a player loves a particular\nstory, tell it to the group (or let the player tell it himself). The stories are what you\nwere working for all along — share them!\nIf you have the time and the means, take a vote and give out awards or\ncertificates for memorable actions. Have your players suggest contenders for Most\nPopular Character, Character Most Loved to Hate, Biggest Villain, Sneakiest\nCharacter, Most Selfless Character, Greatest Opportunist and other possible awards.\nGo ahead with this only if you plan on recognizing every character for something,\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n\n\n295\nCHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER\nHAPTER T\n T T\n T TE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nE N\nhowever. While you shouldn’t diminish the meaning of the awards by obviously\nhanding out one to everyone, nobody should be left without a trophy or mention at\nthe end of the night. Every player should be made to feel as though he was part of\nsomething special.\nIN M\n M\n M\n M\n MEMORIAM\nEMORIAM\nEMORIAM\nEMORIAM\nEMORIAM\nAnother possibility is to bring the players together one final time as their\ncharacters, living or dead, and have the surviving characters hold a “eulogy” for their\nfallen allies and enemies. Allow those players whose characters are being eulogized\nto reprise their characters in flashback scenes for one last farewell, perhaps even\ndramatize their last moments that no one else survived to see. Have players\nsummarize their characters for the group, speaking of their feelings toward their\ncharacters and revealing the inner motivations and driving forces behind the\nindividuals they portrayed.\nIf you want to go even more in-depth, you can allow characters to enact some\nscenes that they wanted to take place but never did. Or you can have each player,\nin character, interact non-violently with her greatest rival. Ask each player to state\nwhat she would want others to remember about her character and have her relate\nwhat her memories are of the other characters. This type of memorial session allows\nplayers to provide their story and their characters with a formal closing and a\nmemorable farewell.\nWhen that has ended, take a bit of a refreshment break and then hold a\nquestion-and-answer session, in which all the players can finally get the answers they\nnever learned or gleefully reveal the secrets they managed to keep throughout the\nentire game. (“By the way, dude, you remember when the prince called a Blood Hunt\non you that one night — it was all me.”) Especially with chronicles that have lasted\nfor years, there’s bound to be plenty of dark corners that the players never got a\nchance to fully explore, but always wondered about. Well, now’s the time to shed\nsome light on them! Most players adore these behind-the-scenes wrap-up sessions,\nas they show the big picture you’ve been working so hard to create over the course\nof the chronicle. Naturally, it also allows you as a Storyteller to receive a little well-\nearned praise for all your attention to intrigue and detail.\nJust make sure that all such post-mortem conversations and revelations are\ndone with good humor as opposed to allowing players to indulge in pure selfish\ngloating, and it should be a memorable conclusion to your chronicle that they will\nremember for a long time to come.\nUNDISCOVERED\nNDISCOVERED\nNDISCOVERED\nNDISCOVERED\nNDISCOVERED C C C C COUNTRY\nOUNTRY\nOUNTRY\nOUNTRY\nOUNTRY\nAfter everything is wrapped up, some players will immediately want to know\nwhat the next game will be, when they can start making characters and so on. Take\nsuch inquiries as a compliment. They enjoyed your story and are looking forward to\nthe next creative endeavor you put together. Don’t be afraid to ask them politely for\na little space, though. Ending a game is often an immensely draining experience even\nif it goes well, and you’re generally better off giving yourself at least a week or two\noff, minimum, before you start discussing the next game. Enjoy the glow of a job well\ndone, catch up on that work or reading or sleep you’ve been missing, and otherwise\ntake some time to catch your breath and relax.\nAs hard as it might be, try to fend off any suggestions for returning to the same\nstory or characters, at least in the near future.

It might be hard to let\ngo of the characters and stories at first, but running right back in is seldom a good idea\neither. Insist that the chronicle has reached its ending, and leave it at that. If such\nideas keep coming back to you months later, you might have a promising lead on how\nto re-visit the chronicle, but for now, just let it be.\nAfter all, the possibilities are endless — give yourself and your players time to\nfind the next avenue you wish to explore together.\nIt’s your world.\nEnjoy.\nON E\nN E\nN E\nN E\nN E L L L L LA S T\nA S T\nA S T\nA S T\nA S T S S S S SNAPSHOT\nNAPSHOT\nNAPSHOT\nNAPSHOT\nNAPSHOT\nAsk your players to show up in full costume and makeup for the final\nsession or for the post-mortem. Bring a camera and take pictures of important\nscenes either as they happen, or perhaps by re-staging them during a wrap-\nup session. Many players will want character shots or a picture of their\ncoterie/pack/motley as well, and at least one or two big group shots are a great\nidea too. Make copies of the pictures and present them to the players as\nkeepsakes. (Don’t be afraid to ask players to help fund this endeavor, though,\nas it can get expensive.)\nAnother possible idea might be to create a notebook for each player that\ncontains a summary of your endgame, a list of all the players and their\ncharacters (and the fates of those characters). Include some blank sheets for\nplayers to sign as their characters, including brief messages if they wish.\nAssemble a literary and artistic pastiche commemorating the chronicle. Ask\nplayers to contribute poetry, drawings or stories so that, when bound together\nand copied, each player will have a permanent memory book of the game.\nrobert wheeler (order #15253)\n6\n"
