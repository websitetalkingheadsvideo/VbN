And for \nthose of you who are new to the publication, let me take a second to acquaint you \nwith just what you’ve got here. \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gaps in your \nWhite Wolf LARP environment. We offer rules for new character types, original \nstorylines to work into your chronicles, guides for keeping your games under control \nand running smoothly and rules updates you won’t find in any other Mind’s Eye \nrelease. Plus, you’ll find answers to the questions that have plagued your chronicles \n(Why are so m n y  Changeling birthrights changedinto Merits and Flaws in The Shining \nHost!), original World of Darkness fiction and columns from those who’ve been \nthere (wherever there is) and survived to tell the tale. The Journal is packed with \nfacts and guides that expand upon what’s published in the MET books. \nIn this issue, we have a chat with the spokespeople of two of the largest live- \naction roleplaying organizations in the world, look into some of the legwork that goes \ninto setting up a successful, long-running LARP chronicle and delve into the \nparticulars of creating Nunnehi changelings for MET’S The Shining Host. And \nthat’s just a sample of what’s in store for you here. We’ve also got an Oblivion \nadventure that will rock your whole shadowed world, a look at how MET has \nchanged since its inception and more. \nIn future issues, we’ll look into one of Atlanta’s own oldest and largest indepen- \ndent LARP organizations, ways to keep problem players under control, a word or two \non the state of MET from Cynthia Summers (the Mind’s Eye developer here) and \nanything else you might need to round out your live-action chronicle. \nAnd you can help make the Journal even better. Send us letters on your \nopinions about the state of live-action roleplaying today. Send us questions about \nthe features and rules you see here and about the broken rules you might come across \nin different MET publications. Send us horror stories of games gone wrong and how \nyour players’ characters fixed them. We’re interested in all aspects of live-action \nroleplaying, and we want to know what you think. \nStick around.

Sort of a cross \nbetween a round-table discussion and a WWF cage-match, this is the place to hash out \nMET issues rangingfiom licensing to rule-brokenness to LARPingstyle . Give me your \nopinions, respond to opinions you see here, bnbe me just to get your name in print, \nwhatewer.]ustkeepitrelativelyclean, andstay offthe badsideofthepeople youdisagree \nwith. After all, that keen-edged rapier wit is designed for each others’ arguments and \nopinions, not for each others’ personal liwes. \nI \nAs this hotbed of conflict and contention (just kidding) opens, we find letters \non all manner of subjects. Live-action gamers are at no loss for words when it \ncomes to their opinions over LARPing (as many of you can easily attest). This \nfirst letter deals with general concerns one finds in any LARP situation, and it \nboils down to mechanics versus gameplay. \nFirst of all, [rules] simplicity is no guarantee of quality. The support of \nroleplaying over mechanics has always been, in my opinion, in the hands of the \nplayers more than anything. The Storytellers in a respective LARP can certainly \nassist or interfere but this is usually secondary. \nI think [creating a character to exploit the rules or benefit from a loophole in the \nrules] makes for odd reasoning to play at all. As a good friend of mine has said a number \nof times, “Why play something you don’t enjoy?” Some people get enjoyment from \ntackling the big boys in-game, from arbitrating odd and complicated rules or from \nsimply playing a Vampire character they know will never be prince. The point is to \ndesign a character that will be fun to play and let the rules concerns come second. \n- \nScott McDaniel \nAtlanta Interactive Theater Storyteller \nThis next letter deals with the issue of crossover games and how well LARPs \nare suited to deal with the unique problems inherent to them. \nI have been playing WoD games for upward of five years, give or take, and after all \nthat time, I’ve finally come to the conclusion that there is not asingle element about one \nline that prevents crossover. In fact, I think that all of the lines belong in the WoD and \ncan be treated as equally important. The only line that has ANY trouble with crossovers \nis Vampire (including Kuei-jin) because of the whole ‘‘I can only play at night” problem. \nThe other four (Werewolf, Mage, Wraith andchangeling) work perfectly well together. \nI am currently running a chronicle that includes everything in it. The only \nrestriction that I put on the players was that they had to play something that could \ndo stuff both during the day and the night. Outside of that, I let them play anything. \nEverything runs together pretty smoothly, too. I’m not going to lie and say it’s easy, \nbut it’s not particularly difficult either. It’s just a matter of taking a little extra time \nand research to put the pieces together. I haven’t had to invoke the Golden Rule \neither, at least not in order to have one “race” be able to function with another. \nSheer “gunslinging” ability isn’t all that goes into a game being balanced. Most \nstarting Garou could wipe the floorwith most startingvampires. But that is definitely \na minor exaggeration on the truth. Not all Garou are Get of Fenris/ Red Talon type \ncharacters. Not all Garou have incredible strength in Crinos. Not all vampires are \n[wusses] when it comes to combat (the Brujah are a prime example, although the \nGangrel and Nosferatu also fight well), and so it is possible, with some Potence, and \n"

      "text": "maybe a little Celerity or Fortitude, for a vampire to best a Garou in combat. However, \na clever vampire will easily be able to overcome the ferocious Garou with a well \nplaced use of Dominate or Presence, make him go mad and attack his own pack with \nDementation or something equally heinous. Vampires, unlike most Garou, don’t rely \nsolely on power to win their victories. They have more subtle ways of doing things. \nA similar argument could be made for mages vs. vampires. (Provided a live- \naction Mage system even existed, of course.) The mage is actually at a slight \ndisadvantage against other supernaturals in that he can’t just do shit and not suffer \nany immediate consequences. Paradox should keep him in line enough (if he’s smart \nanyway) so that the playing field is level when he deals with other supematurals. Just \nbecause the mage can shape reality doesn’t mean he’s invulnerable, or that his mind \nis made of iron. The vampire still has the options of Dominate and Presence at his \ndisposal. Plus, this time the vampire will potentially be stronger than the mage is \n(and he won’t have to worry about that mage regenerating damage, either). \nSo, in my opinion, the systems [for tabletop and, by extension, live-action] are \nbalanced. Each character type has its own strengths and its own weaknesses. Starting \nmages are not gods, vampires are not wusses, and, despite first-edition rules, \nwerewolves are not indestructible. \nAll that being said, why not cross the genres over? \n- \nGregory Plunkett \nNot written in direct response to Gregory’s letter, though certainly in the \nsame vein, comes this letter from a former Athens by Night LARP Storyteller. \nAlright, here’s my opinion of different participants in a WoD LARP. First off, \ngiven enough time, rules can be created [to translate] any tabletop system. The \nlimitations I see present between the different inhabitants of the WoD aren’t \nmechanical at all. The limitation is also not your ability to get all of these inhabitants \nin one area. Anybody could do so if they created a background rich enough. The \nlimitation, which I think is fundamental, is the fact that once you’ve got all of these \ngroups in the room together with their rules that are easy to use and understandable, \nwhat do you, as a Storyteller, do with them? \nI’m not going to try and say what they “should do” because players always have \na knack for explaining why they’re the exception. However, I’m going to watch as \nthe Garou travel into the Umbra to wage their wars. I’m going to see the mages \ndisappear. The wraiths will never appear except in rooms where others won’t be \npresent. Changelings will do whatever it is changelings do. Vampires will try to \nfigure out who’s in charge and go from there for the rest of eternity. \nEssentially, to do any of the inhabitants justice the game must be focused to \nthem. The Garou deserve their own game for the Umbra alone. Mages deserve their \nown game because the ST’s need to spend their time worrying about Paradox. \nVampires deserve their own game because they’re prone to creating international \neffects. That’s the limitation of these different worlds. They’re so interesting, so \nintricate, so demanding that as an ST trying to create a cohesive game, you \naccomplish nothing by spreading the population out.. .. \nThe writer then went on, a bit later, to expound upon the phenomenon of \nLARPers forming into cliques that appear in games as groups of related characters. \n. . .While I try to make my associations in game as much as I can, I would be lying \nif I said some outside consideration isn’t given. In truth, it doesn’t hurt anything for \nme. Sure, I might suddenly just be ‘buddying’ up to somebody but I think that has a \nreal world image to it. Sometimes, you just start naturally close to somebody. This \nbehavior [in LARPers] certainly shouldn’t be demonized. \n"

      "text": "As to ‘groups’ of people, well it’s a game and you want to enjoy yourself. \nSometimes you just want to be with your friends and you use the game as a social \noutlet. I’ve got no problem with that. Way back in the day I played this game simply \nsoIcouldspendsome timewithmy friendsandrelax. It’snotso badifamassofpeople \ncome in together, knowing and working with each other. It certainly doesn’t detract \nfrommy rp’ing experience. In the end, I’m not going to go out of my way to draw such \na black and white line between oog and ig. Personally, it’s something that happens \nin LARPs where people are doing their best to have a good time. \n- \nRyan Vila \nAthens by Night Storyteller \nReturning to the idea of character versus wad-0-Traits, Phil Clippinger had \nthis (among other notable bits) to say... \nKnowing too much about the powers of other characters is the fundamental \ncause of Live-Action-MUDding. (I cannot say that I am wholly innocent of said \ncrime, but for about a year I’ve been reformed.) The whole purpose of “Role Playing” \nis that you, as a player, adopt a character’s “role”, and “play” through it in the story. \nWhat defines your character? Is it the fact that he was raised in the slums of \nMontreal by a submissive, weak mother and a father who beat her to alleviate his \nfrustrations from working a dead-end minimum wage job, up until the point that a \nPander embraced you to see how you would turn out? Did he go on to join the Sabbat \nof Montreal, but find that their sadistic, self-loathing ways were only grotesque \nfacsimiles of his mortal father’s actions? When he left them all behind and started \nto wander the United states, did they hunt him? Why did he come to [the city he now \ncalls home]? What are his feelings about the Camarilla? Is he here in hopes that the \nMontreal Sect won’t look for him in a Cam town, or is he inclined to follow the ideals \nof the Camarilla? Or does he see the hypocrisy in this system as well? Are these the \nkind of qualities that define your character? Or is it the fact that he was ghouled so \nhe has Cekrity, Potence and Fortitude, and then he got Embraced so now he’s got \naccess to Thaumaturgy, Dominate, and Auspex, and even gets his generation for free? \nIf you’ve got a good character, you shouldn’t have to worry about your Traits and \nAbilities. And you certainly shouldn’t worry about the Traits and Abilities of others. \nOk, you saw Joe Brujah kick some ass at the last gather. You’re not going to get into \nit with him. That’s fair. Steve and Dave Brujah kicked some ass too. Maybe you \nshouldn’t [mess] with the Brujah on a whole. You don’t know exactly what they \nhave the potential to do, you just know what you’ve seen them do. \n- \nPhil ClippingeI \n"

Ergo, he’s going to stay where it’s safe. \nNotes: The Twink is motivated by two forces: the desire to avoid character death at \nall costs and the desire to let everyone else know exactly how butch his character really is. \nAs a result, you will often see the Twink using Disciplines left, right and center to do things \nlike open doors, rearrange geraniums and the like.

Screw it, I kill you anyway. \nConcept: To make like Ozymandias, only without all that boring looking on works and \ndespairing stuff, you know? \nAppearance: The Chainsaw exists to kill, and the sheer number of weapons draped off \nhis costume (usually lifted from Clint Eastwood by way of post-Highlander Christopher \nLambert) makes this abundantly clear. Broad-brimmed hats are de rigeur. A rare subspecies \nprefers to use no weapons at all, relying instead on innate powers. Such creatures are thought \nto be the result of Chainsaw-Twink crossbreeding, though reliable reports indicate that \neach partner tries to kill the other immediately after the consummation of such a union. \nNatural Habitat: Chainsaws can be found at the entrance to most games, mentally tallying \nnew players for later identification and extermination. Chainsaws can also be found at the front \nof most Blood Hunts and leading the list of converts during the inevitable “Sabbat infiltration” \nplotline, believing that getting whacked on the head with a shovel grants them a license to kill. \nNotes: The Chainsaw is not evil, merely misguided; he thinks that racking up a body \ncount is a form of roleplaying. He sees himself as the Darwinian scourge of the LARP, \nweeding out the weak so that stronger character concepts may survive and prosper. He fills \nthe role of.. . oh, who am I trying to kid with this crap! He’s a weenie.

This is \nperfectly understandable for someone at his first game, but this guy’s been doing it for three- \nand-a-half years. \nAppearance: A cape. The Terrified Newbie always wears a cape. Hopefully he’s \nwearing something else underneath it. \nNatural Habitat: The Terrified Newbie rotates on a seasonal cycle (read: every 15 \nminutes) between the check-in table and the deepest, darkest comer of the game site, there \nto quiver in helpless confusion. Occasionally, this lemming-like journey takes the Terrified \nNewbie through actual gameplay, which inevitably screeches to a halt as aresult ofquestions \nlike “Which one is rock, again?” \nNotes: The Terrified Newbie has no actual interest in playing, merely in attaching himself, \nlamprey-like, to some kind soul foolish enough to offer a few minutes to help out. What the \nTerrified Newbie craves is attention, and he will go so far as to self-trepanate to avoid actually \nlearning what’s going on (and thus being forced to do something silly like, oh, I dunno, play). \nQuote: So I based my character -she’s \na Malkavian, you know - \non Elmo.

Unfortunately, most \nseem compelled to use accents straight out of The House at Pooh Comer when doing so. \nNotes: The Cute Nutball often bases her character around the regression motif, i.e., \n‘‘I was Embraced while watching Rugrats” or “I may have been Embraced at age 38, but I \nreally wanted it to happen while I was watching Rugrats.” Many of them are excellent \nroleplayers within a very limited range. The problem is that Cute Nutballs tend to travel in \npacks (or perhaps to generate spontaneously), meaning that the incautious LARPer is liable \nto find himself knee-deep in what looks like vampiric daycare. \nAddendum: The occasional Cute Nutball eschews the pajamas look for schoolgirl \noutfits.

It’s just that \noccasionally, one catches sight of a power or \nMerit or some other neat gadget that another \ncharacter has that is completely new to him. \nAccording to scientists, this triggers a physiologi- \ncal reaction that causes the M/D P to either swim \nup the Willamette River and spawn or to start \nstalking the local Storyteller in hopes of comer- \ning her and begging permission to add the new \npower to his character sheet as soon as possible. \nUnder most circumstances, the Story- \nteller thus confronted sensibly avoids the \ndecision and sends the M/D P off with a bland “If the other Storyteller says it’s OK or some \nsuch. The fatal mistake the Storyteller makes in this instance is assuming that her \ncounterpart is going to show some sort of common sense and bounce the M/D P on his ear \na few times to see if any brain cells shake loose. Unfortunately, this is when the M/D P’s \ncunning survival mechanism kicks in. \nInstead of going up to the second Storyteller with “Well, Anne blew me off when I \nasked for Master-Class Temporis,” he sneaks up on his prey with “Anne said it was OK for \nme to have Master-Class Temporis if you said it was OK.” In many cases, the helpless second \nStoryteller is taken by surprise and gives assent, which concludes the cycle for the M/D P. \nHe scurries back into play, and it’s left to the Storytellers to figure out what the hell just \nhappened the next time the entire game rewinds six hours. \nNotes: All conversations with M/D Ps should include the word “no” at least three times \nper sentence, more if possible. \nT H E  SCAMMER \nQuote: So, want tog0 back to my place after the gum is w e r d  talk about ourchmacters’ refahhip? \nConcept: I’m a- what clan do those three women in the black dresses play?Toreador? \nOK, I’m a Toreador. \nAppearance: The Scammer often wears fake fangs, dark sunglasses, a white poofy shirt, \npirate boots and a vest of some sort - \nunless the women in the game have demonstrated \na preference for some other sort of raiment.

The Mind’s \nEye Theatre game line has changed quite a bit \nower the years, and it continues to change as new \nthe Hunt: a look at the most current versions of rules for Mind’s Eye Theatre and how they \napply to all of the game lines. This article isn’t an attempt to address specific cases - \nthat’s \nthepurviewoftheFAQsection-but itdoestalkaboutsomechanges thathavefar-reaching \neffects on most, if not all, of the books for Mind’s Eye Theatre. If you’ve got this article and \na Mind’s Eye Theatre book, you should be playing the mmt current version of the game! \nC H A L L E N ~ E S  \nAs described in the various Mind’s Eye Theatre books, a challenge involves a \nsimple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two or more people. The victor wins \nthe challenge and accomplishes his desired result; the loser fails in his attempt. \nIn the event of a tie, challengers check their appropriate Traits. Thus, in a Mental \nChallenge, both participants check their number of Mental Traits, and the person with \nthe most Traits wins. Use the current number ofTraits! As a playerexpendsTraits (losing \nthem in challenges or activating powers), the character tires out, runs out of confidence \nand gets fatigued -eventually, even the most powerful character wears out. \nIf both sides have the same number of Traits, the win goes to the defender, but \nboth parties lose the Traits they bid. \nRETESTS \nSeveral different factors allow for retests, Abilities, overbids and special powers \namong them. In general, though, retests all have the same effect. \nA retest can be called only when a player loses a test - \nif you win a test in \ncombat, you cannot use your Brawl Ability to retest and do the same thing again, for \nexample, even when supernaturally compelled. When a retest is called, you lose the \nTrait(s) you bid in the initial test (mark them off immediately) and then perform a \nnew test. If you lose the retest, you still lose the challenge. If you win, you still lose \nthe initial Trait(s) you bid, but you win the challenge. In a tie, compare Traits as \nnormal, but remember that you lose the Trait(s) you bid for the initial test. \nA retest called by use of an Ability expends the Ability automatically, regardless \nof the outcome of the test; if you fail to punch someone and call for a retest with Brawl, \nthe Brawl Ability is expended automatically. Conversely, a retest called with an \noverbid does not expend the overbid Trait automatically - \nyou only lose the overbid \nTrait if you lose the test. Note that calling an overbid requires only one Trait, even if \nyou are injured or were otherwise forced to bid more than one Trait on the initial test. \n"

InacasewhereinanAhility- \nbased retest is called by your opponent, you may cancel his retest automatically if you have \nat least two more levels in that Ability than he does. Thus, if your opponent calls for a Brawl \nretest in combat but has only one level of Brawl Ability, you may expend a level of the Brawl \nAbility to cancel his retest completely if you have at least Brawlx 3. If you and your opponent \nhave the same amount of current Brawl Ability, or if your current Ability is less rhan your \nopponent’s (ornottwolevelshigher), thenyoucannotcance1hisretest;youmustwaitforthe \nopponent’s retest and then expend a level of your Ability for a retest of your own (if the \nopponent’s retest succeeds). Thus, with high levels of Ability, you can completely prevent a \nless skilled opponent from turning the tables on you. However, if you are evenly matched, \nthere is always achance for luck and a little bit of skill to intervene. Note that a cancellation \nmaybedoneonlywithalike Abilityorpower: IfanopponentcallsforaretestwithBrawl, you \nmust cancel it with your own Brawl or Meke Ability, not with the Merit: Luck (for instance). \nA given source may be used as a retest only once on any particular challenge. \nA character with Brawl x 3 cannot use Brawl multiple times for retests on a single \nchallenge, but he could use Brawl followed by Luck. Certain powers end a challenge \nautomatically, and no retests may be called after the use of such powers. \nMASS COMBAT \nMass combat involves multiple attackers assaultingone defender. Insuchcases, \nthe first task is to determine who’s attacking whom and how. The original rules for \nmass combat, revised and elaborated here, make mass combat much more dangerous. \nAmass attackoccurswhenup tofive peopleassault one targetwithsimilarmethcds. \nThus, if five people all attack one vampire (using swords, stakes and torches), they \nconduct one mass challenge. However, if different forms of assault were used (a shotgun \nfromone attacker but aspell from another) then eachdifferent form of attack- Physical, \nMental or Social - \nwould be handled as a separate challenge or mass challenge. \nIn a mass challenge, the defender throws one symbol (rock, paper, scissors or aspecial \nsymbol allowed by certain powers) while each attacker throws one symbol ofhis own in the \nsamechallenge. EachattackerbidsoneTrait (orenoughTraits toenteronechallenge), and \nthe defender bids enough Traits to engage in challenges with every attacker; if the defender \nhas insufficient Traits, he may choose the attackers against whom he wishes to defend. The \ndefender compares his symbol to every attacker at the same time, then resolves each result \nsimultaneously: Losing three tests and winning two causes the defender to lose three Traits \nand suffer all of the results of losing to the three victorious attackers. If the defender \ncounterstrikes, he may choose to affect any one attacker whom he defeated in the mas \nchallenge. Retests should also be made together, but each patty must bid enough Traits to \ncover all targets; thus, the two losing attackers in the previous example could bid one Trait \neach to retest, and the defender would have to bid two Traits to retest against them bth, \nresolving the retest as a second mass challenge. \nWILLPOWER \nDifferent Mind’s Eye Theatre books give different rules for what can and can’t \nbe done with Willpower Traits. The most consistent set of rulings to date is listed \nhere, along with the reasons why certain changes have been made. \nWillpower can be used to refresh all Traits in a single Attribute category \n(Physical, Social, Mental) once per category per session. \nWillpower cangrant areteston aSocialor Mentalchallenge, ifthe Storytellerfeels \nthat Willpower would be appropriate to the challenge. Acharacter cannot simply ignore \nthe effects of such challenges with Willpower; that would nullify the use of many special \npowers (“I ignore your Presence with a Trait of Willpower, then hit you four times with \n"

      "text": "claws.”). Similarly, certain challenges are not appropriate for expenditure of Willpower; \na Willpower Trait should be used only on Mental and Social Challenges to resist \ninfluence or injury. “I expend a Willpower Trait to retest your Auspex challenge against \nmy Obfuscate” is not an appropriate use of Willpower, since the cloaked individual \ncannot simply will himself to remain better hidden from the character with Auspex. \nHowever, Storytellers must decide for themselves which types of challenges permit this \ndefensive use of Willpower and which do not. By default, Willpower Traits provide a \ngeneric retest on a Mental or Social Test, once per challenge. \nA Willpower Trait cannot be used to win a Static or Simple Test automatically, \nconsidering that many special powers and effects are predicated on such tests. Allowing \na player to (for instance) expend two Willpower Traits and automatically win the two \nfollow-up Static Challenges to stake a vampire through the heart unbalances play. \nA Willpower Trait can be used to ignore all wound penalties up to and \nincluding Incapacitated for one challenge and one challenge only, including all \nretests made as a result of the challenge. \nUsing a Willpower Trait allows a player to attempt an action that would \nnormally require an Ability not possessed by the character. Thus, the player could \nspend a Willpower Trait to try to disarm an alarm even if the character does not have \nthe Security or Science Ability. The Willpower simply allows the player to make the \nattempt. However, success is not guaranteed. \nT I M E  \nThe inexorable press of time in Mind’s Eye Theatre games breaks down into \ndifferent segments to approximate the durations of various powers and events. \nN O R M A L  \nT I M E V E R S U S  \nCOMPRESSED \nTIME \nFor the most part, Mind’s Eye Theatre games run in normal tine - \nthe amount \nof time passing in the real world equals the time passing in the game. Thus, if a player \nwanders about the game site, talks to a few other players and has a drink (taking up \nan hour of time), then an hour passes in the game as well. \nUnder some circumstances, though, the game shifts to compressed tiw. The resulting \nphenomenon is called (in the vernacular) a ttme-hubbk. In compressed time, game events do \nnot actually take as long to occur as the real world dictates. Thus, if a series of tests takes five \nminutes toresoLveonetumofcombat,thentheplayersinvolvedinthetumhaveexperienced \ncompressed time - \ntheir characters have had only five seconds of game time pass. \nMoving from compressed time to normal time can be tricky. The best solution \nis to assume that the extra time is taken up overseeing wounds, helping allies, getting \nback to the game site or attending to other minor details. Thus, if several players in \ncompressed time take two hours of real time to finish a combat, but only pass a few \nturns in the game, then it’s best to assume that they return to the game site two hours \nlater, having rested, driven to the appropriate location and so on. \nMEASURES \nO F  T I M E  \nA turn is the brief amount of time needed to use a quick special power or to make \na single attack against someone. In general, a turn lasts five seconds; most characters \ncan take a single action in one turn. A Narrator may choose to make a turn last as long \nas a minute depending upon circumstances, but a turn is usually just a brief interval of \ntime. Laws of the Hunt states that a turn takes fourseconds, but considering that many \npowers work in intervals of five seconds, the latter is a more sensible time frame. \nA conflict comprises several turns. If a player involves himself in a series of \nchallenges with multiple individuals, unbroken by changes in time, space or events, \n"

      "text": "thissegment oftime is oneconflict. Anexample ofaconflict is asingle combat between \ntwo sides or a series of tests as a character in a car tries to pursue a fleeing opponent. \nAs long as the tests continue to resolve a single outcome (finishing the combat, chasing \nthe enemy, conditioning the mortal, etc.), the incident is a single conflict. A conflict \nis assumed to last 10 minutes if an absolute scale of time is necessary, although this \nestimate may be extended to account for a particularly long conflict. \nA series of conflicts makes up a scene. As long as the characters pursue the same goal \nwithln a given perid of time, they are within a particular scene. Thus, a coterie of vampires \nfighting against its Sabbat foes would have a conflict for each battle fought, but the series of \nbattles taking place in one graveyard would comprise a single scene. A scene is assumed to \nequate to one hour of time; powers listed as “lasting for a scene” end when the scene ends (in \nthe previous example, if the players left the graveyard or slept for the day) or when an hour \nof time elapses in normal-time play. Thus, if a player invokes Encrrmcement on someone for \nascene, the targeted individual remainsentranced until the game markedly shifts locationand \ntime, until areal hour haspass edoruntil the conditio ns for brealung the Enrrancement are met. \nOne session generally results from an evening’s play. A session usually includes \nseveral scenes but may only be one. Most game sessions last several hours in real time. \nA session has no predetermined time; when in doubt, assume that a session lasts from \nsunrise to sunset (or vice versa) for game purposes. For ease of tracking Traits and the \nlike, a session ends when all of the players go home for the evening, and it begins \nwhen they come back again. At conventions or locales in which a game proceeds \nconstantly for several days, assume that each session is comprised of one day and one \nnight (the Storyteller should decide in advance if the session breaks come at sunrise \nor sunset). For most games, a session is simply the monthly or weekly game night. \nAstory is the result of several sessions developing a coherent plot. A story can be told \nin asingle session, but it is usually the result ofseveral interlinked sessions. The conclusion \nofamajt)rplotline,be itthedeathofacharacter,theresolutionofaproblemorthechanging \nof a tradi tional event or thing, marks the end of a particular story. Certain Traits and powers \nlast for the duration of astory or can be used only a certain number of times in a given story. \nFor ease of record-keeping, Storytellers may simply decide on a particular calendar break \n(at their discretion) as the refresh date for such powers, allowing them to update all game \nparticipmts regularly instead of having to track diverse time arcs with different Traits. \nFinally, a chronicle is the tale of many characters and settings spun together through their \nstories. As long as a game continues with the same characters, places, rules and events, it is \nprobably a single chronicle. Multiple threads resolve themselves, and numerous stories may \nend in the COUR of a chronicle. Like a series of books or movies, the chronicle is the overall \npicture ofwhat’s happening in a particular part of the World of Darkness. Any given game can \nbe considered a chronicle in its totality; that is, the chronicle changes when the Storyteller \ndecides to start a new game, possibly with different characters, changed rules and new goals. \nLOOK IN^ AHEAD \nObviously, as the Mind’s Eye Theatre game system continues to develop, new rules and \nnew problems will crop up. The changes mentioned here may not be good for all time. \nHowever, intrcducing these corrections now should go a long way toward correcting some \nof the more blatant difficulties in the Mind’s Eye Theatre system - \nwe’ll admit it, we’re \nhuman (more or less), and mistakes do occasionally creep in. When in doubt, use the most \nrecent sets of rules published; every METbook takes steps toward amore coherent rules base. \nIfyou like the new additions you see, don’t hesitate to integrate them into your existing games \n-after all, the fact that Military Influence wasn’t written into Laws of the Wild shouldn’t \npreclude you from adding it to your own! As always, this journal serves to keep players and \nStorytellers informed. Watch this space-we have new ideas, suggestions and input coming \nall the time, some of it even from dedicated players out there (like you). \n"

We frequently refer \nto ourselves as an organization of garners for garners, and it is this community ideal \nto which we aspire and grow. Based on the concepts of education and leadership \ntraining, the Camarilla gives people new skills, new friends and one heck of an \nexciting world-wide game. \nThe Camarilla is anon-profit organization based out of Salt Lake City, and our \npurpose is threefold. First, we strive to provide acontinuous world-wide live-action \ninteractive theater game based upon White Wolfs World of Darkness - \nmore \nsimply put, a LARP. We utilize several e-mail lists and a host of volunteer \nStorytellers to run this game. The chronicle has been in place for six years, and it’s \nstill running! This October, the entire organization of the Camarilla came together \nto solve a complicated and deadly plot that affected the whole chronicle, some- \nthing never seen before! Over a year of plotting and work went in to create the \nhorror and the complexities of the plotline we lovingly refer to as the “Vorosja \nDebacle,” and all Camarilla players will continue to feel the fallout for years to \ncome. It is just this kind of long-term chronicle that the Camarilla promotes. \nOur second goal is to promote community service and civic involvement. \nThis effort gives our members a sense of personal accomplishment, as well as \nreminding our communities that garners are people who are just as concerned and \ncivic-minded as their next-door neighbors. Over the years, we have hooked up \nwith the Red Cross, the Special Olympics, AIDS research, shelters and tornado \nand flood relief, and we have donated thousands of hours to helping out in our \nlocal communities. \nOne of the Camarilla’s funniest stories comes from an auction we hosted.

Everyone involved in the donation began to laugh and \ncheer as the auctioneer’s jaw hit the floor. The story spread like wildfire, and that \nyear many children at the Shriners Hospital were given another chance at life. \nOur last and most important goal is to provide our members a good time, in \ngame and out. We have been asked to host the openings of movies like Blade and \nMen in Black while dressed in costume, we have raised the Elder Gods in Call of \nCthulhu LARPs, we have participated in One World by Night and Liquid Dreams \nLARPs and we have danced down the trods with our Changeling Storytellers. We \ntry to promote events that everyone would be interested in or would like to be \ninvolved in. I guess the most important thing to mention is that we strongly \nencourage new and old members to go to their officers with their ideas for events \nand work on putting them together for everyone to enjoy. \nOne region rolled some of the objectives of the Camarilla together into a day \ncalled the “Garou Moot and Pool Party Barbecue.” In character, members playing \nGarougot together to celebrate the summer solstice. Everyone had fun as they tried \nto convince the Red Talons to get in the pool and get a little wet! I also heard \nrumors of members having a lot of fun during a weekend at a regional game and a \nday at Six Flags over Georgia with members from several different states! There is \nsomething in the Camarilla for everyone, and that is what we are all about! \nThe Camarilla began in February of 1992 In Seattle, Washington. Jana \nWright and Matt Burke made an all-important phone call to White Wolf to find \nout if there were any fan club organizations for the new Vampire game. The answer \nwas no, and thus began the Camarilla, White Wolfs fan club. The concept of the \nclub was that it existed for people who not only enjoyed the game but pursued other \ninterests that would fit within the Gothic concept. It was also at this time that the \nfirst members named our magazine Requiem, and they have watched it grow from \na simple newsletter into the quality production that it is today. In March of 1992, \nat Nonvescon, the first members handed out flyers and an interest sheet to find out \n__ \n~~ \n~ \n-~ ~ \n~ \n"

Later that year, at Vikingcon, the first members of the \nCamarilla made their entrance in the public eye and hosted the first meeting of the \nfounding members and Inner Council. \nIn April of 1995, Heidi Preuss became the President of the Camarilla, and its \nheadquarters moved to Salt Lake City. Since then we have grown from an \norganization of 1,400 members and one e-mail list to a thriving organization of over \n4,000 members in 1 1 countries world-wide. We host over 190 e-mail lists to support \nour diverse interests, including humor lists, creative writing rooms, in-character \nlists and forums for education, debate and announcements. Internet Relay Chat, \nor IRC, is also a tool that the Camarilla utilizes frequently in order to promote the \nglobal game as well as host online meetings with members all across the world. \nRequiem has turned into a magazine with a color cover, glossy pages, excellent \nwriters and fabulous artists. Every Camarilla member can enjoy any of these above \nbenefits, as well as a 20% discount on all White Wolf materials purchased directly \nfrom White Wolf, a membership handbook filled with wonderful ideas for the \norganization of chapters, and access to the members-only section of our website, \nwhich hosts many pages of information and educational materials. Over the years, \nwe have grown stronger and learned more about running a club with such diverse \ninterests as ours. \nAt this point, it is probably best to explain how the Camarilla’s communi- \ncation lines and hierarchy are built. The Camarilla is organized with our purpose \nin mind. First of all, the club maintains two lines of officers: the Storytellers, who \nare in charge of the games, and the Coordinators, who are in charge of keeping \nthe organization functioning. We decided to organize things along these lines to \nbetter relieve stress upon any single person. A Storyteller who does not have to \nworry about making sure that the rooms are secure and paid for, keeping the \nmembers happy out of character, taking care of the newsletter, and securing \nfuture game times is free to Dlan for the eame and the in-character events.

Thus, \nlocal members maintain the basic organization and flavor of their own chapters, \nand this feeds into the personality and cohesion of the organization as a whole. If \nlocal members want to create a chapter dedicated to creative writing and critique, \nthe Camarilla helps them set their chapter up that way. If they wish a chapter \ndedicated to hosting or attending troupe games, we help set their chapter up that \nway. Each chapter is in charge of its own identity under the ideals of the “Chapter \nStrong” philosophy of the Camarilla. Most chapters are active participants in the \ninternacional global game, and most utilize the Storyteller-Coordinator partner- \nship method to organize their officers. \nAt the base level, then, are local chapters, with the Coordinator and \nStoryteller in charge of organization. Chapter-level games are the most prolific and \nform the bulk of the Camarilla’s chronicle.

Some \npeople have even traveled long distances to finally meet those Camarilla members \nwhom they had only seen as writing on a screen. One member published the \nchronicle of her trip from the UK to Italy as she visited Camarilla players along the \nway. This really helped to bring United States members an understanding of their \nfellow gamers overseas. \nFinally, the board of Directors organizes the vision and inner workings of the \nCamarilla. Eleven Directors work year-round to produce the quarterly magazine, \nthe Requiem, promote the Camarilla at conventions such as GenCon and \nDragoncon, organize the annual International Camarilla Conclave convention \n(ICC), educate, promote community involvement and so much more. The \npresident heads the board and maintains a managerial view of the functional \nworkings of the organization. The Master Storyteller weaves together the plotlines \nof the regions and the international games and passes down national and intema- \ntional storylines for the various games. The MST is also in charge of rules \nclarification and supplement creation. \nThrough it all, small projects are always cropping up. These projects are often \nthe ideas of general members (and they are spearheaded and run completely by the \npeople who brought them up, with minimal Board advisement) or they are ideas \nbrought together by the Board itself. The appropriate member of the Board gathers \nteams to complete the project in a timely manner. These teams often include \npeople from all around the globe. In this way, the hierarchy of officers actually \ncreates a circle of communication and education. Each person lends a talent and \nability to the other members, and everyone is encouraged to keep anopen mind and \nsense of willingness, because there is always going to be someone out there who has \nsomething to teach you or a new way of doing something better. \nIn the future, the Camarilla looks to further our relations with White Wolf, \nsolidify the continuity of the international game and organize informational \ndatabases of member information. We are in the process of creating a MUSH, we \nplan to further tabletop gaming activities, upgrade our magazine and promote \n' itions with other LARP organizations to expand the community of gamers for \niers. Some of our biggest interests are our continuing good relationships with \nmedia and local government organizations-there is so much to do and become \nolved in! And it involves everyone from the individual members to the board \nIirectors. In the Camarilla, everyone is responsible for ensuring that the games \nI the events all run with our Five Real-Life Traditions in mind: \n"

We utilize White Wolf books and materials, \nfocusing our efforts on creating a shared World of Darkness. Any official chapter \nof the Camarilla can become a part of the continuity. Once this happens, players \ncan join a tapestry of shared events and political maneuverings and lend their own \ncharacters to become a part of the hunting, posturing and manipulations of the \ngame. We support Vampire, Werewolf and Wraith, and our Storytellers recently \nadded Changeling. \nThe Camarilla, taking its lead from White Wolf, has separated our venues to \nsupport a game that more closely resembles the World of Darkness. We host \nCamarilla/ anarch/ mortal, Sabbatl mortal, changeling, Garou/ Kinfolk/ Bet6 and \nwraith venues. On the rare occasion that they happen upon each other, the venues \ndo cross. The Influence game, which is very strong in the Camarilla, crosses all venues \n-mortals can learn of careless Kindred through an Influence war. In Chattanooga, \nTennessee, Camarilla members play common mortals slowly becoming pawns in the \nlives of the Kindred. The game has an X-Fiks feel, as the players’ mortal characters \nare immersed slowly in the global continuity of Kindred and Garou games. \nAs you can tell, we support all manner of games. It is important to note that there \nis a difference between sanctioned games and troupe games. We do host and promote \nseveral troupe games. These can be anything from a game that uses our rules and creation \nsystem but stays outside the continuity to a “God Game” in which everyone plays a \nMethuselah and attempts to kill the others off until there is only one left. We encourage \nmembers to attend LARPs hosted by organizations that are not a part of the Camarilla. \n"

In the meantime, \nwe do engage in general tabletop gaming within our chapters. Members encounter \nthe World of Darkness, Cthulhu and his Miskatonic madness and traditional \ndungeon crawling in ADBD. \nCamarilla members have even taken board games \nsuch as Talisman and Star Wars Monopoly and created chapter and domain \ntournaments! We also enjoy participating in more active games like touch football \nand ultimate frisbee: One region frequently challenges its domains to fight it out \non the frisbee field or basketball court! \nOver the years we have endeavored to participate more and more in conven- \ntions on a local and national level. In 1998, several local chapters hosted events such \nas demonstration games or community service booths at local conventions. Nation- \nally, the Camarilla participated in GenCon and Dragoncon. We met many \nwonderful people at these conventions and managed to meet other LARP organiza- \ntions. At GenCon, we met One World By Night and wore its “Bite Me” buttons in \norder to participate in its LARP as mortals. (Ofcourse, we did get together with other \nmortals and attempted a mortal uprising against the oppressive tyranny of the \nvampires.) At GenCon, we met the creative members of Liquid Dreams, an all- \nSabbat LARP in Atlanta. We also met many of the members and coordinators of \nSabertooth, a Vampire organization in New York. It was amazing to make all these \nconnections and realize that we are all a part of a much larger community. \nMany regions host regional events every few months. These events usually \nencompass entire weekends during which the region rents out a hotel. During that \nweekend, members host several tabletop games, a weekend-long sanctioned game, \nhow-to lectures and regional member and officer meetings, as well as organize a \ndealers’ room. In the dealers’ room are exhibits from local non-profit organizations \nand local shops and artisans. White Wolf occasionally puts in an appearance to \npromote the most recent publication in the Mind’s Eye Theater product line.

The Camarilla is trying its best to promote gamers and the \ngaming community as a group of responsible and fun-loving adults. \nNationally, the Camarilla has put together a convention that we lovingly call \nICC, or the International Conclave of the Camarilla. The first year of the \nconvention was 1996, and it was hosted in Houston, Texas. Every year the \nconvention has grown by 30%. It consists of four days and nights of LARPing, \ntabletop gaming, a charity auction, meetings for officers and members, open board \nmeetings, parties, dancing and, of course, a well-used booth from White Wolf. We \nhost it every year during the week before Halloween. It is a time when members \nfrom literally all over the world come together and renew friendships out of \ncharacter and pursue the hunt as Garou or seek the demise of a centuries-old enemy \nas vampires. This year, in Salt Lake City, we added our Changeling and Wraith \nvenues. We also had a surprise when Fox Television showed up to videotape us for \ntheir newscast! It was really amazing to walk through the halls and hear people \ncalling to each other and introducing new members. Over 550 people from all \naround the globe attended this last convention, and we are expecting that number \nto grow even larger in Portland in 1999 and Cleveland in 2000! \nThere remains something to be said about the creativity of the members and \nthe family created by the Camarilla. Our members are writers, students, lawyers, \ndoctors and rocket scientists. We are ro!eplayers and community members. We \nare old and young, we are tall and short0 we are a little bit of everything. I have \nseen members come in off the streets and turn their lives around. I have seen \nchapters get together to raise money to help defray medical costs for a member \nwho is sick. I have seen members find other members jobs. I have attended \nparties, weddings and graduations and welcomed new babies home. Members get \ntogether to write stories and articles, create works of art and take amazing photos! \nThe Camarilla is about bringing in the innate talents and abilities of every \nmember and sharing them with each other to create a community, write a story \nand bring about a little change. \n"

Vampires break the Masquerade; Garou endanger the Veil; changelings \nblow the rights of the Escheat right out the window; waiths violate the Dictum \nMortuum. But what’s to be done when the thought ofhaving to push that big, ugly \nRESET button looms! This column hopefully serves as a gukkline. In each \ninstallment, you get the problem plus the solution (all of which come out of real \ngaming experiences). \nHow NOTTO \nTHROWA \nMUSIC EESTIVAL \nT H E  PROBLEM \nIt all started reasonably enough. A Sabbat troublemaker had been dropping \nhints of his whereabouts to the local Camarilla-loyal denizens of [Anycity], GA. He \nhad been taunting the prince and primogen council shamelessly, and the prince had \nfinally dispatched a small coterie (including a Tremere, a Malkavian and a Gangrel) \nto find this vampire before he did some real damage to the Masquerade. Following \na tip, the coterie tracked the Sabbat to a side-street in Atlanta adjacent to the site \nof the Music Midtown Festival. \nDodging through a crowd that had gathered to taunt and out-shout a local street- \npreacher (one of Atlanta’s many), the coterie closed on the Sabbat’s position. They \nspoke to said rebel, but he was not content to stay put. Drawing the three along, he \nmoved closer to the crowd (a crowd which drew in the people leaving the Festival just \ndown the street). When he had led them to the center of the crowd, the Sabbat sprung \nhis trap, designed to shatter the Masquerade in downtown Atlanta. Without warning, \nhe uppercut the Malkavian, sending the hapless Lunatic flying across the street and \nover a row of parked cars. The Gangrel leapt at the Sabbat, Wolfclaws gleaming in full \nview, and missed. He sailed through the air, trying to catch himself, but only managed \nto draw 10 deep rents into the hood of a parked car before rolling into the people- \npacked street. The car’s alarm went off, and those pedestrians who hadn’t already \nnoticed (or bolted like sheep from) the commotion all turned to stare agape. \nBut it was the action of the Tremere that really stuck in their minds. Thought \nhe was too stunned to move when the formerly talkative (even genteel) Sabbat first \nattacked, the Tremere regained his wits as his two companions fell in short order. He \nstepped into a clearer line of sight with the Sabbat and enacted the Thaumaturgy \npower Theft ofvitae. As the Sabbat gasped in unexpected pain, a viscous red torrent \nleapt from his body to the outstretched hand of the Tremere. Suddenly rethinking \nhis goals (he’d done more than enough already), the Sabbat turned his supernatural \nprowess to self-preservation. Disappearing at inhuman speeds, he carved a path \nthrough the throng and out of sight. \nAt which point, of course, all hell broke loose. The rowdy, milling crowd scattered \nin panic (those who still could, anyway), and even the vociferous street preacher \nturned tail and fled with the sinners. The fleeing people collided with the ones spilling \nover from the Music Festival, all shouting about what had happened. Aghast, the three \n"

Shattering the tranquillity of Elysium, he gathered every Kindred in \nattendance. He commanded everyone present to pool every last resource available to \nthem (every dollar; every ounce of Influence) and work toward quashing the problem. \nIn the end, the following Influences came to the fore: \nChurch \nFinance \nHigh Society \nMedia \nPolice \nStreet \nAnd how did the unlucky Camarilla vampires use these Influences? Inshort, the \nvampiresused each to create and cement a plausible (ifnot highly likely) cover story, \nreasoning that an outlandish believable story would have a much greater impact and \nwould be more memorable than an outlandish unbelievuble story. \nThe cover story stated that, in the late hours of the Music Midtown Festival, an \noutspoken fire-and-brimstone street-preacher had taken it upon himself to bring light \nto the eyes of the baleful sinners of Atlanta. In so doing, however, he had shamelessly \nlain about with accusations of exactly who was a sinner and why, and (in his own \nspectacularly undiplomatic idiom) he had managed to start a small-scale race riot. \nHowever, merely saying a thing is never enough to make it true, and it took the \ncollective Influence of every [Anycity] Camarilla vampire to make it a reality. The \nMedm and Police Influences went out almost immediately to clear up the public and \nofficial record of what happened. A plant inside the area police department was \ndispatched to monitor incoming eyewitness reports and either lose them entirely or \nalter them in such a way that the supernatural violence reported was toned down to \nthe level of monstrous human violence. Those vampires with eyes in the local public \nmedia maintained a vigilant watch on live videotape submissions- thus curtailing the \nrelease of anything directly incriminating- as well as calling many different broadcast \nstations and newspapers with false scoops on the story the Kindred wanted to see put \nforward. Some of the Police Influences also went into having the incriminating car \ntowed away and destroyed. (One generous vampire even used a Bureaucracy Influence \nto see that the human auto-owner’s insurance company paid the salvage cost.) \nFinance, Church, High Society and Street all went to backing up the public and \nofficial view of the story once the Kindred had gotten it out. The vampires used Finance \nand Street to bribe various “eyewitnesses” to speak to the police and local news \nbroadcasters. The Church Influences coerced local churches from all around Atlanta \nand [Anycity] to issue press releases condemning the wayward street-preacher who’d \nstarted the whole mess and to offer any sort of community aid in their power. Similarly, \nthe High Society Influences were used to cajole a similar series of press releases from the \npromoters, performers and subsidizers of the Midtown Music Festival. \nDue to the vampires’ quick reaction and blanket Influence-spending, the story \nthey wanted heard quickly became the official story. As for the coterie of vampires \nwho let the situation get so far out of hand in the first place.. . well, let’s just say that \nthere are some horrors in the World of Darkness that are best left unspoken. \n"

We’re working toward becoming an expansive community of \ncamaraderie and roleplaying. In some small way, we are contributing both to \nourselves, in terms of fostering plots and friendships, and to the gaming community \nas a whole, in terms of growing awareness and acceptance by a number of social \ngroups. Many of our players are involved in the business and social communities \nin our respective towns and countries, and the friends we make in these organiza- \ntions come to accept that what we do is a harmless pastime. In both ways, our hobby \nis fostered. This is, in my opinion, a Good Thing. \nTo ensure our enjoyment, we’ve constructed an organization that is easy to join \nand participate in, with only a few restrictions to keep things comparatively sane. \nOne World isn’t a hierarchy that costs our chronicles anything to join or stay \nwith. The main thing we ask is that our chronicles emphasize stories that are meant \nfor the enjoyment of our players -we hope that any players who may travel from \naround the world will be enraptured by and entrapped within the intricacies of \nanother shadowy comer of our One World. \nWe’re not a small group of individuals that changes your chronicles to suit its \nwhims. OWbN’s founding idea is that all games have a great degree of autonomy \n- \nessentially, as we put it, “your game is your game.” This philosophy has yielded \nus a veritable melting pot of styles and personalities. With no central overriding \ntheme and no dominant personality other than trying to be generally receptive to \nall styles of games, we appeal to all types of garners. \nWhen we encounter situations that involve crossover interaction between \nchronicles, we encourage the Storytellers of those chronicles to communicate and \nelaborate the plots for the enrichment of both (or all) the games involved. \nWe are not some industrial bureaucracy that forges and legislates its \nchronicles into carbon copies of one another; chronicle-diversity is essential. We \nall build upon one another - \ngood ideas spread, and bad experiences are shared \nin order to keep other chronicles from facing similar problems. Individuality is \nthe heart of our organization. \nOne World isn’t limited. The only limitations are the ones we place upon \nourselves and the ones required to administer the organization. With the addition \nof each new chronicle, we add to the experience, wisdom and creativity necessary \nto expand and enhance the ever-unfolding story that is our One World by Night. \nHmm ... Perhaps a little background is in order. \nOne World by Night started in Chicago, Illinois, USA in March of 1994 at \na local roleplaying convention by the name of Concentric. \nHey, neat!

The convention’s plots were incorporated \ninto the new Chicago game (started by Mario Bonassin), and the original storyline \nfor One World by Night was born. \nThe Chicago game grew quickly as the players played within the Excalibur \nnightclub, the actual model for the Succubus Club of White Wolfs Chicago by \nNight. In addition to Chicago players like Dave Gill, other non-Chicagoans joined \nthe game. John Flournoy was running the Lafayette game at Purdue University, IN, \nand among his players were two students from the East Coast, Bill Hyatt and Rich \nDevine, two of our first Head Coordinators. When some of these players left for \ntheir respective home cities, the idea of an intertwined World of Darkness arose. \nOne night at a Chicago game in the top floor of a bar called the Morseland, \nDave Gill and Bill Hyatt put forward their ideas for a shared game, though it would \nbe unlike either the Camarilla or the Shared Universe system. The focus would be \na shared story, not shared rules. Bill had the exact same idea and even had a name \nfor the concept. The first Midwest shared game was created between Lafayette, IN \nAfter about three months, Bill and Rich went back to NVA and we thought \nthe game would end. On the contrary, our little experiment proved that a shared \ngame was possible but that it needed work. It needed a charter so that all the \nStorytellers would know what they were getting into. The charter needed to \noutline clearly that your game would remain your game and that no one would stop \nyou if you wanted to go through the entire rulebook and rewrite it (as we all did \nseveral times over). But goofy-ray-gun-wielding Mummies were not in any way to \nhave a part in the shared story. \nBill, who had named One World by Night, became the Coordinator, creating \na web site and acting as a contact for other games. He talked to people about our \nproject and marketed the organization’s focus - \n“your game is your game.” \nWe soon recruited Jake Holub and the San Francisco delegation, both of \nwhom are with us still. We became national, spanning coast to coast, in a matter \nof a few months. \nConcentric ’95, in March, was the first OWbN Conclave, at which we \ndiscovered how different our rules really were and polled the players to find out \nif they wanted some universal rulings. The answer was an overwhelming \naffirmative. Not only were they telling us that they enjoyed being a part of the \ngame but also that they were confident and comfortable with us making these \nuniversal decisions. \nGenCon ’95 was the organization’s first officially sanctioned event (although \nit was not officially part of the convention) and the first meeting of the chronicle \nrepresentatives. This was the first occasion upon which we firmly decided on some \nof the articles that now comprise most of the charter rules. No chronicle would be \nallowed to act against or outside of these rules, for we believed that we had the plan \nfor creating a successful network of LARP chronicles. From these Articles came \nwritten hints and models for starting a successful chronicle, optimum conditions \nand where to look for renting sites. OWbN had created a kind of manual for \nrunning your own game and keeping it afloat. \nSince then, OWbN has grown to encompass over 60 chronicles, mostly in the \nUSA and Brazil. Other countries, such as Spain, Brussels and New Zealand, also \nhave member chronicles. \n"

The attendance was \nphenomenal, exceeding 240 players. \nThe latest event was the Mid-Atlantic Conclave, held in Baltimore at the end \nof October. It involved the cooperation of three different games in the area, a \nmonumental feat of organization that was pulled off flawlessly.

I had a great time. \nBut I digress. \nOWbN is administered primarily through a series of coordinators and council \nmembers drawn from the various chronicles. Each chronicle has a voice on the \nCouncil through its council member, who is selected by the players and Storytellers \nin that chronicle. The council member is responsible for representing his chronicle’s \ninterests, keeping the Council apprised of any situations of regional or interna- \ntional significance that may arise, and voting on any matters that may come up in \ncouncil, such as the admission of new chronicles to OWbN. \nCouncil Members are also primary contact points (alongside the Storytellers) \nfor other chronicles wanting information or updates on current plots in their local \nchronicles. In most cases, council members are also Storytellers (although this is \nnot always the case) and can give immediate answers - \notherwise they direct the \nquerent to the appropriate person or ask the question on the person’s behalf. \nVoting itself is a simple matter - \nin most cases, a proposal to the Council is \npresented and (hopefully) seconded. A period of discussion is allowed and then a \nvote is called. Each chronicle is allowed one vote, as are the HC and AHC. \nGenerally, a majority of the received votes will indicate the proposal’s success. \nThe Council also votes on applications for chronicle membership, and the \nAdmissions Coordinator may cast a vote in the case of a tie in these situations. \n"

The improvement of our operations should streamline a number of issues. \nA set of coordinators is elected each November to hold positions of specific \nresponsibility in OWbN. \nThe Head Coordinator (HC - \nme) oversees the entire operation of OWbN \nand is assisted in the task by, naturally, an Assistant HC. Alongside these two, an \nAdmissions Coordinator tracks new applications to OWbN and keeps tally of the \nmembership. These three people form the core of OWbN’s administrative team for \nout-of-character issues. \nThe HC is primarily responsible for overseeing the progress of OWbN as an \norganization, for dealing with matters arising in regard to the OWbN Charter and \nfor maintaining some sort of order amid the chaos. The HC also assesses disciplin- \nary situations that may require OWbN’s attention and dispenses advice to \nchronicles as requested. If he’s a good boy, he gets a pat on the back occasionally. \nHe (or she - \nalthough we are yet to see a woman be insane enough to stand \nfor the position, I believe, so please forgive the male pronoun) is also responsible \nfor supervising the other coordinators as a group. He selects the coordinators each \nyear (subject to a verifying vote of confidence for each by the Council) and thus \nhopefully assembles a team that can work together for the betterment of the games \nin general. \nThe Assistant Head Coordinator (Joyce Summers) is responsible for main- \ntaining the sanity of the Head Coordinator by dealing with the administrative \nminutiae of OWbN, such as voting procedures. This year will see the further \nexpansion of the scope of this position to encompass maintenance of and regular \ncontact with our more distant chronicles and assistance with the redevelopment \nof a number of our organizational systems. \nMatt Giezentaner, our Admissions Coordinator, and I will continue to \nreceive and assess the initial admissions applications to assist new and existing \nchronicles in their applications to One World by Night. Matt is available for \nconsultation with anyone considering joining OWbN and can answer most \nquestions you may have or direct you to someone who can.

These people act as clearinghouses for the various and nefarious wheelings \nand dealings of these ancients, and they give many of OWbN’s players a focus for \ntheir gameplay - and they instill appropriate fear in the characters. The \n“JustiCoords” maintain regular contact with the Storytellers of OWbN as required \nand assist in resolving plot issues involving their offices. \nWe generally keep the justicars’ actual appearances at games limited to \nconclaves. Archons or secretariats to the justicars are preferred forms of Camarilla \nenforcement if intervention or contact is required. Recent events in the OWbN \ncontinuum have seen a marked increase in the number and caliber of archons \nappearing in Camarilla domains. The death of Xavier, until recently the justicar \nfor Clan Gangrel, has obviously shaken the heretofore impervious justicarate, and \nthere is visible evidence of its unease. \nTherefore, OWbN has an infrastructure that exists to support all the people \nand characters associated within. Storytellers have access to many other Storytell- \ners to be inspired by and to inspire. Players have access to thousands of other players \nto interact with, plot with and generally breathe life into what we call our One \nWorld by Night. \nWell, that’s pretty much how we run the organization, but you’d probably \nprefer to hear about the chronicles. \nOWbN is dominated at present by Camarilla-based vampire games. There are \nexceptions to this - \na few games are primarily Sabbat or Garou in focus, a couple \nare anarch in nature, and some games mix’n’match genres. \nThe primary rulebooks we use are The Masquerade Second Edition and \nLaws of the Night. Other books see inclusion as the Storytellers see fit and as \ndiscussed by the Council -for \nexample, some aspects of Laws of Elysium are \ngenerally considered in OWbN to be restricted to Storyteller characters rather \nthan open to players. OWbN’s vampire games are directed primarily at the \nyounger Kindred. There are restrictions on the play of true elders and on some \nof the types of Kindred permissible in any chronicle - \nfor example, True \nBrujah or Salubri. Similar rules will apply to other supernaturals as they are \ndeveloped and enter OWbN. \n"

      "text": "Variants on the White Wolf MET rulebooks are permitted within \nreason. We recommend that chronicles stick fairly closely to the White Wolf \nproducts so that there is some internal consistency in the way the game is \nplayed. It was very pleasant to find that most of the rules I encountered in \nChicago and Baltimore worked much the way they work way over here in \nHamilton. Variations in the interpretations of the rules also opened my eyes \nto the possibilities of other interpretations that I hadn’t considered. I never \nclaimed to be a rules lawyer, but I found some of the ways the systems were \nplayed very educational. \nNever discount a learning experience. Most of our people are happy to share \ntheir ideas, and though we have our fair share of squabbles over some things, any \nidea that might enrich your game or your gameplay is important. Many of our \nchronicles adopt systems from others in OWbN. \nWe hope to expand our horizons beyond Vampire. With the release in 1998 \nof a number of White Wolfs MET products, we now have a considerably greater \nscope with which to work, play and flourish. This will involve some changes in our \ninternal structure, but we bid Flexible on that matter. \nOur Garou coordinator, Krissy Ryan, is working busily on further integration \nof Garou chronicles into the fold. As I write this, we’ve recently welcomed another \nGarou game. The Kenosha: Bad Moon Rising game had been playing alongside \nKenosha: The Eternal Aria for some time and was gladly given admittance, as the \nplayers had played by OWbN rules for some time and had remained in regular \ncontact with OWbN both in and out of character. This put them in good stead \nwhen their game’s number came up. \nAt present, Matt and I are discussing the possibility of adding a Changeling \ngame. We’re not averse to a Wraith game joining in, but we foresee some \ndifficulties with character interaction because of the Shroud. We’ll cross that \nbridge when we come to it, I guess. \n"

      "text": "In numbers, our games range wildly and widely. Some chronicles have less \nthan a dozen people; others number around a hundred regulars, including \nvisitors from nearby games. We don’t have an accurate count of our total \nmembership, but estimates place us at over 2,000 players in over 50 games in \nsix different countries. \nAt present, OWbN is slightly fractured because of language barriers between \nsome of our chronicles. With the advent of translation sites on the Internet - \nmy \npersonal favorite is http://babelfish.altavista.com - \nI hope to see much of that \nbarrier crumble over the next year, and it should encourage a broader scope of \ninteraction all around. \nOWbN tries to hold at least one conclave a year. In 1998, we held two fairly \nlarge conclaves (Chicago and Baltimore) and ran a huge game at GenCon in \nAugust. These games are organized by enthusiastic teams of Storytellers with too \nmuch time on their hands and too much caffeine in their systems. More large \ngatherings of this nature are in the cards for 1999, although details are still being \nworked out. We’ll post all upcoming major events on our website. \nIn between such events, players are often road-tripping to other cities just for \nthe hell of it. Just traveling between OWbN cities is an experience in itself - \nmeeting new people both in and out of character and experiencing the unique \nflavor of a new game can often prove a refreshing and eye-opening experience. \nTravel the world, see the sights, play a little Vampire and make a lot of new friends. \nAnd you don’t necessarily have to travel to other games to affect them - \nemail communications and expenditure of Influence or use of city contacts \nthrough the Storytellers can have as much of an impact as being there would. \nIt has been my personal pleasure to attend the two American conclaves this \nyear, and I am proud of the efforts of all concerned in the organization and \nexecution of the events. I would like at this time to formally thank all of you who \ninvited me and forked over for the plane tickets.. . twice.. .. \nI’m still humbled by that experience. \nSome of our chronicles are also in contact with various independent games \nin their areas. Though our official stance is that these games don’t necessarily \nexist in our continuity (at least, until they join OWbN, he smiles), we in no way \ndiscourage our people from talking with other games and other groups. After all, \nwe don’t have all the answers to all the questions - \nwhy limit our opportunities \nto learn? \nOWbN is developing a good relationship with White Wolf, and we are \npleased to have been of assistance in the past in terms of playtesting and \nopinion. A few of its staff are on hand, either as friends or accomplices, and we \nacknowledge the help that they have given us in the past. We hope to continue \nthis productive and convivial friendship in the future. I guess the opportunity \ngiven me to write this article means we must have some degree of respect in \nWhite Wolfs eyes (heh). \nOWbN is perhaps very reflective of the World of Darkness as given us by \nWhite Wolf. We don’t slavishly follow the books as written in terms of Storyteller \ncharacters or sourcebooks (or our Milwaukee and Chicago games would be very \ndifferent if we did), but are instead working on our own continuity, using many of \nthe White Wolf sources to fill in the gaps. \n"

Clan Toreador kept Madame \nGuil, who originally appeared in Diablerie: Britain, and Clan Malkavian kept \nJusticar Lucian, a character from the card game. The Ventrue opted to choose Tai \nPan Robert Pedder as their next lawmaker. Other than those characters, the other \njusticars (Masako, Clan Brujah; Kharel, Gangrel; Ctarinov, Nosferatu; Malaphar, \nTremere) were created within OWbN to fill the positions. \nNew concepts presented by White Wolf (such as the many alterations to the \nWoD as presented in the revised edition of Vampire: The Masquerade) are \ndiscussed by the Council and the Storyteller teams before anything is introduced \nto the mainstream of the games.

      "text": "NUNNFHI EOR The \nshininq H O S ~  \nby Peter Woodworth \nConsidering the popularity of Mind’s Eye Theatre’s The Shining \nHost and the resurgence in fascination with Native American culture and \nmythology, I couldn’t think of a better summer feature than one on how to \nincorporate the Nunnehi into a LARP setting. And when Peter Woodworth, \nthe author ofThe Shining Host, agreed to write the piece for me, I jumped \nat the opportunity. \nT H E  PEOPLE \nThe Nunnehi (which means “people who live anywhere”) are the faerie folk \nindigenous to Concordia, having dwelled here many centuries before the first \nEuropeans or their Kithain cousins ever set foot on it. Like the Kithain, the \nNunnehi were torn between two worlds, the Earthly realm and the Higher Hunting \nGround (Nunnehi Dreaming), and they struggled daily to preserve the old ways. \nTo keep faerie spirits alive in those long#ago days, wise Native Americans acted as \nhosts for Nunnehi spirits, allowing them to use their bodies until the spirits were \npassed on naturally to children. Over time, the Nunnehi fire nearly died out, but \na recent surge of Native American pride has done much to revitalize it, and now \nthe Nunnehi Nations stand ready to claim their rightful place once more. \nNunnehi make excellent additions to Mind’s Eye Theatre games that take \nplace in areas of great natural significance, and many of the native fae preserve a level \nof innocence and trust in the natural order that even other changelings lack. What’s \nmore, many of them have grudges and alliances with the Kithain stretching back to \nbefore the days of the Revolutionary War, thus presenting a uniquely historical \naspect to any modem game. Centered as they are on the spiritual world, the Nunnehi \nalso present an excellent change of pace for players used to “typical” Changeling \nstories -or an excellent challenge to motleys who think they’ve seen everything the \nDreaming has to offer! Facing Nunnehi forces Kithain to examine the high costs of \nthe modem culture that they are a part of, and playing a Nunnehi demands action \nbefore yet more of the world is allowed to fall to the tainted touch of “progress.” \nAmong the Nunnehi themselves, old tribal blood feuds persist, occasionally \nspilling over into the chimerical realm and forcing them to wonder who the true \nenemies are - \nthe Europeans without or the hotheads within. Conversely, many \nNunnehi Nations are much closer than their kith counterparts, and quests shared \nby heroes of allied Nations are the stuff of legend. \nTHE \nMANY \nWORLDS \nNunnehi believe there are three worlds: the Upper World of totems, visions and \nspirits, the Middle (physical) World of humanity and the Lower World of the dead. \nThe Upper World is largely a reflection of the Middle World, but it is much more \nvivid and profound, offering a glimpse of the true nature of things.

      "text": "World is beyond imagination, the home ofgreat gods and heroes. The Lower World, \nby contrast, is also a reflection, but it is ashen, dull and decaying, a place of sadness \nand despair. Great trods connect all places in the spirit world, and visiting it is an \nimportant part of a Nunnehi’s life. All things living and dead are part of the great \ncycle. Nunnehi who possess at least Basic Wayfare and one level of the Nature Realm \nmay cross into the Upper World by stepping into a quantity of their chosen totem: \na flowering bush, rock face or a waterfall. In addition, all Nunnehi may cross over \nusing a body of pure water. Note: Nunnehi cannot cross into the Lower World on \ntheir own, although they may use the Spirit Link Art to speak to its ghosts. \nSystem: The Nunnehi must perform a Bunk and win a Static Mental Challenge \nusing the Mythlore Ability against a difficulty of the Banality level of the area in order \nto cross over. (If the Nunnehi possesses the Portal Passage Art and the Verdant Forest \nlevel of the Nature Realm, all difficulties are lowered by two.) The Nunnehi may bring \nothers along, as long as they hold hands and the Nunnehi spends one Medicine Trait \nfor each passenger. Those characters who cannot cross over on their own are stuck if \nthe Nunnehi abandons them, and they must seek out a special trod to get home. \n(More detail on the Upper World - \nor the Umbra - \ncan be found in Laws \nof the Wild; for the Lower World, consult Oblivion.) \nC ~ L A M O U R A N D  BANALITY \nNunnehi refer to Glamour as “Medicine,” and they may gather it from artistic \nperformances as Kithain do, although they are two Traits down to do so unless the \nartist is Native American and performing a traditional piece. Furthermore, the \ndifficulty to enchant mortals increases by one inside the confines of a city. \nMost Nunnehi prefer to gather Medicine from natural sources. They have three \nways of doing so: Harvesting, Raiding and Blessing. Harvesting (equivalent to Reverie) \nis handled with the same systems, except a Static Mental Challenge is employed and \nHarvesting requires at least one hour spent in contact with the natural scene being \nenjoyed (lying in a field of flowers, dipping toes in a stream, sunning on a rock). \nRaiding, the equivalent of Ravaging, also uses the same systems, but the \nNunnehi runs the additional risk of attracting the ire of angry spirits if she fails the \nRaiding challenge. (Narrator’s discretion, but typically distracting and unpleas- \nant.) Blessing uses the same mechanics as Rapture, but it can only be achieved \nthrough a direct audience with the Nunnehi’s totem spirit while in the Upper \nWorld and only once per season. Totems usually honor such requests for an \naudience, but they expect no less than the absolute best in exchange for their time! \nN U N N B H I  \nCAMPS \nNunnehi do not recognize a Seeliewnseelie distinction, instead using the Summer \n(or Dogwood), Winter (or Rock) and Midseason (or Laurel) camps. Summer Nunnehi \ntend to be outgoing, warm and friendly; Winter Nunnehi tend to be withdrawn, cold and \nunforgiving. Midseason fae are tricksters one and all, balancing the two camps as they see \nfit. Many Nunnehi follow camps on a seasonal basis, although this is by no means a \nrequirement. For example, many Nunnehi adopt their Winter aspect when recently \nwronged or insulted, and some mume their Summer mien when falling in love or taking \non quests. A few uncommon Nunnehi adhere to the same camp nearly or completely \nyear-round. Nunnehi may change their camp freely as Kithain do, although most prefer \na private ritual of transition before showing off their new camp allegiance. \n"

Examples of Bunks with that sort of flavor \ninclude, blowing smoke from a peace pipe to set the mood for use of the Sovereign \nArt, wearing a hand-crafted mask when performing a trick of the Chicanery Art \nor executing the steps of a tribal dance in order to use the Wayfare Art. \nNu N N  e H I BAC \n~ c j  \nR O  u N D s \nNunnehi have several unique Backgrounds to choose from during cre- \nation.

      "text": "COR.€ IDEA \nThere’s more to building longevity than simply deciding, “It’s time to run a new \nlive-action game.” Indeed, lack of initial design dooms many games to eventual \ndeathdown the road. Though it mayseemanunnecessaryeffort, there’sno substitute \nfor preparedness in running a chronicle, and the first step in proper preparation is \nisolating the core idea of the game. \nA game’s core idea defines and guides the chronicle. Although certain themes \ncome naturally to each of the Mind’s Eye Theatre settings, a prepared Storyteller \npicks and chooses the ones that he desires to showcase. The idea is to pare down to \nthe essential elements. Start by separating into story elements and mechanical \nelements, then work up brief lists of desired material. \nMECHANICAL \nELEMENTS \nThe first piece of superstructure for a chronicle lies in the game mechanics. Pick \nthe game you plan to run with an eye toward possible themes and players - \nLaws of \nthe Wild explores powerful themes of isolationism and the danger of fanatacism, but \nit may be difficult to showcase them consistently; Laws of the Night games may draw \nnumerous players, but it can be difficult to develop new and unique story elements. \nAt the start, you need only consider broad story elements. Most games use some \nvariation of the Mind’s Eye Theatre rules, yet there’s no problem in altering the rules \nto suit the game. Decide how much to alter the rules for the game - \nrules are only a \nframework, after all, designed for ease of play. Are manipulation and intrigue going to \nbeparamount?Ifso, thenhfluencerulesshouldprobablybe more heavilydetailed. Are \nthe characters supposed to be more experienced and potent than normal? Change the \ncharacter-creation rules. Play with the framework as necessary, but once the game \nbegins, don’t change the rules unless it’s absolutely necessary - \nconsistency, though the \nhobgoblin of little minds, is part of the virtue of fairness in play. \nSTORY \nELEMENTS \nA chronicle’s story elements are the dramatic pieces that the Storyteller wishes \nto emphasize. For instance, a Vampire story may showcase redemption, inhumanity, \nmystery. romance or even a combination of the above; a Wraith story could focus \non loss, reconciliation, helplessness and hope.

      "text": "about any story type. The job of the Storyteller here is to decide what themes will \nbe important to the game so that plot elements can build from those themes later. \nBy way of example, if a story focuses on redemption, the players must be given \nopportunities for their characters to witness or perform horrible deeds so that the \nlater redemption has meaning. \nWhen building story elements, remember that the ultimate point of the game \nis to have fun. Many Storytellers come up with intriguing plot ideas but become so \nintent on showcasing their unique creations that the players lose the ability to \ninfluence the direction of the game. Once all power of choice has been removed from \nthe players, the game stops being fun. Thus, if a chronicle focuses on helplessness, \nthe Storyteller must balance the players’ feelings of inability to affect their environ- \nment with the needs of running an entertaining chronicle. \nStory elements should just be broad statements in the outline of the game - \nthe \nactual focus on driving plot pieces comes later. Look at the broad picture of themes for \nthe game, pick a few and write them down. It’s important to have more than one story \nelement, because players have varied tastes and not all players want to be involved in \nevery type of story. Similarly, recognize that individual Storytellers have different \nstyles; the Narrators and Storytellers of the game must have plot elements with which \nthey can effectively work. A Vampire game of romance, intrigue and betrayal is \nconceptually great, but it won’t last long if the Storytellers and Narrators aren’t \ncomfortable running some of the themes or if the players don’t want that sort of game. \nGROUND Up \nWith core themes and some basic mechanical tweaklng done, it’s time to look at the \nprospective plotsfor the game and the elements that will allow it to run over the long term. \nPreparing for a long-running game isn’t difficult, but it does require advance planning. \nThis is the stage at which the Storyteller should set up the backstory and start \nsoliciting players and assistants. Also, any regular live-action game needs a solid \nmeeting place, so this is the phase for picking a location (and alternatives). Other \nmandatory paperwork - \nrules updates and the like - \nneeds to be done before the \ngame begins as well. \nPLOTTING \nSTORY \nARCS \nStory arcs come in three types for full chronicles, unsurprisingly divided into \nshort-range, mid-range and long-range ones. A successful chronicle possesses all \nthree and allows them to combine so as to form conflicting elements. After all, \nwithout conflict, the players may not feel a sense of accomplishment; the players \nneed to be able to direct the game in some fashion, and they do so through their \nchoices of plot resolution. \nThe underpinnings of a chronicle play from the long-range plot elements. A \nlong-range plot element is really a factor of the story, and it is predicated upon the \ncore theme. Players can and do drive long-range plots, but the Storyteller needs to \ninject plot elements as well. After all, not every player immediately visualizes goals \nfor her character. The long-range plot elements focus on the chronicle’s overall \nstructure and guide the story; they also pull in the players who wish to participate in \nthe overall story. Some sample long-range elements are: The Inconnu bring the hope \nof Golconda to a deserving Cainite (based on a redemption theme); local Garou \nbecome involved in the lives of their Kinfolk and their communities, fighting to \ndefend those parts of human society (based on a romance theme); the local town is \n"

As \nproblems, they play on the driving elements of the game and spin off from the goals of \nparticular players. Indeed, a goal that a player visualizes for a character can form a good \nmid-range plot. Mid-range plots need to be tracked carefully so that their pieces remain \nconsistent from game to game. Examples of mid-range plots include: A vampire tries \nto learn an unusual Discipline (such as Necromancy) outside of his clan’s specialties \n(perhaps to further a long-range goal of Golconda or control over a particular element \nof the city); the Sabbat declares a crusade against the characters’ home city, and the \nsiege must be resisted (possibly as part of an ongoing border war between Camarilla and \nSabbat in the area); a Hierarchy official/archon/elder Garou visits for a time (perhaps \nlookingforalostlovedoneaspartofaromanceplot); auseful itemorpersondisappears, \nand several clues and puzzles must be found and understood in order for the thing to \nbe found (perhaps to fulfill some piece of the puzzle in a mystery plot). \nA sh-range plot spans only a single game session or part of it. Such a plot element \nis usually subordinate to a larger plot device. Short-range plot elements can come in just \nabout anytime with minimal effort; if they aren’t planned, though, they can seem odd or \ncause continuity problems later. The best plan for short-range plots is to look at the causes \nand effects of the various larger plot elements and play from those. Examples of short- \nrange plot elements: ASabbatpackattackssomecharactersandmustberepelled(aspart \nof the Sabbat crusade plot); a Nihil opens briefly, disgorging some Spectres (possibly \nrelated to the ongoing plot of loss, with the Shadowlands falling to the town’s decay); an \nobject is lost or stolen, but the clues point to a rapid recovery (as part of a mystery plot); \na diplomatic envoy arrives and delivers a simple message, requiring a simple response \n(maybe pushing associations with a later romantic interest). \nFor a good, solid start to a chronicle, pick two story arcs of each length and plot \nthem out. Remember, short-range elements resolve quickly, so new ones may be \nneeded at the next game; however, with luck, the existing mid-range and long-range \nelements drive the players to make their owngoals, thus spinning off some new short- \nrange elements. However, never count on the players to drive the story. Although \na player-driven story is generally the most rewarding, the Storyteller must be ready \nto introduce new random elements and hooks. \nREBUILDINC~THE \nRULES \nThe chronicle’s been plotted, the goals are in place and the players are enthusi- \nastic. Now it’s time to sit down and actually tweak the rules that need modification. \nThe first section to check out is character creation. The options allowed to \nplayersgreatly affect the theme and mood of the game. In agame focused on intrigue, \nfor instance, it makes sense to limit the amount of Influence that characters may start \nwith so that they are forced to squabble over it later. A Storyteller running a game \nset in Germany during the Dark Ages should recommend that the characters take \ncommon languages. A game focusing on mystery or the solving of obscure riddles \nprobably needs to limit the use of unusual powers and Merits by the characters, so \nthat they have goals to attain in the course of the game. \nNext, lookover the Storytelling mechanics themselves. There’s almost no reason \nto change the core bidding system of the game or to mess with the various combat rules; \nthese tend to run equally well for just about any game. However, the use of \n"

It does no good to \nschedule a game but then be unable to tell players where to meet. Inclement weather \nand lack of space can also severely handicap a game, as can lack of a location to perform \noff-site actions and narration. Keep all these factors in mind when looking for a site. \nFor locations with good weather, outdoor sites are sometimes possible. Parks \nand outdoor malls are often completely free, and they usually have plenty of space. \nHowever, there is always the risk of weather turning foul. Worse still, such games are \nnot necessarily private - \nand never (but never) try to draw negative attention from \nthe local populace. Most people don’t really have any idea of what live-action \nroleplaying means, and it’s not worth drawing in the police over “strange cult-like \nactivities.” Go for a more secluded spot, or at least one where the outrageous \nbehavior that inevitably crops up can go unnoticed. \nSome areas provide club buildings or community centers. Such places make \nexcellent venues, but there is often a rental cost. This isn’t so bad if the players can be \nenticed to cough up a couple of bucks each. Still, be sure to check out the rental \nagreements on such places. Some buildings may require additional deposits or payments \nto cover possible damage; accidents can and do happen, and$700 in repair workcan spell \ndoom for just about any LARP. Again, most people aren’t familiar with live-action \nroleplaying, and they automatically make negative associations; this ill shadow (as it \nwere) can be a hindrance when filling out the event forms that many locations require. \nOf course, the best spot for a game is at someone’s house! A large enough house \ncan easily host several dozen players, and if it’s not part of an apartment complex, \nthe LARP‘s noise quotient and occasional odd behavior won’t draw any attention. \nThe problem here is in convincing someone to open up a home for two dozen people, \nall of whom might be carrying and spilling drinks, tromping about in dirty shoes and \ngrabbing scenery objects as part of their character portrayals. When using a house, \nbe sure to set specific ground rules and to make them known before each and every \nevent. Doing so saves grief (and cleaning bills) later; players should be penalized for \ninappropriate behavior. Players can complain about their characters being mis- \ntreated, but when their in game activities cause out-of-game distress, it’s time to trim \nit back. Also, the homeowner should receive some incentive for making the site \navailable; an extra experience point for the session or other game treat is a good \ncompromise, as is forming a volunteer crew to help clean up and to provide food or \nfurnishings necessary for the events. \nture-controlled regular setting that’s absolutely free. \nRECRUITMENT \nWith a location and a solid game design in mind, it’s time to recruit players and \nassistants.

Such games can quickly \naccumulate many players. The risk is that some of the players may bring along \ntheir own quirks and foibles in a way that threatens the enjoyability of the game. \nRecruiting for an open game is simple: Place some posters at the local game store; \nrun off some flyers with a description of the game’s core theme; and use the \nInternet to set up contacts on newsgroups (like alt.games.whitewolf) and e-mail \nlists (like Vampire-L). \nRestricted games limit their membership in some fashion. The most common \ntype of restricted game is invitation-only; these games generally recruit solely by \nword of mouth and only under the auspices of the head Storyteller. Certain clubs and \norganizations like the Camarilla also run games that are available only to club \nmembers; recruitment here comes about through club periodicals (like Requiem) and \ne-mail (like One World by Night’s OWbN-OOC list). \nThe first stageofrecruiting is finding out whether there’senoughdemand torun \nthe game! If a game won’t attract more than a couple of players, then the long- \nrunning plot lines may not have a chance to really shine. Without character \ninteraction, the two players probably won’t stick around unless new players are \nsuddenly recruited in the second game session. A good medium is to shoot for at least \nadozen players; for one-shots, a handful is fine, but long-running games need enough \nplayers to divide into factions. \nOnce thegame is indemand, pick assistants. Remember, though, that not every \nassistant (Narrator, coordinator, Storyteller, whatever) needs to be competent in all \nareas of the game. It’s possible that someone is great at providing transportation and \nsite logistics but has a tough time with the rules. That’s fine -grab people who can \ndo the individual jobs necessary and assign them strict roles. That way, the game gets \npeople who can do particular jobs well instead of running the Storyteller ragged or \naccepting people who may be multi-skilled but noc exceptional in a particular \nposition. It’s always good to avoid personality conflicts here; although in theory \neveryone should be able to get along and do their jobs without conflict, in practice \nreal life sometimes interferes, and so assistants need to be chosen with an eye toward \ncompatibility (with each other, with the Storyteller and with the players). If \neveryone hates a particular Narrator, it won’t help move rules resolution along \nsmoothly; there’ll be too many arguments.

Handle such problems as soon as they come up. \nThe worst sort of politicking comes from favoritism. Storytellers sometimes feel \ncompelled to give special benefits to their friends and significant others. This can be \nall right, as long as such benefits fit into the context of the game; picking out specific \npeople to play local Hierarchy officials for an Oblivion game, for instance, saves the \ntrouble of filling in with Narrator characters and gives a deliberate power structure \nto the game. However, the Storyteller must be absolutely firm indecisions offairness. \nIf the Storyteller chooses to be unfair or to skew the game’s rules or points toward \ncertain individuals, this skewing must be solely a result of the game’s play, not \nbecause of special friendships. A Storyteller thought to play favorites wins no respect \nand actually loses players. Generally, the best course is to stick to the same rules for \neveryone. If there’s a deliberate imbalance of power, it should be specifically written \ndown so that it can be seen and addressed by all of the players. \nPolitics also lead to metagmning- the practice of using out-of-game knowledge \nin the course of the game. Metagaming can be difficult to track; if a player knows that \na particular character is a diabolist, there’s nothing to stop his character from \nspuriously accusing the diabolist and then claiming that he was “just making it up.” \nEither way, the diabolist gets caught and likely killed; this is no fun at all if the player \nspent a lot of effort on his activities. The best way to handle metagaming is usually \nin downtimes. Have each player write a report between games on what his character \ndid and learned at the game (as well as what he intends to do during downtime). If \na player uses knowledge that his character shouldn’t have, stop it immediately. Once \nmetagame knowledge gets out, it has to be traced to every person “infected.” \nSome players also bring their real-life conflicts with them into the game. If a \nparticular player hates another player, it’s possible that the first player may make a \nseries of characters all designed for the specific purpose of killing the hapless victim. \nIn such instances, the best way to deal with the situation is to bring in Narrator \ncharacters. Although heavy-handed, this can serve to play up why killing other \ncharacters is almost universally frowned on by the higher-ups of just about any World \nof Darkness group. Also, keeping the players from killing one another in a pointless \ncycle forces them to direct their energies elsewhere, possibly adding to intrigue and \nnew plots in the game. \nCHARACTER \nIMBALANCE \nCharacter imbalance, a subtle, creeping factor, makes a game difficult to \ncontrol and hard to enter. At the outset of the game, everyone pretty much runs \nunder the same power levels. Players all build their characters with the same rules, \nand avoiding favoritism lets everyone get a fair shake at the game. New players can \ncome in a few months down the road with the expectation of getting involved in an \nalready established good game. \nThe problem of character imbalance starts creeping up after numerous \nsessions have passed - when players have had a chance to accumulate 50 \nExperience Traits or more for some of their old-guard characters. These characters \nmove to the forefront, dominating the game. This is natural; ancilla and elder \nvampires, old gaunt wraiths and the like should occupy positions of power. \nHowever, these characters can come to completely control the game, shutting out \nnew players with less powerful characters. When these old guard characters can do \n"

      "text": "everything the new characters can do (and do it better), there are no storylines in \nwhich new players can get involved. \nUltimately, there are three good solutions for character imbalance. The first is \nto build in obsolescence for characters: For every chunk of 25 or 50 Experience Traits \nspent on a character, increase all costs for later purchases by one Trait. Thus, an elder \nvampire character who already had 100 Experience Traits spent on powers and \nAbilities would have to spend an extra two or four Traits on all new purchases. \nSecond, offer build points for characters: New players might get some extra Traits \nwhen building their characters so that they can keep up. This tactic invites the \nworrisome problem of power-escalation, though, causing all characters to become \noverpowered down the line. Third, build in safeguards to keep certain plots open to \nnew players. If some Narrator characters at the high levels of the game direct plot \nelements toward the new characters or if you simply ask some of your old guard to \nstep back and allow new players to participate in certain plotlines of your designa- \ntion, you can avoid the syndrome of helplessness among the new crowd. \nSITE CONFLICTS \nA well-planned game can always fall to the problems of the real world. \nUnfortunately, the (perceived) less-than-sterling reputation of the roleplaying \ngame community means that some places may hesitate to allow live-action games in \ntheir area. Some games even face harassment from local authorities. \nIn order to prevent problems with conflicts of this sort, always have a backup \nsite planned. When setting up a location, make sure to have an alternate available, \nand make sure that everyone knows how to get there as well. Plan for sites at least \na month in advance, so that there is enough time to reschedule and try to get a \ndifferent backup in order if something goes wrong. \nAlso, as a matter of common sense, don’t antagonize non-players. Although LARP \ngroups often adopt a siege mentality about the surrounding community and people who \ndon’t understand roleplaying, nothing is served by getting in other people’s faces. People \nwho don’t understand the hobby don’t get a favorable impression when MET players \ntreat them with scorn or derision. Always be polite. If locals or law enforcement ask the \ngroup to move to a different location, agree to head to an alternate site and ask to discuss \nthe matter later - \nbetter than arguing about it in the middle of a game and antagonizing \nboth the players and the non-players. Remember, some LARP groups might be mistaken \nfor gangs, absurd as it seems (after all, local merchants and police have a valid concern \nabout 20 people in black trenchcoats congregating in a public place and making strange \nhand gestures). Keep matters low-key, and instruct players to direct people to the \nStoryteller if a problem arises. Although she may be well-meaning, a player in the midst \nof a challenge or action-filled scene may not make the best diplomat for an outsider to \nthe game; the Storyteller must be able to fill that responsibility outside of the game itself \n(remember, most non-players feel very uncomfortable discussing matters in the middle \nof the game, so be sure to go somewhere else to negotiate). \n90 qeT’EM! \nThat’s it! Seriously. Setting up a long-running chronicle may seem like a lot of \nwork, but it’s rewarding to Storyteller and players alike. Keep a sheet handy to jot \ndown notes about the various steps in this article, and chronicle setup for most open- \nended games can be accomplished easily in under a day. And, of course, always \nremember the most important rule - \nhawe fun. \n"

      "text": "A POSITION \nO E  S T R E N ~ T H  \nby Carl Bowen \nWe intend to include a piece of World of Darkness fiction in every issue of \nthe Journal. Fiction dealing with the World of Darkness offers insights into the \nlives and times of the people (i.e., the characters) who inhabit it, and such \ninsi,phts offer you (as players and Storytellers) flavor and spice to make your \nMind’s Eye Theatre games all the more attractive. Mind’s Eye Theatre \nreleases should be simultaneously entertaining and useful. This piece, in \nparticular, showcases a way to blend into the background ofmortal society while \ncarrying out very specific Kindred business. \nA touch on my face awakens me as night comes. For a moment, I believe that \nthe touch is that of a lover’s hand, but the ever-present smell of my surroundings \nbreaks through that lie right away. I open my eyes to the darkness, suspecting that \nthe touch was no more than the flicking tail of a rat. The little beasts crawl onto \nmy chest to sleep sometimes, not moving an inch until I begin to stir to life. The \nskittering, splashing sounds that echo around the dank cavern like the applause of \ntiny sycophants confirm my theory. I never see the furry things, but I am almost glad \nof their company. At least they are company. \nStanding, I brush gnarled, spotted fingers through the last of my hair, \nresisting the urge to tear it all out by the roots. Instead, I pass my empty hands \nover my head like an empress holding elaborate ivory combs, creating an illusion \nof a thick fall of ebony locks, just as I sported in my youth. An illusory suit of \nexpensive silk comes next, covering the tattered remnants of an out-of-style \ntweed blazer and blue jeans combination. Finally, I concentrate on the way I used \nto look before.. . before it all. I remember my blue eyes and trimmed goatee - \nmy teeth, tarnished from years of smoking a pipe yet still straight and strong. I \nconcentrate on these things, and I know - \nalthough I cannot feel it - \nthat I look \nthat way again. I know that the true flesh of my face is safely buried beneath that \ngenial mask. Only when my disguise - \nthe lie that covers who I truly am - \nis \ncomplete do I venture toward the surface. Only the stench of the sewer remains \nto hint at my identity, but I let that be. \nThe place I had slept is not far from my point of egress into the dark streets \n- \nI have taken to sleeping where I fall lately - \nand I soon stand above the \nsurface of my home. I step into the shadow of a nearby building and lean against \nthe wall for support. I don’t like being above ground; I prefer it even less when \nI have to be outside. \n“You have rat-droppings on your shirt,” asmug, faintly amused voice says from \nacross the alley. \nI jump and draw a quick breath - \nmore from habit than involuntary reflex. \nMy contact is early. He can see right through my disguise, and he (no doubt) saw \nwhere I emerged from the sewers. I will have to change my route to the surface now. \n“Bainbridge,” I say in a whisper. My voice is not what it used to be. “It is good \nto see you.” \nA P O S I T I O N  Of S T R B N Q T H  \n"

He is decked in ultra-stylish, tight-fitting clothing that somehow \nmanages to please the eye despite the best efforts of the ugly pink-orange tint \nof the sodium-arc streetlights. He stands with one knee cocked, his arms \ncrossed. A delicately embroidered handkerchief carrying the scent of heavy \nperfume dangles from his right hand, and he waves it under his nose casually \nevery few moments. \n“You’re right on time,” Alex Bainbridge lilts. “And I see you have your game- \nface on. That’s good.” \nI bristle and cock an unamused eyebrow. \n“You mentioned a job last night, Bainbridge,” I whisper. “And a retainer fee. \nI’ve no love for bantering in the open like this.” \nSomething passes behind Bainbridge’s eyes, and he smiles. ‘Then come,” he \nsays, taking my arm and gesturing expansively. “Let’s away to someplace more \ncongenial!” He means his good humor to be infectious, but he spoils the effect by \nwrinkling his nose slightly at my odor. I give him a sardonic smile - \ncracked and \nblistered lips peeling back from crooked, gapped teeth that only he can see - \nand \nallow myself to be led. \n* \n* \n* \nHe takes me to an expensive nightclub on the far comer of town, and I am \nsurprised that it is not the one he owns, the one he alluded to when he contacted \nme by phone the night before. The very air pulses and hums with a press of human \nbodies all shouting and gyrating to music that is almost a physical presence. Lights \nflicker and flash in time with the music, transforming the mob of dancers into an \never-changing menagerie of sweating, hazy statues. This club is gaudy and juvenile \ncompared with the courtly grace of Bainbridge’s own club, the Bocor, but it is much \nbetter than being outside in the open. \nBainbridge and I take a table on the periphery of the dance floor, wading \nthrough the crowd with some effort. When we are seated, we do not try to shout \nover the din but rather move our mouths as if in speech. Each of us is an \naccomplished lip-reader - \nan invaluable skill in the information trade - \nand \nthe words come as naturally as a pleasant Sunday-afternoon conversation in the \npark. We may appear slightly odd, conversing amidst all this chaos without any \ntrouble, but we do not fear accidental discovery. The only others who take any \nnote of us are Bainbridge’s servants and the employees working at the nightclub. \nI trust surroundings such as these more than I would isolated booths or dark, \nforbidding alleyways. \n“You almost look overdressed now,” Bainbridge jokes, referring to my disguise \nand still flicking the handkerchief before his nose. His clothes perfectly comple- \nment his surroundings and vice versa. \n“The job?” I mouth back. It feels good to communicate this way, without the \npersistent scratching in my throat that started the night I entered this second life, \nwhen my throat twisted and cinched up at my first taste of blood. \nBainbridge rolls his eyes theatrically, but he smiles at my forthrightness. “It’s \nmore of a tenured position than a single job, really,” he says, skipping the banter. \n“As I mentioned, we are prepared to offer you a substantial retainer fee.” \n“GO on.” \nM I N D ’ S  E Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n"

Would \nthat be a problem?” \n“You talk like a lawyer, Bainbridge,” I smirk. “It makes this job sound less \nworthwhile by the moment.” \nBainbridge’s eyes flash, and a dazzling smile crosses his face. I have been told \nthat I am a handsome man - \nwhen I am disguised -but \nBainbridge is absolutely \nbeautiful when he smiles. \n“Nice words from someone who talks like a Harvard English professor half the \ntime,” he says, speaking aloud in his merry amusement. “But do forgive me. I only \nmeant to convince you of how important this job would be to those of my \norganization. The services we require beg a certain amount of delicacy and \nprovider-loyalty.” \n“You know how much my loyalty is worth,” I tell him, sitting back in my chair. \nDespite myself, I begin to relax. Bainbridge sounds desperate, and desperate men \nwith favors to ask are much more tractable and trustworthy by nature. \n“That I do,” Bainbridge mouths, still smiling. “And you should have what \nyou desire.” \n“Then tell me the job.” \nBainbridge looks away for a moment at some voluptuous girl throwing herself \nabout with particular grace on the crowded dance floor - \nhe is so easily distracted \n-then leans toward me and locks my eyes in his gaze. “My organization needs your \nparticular skills of mediation.” \nI blink. “Is that it?” I have long availed myself to those of my kind who \nknow to ask. \n“‘It’?” Bainbridge mouthes, incredulous. Then: “Ah, forgive me again. I forget \nthat you have not had the time to think this through as I have.” \n“Then do explain,” I say. It is often difficult to tell if Bainbridge is deliberately \ntrying to insult me or ifhe is merely tactless. It is so hard to tell, and with Bainbridge, \nan accusation of one would likely just bring assurances of the other. \n“What I mean to say is that my organization wishes to be your sole patron \nin the dispensation of your diplomatic ability. We wish to make you a kind \nof envoy.” \n“Why?” I can just imagine the endless frippery and decadence I would have \nto put up with were I to agree. Bainbridge’s associates are - \nlike Bainbridge - \ngiven to boring, pointless dalliances in art and social maneuvering. \nThis time, Bainbridge’s pause seems more the surprise of an overconfident \nman who cannot imagine why someone would want to disagree with him. \n“Well, primarily,” he says after only a short hesitation, “because we can offer \nyou a substantial amount of money, even when you are not on assignment for us. \nSecond, for our own part, my associates and I strive to possess those things that we \nconsider to be the best of their kind. We would be greatly honored to be able to lay \nclaim to your remarkable talent.

The former involved \nsome unruly servants of others of my kind who sought to put a halt to the \nlogging industry some years back in the name of environmental friendliness \nwithout considering the consequences on the local economy. The latter had \nended a tense period of hostility between my kind and the area’s original \nresidents who had grudgingly welcomed us when we first arrived, but then \nthought to change their minds. In both cases, I had simply been one voice out \nof many, yet it had been my ideas that had made the most sense to both sides \nof the quarrels. \n“That all happened some time ago,” I say. “Why does your.. . organization, as \nyou say.. . want to hire me now?” \nBainbridge glances around at each of his servants briefly, doubtless passing \nthem some signal to be prepared) and says, “Because we have an assignment in \nmind already, one for which you would be ideally suited.” \n“What assignment ?” \n“You understand that by telling you, I am assuming a certain-” \n“Yes, yes,” I cut in, ‘‘I will accept and be discreet, Bainbridge. Enough assurances.” \n“Very well. Something of a situation has arisen with one of the.. . guardians.. . \nof our kind. He has taken his master hostage, and he makes outrageous threats. He \nis, however, willing to negotiate.” \nI sit forward in my chair. This should not be. “How has he taken his own master \nhostage? I have no servants of my own, but the very nature of those bound-” \n“We do not know,” Bainbridge sighs. “We know that this servant, Travian is \nhis name, is possessed of great strength. He is also, by the accounts ofour messenger, \nquite insane.” \n“Then what makes you think that I will be able to negotiate with him at all?” \nA faint ghost of a smile touches Bainbridge’s face, and he says, “Perhaps I did \nnot make myself clear. I should have said that we only want you to talk to this \nTravian. We have no intention of bargaining with him, but he does have \ninformation we need. If you can pry that information from him, we would consider \nyour assignment accomplished. You need not cajole him into complying with you, \nnor do you need to placate him in any way.” \n“And why can you not just carry him away somewhere and make him give you \nthe information you desire?” \nBainbridge begins to seethe when I ask him that, and his fist slams down on \nthe table. “Because Travian is sitting at the center table of my club right now! He \ncontacted me through a servant last night before I spoke to you, and he has been \nthere since two hours before dusk waiting for us. He will not leave its safety without \ncausing a scene.” He unconsciously wads his handkerchief in his clenched fist, then \nleaves it crumpled on the table. \n“Then why not go to those of our kind higher in authority!” I ask.

I can almost feel them nodding in response, and I sense \nthat I am on decidedly delicate ground. \n“Because,” he says, “my organization and I are poised to make a rather \nsignificant political maneuver in the hierarchy of this town. If we go before the \ncurrent authorities with a request for assistance in dealing with our servants, we will \nlook weak and lose unimaginable face.” \n“You risk just that same loss by coming to me,” I say. “Either way, you are \nasking for help in dealing with what should be a strictly internal matter.” \n“Wrong, friend,” Rainbridge says, smiling easily. “We do not come crawling \nto you begging your help. To all accounts, I am being magnanimous to our erstwhile \nservant in hopes of preserving decorum in a fragile situation.” \n“You are negotiating with an insouciant lackey.” \n“We are employing a masterful negotiator in a holding ploy,” Rainbridge \ncorrects me. “Yet on the surface, we are affording great respect to an enemy. We \nappear both devilishly clever and noble.” \n“By using me and paying me off for it,” I say. “And binding me to your service \nto fortify your political aspirations.” \nAgain, that self-assured, if somewhat confused, smile crosses Bainbridge’s \nface. To him, I seem to be playing the game of bargaining, but I am putting too \nmuch heart into it. My compliance with his wishes should be a foregone conclu- \nsion, yet I actually seem ill-disposed to give it. \nrhere is a certain time-sensitive aspect to this assignment,” he says, his voice \ncarefully neutral. \n“Manipulate someone else,” I say, making as if to rise. ‘‘I have no desire to \nbridle a stalking horse just to keep you from looking silly.” \nBainbridge sits up a little straighter, the realization that I just might refuse him \ndespite his charms and bribes finally sinking in, and he says, “There is one other \nthing you may wish to consider.” \n‘‘, \nI lean back and steeple my fingers on top of the table. “And that is?” \n“Oh, must I?” he says. His nose wrinkles with distaste, and he says, “I find \nthis part so.. .” \n“Gauche?” \n“Cliched,” Rainbridge says, giving me a flat look. “Ah well. The thing you \nshould probably consider is that in turning my offer down, you become a potential \nliability to my aims. I am no lawyer, but I know that allowing such a thing would \nbe most irresponsible on my part.” \nStill half standing, I take a moment to really look around. Now that I’m \npaying attention, I see just how many of the random assortment of bystanders \n(and dancers and club patrons and bouncers.. .) are looking at me. They all flick \ntheir eyes (almost in unison) between me and Rainbridge, tense on the point of \naction. They may all be servants, but so many would surely be more than I could \nreasonably handle alone. \n“Thus, I say this,” Rainbridge says, ignoring everyone but me. “Work for me, \nor I will look into other options that will leave you and your niche in the \ninformation trade obsolete.” \nI glance again at the circle - \nthe noose - \nof eyes watching me, then sit back \ndown in defeat. “When do I begin?” \nA POSITION \nOP STRENGTH \ndB \n"

      "text": "The dazzling smile illuminates Bainbridge’s face as if it had never faltered, and \n“Immediately.” \nThe nightclub Bainbridge owns, the Bocor, stands in sharp contrast to Ban- \nHaven, in which he currently cowers. Whereas Ban-Haven relies heavily on \nGothic-Industrial architecture and pulsing lights and sounds, Bainbridge’s own \nclub is much more subtle in style and intent, catering to a more affluent and \nmature crowd. The lights are dim but constant. The colors lean more toward \nyellow and dark mahogany here instead of the black and chrome of the other \nclub. The music, while still pervasive and cutting-edge, doesn’t make a spectacle \nof itself. It coils and hums beneath the surface noise, underlying the atmosphere \nlike a serpent’s beating heart. The music subtly beckons here rather than \npounding at my eardrums. \nI drift in through the double doors - \ntranslucent glass edged with oak and \ngold-filigree - \nand scan the room in one pass. The guards inside, old servants of \nBainbridge, have been told to expect me, but they are still tense. The two at the \ndoor push back the front-runners of the pack that wants to come in - \nthe social \nhave-nots - \nand block off the entrance like riot police guarding a barricade. What \nfew outsiders have managed to prove their social worthiness and squeeze through \nstep into the club somewhat doe-eyed. They can tell that something is wrong, even \nif they have no concept of what that might be. \nI, however, am not lucky enough to be so blissfully ignorant. As soon as I cross \nthe threshold into Bainbridge’s club, I spot Travian sitting alone in the very center \nof the room. Even had Bainbridge failed to give me a picture-clear description of \nthe man, my eyes would have been drawn to him. He sits sideways at his circular \ntable, one arm cocked to rest on its surface, the other slung straight down at his side, \nholding a cigarette a few inches above the floor. This servant is by no means \nhandsome, but he exudes an aura of confidence and power that is difficult to ignore. \nHis knife-thin body seems simultaneously relaxed and poised to spring. The music, \nhowever, does not seem to affect him, for outlined against the backdrop of the \ndance floor, he remains perfectly motionless. \nStanding transfixed, I garner the notice of two of Bainbridge’s servants who \nhave taken positions inside the club. They recognize me and nod in unison, \nsubtly motioning in Travian’s direction as if I didn’t know where he is. At this \nsignal, Travian looks up, first at the two servants - \nwho, by their startled \nreactions, must have thought until that moment that Travian was unaware of \ntheir presence - \nthen at me. His movements are slow and precise, like the \nmotions of an owl or a robot. I can feel his gaze like a laying on of hands. Ignoring \nthe two servants, Travian cocks his head and glances purposefully at the empty \nseat across the table from him. \nAs with any adversarial contest between unequal opponents, the posturing for \ndominance begins immediately. Travian has taken a position closest to the door, \nso I must walk up to and then past him to take my seat. He also remains seated, \ndisplaying his greater ease and comfort. As I move to my chair, his eyes remain \nlocked on mine, swiveling to follow my every move. My face is acasual, unreadable \nmask. I steeple my fingers in front of my chin and lean on my elbows just far enough \nso that Travian has to turn in his seat to face me. \nhe retrieves his wrinkled handkercheif. \n* \n* \n* \nM I N D ’ S  E Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n"

Each one looks away when Travian makes eye \ncontact. “Enough of his entourage is already here.” \n“They’re just here to make sure you can’t leave,” I respond, surprising him a \nbit. “There are also three plants in the line outside and two men watching each of \nthe rear entrances.” \nTravian glances around again, trying to remain calm despite the rising surge \nof panic I felt so recently myself. My admissions confuse him and keep him off \nbalance. I have carefully rehearsed what information I can let slip to Travian, as \nwell as how hard he will have to pry and barter to get it. \n“Good old Bainbridge,” he says at last, taking an unsteady drag from his \ncigarette. “Ever thorough.” \n“Who is your master?” I ask, staring insistently through the pall of bluish \nsmoke. Travian blinks. \n“Didn’t Bainbridge tell you what I told his people to tell him?” he asks, his \ncigarette dangling in no-man’s land. “They should have said-” \n“What do you hope to gain from this?” I ask, hoping to keep him off balance \nand perhaps trick the information out of him. \nHowever, I’ve gone too far too fast, and I end up sounding like a Monty Python \nroutine. Instead of answering, Travian relaxes, letting a thin, callous smile crawl \nacross his face. Leaning back in his chair, he stubs out his cigarette and rests his \npalm on the table. \n“Not so fast there, slick,” he drawls, turning back to the side as he was when \nI found him. “You don’t want to blow your wad before I’m even ready.” \nI try to maintain dignity and put on a look of patriarchal disapproval. Travian \ndoesn’t even look. I doubt he can even smell my sewer-stench through all the \nsmoke that hangs in the air around him. \nSo tell me at your pace,” I concede, making the offer sound like a benign \nallowance. “You wanted someone to listen to you, otherwise you wouldn’t have \ngone to all this trouble.” \n“Soon enough,” Travian says. He taps out another cigarette from a wrinkled \npaper pack and lights it behind his hand. The flickering glow makes the black in \nhis hair dance like an oil spill. \nI easily wait Travian out as he smokes the cigarette from end to end insilence. He \ngrows tense with anticipation, pretending to look around at the patrons of Bainbridge’s \nclub, though likely scouting possible escape routes. Finally, when he has convinced \nhimself that every avenue out of the room (the building, really) is covered by creatures \nlike himself, he turns to me and begins to speak. Having been feigning disinterest and \nboredom, I look away from the dance floor and give Travian my attention. \n“First, I know who you are,” he says, crushing out the last of his coffin nail in \nthe heavy glass ashtray on the table. “I didn’t request you specifically, but I knew \nthat Bainbridge would go looking for you when I told him where I’d be tonight.” \n“Why?” \n“Well, I wanted it to be you they sent,” he says, looking away briefly. ‘‘I heard \nabout how you dealt with some of my people back when they were going all gung- \nho greenpeace on us.

Lafonte was \ninto some serious shit before I-” \nI know the name and affiliation of every one of my kind in my city, though not \nthose of their servants. Ellen Lafonte - \none of Bainbridge’s class - \nis young and \nweak, and it is no longer such an unreasonable surprise that her servant could have \ntaken her prisoner. There are issues of status that must be addressed, however, \n“serious shit” notwithstanding. \n“Before what?” I lay on. “Before you locked her in her chambers without \nsustenance?” \n“She’s not in her chambers, dammit,” Travian snaps, struggling to keep his \nvoice as level as mine. “And she’s not without-” \n“Ah, so you brutalized her and left her for dead somewhere?” Knowing \nLafonte, such a claim would not be so unreasonable. If I guess correctly, Travian \nis her senior in age. Doubtless the same is true for physical prowess as well, which \nwas why Travian was assigned to guard her in the first place. “My authorities will \nnot look kindly on that at all.” \n“Look, she’s fine,” Travian growls, leaning across the table at me. “I just \ndrugged her when I brought her food.” \n“Ah,” I smirk sardonically. “So you drugged her and left her for dead?” \nTravian slams a fist on the table, drawing several stares and the direct \nnotice of several of Bainbridge’s servants. ‘‘I told you she’s safe at the warehouse \nwhere I wo-” \n“You want to be heard?” \nA look of horror crosses Travian’s face and he closes his eyes. “Shit!” \nGlancing at the nearest of Bainbridge’s servants, I nod significantly and give \nthe subtle signal Bainbridge told me to give.

Stuff even people like her aren’t supposed to be into.” \nBainbridge’s servants look questioningly at me, and I only sit back in my chair. \nMy disguise belies no tension or question. “Escort him out.” \n* \n* \n* \nBainbridge meets me not 10 minutes later. He breezespast the line at the front \ndoor like it isn’t there and sits down opposite me in the chair Travian sat in. I order \ntwo drinks from one of Bainbridge’s servants and look at my employer with pride. \n“That was somewhat easier than I thought, I must admit.” \nBainbridge grins at me behind his perfumed handkerchief, making me want \nto cringe. “One must remember one’s place. You did well to remind Travian of his, \nalbeit later than I am sure his master would have appreciated.” \n“Indeed.” \nThe drinks -two glasses of deep red wine - \narrive, and Bainbridge says, “Did \nTravian tell you anything else as you spoke to him?” \nI gulp down the first swallows from my glass before I answer. Bainbridge will \nhave to forgive the breach of culture; I haven’t put anything in my stomach since \nI woke up. \n“Nothing regarding his motivation,” I tell him. “He would only say that \nMadame Lafonte had involved herself in some sort of illicit clandestine affair.. . .” \nBainbridge’s lip twitches behind his own glass. \n“Doubtless a bargaining ploy to buy himself a few more precious moments \nof life.” \n“Most likely,” I say cautiously. Why did Bainbridge hesistate? “It is odd, \nhowever, that he merely took her captive instead of putting her to death.” \n“Like most servants,” Bainbridge says, his mouth still behind the wine glass, \n“Travian did not understand the nature of our society. Ones such as we are not \ngiven to the emotional weakness necessary to give those methods their power.” \nI don’t respond to that. Instead, I drink off the rest of my wine (though more \nslowly) and sit, watching the dancers on the floor. \n“Is something wrong?” Bainbridge asks. I notice that his wine glass is empty \nalso. “You’re scowling. That’s a truly unattractive look on you, let me assure you.” \n“Just thinking too much, Bainbridge,” I tell him, still looking away. “The \nunfathomable concerns of our kind, if you will.” \n“I will not,” Bainbridge grins, gesturing roguishly. “We have more pleasant \nthings to talk about. Like your payment and the employment negotiations. You’ve \nmade a fine start here for us this evening, and it’s not even midnight! Let us hope \nevery night is so productive.” \nI hold up a smile, though the feeling dissolves behind it. “Yes, let us hope so.” \n(This story appeared previously in the Athens by Night newsletter.) \nA P O S I T I O N  Of S T R E N G T H  \ne \n"

If you’re justjoining us, this is Part \nTwo of Mayday!, a three-part adventure for Obliwion. Part One, Ambassador, appeared in \nthe March issue of the Journal and began the intrigue. So, in an attempt to help you keep your \nliwe-action chronicles cuwent with World of Darkness continuity, we present.. . . \nPART \nTwo: DEPLOYMENT \nSome technical notes before we begin again: No ready-made adventure could \npossihly account for player creativity, Narrator preference or even pure chance. \nThere are just too many variables at work in a live-action context to make for a \nsingle story that will work for everyone. Flexibility is essential. Keeping that in \nmind, then, each installment of this adventure is broken into individual scenes. \nThe scene descriptions are divided into two sections: Hard Info and Choices. \nThe Hard Info category presents facts, events and information that must \nsomehow occur or be revealed for the adventure to run as planned. Feel free to use \nexisting social structures, Narrator characters or your favorite plot devices to do so; \nthe how is not important as long as the what comes across. \nThe Choices category is, again, just what it might appear. The story’s \nflexibility plays a large part in these sections, as both Narrator and characters \ndevelop the plot. As long as the skeleton of the adventure - \nthe Hard Info - \nis \nintact, don’t worry about forcing the flesh into any particular shape. \nThough this adventure is designed for asmall to medium size Circle of wraiths, \nit can easily accommodate a larger troupe. Narrator characters, Spectres and all \nmanner of other characters show up, and all of them need players to make the \nexperience rise to its potential. Again, feel free to use existing characters outside \nof the central Circle, as having familiar elements introduce or elaborate on new \nplot threads only increases the dramatic power and believability of the game. Plus, \nemploying existing characters to drive this plot serves as a more direct motivation \nfor the characters to get involved, and it makes the players feel like active \nparticipants in the development of the plot, rather than simple agents acting in \nsomeone else’s story. However, if none of the existing plot-characters in your game \nseem appropriate to this story, we include our concepts of some of the major players \nat the end of each installment. \nA final note: The three parts of Mayday! mix and match with your existing \ngame readily enough. You could wait until the remaining part is released, then play \nthem all together as a stand-alone adventure, or you could play each part as it comes \nout in the Journal, waiting for the next installment before you play again. You \ncould weave each installment into an ongoing game, letting events snowball or \nleaving loose ends to keep players wondering what’s going on. Above all, remember \nthat it’s your game, and this adventure works like salt - \nseason to taste. \nAnd players, everything else past this point is Storyteller material, so if you don’t \nwant to spoil the surprise, read no further. \nMAYDAY! \n"

      "text": "DEPLOYMENT \nPart Two is the most freeform of the adventure’s installments. It’s also the \nmost dangerous: Inter-wraith relations have a tendency to be volatile, at best. \nVirtually all of the events that occur are direct results of the characters’ actions in \nPart One - \nactions that could and should have been influenced by player \ninnovation and character interaction and are therefore unpredictable - \nso only \na few have been detailed for you. Character and roleplaying guided the Circle into \nthe situation it finds itself in at the outset of Part Two, and the way through this \nchapter is, again, through character and roleplaying. \nS U C ~ C ~ E S T I O N S  \nThis installment has a few more new characters than the first one. The most \nimportant character your troupe meets during this game is Joseph Sauvant, a \nHierarchy agent assigned to the Circle’s case. The Circle has a potentially vital relic \n- \nNakagawa’s box of Heretic contacts and plans - \nand the Hierarchy wants it. If \nthe characters went to the Hierarchy for help in Part One, Sauvant is likely to try \nto talk the group into handing the box over. If they chose one of the other options, \nlike the Renegades, he might be inclined to use less diplomatic tactics. Other \ncharacters the Circle might run into are the two Heretic agents within the \nHierarchy who are out to silence the group, Heretic cult members, Renegade leaders \nand Hierarchs trying to preserve order. If you created any or all of these characters \nwhen you played Ambassador, it’s a good idea to use the same ones again. Of course, \nif the characters came from a pre-existing chronicle, you can just brief the players \nand not worry about making any new wraiths. \nThere aren’t many propsfor thischapter; it’s almost entirely based oncharacter \ninteraction rather than the discovery of some new relic. The item cards for the relic \nbox, the wakizashi and anything else you used in Part One should be sufficient. \nS C E N E  ONE \nHard Info: \nThe Hierarchv now knows - \neither because the wraiths told them voluntarilv \nin Part One or through the Hierarchy information network-about the box and the \nfact that the Circle has it. If the Hierarchs don’t have the relic already, they want it. \nThe same goes for the Heretics. However, now that their plans have been \nfouled up (Nakagawa falling into the Harrowing and the box going to the Circle), \nthere are new agents in town. The Heretics listed on the paper in the relic box are \nmembers of a cult with branches in almost every city in the Shadowlands and \nStygia. That cult is now on the brink of being discovered, and the agents have been \nsent in for cleanup and ass-covering maneuvers. Though the Heretics who tried to \ntake the Circle out for “knowing too much already” in the first installment of \nMayday! failed (if your Circle made the choice to approach the Heretics), these \nnew agents are here to finish the job. \nWhat’s really going on here? Now is when you, as Storyteller, find out. The \nJade Empire has been planning to invade Stygia, with the help of the covert Heretic \ncult, for some time now. The characters are at ground zero for the invasion of their \nNecropolis. No matter what the characters do, this attack is going to happen, and \nit’s going to happen on a fixed schedule: one day after the characters first receive \nthe relic box from Nakagawa. This timetable should absolutely not be immediately \nobvious to the players or the characters. They should be able to figure it out - \neven \nthe radar controllers at Pearl Harbor had all the signs right there at their fingertips, \nafter all - \nbut the Storyteller shouldn’t just hand it to them. \nM I N D ’ S  \nB Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n"

      "text": "Choices: \nCharacters can attempt to investigate the Heretic cult further. They \nmight try to infiltrate it or pump information from other wraiths, or they might \ngo about spying from a more arcane angle. The amount, nature and veracity of \nthe information they get is up to the Storyteller and Narrators, but keep in \nmind that the invasion plot is carefully guarded and will not be divulged at all \nlightly or willingly. \nIf the characters have already gone to the Hierarchy or if they choose to go to \nthe Hierarchy now, they can attempt to help in the investigation of the cult, \nassuming they've convinced the legionnaires to mount one in the first place! \nVarious Social challenges and extensive roleplaying should be called for, as the \nHierarchy is extremely suspicious of the characters. \nThe Hierarchy has a few bad apples in its barrel. Two Heretic cult infiltrators \nhave made it into the ranks and they work actively, though subtly, to keep the \ncharacters from getting involved. They will do their utmost to quash any investi- \ngation the Hierarchy might launch. \nHeretic cult agents tail the Circle. The characters have to work extremely \nhard to find out about the surveillance, much less do anything about it. Characters \nmight attempt to mislead the spies or they might use a more direct approach and \nconfront the agents openly. Of course, the fact that there are cult spies following \nthe Circle makes infiltrating the Heretic cult considerably more difficult. \nIf the characters chose to \ntake refuge with the Renegades \nin Part One, they might get in \ngood with the Renegade lead- \nership. Careful prodding and \ndemonstrations of trustworthi- \nness ought to earn the \ncharacters some information: \nNakagawa's disappearance was \nnot random. The Renegades \nhad enough foreknowledge of \nthe invasion to not only re- \nsearch the Jade wraith's Fetters \nbut to arrange to have one of \nthem - \nthe teacup - \nde- \nstroyed in order to send him \ninto a Harrowing and, with \nany luck, keep the invasion \nfrom happening. \nSocial and status-related \neffects of this chapter are po- \ntentially \nprofound. \nHierarchy-affiliated Circles \nmight gain status and per- \nhaps a more tangible reward \nfor their help. Groups ap- \npealing to the Renegades for \nprotection and support might \nstrengthen their alliances \nM A Y  D AY! \n"

      "text": "and open channels to new sources of support - \nand gain the severe disapproval \nof the Hierarchy while they’re at it. Clumsy characters could very easily find \nthemselves on the top of everyone’s shit list! \nDon’t forget the taint on the wakizashi Nakagawa was carrying in his box. \nWhether in the handsof aplayer’scharacter or aNarrator, the potential for Catharsis \nis a strong story line and makes for interesting plot twists. \nThis chapter should end either one day after the Circle obtained the relic \nbox or when the characters have come to some sort of decision about how to deal \nwith the Jade invasion (if they’ve found out about it) or the race for the relic box \n(if they haven’t). \nSo ends this the second installment of Mayday! Look for Part 111: Invasion in the \nDecember issue of the Journal, wherein this thrilling plotline reaches its climax and \nconclusion, after which the Underworld willnever be the same. The following is a “skinand \nbones” cheat-sheet of suggested Traits and a background sketch for Joseph Sauvant, the \nHierarchy agent assigned to retrieve the relic box from the Circle. \nTHE \nI N V E S T I ~ A T O R  \nT H E  SKIN \nSauvant was a patient and obedient French soldier, in life. The only thing \nhe lacked was ambition; he never managed to rise above the rank of private even \nthough he had the ability and the raw skill to go much further. His civilian life \nwas quite similar: He loved a woman, but not enough to marry her; he had a few \nfriends, but no special comrades. Only his mediocrity and his desire to do better \nbrought him to the Shadowlands when, long after he had left the army, he was \nkilled by a thief. \nNow, Joseph Sauvant is a careful wraith, dedicated to doing his job thoroughly \nand well. At the moment, his job is to get Nakagawa’s relic box and all the \ninformation contained in it from the Circle and take it back to the Hierarchy - \nand he uses whatever means he deems necessary to get that job done. If the \ncharacters managed to convince the Hierarchy to listen to them in Part One, they \nfind Sauvant persistent and rational in his attempts to convince them to hand over \nthe box. In any other case, Sauvant demonstrates exactly what made him a good \nsoldier: relentless attention to his task. He might comer the characters and verbally \nbrowbeat them. On the other hand, he might comer them and physically browbeat \nthem - \nhey, whatever works. \nT H E  BONES \nPERSONAL \nINEORMATION \nName: Joseph Sauvant \nLife: Soldier \nDeath: Random violence \nNature: Follower \nDemeanor: Bravo \nRegret: Never having made anything of himself \nM I N D ’ S  E Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n"

      "text": "TRAITS \nTRAIT \nM A X I M U M S  \nChangelings have the following Trait maximums for their Social, Mental and \nPhysical Trait categories: childlings 10, wilders 12, grumps 16. Please note that any \nbonusTraits gained from a kith‘s Birthrights (sidhe Awe and Beauty, trollTitan’s Power, \nyou name it) and only their Birthrights may allow them to go over these limits. Thus, \nit is possible for a grump to have upward of 18 Traits in certain rare circumstances. \nWILLPOWER \nUSAGE \nThis system should be updated in keeping with other games. A Willpower Trait \nmay he spent to gain a retest against (not ignore the results of) a Social or Mental \nChallenge, including supernatural powers that rely on such challenges where it’s \nappropriate. Willpower may also be used to replenish Traits in one category (Social, \nMental, Physical) only once per session. \nMERITS 8 ELAWS \nWhy were so many Birthrights &a Frailties made into Merits & Flaws? \nThis is one of the most frequently asked questions about the The Shining Host. The \nidea behind this innovation was to show how the various cultures of the world have shared \nelements of their mythologies over time, and thus how some rare faeries have come to be \na blend ofdifferent legendary traits. For example, in some cultures, bogam also have sharp \nhearing and keen eyesight in addition to their craftsmanship ability, and many legends \nspeak of dread redcaps who possess the strength of ogres. These unique Merits &Flaws were \nthus designed to allow a character to show the gradual evolution of the fae as they spread \nacross the world, not to min-max a character into some mythical Ultimate Changeling. \nTrue Faith (7 Trait Supernatural Merit) \nTrue Faith was accidentally omitted. See Laws of the Hunt, page 92, for details \non Trw Faith. \n(A cautionarynote -True Faith is rare to beginwith and evenmore rare among \nthe Fair Ones. A player should have a wery good explanation to give the Storyteller \nfor how his character came by such an unusual state of mind for the fae.) \nOverconfident (1 Trait Personality Flaw) \nThe Negative Traits indicated in the text of this Flaw are the Impatient and \nGullible Negative Traits, which eshu possess naturally; a character still gains the \nTrait value of the Flaw, naturally. \nCharmed Life (5 Trait Supernatural Merit) \nOnce per session, the Storyteller may alert the player to a hunch his character \nhas about a particular situation (You get the sudden impression that going down that alley \njuuuuuuuust might be a mistake). In other words, the character gets a spooky feeling \nbefore something happens in game, thus giving him the chance to change his mind \nor rethink his strategy. An important use of this capacity allows the character to \nnegate a combat situation before it starts in order to prevent it or make it come out \nbetter than it would have if the character were to enter it unaware. If the character \ninitiates the situation anyway, he can’t back up events or change his mind if things \nturn out badly for him, because of a hunch he had about the first outcome. No \ninformation is retained about events that did not happen thanks to this Merit, and \nno one but the Charmed character benefits from this Merit. \n(Note: This Merit can be extremely powerful, and it should be used no more than once \npersession, ifeventhatoften.

      "text": "A R T S  \nS O V E R E I G N  ( PROTOCOL) \nPlease note that this Art means that if the cantrip is successful, the target may not \nbreak Protocol for the court occasion in any way unless he spends a Willpower Trait. \nIf Protocol is cast on an area by using the Scene Realm (as is commonly done at a \nfreehold), any who wish to break Protocol within the boundaries of the cantrip must \nbeat the caster in a Static Social Challenge for every disobedient action they wish to \nperform. Characters may also spend a Willpower Trait to cancel Protocol for them- \nselves (but not the rest of those characters present). Note that in either case the caster \nwill know that Protocol has been challenged but not necessarily by whom unless the \nrebellious character makes it obvious. \nREALMS \nS CE N E  \nAs this Realm was constructed for an average-size area of play, such as the ground \nfloor of a house, the numbers for this Realm may need some doctoring to make it useful \nin larger settings, such as conventions. Feel free to manipulate the numbers to make \nthe Realm work in your game, though Storytellers should take care to maintain game \nbalance (somone crisping everyone in the game with a single Pyretics strike tends to \nmake for a lot of unhappy players) and that the numbers won’t run the Storyteller \nherself ragged trying to keep up with the scope of players’ magics. When in doubt, use \nthe names of each level of this Realm (Closet, Guest Room, Ground Floor) and your own \ncommon sense as your guide. Changeling isn’t about yardsticks, after all. \nBANALITY \nUSING \nACTIVE \nBANALITY \nAGAINST \nCANTRIPS \nThe phrasing in the rulebook makes it too easy to abuse invoking Banality as a \ndefense against Kithain cantrips. It is therefore recommended that Storytellers limit \nthe characters who are able to actively use Banality in the following ways: First, \ncharacters who have been enchanted by a changeling cannot actively invoke their \nBanality - \nthey’ve been taken along for the ride, whether they like it or not. Second, \ncharacters must be at least vaguely aware that something out of the ordinary is being \ndirected at them - \na mortal orderly chasing a pooka may use his Banality if the pooka \nbeginsscreaming gibberishand pointingat him, but he cannot doso ifthepookasimply \nsits in acomer, staring into space. Finally, some troupes may wish to rule that characters \nwho have invoked their Banality to try to cancel a cantrip and failed may not attempt \nsuch a defense for the remainder of the scene, as the characters’ disbelief has been \nshaken too badly to serve them for the time being. \nCANTRIPS \nRETESTING CANTRIPS \nOverbidding is a perfectly legal means of retesting a cantrip - \nafter all, what \ngood are Bunk Traits unless they can help in the possibility of an overbid, too? \nHowever, assume no Ability-related retests are possible unless the cantrip specifi- \ncally allows them - \nin other words, no ‘‘I use Subterfuge to retest my Chicanery \npowers.” Advanced troupes may elect to allow Ability retests of cantrips if the player \ncan explain how the Ability directly relates to the cantrip’s use. In order to avoid \nendless retests and other entanglements, it is recommended that beginning troupes \nrestrict retests to overbidding, the House Eiluned Boon and defensive Gremayre uses. \n"

And for \nthose of you who are new to the publication, let me take a second to acquaint you \nwith just what you’ve got here. \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gaps in your \nWhite Wolf LARP environment. We offer rules for new character types, original \nstorylines to work into your chronicles, guides for keeping your games under control \nand running smoothly and rules updates you won’t find in any other Mind’s Eye \nrelease. Plus, you’ll find answers to the questions that have plagued your chronicles \n(Why are so m n y  Changeling birthrights changedinto Merits and Flaws in The Shining \nHost!), original World of Darkness fiction and columns from those who’ve been \nthere (wherever there is) and survived to tell the tale. The Journal is packed with \nfacts and guides that expand upon what’s published in the MET books. \nIn this issue, we have a chat with the spokespeople of two of the largest live- \naction roleplaying organizations in the world, look into some of the legwork that goes \ninto setting up a successful, long-running LARP chronicle and delve into the \nparticulars of creating Nunnehi changelings for MET’S The Shining Host. And \nthat’s just a sample of what’s in store for you here. We’ve also got an Oblivion \nadventure that will rock your whole shadowed world, a look at how MET has \nchanged since its inception and more. \nIn future issues, we’ll look into one of Atlanta’s own oldest and largest indepen- \ndent LARP organizations, ways to keep problem players under control, a word or two \non the state of MET from Cynthia Summers (the Mind’s Eye developer here) and \nanything else you might need to round out your live-action chronicle. \nAnd you can help make the Journal even better. Send us letters on your \nopinions about the state of live-action roleplaying today. Send us questions about \nthe features and rules you see here and about the broken rules you might come across \nin different MET publications. Send us horror stories of games gone wrong and how \nyour players’ characters fixed them. We’re interested in all aspects of live-action \nroleplaying, and we want to know what you think. \nStick around. The Journal is on the cutting edge of the live-action genre; we’ve got \nsomething for everybody. And if we don’t have it yet, let us know. We’ll get it for you. \nCarl Bowen, Developer \ncarlawhite-wolf. corn \nWhite Wolf \nAttn: Mind’s Eye Theatre Journal Developer \n735 Park North Blvd, Suite 128 \nClarkston, GA 30021 USA \n\n\nTHF CURRFNT \nT H I N K I N G  \nJ \nAh.. . conflict. If nothing else, that’s what this section is here for. Sort of a cross \nbetween a round-table discussion and a WWF cage-match, this is the place to hash out \nMET issues rangingfiom licensing to rule-brokenness to LARPingstyle . Give me your \nopinions, respond to opinions you see here, bnbe me just to get your name in print, \nwhatewer.]ustkeepitrelativelyclean, andstay offthe badsideofthepeople youdisagree \nwith. After all, that keen-edged rapier wit is designed for each others’ arguments and \nopinions, not for each others’ personal liwes. \nI \nAs this hotbed of conflict and contention (just kidding) opens, we find letters \non all manner of subjects. Live-action gamers are at no loss for words when it \ncomes to their opinions over LARPing (as many of you can easily attest). This \nfirst letter deals with general concerns one finds in any LARP situation, and it \nboils down to mechanics versus gameplay. \nFirst of all, [rules] simplicity is no guarantee of quality. The support of \nroleplaying over mechanics has always been, in my opinion, in the hands of the \nplayers more than anything. The Storytellers in a respective LARP can certainly \nassist or interfere but this is usually secondary. \nI think [creating a character to exploit the rules or benefit from a loophole in the \nrules] makes for odd reasoning to play at all. As a good friend of mine has said a number \nof times, “Why play something you don’t enjoy?” Some people get enjoyment from \ntackling the big boys in-game, from arbitrating odd and complicated rules or from \nsimply playing a Vampire character they know will never be prince. The point is to \ndesign a character that will be fun to play and let the rules concerns come second. \n- \nScott McDaniel \nAtlanta Interactive Theater Storyteller \nThis next letter deals with the issue of crossover games and how well LARPs \nare suited to deal with the unique problems inherent to them. \nI have been playing WoD games for upward of five years, give or take, and after all \nthat time, I’ve finally come to the conclusion that there is not asingle element about one \nline that prevents crossover. In fact, I think that all of the lines belong in the WoD and \ncan be treated as equally important. The only line that has ANY trouble with crossovers \nis Vampire (including Kuei-jin) because of the whole ‘‘I can only play at night” problem. \nThe other four (Werewolf, Mage, Wraith andchangeling) work perfectly well together. \nI am currently running a chronicle that includes everything in it. The only \nrestriction that I put on the players was that they had to play something that could \ndo stuff both during the day and the night. Outside of that, I let them play anything. \nEverything runs together pretty smoothly, too. I’m not going to lie and say it’s easy, \nbut it’s not particularly difficult either. It’s just a matter of taking a little extra time \nand research to put the pieces together. I haven’t had to invoke the Golden Rule \neither, at least not in order to have one “race” be able to function with another. \nSheer “gunslinging” ability isn’t all that goes into a game being balanced. Most \nstarting Garou could wipe the floorwith most startingvampires. But that is definitely \na minor exaggeration on the truth. Not all Garou are Get of Fenris/ Red Talon type \ncharacters. Not all Garou have incredible strength in Crinos. Not all vampires are \n[wusses] when it comes to combat (the Brujah are a prime example, although the \nGangrel and Nosferatu also fight well), and so it is possible, with some Potence, and \n\n\nmaybe a little Celerity or Fortitude, for a vampire to best a Garou in combat. However, \na clever vampire will easily be able to overcome the ferocious Garou with a well \nplaced use of Dominate or Presence, make him go mad and attack his own pack with \nDementation or something equally heinous. Vampires, unlike most Garou, don’t rely \nsolely on power to win their victories. They have more subtle ways of doing things. \nA similar argument could be made for mages vs. vampires. (Provided a live- \naction Mage system even existed, of course.) The mage is actually at a slight \ndisadvantage against other supernaturals in that he can’t just do shit and not suffer \nany immediate consequences. Paradox should keep him in line enough (if he’s smart \nanyway) so that the playing field is level when he deals with other supematurals. Just \nbecause the mage can shape reality doesn’t mean he’s invulnerable, or that his mind \nis made of iron. The vampire still has the options of Dominate and Presence at his \ndisposal. Plus, this time the vampire will potentially be stronger than the mage is \n(and he won’t have to worry about that mage regenerating damage, either). \nSo, in my opinion, the systems [for tabletop and, by extension, live-action] are \nbalanced. Each character type has its own strengths and its own weaknesses. Starting \nmages are not gods, vampires are not wusses, and, despite first-edition rules, \nwerewolves are not indestructible. \nAll that being said, why not cross the genres over? \n- \nGregory Plunkett \nNot written in direct response to Gregory’s letter, though certainly in the \nsame vein, comes this letter from a former Athens by Night LARP Storyteller. \nAlright, here’s my opinion of different participants in a WoD LARP. First off, \ngiven enough time, rules can be created [to translate] any tabletop system. The \nlimitations I see present between the different inhabitants of the WoD aren’t \nmechanical at all. The limitation is also not your ability to get all of these inhabitants \nin one area. Anybody could do so if they created a background rich enough. The \nlimitation, which I think is fundamental, is the fact that once you’ve got all of these \ngroups in the room together with their rules that are easy to use and understandable, \nwhat do you, as a Storyteller, do with them? \nI’m not going to try and say what they “should do” because players always have \na knack for explaining why they’re the exception. However, I’m going to watch as \nthe Garou travel into the Umbra to wage their wars. I’m going to see the mages \ndisappear. The wraiths will never appear except in rooms where others won’t be \npresent. Changelings will do whatever it is changelings do. Vampires will try to \nfigure out who’s in charge and go from there for the rest of eternity. \nEssentially, to do any of the inhabitants justice the game must be focused to \nthem. The Garou deserve their own game for the Umbra alone. Mages deserve their \nown game because the ST’s need to spend their time worrying about Paradox. \nVampires deserve their own game because they’re prone to creating international \neffects. That’s the limitation of these different worlds. They’re so interesting, so \nintricate, so demanding that as an ST trying to create a cohesive game, you \naccomplish nothing by spreading the population out.. .. \nThe writer then went on, a bit later, to expound upon the phenomenon of \nLARPers forming into cliques that appear in games as groups of related characters. \n. . .While I try to make my associations in game as much as I can, I would be lying \nif I said some outside consideration isn’t given. In truth, it doesn’t hurt anything for \nme. Sure, I might suddenly just be ‘buddying’ up to somebody but I think that has a \nreal world image to it. Sometimes, you just start naturally close to somebody. This \nbehavior [in LARPers] certainly shouldn’t be demonized. \n\n\nAs to ‘groups’ of people, well it’s a game and you want to enjoy yourself. \nSometimes you just want to be with your friends and you use the game as a social \noutlet. I’ve got no problem with that. Way back in the day I played this game simply \nsoIcouldspendsome timewithmy friendsandrelax. It’snotso badifamassofpeople \ncome in together, knowing and working with each other. It certainly doesn’t detract \nfrommy rp’ing experience. In the end, I’m not going to go out of my way to draw such \na black and white line between oog and ig. Personally, it’s something that happens \nin LARPs where people are doing their best to have a good time. \n- \nRyan Vila \nAthens by Night Storyteller \nReturning to the idea of character versus wad-0-Traits, Phil Clippinger had \nthis (among other notable bits) to say... \nKnowing too much about the powers of other characters is the fundamental \ncause of Live-Action-MUDding. (I cannot say that I am wholly innocent of said \ncrime, but for about a year I’ve been reformed.) The whole purpose of “Role Playing” \nis that you, as a player, adopt a character’s “role”, and “play” through it in the story. \nWhat defines your character? Is it the fact that he was raised in the slums of \nMontreal by a submissive, weak mother and a father who beat her to alleviate his \nfrustrations from working a dead-end minimum wage job, up until the point that a \nPander embraced you to see how you would turn out? Did he go on to join the Sabbat \nof Montreal, but find that their sadistic, self-loathing ways were only grotesque \nfacsimiles of his mortal father’s actions? When he left them all behind and started \nto wander the United states, did they hunt him? Why did he come to [the city he now \ncalls home]? What are his feelings about the Camarilla? Is he here in hopes that the \nMontreal Sect won’t look for him in a Cam town, or is he inclined to follow the ideals \nof the Camarilla? Or does he see the hypocrisy in this system as well? Are these the \nkind of qualities that define your character? Or is it the fact that he was ghouled so \nhe has Cekrity, Potence and Fortitude, and then he got Embraced so now he’s got \naccess to Thaumaturgy, Dominate, and Auspex, and even gets his generation for free? \nIf you’ve got a good character, you shouldn’t have to worry about your Traits and \nAbilities. And you certainly shouldn’t worry about the Traits and Abilities of others. \nOk, you saw Joe Brujah kick some ass at the last gather. You’re not going to get into \nit with him. That’s fair. Steve and Dave Brujah kicked some ass too. Maybe you \nshouldn’t [mess] with the Brujah on a whole. You don’t know exactly what they \nhave the potential to do, you just know what you’ve seen them do. \n- \nPhil ClippingeI \n\n\nOcean at Cypncc.

As a result, that essay’s in mangled ruins somewhere \nin the overgrown recesses of my hard drive. \nInstead, this time around you get the result of my observations of years of LARPing. \nLadies, gentlemen and Salubri were-rabbit abominations (thank you, Clayton Oliver), I \npresent for your edification and amusement: The Mind’s Eye Theatre Bestiary. \n(Note: This has nothing, nothing to do with the Bygone Bestiary. Anyone who wants \nMET statistics for a Sea Bishop needs to stop playing with his mail-order brine shrimp, right \nnow. Put the Sea Monkeys down and back.. . away.. . slowly.) \nA final caveat: The critters described here are rare but easily identifiable. They move \namong the vast majority of Mind’s Eye Theatre players like killer whales through a medium- \nsized bowl of ramen, instantly recognizable as being something Other. Most games have at \nleast one of these guys running around; some have the full menagerie. To their credit, the \nvast majority ofMind’s Eye Theatre players simply work around these roleplaying menhirs; \nit’s just that occasionally, like the Grand Canyon, they present insurmountable obstacles. \nIn any case, here’s a guide to recognizing these behemoths of the LARP scene, \nincluding percentage in lair and treasure ty- \nerr, is that the legal department on the phone? \nHang on, I’ll be right back. In the meantime, enjoy. \nT H E  \n”WINK \nQuote: I use Forces 3, Entropy 9, Celenty, my twin silwer-handled katanas and my Cnnos \nCharacter Concept Bigger, better, faster, more! Umm, and some more after that! \nAppearance: TheTwinkusuallydoesn’t botherwith much in thewayofcostuming. After \nall, he’s got Massive Cosmic Powers at his beck and call, so he doesn’t need to dress up. When \nyou’re the ultimate force of destruction, you can dress casual and get away with it. \nNatural Habitat: Elysium. w h y ?  Because if the Twink has managed to finagle a way to \nget his Risen Euthanatos MokolE kinfolk character past the local Storyteller (usually by \nform to cut to the front of the line and order a cheeseburger. \n\n\nhitting said, Storyteller on the back of the head repeatedly with a skillet and taking the wobbly \nbobbing motion that results as anod of approval), he knows that someone else has done it, too! \nAnd that someone else might be able to, somehow, in some way, defeat his Immortal Kuei- \njin Diabolist Baali-Tremere crossbreed. Ergo, he’s going to stay where it’s safe. \nNotes: The Twink is motivated by two forces: the desire to avoid character death at \nall costs and the desire to let everyone else know exactly how butch his character really is. \nAs a result, you will often see the Twink using Disciplines left, right and center to do things \nlike open doors, rearrange geraniums and the like. Mysteriously, though, he never runs out \nof Blood or Willpower Traits by doing so. Fascinating. \nT H E  CHAINSAW \nQuote: I kill you. And you. And you. And hey, you, over there -in \nthe green shirt. Yeah, \nI kill you, too. You’re here to read the meter? Screw it, I kill you anyway. \nConcept: To make like Ozymandias, only without all that boring looking on works and \ndespairing stuff, you know? \nAppearance: The Chainsaw exists to kill, and the sheer number of weapons draped off \nhis costume (usually lifted from Clint Eastwood by way of post-Highlander Christopher \nLambert) makes this abundantly clear. Broad-brimmed hats are de rigeur. A rare subspecies \nprefers to use no weapons at all, relying instead on innate powers. Such creatures are thought \nto be the result of Chainsaw-Twink crossbreeding, though reliable reports indicate that \neach partner tries to kill the other immediately after the consummation of such a union. \nNatural Habitat: Chainsaws can be found at the entrance to most games, mentally tallying \nnew players for later identification and extermination. Chainsaws can also be found at the front \nof most Blood Hunts and leading the list of converts during the inevitable “Sabbat infiltration” \nplotline, believing that getting whacked on the head with a shovel grants them a license to kill. \nNotes: The Chainsaw is not evil, merely misguided; he thinks that racking up a body \ncount is a form of roleplaying. He sees himself as the Darwinian scourge of the LARP, \nweeding out the weak so that stronger character concepts may survive and prosper. He fills \nthe role of.. . oh, who am I trying to kid with this crap! He’s a weenie. Get 30 Terrified \nNewbies to gang-tackle him, then steal his stuff. \nT H E  TERRIEIED \nNEWBIE \nQuote: I, umm, I’m not really sure what’s going on, err, umm, so could you, umm, tell me \nwhat, e m ,  oh, never mind. \nConcept: The Terrified Newbie has no idea what’s going on around him. This is \nperfectly understandable for someone at his first game, but this guy’s been doing it for three- \nand-a-half years. \nAppearance: A cape. The Terrified Newbie always wears a cape. Hopefully he’s \nwearing something else underneath it. \nNatural Habitat: The Terrified Newbie rotates on a seasonal cycle (read: every 15 \nminutes) between the check-in table and the deepest, darkest comer of the game site, there \nto quiver in helpless confusion. Occasionally, this lemming-like journey takes the Terrified \nNewbie through actual gameplay, which inevitably screeches to a halt as aresult ofquestions \nlike “Which one is rock, again?” \nNotes: The Terrified Newbie has no actual interest in playing, merely in attaching himself, \nlamprey-like, to some kind soul foolish enough to offer a few minutes to help out. What the \nTerrified Newbie craves is attention, and he will go so far as to self-trepanate to avoid actually \nlearning what’s going on (and thus being forced to do something silly like, oh, I dunno, play). \nQuote: So I based my character -she’s \na Malkavian, you know - \non Elmo. Tickle me. \nT H E  CUTE NUTBALL \n\n\nConcept: Horror wears flannel pajamas with feeties! \nAppearance: Fuzzy slippers and/ or teddy bears. Need I say more? \nNatural Habitat: Cute Nutballs generally prowl the corridorsof agame to see and be seen. \nThey do, to their credit, interact on a regular basis with other players. Unfortunately, most \nseem compelled to use accents straight out of The House at Pooh Comer when doing so. \nNotes: The Cute Nutball often bases her character around the regression motif, i.e., \n‘‘I was Embraced while watching Rugrats” or “I may have been Embraced at age 38, but I \nreally wanted it to happen while I was watching Rugrats.” Many of them are excellent \nroleplayers within a very limited range. The problem is that Cute Nutballs tend to travel in \npacks (or perhaps to generate spontaneously), meaning that the incautious LARPer is liable \nto find himself knee-deep in what looks like vampiric daycare. \nAddendum: The occasional Cute Nutball eschews the pajamas look for schoolgirl \noutfits. The less said of the effect this has on the local pathetic lech population, the better. \nT H E  \nSTORYTELLER’S \nS. 0 .  \nQuote: How much longer is this going to take? Umm, I’m the.. . Seneschal? Honey, what’s \nConcept: If I actually spend my Saturday night doing this, he owes me big time. \nAppearance: Completely and utterly bored. The blase expression generally changes to \na look of sheer panic if it looks like one of those mutant freaks in black is going to come up \nand talk to her. \nNatural Habitat Anywhere but a LARP. With return visits, she risks conversion to \nher S.O.’s cape-flaunting ways, so she’ll do everything in her power to make sure she never, \never comes back again. \na Nosefur Achoo, and why is it trying to get my phone number? \nAnd yes, she’s read Lysistraata. \nNotes: She’s a nice, normal human being with outside interests who’s willing to put up \nI repeat: Once. Try to make her do it more than once and she evolves into a new species, \nwith her S.O.’s weird Vampire habit thingie whatever - \nonce. \nthe Storyteller’s Ex. \n\n\nT H E  \nM.OCKER \nQuote: This isallso h e a n d  pathetic. Running \naround and premdmg you’re uampires. You guys \nhaw no soclal skiUs. Me? Oh, I’m going to go home \nand& “Resident Annoyance” for nine hotm snaiRfit. \nConcept: He don’t need no steeenkin’ \nconcept; he ain’t playing. \nAppearance: The Mocker is dressed like \nmost of the people playing in the game - \nat \nleast, theones withoutcapes.The ironyofthis \ngenerally escapes him. \nNatural Habitat: The Mocker hangs out \nwhere LARPers hang out when they’re not \nplaying, within earshot but often no closer. He \nmakes a point of claiming that he’s standing \nupwind, just to be pushy about the whole thing. \nNotes: The Mocker is often the larval form \nof the standard Player; he generally maintains \nMocker status only so long as he doesn’t actually \nbother to read the books or play the games he’s \nmaking fun of. Once he gets dragged into put- \nting his money where his mouth is, he either \nevolves or finds a new hobby. \nT H E  ONCEAND \nEUTURE AUTHOR \nQuote: Actually, I think the rules for this stuff suck. I’ve written a better system, und it’s a \nConcept: Anything they can do, I’m sure I can do better when I get around to it. \nAppearance: The Once and Future Author is possibly the only species of MET player \ncommonly found in tweeds and/ or mock turtlenecks. Sweaters are a good indicator, as are \nwire-frame glasses, but those are also signs of the Nerdy Tremere (who’s an entirely different \nkettle of clove-smoking, bloodsucking fish). \nNatural Habitat The Once and Future Author is often found in the middle of a flock of \nyounger players, possibly even a nest of luckless Terrified Newbies. What he’s doing there can best \nbe described as “holding court,” as he spins a web of his thoughts on rules modifications and ideas \nthat he’s sure would improve the game immeasurably. What those ideas actually are is a bit harder \nto get out of him; he’s just sure that what he’s capable of coming up with is bound to be better. \nOh, andcheck the local coffeehouse. He’s theone in thecomer with the laptop, playing Solitaire. \nNotes: The Once and Future Author is careful to maneuver himself into delicately \ncontrolled situations. These situations are designed to play up his knowledge of rules loopholes \nand allow him the opportunity to pontificate about possible improvements. Normal, average \nroleplaying situations, however, tend to drive Once and Future Authors off. \nvast improvement. Can you see it? Uh, no, I left it at home. In Montana. Really. \nTHE \nMOMMY/DADDY \nPLAYER \nQuote: So can I take thatpower? The other Storyteller said that it would be OKif it were OK \nConcept: Plllleeeeeease can I have it? I’ll be your best friend! \nAppearance: The Mommy/ Daddy Player is capable of the most astonishing camou- \nwith you! *blink* *sad puppy eyes* \n\n\nNatural Habitat: Under most circum- \nstances, the Mommy/ Daddy Player mingles \nhappily and innocently with the crowd. It’s \njust abizarre combinationofevents that brings \nout his latent mutant powers and causes hu- \nmanity to hate and fear him and send giant \npink robots from the future to destroy his \nexclusive boarding school, and.. . \n... err.. . \n. . .umm. Where was I? \nAnyway, most of the time Mommy/ Daddy \nPlayers are perfectly cool, mingling with the \nroleplaying throngs around them. It’s just that \noccasionally, one catches sight of a power or \nMerit or some other neat gadget that another \ncharacter has that is completely new to him. \nAccording to scientists, this triggers a physiologi- \ncal reaction that causes the M/D P to either swim \nup the Willamette River and spawn or to start \nstalking the local Storyteller in hopes of comer- \ning her and begging permission to add the new \npower to his character sheet as soon as possible. \nUnder most circumstances, the Story- \nteller thus confronted sensibly avoids the \ndecision and sends the M/D P off with a bland “If the other Storyteller says it’s OK or some \nsuch. The fatal mistake the Storyteller makes in this instance is assuming that her \ncounterpart is going to show some sort of common sense and bounce the M/D P on his ear \na few times to see if any brain cells shake loose. Unfortunately, this is when the M/D P’s \ncunning survival mechanism kicks in. \nInstead of going up to the second Storyteller with “Well, Anne blew me off when I \nasked for Master-Class Temporis,” he sneaks up on his prey with “Anne said it was OK for \nme to have Master-Class Temporis if you said it was OK.” In many cases, the helpless second \nStoryteller is taken by surprise and gives assent, which concludes the cycle for the M/D P. \nHe scurries back into play, and it’s left to the Storytellers to figure out what the hell just \nhappened the next time the entire game rewinds six hours. \nNotes: All conversations with M/D Ps should include the word “no” at least three times \nper sentence, more if possible. \nT H E  SCAMMER \nQuote: So, want tog0 back to my place after the gum is w e r d  talk about ourchmacters’ refahhip? \nConcept: I’m a- what clan do those three women in the black dresses play?Toreador? \nOK, I’m a Toreador. \nAppearance: The Scammer often wears fake fangs, dark sunglasses, a white poofy shirt, \npirate boots and a vest of some sort - \nunless the women in the game have demonstrated \na preference for some other sort of raiment. In that case, all bets are off. \nNatural Habitat: The Scammer is a migratory animal, following whomever captures \nhis fancy around all night while attempting to involve her in his plotlines. Since most of \nthose plotlines involve what can charitably be called Naked Coed Blood Bonding, the \nScammer generally spends a lot more time on the prowl than doing anything else. \nNotes: The Scammer can generally be counted on to do whatever the most attractive \nwoman in front of him at a given time tells him to do. The trick is A) to keep him from looking \n\n\nusefuland R) tobribe theobjectofhis temporary \nobsession sufficiently to get her to use her influ- \nence over the Scammer in your favor. \nLook on the bright side. If he weren’t at \nthe LARP, he might be dating your sister. \nT H E  \nRULES LAWYER \nQuote: It clearly states on page 34 of this \nmimeographed galley proof of issue 4 of White \nWolfMagazine thatundercertaincircumstances, \nI can in fact rip out an Antediluvian’s spleen just \nby lookingathimimploringly andsayingthephrase, \n“Your mother dresses you funny.” You didn’t \nknow that? 1 thought everyone knew that. \nConcept: Who’s got time for a concept \nwhen there are rules to memorize? \nAppearance: The Rules Lawyer is often \nnattily attired, albeit never in a way to call \nattention to himself. Often, he can be identi- \nfied by the condition of the books he carries \nwith him; pages with rules advantageous to \nhis character are marked with tape flags or \nstickv notes. Insome extreme cases. the Rules \nLawyer re-binds his books for easier access or simply has them tattooed on his forearms so \nthat he might literally bludgeon the opposition to death with them. \nNatural Habitat: Existing on the fringes of the pack, the Rules Lawyer frequently tries \nto blend in with the rest of the game. He emerges only briefly to debate a ruling or call on \nan obscure optional rule, then submerges back into the herd. \nThe only way to isolate a Rules Lawyer is to challenge him deliberately. This can be done \nby making a call that contradicts some weird Risen-sluagh-kinfolk-usingMage-Spheres kind \nof rule that is near and dear to the Rules Lawyer’s heart. Doing so causes the Rules Lawyer to \nburst from the pack in a frenzy of quotations and finger-pointing, which continues until the \nStoryteller either gives in (just to shut him up already) or has him shot with a tranquilizer dart. \nNotes: The Rules Lawyer honestly believes that adherence to the rules - \nall of them \n- \nis the absolute best thing for the game. He just can’t help it if he knows the rules better \nthan anyone (and that often includes the authors and the developer, mind you) and puts \nthat knowledge into play. Pity he can’t find time to read the sections on giving characters \npersonalities, but hey, something’s got to give, right? \nThere are other recognizable types, of course: The Boffer Basher (who can’t understand \nwhy everyone’s upset at being clobbered with plumbing supplies in Elysium)- \n(Ahem, thank you, Rich.

The Mind’s \nEye Theatre game line has changed quite a bit \nower the years, and it continues to change as new \nthe Hunt: a look at the most current versions of rules for Mind’s Eye Theatre and how they \napply to all of the game lines. This article isn’t an attempt to address specific cases - \nthat’s \nthepurviewoftheFAQsection-but itdoestalkaboutsomechanges thathavefar-reaching \neffects on most, if not all, of the books for Mind’s Eye Theatre. If you’ve got this article and \na Mind’s Eye Theatre book, you should be playing the mmt current version of the game! \nC H A L L E N ~ E S  \nAs described in the various Mind’s Eye Theatre books, a challenge involves a \nsimple game of Rock-Paper-Scissors between two or more people. The victor wins \nthe challenge and accomplishes his desired result; the loser fails in his attempt. \nIn the event of a tie, challengers check their appropriate Traits. Thus, in a Mental \nChallenge, both participants check their number of Mental Traits, and the person with \nthe most Traits wins. Use the current number ofTraits! As a playerexpendsTraits (losing \nthem in challenges or activating powers), the character tires out, runs out of confidence \nand gets fatigued -eventually, even the most powerful character wears out. \nIf both sides have the same number of Traits, the win goes to the defender, but \nboth parties lose the Traits they bid. \nRETESTS \nSeveral different factors allow for retests, Abilities, overbids and special powers \namong them. In general, though, retests all have the same effect. \nA retest can be called only when a player loses a test - \nif you win a test in \ncombat, you cannot use your Brawl Ability to retest and do the same thing again, for \nexample, even when supernaturally compelled. When a retest is called, you lose the \nTrait(s) you bid in the initial test (mark them off immediately) and then perform a \nnew test. If you lose the retest, you still lose the challenge. If you win, you still lose \nthe initial Trait(s) you bid, but you win the challenge. In a tie, compare Traits as \nnormal, but remember that you lose the Trait(s) you bid for the initial test. \nA retest called by use of an Ability expends the Ability automatically, regardless \nof the outcome of the test; if you fail to punch someone and call for a retest with Brawl, \nthe Brawl Ability is expended automatically. Conversely, a retest called with an \noverbid does not expend the overbid Trait automatically - \nyou only lose the overbid \nTrait if you lose the test. Note that calling an overbid requires only one Trait, even if \nyou are injured or were otherwise forced to bid more than one Trait on the initial test. \n\n\nArctest maybecanceledasdescribed inLawsof theHunt. InacasewhereinanAhility- \nbased retest is called by your opponent, you may cancel his retest automatically if you have \nat least two more levels in that Ability than he does. Thus, if your opponent calls for a Brawl \nretest in combat but has only one level of Brawl Ability, you may expend a level of the Brawl \nAbility to cancel his retest completely if you have at least Brawlx 3. If you and your opponent \nhave the same amount of current Brawl Ability, or if your current Ability is less rhan your \nopponent’s (ornottwolevelshigher), thenyoucannotcance1hisretest;youmustwaitforthe \nopponent’s retest and then expend a level of your Ability for a retest of your own (if the \nopponent’s retest succeeds). Thus, with high levels of Ability, you can completely prevent a \nless skilled opponent from turning the tables on you. However, if you are evenly matched, \nthere is always achance for luck and a little bit of skill to intervene. Note that a cancellation \nmaybedoneonlywithalike Abilityorpower: IfanopponentcallsforaretestwithBrawl, you \nmust cancel it with your own Brawl or Meke Ability, not with the Merit: Luck (for instance). \nA given source may be used as a retest only once on any particular challenge. \nA character with Brawl x 3 cannot use Brawl multiple times for retests on a single \nchallenge, but he could use Brawl followed by Luck. Certain powers end a challenge \nautomatically, and no retests may be called after the use of such powers. \nMASS COMBAT \nMass combat involves multiple attackers assaultingone defender. Insuchcases, \nthe first task is to determine who’s attacking whom and how. The original rules for \nmass combat, revised and elaborated here, make mass combat much more dangerous. \nAmass attackoccurswhenup tofive peopleassault one targetwithsimilarmethcds. \nThus, if five people all attack one vampire (using swords, stakes and torches), they \nconduct one mass challenge. However, if different forms of assault were used (a shotgun \nfromone attacker but aspell from another) then eachdifferent form of attack- Physical, \nMental or Social - \nwould be handled as a separate challenge or mass challenge. \nIn a mass challenge, the defender throws one symbol (rock, paper, scissors or aspecial \nsymbol allowed by certain powers) while each attacker throws one symbol ofhis own in the \nsamechallenge. EachattackerbidsoneTrait (orenoughTraits toenteronechallenge), and \nthe defender bids enough Traits to engage in challenges with every attacker; if the defender \nhas insufficient Traits, he may choose the attackers against whom he wishes to defend. The \ndefender compares his symbol to every attacker at the same time, then resolves each result \nsimultaneously: Losing three tests and winning two causes the defender to lose three Traits \nand suffer all of the results of losing to the three victorious attackers. If the defender \ncounterstrikes, he may choose to affect any one attacker whom he defeated in the mas \nchallenge. Retests should also be made together, but each patty must bid enough Traits to \ncover all targets; thus, the two losing attackers in the previous example could bid one Trait \neach to retest, and the defender would have to bid two Traits to retest against them bth, \nresolving the retest as a second mass challenge. \nWILLPOWER \nDifferent Mind’s Eye Theatre books give different rules for what can and can’t \nbe done with Willpower Traits. The most consistent set of rulings to date is listed \nhere, along with the reasons why certain changes have been made. \nWillpower can be used to refresh all Traits in a single Attribute category \n(Physical, Social, Mental) once per category per session. \nWillpower cangrant areteston aSocialor Mentalchallenge, ifthe Storytellerfeels \nthat Willpower would be appropriate to the challenge. Acharacter cannot simply ignore \nthe effects of such challenges with Willpower; that would nullify the use of many special \npowers (“I ignore your Presence with a Trait of Willpower, then hit you four times with \n\n\nclaws.”). Similarly, certain challenges are not appropriate for expenditure of Willpower; \na Willpower Trait should be used only on Mental and Social Challenges to resist \ninfluence or injury. “I expend a Willpower Trait to retest your Auspex challenge against \nmy Obfuscate” is not an appropriate use of Willpower, since the cloaked individual \ncannot simply will himself to remain better hidden from the character with Auspex. \nHowever, Storytellers must decide for themselves which types of challenges permit this \ndefensive use of Willpower and which do not. By default, Willpower Traits provide a \ngeneric retest on a Mental or Social Test, once per challenge. \nA Willpower Trait cannot be used to win a Static or Simple Test automatically, \nconsidering that many special powers and effects are predicated on such tests. Allowing \na player to (for instance) expend two Willpower Traits and automatically win the two \nfollow-up Static Challenges to stake a vampire through the heart unbalances play. \nA Willpower Trait can be used to ignore all wound penalties up to and \nincluding Incapacitated for one challenge and one challenge only, including all \nretests made as a result of the challenge. \nUsing a Willpower Trait allows a player to attempt an action that would \nnormally require an Ability not possessed by the character. Thus, the player could \nspend a Willpower Trait to try to disarm an alarm even if the character does not have \nthe Security or Science Ability. The Willpower simply allows the player to make the \nattempt. However, success is not guaranteed. \nT I M E  \nThe inexorable press of time in Mind’s Eye Theatre games breaks down into \ndifferent segments to approximate the durations of various powers and events. \nN O R M A L  \nT I M E V E R S U S  \nCOMPRESSED \nTIME \nFor the most part, Mind’s Eye Theatre games run in normal tine - \nthe amount \nof time passing in the real world equals the time passing in the game. Thus, if a player \nwanders about the game site, talks to a few other players and has a drink (taking up \nan hour of time), then an hour passes in the game as well. \nUnder some circumstances, though, the game shifts to compressed tiw. The resulting \nphenomenon is called (in the vernacular) a ttme-hubbk. In compressed time, game events do \nnot actually take as long to occur as the real world dictates. Thus, if a series of tests takes five \nminutes toresoLveonetumofcombat,thentheplayersinvolvedinthetumhaveexperienced \ncompressed time - \ntheir characters have had only five seconds of game time pass. \nMoving from compressed time to normal time can be tricky. The best solution \nis to assume that the extra time is taken up overseeing wounds, helping allies, getting \nback to the game site or attending to other minor details. Thus, if several players in \ncompressed time take two hours of real time to finish a combat, but only pass a few \nturns in the game, then it’s best to assume that they return to the game site two hours \nlater, having rested, driven to the appropriate location and so on. \nMEASURES \nO F  T I M E  \nA turn is the brief amount of time needed to use a quick special power or to make \na single attack against someone. In general, a turn lasts five seconds; most characters \ncan take a single action in one turn. A Narrator may choose to make a turn last as long \nas a minute depending upon circumstances, but a turn is usually just a brief interval of \ntime. Laws of the Hunt states that a turn takes fourseconds, but considering that many \npowers work in intervals of five seconds, the latter is a more sensible time frame. \nA conflict comprises several turns. If a player involves himself in a series of \nchallenges with multiple individuals, unbroken by changes in time, space or events, \n\n\nthissegment oftime is oneconflict. Anexample ofaconflict is asingle combat between \ntwo sides or a series of tests as a character in a car tries to pursue a fleeing opponent. \nAs long as the tests continue to resolve a single outcome (finishing the combat, chasing \nthe enemy, conditioning the mortal, etc.), the incident is a single conflict. A conflict \nis assumed to last 10 minutes if an absolute scale of time is necessary, although this \nestimate may be extended to account for a particularly long conflict. \nA series of conflicts makes up a scene. As long as the characters pursue the same goal \nwithln a given perid of time, they are within a particular scene. Thus, a coterie of vampires \nfighting against its Sabbat foes would have a conflict for each battle fought, but the series of \nbattles taking place in one graveyard would comprise a single scene. A scene is assumed to \nequate to one hour of time; powers listed as “lasting for a scene” end when the scene ends (in \nthe previous example, if the players left the graveyard or slept for the day) or when an hour \nof time elapses in normal-time play. Thus, if a player invokes Encrrmcement on someone for \nascene, the targeted individual remainsentranced until the game markedly shifts locationand \ntime, until areal hour haspass edoruntil the conditio ns for brealung the Enrrancement are met. \nOne session generally results from an evening’s play. A session usually includes \nseveral scenes but may only be one. Most game sessions last several hours in real time. \nA session has no predetermined time; when in doubt, assume that a session lasts from \nsunrise to sunset (or vice versa) for game purposes. For ease of tracking Traits and the \nlike, a session ends when all of the players go home for the evening, and it begins \nwhen they come back again. At conventions or locales in which a game proceeds \nconstantly for several days, assume that each session is comprised of one day and one \nnight (the Storyteller should decide in advance if the session breaks come at sunrise \nor sunset). For most games, a session is simply the monthly or weekly game night. \nAstory is the result of several sessions developing a coherent plot. A story can be told \nin asingle session, but it is usually the result ofseveral interlinked sessions. The conclusion \nofamajt)rplotline,be itthedeathofacharacter,theresolutionofaproblemorthechanging \nof a tradi tional event or thing, marks the end of a particular story. Certain Traits and powers \nlast for the duration of astory or can be used only a certain number of times in a given story. \nFor ease of record-keeping, Storytellers may simply decide on a particular calendar break \n(at their discretion) as the refresh date for such powers, allowing them to update all game \nparticipmts regularly instead of having to track diverse time arcs with different Traits. \nFinally, a chronicle is the tale of many characters and settings spun together through their \nstories. As long as a game continues with the same characters, places, rules and events, it is \nprobably a single chronicle. Multiple threads resolve themselves, and numerous stories may \nend in the COUR of a chronicle. Like a series of books or movies, the chronicle is the overall \npicture ofwhat’s happening in a particular part of the World of Darkness. Any given game can \nbe considered a chronicle in its totality; that is, the chronicle changes when the Storyteller \ndecides to start a new game, possibly with different characters, changed rules and new goals. \nLOOK IN^ AHEAD \nObviously, as the Mind’s Eye Theatre game system continues to develop, new rules and \nnew problems will crop up. The changes mentioned here may not be good for all time. \nHowever, intrcducing these corrections now should go a long way toward correcting some \nof the more blatant difficulties in the Mind’s Eye Theatre system - \nwe’ll admit it, we’re \nhuman (more or less), and mistakes do occasionally creep in. When in doubt, use the most \nrecent sets of rules published; every METbook takes steps toward amore coherent rules base. \nIfyou like the new additions you see, don’t hesitate to integrate them into your existing games \n-after all, the fact that Military Influence wasn’t written into Laws of the Wild shouldn’t \npreclude you from adding it to your own! As always, this journal serves to keep players and \nStorytellers informed. Watch this space-we have new ideas, suggestions and input coming \nall the time, some of it even from dedicated players out there (like you). \n\n\nAT HOMF WITH THF \nCAMARILLA \nby Jenn Kellam \nDirector of Public Relations for the Camarilla fan organization \nand simple purpose: to show \n(who don’t know) that they \nand that LARPs are not ins \nings ofgaming-community patrons wtha \nj7ar for actmg. Both the Camarilla and \nOne World by Night ( a m g  the mny, \nmany such orgamzatlons) mke hwe-actiun \ngaming a global neighburbod, as well as \nWhether you are hammering nails onto a new roof for Habitat for Humanity \nor hammering nails into the coffin of your character’s nemesis, the Camarilla, \nWhite Wolfs official fan club, is here to build a community. We frequently refer \nto ourselves as an organization of garners for garners, and it is this community ideal \nto which we aspire and grow. Based on the concepts of education and leadership \ntraining, the Camarilla gives people new skills, new friends and one heck of an \nexciting world-wide game. \nThe Camarilla is anon-profit organization based out of Salt Lake City, and our \npurpose is threefold. First, we strive to provide acontinuous world-wide live-action \ninteractive theater game based upon White Wolfs World of Darkness - \nmore \nsimply put, a LARP. We utilize several e-mail lists and a host of volunteer \nStorytellers to run this game. The chronicle has been in place for six years, and it’s \nstill running! This October, the entire organization of the Camarilla came together \nto solve a complicated and deadly plot that affected the whole chronicle, some- \nthing never seen before! Over a year of plotting and work went in to create the \nhorror and the complexities of the plotline we lovingly refer to as the “Vorosja \nDebacle,” and all Camarilla players will continue to feel the fallout for years to \ncome. It is just this kind of long-term chronicle that the Camarilla promotes. \nOur second goal is to promote community service and civic involvement. \nThis effort gives our members a sense of personal accomplishment, as well as \nreminding our communities that garners are people who are just as concerned and \ncivic-minded as their next-door neighbors. Over the years, we have hooked up \nwith the Red Cross, the Special Olympics, AIDS research, shelters and tornado \nand flood relief, and we have donated thousands of hours to helping out in our \nlocal communities. \nOne of the Camarilla’s funniest stories comes from an auction we hosted. A \n---LA- +id a rather large sum of money, and the auctioneer began to argue with \nier, insisting that this was real money and not in character money. The \n\n\nargument continued until the member walked forward with a personal check for \nthe amount mentioned. Everyone involved in the donation began to laugh and \ncheer as the auctioneer’s jaw hit the floor. The story spread like wildfire, and that \nyear many children at the Shriners Hospital were given another chance at life. \nOur last and most important goal is to provide our members a good time, in \ngame and out. We have been asked to host the openings of movies like Blade and \nMen in Black while dressed in costume, we have raised the Elder Gods in Call of \nCthulhu LARPs, we have participated in One World by Night and Liquid Dreams \nLARPs and we have danced down the trods with our Changeling Storytellers. We \ntry to promote events that everyone would be interested in or would like to be \ninvolved in. I guess the most important thing to mention is that we strongly \nencourage new and old members to go to their officers with their ideas for events \nand work on putting them together for everyone to enjoy. \nOne region rolled some of the objectives of the Camarilla together into a day \ncalled the “Garou Moot and Pool Party Barbecue.” In character, members playing \nGarougot together to celebrate the summer solstice. Everyone had fun as they tried \nto convince the Red Talons to get in the pool and get a little wet! I also heard \nrumors of members having a lot of fun during a weekend at a regional game and a \nday at Six Flags over Georgia with members from several different states! There is \nsomething in the Camarilla for everyone, and that is what we are all about! \nThe Camarilla began in February of 1992 In Seattle, Washington. Jana \nWright and Matt Burke made an all-important phone call to White Wolf to find \nout if there were any fan club organizations for the new Vampire game. The answer \nwas no, and thus began the Camarilla, White Wolfs fan club. The concept of the \nclub was that it existed for people who not only enjoyed the game but pursued other \ninterests that would fit within the Gothic concept. It was also at this time that the \nfirst members named our magazine Requiem, and they have watched it grow from \na simple newsletter into the quality production that it is today. In March of 1992, \nat Nonvescon, the first members handed out flyers and an interest sheet to find out \n__ \n~~ \n~ \n-~ ~ \n~ \n\n\nif such a club had potential. Later that year, at Vikingcon, the first members of the \nCamarilla made their entrance in the public eye and hosted the first meeting of the \nfounding members and Inner Council. \nIn April of 1995, Heidi Preuss became the President of the Camarilla, and its \nheadquarters moved to Salt Lake City. Since then we have grown from an \norganization of 1,400 members and one e-mail list to a thriving organization of over \n4,000 members in 1 1 countries world-wide. We host over 190 e-mail lists to support \nour diverse interests, including humor lists, creative writing rooms, in-character \nlists and forums for education, debate and announcements. Internet Relay Chat, \nor IRC, is also a tool that the Camarilla utilizes frequently in order to promote the \nglobal game as well as host online meetings with members all across the world. \nRequiem has turned into a magazine with a color cover, glossy pages, excellent \nwriters and fabulous artists. Every Camarilla member can enjoy any of these above \nbenefits, as well as a 20% discount on all White Wolf materials purchased directly \nfrom White Wolf, a membership handbook filled with wonderful ideas for the \norganization of chapters, and access to the members-only section of our website, \nwhich hosts many pages of information and educational materials. Over the years, \nwe have grown stronger and learned more about running a club with such diverse \ninterests as ours. \nAt this point, it is probably best to explain how the Camarilla’s communi- \ncation lines and hierarchy are built. The Camarilla is organized with our purpose \nin mind. First of all, the club maintains two lines of officers: the Storytellers, who \nare in charge of the games, and the Coordinators, who are in charge of keeping \nthe organization functioning. We decided to organize things along these lines to \nbetter relieve stress upon any single person. A Storyteller who does not have to \nworry about making sure that the rooms are secure and paid for, keeping the \nmembers happy out of character, taking care of the newsletter, and securing \nfuture game times is free to Dlan for the eame and the in-character events. A \n\n\nCoordin,Ltor who does not have to worry about the Sabbat raid tonight, the \ncharacter histories due for review or the outcome of a cross-regional Influence \nbattle is free to plan next week’s birthday party. Almost every level of the \norganization utilizes a balanced team of Coordinators and Storytellers working \ntogether for the enjoyment of all members. \nThe most important part of the organization is the individual person. Thus, \nlocal members maintain the basic organization and flavor of their own chapters, \nand this feeds into the personality and cohesion of the organization as a whole. If \nlocal members want to create a chapter dedicated to creative writing and critique, \nthe Camarilla helps them set their chapter up that way. If they wish a chapter \ndedicated to hosting or attending troupe games, we help set their chapter up that \nway. Each chapter is in charge of its own identity under the ideals of the “Chapter \nStrong” philosophy of the Camarilla. Most chapters are active participants in the \ninternacional global game, and most utilize the Storyteller-Coordinator partner- \nship method to organize their officers. \nAt the base level, then, are local chapters, with the Coordinator and \nStoryteller in charge of organization. Chapter-level games are the most prolific and \nform the bulk of the Camarilla’s chronicle. Chapters are also the closest social \ncircles, hosting such things as weekly Buffy parties, after-game get-togethers and \ndonation drives. \nNext up is the domain level. The domain is an organization of several chapters \nin one city that have set their groups up to work together. The domain may host \ncitywide games, promote citywide service events or host a domain party and get- \ntogether. This level of the organization helps in large cities. It breaks up the chapter \nofficers’ workload and builds \ncontinuity and an extra level \nof communication for the \nmembers. The Domain Story- \nteller hosts the larger games \nand is in charge of weaving all \nthe plots of the chapter games \nintoasingleunifiedstory.The \nDomain Coordinator main- \ntains the newsletters, secures \ngame sites, opens and main- \ntains lines of communication \nbetween chapters and orga- \nnizes the occasional domain \nservice or social event. \nNext, the United States \nis divided into eight regions. \nEach region is headed by a \nRegional Coordinator and \nStoryteller. TheRegionalSto- \nryteller weaves all the \nsanctioned domain and chap- \nter storylines into an even \nlarger unified plotline. The \nAT H O M E  \nW I T H T H E  \nCAMARILLA \n. _\n_\n_\n~\n~\n-\n~\n \n_ _  \nQD \n-~ \n\n\nRegional Storyteller will also send down regional plotlines to the local levels so all \nthe members of the region can become involved in the larger game of the \nCamarilla. The Regional Coordinator hosts regional conventions, puts out news- \nletters, hosts service events and organizes the occasional regional social event. The \nRegional Coordinator also has the task of ensuring that lines of communication \nremain open between all the cities and states in the region. The regional officers \nare the liaisons to the Board of Directors. In this way, board officers can ensure that \nthe regions are receiving important information through their officers. \nCountries outside the United States organize themselves along lines appropri- \nate to local laws and customs. They maintain close communication with the \nCamarilla offices in Salt Lake City and weave their experiences with the learning \nof United States players. We grow and build with each other out of character, and \nin character. People across the oceans have found friends and pen-pals. Some \npeople have even traveled long distances to finally meet those Camarilla members \nwhom they had only seen as writing on a screen. One member published the \nchronicle of her trip from the UK to Italy as she visited Camarilla players along the \nway. This really helped to bring United States members an understanding of their \nfellow gamers overseas. \nFinally, the board of Directors organizes the vision and inner workings of the \nCamarilla. Eleven Directors work year-round to produce the quarterly magazine, \nthe Requiem, promote the Camarilla at conventions such as GenCon and \nDragoncon, organize the annual International Camarilla Conclave convention \n(ICC), educate, promote community involvement and so much more. The \npresident heads the board and maintains a managerial view of the functional \nworkings of the organization. The Master Storyteller weaves together the plotlines \nof the regions and the international games and passes down national and intema- \ntional storylines for the various games. The MST is also in charge of rules \nclarification and supplement creation. \nThrough it all, small projects are always cropping up. These projects are often \nthe ideas of general members (and they are spearheaded and run completely by the \npeople who brought them up, with minimal Board advisement) or they are ideas \nbrought together by the Board itself. The appropriate member of the Board gathers \nteams to complete the project in a timely manner. These teams often include \npeople from all around the globe. In this way, the hierarchy of officers actually \ncreates a circle of communication and education. Each person lends a talent and \nability to the other members, and everyone is encouraged to keep anopen mind and \nsense of willingness, because there is always going to be someone out there who has \nsomething to teach you or a new way of doing something better. \nIn the future, the Camarilla looks to further our relations with White Wolf, \nsolidify the continuity of the international game and organize informational \ndatabases of member information. We are in the process of creating a MUSH, we \nplan to further tabletop gaming activities, upgrade our magazine and promote \n' itions with other LARP organizations to expand the community of gamers for \niers. Some of our biggest interests are our continuing good relationships with \nmedia and local government organizations-there is so much to do and become \nolved in! And it involves everyone from the individual members to the board \nIirectors. In the Camarilla, everyone is responsible for ensuring that the games \nI the events all run with our Five Real-Life Traditions in mind: \n\n\n1. \nSteadfastly follow the policies and Code of Conduct of the Camarilla. \n2. \nBe courteous and cordial. Solve problems, don’t create them. \n3. \nP1aysafe:don’t touch, nostunts,nodangerous props.Nodnnkingandnodrugs. \n4. \nCompliment, don’t criticize. \n5. \nHave fun! \nThe most noted aspect of the Camarilla is the six-year-old sanctioned \ncontinuity of the global game. We utilize White Wolf books and materials, \nfocusing our efforts on creating a shared World of Darkness. Any official chapter \nof the Camarilla can become a part of the continuity. Once this happens, players \ncan join a tapestry of shared events and political maneuverings and lend their own \ncharacters to become a part of the hunting, posturing and manipulations of the \ngame. We support Vampire, Werewolf and Wraith, and our Storytellers recently \nadded Changeling. \nThe Camarilla, taking its lead from White Wolf, has separated our venues to \nsupport a game that more closely resembles the World of Darkness. We host \nCamarilla/ anarch/ mortal, Sabbatl mortal, changeling, Garou/ Kinfolk/ Bet6 and \nwraith venues. On the rare occasion that they happen upon each other, the venues \ndo cross. The Influence game, which is very strong in the Camarilla, crosses all venues \n-mortals can learn of careless Kindred through an Influence war. In Chattanooga, \nTennessee, Camarilla members play common mortals slowly becoming pawns in the \nlives of the Kindred. The game has an X-Fiks feel, as the players’ mortal characters \nare immersed slowly in the global continuity of Kindred and Garou games. \nAs you can tell, we support all manner of games. It is important to note that there \nis a difference between sanctioned games and troupe games. We do host and promote \nseveral troupe games. These can be anything from a game that uses our rules and creation \nsystem but stays outside the continuity to a “God Game” in which everyone plays a \nMethuselah and attempts to kill the others off until there is only one left. We encourage \nmembers to attend LARPs hosted by organizations that are not a part of the Camarilla. \n\n\nWe are currently in the process of developing a functional and easily workable \nmethod to create a sanctioned White Wolf tabletop continuity. In the meantime, \nwe do engage in general tabletop gaming within our chapters. Members encounter \nthe World of Darkness, Cthulhu and his Miskatonic madness and traditional \ndungeon crawling in ADBD. \nCamarilla members have even taken board games \nsuch as Talisman and Star Wars Monopoly and created chapter and domain \ntournaments! We also enjoy participating in more active games like touch football \nand ultimate frisbee: One region frequently challenges its domains to fight it out \non the frisbee field or basketball court! \nOver the years we have endeavored to participate more and more in conven- \ntions on a local and national level. In 1998, several local chapters hosted events such \nas demonstration games or community service booths at local conventions. Nation- \nally, the Camarilla participated in GenCon and Dragoncon. We met many \nwonderful people at these conventions and managed to meet other LARP organiza- \ntions. At GenCon, we met One World By Night and wore its “Bite Me” buttons in \norder to participate in its LARP as mortals. (Ofcourse, we did get together with other \nmortals and attempted a mortal uprising against the oppressive tyranny of the \nvampires.) At GenCon, we met the creative members of Liquid Dreams, an all- \nSabbat LARP in Atlanta. We also met many of the members and coordinators of \nSabertooth, a Vampire organization in New York. It was amazing to make all these \nconnections and realize that we are all a part of a much larger community. \nMany regions host regional events every few months. These events usually \nencompass entire weekends during which the region rents out a hotel. During that \nweekend, members host several tabletop games, a weekend-long sanctioned game, \nhow-to lectures and regional member and officer meetings, as well as organize a \ndealers’ room. In the dealers’ room are exhibits from local non-profit organizations \nand local shops and artisans. White Wolf occasionally puts in an appearance to \npromote the most recent publication in the Mind’s Eye Theater product line. One \nregion has had such success with one hotel that the managers proclaimed the \nCamarilla one of the nicest groups they have worked with and left us with the keys \n\n\nto the hotel and the owner’s home number in case of emergencies. They invited \nus back. for next year. The Camarilla is trying its best to promote gamers and the \ngaming community as a group of responsible and fun-loving adults. \nNationally, the Camarilla has put together a convention that we lovingly call \nICC, or the International Conclave of the Camarilla. The first year of the \nconvention was 1996, and it was hosted in Houston, Texas. Every year the \nconvention has grown by 30%. It consists of four days and nights of LARPing, \ntabletop gaming, a charity auction, meetings for officers and members, open board \nmeetings, parties, dancing and, of course, a well-used booth from White Wolf. We \nhost it every year during the week before Halloween. It is a time when members \nfrom literally all over the world come together and renew friendships out of \ncharacter and pursue the hunt as Garou or seek the demise of a centuries-old enemy \nas vampires. This year, in Salt Lake City, we added our Changeling and Wraith \nvenues. We also had a surprise when Fox Television showed up to videotape us for \ntheir newscast! It was really amazing to walk through the halls and hear people \ncalling to each other and introducing new members. Over 550 people from all \naround the globe attended this last convention, and we are expecting that number \nto grow even larger in Portland in 1999 and Cleveland in 2000! \nThere remains something to be said about the creativity of the members and \nthe family created by the Camarilla. Our members are writers, students, lawyers, \ndoctors and rocket scientists. We are ro!eplayers and community members. We \nare old and young, we are tall and short0 we are a little bit of everything. I have \nseen members come in off the streets and turn their lives around. I have seen \nchapters get together to raise money to help defray medical costs for a member \nwho is sick. I have seen members find other members jobs. I have attended \nparties, weddings and graduations and welcomed new babies home. Members get \ntogether to write stories and articles, create works of art and take amazing photos! \nThe Camarilla is about bringing in the innate talents and abilities of every \nmember and sharing them with each other to create a community, write a story \nand bring about a little change. \n\n\nIE IT r’s Broke \nFrom time to time in a live-action roleplaying environment (especially one in \nwhich numerous characters are involved), things get out of hand, and characters \nmake decisions that get everyone in their respective societies in a great deal of \ntrouble. Vampires break the Masquerade; Garou endanger the Veil; changelings \nblow the rights of the Escheat right out the window; waiths violate the Dictum \nMortuum. But what’s to be done when the thought ofhaving to push that big, ugly \nRESET button looms! This column hopefully serves as a gukkline. In each \ninstallment, you get the problem plus the solution (all of which come out of real \ngaming experiences). \nHow NOTTO \nTHROWA \nMUSIC EESTIVAL \nT H E  PROBLEM \nIt all started reasonably enough. A Sabbat troublemaker had been dropping \nhints of his whereabouts to the local Camarilla-loyal denizens of [Anycity], GA. He \nhad been taunting the prince and primogen council shamelessly, and the prince had \nfinally dispatched a small coterie (including a Tremere, a Malkavian and a Gangrel) \nto find this vampire before he did some real damage to the Masquerade. Following \na tip, the coterie tracked the Sabbat to a side-street in Atlanta adjacent to the site \nof the Music Midtown Festival. \nDodging through a crowd that had gathered to taunt and out-shout a local street- \npreacher (one of Atlanta’s many), the coterie closed on the Sabbat’s position. They \nspoke to said rebel, but he was not content to stay put. Drawing the three along, he \nmoved closer to the crowd (a crowd which drew in the people leaving the Festival just \ndown the street). When he had led them to the center of the crowd, the Sabbat sprung \nhis trap, designed to shatter the Masquerade in downtown Atlanta. Without warning, \nhe uppercut the Malkavian, sending the hapless Lunatic flying across the street and \nover a row of parked cars. The Gangrel leapt at the Sabbat, Wolfclaws gleaming in full \nview, and missed. He sailed through the air, trying to catch himself, but only managed \nto draw 10 deep rents into the hood of a parked car before rolling into the people- \npacked street. The car’s alarm went off, and those pedestrians who hadn’t already \nnoticed (or bolted like sheep from) the commotion all turned to stare agape. \nBut it was the action of the Tremere that really stuck in their minds. Thought \nhe was too stunned to move when the formerly talkative (even genteel) Sabbat first \nattacked, the Tremere regained his wits as his two companions fell in short order. He \nstepped into a clearer line of sight with the Sabbat and enacted the Thaumaturgy \npower Theft ofvitae. As the Sabbat gasped in unexpected pain, a viscous red torrent \nleapt from his body to the outstretched hand of the Tremere. Suddenly rethinking \nhis goals (he’d done more than enough already), the Sabbat turned his supernatural \nprowess to self-preservation. Disappearing at inhuman speeds, he carved a path \nthrough the throng and out of sight. \nAt which point, of course, all hell broke loose. The rowdy, milling crowd scattered \nin panic (those who still could, anyway), and even the vociferous street preacher \nturned tail and fled with the sinners. The fleeing people collided with the ones spilling \nover from the Music Festival, all shouting about what had happened. Aghast, the three \n\n\nCamarilla-loyal vampires slipped away (under the woozy Malkavian’s power of Cloak \nthe Gathering) as sirens began to push their way to the scene. \nTHE \nSOLUTION \nNaturally, when word of this fiasco got back to the prince of [Anycity], said prince \nwas not happy. Shattering the tranquillity of Elysium, he gathered every Kindred in \nattendance. He commanded everyone present to pool every last resource available to \nthem (every dollar; every ounce of Influence) and work toward quashing the problem. \nIn the end, the following Influences came to the fore: \nChurch \nFinance \nHigh Society \nMedia \nPolice \nStreet \nAnd how did the unlucky Camarilla vampires use these Influences? Inshort, the \nvampiresused each to create and cement a plausible (ifnot highly likely) cover story, \nreasoning that an outlandish believable story would have a much greater impact and \nwould be more memorable than an outlandish unbelievuble story. \nThe cover story stated that, in the late hours of the Music Midtown Festival, an \noutspoken fire-and-brimstone street-preacher had taken it upon himself to bring light \nto the eyes of the baleful sinners of Atlanta. In so doing, however, he had shamelessly \nlain about with accusations of exactly who was a sinner and why, and (in his own \nspectacularly undiplomatic idiom) he had managed to start a small-scale race riot. \nHowever, merely saying a thing is never enough to make it true, and it took the \ncollective Influence of every [Anycity] Camarilla vampire to make it a reality. The \nMedm and Police Influences went out almost immediately to clear up the public and \nofficial record of what happened. A plant inside the area police department was \ndispatched to monitor incoming eyewitness reports and either lose them entirely or \nalter them in such a way that the supernatural violence reported was toned down to \nthe level of monstrous human violence. Those vampires with eyes in the local public \nmedia maintained a vigilant watch on live videotape submissions- thus curtailing the \nrelease of anything directly incriminating- as well as calling many different broadcast \nstations and newspapers with false scoops on the story the Kindred wanted to see put \nforward. Some of the Police Influences also went into having the incriminating car \ntowed away and destroyed. (One generous vampire even used a Bureaucracy Influence \nto see that the human auto-owner’s insurance company paid the salvage cost.) \nFinance, Church, High Society and Street all went to backing up the public and \nofficial view of the story once the Kindred had gotten it out. The vampires used Finance \nand Street to bribe various “eyewitnesses” to speak to the police and local news \nbroadcasters. The Church Influences coerced local churches from all around Atlanta \nand [Anycity] to issue press releases condemning the wayward street-preacher who’d \nstarted the whole mess and to offer any sort of community aid in their power. Similarly, \nthe High Society Influences were used to cajole a similar series of press releases from the \npromoters, performers and subsidizers of the Midtown Music Festival. \nDue to the vampires’ quick reaction and blanket Influence-spending, the story \nthey wanted heard quickly became the official story. As for the coterie of vampires \nwho let the situation get so far out of hand in the first place.. . well, let’s just say that \nthere are some horrors in the World of Darkness that are best left unspoken. \n\n\nO N €  WORLD \nThis article, and Jenn Kellam’s, serve a pure \n1 \nandsimple purpose: toshow live-actiongamers a \n(who don’t know) that they’re not alone \nand that LARPs are not insular gathenngs \nof gaming community patrons with a jkzr \nfor acting. Both the Camarilla and One \nOne World by Night (OWbN) is just that - \none \nOne world of volunteers who form a grassroots not-for-profit organization of \nloosely knit chronicles spanning the entire globe. \nOne World of opportunities for our members to play their home-chronicle \ncharacters at games just a few hours away, in many of our neighboring cities or in \nfar-flung exotic places like New Zealand or Brazil! \nOne world of emphasis on a story that is meant for the enjoyment of the \nplayers, giving them whatever pleasures it might. \nOverall, One World by Night is a not-for-profit organization dedicated to \ncreating links between Mind’s Eye Theatre games around the world. By combin- \ning the various stories of its member chronicles, OWbN hopes to enhance its \nmembers’ enjoyment by expanding local plots to the global level, truly creating a \nWorld of Darkness. \nWell, so much for the glib introduction ripped straight from our website. \nAllow me now to sit back, sip at my glass and tell you a little bit more about us than \nyou might find on the Internet. \nFirst, allow me to introduce myself. My given name is Duncan Wyley \n(although most of my friends call me Dunx), and I’m the Head Coordinator of \nOWbN (strangely, often pronounced “Obi-Wan” - \njust don’t tell Lucas). I \nhave been in this position for about a year by the time you read this. Before that, \nI spent about two-and-a-half years Storytelling in my local chronicle, during \nwhich time I discovered the pack that I now lead. And before that were about \n17 long years of gaming. \nOver the course of this year or so, I have met, via the Internet, some of the \nsharpest minds and finest gamers it has been my privilege to know. During my \ninvolvement in the development of an organization of this scale and scope, these \npeople have taught me many things. Primarily, they have shown me that there is \na large number of enthusiastic people who believe in the development of our hobby \non a grand scale. No longer content to restrict themselves to one city, these people \nwish to encompass the world in their passion. \nworld. \n\n\nroleplaving and live theater in the people involved in our hobby. And we’re having \nsome fun along the way! \nOWbN would like to grow, and we are still accepting and processing \nmembership applications at present. Our website at http://www.owbn.com has \nmore information for readers who might be interested ... c’mon, you know you \nwant to. \nBwa-hah-haaa! Soon ve shall rule za verlt! \nNo, seriously.. . We’re working toward becoming an expansive community of \ncamaraderie and roleplaying. In some small way, we are contributing both to \nourselves, in terms of fostering plots and friendships, and to the gaming community \nas a whole, in terms of growing awareness and acceptance by a number of social \ngroups. Many of our players are involved in the business and social communities \nin our respective towns and countries, and the friends we make in these organiza- \ntions come to accept that what we do is a harmless pastime. In both ways, our hobby \nis fostered. This is, in my opinion, a Good Thing. \nTo ensure our enjoyment, we’ve constructed an organization that is easy to join \nand participate in, with only a few restrictions to keep things comparatively sane. \nOne World isn’t a hierarchy that costs our chronicles anything to join or stay \nwith. The main thing we ask is that our chronicles emphasize stories that are meant \nfor the enjoyment of our players -we hope that any players who may travel from \naround the world will be enraptured by and entrapped within the intricacies of \nanother shadowy comer of our One World. \nWe’re not a small group of individuals that changes your chronicles to suit its \nwhims. OWbN’s founding idea is that all games have a great degree of autonomy \n- \nessentially, as we put it, “your game is your game.” This philosophy has yielded \nus a veritable melting pot of styles and personalities. With no central overriding \ntheme and no dominant personality other than trying to be generally receptive to \nall styles of games, we appeal to all types of garners. \nWhen we encounter situations that involve crossover interaction between \nchronicles, we encourage the Storytellers of those chronicles to communicate and \nelaborate the plots for the enrichment of both (or all) the games involved. \nWe are not some industrial bureaucracy that forges and legislates its \nchronicles into carbon copies of one another; chronicle-diversity is essential. We \nall build upon one another - \ngood ideas spread, and bad experiences are shared \nin order to keep other chronicles from facing similar problems. Individuality is \nthe heart of our organization. \nOne World isn’t limited. The only limitations are the ones we place upon \nourselves and the ones required to administer the organization. With the addition \nof each new chronicle, we add to the experience, wisdom and creativity necessary \nto expand and enhance the ever-unfolding story that is our One World by Night. \nHmm ... Perhaps a little background is in order. \nOne World by Night started in Chicago, Illinois, USA in March of 1994 at \na local roleplaying convention by the name of Concentric. \nHey, neat! We’re five years old this year. Maybe we should throw a worldwide \nparty or something. \nAnyway, a game was held between a local gaming group in Chicago and \nanother group from Indianapolis, IN known as The Beautiful and the Damned. After \n\n\nthe convention, the game never ended. The convention’s plots were incorporated \ninto the new Chicago game (started by Mario Bonassin), and the original storyline \nfor One World by Night was born. \nThe Chicago game grew quickly as the players played within the Excalibur \nnightclub, the actual model for the Succubus Club of White Wolfs Chicago by \nNight. In addition to Chicago players like Dave Gill, other non-Chicagoans joined \nthe game. John Flournoy was running the Lafayette game at Purdue University, IN, \nand among his players were two students from the East Coast, Bill Hyatt and Rich \nDevine, two of our first Head Coordinators. When some of these players left for \ntheir respective home cities, the idea of an intertwined World of Darkness arose. \nOne night at a Chicago game in the top floor of a bar called the Morseland, \nDave Gill and Bill Hyatt put forward their ideas for a shared game, though it would \nbe unlike either the Camarilla or the Shared Universe system. The focus would be \na shared story, not shared rules. Bill had the exact same idea and even had a name \nfor the concept. The first Midwest shared game was created between Lafayette, IN \nAfter about three months, Bill and Rich went back to NVA and we thought \nthe game would end. On the contrary, our little experiment proved that a shared \ngame was possible but that it needed work. It needed a charter so that all the \nStorytellers would know what they were getting into. The charter needed to \noutline clearly that your game would remain your game and that no one would stop \nyou if you wanted to go through the entire rulebook and rewrite it (as we all did \nseveral times over). But goofy-ray-gun-wielding Mummies were not in any way to \nhave a part in the shared story. \nBill, who had named One World by Night, became the Coordinator, creating \na web site and acting as a contact for other games. He talked to people about our \nproject and marketed the organization’s focus - \n“your game is your game.” \nWe soon recruited Jake Holub and the San Francisco delegation, both of \nwhom are with us still. We became national, spanning coast to coast, in a matter \nof a few months. \nConcentric ’95, in March, was the first OWbN Conclave, at which we \ndiscovered how different our rules really were and polled the players to find out \nif they wanted some universal rulings. The answer was an overwhelming \naffirmative. Not only were they telling us that they enjoyed being a part of the \ngame but also that they were confident and comfortable with us making these \nuniversal decisions. \nGenCon ’95 was the organization’s first officially sanctioned event (although \nit was not officially part of the convention) and the first meeting of the chronicle \nrepresentatives. This was the first occasion upon which we firmly decided on some \nof the articles that now comprise most of the charter rules. No chronicle would be \nallowed to act against or outside of these rules, for we believed that we had the plan \nfor creating a successful network of LARP chronicles. From these Articles came \nwritten hints and models for starting a successful chronicle, optimum conditions \nand where to look for renting sites. OWbN had created a kind of manual for \nrunning your own game and keeping it afloat. \nSince then, OWbN has grown to encompass over 60 chronicles, mostly in the \nUSA and Brazil. Other countries, such as Spain, Brussels and New Zealand, also \nhave member chronicles. \n\n\nWe recently ran another convention LARP at GenCon ’98, the world’s \nlargest gaming convention, held annually in Milwaukee, WI. The attendance was \nphenomenal, exceeding 240 players. \nThe latest event was the Mid-Atlantic Conclave, held in Baltimore at the end \nof October. It involved the cooperation of three different games in the area, a \nmonumental feat of organization that was pulled off flawlessly. Characters and \nStorytellers from 13 different chronicles from California to Chicago to New \nZealand attended. \nThat’s right - New Zealand. That little agricultural country. That’s where I \nlive. I had a great time. \nBut I digress. \nOWbN is administered primarily through a series of coordinators and council \nmembers drawn from the various chronicles. Each chronicle has a voice on the \nCouncil through its council member, who is selected by the players and Storytellers \nin that chronicle. The council member is responsible for representing his chronicle’s \ninterests, keeping the Council apprised of any situations of regional or interna- \ntional significance that may arise, and voting on any matters that may come up in \ncouncil, such as the admission of new chronicles to OWbN. \nCouncil Members are also primary contact points (alongside the Storytellers) \nfor other chronicles wanting information or updates on current plots in their local \nchronicles. In most cases, council members are also Storytellers (although this is \nnot always the case) and can give immediate answers - \notherwise they direct the \nquerent to the appropriate person or ask the question on the person’s behalf. \nVoting itself is a simple matter - \nin most cases, a proposal to the Council is \npresented and (hopefully) seconded. A period of discussion is allowed and then a \nvote is called. Each chronicle is allowed one vote, as are the HC and AHC. \nGenerally, a majority of the received votes will indicate the proposal’s success. \nThe Council also votes on applications for chronicle membership, and the \nAdmissions Coordinator may cast a vote in the case of a tie in these situations. \n\n\nWith the continued expansion of OWbN, we slowly refine our internal \nmanagement processes. This year should see some very progressive steps in this \ndirection. The improvement of our operations should streamline a number of issues. \nA set of coordinators is elected each November to hold positions of specific \nresponsibility in OWbN. \nThe Head Coordinator (HC - \nme) oversees the entire operation of OWbN \nand is assisted in the task by, naturally, an Assistant HC. Alongside these two, an \nAdmissions Coordinator tracks new applications to OWbN and keeps tally of the \nmembership. These three people form the core of OWbN’s administrative team for \nout-of-character issues. \nThe HC is primarily responsible for overseeing the progress of OWbN as an \norganization, for dealing with matters arising in regard to the OWbN Charter and \nfor maintaining some sort of order amid the chaos. The HC also assesses disciplin- \nary situations that may require OWbN’s attention and dispenses advice to \nchronicles as requested. If he’s a good boy, he gets a pat on the back occasionally. \nHe (or she - \nalthough we are yet to see a woman be insane enough to stand \nfor the position, I believe, so please forgive the male pronoun) is also responsible \nfor supervising the other coordinators as a group. He selects the coordinators each \nyear (subject to a verifying vote of confidence for each by the Council) and thus \nhopefully assembles a team that can work together for the betterment of the games \nin general. \nThe Assistant Head Coordinator (Joyce Summers) is responsible for main- \ntaining the sanity of the Head Coordinator by dealing with the administrative \nminutiae of OWbN, such as voting procedures. This year will see the further \nexpansion of the scope of this position to encompass maintenance of and regular \ncontact with our more distant chronicles and assistance with the redevelopment \nof a number of our organizational systems. \nMatt Giezentaner, our Admissions Coordinator, and I will continue to \nreceive and assess the initial admissions applications to assist new and existing \nchronicles in their applications to One World by Night. Matt is available for \nconsultation with anyone considering joining OWbN and can answer most \nquestions you may have or direct you to someone who can. His contact information \ncan be found at our website. \nSpeaking of which, OWbN is strongly tied to the Internet as a primary mode \nof communication. There’s no way I’d be running it if I had to pay for all those toll \ncalls to the States every time I needed to see what was going on. \nSo if you’re interested in joining up, please bear in mind that you will need \npeople in your group who have regular access to the Internet - \nat the very least, \nyour council member must be able to receive Council mail. \nOWbN has a number of e-mail lists that allow for quick and easy communi- \ncation between our members, in or out of character. This system provides another \nlevel of interaction, a challenging and informative method for players to share in \nthe loves and lives of each online character’s shadowy existence. \nMany players access these lists daily, and there are some people we just can’t \nshake off the Web. \nWe’ve found that this sort of international interaction has really helped \ncharacters in their recognition of each other and encouraged cross-chronicle \n\n\ninteraction - \neven if it is just traveling across the entire country to give a rowdy \nRavnos a Puissance wedgie. \nAll chronicles are also strongly advised to have a website and to (try to) keep \nit updated with the latest news and game information so that others in the area can \ncheck out when they can attend their neighbors’ games. Keep a copy of your house \nrules there as well so potential visitors can read up on the local variances to reduce \ninterruption in the flow of the game. \nMoving on.. . \nAs OWbN has grown, the need for specific clan coordinators has developed. \nAt present, OWbN has coordinators for the more specifically structured clans - \nAssamite, Giovanni and Tremere. This concept may soon be expanded to \nencompass other clans. Additionally, we have a coordinator for Sabbat activities \nand another for the Garou players. As OWbN continues to grow and different types \nof chronicles join in, the structure of OWbN will adjust appropriately. \nAdditionally, to centralize and control the flow of information and clan \nactivities, we have coordinators for each of the seven Storyteller-controlled \njusticars. These people act as clearinghouses for the various and nefarious wheelings \nand dealings of these ancients, and they give many of OWbN’s players a focus for \ntheir gameplay - and they instill appropriate fear in the characters. The \n“JustiCoords” maintain regular contact with the Storytellers of OWbN as required \nand assist in resolving plot issues involving their offices. \nWe generally keep the justicars’ actual appearances at games limited to \nconclaves. Archons or secretariats to the justicars are preferred forms of Camarilla \nenforcement if intervention or contact is required. Recent events in the OWbN \ncontinuum have seen a marked increase in the number and caliber of archons \nappearing in Camarilla domains. The death of Xavier, until recently the justicar \nfor Clan Gangrel, has obviously shaken the heretofore impervious justicarate, and \nthere is visible evidence of its unease. \nTherefore, OWbN has an infrastructure that exists to support all the people \nand characters associated within. Storytellers have access to many other Storytell- \ners to be inspired by and to inspire. Players have access to thousands of other players \nto interact with, plot with and generally breathe life into what we call our One \nWorld by Night. \nWell, that’s pretty much how we run the organization, but you’d probably \nprefer to hear about the chronicles. \nOWbN is dominated at present by Camarilla-based vampire games. There are \nexceptions to this - \na few games are primarily Sabbat or Garou in focus, a couple \nare anarch in nature, and some games mix’n’match genres. \nThe primary rulebooks we use are The Masquerade Second Edition and \nLaws of the Night. Other books see inclusion as the Storytellers see fit and as \ndiscussed by the Council -for \nexample, some aspects of Laws of Elysium are \ngenerally considered in OWbN to be restricted to Storyteller characters rather \nthan open to players. OWbN’s vampire games are directed primarily at the \nyounger Kindred. There are restrictions on the play of true elders and on some \nof the types of Kindred permissible in any chronicle - \nfor example, True \nBrujah or Salubri. Similar rules will apply to other supernaturals as they are \ndeveloped and enter OWbN. \n\n\nVariants on the White Wolf MET rulebooks are permitted within \nreason. We recommend that chronicles stick fairly closely to the White Wolf \nproducts so that there is some internal consistency in the way the game is \nplayed. It was very pleasant to find that most of the rules I encountered in \nChicago and Baltimore worked much the way they work way over here in \nHamilton. Variations in the interpretations of the rules also opened my eyes \nto the possibilities of other interpretations that I hadn’t considered. I never \nclaimed to be a rules lawyer, but I found some of the ways the systems were \nplayed very educational. \nNever discount a learning experience. Most of our people are happy to share \ntheir ideas, and though we have our fair share of squabbles over some things, any \nidea that might enrich your game or your gameplay is important. Many of our \nchronicles adopt systems from others in OWbN. \nWe hope to expand our horizons beyond Vampire. With the release in 1998 \nof a number of White Wolfs MET products, we now have a considerably greater \nscope with which to work, play and flourish. This will involve some changes in our \ninternal structure, but we bid Flexible on that matter. \nOur Garou coordinator, Krissy Ryan, is working busily on further integration \nof Garou chronicles into the fold. As I write this, we’ve recently welcomed another \nGarou game. The Kenosha: Bad Moon Rising game had been playing alongside \nKenosha: The Eternal Aria for some time and was gladly given admittance, as the \nplayers had played by OWbN rules for some time and had remained in regular \ncontact with OWbN both in and out of character. This put them in good stead \nwhen their game’s number came up. \nAt present, Matt and I are discussing the possibility of adding a Changeling \ngame. We’re not averse to a Wraith game joining in, but we foresee some \ndifficulties with character interaction because of the Shroud. We’ll cross that \nbridge when we come to it, I guess. \n\n\nIn numbers, our games range wildly and widely. Some chronicles have less \nthan a dozen people; others number around a hundred regulars, including \nvisitors from nearby games. We don’t have an accurate count of our total \nmembership, but estimates place us at over 2,000 players in over 50 games in \nsix different countries. \nAt present, OWbN is slightly fractured because of language barriers between \nsome of our chronicles. With the advent of translation sites on the Internet - \nmy \npersonal favorite is http://babelfish.altavista.com - \nI hope to see much of that \nbarrier crumble over the next year, and it should encourage a broader scope of \ninteraction all around. \nOWbN tries to hold at least one conclave a year. In 1998, we held two fairly \nlarge conclaves (Chicago and Baltimore) and ran a huge game at GenCon in \nAugust. These games are organized by enthusiastic teams of Storytellers with too \nmuch time on their hands and too much caffeine in their systems. More large \ngatherings of this nature are in the cards for 1999, although details are still being \nworked out. We’ll post all upcoming major events on our website. \nIn between such events, players are often road-tripping to other cities just for \nthe hell of it. Just traveling between OWbN cities is an experience in itself - \nmeeting new people both in and out of character and experiencing the unique \nflavor of a new game can often prove a refreshing and eye-opening experience. \nTravel the world, see the sights, play a little Vampire and make a lot of new friends. \nAnd you don’t necessarily have to travel to other games to affect them - \nemail communications and expenditure of Influence or use of city contacts \nthrough the Storytellers can have as much of an impact as being there would. \nIt has been my personal pleasure to attend the two American conclaves this \nyear, and I am proud of the efforts of all concerned in the organization and \nexecution of the events. I would like at this time to formally thank all of you who \ninvited me and forked over for the plane tickets.. . twice.. .. \nI’m still humbled by that experience. \nSome of our chronicles are also in contact with various independent games \nin their areas. Though our official stance is that these games don’t necessarily \nexist in our continuity (at least, until they join OWbN, he smiles), we in no way \ndiscourage our people from talking with other games and other groups. After all, \nwe don’t have all the answers to all the questions - \nwhy limit our opportunities \nto learn? \nOWbN is developing a good relationship with White Wolf, and we are \npleased to have been of assistance in the past in terms of playtesting and \nopinion. A few of its staff are on hand, either as friends or accomplices, and we \nacknowledge the help that they have given us in the past. We hope to continue \nthis productive and convivial friendship in the future. I guess the opportunity \ngiven me to write this article means we must have some degree of respect in \nWhite Wolfs eyes (heh). \nOWbN is perhaps very reflective of the World of Darkness as given us by \nWhite Wolf. We don’t slavishly follow the books as written in terms of Storyteller \ncharacters or sourcebooks (or our Milwaukee and Chicago games would be very \ndifferent if we did), but are instead working on our own continuity, using many of \nthe White Wolf sources to fill in the gaps. \n\n\nAs an example, we took the opportunity in 1997 to echo the 13-year meeting \nof the Inner Circle to change several of the justicars. Clan Toreador kept Madame \nGuil, who originally appeared in Diablerie: Britain, and Clan Malkavian kept \nJusticar Lucian, a character from the card game. The Ventrue opted to choose Tai \nPan Robert Pedder as their next lawmaker. Other than those characters, the other \njusticars (Masako, Clan Brujah; Kharel, Gangrel; Ctarinov, Nosferatu; Malaphar, \nTremere) were created within OWbN to fill the positions. \nNew concepts presented by White Wolf (such as the many alterations to the \nWoD as presented in the revised edition of Vampire: The Masquerade) are \ndiscussed by the Council and the Storyteller teams before anything is introduced \nto the mainstream of the games. However, OWbN’s in-character politics do have \na natural progression that is becoming very similar to a number of things that \nWhite Wolf has presented. \nSo what’s happening in One World by Night as the millennium approaches? \nSome Kindred truly believe the Final Nights are drawing near as the numbers \nof the Caitiff grow and the clans of the Camarilla become more fractious each week. \nThe elders seem aloof and uncaring, the justicars play unknown games behind \nclosed doors, the Sabbat is around eachcorner- in many cases well rooted in place \namong its unsuspecting opposites. \nMeanwhile, the Garou struggle to preserve their heritage as their own enemies \nplant themselves more securely than ever in the cities and drive the werewolves \nfrom their cairns. Their war against the Wyrm continues unabated. \nThe Gangrel ofAmerica face desperate times as their elders are slowly stripped \nfrom them by negative forces. The loss of many of their elders in recent times has \nshaken the Gangrel’s dedication and loyalty to the Camarilla. \nClan Brujah struggles to remain a cohesive whole, its members torn between \ntheir loyalties to the Camarilla and to their clan. Browbeaten by their elders and \ntongue-lashed by their anarch brothers, their loyalty also sways. \n\n\nClan Tremere fights to maintain a united front while dealing with public \nridicule and suspicion. The Tremere often find themselves leaned upon to provide \nsolutions to matters of the supernatural and then discarded unceremoniously by \nthe other clans once they are no longer useful. \nClan Ventrue endeavors to stand proud and aloof as certain elements \nundermine its efforts at dominance- the prevalence ofventrue princes in the Old \nWorld is far from echoed in the New, an embarrassment at best. \nThe Nosferatu ... well, nobody really knows what they are up to, but there is \nsome evidence that they may be closing ranks for some reason. \nThe decadence of these last decades has distracted many of Clan Toreador. \nHas true art died with the rest of the world? Many of them ask that question in this \ntwilight of the Muses. \nAnd the Malkavians? What of them? They’re changing, but from what and to \nwhat? Who can tell, anyway? \nOWbN is set in the modern day, very much so. Many of our chronicles utilize \nthe real world’s activities as tie-ins for their plots. Our players are enthusiastic and \nenergetic and many small plots spill from city to city. Mix in a little Storyteller \nmagic and our World of Darkness comes to life. Would that I could tell you all of \nsome of the awesome plots going on, but I think I’d get lynched. \nWe have our own character personalities developing - \n(1n)famous names \nand coteries, such as the NWO in Baltimore, the First Family in Chicago, the \ndubious House Malice, the dread archon Uma Nottingham, the Legion Sisters, \nMaddy Zurich, Dana Stone, Archbishop Santiago, the irrepressible Malkiepoos.. . . \nThe list goes on, and I could probably talk for hours, but I’m not quite up to \nwriting the sourcebook yet. \nIn closing, I would like to thank Joyce Summers, Matt Giezentaner, Ross \nAnderson and Lance Larsen, among others, for their contributions to this article. \nI’d also like to thank One World by Night - \nthough you motley lot may be a pain \nin the neck at times, you’re all wonderful people this side of the Masquerade. \n\n\nNUNNFHI EOR The \nshininq H O S ~  \nby Peter Woodworth \nConsidering the popularity of Mind’s Eye Theatre’s The Shining \nHost and the resurgence in fascination with Native American culture and \nmythology, I couldn’t think of a better summer feature than one on how to \nincorporate the Nunnehi into a LARP setting. And when Peter Woodworth, \nthe author ofThe Shining Host, agreed to write the piece for me, I jumped \nat the opportunity. \nT H E  PEOPLE \nThe Nunnehi (which means “people who live anywhere”) are the faerie folk \nindigenous to Concordia, having dwelled here many centuries before the first \nEuropeans or their Kithain cousins ever set foot on it. Like the Kithain, the \nNunnehi were torn between two worlds, the Earthly realm and the Higher Hunting \nGround (Nunnehi Dreaming), and they struggled daily to preserve the old ways. \nTo keep faerie spirits alive in those long#ago days, wise Native Americans acted as \nhosts for Nunnehi spirits, allowing them to use their bodies until the spirits were \npassed on naturally to children. Over time, the Nunnehi fire nearly died out, but \na recent surge of Native American pride has done much to revitalize it, and now \nthe Nunnehi Nations stand ready to claim their rightful place once more. \nNunnehi make excellent additions to Mind’s Eye Theatre games that take \nplace in areas of great natural significance, and many of the native fae preserve a level \nof innocence and trust in the natural order that even other changelings lack. What’s \nmore, many of them have grudges and alliances with the Kithain stretching back to \nbefore the days of the Revolutionary War, thus presenting a uniquely historical \naspect to any modem game. Centered as they are on the spiritual world, the Nunnehi \nalso present an excellent change of pace for players used to “typical” Changeling \nstories -or an excellent challenge to motleys who think they’ve seen everything the \nDreaming has to offer! Facing Nunnehi forces Kithain to examine the high costs of \nthe modem culture that they are a part of, and playing a Nunnehi demands action \nbefore yet more of the world is allowed to fall to the tainted touch of “progress.” \nAmong the Nunnehi themselves, old tribal blood feuds persist, occasionally \nspilling over into the chimerical realm and forcing them to wonder who the true \nenemies are - \nthe Europeans without or the hotheads within. Conversely, many \nNunnehi Nations are much closer than their kith counterparts, and quests shared \nby heroes of allied Nations are the stuff of legend. \nTHE \nMANY \nWORLDS \nNunnehi believe there are three worlds: the Upper World of totems, visions and \nspirits, the Middle (physical) World of humanity and the Lower World of the dead. \nThe Upper World is largely a reflection of the Middle World, but it is much more \nvivid and profound, offering a glimpse of the true nature of things. Some of the Upper \nNUNNEHI \nEon THE \nSHINNING \nHOST \n\n\nWorld is beyond imagination, the home ofgreat gods and heroes. The Lower World, \nby contrast, is also a reflection, but it is ashen, dull and decaying, a place of sadness \nand despair. Great trods connect all places in the spirit world, and visiting it is an \nimportant part of a Nunnehi’s life. All things living and dead are part of the great \ncycle. Nunnehi who possess at least Basic Wayfare and one level of the Nature Realm \nmay cross into the Upper World by stepping into a quantity of their chosen totem: \na flowering bush, rock face or a waterfall. In addition, all Nunnehi may cross over \nusing a body of pure water. Note: Nunnehi cannot cross into the Lower World on \ntheir own, although they may use the Spirit Link Art to speak to its ghosts. \nSystem: The Nunnehi must perform a Bunk and win a Static Mental Challenge \nusing the Mythlore Ability against a difficulty of the Banality level of the area in order \nto cross over. (If the Nunnehi possesses the Portal Passage Art and the Verdant Forest \nlevel of the Nature Realm, all difficulties are lowered by two.) The Nunnehi may bring \nothers along, as long as they hold hands and the Nunnehi spends one Medicine Trait \nfor each passenger. Those characters who cannot cross over on their own are stuck if \nthe Nunnehi abandons them, and they must seek out a special trod to get home. \n(More detail on the Upper World - \nor the Umbra - \ncan be found in Laws \nof the Wild; for the Lower World, consult Oblivion.) \nC ~ L A M O U R A N D  BANALITY \nNunnehi refer to Glamour as “Medicine,” and they may gather it from artistic \nperformances as Kithain do, although they are two Traits down to do so unless the \nartist is Native American and performing a traditional piece. Furthermore, the \ndifficulty to enchant mortals increases by one inside the confines of a city. \nMost Nunnehi prefer to gather Medicine from natural sources. They have three \nways of doing so: Harvesting, Raiding and Blessing. Harvesting (equivalent to Reverie) \nis handled with the same systems, except a Static Mental Challenge is employed and \nHarvesting requires at least one hour spent in contact with the natural scene being \nenjoyed (lying in a field of flowers, dipping toes in a stream, sunning on a rock). \nRaiding, the equivalent of Ravaging, also uses the same systems, but the \nNunnehi runs the additional risk of attracting the ire of angry spirits if she fails the \nRaiding challenge. (Narrator’s discretion, but typically distracting and unpleas- \nant.) Blessing uses the same mechanics as Rapture, but it can only be achieved \nthrough a direct audience with the Nunnehi’s totem spirit while in the Upper \nWorld and only once per season. Totems usually honor such requests for an \naudience, but they expect no less than the absolute best in exchange for their time! \nN U N N B H I  \nCAMPS \nNunnehi do not recognize a Seeliewnseelie distinction, instead using the Summer \n(or Dogwood), Winter (or Rock) and Midseason (or Laurel) camps. Summer Nunnehi \ntend to be outgoing, warm and friendly; Winter Nunnehi tend to be withdrawn, cold and \nunforgiving. Midseason fae are tricksters one and all, balancing the two camps as they see \nfit. Many Nunnehi follow camps on a seasonal basis, although this is by no means a \nrequirement. For example, many Nunnehi adopt their Winter aspect when recently \nwronged or insulted, and some mume their Summer mien when falling in love or taking \non quests. A few uncommon Nunnehi adhere to the same camp nearly or completely \nyear-round. Nunnehi may change their camp freely as Kithain do, although most prefer \na private ritual of transition before showing off their new camp allegiance. \n\n\nIt is important to note that Nunnehi are not openly divided between Summer \nand Winter factions like the Kithain are with the Seelie/Unseelie dichotomy. \nNunnehi of different camps may have trouble seeing eye-to-eye on certain issues, \nbut all recognize the role each has to play in the greater cycle. \nN U N N E H I  \nS E E M I N ~ S  \nNunnehi have three seemings, just like Kithain do. During creation, add one \nadditional Glamour (called “Medicine”) Trait to the usual starting totals, a boon \nof the Nunnehi’s spirit ties. \nYoungling: Children are the treasures of the Nation, and they are defended \nby all, regardless of camp or family. Most are given silly names to shield them from \njealous spirits, and all are considered to be of the Midseason camp. \nBrave: The dynamic, creative force of the Nations, braves are great lovers and \nfighters who strive to put a new face on the old ways. Braves are given new names \nbased on accomplishments or reputation, and they may choose their camp freely. \nElder: These Nunnehi are revered for their great wisdom, and they seek to \nkeep old legends alive for the next generation. They may choose their own name, \nand most settle into one camp for the majority of their time, leading and teaching \nother Nunnehi. \nNUNNEHI \nEAMILIES \nNunnehi do not recognize kiths, but Families. A whole Family is called a \nNation, thus the origin of the title “Nunnehi Nations.” \nc A N O T I L I  ( T R E E  DWELLERS) \nThese mischievous forest dwellers of the Midwest aid or hinder hunters who \nAffinity: Prop \nBirthrights: \nEarth Blend: By remaining perfectly still, the canotili may change color to \nmatch her surroundings like a chameleon.

This only functions in areas of natural \nwilderness. This is a Wyrd Birthright, but only if the Nunnehi attempts to hide in \nview of mortals; canotili already hidden remain so even if mortals enter the area. \nPhysical Enhancement: All canotili gain the additional PhysicalTraits: Wiry \nand Rugged, which can never be lost permanently. \nFrailties: \nTerror: When surprised, canotili exude a pheromone that causes powerful fear \nin non-canotili around her; all such creatures must win a Simple Test (or spend a \nWillpowerTrait) or flee in terror.

The power must also have a specific Realm attached (such as the Familiar \nFace level of the Actor Realm) and is only good for that particular Realm; each \namulet is only good for one use. Investing an amulet is considered a sacred trust by \nthe inua, not a means for greedy players to create a magic amulet factory. \nChange Form: Inua may freely change shape into one animal of a local type, chosen \nat character creation. A second shape may be learned during character creation as afive- \nTrait Merit. Finally, an additional shape may be learned at acmt of four Experience Traits \nwhen a character becomes a brave or an elder. This is a Wyrd Birthright. \nFrailties : \nSusceptibility: Inua within a few yards of a pollutant (air pollution counts!) \nsuffer a one-Trait penalty to all challenges; those inua actually in direct contact \nwith a pollutant are at a two-Trait penalty. \nKACHINAS \nHelpful faeries of the Southwest, the ethereal kachinas bring rain and plenty \nAffinity: Nature \nBirthrights: \nPrayer ofplenty: Withastatic Mentalchallenge ofthe 0CcultAbilit-y (difficulty 7), \na kachina may cause a boom in plant growth and ramfall in an area, ensuring gccd crops. \nThe kachina does this only if her tribe performs the proper dances and ceremonies first. \nCloud Form: With a Medicine Trait, the Nunnehi may transform into a cloud \nor wisp of smoke. They are immune to physical attacks and may float in this shape, \nbut they are at the mercy of any prevailing winds and must return to a safe altitude \nbefore changing back or else suffer falling damage. Changing back slowly costs \nnothing, although an instantaneous reversion costs the Nunnehi one Mental Trait. \nThis is a Wyrd Birthright. \nto communities that honor the ancient ways. \nFrailties: \nSingle Mind: Kachinas must choose one craft- or performance-related Ability upon \nwhich they are especially focused; they must purchase at least one level of this Ability and \nare one Trait up on all challenges involving it.

By spending \ntwo Physical Traits, the Nunnehi may take a vehicle (and anyone in it) safely \nthrough the wall, as well. This is a Wyrd Birthright. \nCall the Swimmers: By spending a Social Trait, the Nunnehi may summon \na netful of fish to himself in a body of water. \nthey love. \n\n\nFrailties: \nWeakness of Will: When confronted by a seafood \nfeast or an unguarded fish supply, the Nunnehi must 1 \nspend a Willpower Trait to avoid indulging himself \n(and leaving himself open to all manner of ambush). \nNANEHI \nThese sociable Nunnehi of the Southeast \ncan alter their shape and enjoy attending 1 \nhuman festivals. \nAffinity: Fae \nBirthrights: \nShape the Body: By spending a Medi- \ncine Trait, the nanehi may alter her body to \nbe anywhere between two feet in height to \nnormal human size, may make herself look \nolder or younger and may temporarily add \n(or subtract) a Gorgeous SocialTrait. Any- \none looking for the nanehi must win a \nMental Challenge to recognize her if her \nform has been altered significantly, and the \nchanged nanehi should wear a description card 7 \nor otherwise clearly indicate her altered state to \nother players.

This change cannot be healed or averted in any \nway, and it should be represented by using the appropriate Flaw (like Lame or One \nEye), but the character gains no Traits for it. \np u’ gwrs \nThese cursed fae of the far north are hideous to behold, yet they possess \nAffinity: Actor \nBirthrights: \nSong of Beckoning: Pu’gwis may call others to them with a hypnotic song; this \ndoes not affect most supernatural creatures, but mortals may be called with a \nsuccessful Social Challenge against their Willpower. \nSong of Dismissal: The pu’gwis may remove all memories of himself from the \npeople around him with a successful Social Challenge, which targets may resist with \nWillpower.

Only Nunnehi may leam this Art, unless the given changeling has been \nadopted by a Nunnehi Nation. \nType of Challenge: Mental \nBASIC \nWorld Sight: With this power, the Nunnehi may see into the Upper, Lower or \nMiddle Worlds anddiscem the true nature of the things she looks at. The rough amount \nof Medicine or spirit power inherent to a place may also be sensed. When used on an \nindividual, this Art may detect spirit possession, curses or even whether the target is a \nsupernatural being (and what type, if any) if the Nunnehi defeats her target in a Mental \nChallenge. The Nunnehi must be physically present to sense objects or targets in the \nMiddle World but need not be so for the Upper or Lower Worlds. \nType: Chimerical \nAncestor Speech: By completing a Bunk and spending a Medicine Trait, the \nNunnehi may summon tribal ancestors and consult their wisdom regarding a specific \nmatter. These ancestor spirits may only answer questions pertaining to, or provide \n\n\nvisions of, the past up to the moment - \nin answering, they are limited to their own \nperspectives and experiences and do not have any special inside knowledge about \nthings. They also cannot see the future or even the present moment; however, the \nwisdom of the past is quite valuable in itself. Nunnehi spirits may be contacted only \nif the faerie soul was destroyed, in which case the mortal spirit is available to this Art. \nObviously, the Storyteller or a Narrator should roleplay the conversation, and the \nNunnehi may ask no more questions than she has permanent Mental Traits. \nType: Chimerical \nI N T E R M E D I A T E  \nVision Quest: See the Augury Art of Soohay. (Yes, Nunnehi gain this power \nmore easily.) Storytellers are encouraged to make vision quests as vivid and intense as \npossible; additionally, the Bunk for this Art is always a traditional vision quest of some \nkind - \nfasting, smoke house rituals, etc. -determined by the Narrator according to \nthe tribe of the Nunnehi in question. Note: All the rules of live-action conduct still \napply to Vision Quest - \ndo not actually starve yourself, take peyote or anything else! \nType: Chimerical \nPlacate: This Art allows the Nunnehi to appease angry spirits and hungry ghosts, \nacting as a liaison to the spirit world in order to determine what is necessary to placate \nthem. A Bunk and a Mental Trait are required to establish contact with the spirit(s) \ninquestion, at which time most gladly tell theNunnehi what needs to be done in order \nto satiate their needs. Even the angriest spirits do not usually attack a Nunnehi using \nthis Art, out of respect for his intentions, but woe indeed to the faerie who uses this \npower and then ignores what the spirits have asked for! Likewise, if the Nunnehi and \nhis tribe abide by what the spirits ask for, the spirits are honor-bound to leave them in \npeace, a bargain only the most vile spirits would dare break. This Art is a sacred trust \nto most tribes, and though it gives the faerie no power over the spirits, it is an important \nstep toward establishing a settlement between the two worlds when they are at odds. \nType: Chimerical \nADVANCED \nGhost Dance: This powerful ability allows the Nunnehi to assert control over the \nspirit world, banish supernatural creatures from the area and otherwise demonstrate \nmastery of the ethereal plane. This Art costs two Medicine Traits to use and requires a \nMental Challenge against the target - \nspirits and wraiths may be ordered to cease \ntroubling the human world, and those spirits who have inhabited bodies or otherwise \nsnuck onto the mortal coil may be banished back to the Lower World. supernatural \ncreatures may be forced to leave the area for the rest of the session, though they may resist \nwith a Willpower Trait. Should the Nunnehi fail to banish an especially powerful ghost \n(Narrator's discretion), however, she must win or tie a Simple Test- failure means that \nshe is drawn into the Lower World herself and must fight her way back. Should she die \nin the Lower World, her faerie self is destroyed forever. At the Storyteller's discretion, this \nArt may be used to summon ghosts to aid the Nunnehi or her tribe, but the costs and \ndetails of such workings are strictly up to the Storyteller to determine. \nType: Chimerical (could become Wyrd in some cases) \nNUNNEHI \nBUNKS \nA complete list of Nunnehi Bunks can be found on pages 178 to 179 of the \nPlayer's Guide for Changeling: The Dreaming; in general, however, players and \nN U N N E H I  \nEon THE SHINNING \nHOST \n8 \n\n\n. . c \nNarrators withNunnehi characters should try to use Bunks quite different from the \nones their Kithain counterparts use. Not all of their Bunks necessarily need to be \nnative rituals of some kind, but they should definitely have a different flavor than \ntypical changeling Bunks to reflect the spiritual ties of the Nunnehi and their \ndifferent outlook on Glamour in general. Examples of Bunks with that sort of flavor \ninclude, blowing smoke from a peace pipe to set the mood for use of the Sovereign \nArt, wearing a hand-crafted mask when performing a trick of the Chicanery Art \nor executing the steps of a tribal dance in order to use the Wayfare Art. \nNu N N  e H I BAC \n~ c j  \nR O  u N D s \nNunnehi have several unique Backgrounds to choose from during cre- \nation. They may not take the Remembrance Background and should secure \nStoryteller permission before taking Title, Political Connections or a non- \nNunnehi Patron. \nHOUSEHOLD \nThis Background denotes a number of human relations who are close to the \ncharacter; they may or may not know the truth about her faerie nature but are \nfriendly and loyal nonetheless. Of course, they expect the same from the character \nin return, and they may turn against her if ill-treated. Players should work with the \nStoryteller to determine who these people are, where they live and what they do \nfor a living. The Storyteller may modify these numbers or even forbid certain levels \nof this Background if they prove too problematic for the chronicle. The number of \nTraits spent determines the number of people in the Household: \nOne Trait \nTwo members \nTwo Traits \nFour members \nThree Traits Eight members \nFour Traits \n16 members \nFive Traits \n32 members \nS P I R I T  \nCOMPANION \nSee the Companion Background, except that the Companion is not a chimera \nbut a natural spirit of some kind, like a fire spirit, a wind elemental or a water spirit. \nIn addition to the powers of that Background, the spirit may store additional \nMedicine or Willpower Traits for the character - the character need only \nconcentrate to will the energy to his Companion and can reclaim it at any time. A \nCompanion can hold twice as many Medicine Traits as the number of Traits a player \nputs into the Background. \nVISION \nThis replaces the Remembrance Background for Nunnehi, except that any \nknowledge gained pertains to the Higher Hunting Grounds, Nunnehi families and \nother appropriate material. \nTOTEM \nThe Nunnehi has a spiritual link to a higher entity, typically a tribal \ntotem or spirit guide of some kind. The number of Traits spent represents the \npower of the entity involved and the strength of the bond itself. See Player’s \nGuide for Changeling: The Dreaming pages 145, 152 and 153 for more \ndetails on totems. \n\n\nCOR.€ IDEA \nThere’s more to building longevity than simply deciding, “It’s time to run a new \nlive-action game.” Indeed, lack of initial design dooms many games to eventual \ndeathdown the road. Though it mayseemanunnecessaryeffort, there’sno substitute \nfor preparedness in running a chronicle, and the first step in proper preparation is \nisolating the core idea of the game. \nA game’s core idea defines and guides the chronicle. Although certain themes \ncome naturally to each of the Mind’s Eye Theatre settings, a prepared Storyteller \npicks and chooses the ones that he desires to showcase. The idea is to pare down to \nthe essential elements. Start by separating into story elements and mechanical \nelements, then work up brief lists of desired material. \nMECHANICAL \nELEMENTS \nThe first piece of superstructure for a chronicle lies in the game mechanics. Pick \nthe game you plan to run with an eye toward possible themes and players - \nLaws of \nthe Wild explores powerful themes of isolationism and the danger of fanatacism, but \nit may be difficult to showcase them consistently; Laws of the Night games may draw \nnumerous players, but it can be difficult to develop new and unique story elements. \nAt the start, you need only consider broad story elements. Most games use some \nvariation of the Mind’s Eye Theatre rules, yet there’s no problem in altering the rules \nto suit the game. Decide how much to alter the rules for the game - \nrules are only a \nframework, after all, designed for ease of play. Are manipulation and intrigue going to \nbeparamount?Ifso, thenhfluencerulesshouldprobablybe more heavilydetailed. Are \nthe characters supposed to be more experienced and potent than normal? Change the \ncharacter-creation rules. Play with the framework as necessary, but once the game \nbegins, don’t change the rules unless it’s absolutely necessary - \nconsistency, though the \nhobgoblin of little minds, is part of the virtue of fairness in play. \nSTORY \nELEMENTS \nA chronicle’s story elements are the dramatic pieces that the Storyteller wishes \nto emphasize. For instance, a Vampire story may showcase redemption, inhumanity, \nmystery. romance or even a combination of the above; a Wraith story could focus \non loss, reconciliation, helplessness and hope. In truth, any venue can support just \n\n\nabout any story type. The job of the Storyteller here is to decide what themes will \nbe important to the game so that plot elements can build from those themes later. \nBy way of example, if a story focuses on redemption, the players must be given \nopportunities for their characters to witness or perform horrible deeds so that the \nlater redemption has meaning. \nWhen building story elements, remember that the ultimate point of the game \nis to have fun. Many Storytellers come up with intriguing plot ideas but become so \nintent on showcasing their unique creations that the players lose the ability to \ninfluence the direction of the game. Once all power of choice has been removed from \nthe players, the game stops being fun. Thus, if a chronicle focuses on helplessness, \nthe Storyteller must balance the players’ feelings of inability to affect their environ- \nment with the needs of running an entertaining chronicle. \nStory elements should just be broad statements in the outline of the game - \nthe \nactual focus on driving plot pieces comes later. Look at the broad picture of themes for \nthe game, pick a few and write them down. It’s important to have more than one story \nelement, because players have varied tastes and not all players want to be involved in \nevery type of story. Similarly, recognize that individual Storytellers have different \nstyles; the Narrators and Storytellers of the game must have plot elements with which \nthey can effectively work. A Vampire game of romance, intrigue and betrayal is \nconceptually great, but it won’t last long if the Storytellers and Narrators aren’t \ncomfortable running some of the themes or if the players don’t want that sort of game. \nGROUND Up \nWith core themes and some basic mechanical tweaklng done, it’s time to look at the \nprospective plotsfor the game and the elements that will allow it to run over the long term. \nPreparing for a long-running game isn’t difficult, but it does require advance planning. \nThis is the stage at which the Storyteller should set up the backstory and start \nsoliciting players and assistants. Also, any regular live-action game needs a solid \nmeeting place, so this is the phase for picking a location (and alternatives). Other \nmandatory paperwork - \nrules updates and the like - \nneeds to be done before the \ngame begins as well. \nPLOTTING \nSTORY \nARCS \nStory arcs come in three types for full chronicles, unsurprisingly divided into \nshort-range, mid-range and long-range ones. A successful chronicle possesses all \nthree and allows them to combine so as to form conflicting elements. After all, \nwithout conflict, the players may not feel a sense of accomplishment; the players \nneed to be able to direct the game in some fashion, and they do so through their \nchoices of plot resolution. \nThe underpinnings of a chronicle play from the long-range plot elements. A \nlong-range plot element is really a factor of the story, and it is predicated upon the \ncore theme. Players can and do drive long-range plots, but the Storyteller needs to \ninject plot elements as well. After all, not every player immediately visualizes goals \nfor her character. The long-range plot elements focus on the chronicle’s overall \nstructure and guide the story; they also pull in the players who wish to participate in \nthe overall story. Some sample long-range elements are: The Inconnu bring the hope \nof Golconda to a deserving Cainite (based on a redemption theme); local Garou \nbecome involved in the lives of their Kinfolk and their communities, fighting to \ndefend those parts of human society (based on a romance theme); the local town is \n\n\nmoving on, forcing the ghosts of the city to find ways to cope (based on a theme of \nloss); an arcane disturbance for which no one has yet found a cause or a cure afflicts \nthe city (based on a theme of mystery). \nMid-range plot elements last several sessions and take some work to resolve. As \nproblems, they play on the driving elements of the game and spin off from the goals of \nparticular players. Indeed, a goal that a player visualizes for a character can form a good \nmid-range plot. Mid-range plots need to be tracked carefully so that their pieces remain \nconsistent from game to game. Examples of mid-range plots include: A vampire tries \nto learn an unusual Discipline (such as Necromancy) outside of his clan’s specialties \n(perhaps to further a long-range goal of Golconda or control over a particular element \nof the city); the Sabbat declares a crusade against the characters’ home city, and the \nsiege must be resisted (possibly as part of an ongoing border war between Camarilla and \nSabbat in the area); a Hierarchy official/archon/elder Garou visits for a time (perhaps \nlookingforalostlovedoneaspartofaromanceplot); auseful itemorpersondisappears, \nand several clues and puzzles must be found and understood in order for the thing to \nbe found (perhaps to fulfill some piece of the puzzle in a mystery plot). \nA sh-range plot spans only a single game session or part of it. Such a plot element \nis usually subordinate to a larger plot device. Short-range plot elements can come in just \nabout anytime with minimal effort; if they aren’t planned, though, they can seem odd or \ncause continuity problems later. The best plan for short-range plots is to look at the causes \nand effects of the various larger plot elements and play from those. Examples of short- \nrange plot elements: ASabbatpackattackssomecharactersandmustberepelled(aspart \nof the Sabbat crusade plot); a Nihil opens briefly, disgorging some Spectres (possibly \nrelated to the ongoing plot of loss, with the Shadowlands falling to the town’s decay); an \nobject is lost or stolen, but the clues point to a rapid recovery (as part of a mystery plot); \na diplomatic envoy arrives and delivers a simple message, requiring a simple response \n(maybe pushing associations with a later romantic interest). \nFor a good, solid start to a chronicle, pick two story arcs of each length and plot \nthem out. Remember, short-range elements resolve quickly, so new ones may be \nneeded at the next game; however, with luck, the existing mid-range and long-range \nelements drive the players to make their owngoals, thus spinning off some new short- \nrange elements. However, never count on the players to drive the story. Although \na player-driven story is generally the most rewarding, the Storyteller must be ready \nto introduce new random elements and hooks. \nREBUILDINC~THE \nRULES \nThe chronicle’s been plotted, the goals are in place and the players are enthusi- \nastic. Now it’s time to sit down and actually tweak the rules that need modification. \nThe first section to check out is character creation. The options allowed to \nplayersgreatly affect the theme and mood of the game. In agame focused on intrigue, \nfor instance, it makes sense to limit the amount of Influence that characters may start \nwith so that they are forced to squabble over it later. A Storyteller running a game \nset in Germany during the Dark Ages should recommend that the characters take \ncommon languages. A game focusing on mystery or the solving of obscure riddles \nprobably needs to limit the use of unusual powers and Merits by the characters, so \nthat they have goals to attain in the course of the game. \nNext, lookover the Storytelling mechanics themselves. There’s almost no reason \nto change the core bidding system of the game or to mess with the various combat rules; \nthese tend to run equally well for just about any game. However, the use of \n\n\nBackgrounds, Influence or special forms of equipment or Abilities might need review. \nA mystery-intensive chronicle could be derailed by a character with several levels of \nthe Enigmas Ability; a game about redemption and romance could turn into a violence- \nfest if the souped-up equipment from Laws of the Hunt comes into play without too \nmuch thought. Change or ban elements that don’t fit the game’s core theme. \nLOCATION, \nLOCATION, \nLOCATION \nIdeally, a live-action game can be held in a large, multi-room, indoor, tempera- \nIn the real world.. . \nSecuring a site before scheduling the game is mandatory! It does no good to \nschedule a game but then be unable to tell players where to meet. Inclement weather \nand lack of space can also severely handicap a game, as can lack of a location to perform \noff-site actions and narration. Keep all these factors in mind when looking for a site. \nFor locations with good weather, outdoor sites are sometimes possible. Parks \nand outdoor malls are often completely free, and they usually have plenty of space. \nHowever, there is always the risk of weather turning foul. Worse still, such games are \nnot necessarily private - \nand never (but never) try to draw negative attention from \nthe local populace. Most people don’t really have any idea of what live-action \nroleplaying means, and it’s not worth drawing in the police over “strange cult-like \nactivities.” Go for a more secluded spot, or at least one where the outrageous \nbehavior that inevitably crops up can go unnoticed. \nSome areas provide club buildings or community centers. Such places make \nexcellent venues, but there is often a rental cost. This isn’t so bad if the players can be \nenticed to cough up a couple of bucks each. Still, be sure to check out the rental \nagreements on such places. Some buildings may require additional deposits or payments \nto cover possible damage; accidents can and do happen, and$700 in repair workcan spell \ndoom for just about any LARP. Again, most people aren’t familiar with live-action \nroleplaying, and they automatically make negative associations; this ill shadow (as it \nwere) can be a hindrance when filling out the event forms that many locations require. \nOf course, the best spot for a game is at someone’s house! A large enough house \ncan easily host several dozen players, and if it’s not part of an apartment complex, \nthe LARP‘s noise quotient and occasional odd behavior won’t draw any attention. \nThe problem here is in convincing someone to open up a home for two dozen people, \nall of whom might be carrying and spilling drinks, tromping about in dirty shoes and \ngrabbing scenery objects as part of their character portrayals. When using a house, \nbe sure to set specific ground rules and to make them known before each and every \nevent. Doing so saves grief (and cleaning bills) later; players should be penalized for \ninappropriate behavior. Players can complain about their characters being mis- \ntreated, but when their in game activities cause out-of-game distress, it’s time to trim \nit back. Also, the homeowner should receive some incentive for making the site \navailable; an extra experience point for the session or other game treat is a good \ncompromise, as is forming a volunteer crew to help clean up and to provide food or \nfurnishings necessary for the events. \nture-controlled regular setting that’s absolutely free. \nRECRUITMENT \nWith a location and a solid game design in mind, it’s time to recruit players and \nassistants. The business of recruitment varies according to the style of game you \n\n\ndesire, 1:hough. After all, an invitation-only game has no need for lavish posters all \nover the place. \nOpen games generally let just about anyone in. Such games can quickly \naccumulate many players. The risk is that some of the players may bring along \ntheir own quirks and foibles in a way that threatens the enjoyability of the game. \nRecruiting for an open game is simple: Place some posters at the local game store; \nrun off some flyers with a description of the game’s core theme; and use the \nInternet to set up contacts on newsgroups (like alt.games.whitewolf) and e-mail \nlists (like Vampire-L). \nRestricted games limit their membership in some fashion. The most common \ntype of restricted game is invitation-only; these games generally recruit solely by \nword of mouth and only under the auspices of the head Storyteller. Certain clubs and \norganizations like the Camarilla also run games that are available only to club \nmembers; recruitment here comes about through club periodicals (like Requiem) and \ne-mail (like One World by Night’s OWbN-OOC list). \nThe first stageofrecruiting is finding out whether there’senoughdemand torun \nthe game! If a game won’t attract more than a couple of players, then the long- \nrunning plot lines may not have a chance to really shine. Without character \ninteraction, the two players probably won’t stick around unless new players are \nsuddenly recruited in the second game session. A good medium is to shoot for at least \nadozen players; for one-shots, a handful is fine, but long-running games need enough \nplayers to divide into factions. \nOnce thegame is indemand, pick assistants. Remember, though, that not every \nassistant (Narrator, coordinator, Storyteller, whatever) needs to be competent in all \nareas of the game. It’s possible that someone is great at providing transportation and \nsite logistics but has a tough time with the rules. That’s fine -grab people who can \ndo the individual jobs necessary and assign them strict roles. That way, the game gets \npeople who can do particular jobs well instead of running the Storyteller ragged or \naccepting people who may be multi-skilled but noc exceptional in a particular \nposition. It’s always good to avoid personality conflicts here; although in theory \neveryone should be able to get along and do their jobs without conflict, in practice \nreal life sometimes interferes, and so assistants need to be chosen with an eye toward \ncompatibility (with each other, with the Storyteller and with the players). If \neveryone hates a particular Narrator, it won’t help move rules resolution along \nsmoothly; there’ll be too many arguments. Conversely, someone who knows the \nrules perfectly may not be well-suited to handling site logistics; such a person should \nbe placed firmly in a rules-narration position. \nT H E  \nLONC~ \nHAUL \nOnce players are lined up, the location’s been picked out, the rules packets have \nbeen distributed, the characters are built and the story begins, how do you keep the \ngame from crashing and burning within three months? \nThree major factors tend to contribute most to the death of prospective games, \nand all of them can be avoided with the right planning. \nPOLITICS \nFace it, although an ideal LARP would have players who could all get along, \npersonal conflicts do arise outside of the game. Too often, these conflicts spill over \n\n\ninto the game itself. Avoiding these conflicts requires direct mediation - \npolitics \ncan’t be allowed to simmer. Handle such problems as soon as they come up. \nThe worst sort of politicking comes from favoritism. Storytellers sometimes feel \ncompelled to give special benefits to their friends and significant others. This can be \nall right, as long as such benefits fit into the context of the game; picking out specific \npeople to play local Hierarchy officials for an Oblivion game, for instance, saves the \ntrouble of filling in with Narrator characters and gives a deliberate power structure \nto the game. However, the Storyteller must be absolutely firm indecisions offairness. \nIf the Storyteller chooses to be unfair or to skew the game’s rules or points toward \ncertain individuals, this skewing must be solely a result of the game’s play, not \nbecause of special friendships. A Storyteller thought to play favorites wins no respect \nand actually loses players. Generally, the best course is to stick to the same rules for \neveryone. If there’s a deliberate imbalance of power, it should be specifically written \ndown so that it can be seen and addressed by all of the players. \nPolitics also lead to metagmning- the practice of using out-of-game knowledge \nin the course of the game. Metagaming can be difficult to track; if a player knows that \na particular character is a diabolist, there’s nothing to stop his character from \nspuriously accusing the diabolist and then claiming that he was “just making it up.” \nEither way, the diabolist gets caught and likely killed; this is no fun at all if the player \nspent a lot of effort on his activities. The best way to handle metagaming is usually \nin downtimes. Have each player write a report between games on what his character \ndid and learned at the game (as well as what he intends to do during downtime). If \na player uses knowledge that his character shouldn’t have, stop it immediately. Once \nmetagame knowledge gets out, it has to be traced to every person “infected.” \nSome players also bring their real-life conflicts with them into the game. If a \nparticular player hates another player, it’s possible that the first player may make a \nseries of characters all designed for the specific purpose of killing the hapless victim. \nIn such instances, the best way to deal with the situation is to bring in Narrator \ncharacters. Although heavy-handed, this can serve to play up why killing other \ncharacters is almost universally frowned on by the higher-ups of just about any World \nof Darkness group. Also, keeping the players from killing one another in a pointless \ncycle forces them to direct their energies elsewhere, possibly adding to intrigue and \nnew plots in the game. \nCHARACTER \nIMBALANCE \nCharacter imbalance, a subtle, creeping factor, makes a game difficult to \ncontrol and hard to enter. At the outset of the game, everyone pretty much runs \nunder the same power levels. Players all build their characters with the same rules, \nand avoiding favoritism lets everyone get a fair shake at the game. New players can \ncome in a few months down the road with the expectation of getting involved in an \nalready established good game. \nThe problem of character imbalance starts creeping up after numerous \nsessions have passed - when players have had a chance to accumulate 50 \nExperience Traits or more for some of their old-guard characters. These characters \nmove to the forefront, dominating the game. This is natural; ancilla and elder \nvampires, old gaunt wraiths and the like should occupy positions of power. \nHowever, these characters can come to completely control the game, shutting out \nnew players with less powerful characters. When these old guard characters can do \n\n\neverything the new characters can do (and do it better), there are no storylines in \nwhich new players can get involved. \nUltimately, there are three good solutions for character imbalance. The first is \nto build in obsolescence for characters: For every chunk of 25 or 50 Experience Traits \nspent on a character, increase all costs for later purchases by one Trait. Thus, an elder \nvampire character who already had 100 Experience Traits spent on powers and \nAbilities would have to spend an extra two or four Traits on all new purchases. \nSecond, offer build points for characters: New players might get some extra Traits \nwhen building their characters so that they can keep up. This tactic invites the \nworrisome problem of power-escalation, though, causing all characters to become \noverpowered down the line. Third, build in safeguards to keep certain plots open to \nnew players. If some Narrator characters at the high levels of the game direct plot \nelements toward the new characters or if you simply ask some of your old guard to \nstep back and allow new players to participate in certain plotlines of your designa- \ntion, you can avoid the syndrome of helplessness among the new crowd. \nSITE CONFLICTS \nA well-planned game can always fall to the problems of the real world. \nUnfortunately, the (perceived) less-than-sterling reputation of the roleplaying \ngame community means that some places may hesitate to allow live-action games in \ntheir area. Some games even face harassment from local authorities. \nIn order to prevent problems with conflicts of this sort, always have a backup \nsite planned. When setting up a location, make sure to have an alternate available, \nand make sure that everyone knows how to get there as well. Plan for sites at least \na month in advance, so that there is enough time to reschedule and try to get a \ndifferent backup in order if something goes wrong. \nAlso, as a matter of common sense, don’t antagonize non-players. Although LARP \ngroups often adopt a siege mentality about the surrounding community and people who \ndon’t understand roleplaying, nothing is served by getting in other people’s faces. People \nwho don’t understand the hobby don’t get a favorable impression when MET players \ntreat them with scorn or derision. Always be polite. If locals or law enforcement ask the \ngroup to move to a different location, agree to head to an alternate site and ask to discuss \nthe matter later - \nbetter than arguing about it in the middle of a game and antagonizing \nboth the players and the non-players. Remember, some LARP groups might be mistaken \nfor gangs, absurd as it seems (after all, local merchants and police have a valid concern \nabout 20 people in black trenchcoats congregating in a public place and making strange \nhand gestures). Keep matters low-key, and instruct players to direct people to the \nStoryteller if a problem arises. Although she may be well-meaning, a player in the midst \nof a challenge or action-filled scene may not make the best diplomat for an outsider to \nthe game; the Storyteller must be able to fill that responsibility outside of the game itself \n(remember, most non-players feel very uncomfortable discussing matters in the middle \nof the game, so be sure to go somewhere else to negotiate). \n90 qeT’EM! \nThat’s it! Seriously. Setting up a long-running chronicle may seem like a lot of \nwork, but it’s rewarding to Storyteller and players alike. Keep a sheet handy to jot \ndown notes about the various steps in this article, and chronicle setup for most open- \nended games can be accomplished easily in under a day. And, of course, always \nremember the most important rule - \nhawe fun. \n\n\nA POSITION \nO E  S T R E N ~ T H  \nby Carl Bowen \nWe intend to include a piece of World of Darkness fiction in every issue of \nthe Journal. Fiction dealing with the World of Darkness offers insights into the \nlives and times of the people (i.e., the characters) who inhabit it, and such \ninsi,phts offer you (as players and Storytellers) flavor and spice to make your \nMind’s Eye Theatre games all the more attractive. Mind’s Eye Theatre \nreleases should be simultaneously entertaining and useful. This piece, in \nparticular, showcases a way to blend into the background ofmortal society while \ncarrying out very specific Kindred business. \nA touch on my face awakens me as night comes. For a moment, I believe that \nthe touch is that of a lover’s hand, but the ever-present smell of my surroundings \nbreaks through that lie right away. I open my eyes to the darkness, suspecting that \nthe touch was no more than the flicking tail of a rat. The little beasts crawl onto \nmy chest to sleep sometimes, not moving an inch until I begin to stir to life. The \nskittering, splashing sounds that echo around the dank cavern like the applause of \ntiny sycophants confirm my theory. I never see the furry things, but I am almost glad \nof their company. At least they are company. \nStanding, I brush gnarled, spotted fingers through the last of my hair, \nresisting the urge to tear it all out by the roots. Instead, I pass my empty hands \nover my head like an empress holding elaborate ivory combs, creating an illusion \nof a thick fall of ebony locks, just as I sported in my youth. An illusory suit of \nexpensive silk comes next, covering the tattered remnants of an out-of-style \ntweed blazer and blue jeans combination. Finally, I concentrate on the way I used \nto look before.. . before it all. I remember my blue eyes and trimmed goatee - \nmy teeth, tarnished from years of smoking a pipe yet still straight and strong. I \nconcentrate on these things, and I know - \nalthough I cannot feel it - \nthat I look \nthat way again. I know that the true flesh of my face is safely buried beneath that \ngenial mask. Only when my disguise - \nthe lie that covers who I truly am - \nis \ncomplete do I venture toward the surface. Only the stench of the sewer remains \nto hint at my identity, but I let that be. \nThe place I had slept is not far from my point of egress into the dark streets \n- \nI have taken to sleeping where I fall lately - \nand I soon stand above the \nsurface of my home. I step into the shadow of a nearby building and lean against \nthe wall for support. I don’t like being above ground; I prefer it even less when \nI have to be outside. \n“You have rat-droppings on your shirt,” asmug, faintly amused voice says from \nacross the alley. \nI jump and draw a quick breath - \nmore from habit than involuntary reflex. \nMy contact is early. He can see right through my disguise, and he (no doubt) saw \nwhere I emerged from the sewers. I will have to change my route to the surface now. \n“Bainbridge,” I say in a whisper. My voice is not what it used to be. “It is good \nto see you.” \nA P O S I T I O N  Of S T R B N Q T H  \n\n\nThe elegant fop steps out of the shadows into the light that rolls down \nthe alley. He is decked in ultra-stylish, tight-fitting clothing that somehow \nmanages to please the eye despite the best efforts of the ugly pink-orange tint \nof the sodium-arc streetlights. He stands with one knee cocked, his arms \ncrossed. A delicately embroidered handkerchief carrying the scent of heavy \nperfume dangles from his right hand, and he waves it under his nose casually \nevery few moments. \n“You’re right on time,” Alex Bainbridge lilts. “And I see you have your game- \nface on. That’s good.” \nI bristle and cock an unamused eyebrow. \n“You mentioned a job last night, Bainbridge,” I whisper. “And a retainer fee. \nI’ve no love for bantering in the open like this.” \nSomething passes behind Bainbridge’s eyes, and he smiles. ‘Then come,” he \nsays, taking my arm and gesturing expansively. “Let’s away to someplace more \ncongenial!” He means his good humor to be infectious, but he spoils the effect by \nwrinkling his nose slightly at my odor. I give him a sardonic smile - \ncracked and \nblistered lips peeling back from crooked, gapped teeth that only he can see - \nand \nallow myself to be led. \n* \n* \n* \nHe takes me to an expensive nightclub on the far comer of town, and I am \nsurprised that it is not the one he owns, the one he alluded to when he contacted \nme by phone the night before. The very air pulses and hums with a press of human \nbodies all shouting and gyrating to music that is almost a physical presence. Lights \nflicker and flash in time with the music, transforming the mob of dancers into an \never-changing menagerie of sweating, hazy statues. This club is gaudy and juvenile \ncompared with the courtly grace of Bainbridge’s own club, the Bocor, but it is much \nbetter than being outside in the open. \nBainbridge and I take a table on the periphery of the dance floor, wading \nthrough the crowd with some effort. When we are seated, we do not try to shout \nover the din but rather move our mouths as if in speech. Each of us is an \naccomplished lip-reader - \nan invaluable skill in the information trade - \nand \nthe words come as naturally as a pleasant Sunday-afternoon conversation in the \npark. We may appear slightly odd, conversing amidst all this chaos without any \ntrouble, but we do not fear accidental discovery. The only others who take any \nnote of us are Bainbridge’s servants and the employees working at the nightclub. \nI trust surroundings such as these more than I would isolated booths or dark, \nforbidding alleyways. \n“You almost look overdressed now,” Bainbridge jokes, referring to my disguise \nand still flicking the handkerchief before his nose. His clothes perfectly comple- \nment his surroundings and vice versa. \n“The job?” I mouth back. It feels good to communicate this way, without the \npersistent scratching in my throat that started the night I entered this second life, \nwhen my throat twisted and cinched up at my first taste of blood. \nBainbridge rolls his eyes theatrically, but he smiles at my forthrightness. “It’s \nmore of a tenured position than a single job, really,” he says, skipping the banter. \n“As I mentioned, we are prepared to offer you a substantial retainer fee.” \n“GO on.” \nM I N D ’ S  E Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n\n\n“Assignments for this job may impinge quite seriously on your free time, and \nyou would have to guarantee your continued availability,” Bainbridge says, the \nhandkerchief bobbing to the oppressive beat of the music. “You would also be \nrequired to pledge a certain assurance of allegiance to my.. . organization. Would \nthat be a problem?” \n“You talk like a lawyer, Bainbridge,” I smirk. “It makes this job sound less \nworthwhile by the moment.” \nBainbridge’s eyes flash, and a dazzling smile crosses his face. I have been told \nthat I am a handsome man - \nwhen I am disguised -but \nBainbridge is absolutely \nbeautiful when he smiles. \n“Nice words from someone who talks like a Harvard English professor half the \ntime,” he says, speaking aloud in his merry amusement. “But do forgive me. I only \nmeant to convince you of how important this job would be to those of my \norganization. The services we require beg a certain amount of delicacy and \nprovider-loyalty.” \n“You know how much my loyalty is worth,” I tell him, sitting back in my chair. \nDespite myself, I begin to relax. Bainbridge sounds desperate, and desperate men \nwith favors to ask are much more tractable and trustworthy by nature. \n“That I do,” Bainbridge mouths, still smiling. “And you should have what \nyou desire.” \n“Then tell me the job.” \nBainbridge looks away for a moment at some voluptuous girl throwing herself \nabout with particular grace on the crowded dance floor - \nhe is so easily distracted \n-then leans toward me and locks my eyes in his gaze. “My organization needs your \nparticular skills of mediation.” \nI blink. “Is that it?” I have long availed myself to those of my kind who \nknow to ask. \n“‘It’?” Bainbridge mouthes, incredulous. Then: “Ah, forgive me again. I forget \nthat you have not had the time to think this through as I have.” \n“Then do explain,” I say. It is often difficult to tell if Bainbridge is deliberately \ntrying to insult me or ifhe is merely tactless. It is so hard to tell, and with Bainbridge, \nan accusation of one would likely just bring assurances of the other. \n“What I mean to say is that my organization wishes to be your sole patron \nin the dispensation of your diplomatic ability. We wish to make you a kind \nof envoy.” \n“Why?” I can just imagine the endless frippery and decadence I would have \nto put up with were I to agree. Bainbridge’s associates are - \nlike Bainbridge - \ngiven to boring, pointless dalliances in art and social maneuvering. \nThis time, Bainbridge’s pause seems more the surprise of an overconfident \nman who cannot imagine why someone would want to disagree with him. \n“Well, primarily,” he says after only a short hesitation, “because we can offer \nyou a substantial amount of money, even when you are not on assignment for us. \nSecond, for our own part, my associates and I strive to possess those things that we \nconsider to be the best of their kind. We would be greatly honored to be able to lay \nclaim to your remarkable talent. Simply put, you are the best negotiator in the city, \nand you would make a valuable asset.” \nA POSITION \nOe S T R F N ~ T H  \n\n\nI \n“Who told you that?” I can’t help but let pride creep into my voice despite \nBainbridge’s condescending tone. \n“We are aware of how you handled the problem we had with the logging \nindustry,” Bainbridge says. “As well as the treaty violations between ourselves and \nthose, shall we say, ‘angry’ denizens of the inner city.” \nI nod thoughtfully at the memory of both incidents. The former involved \nsome unruly servants of others of my kind who sought to put a halt to the \nlogging industry some years back in the name of environmental friendliness \nwithout considering the consequences on the local economy. The latter had \nended a tense period of hostility between my kind and the area’s original \nresidents who had grudgingly welcomed us when we first arrived, but then \nthought to change their minds. In both cases, I had simply been one voice out \nof many, yet it had been my ideas that had made the most sense to both sides \nof the quarrels. \n“That all happened some time ago,” I say. “Why does your.. . organization, as \nyou say.. . want to hire me now?” \nBainbridge glances around at each of his servants briefly, doubtless passing \nthem some signal to be prepared) and says, “Because we have an assignment in \nmind already, one for which you would be ideally suited.” \n“What assignment ?” \n“You understand that by telling you, I am assuming a certain-” \n“Yes, yes,” I cut in, ‘‘I will accept and be discreet, Bainbridge. Enough assurances.” \n“Very well. Something of a situation has arisen with one of the.. . guardians.. . \nof our kind. He has taken his master hostage, and he makes outrageous threats. He \nis, however, willing to negotiate.” \nI sit forward in my chair. This should not be. “How has he taken his own master \nhostage? I have no servants of my own, but the very nature of those bound-” \n“We do not know,” Bainbridge sighs. “We know that this servant, Travian is \nhis name, is possessed of great strength. He is also, by the accounts ofour messenger, \nquite insane.” \n“Then what makes you think that I will be able to negotiate with him at all?” \nA faint ghost of a smile touches Bainbridge’s face, and he says, “Perhaps I did \nnot make myself clear. I should have said that we only want you to talk to this \nTravian. We have no intention of bargaining with him, but he does have \ninformation we need. If you can pry that information from him, we would consider \nyour assignment accomplished. You need not cajole him into complying with you, \nnor do you need to placate him in any way.” \n“And why can you not just carry him away somewhere and make him give you \nthe information you desire?” \nBainbridge begins to seethe when I ask him that, and his fist slams down on \nthe table. “Because Travian is sitting at the center table of my club right now! He \ncontacted me through a servant last night before I spoke to you, and he has been \nthere since two hours before dusk waiting for us. He will not leave its safety without \ncausing a scene.” He unconsciously wads his handkerchief in his clenched fist, then \nleaves it crumpled on the table. \n“Then why not go to those of our kind higher in authority!” I ask. Bainbridge’s \nvoice drops back to subvocal range before he answers. He also casts quick glances \nM I N D ’ S  \nE Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \ndD \n\n\nat each of his servants again. I can almost feel them nodding in response, and I sense \nthat I am on decidedly delicate ground. \n“Because,” he says, “my organization and I are poised to make a rather \nsignificant political maneuver in the hierarchy of this town. If we go before the \ncurrent authorities with a request for assistance in dealing with our servants, we will \nlook weak and lose unimaginable face.” \n“You risk just that same loss by coming to me,” I say. “Either way, you are \nasking for help in dealing with what should be a strictly internal matter.” \n“Wrong, friend,” Rainbridge says, smiling easily. “We do not come crawling \nto you begging your help. To all accounts, I am being magnanimous to our erstwhile \nservant in hopes of preserving decorum in a fragile situation.” \n“You are negotiating with an insouciant lackey.” \n“We are employing a masterful negotiator in a holding ploy,” Rainbridge \ncorrects me. “Yet on the surface, we are affording great respect to an enemy. We \nappear both devilishly clever and noble.” \n“By using me and paying me off for it,” I say. “And binding me to your service \nto fortify your political aspirations.” \nAgain, that self-assured, if somewhat confused, smile crosses Bainbridge’s \nface. To him, I seem to be playing the game of bargaining, but I am putting too \nmuch heart into it. My compliance with his wishes should be a foregone conclu- \nsion, yet I actually seem ill-disposed to give it. \nrhere is a certain time-sensitive aspect to this assignment,” he says, his voice \ncarefully neutral. \n“Manipulate someone else,” I say, making as if to rise. ‘‘I have no desire to \nbridle a stalking horse just to keep you from looking silly.” \nBainbridge sits up a little straighter, the realization that I just might refuse him \ndespite his charms and bribes finally sinking in, and he says, “There is one other \nthing you may wish to consider.” \n‘‘, \nI lean back and steeple my fingers on top of the table. “And that is?” \n“Oh, must I?” he says. His nose wrinkles with distaste, and he says, “I find \nthis part so.. .” \n“Gauche?” \n“Cliched,” Rainbridge says, giving me a flat look. “Ah well. The thing you \nshould probably consider is that in turning my offer down, you become a potential \nliability to my aims. I am no lawyer, but I know that allowing such a thing would \nbe most irresponsible on my part.” \nStill half standing, I take a moment to really look around. Now that I’m \npaying attention, I see just how many of the random assortment of bystanders \n(and dancers and club patrons and bouncers.. .) are looking at me. They all flick \ntheir eyes (almost in unison) between me and Rainbridge, tense on the point of \naction. They may all be servants, but so many would surely be more than I could \nreasonably handle alone. \n“Thus, I say this,” Rainbridge says, ignoring everyone but me. “Work for me, \nor I will look into other options that will leave you and your niche in the \ninformation trade obsolete.” \nI glance again at the circle - \nthe noose - \nof eyes watching me, then sit back \ndown in defeat. “When do I begin?” \nA POSITION \nOP STRENGTH \ndB \n\n\nThe dazzling smile illuminates Bainbridge’s face as if it had never faltered, and \n“Immediately.” \nThe nightclub Bainbridge owns, the Bocor, stands in sharp contrast to Ban- \nHaven, in which he currently cowers. Whereas Ban-Haven relies heavily on \nGothic-Industrial architecture and pulsing lights and sounds, Bainbridge’s own \nclub is much more subtle in style and intent, catering to a more affluent and \nmature crowd. The lights are dim but constant. The colors lean more toward \nyellow and dark mahogany here instead of the black and chrome of the other \nclub. The music, while still pervasive and cutting-edge, doesn’t make a spectacle \nof itself. It coils and hums beneath the surface noise, underlying the atmosphere \nlike a serpent’s beating heart. The music subtly beckons here rather than \npounding at my eardrums. \nI drift in through the double doors - \ntranslucent glass edged with oak and \ngold-filigree - \nand scan the room in one pass. The guards inside, old servants of \nBainbridge, have been told to expect me, but they are still tense. The two at the \ndoor push back the front-runners of the pack that wants to come in - \nthe social \nhave-nots - \nand block off the entrance like riot police guarding a barricade. What \nfew outsiders have managed to prove their social worthiness and squeeze through \nstep into the club somewhat doe-eyed. They can tell that something is wrong, even \nif they have no concept of what that might be. \nI, however, am not lucky enough to be so blissfully ignorant. As soon as I cross \nthe threshold into Bainbridge’s club, I spot Travian sitting alone in the very center \nof the room. Even had Bainbridge failed to give me a picture-clear description of \nthe man, my eyes would have been drawn to him. He sits sideways at his circular \ntable, one arm cocked to rest on its surface, the other slung straight down at his side, \nholding a cigarette a few inches above the floor. This servant is by no means \nhandsome, but he exudes an aura of confidence and power that is difficult to ignore. \nHis knife-thin body seems simultaneously relaxed and poised to spring. The music, \nhowever, does not seem to affect him, for outlined against the backdrop of the \ndance floor, he remains perfectly motionless. \nStanding transfixed, I garner the notice of two of Bainbridge’s servants who \nhave taken positions inside the club. They recognize me and nod in unison, \nsubtly motioning in Travian’s direction as if I didn’t know where he is. At this \nsignal, Travian looks up, first at the two servants - \nwho, by their startled \nreactions, must have thought until that moment that Travian was unaware of \ntheir presence - \nthen at me. His movements are slow and precise, like the \nmotions of an owl or a robot. I can feel his gaze like a laying on of hands. Ignoring \nthe two servants, Travian cocks his head and glances purposefully at the empty \nseat across the table from him. \nAs with any adversarial contest between unequal opponents, the posturing for \ndominance begins immediately. Travian has taken a position closest to the door, \nso I must walk up to and then past him to take my seat. He also remains seated, \ndisplaying his greater ease and comfort. As I move to my chair, his eyes remain \nlocked on mine, swiveling to follow my every move. My face is acasual, unreadable \nmask. I steeple my fingers in front of my chin and lean on my elbows just far enough \nso that Travian has to turn in his seat to face me. \nhe retrieves his wrinkled handkercheif. \n* \n* \n* \nM I N D ’ S  E Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n\n\n“Speak,” I command him. \n“Didn’t Bainbridge come with you?” Travian asks, glancing significantly at \nseveral people around the room. Each one looks away when Travian makes eye \ncontact. “Enough of his entourage is already here.” \n“They’re just here to make sure you can’t leave,” I respond, surprising him a \nbit. “There are also three plants in the line outside and two men watching each of \nthe rear entrances.” \nTravian glances around again, trying to remain calm despite the rising surge \nof panic I felt so recently myself. My admissions confuse him and keep him off \nbalance. I have carefully rehearsed what information I can let slip to Travian, as \nwell as how hard he will have to pry and barter to get it. \n“Good old Bainbridge,” he says at last, taking an unsteady drag from his \ncigarette. “Ever thorough.” \n“Who is your master?” I ask, staring insistently through the pall of bluish \nsmoke. Travian blinks. \n“Didn’t Bainbridge tell you what I told his people to tell him?” he asks, his \ncigarette dangling in no-man’s land. “They should have said-” \n“What do you hope to gain from this?” I ask, hoping to keep him off balance \nand perhaps trick the information out of him. \nHowever, I’ve gone too far too fast, and I end up sounding like a Monty Python \nroutine. Instead of answering, Travian relaxes, letting a thin, callous smile crawl \nacross his face. Leaning back in his chair, he stubs out his cigarette and rests his \npalm on the table. \n“Not so fast there, slick,” he drawls, turning back to the side as he was when \nI found him. “You don’t want to blow your wad before I’m even ready.” \nI try to maintain dignity and put on a look of patriarchal disapproval. Travian \ndoesn’t even look. I doubt he can even smell my sewer-stench through all the \nsmoke that hangs in the air around him. \nSo tell me at your pace,” I concede, making the offer sound like a benign \nallowance. “You wanted someone to listen to you, otherwise you wouldn’t have \ngone to all this trouble.” \n“Soon enough,” Travian says. He taps out another cigarette from a wrinkled \npaper pack and lights it behind his hand. The flickering glow makes the black in \nhis hair dance like an oil spill. \nI easily wait Travian out as he smokes the cigarette from end to end insilence. He \ngrows tense with anticipation, pretending to look around at the patrons of Bainbridge’s \nclub, though likely scouting possible escape routes. Finally, when he has convinced \nhimself that every avenue out of the room (the building, really) is covered by creatures \nlike himself, he turns to me and begins to speak. Having been feigning disinterest and \nboredom, I look away from the dance floor and give Travian my attention. \n“First, I know who you are,” he says, crushing out the last of his coffin nail in \nthe heavy glass ashtray on the table. “I didn’t request you specifically, but I knew \nthat Bainbridge would go looking for you when I told him where I’d be tonight.” \n“Why?” \n“Well, I wanted it to be you they sent,” he says, looking away briefly. ‘‘I heard \nabout how you dealt with some of my people back when they were going all gung- \nho greenpeace on us. According to them, you were really fair. You listened.” \n‘ 6  - \nA POSITION \n01 S T R F N ~ T H  \n\n\n“And that’s what you want now, why you’ve gone to so much trouble,” I ask. \n“Yeah, man,” Travian nods with growing excitement. “That’s all.” \n“The logging situation arose out of credible concerns and legitimate differ- \nences of opinion,” I tell him, my voice growing cold. “You are nothing but a petty \nterrorist.” \n“But you have to,” Travian says plaintively, feeling his advantage slip away. \n“I know things.. ..” \n“You know nothing,” I interrupt, dropping my hands to the table’s surface and \nleaning forward. “Not ifyou thought we woulddeal with a stupid, arrogant servant.” \n“But I found out-” \n“What you found out is irrelevant.” My voice stays at a normal level to avoid \naccidentally revealing anything to the average bystanders, but my eyes blaze. “You \nbetrayed your oath of servitude, and for that, your life is garbage to us.” \nTravian blinks but reveals no fear. “Not if you knew what I know. Lafonte was \ninto some serious shit before I-” \nI know the name and affiliation of every one of my kind in my city, though not \nthose of their servants. Ellen Lafonte - \none of Bainbridge’s class - \nis young and \nweak, and it is no longer such an unreasonable surprise that her servant could have \ntaken her prisoner. There are issues of status that must be addressed, however, \n“serious shit” notwithstanding. \n“Before what?” I lay on. “Before you locked her in her chambers without \nsustenance?” \n“She’s not in her chambers, dammit,” Travian snaps, struggling to keep his \nvoice as level as mine. “And she’s not without-” \n“Ah, so you brutalized her and left her for dead somewhere?” Knowing \nLafonte, such a claim would not be so unreasonable. If I guess correctly, Travian \nis her senior in age. Doubtless the same is true for physical prowess as well, which \nwas why Travian was assigned to guard her in the first place. “My authorities will \nnot look kindly on that at all.” \n“Look, she’s fine,” Travian growls, leaning across the table at me. “I just \ndrugged her when I brought her food.” \n“Ah,” I smirk sardonically. “So you drugged her and left her for dead?” \nTravian slams a fist on the table, drawing several stares and the direct \nnotice of several of Bainbridge’s servants. ‘‘I told you she’s safe at the warehouse \nwhere I wo-” \n“You want to be heard?” \nA look of horror crosses Travian’s face and he closes his eyes. “Shit!” \nGlancing at the nearest of Bainbridge’s servants, I nod significantly and give \nthe subtle signal Bainbridge told me to give. Without hesistation, Travian jumps \nfrom his seat and reaches for something under his coat. As three of Bainbridge’s \nservants surround Travian-seeming \nto appear from the very air, they move so fast \n-I \nsnatch up the heavy glass ashtray from the table and hurl it at Travian’s wrist. \nThe bones there crack, Travian yelps and a large black pistol clatters to the ground. \nTwo of Bainbridge’s servants grab Travian by the shoulders, and the third scoops \nup the pistol before anyone notices it. Anyone who cares to look will probably \nassume that the clatter was that of the ashtray. \nM I N D ’ S  \nE Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n4D \n\n\n“You gotta listen to me,” Travian says, struggling against the servants who \nhold him and cradling his swelling wrist. “Lafonte is into some serious shit, I’m \ntelling you. Stuff even people like her aren’t supposed to be into.” \nBainbridge’s servants look questioningly at me, and I only sit back in my chair. \nMy disguise belies no tension or question. “Escort him out.” \n* \n* \n* \nBainbridge meets me not 10 minutes later. He breezespast the line at the front \ndoor like it isn’t there and sits down opposite me in the chair Travian sat in. I order \ntwo drinks from one of Bainbridge’s servants and look at my employer with pride. \n“That was somewhat easier than I thought, I must admit.” \nBainbridge grins at me behind his perfumed handkerchief, making me want \nto cringe. “One must remember one’s place. You did well to remind Travian of his, \nalbeit later than I am sure his master would have appreciated.” \n“Indeed.” \nThe drinks -two glasses of deep red wine - \narrive, and Bainbridge says, “Did \nTravian tell you anything else as you spoke to him?” \nI gulp down the first swallows from my glass before I answer. Bainbridge will \nhave to forgive the breach of culture; I haven’t put anything in my stomach since \nI woke up. \n“Nothing regarding his motivation,” I tell him. “He would only say that \nMadame Lafonte had involved herself in some sort of illicit clandestine affair.. . .” \nBainbridge’s lip twitches behind his own glass. \n“Doubtless a bargaining ploy to buy himself a few more precious moments \nof life.” \n“Most likely,” I say cautiously. Why did Bainbridge hesistate? “It is odd, \nhowever, that he merely took her captive instead of putting her to death.” \n“Like most servants,” Bainbridge says, his mouth still behind the wine glass, \n“Travian did not understand the nature of our society. Ones such as we are not \ngiven to the emotional weakness necessary to give those methods their power.” \nI don’t respond to that. Instead, I drink off the rest of my wine (though more \nslowly) and sit, watching the dancers on the floor. \n“Is something wrong?” Bainbridge asks. I notice that his wine glass is empty \nalso. “You’re scowling. That’s a truly unattractive look on you, let me assure you.” \n“Just thinking too much, Bainbridge,” I tell him, still looking away. “The \nunfathomable concerns of our kind, if you will.” \n“I will not,” Bainbridge grins, gesturing roguishly. “We have more pleasant \nthings to talk about. Like your payment and the employment negotiations. You’ve \nmade a fine start here for us this evening, and it’s not even midnight! Let us hope \nevery night is so productive.” \nI hold up a smile, though the feeling dissolves behind it. “Yes, let us hope so.” \n(This story appeared previously in the Athens by Night newsletter.) \nA P O S I T I O N  Of S T R E N G T H  \ne \n\n\nMAYRAY! \nA N  OBLIVION \nADVENTURE \nI N  THREE \nPARTS \nby Lindsay Woodcock \n1Wt good w\nd\n \na magazine dewoted to Mind’s Eye Theatre be without a nod here \northere toactualplot?StoryteUingis,afterall, \nwhatthesegamsareaUabout,andyoucan’tteU \nagood, ewocatiwe, interestingstory without awinningplot. If you’re justjoining us, this is Part \nTwo of Mayday!, a three-part adventure for Obliwion. Part One, Ambassador, appeared in \nthe March issue of the Journal and began the intrigue. So, in an attempt to help you keep your \nliwe-action chronicles cuwent with World of Darkness continuity, we present.. . . \nPART \nTwo: DEPLOYMENT \nSome technical notes before we begin again: No ready-made adventure could \npossihly account for player creativity, Narrator preference or even pure chance. \nThere are just too many variables at work in a live-action context to make for a \nsingle story that will work for everyone. Flexibility is essential. Keeping that in \nmind, then, each installment of this adventure is broken into individual scenes. \nThe scene descriptions are divided into two sections: Hard Info and Choices. \nThe Hard Info category presents facts, events and information that must \nsomehow occur or be revealed for the adventure to run as planned. Feel free to use \nexisting social structures, Narrator characters or your favorite plot devices to do so; \nthe how is not important as long as the what comes across. \nThe Choices category is, again, just what it might appear. The story’s \nflexibility plays a large part in these sections, as both Narrator and characters \ndevelop the plot. As long as the skeleton of the adventure - \nthe Hard Info - \nis \nintact, don’t worry about forcing the flesh into any particular shape. \nThough this adventure is designed for asmall to medium size Circle of wraiths, \nit can easily accommodate a larger troupe. Narrator characters, Spectres and all \nmanner of other characters show up, and all of them need players to make the \nexperience rise to its potential. Again, feel free to use existing characters outside \nof the central Circle, as having familiar elements introduce or elaborate on new \nplot threads only increases the dramatic power and believability of the game. Plus, \nemploying existing characters to drive this plot serves as a more direct motivation \nfor the characters to get involved, and it makes the players feel like active \nparticipants in the development of the plot, rather than simple agents acting in \nsomeone else’s story. However, if none of the existing plot-characters in your game \nseem appropriate to this story, we include our concepts of some of the major players \nat the end of each installment. \nA final note: The three parts of Mayday! mix and match with your existing \ngame readily enough. You could wait until the remaining part is released, then play \nthem all together as a stand-alone adventure, or you could play each part as it comes \nout in the Journal, waiting for the next installment before you play again. You \ncould weave each installment into an ongoing game, letting events snowball or \nleaving loose ends to keep players wondering what’s going on. Above all, remember \nthat it’s your game, and this adventure works like salt - \nseason to taste. \nAnd players, everything else past this point is Storyteller material, so if you don’t \nwant to spoil the surprise, read no further. \nMAYDAY! \n\n\nDEPLOYMENT \nPart Two is the most freeform of the adventure’s installments. It’s also the \nmost dangerous: Inter-wraith relations have a tendency to be volatile, at best. \nVirtually all of the events that occur are direct results of the characters’ actions in \nPart One - \nactions that could and should have been influenced by player \ninnovation and character interaction and are therefore unpredictable - \nso only \na few have been detailed for you. Character and roleplaying guided the Circle into \nthe situation it finds itself in at the outset of Part Two, and the way through this \nchapter is, again, through character and roleplaying. \nS U C ~ C ~ E S T I O N S  \nThis installment has a few more new characters than the first one. The most \nimportant character your troupe meets during this game is Joseph Sauvant, a \nHierarchy agent assigned to the Circle’s case. The Circle has a potentially vital relic \n- \nNakagawa’s box of Heretic contacts and plans - \nand the Hierarchy wants it. If \nthe characters went to the Hierarchy for help in Part One, Sauvant is likely to try \nto talk the group into handing the box over. If they chose one of the other options, \nlike the Renegades, he might be inclined to use less diplomatic tactics. Other \ncharacters the Circle might run into are the two Heretic agents within the \nHierarchy who are out to silence the group, Heretic cult members, Renegade leaders \nand Hierarchs trying to preserve order. If you created any or all of these characters \nwhen you played Ambassador, it’s a good idea to use the same ones again. Of course, \nif the characters came from a pre-existing chronicle, you can just brief the players \nand not worry about making any new wraiths. \nThere aren’t many propsfor thischapter; it’s almost entirely based oncharacter \ninteraction rather than the discovery of some new relic. The item cards for the relic \nbox, the wakizashi and anything else you used in Part One should be sufficient. \nS C E N E  ONE \nHard Info: \nThe Hierarchv now knows - \neither because the wraiths told them voluntarilv \nin Part One or through the Hierarchy information network-about the box and the \nfact that the Circle has it. If the Hierarchs don’t have the relic already, they want it. \nThe same goes for the Heretics. However, now that their plans have been \nfouled up (Nakagawa falling into the Harrowing and the box going to the Circle), \nthere are new agents in town. The Heretics listed on the paper in the relic box are \nmembers of a cult with branches in almost every city in the Shadowlands and \nStygia. That cult is now on the brink of being discovered, and the agents have been \nsent in for cleanup and ass-covering maneuvers. Though the Heretics who tried to \ntake the Circle out for “knowing too much already” in the first installment of \nMayday! failed (if your Circle made the choice to approach the Heretics), these \nnew agents are here to finish the job. \nWhat’s really going on here? Now is when you, as Storyteller, find out. The \nJade Empire has been planning to invade Stygia, with the help of the covert Heretic \ncult, for some time now. The characters are at ground zero for the invasion of their \nNecropolis. No matter what the characters do, this attack is going to happen, and \nit’s going to happen on a fixed schedule: one day after the characters first receive \nthe relic box from Nakagawa. This timetable should absolutely not be immediately \nobvious to the players or the characters. They should be able to figure it out - \neven \nthe radar controllers at Pearl Harbor had all the signs right there at their fingertips, \nafter all - \nbut the Storyteller shouldn’t just hand it to them. \nM I N D ’ S  \nB Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n\n\nChoices: \nCharacters can attempt to investigate the Heretic cult further. They \nmight try to infiltrate it or pump information from other wraiths, or they might \ngo about spying from a more arcane angle. The amount, nature and veracity of \nthe information they get is up to the Storyteller and Narrators, but keep in \nmind that the invasion plot is carefully guarded and will not be divulged at all \nlightly or willingly. \nIf the characters have already gone to the Hierarchy or if they choose to go to \nthe Hierarchy now, they can attempt to help in the investigation of the cult, \nassuming they've convinced the legionnaires to mount one in the first place! \nVarious Social challenges and extensive roleplaying should be called for, as the \nHierarchy is extremely suspicious of the characters. \nThe Hierarchy has a few bad apples in its barrel. Two Heretic cult infiltrators \nhave made it into the ranks and they work actively, though subtly, to keep the \ncharacters from getting involved. They will do their utmost to quash any investi- \ngation the Hierarchy might launch. \nHeretic cult agents tail the Circle. The characters have to work extremely \nhard to find out about the surveillance, much less do anything about it. Characters \nmight attempt to mislead the spies or they might use a more direct approach and \nconfront the agents openly. Of course, the fact that there are cult spies following \nthe Circle makes infiltrating the Heretic cult considerably more difficult. \nIf the characters chose to \ntake refuge with the Renegades \nin Part One, they might get in \ngood with the Renegade lead- \nership. Careful prodding and \ndemonstrations of trustworthi- \nness ought to earn the \ncharacters some information: \nNakagawa's disappearance was \nnot random. The Renegades \nhad enough foreknowledge of \nthe invasion to not only re- \nsearch the Jade wraith's Fetters \nbut to arrange to have one of \nthem - \nthe teacup - \nde- \nstroyed in order to send him \ninto a Harrowing and, with \nany luck, keep the invasion \nfrom happening. \nSocial and status-related \neffects of this chapter are po- \ntentially \nprofound. \nHierarchy-affiliated Circles \nmight gain status and per- \nhaps a more tangible reward \nfor their help. Groups ap- \npealing to the Renegades for \nprotection and support might \nstrengthen their alliances \nM A Y  D AY! \n\n\nand open channels to new sources of support - \nand gain the severe disapproval \nof the Hierarchy while they’re at it. Clumsy characters could very easily find \nthemselves on the top of everyone’s shit list! \nDon’t forget the taint on the wakizashi Nakagawa was carrying in his box. \nWhether in the handsof aplayer’scharacter or aNarrator, the potential for Catharsis \nis a strong story line and makes for interesting plot twists. \nThis chapter should end either one day after the Circle obtained the relic \nbox or when the characters have come to some sort of decision about how to deal \nwith the Jade invasion (if they’ve found out about it) or the race for the relic box \n(if they haven’t). \nSo ends this the second installment of Mayday! Look for Part 111: Invasion in the \nDecember issue of the Journal, wherein this thrilling plotline reaches its climax and \nconclusion, after which the Underworld willnever be the same. The following is a “skinand \nbones” cheat-sheet of suggested Traits and a background sketch for Joseph Sauvant, the \nHierarchy agent assigned to retrieve the relic box from the Circle. \nTHE \nI N V E S T I ~ A T O R  \nT H E  SKIN \nSauvant was a patient and obedient French soldier, in life. The only thing \nhe lacked was ambition; he never managed to rise above the rank of private even \nthough he had the ability and the raw skill to go much further. His civilian life \nwas quite similar: He loved a woman, but not enough to marry her; he had a few \nfriends, but no special comrades. Only his mediocrity and his desire to do better \nbrought him to the Shadowlands when, long after he had left the army, he was \nkilled by a thief. \nNow, Joseph Sauvant is a careful wraith, dedicated to doing his job thoroughly \nand well. At the moment, his job is to get Nakagawa’s relic box and all the \ninformation contained in it from the Circle and take it back to the Hierarchy - \nand he uses whatever means he deems necessary to get that job done. If the \ncharacters managed to convince the Hierarchy to listen to them in Part One, they \nfind Sauvant persistent and rational in his attempts to convince them to hand over \nthe box. In any other case, Sauvant demonstrates exactly what made him a good \nsoldier: relentless attention to his task. He might comer the characters and verbally \nbrowbeat them. On the other hand, he might comer them and physically browbeat \nthem - \nhey, whatever works. \nT H E  BONES \nPERSONAL \nINEORMATION \nName: Joseph Sauvant \nLife: Soldier \nDeath: Random violence \nNature: Follower \nDemeanor: Bravo \nRegret: Never having made anything of himself \nM I N D ’ S  E Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n\n\nSTATISTICS \nMental Traits: Attentive, Determined, Disciplined x 2, Patient, Vigilant \nSocial Traits: Commanding, Dignified, Genial, Intimidating \nPhysical Traits: Athktic, Brawny, Enduring, Ferocious x 2, Rugged x 2, Tough \nAbilities: Brawl, Bureaucracy, Firearms, Meke,Repair, Stealth \nArgos (all innates): Enshroud, Phantom Wings, Flicker \nCastigate (all innates): Soulsight \nMoliate (all innates): Sculpt, Martialry \nGet Ahead in Hierarchy (Pride) \nAlways be Right (Vanity) \nProtect his Living Home (Love) \nFind his Family (Love) \nHome in Life \nFrench Army Uniform \nThe Rifle he Carried \nA R CAN o I \nP A S S I O N S  \nE BTTE R S  \nB A C K C ~  \nR O U N D S  \nHierarchy Status \n3 \nSAUVANT’S \nS H A D O W  \nD A R K  PASSIONS \nArtifact \n3 (coiled whip made of braided soul material) \nThe Abuser \nDestroy Wraiths of Higher Status (Jealousy) \nDrive Everyone Away (Self-Hatred) \nSpectre Prestige \nTainted Relic (military baton) \nTHORNS \nMAYDAY! \n\n\nERFQUFNTLY ASKFD \nQUFSTIONS \nA \nThe constant evolution of Mind’s Eye Theatre brings new and different \nquestions to the game. This issue, we tackle questions and comments about \nThe Shining Host. No one’s a greater critic of a writer’s work than the writer \nhimself. Thus, when I went looking for a rules update, I turned to the author \nof The Shining Host, Peter Woodworth. He had so much to say that I devoted \nthis entire section to his info. \nSend your Mind’s Eye Theatre questions to: \nWhite Wolf \nAttn: Mind’s Eye Theatre Journal, Frequently Asked Questions \n735 Park North Blud, Suite 128 \nClarkston, GA 30021 \ncarlawhite-wolf.com \n\n\nTRAITS \nTRAIT \nM A X I M U M S  \nChangelings have the following Trait maximums for their Social, Mental and \nPhysical Trait categories: childlings 10, wilders 12, grumps 16. Please note that any \nbonusTraits gained from a kith‘s Birthrights (sidhe Awe and Beauty, trollTitan’s Power, \nyou name it) and only their Birthrights may allow them to go over these limits. Thus, \nit is possible for a grump to have upward of 18 Traits in certain rare circumstances. \nWILLPOWER \nUSAGE \nThis system should be updated in keeping with other games. A Willpower Trait \nmay he spent to gain a retest against (not ignore the results of) a Social or Mental \nChallenge, including supernatural powers that rely on such challenges where it’s \nappropriate. Willpower may also be used to replenish Traits in one category (Social, \nMental, Physical) only once per session. \nMERITS 8 ELAWS \nWhy were so many Birthrights &a Frailties made into Merits & Flaws? \nThis is one of the most frequently asked questions about the The Shining Host. The \nidea behind this innovation was to show how the various cultures of the world have shared \nelements of their mythologies over time, and thus how some rare faeries have come to be \na blend ofdifferent legendary traits. For example, in some cultures, bogam also have sharp \nhearing and keen eyesight in addition to their craftsmanship ability, and many legends \nspeak of dread redcaps who possess the strength of ogres. These unique Merits &Flaws were \nthus designed to allow a character to show the gradual evolution of the fae as they spread \nacross the world, not to min-max a character into some mythical Ultimate Changeling. \nTrue Faith (7 Trait Supernatural Merit) \nTrue Faith was accidentally omitted. See Laws of the Hunt, page 92, for details \non Trw Faith. \n(A cautionarynote -True Faith is rare to beginwith and evenmore rare among \nthe Fair Ones. A player should have a wery good explanation to give the Storyteller \nfor how his character came by such an unusual state of mind for the fae.) \nOverconfident (1 Trait Personality Flaw) \nThe Negative Traits indicated in the text of this Flaw are the Impatient and \nGullible Negative Traits, which eshu possess naturally; a character still gains the \nTrait value of the Flaw, naturally. \nCharmed Life (5 Trait Supernatural Merit) \nOnce per session, the Storyteller may alert the player to a hunch his character \nhas about a particular situation (You get the sudden impression that going down that alley \njuuuuuuuust might be a mistake). In other words, the character gets a spooky feeling \nbefore something happens in game, thus giving him the chance to change his mind \nor rethink his strategy. An important use of this capacity allows the character to \nnegate a combat situation before it starts in order to prevent it or make it come out \nbetter than it would have if the character were to enter it unaware. If the character \ninitiates the situation anyway, he can’t back up events or change his mind if things \nturn out badly for him, because of a hunch he had about the first outcome. No \ninformation is retained about events that did not happen thanks to this Merit, and \nno one but the Charmed character benefits from this Merit. \n(Note: This Merit can be extremely powerful, and it should be used no more than once \npersession, ifeventhatoften. StotytellersshouldretaincompletecontroloverthisMerit, and \ncharac:terswhooveruseitmaysmreceivingfalse hunchesandothererroneous dormation.) \n\n\nA R T S  \nS O V E R E I G N  ( PROTOCOL) \nPlease note that this Art means that if the cantrip is successful, the target may not \nbreak Protocol for the court occasion in any way unless he spends a Willpower Trait. \nIf Protocol is cast on an area by using the Scene Realm (as is commonly done at a \nfreehold), any who wish to break Protocol within the boundaries of the cantrip must \nbeat the caster in a Static Social Challenge for every disobedient action they wish to \nperform. Characters may also spend a Willpower Trait to cancel Protocol for them- \nselves (but not the rest of those characters present). Note that in either case the caster \nwill know that Protocol has been challenged but not necessarily by whom unless the \nrebellious character makes it obvious. \nREALMS \nS CE N E  \nAs this Realm was constructed for an average-size area of play, such as the ground \nfloor of a house, the numbers for this Realm may need some doctoring to make it useful \nin larger settings, such as conventions. Feel free to manipulate the numbers to make \nthe Realm work in your game, though Storytellers should take care to maintain game \nbalance (somone crisping everyone in the game with a single Pyretics strike tends to \nmake for a lot of unhappy players) and that the numbers won’t run the Storyteller \nherself ragged trying to keep up with the scope of players’ magics. When in doubt, use \nthe names of each level of this Realm (Closet, Guest Room, Ground Floor) and your own \ncommon sense as your guide. Changeling isn’t about yardsticks, after all. \nBANALITY \nUSING \nACTIVE \nBANALITY \nAGAINST \nCANTRIPS \nThe phrasing in the rulebook makes it too easy to abuse invoking Banality as a \ndefense against Kithain cantrips. It is therefore recommended that Storytellers limit \nthe characters who are able to actively use Banality in the following ways: First, \ncharacters who have been enchanted by a changeling cannot actively invoke their \nBanality - \nthey’ve been taken along for the ride, whether they like it or not. Second, \ncharacters must be at least vaguely aware that something out of the ordinary is being \ndirected at them - \na mortal orderly chasing a pooka may use his Banality if the pooka \nbeginsscreaming gibberishand pointingat him, but he cannot doso ifthepookasimply \nsits in acomer, staring into space. Finally, some troupes may wish to rule that characters \nwho have invoked their Banality to try to cancel a cantrip and failed may not attempt \nsuch a defense for the remainder of the scene, as the characters’ disbelief has been \nshaken too badly to serve them for the time being. \nCANTRIPS \nRETESTING CANTRIPS \nOverbidding is a perfectly legal means of retesting a cantrip - \nafter all, what \ngood are Bunk Traits unless they can help in the possibility of an overbid, too? \nHowever, assume no Ability-related retests are possible unless the cantrip specifi- \ncally allows them - \nin other words, no ‘‘I use Subterfuge to retest my Chicanery \npowers.” Advanced troupes may elect to allow Ability retests of cantrips if the player \ncan explain how the Ability directly relates to the cantrip’s use. In order to avoid \nendless retests and other entanglements, it is recommended that beginning troupes \nrestrict retests to overbidding, the House Eiluned Boon and defensive Gremayre uses. \n\n\nCAND \nDE \n. \nE RU \nT IN YOUR HANDS. \nPLAY \nCONCENTRATE ON TH \nK BRINGS THE RULES \nHORROR OF WRAITH: \nmOBLlVIONAND TRANSLATES IT I \nIND'S EYE THEATRE SETTING. \nA COMPLETE MIND S EYE IHEATRE RULEBO \nk' - \nTHE WORLl \nG THE DREAMING. \nAND REVELATI01 \nES THAT TELL OF \nBE USED AS A AC \nW E  \nAND LON( \nD OF (h4NGEI.W \n\n\nMI \n\n\nI E N T  HORIZON: \nUPCOMIN~ \nL A R P  EVENTS \nSOUTHWESTERN \nU S  \nDomain of Mountain Shadows; Provo, UT \nEvery Tuesday \nNikki McCoriston, N.Burton@m.cc.utah.edu \n(801) 363-3959 \nMoonlight Masquerade; Marysville, CA \nEvery Saturday (8 pm) \nJennifer Young, kaidin@syix.com \nLabyrinth of Crying Shadows (Sahbat Game); Sacramento, CA \nEvery Friday \nAdam Abrilmson, vallombrosa@hotmail.com \nN O R T H C E N T R A L  \nU S  \nDominion of Solitude; Topeka, KS \nSecond Saturday of each month \nJefierv P.
