Each came up, smiled his or \nher most puppetlike smile, and then announced who he or she was - \nas if I knew or cared. Then each in turn got miffed when I refused to \nreciprocate or (more importantly) preen and wiggle to be introduced \nto an artist of such devastating beauty and importance. \nThey fail to understand that I have no interest in who they are, \nwhat they do, or what favors they want from me in return for the grace \nof their presence.

      "text": "I turn and wander through the museum. The collection is fairly \nimpressive - \nthe Pre-Raphaelite collection is displayed well, if a bit \nunimaginatively, and the more modern pieces are banished to side \ngalleries. I must grant the Americans that. They may not have any \nclass of their own, but they know enough to buy it when they can. \nA few more twists and turns, and I find myself in the room where \nthe prince of this city holds his court. He is a tall man, with high \ncheekbones and a severe haircut, and I see him surrounded by his \nchilder and advisors as he gravely nods at the tale of some ragamuffin \nneonate in an ill-fitting suit. There is nothing important going on \nhere, just a shadow-show of the way in which princedom was formu- \nlated a half-millennium ago. \nEventually, the neonate finishes, the prince waves his hand, and \nthe hangers-on applaud politely at this display of princely justice. I \nhave no idea what just went on, nor do I care. I am here on business. \nI step forward. “Your Majesty,” I say, knowing full well that this \ncreature whom I must present myself to is at least three centuries \nyounger than I. He looks up at me, a bit astonished at the “interrup- \ntion.” Various of his ghouls and retainers move to place themselves \nbetween him and myself, as if that would make a difference were I to \nwish His Majesty harm. \n“I wish to present myself to you, and request permission to dwell \nin your city, in accordance with our Traditions,” I hear myself saying \nby rote. I helped to draft those Traditions, once upon a time. \n“We appreciate your adherence to those Traditions,’’ is his re- \nsponse, and internally I cringe. Not another American who’s adopted \nand abused the royal “we,” please - \nit’s another case of aping form, not \nfunction. “Your name and business in our domain?” The toadies and \nharpies around him lean forward, anxious to be the first with tidbits of \ngossip about my arrival. One, I can see, has been so rude as to look at \nmy aura - \nher eyes are wide in shock, and she’s taken a step or two \nbackward. It’s a pity, really; she’s a pretty little thing, though suffering \nfrom that plague of fashion that says all of our kind must wear black lace \nin some form or other. \nI smile at her before I introduce myself, small acts of sadism being \none of the few pleasures I still permit myself. “Of course, Your Majesty. \nI am called Alaric Montfleury, at least in these days, and my business \nin your city is strictly personal.” \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "The prince leans forward and scrunches up his face in that way that \nseems to indicate deep concentration to the younger generations. \n“Montfleury? We seem to recall that name.” \n“Of course you do, Your Majesty. Your sire must have told you \nstories about learning the odd bit of statecraft from my humble self, in \naddition to his sire. Your grandsire and I spent several years together \nat MontsCgur, watching the Cathar experiment play itself out.” He’s \nnot listening. I smile. He, and one by one his court after him, have \nrealized exactly what stands in front of them. \n“Of course,’’ he finally stammers after a few seconds of silence. The \nwoman, who was swifter on the uptake than the others, turns and \nhurries out of the room, her footfalls clattering in the emptiness. \n“I.. .we welcome you to our domain, trust that you will abide by the \nTraditions, and hope to have your company at future Elysiums. Until \nthen.. . .” He lets the sentence trail off. I nod, and smile, and bow from \nthe neck as I turn and walk out. \nIt’s simple, really. My words were inconsequential - \na reference \nto my age and history, and His Majesty’s place (inconsequential) \nrelative to all that. What I really told him was, “I can take this city away \nfrom you any time I wish, and both you and I know it. I have no \nintention of doing so, mind you- \nif I wanted a city, it wouldn’t be this \nhuddled collection of pollution-stained towers on the shores of a \nstinking and frozen lake. This is merely a visit, a brief stop as I head \nwestward toward a city more worthy of my effort.” \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

I expected as \nmuch. \n“What is your real purpose here?” she asks. She is very young and \nvery new to the blood, and terribly serious. “There can’t be anything \nhere that you want.” \nI shrug and look her up and down, then say, “Perhaps.” She blushes \na bit, and I find myself vaguely disappointed in her distinct lack of self- \ncontrol. “But really, I’m just passing through, and I wanted to make \nsure I followed the Traditions to the letter so as not to cause Prince \nMichael any undue stress.” It’s near enough to the absolute truth as to \nmake no difference, not that she will ever believe me. \nShe laughs humorlessly. “I’m sure your presence is a great comfort \nto him. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make your stay \nhere more pleasant?” Or more hief, I can hear her think. \n“NO, nothing at all,” I reply. “I thank you for your pains, though. \nNow if you’ll excuse me?” She curtsies and steps out of my way, and I \ncontinue on toward the door. Behind me the whispers are already \nstarting, as I knew they would. \nHe’s here to take the princedom.. . . He’s going to support Michael and \nwipe out any opposition.. . . He’s actually an archon here to cleanse the \ncity.. . . There are other elders coming.. , . He’s a diabolist.. . . He mentioned \nthe Cathars so he must be Sabbat.. . . He’s really Michael’s grandsire.. . . I \ndidn’t see his reflection in the glass, so he must he h o m b r a  antitribu.. . . \nHe’s going to kill us all.. . . \nAs the doors swing shut behind me (no ghoul doormen, a bad sign, \nthat) I laugh softly to myself. All the little vampires are now scram- \nbling to recalculate their petty plots, trying to imagine where I fit into \ntheir equations. All of the conspiracies will unwind themselves and \nrecombine, murders will be committed, bodies will vanish, and gener- \nally everything will go to hell in a handbasket because the nice neat \nlittle picture the local Cainites have painted for themselves has just \nbeen shattered. Parochialism never pays, not among our kind, and \nthese children are about to learn that lesson the hard way. \nIt shouldn’t take long for the firestorm to flare up and burn itself \nout. The survivors will be smarter, faster and more cunning than they \nare now, and the fat with which Michael’s surrounded himself will be \ntrimmed away. I won’t be surprised if Michael himself goes. His \ngrandsire will be disappointed, no doubt, but has grown inured to those \nkinds of losses over the centuries. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "A\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\n \nThis book outlines elders for The Masquerade, what a player \nshould be ready for, and what a Storyteller needs. From rules to \ncharacter creation to storytelling, there is plenty here to use and abuse. \nMind’s Eye Theatre \nWe’ve all been playing Mind’s Eye Theatre in some way, long \nbefore we had a name for it. Instead of vampires, we were cowboys and \nIndians, or cops and robbers. In essence, it’s a game of make-believe, \nbut one with very specific parameters of time and place. In that make- \nbelieve, players interact with each other as characters, assisted by a few \nrules to help them resolve conflicts. \nMind’s Eye Theatre is about telling a story. The Storyteller \ncreates the framework of the plot, then turns the players loose to watch \nthem create a story of that plot. In between, there are shifting alliances, \nvagaries of circumstance, conflicts and consequences. It is not a story \nabout a goal, but how that goal was reached. \nThe Elders \nAn elder is simply defined as a vampire who has managed to \nsurvive for at least 250 years. Such a short definition does not, \nhowever, cover the many requirements the elders demand before one \nis allowed to sit at their table. It takes strength, resources and cunning \nto arrive at the coveted title of “elder”; age is no longer the sole \nprerequisite. \nThe Camarilla was founded on the will of the elders, and even now \nthey continue as its strongest proponents and leaders. It is elders who \nmake up the upper ranks of the Inner Circle and Justicars, and often \nsome of the most powerful princes. Yet they are also the favored pawns \nof the Methuselahs in their unending Jyhad. In the Sabbat, the elders \nare the bishops and paladins, feared by the younger ranks, for only the \nstrongest can survive to such age. Their fanaticism and callousness can \ngive even the most experienced crusaders pause; no one crosses them \nonce and lives to boast of it. Yet they are well aware that the Anarch \nRevolt was started because of elders who overstepped their bounds, \nand that their youth watch them now for the first signs that another \nrevolt may be due. \nElders are often thrown into a chronicle with little preparation, \nusually seen as just one more type of vampire at Elysium. They may \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "know a few more things, happen to be a little older, and have a few \nmore nifty tricks up their black sleeves, but they’re still just like every \nother vampire in a chronicle, right? Yes and no. Elders do know a few \nmore things that most vampires, they are a little older than the average \nvampire in a story, and they have plenty of interesting aces to play. \nWhat both players and Storytellers tend to forget is the impact that \nelders can have on a chronicle, and that elders have been around far \ntoo long to be classified as merely “old bloodsuckers.” \nAn elder’s appearance can easily throw a chronicle into a tizzy, \neven if she doesn’t directly affect the action. Why is she here? What \ndoes she want? Does her presence bode good or ill? Her age and \nexperience will draw many younger vampires into her sphere, hoping \nfor favorable attention or assistance with a particular quandary. She \nwill be in turn affected by her extremely long unlife, often unable to \nadapt to new technology, bearing long grudges and hatreds, and cursed \nas the only emotions left to her become hate, rage and bitterness. \nHow to Use This Book \nElder characters are not meant for new, inexperienced or imma- \nture players. These creatures are centuries old, and require more \nthought and time than the average vampire. Their mere presence can \nunbalance a chronicle if they’re simply thrown in without thought, \nand immature players can run roughshod over the story and other \nplayers simply by dint of their enhanced abilities. This book is meant \nto prepare both Storytellers and would-be players for the challenges of \nelder characters. \nThe Only Rules That Matter \nBehave yourself so everyone can enjoy the game. These are meant \nto keep players safe and non-players happy. If you’re playing an elder, \nyou should be able to recite these like the Traditions. If you can’t \nremember either, you’re not ready for this. \n# I-It’s Only a Game \nIf your character is embarrassed by a peer, a plot falls apart, a rival \nwins the day - \nit’s just a game. Don’t take things too seriously, as that \nwill spoil not only your fun, but also the fun of everyone around you. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "Leave the game behind when it ends. It’s one thing to hold an \nimpromptu salon at a friend’s house to complain about the prince, but \ncalling your fellow elders at four in the morning to discuss Gehenna \ntakes things a little too far. Keep some perspective. \nNever actually have physical contact with another player. No \nmatter how careful you are. Accidents happen. Use your imagination \nand the rules to cover physical logistics. \nNever climb, jump, run, leap or swing from anything during a \ngame. Keep the action in “live action” low-key. If you can imagine \nyourself as a millennia-old bloodsucking creature of the night, then \nyou can certainly imagine yourself to be running when you’re actually \nwalking. \n#4-No weapons \nFake or real weapons of any sort are forbidden. Even obviously silly \ntoy weapons are not allowed. Such props could give people the wrong \nimpression as to what you’re doing, and in the dark could conceivably \nbe mistaken for the real thing. Swords and other sharp pointy things \nfound in catalogs or at Renaissance fairs look real enough to worry \nbystanders, even if they are peace-bound. No matter how well a sword \nfits your character’s persona, leave the stuff at home. Use item cards to \nrepresent weapons instead. \n#5-No Drugs or Drinking \nThis one is (or should be) a real no-brainer. Drugs and alcohol do \nnot create peak performance. They reduce your ability to think and \nreact, meaning that, among other things, your roleplaying ability will \nbe impaired. Players impaired by drugs and alcohol are a danger to \nother players and to the game. There’s nothing wrong with playing a \ncharacter who’s drunk or tripping from some tainted blood, but \nactually bringing such stuff to a game is in bad taste at worst, illegal at \nbest. Don’t do it. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "#6=BeMindful of Others \nRemember, not everyone you see, or who sees you, will be playing \nthe game. A game can be unnerving, even frightening, to passersby. Be \nconsiderate of nonplayers in your vicinity, and make sure that if you \nare in a public area, your gameplay actions are not going to alarm \nanyone. Stay alert to your surroundings, and be ready to drop character \nif nonplayersstart to take notice. Trying to explain to the local security \nthat you’re not really hunting an unfortunate mortal as part of a \nmidnight salon is an exercise in futility. In fact, if you can warn your \nlocal police force and merchants about what you’re doing before you \nstart playing, they may be a bit more sympathetic to your presence. \n#7-The RulesAre FIexible \nFeel free to ignore or adjust any of the rules in this book if it will \nmake your game better. We at White Wolf call this “The Golden \nRule.” If some rule included in this book (beyond the ones listed here) \ndoesn’t work for your troupe, change it. But be consistent and fair. \nNobody likes rules that change every week nor “no-win” scenarios. If \nyour troupe finds a new way to handle, say, a certain Tremere ritual \nthat works better for you than the one in this book, go for it. The idea \nis to have fun. \nNot “Win.”Not “GO out and kill everyone else.”Just “Have fun.” \nThe object of the game is not to win. In fact there are no rules for \n“winning.” The goal is to tell great stories, not to achieve superiority \nover the other players. The game is not about the goal, but about the \njourney to get to the goal and what happens along the way. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Don’t think just yet about all the historic events \nshe’s witnessed. Think about who she was before she was Embraced, \nhow long she’s been a vampire, and how unlife has changed her over \nthe years. Find something that you, the player, can identify with in \nyour character. What’s so exciting about her that you would want to \nbe her for the evening, much less a thousand years? \nRemember that many of your character’s attitudes may have crystallized \nwhen she was Embraced. No doubt she has changed little over the years, and \nshe’ll be glad to tell you that such adherence to her beliefs has served her well \nover the centuries. Think about when your character was Embraced, how \nshe felt about certain ideas, and how time has battered at those ideals. \nLastly, think a little about what she was before her change and \nafterward.

Does \nshe have a paramour she has a rendezvous with in Paris every five years, \nor has she given up on love since her mortal mate passed on? How many \nchilder has she sired? Think of three events that marked turning points \nin her unlife (for better or worse), and how did she take the changes? \nThe Name Game \nWhen creating an elder character, it will certainly \nbehoove you in the long run to put a little thought into her \nname. After all, you’re going to be hearing it for quite a \nwhile, and an unwise choice will have you cringing when \nyour name is called. \nNames like “Slash,” “Blade,” “Desire” and the like are \nfine for neonates, but the average vampire on the street \nisn’t likely to know the difference between “Blade, Brujah \nneonate” and “Blade, elder of Clan Toreador.” If such a \nthing would bother your elder considerably, then spare the \nother characters your continual wrath, and choose again. \nThose elders who can afford to keep single names are \nusually high enough in the power structure that it doesn’t \nmuch matter, or their names have certain attachments that \nmake them impossible to mistake. Examples of these in- \nclude Rebekah (the Monitor of Chicago), Democritus (the \nVentrue Justicar) or Critias (elder of Clan Brujah). \nConsider the following factors: How old is your charac- \nter? What is her heritage? Where is she from? What were her \nparents’ names? Were there circumstances when it was \nnecessary for her to change her name (such as coming \nthrough Ellis Island, or to avoid harassment)? \nBaby name books are excellent resources to find varia- \ntions on John and Mary (or Ian and Maire, or Jean and \nMarie). Look for those that list ethnic equivalents and the \ncountry of origin.

      "text": "- \nChoose Your Clan \nYour choice of clan in many ways determines what sort of unlife your \ncharacter can look forward to, and how he might spend his old age. It is \npossible to be Caitiff (that is, clanless), but such elders are ftequently \nscorned by their “clannish” brethren. See Laws of the Night, Chapter \nTwo, for complete descriptions about the clans available. \nChoose Nature and Demeanor \nYour Nature is your character’s true self, often hidden under many \nprotective layers. Your Demeanor is the face you show most often to \nthe world, particularly when dealing with people. A character’s \nNature and Demeanor can be wildly different, similar, or even the \nsame, though few people (much less, elder vampires) are so open. A \ncomplete listing of possible Natures and Demeanors can be found in \nLaws of the Night. \nStep W o :  Attributes \nAttributes describe everything a character naturally is. Are you \nstrong? Are you brave? Are you persuasive? Questions such as these are \nanswered in your choice of Attributes. Attribute Traits use adjectives \nto describe a character in the same way that adjectives describe a \ncharacter in a book. So the Nosferatu elder who rescued his favorite \nghoul from a witch-hunter might be Energetic, Ferocious and Deter- \nmined, while the Ventrue who is currently attempting to outmaneuver \na Tremere for control of a television station might be Clever, Cunning \nand Shrewd. \nUnlike a regular vampire character, elders’ categories fall as 10 \nPrimary, eight Secondary and six Tertiary. \nStep Three: Advantages \nAbilities \nThese represent your abilities beyond the outline provided in \nAttributes. This is what you can do and what you’ve learned, rather \nthan who you are. Abilities let you perform specialized tasks that are \nonly possible with training - \ntranslating another language, under- \nstanding an occult text, working a computer. Elder characters begin \nwith eight Abilities. A full listing of these Traits can be found in Laws \nof the Night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Some Disci- \nplines may not be available, or may require special penalties. Check \nwith your Storyteller before taking anything you’re not 100 percent \ncertain about. \nInfluences \nThis reflects your elder’s control over mortal society. Over time, \nsuch control can grow to amazing proportions, making elders truly \nformidable opponents in the Jyhad, and one reason why they are \nfrequently unopposed.

The target can then do \nnothing but try to solve it, although she may defend herself as normal \nif attacked. The Riddle is so impenetrable that it can actually damage \nthe minds that think about it. The target must try to guess the answer \nto the riddle once every 10 minutes, whether she knows the answer or \nnot. For every incorrect guess made by the target, she takes one \nnonaggravated wound. Every third incorrect guess results in the target \nreceiving an aggravated wound. Malkavians or Kindred with two or \nmore Derangements are immune to this side effect. The duration of \nthis power is one night, or until completion of the riddle. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

With each succeeding generation, the \nvictim hangs onto an additional Trait and Fortitude power. \nIn order to inflict Paper Fksh on a target, you must defeat her in a \nMental Challenge and subsequently tear a picture of her in half. \nSpirit of Torment \nSimilar to The Haunting, this ritual lets you summon a spirit to do \nyour bidding. This time, the spirit is capable of taking on physical form \nand doing real damage to others. \nIn order to summon the spirit, you must win a Social Challenge. \nOnce the challenge is won, the spirit obeys your commands to the \nletter, until to it takes damage to its physical form. At that point, the \nspirit flees. \nThe spirit has 13 Physical Traits, three Social Traits and seven \nMental Traits. It has three Willpower Traits, the Abilities of Brawl x \n4, Intimidate x 3 and Occult. It also has the following Disciplines: \nHeightened Senses, Aura Perception, Might, Unseen Presence, Musk of \n1000 Faces and Cloak the Gathering. When trying to frighten someone, \nthe spirit gains three bonus Social Traits (Frightening x 3). Further- \nmore, by winning a Mental Challenge, the spirit can see and identify \nanything in the local Near Umbra. \nIn its normal form, the spirit is incorporeal, but it can spend a \nMental Trait in order to become corporeal for five minutes.

She faces \ndemands for her obedience and appeals to her Humanity. She gingerly \npicks her way through her first nights among the Kindred, hoping to avoid \nenlisting unintentionally an elder’s pet cause. \nPrecisely who are these powerful, aged Kindred who tempt her? \nHow can they be so equally at home within both the city’s darkened \nalleys and its brilliantly lit salons? W h y  do they seek her participation in \ntheir schemes when they could as easily slay her, or bend her will to their \nown with their centuries-old power? Why should such as they care one \nwhit for the alliance of one so young and seemingly helpless as she? \n“They” are the elders, the Kindred who have withstood the test of time \nto survive beyond their neonate years and their ancilla decades to greet \nthe centuries anew each night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

      "text": "The exact point at which a vampire gains the designation of “elder” is \nnot clear. Most Kindred agree that when a vampire manages to survive at \nleast several centuries, she may begin using the title “elder” with some \njustification. The longevity requirement varies immensely around the \nworld. To become an elder in Europe, for example, requires centuries more \nthan it would in the New World. Despite these chronological disparities, \nelders are generally between 200 and 1,000 years old, give or take a century, \nand they are by and large Kindred of at least the eighth generation. What \nmakes such characters so attractive to Mind’s Eye Theatre players? \nThe Joy of Elders \nShall not the judge of all the earth do right? \n- \nGenesis 18: 25 \nElder characters are, by their very nature, more powerful than the \naverage neonate or ancilla character. The elder’s amassed strength is \ndue largely to the fact that she has lived for so much longer than her \nyounger cousins, gaining access over time to a greater number and \nwider range of Abilities, Influences and Disciplines. She gains a \ndecided advantage in many situations, which many players can find \nappealing. Consider the practical advantages of an elder character: \n-The elder’s Blood Pool is greater than that of younger vampires, \nfor she has learned over the centuries the means to extract the very last \niota of supernatural energy from the vitae she consumes. \n- \nAn elder has honed her Attributes so that her limitations exceed \nthose of most non-elder characters. For example, an elder may call upon a \ndeeper reserve of Willpower, enabling her to compel or resist compulsion \nmore readily than younger characters. These physical characteristics, in \naddition to age, are a large part of the reason why elders are usually treated \nwith some modicum of respect. After all, it doesn’t pay to mouth off to one \nwho could leave your bones in splinters or wipe your mind clean like a slate. \n- \nThis enhanced reputation and respect often translates into \nactual status. Elders are, with few exceptions, influential figures in \nKindred society, holding ranks as princes and primogen or bishops and \npaladins. Whatever their allegiance - \nCamarilla, Sabbat, or anarch \n- \nelders frequently occupy positions of authority, and are loath to \nsurrender them to ambitious childer. To reinforce this pecking order, \nyounger vampires are taught by their own sires and elders to heed the \nolder members of their respective clan and sect and maintain a healthy \nrespect for those elders of other clans as well. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

An elder character has the potential to add a \nsignificant layer of depth to an existing chronicle. Your Storyteller may thrust \nyou into the thick of any number of pre-existing conflicts, or she may use your \ncharacter to introduce a new subplot or theme. An elder’s impact on a story \nis almost immediately noticeable. For example, an elder automatically \nbecomes a focal point for a variety of plots and subplots, simply due to her age \nand status. When younger Kindred are faced with puzzles, problems and \nmysteries, they often turn to their elders for direction. Your reaction to such \npleas will determine the extent to which you become involved in these plots. \nLater you may recognize that your character influences the game in \nmore subtle ways. Let’s say a current storyline includes an anarch pack \nlurking on the fringes of the city’s vampire society. Then your character \narrives. The anarchs will certainly want to know more about any elder \nwho shows up in their city, and any elder would want to know more \nabout potential diablerists. Your character may have to contend with \nanarch surveillance teams, or a test of her haven’s defenses. She may \neven find herself squaring off against the anarchs later in the chronicle \nwhen the pack decides fully to announce its presence.

It \nwould be absurd to think that you would allow your hard-won status, \npower and authority to be snatched from your hands by overeager, \nundeserving upstarts of weaker generations. No prince casually \nsurrenders the throne to an ambitious ancilla; no elder willingly \nturns over her primogen seat to an impetuous fledgling. This is the \nparadox of Kindred existence - the constant ambition of the \nneonates and ancillae to achieve the same rewards as the elders, \njuxtaposed with the elders’ desperate measures to thwart these \nattempts at any cost. \nYou will probably find it beneficial to your elder existence to resist \nsudden or drastic change in the status quo, unless such nontraditional \nbehavior clearly benefits your position. Greet sweeping proposals for \nsocial reform as but one step removed from anarchy. React to suggested \nbusiness improvements with barely concealed disinterest, promising \nto review the plans as soon as your busy schedule permits. Stamp out \nthe anarch threat wherever and whenever it may be found, for the \ndissatisfied grumblings of youth soon turn to the scorching flame of \nrebellion. Above all, instill in the younger, less experienced Kindred \na mortal fear of the enemy, whether it be Camarilla or Sabbat. Point \nout that this hated foe’s victory would be all but assured if the elders \nwere to fail in their unceasing vigilance, and that the city would have \nfallen for certain were it not for your own tireless efforts against the \nadversary. \nDealing with Kindred Society \nSome players view elder characters simply as a means of crushing \nall who cross their paths during a game. They leave a trail of mangled \ncharacters behind them, and turn even more viciously on any charac- \nter who dares admonish them. Such a player should expect to be \nshunned by the rest, or even expelled from the chronicle, and deserv- \nedly so. While violence is part and parcel of the World of Darkness, \nhabitually behaving in this manner simply to gain attention or to \ndisrupt the game shows a lack of the maturity necssary for playing a \npowerful character. Elevating the story above the pitfalls of mindless \nviolence is the equal responsibility of every player, but particularly \nthose who portray elders, since they have the capacity to inflict the \nmost damage with the least amount of effort. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

This is not to say that you must perpetually sacrifice your own \nenjoyment, but rather that you should be equally aware of your fellow \nplayers’ needs alongside your own. \nHow, then, should you deal with those Kindred who lack your age \nand capabilities? What do you say to the neonate who insults you at the \nprince’s court, or do to the ancilla who ruins plans that took years to \nlay? Wise elders master their immediate impulse to destroy the \noffender, and instead embark upon a time-honored campaign for the \nloyalties, hearts and minds of their detractors and supporters alike. \nMost chronicles will feature some degree of stratification be- \ntween character power levels. A few characters will probably be \nelders, and thus relatively more powerful in terms of resources and \ncapabilities. The majority of characters will probably be ancillae and \nneonates, the rank and file of the Kindred world. In this type of game, \nsuccessful elder characters work to improve their individual power \nbases, without calling undue attention to themselves. You did not \nsurvive to become an elder, after all, by stepping boldly to the front \nevery time danger threatened and volunteers were requested.

Instead, encourage your more “youthful” allies, \nassociates and subordinates to investigate the strange occurrences, \nunusual circumstances and mysterious happenings while you remain \n“behind the lines” to direct the action. \nInteracting with Neonates \nSome elders make the mistake of viewing neonates as little more \nthan flunkies, beasts of burden, slaves or scapegoats. These elders, \nsecure in the belief that their elevated status will protect them from \nreprisal from the weaker strata of vampire society, don’t feel they need \nto bother with neonates. Nothing could be further from the truth. A \nsingle neonate equipped with knowledge and training is worth twice \nthe value of the most loyal ghoul retainer or mortal servant.

Sabbat neonates who break free of their elders’ control are \nno longer useful tools to be used against the hated Camarilla. At \nbest they wander without direction; at worst they might join the \nenemy. For these reasons it is vital that you, as a prudent elder, treat \nneonates not as chattel but as a valuable resource. Unless you want \nthem to start preaching against the established order- and against \nyou as its defender - \nconsider them as the building blocks of your \nown power base. \nBefriending neonates is an excellent in-game method of simul- \ntaneously fostering character interaction and supporting elder \ninvolvement in the story.

The familiar elements \nof scale, scope, characters, plot and theme all take on significantly \ndifferent dimensions when their focus is entirely on elders, and require \nsome greater consideration. Depending on the type of story you’re \npreparing, and the nature of your group, planning some escape routes \nin case things go wrong may well be the most important step in \npreparing to tell this kind of story. \nThe Elements of a Successful Elder \nChronicle \nScale \nThe all-elder chronicle generally functions more smoothly with \nrelatively few players. It is not unknown for games to consist of more \nthan 50 players, or even several hundred when staged at conventions \nand the like. If you find that you’ll have more than a dozen or so elder \nplayers, you may wish to reconsider - \nthe more elders you include, the \ngreater the potential for the game to get out of control on a regular basis. \nFifty elders gathered in one place is an invitation to disaster, particularly \nwhen those elders have no one to lord it over but each other. \nLimit your elder chronicle to a size that you feel you can comfort- \nably handle. Attempting to narrate the titanic battle in a metropolis \npopulated by a hundred Kindred with allegiances to different sects is \na story best done with a large team of Storytellers and Narrators. If you \ndecide to run a large elder chronicle, be certain you have enough \nNarrators and assistants to keep everything moving along. Elder \ninteraction is complex at best, but the wheeling and dealing becomes \nalmost Byzantine with a group of a dozen or more. So much political \nmachination produces a significant amount of extra paperwork and \nrecord-keeping as you track all the shifts in ownership of Boons, Status \nTraits, Influences and alliances throughout the course of the game. \nShould disagreements between many elders lead to open violence, you \nand your Narrators will be very busy resolving all the challenges such \nconflict entails. You’ll be grateful for the dozen or so Narrators \nfollowing the latest challenges when you’re in the middle of yet \nanother Brujah-Ventrue rumble that’s reducing the room to rubble. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

You might decide to focus your scope more \nnarrowly, dealing with matters which interest only the individual \ncharacters. Sucha chronicle might be the story of a small coterie ofelders \nand their search for one of their number who’s suddenly disappeared. \nThe chronicle’s scope should be neither too trivial to merit the \nelders’ attention, nor so overwhelming that they feel helpless and \ndecide not even to bother trying. You may wish to vary the apparent \nscope throughout the progress of the story - \nthe scope of events can \nbe increased or decreased. For example, let’s start with a story that \ninvolves an outside threat annexing the characters’ mortal Influences. \nThe elders eventually discover and confront the nemesis raiding their \nresources. After the threat is dealt with, the scope of the game can be \nrefocused on the individual elders and their efforts to rebuild their \ndamaged power bases.

When elders from a \nneighboring city view this escalating warfare and decide it’s the perfect \ntime to annex the characters’ city into their own domain, the scope \nincreases again. \nBe careful that the scope of your story doesn’t expand until it \nreaches a point where it utterly dwarfs the characters, and players may \nprefer to throw up their hands in frustration rather than continue. \nMonitor the players’ reactions to the chronicle, and use this informa- \ntion to help guide you in adjusting the scope to its best dramatic \nadvantage.

Players can quickly become \nfrustrated if forced to play characters they do not enjoy, and frustrated \nplayers can become destructive. For these reasons, confine premade \ncharacters to shorter chronicles. \nAllowing players to create their own characters does not mean that \nthey should do so in a vacuum, nor that they have carte blanche during \nthe creation process. Set your boundaries and stick to them. If you have \ndecided that Followers of Set are inappropriate to the story you are \ntelling (because they are the primary antagonists or some such), inform \nthe group of this restriction before they start creating characters. Tell \nthem what sort of story you’re planning for and what they need to think \nabout, such as that your city is Camarilla-controlled, that independents \nneed a very good reason for appearing in the city, etc. \nEach character should have a strong motive that is clear to both \nthe player and you; it will be invaluable when creating subplots.

The \nmacro-level, or main plot, should revolve around events, ideas or \nsituations which involve the entire group. This is the foundation of \nyour story, and should be appropriately related to the theme, mood and \nscale you chose (see above). All the elders should have the opportunity \nto participate to some degree in this main plot, although the charac- \nters’ own actions largely determine the level of involvement they \nhave. It is perfectly acceptable to let the macro-level of plot be rather \nobvious - \nthis doesn’t mean it should be trite or clichcd, but rather \nthat it is fine to make the main element of the story obvious to the \ncharacters, since this is what will initially attract their attention. \nThe micro-level of your story consists of subplots, most of which \nshould be designed with individual characters in mind.

An elder Kindred would not survive long if she \nmade a habit of revealing her true agenda to everyone she met. An \nelder’s business is her own, and she is within her rights to inform the \nnosy little neonates to buzz off. Of course, that will probably only \nserve to pique the players’ interest - \nwhat reason could an elder \nhave for being in the city? \nNeonate and ancillae characters tend to gravitate toward elders, \nand you must take this fact into account when integrating an elder into \nyour chronicle. If an elder and ancilla are of the same clan, it is \nunderstandable that the latter may feel some measure of kinship with \nthe elder and wish to introduce himself to the newcomer. The Ventrue \nelder who enters a domain controlled primarily by Clan Brujah will \ncertainly find herself the focus of a great deal of neonate attention from \nthe very first night. Younger characters sometimes hope to request \nfavors of their elders, and sometimes they plan to ride their coattails. \nSometimes they seek another voice to involve in the simmering \ncauldron of local politics, and other times they hope to gain a new ally \n(or perhaps a convenient scapegoat for an impending fracture of the \nMasquerade). Neonates may be awestruck by these living relics, and \napproach them for advice or guidance (such as how to live as long as \nthey have). Ancillae may find them a welcome voice of experience \nafter dealing with neonates for so long (even though they themselves \nare now the “neonate” in the eyes of the elder). If the elder’s Nature \nand Demeanor permit it, encourage the player occasionally to dis- \npense a few in-character snippets of advice or praise to the “deserving \nyoungsters.” Such interaction can make the difference between a \nsmooth transition and an unwelcome intrusion. \nElders will most likely experience difficulty in steering clear of any \nprominent plot threads you have already woven into your chronicle. \nIndeed, it would be a very strange thing not to be approached by any \nyounger vampires regarding some mystery or problem. Should an elder \ntruly wish to remain aloof from a given plot or subplot, she may well \nbe obliged to extricate herself continuously from difficult or even \ncompromising positions.

All \nthose in your vicinity must win a Static Physical Challenge against \nyour Physical Traits or be knocked to the ground for one minute. \nTaking the Skin \nBy slaying a creature and expending a Mental Trait, you subsume the \nBeast-nature of your victim. Doing so allows you to transform yourself into \nthe creature for the remainder of the night. In order for this power to work, \nyour victim must be a preadator of some sort, and must have at least one \nBlood Trait’s worth of vitae - \nno ants or mosquitoes are permitted. \nUpon completion of the proper preparations, you transform physi- \ncally into your victim and gain its appearance, Physical Traits and \nabilities. (Note: The full effect only takes if the victim is a “natural” \ncreature. Taking the Skin of a Lupine or other vampire, for example, \nonly grants you the victim’s appearance.) \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n"

Jar1 the Gangrel learned his lesson that night; there’s no \nreason Winslow the Ventrue should benefit even if the same player \nstands behind both.

Storytellers should, of course, feel free to play \nwith this limitation when the story demands. \nHow long do characters stay in torpor? \nOnce in torpor, characters sleep for two weeks per Beast/Path \nTrait they possess, though the sleep can be longer for older Cainites \n- \nanything that knocks a Methuseleh into torpor packs a helluva \nwallop.

It is usually considered ended when the \nmajority of plot devices have been accomplished. When the rules \nstate that something is returned or replenished at the end of the \nstory, it is strictly a Storyteller decision as to when this occurs. \nMy vampire character has a Garou Fetish that requires Gnosis to \nactivate.

Non-Assamite vitae is poison to clan members, \nand if ingested into their system it causes damage as normal. \nAssamite antitribu blood can bring clan members out of torpor, but \nno other vampires’ blood can. \nCan Assamites commit diablerie ? \nNo, they cannot.

Each came up, smiled his or \nher most puppetlike smile, and then announced who he or she was - \nas if I knew or cared. Then each in turn got miffed when I refused to \nreciprocate or (more importantly) preen and wiggle to be introduced \nto an artist of such devastating beauty and importance. \nThey fail to understand that I have no interest in who they are, \nwhat they do, or what favors they want from me in return for the grace \nof their presence. When you have watched over Rembrandt’s shoulder \nas he painted “The Night Watch,” the childish scribblings these \nmoderns try to perpetrate as art upon an unsuspecting populace.. .let \nme simply say that they leave something to be desired. Such is the curse \nof America - \nthere’s not a city on this continent older than I am, and \nthese home-grown Kindred have no sense of style or of history. \nThey’ve seen a century and think that makes them “elders.” Any one \nof them who’s outlived his mortal family feels entitled to whine about \nthe agony of his endless existence. \n.\nI\n \nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\n,\n \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nI turn and wander through the museum. The collection is fairly \nimpressive - \nthe Pre-Raphaelite collection is displayed well, if a bit \nunimaginatively, and the more modern pieces are banished to side \ngalleries. I must grant the Americans that. They may not have any \nclass of their own, but they know enough to buy it when they can. \nA few more twists and turns, and I find myself in the room where \nthe prince of this city holds his court. He is a tall man, with high \ncheekbones and a severe haircut, and I see him surrounded by his \nchilder and advisors as he gravely nods at the tale of some ragamuffin \nneonate in an ill-fitting suit. There is nothing important going on \nhere, just a shadow-show of the way in which princedom was formu- \nlated a half-millennium ago. \nEventually, the neonate finishes, the prince waves his hand, and \nthe hangers-on applaud politely at this display of princely justice. I \nhave no idea what just went on, nor do I care. I am here on business. \nI step forward. “Your Majesty,” I say, knowing full well that this \ncreature whom I must present myself to is at least three centuries \nyounger than I. He looks up at me, a bit astonished at the “interrup- \ntion.” Various of his ghouls and retainers move to place themselves \nbetween him and myself, as if that would make a difference were I to \nwish His Majesty harm. \n“I wish to present myself to you, and request permission to dwell \nin your city, in accordance with our Traditions,” I hear myself saying \nby rote. I helped to draft those Traditions, once upon a time. \n“We appreciate your adherence to those Traditions,’’ is his re- \nsponse, and internally I cringe. Not another American who’s adopted \nand abused the royal “we,” please - \nit’s another case of aping form, not \nfunction. “Your name and business in our domain?” The toadies and \nharpies around him lean forward, anxious to be the first with tidbits of \ngossip about my arrival. One, I can see, has been so rude as to look at \nmy aura - \nher eyes are wide in shock, and she’s taken a step or two \nbackward. It’s a pity, really; she’s a pretty little thing, though suffering \nfrom that plague of fashion that says all of our kind must wear black lace \nin some form or other. \nI smile at her before I introduce myself, small acts of sadism being \none of the few pleasures I still permit myself. “Of course, Your Majesty. \nI am called Alaric Montfleury, at least in these days, and my business \nin your city is strictly personal.” \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe prince leans forward and scrunches up his face in that way that \nseems to indicate deep concentration to the younger generations. \n“Montfleury? We seem to recall that name.” \n“Of course you do, Your Majesty. Your sire must have told you \nstories about learning the odd bit of statecraft from my humble self, in \naddition to his sire. Your grandsire and I spent several years together \nat MontsCgur, watching the Cathar experiment play itself out.” He’s \nnot listening. I smile. He, and one by one his court after him, have \nrealized exactly what stands in front of them. \n“Of course,’’ he finally stammers after a few seconds of silence. The \nwoman, who was swifter on the uptake than the others, turns and \nhurries out of the room, her footfalls clattering in the emptiness. \n“I.. .we welcome you to our domain, trust that you will abide by the \nTraditions, and hope to have your company at future Elysiums. Until \nthen.. . .” He lets the sentence trail off. I nod, and smile, and bow from \nthe neck as I turn and walk out. \nIt’s simple, really. My words were inconsequential - \na reference \nto my age and history, and His Majesty’s place (inconsequential) \nrelative to all that. What I really told him was, “I can take this city away \nfrom you any time I wish, and both you and I know it. I have no \nintention of doing so, mind you- \nif I wanted a city, it wouldn’t be this \nhuddled collection of pollution-stained towers on the shores of a \nstinking and frozen lake. This is merely a visit, a brief stop as I head \nwestward toward a city more worthy of my effort.” \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAs I turn the corner back toward the museum’s front entrance, I \nhear footsteps. It is the pretty young woman, of course. I expected as \nmuch. \n“What is your real purpose here?” she asks. She is very young and \nvery new to the blood, and terribly serious. “There can’t be anything \nhere that you want.” \nI shrug and look her up and down, then say, “Perhaps.” She blushes \na bit, and I find myself vaguely disappointed in her distinct lack of self- \ncontrol. “But really, I’m just passing through, and I wanted to make \nsure I followed the Traditions to the letter so as not to cause Prince \nMichael any undue stress.” It’s near enough to the absolute truth as to \nmake no difference, not that she will ever believe me. \nShe laughs humorlessly. “I’m sure your presence is a great comfort \nto him. In the meantime, is there anything I can do to make your stay \nhere more pleasant?” Or more hief, I can hear her think. \n“NO, nothing at all,” I reply. “I thank you for your pains, though. \nNow if you’ll excuse me?” She curtsies and steps out of my way, and I \ncontinue on toward the door. Behind me the whispers are already \nstarting, as I knew they would. \nHe’s here to take the princedom.. . . He’s going to support Michael and \nwipe out any opposition.. . . He’s actually an archon here to cleanse the \ncity.. . . There are other elders coming.. , . He’s a diabolist.. . . He mentioned \nthe Cathars so he must be Sabbat.. . . He’s really Michael’s grandsire.. . . I \ndidn’t see his reflection in the glass, so he must he h o m b r a  antitribu.. . . \nHe’s going to kill us all.. . . \nAs the doors swing shut behind me (no ghoul doormen, a bad sign, \nthat) I laugh softly to myself. All the little vampires are now scram- \nbling to recalculate their petty plots, trying to imagine where I fit into \ntheir equations. All of the conspiracies will unwind themselves and \nrecombine, murders will be committed, bodies will vanish, and gener- \nally everything will go to hell in a handbasket because the nice neat \nlittle picture the local Cainites have painted for themselves has just \nbeen shattered. Parochialism never pays, not among our kind, and \nthese children are about to learn that lesson the hard way. \nIt shouldn’t take long for the firestorm to flare up and burn itself \nout. The survivors will be smarter, faster and more cunning than they \nare now, and the fat with which Michael’s surrounded himself will be \ntrimmed away. I won’t be surprised if Michael himself goes. His \ngrandsire will be disappointed, no doubt, but has grown inured to those \nkinds of losses over the centuries. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nI could be mistaken, of course. Perhaps the conspirators will show \nsome sense and relax. Perhaps they’ll keep my presence in perspective, \nor want to tippy-toe in my presence so as not to arouse the dread anger \nof the ancient vampire. Perhaps, for once, they’ll behave. \nI hear a scream behind me, and the sound of broken glass. Perhaps \nnot, after all. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDo you know what it’s like to live forever? To watch history pass \nbefore you as a pageant of color and noise that fades to darkness and \nsilence when you recall it? To fear the uncertain future promised by \ntoday’s youth, and to dream of past glories? To rendezvous with an old \nlover every few decades or to spend a century preparing to confront a \nrival for a crime that occurred two millennia ago? \nThe elders of the Kindred not only know, they have lived it. For \ncountless years they have existed, watching civilizations rise and fall, \nmeasuring their lifespans by eras of human history. Their power over \nthe night and Kindred society is something that many vampires envy, \nbut only the foolish would reach for it. Such is the privilege of \nsurviving the centuries. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\n \nThis book outlines elders for The Masquerade, what a player \nshould be ready for, and what a Storyteller needs. From rules to \ncharacter creation to storytelling, there is plenty here to use and abuse. \nMind’s Eye Theatre \nWe’ve all been playing Mind’s Eye Theatre in some way, long \nbefore we had a name for it. Instead of vampires, we were cowboys and \nIndians, or cops and robbers. In essence, it’s a game of make-believe, \nbut one with very specific parameters of time and place. In that make- \nbelieve, players interact with each other as characters, assisted by a few \nrules to help them resolve conflicts. \nMind’s Eye Theatre is about telling a story. The Storyteller \ncreates the framework of the plot, then turns the players loose to watch \nthem create a story of that plot. In between, there are shifting alliances, \nvagaries of circumstance, conflicts and consequences. It is not a story \nabout a goal, but how that goal was reached. \nThe Elders \nAn elder is simply defined as a vampire who has managed to \nsurvive for at least 250 years. Such a short definition does not, \nhowever, cover the many requirements the elders demand before one \nis allowed to sit at their table. It takes strength, resources and cunning \nto arrive at the coveted title of “elder”; age is no longer the sole \nprerequisite. \nThe Camarilla was founded on the will of the elders, and even now \nthey continue as its strongest proponents and leaders. It is elders who \nmake up the upper ranks of the Inner Circle and Justicars, and often \nsome of the most powerful princes. Yet they are also the favored pawns \nof the Methuselahs in their unending Jyhad. In the Sabbat, the elders \nare the bishops and paladins, feared by the younger ranks, for only the \nstrongest can survive to such age. Their fanaticism and callousness can \ngive even the most experienced crusaders pause; no one crosses them \nonce and lives to boast of it. Yet they are well aware that the Anarch \nRevolt was started because of elders who overstepped their bounds, \nand that their youth watch them now for the first signs that another \nrevolt may be due. \nElders are often thrown into a chronicle with little preparation, \nusually seen as just one more type of vampire at Elysium. They may \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nknow a few more things, happen to be a little older, and have a few \nmore nifty tricks up their black sleeves, but they’re still just like every \nother vampire in a chronicle, right? Yes and no. Elders do know a few \nmore things that most vampires, they are a little older than the average \nvampire in a story, and they have plenty of interesting aces to play. \nWhat both players and Storytellers tend to forget is the impact that \nelders can have on a chronicle, and that elders have been around far \ntoo long to be classified as merely “old bloodsuckers.” \nAn elder’s appearance can easily throw a chronicle into a tizzy, \neven if she doesn’t directly affect the action. Why is she here? What \ndoes she want? Does her presence bode good or ill? Her age and \nexperience will draw many younger vampires into her sphere, hoping \nfor favorable attention or assistance with a particular quandary. She \nwill be in turn affected by her extremely long unlife, often unable to \nadapt to new technology, bearing long grudges and hatreds, and cursed \nas the only emotions left to her become hate, rage and bitterness. \nHow to Use This Book \nElder characters are not meant for new, inexperienced or imma- \nture players. These creatures are centuries old, and require more \nthought and time than the average vampire. Their mere presence can \nunbalance a chronicle if they’re simply thrown in without thought, \nand immature players can run roughshod over the story and other \nplayers simply by dint of their enhanced abilities. This book is meant \nto prepare both Storytellers and would-be players for the challenges of \nelder characters. \nThe Only Rules That Matter \nBehave yourself so everyone can enjoy the game. These are meant \nto keep players safe and non-players happy. If you’re playing an elder, \nyou should be able to recite these like the Traditions. If you can’t \nremember either, you’re not ready for this. \n# I-It’s Only a Game \nIf your character is embarrassed by a peer, a plot falls apart, a rival \nwins the day - \nit’s just a game. Don’t take things too seriously, as that \nwill spoil not only your fun, but also the fun of everyone around you. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nLeave the game behind when it ends. It’s one thing to hold an \nimpromptu salon at a friend’s house to complain about the prince, but \ncalling your fellow elders at four in the morning to discuss Gehenna \ntakes things a little too far. Keep some perspective. \nNever actually have physical contact with another player. No \nmatter how careful you are. Accidents happen. Use your imagination \nand the rules to cover physical logistics. \nNever climb, jump, run, leap or swing from anything during a \ngame. Keep the action in “live action” low-key. If you can imagine \nyourself as a millennia-old bloodsucking creature of the night, then \nyou can certainly imagine yourself to be running when you’re actually \nwalking. \n#4-No weapons \nFake or real weapons of any sort are forbidden. Even obviously silly \ntoy weapons are not allowed. Such props could give people the wrong \nimpression as to what you’re doing, and in the dark could conceivably \nbe mistaken for the real thing. Swords and other sharp pointy things \nfound in catalogs or at Renaissance fairs look real enough to worry \nbystanders, even if they are peace-bound. No matter how well a sword \nfits your character’s persona, leave the stuff at home. Use item cards to \nrepresent weapons instead. \n#5-No Drugs or Drinking \nThis one is (or should be) a real no-brainer. Drugs and alcohol do \nnot create peak performance. They reduce your ability to think and \nreact, meaning that, among other things, your roleplaying ability will \nbe impaired. Players impaired by drugs and alcohol are a danger to \nother players and to the game. There’s nothing wrong with playing a \ncharacter who’s drunk or tripping from some tainted blood, but \nactually bringing such stuff to a game is in bad taste at worst, illegal at \nbest. Don’t do it. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n#6=BeMindful of Others \nRemember, not everyone you see, or who sees you, will be playing \nthe game. A game can be unnerving, even frightening, to passersby. Be \nconsiderate of nonplayers in your vicinity, and make sure that if you \nare in a public area, your gameplay actions are not going to alarm \nanyone. Stay alert to your surroundings, and be ready to drop character \nif nonplayersstart to take notice. Trying to explain to the local security \nthat you’re not really hunting an unfortunate mortal as part of a \nmidnight salon is an exercise in futility. In fact, if you can warn your \nlocal police force and merchants about what you’re doing before you \nstart playing, they may be a bit more sympathetic to your presence. \n#7-The RulesAre FIexible \nFeel free to ignore or adjust any of the rules in this book if it will \nmake your game better. We at White Wolf call this “The Golden \nRule.” If some rule included in this book (beyond the ones listed here) \ndoesn’t work for your troupe, change it. But be consistent and fair. \nNobody likes rules that change every week nor “no-win” scenarios. If \nyour troupe finds a new way to handle, say, a certain Tremere ritual \nthat works better for you than the one in this book, go for it. The idea \nis to have fun. \nNot “Win.”Not “GO out and kill everyone else.”Just “Have fun.” \nThe object of the game is not to win. In fact there are no rules for \n“winning.” The goal is to tell great stories, not to achieve superiority \nover the other players. The game is not about the goal, but about the \njourney to get to the goal and what happens along the way. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nw \nI \nWarning \nThis is a quick-and-dirty guide to elder creation. We \nassume you are already familiar with the Mind’s Eye Theatre \ncharacter creation process from The Masquerade Second \nEdition or Laws of the Night. If you aren’t, read through the \nprocess in either Masquerade Second Edition or Laws of the \nNight before you plunge in here. \nAny lists of Traits, Abilities, Disciplines, or Merits and \nFlaws not included here can be found in Laws of the Night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSteps of Character Creation \nStep One: Inspiration - \nWho are you? \n- \nChoose your clan \n- \nChoose your Nature and Demeanor \nStep Two: Attributes - \nWhat are your basic capabilities? \n- \nPrioritize Attributes (10/8/6) \n- \nChoose Traits \nStep Three: Advantages - \nWhat do you know? \n- \nChoose Abilities (8) \n- \nChoose Disciplines (6) \n- \nChoose Influences (6) \nStep Four: Last Touches - \nFill in the details \n- \nAssign Blood Traits \n- \nAssign Willpower Traits \n-Choose Beastpath Traits (Sabbat members must choose a Path) \n- \nRecord Status Traits \n- \nChoose Negative Traits \nStep Five: Spark of Life - \nNarrative descriptions and Extra \nTraits at Storyteller discretion \nStep One: Inspiration - Who are you? \nThere’s a lot to consider when playing an elder, not the least of \nwhich is what makes your character something more than a walking, \nblood-drinking relic. Don’t think just yet about all the historic events \nshe’s witnessed. Think about who she was before she was Embraced, \nhow long she’s been a vampire, and how unlife has changed her over \nthe years. Find something that you, the player, can identify with in \nyour character. What’s so exciting about her that you would want to \nbe her for the evening, much less a thousand years? \nRemember that many of your character’s attitudes may have crystallized \nwhen she was Embraced. No doubt she has changed little over the years, and \nshe’ll be glad to tell you that such adherence to her beliefs has served her well \nover the centuries. Think about when your character was Embraced, how \nshe felt about certain ideas, and how time has battered at those ideals. \nLastly, think a little about what she was before her change and \nafterward. Let questions like these fuel the creative process and spark \nsomething new and different for you. Was she apeasant or a noble? How \neducated was she? Was the Embrace an unwelcome change, or did it \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nempower her? How did her sire treat her? Are there friendships and \ninterests that she has maintained for all these years, and if so, how? Does \nshe have a paramour she has a rendezvous with in Paris every five years, \nor has she given up on love since her mortal mate passed on? How many \nchilder has she sired? Think of three events that marked turning points \nin her unlife (for better or worse), and how did she take the changes? \nThe Name Game \nWhen creating an elder character, it will certainly \nbehoove you in the long run to put a little thought into her \nname. After all, you’re going to be hearing it for quite a \nwhile, and an unwise choice will have you cringing when \nyour name is called. \nNames like “Slash,” “Blade,” “Desire” and the like are \nfine for neonates, but the average vampire on the street \nisn’t likely to know the difference between “Blade, Brujah \nneonate” and “Blade, elder of Clan Toreador.” If such a \nthing would bother your elder considerably, then spare the \nother characters your continual wrath, and choose again. \nThose elders who can afford to keep single names are \nusually high enough in the power structure that it doesn’t \nmuch matter, or their names have certain attachments that \nmake them impossible to mistake. Examples of these in- \nclude Rebekah (the Monitor of Chicago), Democritus (the \nVentrue Justicar) or Critias (elder of Clan Brujah). \nConsider the following factors: How old is your charac- \nter? What is her heritage? Where is she from? What were her \nparents’ names? Were there circumstances when it was \nnecessary for her to change her name (such as coming \nthrough Ellis Island, or to avoid harassment)? \nBaby name books are excellent resources to find varia- \ntions on John and Mary (or Ian and Maire, or Jean and \nMarie). Look for those that list ethnic equivalents and the \ncountry of origin. For last names, the telephone book \nmakes a good start if you have an idea of what you want. \nIf you need help, some research may be in order. It looks \na little silly to have your proud Italian Toreador announce \nhimself as “Giovanni Jones.’’ \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n- \nChoose Your Clan \nYour choice of clan in many ways determines what sort of unlife your \ncharacter can look forward to, and how he might spend his old age. It is \npossible to be Caitiff (that is, clanless), but such elders are ftequently \nscorned by their “clannish” brethren. See Laws of the Night, Chapter \nTwo, for complete descriptions about the clans available. \nChoose Nature and Demeanor \nYour Nature is your character’s true self, often hidden under many \nprotective layers. Your Demeanor is the face you show most often to \nthe world, particularly when dealing with people. A character’s \nNature and Demeanor can be wildly different, similar, or even the \nsame, though few people (much less, elder vampires) are so open. A \ncomplete listing of possible Natures and Demeanors can be found in \nLaws of the Night. \nStep W o :  Attributes \nAttributes describe everything a character naturally is. Are you \nstrong? Are you brave? Are you persuasive? Questions such as these are \nanswered in your choice of Attributes. Attribute Traits use adjectives \nto describe a character in the same way that adjectives describe a \ncharacter in a book. So the Nosferatu elder who rescued his favorite \nghoul from a witch-hunter might be Energetic, Ferocious and Deter- \nmined, while the Ventrue who is currently attempting to outmaneuver \na Tremere for control of a television station might be Clever, Cunning \nand Shrewd. \nUnlike a regular vampire character, elders’ categories fall as 10 \nPrimary, eight Secondary and six Tertiary. \nStep Three: Advantages \nAbilities \nThese represent your abilities beyond the outline provided in \nAttributes. This is what you can do and what you’ve learned, rather \nthan who you are. Abilities let you perform specialized tasks that are \nonly possible with training - \ntranslating another language, under- \nstanding an occult text, working a computer. Elder characters begin \nwith eight Abilities. A full listing of these Traits can be found in Laws \nof the Night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDisciplines \nThese are the vampiric powers available to all undead. Elders may \nbegin with six Disciplines, but you must spend Negative Traits to take \nout-of-clan Disciplines (one per level of out-of-clan). Some Disci- \nplines may not be available, or may require special penalties. Check \nwith your Storyteller before taking anything you’re not 100 percent \ncertain about. \nInfluences \nThis reflects your elder’s control over mortal society. Over time, \nsuch control can grow to amazing proportions, making elders truly \nformidable opponents in the Jyhad, and one reason why they are \nfrequently unopposed. Few are likely to interfere with someone who \ncould quite possibly call heads of state and military leaders to assist her. \nHow many Influences you begin with should be the purview of \nyour Storyteller; six makes a good starting point. Long-time players \nbeing moved into the elder arena may start to purchase their Influ- \nences from the lists given. The Influences listed here are from level six \nand up; lower levels may be found in Laws of the Night. \nStep FORE LastTouches \nFill in the last details, including Status, generation and Will- \npower. \nOeneration \nYour Storyteller will quite possibly have a target generation in \nmind for your character, and may request that you not buy down your \ngeneration with Negative Traits. Elders generally are of the eighth \ngeneration, although the Pretenders attempt to presume eldership at \nninth. \nStatus \nIt is safe to assume that most elders have at least two Status Traits: \nAcknowledged and Respected to start with. Any more will be a matter \nfor your Storyteller to decide. \nWillpower and Blood Traits \nSee Laws of the Night for the starting number of Willpower and \nBlood Traits available to your generation. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBeast/Path Traits \nY \nIt is anunfortunate fact that as a vampire ages, his grip on the Beast \ncan grow weaker. Many find themselves struggling nightly to maintain \nthe facade of order both in their surroundings and in their souls. \nWhether Sabbat or Camarilla, a vampire who’s a ravening monster is \na danger to those around her as well as to herself. At five Beast Traits, \nthe character descends into permanent frenzy, and will most likely be \nput down like a rabid animal. \nElder characters begin with two Beast/Path Traits. You may take \nanother Beast Trait for two Negative Traits, but remember that it will \nnow take only two more Beast Traits to fall into the final frenzy. \nStep Five: Spark of Life \nLike any other vampire character, your elder needs to be fully \ndescribed, putting a little flesh on the bare bones of Traits and \nInfluences. Otherwise, your character is just a cardboard cut-out with \nsome nifty tricks. \nBackground Story - \nSo, what have you been up to all these \nyears? When was your character Embraced, and what did she do before \nthen? What events in history has she witnessed, and how did they \naffect her? \nMotivations - \nSomething must be driving her through these \nlast days. What is it? Is she attempting to escape the machinations of \na Methuselah? Is she searching for Golconda? Does she thirst for \nrevenge against the Kindred who slew her childer? Whether it’s hate, \nrevenge, fear or hope, your elder’s prime motivation will color her \nactions and often reflect on the game around you. \nAppearance- Has she chosen to ignore the fashion parade after \nso many decades, and prefers simple gowns reflective of medieval \ntimes? Does he still sport the muttonchops he wore when he rode at \nGeneral Lee’s side? Look for props and costuming that reflect your \ncharacter’s age and outlook as well as her Traits. \nEquipment -Talk with a Storyteller about the kinds of things \nyou’re likely to start play with. She is, of course, perfectly within her \nrights to disallow LAW rockets, tanks or original Rembrandts. \nQuirks -Everyone \nhas little tricks and peccadilloes that make \nhim unique, such as a favorite curse word, a method of donning a hat \nor the way he relieves stress. In the case of elders, these quirks deepen \n22 \nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nt\nl\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\n \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nover time, and may be leftover habits from other times. When you \nconsider your quirks, think about how and why you started doing such \nthings. If your elder refuses to exit a car until she’s looked in the \nrearview mirror for an all-clear, consider that she was perhaps attacked \nwhen she got out of a carriage one night in the late 18th century, and \nshe has never been careless about such since. Think about habits she \nmight have picked up over the years, and why. Such quirks can be good \nroleplaying aids, and they can establish character more effectively \nthan a name tag and a few challenges. \nSample Character Creation \nMichael has been playing a vampire in MET for some time, and \nhas come a long way as a roleplayer since those first days as a neonate. \nHis Storyteller, Laura, thinks he’s ready for a challenge and is mature \nenough to handle the responsibility - \nshe offers him the role of an \nelder. All she asks is that he keep in mind the sort ofgame she’s running \nwhen he creates the character. Michael asks Laura if there’s anything \nin particular she’s looking for in this elder. While she can’t tell him \neverything she has planned (it would ruin the surprise), she does \nrequest that the character be a sort who could serve in an advisory \ncapacity and occasionally do some “Deep Throat” duty. With a clear \ngoal before him, Michael starts working on fleshing out some early \nskeletal ideas. \nLaura’s game is primarily Camarilla-based with a number of \nmortals. The mood is largely one of mystery and conspiracy, with an \nX-Files sort of theme. Several plots are in the works, but two storylines \nhave begun to stagnate. The presence of an elder would hopefully \njump-start them again. A Sabbat elder would shake things up too \nmuch, and Laura doesn’t want to take her chronicle down that path. \nMichael debates an independent clan, but he decides otherwise when \nhe can’t find areason why such acharacter would appear in a Camarilla \ntown. Finally, he chooses to make his elder a Ventrue, a clan he’s never \nplayed before. He decides that the elder was a student of the great \nphilosophers and was Embraced during the Golden Age of Greece by \na Cainite who wanted to tweak a rival. Over the years, the character \nhas lived many lives and used many names; currently he goes by the \nname “Alexander Dent.” \nAlexander is, as he has always been, a seeker of wisdom, never \nsatisfied with a single easy answer. He debates and deliberates on the \n.\n-\nr\n \nu \nu \nu \nIl \nu \nu \nu \nII \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \n23 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\neternal questions of life, no matter what the era, and Michael thinks \nthat Alexander’s Nature is suggestive of a Visionary. Over the years, \nhowever, Alexander has learned that those who question are not \nalways welcome, particularly in Cainite society, and he’s learned the \ntruth behind “Go along to get along.” Michael decides that Alexander \nposes as a Traditionalist to keep princes and other nosy folks out of his \npersonal business. \nMichael prioritizes Alexander’s Attributes as Mental, Physical \nand Social, and chooses Traits that would reflect someone who grew \nup in the city-state of Athens under the expectations of the times. For \nAlexander’s Mental Traits, Michael chooses Refictive, Wise, Insight- \nful, Knowledgeable and Observant, all Traits that would seem sensible \nfor one who spent most of his years in thought and in various schools \nof philosophy. He decides Rational and Calm are Traits the Ventrue \nwould have cultivated in Alexander. Realizing that there will be \nplenty of Mental Challenges, Michael takes Disciplined, Attentive and \nShrewd, just in case someone gets an idea that Alexander’s introspec- \ntion means he’s a pushover. \nNext come Physical Traits. Alexander would have been expected \nto maintain physical fitness along with mental fitness, so Michael \nconsiders the Traits that would reflect someone who’s fit, but not \nnecessarily “buff.” He eventually chooses Athletic x2, Dexterous x2, \nEnergetic x2, Resilient and Tenacious. Michael decides that Alexander \ndid all right for the times, but just all right. \nLastly come Social Traits. Alexander’s been something of a loner \n(philosophical thinking does tend to be a one-person sport), and \nMichael thinks that Alex knows how to get along with people, but he \nisn’t a glad-hander like many in his clan. Michael decides that \nAlexander is quite Persuasive and Eloquent from all the decades of \ndebate. Alexander is also Dignified and Commanding when he needs to \nbe and is Friendly with those he meets. After choosing what immedi- \nately sprang to mind, Michael isn’t sure what else to take. He asks \nLaura for suggestions, and she looks over his choices so far. After \nhearing Alexander’s sketchy story, she asks Michael if Alex would be \nthe sort to pursue Golconda. Michael agrees, and decides to add \nCompassionate; Alex is slowly learning the ways of Golconda, and this \nindicates he has taken the first steps. \nNow come Abilities. While it might be rare for a Ventrue to be \nwithout Finance, Michael can’t imagine how a Greek philosophy \nstudent would have it. Michael thinks more about what Alex has \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nbeen doing all this time, and most recently, and decides that for the \npast five years Alex has been teaching evening Philosophy courses at \na university. Laura approves the idea, seeing it as the basis for some \ninteresting story hooks. Michael chooses Performance: Debate x2, \nthen Performance: Lecturing (to make sure Alex’s students don’t fall \nasleep in class). He adds Subterfuge and Kindred Lore (Alex has been \naround long enough to learn something of the Sabbat and other \nvampires). Like it or not, Alex will be considered a leader among the \nyouth of the clan, so Michael takes Leadership. Michael’s fairly \ncertain that Alex is fluent in several languages, but he can only afford \ntwo levels of Linguistics - \nhis native Greek and Latin, which are \nboth necessary for Classical studies. \nFor Disciplines, Michael decides that Alex would be far more \nlikely to use Presence over Dominate, and buys Presence up through \nMajesty. He puts the last two levels in Fortitude. \nNow it’s time to buy Influences. As Alexander takes such a high \ninterest in the educational system and spends so much time there, \nMichael takes four levels of University Influence. Michael adds a level \nof High Society, to reflect the various mortal circles Alex travels in as \na professor. Lastly, unable to resist the pull, he takes a level of Finance. \nBecause Alex is Ventrue as well, he automatically begins with a \npermanent Finance Influence Trait. Michael figures you just can’t get \naway from some things, and decides that the Finance Influences were \ngifts from Alex’s sire. \nLaura requests that Alex go no higher than seventh generation. \nFor now, he starts at eighth, but Michael thinks that someone as old \nas Alex should be at least a little lower - \nsomething to consider when \nNegative Traits are bought. He records Alex’s Blood Traits and \nstarting Willpower for an eighth-generation vampire. As Alex is not \nyet well-known in the city, his beginning Status Traits are Acknowl- \nedged and Respected. \nAs Alex is an elder, he begins with two Beast Traits. Michael \nchooses Vigilante and Item (crucifix). Alexander didn’t handle the \ncoming of Christianity too well, and the Inquisition left him with \nmany bad memories. \nMichael takes two Negative Traits, Oblivious (when Alex gets \nbusy with a problem, he forgets to pay attention around him) and \nImpatient (particularly with dull students). These he uses to buy up \nAlex’s generation to seventh, and he records Alex’s Blood (9) and \nWillpower Traits (3). \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSatisfied, Michael passes his sheet to Laura. She looks it over, \nand decides that some areas are a little sparse. She gives him a few \nextra Traits, and suggests that he take at least one level of Dominate \nand one level of Occult Ability. Alexander is going to be in the thick \nof a few things, and Laura wants him to be ready to come out \nswinging. Michael takes the Basic levels of Dominate, a single Occult \nand throws the last three points into Traits - \none Physical (Quick), \none Social (Magnetic) and one Mental (Observant). Laura approves \nAlexander’s final incarnation, and Michael sits down to consider the \nrest of Alex’s long story before joining play. \nInfluence \nObviously, these are much more powerful than the levels given in \nLaws of the Night. The Storyteller should feel free to disallow these \nif they would unbalance a game. \nBureaucracy \ncost \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \nChurch \ncost \n8 \n9 \n10 \nFinance \ncost \n7 \nDesired Effect \nControl over state bureaucrats (legislator, judge, etc.). \nUtilize the resources of internal federal agencies -FBI, \nDEA, ATF, INS, etc. \nAffect foreign policy; utilize the resources of the CIA; \naccess the Secret Service. \nYou can affect change in national legislature and judiciary; \nyou keep the president’s number in your Rolodex. \nDesired Effect \nYou control a nationally known evangelist or organization \nof comparable stature. \nYou have access to the Society of Leopold or other \nChurch-sponsored hunter groups; you have influence \nin a monastic order. \nYou have sway in a major sect. \nDesired Effect \nYou own many businesses locally, and contribute greatly \nto the local economy. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n8 \n9 \n10 \nHealth \ncost \n6 \n7 \n8 \n9 \n10 \nYou can affect the financial stability of other cities \nwithin 50 miles of your own. \nYou have the wealth and backing of amajor corporation/ \nFortune 500 company; you own several businesses; Wall \nStreet jumps when you sneeze. \nYou number among the richest people in the world. \nDesired Effect \nYou control an outpatient clinic/blood bank. \nYou control a major metropolitan hospital. \nAccess and manipulate most all local goings-on in the \nmedical community. \nObtain national funding, drug research and cutting-edge \nmedical information. \nDiscuss matters with the Surgeon General; influence in \nthe World Health Organization. \nHigh Society \nInfluence and notoriety in the mortal world at this level can be as \nmuch a curse as it is a blessing.

While some diablenists may have begun such as \na hobby, needing it to survive is much different than \n“recreational use.” \nSuch degeneration is often tied to the loss of Human- \nity and to the changes wrought by age, but not always. \nSome millennia-old Kindred still drink (and prefer) mor- \ntal blood, while some relatively young vampires cannot \ndrink from anyone but mortals. Storytellers should make \nsuch a change a story element, not one that automatically \ntakes over in a single night. Of course, if the Storyteller \nfears wholesale slaughter if an elder develops a thirst for \nthat vintage one can neither buy nor raise, she is perfectly \nwithin her rights to disallow it. \nBelow is a set of warning signs that a character may be \nsliding into cannibalism. If she meets several of these \nconditions, chances are that she will start with the occa- \nsional “nip off the top” until she can no longer drink \nanything but vampire blood. \nDiablerist \nSire addicted to Kindred blood \nThree or more Beast Traits \nSire is/was a diablerist \nActive for more than 500 years \nHas a Derangement related to blood and/or feeding \nHas sired a large number of childer (five or more) \nHas Blood Bound a number of younger vampires - \nAt odds with one’s own sire \nHas almost no mortal Allies, friends or other ties \nHas any Nature but Architect, Caregiver, Cavalier or \nespecially one’s own childer \nMartyr \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n-.- \nWhat follows are Merits and Flaws particularly suited to an elder \nchronicle and elder characters. Be sure to work with your Storyteller \nwhen you choose your Merits and Flaws, as some may interfere with the \nstory or unbalance the game. \nMerits and Flaws particularly suited for elders \nPsychological - \nCode of Honor, Compulsion, Dark Secret, Driving \nGoal, Higher Purpose, Intolerance, Nightmares, Phobia, Prey Exclusion, \nShort Fuse, Vengeance \nMental - \nCalm Heart, Deep Sleeper, Iron Will \nAptitudes - \nIlliterate, Jack of All Trades \nSupernatural - \nCan’t Cross Running Water, Cursed, Danger Sense, \nDark Fate, Destiny, Faerie Afinity , Haunted, Light Sensitive, Luck, Magic \nResistance, Magic Susceptibility, Medium, Occult Library , Repelled by \nCrosses, Repulsed by Garlic, Spirit Mentor, True Faith, Unbondabk \nKindred Ties -Clan Enmity, Clan Friendship, Diabolic Sire, Enemy, \nInfamous Sire, Insane Sire, Notm’ety , Pawn, Prestigious Sire, Reputation \nPhysical -Allergic \n(particularly to plastic, chemicals and other \n“modem” creations), Disfigured, Efficient Digestion, Misplaced Heart, \nMonstrous, Permanent Wound, Selective Digestion \nNew Merits and Flaws \nHoldings ( 1-5 Trait Merit) \nYou own a number of properties that have been in your \npossession for years. Most, if not all, have been modified to provide \nyou with escape routes, shelter from the day, and protection. \nExamples include castles, museums, apartment complexes, cathe- \ndrals or even a series of underground caverns. For each point taken, \nyou have two properties. \nEnlightened (1-7 Trait Merit) \nYou have taken the first steps on the steep and thorny path of \nGolconda. While achievement of this state is a long way off, you \nunderstand the proper approach and spend much time in pursuit of this \ngoal. A one-Trait Merit would mean that you know what the word \nmeans, and perhaps you are a beginner. Seven Traits would indicate \nthat you have spent the better part of your existence in pursuit of \nGolconda, and that you are knowledgeable enough to teach your \nbrethren the first lessons. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nOne or more Kindred owe you a boon. You granted them some form of \nassistance in the past (whether a hundred years ago, or just last week), but \nnow they owe you. This will grant you an edge in dealing with them. Should \nyou need aid, you can call the favors due, but you won’t want to let these go \nlightly. Players should work with their Storytellers regarding the number of \npoints in this Merit, and the circumstances of how these boons came to be. \nFactors in determining this should include the number and magnitude of the \ndebts owed, and the positions of the Kindred who owe them. \nLoyal Childe (3 Trait Merit) \nYour childe’s loyalty goes beyond the Blood Bond, borne of genuine \nadmiration and affection. She would do almost anything to help you. \nBecause her loyalty is so true, you can trust her like no other Kindred. \nRest assured that she would give no rest to any who harmed you, and you \nwould feel her loss as much as a stake through your own heart. \nParamour (3-5 Trait Merit) \nYou have had a long-term relationship (75-year minimum) with \nanother Kindred. While you may have had disagreements over the years, \nyou are generally loyal to each other. You both know agreat deal about each \nother, and keep few secrets from one another. You have come to each other’s \naid several times, and the thought of losing h i d e r  is something you would \nrather not consider. The cost of this Merit determines your lover’s power and \nposition in vampire society (three for an ancilla, four for an elder of equal \nstature, and five for a more powerful elder). \nPoverty (1 Trait Flaw) \nYou are poor for an elder vampire. Maybe you just never saved \nanything over the years, maybe you lost your wealth in some catastro- \nphe and have never recovered, or maybe you’ve given it away to \nwhatever causes you patronize. You may not acquire any cash or other \nmaterial wealth from your Influences. \nJilted Paramour ( 1-3 Trait Flaw) \nYou had a long-term affair (minimum of 50 years) with another \nKindred. While the relationship was a pleasant diversion while it lasted, \nyou eventually grew weary of your paramour and broke things off. \nUnfortunately, your paramour did not take this well and developed a \nstrong resentment toward you. Or perhaps you were the jiltedone, tossed \naside like an unwanted doll by a bored child. You both know many of \neachother’s secrets, and this has helped to keep things in a stalemate for \nnow, but your ex- may interfere in your future affairs at a crucial time. \nThe cost of this Flaw depends on the relative power and position of your \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nex-lover in Kindred society - \none Trait for an ancilla, two for an elder \nof equal standing to you, and three for someone of higher standing. \nVainglorious ( 1-3 Trait Flaw) \nYou are the best, most beautiful, wisest, noblest, etc. Kindred that you \nknow of, and you want to make sure that everyone knows it. You know that \nyou deserve any praise you receive, since it is obvious the speaker \nrecognizes quality when he sees it. You are especially fond of those who \nrealize their lesser standing in comparison to your obvious superiority, and \nyou tend to view those who speak well of you as more deserving and \nintelligent than most. Because of your arrogance, you must bid one to three \nTraits more in a Social Challenge to resist attempts to manipulate you \nthrough flattery. The modifier is determined by the rating in this Flaw. \nDeath Wish (1-5 Trait Flaw) \nYou have an unconscious wish for Final Death. The endless politicking \nand nightly hunts, the pain of centuries of living, your own immense \nknowledgeandmemory-all \nhavetakentheirtollonyou. While youwould \nnever deliberately harm yourself, you do tend to walk into dangerous \nsituations and hinder yourself at the most awkward times. At any time \nduring a session, the Storyteller may ask you to retest a challenge, with the \nless successful check being the actual result of your challenge. She may do \nthis the number of times equal to the number of Traits you have in this Flaw. \nPrestation Debt ( 1-5 Trait Flaw) \nYou currently owe a boon to one or more Kindred. You may have \nincurred this debt during the past, or just last week, but it’s still \noutstanding to the Kindred in question. As such, she has gained some \nStatus over you, which puts you at some disadvantage when dealing with \nher. At some point, she will call for the payment, and it could be a \nrelatively minor service or something very uncomfortable for you. \nThenumberoffraits investedinthisflawmustbedeterminedbetween \nplayer and Storyteller. The number of debts, their magnitude and to whom \nthey are owed determine the rating of this Flaw. The exact nature of how \nand to whom these debts were incurred should be worked out before play. \nBastard Childe (2 Trait Flaw) \nYou have sired one or more childer without permission from the \nlocal prince or the Justicar. By Kindred law, you and your childe could \nbe Blood Hunted if your secret is discovered. This Flaw is cumulative, \nand must be taken once per bastard sired. \nVengeful Childe (2 Trait Flaw) \nYou have sired a childe who has grown to despise you. She actively \nhinders your dealings with other Kindred and works to your detriment. \n.\n-\n7\n \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nII \n11 \nu \nu \nu \n33 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n- \na chance, and you’re probably right. \nSecret Diablerist (2 Trait Flaw) \nYou have committed diablerie at least once to achieve your \ncurrent power, but so far no one knows your secret. Should your secret \nbe learned, the other elders might well shun you, refuse you aid or turn \nagainst you, perhaps even calling the Blood Hunt. Do your utmost to \nkeep this information secret. If your secret ever becomes known, you \nreceive a three-Trait penalty on any Social Challenge with the elder \nwho knows. \nRecently Arisen (3 Trait Flaw) \nYou have been in torpor until recently. The world has left you \nbehind in the rush of progress, and everything seems to have changed \nimmensely while you slept. You experience culture shock on a nightly \nbasis, and you have great difficulty making your way around this \nstrange new society. Thankfully, Kindred society has not changed too \nmuch; mortal society is pure gibberish to you. You receive a two-Trait \npenalty when attempting to understand modern technology or soci- \nety, and on social interactions with everyone but elder Kindred. \nMatricidepatricide (4 Trait Flaw) \nYou diablerized your own sire, one of the foulest crimes a vampire \ncan commit. If ever this is discovered, you will almost certainly be left \nout for the sun. You’ve become an easy target for blackmail and must \nalways be alert to any sign of other Kindred sniffing about for informa- \ntion regarding your sire’s unusual “disappearance.” \nKnown Diablerist (5 Trait Flaw) \nYou have committed diablerie at least once to achieve your power. \nMaybe it was during a Blood Hunt; maybe you simply got tired of waiting. \nWhile not every elder Kindred knows this, there are a few of note who \ndo know, and you’re sure they are spreading the word back through the \nranks. At the very least, you would be shunned. At worst, you could be \nsubject to the Blood Hunt, in spite of your status. Certain elders will \nprobably use the information to blackmail you. You receive a three-Trait \npenalty on any Social Challenge with an elder who knows your secret. \nTrait Maximums \nAs monstrous in power as elder characters may grow, even they \nhave their limits. See Laws of the Night for the Trait maximums of \neach generation. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nI Age of Consideration \nIf you’ve been playing a vampire of elder years in your chronicle, \nmaybe your interest got squicked while you were reading this, and \nyou suddenly wanted to jump in on the elder game as well. After all, \nyour character’s old enough, and there are a lot of nifty things you’d \nlove to acquire, not to mention getting the chance to kick a little \nvampiric tail. There’s a certain Nosferatu character who’s been \ngetting too big for his britches in your opinion, and you could easily \nwipe the sewers with him - \nif you were an elder. \nBefore you start planning too much, stop and think. If you’ve \nbeen playing this character for some time, a number of people are \ngoing to be wondering why you’ve hidden your power and pre- \ntended to be so small all this time. Be assured that you’ll be taken \nfor something unpleasant (Infemalist, diablerist, Antediluvian \npawn) if you suddenly “bulk up.’’ And your powerful presence will \ncertainly tum the game on its ear, and probably not for the better. \nTalk it over with your Storyteller and listen to her con- \ncerns. If she agrees, work with her to create a plausible in-game \nreason why you’ve suddenly been elevated. Your new elder may \nget moved offstage to avoid unbalancing the game, but she \nmight still be part of the action, if only in an advisory capacity. \nIf the Storyteller decides not to bring an elder in, abide by her \ndecision, and understand that it’s for the good of the game. \nGolconda \nFew vampires are certain what Golconda means, how it can be \nachieved, or who can show them the way. Most consider it to be a \ndream, a fairy tale made up long ago by some poor benighted vampire \nwho was moaning about the loss of his “human” side. The Sabbat \nactively denounce it as a lie perpetrated by the elders of the Camarilla, \nwhile most Camarilla elders dismiss it as the ravings of some forgotten \nlunatic. Behind the whispers and sneers, though, huddles a secret cabal \n(larger than some might think) that actively works to understand the \nmystery and hopefully achieve it. The mysterious Inconnu are all \nrumored to either be seeking Golconda or have already found it. \nGolconda is said to be a mystical state of being in which the Beast \nand the Man no longer war with each other. The vampire has come to \naccept and master his Beast as a part of his soul no different than the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMan, and both are considered halves of the whole. Some claim that it \ngrants a portion of one’s humanity back, while others believe that it \nallows a vampire to live without the all-consuming need for blood. \nA number of elder vampires take up the search when they grow \nweary of the machinations of their peers and of the endless nightly \ngames. They seek out teachers wherever they may be found, perhaps \none of the Salubri, or a teacher may come to them if they prove \nsufficiently ready for the task. What comprises the task is another \nmatter. Some believe that one must give up feeding on mortals \naltogether, abandon the Jyhad, live one’s unlife as an aescetic. What \nis known is that the culmination of the years of work is known as the \nSuspire, in which a vampire literally descends into the depths of her \nown soul for her “long dark night.” Not everyone survives this final \ntest, and not everyone who survives necessarily finds what they seek. \nSome may survive, but without achieving Golconda, making these the \nmost embittered souls against the idea. \nStorytellers wishing to add the search for Golconda into their \nchronicles should be prepared for a long haul. This is not a something \nto be dashed off in a month or even a year. A vampire can search for \nliterally centuries for a few clues that lead to a teacher, and that is no \nguarantee that the teacher will accept her. A storyteller considering a \nGolconda chronicle needs to sit down and consider the framework of the \nstory - \nwhat will be necessary for the seeker to find a teacher, what will \nit take for the teacher to accept the seeker, what will the seeker need to \nconsider in her quest? How will this fit in with (or not) with your current \nplot and storylines? Will your elder’s choice to give up the Jyhad send the \ncurrent game into a tailspin? Plan out the necessary goals carefully, and \nknow when to prod encouragingly and when to back off. \nLikewise, a player needs to be made aware that for her character \nto begin seeking Golconda will be a most exacting goal to play over \ntime, and that she can’t just quit midstream because things aren’t \nprogressing as fast as she thinks they should be, or that by giving up \ndrinking from mortals she should automatically be catapulted to her \ngoal. A visit from an Inconnu or other seeker describing the rigors \nnecessary to the character may be helpful to make the elder (and \nplayer) understand exactly what she is jumping into. \nA search for Golconda need not necessarily move the character \ncompletely offstage. Golconda is denounced as a lie or fantasy by \nmany, and other characters may see it as their duty to force the \ncharacter to renounce her quest, which might create some intense \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nroleplaying dynamics between the seeker and her former compatriots. \nPerhaps the seeker, in hunting for clues to finding a teacher, unearths \na few other things, such as some interesting artifact, an embarrassing \nclan secret or an enemy she had long thought dead. \nGehenna Cults \nThe Camarilla officially decries Gehenna as a paranoid fallacy of \nthe Sabbat, seeing the tales of the bloodthirsty Antediluvians as stories \ntold to keep the unruly ones in line. Officially, Gehenna is seen as a \nmyth by the elders and their ardent supporters. Behind closed doors, \nhowever, the whispers rise, and often the most staunch upholders of \nBlood Bonds and Traditions meet to discuss their secret fears. These \nare the most secret of the secret societies, for the exposure of one \nmember places all in the gravest danger. The Inner Circle is not \nrumored to deal kindly with those Gehennists found. \nThese “Gehenna cults” are considered one of the last great thrills \nfor many elders. There is something exhilarating in the danger of \nholding a carefully coded conversation at Elysium, powerful in seeking \nto defer the destruction of the world, and (dare it be said?) quite \nnaughty in belonging to such a society. Membership in a cult, however \nexciting it might be, is a risky game, asking much of its members for a \ntask that might in the end be all for nothing. \nSome cults are social clubs with a secret Gehenna agenda known \nonly to the “inner circle,” while others array themselves in all manner \nof occultish trappings like Freemasons. Some have gone completely \nunderground, approaching only those they believe to be completely \nsympathetic to their cause and only after extensive research to assure \nthemselves of such. Most are small, a few having members that have \nmet only through correspondence. \nHow these groups intend to bring about their ultimate goal varies \naccording to the mission of the group. One searches for the “last \ndaughter of Eve,” said to be the herald ofGehenna according to The Book \nofNod. Another searches for the last pieces of The Book ofNod, hoping \nthat in a missing fragment will be the answer they seek. Other believe \nthat they must show the Antediluvians they have been doing the work \nof good vampires, and seek to stamp out anarchs and humanists. \nA few examples of Gehenna cults are given in Elysium: The Elder \nWars. However, feel free to start your own for your chronicle which suits \nyour purposes. After all, who’s to say that those poor fools know the truth? \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nElder Descriptions \nWhile different circumstances wreak different changes upon \neach vampire, there are certain constants that can be seen in elders of \nthe various clans. \nThe Camarilla \nFor the Camarilla, the endless nights bring the great game of \nintrigue and politics. The Camarilla’s upper structure is supported \nlargely by the elders - \nit is elders who form the Inner Circle, and elders \nwho serve as the feared Justicars. They enjoy pride of place as the \nmovers and shakers of Kindred society, and do not hesitate to use their \naccumulated power to remind the “youngsters” of this. However, they \nhave used such power to the detriment of the Camarilla as a whole, \nclinging to their positions long past their usefulness and killing the \nbest and brightest they fear as threats. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAs elders age, the thoughts of Golconda often become more and \nmore frequent. Those who have managed to cling to their Humanity \nbegin to consider the path in earnest, particularly when they find the \nravages of age (callousness, paranoia, cannibalism) creeping upon \nthem. Few, however, have the spiritual mettle to take more than a \nstep or two. Those who choose the path often secretly follow and \nstudy it until they feel they are far enough along that they can make \na full-time effort of it. Only the secure (in respect to faith and \nsociety) dare to step away. \nBrujah \nBrujah elders are often deep into the politics of cities and \nKindred - \nand are very good at them. They wield great influence in \nthe clan, not necessarily because the young ones respect them \n(indeed, most will watch the elders like hawks for signs of “selling \nout”), but because the young ones know that their elders hold power \nand are not afraid to use it when necessary. Time has tempered these \nelders (although they are still prone to frenzy), and most have left \nbehind the Iconoclast days of their youth, but they have not given \nup their ideals of freedom and justice. They have simply moved into \nmore “genteel” forums. \nGangrel \nLike the Lupines they emulate, Gangrel elders are prized and \nrespected as keepers of wisdom and warriors without peer - \nwhen \nthey can be found. Some become solitaries, maintaining private \nhavens in the wild which they defend from any incursion, while \nothers drift into city living and politics. Many have become ex- \ntremely bestial from frenzies over the years, often sporting such \ntouches as tufted ears, tails, extreme hairiness or animal eyes. Some \nof these elders can no longer be seen in human society unless they use \na Discipline such as Musk of IO00 Faces. \nMalkavians \nKooks who reach elder age are some of the most disturbing (and \ndisturbed) Kindred one is likely to meet. When they decide to pull \nout their bags of tricks, chances are the tricks will be intricate and \nlethal. Their Derangements intensify over time, but they are hardly \nerratic or childish. Crazy doesn’t mean inefficient, and those who \nhave chosen to play the elders’ games do so with the skill of \nconsummate chess-players. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNosferatu \nClannish and solitary, most Nosferatu elders are in a position to sit \nin the middle of the spider’s web and watch the youngsters scurry. \nMany do, collecting the lore of centuries from networks of runners, \nand they boast some of the most impressive libraries of Kindred lore. \nThose who choose to play the political games do so with as much at \ntheir commands as they can muster. \nToreador \nNo clan is as aware of the passage of time and temporality as the \nToreador. For the elders, watching the parade of fashion and art \nendlessly pass before them eventually drags many into ennui. Some \nwatch the rise of artistic movements with a practiced eye, judging \nthose they deem worthy of support or ridicule. Toreador are some of \nthe most likely to fall into degeneracy as they age, “requiring” more \nextreme pleasures to excite their senses. \nThose Artistes who have managed to pursue their art even after so \nmany years often reach a technical brilliance that is almost inconceiv- \nable to the human mind. As they age, however, they may find \nthemselves growing distant from the “human” element of their work, \nresulting in art that fulfills the demands of technique, but which \nbecomes cold and impersonal to its viewers. \nTremere \nMost of the Tremere’s elders occupy the higher echelons of the \npyramid of power, reaching their positions through a combination of \nskill, politicking and sheer tenacity. These are considered the leaders \nand tradition-bearers, teachers and masters, and in the hierarchical \narrangement of this former wizards’ cabal, age demands (and receives) \nrespect. They watch their younger clansmen with trepidation, walking \na fine line between reward and punishment. By virtue of the clan’s \nstructure, elders may easily deny potentially “dangerous” neonates and \nancillae of rank with little question from their superiors and peers. \nVentrue \nRepositories of Kindred tradition, many elder Ventrue can be \nfound in the thick of city politics as princes or primogen. The eldest \namong them almost always have such experience under their belts. \nNever known for “daring” ways, even as neonates and ancillae, elder \nVentrue can be among the most hidebound, and they will resist change \nin any form simply because it upsets their careful routines. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe Independents \nElders of the independent clans and bloodlines usually \nmaintain the greatest status among their own. At such age and \npower, some feel they may venture out among the ruck and run \nof Kindred society without too much curiosity regarding their \nbusiness. The idly curious can be sent packing, while the elders \nof the established clans may be receptive to deal-making with a \nsurprising ally. \nFew elders of the independents ever reach their age through \ncharm. Indeed, for some of these, merely reaching the age of \ndiscretion is an accomplishment in and of itself. \nAssamite \nThese are among the most feared of vampirekind, and with \ngood reason. All are experienced assassins with numerous kills to \ntheir records, some more than others. They are considered the \n“priesthood,” the teachers of the neonates and the guides of the \nancillae. Eldership is not usually based on age alone; appointment \nto the silsila can be made by the clan leaders in recognition of \noutstanding service and dedication to the clan’s ideals. \nDaughters of Cacophony \nThere are no known Daughters below the seventh generation. \nHowever, these rara avis are viewed with trepidation, if not fear, by \nmany, including elders. Their gifts of song, channeled through \nMelpominee, are little known and even less understood, and rumors \nof elder Daughters combining their voices into a destructive sym- \nphony is enough to set any Elysium buzzing. \nFollowers of Set \nElder Setites often sit in the center of empires of corruption \ncarefully built over centuries of work. Often they use younger \nSetites to build their works, even as the ancillae believe that they \nare forwarding their own ventures. Their blood is extremely \naddictive; it is unknown how many scramble and scheme to get \ntheir “fix,” but many elder Setites gloat over the number of peers \nwho have fallen to such needs. \nGiovanni \nElder Giovanni rule the clan with iron fists, often powerful and \ncompletely ruthless. These become the legendary dons of Mafia \nfamilies, unsinkable patriarchs and iron-willed matriarchs who con- \ntrol their networks of spies and thugs with devastating efficiency. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nVery little happens in the rank and file without their knowledge or \napproval. As necromancers, they have lived long enough to acquire \na frightening number of wraithly alliances and enemies. \nRavnos \nElder Ravnos often head fairly large kumpania, whether \nphysically or spiritually. Even if they have chosen to wander as \nsolitaries, the kumpania welcomes them back whenever they \nreturn. Gypsies prize their elders as repositories of wisdom and \nlore, and such is drilled into the heads of the youngsters (whether \nhuman or vampire) at an early age. Often, elder Ravnos have \nparticular tricks and cons that they have honed to consummate \nskill from years of practice. \nSalubri \nRare in the extreme, those Salubri who have reached elder age \nhave often done so with the help of allies and through their own \nwits. A Salubri who has not reached Golconda by this time is quite \nunusual. Those who have are expected to create childer and \nextinguish themselves through ritual diablerie. They may be shel- \ntered at a prince’s court as advisors or teachers of Golconda, but \nthey are always aware that at any moment they may need to flee \nfrom a Tremere with “righteousness” on his mind. \nSamedi \nSolitary and often bitter, Samedi elders find quiet havens and \nprefer to be left entirely alone. If one can be drawn out of his solitude, \nhe is often quite knowledgeable about decay and the passing of time. \nSome choose tombs which they study over the course of years, \nobserving nightly changes of decay in the inhabitants. \nThe Sabbat \nIn the violence of Sabbat society, elder status is a plum prize \nindeed, particularly since it means one survived long enough to \nachieve it. Sabbat elders are looked to as examples of the best, and \nthey need to prove it every single night; there are always youngsters \nwith delusions of grandeur who need to be reminded of their place. \nResting on one’s laurels is not advised, and often an elder doesn’t \nhave the time. More often than not, Sabbat elders are serving in \nhigh-ranking positions such as paladins and bishops, and are called \non to teach the next generation of fighters. Among the packs, an \nelder who has managed to hold her own for so long will likely be a \nbattle-scarred pack leader or an experienced priest. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\neven those who receive favorable attention are never wholly \ncomfortable in the presence of the elder until much time and \nexperience has shown them otherwise. It was, after all, the elders \nand their loathsome deeds that started the Anarch Revolt. \nLasombra \nAdmission to the prestigious ranks of Les Amies Noir is consid- \nered the hallmark of “eldership” for the Lasombra. Great privilege \nand great responsibility mark one’s time as an elder. Failure is not \ntolerated, so one may be certain that a Lasombra elder is among the \nbest of her kind. A great number serve in the upper ranks of the \nSabbat as bishops and other leaders; indeed, it is a Lasombra elder \nwho rules Mexico City. Often chief in their mind is the embarrass- \ning presence of the antitribu, and they will pursue any rumors of \nsuch to exhaustion. \nTzimisce \nMany Tzimisce of advanced age no longer look remotely human, \nhaving practiced Vicissitude on themselves to reflect their increas- \ningly alien state of mind. Scorning humans as juicebags and \nannoyances, they see no reason to look like them either. They often \nlord over what land they still own as their own, dreaming of days in \nthe Carpathians and mixing old-fashioned ideals of manners, king. \nship and custom with utterly inhuman desires and whims. The \ncruelty of elder Tzimisce is legendary among the youth, who quickly \nlearn to keep a civil tongue in their heads before it is removed for \nthem. Many are highly superstitious beyond their clan weakness of \nsleeping in native soil. \nCaitiff \nThe average Caitiff is considered at a ripe old age if she \nsurvives to become an ancilla. Most rarely achieve elder status, \nprimarily because they are driven from cities and hunted to the \nground. Those who have reached the age of consideration are \noften loners, preferring their own company to that of their unkind \nbrethren. A few manage to gather broods around them, usually of \ntheir own childer and grandchilder. On occasion, they go insane \nfrom the lack of Kindred company, and either end their exist- \nences or turn to preying on the society that cast them out in the \nfirst place. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n“- \nNew Clans \nThe following clans are included here, since the majority of \ntheir ranks tend to be those of elder age. It is unlikely that many \nbelow ancilla rank have heard much of substance about them \nbeyond stories of their sires. \nGargoyles \nCreated in the Dark Ages to serve the Tremere as terrifying \nwarriors and servants, the first Gargoyles were molded from the raw \nmatter of captured vampires steeped in foul alchemical ichors. Using \nstrange rituals, the Tremere conjured puissant guardians who provide \nstrong defense and unyielding loyalty to the various chantries. Upon \nthe change, Gargoyles lose all memory of their previous lives, and \nsuffer agonizing physical and spiritual changes. Magically bound to \nservice, Gargoyles exist only to fight the enemies of their masters. \nSome Gargoyles break free of their conditioning, seeking to \nrevolt against their Tremere masters. Still, the ties of their genera- \ntive magic are strong, and few can hope to escape slavery. In \nmodern years, the Tremere carefully separate Gargoyles, assigning \nonly one or two to any given Location, so as to quash any revolt, The \nindividual Gargoyle remains a sad and lonely figure, enthralled in \nservitude, lacking any but the faintest memories of a former life, \nand driven to great rage and frustration. \nClan Disciplines: Fortitude, Potence, Viscerutika \nAdvantage: Gargoyles are all created through a magical ritual, \nwhich imbues them with unnatural resilience. All Gargoyles gain \none additional Health Level - \ntreat this as an extra “Healthy” level \non the wound levels chart. \nDisadvantage: Gargoyles suffer from a rocklike, inhuman ap- \npearance, sometimes studded with strange pebbly growths. They \nquite literally resemble something that crawled down from the \ntower of a Gothic cathedral, complete with wings, horns, talons \nand tails that continue to grow as they age. Thus, a Gargoyle \nautomatically fails any Social Challenge not related to intimida- \ntion when its normal form is visible. Gargoyle players should wear \nenough makeup to make their inhuman appearance obvious, or \nshould at least adopt baggy clothing and accesories that could \nreasonably conceal the Gargoyle form. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nFurthermore, as a magically created servitor race, gargoyles are \nautomatically two Traits down on any attempt to resist Dominate or \nother forms of supernatural mind control. \nDark Ages Gargoyles \nClan Disciplines: Flight, Fortitude, Potence \nAdvantage: Gargoyles of the Dark Ages gain an additional Health \nLevel, just like their modern counterparts. \nDisadvantage: Gargoyles in the Dark Ages suffer from the same \nhindrances as their successors. \nNote: The Discipline of Viscerutika actually consists of several \npowers that were bestowed upon Gargoyles through the use of \nThaumaturgical rituals; by the modern age, the typical Gargoyle has \ninternalized those powers. In the Dark Ages, the Discipline ofViscerutika \nis not available to Gargoyles, but the individual powers of the Disci- \npline may be studied as Thaumaturgy rituals of the same difficulty (i.e. \na Basic Viscerutika power can be learned as a Basic ritual). These rituals, \nwhich only function on a Gargoyle, typically require the expenditure \nof a Mental Trait by the caster and last for the duration of the session. \nDark Ages Gargoyles gain the ability to fly instead of studying \nVisceratika; they spend experience points as if buying the Viscerutika \nDiscipline, but each level purchased allows the Gargoyle to fly at a \nspeed of 5 mph. Thus, a Gargoyle with four levels of Flight can fly at a \nspeed of 20 mph. Flight should be represented with a special card or \nhand signal, prearranged with a Narrator or Storyteller. \nLasombrahtifzfbu \nThese renegade Kindred have nearly been hunted to extinction by \ntheir Sabbat brethren. Many are relics of the Middle Ages who refused \nto join with the Sabbat after the fall of their Antediluvian founder. \nWhile similar in many aspects to their Sabbat counterparts, Lasombra \nuntitribu are cunning and ruthless survivors who will stop at nothing to \nensure their continued existence. Be it piracy on the high seas or \ncontrolling the stock market, they are masters of adapting to a \nsituation to serve their needs. A few are members of the Camarilla, but \nmost are independents who serve their own interests. \nDisciplines: Dominate, Obtenebration, Potence \nAdvantage: Lasombra antitribu are master manipulators and busi- \nnessmen. Because of this, they automatically gain one additional \nBureaucracy or Finance Influence Trait. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDisadvantage: In addition to the standard Lasombra disadvan- \ntage regarding mirrors, Lasombra untitribu are distrusted within the \nCamarilla, and have the permanent Negative Trait of Untrustwor- \nthy as a result. In addition, the Lasombra antitribu, be they Camarilla \nor independent, are constantly hunted without remorse by Lasombra \nof the Sabbat. \nOld Clan Tzimisce \nAncient beyond most Kindred standards, those Tzimisce that \nnever embraced the Vicissitude Discipline are known as the “Old \nClan.” While similar to their modern Sabbat counterparts in their \ninhuman natures and macabre tastes, they carry a seething hatred for \ntheir Vicissitude-using childer, whom they consider to be traitors of \ntheir blood. Most of these rare vampires still maintain large estates \nand castles that they have lorded over for centuries. Nearly all are \nunliving antiquities, often dressing and speaking in fashions out- \ndated for centuries. The Old Clan Tzimisce are for the most part \nsolitary, vicious independents who do not acknowledge the sover- \neignty of either the Camarilla or the Sabbat. They rarely receive \nvisitors to their domains, but those who have gained admittance \nspeak in awe of the storehouses of knowledge to be found. \nDisciplines: Animalism, Auspex, Dominate \nAdvantage: Old Clan Tzimisce show innate magical aptitude, such \nthat if taught Thaumaturgy they are not required to pay the one extra \nexperience point normally required for all out-of-clan Disciplines. \nDisadvantage: Something deep inside the Old Clan craves \nstability and permanence. The Fiends share a special connection to \nthe land they claimed as their own in life. When they slumber, these \nancient Kindred must surround themselves with at least two hand- \nfuls of earth from a land important to them in life. Failure to do so \nresults in a fitful day’s rest, and no Willpower or Attributes Traits are \nregained from the sleep. \nBeast/Path Traits \nA character not on one of the Paths of Enlightenment is automati- \ncally considered to be on the Path of Humanity. Unlike Beast Traits, \nPath Traits have an undisputed hierarchy of sins that if broken \ndemand an automatic Path Trait check. See Laws of the Night (pp. \n40-44) for rules on Paths. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nHierarchy of Sins \nThe Hierarchies of Sins were not included in LotN, nor was the \nPath of Humanity.

They can be taught to other clans \nonly through in-play interaction, and may never be taken by a \ncharacter outside of the specific clan at character creation. Like \nclan-specific Disciplines, the Paths are usually kept as tight secrets \namong the clan members; teaching them to outsiders may be consid- \nered a betrayal. \nAssarnite \nPath of Blood \nOutsiders often interpret the Assamite belief in the Path of Blood \nas a simple desire for increased power through diablerie. The truth is \nmuch more complex, embedded in the teachings of Haqim (the \nAssamite founder) which form the central motivation for the clan. \nThe Path of Blood teaches that it will lead to the downfall of the \nCamarilla, turning their own strength against them. This will lead to \nthe fulfillment of the Assamites’ revenge for their sufferings, as well as \ncarrying out Haqim’s sacred task of ridding the world of the Kindred. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe second (and more mystical teaching) is that the Path of \nBlood ascends the peak of Alamut, and the Assamite who climbs the \nPath of Blood to the summit shall become One. This esoteric \nconcept involves achieving a kind of enlightenment directly compa- \nrable to the Camarilla idea of Golconda. Only by reaching the \nsummit may an Assamite become One. \nIn many ways, this teaching is very similar to the Sabbat’s Path \nof Caine, which the Assamites are often credited with developing. \nThe Camarilla are allowed to carry on believing that the Assamites \nfollow the Path of Caine, since this is in the interests of the Great \nDisguise and prevents outsiders from learning their true goal: the \ndestruction of all Caine’s progeny. \nPath of Blood Hierarchy of Sins: \nFailing to pursue an opportunity to obtain Kindred blood of a \nSuccumbing to frenzy. \nFailing to pursue Kindred blood or knowledge of Caine or the \nCurse when there is moderate danger. \nBeing disrespectful to clan leaders. \nFailing to execute an assassination contract yet surviving. \nFailing to pursue blood or knowledge in the face of minor danger. \nNot killing a non-Assamite vampire when there is need to do so. \nPlacing personal desires or ambition above other matters. \nFailing to assist or avenge a clanmate. \nRevealing clan information to outsiders. \nPath Traits \nAssamites on the Path of Blood may also choose from the Path \nTraits Abelite, Self-Controlled or Scholar as described in Laws of the \nNight. (pp. 41) under the Path of Caine. \nAvenger - \nYou believe in clan loyalty above all else. If \nanyone attempts to stop you or a clanmate from assisting or \navenging a fellow Assamite, you succumb to a bloody killing haze \nto accomplish your goal. \nDisrespect - \nFrenzy whenever you see a fellow Assamite treat \na higher-ranking Assamite with disrespect of any sort. Assamites must \ntreat all, even enemies, with the respect due to them. The idea of a \nclanmate lowering himself to the level of other inferior vampires \ndisgusts you. \nhigher generation than your own, though it may cost your unlife. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nFailure-Your \nclan has a reputation as the perfect killers. If you, \nor a fellow Assamite that you are aware of, fail in an assassination \nattempt, your self-esteem drops you into a frenzy-ridden depression of \nlow morale. \nTraitor - \nIf you are forced to reveal clan secrets to others, you \nsuccumb to frenzy. Treason is the worst crime an Assamite can \ncommit. Frenzy if you become aware of an Assamite betrayingthe clan. \nFrenzy if you see a non-clanmate using powers or information that they \ncould have only learned through an Assamite teaching (and betrayal). \nRavnos \nPath of Paradox \nThe Path of Paradox teaches that all existence is fluid and malleable. \nNothing is permanent or real. The universe is an ever-shifting vortex and \nall in it is composed of variable amounts of ethereal matter, called “weig.” \nRavnos on this Path gradually learn their ruison d’atre: to destroy the \nblasphemous creation of the Antediluvians, that thing known as reality. \nThey learn to harness their internal weig for the production of reality- \naltering effects. These effects are mere illusions at low levels of power, \nbut as the Ravnos becomes more powerful, the “tricks” gradually \nincrease in potency. \nRavnos also actively attempt to alter others’ perceptions of reality. \nTheir favorite methods for so doing are through trickery and theft. \nSuch are surprisingly effective weapons. \nUltimately, however, the weig must be released into the vortex. \nRavnos who are advanced students of this Path actively seek out items \nthat retain weig - \n“magic” items, Lupine fetishes and the like - \nand \ndestroy them. The most powerful followers of this Path hunt vampires \nwith great amounts of weig- low generation, and the lower the better. \nPath of Paradox Hierarchy of Sins \nRefusing to commit diablerie upon an elder of another clan. \nRefusing to lead a “locked” being into the light - \nor into destruction. \nShowing any concern for mortals. \nFailing to acquire items or knowledge that would affect Gehenna. \nFailing to trick others when the opportunity arises. \nBeing caught altering another’s reality via the select redistribution \nRefusing to release the weig of an empowered device. \nof possessions (known among the vulgar as stealing). \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nJoining another sect (Camarilla or Sabbat) and actively maintain- \nActively hindering change. \nActively inducing boredom. \nPath Traits \ning the existing structure thereof. \nRelease -Frenzy whenever you are prevented from committing \ndiablerie on an elder of another clan, or releasing the weig from any \ncontained item. If someone else is getting in your way, remove him. \nConcern - \nMortals are an unimaginative and boring lot that \nrefuse to see the big picture. Vampires who dote on them infuriate \nyou! Frenzy if you must watch Kindred pamper or care for these \nunenlightened dolts. \nKnowledge - \nFrenzy whenever someone directly prevents you \nfrom acquiring knowledge of Gehenna. If a Nosferatu dangles pages \nof The Book of Nod in front of your face and refuses to let you see it, \nyou frenzy. \nFailure - \nFrenzy if you are caught trying to pull a heist of any \nsort, whether a simple riddle, trick, theft, etc. “Real” Ravnos can get \naway with anything if they want to. You screwed up - \nyou hate that! \nBoredom - \nYou hate being bored. Boredom means stagna- \ntion, means that weig is getting trapped. You’ll frenzy just to shake \nthings up. If you find yourself getting bored during the evening’s \nsession, you frenzy (this is only if your character is bored; player \nboredom is another matter entirely). \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSetites \nPath of Typhon \nCertainly no Setites are more sinister than those who follow \nthe shadowy Path of Typhon. Its tenets are anathema to all that \nmost mortals, and many Kindred, hold dear. For the Typhonites, \ncorruption, pain, lies and sin are things to be cherished and spread \nthroughout existence. Misery is not a means to an end, but an end \nin and of itself. \nOf all the Paths, the Path of Typhon is more like a religion than \na philosophy. Its practitioners are rumored to worship various entities \n- \nperhaps personifications of various sins, perhaps something else - \nthrough blood libations and sacrifice. Through such worship, the \nTyphonites believe, mystic understanding may be gleaned. \nIn order to achieve enlightenment, the followers of this Path \ncontinually seek to spread war, plague, poverty, stagnation and fear \nthrough the world. Through the creation and study of such phe- \nnomena, the Typhonites hope to discover the truths about, and \nbehind, earthly existence. As far as the followers of Typhon are \nconcerned, everyone else is missing the point. \nPath of Typhon Hierarchy of Sins \nAttempting to maintain any sense of self-control, purity or worth. \nRefusing to succumb to one’s own weaknesses (this includes \nFailing to destroy a vampire in Golconda. \nDestroying a foe expediently and mercifully rather than “poetically.” \nFailing to undermine the current social order in favor of the Setites. \nFailing to replace faith with cynicism and despair. \nFailing to exploit another’s weaknesses. \nAllowing one’s feelings for a mortal to override the need to corrupt \nRefusing to corrupt a vampire for the Setites. \nNot attempting to awaken Set at the earliest opportunity. \nPath Traits \nControl - \nYou should have what you want. Should anyone \ndecide to try to control your actions, you frenzy and make sure that she \nnever tries it again. \nattempting to avoid frenzy). \nsaid mortal. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWeakness -The \nidea of someone fighting off his personal \nweakness infuriates you. Frenzy whenever you fail to get someone \nto give in to his weakness. \nPurity - \nThe idea of those dolts that attempt to promote \ngoodness and that vile concept of Golconda disgusts you like \nlittle else. When you are confronted with anyone holy or pure, \nyou feel the overwhelming urge to destroy her. If prevented, you \nfrenzy. If ever confronted by the Children of Osiris, a Salubri or \nanyone using the Disciplines of Bardo or Obeah, you frenzy on \nthe spot. \nMortal Feelings - \nIf your feelings for a mortal conflict with \nyour desire to corrupt her, the conflict within you drives you mad. \nThe Beast takes control and you frenzy. \nKnowledge of Set - \nFrenzy whenever someone directly \nprevents you from acquiring knowledge of Set, such as a museum \nguard refusing to let you get closer to a scrap of papyrus on display. \nPath of Ecstasy \nPractitioners of this Path revel in luxury instead of degrada- \ntion. They sate the Beast by glutting its appetite. Although akin \nto the Path of Typhon in some ways, Ecstatics reject the base \ncruelties of the Typhonites. Rather than celebrate misery, they \nglorify pleasure, reveling in the most decadent extremes of \nvampiric sensation. Members of this path often despise the \nKindred of Clan Toreador, and take every opportunity to hu- \nmiliate them. \nPath of Ecstasy Hierarchy of Sins \nAllowing someone innocent to survive. \nNot wallowing in absolute luxury. \nAllowing someone ugly to survive. \nAllowing an infector of impurity (i.e., priest, nun, etc.) to live \nRejecting wealth unnecessarily. \nNot attempting to corrupt an innocent. \nNot taking at least one drug regularly. \nRestraining your natural impulses unnecessarily. \nFailing to accept a gift. \nDestroying something of beauty. \nwithout good reason. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPath Traits \nInnocence - \nYou always kill mortals that you feed upon. That’s \nwhat they are here for, after all. If a victim happens to escape death at \nyour hands during your feeding, you frenzy. You played with your food \ntoo much, and now it got away! \nLuxury - \nYou love your luxurious lifestyle. The thought of \nlosing it makes you want to destroy anyone who would take it from you. \nFrenzy if you happen to lose anything that is yours. \nCorruption - \nThe drive to corrupt the innocent is like a drug \nto you. If you fail to corrupt a chosen target, your anger is without \nequal. If he cannot be corrupted, he must be destroyed. You will \nremove anyone that gets between you and your target. \nAddiction - \nYou have become addicted to a foreign substance \nor drug. If you can’t get your “fix” at least once per session, you frenzy. \nBeauty - Beauty is meant to be cherished. The sight of \nsomething beautiful being destroyed causes the Beast to rise within \nyou, with a vengeance! You instantly frenzy and go looking for the \ndespoiler. Barring him, you’ll take anyone who gets in your way. \nPath of the Warrior \nThis Path has grown in popularity in recent decades, with many \nyoung Setites attracted to its philosophies. Just as Set was once a \nhunter and warrior, so too are adherents of this Path. These Setites \npride themselves upon their physical and martial prowess. Many who \nfollow the Path of the Warrior are masochists and fanatics. They \nbelieve that the Beast is a creation of the mind, and that by training \nthe body until it is stronger than the mind, the Beast can be controlled. \nPath of the Warrior Hierarchy of Sins \nNot subjecting yourself to the most painful tortures. \nFailing any test set you, physical or mental. \nNot developing your body to its fullest potential. \nSpending Blood Points to heal your wounds the same night they \nNot developing your Disciplines to their fullest potential. \nKilling swiftly and mercifully. \nShowing any sign of pain. \nNot exercising every night. \nThinking too long before acting. \nRefusing a Physical Challenge. \nare inflicted. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPath Traits \nFailure - \nThe mind and body Set provided you are the most \npowerful things you have. Frenzy if you fail in a conflict regarding the \npower of your mind or proving your superior physical prowess. \nMental or Physical Development - \nIf you are unable to spend \nat least half an hour per night in meditation or developing your near- \nperfect immortal body, you are forced into a panic-driven frenzy. \nDiscipline Development - \nIf you are not able to successfully use \nat least one each of your different Disciplines on a foe per night, you \nfrenzy out of shame at your own weakness. \nPain - \nPain is for the weak. Only inferior beings show pain. If \nyou are caught showing any pain, you have failed Set. Knowing that \nyou have failed Set causes you to frenzy. \nRefusal - \nRefusing a Physical Challenge dishonors Set. If you \nor any other Setite that you see backs down from a Physical Challenge, \nyou frenzy due to the dishonor to your lord. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDisciplines \nEven the youngest vampire is aware of the powers bestowed on her \nby virtue of her blood, and over time and through testing, she can \ncreate some remarkable and lethal effects. With such immense time to \nhone one's abilities, the powers of the elder vampires are terrifying and \namazing to behold. \nCharacters of the ninth generation and higher may learn \nAdvanced Disciplines, but they may not progress beyond them, \nforcing these Kindred to seek other ways to enhance their personal \npower. The same is not true for those of older vitae. Characters of \nthe eighth generation and lower have access to the potent Master- \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nlevel Disciplines. As with any Discipline the lower levels must be \nlearned before moving on to the more advanced powers; before \nlearning Soul Scan, for instance, a character must possess Clairvoyance, \nPsychic Projection and all the lower-level Auspex powers. \nMaster-level powers cost 12 experience points per clan Discipline \nand 13 points per out-of-clan. Characters that possess these frighten- \ning powers are uncommon at best. Storytellers should feel free to \ndisallow powers that are too easily abused or that unbalance the game. \nIn addition to the Master-level powers, the following Disciplines - \nMelpominee, Mytherceria, Necromancy, Obeah, Quietus, Spiritus and \nThanatosis - \nhave been given an additional Basic power for game \nbalance. These powers are to be learned in order with those Basic \npowers listed in Laws of the Night (e.g., the Quietus power Weakness \nwould be learned after Silence of Death and before Poison Blade). The \nThaumaturgy Paths and Rituals listed in this supplement are available \nto characters of any generation. \nAnimalism \nMaster \nAnimal Succulence \nWhile many Kindred find the blood of animals revolting and \ndetest consuming their vitae, you are able to reap unique benefits from \nthis type of feeding. Animal Succulence makes animal vitae particularly \nnourishing, and doubles the number of Blood Traits a vampire with \nthis Discipline may obtain from any animal. This power is not in effect \nwhen a vampire feeds on humans. \nConquer the Beast \nYou now have achieved a certain mastery of the Beast within \nyourself. As such, you may enter and exit any frenzy at will. You may \nchoose and control the type of frenzy you enter (see Laws of the Night, \npp. 117-1 18) and your actions throughout. To enter frenzy, you must \nlose one Social Trait and one Willpower Trait. The frenzy ends \nwhenever you so choose, or after 10 minutes have elapsed. A character \nin frenzy gains the following: \nRage Frenzy: Ferocious x 2 and Tenacious \nControl Frenzy: Ferocious x 2 and Tough \nTerror Frenzy: Ferocious x 2 and Brutal, plus immunity to Presence, \nDominate and any other non-Animalism Social Challenge. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAuspex \nMaster \nClairvoyance \nYou can see and hear events without the need for Psychic Projection. \nTo use this Discipline, you must win a Static Mental Challenge against \na variable difficulty (see chart). The difficulty of the challenge is based \non your familiarity with the place you seek to view (e.g., Clairvoyantly \nviewing your own haven would be a Static Challenge against a difficulty \nof four Traits, while viewing your sire’s castle in Transylvania that you \nhave only seen in a painting is a nearly impossible task). You may also \nuse all other Auspex Disciplines while using Clairoloyunce. \nPlace as familiar as one’s haven \nVisited there three or four times \nVisited once \n12 \nDescribed in detail \n18 \nNever been there but have seen a photograph \n25 \nSoul Scan \n4 \n8 \nYou can discover the “location” of anyone you know, wherever the \ntarget maybe.ThispowerrequirestheassistanceofaNarrator. \nYoumust win \na Static Mental Challenge against the target’s Mental Traits to enact this \nDiscipline. The Narrator simply notes the time of the Soul Scan and then \nfinds the target, asking her where she was at that time and informing you. \nOther Disciplines (as appropriate) can be used after locating the target. This \npower locates the mind of the individual sought. If the individual sought is \ncurrently using powers such as Psychic Projection or Possession, the result of \nSoul Scan will be to find where her conscious mind currently is. \nMaster \nBring Forth the Dawn \nWith this power you may force another Kindred to succumb to the \nDaysleep by winning a Social Challenge against him. The victim will \nsleep one hour for every Beast Trait he has. This power can also affect \nmultiple targets (Mob Rule applies). The target can only be aroused by \ncircumstances which would directly bring about his destruction \n(Storyteller’s discretion). The target may, if he chooses, spend Will- \npower to remain awake, at a rate of one Trait per hour. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCelerity \nMaster \nQuickness \nYou disappear, in an incredible burst of speed. Your synchronicity \nbetween mind and body has reached such a level of perfection that \nmost Kindred deem the speed in which you move unfathomable. You \nmay make four extra challenges when employing Quickness. Other- \nwise this power is identical to Swiftness, including cost. If used to cut \ntravel time, the time is reduced to 1/16. \nVelocity \nVampires with this power are often mistaken for having the \npowers of teleportation. You move faster than most conscious minds \ncan think. You may make five extra challenges when employing \nVelocity. Otherwise this power is identical to Swiftness, including \ncost. If used to cut travel time, the time is reduced to 1/32. \nChimerstry \nBasic (Level 2) \nFata Morgana \nYou can create an illusion that is visible to one person. \nHowever, the illusion you create may affect as many senses as you \nwish, including sight, sound, touch and even smell and taste. \nWhile the created illusion is not real and cannot cause physical \nharm, it can be used to trick or deceive others after a successful \nSocial Challenge. The illusion lasts for as long as you want it to, \nuntil you leave the vicinity, or until your opponent succeeds in a \nSocial Challenge. \nMaster \nPseudo Blindness \nYour ability to perceive reality has reached a heightened state \nwell beyond that of other Kindred. Where once you were as easily \nduped as any other, you now no longer fall prey to simple mind \ntricks. You are no longer affected by Obfuscate or Chimerstry powers \nbelow Advanced, unless your adversary is of a lower generation \nthan yourself. Once acquired, this power is in effect at all times. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMass Reality \nThe illusions you now create have become so potent that you \ncan cause whole groups of people to experience Horrid Reality. All \nof your opponents see the same illusion and believe it to be real. \nYou must win a Mental Challenge against each target in turn for \nthis power to be successful. \nDementation \nMaster \nKindred Spirits \nYou can manipulate another’s mind and force the victim to become \nidentical to you in many respects. The target’s Nature and Demeanor \ntemporarily change to match your own. In addition, the victim acquires \nany Derangements and all Beastpath Traits you possess. This power \ndoes not give you any direct control over the victim, but while under its \neffects, she is forced to act in ways that she normally wouldnot. You must \nmake physical contact (which may result in a Physical Challenge) and \nsucceed in a Mental Challenge for this power to take effect. The \nduration of this power is one hour. At Narrator discretion, an extended \ntest can grant an additional hour of effect for each success earned. \nMind of a Killer \nThis power allows you to alter the mind of your target, making her \na cold-blooded killer. The first person to offend the target in any way \n(including a loved one or an opponent of considerably more power) \nbecomes her chosen victim. The target will then do everything in her \npower to kill her chosen victim, using whatever means it takes. So \nstrong is the target’s hatred that when in the presence of her victim, \nshe must win a Static Mental Challenge every 10 minutes or she will \nfrenzy and attack the target. Once the target has completed her task, \nthe effect ends and the target is left to agonize over her deed, \ncompletely unaware of what provoked her. A Beast Trait/Path check \nmay be in order. This power works on both supernatural creatures and \nmortals, and requires you to kiss the victim (a Physical Challenge may \nbe in order-remember, \nno touching) and defeat her in a Mental Test. \nWillpower may not be used to negate the effects of this power. This \npower lasts one night per Mental Trait invested into the initial \nchallenge or until the death of the target’s victim. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nDominate \nMaster \nObedience \nYou may now use all other Dominate Disciplines without eye \ncontact. To activate this power, all you need to do is be able to see and \ntalk to the target. (And yes, you must actually speak to the target, and \nhave the target understand. “Within earshot” doesn’t cut it.) \nRationale \nThose whom you Dominate are convinced their actions are entirely \nof their own design, and were right and proper under the circumstances. \nThis power requires a successful Mental Challenge against the target to \nwork. If you are successful, the target believes that whatever he did under \nthe influence of your successful Dominate Challenge was done of his own \nvolition. The effects last for one evening. \nFortitude \nMaster \nImperviousness \nYour ability to shrug off m a t  forms of damage has reached unbelievable \nheights. You may perform a Simple Test to negate nonaggravated wounds; \nyou conduct one test per wound incurred. If you win, you take no damage. \nInvulnerability \nYou have become a walking juggernaut. Only the most tenacious \nand cunning of opponents stand a chance of bringing you down. You \nmay perform a Simple Test to negate aggravated wounds; you conduct \none test per wound level incurred. If you win, you take no damage; on \na tie the wound becomes nonaggravated. \nYou cannot continue testing down with Imperviousness after a \nsuccessful test on Invulnerablility . \nMelpominee \nBasic \nThe Missing Voice \nYou may “throw” your voice, causing to it emanate from any place \nwithin view. This operates independently of you, and you may continue \nto talk normally while the “thrown” voice chimes in. This power works \n1 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nautomatically, but if you wish to undertake any other actions at the same \ntime, you must perform a Mental Challenge; success indicates you can \ndivide your concentration. The best way to handle this is to give a \nNarrator a note with what you wish to say. \nMaster \nArt’s Traumatic Essence \nYou may now drive others mad with the soundof your voice. To affect \nthe target, you must wina Social Challenge against her. Once affected, the \ntarget gains a random Derangement (as determined by the Storyteller) for \nthe remainder of the evening. Both characters are aware of what the \nDerangement is and may act accordingly. This Discipline can only affect \none target at a time, unless the Daughter of Cacophany spends a \nWillpower Trait. Each Trait spent thus allows for an additional victim. \nMytherceria \nBasic (level 2) \nDarkling Trickery \nThis power allows the Kiasyd to play minor magical pranks. By \ndefeating a target in a Mental Challenge, you can create spontaneous \neffects. While none of them should be overtly harmful, they most \ncertainly should be annoying to the victim. Examples of possible effects: \ntarget lets out adeafening scream, target slips and falls, target’s gun jams, \ntarget’s pants fall down, target sneezes steadily for one minute straight. \nThe effect of this power should be regulated closely by a Narrator. \nMaster \nRiddle Phantastique \nBy defeating the target in a Mental Challenge, this Discipline \nallows you to recite a riddle of your choosing. The target can then do \nnothing but try to solve it, although she may defend herself as normal \nif attacked. The Riddle is so impenetrable that it can actually damage \nthe minds that think about it. The target must try to guess the answer \nto the riddle once every 10 minutes, whether she knows the answer or \nnot. For every incorrect guess made by the target, she takes one \nnonaggravated wound. Every third incorrect guess results in the target \nreceiving an aggravated wound. Malkavians or Kindred with two or \nmore Derangements are immune to this side effect. The duration of \nthis power is one night, or until completion of the riddle. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThis power allows you to cause huge spikes to shoot out of walls, \nceilings and floors. The spikes will be made of the same material as the \nsurface from which they form, and can be especially dangerous to \nvampires in a wooden house or room. An attack of this nature is \nconsidered a ranged attack, and requires a challenge of your Mental \nTraits versus the target’s Physical Traits. If the attack is successful, the \ntarget suffers two levels of nonaggravated damage. Wooden spikes that \ndamage Kindred are accompanied by a Simple Test to see if the target \nhas been staked. Due to the huge size of the spikes, only one Simple \nTest need be made. (Note: This is not a physical test of brute strength \non the target’s part, so Potence cannot be used in the challenge.) \nNecromancy \nBasic \nInsight \nThis Discipline allows you to look into the eyes of a corpse and \nview the last five minutes those eyes saw in life, often images of the \ntarget’s killer and the manner of death. Insight also works on the \nwalking dead, and may allow you to perceive the identity of a vampire’s \nsire. A Mental Challenge must be won if the target resists. \nMaster \nTorment \nBy expending a Willpower Trait and winning a Simple Test, you \nmay initiate Physical Challenges to strike and physically harm wraiths \nfor 10 minutes as if you were beyond the Shroud. The wraith cannot \nescape by becoming incorporeal, nor can the ghost strike you, because \nyou are not in the Shadowlands. A wraith reduced to zero Corpus goes \nthrough a Harrowing as described in Oblivion. \nSpirit Possession \nYou now possess the power to place wraiths within the bodies of the \ndead. After summoning a wraith, you may expend a Willpower Trait to \nplace it, if willing, into adead body. The wraith may then inhabit the body \nfor up to one week. (Note: A wraith placed in a body this way does not \nbecome a Risen - \nsee Oblivion.) You may attempt to place a wraith in \na Kindred body; however, you must spend two Willpower Traits and win \na Mental Challenge against the owner of the body. The spirit of the ousted \nvampire may initiate one Mental Challenge per day against the wraith to \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nregaincontrol ofhis body. A vampire exiled from his bod \nwraith and his former body is now his one and only Fetter as described in \nOblivion. A wraith possessing a Kindred body has full access to any \nCelerity, Fortitude or Potence Disciplines the vampire may have had. \nObeah \nBasic (Level 2) \nAnesthetic Touch \nBy using this power, you may lay your hands on someone and stop \nher body from feeling any pain, or bring a vampire out of frenzy. This \npower also paralyzes the target for one turn per Mental Trait expended. \nYou must defeat an unwilling target in a Physical Challenge. Improper \nuse of this Discipline (e.g., using this power simply to paralyze a target) \nmay demand a Beast Trait check. \nMaster \nPain for Pleasure \nBy spending a Willpower Trait, you can dull the senses of your \ntarget such that he feels intense pleasure instead of pain and suffers no \nTrait penalties for wounds. Unfortunately, this also results in the \ntarget not realizing he is injured. The experience is very sensual, and \nsome targets have been known to injure themselves deliberately to \nachieve the sensation again. \nVitae Block \nThis power allows you to render a portion of another vampire’s \nblood inert and unusable. By succeeding in a Mental Challenge, you \nspend a Mental Trait for every Blood Trait you wish to block. The \ntarget may only use those “blocked” Blood Traits after he spends an \nequal number of Willpower Traits. Although spending Willpower \nmay be done one Trait at a time until the task is completed, none of \nthe blocked vitae will be usable until it is all freed. \nObfuscate \nMaster \nCloak the Aura \nWith this power, you can completely cloak your aura from the \nprying eyes of others. By expending a Willpower Trait, you can \ncompletely conceal your aura or change it at will. Others attempting \nt \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nto use Aura Perception, Telepathy or Soul Scan on you must defeat you \nin an opposed Mental Challenge to break the Cloak. If the Cloak is \nbroken, your opponent must defeat you in an additional Mental \nChallenge for any of the previous powers to have an effect. \nCloak the Aura’s effects override those of any lesser Obfmcate power. \nConceal \nSimilar to the Intermediate power Cloak the Gathering, you may \nnow enshroud nonliving objects, up to but no larger than the size of \na house. You must decide the number of Mental Traits you wish to \ninvest in the concealment. The invested Traits determine the rating \nof the Static Challenge for any opponents who wish to pierce the \nconcealment. Once active, the effects of this power are permanent \nuntil broken. \nObtenebration \nMaster \nEyes of the Night \nWith the expenditure of a Mental Trait, you are able to see \nanything that goes on within the dark force created by any other \nuse of this Discipline. Thus you could evoke Eyes of the Night in \nanother room and clairvoyantly scan the area within. Moreover, \nyou may use this power to view your surroundings from any angle \nor vantage point within 50 feet of your body where a shadow exists. \nYou only perceive visual information through use of this power. \nUsing this power requires the expenditure of a Mental Trait per five \nminutes of use. \nShadow Step \nWith the expenditure of two Mental Traits you can walk into \none shadow and exit from another up to 50 feet away. This power \nacts as a limited form of teleportation. You may use it to bypass solid \nwalls, ascend a floor in a building, and get around other obstacles. \nYou may also attempt to pull others through a shadow by reaching \ninto the shadow, grabbing the victim and pulling her through to \nyour own location (this requires a Physical Challenge). You may \ncarry objects through the shadows (including living creatures). Use \nof this power requires you to state which shadow you wish to step \nthrough, then to walk over the stated shadow from which you wish \nto exit and then resume play. Use of this power is a Fair Escape. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPotence \nMaster \nForce \nYour supernatural strength has reached proportions that are \nthe stuff of legend. You amaze fellow Kindred as you heft cars from \nthe street, and are able to grind coal into diamonds with your bare \nhands. So devastating is your immense strength that in physical \nconfrontations opponents must now defeat you in two tests instead \nof one. If either test is lost, your opponent takes damage. If your \nopponent is using Force, and if each of you wins one of the tests, you \nboth take full damage. \nDemolition \nYou now possess power so colossal that only the suicidal or the \ninsane would cross you in a test of strength. You are so dangerous in \nhand-to-hand combat you inflict two additional wounds if you win the \nchallenge. If your opponent uses Demolition, and if each of you wins \none of the tests, you both take full damage. \nPresence \nMaster \nLove \nThis power duplicates the effect of a Blood Bond for as long as the \ntarget is in your presence. You must win a Social Challenge for this \nDiscipline to take effect. \nMind Numb \nThis power allows you to cause those around you (up to, but not \nexceeding five targets) to lose all feeling, emotion and any motivation \nfor action. After choosing the group affected, you must expend a \nWillpower Trait, then conduct a Social Challenge against each \nmember in the group. If you are successful, all affected targets will tend \nto do nothing. Some may continue to perform rote tasks, such as \nvacuuming or stirring, if they were doing so just before Mind Numb \ntook affect. The targets react to nothing but simple and immediate \ninput, such as hot objects put in their hands. They will not be \nfrightened if put in danger, or become angry if they are yelled at. This \neffect lasts as long as you are in their presence. Any direct action \nintended to cause physical harm to the target breaks the hold. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nFlesh of Marble \nYour skin has become as hard as stone, but loses none of its \nflexibility. It is now almost impossible to cut you, stake you, or do lasting \nphysical damage to you. Opponents must defeat you in three successive \ntests to stake you (in addition to winning the necessary Physical \nChallenge). A character with Flesh ofMarble doubles his Health Levels \nwith regard to wounds of a physical nature. Flesh of Marble would not \nblock such Disciplines as Death of the Drum, Cauldron of Blood, etc. \nForm of the Ghost \nWhile similar to Mist Form in that you become insubstantial, Form \nofthe Ghost allows you to retain your own form and to move at a normal \npace. Gravity and the elements (except fire and sunlight) do not affect \nyou normally, henceforth giving you a version of flight. In addition, \nsolid objects have no effect on you, and you may pass through them at \nwill. You may not physically manipulate objects in the solid world. You \nmust expend a Blood Trait to enter this form, which may be left at will. \nThe transformation into Form of the Ghost is instantaneous and in \nsome situations may give a Fair Escape. When you are employing this \npower, you cannot touch or be touched by another character employ- \ning this power. While in this form you are still affected by wards, and \ncan utilize any Discipline that does not require touch. \nQuietus \nBasic \nWeakness \nWith this power, you can utilize your blood as a contact poison. \nFlesh-to-flesh contact, the expenditure of a Blood Trait and a success- \nful Physical Challenge are all required to use Weakness. If the attempt \nis successful, the victim is down two Physical Traits for an hour. \nMaster \nTaste of Death \nYou may now spit a Trait’s worth of blood at your foes, doing \naggravated damage to those you hit. An attack of this form is consid- \nered a ranged attack; therefore, you may use Mental Traits to defend \nagainst your target’s Physical Traits. You may spit blood 10 feet for \nevery two Physical Traits you possess. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nFoul Blood \nBy expending a Willpower Trait, you permanently make the blood of \na vessel undrinkable and vile to anyone but yourself. Anyone who drinks \nthe blood of a tainted vessel must spend the next minute vomiting \nprofusely, and takes one nonaggravated wound per Blood Trait consumed. \nSerpentis \nMaster \nTemptation \nYou can attempt to tempt the target into evil actions (e.g., murder, \nslander, thievery, etc.) by simply speaking with her and telling her about \nher weakness. If the target is visibly upset at another character, you may \ninitiate a Social Challenge to implant a suggestion in the target’s mind \nregarding that character that the target will attempt to carry out at all \ncosts. You may not spend Willpower Traits in the normal fashion to \nnegate the effects of Temptation. Willpower Traits may be spent over \ntime to stave off its effects. It takes a total of eight Willpower Traits to \nnegate the effects of Temptation. The target may be induced to perform \nactions that cause her to receive Beast or Path Traits. \nObsession \nThis power inspires the target with an overpowering lust for a \ncertain substance or condition as dictated by you. You need only speak \nwith the target, telling her about this “lust” and defeat her in a Social \nChallenge. Whether the desire in question be money, sex or power, the \ntarget will crave it uncontrollably. The target must possess or experience \nthe object of her desire at least once during the night, or she will frenzy \nwhen the game session nears its end (dictated by the Narrator). The \ntarget may try to stave off the Obsession once per night by winning a \nStatic Challenge against her own total Mental Traits. To permanently \nrid herself of the Obsession she must expend a total of nine Willpower \nTraits. With this Discipline, the target may be induced to perform \nactions that cause her to receive Beast or Path Traits. \nBasic \nSummon Spirit Beasts \nYou can call on the spirits of dead animals to aid you. These spirits will \nbe predisposed to helping you, and can follow simple telepathic com- \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmands. The spirits can take any action of which they were capable in \nnormal life (e.g., a bird spirit can fly, a dog spirit has keen hearing, etc.). \nGenerally it takes one Mental Trait to summon aspirit, but aNarrator may \nissue a higher cost for a larger, more powerful spirit. The spirit arrives in \n10-30 minutes. No one can see the spirit companion except those who \nhave powers that enable them to see into the spirit world. The spirit will \naid you for one night, and then return to the land of the dead. \nMaster \nEngling Fury \nYou may now feed off an animal spirit to replenish all your lost \nWillpower Traits. Use of this power destroys the spirit, however, and \nmay only be invoked once per session. After using this Discipline, you \nmay not access any other Spiritus powers for the remainder of the night. \nSpirit Form \nWith this power you can transform yourself into the spiritual form \nof any natural animal not larger than a bear and no smaller than a \nhummingbird. In many respects this power works similarly to the \nProtean Discipline Shadow of the Beat. In this form you appear as a \nghostly version of the animal in question; however, you are actually a \nsolid creature which can attack and be wounded normally. The change \nonly alters your body and normal clothes; other equipment, including \nweapons, are unchanged. To activate this power you must expend a \nBlood Trait. This power takes one action to activate. You gain extra \nPhysical Traits while in this spirit form, depending on its size. As a \nsmall creature (e.g., a bird or a bat), you gain the Physical Traits Quick \nand Lithe. As a medium creature (e.g., a wolf or a dog), you gain the \nPhysical Traits Ferocious x 2 and Vigorous. If you assume the form of a \nlarge creature (e.g., a bear or a tiger), you gain the Physical Traits \nFerocious, Rugged, Stalwart and Tough. \nThanatosis \nBasic (Level 2) \nHag’s Wrinkles \nWith the expenditure of a Blood Trait, you may expand or contract \nyour skin, allowing you to change both your general appearance and \napparent age. This ability can also be used to conceal small items in your \nbody by creating pockets of flesh that are then tightly sealed. \nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\n \n.\n.\n \n72 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMaster \nCompress \nBy expending three Blood Traits and defeating the target in a Physical \nChallenge, you can cause the your opponent’s skin to shrink until it \nruptures, causing two aggravated wounds. If the attack succeeds, you can \nthen “absorb” your victim’s skin into your own body, gaining three \nPhysical Traits (Resilient, Tough, Vigorous) for the remainder of the night. \nDust to Dust \nThis power is similar in appearance to the Intermediate Discipline \nAshes to Ashes, but is much more potent. Once you opt to transform \ninto a pile of heavy ashes, you retain complete control over all mental \nDisciplines except Dominate and Thaumaturgy. The dust cannot be \nforced apart or moved by the wind unless you so desire. You can also \nuse winds to aid movement while in this form. Like characters \nemploying the Form ofMist, you retain cohesion without difficulty. To \nenter this form requires the expenditure of two Physical Traits. \nThaumaturgy \nPath of Coninring \nNothing larger or heavier than the conjurer may be summoned \n(no LAW rockets and no tanks). Conjured items differ from their \n“live” counterparts in that they seem too perfect and have no distin- \nguishing characteristics. \nBasic \nSummoning the Spirit \nYou can summon a simple inanimate object with the expenditure \nof one Willpower Trait. The object cannot be more complex than a \nhand-held object with no moving parts (dagger, pencil) and weighing \nno more than 10 pounds. The object remains solid for 10 minutes for \nevery Willpower Trait expended (e.g., three Willpower equals 30 \nminutes), then returns to the place from which it was summoned. \nPermanency \nYou can conjure an object without the expense of Willpower. The \nobject cannot be more complex than a hand-held object with no \nmoving parts (dagger, pencil). An object conjured in this fashion is \npermanent and must be physically returned to its place of origin. The \ncost for this power is the expenditure of two Blood Traits. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nIntermediate \nMagic of the Smith \nYou can summon forth complex objects with moveable parts \n(handguns, CD players, anything within the limits of size) with the \nexpenditure of two Willpower Traits. You must have a working \nknowledge (Storyteller’s discretion) of the object. The object remains \nfor 10 minutes per every Willpower Trait you expend (e.g., three \nWillpower points equals 30 minutes). Permanency will not affect \nobjects conjured with this power. \nAdvanced \nPower Over Life \nYou may create simple simulacra of living beings. These creations \nlack free will, emotions and creativity, but will follow your orders. To \nconjure the simulacra requires the expenditure of five Blood Traits. \nThe beings last for one evening and may not be made permanent. \n(Note: Simulacra [or golems] created in this way have seven Physical \nTraits, no Mental or Social Traits, no Abilities, and are immune to all \nMental and Social Challenges.) \nSpirit Thaumaturgy \nFailures in Spirit Thaumaturgy are not recommended; the spirit of \na botched summoning may turn out to be a Spectre or may decide to \nfollow the vampire around for a while to harass her. This is the rarest \nPath of Thaumaturgy; most of its practitioners learned the rudiments \nas mortals. This Path is known among Sabbat and Camarilla Tremere. \nBasic \nEvil Eye \nYou can summon a wraith to harass a victim for a duration of time \ndetermined by the number of Mental Traits expended into the \nchallenge. You must defeat the victim in a Mental Challenge. If you \nare successful, the victim must bid two extra Traits in any challenges \nfor 10 minutes. You may extend the duration of harassment at the cost \nof one Mental Trait per five minutes. \nSpirit Eyes \nYou may attempt to see and communicate with wraiths in the area. \nA successful Mental Challenge versus the wraith is required before you \nare able to see or communicate with it. You may communicate with the \nghost for five minutes for every Mental Trait you expend. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nintermediate \nSpirit Slave \nThis power allows you to master a summoned wraith. To use \nthis power, you must win a Mental Challenge against the wraith. \nIf you win the test, the wraith is bound to remain and answer any \nquestions you like, or perform any one task you require. If \nunwilling, the wraith might opt to perform the task poorly. An \nadditional use of this power can force a recently dead wraith \ninto permanently haunting the present location. This effect \nrequires a successful Mental Challenge against the target. How- \never, this effect can (at the Storyteller’s discretion) eventually \nwear off. \nJourney \nThis power is similar to the Auspex power of Psychic Projection, \nbut your spirit remains within the physical realm. Your body \nremains in one place while the spirit travels around. You can be \ntrapped inside fetishes when in this state, and can potentially be \ncontrolled by any spirit power. Mental Disciplines that do not \nrequire touch are available for use while in this state, with the \nexception of Necromancy or any other Spirit Thaumaturgy. Any \npower requiring physical contact or that manipulates the physical \nbody is unavailable. Your spirit is visible to those around you unless \nObfuscate is being used. To activate this power requires the expen- \nditure of one Willpower Trait. While in this form, your spirit is \nimmune to physical harm but is affected by sunlight and wards as \nnormal. \nAdvanced \nFetishes \nYou can cause spirits to inhabit objects, or fetishes, which you \nmay then carry around with you. Once the spirit is imprisoned, \nthe fetish will allow you access to one and only one power (not to \nexceed Advanced level) that the spirit possesses. The power that \nbecomes available is determined by the Storyteller. A successful \nMental Challenge against the victim is all that is required to bind \nthe spirit to the fetish. The spirit is trapped in the fetish until the \nfetish is broken. Before you may access any power of the fetish, \nyou must permantly expend a Mental Trait to attune the item to \nyourself. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nElemental Mastery \nBasic \nElemental Strength \nThis power allows you to increase your Physical Traits without the \nneed to expend Blood Traits. You can expend one Willpower Trait to \ngain the Physical Traits BTUWTI~, Dexterous and Resilient. To maintain \nthis power, you must continue to expend one Willpower Trait per \nround after the first round. You may only spend one Willpower Trait \nper round toward this Discipline. \nWooden Tongues \nThis power allows you to gain information from inanimate objects. You \nmay attempt to gain impressions of what the object has experienced by \nsucceeding in a static Mental Challenge against the object (difficulty \ndetermined by Storyteller). The object’s memories are limited and its \nfeelings may be completely alien to you, but any information gained can be \nextremely valuable. This use of the Discipline usually requires the assistance \nof a Narrator. To enact this power, you must expend a Mental Trait. \nIntermediate \nAnimate the Unmoving \nThis power allows you to animate objects that are within line of \nsight. With the expenditure of one Willpower Trait and a successful \nStatic Challenge, you can call upon an object to perform a simple task. \nChairs can run, statues can walk or attack, and a stake could squirm out \nof someone’s hand. You may keep the object active past the first round \nat the cost of one Mental Trait per extra round. The Narrator should \ndetermine the Traits of the object. \nElemental Form \nWith the expenditure of one BloodTrait, you can assume the form \nof an inanimate object of equal size and weight to your own (e.g., a \nchair, desk, pillar, etc.). You may opt also to spend one Willpower \nTrait at the time of change, which allows you to have access to your \nsenses and Disciplines. There is no cost to return to your original form. \nAdvanced \nSummon Elemental \nThis power allows you to beckon one of the traditional elementals \nof myth (fire, water, air and earth). You must succeed in a Static \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMental Challenge against 10 Traits to summon the elemental. Then \nyou must win a Simple Test to control the creature. If you fail the \nSimple Test, the elemental attacks you. If it is controlled, you may \nbanish the elemental at will. See Laws of the Wild for the statistics of \nthe elementals. The duration of this power is one hour. \nCorruption \nAll of these powers require that the target be within arm’s reach \nof the caster. Setites cannot learn this Path without first learning the \nPath of Blood. \nBasic \nContradict \nYou can make the target say or do the opposite of her intended \naction. A left turn becomes a right turn, or a yes becomes no. You must \ndefeat the target in a Mental Challenge to have this effect. \nDisfigurement \nThis Discipline allows you to make minor changes to a target’s \nfacial features for the night. You could remove eyebrows, lengthen the \ntarget’s nose, or enlarge her ears. This ability is not powerful enough \nto disguise an individual completely or even to make the target \nunrecognizable. You must succeed in a Mental Challenge against the \ntarget. If you are successful, the target receives the Negative Trait \nRepulsive x 2 for the remainder of the evening. \nIntermediate \nChange Mind \nYou can change the Demeanor of your target for the evening. The \nvictim is affected by drastic mood swings immediately, as her De- \nmeanor changes to your choice. This power requires a successful \nMental Challenge. \nCripple \nThis power allows you to turn your victim into an invalid for a \nround. The target may not initiate Physical Challenges and must bid \nthree extraTraits in any Physical Challenge initiated against her. You \nmust expend a Willpower Trait and win a Mental Challenge against \nthe victim. For each level of Fortitude the target possesses, you must \nexpend an additional Mental Trait. You may opt to extend the time \nof affliction at a cost of one Mental Trait per minute. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAdvanced \nCorrupt Soul \nAfter the expenditure of a Willpower Trait in addition to a \nsuccessful Mental Challenge, you can change your target’s Nature for \nthe evening. This ability is a more intense version of Change Mind and \ncan warp the victim’s very essence. \nVicissitude \nMaster \nBody Arsenal \nYou can use your own body to create weapons. You can \nmanifest claws similar to the Protean power Wolfs Claws, but this \npower goes far beyond that. By expending a Blood Trait and \ninvesting one Mental Trait per Physical Trait of the weapon (up to \nbut not exceeding three Traits) you may can create any melee \nweapon you can imagine (i.e., sword, club, dagger, whip, etc.) from \nyour flesh. No projectile weapons can be created by the use of this \npower. Weapons thus created inflict aggravated wounds. Note: \nThis power never allows more than a three-Trait bonus at any one \ntime, nor does it add to the Traits one acquires by switching to \nHorrid Form. \nPlasmic Form \nYou can turn parts of your body to blood and then reform \nthem later. You choose what parts of your body to turn to blood. \nIf you so desire, you may manipulate the blood once it has been \ncreated. You can move any or all of the blood, and travel through \ncracks, under doors, etc. You are immune to all physical attacks \nother than fire and sunlight while in this form. You can travel as \na pool of red liquid or appear completely normal except for the red \ncoloration (although you will still be a mass of blood held in a \nbipedal form by surface tension). In this state you can speak and \nwalk normally. \nWhen in this form, your body parts are not solid to bullets and \nfists splash harmlessly through you. You will not be able to “hit” \nanyone, drink blood or engage in other physical activity except as \nnoted above. You may only use Mental and Social Disciplines \nwhile in this form. To activate this power you must expend two \nBlood Traits. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nVisceratika \nKindred of the Gargoyle bloodline are the only vampires who can \npossess this Discipline. \nBasic \nSkin of the Chameleon \nBy expending a Blood Trait, you can make your skin take on the \ntexture of your surroundings. By standing still or moving very \nslowly (one step per three seconds) you blend in so well you cannot \nbe seen by normal eyes. Characters with Heightened Senses may opt \nto do a Mental Challenge against your Physical Traits to find you. \n(Note: Unlike Unseen Presence, this power is not a trick of the mind \nand does not cause characters to actively avoid your location.) You \nmay move and speak while utilizing this power, but its usefulness is \nnullified at that point. \nWhispers of the Chamber \nWith the expenditure of a Willpower Trait, you are able to \nattune yourself to detect intruders within an enclosed area. The area \ncan be as large as a small apartment (about 30' by 30') with which you \nare intimately familiar. This power works even if the intruders are \nout of sight, in darkness or protected by Obfuscate. If the target is \nactively seeking to avoid being detected, a Mental Challenge versus \nthe target is in order. \nIntermediate \nVoices of the Castle \nAs Whispers of the Chamber, but affecting an entire building or \nphysical structure. \nAdvanced \nBond with Terra \nSimilar to the Protean power Earth Meld, this power allows you \nto melt into stone, brick or asphalt. However, this power does not \nallow you to sink deep into the protective surroundings. Instead, you \nseep just below the surface and a faint outline of your form can be \nseen above where you rest. This power protects from both fire and the \nsun. If an adversary attempts to harm you, the surrounding rock \neffectively gives you five extra Healthy Traits. This power requires \nthe expenditure of a Blood Trait. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMaster \nStonestrength \nYour flesh hardens and takes on a very distinct rocklike quality. \nEvery manifestation of this power is different in appearance. For some \nit results in a look of polished marble, while others resemble rough \ngranite. Your skin becomes rock hard and pain is deadened, giving you \nthe extra Physical Trait Tough (above and beyond the maximum \nallowed by generation). You are immune to wound penalties and take \nonly half damage from fire. \nRockheart \nYour innards become rocklike. You are considered to have \ndouble Health Levels against physical attacks that do piercing or \nsmashing damage. To stake you, your attacker must at least have \nPuissance. (Note: If this power is used in conjunction with Flesh of \nMarble no extra Health Levels are gained, but it now takes three tests \nto stake you.) \nRituals \nBasic \nBlood Walk \nThis ritual allows you to trace the lineage of a subject. By winning \na Simple Test, you may learn the identity of the target’s sire. You can \ncontinue testing in order to learn successive ancestors, though a single \nfailure ends the ritual. Each successive test requires the same time \ninvestment as the initial ritual. \nCalling the Restless Spirit \nBy enacting this ritual, you can summonup aghost for five minutes \nof conversation after succeeding on a Simple Test. Any interruption \nends the conversation. You must be within 10 feet of the corpse, or in \nthe area of a haunting in the case of wraiths. This power gives you no \ncontrol over the spirit in question, who is not required to do the \nsummoner’s bidding. This will work on a vampire who has died the \nFinal Death, but not through diablerie. \nDonning the Mask of Shadows \nBy casting this ritual, you are able to conceal yourself in shadows, \nmuch as the Obfuscate power Unseen Presence. For each Mental Trait \ninvested, you have the ability to become invisible for one hour. All \nbenefits and liabilities for Unseen Presence apply. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMourning Life Curse \nThis one-hour ritual may be prepared ahead of time, requiring \ncrocodile blood, and completed before the end of the evening. By \nwhispering the final word in the ear of a mortal, you cause said mortal \nto cry tears of blood. There is no known defense, and the victim will \ncontinue to bleed until the caster breaks the line of sight. The effect \nis not painful, but could greatly disturb a victim. The bleeding is slow, \ncausing loss of one Blood Trait per every five minutes. As well as \nnormal after-effects of blood loss, the subject’s eyes will be bloodshot. \nPrincipal Focus of Vitae Infusion \nYou are able to alter an object so as to hold a Blood Trait. The \nobject must be able to fit into your hands, but no smaller than a pea. \nAfter receiving the Blood Trait, the object becomes reddish and slick. \nYou can reclaim this blood by touching the object and willingly \nreleasing it from its enchantment, causing the object to disintegrate \nand turn into the Blood Trait. Another Kindred may be incorporated \ninto the ritual, allowing him to claim the Blood Trait, but he must be \npresent during the initial casting. The Blood Trait used is still yours. \nThis ritual takes four hours to cast. Blood contained in this manner will \nnot spoil as other blood does. \nRite of Introduction \nThis ritual allows you to announce yourself to all Tremere within \na city. After performing the ritual, which requires speaking into a \ncloud of water vapor, you may speak with a recipient for five minutes \nfor every Mental Trait expended. This starts with the Regent of the \nchantry within the city and progresses to the others according to their \nknowledge of Thaumaturgy, \nfrom greatest to least. The casting allows \nyou to write down a short introduction which is then given to all \nTremere. If a conversation is then desired by one of the city residents, \nyou must expend a Mental Trait before you may speak. Only one \nperson may be spoken to at a time; traditionally, only the Regent \nreplies to the announcement. \nUnless the player can produce an overwhelming reason not to \nselect this Rite as her basic ritual, characters should default to Rite \nof Introduction. \nRebirth of Mortal Vanity \nThis simple ritual allows you to grow hair after the Embrace. It is also \nusable on others. A hair from a different mortal child is required for each \ninch of hair growth desired. It can be useful in facilitating disguises. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nScent of the Garou’s Passing \nSmelling a mixture of wolfsbane, milkweed and some more \n- \narcane foul-smelling ingredients will allow you to detect the pres- \nence of a Garou. A Mental Challenge must be won against the target, \nand you can only identify Garou that you have previously smelled \nbefore. You are able to determine the following things: gender, time \nof passage and breed. \nThe Open Passage \nThis ritual takes 10 minutes and a Blood Trait to cast. The \ncaster traces an intricate design upon a barrier, such as a stone \nwall, which will then become insubstantial for the purpose of \nallowing someone to pass through. The ritual only lasts for one \nminute. \nWake with Morning’s (Evening’s) Freshness \nThis ritual must be performed immediately prior to going to \nsleep for the day. Complete meditation is required. Any interrup- \ntion, or the performance of other activities after the ritual but \nbefore going to sleep, renders the ritual null and void. At any sign \nof danger during the day, you will immediately awaken. You will be \nable to act normally, as if it were night, except for being able to go \ninto the sun. Feathers must be burned and spread over the sleeping \narea to cast this ritual. Also, you must spend a Mental Trait to get \nthe proper meditation. \nIntermediate \nBinding the Beast \nThis 10-minute ritual will remove a Kindred from frenzy, \nseparating him from his Beast for a short while. You need not see \nthe subject; merely drink one Blood Trait from the frenzying \ncharacter (which could have been obtained earlier), and push an \niron spike through the palm of your hand, causing a normal \nwound. Upon completion, the target immediately emerges from \nfrenzy and becomes extremely passive, gaining the Negative \nTraits Submissive x 2 for the remainder of the night. \nBladed Hands \nThis ritual requires you to expend a Blood Trait and takes 10 \nminutes to cast. Upon doing so you gain the bonus Physical Trait \nSharp until next sunrise. Be careful when handling fragile objects or \ntouching people; a handshake could be dangerous. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nEyes of the Past \nBy expending two Mental Traits and casting this ritual, you are \nable to view events at the location of the casting, up to five years \nprior. A specific time and date must be chosen. Up to a five-minute \ntime span can be watched, and during this full sensory enchantment, \nyou will be unaware of your physical surroundings. This ritual may \nonly affect one room. \nFlesh of Fiery Touch \nThis protective ritual causes your skin to become a lethal trap. \nAnyone who lays bare hands upon your skin will be burned. This \nritual lasts until the next nightfall. For each touch, or once per turn \nfor continued touches, the target takes one aggravated wound. \nCasually brushing against someone will not cause damage, nor will \nyour clothes be set aflame. This ritual is not without its drawbacks. \nDuring this two-hour ritual, you must spend a Willpower Trait, and \nswallow a burning coal, which inflicts an aggravated wound. This \ncan be reduced with Fortitude or healed as normal. While you are \nenchanted, your skin has a noticeable bronze tint and feels hot to \nanyone touching it. The effect works only for skin on skin - \neven \na thin layer of clothing destroys the effect. \nGentle Mind \nWith this ritual, you are able to bestow an extra two Willpower \nTraits upon the subject for the purpose of resisting frenzy. You and the \ntarget must exchange one Blood Trait each, consuming one from the \nsubject in order to cast this ritual; the caster may never cast this on \nhimself. The extra Willpower Trait can only be used to resist frenzy \nand nothing else. The duration of this ritual is one night. \nHaunted House \nThis ritual may be cast on any Kindred’s haven. After casting, \nrumors begin to circulate of the location being haunted, leading \nmany to shun it. Even those who profess disbelief will avoid the \nplace. You must spend three Blood Traits to cast this ritual, with \nmore Blood Traits increasing the effect. The ritual will last for 10 \nyears, at which time, mortals will begin to rationalize the place as \nmerely run-down or just weird. Most vampires treat this ritual as a \nbreach of the Masquerade. \nHeart of Stone \nBy casting this ritual, your heart turns to solid stone, leaving \nyou immune to staking. The ritual requires an earthen circle three \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ninches high and six feet in diameter to be formed on a natural stone \nsurface (poured stone, such as concrete, is not acceptable). You \nmust lie prone in the center and place a lighted candle directly over \nyour heart, allowing it to burn down. This causes one aggravated \nwound. The ritual will last as long as the caster desires, dispelled \nwith a thought. While under this enchantment, you cannot spend \nWillpower. If you are forced to spend Willpower, the ritual ends \nimmediately. While under the effects of this ritual, you lose all \nFriendly or Compassionate Social Traits, and gain a number of \nCallous Negative Social Traits equal to half your remaining allot- \nment of Social Traits. \nIllusion of Peaceful Death \nThis ritual heals visible wounds on a corpse, making it appear \nas if the person has died of natural causes. It does not add blood to \na corpse, but will remove reasons for a person to check for blood \nloss. At least half of a full Blood Pool must be in the body for this \nritual to work. You must “dust” the corpse with a white feather and \nexpend two Mental Traits. \nInnocence of the Child’s Heart \nThis ritual hides your aura from Aura Perception. Anyone using \nthat Discipline successfully upon you sees a white aura, devoid of any \nsigns of vampirism. A mortal child’s toy must be carried throughout \nthe duration of the ritual, which lasts for one hour per Mental Trait \ninvested at the time of the casting. \nProtean Curse \nThe target of this ritual is turned into a bat, as with the Protean \nDiscipline Form of the Beast. The target must drink a Blood Trait \ntaken from a rabid vampire bat. If the target is unwilling, the caster \nmust defeat him in a Physical Challenge. This ritual affects only \nKindred and humans, and lasts only one night. \nRending Sweet Earth \nWith this ritual you can open a 10-foot by 10-foot opening into \nthe earth, leading to an Earth Melded vampire. If the Earth Melded \nKindred is asleep, he is automatically awakened, but will not do so \nif in torpor. The ritual must be cast exactly where the vampire \nentered the ground. The caster strikes the ground repeatedly with \na leather whip and must defeat the subject in a Mental Challenge. \nIf the target is in torpor, the ritual automatically works. The effect \nlasts only for a single night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe Unseen Change \nThis ritual requires marking an area with wolfs blood poured from \na silver jug and investing a number of Mental Traits. Any Garou \nentering the area must win a Static Mental Challenge, difficulty \ndetermined by the number of invested Traits, or be forced to automati- \ncally change to Lupus form and stay that way while within the circle. \nOnce activated, the ritual remains in effect for one evening. \nThe Watcher \nThis ritual summons a rat, who then goes wherever the caster \ndirects and looks for whatever the caster indicates. When the rat \nreturns, the caster may touch its head and see what it has seen. The \ncaster may even have the rat steal small objects, but she must be \nexacting in detail about the object’s appearance and location to \navoid mistakes. You must win a Static Social Challenge, the \ndifficulty determined by the number of rats nearby, in order to cast \nthis ritual. It lasts until next sunrise. The summoned rat is still \nsubject to Animalism Disciplines. \nAdvanced \nBlood Contract \nUsing a Blood Trait, you create a binding agreement between \ntwo parties. If either party willingly breaches the agreement, the \nresult is Final Death of he who broke the pact. Both parties must use \na Blood Trait to sign the agreement. The only way to dissolve the \ncommitment is to complete one’s part of the contract, or to physi- \ncally burn the agreement. \nCurse of Clytaemnestra \nThrough use of this ritual, you are able to destroy one male \nmortal (including ghouls) by aging him rapidly, decaying him into \nnothing. You must have a personal possession of the subject, as well \nas at least one Blood Trait. The ritual takes one full day to cast. The \ntarget can resist by winning a Static Physical Challenge, the diffi- \nculty determined by the number of Blood Traits invested by the \ncaster during the ritual. If the subject ties, then he is merely crippled \nand takes three normal wounds. \nStone Slumber \nBy casting this ritual, which must start two hours before dawn, you \nare turned into stone at sunrise. Similar to any other stone statue, you \ncan be moved from place to place, even through sunlight, remaining \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\na statue until sunset. To rise from this form, three Blood Traits must \nbe expended, as opposed to the normal one. You are immune to staking \nand most forms of fire. Pieces can be broken off, though, doing \nhowever much damage the Narrator decides. Most forms of commu- \nnication are impossible, as the caster’s mind is dormant. While in \nstatue form, all of your Physical Traits are changed to Enduring, and \nyou have double the Health Levels with regards to any physical \ndamage attempted upon you. Activating this ritual requires the \nexpenditure of two Mental Traits and a piece of rock broken off from \nanother statue. \nClan Assamite Rituals \nThe Tremere are not the sole masters of Thumturgy. The \nAssamites have developed a number of rituals since their curse at the \nhands of the Tremere. You are required to have mastery of the \nappropriate level of the Quietus discipline to be able to learn one of \nthese rituals of the same level. \nBasic \nBlood of Peace \nA BloodTrait can be converted into asleeping elixir with this ritual. \nIt takes 10 minutes and two Blood Traits to cast this ritual. After the \nBlood Trait has been enchanted, it may be applied to a subject through \ningestion or contact with the skin. You must then defeat the victim in \na Mental Challenge; success indicates the target falls into a deep sleep \nwhich lasts for at least 10 minutes. Only extremely violent actions have \na chance to wake a sleeper. This ritual works only on mortals. \nBlood Call \nThrough use of this ritual you create a limited form of mental \ncontact between yourself and another. Both parties involved must \ngive two Blood Traits during the casting of the ritual, and then expend \na permanent Mental Trait each. Afterward, if either party is destroyed, \nthe other receives a vision containing the details of the demise. \nIntermediate \nLight of Vengeance \nA focused artificial light source (such as a lamp or flashlight) can \nbe changed into a weapon with almost the power of the sun. You must \nexpend a Blood Trait and smear it on the light source. When you wish \nto attack someone with the light, you must win a Mental Challenge \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nI\nI\n \nversus the target’s Physical Traits. Success means that the target takes \nan aggravated wound. The ritual lasts until all of the Blood Traits \nsmeared upon the light source are used up or until the end of the \nevening, when the blood is considered to have evaporated. Each \nsuccessful attack burns a Blood Trait from the light source, and the \nattacks can only be directed at a single target. \nAdvanced \nHealing Blood \nThe healing of aggravated wounds becomes much easier with the \nuse of this ritual. Upon meditating for 10 minutes and expending two \nMental Traits, you can heal an aggravated wound with only one Blood \nTrait, and no expenditure of Willpower. There is no limit to the \nnumber of aggravated wounds that may be healed in one night with the \ncasting of this ritual, but all wounds to be healed at the less expensive \ncost must be healed immediately following this ritual. Any action \nother than healing aggravated wounds ends the ritual immediately. \nBasic \nCraft Bloodstone \nThrough this ritual, you may create a small mystical object called \na Bloodstone. A Bloodstone acts as a magical beacon for the person to \nwhom it is attuned. Once you have attuned a Bloodstone, you may \nsense its exact location in a nonvisual manner. This enchantment \nusually lasts for a century or so, although some have lasted for as long \nas 500 years. To create a Bloodstone, you must find a suitable stone and \nleave it within a container holding at least three Traits of your Blood \nfor three nights. Each night you must chant over the container as the \nBloodstone absorbs each Blood Trait. After the third night, the liquid \nwithin the container becomes clear like water. The ritual may be \nended here, allowing you to sense the location of the Bloodstone \nwherever it is. \nYou can infuse more Blood Traits into the stone, at the rate of one \neach evening. These Blood Traits can be retrieved by anyone holding \nthe Bloodstone at a rate of one per evening. You must win a Static \nMental Challenge against a difficulty of five Traits each time the \nincantation is cast over the Bloodstone. This ritual can also be cast upon \na pre-existing Bloodstone to attune it to you, as well as recharge it. \n“i \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nEyes of the Nighthawk \nThis ritual allows you to receive the audio and visual informa- \ntion obtained by a bird. First you must touch the bird and feed it \na specially prepared birdseed mixed with your blood. You must \nwin a Static Mental Challenge against the bird (difficulty of five \nTraits). Upon success, you can then mentally control it, but \nwhere it will travel only. To receive information, you must close \nyour eyes and concentrate; this action will leave you unaware of \nyour current surroundings and unable to act until you break \nconcentration. This ritual lasts for one month before it must be \ncast again. \nIlluminate Trail of the Prey \nThrough the use of this ritual, you are able to view the trail of a \ntarget - \nfootprints, tire tracks, airplane trajectories, etc. - \nas a \nglowing neon trail. However, the trail ends as soon as the target wades \nthrough or submerses himself in water. You must have viewed the \ntarget and have a starting point where the target has been in the past. \nThe trail begins at the starting point, following the movements of the \ntarget, with the intensity of the glow being indirectly proportional to \nthe amount of time which has passed since the target was present at the \nlocation. The caster must defeat the target in a Mental Challenge in \norder to track him. \nImpassable Trail \nBy wrapping your feet in soft deerskin, you can pass through the \nthickest woods without leaving any visible trail. You must expend one \ndexterity-related Physical Trait to enact this ritual. The duration is an \nentire evening. \nThis Ritual works only in non-urban settings, though there are \nrumors that “advances” have been made allowing for the effects to \nfunction in even the heart of the urban jungle. \nMachine Blitz \nBy casting this ritual, you can cause machines in the area to go \nhaywire. You must expend a Mental Trait for each turn you desire this \nritual to remain in effect. The enchantment allows machines a limited \namount of movement, performing activity similar to their normal \nfunctions, even to the point of attacking whomever the caster desires. \nAny attacks use the caster’s Mental Traits with a two-Trait penalty. \nThe actual results should be determined between the involved parties, \nor by a Narrator. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPower of the Invisible Flame \nThis simple ritual allows one who knows Path of the Flame to \ncreate invisible fires. The effects can be felt as normal, but aren’t \nvisible. The ritual lasts for one evening, and must be cast around a fire \nof at least torch size. Each time you wish to make invisible flames, you \nmust expend a Mental Trait. You must have the Path of the Flame \nbefore you can learn this ritual. \nPreserve Blood \nBy casting this ritual, you are able to prepare blood against \nspoiling, keeping it in a specially prepared earthenware container. The \ncontainer must be prepared by burying it in earth for two nights. \nThereafter, the container must be dug up. The blood is added, and the \ncontainer is sealed with wax. Once opened, the blood spoils at a \nnormal rate. You must win a Static Mental Challenge (difficulty of \nfour Traits) in order to cast this ritual successfully. \nSteps of the Terrified \nThis ritual allows you to slow down a specific target. You must win \na Mental Challenge against the target. Afterward, each turn the \nvictim tries to run she is slowed to half her speed. A normal run would \nonly go half as far, while someone using Celerity would only get half as \nmany actions as normal to run away, possibly slowing her downenough \nfor lower levels of Celerity to catch her. As the victim tries to run each \nturn, she slows down by half again, eventually to a walk. The ritual \nrequires a small cube of dried mud, perfectly square on all sides. \nSummon Guardian Spirit \nThrough use of this ritual, you are able to summon a spirit for the \nnext 24 hours to guard you. The spirit cannot do more than warn you of \ndanger through interaction with the surrounding environment. It \ncannot speak and is only visible to you, and then only in times ofdanger. \nYou cannot be surprised for the duration of the ritual. You must win a \nStatic Social Challenge (difficulty of five Traits) to summon the spirit. \nWill 0’ the Wisp \nThis simple ritual allows you to produce a supernatural light source. This \nball of light can be mentally commanded to travel within your sight, and \neven perform simple tricks. The ball may become brighter, dimmer, separate \ninto smaller balls, dart about, encompass someone in its glow, etc. It is most \noften used as a simple light source or diversion. A willow branch is required \nin the casting. This ritual will last as long as you concentrate on it. A Mental \nTrait must be expended each hour you wish the light to remain active. \ne \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBottled Voice \nBy winning a Mental Challenge versus the target, speaking an \nincantation and gesturing toward an empty bottle, you are able to trap \nthe target’s voice within a bottle. The bottle must be sealed with wax \nin addition to any other closure, such as acork. While the seal or bottle \nremains intact, the target cannot speak. \nEldritch Glimmer \nBy casting this ritual, you are able to surround yourself in a green \nglow. You can then throw fire bolts of this energy at a cost of one Blood \nTrait per bolt. These bolts inflict one aggravated wound, and may only \nbe cast at the rate of one per turn. You must win a Mental Challenge \nversus the target’s Physical Traits in order to hit. Each time a bolt is \nfired, you must win a Simple Test or expend a Mental Trait to keep the \nritual from ending. The ritual’s duration is only until the next dawn. \nThis ritual requires a piece of sandstone soaked in vinegar. \nFire Walker \nThis ritual protects you from fire for up to an hour. Whenever you \nare attacked by fire and win a Simple Test, no damage is taken. A \nspecial salve must be rubbed on the soles of your feet, and two Mental \nTraits must be spent to cast this ritual. \nFriend of the Trees \nAnyone who tries to follow you through woods after you cast \nthis ritual is immediately subject to interference from the sur- \nrounding foliage. These plants animate slightly, slowing down \npursuers to half speed. You must plant an acorn and spend two \nMental Traits to cast this ritual. It lasts as long as you remain in the \nwoods or until the next sunrise. \nThe Haunting \nBy casting this ritual, you may summon a malevolent spirit to \ncause fear in a target. Like a poltergeist, this spirit will play tricks on \na subject, but its intentions are to frighten, to death if it can. This \nspirit usually has little effect on Kindred, but it will make werewolves \nuneasy and frighten mortals. The spirit cannot directly harm the \nvictim, but if it wins a Social Challenge against her, the spirit makes \nSimple Tests until it loses to determine how much harm it can do. \nOne success freezes the target in place for a few minutes; two causes \nher to faint; three causes her to become Incapacitated. Four can kill \nthe target unless she wins a Static Physical Challenge, the difficulty \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nequal to the spirit’s Social Traits. Survivors may awaken to find their \nhair turned white from the experience. Exactly what the spirit does \nand how long it haunt the victim is determined by the Narrator \nplaying the spirit. \nKeening of the Banshee \nWirh a horrifying scream, you can cause the person nearest to you \nto age 13 years minus his total Physical Traits. His hair also turns white. \nYou must win a Mental Challenge against the target in order to affect \nhim. This ritual requires a necklace with a pendant carved from an old \ntombstone. This does nothing to Kindred but can harm mortals, \nghouls and werewolves. \nMirror Walk \nWith this ritual, you are able to enter a mirror of a size big enough \nto crawl through. This allows you to use the mirror as agate to the nearest \nmirror of large enough size to allow you access. You may safely take one \nperson with you through the mirror. The mirror seems to liquefy, ripples \ncascading across the surface, returning to normal after you have gone \nthrough. You must be wearing a ring with an emerald when this ritual \nis in effect. If you are being chased, this ritual may be used as a Fair Escape. \nHowever, the pursuers, or anyone within five feet of the mirror when this \nis cast, may immediately state their intention to follow you through the \nmirror; otherwise the opportunity to follow is lost. \nIf the person does not come through the mirror willingly, she must \nwin a Static Physical Challenge against a difficulty of 6 or be killed, \none half of her lying in front of the entrance mirror and the other half \nlying in front of the exit mirror. You must expend three Mental Traits \nto enact this ritual. \nRespect of the Animals \nThrough use of this ritual you are able to travel through wilderness \nareas without danger from animals. Animals neither like nor dislike \nyou, but simply ignore you. Two Social Traits must be expended to \nenact this ritual, which lasts four hours. \nTouch of Nightshade \nThis ritual gives you a touch that is literally fatal. After you have cast \nthis ritual, the first mortal you touch must engage in a Physical \nChallenge with you. Ifhe loses, he dies, instantly and painfully. Ifhe ties, \nhe is in severe pain from cramps for the rest of the evening, and is down \ntwo Traits in all tests during that time. Winning the Challenge allows \nthe victim to avoid the effects, but he remains unaware of the attack. To \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncomplete this ritual you must rub juice from some form of nightshade \nonto your hands. The attack is only good for a single target; the second \nmortal you touch after performing the ritual is safe from its effects. \nAdvanced \nDominion \nThis three-hour ritual, the effects of which last for a week, provides \nan effective defense against certain vampiric Disciplines. Proper \ncasting of this ritual renders an area up to 500 square feet immune to \nall effects of Animalism, Dominate and Presence, except those you \nyourself create. Preparing the area properly mandates that iron seals be \nembedded over all doors within the area of effect, and they must \nremain so for the duration of the ritual’s effect. If any of the seals are \nmarred or removed, the effect ends instantly. You must expend three \nMental Traits to cast this ritual. \nEyes of the Beast \nSimilar to Eyes of the Nighthawk, this ritual allows you to see \nthrough the eyes of any animal you have previously enchanted to serve \nas a conduit for the power. To prepare an animal properly, you must \ntouch it on the forehead (not as easy as it sounds) and then win a Static \nMental Challenge against seven Traits. Thereafter (at least for the \nduration of the ritual), you can close your eyes and, by concentrating, \nsee through the enchanted beast’s eyes. The ritual’s effects last for six \nweeks, no matter how far the animal wanders from you. You may only \ncast this ritual on one animal at a time. \nLion Heart \nBy casting this ritual, you may increase your combat abilities. The \nritual bestows upon you the Physical Traits Brumy, Tough, Quick and \nEnduring. When in a challenge that might cause you to flee, or be \nsubject to a Fear frenzy, you gain an extra Willpower Trait. Finally, you \nalso gain two Abilities in Brawl and two Abilities in Leudership. This \nritual only lasts for 20 minutes. A Willpower Trait must be spent in \norder to enact this ritual. If you do not rest within two hours after the \ncompletion of this ritual, you will take one Health Level of damage for \nevery 10 minutes you do not rest. The amount of time necessary to be \nconsidered rested is one hour. \nMindcrawler \nAn insidious force within a victim’s mind is created by this ritual. \nYou must place your hand upon a victim’s head, which may require a \nPhysical Challenge; the victim feels a slight burning sensation. For \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nL \neach day afterward, the victim loses one Mental Trait until all are lost. \nAfter all Mental Traits are lost, the ritual ceases. The victim may \nregain these lost Traits by putting forth effort in recovering them, at \na rate of one Mental Trait per week. You must dye a small tick red, \npaint it with an arcane sigil, crush it, apply it to the victim’s head, and \nthen win a Mental Challenge against the target. \nPaper Flesh \nFor one night, the victim of this ritual is bereft of most of the \nbenefits of Fortitude and endurance-related Physical Traits. Victims of \neighth generation or higher lose all but one endurance-related Physi- \ncal Traits and Fortitude powers. With each succeeding generation, the \nvictim hangs onto an additional Trait and Fortitude power. \nIn order to inflict Paper Fksh on a target, you must defeat her in a \nMental Challenge and subsequently tear a picture of her in half. \nSpirit of Torment \nSimilar to The Haunting, this ritual lets you summon a spirit to do \nyour bidding. This time, the spirit is capable of taking on physical form \nand doing real damage to others. \nIn order to summon the spirit, you must win a Social Challenge. \nOnce the challenge is won, the spirit obeys your commands to the \nletter, until to it takes damage to its physical form. At that point, the \nspirit flees. \nThe spirit has 13 Physical Traits, three Social Traits and seven \nMental Traits. It has three Willpower Traits, the Abilities of Brawl x \n4, Intimidate x 3 and Occult. It also has the following Disciplines: \nHeightened Senses, Aura Perception, Might, Unseen Presence, Musk of \n1000 Faces and Cloak the Gathering. When trying to frighten someone, \nthe spirit gains three bonus Social Traits (Frightening x 3). Further- \nmore, by winning a Mental Challenge, the spirit can see and identify \nanything in the local Near Umbra. \nIn its normal form, the spirit is incorporeal, but it can spend a \nMental Trait in order to become corporeal for five minutes. The \nappearance, actions and other details of the spirit are left to the \ndiscretion of the Narrator. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\n1 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThough you should be going to live tkthousand years, and as many \ntimes ten thousand years, still remember that no one loses any other life than \nthis which they now live, nor lives any other than this which they now lose. \n- \nThe Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, Book I \nSymbols of Authority \nTonight it will finally happen: You will roleplay an elder Kindred \nin your game of The Masquerade. Your Storyteller agreed to let you \ntake the plunge, and you spent the better portion of last night \ndetermining your character’s Attribute Traits, Abilities, Influences \nand Disciplines. You relish the thought of entering tonight’s session \narmed with enhanced powers, an increased number of Blood Traits \nand the ability to thumb your nose at any other Kindred who tries to \nuse Dominate on you. You savor the thought of enforcing your \ncharacter’s every desire with the threat of serious retribution should \nanyone dare gainsay you, and you eagerly anticipate the first challenge \nto your authority. You are definitely ready for anything! \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThere is no denying that playing an elder Kindred can be a genuine \nadrenaline rush. Your character is, after all, one of the most powerful beings \nin the game, and there is little you could not accomplish through sheer force, \nthreats or outright violence. But there is more -far more -to roleplaying \nan elder than increased character statistics and access to higher levels of your \nDisciplines. Portraying an elder can mean your greatest roleplaying chal- \nlenge yet, a task which calls upon every ounce of skill you can muster. This \nis doubly true if you take the time to consider what being an elder vampire \nreally means in the context of a game. In this chapter you will learn helpful \nhints a b u t  roleplaying an elder character convincingly, as well as advice on \ninteracting with other characters. Most importantly, you will come to \nunderstandtheveryrealresponsibilities inherent in your role asanelder, and \nthe necessity of recognizing the benefits of cooperative roleplaying to \nenhance The Masquerade experience for everyone involved. \nDefining the Role - Who Are \nthe Elders? \nI am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls. My skin is black \nupon me, and my bones are burned with heat. \n-Job 30: 29-30 \nThe fledgling Kindred nightly finds herself beset on all sides by \ndangers both numerous and lethal. Warring vampire sects vie for her \nloyalty, lawless anarchs seek her precious vitae, and master manipulators \npull her strings from the shadows. Seductive compliments artfully camou- \nflage a bewildering array of offers and counteroffers. Polite conversations \nmask honeyed promises of grand rewards and veiled threats. She faces \ndemands for her obedience and appeals to her Humanity. She gingerly \npicks her way through her first nights among the Kindred, hoping to avoid \nenlisting unintentionally an elder’s pet cause. \nPrecisely who are these powerful, aged Kindred who tempt her? \nHow can they be so equally at home within both the city’s darkened \nalleys and its brilliantly lit salons? W h y  do they seek her participation in \ntheir schemes when they could as easily slay her, or bend her will to their \nown with their centuries-old power? Why should such as they care one \nwhit for the alliance of one so young and seemingly helpless as she? \n“They” are the elders, the Kindred who have withstood the test of time \nto survive beyond their neonate years and their ancilla decades to greet \nthe centuries anew each night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe exact point at which a vampire gains the designation of “elder” is \nnot clear. Most Kindred agree that when a vampire manages to survive at \nleast several centuries, she may begin using the title “elder” with some \njustification. The longevity requirement varies immensely around the \nworld. To become an elder in Europe, for example, requires centuries more \nthan it would in the New World. Despite these chronological disparities, \nelders are generally between 200 and 1,000 years old, give or take a century, \nand they are by and large Kindred of at least the eighth generation. What \nmakes such characters so attractive to Mind’s Eye Theatre players? \nThe Joy of Elders \nShall not the judge of all the earth do right? \n- \nGenesis 18: 25 \nElder characters are, by their very nature, more powerful than the \naverage neonate or ancilla character. The elder’s amassed strength is \ndue largely to the fact that she has lived for so much longer than her \nyounger cousins, gaining access over time to a greater number and \nwider range of Abilities, Influences and Disciplines. She gains a \ndecided advantage in many situations, which many players can find \nappealing. Consider the practical advantages of an elder character: \n-The elder’s Blood Pool is greater than that of younger vampires, \nfor she has learned over the centuries the means to extract the very last \niota of supernatural energy from the vitae she consumes. \n- \nAn elder has honed her Attributes so that her limitations exceed \nthose of most non-elder characters. For example, an elder may call upon a \ndeeper reserve of Willpower, enabling her to compel or resist compulsion \nmore readily than younger characters. These physical characteristics, in \naddition to age, are a large part of the reason why elders are usually treated \nwith some modicum of respect. After all, it doesn’t pay to mouth off to one \nwho could leave your bones in splinters or wipe your mind clean like a slate. \n- \nThis enhanced reputation and respect often translates into \nactual status. Elders are, with few exceptions, influential figures in \nKindred society, holding ranks as princes and primogen or bishops and \npaladins. Whatever their allegiance - \nCamarilla, Sabbat, or anarch \n- \nelders frequently occupy positions of authority, and are loath to \nsurrender them to ambitious childer. To reinforce this pecking order, \nyounger vampires are taught by their own sires and elders to heed the \nolder members of their respective clan and sect and maintain a healthy \nrespect for those elders of other clans as well. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPlaying an elder Kindred enables you to contribute a new element to your \nMind’s Eye Theatre game. An elder character has the potential to add a \nsignificant layer of depth to an existing chronicle. Your Storyteller may thrust \nyou into the thick of any number of pre-existing conflicts, or she may use your \ncharacter to introduce a new subplot or theme. An elder’s impact on a story \nis almost immediately noticeable. For example, an elder automatically \nbecomes a focal point for a variety of plots and subplots, simply due to her age \nand status. When younger Kindred are faced with puzzles, problems and \nmysteries, they often turn to their elders for direction. Your reaction to such \npleas will determine the extent to which you become involved in these plots. \nLater you may recognize that your character influences the game in \nmore subtle ways. Let’s say a current storyline includes an anarch pack \nlurking on the fringes of the city’s vampire society. Then your character \narrives. The anarchs will certainly want to know more about any elder \nwho shows up in their city, and any elder would want to know more \nabout potential diablerists. Your character may have to contend with \nanarch surveillance teams, or a test of her haven’s defenses. She may \neven find herself squaring off against the anarchs later in the chronicle \nwhen the pack decides fully to announce its presence. Similarly, your \ncharacter may unexpectedly tip the balance of power in favor of a \nparticular clan. Are you playing a Toreador Artiste? Her arrival might \nspark a new wave of plans, both between clan members and any rival \nclans in the vicinity. From the first night your character enters the story, \nyou should have no difficulty locating a plethora of conflicts and \nalliances. In fact, you may have to beat them away with a stick. \nHarbingers of Doom \nAs far as we can discern, the sole purpose of human existence is to kindle \n- \nCarl Jung, Memories, Dreams, Reflections \nPower, even fictional power, is a drug, and there’s no denying it is its \nown high. However, it is vital to recognize the equally indisputable fact \nthat a proliferation of very powerful characters, or even one moderately \npowerful character played in an irresponsible fashion, can spell disaster for \nany chronicle. Great power requires great responsibility, even in a make- \nbelieve setting. It is far easier to destroy a chronicle than to create one, \nparticularly within the live-action roleplaying paradigm. Your character \ncan be the proverbial double-edged sword unless you are prepared to \napproach the task with some measure of responsibility and respect. \na light of meaning in the darkness of mere being. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nResponsible Roleplaying \nDo not harbor sinister designs \n- \nMiyamoto Musashi, The Book of Five Rings \nJust as a rock thrown into the center of a pond causes ripples which \neventually reach to the water’s edge, so elders cause ripples on numerous \nlevels. Recognize that your own character could have a similar effect on \nthe game. Examine your character’s abilities and powers in relation to \nthe other characters in the game. Does your Ventrue possess Presence far \nbeyond that attained by the majority of other Ventrue characters around \nhim? Is your Tzimisce paladin the epitome of nocturnal horror, while \nyour fellow packmates might be hard-pressed to intimidate a Toreador \nfledgling? If you recognize a disparity of this nature between your own \ncharacter and those around you, you have an obligation not to ride \nroughshod simply because it is within your ability to do so. Rather, you \nshould become one of the stewards of the story, helping to guide its ebb \nand flow in the most enjoyable directions. \nThe Masquerade is a cooperative storytelling experience. Each \nparticipant -player, Narrator, Storyteller - \ncontributes in her own \nmanner to the overall success of the story. The game depends entirely \non the interactions between the various characters, and it is vital that \nyou recognize that all the participants want to enjoy the experience as \nmuch as you do. Beating other characters into torpor each game \nsession may be fun for you, but it’s rarely enjoyable for the players on \nthe receiving end. Violent acts that drastically affect other characters \nshould occur within the context of the story itself, not as a method of \ndealing with other characters just because you can. It’s one thing to \ndiscipline a neonate who thought she could mouth off to an elder, but \nentirely another to pick fights so you can show off your elder’s Traits. \nCreating an Elder Character \nWorking With Your Storyteller \nElder characters have the wherewithal to guide the game - \nindeed, they can (sometimes unintentionally) set the story’s tone and \npacing for an entire night, or even for the duration of a chronicle. \nTherefore, it is vital that you and the Storyteller be on the same page \nwhen you start creating the character. Set aside some time for you and \nthe Storyteller to discuss your character’s place in the story, and \nconsider how your concept will fit into the existing framework. What \nmight appear to be a perfect fit to you may actually be to the story’s \n” \n4 \n. \n” \nU \nU \nU \nU \nu \nII \nU \nII \nu \nI] \nu \nU \nU \nu\n-\n \n99 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ndetriment. The character may simply not mesh with the storyline, or \nit may prove disruptive and inappropriate for story-related reasons that \nthe Storyteller cannot reveal to you. The better the Storyteller \nunderstands your character’s powers, plans and background, the better \nshe will be able to plan your character’s involvement in the story. \nSometimes, you and your Storyteller may disagree on which charac- \nters are suited to the story. In such cases, trust your Storyteller. Be \nunderstanding and flexible; she’s telling you this for a reason. If the \nStoryteller requests that you consider a different character, ask about \ncharacter concepts and types which she believes will work with the story. \nElder Perspectives \nThe multiplying villainies of nature \n-William \nShakespeare, Macbeth \nElder vampires do not spring into being overnight. Any character \nwho is older than most countries usually sports a rich and colorful \npersonal history. Consider your character’s place in the history of the \nworld and its vampire denizens - \nwhere has she been? What has she \ndone? Where is she going? Thinking as a character who enjoys a \npotentially limitless lifespan is an exercise in advanced roleplaying, \nand one that you shouldn’t skimp on. \nBegin by thinking about your own life in comparison to the world \nevents which have occurred during your lifetime. Do you remember \nthe outbreak of World War 11, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the assassina- \ntionofpresident Kennedy, the Vietnam War, Watergate, U.S. hostages \nin Iran, the fall of the Berlin Wall or the Gulf War? Do you remember \nhow you reacted to these events when you first read or learned about \nthem? Did you understand then as well as you do now the effects these \nsituations would have upon the world as you know it? \nNext, try to think about some of the major events of this century \nthat you do not remember as circumstances in your life. Take World \nWar I, or the Jazz Era. What about the American stock market crash \nand the Great Depression? The more distant we become from events \nthe less likely we are to recall their details. T o  gain a sense of their \nimpact and place in history, we turn to books, films, plays and essays \nrather than to our own memories. \nThe same cannot be said for your elder vampire. She has existed \nfor centuries, observing the affairs of the mortal world pass before her \neyes as an endless parade of names, dates and headlines. How did she \nDo swarm upon him. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nreact to these events? Did some of them affect her in material ways? \nWas she even aware of them as they transpired? Consider the events \nof your own life and your own perspective of time, and then magnify \nthat same sensation 10 or 100 times. This marks the vast gulf in \nperspective and experience which yawns between the younger and \nolder Kindred. Whereas neonates and ancillae may have observed \nseveral decades, or even an entire century, their sense of historical \nscope is dwarfed by that of the elders. \nInstilling your character with some of this unique perspective is \nchallenging but worth the effort, and makes interaction with you more \ninteresting for the other players. If you take the time to perform some \nelementary historical research on the years during which your elder \nhas lived, you will be able to give a much more convincing perfor- \nmance when your character discourses with other vampires, ghouls \nand mortals. Was your Gangrel sheriff present when Robert Bruce’s \ntroops fell at Bannockburn? Did your Lasombra bishop play a role in \nthe Spanish Reconquista? Perhaps your Tremere insinuated himself \namong the mediums of the Age of Spiritualism, or maybe your \nMalkavian wrung her hands with glee when Nellie Bly exposed the \nhorrific practices of 19th-century insane asylums. \nYour character will gain a new depth and believability when your \nknowledge of past epochs manifests itself through roleplaying. Con- \nsider choosing one or two particular historical events which your \ncharacter witnessed and research them more thoroughly. Think of \nsensory details for these stories, memories not only of sights, but also \nsounds (the screams of wounded horses), smells (the bay leaves and \nincense burned for the Oracle at Delphi), tastes (the blood of a \ndrunken French courtier) and touches (the silk dressing gown you \nwore when you read the latest Sherlock Holmes mystery to relax). \nElder Motivations \nAh, that Deceit should steal such gentle shape \n-William \nShakespeare, Richard III \nWhat keeps you going? What are you here to accomplish? Elder \ncharacters require strong motives and desires to be believable. This is \nnot to say that your character’s motivation must be transparent - \nindeed, your character’s desires and goals should remain concealed \nuntil such time as you choose to reveal them. Many (if not most) of \nyour character’s actions will be dictated by her core motivations, and \nAnd with a virtuous vizor hide deep Vice! \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nflimsy motives will make even the best concept look unrealistic. After \ncreating the bare bones of your character, turn your attention to \ndeveloping and defining those impulses which will govern your \ncharacter’s interactions through the story. \nSecurity -Though \nyou embody vast powers and knowledge, \nyou are by no means omnipotent or invulnerable; you will often find \nyourself caught between the hammer and the anvil. To one side are the \nMethuselahs, and perhaps the mysterious and terrifying Antediluvians. \nElders are the pawns of choice for both groups in their eternal Jyhad. \nThose elders who are not already controlled by Methuselahs or \nAntediluvians continually struggle to avoid the same fate. Whenever \nyou meet another elder, you must consider who might have their \nfingers on his strings. To the other side wait the energetic younger \nKindred, ever ready to usurp their elders’ authority and embarrass \nthem by wrecking the most carefully laid plans. Worse than this, \nhowever, is the terrifying prospect of the fledglings who may hunt you \nfor the purpose of claiming your power as their own. Small wonder, \nthen, that many elders spend their nights motivated by a desire to \nensure their own safety amid the dangers and upheavals which \nsurround them. \nStatus -Elders, whether Sabbat paladins or Camarilla primogen, \nenjoy a certain elevated status among their chosen societies. Within the \nCamarilla, status is essential for the security and continued functioning \nof the sect, and is thus of paramount importance to many Kindred. \nIndeed, for some elders status and its reward are all that truly matters to \nthem. Elders crave the deference of the power-hungry ancillae, the \nreverence of the neonates and the respect of their peers. Many go to great \nlengths in pursuit of additional status, and even greater lengths to \nmaintain that which they already possess, buying and trading Status \nTraits as if they were the most precious commodities on Earth. Rival \nelders continually seek to diminish each other’s status, and may even \nwage subtle wars with status as the spoils of victory. \nStatus loses none of its importance in the Sabbat, although it is \nbased on characteristics quite different from those found in its rival \nsect. Likewise, status among Sabbat Kindred may often be utilized for \nother, unexpected purposes. Because status within the Sabbat is so \neasily gained and lost, more than a few Sabbat elders are continually \nconscious of their current status and eagerly pursue more as a means of \ncontrolling younger vampires and avoiding time-wasting challenges \nto their authority. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPolitical Power- It has been observed that power is a drug, that \nits taste is sweeter even than the most quenching blood. Elders are as \naccustomed to holding positions of temporal power as they are to \ngaining status, but for some the pursuit of the former is far more \nexhilarating and meaningful than chasing the latter (some may \nperceive power and status to be one and the same, but it is quite \npossible to have one without the other). Once an elder painstakingly \nclaws her way up the ladder of Kindred society to reach the upper \nechelons, she will be more than reluctant to relinquish her success to \nthe vampires occupying the rungs below. In fact, she will fight with all \nthe viciousness she can command to maintain her place, for power \nallows a vampire to gain control over her immediate surroundings. \nThis need to control their environment bums in the minds of many \nelders, motivating them to engage in mind-bending intrigues to \nachieve or maintain their authority. \nPower is a dangerous goal, however, for you will find it necessary to \nutilize questionable means to attain it. Advancing your personal agenda \nmay require blackmail, threats, bribes and other tools of subversion. \nPolitics are, by their very nature, a public pursuit; it can become difficult \nto conceal your machinations from prying eyes. If you begin to reach \nyour goal, this draws rivals and others bent on usurping your hard-won \nauthority. Conflicts with rivals and equally power-hungry ancillae \nintent on claiming the same prize make this motivation challenging to \nplay, although many who seek power say that such challenges merely \nmake the goal all the more satisfying once it is attained. \nGolconda -While the elders who actively seek this fabled state \nof inner equilibrium are rare, such Kindred do exist. The outward actions \nand appearances of an elder who navigates the uncertain waters that \nlead to atonement may not appear any different from those of the elder \nmotivated by more commongoals. She strives to gain a tangible measure \nof mastery over the Beast, to deny its continual demands in order to gain \nsome degree of acceptance of her own vampiric nature. This motivation \nis highly personal, and manifests itself in asomewhat more subtle fashion \nthan others, for it is only through interactions with others of her own \nkind that the character understands herself enough to satisfy the \nrigorous demands of this path. \nAn interesting variation on this motivation is the elder who has \nalready attained Golconda and who wishes to share the gift with his \nfellow Kindred. Such a motivation, while laudable, is fraught with \nhardship and peril, for he is once again plunged into the thick of the \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nhorror from which he recoiled. In demonstrating his sincerity, he may \nwell find himself tempted by the very acts and passions which first set \nhim on this path. If he is to convince anyone else of the possibility of \nredemption, though, he must not only face his inner demons but \nprevail against them again. \nReturn to Yesteryear - \nThe selfsame conditions that bring \nabout elders’ desire to exert excessive control may manifest themselves \nin the wish to return to the familiar customs and habits of long-dead \nages. Some examples include the Brujah elder who gives herself \ncompletely over to her dream of transforming her chosen domain into \nthe reincarnation of ancient Carthage, or the Tzimisce whose wish is \nto rule once again a kingdom as an omnipotent warlord as he did in the \nCarpathians three centuries past. Yearning to recreate the imagined \nglories of the past may motivate the elder to proclaim her goals publicly \nand recruit followers who listen to her tales of a better time. The elder \nmay also try to manipulate events around her to reflect the world she \nenjoyed in nights gone by. \nRevenge - \nUnusual indeed is the elder who has not wronged \nand been wronged by another of her kind during her eternal existence. \nThe events that light and fan the fires of vengeance are legion, and in \nmany cases your search for retribution may seem right in your eyes. \nPerhaps a rival elder’s plan to embarrass you in front of her peers cost \nyou the seat on a primogen council, or another Kindred wounded you \nand left you for dead. Maybe a pack of anarchs slew your sire or childe, \nor your packmates betrayed you rather than risk capture when a Sabbat \nraid went awry. You should have no difficulty creating an appropri- \nately gruesome or horrific deed that left a memory gnawing at your gut \nevery night of your unlife. Forever is a long time to nurse a grudge, and \nthe desire for vengeance can be so strong that it will not do simply to \nmurder the object of your hatred once you find him. It is often far more \nsatisfying to plan an elaborate act of revenge in which your target is \nfully aware of his humiliation and its source. \nRomance - \nWhile it is true that many elders’ emotions have \nwaned over the long night, it is still possible for an elder to feel the \ndizzying intoxication of passion for another Kindred, or even for a \nfavored ghoul or mortal. The sudden blossoming of such love could be \na complete surprise to your elder, and he may struggle against it, trying \nto deny the upheaval of his plans and his carefully ordered existence. \nDepending on your selected Nature and Demeanor, the pursuit of a \nromantic goal can manifest itself in any number of ways. Perhaps you \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nbecome infatuated with a mortal from among your many Influences \nwho reminds you of a past lover. It may be that you and another \ncharacter in the chronicle once shared a passion which has cooled over \nthe centuries, and which you now wish to rekindle. Unrequited love \ncan be among the most powerful of romantic motivations - \nattempt- \ning to prove your worth to a lover who spurns or ignores you is an \nintriguing alternative to the usual romantic entanglements. What if \nthe lover in question is a younger Kindred or mortal trying desperately \nto win your favor? Because of the power differences between elders and \nother characters, and because of the very nature of live-action roleplay, \nbe certain to establish the bounds of the romantic plotline with the \nplayer(s) who are participating in it with you. \nInsanity - The crushing weight of the years, the growing \nisolation from the mortal world, the unending attacks on your power, \nthe slow retreat from your own humanity- these elements of life as an \nelder can drive you into the arms of insanity as surely as the most violent \nor sudden trauma. Maybe your character acquired several Beast Traits or \nDerangements which cause her to act in an increasingly unpredictable \nand dangerous manner. Perhaps she simply can’t cope with immortality \nany longer and harbors a secret wish for her own destruction. \nNote: Insanity does not give you license to act without thinking. \nWhile your actions may appear to observers to be completely random, \nirrational or inexplicable, make certain that your madness has method in \nit. Otherwise it becomes aparodyof itself, adisjointedseries ofnonsensical \nravings or wildly inappropriate scenes that diminish the game’s enjoyment \nfor everyone. An insane person- particularly an insane elder- operates \naccording to an established internal logic. While your motivations will \nnot be understood by those around you, they should be consistent with the \naltered point of view brought on by your madness. \nEffective Roleplaying \nThe fire which seem out often sleeps beneath the cinders. \n- \nPierre Coneille \nYour role as an elder has many facets. Your character embodies the \nancient authority older Kindred wield over the younger, and therefore \nwill be asked (or pressured) to participate in the ongoing interactions \nbetween the various strata of vampire society. It is important to \nunderstand how your character will likely relate to the various factions \nwhich also inhabit the night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nI \nPuttin’ On the Ritz \nSilk or leather? Etruscan or Mod? Having seen (and occasion- \nally played) the fashion game, most elders are jaded to the notion \nof clothes and fashion. As long as it covers the body, many couldn’t \ncare less what they’re actually wearing. In the case of some (such as \nthe Lasombra), the matter of appearance is immensely important, \nalways uppermost in many \nthe part. Everyone wants \nplayers) are no different. \nittle help. When the Brujah \na regular basis, or the \nto look his best, an \nstep out in style.

You \nmight have consideredVictorian for your elder, but you’re not ready \nto start corseting. On the other hand, the soft lines of the gowns of \nthe 1930s, complete with gloves and a little hat, are appealing and \nmore comfortable-looking. Your Ventrue elder was active in Lon- \ndon, then, a society maven - \nand like that, you have a potential \nidea for something much different from the usual ruck and run of \nVictorian and 18th centurv fashions. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nI Obviously, the Masquerade should be a consideration. Let’s I \nsay your Brujah elder was Embraced during the era of Socrates and \nPlato, and finds Greekrobes to be the most comfortable thing he’s \never wom in the past 2000-plus years. A man wandering down \nthe streets at night wearing a chiton and sandals is bound to \nattract attention, some of which will certainly be undesirable. \nAnd how many times wouldyozt want to be asked if you’re in a \nplay? You might want t \nfor wearing around the \nelder’s person, consider so \nall, like a ring with a \nGrecian key design or a tie \norations from an urn. \nThey say that clothes \n, and certainly clothes \ncarry connotations abou \ner, however uninten- \nfind himself viewed a \ndering one at that, \nexpect elders to look \nunlikely to gamer re \non dressing like an I \nwho tries too hard \nbe above that sort \ndvise them on the \ne first stop of anyone \n, cared for well, will \nEven small acces- \ncases and the like \nVintage clothing sto \nsearching for an elder’ \nlast you through man \nsories, like gloves, ha \n- \ncan bring an outfit (and character) to life. For snappy modem \ndressing, check out resale shops in vour area, particularly those \nthat advertise “gently used” garments. Many times, these places \ncarry outfits barely out of season, and certainly not out of style. \nIf you have friends who sew and construct costumes, consider \noffering yourself as a guinea pig. Couture offers them the chance to \nexperiment with fabrics and styles, and when it’s done, you have an \noutfit that’s completely different from anything else that will show \nup at Elysium. It can also provide some great plot threads about \nwhere vour character pets her clothes done. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMaintaining the Status Quo \nElders have a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, \nwhatever the circumstances of their individual situations may be. It \nwould be absurd to think that you would allow your hard-won status, \npower and authority to be snatched from your hands by overeager, \nundeserving upstarts of weaker generations. No prince casually \nsurrenders the throne to an ambitious ancilla; no elder willingly \nturns over her primogen seat to an impetuous fledgling. This is the \nparadox of Kindred existence - the constant ambition of the \nneonates and ancillae to achieve the same rewards as the elders, \njuxtaposed with the elders’ desperate measures to thwart these \nattempts at any cost. \nYou will probably find it beneficial to your elder existence to resist \nsudden or drastic change in the status quo, unless such nontraditional \nbehavior clearly benefits your position. Greet sweeping proposals for \nsocial reform as but one step removed from anarchy. React to suggested \nbusiness improvements with barely concealed disinterest, promising \nto review the plans as soon as your busy schedule permits. Stamp out \nthe anarch threat wherever and whenever it may be found, for the \ndissatisfied grumblings of youth soon turn to the scorching flame of \nrebellion. Above all, instill in the younger, less experienced Kindred \na mortal fear of the enemy, whether it be Camarilla or Sabbat. Point \nout that this hated foe’s victory would be all but assured if the elders \nwere to fail in their unceasing vigilance, and that the city would have \nfallen for certain were it not for your own tireless efforts against the \nadversary. \nDealing with Kindred Society \nSome players view elder characters simply as a means of crushing \nall who cross their paths during a game. They leave a trail of mangled \ncharacters behind them, and turn even more viciously on any charac- \nter who dares admonish them. Such a player should expect to be \nshunned by the rest, or even expelled from the chronicle, and deserv- \nedly so. While violence is part and parcel of the World of Darkness, \nhabitually behaving in this manner simply to gain attention or to \ndisrupt the game shows a lack of the maturity necssary for playing a \npowerful character. Elevating the story above the pitfalls of mindless \nviolence is the equal responsibility of every player, but particularly \nthose who portray elders, since they have the capacity to inflict the \nmost damage with the least amount of effort. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAs an elder, you should be willing to help guide the game in the \ndirection that is most entertaining for everyone, not just yourself. Your \nStoryteller trusts you with the potential to help make or break the \ngame, and in a way trusts you with a measure of responsibility for the \ngame. This is not to say that you must perpetually sacrifice your own \nenjoyment, but rather that you should be equally aware of your fellow \nplayers’ needs alongside your own. \nHow, then, should you deal with those Kindred who lack your age \nand capabilities? What do you say to the neonate who insults you at the \nprince’s court, or do to the ancilla who ruins plans that took years to \nlay? Wise elders master their immediate impulse to destroy the \noffender, and instead embark upon a time-honored campaign for the \nloyalties, hearts and minds of their detractors and supporters alike. \nMost chronicles will feature some degree of stratification be- \ntween character power levels. A few characters will probably be \nelders, and thus relatively more powerful in terms of resources and \ncapabilities. The majority of characters will probably be ancillae and \nneonates, the rank and file of the Kindred world. In this type of game, \nsuccessful elder characters work to improve their individual power \nbases, without calling undue attention to themselves. You did not \nsurvive to become an elder, after all, by stepping boldly to the front \nevery time danger threatened and volunteers were requested. You, as \nan elder, should not want to pursue every plot thread or story line that \ncomes your way. Instead, encourage your more “youthful” allies, \nassociates and subordinates to investigate the strange occurrences, \nunusual circumstances and mysterious happenings while you remain \n“behind the lines” to direct the action. \nInteracting with Neonates \nSome elders make the mistake of viewing neonates as little more \nthan flunkies, beasts of burden, slaves or scapegoats. These elders, \nsecure in the belief that their elevated status will protect them from \nreprisal from the weaker strata of vampire society, don’t feel they need \nto bother with neonates. Nothing could be further from the truth. A \nsingle neonate equipped with knowledge and training is worth twice \nthe value of the most loyal ghoul retainer or mortal servant. Several \nneonates who decide to combine forces are sometimes quite capable of \ntaking down a single elder. \nNeonates who reject the status quo are exceedingly dangerous \n- \ncall attention to the threat they represent at every opportunity. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRebellious Camarilla neonates sometimes flee the sect and form \nanarch packs, dedicated to insurrection and destruction of the \nelders’ precious status quo. Worse, they may be recruited by the \nSabbat and turned into weapons pointed directly at the Camarilla’s \nheart. Sabbat neonates who break free of their elders’ control are \nno longer useful tools to be used against the hated Camarilla. At \nbest they wander without direction; at worst they might join the \nenemy. For these reasons it is vital that you, as a prudent elder, treat \nneonates not as chattel but as a valuable resource. Unless you want \nthem to start preaching against the established order- and against \nyou as its defender - \nconsider them as the building blocks of your \nown power base. \nBefriending neonates is an excellent in-game method of simul- \ntaneously fostering character interaction and supporting elder \ninvolvement in the story. You will find it more than worth your \ninvestment in time and energy to recruit a network of less powerful \ncharacters who will do your bidding (voluntarily or otherwise), \nleaving you free to pursue more genteel diversions. If you are even \nmarginally successful in recruiting associates and helpers across \nclan lines, so much the better, for your power base will be that much \nmore enhanced. \nOnce established, your neonate support system is not necessar- \nily secure. You will almost certainly find yourself competing with \nother elders, and sometimes ancillae, for control of this precious \nresource. Rival Kindred are quite capable of utilizing methods \nsimilar to those you initially employed to gain the neonates’ \nassistance. Do you regularly use shouted threats and beatings to \ninstill fear and respect in your neonate followers? You can be \ncertain that the other elders of the city know about it, and are \nwhispering into the neonate’s ear when you’re out of earshot. \nWatch for elder manipulators who attempt to sow dissent within \nthe ranks of your helpers and associates. If you fail to guard your \nyoung followers jealously against poachers, defections will become \ncommonplace. Consider the system of rewards and punishments \nyou use to retain neonate loyalty. Too much or too little of either \none erodes your power base as surely as a rival’s blandishments. \nNeonates perform a plethora of vital functions for their elders. \nThey make effective bodyguards when you travel, or guard your \nhaven while you attend to business. Neonates can also be your eyes \nand ears when you need to be in two places at once. A primogen \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nmeeting may command the bulk of your attention on a given night, \nbut your young spies can keep tabs on the Gangrel who started \nsniffing around your newly constructed chemical plant, reporting to \nyou later on her movements and conversations. \nPerhaps most importantly, neonates are capable of understand- \ning the modern world more readily than you are. Face it, you are the \nproduct of a bygone era, and in spite of your age and power, you may \nneed assistance in dealing with modern technology and customs. \nComputer systems, for example, are sufficiently difficult for con- \ntemporary mortals to understand and utilize effectively. To a \nvampire whose last intimate contact with technology was with the \ntelegraph, flintlock rifle or aqueduct, such machines may prove \nincomprehensible. Neonates whose mortal lives were contempo- \nrary with these devices can be invaluable for helping you harness \nthis technology for your own benefit. Those with computer exper- \ntise can help you decimate a rival’s economic empire, search for \ninformation or spread rumors and innuendo throughout an entirely \nnew medium. \nInteracting with Ancillae \nThis “middle class” within vampire society is at once indispens- \nably useful and exceedingly dangerous. If the ancillae could be \nbothered to set aside their own selfish pursuits and internecine \nsquabbling, they would be a force to be reckoned with, one which \ncould conceivably challenge the elders’ iron grip on the night. \nMany elders live in fear of this potential usurpation, and maintain \nconstant vigilance against it. Dealing with ancillae can prove \ncostly if you misjudge or anger them. At the same time, you cannot \nafford to show unnecessary weakness or incompetence, lest you \ninspire the ancillae to unseat you. \nIf the neonates are the foundation of your power base, then the \nancillae are the mortar which holds the stones together. A capable \nancilla can perform many useful functions, such as acting as a \nmediator between you and the neonates you wish to recruit to your \nside, or as a troubleshooter to alert you when your plans are going \nastray. Ancillae also make excellent advisors and lieutenants, ad- \nministering your holdings or businesses on your behalf and informing \nyou of important developments within your fields of interests. \nYou must beware your subordinates’ ambitions, however. Make \nno mistake - \nthe ancilla to whom you entrust your most secret \n. \n~ \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nII \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nneed to determine the correct balance between reward and punish- \nment to keep the ancillae in line and on your side. If you reward \nthem with too much too often, they will come to expect your \ngratitude even when they haven’t earned it. If you reward them \nwith too little or too seldom, they will grow resentful at your \ningratitude and be easy targets for rivals. \nEstablishing Alliances \nHow, then, can the neonates and ancillae be drawn as moths to \nyour flame? \nGoodwill - \nFew tactics surpass good manners in impressing \nyour associates. Simply behaving courteously toward the younger \ngenerations can often establish you as an elder who values them \nand their contributions. If your Nature and Demeanor permit, try \npraising the young Ventrue who greets you in a respectful manner, \nor complimenting the Toreador ingenue on her new frock. Such \nsmall gestures cost you very little, and can reap an impressive return \nin your future dealings with the young ones. Neonates and ancillae \nwhom you take care to compliment may find your later overtures of \nalliance more believable and palatable. If you are fortunate, your \nevident goodwill may even induce a younger Kindred to reject a \nrequest made by one of your rivals to do you harm. It’s sometimes \nequally useful to point out the discourtesy shown by other, less \nsensitive elders to the younger Kindred. If a situation should occur \nwherein both you or the unmannered elder both desire the neonate’s \nservices, whom do you think the young vampire will be more likely \nto consider? Occasional small gifts of information, advice, con- \nstructive criticism and perhaps even Status can also do wonders to \nset you apart from the elders who believe that the best way to treat \nneonates and ancillae is with the tip of their boot. \nBlackmail - \nWhere goodwill sometimes fails, blackmail may \nsometimes succeed. Perhaps a headstrong childe rebuffed your friendly \novertures? No matter - \nall Kindred hide secrets, and few wish their \nweak spots revealed. Perhaps the Gangrel’s sire didn’t abandon her \nafter all, but rather fell victim to his progeny’s appetites? Perhaps the \nVentrue whip would not care to have his rather obscure feeding \nhabits bandied about the prince’s court for the amusement of others? \nThreats ofexposure are best when made subtly, but you must bait this \nhook well - \nif your price for silence is too high, you may well become \nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\n. - .  \n112 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nyou ask is within your target’s ability to give. You cannot obtain a \nvast fortune from an impoverished childe, after all. \nThreats - \nElders who are skilled in making threats find that \nimplied consequences are better than those stated explicitly. Bla- \ntant warnings of imminent harm seldom do more than earn your \ntarget’s temporary cooperation, followed by her long-term enmity. \nMost threats are more effective in the short term, and often the \nsame threat does not work twice. There are some excellent ex- \namples of long-term threats, however, such as blackmail (see \nabove) or warnings of serious injury to those beloved by your target. \nNeonates may respond more readily than ancillae to threats of \nphysical violence, although sometimes just the hint of inconve- \nnience can be sufficient to forge a brief alliance. Beware whom you \nthreaten, however, as you will not be the only elder practicing such \ntechniques. Threatening ancillae or neonates whom you know to \nbe strongly supported by other elders is an invitation to disaster. \nChoose both your threat and threatened with care. \nBlood Bond - \nBe wary of using the Blood Bond indiscrimi- \nnately, particularly on those Kindred who are not your own progeny. \nIf you try to create an army of Blood Bound servitors, other elders in \nthe vicinity will almost certainly try to prevent it, before it upsets the \nbalance of power. They may even decide to unite against you, which \ncould prove disastrous. If you choose to employ the Bond as a means \nof influencing a younger Kindred, consider keeping the attachment a \nsecret. Your enemies may trust your Thrall more readily if they are \nunaware that you are her Regnant. \nLies - \nNo one ever said that you must always tell the truth \nwhen dealing with younger Kindred (indeed, some neonates and \nancillae would claim that the reverse is usually true). The kind of \nresponse you can provoke with a judicious lie can be both surprising \nand gratifying. Perhaps a certain Brujah is burning for revenge on the \nunknown assassin who murdered his sire. Should you hint that you \nknow, or can somehow determine, the killer’s identity, you may earn \nthe childe’s services. Is your packmate willing to do anything to \nplease the pack leader? Consider letting it “slip” that you know the \nway to win her approval, and will gladly reveal it in exchange for a \nsmall favor. If your falsehood is exposed, discovered by your target or \nrevealed by a rival, it’s best to conceal it with more lies in order to \navoid the consequences of revealing the truth. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nInteracting with Elders \nSome of the most dynamic moments in any chronicle arise from \nthe interactions between elders. These vampiric peers circle one \nanother like wary gladiators, seeking their opponent’s weak spots \nwhile striving not to reveal any of their own. Elders do assist one \nanother, but such aid almost always carries a price which must be paid \nin full before or immediately after services are rendered. Thus the \ngames of one-upmanship are played out against the backdrop of elder \ninteraction, with each player jockeying to place herself in a position \nto bestow favors and demand the appropriate gratitude in return. \nIt’s a good idea to be respectful of other elders, at least in public. \nWhile it’s sometimes difficult to conceal your contempt for a sneering \nrival or a member of an opposed clan, hurling insults rarely accom- \nplishes anything beyond antagonizing the target of your scorn. Likewise, \nattacking other elders is almost always a bad idea. Would you really \nwant to go toe-to-toe with someone as old and powerful as yourself? \nUnless you are purposefully trying to goad your fellow elder into a \nresponse, it is usually wisest to keep a civil tongue in your head. \nOther elders can be your closest allies or your most dreaded \nenemies. They often want the same things you want, and are as well- \nversed as you in the art of obtaining what they wish. They are in \ncompetition with you for the scarce resources of the World of Dark- \nness, such as the services of neonates and ancillae. They will strive to \nacquire the same advantages you desire, not least among them mortal \nvessels and Influence, and it is from this competition that many of the \nfiercest and most long-standing elder feuds are created. Tread lightly \namong your fellow ancients. \nAvoiding Unnecessary \nViolence \nConsider a typical night at the prince’s court. You prepare hours in \nadvance, dressing in your most expensive finery, choosing just the right \ntie to win approving glances from the Harpies, and taking the time to \nmake certain your appearance is as perfect as money can buy. You are \nconfident that your plan to cement an alliance with the Toreador elder \nwill reach fruition this evening. You arrive in your new luxury car, your \ndriver smart and efficient, and make your grand entrance through the \nwide mahogany doors into the vast reception hall.. .only to collide with \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nanother Kindred carrying a pair of goblets overflowing with vitae, which \nnow forms indelible stains on your clothing for all to see. Because you are \nan elder no one laughs openly, but you can hear the undercurrent of \namusement pass through the gathering like an electric shock. Taking \nyour eyes from your ruined clothing, you gaze upon the face of your \ndestroyer, anewly Embraced neonate of the Brujah clan. Rage takes root \nin your heart and pulsates quickly to the roof of your mouth, flame-hot \nas the Beast screams in your mind that you must be allowed the sight of \nthis childe’s blood on your hands. The neonate stares in mute horror at \nyour clothes, then at the expression of white-hot anger on your face. \nYour eyes flick momentarily to the gathered crowd, and you see the \nToreador elder smiling wryly as she shakes her head at your misfortune, \nthen turns to whisper into the ear of one of the Harpies.. . . \nWhat Do You Do Now? \nA - \nKill the offending Brujah neonate without mercy or hesita- \ntion! You are an elder, after all, and are entitled to respect from whelps \nlike him. The insult is unforgivable, and may well have been planned, \na calculated “accident” to embarrass you and forestall your alliance \nwith the Toreador. A swift death for this childe will serve as an object \nlesson for any other Kindred who seeks to make you play the fool! \nB - \nReprimand the unwise childe with a scathing, public tongue- \nlashing, then spend the next three months plotting his grisly death. \nYour vengeance will be delicious, no less than the complete dismem- \nberment of this upstart pup, who will only at the moment of his Final \nDeath suddenly recognize you as the engineer of his demise. You can \nsavor his death screams already! \nC - \nBegin a campaign to glean as many reparations as possible \nfrom the Brujah clan in payment for this unfortunate accident. You \nwill play the proud but injured party and demand that the Brujah \nprimogen punish the neonate for this transgression, but will recom- \nmend leniency - \nafter all, you want the childe alive so that his fear \nof your eventual reprisal will haunt him each morning when he sleeps. \nYou could kill him any time, but making his life miserable with anxiety \nis far more satisfying. What’s more, you’ll use this encounter as proof \nfor the Toreador elder that the Brujah are too uncivilized to stand in \nthe way of your alliance. \nIf you answered: \nA - \nPlease report to the nearest medical facility for your lo- \nbotomy. It’s better this way, honest. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nundoing. \nC - \nCongratulations! You are among the superior elders! You \nhave realized that violence should be applied in the game like a \nsurgical instrument - \nwith precision and skillful direction, and \ncertainly not as a first resort. \nThis example is not meant to suggest that it is never appropriate \nfor an elder to use violence against a neonate or an ancilla. There may \nbe circumstances in which such an outcome is unavoidable, and may \neven support the story. Death should always remain a very real threat \nin the game, otherwise there is little to prevent characters from \nrunning completely amuck. In many cases, however, you may find it \nmore effective to conserve your energy, saving your strength in \npreparation for combating more deadly foes, such as other elders. \nRash acts of murder often lead to unpleasant consequences. If your \nvictim was prominent among her clan, for example, her death may \nlead to interclan war. Such outcomes are undesirable, for they often \nderail an entire chronicle and require drastic manhandling from the \nStoryteller to put the story back on track. Engaging in combat too \nfrequently also attracts unwanted attention from the prince, his sheriff \nand sometimes the archons, a fate most wise elders avoid. Elders who \ncannot control their violent impulses may be judged a danger to the \nTraditions, giving a prince the necessary excuse to call a Blood Hunt \nor request assistance from a Justicar. Frequent, overt violence can also \nlead to inadvertent breaches of the Masquerade, which no Kindred \ncan afford to take lightly. Habitually violent Kindred often find \nthemselves ostracized from Kindred society, and may find it difficult to \nretain their status and influence. If you are the type of player who \nengages in numerous Physical Challenges for the sheer enjoyment of \nbeating up on other characters, it might be best if you found another \npastime before any of these unfortunate occurrences befall your \ncharacter. \nIt is worth bearing in mind that the elders are more acutely aware \nof the dangers of violating the First Tradition than some of their young \ncousins. Some elders remember the nights of terror dominated by the \nInquisition, when the mortal world turned against them and dragged \nso many of them screaming into the sunlight or burned them beside \nheretics and elderly widows in the witch-fires. These memories, and \nthe dread of such circumstances once again coming to pass, give many \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nelders a healthy aversion to rash brutality. Too much impulsive \nviolence escalates into pitched battles which in turn threaten or even \nviolate the Masquerade, and for this reason many elders use violent \nmeans only as a last resort. \nThere are effective, nonlethal solutions to almost any situation \nwhich might arise over the course of a chronicle, and most of these \nreprisals fully support the volatile, dangerous nature of the World of \nDarkness. Acts of vengeance which allow your victim to survive are \noften preferable to the more final variety for one simple reason- the \nobject of your revenge remains alive for future retribution and abuse. \nWhy destroy the Toreador who seduced your favorite ghoul when \nyou could inflict a humbling, nonlethal lesson on her, leaving her \naround for more reprisals in the nights to come? Choosing to end all \nconflicts by killing one’s enemies is shortsighted, and a hallmark of \nthe problem player. \nShould you find yourself wronged, offended or slighted in some \nmaterial way by another Kindred, you may wish to consider approach- \ning the offender’s sire or primogen and discussing the manner in which \nhe could make reparations for your inconvenience. In some Camarilla- \ncontrolled cities, the primogen are at least somewhat accountable for \nthe actions of their respective clans, and are frequently responsible for \nkeeping their more “enthusiastic” brethren in line. \nBe open to Prestation, and you may find yourself the recipient of \na valuable boon in exchange for your willingness to overlook an \nunfortunate incident. This type of reparation is most common when \nthe offense and apology are committed and made in public. Rather \nthan destroying a rude neonate for insulting you before the primogen, \nconsider instead the value of forgiving the offense in favor of exacting \na promise of future aid from the whelp’s embarrassed sire. Publicly \nforgive the rash act and accept the boon in private; you will appear \nmagnanimous and genteel, rather than a vain and pompous bully. \nDon’t be greedy - \naccept a Boon commensurate with the offense. It \nwill make you look foolish to demand a Life Boon for overlooking a \nrelatively minor transgression. If an expected offer of Prestation is not \nforthcoming, don’t make an issue of it, but later in the evening you may \nwant to make “casual” mention to the Harpy about the shocking lack \nof manners exhibited both by the neonate and her sire. \nSometimes a Kindred who has wronged you will be eager to \nmake up for her actions in order to avert your wrath, but will be \nanxious to avoid any public acknowledgment. You are an elder, \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nafter all, and your displeasure cannot be taken lightly. By simply \nacting annoyed and perhaps angered with the transgressor, you may \nelicit the offer of something valuable to soothe your ruffled feathers \n- \nthe loan of useful Influence, for example, or perhaps an offer to \nteach you a new Discipline. Some elders are not above accepting \ncash, information or other valuable commodities in return for not \npressing a delicate matter. \nHow to Get the Most Out of Your Elder \nI do not despair in the least of ultimate triumph. I repeat it with intense \n- \nEmile Zola \nYou will soon discover that the game itself seldom makes it \nnecessary to resort to something as blatant as outright violence to \nsecure your desires. The Masquerade contains a number of subtle \nmethods for gaining the upper hand through roleplaying, which is \nalmost always the most satisfying means. Two of the most effective \ngame components in facilitating the triumph of subtlety over \nviolence are Influence and Prestation. \nconviction. \nInfluence: Mortal Allies \nThe elder who masters an Influence in her city or region gains \nan impressive resource on which to draw in her efforts to secure \nher station and thwart those who would usurp it. Elders may rule \nthe night and hold sway over the activities of the Kindred, but the \nmortal world hums on unceasingly around them. While elders \nsleep, their mortal retainers and allies are alert and mobile, \nguarding their master’s interests and carrying out her wishes. \nMastery of an Influence can offer you a considerable advantage \nin your nightly business. \nYour elder character may, at your Storyteller’s discretion, begin \nthe game with a number of Influence Traits in excess of the normal \nthree most characters obtain at the time of their creation. If so, you \nmust decide whether to concentrate on dominating just one or two \nareas of Influence, or to spread your Traits as widely as possible in \norder to obtain access to many different facets of mortal society. If \nyour Ventrue elder begins the game with five Influence Traits, for \nexample, you might decide to invest all five in the Finance Influence, \nin addition to the one free Finance Influence Trait all Ventrue gain \nat character creation, giving you six Traits of Finance Influence and \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nundisputed dominance of the economic life of your city. You could \neasily be alerted to almost all Kindred financial ventures, and may be \nable to block them as well. Certainly it puts you in a position to \nextract favors when Kindred who lack your financial acumen wish to \nventure into “your” realm. \nYou might, however, decide to assign three Influences Traits to \nthe Finance Influence, two to Bureaucracy and one to Industry. You \nwould then have a more diverse power base, making it less likely that \nany crippling blow to any single Influence under your sway would \ndamage you permanently. Moreover, you gain information from a \nwider array of sources, and if you find it necessary to trade Influences \nwith other Kindred, possessing a variety of Traits often makes such \ndeals easier to complete. Ultimately, your own sense of your character’s \nNature and your interpretation of her motivations will determine \nhow you choose to spread your Influences. \nInfluence Traits can be used to great effect within the scope of \nan ongoing chronicle. They are one of the most potent weapons in \nany vampire’s arsenal, often far more sure and lethal than the claw \nor gun. If your Storyteller does not already have you reporting your \nmonthly Influence activity, start indicating exactly what your Influ- \nences are working on between games. It is possible to inconvenience \nor even crush an enemy thoroughly through prolonged, concen- \ntrated use of Influences, and the end result can be far more satisfying \nthan a crude bloodletting. The shrewd use and trading of Influences \ncan gain you an enormous amount of prestige for your subtlety. \nControl of the Police Influence, for example, can enable you \nto wreak havoc on your enemies. You can order their havens \ndisturbed during daylight hours, or have their own Influences \narrested and detained for questioning. The police can cordon off \nbuildings and streets while you tend to your business undisturbed, \nand they can allow you to ensure that certain pieces of incrimi- \nnating evidence collected from crime scenes simply vanish into \nthe night air. Equally useful is the Industry Influence. Is your rival \na shipping magnate who prides himself on his access to container \nships? A prolonged strike among the longshoremen, dock laborers \nor even tugboat pilots can cripple his business and deprive him of \nincome. Likewise, an artificial shortage of vital resources like ore \nor chemicals can make life miserable for those Kindred with \nmanufacturing interests. Criminal harassment instigated through \nthe Underworld Influence can make it nearly impossible for other \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nKindred to do business, while the ability to seize control of City \nHall via Politics can bring other vampires crawling to you when \nthey need help in passing a city ordinance or dealing with \nbureaucratic red tape. \nIn addition to inflicting harm, your Influence Traits can be used \nto gather vital information which enables you to remain one step \nahead of the rest of the pack. They may be utilized to lend support to \nyour allies in time of need (in return for later favors, of course). Such \ncategories as Street, Health and University can prove invaluable in \nfinding out exactly what is happening in your local area, or in \nobtaining such valuable resources as vitae and cash when supplies are \nlow. Wise selection of Influences can offer you a safe emergency \nhaven when your plans go wrong, and easy access to vessels when \nother methods of hunting are not viable. \nPrestation \nThe millennia-honored game of Prestation is one of your \nmost potent means of safeguarding the ultimate success of your \nplans. It is no overstatement to say that learning to understand \nand appreciate Prestation fully may mean the difference between \ngaining authority among the Kindred and falling under the heel \nof your rivals. \nThe most basic lesson in Prestation is “Nobody gets nothing for \nfree.” Did you supply the sheriff with a tip on where she could \napprehend the anarchs who have been smuggling guns into the \ncity? Did you permit the prince’s favorite childe safe passage \nthrough your network of sewers? Did you endanger your own safety \nby stepping in to protect the Toreador primogen from the Assamite’s \nnear-fatal blow? In all cases, you are within your rights to politely \nremind the other party that it is customary to return such favors in \nkind, and since you have no immediate need of a similar service, \nyou would be pleased to accept a Boon as a token of appreciation. \nRemembering that every favor, however small, is probably worth \nsomething to somebody can help you build an impressive library of \nBoons. Even a collection of minor Boons bestowed upon you by \nKindred of lesser station or age can be valuable, especially when \nyou consider that they can be traded (exactly like Influences) to \nother Kindred in return for other favors and aid. \nPrestation is a game of subtlety, however. Strive to avoid \ngiving those in your debt the opportunity to repay you. A Boon \nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\nu\n.\n.\n \n120 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBoon, though - \nsome Kindred may attempt to force the issue by \narranging circumstances so that you will have little choice but to \nallow them to repay the debt. Others may even go so far as to \nattempt to remove the inconvenience the Boon represents by \ntrying to place you in their debt, or even trying to eliminate the \nBoon by eliminating the one who holds it. Be certain to alert the \nHarpies, prince or other authority figures if a vampire in your debt \nreneges on or ignores a Boon rightfully owed to you. This kind of \npressure can be nearly as effective in embarrassing or controlling \nyour rivals as possession of the Boon itself. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWorking with elder characters is a challenge. Plots and subplots \ncan spin off in unexpected directions. One moment the plot is moving \nalong and your players are enjoying themselves. In the next moment, \nthe game’s setting is in flames, the Masquerade is completely blown, \nand the natives are restless. The game is out of control, and it’s up to \nyou to get it back on track. \nThis chapter contains essential information for Storytellers who \nwish to run chronicles and independent stories involving elders. The \ntechniques and pitfalls of the all-elder chronicle are discussed in \ndepth. This chapter will also help you troubleshoot elder-created and \nelder-associated problems, and offers advice on repairing a derailed \nplot. Following this are ideas and methods for integrating elders into \nyour regular chronicle. Finally, there is information on how to guide \nyour players as their characters advance toward elder status, and the \nimportant issues which inevitably arise during this process. \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU \nU 1 2 3  \nJ \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe All-Elder Chronicle \nStorytellers who enjoy challenges may want to create and run a \nchronicle wherein all the characters are elders. The familiar elements \nof scale, scope, characters, plot and theme all take on significantly \ndifferent dimensions when their focus is entirely on elders, and require \nsome greater consideration. Depending on the type of story you’re \npreparing, and the nature of your group, planning some escape routes \nin case things go wrong may well be the most important step in \npreparing to tell this kind of story. \nThe Elements of a Successful Elder \nChronicle \nScale \nThe all-elder chronicle generally functions more smoothly with \nrelatively few players. It is not unknown for games to consist of more \nthan 50 players, or even several hundred when staged at conventions \nand the like. If you find that you’ll have more than a dozen or so elder \nplayers, you may wish to reconsider - \nthe more elders you include, the \ngreater the potential for the game to get out of control on a regular basis. \nFifty elders gathered in one place is an invitation to disaster, particularly \nwhen those elders have no one to lord it over but each other. \nLimit your elder chronicle to a size that you feel you can comfort- \nably handle. Attempting to narrate the titanic battle in a metropolis \npopulated by a hundred Kindred with allegiances to different sects is \na story best done with a large team of Storytellers and Narrators. If you \ndecide to run a large elder chronicle, be certain you have enough \nNarrators and assistants to keep everything moving along. Elder \ninteraction is complex at best, but the wheeling and dealing becomes \nalmost Byzantine with a group of a dozen or more. So much political \nmachination produces a significant amount of extra paperwork and \nrecord-keeping as you track all the shifts in ownership of Boons, Status \nTraits, Influences and alliances throughout the course of the game. \nShould disagreements between many elders lead to open violence, you \nand your Narrators will be very busy resolving all the challenges such \nconflict entails. You’ll be grateful for the dozen or so Narrators \nfollowing the latest challenges when you’re in the middle of yet \nanother Brujah-Ventrue rumble that’s reducing the room to rubble. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nScope \nScope defines your chronicle’s impact on the lives of your characters \nand the world in which they exist. You may choose to give your story a \nvast, sweeping scope, perhaps dealing with the fate of the world itself. \nVampires who control governors, senators, ambassadors or even heads \nof state may influence the course of world events, bringing nations into \narmed conflict or completely restructuring the world economy to \nbenefit their grand design. You might decide to focus your scope more \nnarrowly, dealing with matters which interest only the individual \ncharacters. Sucha chronicle might be the story of a small coterie ofelders \nand their search for one of their number who’s suddenly disappeared. \nThe chronicle’s scope should be neither too trivial to merit the \nelders’ attention, nor so overwhelming that they feel helpless and \ndecide not even to bother trying. You may wish to vary the apparent \nscope throughout the progress of the story - \nthe scope of events can \nbe increased or decreased. For example, let’s start with a story that \ninvolves an outside threat annexing the characters’ mortal Influences. \nThe elders eventually discover and confront the nemesis raiding their \nresources. After the threat is dealt with, the scope of the game can be \nrefocused on the individual elders and their efforts to rebuild their \ndamaged power bases. Some elders will almost certainly attempt to \nsteal the Influences of their fellows rather than start over from scratch. \nThe other elders may either fight the thief or decide to follow his \nexample, igniting a citywide conflict which pits elder against elder, \nexpanding the chronicle’s scope once again. When elders from a \nneighboring city view this escalating warfare and decide it’s the perfect \ntime to annex the characters’ city into their own domain, the scope \nincreases again. \nBe careful that the scope of your story doesn’t expand until it \nreaches a point where it utterly dwarfs the characters, and players may \nprefer to throw up their hands in frustration rather than continue. \nMonitor the players’ reactions to the chronicle, and use this informa- \ntion to help guide you in adjusting the scope to its best dramatic \nadvantage. It’s no fun when things are so huge that you feel you can’t \npossibly make a difference. \nWhen determining scope for this type of game, it is often useful to \nthink of the elder chronicle as a single, brief segment in the ongoing \nstory of these ancient creatures - \na glimpse into one of the many \npossible tales which could be told of their long unlives. This doesn’t \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nannot run a chronicle wherein the stakes are nothing \nless than the fate of the world - \njust don’t do it on a regular basis \n(“We’re saving the world again? But we did that last week.. . .”), and \nalways do so with caution and with an eye toward balancing grandiose \ndesign with fundamental issues of character development. \nCharacters \nIt can be simpler to create premade characters complete with \nbackgrounds, goals and motivations, and then to give these to your \nplayers before beginning your game. It is one way to make certain the \ncharacters’ motivations are interlocked in order to guarantee the \nconflicts, alliances and intrigues which are the meat and drink of such \nstories. Read through the suggested elder motivations in Chapter One \nagain, and think about which might be best suited to which characters. \nYou will be able to come up with dozens of variations on these themes, \nand the more effort you put into this aspect, the more enjoyment you \nand your players will get from the story. \nAre there Brujah and Ventrue elders in your chronicle? The \nnatural rivalry of these clans can be greatly expanded when the \ncharacters are elders. Perhaps their current bitter enmity has its roots \nin a perpetually stalemated conflict that stretches across the centuries \nto medieval England, or perhaps it came about after Carthage’s \ndestruction. The two characters begin the chronicle with some com- \nmon history and predetermined attitudes toward one another, which \ncan jump-start a story. Is your story about the machinations of Sabbat \nleaders? Perhaps a Gangrel untinibu harbors a deep-seated grudge \nagainst the Lasombra bishop who has has blocked every opportunity \nfor her advancement. Her fight with the bishop may be centuries old, \nbut she can’t confront her enemy openly without fear of reprisal. She \ndreams of retribution, and would give a lot to rub her tormentor’s face \nin the dirt if the opportunity ever presented itself. The Lasombra \nbishop begins the game blissfully unaware of this long-bottled resent- \nment and bitterness, but for how long? \nOnce you have assigned characters, it is up to the players to \ndetermine how they manifest their characters’ motivations, goals and \nbackgrounds. The background information you provide should be \nsufficiently clear and developed to assist them. Merely informing the \nNosferatu elder that he despises all Ravnos is insufficient - \ndetail the \nsource of this hatred, and give the player something to work with as he \nconsiders how to interact with the Ravnos elder across the room. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nThe advantage of using ready-made characters is that it affords you \na somewhat greater degree of control over the story. If you have a \nspecific type of story in mind, pregenerated characters are the best \nmethod of steering events in the direction you wish. If your story \nhinges on awakening a torpid Methuselah under the city streets, you \ncan increase the chances of players taking such action by providing \none or more of them with characters whose goals include rousing this \nMethuselah from her eon-long sleep. \nThe drawback of utilizing ready-made characters is that players \nprefer to retain more creative freedom, particularly for a long chronicle. \nSome players object to the stereotypical attitudes and Traits of their \ncharacters’ clans with premade characters, even if such motivations \nare critical to your planned course. Players can quickly become \nfrustrated if forced to play characters they do not enjoy, and frustrated \nplayers can become destructive. For these reasons, confine premade \ncharacters to shorter chronicles. \nAllowing players to create their own characters does not mean that \nthey should do so in a vacuum, nor that they have carte blanche during \nthe creation process. Set your boundaries and stick to them. If you have \ndecided that Followers of Set are inappropriate to the story you are \ntelling (because they are the primary antagonists or some such), inform \nthe group of this restriction before they start creating characters. Tell \nthem what sort of story you’re planning for and what they need to think \nabout, such as that your city is Camarilla-controlled, that independents \nneed a very good reason for appearing in the city, etc. \nEach character should have a strong motive that is clear to both \nthe player and you; it will be invaluable when creating subplots. If your \nplayers need help, suggest that they consider their elders in a vacuum \n-what \nwould their characters wish to accomplish if they were the sole \nKindred in the story, unopposed by rivals and free to do exactly as they \npleased? Would they want to be left completely alone in quiet \ncontemplation as they pursue Golconda, or would they want to secure \ncontrol over every factory and manufacturing plant in the city? Now \nask the players to thinkabout these motivations in relation to the same \nsetting, but accounting for the presence of other Kindred in the city. \nDoes the reality of sharing the night with other elders change these \ngoals, or does it mean that the characters must discover new means of \naccomplishing their goals? This kind of exercise not only helps the \nplayers build strong character motivations, but helps set the stage for \ndynamic interactions when play begins. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nare each capable of leveling entire city blocks single-handedly, you \nhave no one to blame but yourself if your chronicle concludes with \nthe characters’ untimely deaths or the extinction of all life on the \nplanet. Unless the plot of your chronicle involves Gehenna, you \nprobably are not planning for this kind of outcome for your story. \nEncourage players to give their elders distinct personalities, \ninteresting histories and several weaknesses. After all, for all the age \nand power these beings possess, they are hardly perfect. Give players \nenough information about the scope, setting and basic structure of \nthe chronicle so that they can make appropriate choices in these \nmatters. One who decides that her Nosferatu elder witnessed first- \nhand the formation of the Soviet Union, starting with the Russian \nRevolution, will be irked if she unexpectedly discovers during the \nfirst session that you have rewritten history and removed that \nparticular event in the process. \nPerhaps the most important contribution you can make during \ncharacter creation is to encourage players to think the way an elder \nthinks. The life span of an elder vampire is prolonged many, many \ntimes beyond a human’s, and yet our human perceptions, ideas and \nimpressions are the tools we use when designing a character whose \nfundamental concept is very different from our own. The physical, \nmental and social capabilities that make elders distinct from neo- \nnates and ancillae manifest themselves through roleplay. Encourage \nthe players to imagine how their characters watched or participated \nin the pageant of history, how that pageant has affected their \noutlook, and how they’ll reflect that in play. \nThe scale, scope, theme and mood of an elder chronicle are all \nimportant to its success, but the plot is the heart and soul which allows \nyour chronicle to move. The Storyteller is responsible for creating an \nengaging, progressive series of events which involve all the players, and \nstrives to capture their imaginations. Composing a successful plot for an \nall-elder chronicle is no simple task. If you make the plot too obvious or \nsimple, the players will solve things too quickly and become bored; if you \ncreate a story too difficult and nebulous, they may become frustrated at \ntheir slow progress. Balance is the key to a successful plot - \nyour story \nmust be sufficiently complex and interesting to offer the players a \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nchallenge, but should also be tailored to their individual characters in \nsuch a way that they each have opportunities to advance the plot. \nYou should have the basic elements of your plot in mind so you can \nassist players during character creation. If you have established a chronicle \nwhich revolves around an elite Sabbat strike force cut off from help deep \nwithin the heart of Camarilla territory, it is doubtful that Camarilla-loyal \nVentrue and Toreador elders would fare well in this story. \nConstruct your plot on several levels, both macro and micro. The \nmacro-level, or main plot, should revolve around events, ideas or \nsituations which involve the entire group. This is the foundation of \nyour story, and should be appropriately related to the theme, mood and \nscale you chose (see above). All the elders should have the opportunity \nto participate to some degree in this main plot, although the charac- \nters’ own actions largely determine the level of involvement they \nhave. It is perfectly acceptable to let the macro-level of plot be rather \nobvious - \nthis doesn’t mean it should be trite or clichcd, but rather \nthat it is fine to make the main element of the story obvious to the \ncharacters, since this is what will initially attract their attention. \nThe micro-level of your story consists of subplots, most of which \nshould be designed with individual characters in mind. These are the \ntales and events which are created for, and are sustained by, particular \ncharacters in your chronicle. A Nosferatu elder may wish to extend the \nboundaries of his sewer domain, or a Toreador elder may desire to \nhumble a longtime rival. You should have no difficulty in constructing \nsubplots for your elders, but be certain to involve your elders in some of \nthe subplot planning. This will ensure that each participant is comfort- \nable in the subplot you and she create. You may wish to establish a \nromantic subplot for the elder Malkavian unticribu, but unless the person \nplaying the Malkavian unticribu is comfortable with the idea, the result \nmay be an inadequate subplot and an annoyed player. \nUse particular care when playing a chronicle with pregenerated \nelders. You must supply all the subplots for such characters, and you must \nmake certain that the micro-level of the story meshes properly. Suppose \nyou create a Tzimisce elder who has been pursuing his packmate’s \nassassin for over a century, and is by the start of the chronicle nearly \nconsumed with the terrible thirst for vengeance. Imagine how disap- \npointed the Tzimisce elder’s player will be if he plays through the \nduration of an extended chronicle without gaining even the opportu- \nnity to confront the assassin, simply because you did not include the \nkiller among the player characters or Narrator characters. His entire \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPlot creation for the all-elder chronicle need not be the sole \nresponsibility of the Storyteller. Players should be invited to share in the \nestablishment of the micro-level of the story as well. The Storyteller \nmust create the main plot as the framework for the tale, but the players \nshould feel encouraged to add support and strength to the framework \nthrough the creation of some of their own subplots. Once again, this \nstage of preparation should be a joint venture between Storyteller and \nplayers. A player may choose to play a Ventrue elder in your chronicle, \nand will be eager to play out her own subplot concerning her character’s \nflight from her former comrades, a notorious Sabbat pack. This is \nwithout a doubt a juicy and interesting subplot, but the Storyteller must \nknow about it in order to make effective use of the information! \nWhen making final preparations for your elder chronicle, consider \nhow you will set in motion and maintain a plot with a controlled level \nof conflict. The story setting should change sufficiently over the course \nof the chronicle to remain interesting, and for the conflicts themselves \nto matter (see Scope, above), but should also be stable enough to be \nsustainable throughout many game sessions. Otherwise, you may find \nthat the elders’ interaction with the plot creates problems your group \nwill then look to you to solve (see Troubleshooting for Elders, below). \nTheme \nStorytellers whose chronicles feature an all-elder group may choose \nany theme for their story, but care should be taken to select themes with \nspecial relevance to elder characters. Revenge, for example, is an \nexcellent theme to explore in an elder chronicle. What happens to \nbeings who thirst for, or are the target of, more than their fair share of \nvengeance throughout their lives? Do they ever weary of seeking \nvengeance for insults, or do they develop some type of protective \nmental attitude against such trifles? Who really benefits from revenge? \nWhat happens to an elder who spends her unlife seeking revenge and \nfinally obtains it? What forms might the revenge of an angered elder \ntake? The Storyteller might also choose the theme of loyalty for her \nstory. At what price can elders expect or demand loyalty? Can loyalty \nbetween elders ever truly last? Do expectations of loyalty inevitably \nresult in betrayal? Why does loyalty seem to be among the most \nfleeting of the Kindred’s characteristics? What happens when we \nrefuse to offer loyalty when it is expected or demanded? \nchronicle, and he may well feel dissatisfied by the result. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSample Elder Chronicle \nThe characters cmpnse the primogen of a moderately sized city under the \ncontrol of anewly installedpnnce. The fonnergrince andpnmogen were ousted \nby a conclave after archons discovered alarming cracks in the city’s Masquerade. \nThenewpn‘mogenmustsc~ive \ntodealwiththeprobkms left by theirpredecessors \nin addition to their personal issues and the night-to-night chauenges of running \na city. The elders’ motivatiuns will be ofparamount importance in determining \n~ Q W  \nthe characters interact with one another, in addition to exploring how they \nproceed to rebuild the shattered Masquerade and bring the city under control. \nSometimes a seemingly simple plot can be a springboard for any \nnumber of interesting subplots, particularly in an all-elder chronicle. This \nsample plot is a strong but flexible framework to which you can attach an \nalmost endless variety of story adornments to flesh out the idea. This basic \nstory can be expanded in any number of directions. For example: \nWhat happened to the previous prince and primogen? If the \nconclave spared their lives, they could be intent on reclaiming their \nlost authority. This sets up a politically motivated chronicle, charged \nwith tension as the two factions attempt to prove the other’s incom- \npetence and malfeasance. If the former rulers of the city are desperate, \nthey may even go as far as to exacerbate the problems they created in \nan attempt to demonstrate that their successors are no better equipped \nto run the city than they themselves were. \nPerhaps it is too late, and the thin veil of the Masquerade has \nbeen irrevocably pierced by the keen eyes of vampire-hunters. Agents \nof the Inquisition or the federal government could be establishing \ntheir presence in the city by the time your characters assume control \nof their new domain. The characters will become the hunters’ quarry \nin the nights to come, and must find a means of thwarting the hunters \nor suffer a fate even worse than that of their predecessors. \nFactions who have waited patiently for a sign ofweakness may choose \nthis opportunity to strike. An anarch gang or Sabbat pack may select the \nchanging of the guard as the perfect moment to attack, hoping to cause \nsufficient confusion that the new rulers will not be able to mount a defense \nor counterattack. Introducingagroupofantagonistsneednot meanlocating \nmoreplayers; theactivitiesofthegangorpackcaneasily takep1ace“offstage” \nas the antagonists assault the elders’ holdings and resources. \nTwists, surprises and layers of intrigue add depth and interest to \nwhat was a relatively uncomplicated plot structure. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nIntegrating Elders into a \nRegular Chronicle \nMany Storytellers who read this book will already be engaged in \nrunning a chronicle, but will wish to incorporate some of the ideas and \nconcepts they read here into the story. Does this mean that you must \nscrap the current chronicle and start an entirely new story, or that you \nmust rewrite your entire plot and subplots in order to accommodate elder \ncharacters?Not at all. Withsome conscientious effort, youcansmoothly \nintegrate elders into an established chronicle. Add new elders into your \nregular chronicle sparingly. Dropping one or two elders into a game in \nprogress can increase dramatic tension and give the plot a richer texture. \nIntroducing too many new elders can create chaos. \nBefore adding an elder to your chronicle, examine the current plot \nand consider the effect a new elder will have on it. How will the \nincoming elder alter the existing story elements (for they are almost \ncertain to change once she is introduced). How will you go about \ncasting the new role? Will you give the player a pregenerated elder to \nensure that the new character meshes with your chronicle, or will you \nallow her to create her own character within the guidelines you supply? \nIf you’ve already spent a great deal of time in crafting the chronicle, \nyou should be able to identify the types of problems you are likely to \nencounter, and what kind of preventive medicine is in order. \nThe existing plot of your regular chronicle is probably already a \nchallenge for your current players. Is it also of sufficient interest to the \narriving elder? Will the presence of a new elder completely invalidate \nthe plot, or will the story be enhanced? The plot might well be of less \ninterest to the elder than her own personal goals, in which case you \nshould identify which of the existing storylines her goals might \nintersect with. Will this contribute to the game? \nAn example of a chronicle which easily could be derailed by the \nintroduction of an elder concerns a coterie of neonate anarchs who are \ntrying to overthrow the prince. The neonates are singly far less \npowerful than the elder, and even collectively might have difficulty in \npreserving their safety. How will these anarchs react to the sudden \nappearance of a Tremere elder who offers to assist them? Attempting \nto integrate this particular elder into that particular chronicle might \nnot be such a wise idea. Why should the neonates believe that a \n-\n-\nu\n u \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \nu \n132 \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTremere, much less an elder, would be interested in them? While it \nmight be interesting to see how the Tremere gains the trust of his \nyoung compatriots, it could also drag out and take time away from the \nmain plotline. A better choice might be to introduce a Brujah elder \nwho wants to guide the young anarchs in their struggle against the \noppressive status quo, or to urge them to use nonviolent means to get \nwhat they want from the prince. \nPerhaps you have set up a framework regarding the efforts of a \nCamarilla-held city to root out invading Setites who have established a \ntemple in the vicinity. Currently, the characters are making steady \nprogress in discovering the existence of the Setites and the location of \ntheir lair. Now that the enemy has been found, the characters must \ndecide how to deal with the threat. Does the about-to-be-introduced \nelder possess any Abilities or Disciplines which, if utilized, will suddenly \nmake this task too simple? If so, it isn’t necessary to scrap the main plot \ncompletely, but consider revising some of the remaining portions of the \nstory to ensure that it continues at the proper pace and remains \ninteresting for the players. You might decide, for instance, to change the \nmanner in which the Setites are infiltrating the city, making them more \ndifficult to discover, or you might improve the defenses around their \ntemple if the elder is persuaded to join the assault. \nYou must also give some attention to the effect of the elders on the \nindividual subplots which are currently in progress throughout your \ngame. Will the elder change the scope or viability of any of these \npersonal storylines? Can the elder be safely and effectively introduced \ninto any of these subplots? Consider two characters deeply enamored \nof one another. If the elder is added into this relationship, it creates a \nlove triangle with a multitude of new possibilities. The elder may \npossess motivations and goals similar to those of one or more existing \ncharacters, establishing a potential for conflict that you must deter- \nmine how best to manage. Two Toreador ancillae may combine their \nresources to obtain control over an important civic institution, such \nas a city orchestra. Introducing an elder Ventrue who possesses the \ndesire and resources to snatch the orchestra right out of the Toreadors’ \ngrasp guarantees a new twist to your story. What happens if the \nToreador decide to unite the rest of the clan against the Ventrue \nusurper, or if they hire a mercenary Assamite to do him in? \nYou may decide to introduce the elder as a new antagonist - \na \nNosferatu antitribu, for example, who has recently arrived in the city \nfor the dual purpose of exchanging information with his Camarilla \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nd rescuing a fellow Sabbat vampire from the prince’s \ne Nosferatu is unlikely to march into the Prince’s court \nand announce his plans to all andsundry, even if this approach saves \na great deal of exposition time. The same holds true if the elder is \nintent on a peaceful mission, such as the pursuit of a fragment of \nancient lore which might lead him a step closer to his goal of \nachieving Golconda. An elder Kindred would not survive long if she \nmade a habit of revealing her true agenda to everyone she met. An \nelder’s business is her own, and she is within her rights to inform the \nnosy little neonates to buzz off. Of course, that will probably only \nserve to pique the players’ interest - \nwhat reason could an elder \nhave for being in the city? \nNeonate and ancillae characters tend to gravitate toward elders, \nand you must take this fact into account when integrating an elder into \nyour chronicle. If an elder and ancilla are of the same clan, it is \nunderstandable that the latter may feel some measure of kinship with \nthe elder and wish to introduce himself to the newcomer. The Ventrue \nelder who enters a domain controlled primarily by Clan Brujah will \ncertainly find herself the focus of a great deal of neonate attention from \nthe very first night. Younger characters sometimes hope to request \nfavors of their elders, and sometimes they plan to ride their coattails. \nSometimes they seek another voice to involve in the simmering \ncauldron of local politics, and other times they hope to gain a new ally \n(or perhaps a convenient scapegoat for an impending fracture of the \nMasquerade). Neonates may be awestruck by these living relics, and \napproach them for advice or guidance (such as how to live as long as \nthey have). Ancillae may find them a welcome voice of experience \nafter dealing with neonates for so long (even though they themselves \nare now the “neonate” in the eyes of the elder). If the elder’s Nature \nand Demeanor permit it, encourage the player occasionally to dis- \npense a few in-character snippets of advice or praise to the “deserving \nyoungsters.” Such interaction can make the difference between a \nsmooth transition and an unwelcome intrusion. \nElders will most likely experience difficulty in steering clear of any \nprominent plot threads you have already woven into your chronicle. \nIndeed, it would be a very strange thing not to be approached by any \nyounger vampires regarding some mystery or problem. Should an elder \ntruly wish to remain aloof from a given plot or subplot, she may well \nbe obliged to extricate herself continuously from difficult or even \ncompromising positions. Requesting that one’s fellow Kindred leave \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\none alone often has the exact reverse effect, making the elder the \ndirect center of plenty of unwanted attention- the assumption being, \nof course, that anyone who asks to be left alone has something to hide, \nand anyone who has something to hide is worth observing. Elder \ncharacters (and players) shouldaccept the fact that they will be subject \nto a certain degree of scrutiny and attention from their fellow Kindred, \nand should determine how they would react to these circumstances \nbefore they enter the chronicle. \nElder Plot Hooks \nRivals - \nThere is nothing like good old-fashioned rivalry to stir \nup plenty of character-related conflict. If you plan to introduce more \nthan one new elder into your regular chronicle simultaneously, con- \nsider providing them with a sufficient reason to view one another as \ncompetitors. Each elder should have some element in her background \nwhich intersects with the others, and those playing these elders should \nmake an attempt to work out the idiosyncrasies of their relationship \nprior to joining the game in progress. \nClan Matters -An effective means of introducing an elder into \nan ongoing chronicle is to make the character a representative of her \nclan bearing a message or instructions for the other members of her \nclan already in the city. Her own orders are to remain in the city and \nassist her clan in achieving its goals in this area. \nTraitor-The \nelder is a traitor and is fleeing those she betrayed. \nPerhaps she is a renegade Tremere seeking refuge from the minions of \nthe Council of Seven, or maybe she is a Brujah anarch who failed to \ncome to the aid of her pack and now attempts to escape their wrath. \nConsider if her treason is meant to engender sympathy or rage, and \ntailor the motive to be appropriately believable. \nArchons - \nThe elder characters are a coterie of archons, the \nbrood of a Justicar charged with enforcing the Masquerade and \nhunting diablerists. Rather than announce their identity and station \nto the prince, they arrive secretly in the city and pose as ordinary \nKindred. Once established, they quietly begin investigating the other \ncharacters for potential breaches of the Traditions. \nInfiltrator - \nMuch like the archon suggestion described above, \nthe elder is a Sabbat pack leader intent on recruiting new members \nfrom among the city’s anarchs and disgruntled Kindred. \nPrince’s Lackey - \nIf the elder character is of the appropriate \nclan and sect affiliation, she can be introduced as a new functionary of, \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nor assistant to, the prince, sent by her sire as a favor to the prince, who \nin turn will teach her the nuances of ruling a Kindred city. The elder \nmust cope with the various tasks the prince sets for her, while honoring \nthe wishes of her sire. \nMethuselah Agent - \nThe elder character is the spy of an \nancient vampire who has only recently awakened from torpor. The \nMethuselah needs to know many details about how the world has \nchanged since she slept, and what the Kindred of the city are now \ndoing around her. The elder will probably be obliged to ask many \nquestions and become interested in almost every aspect of the chronicle \nin order to fulfill the Methuselah‘s commands. \nPrince -This particular plot hook works best in a city without \na current prince or with a prince whose popularity is on the wane. An \nelder who arrives in the city to announce her claim to domain, or to \nusurp the throne of the current prince, can galvanize the Kindred of a \ncity into action either on her behalf or against her. \nTroubleshooting for Elders \nYour most potent defense against losing control of the chronicle \nis restraint. By now you will have seen that many players often enjoy \ncreating the most powerful characters they can. This tendency to \ngravitate toward powerful characters is a condition endemic to \nroleplaying in general, and to The Masquerade in particular. Be \nprepared for requests and the occasional begging for characters and \npowers you know will upset your chronicle, but which the player wants \nin spite of your most persuasive arguments. Players want the “best” \ncharacter - \nit’s a given in human nature - \nbut too many players \nequate “best” with “most powerful” rather than “most interesting” or \n“most challenging.” If you ask someone why he wants to play a sixth- \ngeneration Brujah with the maximumnumber of Attribute, Willpower \nand Ability Traits, and he answers, “Because it’s fun,” chances are he \nmeans, “Because I’m tired of getting womped on, and I want to start \nwomping now.” This type of player is not telling a story or roleplaying \n- \nhe’s in a competition between himself and the other players. He \nbelieves that this game has winners and losers, that the winner is the \nplayer whose character is the last one standing at the end of the night, \nand he wants to be a winner. No matter what it takes, he wants to be \na winner. Killing characters, derailing plot, driving you insane - \nwhatever it takes to be a winner. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nRestrain the impulse to give in to such requests; you’ll regret it \nwhen your story runs awry and new players are driven off by \n“Godzilla.” It can be tempting to give in to player requests (or \ndemands), particularly if the player threatens to quit the game or \ndisrupt the current chronicle. If you know that the player’s request \nis unacceptable because it will unbalance your chronicle, stick to \nyour guns as the Storyteller looking out for your game. The \nenjoyment of your player group is more important than appeasing \nsomeone who is apparently not mature enough to participate in \nyour story. \nAnother line of defense is clarity. It is up to you to remind the \nplayers of their responsibilities when playing elders, whether your \nstory is comprised solely of elders or a mixture of power levels. Even \nas you strive to live up to your own responsibilities as the Story- \nteller, so must the elders cooperate with you in fulfilling their end \nof the bargain. Tell your elders exactly what you expect from them \nand what you see as their responsibilities to the story. Perhaps you \ndon’t want the elders to interfere with a particular subplot you’ve \ncrafted for a new player who is trying out the game for the first time \n- \ntoo much attention from, or the untimely intervention of, the \nelders might overwhelm him, ending his interest in the game and \ndepriving your troupe of a new member. Maybe you have decided \nthat all elders must begin the game with an extra Beast Trait, or \nmust possess no more than the usual Abilities or Influence Traits. \nRegardless of the exact stipulations, communicate these condi- \ntions to your elder players and make certain they acknowledge your \nexpectations. Be as clear as possible when expressing your con- \ncerns, and allow the elders ample opportunity to ask questions. \nArmed with a mutual understanding of the elders’ places and roles \nin the chronicle, you can reasonably minimize the initial problems \nyou might otherwise face. \nWhat happens if you unintentionally miscalculate the appro- \npriate power level for your all-elder chronicle, or allow a player to \nplay an elder too powerful for the existing plot? The danger signs \nare easy to identify: \nElders seem intent on turning every minor disagreement with \nother characters into lethal showdowns. \nGame sessions frequently degenerate into prolonged mob \ncombats during which the noncombatants are particularly bored \nand unhappy. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPlayers appear intoxicated with the power of their characters \nand act irresponsibly, disregarding the Masquerade and relying on \ntheir elder powers to save them even from blatantly foolhardy actions. \nKey story elements are ignored or discarded in favor of Physical \nChallenges and combat. \nPlayers ask you to “do something” about a particular player \nwhom they feel is causing disruption by the manner in which he \nportrays his elder. \nCharacters die with an alarming frequency at the hands of elders. \nYou might be tempted to raise the power level even higher in \norder to correct one or more of these undesirable situations - \nin a \nword, don’t. It is false logic to conclude that the threat of mutually \nassured destruction between characters will act as a deterrent. You \nmight think that introducing even more powerful characters will \nslow down this kind of behavior or prevent it altogether, but you will \nfind that power escalation only increases the frequency of disruption. \nExamine the problem and analyze what you perceive to be its cause \nbefore deciding exactly how best to handle it. \nSometimes, hosting a “post-mortem” discussion with your troupe \nafter the conclusion of a night’s game can give you some insight into \nthe cause of any problems you perceived. Talk freely about the \ncharacters’ actions and their motivations - \nyour players may sur- \nprise you with their explanations for their characters’ behavior. If \ntheir motives don’t wash, decide what you want to do about the \nsituation. You could decide that your players simply aren’t ready for \nthe privilege and responsibility of playing characters of this power \nlevel. If this is the case, try starting over with less powerful charac- \nters. Talk with the players you feel are most disruptive and discuss \ntheir behavior. Maybe they play the game simply for the rumbles, and \nare not happy with your more intrigue-oriented plots. If you believe \na single player is at the root of these difficulties, give him the option \nof modifying his behavior or leaving the game. Don’t sacrifice your \nenjoyment, and that of everyone else, for the sake of one disruptive \nplayer. If after a reasonable attempt at correction the same problems \nrecur, you may be playing with the wrong troupe. \nRemember to keep an open mind and be flexible. Accept that \nyour players will stray from the story, miss clues and take the game in \nunforeseen directions - \nthat’s part of telling a story. Because of the \ndifference in power between elders, ancillae and neonates, the elders \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\ncan often steer the plot where they wish by main force. Once an elder \nestablishes her enhanced Status or physical power, many other \ncharacters are less inclined to refuse to carry out her wishes, reason- \ning that it’s better to relinquish the clue to the elder rather to have \none’s face pulped or memory erased. In other instances, elder char- \nacters can unintentionally create circumstances which alter the \nentire dynamic of your chronicle. A Malkavian neonate with a \ncrucial clue falls afoul of the Nosferatu elder. He takes her down to \nthe sewers for a prolonged “visit” to teach her better manners; \nmeanwhile, the clock is running down, her coterie is frantic, and the \nclue which could have unlocked the plot is missing in action. \nIf this sort of thing seems to happen frequently, try to find out if \nthe players in question are simply acting out what they believe to be \nan interpretation of their characters’ motivations and Nature, or if \nthey are pursuing some nongame-related goals which are dampening \nthe fun for everyone else. Did the prince decide unexpectedly to \nexecute a character for a ridiculously minor offense? Talk with him \nafter the game, and be honest about your concerns. It’s possible he \nfelt he was portraying a Derangement accurately and skillfully; \nmaybe he was so caught up in the ebb and flow of the plot that he \nforgot to be respectful of other players. If you maintain strong, \nconstant lines of communication with your players, you should be \nable to approach them and discuss such topics without making them \nfeel defensive. Publicly berating players for seemingly inappropriate \nactions doesn’t do anything other than antagonize the players and \nmake you look foolish. If you discover that the elder players believe \nthemselves to be acting in accordance with your stated expectations \nand within the boundaries of their established motivations and \ngoals, fixing any problems should simply be a matter of altering some \nof the plot elements as discussed above. \nShould you find that the elder characters are indeed acting \noutside the initial dictates of their character concepts and motiva- \ntions - \ncreating new personal subplots, for example, without \nmeaning to disrupt the game - \nyour task is somewhat more of a \nproblem. It’s best to involve some or all of the elder characters in \nfinding a solution to this type of situation. Asking a particular elder \nto avoid interfering with a certain subplot might be somewhat \ninelegant, but might also maintain your chronicle’s viability. If you \nare certain that an elder character’s unintentional effect on the \nstory is disruptive or harmful, you should feel secure in asking that \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nplayer to help you guide the plot in a more useful direction. Some \nStorytellers refrain from ever interfering in the chronicle’s direc- \ntion once it is set in motion, preferring to adopt a more laissezfaire \nrelationship to the plot once it is underway and to let the tale grow \nin the telling. This strategy sometimes works for chronicles wherein \nthe characters collectively do not have the power to disrupt \nsignificantly the flow of the plot. Even when your players roleplay \nresponsibly, their actions can still send the plot off course. You \nmust keep track of where the plot is going, otherwise you may find \nthe chronicle ends abruptly and in a manner far less satisfying than \nyou originally intended. It’s not about whether or not to let the bus \nrun driverless, but rather about applying sufficient guidance and \ndirection to ensure that everyone on the bus reaches the destina- \ntion with the maximum amount of fun and enjoyment. \nIf you determine that a player is using the power of his elder \ncharacter to ride roughshod over your plot and lord it over the other \nplayers because he enjoys doing so, you must deal with him immedi- \nately before things go too far. Talk privately and candidly with the \nproblem player. If you believe he has the potential to learn to \nroleplay responsibly and to respect the other players, by all means try \nto allow him to continue to play an elder character, perhaps with the \nassistance of a trustedNarrator, or you may consider challenging him \nwith a significantly less powerful, but no less interesting, character. \nIf he chooses not to mend his ways, ask him not to return to the game. \nThis can be uncomfortable, but in these circumstances it is to the \nlong-term benefit of yourself and your players. \nCharacter Advancement \nPlayers who do not currently play elders will want to play them \neventually, particularly if you introduce them into your regular \nchronicle. Meanwhile, your elders players will want to advance their \nown characters, You’ll be inundated with requests to grant more \nexperience points, to permit neonate characters to rise to elder status, \nand to allow the chronicle to progress in time to the point where \npreviously young characters are now wearing the mantle of elder. \nThere are several techniques you can use to guide character advance- \nment, and all require some measure of restraint on your part, tempered \nwith the acceptance that characters are not static but ever-changing \nentities, just like the people who play them. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAwarding Experience to Elders \nPlayers will always want more experience points than you award, \nand you will always want to make certain that characters do not \nadvance too quickly. Players may argue that elders are older and \ntherefore smarter, and should therefore learn now powers and skills \nmore quickly than non-elders, so why not give them a few more \nexperience points per game session? In truth, these aged Kindred find \nthat learning new concepts and skills becomes far more difficult with \nthe passing of the centuries. The elders are the guardians of the status \nquo - \nchange in Kindred society is anathema to them, and this \nstaunch opposition to change manifests itself in their ability to learn \nnew things and cope with new ideas. Advancements which move like \nquicksilver through the younger, more receptive Kindred mind and \nbody flow sluggishly through the barriers of mental and physical \nresistance. Thus, the older the Kindred, the more difficult it is for her \nto increase her powers and capabilities. \nIncreasing the necessary experience point expenditures for elders \nbased on the characters’ age reflects the increased difficulty the elder \nvampire experiences in attempting to advance his abilities. Recognize \nthat elders who advance faster than, or even at the equivalent rate of, \nnon-elders will pose serious problems sooner rather than later. Elders \nusually begin with more Traits and Disciplines than non-elder charac- \nters. If you permit elders to advance faster than non-elders, or even at \nthe same rate, the power differential will only become that much \ngreater. Conversely, don’t advance the non-elder characters so quickly \nthat the 13th-generation neonate Gangrel who was Embraced five \nyears agocansinglehandedly thrash the eighth-generation elder Tremere, \nembraced many centuries ago, in only a month‘s worth of games. Such \nprogress should be moderate to slow, and amended by your better \njudgment if you believe things are advancing too fast or too slow. \nAwarding elders too many experience points can lead to the \nelders becoming overconfident in their own abilities or omnipotent, \ndamaging the game for everyone involved. Allowing elders to stock \nup on Advanced and Master-level powers too quickly creates a game \nwherein they are almost impossible to deal with - \nthey begin to \ncause huge waves with the smallest gestures, casually destroying \ncharacters and subplots with equal ease. Restraint and balance are \nthe keys to preventing this disaster, and you should exercise them \nceaselessly. If you must err when advancing a character, it is best to \nerr on the side of caution. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nI \nThis chart reflects the difficulty inherent in the elder’s skill \nadvancement.

Such Kindred are only technically considered “elders” in the eyes of \ntheir more experienced peers, especially those who have existed far longer \nthan any Pretender. However, Kindred emphasize respect for purity of \nbloodline, and thus Pretenders are grudgingly admitted into elder society due \nto the power of the vitae flowing through their veins. Pretenders are honored \nfor their lineage, not for themselves. Examples of Pretenders are those Kindred \nwho were recently Embraced by powerful sires, granting them the privilege \nof unusually low generation, or those sinister vampires who have committed \nthe heinous crime of diablerie and stolen the power of their elders. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPlayers who wish to create Pretender characters should follow the \ncharacter creation system outlined in Laws of the Night, with the \nfollowing modifications: \nPretenders start at 10th Generation, and may lower their \ngeneration further by means of Negative Traits. No Pretender may \nstart with a generation lower than eighth. \nPretenders receive the additional Status Trait Known. \nAll Pretenders are automatically one Trait down in any Social \nChallenge involving a true elder. \nPretenders should be prepared to receive some degree of animosity \nand reluctance from their true elder peers. Camarilla Kindred may \nconfine their distaste for Pretenders to social sniping and snide \nremarks about the character’s age, but the scorn of Sabbat vampires \nmay take on far more ugly connotations. \nTime-lapse Advancement \nSome chronicles are designed to span decades or even longer \nperiods of time. They may begin, for example, during the Enlighten- \nment and continue through the present day, with each game session \nrepresenting a number of years, decades or centuries. During such \nchronicles it is inevitable that some characters will achieve elder status \nsimply by virtue of their survival. Characters who become elders \nshould naturally experience some degree of improvement over their \nabilities and skills, depending on what they have accomplished and on \nhow much time has passed during the chronicle. You must decide \nexactly how to handle the progression to elder status for your players. \nThere are two useful methods to facilitate this process. \nMethod One: Start the characters as neonates when the chronicle \ncommences. At the conclusion of each game session that reflects a \ntransition into the next era when the characters are active, award \nthem each a certain number of experience points. The characters may \nspend their experience points on whatever enhancements they wish \nduring the transition. \nMethod Two: Begin the characters on their journey as in Method \nOne, above. Decide how much time will pass in your chronicle, and \nestablish the appropriate transition periods. When you reach a tran- \nsitional stage, award your players experience points as you normally \nwould for this type of story. However, permit them to spend their \nexperience primarily on those skills and capabilities they managed to \nuse successfully during the last portion of the chronicle. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNew Rules and Clarifications \nBlood \nBlood Addiction \nLupine blood is addictive to Kindred. Whenever a Kindred feeds \nfrom a Lupine, he must conduct a Static Mental Challenge, with the \ndifficulty being the sum of the Lupine’s current Rage and Gnosis \nTraits. If the Kindred wins, he is free from addiction; if he loses, he \ngains the Derangement Addicted, and must feed from Lupine blood \nwhenever possible. Failure to feed thus on a regular basis may provoke \nfrenzy, sending the Kindred after the closest Lupine. Kindred that \nbecome addicted to Lupine blood may attempt to “kick the habit” by \nexpending a Willpower Trait and retesting the initial Static Chal- \nlenge. This retest may be attempted only once, and failure means that \nyou automatically frenzy on the Derangement. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBlood Expenditures \nBlood expenditure limitations are valid in all cases except where a \nDiscipline would otherwise require a vampire to spend more blood than his \ngeneration would allow. In such cases, the Kindred can use blood in excess \nof generation limits, but only for purposes of activating that Discipline. \nIn other words, a vampire with Form of the Beast may spend the \nthree Traits of blood in order to change instantly to the form desired, \nbut may not spend blood for any other reason until the next turn - \nabout a minute or so. \nBlood Storage \nTo store mortal blood successfully (as opposed to coming home to \na refrigerator full of clotted gunk), a character must have a minimum \nMedical Ability rating of two or at least one level of the Health \nInfluence. Human blood, under proper conditions, can be stored for \none month. Then, even under the best of circumstances, it goes bad. \nDrinking bad blood renders no nourishment, and may induce the \nvampire to vomit up good blood already in his system. \nKindred vitae has radically different properties than does mortal blood. \nCarefully stored, it can provide nourishment and pleasure (or bonding) for \nquite some time. Neonate blood rarely lasts more than one year, while a \nMethuselah's blood does not lose potency for a century, if not longer. \nNote: Questions of blood potency also apply to drinks left for \nKindred in torpor. \nBlood Traits of Food Source \nThe following chart lists the number of Blood Traits found in \nvarious creatures. If afood source is drained completely it dies, with the \nexception of Garou, who lose one Health Level for every two Blood \nTraits taken. Humans and animals lose two Health Levels per Trait \ntaken, and die if completely drained. \nCat \n1 \nChicken \n1 \nChild \n2 \ncow \n8 \nDog \n2 \nGarou \n8 \nHuman \n4 \nRat \n1 \nFood Source \nBlood Traits \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nWillpower \nReplenishing Willpower \nWillpower is replenished in full once the Storyteller determines \nthe story is over. The process of replenishment takes precisely as long \nas the Storyteller says it does. \nStaying Awake \nThe expenditure of Willpower is required for a vampire to remain \nawake during the day. This has nothing to with being able to move \nabout normally in the daylight - \na vampire must spend Willpower to \nmove, even in the darkest, dankest crypt, as long as the sun is in the sky \noverhead. If a vampire wishes to remain awake during daylight hours, \nhe must spend one Willpower Trait for every four hours after sunrise \nduring which he wants to stomp around. Obviously, given this restric- \ntion, a vampire can’t stay up all day too often. \nFrenzy \nA Willpower Trait may be spent to prevent frenzy for 10 minutes. \nIf the character has not removed herself from the situation, person or \nobject provoking her at the end of that time, she must spend another \nWillpower Trait to stave off the inevitable for another 10 minutes. \nThis continues until either the character is away from the provoca- \ntion, she runs out of Willpower or she gives in and frenzies. \nReplenishing Traits \nOnce per night, a character may choose to spend a Willpower \nTrait and regain all lost Traits in any of the three Attribute categories \n(Social, Physical, Mental). This does not mean that a character may \nspend a Willpower Trait and regain all lost Traits in all categories; a \nWillpower Trait must be spent for each category the character wishes \nreplenished. The expenditure is limited to one per category per night. \nIgnoring Wounds \nThose characters without Endurance may find themselves in dire \nstraits if they have sustained wounds. The expenditure of one Will- \npower Trait allows a character to ignore all wound penalties for one \nchallenge. Characters with Celerity should note that each additional \naction is a separate challenge, and requires a new Willpower Trait to \nbe spent for each action in which the character wishes to negate his \nwound penalties. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nTheLongNight \nThe following Disciplines apply to the clans and bloodlines found \nin The Long Night. \nAbornbwe \nMaster \nDevil-Channel \nWith the expenditure of two Blood Traits, you may channel your \nBeast to concentrate in a specific area of your body. The concentration \nof Beast-nature manifests itself as a film of black, clotted blood \ncovering the appropriate body part. The Beast may only be forced into \none spot at a time; one cannot Devil-Channel into one’s hands and \nthroat simultaneously. \nHands: You may now inflict aggravated damage with your bare, \nbloody hands. You also gain the Physical Trait Tough for the five \nminutes during which this power is active. \nTorso: You may now use your Blood Traits more efficiently. While \nusing this power, you double the number of Physical Traits you can \ngain through using blood. \nThroat Your voice is now terrifying, so much so that on a successful \nSocial Challenge all mortals must flee you for 10 minutes. Awakened \nbeings are down two Traits in any challenge involving you for the next 10 \nminutes if you beat them in a Social Challenge while using this power. \nFeet: By stamping your feet on the ground, you cause a tremor. All \nthose in your vicinity must win a Static Physical Challenge against \nyour Physical Traits or be knocked to the ground for one minute. \nTaking the Skin \nBy slaying a creature and expending a Mental Trait, you subsume the \nBeast-nature of your victim. Doing so allows you to transform yourself into \nthe creature for the remainder of the night. In order for this power to work, \nyour victim must be a preadator of some sort, and must have at least one \nBlood Trait’s worth of vitae - \nno ants or mosquitoes are permitted. \nUpon completion of the proper preparations, you transform physi- \ncally into your victim and gain its appearance, Physical Traits and \nabilities. (Note: The full effect only takes if the victim is a “natural” \ncreature. Taking the Skin of a Lupine or other vampire, for example, \nonly grants you the victim’s appearance.) \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nI- \nTaken Skins \nSome standard shapes taken for transformation include: \nShape \nTraits Gained \nOther Powers \nHawk: \nDextrous and Grucefd \nFlight \nLeopard: Quick x3 \nClaws capable of Aggravated Damage \nBear: \nResiliat x2, Tough, \nVipms \nOgham \nMaster \nDragon Lines \nBy spending a Willpower Trait, you can inscribe powerful runes \non your body, which becomes a channel for mystic energy for the \nduration of a single night. Once the power is in effect, you may spend \na Mental Trait to retest any challenge directed at you. The only \ncaveat is that your feet must be in contact with bare soil or uncarved \nstone at the time - \nflagstones or other trappings of civilization \nnegate this Discipline’s effects. \nInscribe the Forgotten Names \nYou now know the names of some of the monstrous beasts that \nonce walked the Earth, and by using their names you can summon \nthem to you. By succeeding in a Static Social challenge (difficulty at \nNarrator’s discretion - \ndragons should be much harder to conjure \nthan, say, an oracular pig) you can summon some mythic beast. The \nbeast’s powers and temperament are determined by the narrator. Just \nbecause you summon the creature doesn’t mean it’s necessarily freindly . \nFurthermore, you have no control over the creature you summon, so \nusing this power is risky at best. Inscribe the Forgotten Names may be \nused only once per session. \nDeimos \nMaster \nClutching the Shroud \nBy drinking the blood from a corpse you may access some of the \npowers of the Restless Dead. Once you have consumed five Blood Traits \nof dead blood, you may use that blood for one of the following purposes: \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nBlood Trait expended. This will let you see wraiths and any other \ndenizens of the Underworld, but will not give you the ability to \ncommunicate with them. \nYou have the ability to determine the relative health of anyone \nyou see, mimicking the ghostly ability Lifesight. While this power is in \neffect, others must tell you how many wounds they have and how many \nBlood Traits are currently in their systems. If you see a mortal, you are \nable to determine if he suffers from any disease or illness. You gain this \ninsight for 10 minutes per Blood Trait expended. \nThe last use of this power is the most visibly macabre. By \nexpending all five Blood Traits, your skin hardens as though under \nthe effects of rigor mortis. You are immune to wound penalties and \ngain the additional Physical Trait Resilient x 2 for the remainder of \nthe night. \nLilith’s Summons \nYour blood may now be smelled in the world of the dead. By \nspitting a Blood Trait on a target, you “mark” that target, causing \nSpectres to arrive and seek out the individual for their own unholy \nenjoyment. By spending a BloodTrait, you may also summon aspectre \nto you and communicate with it, though you do not gain any control \nover the Spectre called. For details on Spectres, see Oblivion. \nMortis \nMaster \nSense Death’s Imminence \nYou may now detect sudden ebbs of life energy when things die. By \nsucceeding in an Extended Static Mental Challenge versus a difficulty \ndetermined by the Narrator, you are able to discern the way death has \naffected places and people. \n1 success \n2 successes You are able to discern the basic cause of death. \n3 successes You know the general location and some minor \n4 successes You know the specific location and a very strong idea \n5 successes You can see through the eyes of death itself with \nYou may sense if death has occurred nearby. \nspecifics as to the cause of death. \nof the events that took place surrounding the death. \ncrystal clarity and know exactly what happened. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nPlague Wind \nSimilar to the Advanced power Black Death, you are now able \nto unlock the decay in everything around you. By touching a \ntarget and expending two Willpower Traits, you cause humans \nand animals to become infected with a deadly plague. The in- \nfected target takes one aggravated wound every 30 minutes until \ndeath occurs. Cainites thus infected must defeat you in a Mental \nChallenge or fall into torpor. Cainites who succeed will not \nsicken, but are now plague carriers and will spread the disease \nwhen they feed. Their “carrier” status lasts for the next three days. \nValeren \nMaster \nWarding the Beast (Healer) \nWith this power you are to pull the soul of another and take \nit into your own body, where powerful healing magic can be \nworked upon it. To activate this power you must defeat the \ntarget, if he is unwilling, in a Mental Challenge (though no \nchallenge is required to affect a willing target). Upon doing so \nyou are able to expend one temporary Willpower Trait to restore \na Trait of the soul’s Via rating. While you have control of the soul \nwithin you, the body is a mindless shell without motavation or \nfree will. If the body is destroyed the soul immediatly vanishes \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nand you automatically lower your Via rating by three. The souls \nof these Cainites become Spectres as described in MET: Oblivion. \nThis power will not work under the following conditions: the \ntarget has a Via rating of one, or is a follower of Via Diabolis. You \nmay only use this power once in the targets lifetime. T o  keep a \nsoul for too long is heinous and cruel. For every day past the first \nthat you keep the target’s soul in your body you must lower your \nVia rating by one. \nLoving Agony (Warrior) \nYour touch now causes pain and actual damage to your \nenemies. With the expenditure of a Willpower Trait (and a \nPhysical Challenge to touch your target if he is not immobile), \nyou may do one non-Aggravated wound per Blood Trait spent. \nDue to the unbearable pain, a Cainite that takes more wounds \nin this manner than he has Willpower Traits automatically \nenters frenzy. \nSafe Passage (Healer) \nSafe Passage is similar to the Presence power Majesty, but \nfunctions in a much more passive way. Someone who wishes to \nharm you must first defeat you in a Mental Challenge; if he fails, \nhe not only forgets why he was attempting to hurt you, but also \nfinds reasons to avoid you for the remainder of the evening. This \npower only works on casual acquaintances and strangers, as those \nwho know you well will be able to overcome the suggestion of \nnon-aggression. Once learned, this power is always active. \nAversion (Warrior) \nYou are now able to make others seem unlikeable. By touch- \ning the target and expending a Blood Trait, you grant him the \nfollowing Negative Traits for the remainder of the night: Repug- \nnant x 2 and Callous x 2. The victim must act out these Traits \nonce they have been installed, though he has no idea where they \ncame from. \nIn addition, you can use Aversion to get others to attack your \ntarget. At your discretion, you may engage in a Mental Chal- \nlenge with anyone you choose. If you win, you can ‘(suggest” that \nthe loser attack the target of Aversion. The “attacker” will \nrationalize assaulting the victim as her own idea, perhaps even \nmaking up a story for the sheriff about something the victim did \nto her. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nAm I able to spend a Willpower Trait to attempt to detect an \nObfuscated entity passing by? \nNo. You can’t use your Willpower Trait to negate the effects \nof the another’s Obfuscate. \nIs a character limited in the number of times she may spend \nWillpower (up to the character’s current maximum) to re-enter her body \nif someone with Necromancy successfully removes her soul from it? \nNo. Home is where the heart is (not to mention the liver, lungs, \nkidneys.. . ). \nCan I transfer my experience between characters? \nThe polite answer to this one is, “Are you out of your freakin’ \ngourd?” No, players may not transfer experience from character to \ncharacter! Jar1 the Gangrel learned his lesson that night; there’s no \nreason Winslow the Ventrue should benefit even if the same player \nstands behind both. The only time a Storyteller should allow a \nplayer to create a new character with experience to spend is in the \ncase of a “good death” - \nusually one accepted for the benefit of the \nchronicle as a whole. \nIf the character lived by her own code (the player portrayed her \nNature and Demeanor well), and the character went out in an \nappropriate fashion, the supervising Narrator may allow the player \nto apply that game’s experience award to her next character. These \nawards can’t be “saved up,” though, and once you have a bonus like \nthat on the books, you can’t gain another until the previous one is \nspent. Simply put, you can’t use multiple experience awards to \ncreate a godlike starting character. \nWhat is the maximum number of experience points I can gain? \nThis up to your individual troupe, but we recommend no more \nthan six experience points per month of fairly active gameplay. You \nshouldn’t be going from warm snack to elder too quickly, after all. \nWhat is the maximum amount of experience I can receive at one time? \nPlayers can receive up to three experience points per game \nHow does damage work in regard to causing Final Death? \nIf a Kindred suffers sufficient aggravated damage to reduce her \npast the “Torpor” Health Level, she dies the Final Death. Note that \nsession. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nall the damage she has suffered need not be aggravated; the last one \nis the one that matters. \nWhat is the range of Mental and Social Disciplines? \nAll Mental and Social Disciplines are limited to direct unaided \nline of sight (no bionoculars, periscopes, telescopes, etc.), unless \notherwise stated. Storytellers should, of course, feel free to play \nwith this limitation when the story demands. \nHow long do characters stay in torpor? \nOnce in torpor, characters sleep for two weeks per Beast/Path \nTrait they possess, though the sleep can be longer for older Cainites \n- \nanything that knocks a Methuseleh into torpor packs a helluva \nwallop. Vampires awakening from torpor do so in a state of blood \nfrenzy, and must feed immediately. \nHow often does my character replenish his Traits? \nPhysical, Social and Mental Traits are recovered in full after \nthe character has had at least eight hours of sleep. For gameplay \npurposes, this means the next night of play unless something goes \nhorribly wrong. \nHow long is a MET session? \nA session is defined as one period of play for a game of Mind’s \nEye Theatre, usually lasting for an evening. A story’s ending is \ndetermined by the Storyteller, though having four to six sessions \nper story is common. It is usually considered ended when the \nmajority of plot devices have been accomplished. When the rules \nstate that something is returned or replenished at the end of the \nstory, it is strictly a Storyteller decision as to when this occurs. \nMy vampire character has a Garou Fetish that requires Gnosis to \nactivate. Is there any way can 1 activate its powers? \nShort of giving it to a werewolf, no. \nCan non-Assamite blood wake Assamites from torpor? \nNo, it cannot. Non-Assamite vitae is poison to clan members, \nand if ingested into their system it causes damage as normal. \nAssamite antitribu blood can bring clan members out of torpor, but \nno other vampires’ blood can. \nCan Assamites commit diablerie ? \nNo, they cannot. Assamites gain no benefit from Kindred vitae \nwhatsoever. Only Assamite antitribu can commit traditional \ndiablerie. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nCan Nectar of the Bitter Rose be used multiple times from the same \nvictim (if a 13th-generation Kindred drinks dl five draughts from a \nseventh-generation victim, can he be lowered to eighth generation) ? \nAbsolutely not. One shot and then you’re done, kiddo. \nCan a blood draught from Nectar of the Bitter Rose be storedfor later \nconsumption? \nNo. The draught of blood must be consumed at the time of the \nritual or it goes rancid. \nMy character has Vicissitude. When will he get taken over by a \nSouleater? \nIt depends. If you think the Black Hand is full of it, Souleaters \naren’t a concern. \nIf you do believe in Souleaters, the answer is still “Never ever \never.’’ Souleaters are Narrator characters, and should never be \nhanded over to players. Characters with Vicissitude never metamor- \nphose into Souleaters unless the player relinquishes the character to \na Narrator. \nWhat Disciplines can be used while one is staked? \nNone. Having a stick through your sternum limits your flexibil- \nWhat Disciplines can be used in conjunction with Celerity? \nAnimalism: Embrace the Beast, Conquer the Beast \nFortitude: All \nPotence: All \nPresence: Majesty \nProtean: All \nSerpentis: The Serpent’s Tongue \nSpiritus: Aspect of the Beast, The Wildebeust, Spirit Form \nVicissitude: Horrid Form, Body Arsenal, Plasmic Form \nVisceratiku: S tonestrength, Rockheart \nNote: Plasmic Form may not be activated while one is using \nCelerity, but if it has already been activated, it may be used as normal. \nWhat is the effect of having zero (0) Blood Traits? \nFor Kindred, blood frenzy (assuming that you have the Hunger \nWhen a character learns Eyes of the Serpent do her eyes permanently \nity of response. \nBeast Trait). For mortals, revenants, ghouls and Garou, death. \nchange appearance? \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nNo. \nWhen I use Spiritus, Necromancy or Spirit Thaumaturgy, are the \nspirits summoned Umbral nature spirits or wraiths? \nSpiritus only summons Umbral nature spirits. Necromancy sum- \nmon wraiths. Spirit Thaumaturgy is usually used on Umbral spirits, \nbut may function on wraiths at the Storyteller’s option. \nLaws of the Night FAQ Clarifications \nIf the target of Beast Within does not have any Derangements, what \nhappens ? \nIf the target has no Derangements, then Beast Within affects \nBeast/Path Traits. If she has no Derangements or Beast/Path Traits, \nnothing happens. \nWhile using Possession, can I use the host body’s Disciplines? \nAll Physical Disciplines (Celerity, Fortitude, Potence, Vicissitude, \nViscerutika) stay with the body possessed and the possessor may use \nthem. All other Disciplines are linked to mental ability and knowl- \nedge, and as such, the possessor cannot use them. Of course, you can \ntake your mental Disciplines with you when you skip bodies. \nWhat happens when a Kindred with Majesty meets a Kindred with \nMajesty ? \nThe Kindred with the lower generation’s Majesty takes prece- \ndence. If both Kindred are of the same generation, their powers \ncancel one another out and they react normally. \nWhat happens if I am using Possession and the body I’m in is killed? \nIf you are currently possessing another Kindred, you die. If you \nare possessing a mortal (ghouls do count as mortal), you revert back \nto your normal body, minus half your current Willpower Traits. \nThese Traits are not lost permanently, and may be regained at a rate \nof one per night. \nSean Carter (order #19521)\n1\n\n\nMerits \nFlaWS \nBeast Traits I Path Traits \nwillpower \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  \no o o n n o o o o o  \nBlood \n0 0 0 0 0 0
