      "text": "WELCOME \nTOTHF MIND’S EYE THEATRE \nt \nJ o URNAL . \nHello again, everybody, and welcome to the fifth issue of the MET \nJournal; the first issue of the year 2000! If you’re reading these pages, chances \nare good that civilization didn’t actually come to an end when our computer- \nized clocks turned over at midnight January 1st. If it did end and you’re still \nreading, I applaud your dedication. For those of you who are new to the \npublication, let me take a second to acquaint you with just what you’ve got \nhere. (For those who’ve read this before, you may skip ahead to “Deadguy \nSpeaks.” If you do, however, you’ll miss the big news at the end.) \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gaps in \nyour White Wolf LARP environment. We offer rules for new character types, \noriginal story lines to work into your chronicles, guides for keeping your games \nunder control and running smoothly and rules updates you won’t find in any \nother Mind’s Eye release. Plus, you’ll find answers to the questions that have \nplagued you, original World of Darkness fiction and columns from people \nwho’ve been LARPing or working here at White Wolf (or both) for years. \nIn this issue, we take a look at the wraithly environment of the Great War \nera, the dying Bunyip of the Savage West and vampire Vikings known as the \neinherjur. And that’s just a sample of what’s in store for you here. We’ll also take \na look at what you’ve missed in previous issues (if you’re joining us late) and \nwhat to expect in thefutureofMind’sEyeTheatre and White Wolf ingeneral. \nIn future issues of the Journal, we’ll present some of the material that had \nto be left out of Laws of the East, tips on how to deal with character death.and \nsome expanded information on the hideous fomori. \nAnd you can help make the Journal even better. Send us letters on your \nopinions about the state of live-action roleplaying today. Send us questions \nabout the features and rules you see here, as well as notes about the broken rules \nyou come across in different MET publications. Send us horror stories about \ngames gone wrong and how your player characters fixed them. We’re interested \nin all aspects of live-action roleplaying, and we want to know what you think. \nStick around. The Journal is on the cutting edge of the live-action genre; \nwe’ve got something for everybody. And if we don’t have it yet, let us know. \nWe’ll get it for you. \nCurl Bowen, Developer \ncurl@white-wolf.com \nWhite Wolf \nAttn: Mind’s Eye Theutre J o u d  Developer \n735 Park North Blvd, Suite 128 \nClarkston, GA 30021 \nUSA \n"

      "text": "DFADCjUY SPFAKS \nYOUR \nE A N ~ S  \nARE R I ~ H T  \nPUR= \nby Richard Dansky \nI can’t dunce with them. I’m Toreador. They’re Nosferatu. \n- \nAn unnamed LARPer at the first ICC \nIt’s spring, and young LARPers thoughts are turning to love. Actually, as I’m writing \nthis it’s early fall and North Carolina is bilge-pumping its way out from under Hurricane \nFloyd’s drooling problem. So while I wait for the floodwaters to recede, now is as good a time \nas any to discuss something that’s been weighing on my mind for a while. \nOne of the most remarkable things about live-action roleplaying, and Mind’s Eye \nTheatre in particular, is that it is about as gender balanced as the roleplaying industry gets. \n(Yes, I know that there are exceptions to the rule out there, unfortunately they’re \nexceptions. Don’t write in with angry comments about your all-female Warhammer 40K \ngame. I’d be forced to post the letter, and then you’d be inundated with hordes of desperate \nguys who’d want to show you their Gorkamorkas). The sad fact of the matter is that people \nwho play hobby games are still predominantly male, despite a slow trend toward gender \nbalance over the last decade or so. The lone real exception to this slant toward the surging \nseas of testosterone is, strangely enough, live-action roleplaying. (And again, just because \nyour game doesn’t follow this trend doesn’t mean that it’s representative, honest - \nthere \nare plenty of other people out there who just aren’t as cool as you are.) Depending on whom \nyou ask, MET games average anywhere from 35% to 50% female, which is really remarkable \nfor an outgrowth of an industry whose stereotypical image is five guys huddling around a \ntable in someone’s parents’ basement. \nOf course, there’s been one unforeseen outgrowth of the fact that a growing number \nof women are using MET as their first tentative step into the gudgeon-infested waters of \nroleplaying. Namely, it’s that a growing number of women are using MET as their first \ntentative step into the gudgeon-infested waters of roleplaying, and the guys who were \nformerly lords of the game preserve have no idea what to do now that their game has been \ninfiltrated by (Gasp! Shudder!) gurn*ls. While most men who roleplay are genuinely glad \nto see more gender balance in their hobby - \nfor one thing, it cuts down on the number of \nheavily bearded bikers who are claiming to be waiflike Toreador named Mitzi - \nthere are \na few adjustments that have to be made by folks who just can’t get used to the notion that \nroleplaying isn’t just a boys’ club anymore. For one thing, they have to leave that dog-eared \ncopy of Cult of Ecstasy home instead of passing it around during Storyteller breaks. For \nanother, naming characters “Benjamin Dover,” “Richard Dover” and “Eileen Dover” is \nright out, as is spending endless hours trying to convince the Storyteller that you really do \nneed to create a Brothels Influence for your character because “he’s one bad mack daddy of \na vampire pimp who needs his hos.” (If the Storyteller is wise, he’ll flip the player in question \na box of ho-hos at this point, which often serves as a suitable distraction, as well as an in- \ngame prop that doesn’t violate the no-weapons policy.) \nThankfully, gender integration of a Mind’s Eye Theatre game usually flenses much of \nthe middle-school-level bathroom humor out of the game’s foundation (although not \nalways - \nthere’s inevitably some genius who thinks that he’s getting away with something \nbecause he’s given his Garou a name like “Licks-Own-Eyebrows”). Unfortunately, in \naddition to removing that particular flavor of idiocy, the growing gender-integration of \nLARPs brings with it an entirely new and terrifying problem. \nThat problem is romance, or the imagined possibility thereof. \n"

      "text": "I\n_\n \nform intended to dismiss the possibility ’or worthwhile nature of same-sex romance in the \nLARPing community. I will say, however, that this column concerns itself with the \nromantic entanglements arising from the influx of women into MET, which means we’re \nprimarily talking about those wacky breeders here. \nSeriously, let’s look at the situation. Roleplaying can become a profoundly intense \nactivity. Intense activities produce intense emotions, and seasoning the whole mess with \nhormones percolated by stylish costumes and low-cut dresses doesn’t help. The line between \na character’s feelings and a player’s feelings can get a trifle blurred, particularly when people \nindulge in romantic plot lines in an effort to make their games more adult. It can get tricky, \nto say the least. People mistake in-character feelings for out-of-character ones. Character \nconflicts can spill over into out-of-play relationships, or out-of-play squabbles can be \nbrought into play with disastrous consequences. Let’s face it, do you really want to be playing \nthe character your best friend’s SO decides to have an in-character affair with on the night \nthey have a big fight? Or how about seeing the gentleman who’s had a crush on your lady \nlove for months trying to initiate a romantic “plot” with her that just might be an attempt \nto get closer to her in preparation for making an actual play in real life? And let’s not even \nget into the possibility of a couple of players having a bitter breakup and splitting the game \ndown the middle. After all, Isaac’s friends don’t want to roleplay with Ginny’s friends, and \nGinny’s friends don’t want to roleplay with Isaac’s, and suddenly the Storyteller is running \ntwice as many games because her marvelous, tight-knit little LARP has been split in two. \nIn short, then, romantic entanglements gone wrong can wreak a world of harm on a \ngame. There are preventative measures that can be taken, of course. Warning players before \neach game to keep their in-game and out-of-game affairs separate at least makes them think \ntwice before trundling off for an “In-character nekkid Thaumaturgy lesson” in the broom \ncloset. Keeping an eye out for inappropriate behavior during games (yes, the “No Touching” \nrule applies even to consensual fondling of the one-eyed trouser snake, and don’t try to tell \nme it’s a “new kind of animal ghoul”) is also important. In addition, players should remember \nthat there’s a world of difference between playing a character who’s an unrepentant sexist (or \nworse) in-game and offending other players for real with that sort of behavior. At no point \nshould the verisimilitude of roleplaying take precedence over the very real concerns of the \npeople behind the characters. I don’t care if it’s “in character” to indulge in nonconsensual \nscenarios or the like. There are just some lines you don’t cross, even in a game situation. \nStill, once all of the minefields have been crossed and the potential tiger pits dodged, \nthere’s every chance that at any given game, a couple of folks are going to - \nfor lack of a \nbetter term - \nhook up. The concept makes a great deal of sense, actually. I mean, when a \nLARPer meets a LARPer a-comin’ through the rye (or the arts center or the basement of \nthe local YMCA or wherever), they’ve got astep up on any other potential relationship they \nmight have. After all, they’re already assured of being past the necessity of trying to explain \ntheir weird roleplaying hobby to a prospective sweetie. Even better, they’ve got at least one \nshared interest, not to mention a nigh-infinite source of cheap dates. There’s less chance \nthan usual that there’s going to be relationship strife over spending money on, say, \nroleplaying books rather than roses, and you can always explain away that case ofwandering \neye as the result of the Toreador clan weakness. (Note: Make sure you’re actually playing \na Toreador when you try that one. Otherwise, you’re liable to discover precisely how thick \nthe new edition of Laws of the Night is when your former sweetie makes you eat it.) \nStill, even with all of these advantages, there are still tremendous obstacles standing \nin the way of true MET romance. The LARPers themselves lovingly erect most of those \nobstacles, but then again, the course of true love ne’er did run smooth. In all honestly, where \n"

      "text": "LARP is concerned, the course of true love tends to stagger drunkenly and carom off the \noccasional wall, but even so, the point’s the same. It’s not easy. \nA big part of the problem is communication. After all, it’s hard enough to tell when \nsomeone’s attracted to you in real life. When you slather characters over that, the confusion \nfactor increases exponentially. Just to test this theory, the fine folks at White Wolf hooked \nelectrodes up to the cranium of a fresh-faced young male LARPer of more than standard \nattractiveness and then recorded his thoughts. What they got was quite enlightening: \n“She digs me. She really digs me. No, wait, she doesn’t dig me, she digs my character. \nGood thing I took Study as a Social Trait. Hmm. Maybe she really digs me. I dig her. Well, \nI dig her character. I haven’t actually met her. If she’s anything like her character, I would \ndig her, though. I wonder if she’s anything like her character. I wonder if she’s wondering \nif I’m anything like my character. I wonder if she’s wondering about my wondering about \nher wondering. She winked. I think her character digs me. I think I need to go sit in a dark \ncorner and shake for half an hour. I wonder if she digs shaking in dark comers.. ..” \nUnfortunately, the test subject’s head exploded at this point, and any further data was \nlost as the valiant researchers were forced to scrape his brains off the ceiling tiles lest they \nlose the deposit on the lab. The point, however, is clear. Communication on the ever- \ntouchy matter of attraction is extremely, extremely difficult even at the best of times. \n(In case you were wondering, by the way, she really did dig him, which is pretty much \na tribute to the poor kid’s remarkable personality. After all, no one looks all that studly with \nelectrodes sticking out of his brain.) \nWith that in mind, here are afew basic tips to make communication in matters like this \na bit more straightforward and prevent the loss of more perfectly innocent ceiling tiles. \nGuys, if a woman at the game says “Hi,” she means (and I know you’re not going to \nbelieve me when I say this, but trust me here) “hi.” She’s being polite. She’s making asocially \nacceptable greeting with the minimum number of syllables possible. She most emphatically \ndoes not mean “Shanghai me to your lair in the Scottish Highlands, you ravishing black- \nclad brute, and help me to raise a litter of sturdy little hellions to someday wear your adopted \nclan tartan.” Be thankful she’s actually using a spoken syllable, rather than a curt nod. The \nbest thing to do is to say “Hi” back. \nTrust me here. If she actually wants to hold a discussion with you or spend more time \nin your company, she’ll demonstrate it with (Gasp!) multi-syllabic words. However, if you \ntake a simple greeting as anything more than what it actually is, you instantly get yourself \nfiled under “DO Not Speak To, Even if the Fate of the Human Race Depends on It.” Don’t \nthink I’m kidding, either. Desperation is not an attractive personality trait, and seizing on \na simple greeting as an expression of a barely contained lascivious longing is pretty much \nequivalent to tattooing the word Desperate on your forehead, pectorals and inner thighs as \nfar as indicators go. \nHowever, gents, if you do respond in a manner that proves that you don’t think savoir \nfuire is the next town over from Perth Amboy, you might actually put yourself in a position \nto have a meaningful, interesting conversation. Mind you, that’s not the same as guarantee- \ning that you’ll be an irresistible studmuffin, but owning your own Lear Jet is about the only \nthing that can guarantee that. While you’re waiting for your first billion to accrue, though, \ndecent conversation with someone who thinks that you’re more highly evolved than a \nforaminifera isn’t necessarily too shabby. Besides, it can make a great starting point - \nit’s \nalways nice when the woman you’re interested in doesn’t automatically look at you like \nyou’re a month-old bowl of egg salad. \nOn the other hand, ladies, bear in mind that any gentleman worth his salt is desperately \ntrying to avoid looking, well, desperate. He’s going to do everything in his power to separate \n"

      "text": "himself from the drooling cape-clad hordes. Mostly, that translates to being willfully \nchivalrous above and beyond the call of duty. Because it would be the lizard-brained \nhorndog thing to do to notice when someone is expressing interest in him, your basic Decent \nGent is going to go out of his way not to notice when someone’s flashing the come*hither \nsign. It doesn’t matter if the sign is 40 feet tall and made of neon and depleted uranium; he’s \ngoing to make a manful, chivalrous effort not to notice it. \nUnfortunately, there’s no quick and easy way around that sort of deliberate self- \nflagellation. (Figurative, folks, it’s figurative. Put the riding crops down and relax.) The best \nthing to do is simply to open up a friendly conversation and let the poor boy’s own baser \ninstincts betray him. After all, it’s a lot easier to ask forgiveness than permission, and it’s a \nlot harder for even the most self-sacrificing LARPer to flog himself over his self-described \nboorish behavior when it’s bloody obvious that any expressed interest is mutual. \nOf course, the big mistake that most LARPers make when trying to win themselves \ndates is one that’s actually quite easy to avoid. Unfortunately, once the fake fangs go in, the \ncommon sense goes out, at least on this issue. Simply put, when it comes time to strut their \nbest stuff, entirely too many MET players instead chose to show how witty, talented, \npowerful and attractive their characters are. Now a man more snide than myself (if such a \nman exists) might say that this is why it’s really called fantasy roleplaying, but I think it’s \njust a matter of folks wanting to show off something they’re proud of. \nUnfortunately, there’s no easy way to say this: They Can’t Date Your Character \nInstead Of You. Ahem. Sorry about that, but it needed to be said. Seriously though, think \nabout it. Why on earth would you waste your time showing off how butch your character (the \npersonality you borrow on the occasional weekend) is, when you really want someone to be \ninterested in you? Sure, it’s fun to show off and tell war stories, but if you ever think your \ncharacter stands a better chance of going home from the game with company than you do, \nit’s time to stop working on advancing your character and start working on advancing \nyourself. \nThen again, getting the relationship going is only half the battle. Sustaining it in the \nface of overwhelming odds is the hard part. It’s a truism that one of the most attractive \nqualities aperson can have is to be attached. That means that the first game after aromantic \nconnection is established is liable to look like an outtake from the new Fox special, “World’s \nMost Desperate Swarms,” as newly interested parties of all genders and orientations descend \non the happy couple. The attention can be head turning, and God help the poor fool whose \nhead actually does get turned. If he’s lucky, he’ll just get slapped. If he’s not, he’ll suddenly \nacquire a reputation as a “LARP slut” that he won’t be able to remove with anything short \nof joining the Federal Witness Protection Program. \nOne of the most common strategies used to ward off the swarms of would-be paramours \nis exaggerated affectionate behavior. Technically known as “PDA,” or “Public Displays of \nAffection,” this technique includes (but is not limited to) cuddling, using of pet names even \nin character, game breaks for smooches and quickies in the broom closet. While this approach \ndefinitely lets the world know that someone is taken, it runs a definite risk. After all, there’s \nonly so much sickly sweet romanticism that immortal lords of the night can endure. After one \ntoo many “Sweeties” or “Snookylumpums,” other players might be willing to test the \nboundaries of the “no touching” rule with buckets of ice water. Conversely, they may mistake, \n“Get a tomb,” for, “Get a room,” and stake the cute couple just to shut them up. \nStill, excessive uses of Chill of the Windsaber can’t halt true love (although excessive \nPeter Cook imitations can come close). Every so often, luck, skill, devotion and love \ntriumph, and a couple of soul mates find each other through MET. If you are one of the lucky \nfew to find marital bliss with someone you met at a game, I just have one humble request \nfor you: \n"

He \nhas covered all manner of subjects fiom hunters to fomuri to the mysterious Shih. In \nthis story, Jim brings his considerable range to bear, showing us how the times may \nchange, but the things that make us who we are never do. \nIt’s cold here. But then, most places seem cold to me. \nI remember the warmth of the Valley of the Kings, and in comparison to the \nglory of the sun on the Nile, most places seem chilled and desolate. Kristin liked to \ncall me a romantic, but even after all these years, I fear I am merely a sentimentalist. \nI like to remember better times and warmer hearts than the ones I encounter in the \nmodem age. \nEven those few I can call fnends - \nthose whom I’ve encountered again and again \nover the centuries - \nseem to have lost the warmth and passion that once made them \nso vibrant and alive. Of my own kind, the Reborn, there are only a few I would even \nconsider speaking to. Even then, my association with them would be a courtesy, not \nbecause I care for them. We might fight for the same things, but we have nothing in \ncommon except a long-standing hatred for Set and his ilk. But even that dulls with time. \nThere was a time when I was more adventurous, more enthusiastic than I am \nthese days. I made many friends in that distant past and, from time to time, I still have \noccasion to meet with old acquaintances. \nAnd they too have grown colder, those few who were not taken by Death in the \ncourse of the last 5,000 years. Or perhaps it is I who have forgotten the passions of \nlife. I cannot judge the truth in these matters. I am simply not capable of deciphering \nthe facts from my memories. Sometimes the truth hides behind fond memories and \nother times it remains buried beneath the nightmares that have haunted me for as \nlong as I can remember. \nThe first time I met Kristin Breiner was one of the golden moments for me, one \nof those rare, almost magical times when I ran across a kindred spirit. I had never met \nanyone quite like her. However, at the time, I did not immediately realize that she \nwas in fact a woman. All I saw was the armor she wore, the weapons she carried and \nthe rage in her eyes as she struck down her foes in the name of the Christian god. She \nrode with the crusaders, tearing into Jerusalem with a fury that was admirable, and \na thirst for blood that was terrifying. \nI was in Jerusalem, visiting with another of my kind whom I had last seena lifetime \nago, when the Christians came to claim the city as their own. Their righteous \nindignation was real in some cases, but in others it was obviously a simple veil to \nobscure the greed with which they came to plunder what they had no legitimate claim \nto. Greed. It’s always there, always waiting to suck the minds and morals away from \nanyone who dares get too close and make even the most civilized of us revert to \nbarbarism. Greed may die in individuals, but it lives on in the human spirit. \n"

The fae vanished from the world and took with them the best parts of the past. \nThey left behind a world filled with bitter, frustrated souls looking to lash out and \nreturn the pain and loss they experienced. \nThose souls were very successful in spreading the misery and woe around for all \nto share. And the force that held these opposing forces apart, cementing them as \nenemies and fueling their passion for blood and death was the name that almost \nalways seems to drive mortals to such extremes. Religion was the culprit. \nThe year was 1099, I believe, and the Crusaders came into the city with a battle \ncry that must surely have echoed through every comer of the world. Their hatred of \nthe Muslims was a living, seething thing, and the greed that drove them was at least \nas vile. They swarmed through the city, killing anyone - \nregardless of age, sex or \nreligious conviction - \nas if their sole purpose was to free the Christians within the \ncity. I found it rather odd that these saviors came without request and killed the very \nChristians they’d allegedly come to save along with the rest of the people living in \nthe place they all claimed was holy. \nFor their part, I suspect they found it odd that I did not flee. Kristin certainly \ndid. She approached me on her black charger with drawn, bloody sword, ready to \ncut me down where I stood, but all I did was look at her. I had already killed several \nof the Crusaders who were not wise enough to leave me in peace. I am short in \nstature, but even then, I had already spent hundreds of years learning to defend \nmyself from attackers. \nI suppose she could have killedme then, but she chose not to. Instead, she looked \ninto my eyes and recognized me for what I was. She saw that I, like her, was not quite \nhuman. For my part, I saw only the faintest hint of eyes beneath the helmet she wore, \na great visored thing that must surely have been too large for her. \n“Why don’t you run?” she asked me, her voice hoarse from endless battle cries. \n“Why don’t you attack?” was my simple answer. \nShe had to think about that one. Certainly, a great number of people had fallen \nvictim to her sword in the nights before. The streets themselves were sticky with the \nblood of the slain, and their heads often adorned the walls surrounding the city. How \nodd it must have seemed to her that I, far smaller than the average person, was not \namong the dead. It was obvious that I’d made no attempt to hide myself. Finally, she \nlaughed and shook her head, taking her helmet off and looking at me with eyes as \nbright as the noonday sun. “Because you are braver than you should be, or more \nfoolish than most. Either way, stranger, you are not mine to take.” \nI thanked her for her kindness. She knew as well as I did that the thanks was as \nmocking as the courtesy she afforded me. She laughed again, a soft, melodic sound \nfrom so savage a warrior. And in that moment I knew I’d found a kindred spirit, \nanother who had seen too much and done too much in a very short time. She asked \nme if I was a Follower of Set, and in a return of her earlier courtesy, I merelv said no \n"

That, or the simple fact that I had long ago grown tired of killing anyone \nwho inadvertently offended me. Before the night was over, we had become.. . if not \nfriends, at least friendly acquaintances. \nWe spoke of many things through the course of that long night. We spoke of \nthe differences between her people and mine. We talked of the changing face of the \nworld, a place that was not as calm as either of us would have liked. In the end, we \nspoke of the mortals we’d known and cared for who had faded from our lives, stolen \nfrom us by the sands of time. She had watched from a distance as her son grew old \nand died. She did not want him to know of her new existence. I spoke of my beloved \nwife and her death at the hands of Set himself. We talked of philosophies and \nreligious beliefs. We conversed on the strange ways in which the world had changed \nsince each of us had become something other than mortal. She listened when I spoke \nof the long-gone glory days of my homeland, Khem. I, in turn, listened to the tale of \nhow she had become what she now was, and how the years had changed her \nperceptions. I heard her talk of another of her kind, one she only called the Reaver, \nand her long-standing personal war with him. She did not tell me why they fought, \nand I did not ask. It’s possible that she did not even remember any more. \nJust before the sun rose, she bid me farewell and warned me to leave Jerusalem. \nWhile she had been willing to spare me, there were others who would not think twice \nof destroying me, and there were some whose power even one such as she had reason \nto fear. \nI wished her well and left Jerusalem behind. My fellow Reborn, with whom I had \nalready finished my business, had left days before, puzzled by my need to stay and \nwatch the violence that had come to that holy city. I could not have explained the \nneed myself; I only knew it was real. I only understood that the violence and \ndestruction should be wimessed by someone who was not involved in its making. \nWitnessed and remembered. \n... \nHow many years was it before I saw Kristin again?More than I care to remember, \nand I am far too lazy to count them. Suffice to say, the world had moved on again \nbefore we ran across each other. The Renaissance was in full bloom by then. The \nwealthy poured their monies into employing artists to glorify their homes, and they \nworked behind the scenes to kill each other with greater subtlety than I’d have ever \nimagined the Europeans would achieve. The sciences were doing their best to push \nreligions and faith to the side. They were gaining ground, but it was a slow, painful \nprocess. The de Medici’s were throwing yet another party, and I was their special \nguest. I was someone to show off to their friends, an educated man from the place they \ncalled Egypt, which was, by that time, something of a rarity. \nThey meant me to be their pet for the duration of their interest. It is remarkably \neasy to forgive both ignorance and avarice when you know you will be alive long after \nthe fools who show it are forgotten. I forgave the powers of that era many sins. I had \nseen them all before when they wore different clothes. Time teaches us to tolerate \nthe brutish and short dreams of human life as it forces us to witness them again and \nagain and again. \nStill, even my patience was being tested by the time the slim, pale hand touched \nmy skin.

The face I had last seen covered in soot and blood was clean and \nheavily painted with make up. Still, she had lost none ofher intensity. I must confess \nto being a bit surprised that she recognized me. I have never considered myself a \nremarkable or striking figure. Yet, she had seen me across a crowded room and made \nher way to my side in a matter of minutes. \nAs I said before, the party had grown boring for me, and my hosts had lost \ninterest in what I was doing. We moved away from their palatial estates and through \nthe streets of Florence. She was dressed in finery that made it hard for me to believe \nshe had once been a crusader, but then, I was hardly dressed as a follower of the \nShemsu-heru philosophies myself. \nWe spent a week together. Every night we talked and debated about the changes \nthat had taken place in the world since last we met. To her way of thinking, the \nchanges were all for the better. To me, they merely reflected the intellectual growth \nof a society finally moving from childhood into puberty. Surely, the power of the \nChurch was as great as ever, and from her own perspective, the time of her people \nbeing feared had faded to distant memory. How then could this be progress? \nI wish I could explain how hard it is to find an intellectual equal when you are \nimmortal. You might find sharp, even brilliant minds among the mortals, but \ndiscussing matters of significance with them is rather like debating the importance \nof the world’s economy with a prepubescent. They might grasp the concepts of the \ndiscussion, they might even get the general ideas you are approaching and find them \ninsightful, but they lack the experience to truly comprehend the nuances of the \nconversation. Spending that week with Kristin made me realize how lonely 1 was for \ntrue companionship. And although neither of us had planned it, before our time \ntogether was over we had become lovers. Of a sort. \nKristin had to move on. She meant her time in Florence to be brief, and the \nReaver, whom she had once pursued, now returned the favor with a ferocious \ndetermination. Again, I refused to ask about him for fear of invading Kristin’s \nprivacy. Perhaps I should have said something or become involved sooner, but she \nmade it clear that such was not my place. \nNonetheless, she had plans of her own, back in her homelands of Austria. I too \nwould be leaving soon, as I had been feeling the siren call of Khem in my heart for \nmany months and been weakening in my resolve never to return to the place where \nI was born. I could no longer even remember why I had chosen to stay away from \nEgypt for all time. And there were matters I had to attend to that she, despite her \nwisdom, could never know about - \njust as surely as there were events in her life that \nwere beyond my comprehension. Although we had been intimate, although we had \nsurely become friends, we still had our secrets from each other. We are, after all, from \ntwo breeds that believe in the power of secrets. \nI have often looked back on that time with a fondness that is almost unsettling. \nTo scan back over the years and reflect on a few chance encounters is unnerving in \nlight of the centuries I have walked the earth. We resolved to remain in contact, and \nas so often happens, we let the strength of our resolution falter as the decades moved \npast. The friends we think we can never live without, the loves who make our world \nbright and keep us safe from our personal demons fade to dim reminders of a time \n"

Love and friendship, it seems to me, are capable of \nmaking even the worst possible situations seem not only survivable, but pleasant. I \nmention this merely to make a point. In my long, long life, I have only ever had a \nhandful of friends. Of all of them, only Kristin remained constant. \nYet, when we met again, we did so as enemies. \n* e *  \nI had moved to the New World. I traveled through the lands that had never \nbeen known to exist during my first life, and 1 gathered information along the way. \nI spent almost 40 years in the region called Mexico, and during that time I \nlearned things I had never expected to learn from the native Reborn - \nwho called \nthemselves the Xibabla, a name I have long since adopted for them. \nI met two others like myself. One was a vile creature, filled with hatred and \nsadistic glee. The other was a woman of rare beauty who learned of my people as I \nlearned of hers. It was in her defense that I warred against the vampires coming from \nthe north, spilling into the region like vermin. The strange part about it was that we \ndidn’t realize it was the vampires moving into the area. They are subtle creatures \nwhen the need arises, and we foolishly thought it was only the citizens of the United \nStates doing what they could to conquer still more land for their endless appetite. \nI had seen greed often enough, I thought, to recognize its new attire. \nWe learned the error of our ways quickly enough. The vampires were indeed \ninvading, and they were warring amongst themselves. What we’d thought was a \nsimple expansionist movement was actually a civil war. Those of the undead who \nwanted to live in harmony with humans fought against those who wanted to raise \nhumans as cattle and slaughter them freely. In all honesty, we had trouble tellingone \ngroup from another. \nI suppose it was simple naivete that made me believe that a continent with so \nfew people would actually be big enough to make wars a thing of the past. The \nindigenous tribes already peopled the “New World.” The Europeans who came into \nthe area weren’t happy to find more of the “godless” heathens in their way. Even 300 \nor more years after the land had been discovered in the first place, there were still \nplenty of good “God-fearing Christians’’ who wanted to convert the ignorant masses \nto the their way of thinking. It didn’t matter that the very people they wished to \neducate had already been converted centuries before. It only mattered that they be \ntaught the error of their ways.. . and that they be willing to accept their new teachers \nas landlords. Centuries, millennia had passed since I was Reborn, but this did not \nchange: the greedy still used religion as an excuse to commit atrocities. The \nCrusades, the Inquisition and now the pioneers and their Manifest Destiny. I didn’t \nmean to be amused by the whole sordid business, but I was just the same. \nI wasn’t laughing when they attacked the hacienda where I was staying. I didn’t \nlaugh at all when they burned my home to the ground and destroyed many precious \nartifacts from my distant past. My home was destroyed, and I was dragged behind a \nhorse for several miles before they cut me loose. If I’d been a mortal, I’d have surely \ndied. As I had a few magicsof my own, I was saved that inconvenience. I was scraped, \nbloodied and left for dead. In retrospect, I realized why they had attacked me.

The pioneers considered me just \nanother impediment to their “progress.” \nIn short, they made a very bad mistake. \nI do not seek conflict very often, but when I do, I make my presence very well \nknown indeed. Just as I’d spent hundreds of years learning to defend myself, I’d spent \ncenturies learning how to fight and to kill. Over the centuries I’ve learned a few tricks \nabout tracking down a foe. My enemies learned the hard way that I am unforgiving \nto a fault when the mood strikes me. It is not a skill I sought, but I acquired it \nnonetheless, like a taste for something vile and unexpected. \nOver the course of a week, I hunted them down and killed them from the \nshadows, until, at last, I was left with the two who were not human. I resorted to older \ntactics when I realized how little damage the bullets from my rifle did to them. I used \na hunting bow and arrows. The first of them dropped easily, impaled on an arrow that \nran through his back and cut deeply into his heart. He was not dead, but he would \nbe before I was finished. \nThat’s when she hit me from behind. Kristin used the very same tactics I had \nused to hunt down her party to hunt me down. She tracked me by my footprints, and \nshe attacked when I was busy preparing her friend for the dawn’s first light. As I was \ntying his body in a spot where the sun would find him, she shot me in the back. \nI lay dying on the ground berating myself for my foolhardy arrogance. I took the \npain as a lesson for my next incarnation. When I opened my eyes to breathe my last, \nKristin stared into my face. Her cold blue eyes spilled tears of crimson grief upon me, \nand she held my body close as I passed beyond the mortal realms. My heart broke to \nrecognize my killer, and in my last accusing glare, I saw her wither and recoil. She \nknew what she had done, and for the first time in many years, I made her feel guilty. \nI did not know the extent of her involvement in what her men did to me, but that \ndid not matter. \nI did not stay dead. My kind almost never does. Kristin knew that much, and \nshe did her best to make my return to the living a comfortable matter. I was buried \nin a tomb above ground rather than in a deep hole. With my body she left three \npounds of gold and a simple note that read, ‘‘I am so very sorry. I have missed you over \nthe years. Please forgive me, K.” \nI forgave her. In killing me, it’s just possible that she saved my sanity. I had fallen \ninto the very trap that I saw so many others fall into, you see. I had not truly sought \nretribution for what had happened to my home or my possessions. I had settled into \nthe very habits and small-minded pettiness that humans have indulged in since my \nmortal days. Even though I am so much more than they, I had fallen to their level. \nI had hunted down and killed a dozen people in order to gain satisfaction. Was I then \nany better than the Crusaders I condemned? Or the expansionists who used religion \nas an excuse to take what they wanted? \nNo. I was foolish and filled with pride. I was offended that they would dare \ninconvenience me. They took material possessions from me, and in return, I took \nthat most sacred of possessions from them, their very lives. I have always tried to \nremember that what I sometimes see as a curse is also a blessing. Even if I am killed, \nit is only an inconvenience. I will recover; I will go on. \n"

To do otherwise in an existence devoid of anything lasting that is truly good \nwould be worse than foolish. \n* a *  \nWe met again in the next century, sooner than I’d anticipated. I remained in \nthe New World and eventually located in California. The heat of the desert sun was \ncomforting. Even after years and centuries away from the warmth of the Nile, I still \npreferred the warmth of the barren places and the heat that Ra shone down upon me \nin such locales. Los Angeles was a melting pot even back then. Despite the growing \nwar in Europe, the people of the United States were still optimistic. They remained \ncertain that the Kaiser would be defeated and that the beliefs of their young country \nwould be upheld. The war was nothing new. The optimism of the young and far- \nremoved was nothing new either. All that had changed was the setting and the \ncostumes. \nI found Kristin that time, instead of her finding me. She was in a bar singing \nsongs for a crowd that was getting uglier by the minute. It seems that despite having \nchanged her last name to Williams, someone somewhere had learned of her \nGermanic origins. That was enough to cause her grief. Even the fact that she had \napparently owned the club and had been a popular local figure in Los Angeles for \nyears by that point did not matter. \nShe was dressed in a dark blue gown, and her voice carried across the room, lifted \nby angels one could almost believe, as I could hear her singing even in the farthest \ncorners of the hidden den of delights. I watched her, studied her and remembered our \nprevious encounters. We had met three times, and each of those encounters \nremained with me. Odd though it sounds, I still felt a connection with her, a desire \nto be near her. In a world of revolving constants, she was a familiar landmark that \nI was actually glad to see again. \nI went into the nightclub every night to hear her sing, and I wondered if I would \never get up the courage to make my presence known. One of the many tricks I learned \nin Mexico from the strange Reborn I met there was how to hide my true face. That \nwas a talent that saved me from many a conflict over the years, and one I still employ \nregularly. Unless one can see past the extra foot of height and the change in eye hair \nand skin color, one can’t easily see any connection between the person I become and \nthe person I am. If Kristin had that talent, she hid it well. \nI had finally decided to let her see me for who I am when the fight erupted. \nKristin was between sets, talking to a couple of rather drunken mortals when one of \nthem decided to have his way with her right there in the bar. Kristin very calmly \nknocked him unconscious. That was when the trouble began. The fool had friends, \nand they did not take well to his injury, despite the fact that he had brought it on \nhimself. \nI realized another sad fact about human nature at that moment. Religion is not \nthe only excuse used when battle is in the air. There are always other justifications. \nAlthough the US was not yet at war with Germany, everyone knew that it was only \na matter of time before they stepped into the whole sordid affair. The louts in the bar \nwere no exception. There were comments made about Kristin being an agent of the \nKaiser, and then there were noises about her being a spy. \n"

All that any of the fools cared about was showing their dissatisfaction with \nthe woman who’d injured their cohort. The political accusations merely gave them \nan excuse to assault her. Their actions gave me an excuse to come to her defense. \nOh, I know she didn’t need my help. I had seen her in Jerusalem, I knew full well \nthe sheer carnage she was capable of. Still, I moved to her aid just the same, and \nthrashed the three of them soundly. All the while, Kristin looked on with a mixture \nof gratitude and amusement. Afterward, Kristin took my advice and left with me, \nonly discovering after the fact that I was an old acquaintance. \nOnce again we talked of the past - \na situation made more awkward by her \ncontinued insistence on apologizing for killing me. For a change, we actually spent \ntime together. Really spent time together. We lived in comfort with each other for \nalmost 15 years. However, it seems such bliss as I knew at that time wasn’t meant to \nlast. I died again, taken by a gun, when a man desperate to drink the poorly made \nliquors of the time decided that my money was best for getting him inebriated. He \ndidn’t even try to rob me before he shot me. I still remember the stench coming from \nhis body as he pulled my wallet from by jacket pocket. I still remember the look on \nhis face when he found I carried a great deal of cash. He looked triumphant. If there \nwas guilt in his soul, it did not show. However, as I made my return, something about \nthe man’s attack comforted me. He had made no excuses for his action. He had not \ndressed up his greed in ill-fitting self-righteousness. I almost wish he had had a \nchance to spend the money he took from me. His honesty was refreshing. \nHow can I possibly know what he did with the money? That is easy enough to \nexplain. Kristin left me another note. It remained in my jacket pocket along with \n$500.00 for when I once again crawled back to the land of the living from the darkness \nof the afterlife. Once again she’d been forced to leave. Her note spoke of the Reaver \ncoming for her again. I didn’t know who the Reaver was, or why he pursued her so \nfanatically, but I knew I hated him. Twice he’d separated us. That was two times too \nmany. But beneath that dull hatred, I knew that I was fooling myself once again. I did \nnot hate this Reaver because he tormented the one I loved. I hated him because I was \njealous of him. In his enmity, he shared with Kristin something to which I was not \nprivy. She never spoke of why the Reaver made her his enemy, and that secret built \na wall between us. I wonder now if she even realized that it was there.. .. \n0 . .  \nI was without her for more years than I care to think about. By the time World \nWar I1 had come around, Kristin was back in Europe, dealing with other members \nof her clan and enmeshing herself in the world of vampiric politics again. To this day \nI do not understand those politics. I don’t really want to comprehend them. They are \nnot a part of my world. They could have been once, but Kristin saw that such was \nnot to be. That was another part of her existence she kept secret. \nWe met again last week. Kristin was in Washington D.C. for reasons I do not \nyet know and may never have a chance to understand. She looked me up in the \nphone book. After we exchanged pleasantries, we agreed to meet and talk.

When you measure your life in centuries, it is difficult to know if \nthe emotions you feel are real or if they are only habits and rote.

Their lives are \ntoo short to give them the necessary perspective. Ones like Kristin and I have that \nperspective. And yet, even Kristin’s existence will end one night.

Like myself, she remains a pleasant constant in a world caught in a \nstagnant cycle. While she never changes, I can recognize that without the disap- \npointment I feel when I see that the humanity all around her has not changed as well. \nI do not expect her to change like I keep expecting humanity to change. \nI should leave her soon.

I need to get away from that which is \nfamiliar and comfortable. I need to proceed. I have to move on just as the world tries \nto move on. People do not change, but perhaps I can. I have the perspective to \nbecome something more. I will leave Kristin in the morning, once I have said a \nproper goodbye. \nOr perhaps the morning after that.. .

The \nholmgang is a strict one-on-one duel with limited weapons and no active Discipline \nuse. The two involved parties stand within weapon range, and the accused takes \nthe first swing. The two trade blows until one of them collapses, surrenders or dies. \nThe winner is the last one standing. \nThe einvigi is a more traditional duel in which the opponents are allowed to \nuse armor and weapons of any type. The combatants fight it out in a circle of their \ncomrades, who usually cheer them on and shove them back into the fight if they \ntry to stray too far. Occasionally, there are rules - \nonly three shields, bare hands, \nno swords, etc. -but \notherwise this type of duel is truly unlimited. \nSOCIETY \nNorse society has a loose hierarchy, with plenty of possibility for advancement \n(and descent). There are effectively three levels to the society: Thralls were at the \nbottom, jmls were at the top, and the freemen were in between. A jurl is effectively \nany Norse leader powerful enough and rich enough to maintain a hall and table for \nhis followers. A powerful jurl, with many halls under his control, could even earn \nthe title of King. Thr& are the slaves or bondsmen who serve the jml. Einhqurjurls \ntook prisoners captured in raids for a herd, and these slaves did the drudge-work of \nthe Norse. If a freeman orjarl was to fall on hard times, he might voluntarily become \na thrall, to ensure himself of a meal and roof. \nFreemen make up the bulk of Norse society. Freemen are the warrior farmers \nand fishermen who follow the jurls and mix trading, raiding and harvesting in equal \nparts. Freemen sworn to a jurl become huskurls, the dedicated warriors of the hall. \nThese men and women are free from the responsibility to farm. Instead, they are \nexpected only to fight when their jart commands. This position is an honored one, \nand it is the goal of many young warriors to achieve it. \nNorse society treats women as different, but equal. While there are gender- \nroles, the Norse take a pragmatic view. Women hold the keys to the hall, and they \noften direct the work of the farm or enclave. Occasionally, a woman can even \nbecome a jurl, leading the warriors of her clan on raids and expeditions. Before \ntaking action, ajurl or warrior will consult with the women. \nOutside the normal status ofNorse society are the Outlaws (or vurgr) and the \nBerserks. Einheqnr Berserks are the warriors dedicated to drawing on the Beast to \nrage in battle and destroy their enemies. They eschew armor and work themselves \nto a high anger before a battle. This frenzy allows them to accomplish amazing feats, \nand many fear the Berserks - \nfriend and foe. The vurgr are individuals banished \nfrom Norse society (and in some case, even the clan) to fend for themselves in the \nwilds. Some umgr band together to form bandit groups to prey on merchants. \nOthers sign on with vampire crews to escape the dangers of the wilds. \n"

Or, to flip matters, \nthe Norse vampires raid into Europe, threatening the holdings of the Church or \nnobles in aquest for plunder. The conflict here is between the old ways of the Norse \nand the new ways of Europe, and it is a good way to introduce the Norse into an \nexisting chronicle. \nRESCUE MISSION? \nAs the result of one of the Norse raids, perhaps an important character falls \ninto the hands of theeinhqar who hold her for ransom.

The two groups clash over matters of faith, predestination and \ninteraction with the mortals on whom they prey. Neither side is inherently more \n“right” or justified in its actions than the other, and both types of vampires are \ndriven by compelling motivations. \nRULES \nSetting a game in the High North means taking into account a variety of local \nfactors. During the winter, the temperatures drop and the night gets progressively \nlonger. At the same time, the mortals will hide themselves behind the doors of their \nhalls. The summer will see days that seem to last forever and the migration of many \nNorse vampires to the south. \nA vampire begins each session down a Blood Trait, as normal, despite the \nextended length of the night. Keep in mind the fact that a night is longer during \nwinter and vampires will be capable of more activity. Hunting tests during the \nwinter requires twice as much work, since prey is harder to find. \nIn the summer, the night gets shorter and shorter. A possible way to reflect this \nproperty in the game would be to have a session represent more than one evening. \nDuring the summer, a vampire finds it more difficult to accomplish tasks since the \nsun rises sooner. \nAT SEA \nIf the game is to include sea travel, it is recommended that a room or area be \ndesignated as the “ship.” Storytellers can limit access to the ship, considering its \noverall size (a drakkar longship can carry up to 50 or so people; a knorr trade ship \n"

      "text": "TAKING \nTHE EINALTRAIL: USING \nBUNYIP \nIN \nTHE SAVAGE \nWEST \nAdding Bunyip characters presents more of a challenge than most Storytellers \nrealize when they first develop their chronicle concept. While breathing life into \nthe tragedy that faces members of this dying breed should be a theme in any story \ninvolving the Bunyip, there are a dozen other matters which deviate from the \nstandard Garou experience and require some extra consideration on the Storyteller’s \npart to really portray well. Here’s a rundown of the important plot considerations \nto bear in mind when using the elusive thylacine shapeshifters: \ns ow DID THEY 9e-r HERE? \nThis material assumes that most games are taking place in the Savage West, \nwith the Bunyip characters as the exotic minority. Handling games actually set in \nAustralia is covered later. Very, very few Bunyip have been born in the Savage \nWest, so start with the simple logistical questions. Even today, travel from \nAustralia to North America requires a large expenditure of time and effort - \nin \nthe days of the Savage West, the trip was much more grueling. How did the \ncharacter make the journey? Did anyone come with him or meet him when he \narrived? Does he still owe anyone for his passage, or is he in the country free and \nclear? \nA Moon Bridge is another possible means of transportation, perhaps, but the \nSavage West is enemy territory as far as the Bunyip are concerned, which makes \nit unlikely they’d be able to enter a caern openly without serious repercussions. The \nimportant thing is to make sure the passage is memorable in some way. No Bunyip \nsimply arrives in the Savage West. There should always be a story involved. \nOnce you’ve established the greater means of getting the character into the \nplot, work on why the Bunyip would choose to live in the area in which the \nchronicle is going to be set. Few things kill a good story faster than having a well- \ndetailed setting and absolutely no reason for the characters to remain there other \nthan “it’s where everyone starts out.” Bunyip in particular seldom get tied down to \na particular location unless some truly pressing reason exists for them to stay. Such \nis doubly true if a lot of Garou from tribes normally hostile to the Bunyip are found \nin the area. However, there are a few common reasons a Bunyip could find an area \nworth investing himself in. \nSensitive as they are, the turmoil in the Storm Umbra affects Bunyip deeply, \nand it could provide any number of story hooks. Their talent with the spirit world \ngoes a long way toward making even the most reluctant of European Garou \nrecognize their value in dealing with this growing threat. The Bunyip may also be \nsearching for something in the area, such as a fetish that’s beenstolen or a European \nupon whom they seek vengeance for some past misdeed. Quest motives work well, \nbecause they not only supply a means of explaining how and why a character \narrived in a location, but they also give that character freedom to travel if the \nchronicle decides to shift settings later on. \nOfcourse, simple friendship is perhaps the strongest motive of all. Chances are \ngood that a Bunyip character will at least befriend a local pack, if not join it \noutright, and few Bunyip would leave behind agroup of Garou who understand and \n"

The trials, both \nwithin and without, that such characters would have to endure to preserve such a \nforeign bond would be monumental. The stories gained from such struggles have \nthe potential to be great indeed. \nCOMMON \nTHEMES \nAlthough many of them have been touched on here and there so far, it bears \nstressing and repeating that games involving the Bunyip should always contain at \nleast a measure of some essential themes. The first and most obvious of these \nthemes is the archetypal “stranger in a strange land” theme. If the Bunyip simply \nseem like Garou with pouches and funny accents, then there’s something deeply \nwrong. Every story a Bunyip appears in should add some element of the exotic to \nthe game: Normal Garou re-evaluate their beliefs based on the behavior of the \nstrange outsiders, and the Bunyip learn more about the Europeans and their bizarre \ncustoms. \nOf course, the Bunyip need not behave like she’s on her way to toss a bottle \noff the edge of the world every time she runs into ‘(civilization.” A n y  Bunyip \ncunning enough to survive in the Savage West quickly learns what’s expected by \nthose around her, even if she doesn’t agree with it. However, Bunyip have been \nraised within a very different paradigm than even most Pure One Garou, and this \ndifference should be reflected in ways both large and small throughout the game. \nThe second most prevalent theme is “hope versus desperation.” While the \nbattle of the Garou is growing more challenging all the time, the Bunyip have \nalready passed the edge of desperation and are fighting with all their might to hang \non to even the tiniest shreds of hope. Bunyip stories should always contain \nelements of this precarious state. All periods of action are that much more intense, \nedged with a sense of manic determination to make a difference. Even the lightest \nsocial interludes can never completely escape the shadow of loss that darkens the \nheart of the Bunyip. \nFinally, particularly inspired and far-seeing Storytellers can also use the \nBunyip to create a theme of dark prophecy, giving the Garou an ominous taste of \nthe future they’re creating with their own foolish pride. If the game involvesmostly \nBunyip characters (a truly special circumstance), the theme of bitter omens and \nthe dark harvest the Garou are sowing can simply be seen from the other side for \na change. The characters must struggle to make a difference in the time remaining \nand perhaps even pass on some kind of legacy before the void swallows them at last. \nHey, nobody said the Bunyip always have to be good guys! There are plenty \nof Bunyip out there who are more than willing to commit an atrocity or two to \navenge the deaths of their kin. As time passes and extinction approaches, many \nBunyip care little for their own lives, as long as they’re paid for in the blood of their \npersecutors. Storytellers who wish to use Bunyip as villains in their game add an \ninteresting antagonist to their repertoire. Unlike many typical villains in the \nSavage West, Bunyip don’t put much stock in toe-to-toe slugfests. They prefer to \nuse ambushes and guerrilla raids to harass and demoralize their enemy. What’s \nmore, since they work alone or in small groups, Bunyip are even more cautious than \nveteran Pure One scouts.

Storytellers are \nencouraged to play up the menace and cunning of the Bunyip as much as possible, \nand never let the characters feel entirely comfortable as long as the Bunyip are \nstalking them. \nOf course, to gain the full value of the Bunyip as antagonists, the tragic angle \nof the conflict must be preserved as well. No matter what one side did to provoke \nthe other, the ultimate result is Breed pitted against Breed in a world that needs all \nthe defenders it can find, with one whole Breed eventually driven to extinction in \nthe end. Characters who care to learn even a whit about their Bunyip foes may soon \nfiid themselves questioning their elders and perhaps even siding with the op- \npressed shapechangers in some fashion. Even if the Bunyip are presented simply as \nsavage killers who attack an innocent pack or settlement, the underlying bitter \nirony should never be allowed to escape the characters entirely. In the white-hat/ \nblack-hat politics of the Savage West, it’s easy to dismiss the villains as heartless, \nremorseless monsters and thereby justify nearly any action on the part of the \ncharacters as “heroic.” After all, when one’s traditional racial enemy is the \nmetaphysical embodiment of all the physical and spiritual decay in the universe, \nit’s pretty easy to tell who the good guys are. But when the enemies are others like \nthe characters themselves, with many of the same hopes and dreams, and from a \nsociety whose recent history has been nothing but bloodshed and betrayal at the \nhands of the character’s own society.. .. There lies the material for some truly \ngripping, emotionally charged stories. \nGUNSLIN~IN’ DOWN UNDER \nOf course, the game can always put the shoe on the other foot and be set \nsomewhere in Australia. No one said the Savage West was limited to the left side \nof the Mississippi, after all! However, there is simply too much material to reprint \nhere to provide even a rough sketch of playing Down Under. Players are thereby \nagain advised to consult Rage Across the World Volume 2, The Wild West \nCompanion and A World of Darkness: Second Edition for a look at Australia in \nthe World of Darkness, past and present. For the relevant real-world details of \nhistory and geography, any number of reputable scholarly texts exist for consulta- \ntion, although a comprehensive encyclopedia is often a good start. Just remember \nas you do your research that much of the power of a historical setting comes from \nthe way that setting is brought to life. Players will always forgive you if some details \nare off, provided you capture the right “feel” of the time period. But if it seems to \nthem as though your Aboriginal village or tiny Outback town could just as easily \nbe set somewhere else, you’re in trouble. \nThat said, stories run in the Australia of the Savage West tend to be \nconstructed along a few basic lines. In one, the players’ characters make up a \nBunyip pack (or packs), learning to work together and trying to thwart the \nambitions of the Wyrm and wicked Europeans alike. In another, the players are \nEuropean Garou exploring a new land and dealing with the strange shapeshifters \nthey encounter there, perhaps with a friendly Bunyip or two in the midst to act as \nambassadors and guides. In a third, the two cultures are incorporated more \ncompletely, with mixed Garou-Bunyip packs as the norm.

Otherwise, the character \nrelationships will feel hollaw, and an essential dynamic of the chronicle will be \nlost. The key lies in balancing the stereotypes the characters all grew up with to the \nexperiences they’ve had with the culture they’re coming in contact with, and \nrealizing just what sort of person comes out of such a mix. \nIn essence, if the Bunyip feel like they’re fighting the newcomers just because \nthat’s what the Storyteller wants them to do, or the Europeans are just perpetrating \nthe cliche “great white hunters exploring the big dark continent” as they travel, \nsomething is deeply amiss. However, if they players feel the rage and frustration of \nthe Bunyip as they watch the Wyrm sink its claws into their land, or the first \ntentative but lasting ties of friendship forming with an understanding foreign \nGarou, the Storyteller is doing his job. If the Europeans wonder at the glory of pure \nGaia as they step foot onto the continent, or watch in horror as their brothers \ndishonor the name Garou with their selfish pride, then the essence of the theme \nhas been captured right in the beginning. \nEORMS \nHOMID \nTrait Adjustments: None. \nChange Description: All Bunyip are of Aboriginal stock, with dark eyes, hair \nand skin tone, although their hair turns light gray or even white as they age.

The Garou later adopt this Gift and its name, perhaps out \nof respect for the Bunyip. \nDreamwalk - \nBunyip have a deep bond with the Umbra, unfathomable \neven to the most learned Uktena sages and Stargazer mystics, and this Gift is a \nrecognition of that fact. As long as the moon is visible in the sky, the Bunyip may \nreduce the level of the Gauntlet by two. This effect applies only to the Bunyip \nhimself, it does not count as an action on the Bunyip’s part, and it extends for a \nradius of no more than three steps. Also, Bunyip with this Gift never have a need \nfor a reflective surface to cross into the Umbra, visible moon or otherwise. They \nneed only concentrate on the passage, although stepping sideways still takes the \nnormal amount of time. \nPossum’s Feet - \nSee the Gift: Catfeet, in Laws of the Wild, p. 97. \nMeasuredStep-SeetheGift:SlrrfaceAttmement,inLawsoftheWild,p. 121. \nLonesome Voice of the Bunyip- As the last hope of their race, the Bunyip \nare aware that they are losing the battle for their homeland and their very identity. \nThis Gift stems from the deep loss that Bunyip himself feels when looking on the \nbrave struggles of his oumumbered children. Characters who learn this Gift can \nchannel some of the terrible sadness of their Totem into a booming, haunting cry, \nsending those around them fleeing from a combination of loneliness and terror. \nThe player must announce the use of this Gift (actual wailing is discouraged, unless \nyou happen to be proficient at expressing the bleak nihilism of encroaching \nextinction in a few syllables) and spend a Gnosis Trait.

Treat \nthis Gift the same as the Gift: Attumment in Laws of the Wild, p. 109, except that \nthe Bunyip has an effective range of dozens of miles, and he may learn about such \ngeneral patterns as coming weather, distant settlements and the like. The down \nside of this Gift is that, linked as it is to the Bunyip’s ancestral lands, this Gift will \nnot function in most foreign locales (such as the Savage West), although the \nStoryteller may make an exception in certain special circumstances. \nVice-Jaw - \nSee the Lupus Gift: Gnaw, in Laws of the Wild, p. 97. \nGuardians of the Dreamtime - \nBunyip with this bond to the spirit world \nneed never worry about any restrictions on their ability to step sideways. To them, \nboth worlds are as one, and crossing between the two is as easy as drawing breath. \nThey cannot fight in and out of the Umbra simultaneously (that is the province \nof the Gift: Ghost Dance, in Laws of the Wyld West, p. 285), but day or night, the \nGauntlet is always considered two lower for the Bunyip. They may even extend this \nadvantage to others in a 10-foot radius with a Static Mental Challenge (difficulty \nseven). If successful, they may reduce the Gauntlet by one for every Mental Trait \nthey spend. This reduction lasts until the end of the session/ night, whichever \ncomes first. \nBloody-Mindedness -Named after an Australian expression denoting an \nunswerving commitment to reaching a particular goal, this fearsome Gift allows a \nBunyip to pursue the target of his dedication with inhuman efficiency. When the \nplayer spends two Willpower Traits and declares his chosen objective (to a \nNarrator), the Bunyip does not need to eat or sleep until his quest is completed. He \nis also one Trait up on all Challenges related to his task, and he is completely \nimmune to all supernatural mind- or emotion-control attempts that try to sway him \nfrom his objective. Furthermore, if used in combat, the Bunyip may not attempt to \ndodge attacks from sources other than his chosen target (although he may still soak \nthem normally), but he is considered to have two extra Healthy health levels when \nsoaking such attacks. He also gains an additional attack against his sworn foe at the \nend of every turn. Note that the objective must be specific and attainable: “Destroy \nall European Garou” is not a permissible oath, but “Get revenge on the Silver Fang \nwho burned my tribe’s village” would be. If in doubt, consult a Narrator about \nwhich oaths are permissible. Only one sacred vow may be sworn at a time. \nBillabong Bridge - \nAncient uses of this Gift are what allowed the Bunyip \nto patrol their vast protectorate efficiently, and its use is still a means of rapid \ntransportation in an era when many of the Moon Bridges are being claimed by the \nEuropean Garou. Bunyip using this Gift may enter one body of water and emerge \nat another such body any distance away, simply by spending two Gnosis Traits and \nenvisioning their destination (therefore both locations must be fairly well-known \nto the Bunyip before this Gift will function). The only other restriction is that salt \nwater cannot be involved at either end of the trip, or the Gift will not activate. \nOnly the Gift user may make the journey. No other “passengers” may hitch a ride \nthis way. \nADVANCED \n51ms \n"

Bunyip has \nnever been sighted outside of a body of water, and he favors deep streams and \nbillabongs. His deep bellow terrifies even the bravest ofwarriors, and his words bear \nthe eternal wisdom of the rivers. \nBunyip gives his children access to the Gifts: Measured Steb and Lonesome \nVoice ofthe Bunyip once per session. If the characters are non-Bunyip, the Breed will \nbe favorably disposed to them, but they will also expect them to take their side in \nany disputes with the Europeans, which can put the characters in a difficult \nposition very quickly. \nBan: Bunyip asks that his children honor him by drowning at least one enemy \nin fresh water every year. Due to his anger at their past ignorance and current blood \nthirst, Bunyip will not accept packs that contain European Garou. Only Silent \nStriders, Stargazers and Pure Ones have a chance of receiving his patronage, and \neven they must perform a great service for him before he will consider adopting \nthem. Bunyip may not be taken by any packs operating outside of Australia due to \nhis weakening condition. \nNgalyod the Rainbow Serpent \ncost: 7 \nThe chief totem of the Bunyip, although almost entirely unheard of by the \nEuropeans, Ngalyod appears as a tremendous rainbow-colored serpent. No one has \never been tall or high enough to see both Ngalyod’s head and his tail at once. Once \na joyous spirit, Ngalyod has grown moody and withdrawn of late, grieving for her \nvanishing children and searching for answers to the problems facing them. \nNgalyod gives each of her children a permanent Trait of Honor Renown, as \nwell as one permanent Gnosis Trait. Bunyip will be extremely impressed by any \nGarou who receive Ngalyod’s blessing, but they will expect them to act the part as \nwell. Ngalyod’s Children will never be attacked by Dreamtime spirits, although \nthese spirits can and will defend themselves if attacked. \nBan: Children of the Rainbow Serpent must become parents as soon as \npossible, since the Rainbow Serpent is a spirit of birth and creation. More forgiving \nthan her cousin Mu-ru-bul Tu-ru-dun, Ngalyod will accept Garou of all tribes, \nalthough Europeans will still be required to perform some extra service and \ndemonstrate exceptional dedication to defending Australia and its people before \nreceiving her blessing. Ngalyod’s power is weakening, however, and it cannot be \ntaken outside of Australia, just like her cousin. \n"

Nor is everything different about the wraithly society of the \nera. However, The Great War isn’t just an Oblivion game in different hats. \nIn this period, Charon rules his empire, or at least he’s out there. On the other \nhand, the empire’s engulfed by civil war, with Legion pitted against Legion. All \naround the combatants, and everyone else, a Great Maelstrom blows. Wraiths who \ndied in other lands can’t get home.. . and wraiths who would normally go to other \nDark Kingdoms remain in Stygian territory for the duration. \nIn a Great War chronicle, you can play wraiths with African and Indian \nArcanoi, take sides in the greatest conflict within the empire since the Three \nAbominations centuries ago, roleplay the stresses within every Necropolis while \nthe storm winds blow and meet the man who built the empire. Some of the usual \npowers work differently. You’ll find new Natures, new Shadow Archetypes, new \nThorns and more here. \nYou can certainly use a lot of this information in a modem-day Oblivion game, \nparticularly if you incorporate Ends of Empire and unleash the Sixth Great \nMaelstrom. But the Great War era has a tone all its own, too. \nTHE \nC~RFAT WAR \nThree hundred years ago, the Third Great Maelstrom ripped through the \nUnderworld. The Labyrinth shuddered and spat out centuries’ accumulation of \nangry Spectres while the vast seas below the Shadowlands churned into storms that \nlasted for years. All of Stygia’s armies and all the wraiths who reject Stygian \nauthority, fighting together in the crisis, took more than adecade to beat down the \nstorm and the spirits moving inside it. The battle left the empire changed forever. \n"

      "text": "Storm debris clogged the River of Death, making it impassable. Charon founded \nthe first Necropolis (in London) to better protect and manage the ever-growing \nvolume of souls under his command. The Sea of Shadows, which returned to its \ndark calm after the First and Second Great Maelstroms, never became still again. \nEven today, it’s known as the Tempest. \nThis time, things are worse. \nThe great powers of Europe go to war in 1914. Among the young men who \nmarch off to what they thought would be glorious victory, and among the men and \nwomen of every age who cheer them on, are many who later claim they’d never \nfavored the martial cause. They lie to themselves and others. In the decades before \n1914, intellectuals, mid-level managers and peasants alike tell each other how war \nwould invigorate their national spirit and bring glory to the warriors. They don’t \npay attention to mounting evidence - \nfrom the American Civil War, from the \nCrimean War, from the Boer War - \nthat modem technology makes all that \nirrelevant. So the young men march off to die by the millions. \nThe war settles almost nothing in a military or diplomatic sense, except that treaty \nterms guarantee another war will follow in the next generation. The young men come \nhome disillusioned, searching for enemies to blame. Their chosen targets include \ncapitalism, liberal democracy, communism, Jewry and anyone else who might express \nan opinion about what went wrong. In the aftermath of the war, plague follows, with \nlethal influenza striking some countries even harder than the war. Revolutions rage all \nacross Eastern Europe, while the regimes ofWestem Europe grope for some idea of what \nto do next. After a nervously exuberant decade, global depression sets in. \nIt is not the best of times for the living. The dead soon envy them. \nThe FourthGreat Maelstrom breaks out on July 1,1916. In the Skinlands, the \nBattle of the Somme includes the highest casualty rates yet. The press of violent \ndeath and surrounding agony echoes across the Shroud, pouring dark passions into \nevery layer of the afterlife. In the depths of the Labyrinth, spiritual tides crest and \nbegin to ebb. The turning tide forces Spectres out of the Labyrinth and into the \nupper reaches of the Underworld. As the weight of pain inflames the Tempest, \ntriggering storm clouds that rise into the Shadowlands, torrents of Spectres shoot \nupward in search of some new home until the Labyrinthine tides allow them to \nreturn. On July lst, the Shadowlands of eastern France crack open to let the \nseething mass of evil memories and Shadow-eaten souls pour forth. Similar \neruptions begin on battlefields on every front during the next few hours. Within \ndays, the leading edge of the storm sweeps around the globe. \nThe Great Maelstrom rages for more than a decade. As the ’20s wear on, it \ngradually tapers off, and something like peace returns. \nThe storm isn’t the only problem wraiths face. Charon isolates himself in the \nOnyx Tower and does not answer calls to lead his people. In 1918, the Smiling Lord \ndeclares himself the new emperor of the dead: The crisis calls for leadership, and thanks \nto war deaths, he controls more wraiths than any of his rival Deathlords. His followers \nrefer to themselves as Imperialists; their enemies call them Insurrectionists. The \nSkeletalbrd, whoseesCharonastheFirst Horsemanofthe Apocalypse, leadstheloyal \nresistance.

      "text": "THE POWERS \nTHAT \nBE \nFor a full decade, the Stygian Empire functions erratically, without consis- \ntency. Between the corporeal challenge of the storm and the social challenge of the \nInsurrection, most Necropoli must rely on their own resources. Independent \ngovernments spring up as “free cities,” city-states, regional alliances and the like. \nSome cities cater to the Imperialist or Loyalist factions in exchange for the freedom \nto run their own affairs. In St. Petersburg, for instance, glib-sounding Anacreons \nkeep inspectors appeased and breed monsters behind the scenes. \nThe Legions are the basic building blocks ofwraithly society. They Reap souls and \ninstruct the new Restless Dead in the fundamentals of their condition. Most wraiths \naren’t soldiers, but the Legions provide a sense of identity for many wraiths nonetheless. \nThe vast majority of wraiths follow the lead set by the higher-ups in their respective \nLegions, not so much out ofdeep conviction as because they take it for granted and have \nno real alternatives. Common attitudes include “my bosses seem to know what they’re \ndoing, and I’m not impressed by the other guys” and “I owe these people for helping me \nsurvive, so I’ll back them even if I don’t really understand what’s going on.” \nTHE \nLE~IONS \nThe Skeletal Legion: Victims of Pestilence \nThe Skeletal Legion leads the Loyalist faction. The Skeletal Lord is utterly insane. \nHe believes himself to be one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and he fights to \nprotect the realm of Charon, whom he regards as Death incarnate. The Skeletal Lord’s \nmadness doesn’t prevent him from running one of the most efficient Legions. Disease \nstrikes all ages and social classes, and the Skeletal Lord staffs his offices with the finest \nadministrators he can find. Skeletal Legionnaires tend to know a lot more about what \nassets they have at any given time than their counterparts in other Legions. In 1918, \nwhen the Smiling Lord revolts, the Skeletal Legion badly lags behind the Gnm in \nmanpower. However, the Spanish Flu and various other post-war diseases close the gap. \nIt takes most of a decade for the Skeletal Legion to fully assimilate and train its new \nrecruits, so the Skeletal Legion fights an uphill battle throughout the ’2Os, holding its \ngains but expanding much more slowly than its commanders would like. \nThe Iron Legion: Victims of Old Age \nLike pestilence, old age strikes people at every level of society. The Iron \nLegion’s recruits all enter the Shadowlands with the benefits (and disadvantages) \nof a full life’s experience. Iron Legion administrators get surprised by less, since they \nreally have seen it before. The Legion’s diplomats and spies know tricks that even \ncenturies in the Shadowlands can’t match. Mortals live more intensely than \nwraiths do, and they pack a lot of insight into a century. Unfortunately, Iron \nLegionnaires often rely too much on mortal insights and not enough on wraithly \nones: When the Insurrection begins, many Iron Legion officers and spies fall to \nGrim Legion jailers. The Legion spends the rest of the decade fighting to survive \nas well as rebuild. Fortunately, while wars and disease both come and go, old age \nremains, and the Iron Legion grows again just as it has after past tragedies. Very few \nIron Legionnaires defy their superiors to join the Insurrection. They include many \nof the wartime leaders that angry young Grim Legionnaires would love to punish. \nThe Grim Legion: Victims of Violence \nThe population of the Grim Legion rises and falls in big steps. Wars, genocides \nand the like kill many people in short order. In more peaceful times, only murders \n"

Senior Grim leaders must assimilate a \ngreat many wraiths quickly and then try to conserve their forces until the next era \nof suffering, all the while keeping their charges from the over-zealous pursuit of \nvengeance. At the moment of Insurrection, the Grim Legion vastly outnumbers \nany of its rivals; the Smiling Lord plans a rapid enough victory not to worry about \nattrition. Just like the plans of European generals before 1914, it doesn’t quite work \nthat way. With the growing ranks of Skeletal soldiers and the Emerald Legion’s \ndefection, in the end sheer numbers determine the Smiling Lord’s failure. \nThe Emerald Legion: Victims of Happenstance \nSometimes life deals cruel and capricious blows. Entering the Shadowlands \nunexpectedly, without any of the preparation that war or pestilence or old age might \nprovide, the members of the Emerald Legion traditionally compensate with a rigorous \nconservatism. The Emerald Lord usually plays within the system for all the advantage \nhe can gather. He acted out of character when backing the Smiling Lord, and suffered \nfor it when he returned to form and defected to the Loyalist cause halfway through the \nInsurrection. The other Deathlords willingly enough put his forces to use, but they \nnever trusted him, and they systematically denied him his traditional share of wraiths \nwith contestable causes of death. The irregular nature of happenstance means that the \nLegion always suffers from deficiencies in manpower and equipment - \nit’s hard to do \nstrategic planning when chance defines your existence. \nThe Penitent Legion: Victims of Madness \nThe Penitent Legion, like the Grim, grows and contracts unpredictably. The \nLaughing Lady ran her Legion ruthlessly, Reaping every soul she could claim and \nsending troublemakers to the forges, all with a minimum of argument tolerated. \nThe War to End All Wars swells the Legion’s ranks, with soldier-suicides (many \nof whom didn’t consciously realize they were suicidal), shell-shock victims and the \nlike. Despite relatively close relations, the Smiling Lord decided he couldn’t trust \nthe Laughing Lady and deposed her at the start of the Insurrection, setting up a new \none loyal to him. For the duration, rival Laughing Ladies compete for control of the \nLegion’s resources; neither one matters to the battle except as a propaganda figure. \nAt Insurrection’s end, the puppet goes to the forges and the original Laughing Lady \nreturns to power, dedicating herself to a purge that leaves the Legion so depopu- \nlated as to be barely functional for decades to come. \nThe Legion of Fate: T h e  Chosen \nThe ranks of the Legion of Fate are somehow always just large enough. Nothing \nunites the Fated except the mark of fate itself: They would otherwise spread all \nthrough the other Legions because they can die any way people do. The Ladies of Fate \noversee the most diversified gathering of ghosts and somehow manage to maintain \na n  effective organization to get the right people to the spots Fate decrees appropriate \nat the right time. Just as the Fated take no formal part in Necropolis politics, so they \ntake no part in the Insurrection. They concentrate on fighting the storm and Spectres \nso that whoever emerges on top still has an empire to rule. \nThe Silent Legion: Victims of Despair \nDespair stalks mortal society during and after the war. Soldiers and civilians \nlose hope and surrender to death. The Silent Legion makes an unusually coordi- \nnated effort to find and recruit its souls, since so many would otherwise keep falling \ninto Oblivion. The Quiet Lord cares more about the well-being of his charges than \nmost of the other Deathlords. Silent Legionnaires who survive their first weeks in \n"

Like the Legion of Fate, the Silent Legion \nplays little part in the Insurrection. Silent Legionnaires often serve as acting \nAnacreons, trusted by both sides, as well as fighting the storm. \nThe Legion of Paupers: Victims of Mystery \nThe only Legion smaller than the Paupers is the Legion of Fate, yet the Beggar \nLord compensates for his thin ranks with overwhelming ambition. He’s one of the \nmost thorough deal-makers and conspirators in the Dark Kingdom of Iron. Popular \nopinion portrays the Paupers as a Legion of the clueless. Its members compensate \nmuch as their Lord does, through diligent effort to win power and influence. Little \nunites them except the shared isolation of an unknown or incomprehensible death. \nThis link could be a liability, but the Beggar Lord tries to capitalize on the diversity \nin his ranks. Outsiders who stereotype the Legion too far end up embarrassed (or \nworse) when they find themselves outmaneuvered in complex social ploys. During \nthe Insurrection, the Legion of Paupers remains neutral, collecting payments from \nboth sides to stay out of the conflict and building its own power base all the while. \nWhen the usual foundations of Stygian society prove unreliable, other groups \nmove in to prop up the society and keep it running. In some Necropoli, the Guilds \nremain largely suppressed and out of sight, but in many parts of the empire they \nprovide more practical governance than the Hierarchy. \nStygians often divide the Guilds into four categories. The Great Guilds matter as \nmuch to the survival ofthe empire as any Legion, providing essential services. No leader \nor would-be leader with a clue risks tampering with the Artificers, Masquers, Pardoners \nor Usurers. A faction cut off by one or more of the Great Guilds must fall, and sooner \nrather than later. The Working Guilds provide useful services and operate almost in \npublic behind a variety of flimsy guises that satisfy the letter of the law. A few Working \nGuildwraiths become prominent players in the games of Stygian politics. Most try, l i e  \nthe wraiths around them, mostly to stay out of the way. The Chanteurs, Harbingers, \nOracles and Sandmen all confront the same mix of opportunity and risk facing all \nwraiths during the Great War. The Criminal Guilds provide services that warrant \ninstant slavery and forging ... services often so useful that prominent Criminal \nGuildwraiths enjoy signhcant social status, and nobody rudely broaches the question \nof just how those wraiths acquired their power and influence. The war and storm matter \nless to the Criminal Guilds, forming opportunity and backdrop rather than all- \nconsuming goals for the Haunters, Monitors, Proctors, Puppeteers and Spooks. Fmlly, \nthe Forbidden Guilds operate altogether outside the sanction of Stygian society, and the \nInsurrection doesn’t change much for the Alchemists, Mnemoi or Solicitors. \nThe Great Guilds \nLoyalists and Imperialists alike court the Great Guilds, and try to avoid \ndrawing the Guilds’ anger. \nAn internal civil war rages throughout the Great War within the Artificers. \nNhudri’s detachment and the Guild’s public neutrality mask a vicious struggle to \ntie the Guild’s fortunes to the faction deemed most likely to win the war.

Loyalist Necropoli most resemble the Shadowlands in other times. The \nImperial approach offers a fresh spin on similar themes. Independent government \ncovers everything else. Be sure to consider how much organization you want, and \nchoose enough to satisfy players and not enough to annoy them. \nC HARACTF R C RFATI o N \nThe Great War era emphasizes some aspects of wraithly society more than \nothers, and some constant factors like Shadow and Arcanoi manifest in ways \nappropriate to the period. \nThis article covers creating characters in the mainstream of Stygian society \nafter the War to End All Wars. They belong to one or another of the Legions - \nalthough they may not serve actively in any sense - \nand they study the publicly \navailable Arcanoi. Wraith: Great War includes options not covered here, \nincluding the forbidden Arcanoi and Mortwights as player-characters.

When you die, or shortly \nthereafter, someone comes to claim you, offering you shelter from the storm and \ninstruction in your new condition. Guild training, if it happens at all, only comes \nlater, and Legion membership defines your place in the Underworld. \nDEATH \nAND THE L E ~ I O N S  \nSee the descriptions of the Legions, and think about how your character died. \nUnlike the late 20th century, the Great War era includes many causes of mass \ndeath - \nyour character probably enters the Shadowlands with many peers. War \nand revolution create wraiths by the dozens (or hundreds, or even thousands) in \nevery battle. When diseases sweep through a country, they swell the wraithly \npopulation of a Necropolis as well. It’s easy for Great War wraiths to begin with a \nshared death, and that fact is a handy hook for a chronicle. \nEven if characters go on to join independent movements, Loyalist or Impe- \nrialist Reapers almost certainly brought them out of the Caul and into wraithly \nsociety. Independent Necropoli seldom have the organization to mount regular \nReaping patrols. So characters have the opportunity to get some information \n(albeit biased) right at the outset. Think about who your character was in life. You \nhave to do so anyway to develop Passions and Fetters, but it also matters for how \nyour character deals with the new realities of the Underworld. Soldiers who hate \nthe war and wish to see all empires fall feel very differently about the Insurrection \nthan loyal citizens who honestly sought to promote their nation’s victory, for \ninstance. It’s not just biographical facts that matter, but attitude. \nThe decade after the War to End All Wars is one of revolutionary change. \nEinstein’s discoveries in physics, along with quantum mechanics, open up a whole \nnew way of looking at the natural world. The Russian Revolution proves that no \nempire can withstand change forever. The war itself shows the moral bankruptcy \nof old imperial ideas, and in exhausting Europe, lays the groundwork for America \nto emerge as the new world power. Freud’s ideas drastically alter how people think \nof their own souls. Many people stay true to older principles, of course, but in the \nface of multiple revolutions, remaining traditional is itself a conscious choice, too. \nIt’s an era of self-examination as well as critique of the world at large. \nI \n,I \nI \nL \n~ I \nARCHETYPES \n1 \nIn addition to the Natures and Demeanors common to the late 20th century, \nprovided in Oblivion, the psychological and spiritual conditions of the Great War \nera give rise to other common archetypes. \nAuCourant.Youmustbecurrent.

Don’t create a character with no Fetters on the \nside of the Atlantic where play begins, or at least be prepared to make a new \ncharacter after the first Harrowing if you do. \nAt least one Passion should relate to the character’s cause ofdeath. It provides \nhooks, whether the character seeks vengeance, redress or just a chance to finish \nwhatever it is death cut short.

The Deserter looks for reasons to justify betraying friends and \nassociates and then for the best way to leave them in the lurch. \nThe Id. Only passions untrammeled by reason or an awareness of the future \nmatter. The Id seeks to indulge whatever seems likely to bring satisfaction to the \nwraith right now, and never mind what may come next. \nThe Maggot.

The value of a thing is what that thing will bring. The \nMerchant drives bargains, knowing that nothing need remain with its current \nowner if the price is right. The Merchant makes bargains that leave everyone a bit \nworse off than before, feeding Oblivion through dissatisfaction and covetousness. \nThe Nurse.

The \nOfficer takes charge, getting the Underworld in systematic order, so that in due \ntime it can all march off into Oblivion in perfect harmony. In the meantime, the \nOfficer punishes all who resist. \nThe Opium-Eater. Life is pain. So is death. Nothing matters but enjoyment \n-not the foul, gross pleasures the Id seeks, but the refined intellectual purity that \ncomes from a mind untroubled and yet at liberty to engage with the world.

Unlike the Anarchist, however, the Revolutionary also seeks to build up \na utopian alternative. The Revolutionary seeks a new order, not disorder. \nThe Superego. The Id aims for the moment’s pleasure; the Superego \nsubordinates all current pleasures to ultimate goals. The Superego punishes the \nPsyche for seeking present gratification, and rewards self-denial in the name of \nlong-term Passions.

This costs two Angst Traits for a Shadowlands effect or three Traits \nto include Skinlands manifestation. (Reduce the Angst costs by one Trait while \nthe wraith is in Catharsis.) The Shadow specifies a particular effect, which lasts for \none hour. The Shadow can only affect one sense, chosen when buying this Thorn; \nto affect multiple senses, buy it several times and spend all the required Angst. \nTypical visual effects include sudden darkness, shadows without apparent \nsources and fuzzy luminous forms. Common smell manifestations include salty sea \nair, smoke and rotting flesh. The paraphernalia of haunting, including rattling \nchains, low moans and rising shrieks abruptly cut off are popular aural effects, as are \nunexpected echoes (or the suppression of echoes). Tactile illusions include icy \nchill and the touch of unseen fingers. \nIdee Fixe: 2 Traits. The Shadow stimulates one of the wraith's Passions to \nfurious intensity. Spend one Angst Trait and make a Test of Angst against \nWillpower. If successful, the Shadow specifies a particular Passion to become so \nintense that the wraith must act in a way that qualifies for a Passion check within \none hour or lose a Trait of Willpower. \nShell Shock (Dissociation): 2 Traits.

While suffering from a blocked Passion, the Psyche feels emotionally numb \nin matters related to the emotion in question. \nCollective Unconscious: 3 Traits.

These rules keep them to a \nbare minimum. If you enjoy the element of uncertainty and don’t find a few \nextra rounds of challenge wearisome, then you can convert a great many \nmore Arcanos systems to extended challenges. Whenever there’s a system \nthat specifies a unit of return per point of Pathos, Willpower or some other \ncharacteristic, interpret it to mean each success in the extended challenge \nproduces that unit of return. \nKINESIS \nThis Arcanos is the pre-computers form of Inhabit. \nInnate Abilities \nStraddle. The wraith blends into a Skinlands object. She gains temporary \nconcealment, but she acquires no control over the object. \nSystem: Make a Static Physical Challenge, difficulty of the local Shroud rating. \nIf successful, the wraith blends into an object for one turn per permanent Physical \nTrait. Another wraith also using Str& \non the same object must win a Physical \nChallenge to displace the first. Sense Kinesis and Sense Rider do detect a wraith using \nStraddle; destroying the object inflicts one level of damage on the wraith. \nBasic Abilities \nBind. The wraith passes his hand through a Skinlands device, making it \nseize up momentarily. Clocks stop, automobiles stall and large or complex ma- \nchines grind to a halt. Someone must restart the machine; fragile machinery \ngenerally needs a shaking as well as a restart. This art does not affect devices that \ncontain no moving parts. \nSystem: Make a Static Physical Challenge against the local Shroud rating. \nAnyone attempting to restart the stopped machine must make one separate \nattempt per permanent Physical Trait of the wraith using Bind. Investing emo- \ntional energy by swearing at the machine, kicking it, shaking it and the like makes \none attempt count as three. \nReliquary.Thewraithstrengthensan inanimateobject by imbuing it withPathos. \nSystem: Make a Static Physical Challenge against the local Shroud rating \nplus five Traits. If successful, the wraith can transfer one or more points of Pathos \nto the target item. Each Trait protects the object against one incident that would \notherwise destroy it. Once it does its protective work, the Pathos dissipates. \nIntermediate Abilities \nHaywire. The wraith seizes control of a Skinlands machine and manipu- \nlates it. He can, for instance, make an automobile weave, stop or accelerate to full \nspeed, but he cannot actually steer it. \nSystem: Make a Static Social Challenge against the local Shroud rating. If \nsuccessful, the wraith can make the target device perform one general action per \npoint of current Willpower. Extra actions cost one Pathos apiece.

Very complex objects (like factories) and very large ones (like \nhouses) may require two or even three successes in an extended challenge. Claim \nlasts as long as the wraith remains in contact with the target. \nAttunement requires the wraith to spend Willpower: one for a handheld \nobject, two or three for a car and other bulky objects, up to five for a house and as \nmany as 10 for a factory. Once attuned to an object, the wraith gets a two-Trait \nbonus to efforts at Claim. \nAdvanced Ability \nLudd’s Grip. The wraith can make a Skinlands device rip itself apart \nthrough seizing up, causing some parts to run backward and other calamitous \nfailures. Devices prone to exploding generally do so. \nSystem: Spend three Pathos and one Willpower, and gain one Angst Trait. Make \na Static Physical Challenge against the local Shroud rating.

Wraiths may use these Traits only in resisting Maelstrom and \nSpectral complications. Loaned Traits return when the use of Lifeline ends. \nThe Lifeline creator knows immediately when the other wraith falls into the \nTempest.

Use the entire outline of the story ur feel free to lift \nwhichever pieces work best in your chronicle. Strict faithfulness to the letter of the \nmaterial we provide is not mandatory. However you decide to use this material, be \nprepared for player ingenuity and creativity. \nBACKC~ROUND \nThis scenario is based on the real life exploits of the Imperial Japanese Navy \ndestroyer Sakaki. As a member of the Allied Powers, Japan sent a token force of \ndestroyers to support naval operations in the Mediterranean, both in support of the \nGallipoli landing and the remaining Allied troops in the Balkans. One pair of \ndestroyers dispatched to the region were the sister ships Matsu and Sakaki, arriving \nin the area in early 1917. Assigned to escort duty, the pair performed well, with the \nMatsu rescuing 2,500 British soldiers from the torpedoed troopship Transylvania. \nAn Austro-Hungarian submarine torpedoed the Sakaki in June of 1917, with \n68 hands drowning in the aftermath of the attack. Damaged but not destroyed, the \nship was escorted to Italy for repairs. However, imagine for the purposes of our game \nsetting that the submarine attack had a more serious effect. Imagine that the \ntorpedo that struck the Sakaki caused the main boiler to explode, mortally \nwounding the ship and dramatically increasing the number of casualties.. .. \nThose unfortunates who died aboard the Sakaki with troubled hearts and \nminds soon woke to the reality of an afterlife totally alien to them. It was only due \nto the quick action of the captain and the remaining officers that the destruction \nof the Enfant crew was averted. Subsequent conflicts have led to the end of more \nmembers of the crew, and the total complement of the Sakaki is 25 officers and men. \nTHE CURRENT \nSITUATION \nThe ship is still intact and functional, but the crew has grown increasingly \nweary of the constant wandering brought on by their alien status. Captain \nYamada has refused to ally himself with any of the factions of the Civil War in \nStygia, and while their independence has prevented bloodier conflicts, it has also \nprevented the use of a specific port as a base. While supplies may not be as \npressing a need for the Restless, the need for a secure harbor to weather out a \nMaelstrom is certainly required. \nYamada realizes that he has arrived at a point where he cannot afford to \nremain neutral. To circumvent the problem of a direct alliance with any of the \nfactions, Yamada has decided to seek a partnership with one of the smaller \nNecropoli. In exchange for the power that the Sakaki and her crew can provide, the \ncrew would have a base in which to seek shelter from Maelstroms and othex \n"

In short, Renegades and \nother such factions will be given equal treatment from the captain as long as they \npossess the power to deliver what they promise. \nUnbeknownst to the Japanese officers and crew, however, a threat to the ship \nis emerging from within. The Japanese officers in the engine room did not make \nthe passage into wraithhood, and the captain has had to promote from the boiler- \nroom crew to make up for their loss. The engine crew is now made up of impressed \nKorean and Okinawan sailors, men who resented their subservience to the \nJapanese officers long before their death. Under leadership of Cho, the current \nengine chief, a mutiny had been brewing before the sinking of the ship. With the \npassing of the initial dangers to the ship, Cho’s thoughts have turned again to the \noverthrow of the captain and the loyal sailors. \nHowever, the real reason for the new mutinous thoughts is much more \ninsidious. Due to a lack of Pardoners aboard and the reluctance of European wraiths \nto deal with the strange Shadows of the crew, Cho and some of the other engine- \nroom crew are losing their battle with their other halves. The mutiny is a front for \na conspiracy to bring the Sakaki over to Oblivion. \nARRIVAL \nOP THE SAKAKI \nUpon entering the port, Captain Yamada and a small group of crewmen will \nenter the Necropolis and seek out the nominal head of the city. Yamada’s party will \nbe well-trained and armed, and they should be able to dispatch any opportunistic \nrogues looking for easy pickings. \nOnce Yamada has contacted and arranged a meeting with the city’s rulers, he \nwill state what it is he wishes from the relationship. Specifically, he would like use \nof the harbor area, with a section being set aside for the crew’s exclusive use and \nfree passage for members of his crew who wish to visit the Necropolis. In return, the \ncaptain is willing to ferry local citizens to nearby locations beyond the walls that \nhave been cut off by the Great Maelstrom and aid in the defense of the Necropolis \nfrom its enemies. \nGiven the assets that the Sakaki brings, some sort of deal will likely be reached \nafter some time spent bargaining and roleplaying. The conclusion of the agreement \nwill bring the ship and its crew into port for a long overdue rest. Unbeknownst to \nthe captain and his new partners, however, a second wave of negotiations is about \nto begin. \nARRIVAL \nOF C H O  \nWith the new shore privileges enjoyed by the crew, Cho and his faction can \nseek out the opponents of the captain’s new allies and attempt to gain their \nassistance. Any groups that the captain’s party spumed will be obvious targets for \nCho. Cho is a natural for allegiance with whatever Renegade or Insurrectionist \ngroups are active in the area, and he will gladly supply them with items smuggled \noff the ship. \nStorytellers will most likely wish to allow the above situation to continue for \na few sessions in order to allow the various factions to form up. Both groups have \ndecided advantages. The captain has the most immediate access to the ship and the \nresources it provides (such as Relics, mindless seaman Drones and munitions). \n"

It has \nnot occurred to the captain in the slightest that the engine room is harboring a \nmutiny. It is inconceivable to him that the Asian wraiths would allow themselves \nto become divided so far from home. Cho plans on showing him the falsity of this \nnotion. The ship’s Japanese officers have long oppressed and imprisoned Cho and \nhis co-conspirators, and their feelings may strike sympathetic chords with Loyalists \nin an Imperialist Necropolis.

While Renegades or more \nliberal Hierarchy members may sympathize with the plight of the engine crew, \ntheir opinions will almost certainly change when (or if) they discover the darker \nmotivations at work. \nTHE BITTER FND \nOnce you set these factors into play, your particular chronicle can take off in \nany direction you desire. However, consider the following as a possible outcome. \nAssuming that the players are unable to defuse the situation brought on by \nCho’s conspirators, the sides will inevitably clash. Cho’s plan will call for \nsmuggling whatever co-conspirators are combat threats into the engine-room area. \nFrom there, the group will storm the officers’ mess in an attempt to capture the \ncaptain and his officers. Once he’s done so, Cho intends to turn the awesome \nfirepower of the Sakaki on the very walls of the Necropolis. \nCho’s promise of great amounts of carnage has drawn the attention of \nOblivion’s soldiers. They swarm the Sakaki, rallying against the captain’s officers \n(and whomever else stands with them) while the mutineers make their move. \nShould the mutineers fall, the Shadow-eaten will continue their assault on the \nSakaki. Their goal, like Cho’s, is to maneuver the Sakaki into firing position and \nbring down the walls of the players’ Necropolis. Should they do so, they will swarm \nthe city, laying waste to everything in sight. \nA likely result of this scenario is the destruction of the sakaki. Realizing Cho’s \nintent, Captain Yamada (or the remaining loyal officers) will attempt to pull the \nship away from the port to spare the Necropolis further damage. If he is unable to \ndo so, his only recourse will be to detonate the ship’s magazine. Should Cho be \nroused from the control of his P’o and realize just what he has done, he may undergo \na last-minute change of heart as well. He can engineer an explosion of the engines, \nwhich would stop the bombardment and put an end to the mutiny as well. It is even \npossible that the Spectres leading the attack on the Necropolis and the Sakaki will \nchange their objectives if they realize that they are losing the battle to use the \nSakaki as a weapon. As a last resort, they may choose to detonate the ship’s \nmagazine themselves, settling for taking out as many wraiths as they can tha way. \nD A M A ~ E  \nCONTROL \nPossible problems with the scenario begin with the player reaction to the \nappearance of the ship.

The \neasiest is to impress upon the players the destructive power that the Sakaki carries \naboard. A glance at the Great War sourcebook shows the level of injury possible \nwith modem weapons. From a roleplaying perspective, wraiths who were veterans \nof constant shelling from land guns can extrapolate just how bad a barrage from the \ndeck of the Sakuki would be. Another means of stopping player shenanigans is \naltering the local defense situation to make the ship more attractive. Scavengers \nmay want the ship, but when it is all that stands between them and Oblivion, it \nsuddenly develops shelf life. \nThe second most likely problem is the survival of the Sakaki itself. While the \ndestroyer makes an excellent plot feature, placing such firepqwer in the hands of \nthe local Necropolis can unbalance the long-term health of the chronicle. It is \nconceivable that early detection of the P o  influence on Cho or a lack of support \nfor one of the factions could cause the mutiny to either not occur or to end before \nthe arrival of the Oblivion’s hordes. \nIt can easily be impressed on the minds of the characters who hold the city \nwhat a danger the Sukuki could be to their health. A ship of that size would attract \ninterest, interest that could draw the community deeper into the Stygian Civil \nWar. The ship could well bring on a host of internal problems as different factions \nin the city vie again and again for control of the potent vessel. \nVARIATIONS \nOf course, you may mod& the preceding scenario to fit your chronicle in any \nway you wish. In your game, the Sakuki may not be destroyed at all. It may remain \nthroughout the life of the game, anchored just off-site, providing another in-game \nlocation or a constant source of conflict. The players’ characters may even decide \nto scuttle it after the preceding events play out to supplement their war effort. \nHowever, if the basic premise doesn’t appeal to you, try including the Sakuki \nin your Great War chronicle in these alternate ways: \nRAIDER \nThe ship could simply be a pirate preying upon the locals. Remove the \nKorean-conspiracy element, add a greater degree of P‘o influence onboard, and you \nhave a basic scenario for starting and intermediate players to tangle with. \nTo SAVE \nOUR EORMER \nALLIES \nIn another variation that removes Cho and his corruption, the captain of the \nSukuki wishes to use the port for a far different reason. After finding himself in the \nShadowlands, Yamada hopes to establish the players’ Necropolis as a base to \nextract Western wraiths from the African theater ofwar. Interaction with the Bush \nof Ghosts and exposure to the strange Arcanos of African wraiths are a few of the \nmore basic offerings this chronicle concept provides. This frame establishes the \nplayers’ Necropolis as a central refuge for many different types of wraiths, allowing \nfor a constant influx of new story potential. \n"

      "text": "IMPRESSMENT \nAssume that Captain Yamada’s intentions are not so noble as they would \nappear to be. In this variant scenario, the captain’s negotiations are a front for \nsomething more insidious. With the recent deaths of some of his crew members, \nthe captain needs replacements. And where would be better to draw those \ncrewmen from than a Necropolis with no protector from depredation? \nSTORYTELLER \nCHARACTERS \nThe two most influential characters driving this chronicle concept are \nCaptain Toshio Yamada and the Korean Pien Cho. Build these characters using \nthe Dark Kingdom of Jade rules provided in the fourth issue of the Journal, \nbut feel \nfree to adjust their relative levels of power to remain in balance with your \nchronicle. However, there are some basic characteristics to keep in mind when \ncreating these characters. \nCaptain Yamada’s main regret is that he died outside of Japan. He is a shrewd \nand dignified leader who inspires confidence and trust in his officers and crew. He \nis a staunch supporter of the Allied cause during the Great War, and he is willing \nto assist the Allies who have found themselves in the Shadowlands. His Passions \ninclude his desire to protect the honor and security of the Sakaki, to protect his crew \nand those with whom he makes alliances and to return to his native Japan once the \nGreat Maelstrom abates to a level in which that return is possible. \nCho, on the other hand, shares no such patriotism with Captain Yamada. His \nregret is that he died while impressed into servitude aboard the Sakaki, and his P’o \nshould never cease to remind him of that regret. Driven thus, Cho will stop at \nnothing to gain his freedom, overthrow the haughty Captain Yamada and perhaps \neven return to his own native Korea. If he can do so with the reclaimed Sakuki as \nhis prize, that’s all the better. \n"

      "text": "COSTUMINC~ \nEOR LIVE-ACTION PLAY \nby Laura D. Hanson \nThis article is the first in a limited series on the hows and wherefores of \nhistorical URP costuming. We found Laura at the 1999 Gen-Con, and we’re \nglad we did so. And for those astute readers out there who caught the last issue of \nthe Journal, no, Laura is not “Auntie Csilla.” \n~~ \n~ \n~ \nFirst off, for those of you wondering who this woman is and why you should \nbe taking advice from her at all, here’s a little back history on me. Currently, \nI run a small costuming business in New York City. I have about 15 years of \npractical costuming experience, gathered in various places like university \ncostume shops, Renaissance festivals and the occasional Halloween and LARP \nsewing gig. Regular Gen-Con attendees may also have encountered my \ncostumes (usually with me in them) wandering through the dealers’ hall. \nAlong the way, I also managed to pick up a degree in medieval history (so \nplease forgive me if the Dark Ages section seems to run on a bit), all of which \nleaves me qualified to talk to you about some of the more important aspects of \naccurate period costuming. And that is more than enough about me. Let’s get \non to the costume-designing, shall we? \nThe most important piece of preliminary advice I can give you is, “Get \nthee to a library!” Yes, this means research. Stick your nose into a book about \nthe time period you are going to game in and read about it. Find etchings or \ndrawings or photographs of people from the time and study the way their \nclothes looked. If you really want an authentic feel for the era that you’re about \nto enter, research it. That, in its simplest form, is really the best advice that \nanyone can give you about costuming for a historical setting. Since the reality \nof it is slightly more complex than that, let me give you a few points on how \nto wade through all of the information (and misinformation) out there. My \nadvice will enable you to garb your character effectively and satisfactorily for \nplay in the Dark Ages, the Wild West or the Great War period. \nTHE \nDARKAGES \nJust to get one of the more common misconceptions about Dark Ages \nfashion (not to mention one of my pet peeves) out of the way, noblemen at the \nend of the 12th century never spent their days dressed in full plate mail armor. \nThe first reason being that full plate armor did not exist until the 13th century \nor so, and the second reason is that even when it did exist, wearing it to dinner \nwould have been roughly equivalent to strapping on a Volkswagen and trying \nto eat. It just didn’t happen. \nAnother stereotype that you should avoid is the Robin Hood look, made \nfamous by Errol Flynn and more recently Cary Elwes. As a part of this look, \n"

      "text": "heroes wore tights and streamlined suede vests. Every line of these outfits \nexisted to show off the contours of a heroic frame. There was actually a time \nwhen men dressed this way, and it’s called 1930s Hollywood. Second, the \npointed hennin, or “princess hat,” also comes from a later date, more like the \n13th or 14th centuries, as does any form of close-fitting garment. \nYes, that’s right. Dark Ages fashion had yet to discover tailoring. Clothes for \nboth men and women were long and simply cut, with very few seams. Clothing \nstyle did not differ much from class level to class level, but quality and amount \nof material did. For example, a peasant woman might wear a simple wool ankle- \nlength gown, but a noblewoman would wear a floor-length version of the same \nstyle, made out of velvet or brocaded cloth with a second, shorter gown over it. \nCastle dwellers wore more clothing not only because they had more money, but \nbecause castles were really cold and damp and generally unpleasant. \nColor was another important factor in class-distinction. Animal- and \nvegetable-based dyes were expensive, and they faded quickly. Therefore, the \ndeeper the color of your clothes, the more prosperous you looked because you \ncould obviously afford to either keep re-dying things or buying new ones. In a \nworld where most people had only two sets of clothes at a time (if they were \nlucky), dark or brilliantly colored clothing practically shouted “Nobility!” \nThere were even sumptuary laws governing what colors each level of noble \ncould wear. It was a way to maintain a visual class distinction among courtiers, \nhelping people to “know their place.” Purple was usually reserved for royalty \nonly, no matter what country you hailed from, but rulers would often also enact \nlaws restricting their favorite colors. Color also came into play with heraldry, \nwith different courts dressing in the colors of their ruler’s coat-of-arms. Use of \ncolor could be very effective in game play if, for example, only the prince and \nprince’s courtiers dressed in scarlet. The color of blood and power would be an \nimmediate visual reminder of who truly rules the city. \nThe basic style for men was a long-sleeved T-tunic gown (yes, I said gown) \nthat slipped on over the head and reached mid-calf in length. It was worn \nbelted at the waist and was very loose-fitting to allow for ease of movement. \nMen commonly wore knitted stockings as leg coverings and either plain \nleather slippers or sandals. (Birkenstock-style shoes work well for this look, \nalthough they do tend to be pricey.) The only other piece of the daily wardrobe \nwas the cape or cloak, cut on a circular pattern. These garments had no \nshoulder seams or hoods. They consisted of just a large circle or partial circle \nof fabric, draped around the shoulders and held either with circle pins or a band \nof fabric stitched to create a neck opening. Since patterns of any kind actually \nhad to be woven into the cloth instead of printed on top, decoration commonly \ntook the form of edge trim in wide bands which could be removed from one \ngarment and transferred to another when the first one wore out. \nThere are two ways to approach dressing for the Dark Ages as a man. One \nis to grit your teeth, find someone who sews and be really nice to them - \nthen \nto learn to wear tights and like it. The other way is to simplify your wardrobe. \n~ \n"

      "text": "Wear very plain drawstring pants and a plain, oversized pullover shirt with a \nsimple neckline that you feel comfortable wearing a belt over (so you have \nsomewhere to put that all-important belt pouch). Find undecorated, slip-on \nboots if you’re not the sandals type, and invest your wardrobe money in a full- \ncircle or half-circle cloak. This is one of the few time periods I would \nrecommend buying a cape for first, but 12th-century clothing was all about \ndraperies. Wear fabric, and lots of it. \nNow for the ladies. Your basic wardrobe would be something like this: a \nlightweight linen or cotton full length slip called a chemise, usually white or \noff-white, over that a floor-length dress with long, tight sleeves and a high \nneck-line. Over that, wear a knee-length overdress with shorter, wider sleeves. \nA belt cinched everything in at the waist. Unmarried women could wear their \nhair down loosely or in braids while married women wore veils draped over \ntheir hair, sometimes held by a band of braided cloth or a circlet of metal that \nwas almost Arabic in style. Plain boots are good for outdoor footwear, while \n“ballerina flat” style shoes make good indoor slippers. \nTo capture the basic look, I would recommend a long-sleeve unstructured \ndress, floor length if possible. If you can find one in a solid color and a natural \nfabric like linen, cotton or wool, great. If you happen to sew, two patterns that \nhave the right basic feel to them are Simplicity 9103 (version D, but longer) \nand McCall’s 7957 (versions A or E). Then accessorize. For hip girdles, look \nin thrift shops for chain-belts with long tails that will hang down your skirts, \nor check the upholstery section of your local fabric store for thick, decorative \ncording that can serve the same purpose. For “older” female characters, veiling \nthe hair is necessary. The veil should be a white or sheer lightweight fabric, not \nbridal veiling or tulle. If your character is wealthy, heavy chain necklaces and \nlarge rings (again, look in thrift stores or “antique malls”) make good additions \nto your costume. You can also add a half or full-circle cloak to top things off. \nTHE WILD WEST \nAll women in the Old West were not saloon girls who wore satin and \nfeathers and showed off their legs. Similarly, all men were not gamblers, \ncowboys, Indians, buckskinned Wild Bill Hickock types, gunslingers or sher- \niffs. They were mostly average farmer types who had more in common with \nLittk House on the Prairie than with Tombstone. Clothes were simple and easy \nto take care of because there were more important things to worry about. The \nmain thing to remember is that the Wild West happened during the Victorian \nera, which means that high fashion echoed English clothing of the time. This \nknowledge can make research quite a bit easier to find since it widens your field \nof reference. \nGuys, things just got easier for you. Men’s clothing had begun to settle into \nthe same basic patterns it follows today, which means that pulling together \nyour outfit might just be as easy as delving into your closet.

The shirts could be white, or solid colors like red or blue, and \nthey often had vertical stripes on a white background. Add a few accessories \nlike a bandanna or a single-breasted vest, and that’s it - \nyou’re done. \nIf you’re planning on playing a cowboy or a gold-miner type, you can even \nget away with blue jeans, just as long as they’re not modern looking. Modem \nin this case means anything really tight fitting or super-baggy, or anything that \nhas labels all over it. Basic, boring, straight-leg Levi’s in dark blue denim are \nthe most accurate match you’ll find today. Also, you should avoid anything \n“something-washed” or ripped, unless you want to look poor. Tom clothes did \nnot denote fashion; they denoted poverty. \nA good, basic piece of costuming to focus on here is the vest. A vest in the \nright style can completely change the character of an outfit. A fancy, double- \nbreasted vest with satin lapels can make a white shirt and dress slacks into a \ngambler’s uniform. Add the low-slung hip-holster and a wide, flat-brimmed \nhat and you’re a gunslinger (although no prop guns in a LARP, please). \nWorking-class types might wear a more plain, single-breasted vest made out of \ncanvas or wool. Suspenders are another good way to achieve a working-class \nlook. They create the impression of a man who spends a lot of time laboring \nwith his jacket off. \nWomen of the era ran the gamut from strictly corseted, bustle-pad- \nwearing Victorian ladies, all the way down to the women who dressed in men’s \nclothes because of the hard labor they did, such as panning for gold or farming. \nBasic fashion dictated a full ankle-length skirt, worn with petticoats and \nbloomers underneath. High-necked white blouses, often with lots of detailed \nstitching, accompanied the look, which often included a short, fitted jacket. \nDresses were cut along similar lines, with close, fitted bodices, long sleeves and \nfull skirts. Everyday wear was mostly cotton or calico-print, while more formal \nwear could be silk or satin or even velvet. Proper women never exposed their \nlegs in public (even sight of an ankle was considered shocking), but in formal \nevening dress, it was common to see low-cut necklines and short sleeves \nexposing the arms. The “fallen angels,” as saloon girls were often called, went \nto even further extremes, sometimes wearing completely sleeveless gowns with \nthe skirts cut scandalously short. The Victorians loved color, and saloon girls \nalso took this favor to extremes, wearing bright, contrasting patterns such as \nstripes and checks together. They wore their hair back, away from the face, and \nthey piled it up in a bun or curls. Shoes should be easy to find, just look for the \nlow-heeled, lace-up “granny-boot” style of today. (There is after all, a reason \nwe call them “granny-boots.”) \n"

      "text": "THE \n(;REAT WAR FRA \nThe time period surrounding the Great War actually suffers from the least \namount of stereotyping of the eras mentioned here. Mostly, that’s because it \nwas a time of major transition: adecade in a world moving from the restrictions \nof the Victorian era to the free spirit of the 1920s with “The War to End All \nWars” thrown in to help move things along. \nMen’s clothing had basically settled into the patterns it follows today, at \nleast in more formal dress. Suits were slightly more fitted at the waist and \nbuttoned higher at the front so that the lapels were shortened. Vests were still \ncommonly worn, and hats were still very much in fashion. Men wore bowlers \nor flat “newsboy” caps for daywear, straw boaters (think Barbershop Quartets) \nin the summer and top hats for the evening. Vertical stripes were very popular \nin both jackets and shirts, usually a darker stripe on a light background, but \ndark suits with pin-stripes were also popular. If you invest in a good tweed or \npinstripe vest and a hat of the appropriate type, you should have two of the \ncornerstones of your costume. All that you’ll need to add to it are the extras, \nlike pocket watches and handkerchiefs. \nWomen’s fashion, on the other hand was all over the place. Women were \nmoving away from the tight restrictions of corsets and long skirts as they moved \nfrom the home into the workplace, although they had not yet achieved the \nfreedom that the 1920’s would give them. Skirts had raised up to mid-calf, \ndaywear allowed women to expose their arms for the first time, and the dancer \nIrene Castle had set the fashion for shorter, wavy hair and decorative headbands \nas well as dresses with flowing drapery and scarves. A suited, menswear style had \nalso come into vogue, due in large part to women taking over in factories and \nsuch while the men were away at war. The ‘Isailor dress” with its uniform details \nwas popular, as was the new “sports” look, which had women in mannish, \ntailored shirts, with ties and fitted jackets. Skirts remained at least calf-length \nand very full, similar to the poodle skirts of the 1950’s (sans poodles). \nA loose, calf-length tank dress in a satiny fabric would work well for \nevening wear. Pair it with a long scarf or rectangle of silky fabric draped around \nyour neck with the ends flowing down your back. (Just be careful of car doors.) \nYou can achieve an even better period silhouette by wrapping a scarf or shawl \naround your hips and then blousing the dress slightly over it. Wear it with a \n“flapper” headband (sequined, with an ostrich plume perhaps) and a few long \nstrands of“pearl” beads to set the look. Stockings or hose and pumps (especially \nthe ones with t-straps) are perfectly acceptable for footwear as women were \nbeginning to show off their ankles. And if you just can’t wrap your brain \nvisually around the look, think 1920’s “flapper” but with longer skirts. \nFor daytime wear, look into pleated skirts and lots of plaids, which were \nvery popular, especially in suits. Simple white blouses worn with short, wide \nneckties or scarves that match the suit make another nice period touch. \nAccessories included clutch bags, gloves and many different styles of hat. \n"

      "text": "WRAPPING UP \nFinally, here are a few basic tips to help with any historic costume design. \nFirst, I meant what I said about research. Go to the library and look up your new \ntime period if you aren’t familiar with it. Most library databases file clothing \nunder the subject followed by the time period and/or the region. The Dark \nAges, for example, would be found under “Costume-12th Century-European,” \nor more specifically “-Italy” or “-England” while the Wild West would be \nfound at “Costume-1 9th Century-Western or -Victorian.’’ For the Great War \nera, look up America or Europe between 1914 and 1919. Some specific book \ntitles that I like are The Mode in Costume by Ruth Turner Wilcox for a good, \ngeneral overview of a lot of different time periods, and American Costume 191 5 \n-1 970, which begins with a nice section on Great War fashion. \nIf you just aren’t the library type, the Internet is your next best bet for \ninformation. There are all kinds of costuming sites and newsgroups online, \nmany ofwhich are happy to help out people with questions. You can start your \nresearch someplace like alt.history.costuming on Usenet, or Costuming Re- \nsources Online at http://members.aol.com/nebula5/costume.html. An excellent \nsource for tips on medieval costuming is the Society for Creative Anachro- \nnism; most of their local web-sites have links to costuming pages. \nFor more visual references, you can watch movies dealing with the time, \nas long as they are well made with authentic costuming. I like Zeferelli’s Hamkt \n(yes, the one with Me1 Gibson) for its Dark Age costuming, as well as the \nCudfuel mystery series on PBS. Corny as it sounds, Littk House on the Prairie had \nthe whole settler look down fairly well. While I wouldn’t recommend sitting \nthrough all of that saccharine goodness just for a few costuming tips, if you \nhappen to stumble across a re-run, it wouldn’t hurt to take a look. For the Great \nWar, check out Legends ofthe Fall with Brad Pitt, Galipoli starring Me1 Gibson \n(he does seem to like those costume dramas) or Julie Andrews in Darling Lily \n(just remember that the fast-forward button can be your friend.) \nLast, but certainly not least, here are a few generic tips for historical dress \nthat I would like to pass on since a lot of people tend to overlook them. Try to \navoid wearing any kind of modem shoe with your costume, especially any sort \nof athletic shoe. It doesn’t matter what they look like or if they are black-they \nwill never look right. And except in specific circumstances, a cape should \nabsolutely, positively be the last thing that you buy for a costume. No really. It \ndoesn’t cover up your street clothes; it just makes your street clothes look out \nof place. \nAgain, research is the key to good costuming for live-action play. Find a \nlook that appeals to you, and copy it as best you can. A good costume can go \na long way to establishing a living, breathing (or not) character and make your \nroleplaying more compelling and entertaining for everyone involved. \n"

If you’re reading these pages, chances \nare good that civilization didn’t actually come to an end when our computer- \nized clocks turned over at midnight January 1st. If it did end and you’re still \nreading, I applaud your dedication. For those of you who are new to the \npublication, let me take a second to acquaint you with just what you’ve got \nhere. (For those who’ve read this before, you may skip ahead to “Deadguy \nSpeaks.” If you do, however, you’ll miss the big news at the end.) \nThe Journal is a quarterly publication dedicated to filling in the gaps in \nyour White Wolf LARP environment. We offer rules for new character types, \noriginal story lines to work into your chronicles, guides for keeping your games \nunder control and running smoothly and rules updates you won’t find in any \nother Mind’s Eye release. Plus, you’ll find answers to the questions that have \nplagued you, original World of Darkness fiction and columns from people \nwho’ve been LARPing or working here at White Wolf (or both) for years. \nIn this issue, we take a look at the wraithly environment of the Great War \nera, the dying Bunyip of the Savage West and vampire Vikings known as the \neinherjur. And that’s just a sample of what’s in store for you here. We’ll also take \na look at what you’ve missed in previous issues (if you’re joining us late) and \nwhat to expect in thefutureofMind’sEyeTheatre and White Wolf ingeneral. \nIn future issues of the Journal, we’ll present some of the material that had \nto be left out of Laws of the East, tips on how to deal with character death.and \nsome expanded information on the hideous fomori. \nAnd you can help make the Journal even better. Send us letters on your \nopinions about the state of live-action roleplaying today. Send us questions \nabout the features and rules you see here, as well as notes about the broken rules \nyou come across in different MET publications. Send us horror stories about \ngames gone wrong and how your player characters fixed them. We’re interested \nin all aspects of live-action roleplaying, and we want to know what you think. \nStick around. The Journal is on the cutting edge of the live-action genre; \nwe’ve got something for everybody.

They’re Nosferatu. \n- \nAn unnamed LARPer at the first ICC \nIt’s spring, and young LARPers thoughts are turning to love. Actually, as I’m writing \nthis it’s early fall and North Carolina is bilge-pumping its way out from under Hurricane \nFloyd’s drooling problem. So while I wait for the floodwaters to recede, now is as good a time \nas any to discuss something that’s been weighing on my mind for a while. \nOne of the most remarkable things about live-action roleplaying, and Mind’s Eye \nTheatre in particular, is that it is about as gender balanced as the roleplaying industry gets. \n(Yes, I know that there are exceptions to the rule out there, unfortunately they’re \nexceptions. Don’t write in with angry comments about your all-female Warhammer 40K \ngame. I’d be forced to post the letter, and then you’d be inundated with hordes of desperate \nguys who’d want to show you their Gorkamorkas). The sad fact of the matter is that people \nwho play hobby games are still predominantly male, despite a slow trend toward gender \nbalance over the last decade or so. The lone real exception to this slant toward the surging \nseas of testosterone is, strangely enough, live-action roleplaying. (And again, just because \nyour game doesn’t follow this trend doesn’t mean that it’s representative, honest - \nthere \nare plenty of other people out there who just aren’t as cool as you are.) Depending on whom \nyou ask, MET games average anywhere from 35% to 50% female, which is really remarkable \nfor an outgrowth of an industry whose stereotypical image is five guys huddling around a \ntable in someone’s parents’ basement. \nOf course, there’s been one unforeseen outgrowth of the fact that a growing number \nof women are using MET as their first tentative step into the gudgeon-infested waters of \nroleplaying. Namely, it’s that a growing number of women are using MET as their first \ntentative step into the gudgeon-infested waters of roleplaying, and the guys who were \nformerly lords of the game preserve have no idea what to do now that their game has been \ninfiltrated by (Gasp! Shudder!) gurn*ls. While most men who roleplay are genuinely glad \nto see more gender balance in their hobby - \nfor one thing, it cuts down on the number of \nheavily bearded bikers who are claiming to be waiflike Toreador named Mitzi - \nthere are \na few adjustments that have to be made by folks who just can’t get used to the notion that \nroleplaying isn’t just a boys’ club anymore. For one thing, they have to leave that dog-eared \ncopy of Cult of Ecstasy home instead of passing it around during Storyteller breaks. For \nanother, naming characters “Benjamin Dover,” “Richard Dover” and “Eileen Dover” is \nright out, as is spending endless hours trying to convince the Storyteller that you really do \nneed to create a Brothels Influence for your character because “he’s one bad mack daddy of \na vampire pimp who needs his hos.” (If the Storyteller is wise, he’ll flip the player in question \na box of ho-hos at this point, which often serves as a suitable distraction, as well as an in- \ngame prop that doesn’t violate the no-weapons policy.) \nThankfully, gender integration of a Mind’s Eye Theatre game usually flenses much of \nthe middle-school-level bathroom humor out of the game’s foundation (although not \nalways - \nthere’s inevitably some genius who thinks that he’s getting away with something \nbecause he’s given his Garou a name like “Licks-Own-Eyebrows”). Unfortunately, in \naddition to removing that particular flavor of idiocy, the growing gender-integration of \nLARPs brings with it an entirely new and terrifying problem. \nThat problem is romance, or the imagined possibility thereof. \n\n\nI\n_\n \nform intended to dismiss the possibility ’or worthwhile nature of same-sex romance in the \nLARPing community. I will say, however, that this column concerns itself with the \nromantic entanglements arising from the influx of women into MET, which means we’re \nprimarily talking about those wacky breeders here. \nSeriously, let’s look at the situation. Roleplaying can become a profoundly intense \nactivity. Intense activities produce intense emotions, and seasoning the whole mess with \nhormones percolated by stylish costumes and low-cut dresses doesn’t help. The line between \na character’s feelings and a player’s feelings can get a trifle blurred, particularly when people \nindulge in romantic plot lines in an effort to make their games more adult. It can get tricky, \nto say the least. People mistake in-character feelings for out-of-character ones. Character \nconflicts can spill over into out-of-play relationships, or out-of-play squabbles can be \nbrought into play with disastrous consequences. Let’s face it, do you really want to be playing \nthe character your best friend’s SO decides to have an in-character affair with on the night \nthey have a big fight? Or how about seeing the gentleman who’s had a crush on your lady \nlove for months trying to initiate a romantic “plot” with her that just might be an attempt \nto get closer to her in preparation for making an actual play in real life? And let’s not even \nget into the possibility of a couple of players having a bitter breakup and splitting the game \ndown the middle. After all, Isaac’s friends don’t want to roleplay with Ginny’s friends, and \nGinny’s friends don’t want to roleplay with Isaac’s, and suddenly the Storyteller is running \ntwice as many games because her marvelous, tight-knit little LARP has been split in two. \nIn short, then, romantic entanglements gone wrong can wreak a world of harm on a \ngame. There are preventative measures that can be taken, of course. Warning players before \neach game to keep their in-game and out-of-game affairs separate at least makes them think \ntwice before trundling off for an “In-character nekkid Thaumaturgy lesson” in the broom \ncloset. Keeping an eye out for inappropriate behavior during games (yes, the “No Touching” \nrule applies even to consensual fondling of the one-eyed trouser snake, and don’t try to tell \nme it’s a “new kind of animal ghoul”) is also important. In addition, players should remember \nthat there’s a world of difference between playing a character who’s an unrepentant sexist (or \nworse) in-game and offending other players for real with that sort of behavior. At no point \nshould the verisimilitude of roleplaying take precedence over the very real concerns of the \npeople behind the characters. I don’t care if it’s “in character” to indulge in nonconsensual \nscenarios or the like. There are just some lines you don’t cross, even in a game situation. \nStill, once all of the minefields have been crossed and the potential tiger pits dodged, \nthere’s every chance that at any given game, a couple of folks are going to - \nfor lack of a \nbetter term - \nhook up. The concept makes a great deal of sense, actually. I mean, when a \nLARPer meets a LARPer a-comin’ through the rye (or the arts center or the basement of \nthe local YMCA or wherever), they’ve got astep up on any other potential relationship they \nmight have. After all, they’re already assured of being past the necessity of trying to explain \ntheir weird roleplaying hobby to a prospective sweetie. Even better, they’ve got at least one \nshared interest, not to mention a nigh-infinite source of cheap dates. There’s less chance \nthan usual that there’s going to be relationship strife over spending money on, say, \nroleplaying books rather than roses, and you can always explain away that case ofwandering \neye as the result of the Toreador clan weakness. (Note: Make sure you’re actually playing \na Toreador when you try that one. Otherwise, you’re liable to discover precisely how thick \nthe new edition of Laws of the Night is when your former sweetie makes you eat it.) \nStill, even with all of these advantages, there are still tremendous obstacles standing \nin the way of true MET romance. The LARPers themselves lovingly erect most of those \nobstacles, but then again, the course of true love ne’er did run smooth. In all honestly, where \n\n\nLARP is concerned, the course of true love tends to stagger drunkenly and carom off the \noccasional wall, but even so, the point’s the same. It’s not easy. \nA big part of the problem is communication. After all, it’s hard enough to tell when \nsomeone’s attracted to you in real life. When you slather characters over that, the confusion \nfactor increases exponentially. Just to test this theory, the fine folks at White Wolf hooked \nelectrodes up to the cranium of a fresh-faced young male LARPer of more than standard \nattractiveness and then recorded his thoughts. What they got was quite enlightening: \n“She digs me. She really digs me. No, wait, she doesn’t dig me, she digs my character. \nGood thing I took Study as a Social Trait. Hmm. Maybe she really digs me. I dig her. Well, \nI dig her character. I haven’t actually met her. If she’s anything like her character, I would \ndig her, though. I wonder if she’s anything like her character. I wonder if she’s wondering \nif I’m anything like my character. I wonder if she’s wondering about my wondering about \nher wondering. She winked. I think her character digs me. I think I need to go sit in a dark \ncorner and shake for half an hour. I wonder if she digs shaking in dark comers.. ..” \nUnfortunately, the test subject’s head exploded at this point, and any further data was \nlost as the valiant researchers were forced to scrape his brains off the ceiling tiles lest they \nlose the deposit on the lab. The point, however, is clear. Communication on the ever- \ntouchy matter of attraction is extremely, extremely difficult even at the best of times. \n(In case you were wondering, by the way, she really did dig him, which is pretty much \na tribute to the poor kid’s remarkable personality. After all, no one looks all that studly with \nelectrodes sticking out of his brain.) \nWith that in mind, here are afew basic tips to make communication in matters like this \na bit more straightforward and prevent the loss of more perfectly innocent ceiling tiles. \nGuys, if a woman at the game says “Hi,” she means (and I know you’re not going to \nbelieve me when I say this, but trust me here) “hi.” She’s being polite. She’s making asocially \nacceptable greeting with the minimum number of syllables possible. She most emphatically \ndoes not mean “Shanghai me to your lair in the Scottish Highlands, you ravishing black- \nclad brute, and help me to raise a litter of sturdy little hellions to someday wear your adopted \nclan tartan.” Be thankful she’s actually using a spoken syllable, rather than a curt nod. The \nbest thing to do is to say “Hi” back. \nTrust me here. If she actually wants to hold a discussion with you or spend more time \nin your company, she’ll demonstrate it with (Gasp!) multi-syllabic words. However, if you \ntake a simple greeting as anything more than what it actually is, you instantly get yourself \nfiled under “DO Not Speak To, Even if the Fate of the Human Race Depends on It.” Don’t \nthink I’m kidding, either. Desperation is not an attractive personality trait, and seizing on \na simple greeting as an expression of a barely contained lascivious longing is pretty much \nequivalent to tattooing the word Desperate on your forehead, pectorals and inner thighs as \nfar as indicators go. \nHowever, gents, if you do respond in a manner that proves that you don’t think savoir \nfuire is the next town over from Perth Amboy, you might actually put yourself in a position \nto have a meaningful, interesting conversation. Mind you, that’s not the same as guarantee- \ning that you’ll be an irresistible studmuffin, but owning your own Lear Jet is about the only \nthing that can guarantee that. While you’re waiting for your first billion to accrue, though, \ndecent conversation with someone who thinks that you’re more highly evolved than a \nforaminifera isn’t necessarily too shabby. Besides, it can make a great starting point - \nit’s \nalways nice when the woman you’re interested in doesn’t automatically look at you like \nyou’re a month-old bowl of egg salad. \nOn the other hand, ladies, bear in mind that any gentleman worth his salt is desperately \ntrying to avoid looking, well, desperate. He’s going to do everything in his power to separate \n\n\nhimself from the drooling cape-clad hordes. Mostly, that translates to being willfully \nchivalrous above and beyond the call of duty. Because it would be the lizard-brained \nhorndog thing to do to notice when someone is expressing interest in him, your basic Decent \nGent is going to go out of his way not to notice when someone’s flashing the come*hither \nsign. It doesn’t matter if the sign is 40 feet tall and made of neon and depleted uranium; he’s \ngoing to make a manful, chivalrous effort not to notice it. \nUnfortunately, there’s no quick and easy way around that sort of deliberate self- \nflagellation. (Figurative, folks, it’s figurative. Put the riding crops down and relax.) The best \nthing to do is simply to open up a friendly conversation and let the poor boy’s own baser \ninstincts betray him. After all, it’s a lot easier to ask forgiveness than permission, and it’s a \nlot harder for even the most self-sacrificing LARPer to flog himself over his self-described \nboorish behavior when it’s bloody obvious that any expressed interest is mutual. \nOf course, the big mistake that most LARPers make when trying to win themselves \ndates is one that’s actually quite easy to avoid. Unfortunately, once the fake fangs go in, the \ncommon sense goes out, at least on this issue. Simply put, when it comes time to strut their \nbest stuff, entirely too many MET players instead chose to show how witty, talented, \npowerful and attractive their characters are. Now a man more snide than myself (if such a \nman exists) might say that this is why it’s really called fantasy roleplaying, but I think it’s \njust a matter of folks wanting to show off something they’re proud of. \nUnfortunately, there’s no easy way to say this: They Can’t Date Your Character \nInstead Of You. Ahem. Sorry about that, but it needed to be said. Seriously though, think \nabout it. Why on earth would you waste your time showing off how butch your character (the \npersonality you borrow on the occasional weekend) is, when you really want someone to be \ninterested in you? Sure, it’s fun to show off and tell war stories, but if you ever think your \ncharacter stands a better chance of going home from the game with company than you do, \nit’s time to stop working on advancing your character and start working on advancing \nyourself. \nThen again, getting the relationship going is only half the battle. Sustaining it in the \nface of overwhelming odds is the hard part. It’s a truism that one of the most attractive \nqualities aperson can have is to be attached. That means that the first game after aromantic \nconnection is established is liable to look like an outtake from the new Fox special, “World’s \nMost Desperate Swarms,” as newly interested parties of all genders and orientations descend \non the happy couple. The attention can be head turning, and God help the poor fool whose \nhead actually does get turned. If he’s lucky, he’ll just get slapped. If he’s not, he’ll suddenly \nacquire a reputation as a “LARP slut” that he won’t be able to remove with anything short \nof joining the Federal Witness Protection Program. \nOne of the most common strategies used to ward off the swarms of would-be paramours \nis exaggerated affectionate behavior. Technically known as “PDA,” or “Public Displays of \nAffection,” this technique includes (but is not limited to) cuddling, using of pet names even \nin character, game breaks for smooches and quickies in the broom closet. While this approach \ndefinitely lets the world know that someone is taken, it runs a definite risk. After all, there’s \nonly so much sickly sweet romanticism that immortal lords of the night can endure. After one \ntoo many “Sweeties” or “Snookylumpums,” other players might be willing to test the \nboundaries of the “no touching” rule with buckets of ice water. Conversely, they may mistake, \n“Get a tomb,” for, “Get a room,” and stake the cute couple just to shut them up. \nStill, excessive uses of Chill of the Windsaber can’t halt true love (although excessive \nPeter Cook imitations can come close). Every so often, luck, skill, devotion and love \ntriumph, and a couple of soul mates find each other through MET. If you are one of the lucky \nfew to find marital bliss with someone you met at a game, I just have one humble request \nfor you: \n\n\nFor the love of God, do not have a Vampire-themed wedding. Yeah, yeah, it \ncommemorates how you met. It’s certain to be a big hit with your friends from the game. It’ll \nfreak your parents, and it might even cut down on the catering bill, depending on how far \nyou take the gag. But remember, in 10 years, you’re going to have to explain it to your kids, and \nthey’re going to want to know why you two looked like such rampaging dorks. Trust me, \nyou’ll look back at your wedding pictures and they’ll look as hip and edgy as the wedding \nscene in the Rocky Horror Picture Show, hopefully with fewer instances of Tim Curry. \nThe fact that you and your SO found each other through the game is heartening, charming \nand (ultimately) a reaffirmation of everything good about the game. But frankly, even the \nfolks who make the game wouldn’t get that excited about it. Cherish the memory, but make \nsure the new ones you make are ones you can live with. \n- Ad$- \n\n\nMFMORIFS AND FXCUSFS \nby James A. Moore \nJim Moore has written for many White Wolf books in the company’s history. He \nhas covered all manner of subjects fiom hunters to fomuri to the mysterious Shih. In \nthis story, Jim brings his considerable range to bear, showing us how the times may \nchange, but the things that make us who we are never do. \nIt’s cold here. But then, most places seem cold to me. \nI remember the warmth of the Valley of the Kings, and in comparison to the \nglory of the sun on the Nile, most places seem chilled and desolate. Kristin liked to \ncall me a romantic, but even after all these years, I fear I am merely a sentimentalist. \nI like to remember better times and warmer hearts than the ones I encounter in the \nmodem age. \nEven those few I can call fnends - \nthose whom I’ve encountered again and again \nover the centuries - \nseem to have lost the warmth and passion that once made them \nso vibrant and alive. Of my own kind, the Reborn, there are only a few I would even \nconsider speaking to. Even then, my association with them would be a courtesy, not \nbecause I care for them. We might fight for the same things, but we have nothing in \ncommon except a long-standing hatred for Set and his ilk. But even that dulls with time. \nThere was a time when I was more adventurous, more enthusiastic than I am \nthese days. I made many friends in that distant past and, from time to time, I still have \noccasion to meet with old acquaintances. \nAnd they too have grown colder, those few who were not taken by Death in the \ncourse of the last 5,000 years. Or perhaps it is I who have forgotten the passions of \nlife. I cannot judge the truth in these matters. I am simply not capable of deciphering \nthe facts from my memories. Sometimes the truth hides behind fond memories and \nother times it remains buried beneath the nightmares that have haunted me for as \nlong as I can remember. \nThe first time I met Kristin Breiner was one of the golden moments for me, one \nof those rare, almost magical times when I ran across a kindred spirit. I had never met \nanyone quite like her. However, at the time, I did not immediately realize that she \nwas in fact a woman. All I saw was the armor she wore, the weapons she carried and \nthe rage in her eyes as she struck down her foes in the name of the Christian god. She \nrode with the crusaders, tearing into Jerusalem with a fury that was admirable, and \na thirst for blood that was terrifying. \nI was in Jerusalem, visiting with another of my kind whom I had last seena lifetime \nago, when the Christians came to claim the city as their own. Their righteous \nindignation was real in some cases, but in others it was obviously a simple veil to \nobscure the greed with which they came to plunder what they had no legitimate claim \nto. Greed. It’s always there, always waiting to suck the minds and morals away from \nanyone who dares get too close and make even the most civilized of us revert to \nbarbarism. Greed may die in individuals, but it lives on in the human spirit. \n\n\nbecame obsessed with the belief that anyone who lived a different lifestyle must \nsurely be evil and therefore expendable. Never mind that the people might have rich \ncultures filled with beautiful stories and wonderful wisdom. Put aside that these \nothers also had lives, loves and ambitions. They were different, and that was excuse \nenough. Many were the creatures other than human that met with death in those \ntimes. The fae vanished from the world and took with them the best parts of the past. \nThey left behind a world filled with bitter, frustrated souls looking to lash out and \nreturn the pain and loss they experienced. \nThose souls were very successful in spreading the misery and woe around for all \nto share. And the force that held these opposing forces apart, cementing them as \nenemies and fueling their passion for blood and death was the name that almost \nalways seems to drive mortals to such extremes. Religion was the culprit. \nThe year was 1099, I believe, and the Crusaders came into the city with a battle \ncry that must surely have echoed through every comer of the world. Their hatred of \nthe Muslims was a living, seething thing, and the greed that drove them was at least \nas vile. They swarmed through the city, killing anyone - \nregardless of age, sex or \nreligious conviction - \nas if their sole purpose was to free the Christians within the \ncity. I found it rather odd that these saviors came without request and killed the very \nChristians they’d allegedly come to save along with the rest of the people living in \nthe place they all claimed was holy. \nFor their part, I suspect they found it odd that I did not flee. Kristin certainly \ndid. She approached me on her black charger with drawn, bloody sword, ready to \ncut me down where I stood, but all I did was look at her. I had already killed several \nof the Crusaders who were not wise enough to leave me in peace. I am short in \nstature, but even then, I had already spent hundreds of years learning to defend \nmyself from attackers. \nI suppose she could have killedme then, but she chose not to. Instead, she looked \ninto my eyes and recognized me for what I was. She saw that I, like her, was not quite \nhuman. For my part, I saw only the faintest hint of eyes beneath the helmet she wore, \na great visored thing that must surely have been too large for her. \n“Why don’t you run?” she asked me, her voice hoarse from endless battle cries. \n“Why don’t you attack?” was my simple answer. \nShe had to think about that one. Certainly, a great number of people had fallen \nvictim to her sword in the nights before. The streets themselves were sticky with the \nblood of the slain, and their heads often adorned the walls surrounding the city. How \nodd it must have seemed to her that I, far smaller than the average person, was not \namong the dead. It was obvious that I’d made no attempt to hide myself. Finally, she \nlaughed and shook her head, taking her helmet off and looking at me with eyes as \nbright as the noonday sun. “Because you are braver than you should be, or more \nfoolish than most. Either way, stranger, you are not mine to take.” \nI thanked her for her kindness. She knew as well as I did that the thanks was as \nmocking as the courtesy she afforded me. She laughed again, a soft, melodic sound \nfrom so savage a warrior. And in that moment I knew I’d found a kindred spirit, \nanother who had seen too much and done too much in a very short time. She asked \nme if I was a Follower of Set, and in a return of her earlier courtesy, I merelv said no \n\n\ninstead of killing her. To me, that was evidence enough that she was something \nremarkable. That, or the simple fact that I had long ago grown tired of killing anyone \nwho inadvertently offended me. Before the night was over, we had become.. . if not \nfriends, at least friendly acquaintances. \nWe spoke of many things through the course of that long night. We spoke of \nthe differences between her people and mine. We talked of the changing face of the \nworld, a place that was not as calm as either of us would have liked. In the end, we \nspoke of the mortals we’d known and cared for who had faded from our lives, stolen \nfrom us by the sands of time. She had watched from a distance as her son grew old \nand died. She did not want him to know of her new existence. I spoke of my beloved \nwife and her death at the hands of Set himself. We talked of philosophies and \nreligious beliefs. We conversed on the strange ways in which the world had changed \nsince each of us had become something other than mortal. She listened when I spoke \nof the long-gone glory days of my homeland, Khem. I, in turn, listened to the tale of \nhow she had become what she now was, and how the years had changed her \nperceptions. I heard her talk of another of her kind, one she only called the Reaver, \nand her long-standing personal war with him. She did not tell me why they fought, \nand I did not ask. It’s possible that she did not even remember any more. \nJust before the sun rose, she bid me farewell and warned me to leave Jerusalem. \nWhile she had been willing to spare me, there were others who would not think twice \nof destroying me, and there were some whose power even one such as she had reason \nto fear. \nI wished her well and left Jerusalem behind. My fellow Reborn, with whom I had \nalready finished my business, had left days before, puzzled by my need to stay and \nwatch the violence that had come to that holy city. I could not have explained the \nneed myself; I only knew it was real. I only understood that the violence and \ndestruction should be wimessed by someone who was not involved in its making. \nWitnessed and remembered. \n... \nHow many years was it before I saw Kristin again?More than I care to remember, \nand I am far too lazy to count them. Suffice to say, the world had moved on again \nbefore we ran across each other. The Renaissance was in full bloom by then. The \nwealthy poured their monies into employing artists to glorify their homes, and they \nworked behind the scenes to kill each other with greater subtlety than I’d have ever \nimagined the Europeans would achieve. The sciences were doing their best to push \nreligions and faith to the side. They were gaining ground, but it was a slow, painful \nprocess. The de Medici’s were throwing yet another party, and I was their special \nguest. I was someone to show off to their friends, an educated man from the place they \ncalled Egypt, which was, by that time, something of a rarity. \nThey meant me to be their pet for the duration of their interest. It is remarkably \neasy to forgive both ignorance and avarice when you know you will be alive long after \nthe fools who show it are forgotten. I forgave the powers of that era many sins. I had \nseen them all before when they wore different clothes. Time teaches us to tolerate \nthe brutish and short dreams of human life as it forces us to witness them again and \nagain and again. \nStill, even my patience was being tested by the time the slim, pale hand touched \nmy skin. In that time, it was rare to be touched by anyone I did not know. I was, after \n\n\nall, merely a plaything, a prize to display. Contact was normally reserved for those \na person had feelings for or had purchased for the night. \nAlthough centuries had passed, I looked into Kristin’s eyes and recognized her \nimmediately. The face I had last seen covered in soot and blood was clean and \nheavily painted with make up. Still, she had lost none ofher intensity. I must confess \nto being a bit surprised that she recognized me. I have never considered myself a \nremarkable or striking figure. Yet, she had seen me across a crowded room and made \nher way to my side in a matter of minutes. \nAs I said before, the party had grown boring for me, and my hosts had lost \ninterest in what I was doing. We moved away from their palatial estates and through \nthe streets of Florence. She was dressed in finery that made it hard for me to believe \nshe had once been a crusader, but then, I was hardly dressed as a follower of the \nShemsu-heru philosophies myself. \nWe spent a week together. Every night we talked and debated about the changes \nthat had taken place in the world since last we met. To her way of thinking, the \nchanges were all for the better. To me, they merely reflected the intellectual growth \nof a society finally moving from childhood into puberty. Surely, the power of the \nChurch was as great as ever, and from her own perspective, the time of her people \nbeing feared had faded to distant memory. How then could this be progress? \nI wish I could explain how hard it is to find an intellectual equal when you are \nimmortal. You might find sharp, even brilliant minds among the mortals, but \ndiscussing matters of significance with them is rather like debating the importance \nof the world’s economy with a prepubescent. They might grasp the concepts of the \ndiscussion, they might even get the general ideas you are approaching and find them \ninsightful, but they lack the experience to truly comprehend the nuances of the \nconversation. Spending that week with Kristin made me realize how lonely 1 was for \ntrue companionship. And although neither of us had planned it, before our time \ntogether was over we had become lovers. Of a sort. \nKristin had to move on. She meant her time in Florence to be brief, and the \nReaver, whom she had once pursued, now returned the favor with a ferocious \ndetermination. Again, I refused to ask about him for fear of invading Kristin’s \nprivacy. Perhaps I should have said something or become involved sooner, but she \nmade it clear that such was not my place. \nNonetheless, she had plans of her own, back in her homelands of Austria. I too \nwould be leaving soon, as I had been feeling the siren call of Khem in my heart for \nmany months and been weakening in my resolve never to return to the place where \nI was born. I could no longer even remember why I had chosen to stay away from \nEgypt for all time. And there were matters I had to attend to that she, despite her \nwisdom, could never know about - \njust as surely as there were events in her life that \nwere beyond my comprehension. Although we had been intimate, although we had \nsurely become friends, we still had our secrets from each other. We are, after all, from \ntwo breeds that believe in the power of secrets. \nI have often looked back on that time with a fondness that is almost unsettling. \nTo scan back over the years and reflect on a few chance encounters is unnerving in \nlight of the centuries I have walked the earth. We resolved to remain in contact, and \nas so often happens, we let the strength of our resolution falter as the decades moved \npast. The friends we think we can never live without, the loves who make our world \nbright and keep us safe from our personal demons fade to dim reminders of a time \n\n\nwhen the world seemed almost innocent. I remain awed by the power of those \nfeelings, that they can hold sway over an intellect and crush reason with their \nglorious, powerful energies. Love and friendship, it seems to me, are capable of \nmaking even the worst possible situations seem not only survivable, but pleasant. I \nmention this merely to make a point. In my long, long life, I have only ever had a \nhandful of friends. Of all of them, only Kristin remained constant. \nYet, when we met again, we did so as enemies. \n* e *  \nI had moved to the New World. I traveled through the lands that had never \nbeen known to exist during my first life, and 1 gathered information along the way. \nI spent almost 40 years in the region called Mexico, and during that time I \nlearned things I had never expected to learn from the native Reborn - \nwho called \nthemselves the Xibabla, a name I have long since adopted for them. \nI met two others like myself. One was a vile creature, filled with hatred and \nsadistic glee. The other was a woman of rare beauty who learned of my people as I \nlearned of hers. It was in her defense that I warred against the vampires coming from \nthe north, spilling into the region like vermin. The strange part about it was that we \ndidn’t realize it was the vampires moving into the area. They are subtle creatures \nwhen the need arises, and we foolishly thought it was only the citizens of the United \nStates doing what they could to conquer still more land for their endless appetite. \nI had seen greed often enough, I thought, to recognize its new attire. \nWe learned the error of our ways quickly enough. The vampires were indeed \ninvading, and they were warring amongst themselves. What we’d thought was a \nsimple expansionist movement was actually a civil war. Those of the undead who \nwanted to live in harmony with humans fought against those who wanted to raise \nhumans as cattle and slaughter them freely. In all honesty, we had trouble tellingone \ngroup from another. \nI suppose it was simple naivete that made me believe that a continent with so \nfew people would actually be big enough to make wars a thing of the past. The \nindigenous tribes already peopled the “New World.” The Europeans who came into \nthe area weren’t happy to find more of the “godless” heathens in their way. Even 300 \nor more years after the land had been discovered in the first place, there were still \nplenty of good “God-fearing Christians’’ who wanted to convert the ignorant masses \nto the their way of thinking. It didn’t matter that the very people they wished to \neducate had already been converted centuries before. It only mattered that they be \ntaught the error of their ways.. . and that they be willing to accept their new teachers \nas landlords. Centuries, millennia had passed since I was Reborn, but this did not \nchange: the greedy still used religion as an excuse to commit atrocities. The \nCrusades, the Inquisition and now the pioneers and their Manifest Destiny. I didn’t \nmean to be amused by the whole sordid business, but I was just the same. \nI wasn’t laughing when they attacked the hacienda where I was staying. I didn’t \nlaugh at all when they burned my home to the ground and destroyed many precious \nartifacts from my distant past. My home was destroyed, and I was dragged behind a \nhorse for several miles before they cut me loose. If I’d been a mortal, I’d have surely \ndied. As I had a few magicsof my own, I was saved that inconvenience. I was scraped, \nbloodied and left for dead. In retrospect, I realized why they had attacked me. In \ncoming from the land of the Nile, my body had taken on a hue much like that of the \n\n\nnatives of the area in which I had chosen to settle. The pioneers considered me just \nanother impediment to their “progress.” \nIn short, they made a very bad mistake. \nI do not seek conflict very often, but when I do, I make my presence very well \nknown indeed. Just as I’d spent hundreds of years learning to defend myself, I’d spent \ncenturies learning how to fight and to kill. Over the centuries I’ve learned a few tricks \nabout tracking down a foe. My enemies learned the hard way that I am unforgiving \nto a fault when the mood strikes me. It is not a skill I sought, but I acquired it \nnonetheless, like a taste for something vile and unexpected. \nOver the course of a week, I hunted them down and killed them from the \nshadows, until, at last, I was left with the two who were not human. I resorted to older \ntactics when I realized how little damage the bullets from my rifle did to them. I used \na hunting bow and arrows. The first of them dropped easily, impaled on an arrow that \nran through his back and cut deeply into his heart. He was not dead, but he would \nbe before I was finished. \nThat’s when she hit me from behind. Kristin used the very same tactics I had \nused to hunt down her party to hunt me down. She tracked me by my footprints, and \nshe attacked when I was busy preparing her friend for the dawn’s first light. As I was \ntying his body in a spot where the sun would find him, she shot me in the back. \nI lay dying on the ground berating myself for my foolhardy arrogance. I took the \npain as a lesson for my next incarnation. When I opened my eyes to breathe my last, \nKristin stared into my face. Her cold blue eyes spilled tears of crimson grief upon me, \nand she held my body close as I passed beyond the mortal realms. My heart broke to \nrecognize my killer, and in my last accusing glare, I saw her wither and recoil. She \nknew what she had done, and for the first time in many years, I made her feel guilty. \nI did not know the extent of her involvement in what her men did to me, but that \ndid not matter. \nI did not stay dead. My kind almost never does. Kristin knew that much, and \nshe did her best to make my return to the living a comfortable matter. I was buried \nin a tomb above ground rather than in a deep hole. With my body she left three \npounds of gold and a simple note that read, ‘‘I am so very sorry. I have missed you over \nthe years. Please forgive me, K.” \nI forgave her. In killing me, it’s just possible that she saved my sanity. I had fallen \ninto the very trap that I saw so many others fall into, you see. I had not truly sought \nretribution for what had happened to my home or my possessions. I had settled into \nthe very habits and small-minded pettiness that humans have indulged in since my \nmortal days. Even though I am so much more than they, I had fallen to their level. \nI had hunted down and killed a dozen people in order to gain satisfaction. Was I then \nany better than the Crusaders I condemned? Or the expansionists who used religion \nas an excuse to take what they wanted? \nNo. I was foolish and filled with pride. I was offended that they would dare \ninconvenience me. They took material possessions from me, and in return, I took \nthat most sacred of possessions from them, their very lives. I have always tried to \nremember that what I sometimes see as a curse is also a blessing. Even if I am killed, \nit is only an inconvenience. I will recover; I will go on. \n\n\nSo, I forgave Kristin, and I got on with my life. In the end, I could not afford not \nto. To do otherwise in an existence devoid of anything lasting that is truly good \nwould be worse than foolish. \n* a *  \nWe met again in the next century, sooner than I’d anticipated. I remained in \nthe New World and eventually located in California. The heat of the desert sun was \ncomforting. Even after years and centuries away from the warmth of the Nile, I still \npreferred the warmth of the barren places and the heat that Ra shone down upon me \nin such locales. Los Angeles was a melting pot even back then. Despite the growing \nwar in Europe, the people of the United States were still optimistic. They remained \ncertain that the Kaiser would be defeated and that the beliefs of their young country \nwould be upheld. The war was nothing new. The optimism of the young and far- \nremoved was nothing new either. All that had changed was the setting and the \ncostumes. \nI found Kristin that time, instead of her finding me. She was in a bar singing \nsongs for a crowd that was getting uglier by the minute. It seems that despite having \nchanged her last name to Williams, someone somewhere had learned of her \nGermanic origins. That was enough to cause her grief. Even the fact that she had \napparently owned the club and had been a popular local figure in Los Angeles for \nyears by that point did not matter. \nShe was dressed in a dark blue gown, and her voice carried across the room, lifted \nby angels one could almost believe, as I could hear her singing even in the farthest \ncorners of the hidden den of delights. I watched her, studied her and remembered our \nprevious encounters. We had met three times, and each of those encounters \nremained with me. Odd though it sounds, I still felt a connection with her, a desire \nto be near her. In a world of revolving constants, she was a familiar landmark that \nI was actually glad to see again. \nI went into the nightclub every night to hear her sing, and I wondered if I would \never get up the courage to make my presence known. One of the many tricks I learned \nin Mexico from the strange Reborn I met there was how to hide my true face. That \nwas a talent that saved me from many a conflict over the years, and one I still employ \nregularly. Unless one can see past the extra foot of height and the change in eye hair \nand skin color, one can’t easily see any connection between the person I become and \nthe person I am. If Kristin had that talent, she hid it well. \nI had finally decided to let her see me for who I am when the fight erupted. \nKristin was between sets, talking to a couple of rather drunken mortals when one of \nthem decided to have his way with her right there in the bar. Kristin very calmly \nknocked him unconscious. That was when the trouble began. The fool had friends, \nand they did not take well to his injury, despite the fact that he had brought it on \nhimself. \nI realized another sad fact about human nature at that moment. Religion is not \nthe only excuse used when battle is in the air. There are always other justifications. \nAlthough the US was not yet at war with Germany, everyone knew that it was only \na matter of time before they stepped into the whole sordid affair. The louts in the bar \nwere no exception. There were comments made about Kristin being an agent of the \nKaiser, and then there were noises about her being a spy. \n\n\nI ask you, can you imagine any place less likely for a spy than in a nightclub in \nLos Angeles an entire ocean away from the theater of war? That didn’t seem to \nmatter. All that any of the fools cared about was showing their dissatisfaction with \nthe woman who’d injured their cohort. The political accusations merely gave them \nan excuse to assault her. Their actions gave me an excuse to come to her defense. \nOh, I know she didn’t need my help. I had seen her in Jerusalem, I knew full well \nthe sheer carnage she was capable of. Still, I moved to her aid just the same, and \nthrashed the three of them soundly. All the while, Kristin looked on with a mixture \nof gratitude and amusement. Afterward, Kristin took my advice and left with me, \nonly discovering after the fact that I was an old acquaintance. \nOnce again we talked of the past - \na situation made more awkward by her \ncontinued insistence on apologizing for killing me. For a change, we actually spent \ntime together. Really spent time together. We lived in comfort with each other for \nalmost 15 years. However, it seems such bliss as I knew at that time wasn’t meant to \nlast. I died again, taken by a gun, when a man desperate to drink the poorly made \nliquors of the time decided that my money was best for getting him inebriated. He \ndidn’t even try to rob me before he shot me. I still remember the stench coming from \nhis body as he pulled my wallet from by jacket pocket. I still remember the look on \nhis face when he found I carried a great deal of cash. He looked triumphant. If there \nwas guilt in his soul, it did not show. However, as I made my return, something about \nthe man’s attack comforted me. He had made no excuses for his action. He had not \ndressed up his greed in ill-fitting self-righteousness. I almost wish he had had a \nchance to spend the money he took from me. His honesty was refreshing. \nHow can I possibly know what he did with the money? That is easy enough to \nexplain. Kristin left me another note. It remained in my jacket pocket along with \n$500.00 for when I once again crawled back to the land of the living from the darkness \nof the afterlife. Once again she’d been forced to leave. Her note spoke of the Reaver \ncoming for her again. I didn’t know who the Reaver was, or why he pursued her so \nfanatically, but I knew I hated him. Twice he’d separated us. That was two times too \nmany. But beneath that dull hatred, I knew that I was fooling myself once again. I did \nnot hate this Reaver because he tormented the one I loved. I hated him because I was \njealous of him. In his enmity, he shared with Kristin something to which I was not \nprivy. She never spoke of why the Reaver made her his enemy, and that secret built \na wall between us. I wonder now if she even realized that it was there.. .. \n0 . .  \nI was without her for more years than I care to think about. By the time World \nWar I1 had come around, Kristin was back in Europe, dealing with other members \nof her clan and enmeshing herself in the world of vampiric politics again. To this day \nI do not understand those politics. I don’t really want to comprehend them. They are \nnot a part of my world. They could have been once, but Kristin saw that such was \nnot to be. That was another part of her existence she kept secret. \nWe met again last week. Kristin was in Washington D.C. for reasons I do not \nyet know and may never have a chance to understand. She looked me up in the \nphone book. After we exchanged pleasantries, we agreed to meet and talk. She had \nmissed me as surely as I had missed her. \nWe spent four days and nights in her hotel room. We talked, we ate -she left \na few times to handle her particular dietary needs, but beyond that she almost \n\n\nnever left my side - \nand we got to know each other again. The days went too \nslowly with her sleeping near me, close by and yet as distant as death. The nights \nwere never long enough. \nI cannot say for certain if I love Kristin. I no longer know if I am even capable \nof that emotion. When you measure your life in centuries, it is difficult to know if \nthe emotions you feel are real or if they are only habits and rote. When you see a \nbehavior pattern expressed again and again, you adopt it as your own. When your \nonly emotional contact comes from the unchanging repetition of patterns you \nlearned long ago, you embrace it or make your break altogether. Be it love, greed or \nthe need to make excuses, I have taken on the quality of the humans around me. \nAre they mine? Kristin would say so, I suppose. Her kind believes that the \nperson you are when you become immortal is the person you remain for all eternity. \nI do not believe that. Human beings are the ones who never change. Their lives are \ntoo short to give them the necessary perspective. Ones like Kristin and I have that \nperspective. And yet, even Kristin’s existence will end one night. Perhaps it will \ncome at the hands of this Reaver or the ravages of the sun or just the long, dreamless \nsleep of those who have no other reason to go on. I must not love her if I can look \non this realization so calmly. In time, I will say goodbye to Kristin for a final time, \nand my life will go on. I will have no choice but to proceed. \nI don’t think I do love Kristin. She is a kindred spirit, but that is all. Like the \nrest of humanity, I have fallen into a pattern. I have created the hollow moniker of \n“love” to express the simple fact that Kristin is so very different than all else I have \nexperienced. Like myself, she remains a pleasant constant in a world caught in a \nstagnant cycle. While she never changes, I can recognize that without the disap- \npointment I feel when I see that the humanity all around her has not changed as well. \nI do not expect her to change like I keep expecting humanity to change. \nI should leave her soon. Should I stay by her side, I would only fall deeper into \nthe pattern I have created. I would be no better than human should I let myself \nbelieve that I have found someone with whom I can pass the coming procession of \nyears. I know that I am becoming more like the changing tides of humanity the \nlonger I wade among them - \nset in my ways, unable to change - \nand staying with \nKristin only exacerbates that static mire. I need to get away from that which is \nfamiliar and comfortable. I need to proceed. I have to move on just as the world tries \nto move on. People do not change, but perhaps I can. I have the perspective to \nbecome something more. I will leave Kristin in the morning, once I have said a \nproper goodbye. \nOr perhaps the morning after that.. . I have missed her so, after all. \n\n\nTHF WOLVFS OE THF SFA \nV I K I N ~  \nVAMPIRES \nIN THE \nL o ~ g  \nN I ~ H T  \nby Jason Langlois \nKnown as the einherjar, the vampires of Scandinavian descent are part ofa \nfascinating and exciting culture. One of the authors of White Wolfs Wolves of the \nSea supplement for Vampire: The Dark Ages, Jason Langlois helps brmg that culture \nto visceral unhfe in hue-action phy with this article. \nODIN’S CHOSEN \nFiercely individualistic and proud, the einherJar lead unlives very different \nfrom their European counterparts. They do not believe in the myth of Caine, nor \ndo they believe themselves to be cursed. Nordic vampires come from a culture that \ntraditionally praises bravery and passion in battle, and they see their state as an \noutgrowth of that tradition. As far as they are concerned, the einherJur are warriors \nOdin himself has chosen to carry on the battles they led in life and to uphold their \nreligion against the spread of Christian (and Cainite) culture. Although the \nScandinavian culture had been all but crushed under the heel of Christianity’s \nexpansive influence by the “present” Long Night setting, the e h m  \nstill carry \nout the existence for which Odin has selected them. \nTHE \n~ O O D  \nGuys \nA chronicle centered on the Vikings has its appeal. If your group is small, \nplaying a ship’s crew or the population of a hall during the height of the Viking Age \n(around 900 CE) can be a great deal of fun. Each session should have boasts, grand \nadventures and dangerous raids. Such a chronicle could be a wonderful break from \nan intensely political and social game, as the Norse culture emphasizes victory \nthrough physical achievement. \nA large group may have trouble accommodating aNorse chronicle, unless the \nplayers split into different (possibly competing) halls. Doing so has some advan- \ntages, as it would allow the different halls to work against each other and to form \nalliances - \na built-in source for plots and stories. \nTHE \nBAD quys \nA good use for the Norse in an ongoing, pre-establishedhng Night chronicle \nis as antagonists. The Norse roamed to many points in Europe during the Dark \nAges, even traveling inland on horses. (The Norse were passable riders who \ndismounted to fight.) Their arrival could come as part of a raid, and thus lead to \nviolent confrontation. However, the Norse were also active traders. A merchant \nvisit could be areal opportunity for the Storyteller. She can have the traders spread \nrumors and bring exotic goods from far off lands, or offer to carry the characters off \non a long ocean voyage. The Norse were expert hagglers- there are methods other \nthan a raid to steal the shirt off someone’s back. after all. \n\n\nboasting. The jurl of each hall in the area attends, bringing an entourage -the bigger \nthe entourage, the more powerful the jurt. This competition can often spark bigger \narguments that can spiral into blood feuds of legendary levels. \nAs well as discussion, the thing is often the site of the holmgang and einvigi. The \nholmgang is a strict one-on-one duel with limited weapons and no active Discipline \nuse. The two involved parties stand within weapon range, and the accused takes \nthe first swing. The two trade blows until one of them collapses, surrenders or dies. \nThe winner is the last one standing. \nThe einvigi is a more traditional duel in which the opponents are allowed to \nuse armor and weapons of any type. The combatants fight it out in a circle of their \ncomrades, who usually cheer them on and shove them back into the fight if they \ntry to stray too far. Occasionally, there are rules - \nonly three shields, bare hands, \nno swords, etc. -but \notherwise this type of duel is truly unlimited. \nSOCIETY \nNorse society has a loose hierarchy, with plenty of possibility for advancement \n(and descent). There are effectively three levels to the society: Thralls were at the \nbottom, jmls were at the top, and the freemen were in between. A jurl is effectively \nany Norse leader powerful enough and rich enough to maintain a hall and table for \nhis followers. A powerful jurl, with many halls under his control, could even earn \nthe title of King. Thr& are the slaves or bondsmen who serve the jml. Einhqurjurls \ntook prisoners captured in raids for a herd, and these slaves did the drudge-work of \nthe Norse. If a freeman orjarl was to fall on hard times, he might voluntarily become \na thrall, to ensure himself of a meal and roof. \nFreemen make up the bulk of Norse society. Freemen are the warrior farmers \nand fishermen who follow the jurls and mix trading, raiding and harvesting in equal \nparts. Freemen sworn to a jurl become huskurls, the dedicated warriors of the hall. \nThese men and women are free from the responsibility to farm. Instead, they are \nexpected only to fight when their jart commands. This position is an honored one, \nand it is the goal of many young warriors to achieve it. \nNorse society treats women as different, but equal. While there are gender- \nroles, the Norse take a pragmatic view. Women hold the keys to the hall, and they \noften direct the work of the farm or enclave. Occasionally, a woman can even \nbecome a jurl, leading the warriors of her clan on raids and expeditions. Before \ntaking action, ajurl or warrior will consult with the women. \nOutside the normal status ofNorse society are the Outlaws (or vurgr) and the \nBerserks. Einheqnr Berserks are the warriors dedicated to drawing on the Beast to \nrage in battle and destroy their enemies. They eschew armor and work themselves \nto a high anger before a battle. This frenzy allows them to accomplish amazing feats, \nand many fear the Berserks - \nfriend and foe. The vurgr are individuals banished \nfrom Norse society (and in some case, even the clan) to fend for themselves in the \nwilds. Some umgr band together to form bandit groups to prey on merchants. \nOthers sign on with vampire crews to escape the dangers of the wilds. \n\n\nin single combat, or to swim a fjord in armor. At the next Althing, name the leader \nof the hall with the most fulfilled boasts King. \nCONVERSION \nA missionary group of European vampires arrives to convert the local area to \nfeudalism and Christianity. This influx typically threatens local einhgar enclaves, \nstealing away their followers and forcing them to become uurgr. Or, to flip matters, \nthe Norse vampires raid into Europe, threatening the holdings of the Church or \nnobles in aquest for plunder. The conflict here is between the old ways of the Norse \nand the new ways of Europe, and it is a good way to introduce the Norse into an \nexisting chronicle. \nRESCUE MISSION? \nAs the result of one of the Norse raids, perhaps an important character falls \ninto the hands of theeinhqar who hold her for ransom. The characters can attempt \nto chase down the raiders or to seek them out in their halls to attempt a rescue of \nthe kidnapped vampire. Or, perhaps the characters act as envoys sent to pay the \nransom and open communication with the Vikings. \nBRINC~INC~ \nIT TOC~ETHER \nIt is important, when running a Wolves of the Sea chronicle, to focus on the \ndifferences between the Norse and the Europeans. While the Norse have a much \nmore coarse attitude toward life (or unlife, for that matter), they are not without \nculture and society. The two groups clash over matters of faith, predestination and \ninteraction with the mortals on whom they prey. Neither side is inherently more \n“right” or justified in its actions than the other, and both types of vampires are \ndriven by compelling motivations. \nRULES \nSetting a game in the High North means taking into account a variety of local \nfactors. During the winter, the temperatures drop and the night gets progressively \nlonger. At the same time, the mortals will hide themselves behind the doors of their \nhalls. The summer will see days that seem to last forever and the migration of many \nNorse vampires to the south. \nA vampire begins each session down a Blood Trait, as normal, despite the \nextended length of the night. Keep in mind the fact that a night is longer during \nwinter and vampires will be capable of more activity. Hunting tests during the \nwinter requires twice as much work, since prey is harder to find. \nIn the summer, the night gets shorter and shorter. A possible way to reflect this \nproperty in the game would be to have a session represent more than one evening. \nDuring the summer, a vampire finds it more difficult to accomplish tasks since the \nsun rises sooner. \nAT SEA \nIf the game is to include sea travel, it is recommended that a room or area be \ndesignated as the “ship.” Storytellers can limit access to the ship, considering its \noverall size (a drakkar longship can carry up to 50 or so people; a knorr trade ship \n\n\nNEW ROADS \nThe vampires of the North have developed Paths of Morality that reflect \ntheir own culture and perceived nature as Odin’s Chosen. These Paths should \nonly be available to those vampires originally raised in a Norse culture. \nVIA FINHERJAR \nThe Road of the Slain is a difficult path to follow. It stresses the Norse virtues: \npersonal responsibility, individual initiative, courage and honor. Norse vampires \nwho wish to cling to the trappings of a dying culture and, in turn, honor the All- \nFather follow this Path. By adhering to his codes of behavior and developing an \niron-will, an einherJur can master the Beast. \nVampires on the Via Einherjar are no more “good” than any other vampire. \nWhile they are loyal to their friends, they treat everyone else with brutality, scorn \nand intolerance. They will beat, rob and challenge any who have not proven \nthemselves worthy of respect. For many, getting along with a follower of this path \ncan be difficult. \nThe Via Einherjar teaches the Virtues of Self-Control and Conviction. \nVIA ESIRC~ARD \nSome vampires of the High North fully believe that the gods have touched \nthem in some way. This belief requires the vampires to live in a world filled with \nspirits and portents, with rules laid down in the old lays and sagas. The vampires \nare subject to the weavings of the Noms, and they feel they must maintain the old \ntraditions and ways. \nA vampire who follows the Via hirgard embraces the power of the runes, \nbelieves in the inevitability of the fate, accepts the machinations of the gods and \nprepares himself for Ragnarok. The enemies of men and gods are his enemies. He \nwill seek out the trolls, giants, werewolves and others to give them battle.

However, when \nhandled capably and prepared for appropriately, Bunyip stand to offer a rich new \ndimension to Laws of the Wyld West games - \nthat of living wimesses to history. \nIn the modern day, the Bunyip are long gone, leaving nothing but a ghost race to \n\n\nhaunt their former persecutors. However, the Savage West offers players a unique \nopportunity to see the Bunyip as not just a footnate tn tk legends of the Garou, but \nInitial Willpower: 2 \ndvantage: Paths of th \nare even mor \nto the spirit world around \nace as the Savage West. \nend of the battle for \nsurvival.

This social style extends to \nOrganization: One major \nthose lands their own, and they take \nanimals and peoples \nwere the Bunyip’s protectorate. However, the incursion of European Garou has \nmade the Bunyip hard-pressed to retain their ancestral lands at all, let alone uphold \ntheir sacred charge as well. In the Savage West, the Bunyip tend to adopt other \noppressed minorities as their protectorate, hiding in the shadows until their aid is \n\n\nnecessary, then fading away into obscurity again when the need for them has \npassed. Many Bunyip consider the Pure Ones cousins in spirit, and they will aid \nthem when they can, although not to the extent that they are contributors to \ngenocide themselves. \nOutlook: The Bunyip are a breed at war, and whether they are found in their \nnative land or in the wilds of the Savage West, this reality is never far from their \nminds. Once largely solitary and at peace with the spirit kingdom around them, \nthey have beenforced into a martial existence. Most harbor a strong grudge against \nthe Garou who have disturbed their ancestral order. However, most Bunyip are still \nmuch more at home with their spiritual side than their inner Rage, which is \nreflected in their personal life as well as their military tactics. Most prefer learned \ndiscussion and quick, effective strikes to the raucous rhetoric and full-on slaughter \nof the Garou. Finally, the Bunyip are a dying race, and all of them know it. Whether \nthey choose to accept or deny this truth, to rage or retreat, the sadness of this truth \nstrikes to the bone of every living member. \nQuote: “You who have driven our spirits from the world and ancestors from \ntheir land, hear my words. Gaia is howling and only we hear her cries. If you do not \nstop this foolish purge, we will stop it for you. I assure you, it’s in your best interesrto \nreconsider.’’ \n\n\nTAKING \nTHE EINALTRAIL: USING \nBUNYIP \nIN \nTHE SAVAGE \nWEST \nAdding Bunyip characters presents more of a challenge than most Storytellers \nrealize when they first develop their chronicle concept. While breathing life into \nthe tragedy that faces members of this dying breed should be a theme in any story \ninvolving the Bunyip, there are a dozen other matters which deviate from the \nstandard Garou experience and require some extra consideration on the Storyteller’s \npart to really portray well. Here’s a rundown of the important plot considerations \nto bear in mind when using the elusive thylacine shapeshifters: \ns ow DID THEY 9e-r HERE? \nThis material assumes that most games are taking place in the Savage West, \nwith the Bunyip characters as the exotic minority. Handling games actually set in \nAustralia is covered later. Very, very few Bunyip have been born in the Savage \nWest, so start with the simple logistical questions. Even today, travel from \nAustralia to North America requires a large expenditure of time and effort - \nin \nthe days of the Savage West, the trip was much more grueling. How did the \ncharacter make the journey? Did anyone come with him or meet him when he \narrived? Does he still owe anyone for his passage, or is he in the country free and \nclear? \nA Moon Bridge is another possible means of transportation, perhaps, but the \nSavage West is enemy territory as far as the Bunyip are concerned, which makes \nit unlikely they’d be able to enter a caern openly without serious repercussions. The \nimportant thing is to make sure the passage is memorable in some way. No Bunyip \nsimply arrives in the Savage West. There should always be a story involved. \nOnce you’ve established the greater means of getting the character into the \nplot, work on why the Bunyip would choose to live in the area in which the \nchronicle is going to be set. Few things kill a good story faster than having a well- \ndetailed setting and absolutely no reason for the characters to remain there other \nthan “it’s where everyone starts out.” Bunyip in particular seldom get tied down to \na particular location unless some truly pressing reason exists for them to stay. Such \nis doubly true if a lot of Garou from tribes normally hostile to the Bunyip are found \nin the area. However, there are a few common reasons a Bunyip could find an area \nworth investing himself in. \nSensitive as they are, the turmoil in the Storm Umbra affects Bunyip deeply, \nand it could provide any number of story hooks. Their talent with the spirit world \ngoes a long way toward making even the most reluctant of European Garou \nrecognize their value in dealing with this growing threat. The Bunyip may also be \nsearching for something in the area, such as a fetish that’s beenstolen or a European \nupon whom they seek vengeance for some past misdeed. Quest motives work well, \nbecause they not only supply a means of explaining how and why a character \narrived in a location, but they also give that character freedom to travel if the \nchronicle decides to shift settings later on. \nOfcourse, simple friendship is perhaps the strongest motive of all. Chances are \ngood that a Bunyip character will at least befriend a local pack, if not join it \noutright, and few Bunyip would leave behind agroup of Garou who understand and \n\n\nsupport them, especially in the hostile lands of the Savage West. The trials, both \nwithin and without, that such characters would have to endure to preserve such a \nforeign bond would be monumental. The stories gained from such struggles have \nthe potential to be great indeed. \nCOMMON \nTHEMES \nAlthough many of them have been touched on here and there so far, it bears \nstressing and repeating that games involving the Bunyip should always contain at \nleast a measure of some essential themes. The first and most obvious of these \nthemes is the archetypal “stranger in a strange land” theme. If the Bunyip simply \nseem like Garou with pouches and funny accents, then there’s something deeply \nwrong. Every story a Bunyip appears in should add some element of the exotic to \nthe game: Normal Garou re-evaluate their beliefs based on the behavior of the \nstrange outsiders, and the Bunyip learn more about the Europeans and their bizarre \ncustoms. \nOf course, the Bunyip need not behave like she’s on her way to toss a bottle \noff the edge of the world every time she runs into ‘(civilization.” A n y  Bunyip \ncunning enough to survive in the Savage West quickly learns what’s expected by \nthose around her, even if she doesn’t agree with it. However, Bunyip have been \nraised within a very different paradigm than even most Pure One Garou, and this \ndifference should be reflected in ways both large and small throughout the game. \nThe second most prevalent theme is “hope versus desperation.” While the \nbattle of the Garou is growing more challenging all the time, the Bunyip have \nalready passed the edge of desperation and are fighting with all their might to hang \non to even the tiniest shreds of hope. Bunyip stories should always contain \nelements of this precarious state. All periods of action are that much more intense, \nedged with a sense of manic determination to make a difference. Even the lightest \nsocial interludes can never completely escape the shadow of loss that darkens the \nheart of the Bunyip. \nFinally, particularly inspired and far-seeing Storytellers can also use the \nBunyip to create a theme of dark prophecy, giving the Garou an ominous taste of \nthe future they’re creating with their own foolish pride. If the game involvesmostly \nBunyip characters (a truly special circumstance), the theme of bitter omens and \nthe dark harvest the Garou are sowing can simply be seen from the other side for \na change. The characters must struggle to make a difference in the time remaining \nand perhaps even pass on some kind of legacy before the void swallows them at last. \nHey, nobody said the Bunyip always have to be good guys! There are plenty \nof Bunyip out there who are more than willing to commit an atrocity or two to \navenge the deaths of their kin. As time passes and extinction approaches, many \nBunyip care little for their own lives, as long as they’re paid for in the blood of their \npersecutors. Storytellers who wish to use Bunyip as villains in their game add an \ninteresting antagonist to their repertoire. Unlike many typical villains in the \nSavage West, Bunyip don’t put much stock in toe-to-toe slugfests. They prefer to \nuse ambushes and guerrilla raids to harass and demoralize their enemy. What’s \nmore, since they work alone or in small groups, Bunyip are even more cautious than \nveteran Pure One scouts. Unless the Garou are especially vigilant or take \nextraordinary precautionary measures, most Bunyip raids are over and the damage \nU S I N 9  BUNYIP CHARACTERS A S  VILLAINS \n\n\ndone before the pack even has a chance to realize what’s going on. Storytellers are \nencouraged to play up the menace and cunning of the Bunyip as much as possible, \nand never let the characters feel entirely comfortable as long as the Bunyip are \nstalking them. \nOf course, to gain the full value of the Bunyip as antagonists, the tragic angle \nof the conflict must be preserved as well. No matter what one side did to provoke \nthe other, the ultimate result is Breed pitted against Breed in a world that needs all \nthe defenders it can find, with one whole Breed eventually driven to extinction in \nthe end. Characters who care to learn even a whit about their Bunyip foes may soon \nfiid themselves questioning their elders and perhaps even siding with the op- \npressed shapechangers in some fashion. Even if the Bunyip are presented simply as \nsavage killers who attack an innocent pack or settlement, the underlying bitter \nirony should never be allowed to escape the characters entirely. In the white-hat/ \nblack-hat politics of the Savage West, it’s easy to dismiss the villains as heartless, \nremorseless monsters and thereby justify nearly any action on the part of the \ncharacters as “heroic.” After all, when one’s traditional racial enemy is the \nmetaphysical embodiment of all the physical and spiritual decay in the universe, \nit’s pretty easy to tell who the good guys are. But when the enemies are others like \nthe characters themselves, with many of the same hopes and dreams, and from a \nsociety whose recent history has been nothing but bloodshed and betrayal at the \nhands of the character’s own society.. .. There lies the material for some truly \ngripping, emotionally charged stories. \nGUNSLIN~IN’ DOWN UNDER \nOf course, the game can always put the shoe on the other foot and be set \nsomewhere in Australia. No one said the Savage West was limited to the left side \nof the Mississippi, after all! However, there is simply too much material to reprint \nhere to provide even a rough sketch of playing Down Under. Players are thereby \nagain advised to consult Rage Across the World Volume 2, The Wild West \nCompanion and A World of Darkness: Second Edition for a look at Australia in \nthe World of Darkness, past and present. For the relevant real-world details of \nhistory and geography, any number of reputable scholarly texts exist for consulta- \ntion, although a comprehensive encyclopedia is often a good start. Just remember \nas you do your research that much of the power of a historical setting comes from \nthe way that setting is brought to life. Players will always forgive you if some details \nare off, provided you capture the right “feel” of the time period. But if it seems to \nthem as though your Aboriginal village or tiny Outback town could just as easily \nbe set somewhere else, you’re in trouble. \nThat said, stories run in the Australia of the Savage West tend to be \nconstructed along a few basic lines. In one, the players’ characters make up a \nBunyip pack (or packs), learning to work together and trying to thwart the \nambitions of the Wyrm and wicked Europeans alike. In another, the players are \nEuropean Garou exploring a new land and dealing with the strange shapeshifters \nthey encounter there, perhaps with a friendly Bunyip or two in the midst to act as \nambassadors and guides. In a third, the two cultures are incorporated more \ncompletely, with mixed Garou-Bunyip packs as the norm. The latter games tend \nto be built around themes like “everyone must band together to deal with some \n\n\ngreat big threat X” or “a tentative peace treaty Y has been signed and we’re trying \nto live it out.” However, these games are no less powerful if approached correctly. \nThe important thing to remember, no matter what the formulation may be, is that \nthe characters must not only have some reason to be where they are, but they also \nneed a compelling reason to work together (or not to!). Otherwise, the character \nrelationships will feel hollaw, and an essential dynamic of the chronicle will be \nlost. The key lies in balancing the stereotypes the characters all grew up with to the \nexperiences they’ve had with the culture they’re coming in contact with, and \nrealizing just what sort of person comes out of such a mix. \nIn essence, if the Bunyip feel like they’re fighting the newcomers just because \nthat’s what the Storyteller wants them to do, or the Europeans are just perpetrating \nthe cliche “great white hunters exploring the big dark continent” as they travel, \nsomething is deeply amiss. However, if they players feel the rage and frustration of \nthe Bunyip as they watch the Wyrm sink its claws into their land, or the first \ntentative but lasting ties of friendship forming with an understanding foreign \nGarou, the Storyteller is doing his job. If the Europeans wonder at the glory of pure \nGaia as they step foot onto the continent, or watch in horror as their brothers \ndishonor the name Garou with their selfish pride, then the essence of the theme \nhas been captured right in the beginning. \nEORMS \nHOMID \nTrait Adjustments: None. \nChange Description: All Bunyip are of Aboriginal stock, with dark eyes, hair \nand skin tone, although their hair turns light gray or even white as they age. Bunyip \ntend to be rather lean and wiry, but this descriptor doesn’t hold true for all of them. \nTrait Adjustments: While in this form, the Bunyip gains the bonus Traits: \nTenacious, Wiry. He is also afflicted with theNegative Traits: Clumsy and Tactless. \nChange Description: Bunyip do not like their intermediate forms, and they \nseldom spend much time in them. Their shape is hunched and awkward, making \nmovement more difficult. They are not as bestial as most Garou, but the weird \nnature of their appearance sets them apart just the same. \n~ L A B R O  \nCRINOS \nTrait Adjustments: The Bunyip gains the bonus Traits: Athletic, Rugged x2, \nTenacious and Wiry x2. However, the Bunyip also gains the Negative Traits: Bestial \nx2 and Clumsy. \nChange Description: Brutish and efficient, this form stands is as big as most \nGarou Crinos when fully upright, although Bunyip tend to move in a slightly \nhunched gait that makes them appear slightly smaller than they are. The Delirium \naffects most creatures who see the Bunyip in this form, although those affected are \nconsidered to be two steps higher on the Delirium chart due to the fact that Bunyip \nplayed no role in the Impergium. \nH I S ~ O  \nTrait Adjustments: The Bunyip gains the bonus Traits: Tireless x2 and Wiry \nx2. The Bunyip also gains the Negative Traits: Bestial x2 and Impatient. \n\n\nChange Description: The awkward form of the thylacine is exaggerated to \nmenacing size, although most Bunyip consider this form like their Glabro state and \nshun it whenever possible. What they gain in intimidation, they lose in mobility. \nTrait Adjustments: The Bunyip gains the bonus Traits: Nimble x2, Quick, \nRugged and Tenacious x2. He also incurs the Negative Trait: Bestial. \nChange Description: The Thylacinus form is indistinguishable from a regular \nthylacine - \nnot that most people in the Savage West will know what one is \nanyway. The character’s weight decreases, making him much more lean and wiry. \nTHYLACINUS \nBump GIETS \nBunyip may choose tribal Gifts just as Garou do, but finding teachers is \nbecoming more and more difficult as their numbers dwindle. Learning high-level \nBunyip Gifts in the Savage West would require a journey of epic proportions. \nStorytellers should take care to remind prospective Bunyip players that they will \nlikely have a tough time locating spirits or elders able to teach them any but the \nmost basic Gifts, and to plan their character’s development accordingly. \nBASIC \nC~IETS \nLeap of the Kangaroo - \nWhen his player expends a Physical Trait, the \nBunyip may double his jumping distances for the remainder of the scene/hour, \nwhichever lasts longer. The Garou later adopt this Gift and its name, perhaps out \nof respect for the Bunyip. \nDreamwalk - \nBunyip have a deep bond with the Umbra, unfathomable \neven to the most learned Uktena sages and Stargazer mystics, and this Gift is a \nrecognition of that fact. As long as the moon is visible in the sky, the Bunyip may \nreduce the level of the Gauntlet by two. This effect applies only to the Bunyip \nhimself, it does not count as an action on the Bunyip’s part, and it extends for a \nradius of no more than three steps. Also, Bunyip with this Gift never have a need \nfor a reflective surface to cross into the Umbra, visible moon or otherwise. They \nneed only concentrate on the passage, although stepping sideways still takes the \nnormal amount of time. \nPossum’s Feet - \nSee the Gift: Catfeet, in Laws of the Wild, p. 97. \nMeasuredStep-SeetheGift:SlrrfaceAttmement,inLawsoftheWild,p. 121. \nLonesome Voice of the Bunyip- As the last hope of their race, the Bunyip \nare aware that they are losing the battle for their homeland and their very identity. \nThis Gift stems from the deep loss that Bunyip himself feels when looking on the \nbrave struggles of his oumumbered children. Characters who learn this Gift can \nchannel some of the terrible sadness of their Totem into a booming, haunting cry, \nsending those around them fleeing from a combination of loneliness and terror. \nThe player must announce the use of this Gift (actual wailing is discouraged, unless \nyou happen to be proficient at expressing the bleak nihilism of encroaching \nextinction in a few syllables) and spend a Gnosis Trait. The players of all non- \nBunyip characters in the area must then defeat the character in a Simple Test \n(Social Traits compared on a tie) or lose a Willpower Trait and retreat for the \nremainder of the scene. \nINTERMEDIATE \nC~IPTS \n\n\nLandspeak -Tied as deeply as they are to their land of origin, the Bunyip \nare able to commune with the spirits easily to learn any number of things the Earth \nhas seen, simply by placing their ear against a natural feature and listening. Treat \nthis Gift the same as the Gift: Attumment in Laws of the Wild, p. 109, except that \nthe Bunyip has an effective range of dozens of miles, and he may learn about such \ngeneral patterns as coming weather, distant settlements and the like. The down \nside of this Gift is that, linked as it is to the Bunyip’s ancestral lands, this Gift will \nnot function in most foreign locales (such as the Savage West), although the \nStoryteller may make an exception in certain special circumstances. \nVice-Jaw - \nSee the Lupus Gift: Gnaw, in Laws of the Wild, p. 97. \nGuardians of the Dreamtime - \nBunyip with this bond to the spirit world \nneed never worry about any restrictions on their ability to step sideways. To them, \nboth worlds are as one, and crossing between the two is as easy as drawing breath. \nThey cannot fight in and out of the Umbra simultaneously (that is the province \nof the Gift: Ghost Dance, in Laws of the Wyld West, p. 285), but day or night, the \nGauntlet is always considered two lower for the Bunyip. They may even extend this \nadvantage to others in a 10-foot radius with a Static Mental Challenge (difficulty \nseven). If successful, they may reduce the Gauntlet by one for every Mental Trait \nthey spend. This reduction lasts until the end of the session/ night, whichever \ncomes first. \nBloody-Mindedness -Named after an Australian expression denoting an \nunswerving commitment to reaching a particular goal, this fearsome Gift allows a \nBunyip to pursue the target of his dedication with inhuman efficiency. When the \nplayer spends two Willpower Traits and declares his chosen objective (to a \nNarrator), the Bunyip does not need to eat or sleep until his quest is completed. He \nis also one Trait up on all Challenges related to his task, and he is completely \nimmune to all supernatural mind- or emotion-control attempts that try to sway him \nfrom his objective. Furthermore, if used in combat, the Bunyip may not attempt to \ndodge attacks from sources other than his chosen target (although he may still soak \nthem normally), but he is considered to have two extra Healthy health levels when \nsoaking such attacks. He also gains an additional attack against his sworn foe at the \nend of every turn. Note that the objective must be specific and attainable: “Destroy \nall European Garou” is not a permissible oath, but “Get revenge on the Silver Fang \nwho burned my tribe’s village” would be. If in doubt, consult a Narrator about \nwhich oaths are permissible. Only one sacred vow may be sworn at a time. \nBillabong Bridge - \nAncient uses of this Gift are what allowed the Bunyip \nto patrol their vast protectorate efficiently, and its use is still a means of rapid \ntransportation in an era when many of the Moon Bridges are being claimed by the \nEuropean Garou. Bunyip using this Gift may enter one body of water and emerge \nat another such body any distance away, simply by spending two Gnosis Traits and \nenvisioning their destination (therefore both locations must be fairly well-known \nto the Bunyip before this Gift will function). The only other restriction is that salt \nwater cannot be involved at either end of the trip, or the Gift will not activate. \nOnly the Gift user may make the journey. No other “passengers” may hitch a ride \nthis way. \nADVANCED \n51ms \n\n\nNEWTOTEMS \n08 RESPECT \nMu-ru-bul Tu-ru-dun, the Bunyip \nCost: 6 \nA mysterious totem for an enigmatic race, Bunyip appears as a furred, \nflippered, and scaled beast with a long beard or mane and burning eyes. Bunyip has \nnever been sighted outside of a body of water, and he favors deep streams and \nbillabongs. His deep bellow terrifies even the bravest ofwarriors, and his words bear \nthe eternal wisdom of the rivers. \nBunyip gives his children access to the Gifts: Measured Steb and Lonesome \nVoice ofthe Bunyip once per session. If the characters are non-Bunyip, the Breed will \nbe favorably disposed to them, but they will also expect them to take their side in \nany disputes with the Europeans, which can put the characters in a difficult \nposition very quickly. \nBan: Bunyip asks that his children honor him by drowning at least one enemy \nin fresh water every year. Due to his anger at their past ignorance and current blood \nthirst, Bunyip will not accept packs that contain European Garou. Only Silent \nStriders, Stargazers and Pure Ones have a chance of receiving his patronage, and \neven they must perform a great service for him before he will consider adopting \nthem. Bunyip may not be taken by any packs operating outside of Australia due to \nhis weakening condition. \nNgalyod the Rainbow Serpent \ncost: 7 \nThe chief totem of the Bunyip, although almost entirely unheard of by the \nEuropeans, Ngalyod appears as a tremendous rainbow-colored serpent. No one has \never been tall or high enough to see both Ngalyod’s head and his tail at once. Once \na joyous spirit, Ngalyod has grown moody and withdrawn of late, grieving for her \nvanishing children and searching for answers to the problems facing them. \nNgalyod gives each of her children a permanent Trait of Honor Renown, as \nwell as one permanent Gnosis Trait. Bunyip will be extremely impressed by any \nGarou who receive Ngalyod’s blessing, but they will expect them to act the part as \nwell. Ngalyod’s Children will never be attacked by Dreamtime spirits, although \nthese spirits can and will defend themselves if attacked. \nBan: Children of the Rainbow Serpent must become parents as soon as \npossible, since the Rainbow Serpent is a spirit of birth and creation. More forgiving \nthan her cousin Mu-ru-bul Tu-ru-dun, Ngalyod will accept Garou of all tribes, \nalthough Europeans will still be required to perform some extra service and \ndemonstrate exceptional dedication to defending Australia and its people before \nreceiving her blessing. Ngalyod’s power is weakening, however, and it cannot be \ntaken outside of Australia, just like her cousin. \n\n\nWRAITH: THF GRFAT WAR \nJ \nby Bruce Baugh \nThis article is part one of a two-part feature.

Charon founded \nthe first Necropolis (in London) to better protect and manage the ever-growing \nvolume of souls under his command. The Sea of Shadows, which returned to its \ndark calm after the First and Second Great Maelstroms, never became still again. \nEven today, it’s known as the Tempest. \nThis time, things are worse. \nThe great powers of Europe go to war in 1914. Among the young men who \nmarch off to what they thought would be glorious victory, and among the men and \nwomen of every age who cheer them on, are many who later claim they’d never \nfavored the martial cause. They lie to themselves and others. In the decades before \n1914, intellectuals, mid-level managers and peasants alike tell each other how war \nwould invigorate their national spirit and bring glory to the warriors. They don’t \npay attention to mounting evidence - \nfrom the American Civil War, from the \nCrimean War, from the Boer War - \nthat modem technology makes all that \nirrelevant. So the young men march off to die by the millions. \nThe war settles almost nothing in a military or diplomatic sense, except that treaty \nterms guarantee another war will follow in the next generation. The young men come \nhome disillusioned, searching for enemies to blame. Their chosen targets include \ncapitalism, liberal democracy, communism, Jewry and anyone else who might express \nan opinion about what went wrong. In the aftermath of the war, plague follows, with \nlethal influenza striking some countries even harder than the war. Revolutions rage all \nacross Eastern Europe, while the regimes ofWestem Europe grope for some idea of what \nto do next. After a nervously exuberant decade, global depression sets in. \nIt is not the best of times for the living. The dead soon envy them. \nThe FourthGreat Maelstrom breaks out on July 1,1916. In the Skinlands, the \nBattle of the Somme includes the highest casualty rates yet. The press of violent \ndeath and surrounding agony echoes across the Shroud, pouring dark passions into \nevery layer of the afterlife. In the depths of the Labyrinth, spiritual tides crest and \nbegin to ebb. The turning tide forces Spectres out of the Labyrinth and into the \nupper reaches of the Underworld. As the weight of pain inflames the Tempest, \ntriggering storm clouds that rise into the Shadowlands, torrents of Spectres shoot \nupward in search of some new home until the Labyrinthine tides allow them to \nreturn. On July lst, the Shadowlands of eastern France crack open to let the \nseething mass of evil memories and Shadow-eaten souls pour forth. Similar \neruptions begin on battlefields on every front during the next few hours. Within \ndays, the leading edge of the storm sweeps around the globe. \nThe Great Maelstrom rages for more than a decade. As the ’20s wear on, it \ngradually tapers off, and something like peace returns. \nThe storm isn’t the only problem wraiths face. Charon isolates himself in the \nOnyx Tower and does not answer calls to lead his people. In 1918, the Smiling Lord \ndeclares himself the new emperor of the dead: The crisis calls for leadership, and thanks \nto war deaths, he controls more wraiths than any of his rival Deathlords. His followers \nrefer to themselves as Imperialists; their enemies call them Insurrectionists. The \nSkeletalbrd, whoseesCharonastheFirst Horsemanofthe Apocalypse, leadstheloyal \nresistance. Influenza and other diseases swell the rank of the Skeletal Legion. \n\n\nTHE POWERS \nTHAT \nBE \nFor a full decade, the Stygian Empire functions erratically, without consis- \ntency. Between the corporeal challenge of the storm and the social challenge of the \nInsurrection, most Necropoli must rely on their own resources. Independent \ngovernments spring up as “free cities,” city-states, regional alliances and the like. \nSome cities cater to the Imperialist or Loyalist factions in exchange for the freedom \nto run their own affairs. In St. Petersburg, for instance, glib-sounding Anacreons \nkeep inspectors appeased and breed monsters behind the scenes. \nThe Legions are the basic building blocks ofwraithly society. They Reap souls and \ninstruct the new Restless Dead in the fundamentals of their condition. Most wraiths \naren’t soldiers, but the Legions provide a sense of identity for many wraiths nonetheless. \nThe vast majority of wraiths follow the lead set by the higher-ups in their respective \nLegions, not so much out ofdeep conviction as because they take it for granted and have \nno real alternatives. Common attitudes include “my bosses seem to know what they’re \ndoing, and I’m not impressed by the other guys” and “I owe these people for helping me \nsurvive, so I’ll back them even if I don’t really understand what’s going on.” \nTHE \nLE~IONS \nThe Skeletal Legion: Victims of Pestilence \nThe Skeletal Legion leads the Loyalist faction. The Skeletal Lord is utterly insane. \nHe believes himself to be one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse, and he fights to \nprotect the realm of Charon, whom he regards as Death incarnate. The Skeletal Lord’s \nmadness doesn’t prevent him from running one of the most efficient Legions. Disease \nstrikes all ages and social classes, and the Skeletal Lord staffs his offices with the finest \nadministrators he can find. Skeletal Legionnaires tend to know a lot more about what \nassets they have at any given time than their counterparts in other Legions. In 1918, \nwhen the Smiling Lord revolts, the Skeletal Legion badly lags behind the Gnm in \nmanpower. However, the Spanish Flu and various other post-war diseases close the gap. \nIt takes most of a decade for the Skeletal Legion to fully assimilate and train its new \nrecruits, so the Skeletal Legion fights an uphill battle throughout the ’2Os, holding its \ngains but expanding much more slowly than its commanders would like. \nThe Iron Legion: Victims of Old Age \nLike pestilence, old age strikes people at every level of society. The Iron \nLegion’s recruits all enter the Shadowlands with the benefits (and disadvantages) \nof a full life’s experience. Iron Legion administrators get surprised by less, since they \nreally have seen it before. The Legion’s diplomats and spies know tricks that even \ncenturies in the Shadowlands can’t match. Mortals live more intensely than \nwraiths do, and they pack a lot of insight into a century. Unfortunately, Iron \nLegionnaires often rely too much on mortal insights and not enough on wraithly \nones: When the Insurrection begins, many Iron Legion officers and spies fall to \nGrim Legion jailers. The Legion spends the rest of the decade fighting to survive \nas well as rebuild. Fortunately, while wars and disease both come and go, old age \nremains, and the Iron Legion grows again just as it has after past tragedies. Very few \nIron Legionnaires defy their superiors to join the Insurrection. They include many \nof the wartime leaders that angry young Grim Legionnaires would love to punish. \nThe Grim Legion: Victims of Violence \nThe population of the Grim Legion rises and falls in big steps. Wars, genocides \nand the like kill many people in short order. In more peaceful times, only murders \n\n\nsend more people to join the Grim ranks. Senior Grim leaders must assimilate a \ngreat many wraiths quickly and then try to conserve their forces until the next era \nof suffering, all the while keeping their charges from the over-zealous pursuit of \nvengeance. At the moment of Insurrection, the Grim Legion vastly outnumbers \nany of its rivals; the Smiling Lord plans a rapid enough victory not to worry about \nattrition. Just like the plans of European generals before 1914, it doesn’t quite work \nthat way. With the growing ranks of Skeletal soldiers and the Emerald Legion’s \ndefection, in the end sheer numbers determine the Smiling Lord’s failure. \nThe Emerald Legion: Victims of Happenstance \nSometimes life deals cruel and capricious blows. Entering the Shadowlands \nunexpectedly, without any of the preparation that war or pestilence or old age might \nprovide, the members of the Emerald Legion traditionally compensate with a rigorous \nconservatism. The Emerald Lord usually plays within the system for all the advantage \nhe can gather. He acted out of character when backing the Smiling Lord, and suffered \nfor it when he returned to form and defected to the Loyalist cause halfway through the \nInsurrection. The other Deathlords willingly enough put his forces to use, but they \nnever trusted him, and they systematically denied him his traditional share of wraiths \nwith contestable causes of death. The irregular nature of happenstance means that the \nLegion always suffers from deficiencies in manpower and equipment - \nit’s hard to do \nstrategic planning when chance defines your existence. \nThe Penitent Legion: Victims of Madness \nThe Penitent Legion, like the Grim, grows and contracts unpredictably. The \nLaughing Lady ran her Legion ruthlessly, Reaping every soul she could claim and \nsending troublemakers to the forges, all with a minimum of argument tolerated. \nThe War to End All Wars swells the Legion’s ranks, with soldier-suicides (many \nof whom didn’t consciously realize they were suicidal), shell-shock victims and the \nlike. Despite relatively close relations, the Smiling Lord decided he couldn’t trust \nthe Laughing Lady and deposed her at the start of the Insurrection, setting up a new \none loyal to him. For the duration, rival Laughing Ladies compete for control of the \nLegion’s resources; neither one matters to the battle except as a propaganda figure. \nAt Insurrection’s end, the puppet goes to the forges and the original Laughing Lady \nreturns to power, dedicating herself to a purge that leaves the Legion so depopu- \nlated as to be barely functional for decades to come. \nThe Legion of Fate: T h e  Chosen \nThe ranks of the Legion of Fate are somehow always just large enough. Nothing \nunites the Fated except the mark of fate itself: They would otherwise spread all \nthrough the other Legions because they can die any way people do. The Ladies of Fate \noversee the most diversified gathering of ghosts and somehow manage to maintain \na n  effective organization to get the right people to the spots Fate decrees appropriate \nat the right time. Just as the Fated take no formal part in Necropolis politics, so they \ntake no part in the Insurrection. They concentrate on fighting the storm and Spectres \nso that whoever emerges on top still has an empire to rule. \nThe Silent Legion: Victims of Despair \nDespair stalks mortal society during and after the war. Soldiers and civilians \nlose hope and surrender to death. The Silent Legion makes an unusually coordi- \nnated effort to find and recruit its souls, since so many would otherwise keep falling \ninto Oblivion. The Quiet Lord cares more about the well-being of his charges than \nmost of the other Deathlords. Silent Legionnaires who survive their first weeks in \n\n\nthe Underworld go on to last longer, on average, than the members of any other \nLegion, but the early failure rate is hellishly high. The Quiet Lord recently \ninstituted the Steel Martyrs order for wraiths willing to give themselves to the \nforges rather than to Oblivion, which at least addresses resource shortages and does \nless harm to Stygia’s ability to survive. Like the Legion of Fate, the Silent Legion \nplays little part in the Insurrection. Silent Legionnaires often serve as acting \nAnacreons, trusted by both sides, as well as fighting the storm. \nThe Legion of Paupers: Victims of Mystery \nThe only Legion smaller than the Paupers is the Legion of Fate, yet the Beggar \nLord compensates for his thin ranks with overwhelming ambition. He’s one of the \nmost thorough deal-makers and conspirators in the Dark Kingdom of Iron. Popular \nopinion portrays the Paupers as a Legion of the clueless. Its members compensate \nmuch as their Lord does, through diligent effort to win power and influence. Little \nunites them except the shared isolation of an unknown or incomprehensible death. \nThis link could be a liability, but the Beggar Lord tries to capitalize on the diversity \nin his ranks. Outsiders who stereotype the Legion too far end up embarrassed (or \nworse) when they find themselves outmaneuvered in complex social ploys. During \nthe Insurrection, the Legion of Paupers remains neutral, collecting payments from \nboth sides to stay out of the conflict and building its own power base all the while. \nWhen the usual foundations of Stygian society prove unreliable, other groups \nmove in to prop up the society and keep it running. In some Necropoli, the Guilds \nremain largely suppressed and out of sight, but in many parts of the empire they \nprovide more practical governance than the Hierarchy. \nStygians often divide the Guilds into four categories. The Great Guilds matter as \nmuch to the survival ofthe empire as any Legion, providing essential services. No leader \nor would-be leader with a clue risks tampering with the Artificers, Masquers, Pardoners \nor Usurers. A faction cut off by one or more of the Great Guilds must fall, and sooner \nrather than later. The Working Guilds provide useful services and operate almost in \npublic behind a variety of flimsy guises that satisfy the letter of the law. A few Working \nGuildwraiths become prominent players in the games of Stygian politics. Most try, l i e  \nthe wraiths around them, mostly to stay out of the way. The Chanteurs, Harbingers, \nOracles and Sandmen all confront the same mix of opportunity and risk facing all \nwraiths during the Great War. The Criminal Guilds provide services that warrant \ninstant slavery and forging ... services often so useful that prominent Criminal \nGuildwraiths enjoy signhcant social status, and nobody rudely broaches the question \nof just how those wraiths acquired their power and influence. The war and storm matter \nless to the Criminal Guilds, forming opportunity and backdrop rather than all- \nconsuming goals for the Haunters, Monitors, Proctors, Puppeteers and Spooks. Fmlly, \nthe Forbidden Guilds operate altogether outside the sanction of Stygian society, and the \nInsurrection doesn’t change much for the Alchemists, Mnemoi or Solicitors. \nThe Great Guilds \nLoyalists and Imperialists alike court the Great Guilds, and try to avoid \ndrawing the Guilds’ anger. \nAn internal civil war rages throughout the Great War within the Artificers. \nNhudri’s detachment and the Guild’s public neutrality mask a vicious struggle to \ntie the Guild’s fortunes to the faction deemed most likely to win the war. Loyalist \n\n\nforces prevail within the Guild just as the Smiling Lord surrenders, and a quiet but \nthorough purge follows as peace returns. \nThe Masquers engage in a similar (and similarly concealed) dispute, though \nfavoring assassination rather than outright fights. The Masquers’ rigorous adher- \nence to a code of ethics in business allows them to deal with both sides, and keeps \neither side from feeling at a disadvantage because of Guild discrimination. \nThe Usurers work together and grow wealthy, charging exorbitant rates for \ntheir services, running just shy of angering Loyalists or Imperialists enough to \nprovoke reprisals. After the Rebellion, charges of profiteering force the Guild back \nThe Working Guilds \nThe Working Guilds play no major part as Guilds in the war, although some \nprominent individuals try to influence the course of events. \nThe Chanteurs flourish during the storm as they did during past Great \nMaelstroms - \ndesperate wraiths seek inspiration and distraction. Wraiths without \nKeening refer with a mixture of gratitude and contempt to “Johnny Songbirds,” \nwraiths who never aspired to public performance before the crisis and now move \nto the stage, doing what they can to provide relief. Some Chanteurs also act as \ndiplomats and mediators. \nThe Harbingers could become a Great Guild if their leaders wanted to try. \nThroughout the storm, Argos proves essential to keeping scattered Necropoli in \ntouch with each other. Harbingers act as scouts, guides and messengers for all \nelements of Stygian society. \nThe Oracles continue to ply their trade as usual, far more concerned about the \nstorm than the war. Factional fighting takes place in the Guild’s upper reaches, \nwith Delphic support for the Skeleton Legion pitted against Gambler sympathy for \nthe Grim Legion. None of it amounts to very much, in the end, apart from \nopportunities for promotion as internal purges create vacancies. \nThe Sandmen make dramatic social progress during the Great War, rehabili- \ntating themselves with a new image as civic supporters relieving the stresses of \nMaelstrom existence. Well-publicized heroic masters and mistresses of Phantasm \ndo battle with the Shadow-eaten to protect mortal dreams, and earn the gratitude \nof the wraiths Fettered to living souls. \nThe Criminal Guilds \nThe Criminal Guilds all profit from the combination of desperation and \nisolation. Wraiths who badly need a service can and do pay handsomely for it, and \nwraiths who want services the Hierarchy frowns on get more opportunities to seek \na supplier when the chain of command rusts and breaks apart. \nThe Haunters unite to a degree that surprises them all, fighting the Shadow- \neaten for the soul of the Underworld. In the century before the Fourth Great \nMaelstrom, the Monitors ruled the criminal underground of most Necropoli. \nIsolation leaves them shattered and ineffective against the far more ruthless \nSpooks, and the Monitors scatter. \nThe Proctors support the Loyalist cause, gambling that no single Legion can \nprevail against the rest, and many expert Embody users earn pardons for their \nservice in identifying and destroying Insurrectionist Fetters. \n\n\nThe Puppeteers, the most persecuted Guild not actually forbidden like the \nSolicitors and Mnemoi, exploit their long-standing ties to the Grim Legion to earn \na much more free hand. Risen proliferate; inadequately trained souls quickly fall \nto their Shadows as careless manipulators of the living. The Puppeteers generally \naim to ride out the storm years in comfort, across the Shroud. When the \nInsurrection fails, charges of Puppetry send a sizable fraction of the Guild’s \nmembers to the forges. \nThe Spooks prosper tremendously. Their ttaditional rivals weakened or \ndistracted and their clients desperate in the face of war and storm, Guildwraiths \nreap huge profits. For many small Necropoli, the Spooks become a de facto \ngovernment, earning good will that sustains them through post-Great War \ntribulations. Spooks don’t just run rackets, either; Outrage-powered mercenary \nunits fight on all sides of the various conflicts. \nThe Forbidden Guilds \nThe Forbidden Guilds also thrive. The powers that be have more important \nthings to do than stamp out suspected rogues when Spectres howl at every gate and \nthe guards fight each other. So the banned Guilds work their way back into the \nlight quietly, making preparations so that when suppression returns (as it always \ndoes) the hunted Guildwraiths have more options for concealment. \nThe Alchemists set up a variety of front groups to protect the Guild and then \nget rich. Wraiths everywhere want the strongest Fetters they can get (and their \nenemies to have the weakest). Every Alchemist willing to admit to knowing Flux \ngets all the work she wants, and then some. The Guilds that traditionally oppose \nthe Alchemists - \nthe Artificers, Monitors and Spooks - \ndeal with their own \nchallenges. That is, until the Insurrection ends and persecution resumes. \nNobody sees the Mnemoi. Nobody thinks about them. They go about their \nown business. Their time doesn’t come for another seventy years. See Ends of \nEmpire for what happens when they emerge at last. \nThe Solicitors operate in secret, as always. They recruit unwitting pawns for \ntheir internal political disputes and to spread influence throughout the Hierarchy. \nThe Great Maelstrom strands wraiths who’d normally go to the Dark King- \ndom of Ivory or to Swar. In life they were soldiers in the armies of colonial powers. \nNow they’re stuck, isolated for the duration of the storm. Part two of this article will \npresent information on creating and playing characters from outside Stygia. In \naddition, some soldiers of the Jade Empire, taken prisoner in conflicts on Stygia’s \neastern frontier, struggle for survival as the Insurrection distracts their captors. \n0 UTS I D F RS \nAETERLIEF \nDURINC~ \nWARTIME \nThe Great Maelstrom and the Insurrection combine to shatter the empire, at \nleast for a while. What conditions prevail in the Necropolis characters inhabit \ndepends on who’s in charge. \nLOYALIST \nC~OVFRNMFNT \nIn many Necropoli, the traditional order prevails. Anacreons for the Skeletal, \nIron, Penitent, Silent and Pauper Legions operate as agents of the Hierarchy. The \nunpredictable loss of communications means that they exercise more authority on \nthe spot than usual, but their fundamental position doesn’t change. Reaper squads \n\n\ncirculate regularly, in an effort to keep new wraiths away from not only random \nSpectral predators, but also from dissidents and (above all) the Grim Legion. \nWraiths who’d normally join the Grim Legion end up assigned to one of the others, \nall of which have special “substitute Grim” sections. \nMost Loyalist Necropolioperate under strictmilitaryrule. Everyonenot explicitly \nand enthusiastically supportive of the regime faces investigation and punishment. \nLuxuries and entertainment come only as the authorities deem appropriate. \nIMPERIAL \nC~OVERNMENT \nThe Grim Legion rules alone (particularly after the Emerald Lord defects), or \n- \nwith incidental support from lackeys in the various other Legions. Otherwise, cities \nunder the Smiling Lord’s jurisdiction differ little from their Loyalist counterparts. \nNobody can keep exhaustive records in the midst of the storm’s chaos. \nPowerful wraiths can and do band together, overthrow resisting Anacreons and \nCenturions and institute a new government of their own. In cities with strong \nreligious traditions, Heretic movements flourish, basing their regimes on devotion \nto holy relics or sacred teachings. Where mortal revolution stirs the Shroud, \npolitically motivated Renegades often come to the foreground. Most such move- \nments preserve the division of wraiths by deathmark while abolishing the standard \nmilitary hierarchy. A chronicle in an independent city can use, literally, just about \nany organizational scheme: recreation of ancient Athens or Sparta, 19th century \nUtopian schemes, arcane occult symbolism as the basis of the bureaucracy, efforts \nto recreate the environments of pulp fiction (very popular in the 1920s) and so on. \nTHE CITY AND THE C~HOSTS \nINDEPENDENT \nC~OVERNMENT \nAs part two of this article will make clear, the storm isdangerour. Travel stnks \nto a fraction of its normal volume. The Necropolis where play begins must be, by \nnecessity, where the vast majority of play takes place. Consider your options \ncarefully. Loyalist Necropoli most resemble the Shadowlands in other times. The \nImperial approach offers a fresh spin on similar themes. Independent government \ncovers everything else. Be sure to consider how much organization you want, and \nchoose enough to satisfy players and not enough to annoy them. \nC HARACTF R C RFATI o N \nThe Great War era emphasizes some aspects of wraithly society more than \nothers, and some constant factors like Shadow and Arcanoi manifest in ways \nappropriate to the period. \nThis article covers creating characters in the mainstream of Stygian society \nafter the War to End All Wars. They belong to one or another of the Legions - \nalthough they may not serve actively in any sense - \nand they study the publicly \navailable Arcanoi. Wraith: Great War includes options not covered here, \nincluding the forbidden Arcanoi and Mortwights as player-characters. Look for \nthose in an upcoming article. \nSTEP ONE: CHARACTER \nCONCEPT \nWho were you in life, and how did you die? The Guilds play only minor roles \nin the Great War. Wraiths gather because of shared causes of death; the Legions \n\n\nprovide the building blocks of Stygian society. The war in the empire leads all \nLegions to scour the Shadowlands for new souls. When you die, or shortly \nthereafter, someone comes to claim you, offering you shelter from the storm and \ninstruction in your new condition. Guild training, if it happens at all, only comes \nlater, and Legion membership defines your place in the Underworld. \nDEATH \nAND THE L E ~ I O N S  \nSee the descriptions of the Legions, and think about how your character died. \nUnlike the late 20th century, the Great War era includes many causes of mass \ndeath - \nyour character probably enters the Shadowlands with many peers. War \nand revolution create wraiths by the dozens (or hundreds, or even thousands) in \nevery battle. When diseases sweep through a country, they swell the wraithly \npopulation of a Necropolis as well. It’s easy for Great War wraiths to begin with a \nshared death, and that fact is a handy hook for a chronicle. \nEven if characters go on to join independent movements, Loyalist or Impe- \nrialist Reapers almost certainly brought them out of the Caul and into wraithly \nsociety. Independent Necropoli seldom have the organization to mount regular \nReaping patrols. So characters have the opportunity to get some information \n(albeit biased) right at the outset. Think about who your character was in life. You \nhave to do so anyway to develop Passions and Fetters, but it also matters for how \nyour character deals with the new realities of the Underworld. Soldiers who hate \nthe war and wish to see all empires fall feel very differently about the Insurrection \nthan loyal citizens who honestly sought to promote their nation’s victory, for \ninstance. It’s not just biographical facts that matter, but attitude. \nThe decade after the War to End All Wars is one of revolutionary change. \nEinstein’s discoveries in physics, along with quantum mechanics, open up a whole \nnew way of looking at the natural world. The Russian Revolution proves that no \nempire can withstand change forever. The war itself shows the moral bankruptcy \nof old imperial ideas, and in exhausting Europe, lays the groundwork for America \nto emerge as the new world power. Freud’s ideas drastically alter how people think \nof their own souls. Many people stay true to older principles, of course, but in the \nface of multiple revolutions, remaining traditional is itself a conscious choice, too. \nIt’s an era of self-examination as well as critique of the world at large. \nI \n,I \nI \nL \n~ I \nARCHETYPES \n1 \nIn addition to the Natures and Demeanors common to the late 20th century, \nprovided in Oblivion, the psychological and spiritual conditions of the Great War \nera give rise to other common archetypes. \nAuCourant.Youmustbecurrent. Ifit’sold,you’renot interested.Youdon’t \nrisk yourself in particularly dangerous experimentation.. . but you do watch the \nrisk-takers carefully and help blaze fashions in their wake. \ncommando. You’re a warrior - \nnot a faceless grunt among many, but one \nprepared to gather up arms and loyal comrades to take the battle directly to the enemy. \nYou trust hierarchies only insofar as they support your ability to fight as you feel called to. \nCurmudgeon. Life was bad. Death is worse. There’s a cloud for every silver \nlining. You expect the worst and get it. You often try to warn others of the trouble \nthey don’t see coming, but nobody ever pays proper attention to you. \n‘1 \n,I \n\n\nIdealist. You have a cause, maybe the vision that drove you in life, maybe \none that’s captured you since then. You dream of the world as it might be, and you \nwork to make it so. You try to inspire others to work with you. \nManipulator. In a land where nothing’s solid but souls, you use the people \naround you as your tools. You’re fascinated by what makes people tick, not for \nabstract curiosity but to make them tick the way you want. You exist for the \nsatisfaction of being at the center of a society doing your bidding. \nPatrician. You were born to rule, and death doesn’t change that. You bring \ngrace and wisdom to wraithly society. Your role is to encourage proper subordination \namong those who must defer and to lead them intelligently in this hour of need. \nPragmatist. Reality is what you can get away with. Sure, grand dreams are \nwell and good, but you need to get things done. You proceed step by step, and you’ll \ndo what seems necessary to keep yourself safe and secure. Ideals are for times the \nsky doesn’t spit blood. \nReformer. Injustice fills the Underworld, and it must change. You know \nthat revolution gets you nowhere. You work patiently, making incremental \nchanges, building consensus to make this place a better, more moral realm. It may \ntake forever, but then you’ve got forever, and virtue can outlast vice. \nRumonnager.Someonealwayscarriesthenewsothersdon’twant~o~.That’s \nyou. You listen carefilly and take what you hear to the listeners who most need to hear it. \nYou’re the one people turn to for dormation, and you make them pay the right price. \nSTEP Two: ATTRIBUTES \nSTEP THREE: \nADVANTAC~ES \nAssign Attributes as in Oblivion. \nSee “The Arcanoi” for Great War-era Arcanoi. \nPASSIONS \nAND EETTERS \nAssign these as in Oblivion. Keep in mind that your wraith may begin far away \nfrom her Fetters, and that she can’t cross the oceans to them after a Harrowing \nwhile the Maelstrom winds blow. Don’t create a character with no Fetters on the \nside of the Atlantic where play begins, or at least be prepared to make a new \ncharacter after the first Harrowing if you do. \nAt least one Passion should relate to the character’s cause ofdeath. It provides \nhooks, whether the character seeks vengeance, redress or just a chance to finish \nwhatever it is death cut short. In most chronicles, characters will naturally develop \ninterests in and attachments to wraithly society; at the outset, make sure that your \ncharacter also has reasons to care about the mortal world. \nSTEP EOUR: SHADOW \nCREATION \nFollow the procedure shown in Oblivion. Use the historical Shadow Arche- \ntypes and Thornsgiven here in addition to the ones inoblivion. Note that the cost \nof some Thorns changes because of the conditions of the Great Maelstrom. \nSHADOW \nARCHETYPES \nThe Anarchist. Power corrupts. Everything wrong with the world startsbecause \nsomeone has too much power over others. The Anarchist seeks to topple every \nstructure into Oblivion. Whatever it is that brings order brings power, and it must go. \n\n\nThe Deserter. All institutions fail. You’ve got to look out for yourself, \nbecause nobody else does, and you’ve got to know when to flee the scene before it \nall falls apart. The Deserter looks for reasons to justify betraying friends and \nassociates and then for the best way to leave them in the lurch. \nThe Id. Only passions untrammeled by reason or an awareness of the future \nmatter. The Id seeks to indulge whatever seems likely to bring satisfaction to the \nwraith right now, and never mind what may come next. \nThe Maggot. Everything valuable the world ever held is dead, and all that \nremains is picking through its corpse. The Maggot glories in exposing the doom of \nall hopes and extracting shards of value from the failure of everyone else’s schemes. \nThe Maggot is the ultimate scavenger, wearing down the world until all props, \nsources of security, comfort and shelters disappear. \nThe Merchant. The value of a thing is what that thing will bring. The \nMerchant drives bargains, knowing that nothing need remain with its current \nowner if the price is right. The Merchant makes bargains that leave everyone a bit \nworse off than before, feeding Oblivion through dissatisfaction and covetousness. \nThe Nurse. The world hurts, and nothing matters more than soothing pain. \nThe Nurse brings peace through relief from the sources of pain, healing for old \nwounds and finally the ultimate release that comes from isolation. The Nurse \nguides its Psyche into quiet realms, away from Passions. \nThe Officer. Wraiths, like mortals, are weak and in need of direction. The \nOfficer takes charge, getting the Underworld in systematic order, so that in due \ntime it can all march off into Oblivion in perfect harmony. In the meantime, the \nOfficer punishes all who resist. \nThe Opium-Eater. Life is pain. So is death. Nothing matters but enjoyment \n-not the foul, gross pleasures the Id seeks, but the refined intellectual purity that \ncomes from a mind untroubled and yet at liberty to engage with the world. The \nOpium-Eater seeks something that makes the Psyche detached. \nThe Patriot. What matters is the nation. The Patriot carries into death the \nconviction that its living allegiance remains paramount. It will betray any other \ngroup if the betrayal might advance the nation (or weaken the nation’s enemies) \nand do whatever seems likely to help make the nation strong. \nThe Peasant. Life was simple, and death can be, too. The Peasant seeks \nsome simple routine and some strong leader to give the orders. The Peasant \npunishes the Psyche for ambitions that would stir routine, preparing the character \nfor Oblivion by establishing a pattern that requires less and less passion until only \nthe habit remains. \nThe Revolutionary. The world reeks of tyranny, but it can change if people \nact. The Revolutionary picks its target and seeks to overthrow the source of \ntyranny. Unlike the Anarchist, however, the Revolutionary also seeks to build up \na utopian alternative. The Revolutionary seeks a new order, not disorder. \nThe Superego. The Id aims for the moment’s pleasure; the Superego \nsubordinates all current pleasures to ultimate goals. The Superego punishes the \nPsyche for seeking present gratification, and rewards self-denial in the name of \nlong-term Passions. As long as it means being unhappy or uncomfortable now for \nthe sake of some satisfaction that may never come, it suits the Superego. \n\n\nTHORNS \nShadowed Sense: 1 Trait. The Shadow can distort one aspect of the local \nenvironment. This costs two Angst Traits for a Shadowlands effect or three Traits \nto include Skinlands manifestation. (Reduce the Angst costs by one Trait while \nthe wraith is in Catharsis.) The Shadow specifies a particular effect, which lasts for \none hour. The Shadow can only affect one sense, chosen when buying this Thorn; \nto affect multiple senses, buy it several times and spend all the required Angst. \nTypical visual effects include sudden darkness, shadows without apparent \nsources and fuzzy luminous forms. Common smell manifestations include salty sea \nair, smoke and rotting flesh. The paraphernalia of haunting, including rattling \nchains, low moans and rising shrieks abruptly cut off are popular aural effects, as are \nunexpected echoes (or the suppression of echoes). Tactile illusions include icy \nchill and the touch of unseen fingers. \nIdee Fixe: 2 Traits. The Shadow stimulates one of the wraith's Passions to \nfurious intensity. Spend one Angst Trait and make a Test of Angst against \nWillpower. If successful, the Shadow specifies a particular Passion to become so \nintense that the wraith must act in a way that qualifies for a Passion check within \none hour or lose a Trait of Willpower. \nShell Shock (Dissociation): 2 Traits. Wraiths with military experience call \nthis Thorn Shell Shock; civilians generally call it Dissociation. Spend one Angst \nTrait. For the next hour, the wraith cannot regain Pathos from a particular chosen \nPassion unless the Psyche first beats the Shadow in a contest of Willpower against \nAngst. While suffering from a blocked Passion, the Psyche feels emotionally numb \nin matters related to the emotion in question. \nCollective Unconscious: 3 Traits. The Shadow can speak to other Shadows \nwithout the Psyche noticing. (The Psyche can detect this only by winning a Static \nMental Challenge against the Shadow's Angst plus threeTraits.) ThisThorn costs \nnothing when the other Shadow has the same Archetype or one Angst per minute \nof conversation when speaking to Shadows of other Archetypes. \nPact of Doom: 3 Traits. The Great Maelstrom lets Oblivion's forces roam \nmore fieelv. Shadows in the Great War era can teach Dark Arcanoi at reeular cost \n\" \nand the wraithly and Shadow arts of other Dark Kingdoms for one extra Angst \nTrait per level. \nSTEP EIVE: LAST TOUCHES \nProceed as instructed in Oblivion. Note that wraith Corpus levels stay the \nsame whether or not you update to include Lethal and Bashing damage as in Laws \nof the Night, Revised Edition. \nSTEP SIX: SPARK \nOE UNLIEE \nComplete your character as in Oblivion. \nTHE \nARCANOI \nThe Arcanoi are the arts and crafts of the Restless Dead. They include \nsupernatural feats because the Underworld and all its inhabitants are supernatural, \nbut the process of learning and using the Arcanoi is (in its way) mundane. A wraith \nneeds only a teacher, time and diligence. \n\n\nWhenever your character uses an art that can affect more than one target, use \nthe Mob Scene rules from Laws of the Night, Revised Edition, p. 196. \nFXTENDED \nCHALLENC~FS \nMany players dislike extended challenges. These rules keep them to a \nbare minimum. If you enjoy the element of uncertainty and don’t find a few \nextra rounds of challenge wearisome, then you can convert a great many \nmore Arcanos systems to extended challenges. Whenever there’s a system \nthat specifies a unit of return per point of Pathos, Willpower or some other \ncharacteristic, interpret it to mean each success in the extended challenge \nproduces that unit of return. \nKINESIS \nThis Arcanos is the pre-computers form of Inhabit. \nInnate Abilities \nStraddle. The wraith blends into a Skinlands object. She gains temporary \nconcealment, but she acquires no control over the object. \nSystem: Make a Static Physical Challenge, difficulty of the local Shroud rating. \nIf successful, the wraith blends into an object for one turn per permanent Physical \nTrait. Another wraith also using Str& \non the same object must win a Physical \nChallenge to displace the first. Sense Kinesis and Sense Rider do detect a wraith using \nStraddle; destroying the object inflicts one level of damage on the wraith. \nBasic Abilities \nBind. The wraith passes his hand through a Skinlands device, making it \nseize up momentarily. Clocks stop, automobiles stall and large or complex ma- \nchines grind to a halt. Someone must restart the machine; fragile machinery \ngenerally needs a shaking as well as a restart. This art does not affect devices that \ncontain no moving parts. \nSystem: Make a Static Physical Challenge against the local Shroud rating. \nAnyone attempting to restart the stopped machine must make one separate \nattempt per permanent Physical Trait of the wraith using Bind. Investing emo- \ntional energy by swearing at the machine, kicking it, shaking it and the like makes \none attempt count as three. \nReliquary.Thewraithstrengthensan inanimateobject by imbuing it withPathos. \nSystem: Make a Static Physical Challenge against the local Shroud rating \nplus five Traits. If successful, the wraith can transfer one or more points of Pathos \nto the target item. Each Trait protects the object against one incident that would \notherwise destroy it. Once it does its protective work, the Pathos dissipates. \nIntermediate Abilities \nHaywire. The wraith seizes control of a Skinlands machine and manipu- \nlates it. He can, for instance, make an automobile weave, stop or accelerate to full \nspeed, but he cannot actually steer it. \nSystem: Make a Static Social Challenge against the local Shroud rating. If \nsuccessful, the wraith can make the target device perform one general action per \npoint of current Willpower. Extra actions cost one Pathos apiece. If any of the \nactions harm another person directly, the wraith gains a Trait of Angst. \n\n\nClaim. The wraith reaches into a Skinlands device and makes it an extension \nof her own body. If unattuned, she can only sense through it. Once attuned, she can \ncontrol it completely, making it do anything physically possible for it. \nSystem: Spend three Pathos. Make a Static Mental Challenge against the \nlocal Shroud rating. Very complex objects (like factories) and very large ones (like \nhouses) may require two or even three successes in an extended challenge. Claim \nlasts as long as the wraith remains in contact with the target. \nAttunement requires the wraith to spend Willpower: one for a handheld \nobject, two or three for a car and other bulky objects, up to five for a house and as \nmany as 10 for a factory. Once attuned to an object, the wraith gets a two-Trait \nbonus to efforts at Claim. \nAdvanced Ability \nLudd’s Grip. The wraith can make a Skinlands device rip itself apart \nthrough seizing up, causing some parts to run backward and other calamitous \nfailures. Devices prone to exploding generally do so. \nSystem: Spend three Pathos and one Willpower, and gain one Angst Trait. Make \na Static Physical Challenge against the local Shroud rating. If successful, the wraith \nmakes the target device break and fail. To induce particularly spectacular breakdowns \nand explosions, make two Simple Tests. If one succeeds, the device throws off pieces, \nleaks fluids and so on; if both succeed, if the device can explode, it does. \nLIEFWEB \nThe Great War version of Lrfeweb focuses much more on the individual’s own \nexperience and on coping with the psychic stresses of the Great Maelstrom. Storytellers \nshould feel at liberty to allow players’ characters to learn Lrfeweb as the problems the \nmodern-day versionpresents seldom arise. (As always, the Storytellerretains veto power.) \nInnate Ability \nLocate Fetter. The wraith can probe the area around any of his Fetters and \nsense the Fetter’s distance and direction from himself. \nSystem: Make a Static Mental Challenge against the local Shroud rating plus \ntwo Traits. The wraith gets a vague sense of anything happening close to his chosen \nFetter. He may make the same sort of challenge to learn the Fetter’s general \ndistance and direction. \nBasic Abilities \nLifeline. The wraith constructs a psychic link that binds herself to another \nwraith, letting them act as pseudo-Fetters for each other. They can pool their \nstrength to resist the Maelstrom and more readily rescue each other from a nihil \nor Spectral abduction. \nSystem: Spend one Pathos, and make a Social Challenge. If successful, the \nwraith makes a link to another wraith; the one using Lifeline must sit quietly and \nmonitor it. If she takes other actions, the line disappears. The Lifeline creator may \ntransfer Traits in any category to the other wraith, one per Trait of the creator’s \ncurrent Willpower. Wraiths may use these Traits only in resisting Maelstrom and \nSpectral complications. Loaned Traits return when the use of Lifeline ends. \nThe Lifeline creator knows immediately when the other wraith falls into the \nTempest. She may make a Static Mental Challenge against the local Maelstrom \nlevel to know just where the other wraith is, and she can direct others to that point \nfor rescue. The Lifeline creator may also make a Static Physical Challenge against \n\n\ndouble the local Maelstrom level to attempt to pull the other wraith out. Spectres \ncan pull back, turning it into a contest and adding double the Maelstrom level to \ntheir own Physical Traits for the purpose. \nThe wraith may make more than one Lifeline at a time, but no wraith can \nreceive more than one Lifeline at a time. The creator can only loan a given Trait \nto one other wraith at a time. Trying to pull a wraith out of the Tempest costs one \nTrait of Pathos for each attempt. \nFetter Sentry. The wraith forges a link between himself and a Fetter (his \nown or another wraith‘s), protecting it with his own Corpus. \nSystem: Spend three Pathos. Make a Static Physical Challenge against the \nlocal Shroud rating plus three Traits. Now, any damage done to the Fetter passes \non to the wraith instead. He may soak and heal it as usual. The wraith gets a one- \nTrait bonus per level of Fetter rating for purposes of resisting damage. Fetter Sentry \ncosts one Pathos Trait every two days to maintain; the wraith can drop it at any \ntime. This art does not work against Fetters that are or have been used as Conduits. \nThe wraith can maintain one Fetter Sentry for each level of Lifeweb he knows. \nIntermediate Abilities \nSplice Strand. The wraith manufactures a Fetter-like tie between a wraith \nand a Skinlands person, place or thing. The wraith using Splice Strand must touch \nthe object with one hand and the wraith gaining the Fetter with the other at the \ntime the link is created. \nSystem: Spend one Pathos. Make a Static Social Challenge against the local \nShroud rating plus two Traits. If successful, the wraith creates a new levelaone \nFetter. The target wraith (which may be the wraith using this art) must spend one \nPathos per day to maintain it. The wraith using Splice Strand can reattach another \nwraith to a severed Fetter. Doing so doesn’t require Pathos to maintain, but the \ndifficulty is the local Shroud rating plus four Traits, and it takes aTrait of temporary \nWillpower as well as Pathos. \nSever Strand. The wraith can break the connection between a wraith and \na particular Fetter. Doing so triggers an immediate Harrowing as well as the long- \nterm consequences of having one less Fetter. \nSystem: Spend two Pathos and one Willpower and gain three temporary \nAngst. Make a Physical Challenge against the target wraith. (If the target’s \nWillpower is higher than his total of Physical Traits, use Willpower instead.) If \nsuccessful, the severer cuts a Fetter tie, and the target falls into a Harrowing. Splice \nStrund can repair the damage; the Fetter’s owner can also touch the former Fetter \nand spend a point of permanent Willpower to fix it himself. \nAdvanced Ability \nTorsion. The wraith pulls at a Spectre’s Fetters, sending Pathos along them \nto remind the Spectre of existence before losing to the Shadow. The surge of \nemotion paralyzes the Spectre. This art doesn’t work against Spectres who no \nlonger have any Fetters, of course. \nSystem: Spend three Pathos Traits. The wraith must touch the target Spectre \nwith a hand or melee weapon, then make a Physical Challenge. If successful, the \nwraith makes a Static Social Challenge against a total of [lo- the Spectre’s highest \nFetter rating] Traits. The Spectre remains paralyzed for one turn per Trait of the \nwraith‘s current Pathos. \n\n\nDARK WATFRS DISTANT \nA  REA AT WAR SCENARIO EOR OBLIVION \nby Steve McDonald \n“Dark Waters Distant” is designed with an eye toward insertion into an \nexisting live-action chronicle, but is also suitable for we as the “first conflict” found \nat the start of a new chronicle. Use the entire outline of the story ur feel free to lift \nwhichever pieces work best in your chronicle. Strict faithfulness to the letter of the \nmaterial we provide is not mandatory. However you decide to use this material, be \nprepared for player ingenuity and creativity. \nBACKC~ROUND \nThis scenario is based on the real life exploits of the Imperial Japanese Navy \ndestroyer Sakaki. As a member of the Allied Powers, Japan sent a token force of \ndestroyers to support naval operations in the Mediterranean, both in support of the \nGallipoli landing and the remaining Allied troops in the Balkans. One pair of \ndestroyers dispatched to the region were the sister ships Matsu and Sakaki, arriving \nin the area in early 1917. Assigned to escort duty, the pair performed well, with the \nMatsu rescuing 2,500 British soldiers from the torpedoed troopship Transylvania. \nAn Austro-Hungarian submarine torpedoed the Sakaki in June of 1917, with \n68 hands drowning in the aftermath of the attack. Damaged but not destroyed, the \nship was escorted to Italy for repairs. However, imagine for the purposes of our game \nsetting that the submarine attack had a more serious effect. Imagine that the \ntorpedo that struck the Sakaki caused the main boiler to explode, mortally \nwounding the ship and dramatically increasing the number of casualties.. .. \nThose unfortunates who died aboard the Sakaki with troubled hearts and \nminds soon woke to the reality of an afterlife totally alien to them. It was only due \nto the quick action of the captain and the remaining officers that the destruction \nof the Enfant crew was averted. Subsequent conflicts have led to the end of more \nmembers of the crew, and the total complement of the Sakaki is 25 officers and men. \nTHE CURRENT \nSITUATION \nThe ship is still intact and functional, but the crew has grown increasingly \nweary of the constant wandering brought on by their alien status. Captain \nYamada has refused to ally himself with any of the factions of the Civil War in \nStygia, and while their independence has prevented bloodier conflicts, it has also \nprevented the use of a specific port as a base. While supplies may not be as \npressing a need for the Restless, the need for a secure harbor to weather out a \nMaelstrom is certainly required. \nYamada realizes that he has arrived at a point where he cannot afford to \nremain neutral. To circumvent the problem of a direct alliance with any of the \nfactions, Yamada has decided to seek a partnership with one of the smaller \nNecropoli. In exchange for the power that the Sakaki and her crew can provide, the \ncrew would have a base in which to seek shelter from Maelstroms and othex \n\n\n‘- 1 \ndangers. Unfortunately for the players, Yamada will negotiate with any faction he \ndeems powerful enough to deliver the items he desires. In short, Renegades and \nother such factions will be given equal treatment from the captain as long as they \npossess the power to deliver what they promise. \nUnbeknownst to the Japanese officers and crew, however, a threat to the ship \nis emerging from within. The Japanese officers in the engine room did not make \nthe passage into wraithhood, and the captain has had to promote from the boiler- \nroom crew to make up for their loss. The engine crew is now made up of impressed \nKorean and Okinawan sailors, men who resented their subservience to the \nJapanese officers long before their death. Under leadership of Cho, the current \nengine chief, a mutiny had been brewing before the sinking of the ship. With the \npassing of the initial dangers to the ship, Cho’s thoughts have turned again to the \noverthrow of the captain and the loyal sailors. \nHowever, the real reason for the new mutinous thoughts is much more \ninsidious. Due to a lack of Pardoners aboard and the reluctance of European wraiths \nto deal with the strange Shadows of the crew, Cho and some of the other engine- \nroom crew are losing their battle with their other halves. The mutiny is a front for \na conspiracy to bring the Sakaki over to Oblivion. \nARRIVAL \nOP THE SAKAKI \nUpon entering the port, Captain Yamada and a small group of crewmen will \nenter the Necropolis and seek out the nominal head of the city. Yamada’s party will \nbe well-trained and armed, and they should be able to dispatch any opportunistic \nrogues looking for easy pickings. \nOnce Yamada has contacted and arranged a meeting with the city’s rulers, he \nwill state what it is he wishes from the relationship. Specifically, he would like use \nof the harbor area, with a section being set aside for the crew’s exclusive use and \nfree passage for members of his crew who wish to visit the Necropolis. In return, the \ncaptain is willing to ferry local citizens to nearby locations beyond the walls that \nhave been cut off by the Great Maelstrom and aid in the defense of the Necropolis \nfrom its enemies. \nGiven the assets that the Sakaki brings, some sort of deal will likely be reached \nafter some time spent bargaining and roleplaying. The conclusion of the agreement \nwill bring the ship and its crew into port for a long overdue rest. Unbeknownst to \nthe captain and his new partners, however, a second wave of negotiations is about \nto begin. \nARRIVAL \nOF C H O  \nWith the new shore privileges enjoyed by the crew, Cho and his faction can \nseek out the opponents of the captain’s new allies and attempt to gain their \nassistance. Any groups that the captain’s party spumed will be obvious targets for \nCho. Cho is a natural for allegiance with whatever Renegade or Insurrectionist \ngroups are active in the area, and he will gladly supply them with items smuggled \noff the ship. \nStorytellers will most likely wish to allow the above situation to continue for \na few sessions in order to allow the various factions to form up. Both groups have \ndecided advantages. The captain has the most immediate access to the ship and the \nresources it provides (such as Relics, mindless seaman Drones and munitions). \n\n\nFurthermore, he will be able to relate easily with any upper-class wraiths or former \nsailors (especially British ones). \nThe faction that backs the mutineers has one important edge: surprise. It has \nnot occurred to the captain in the slightest that the engine room is harboring a \nmutiny. It is inconceivable to him that the Asian wraiths would allow themselves \nto become divided so far from home. Cho plans on showing him the falsity of this \nnotion. The ship’s Japanese officers have long oppressed and imprisoned Cho and \nhis co-conspirators, and their feelings may strike sympathetic chords with Loyalists \nin an Imperialist Necropolis. The Koreans’ appeal to local Renegade groups should \nbe obvious as well. \nComplicating matters is a secret motivator behind Cho’s actions: his increas- \ningly powerful Po. Initially willing to settle for the end of the Sakaki and its crew, \nit has set its sights on anew prize: the players’ Necropolis. While Renegades or more \nliberal Hierarchy members may sympathize with the plight of the engine crew, \ntheir opinions will almost certainly change when (or if) they discover the darker \nmotivations at work. \nTHE BITTER FND \nOnce you set these factors into play, your particular chronicle can take off in \nany direction you desire. However, consider the following as a possible outcome. \nAssuming that the players are unable to defuse the situation brought on by \nCho’s conspirators, the sides will inevitably clash. Cho’s plan will call for \nsmuggling whatever co-conspirators are combat threats into the engine-room area. \nFrom there, the group will storm the officers’ mess in an attempt to capture the \ncaptain and his officers. Once he’s done so, Cho intends to turn the awesome \nfirepower of the Sakaki on the very walls of the Necropolis. \nCho’s promise of great amounts of carnage has drawn the attention of \nOblivion’s soldiers. They swarm the Sakaki, rallying against the captain’s officers \n(and whomever else stands with them) while the mutineers make their move. \nShould the mutineers fall, the Shadow-eaten will continue their assault on the \nSakaki. Their goal, like Cho’s, is to maneuver the Sakaki into firing position and \nbring down the walls of the players’ Necropolis. Should they do so, they will swarm \nthe city, laying waste to everything in sight. \nA likely result of this scenario is the destruction of the sakaki. Realizing Cho’s \nintent, Captain Yamada (or the remaining loyal officers) will attempt to pull the \nship away from the port to spare the Necropolis further damage. If he is unable to \ndo so, his only recourse will be to detonate the ship’s magazine. Should Cho be \nroused from the control of his P’o and realize just what he has done, he may undergo \na last-minute change of heart as well. He can engineer an explosion of the engines, \nwhich would stop the bombardment and put an end to the mutiny as well. It is even \npossible that the Spectres leading the attack on the Necropolis and the Sakaki will \nchange their objectives if they realize that they are losing the battle to use the \nSakaki as a weapon. As a last resort, they may choose to detonate the ship’s \nmagazine themselves, settling for taking out as many wraiths as they can tha way. \nD A M A ~ E  \nCONTROL \nPossible problems with the scenario begin with the player reaction to the \nappearance of the ship. Rowdy players may decide that a heavily armed Japanese \n\n\ndestroyer would make an excellent yacht while Relic-scavengers will salivate over \nthe floating haul that the Sakaki represents. \nStorytellers can easily avoid this outcome through a variety of means. The \neasiest is to impress upon the players the destructive power that the Sakaki carries \naboard. A glance at the Great War sourcebook shows the level of injury possible \nwith modem weapons. From a roleplaying perspective, wraiths who were veterans \nof constant shelling from land guns can extrapolate just how bad a barrage from the \ndeck of the Sakuki would be. Another means of stopping player shenanigans is \naltering the local defense situation to make the ship more attractive. Scavengers \nmay want the ship, but when it is all that stands between them and Oblivion, it \nsuddenly develops shelf life. \nThe second most likely problem is the survival of the Sakaki itself. While the \ndestroyer makes an excellent plot feature, placing such firepqwer in the hands of \nthe local Necropolis can unbalance the long-term health of the chronicle. It is \nconceivable that early detection of the P o  influence on Cho or a lack of support \nfor one of the factions could cause the mutiny to either not occur or to end before \nthe arrival of the Oblivion’s hordes. \nIt can easily be impressed on the minds of the characters who hold the city \nwhat a danger the Sukuki could be to their health. A ship of that size would attract \ninterest, interest that could draw the community deeper into the Stygian Civil \nWar. The ship could well bring on a host of internal problems as different factions \nin the city vie again and again for control of the potent vessel. \nVARIATIONS \nOf course, you may mod& the preceding scenario to fit your chronicle in any \nway you wish. In your game, the Sakuki may not be destroyed at all. It may remain \nthroughout the life of the game, anchored just off-site, providing another in-game \nlocation or a constant source of conflict. The players’ characters may even decide \nto scuttle it after the preceding events play out to supplement their war effort. \nHowever, if the basic premise doesn’t appeal to you, try including the Sakuki \nin your Great War chronicle in these alternate ways: \nRAIDER \nThe ship could simply be a pirate preying upon the locals. Remove the \nKorean-conspiracy element, add a greater degree of P‘o influence onboard, and you \nhave a basic scenario for starting and intermediate players to tangle with. \nTo SAVE \nOUR EORMER \nALLIES \nIn another variation that removes Cho and his corruption, the captain of the \nSukuki wishes to use the port for a far different reason. After finding himself in the \nShadowlands, Yamada hopes to establish the players’ Necropolis as a base to \nextract Western wraiths from the African theater ofwar. Interaction with the Bush \nof Ghosts and exposure to the strange Arcanos of African wraiths are a few of the \nmore basic offerings this chronicle concept provides. This frame establishes the \nplayers’ Necropolis as a central refuge for many different types of wraiths, allowing \nfor a constant influx of new story potential. \n\n\nIMPRESSMENT \nAssume that Captain Yamada’s intentions are not so noble as they would \nappear to be. In this variant scenario, the captain’s negotiations are a front for \nsomething more insidious. With the recent deaths of some of his crew members, \nthe captain needs replacements. And where would be better to draw those \ncrewmen from than a Necropolis with no protector from depredation? \nSTORYTELLER \nCHARACTERS \nThe two most influential characters driving this chronicle concept are \nCaptain Toshio Yamada and the Korean Pien Cho. Build these characters using \nthe Dark Kingdom of Jade rules provided in the fourth issue of the Journal, \nbut feel \nfree to adjust their relative levels of power to remain in balance with your \nchronicle. However, there are some basic characteristics to keep in mind when \ncreating these characters. \nCaptain Yamada’s main regret is that he died outside of Japan. He is a shrewd \nand dignified leader who inspires confidence and trust in his officers and crew. He \nis a staunch supporter of the Allied cause during the Great War, and he is willing \nto assist the Allies who have found themselves in the Shadowlands. His Passions \ninclude his desire to protect the honor and security of the Sakaki, to protect his crew \nand those with whom he makes alliances and to return to his native Japan once the \nGreat Maelstrom abates to a level in which that return is possible. \nCho, on the other hand, shares no such patriotism with Captain Yamada. His \nregret is that he died while impressed into servitude aboard the Sakaki, and his P’o \nshould never cease to remind him of that regret. Driven thus, Cho will stop at \nnothing to gain his freedom, overthrow the haughty Captain Yamada and perhaps \neven return to his own native Korea. If he can do so with the reclaimed Sakuki as \nhis prize, that’s all the better. \n\n\nCOSTUMINC~ \nEOR LIVE-ACTION PLAY \nby Laura D. Hanson \nThis article is the first in a limited series on the hows and wherefores of \nhistorical URP costuming. We found Laura at the 1999 Gen-Con, and we’re \nglad we did so. And for those astute readers out there who caught the last issue of \nthe Journal, no, Laura is not “Auntie Csilla.” \n~~ \n~ \n~ \nFirst off, for those of you wondering who this woman is and why you should \nbe taking advice from her at all, here’s a little back history on me. Currently, \nI run a small costuming business in New York City. I have about 15 years of \npractical costuming experience, gathered in various places like university \ncostume shops, Renaissance festivals and the occasional Halloween and LARP \nsewing gig. Regular Gen-Con attendees may also have encountered my \ncostumes (usually with me in them) wandering through the dealers’ hall. \nAlong the way, I also managed to pick up a degree in medieval history (so \nplease forgive me if the Dark Ages section seems to run on a bit), all of which \nleaves me qualified to talk to you about some of the more important aspects of \naccurate period costuming. And that is more than enough about me. Let’s get \non to the costume-designing, shall we? \nThe most important piece of preliminary advice I can give you is, “Get \nthee to a library!” Yes, this means research. Stick your nose into a book about \nthe time period you are going to game in and read about it. Find etchings or \ndrawings or photographs of people from the time and study the way their \nclothes looked. If you really want an authentic feel for the era that you’re about \nto enter, research it. That, in its simplest form, is really the best advice that \nanyone can give you about costuming for a historical setting. Since the reality \nof it is slightly more complex than that, let me give you a few points on how \nto wade through all of the information (and misinformation) out there. My \nadvice will enable you to garb your character effectively and satisfactorily for \nplay in the Dark Ages, the Wild West or the Great War period. \nTHE \nDARKAGES \nJust to get one of the more common misconceptions about Dark Ages \nfashion (not to mention one of my pet peeves) out of the way, noblemen at the \nend of the 12th century never spent their days dressed in full plate mail armor. \nThe first reason being that full plate armor did not exist until the 13th century \nor so, and the second reason is that even when it did exist, wearing it to dinner \nwould have been roughly equivalent to strapping on a Volkswagen and trying \nto eat. It just didn’t happen. \nAnother stereotype that you should avoid is the Robin Hood look, made \nfamous by Errol Flynn and more recently Cary Elwes. As a part of this look, \n\n\nheroes wore tights and streamlined suede vests. Every line of these outfits \nexisted to show off the contours of a heroic frame. There was actually a time \nwhen men dressed this way, and it’s called 1930s Hollywood. Second, the \npointed hennin, or “princess hat,” also comes from a later date, more like the \n13th or 14th centuries, as does any form of close-fitting garment. \nYes, that’s right. Dark Ages fashion had yet to discover tailoring. Clothes for \nboth men and women were long and simply cut, with very few seams. Clothing \nstyle did not differ much from class level to class level, but quality and amount \nof material did. For example, a peasant woman might wear a simple wool ankle- \nlength gown, but a noblewoman would wear a floor-length version of the same \nstyle, made out of velvet or brocaded cloth with a second, shorter gown over it. \nCastle dwellers wore more clothing not only because they had more money, but \nbecause castles were really cold and damp and generally unpleasant. \nColor was another important factor in class-distinction. Animal- and \nvegetable-based dyes were expensive, and they faded quickly. Therefore, the \ndeeper the color of your clothes, the more prosperous you looked because you \ncould obviously afford to either keep re-dying things or buying new ones. In a \nworld where most people had only two sets of clothes at a time (if they were \nlucky), dark or brilliantly colored clothing practically shouted “Nobility!” \nThere were even sumptuary laws governing what colors each level of noble \ncould wear. It was a way to maintain a visual class distinction among courtiers, \nhelping people to “know their place.” Purple was usually reserved for royalty \nonly, no matter what country you hailed from, but rulers would often also enact \nlaws restricting their favorite colors. Color also came into play with heraldry, \nwith different courts dressing in the colors of their ruler’s coat-of-arms. Use of \ncolor could be very effective in game play if, for example, only the prince and \nprince’s courtiers dressed in scarlet. The color of blood and power would be an \nimmediate visual reminder of who truly rules the city. \nThe basic style for men was a long-sleeved T-tunic gown (yes, I said gown) \nthat slipped on over the head and reached mid-calf in length. It was worn \nbelted at the waist and was very loose-fitting to allow for ease of movement. \nMen commonly wore knitted stockings as leg coverings and either plain \nleather slippers or sandals. (Birkenstock-style shoes work well for this look, \nalthough they do tend to be pricey.) The only other piece of the daily wardrobe \nwas the cape or cloak, cut on a circular pattern. These garments had no \nshoulder seams or hoods. They consisted of just a large circle or partial circle \nof fabric, draped around the shoulders and held either with circle pins or a band \nof fabric stitched to create a neck opening. Since patterns of any kind actually \nhad to be woven into the cloth instead of printed on top, decoration commonly \ntook the form of edge trim in wide bands which could be removed from one \ngarment and transferred to another when the first one wore out. \nThere are two ways to approach dressing for the Dark Ages as a man. One \nis to grit your teeth, find someone who sews and be really nice to them - \nthen \nto learn to wear tights and like it. The other way is to simplify your wardrobe. \n~ \n\n\nWear very plain drawstring pants and a plain, oversized pullover shirt with a \nsimple neckline that you feel comfortable wearing a belt over (so you have \nsomewhere to put that all-important belt pouch). Find undecorated, slip-on \nboots if you’re not the sandals type, and invest your wardrobe money in a full- \ncircle or half-circle cloak. This is one of the few time periods I would \nrecommend buying a cape for first, but 12th-century clothing was all about \ndraperies. Wear fabric, and lots of it. \nNow for the ladies. Your basic wardrobe would be something like this: a \nlightweight linen or cotton full length slip called a chemise, usually white or \noff-white, over that a floor-length dress with long, tight sleeves and a high \nneck-line. Over that, wear a knee-length overdress with shorter, wider sleeves. \nA belt cinched everything in at the waist. Unmarried women could wear their \nhair down loosely or in braids while married women wore veils draped over \ntheir hair, sometimes held by a band of braided cloth or a circlet of metal that \nwas almost Arabic in style. Plain boots are good for outdoor footwear, while \n“ballerina flat” style shoes make good indoor slippers. \nTo capture the basic look, I would recommend a long-sleeve unstructured \ndress, floor length if possible. If you can find one in a solid color and a natural \nfabric like linen, cotton or wool, great. If you happen to sew, two patterns that \nhave the right basic feel to them are Simplicity 9103 (version D, but longer) \nand McCall’s 7957 (versions A or E). Then accessorize. For hip girdles, look \nin thrift shops for chain-belts with long tails that will hang down your skirts, \nor check the upholstery section of your local fabric store for thick, decorative \ncording that can serve the same purpose. For “older” female characters, veiling \nthe hair is necessary. The veil should be a white or sheer lightweight fabric, not \nbridal veiling or tulle. If your character is wealthy, heavy chain necklaces and \nlarge rings (again, look in thrift stores or “antique malls”) make good additions \nto your costume. You can also add a half or full-circle cloak to top things off. \nTHE WILD WEST \nAll women in the Old West were not saloon girls who wore satin and \nfeathers and showed off their legs. Similarly, all men were not gamblers, \ncowboys, Indians, buckskinned Wild Bill Hickock types, gunslingers or sher- \niffs. They were mostly average farmer types who had more in common with \nLittk House on the Prairie than with Tombstone. Clothes were simple and easy \nto take care of because there were more important things to worry about. The \nmain thing to remember is that the Wild West happened during the Victorian \nera, which means that high fashion echoed English clothing of the time. This \nknowledge can make research quite a bit easier to find since it widens your field \nof reference. \nGuys, things just got easier for you. Men’s clothing had begun to settle into \nthe same basic patterns it follows today, which means that pulling together \nyour outfit might just be as easy as delving into your closet. A man’s basic \n\n\nwardrobe in the 1800s would be plain, pull-on work boots, wool pants (zippers \nwere invented already, so no worries there) with suspenders and a button-up, \ncollarless shirt. The shirts could be white, or solid colors like red or blue, and \nthey often had vertical stripes on a white background. Add a few accessories \nlike a bandanna or a single-breasted vest, and that’s it - \nyou’re done. \nIf you’re planning on playing a cowboy or a gold-miner type, you can even \nget away with blue jeans, just as long as they’re not modern looking. Modem \nin this case means anything really tight fitting or super-baggy, or anything that \nhas labels all over it. Basic, boring, straight-leg Levi’s in dark blue denim are \nthe most accurate match you’ll find today. Also, you should avoid anything \n“something-washed” or ripped, unless you want to look poor. Tom clothes did \nnot denote fashion; they denoted poverty. \nA good, basic piece of costuming to focus on here is the vest. A vest in the \nright style can completely change the character of an outfit. A fancy, double- \nbreasted vest with satin lapels can make a white shirt and dress slacks into a \ngambler’s uniform. Add the low-slung hip-holster and a wide, flat-brimmed \nhat and you’re a gunslinger (although no prop guns in a LARP, please). \nWorking-class types might wear a more plain, single-breasted vest made out of \ncanvas or wool. Suspenders are another good way to achieve a working-class \nlook. They create the impression of a man who spends a lot of time laboring \nwith his jacket off. \nWomen of the era ran the gamut from strictly corseted, bustle-pad- \nwearing Victorian ladies, all the way down to the women who dressed in men’s \nclothes because of the hard labor they did, such as panning for gold or farming. \nBasic fashion dictated a full ankle-length skirt, worn with petticoats and \nbloomers underneath. High-necked white blouses, often with lots of detailed \nstitching, accompanied the look, which often included a short, fitted jacket. \nDresses were cut along similar lines, with close, fitted bodices, long sleeves and \nfull skirts. Everyday wear was mostly cotton or calico-print, while more formal \nwear could be silk or satin or even velvet. Proper women never exposed their \nlegs in public (even sight of an ankle was considered shocking), but in formal \nevening dress, it was common to see low-cut necklines and short sleeves \nexposing the arms. The “fallen angels,” as saloon girls were often called, went \nto even further extremes, sometimes wearing completely sleeveless gowns with \nthe skirts cut scandalously short. The Victorians loved color, and saloon girls \nalso took this favor to extremes, wearing bright, contrasting patterns such as \nstripes and checks together. They wore their hair back, away from the face, and \nthey piled it up in a bun or curls. Shoes should be easy to find, just look for the \nlow-heeled, lace-up “granny-boot” style of today. (There is after all, a reason \nwe call them “granny-boots.”) \n\n\nTHE \n(;REAT WAR FRA \nThe time period surrounding the Great War actually suffers from the least \namount of stereotyping of the eras mentioned here. Mostly, that’s because it \nwas a time of major transition: adecade in a world moving from the restrictions \nof the Victorian era to the free spirit of the 1920s with “The War to End All \nWars” thrown in to help move things along. \nMen’s clothing had basically settled into the patterns it follows today, at \nleast in more formal dress. Suits were slightly more fitted at the waist and \nbuttoned higher at the front so that the lapels were shortened. Vests were still \ncommonly worn, and hats were still very much in fashion. Men wore bowlers \nor flat “newsboy” caps for daywear, straw boaters (think Barbershop Quartets) \nin the summer and top hats for the evening. Vertical stripes were very popular \nin both jackets and shirts, usually a darker stripe on a light background, but \ndark suits with pin-stripes were also popular. If you invest in a good tweed or \npinstripe vest and a hat of the appropriate type, you should have two of the \ncornerstones of your costume. All that you’ll need to add to it are the extras, \nlike pocket watches and handkerchiefs. \nWomen’s fashion, on the other hand was all over the place. Women were \nmoving away from the tight restrictions of corsets and long skirts as they moved \nfrom the home into the workplace, although they had not yet achieved the \nfreedom that the 1920’s would give them. Skirts had raised up to mid-calf, \ndaywear allowed women to expose their arms for the first time, and the dancer \nIrene Castle had set the fashion for shorter, wavy hair and decorative headbands \nas well as dresses with flowing drapery and scarves. A suited, menswear style had \nalso come into vogue, due in large part to women taking over in factories and \nsuch while the men were away at war. The ‘Isailor dress” with its uniform details \nwas popular, as was the new “sports” look, which had women in mannish, \ntailored shirts, with ties and fitted jackets. Skirts remained at least calf-length \nand very full, similar to the poodle skirts of the 1950’s (sans poodles). \nA loose, calf-length tank dress in a satiny fabric would work well for \nevening wear. Pair it with a long scarf or rectangle of silky fabric draped around \nyour neck with the ends flowing down your back. (Just be careful of car doors.) \nYou can achieve an even better period silhouette by wrapping a scarf or shawl \naround your hips and then blousing the dress slightly over it. Wear it with a \n“flapper” headband (sequined, with an ostrich plume perhaps) and a few long \nstrands of“pearl” beads to set the look. Stockings or hose and pumps (especially \nthe ones with t-straps) are perfectly acceptable for footwear as women were \nbeginning to show off their ankles. And if you just can’t wrap your brain \nvisually around the look, think 1920’s “flapper” but with longer skirts. \nFor daytime wear, look into pleated skirts and lots of plaids, which were \nvery popular, especially in suits. Simple white blouses worn with short, wide \nneckties or scarves that match the suit make another nice period touch. \nAccessories included clutch bags, gloves and many different styles of hat. \n\n\nWRAPPING UP \nFinally, here are a few basic tips to help with any historic costume design. \nFirst, I meant what I said about research. Go to the library and look up your new \ntime period if you aren’t familiar with it. Most library databases file clothing \nunder the subject followed by the time period and/or the region. The Dark \nAges, for example, would be found under “Costume-12th Century-European,” \nor more specifically “-Italy” or “-England” while the Wild West would be \nfound at “Costume-1 9th Century-Western or -Victorian.’’ For the Great War \nera, look up America or Europe between 1914 and 1919. Some specific book \ntitles that I like are The Mode in Costume by Ruth Turner Wilcox for a good, \ngeneral overview of a lot of different time periods, and American Costume 191 5 \n-1 970, which begins with a nice section on Great War fashion. \nIf you just aren’t the library type, the Internet is your next best bet for \ninformation. There are all kinds of costuming sites and newsgroups online, \nmany ofwhich are happy to help out people with questions. You can start your \nresearch someplace like alt.history.costuming on Usenet, or Costuming Re- \nsources Online at http://members.aol.com/nebula5/costume.html. An excellent \nsource for tips on medieval costuming is the Society for Creative Anachro- \nnism; most of their local web-sites have links to costuming pages. \nFor more visual references, you can watch movies dealing with the time, \nas long as they are well made with authentic costuming. I like Zeferelli’s Hamkt \n(yes, the one with Me1 Gibson) for its Dark Age costuming, as well as the \nCudfuel mystery series on PBS. Corny as it sounds, Littk House on the Prairie had \nthe whole settler look down fairly well. While I wouldn’t recommend sitting \nthrough all of that saccharine goodness just for a few costuming tips, if you \nhappen to stumble across a re-run, it wouldn’t hurt to take a look. For the Great \nWar, check out Legends ofthe Fall with Brad Pitt, Galipoli starring Me1 Gibson \n(he does seem to like those costume dramas) or Julie Andrews in Darling Lily \n(just remember that the fast-forward button can be your friend.) \nLast, but certainly not least, here are a few generic tips for historical dress \nthat I would like to pass on since a lot of people tend to overlook them. Try to \navoid wearing any kind of modem shoe with your costume, especially any sort \nof athletic shoe. It doesn’t matter what they look like or if they are black-they \nwill never look right. And except in specific circumstances, a cape should \nabsolutely, positively be the last thing that you buy for a costume. No really. It \ndoesn’t cover up your street clothes; it just makes your street clothes look out \nof place. \nAgain, research is the key to good costuming for live-action play. Find a \nlook that appeals to you, and copy it as best you can. A good costume can go \na long way to establishing a living, breathing (or not) character and make your \nroleplaying more compelling and entertaining for everyone involved. \n"
