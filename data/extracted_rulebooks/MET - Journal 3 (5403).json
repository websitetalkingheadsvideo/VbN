Sort ofa \ncross between a round-table discussion and a WWF cage-match, this is the place \nto hash out issues regarding Mind’s Eye from licensing to rule-brokenness to \nLARPing style. Give me your opinions, respond to opinions you see here, bnbe \nme just to get your name in print, whatever. Just keep it relatively clean, and stay \noff the bad side of the people you disagree with. After all, that keen-edged rapier \nwit is designed for each others’ arguments and opinions, not for each others’ \npersonal lives. \n(For the readers who aren’t clued in to how fast the publishing schedule \nmoves, let this letter column stand as a guide. Only now am I getting to print \nresponses to letters that appeared in the first issue of the Journal. For those \nof you who sent me mail concerning letters in the last issue, fear not - \nI’m \nnot ignoring you. As of publication of this issue, I simply hadn’t received \nthem yet.) For those of you just tuning in, a debate thread concerning two \ndifferent LARP games appeared in the first issue of the Journal. One \naccused the other of being a juvenile gore-fest that encouraged min-maxing; \nthe other accused the first of being overly complicated, thus hamstringing \nroleplaying. Our first outside contender, Matt Sullins, weighs in on that \nissue and others. \nWell, Carl, you asked for some personal opinions in the sidebar at the end \nof [“The Current Thinking” in the first issue of the Journal]. You asked, “HOW \nfar is too far before you lose the roleplaying and Storytelling aspects that make \nour games what they are?” My only thought here is that as soon as my players \nand I begin playing a game it is no longer yours. There is no such thing as “too \nfar” as long as we enjoy ourselves. The White Wolf Nazi Terror Squad is not \ngoing to break down my door and shut down my LARP. There is no reason not \nto play as the group sees fit. Mind you, I personally stand by the Big 6 rules in \nall of the Masquerade books. (While the White Wolf Nazi Terror Squad might \nnot stop you from breaking these, other groups, like the police, might. Keep \nthat in mind before you go biting some innocent teenager’s neck and trying to \nuse “Matt told me it was OK’ as a defense.) \nT\nH\n~\n \nC U R R E N T  THINK IN^ \nQ) \n"

      "text": "Finally, I have a question of my own that I would like to throw into the \nring. Do other LARPers feel that their group should organize and encourage \ncharity work? I know that the Camarilla is in favor of this, and I have found it \nto be a good thing myself. I am just curious as to the opinions of others. \nHugs and Chainsaws, \n-Matt \nSullins \nHead Storyteller \nSeraphim Theater Troupe \n“Terror squad” indeed. Terror squads are sopuss. Everyone knows it’s \nall lawyers now. Anyway. \nI’ll keep this short and sweet. To solve this rules debate [from Issue #1], \ntake Liber des Goules, turn to page 16, look for the heading that says, “The \nOnly Rules That Matter,” and read. \nAside from that, if your troupe wants to incorporate wereparrots from \npost-apocalyptic Antarctica, go for it. It’s just a (damn great) game. \n-Robert \nDupuis \nWell then. Moving on, we come to Mark Lewis, a guy who (without \nhaving seen the second issue of the Journal, ironically) has come out with \nhis opinion on the Camarilla organization and One World by Night blazing. \nH e  also opines on the varying degrees of LARP maturity, as he sees them. \nBefore I begin, let me congratulate you on a good first issue. It was \nentertaining, well presented and didn’t suck. My one critique: is starting off \nwith “The True Black Hand” a device I have yet to see regarded as well liked \nby any of the local LARPs (or the glut of MUSHes I stop in at regularly). \nYour questions are interesting. Cam, Independent or Wannabecam (Le., \nOne World By Night)? Speaking only for the games in my area, that I have had \ncontact with, Indie appears the best. The Camarilla earned itself a bad name \nback in the early ‘90s with its - ahem - LARP. Unfortunately, the system of \n“buff stats for doing Cam organization stuff placed too much power in the \nhands of twits. The Storyteller staff felt the need to make each “episode” \n(episodic nature being a problem unto itself in my view) more grandiose than \nthe last. Why, in the first game I played, our opponent was an Unseelie Fae (a \nyear or two before The Shining Host, might I add) who had managed to kidnap \nthe Raccoon Totem. Oh yes, this is the subject of a Vampire LARP. My \nexperience with One Worldby Night andother “shareduniverse” groups is just \nas dismal. The few roleplayers that were present were dwarfed by the Rules \nLawyers, Stick Jocks Turned LARPer and Sixteen-Year-Old Cool Kids, none \nof whom had any idea what was going on. But the “Cam, Indie, Other” \nclassification system doesn’t hit the real issues. \n"

      "text": "plot” is most important. The players are new to playing. They want to create \ncharacters who incorporate every cool little thing they’ve seen/read/heard/ \ndreamed. They see the letter of the rules and not the spirit. They consider a \nClan War to be that cluster-fuck-mass-combat that happens at the end of each \nand every one of their games because the boredom just has to be stopped. In \nshort, everyone has the drive to play and make a game of it, but they don’t yet \nknow the differences between MET LARPing and table top (or boffer weapons \nfor that matter). The combat wombats usually gravitate toward the fringes of \nthe game where no one will interfere with their challenges. The socialites will \nfind a dark comer and grope. The unsure will mill about, occasionally trying \nsomething that pops into their heads just to be doing something. And the \n“good LARPers” hide from everyone for as long as they can in the hopes their \nwell-thought-out character (who even has Flaws meant to build character, \nrather than to min-max points) can survive the night. This is the game where \narchons and justicars show up regularly because there “is just no other way to \nkeep control.” \nThe sophomore LARP comes about when the Storytellers or players (or \nsome of both) start to see the Story within the Game. The Storytellers try to \nmake some movement toward a coherent plot line that they hope is new and \ndifferent. They allow and encourage some player-driven plots, as long as the \nsanctity of “their plot” remains. They discourage the combat wombats by \nthrowing in some “heavy hitters,” designed just for that purpose. They start to \nprovide rumors based on Influences, and they encourage players to research \nsaid rumors to find plot. The players, in turn, place some thought into a new \ncharacter, with the emphasis more on character than min-maxing. The social \norder starts to develop, and primogen last more than a couple games, but there \nare still problems. Those one or two players who are better schemers then the \nStorytellers get stomped on “in the name of plot” cough - ego-bruised - cough. \nThe Storyteller’s roommate is the antagonist “since he knows everything \nabout the plot anyway”. The “fringe players” still can’t quite get involved \nenough, no one gloms on to them as the useful pawns they can be. Things still \naren’t right. \nThe senior LARP is a partnership between Storyteller and player. It is a \nseries of joint tales, told by everyone involved. Ego doesn’t rear its head much \nany more, the Storytellers encourage players who manage to outthink them, \nand they create fluid enough plots to compensate and entertain. Players make \ncharacters who need development, so they can find a personal story within that \ndevelopment. Combat is rare, but when it happens it furthers the story, not \nsimply kills an hour and 1/3 of the player base. The Storyteller’s plots are subtle \nand provoke emotion; they promote roleplaying rather than just existing as a \nthing to “discover and be amazed.” \nI have yet to see a senior game, and I’ve been a Storyteller at two separate \nLARPs. I’ve seen games come close but they always seem to fail in the end. And \nit’s due to that second question: Is this an invite-only game or open-invite? It’s \n"

It’s the new Storyteller who, it turns out, has no clue but has to be \nin charge anyway. It’s the random factor of not knowing what new DNA is \nhitting the gene-pool this month. \nSo in my mind, the number of rules mean nothing. It’s the players and \nStorytellers that are using the rules that make the difference. \nWow, I really like this soapbox now, don’t I? \nLater. \n-Mark \nLewis \nLuchadore of Gehenna \nH e  sure does. Can anybody help me out on “luchadore” though? \nAnyhow, the next two letters jump track a bit from the previous discussion. \nThey deal with possible causes of sexism in roleplaying gaming (as opposed \nto “sexism in role-playing,” which is altogether different), from some people \nwho have been on the receiving end. Thanks to the “Conclave” mailing list \nfor sparking this topic of discussion. \nMost of the men in gaming have been playing roleplaying games for some \ntime now. They have been doing that playing with men, for the most part. That \nis the situation they are used to and it is somewhat strange to find themselves \nplaying with women now. But I think another factor could be the difference \nin styles of roleplaying between men and women. \n[Women] tend to play less aggressively (or at least less overtly aggressive) \nthan the guys do. Women also tend to care more about the roleplaying aspects \nof the game and having interesting in-game conversations than about maxing \ntheir points and having a heinous character. \nI know that I have been told that I don’t build my characters well. I have \nbeen told, with my points, I should have bought this and that and that over \nthere just to be a stronger more ‘efficiently’ built character. This player (and \nI think most of us may have an idea who might have said this) never considered \nthat I bought what I did for my character because it fit what my character was \ndoing in her life and then un-life. As her situation changed I bought different \nthings to help her not because it was a “good buy.” \nMy point in explaining all of that was that this player, and those like him \nwho believe in having the most solid player possible, do not have much respect \nfor me or my ability as a player when I don’t try to min-max. \nUnless you have an obviously strong character, you aren’t perceived as a \nthreat by the other characters. It’s true outside the game as well. Unless you are \nan obviously strong player, the others don’t go out of their way to play with you. \n"

      "text": "And truthfully, it does get annoying to be treated as though the women \nin these games are merely there for decoration. This isn’t a ‘slight diversion,’ \nor a ‘cute hobby,’ for us, we are there to play and be involved. \nO n  the other hand, I do think that the women don’t tend to jump into the \ngame the way the men do. They often hang around the sidelines and wait to \nbe included, whereas the men tend to walk in and demand attention. \nAnd yet, when we do demand attention or stand up in a situation we \nshould be recognized in and they still overlook us, it gets harder to try and take \na stand the next time. Or the situation can occur that we try to stand up and \nget noticed, begin pushing to get noticed, and all the guys will do is think ‘bitch’ \nand then make it a point to not interact with our characters. \nIt just seems harder to strike that balance and gain their respect as a player. \n-Luciann \nWasson \nThe problem having been broached, another respondent on the same \nthread had this to say about where this brand of sexism comes from, as well \nas a thought on how to stem the tide. \nTrue, most of the guys spent the first formative years of their roleplaying \ncareers in hormonally swamped all-guy groups where the only females were the \nnefarious NPC succubi who attempted to lure their half-elf paladin fighter- \nmages away from the treasure caves. Our live-action games are (hopefully) \nmore mature and complicated, and they require more roleplaying skill than \nperhaps many of us have trained for. \nI think that men need the practice of seeing women as varied, three- \ndimensional fictional characters, and women need the practice of seeing (and \nexpressing) themselves that way. Let me give you a personal example: \nIn the process of my job search, I talked with a fellow from the Navy who \ninformed me that, with my qualifications, I was eligible for a nuclear physics \nprogram that could have me commanding my own nuclear-powered battleship \nwithin two decades. \nThe second most disturbing occurrence that I had to put up with upon \nrevealing this possible opportunity was that every male friend I told about it \nreacted with, “Awwww! Isn’t that cute! Although every time you give an order \nto fire, they’d just pinch your cheeks and pat you on the head!” - or something \nsimilar. \nThe most disturbing thing about it was that I couldn’t picture myself in \nsuch a job. It would take Xena or Demi Moore from G.I. June to do that - \nsomeone who could handle such a role. Not me. I would just get laughed at and \npinched on the cheeks. \nI wouldn’t call all of this “sexism,” however - \nthat label implies more of \na deliberate intent. I think that the situation of women in our live-action \ngames is more a result of the habits and social conditioning of both sexes as well \n"

GIRL’S LOVE SLAVE \nor \nWHY \nIT’S GOOD To B E A N  € L E I N A  BARN \nS E R I  O U S L Y .  \nBefore I get into the meat of this issue’s column (or the flavored and textured soy, for \nthose of you who are vegetarians in your reading habits), allow me to pass on a little \nconvention-going advice. If, perchance, you discover that the convention you want to \nattend is being held in a quote-unquote “Agricultural Center,” be aware that what they \nreally mean by that is “barn.” Actually, what they mean is “really big barn.” In the particular \ninstance from which I was able to glean this insight, “WesternNorth Carolina Agricultural \nCenter” was semantically equivalent to “Livestock Auction Building Off to the Side of a \nCollection of Big Barns.” In still other words, “Moo.” \nWhich doesn’t prove much of anything, I suppose, but it is good to keep in mind before \nyou traipse off to Asheville, or wherever. Now, where was I? \nOh yes. Elves in barns, and why it’s good to be one. \nThere’s been a slow but steady stream of mail into the office about the choice of books \nwe’ve put out for the Mind’s Eye Theatre line. These letters are about why some topics have \nreceived attention and others haven’t, i.e. why Wraith got translated early on, why \nApocalypse went out of print, why we haven’t printed one of the approximately four billion \nMET Mage submissions to come in and so on. And yes, all of these questions will be \nanswered in an upcoming column. Honest. There’s a method to this madness, and no, it \ndoesn’t involve a dart board or flipping a coin. \nIn any case, a repeated theme in this correspondence is a curiosity about The Shining \nHost. Some folks want to know why we did the book, because changelings are notoriously \ndifficult to integrate into Vampire LARP games. After all, they’re theoretically shiny and \nhappy, they don’t necessarily hang out at art museums after closing or trendy clubs at all, and \nthey have means of kicking a vampire’s ass that are both unexpected and very difficult to \nguard against. Others want to know why we did the book at all, or why we didn’t do it sooner, \nor why there aren’t nunnehi rules.. . well, you get the idea. But mostly, people are a bit thrown \noff by the fact that The Shining Host seems to stand in such opposition to Masquerade. \nSo let’s take some time and think about The Shining Host and what it’s good for. \n"

      "text": "I admit that the concept of doing Changeling for MET was originally a daunting one. \nWhy? Well, for one thing, by the time the Mind’s Eye schedule got straightened out back \nthen, I had an appallingly short time to actually get the thing written. This is what we in \nthe business of putting games out there call a “panic situation.” Roughly, you want to leave \nat least two months’ lead time, preferably more (I try give a writer a month for each 20,000 \nwords of her assignment, although occasionally crises necessitate Herculean efforts to get \nthings in with little or no room to maneuver), before the first draft of a book is due, let alone \nthe final draft that goes into development. On a short book, like a Clanbook, you can fudge \nthings a little bit. On a longer book, you’re generally in trouble with less than three months’ \nlead time. O n  a huge book, like one over 200 pages, you need to set things rolling way in \nadvance or you’re liable to end up with a manuscript that is a.) too short, b.) written in fluent \nTagalog because your author burned out 47,000 words in and started typing with his nose, \nor c.) eaten by the cosmic ducks in transit. (Note: This third option is a polite yet delightfully \nwhimsical way of saying “never actually got written.”) \nFor those of you playing along with the home game, The Shining Host was a big, big \nbook. In other words, I was screwed. \nOr at least I would have been, if not for the intrepid, talented and entirely too eager \nPeter Woodworth, who had read the submissions guidelinesfor Mind’s Eye and decided that \na good old three-page submission wasn’t good enough for him. No, by gum, he was going to \nsend in his entire rules system for live-action Changeling for me to look at, and he was going \nto make sure I read every last word. Lucky for both of us that I was desperate, because the \npackage he finally sent was huge. \nI mean, I’d never seen a submission with a snow line on it. Acres of trees died to make \nthe paper for this thing. Two intems got hernias lugging it from the mail table. Mules gave \nup and died in the traces trying to haul it back to my office. I still had an office back then, \ninstead of a cubicle the color of the slime moldsrunning their own little Daytona 500 around \nthe inside of the company fridge, if that tells you how long ago this all was. \nAnd because I was able to scrape the last few pennies out of my karmic piggy bank, the \nsubmission was good. Perfect? Naaah - \nnothing’s perfect, as alt.games.whitewolf con- \nstantly reminds me. But did it have potential? Certainly. Could it be made universal in the \ntime we had! With a little luck, it could indeed. There was hope after all. \n(Side note: Peter is the sort of guy who makes me sick. I found out, after calling him \nup with a contract in hand, that he was all of 17. He’d written the whole kit and caboodle \nwhile attending high school, and he’d done it with a good prose style, an eye toward rules \nbalance and a healthy sense of humor. When I was his age, I was composing “Dear Sir, I \nalways thought the letters in your magazine were fiction until that night when I was viciously \nambushed by three voluptuous cheerleaders and a dancing bear” letters for publication, and \nanything longer than four pages was a moral victory. To make matters worse, he’s charming, \npolite, punctual and professional. Disgusting, ain’t it?) \nSo, the long and short of it is that, eventually, we got a book. It went through the usual \nplaytesting, editing, screaming, howling and gibbering phases that every book goes through, and \nit hit the shelves eventually. That, needless to say, is when the funny stuff started happening. \nBy funny stuff, I mean “weird even by the standards of this comer of this particularly \nunbalanced field of literary endeavor,” which is to say, pretty dam weird. Oh, there was the \nusual tug-of-war back and forth on the newsgroups (“I love it!” “I hate it!” “Duck season!” \n“Wabbit season! ”) and the usual hail of criticisms (some of which were warranted, and some \nof which weren’t), but there was also a significant undercurrent from folks talking about \nwhat they did at their Changeling LARPs. They didn’t stake the prince in the hallway three \ntimes before anyone brought out snacks. They did, however, have a lot of fun dressing to the \nnines and cutting loose - \nand they brought their kids. \n"

      "text": "That was important for me. As much fun as Vampire LARP is and as much as I enjoy \nit, it’s not the sort of place I’d ever feel comfortable taking my hypothetical children to hang \nout. Too much of the underlying dynamic is simply nasty - \nnot in the sense that the \ngameplay itself is nasty, but let’s face it. We’re talking about pretending to be a bunch of \npredators circling the same bloody half-pound of chuck roast in the water. That’s not \nnecessarily kid-friendly. \nThe Shining Host, on the other hand, is about wonder, at least to an extent. \nOccasionally, the game itself demands that you do something without an agenda, you have \nsome fun, you be creative for a bit. Mind you, it doesn’t have to be that way - \nif you want \nto run a Shadow Court game, more power to you. But it strikes me as a good thing that \nparents feel good about bringing their small children to Changeling LARPs and that those \ngames are perceived as safe, healthy places for those kids to be. \nYeah. Great. Whatever, right? What does that matter in the grand scheme of things? \nIt matters a lot, I think. By allowing folks to bring their kids along for a day of gaming, The \nShining Host opens up LARPing to people who might otherwise not have been able to do \nso. It’s one hell of a thing to try to find a sitter who’ll take care of Vlad Jr. until the local \nCamarilla game wraps up at 3 2 8  AM, let me tell you, and on-site vampiric daycare is pretty \ndifficult to come by. (No, this is not a suggestion; the insurance issues alone boggle the \nmind.) If you ask me, getting more people out there and playing, regardless of system, is a \npositive thing. \nAnd all of this brings me - \nby roads as roundabout as the highway that snakes down \nMt. Pisgah - \nto the topic mentioned in the title of the column: namely, why it’s good to \nbe an elf in a barn. \nRecently, I (along with the inimitable Jess Heinig -Go ahead. Try to nimit him. I dare \nyou.) had the pleasure of attending KarmaCon in Asheville, North Carolina. Yes, it was \nheld in a barn - \nwell, an Agricultural Center - \nand yes, there was a paint horse show \n(whatever that is) going on in the corral and large barns across the way. The convention was \nsmall, with all of the activities crammed into the livestock auction building. Still, it was an \nenergetic small con, with a healthy gaming track, a friendly and courteous con staff, a \nsurprisingly profitable charity auction and a LARP. Hoo boy, did they have a LARP. \nLet me preface this next section by saying that it is not for the faint of heart, the easily \noffended or anyone who believes that live action roleplaying begins and ends on the end of \na clove cigarette. What we’re about to dive into, ladies and germs, is the dreaded Elves In \nA Barn game. \n(Or, as noted by the inestimable David Bolack, a case of Barns and Nobles. Send the \nhate mail to me, and I’ll forward it to him.) \nBy all rights, the game shouldn’t have worked. Included in gameplay were, among other \nthings, a batch of Marauders who thought they were superheroes, a flying saucer, a \nbackwoods hick troll named Clem who worked for another changeling named J.R. (and yes, \nthe poor sumbitch did get shot so that everyone could ask “Who shot J.R.?” If you don’t get \nthat joke, you’re too young to be reading this.), an over-amorous cow and a six-year old \nUnseelie princess who got very annoyed when no one came to rescue her at various points \nduring the weekend. In other words, it was a mess.

Folks just go; their \ncharacters, got hit over the head occasionally with assorted plot developments and had fun. \nAnd that, in the end, is why it’s a good thing to be an elf in a barn, or anywhere else, \nfor that matter. Not everyone digs the totally immersive roleplaying experience or needs the \npillars of Heaven to shake every time they play Rock-Paper-Scissors. Sometimes the best \ngame for a situation is low powered and freeform, and the hell with all the grand and glorious \nangst for a while. Come on, seriously, do you really think that a high-powered Masquerade \ngame, with elders and Machiavellian plots, would have worked terribly well in a livestock \nauction building? As good as you, I, or anyone might be at imagining the surroundings to \nbe other than what they are, there are times when you just have to go with what reality gives \nyou - \nand in this case, reality gave us straw, dirt and a faint, absurd whiff of horse. Trying \nto overcome the solid reality of the game’s surroundings would have taken too much effort, \nleaving too little energy for the game. \nAnd so, what we had was perfect for what we had. If the surroundings were a little bit \nwonky (and even the con staff admitted that things were a little goofier than they might \nhave expected), then we got a game that played up that attitude perfectly. Would things \nhave worked half so well were we not playing live action Changeling? Of course not :each \nsystem has its own strengths, but neither Laws of the Night’s nor Laws of the WildOs nor \nOblivion’s nor anything else’s rules play explicitly to the sort of wide-open, over the top \nfreedom that a Changeling LARP does. \nSo what’s today’s moral? Well, mainly it’s some sort ofmuttering about how picking the \nright game for the right circumstances generally leads to more fun for all concerned. \nReligiously strict adherence to a single system, no matter how much you love it, can force \nyou into some awkward gaming situations. Let’s face it, do you really want to try to convince \nthe local 900 year old Toreador to try to hang out in a barn for the duration of a weekend? \n(“What is that I just stepped in, Alfonse?” “Cow poopoo, mistress.” “Can we make art out \nof it?” “Sadly, no, mistress.”“Aieeeeeee!”) And let’s not even think about Apocalypse.. .(“Bad \ndog! Stay in the barn until you learn how to behave in the house! Stay!”). \nSo, in the end, if the hand you’re dealt calls for you to be an elf in a barn (or anywhere \nelse suitable, for that matter), well, take what you’re given and run with it. You might \nsurprise yourself by having one hell of a good time, whether you want to or not. \n(Oh, and for you filthv-mindedsouls who read all this way to find out about the ZOOM! \nI \n"

The idea at the time was to expand Kindred of the East into a full line, \ncovering all of the mysteries of Asiatic vampires. I’d develop four books each year, \nand I’d also work as a co-developer for Vampire, handling maybe two additional core \nbooks per year. Since I liked Vampire, loved Kindred of the East and had a \nbackground in martial arts, Japanese history and Chinese culture, the idea seemed \nperfect at the time. \nA few development outlines later, we (meaning White Wolf) came to the \nconclusion that live-action games needed better treatment. To whit, Rich Dansky \nhad developed the last few MET books in addition to his usual development \nschedule for Wraith and anything else that needed the help. Now, Rich is no mere \nmortal, so he actually managed the Herculean task of pushing out quality Mind’s Eye \nTheatre books while working full-time on another line. Still, it had become clear \nthat the live-action game line needed a separate developer, someone to pay \nattention to the rapidly changing culture and rules. \nSilly me. I volunteered. \nWell, Kindred of the East got shuffled around to keep the books in develop- \nment, and I wound up with a new hat. Just when I got my business cards all printed \nwith “Kindred of the East Developer,” I changed over to working full-time on \nMind’s Eye Theatre. My first job: Salvage the manuscript of Laws of the Hunt, \nwhich was running late, short and choppy. \n“No problem,” I thought to myself. “I’ve always loved live-action, and I ran a \ngame of over 200 players. This can’t be any tougher than that.” \n"

However, it needed a \nlittle push to fulfill that potential. So I tossed in some advanced True Faith. The old \nmaterial from Antagonists was, frankly, difficult to understand and of limited utility \nbeyond its basic powers, so I brushed up the various groups of hunters, giving them \neach a distinctive feel and a unique set of advantages. Next came equipment: Here, \nI pulled in all sorts ofnew ideas and material that had never been formalized, because \nhunters need all the combat tools they can get. I converted all of the Numina to a \n“two Basic, two Intermediate, one Advanced” power format (the uneven power \nprogressions from early MET books really get on my nerves). I even found time to \nadd to the Merits and Flaws section, sneaking in rules on the creation of ghouls, \nKinfolk and kinain characters with detailed character generation guidelines and \nspecial powers. (“What the heck,” I figured. “Liber des Goules didn’t have any \nExperience tables or Trait maxima, so I might as well address that.”) \nFrotn the base material by John Wick and Alison Young, I managed to draw out \na pretty dam good book. I even had a section that allowed games to update to the \nrules in Laws of the Hunt, so that players can avoid oversights from previous editions \nlike the famous “I spend Willpower to automatically win the Simple Test for staking \nyou, Mr. Vampire Elder.” I wrote in some controlled Military and Espionage \nInfluence, talked about the very cool Benandanti and managed some long-awaited \nupdates to mass combat, Willpower defense and retesting rules. Not bad for my first \nMET book! \nThen, ofcourse, came editing. The book wound up too long. Some of the powers \ncropped up with problems at the last second. The Dauntain had to go completely \nbecause there was no room and no time to develop them (don’t worry, they show up \nin a later MET book). \nMiracle of miracles, we managed to push the book to 184 pages (Heaven smiles \nupon our production staff), and it actually got edited and put out on time. The \nresponse was overwhelming: We brought 96 copies to a convention, and we sold out \nof them in an hour and a half. That’s a copy a minute. Wearing a big goofy grin, I \nsigned each one. \nWell! That wasn’t so bad. Pushing up my sleeves, I waded into the next project: \nThe Savage West (you’ll have seen it now as Laws of the Wyld West). I also got \nhanded the opportunity to start up the Mind’s Eye Journal, and I was looking at \nfuture releases- a follow-up to Laws of the Hunt, maybe some Kindred of the East \nlive-action and even (shudder) live-action Mage. \nThen, the Crash. \nWe all knew that the game market had been performing poorly. As a result, \nWhite Wolf had to reorganize. Several beloved members of the production, \ndevelopment, marketing and fiction departments wound up moving on to new jobs. \nAll of the development staff was in a frenzy, nobody knew who would get what job \nand the schedule flew into chaos. \nFinally, word came down that the staff had been cut considerably. New \npositions were to be assigned. I waited, barely able to breathe, for news of my new \nposition. Phil Brucato, developer of Mage for five years, had left the company, and \nhe’d picked me to succeed him! \n"

And that’s why you’re not going to find a picture \nof me here. I not only develop the games, I’m a player, and I find anonymity best \nsuited to such pastimes.

Beware, fame- \nseekers - \nI write your kind into the books for the purposes of killing them in new \nand interesting ways. So behave - \nafter all, you never know where I may show up. \nI’m the sort of player who believes in the statement, “Rules schmules; gimme \nstory!”, and I take much the same approach to MET. I’m aware that rules are \nnecessary to keep things running, but I tend to slack off making rules regarding every \nlittle detail. Hey, it’s your story, after all.

Having dealt with the press \nand disapproving public up close and personal on various occasions (such as the \nWendorff case) and endured the reign of terror that a single power player wreaked \non a chronicle, I want MET to be a game everyone can continue to enjoy. That \nmeans I’ll do what’s necessary to empower Storytellers to put the smackdown on \nmisbehaving players, talk to a curious parent or handle the Weekly World News. \nAnd in response to that inevitable question, my mother greets news of my work and \nleisure with the same bemusement that Buffy’s mother does when her daughter goes \nout slaying for the night. \nWhen I’m not LARPing, I’m sewing (which, nine times out of 10, is some \ncostume for LARPing), birdwatching, studying Middle Eastern dance, reading, \ncooking, walking or doing something related to my two cats. \nAnd that is what is worth talking about for now. \nTake care, \nCynthia Summers \n"

Does the phrase “mercurialpooka trickster” make you \nwant to retch? If so, read on. These fae are the scum underneath the bottom of \nthe barrel, but worse, they don’t mind that one bit. They revel in their base, \nUnseek nature. Sound like fun? If it does, you’re twisted, vile and sick. \nWelcome, brother! \nNOTICE! \nThe following material is restricted to players and Storytellers who wish to include \nthe twisted members of the Shadow Court, the true embodiment of all that is Unseelie, \ninto their chronicles. All the Dark Arts, Thallain Kith, Unseelie Houses and new \nBackgrounds required to completely flesh out a Shadow Court character are, therefore, \nprovided. However, the transformation from a mere Unseelie to a member of the Shadow \nCourt is not so easy or so simple as marking a character sheet, and the White Wolf \nsourcebook The Shadow Court for Changeling: The Dreaming should be consulted \nin detail to fully realize the descent into darkness which accompanies the initiation into \nand advancement in this mysterious, ancient organization. In many ways, the Shadow \nCourt is the regular Kithain’s equivalent of the Sabbat - \nthough that’s a loose similarity, \nat best -- and it should only be created when players are ready and able to attempt the \nradical transition between fantasy and utter nightmare. Again, making a Shadow Court \ncharacter is not as simple as circling the Unseelie Legacy on your character sheet! Players \nare therefore advisednot to planonusing any of this information, or evennecessarily being \nallowed to read it, in any given chronicle, so unless thou be a Storyteller or have consulted \none first, go ye no further. It should be obvious by now that no characters outside the \nShadow Court possess any of the following powers or advantages (or are of the Thallain \nkith), and very, very few outside the Shadow Court have more than the tiniest bit of \nknowledge concerning any of the material below.

They are believed to have appeared only after the return ofthe sidhe in 1969, riding \nthe same wave from Arcadia, but from the other side of the tracks. They are physically \nindistinguishable from regular members of their “parent” kiths - \nif somewhat disgusting \n- \nbut they display very different Birthrights and Frailties. They also tend to express \nshocking thoughts and behavior patterns, even compared to their regular Unseelie \ncounterparts. They are thus used by the Shadow Court as secret weapons and closet allies. \nThey are assigned to cliques for specific and important reasons and they will not in any case \nbe found just wandering around. \nNote: Because they are so tainted by Nightmare, Thallain have no Seelie Legacies, \nand they can never get any.

And yet, these things’ terrifying appearence is but the \nslightest glimmer of the vile, deadly depravity that infests their dark hearts. \nAffinity: Nature \nBirthrights: \nBeastie Form: Like pooka, beasties can change into their monster forms while no \none is looking by spending 10 seconds of game time and a point of Glamour.

This \ndistortion has no effect on Awakened creatures. \nFrailties: \nThe Hunt: All Seelie Kithain have an innate hatred of beasties, and they must \nmake a self-control check (usually a Static Mental or Social Challenge, with its \ndifficulty based on the nature of the scene - \nharder in times of conflict, easier in \npeacetime) to avoid attacking one on sight. If the Static Challenge fails, the character \nmay spend a Willpower Trait to avoid attacking, and its effects last for the rest of the \nscene.

Such devices (be they exploding, glass-filled \nteddy bears or fishing rods that double as ranged cattle prods) are inherently flawed in \nsome way, but that makes them no less dangerous. \nAffinity: Prop \nBirthrights: \nMayhem: At the beginning of each story, a goblin can create a device capable of \nunleashing mayhem.

Additionally, they must choose two permanent Negative Mental \nTraits, whichcannever be bought off, from the following list: Ignorant, Oblivious, Violent, \nShortsighted, Predictable, Gullible or Witless. \nN e w BAC \n~ c j  \nR O  u N D s \nThough the Shadow Court doesn’t recognize regular titles, it does have its own \nhierarchy, and many of its agents hold titles in the regular Concordian system, making \nit easier to spy on the Seelie and disrupt their proceedings. Thus, it is very possible to \npossess a high level of the Title Background in the regular court and very little Prestige \nin the Shadow Court or vice versa. The dangers of leading such a double life are obvious \nif the character is caught, but the rewards can be beyond imagining. And if you can’t \ntake risks, what are you doing on the dark side anyway? \nPRESTIC~F \nThe Shadow Court doesn’t recognize official titles, but it is possible to gain Prestige \nwithin the court. Trying to hold on to power and responsibility is seenas asking for trouble, \nbut stepping down occasionally is seen as a gesture of humility. A courtier probably doesn’t \nknow who stands more than one or two levels above her station, but she’d be foolish to \nexploit anyone below her. Prestige does not last longer than one year; if a changeling \ndoesn’t get promoted at Samhain, he loses at least one level of Prestige for the next year. \nIn fact, the court is always changing, and there’s no guarantee that a changeling can keep \nthis status beyond the first few sessions. It is a gocd indicator, however, of the level of \nrespect the character commands. Consider it your reputation, for better or worse. \nPrestige x 1: Condemned. You are firmly entrenched in the Shadow Court and \npermitted to learn secrets like the Dark Arts. You have forsaken your former life, even \ngiven a chance to return. If you do not have this level of the Background when play begins, \nT H E  S H A D O W  C O U R T  \ne \n"

Within your territory, you watch over an important location, \nanything from a freehold or glen to a gun store or chemical lab. You keep the various needs of \nlocal cliques supplied, and in turn, they respect your turf and protect your goods as best they can. \nPrestige x 3: Pretender. You hold a title within the Seelie or Unseelie Court, at least \nthat of knight or squire. This title gives you at least one level in the Title Background, as \nwell as a possible double life and the risk of being dealt with harshly if you’re caught. \nHowever, because you’re such a valuable informant, even anarchist cliques tend to leave \nyou be, giving you time to gather dirt on those above you as you rise to power in both courts. \nPrestige x 4: Mastermind. Certainly not everyone who plots and schemes has this \nlevel of Prestige, but changelings who have achieved it have literally made an art out \nof intrigue, and they tend to be visited often by Instigators in need of information. You \nare involved in a secret society of at least five members that trades favors freely. This \nclandestine involvement gives you three free levels of Influence (see Backgrounds) that \nyoucanuse (primarily Legalor Finance, but the Storyteller may modify this choice based \non the type and power of the society). You also receive regular rumor updates, and thus \nthe Storyteller usually has a few choice bits of dirt, in the form of gossip and other \nscurrilous sources you know well, for you when you begin a session. \nPrestige x 5: Instigator. You recruit others into the Shadow Court, although you \ncannot condemn them without learning the Advanced Contempt Art of Condemnatim. \nSlowly, you’re learning more about the hidden secrets of the court, and at least two cliques \nbrief you regularly on their activities. When you gather at least five Kithain for rituals, the \ndifficulty for outsiders to observe and discern the nature of the gathering rises by two (a two- \nTrait penalty on any related Challenges). If captured, you are expected to die rather than \ndivulge secrets, and ifyou are unwilling to do so, you will either be rescued or killed quickly \nby your fellows (have a nice afterlife). There are always Instigators more powerful than you, \nas well, who can overrule your authority, and if you begin to act as if you rule the cliques \nthat come to you, the backlash can be very nasty. As a function ofstation, you have at least \ntwo Masterminds working for and beneath you, although they are not your retainers and \nthey will not tolerate being treated as such. \nHOUSES \nAlthough these three Houses are certainly not the only options from which \nUnseelie fae may choose, they are the true Unseelie bloodlines and the only noble \nHouses yet found that lie squarely in the Unseelie camp. Being part of the Shadow \nCourt is not necessary for being a member of one of these Houses, but it is strongly \nrecommended, particularly for House Ailil and House Balor. Of course, commoners \nwho are affiliated with the House do not receive either the Boon or the Flaw of the \nHouse, just like the Seelie Houses. In no case will a character who is primarily Seelie \nbe from one of these families, although it is not impossible for anunseelie of one of these \nHouses to repent and become Seelie later in life. \nH O US E  AILIL \nThe sidhe of House Ailil -The House of Honeyed Words and Serpents’ Tongues \n-are \nrenowned for their Machiavellian plotting and firm belief in their own inherent \nsuperiority.

They often promise \ncommoner equality, but they have no intention of pursuing it if their goals are met. \nMembers of this House are known for their dark hair and eyes, their compelling gazes \nand their choice of attire as black as the midnight lords they serve.

They receive the Social Trait: \nBeguiling free, and they receive one free retest on all Subterfuge and Leadership Challenges. \nFlaw: Changelings belonging to House Ailil tend to believe too much in their fitness \nto rule, and they will take on tasks based on the belief that the virtue of their bloodline will \nallow them to succeed.

They also must take the \npermanent Negative Social Trait: Condescending, which can never be bought off. \nH O U S E  BALOR \nThough others have forgotten, the sidhe of House Balor remember the time when \nsidhe mixed blood with Fomorians back in the Old Country - \nthey are the descendants \nof such unions. As such, members of House Balor bear some kind of deformity, be it \nphysical, mental, emotional or spiritual, and they bear bitter hatred toward their perfect \ncousins of the other houses. House Balor believes that the Endless Winter is almost here \nand that, if they can bring it on, they will be the ones chosen to lead the others during the \ndark times. This fatalism leads to many Balor becoming anarchists, but the ones who see \nbeyond such limited actions become dangerous fanatics with almost animal cunning. \nChangelings of this House also flirt with alliances with such Prodigals as Black Spiral \nDancerGarouand themodernday Fomori, and they delight inplayingwithironandother \nthings repulsive to changelings in general. Freeholds ruled by those of House Balor tend \nto be brutal domains in which everyone is out to get their own and keep it safe from the \nencroachments of others, very similar to the domain of wild animals. \nBoon: The sidhe of House Balor do not suffer from Banality’s Curse, the Frailty \nof most sidhe. In fact, they can handle cold iron without suffering any penalties, and \nthey lose no Glamour when struck by iron. This Boon allows them to carry and use iron \nweapons without penalties. If slain by iron, however, their soul is just as destroyed as \nany other changeling’s. \nFlaw: All of this House must take some kind of serious deformity or handicap, which \ncannot be rectified through prosthetics, psychological help, cantrips or treasures. Players \nare encouraged to work with the Storyteller to come up with strange and bizarre \ndeformities and to think beyond mere physical grossness to the possibilities ofhaving more \npoetic deformities like being born utterly without a conscience. Unlike the namesake of \nthe House and his evil eye, however, this deformity gives these changelings no special \npowers. Note: Members of House Balor must take either two permanent Negative Traits \nor a Derangement of some type, which can never be bought off, related to their deformity. \nIfthedeformity isrepresentedbyanexistingFlaw, they may take the Flaw, but they neither \nreceive compensation for it nor can they buy it off.

Freeholds ruled by this House tend to be places of great art but greater \ntragedy, with many avant-garde forms mixing with traditional works, and the mortals \ntend to be recycled quite often as the house’s infamous Glamour-hunger strikes. \nBoon: All members of House Leanhaun receive the Social Trait: Seductive, \nwhich can never be permanently lost, for free, and they are two Traits up on any \nChallenge during which they bid a Trait related to appearance or sex appeal. Flaw: \nLeanhaun age at a rate of one year per week unless they engage in Rhapsody at least \nonce during each week. This aging can be reversed and make the sidhe young again, \nbut only with greater and greater infusions of Glamour, which do more and more harm \nto the mortal being Rhapsodized. They also do not age gracefully and must take a \nNegative Physical Trait), which can only be bought off by changing back to a younger \nstate, each time they change seemings (childling, wilder, grump). \nDARK \nARTS \nThe following powers are Arts known only by members of the Shadow Court; \nalthough some have toyed with the idea of allowing outsiders to learncontempt as a way \nof undermining the sidhe nobility, no one is allowed to take this debate past the realm of \ntheory yet. After all, these Arts are the result of 600 years of secrecy and practice, and the \nShadow Court is in no hurry to lose its edge now with a hasty gamble. \nCONTEMPT \nThough Unseelie nobles have been known to use the Sovereign Art, some have \nchosen instead to counter it using their knowledge of the Art ofcontempt. Commoners \nhave also found it very useful when avoiding the dictates of the fascist Seelie sidhe, and \nit is true that this Art counters the effects of Sovereign on almost a one-for-one basis \n(with the exception of Weaver Ward, which is countered by Wayfare instead), which \ncauses rulers no end of frustration. \nType of Challenge: Mental \nArt Note: Though many uses of this Art invoke feelings ofbitter resentment and even \nviolence against traditional authority, players must still respect the rules of live-action and \nnot actually harm anyone or anything - \nthe “no touch” rule applies to one and all, even \n(especially) municipal buildings or classrooms that may be the targets of Contempt. In \naddition, unless the game is taking place in private, where everyone knows what’s going on, \nremember to keep your voices low and your language clean enough to avoid being given a \nticket or the boot from your locale. Finally, no use of Contempt can ever make the players \nrevolt out of character against the Storyteller (nice try, guys)! \nBasic \nMockery: This Art allows a changeling to directly avert the effects of Protocol from either \nherself or others, as the Realms used dictate. Once the Protocol is about to finish its casting, the \ncharacter casting Mockery must engage in a Mental Challenge with the person casting Protocol \nin addition to performing a Bunk - \nsuccess indicates immunity to the effects for the duration \nof the proceedings. The caster is considered anumber ofTraits up equal to the level ofthe Bunk. \nNote that the person Challenged will not necessarily know who is attempting Mockery unless \nthe Bunk performed is so obvious that they can put one and one together right away. This Art \nallows for a wide range of normally unacceptable behavior on the part of the changeling, from \nimmediate duels to grandstanding and interrupting the monarch. However, most fae will not \nsee anything odd in this, as the caster, after all, is almost always publicly Unseelie anyway. If \nMockery is cast without intent to counter Protocol, it becomes instead a twisted version of said \nmagic, allowing for a barbarian court of Unseelie law. Essentially, the ruler is allowed martial \nlaw over the changelings present, including Seelie fae and other bystanders. \n"

Note that a fae can only attempt one of these cantrips at the beginning \nof the proceedings; any later and the cantrip will fail. \nDisobedience: An individual affected by this cantrip will show flagrant disregard for \nauthority for the remainder of the scene. It will not cause anyone affected to assault authority \nfigures physically, but it may result in acts of violence if the individual feels that he is being \nput down by the Man, so to speak. Once this cantrip has been cast, logical arguments seem \nhollow, and warnings or dictums against certain behavior seem offensive. Because so many \npeople in the modem world harbor such resentment, the target may only cancel the effect \nwith a Willpower Trait if this cantrip is successfully cast. If a noble is nearby, this cantrip may \nbe used to counteract the Basic Sovereign power, Dictum- the character must take his target \naside and give her a few choice words of encouragement about her rights (roleplay this out \nto the fullest), followed by the casting of the cantrip. The level of the Bunk used in the casting \nis added to the target’s Traits for the purposes of resisting Dictum, and this power allows the \ntarget to spend Willpower to ignore the effects of Dictum even if she would not be allowed \nto do so normally. At the Storyteller’s discretion, this cantrip may be used to counter powers \nof Prodigals (vampiric Presence or certain Garou Gifts, for example) in a similar fashion. \nRealms: Actor and Fue are most useful, but inventive revolutionaries can find ways \nto utilize the other three. \nIntermediate \nInsolence: Insolence can be used to inspire large groups of people to riot. This \npower is useful when emotions are already hot and heavy (like raves, rock concerts and \nlynchings). For each level of Bunk used, one person can be goaded into attacking \nsomeone or something else (unfortunately, you can’t decide exactly what the target will \nbe!). Anyone targeted can spend a Willpower Trait to enter into a Mental Challenge \nwith the caster (no Traits risked) to avoid these effects. This cantrip can also be used \nto negate the Sovereign power ofGrandeur. Only one Shadow Court fae can attempt this \nper scene, however, and if he fails, you’re all screwed. If used to counteract Grandeur, \nthe fae must make some remark or take some action that would detract from the \nseriousness of the noble’s power, then cast the cantrip. Each Bunk Trait gained allows \none person present to make a Simple Test against the user of Grandeur, with success \nmeaning that the target is immune to all uses of Grandeur for the rest of the session. \nRealms: Determines who will riot or what will be rioted against by the affected parties. \nDevil’s Advocate: A fae using this magic can convince a crowd of just about \nanything for one scene, after which the affected parties may realize what has happened \nto them (though only Awakened beings will realize that anything \noccurred). Instead of a normal Bunk, however, the character must make a speech \nexplaining the position he wants the crowd to take. After that, the fae must spend a \nWillpower Trait and make a Static Mental Challenge against a difficulty equal to one for \nevery two people he wishes to affect. This limit can be made one per every three with the \nexpenditure of an additional Willpower Trait. If the changeling is successful, the crowd \ncan be convincedof almost anything the character desires, and it will remain so convinced \nfor one hour of game time. This magic may also be used to counter aGem cantrip cast by \na noble. If the Unseelie is present at such a casting, he may use this Art (once again, with \na speech about why the Gem should be reconsidered) to try to make the noble reconsider. \nDoing so doesn’t absolutely cancel a Gem, but it does at least buy time. \nRealms: Actor and Fae are the only way to use the first part of this magic. \nAdvanced \nCondemnation: This magic is the unholy ritual of the Shadow Court, and it is always \nused in elaborate ceremony, as it defines an individual’s prestige in the Court. At Samhain, \nonly a few people, called Instigators, are considered worthy of learning this magic.

Unseelie \nchangelings hide in a fog of doubts and uncertainties, of half-truths and insecurities. \nPerhaps the world recognizes that there must be a balance to all things and that the great \nevil of the Shadow Court would tip the already suffering world completely out ofbalance. \nType of Challenge: Social \nBasic \nInnocence: Hiding secrets and faces is a valuable ability, and this Art allows the Shadow \nCourt to plant agents with secrets foul and hideous among their ever-trusting Seelie brethren. \nThe simplest way to keep a secret, of course, is to act like you have no knowledge of it \nwhatsoever. This Dark Art masks any outward signs of recognition regarding one particular \ntopic or secret, making it extremely difficult for others to pry this secret from the character or \neven detect that he has it. The way it works is quite simple - \non all Challenges related to \nkeeping the secret, the character is up a number ofTraits equal to the number of Bunk Traits \ngained in the cantrip casting. Thus, if someone is using a SdmjLge Challenge to try to break \nyour character with interrogation, and you cast a three Bunk Trait Innocence cantrip, you are \nup three Traits on the Social Test required for the interrogation. This effect lasts for one day \nor night, and it must be renewed each interval to be effective. Note: The aura of a character \nusing this Art appears innocent to characters using Aura Perception and similar powers. \nFacade: This Dark Art allows the changeling to adopt a very effective disguise for a period \nof time, although her actual body doesn’t change, merely others’ perception of it. You must \nperform a Bunk related to changing your appearance (like wearing a mask, donning makeup or \nchanging clothes), then spend a Glamour Trait. The result is a disguise that lasts for one hour. \nThis time may be extended by expending an additional Glamour Trait per hour, but no more \nGlamour Traits may be spent this way than the number of Bunk Traits gained in casting the \ncantrip. If the disguise isn’t exceptionally hard to maintain (ooh, a video store clerk) or doesn’t \nencounter much strenuous activity, this time can be lengthened to one day per Glamour Trait, \nbut at the Storyteller’s discretion only. This disguise cannot be broken by powers like Heightened \nSenses (because it fools witnesses’ minds, not their physical perceptions); only someone who is \nactively suspicious of you for some reason or another may attempt to pierce the disguise, and he \nmust defeat you in a Challenge of his Mental Traits against your Social Traits. No matter what, \nyou can never adopt the same Facade twice. Other Realms may be used in connection to this \ncantrip as the caster sees fit. Using the Prop Realm might mean the disguise lasts as long as the \ncharacter holds a particular item, whereas Scene would dictate where the disguise can be adopted. \nIntermediate \nMists of Memory: The Mists are not always as objective as the Seelie would like \nthem to be. A disreputable fae may manipulate the Mists to cloud the minds of others \nand banish specific memories, but this Dark Art can never overcome certain things like \nthe loyalty of a troll, the chivalry of asidhe, an oath, a geas or true love. The caster must \nengage the target in a Social Challenge that, if successful, allows her to remove a broad \narea of memory determined by the number of Bunk Traits gained in casting, as \ndetermined by the following scale: \n1 Trait: memory of what was said in the last 15 minutes \n2 Traits: all memory of what happened in the last 15 minutes \n"

(“You must take this to the duke. It’s important.”) \nIn addition to any other Bunk used, the cantrip must include an explanation of why the \nactivity is important (this does not need to be true, but it must be believable), which \ntakes at least five minutes of game time. If the listener is still willing, he must do it; if \nhe wishes to resist, he must spend a Willpower Trait to do so. Once the activity is \nperformed, the Mists erase all memory of it from the target’s mind (like vampiric \nMesmerism from Laws of the Night). \nAdvanced \nThe Darkest Heart: This power is as serious as Geas, and it is not undertaken lightly. \nSome undertake it of their own free will, whereas others (like weak Seelie) are condemned and \nforced into it.

Sensing a subject \nfor the MET Journal, I’ve been taking notes on the different types ofproblem players \nmy friends and fellow garners have encountered, with an eye toward how to mitigate \ntheir negative (if unintentional) influence. After many cups of coffee, these \ncategories made the best of the worst. \nCOMBAT \nMONSTER \na.k.a. Twink, C ~ ~ ~ S U W ,  \nPoint-&-Click \nThe Combat Monster tends to be the by far most common type of problem player. \nThe typical goal of a Combat Monster is to build the strongest, fastest and most \ninvulnerable character in the chronicle. In his world, problems are best solved in a flurry \nof Celerity and Potence; he has little time for political maneuvering. If left unchecked, \nthe Combat Monster can turn a chronicle into the monster of the week special. \nThis is not to say that all characters with Physical Traits primary are Combat \nMonsters; most are not. The distinction lies in how the player portrays his character. \nIf he tends to run roughshod over other players and Storytellers just for the thrill of \ncrushing, breaking and stomping anything in his path, chances are he’s a Combat \nMonster. If you look into the world of a physical character’s motivation and find a \nvast, arid desert, those chances get even better. \nThere are several ways to handle a Combat Monster. The easiest one is to create \nopponents who can beat him at the physical game. Doing so has the advantage of \nshowing the player’s character that there are things in the World of Darkness that \ncan defeat even him; however, it tendsnot to teach him (or his player) anything. The \nTougher Bad Guys tactic usually backfires when the player decides that he needs to \nbeefup his character’s Disciplines or Abilities to defeat this new threat. You’re then \nleft with a virtual arms race that has the potential to lay waste to the chronicle’s plot \n(and its characters). \n"

      "text": "Anoi.her way to control on the Combat Monster is to find a way to pair him with \na Storyteller character who is primarily a social or political figure. Typically, this \ntrick takes the form of making the physical character a bodyguard for the Storyteller \ncharacter (“I heard you’re the baddest SOB this side of the international date line; \nI need somebody like that in my organization.”), but it’s not the only way. Suggesting \nthat he be moved into a position of law enforcement within the game could easily \npair him with investigators and judges working to uphold the laws of their society, \nfor instance. This pairing tends to give Combat Monsters interaction with other \nplayers without undercutting the player’s usefulness as a physical powerhouse. \nFinally, a Storyteller can present the Combat Monster with problems that \ncannot be solved by brute force alone. Making him the target of a mysterious agency \nwith a hidden motive (like a cult, a government operation or a criminal ring) that \nmakes its moves from the shadows, for instance, forces the Twink to examine the \nsituation, determine why he’s such a star all of a sudden and possibly seek out \nassistance from other, less physically intensive characters. Again, this sort of idea \nredirects the Combat Monster’s enthusiasm and keeps the player happy while \nallowing you to refrain from tossing bad guy after bad guy mindlessly into the \nchipper-shredder that is his character. \nRULES LAWYER \na.k.a. Poindexter, Page Slave, Windbag \nEveryone who’s played live-action games (or any sort of roleplaying game) more \nthan a few times knows a Rules Lawyer. This is the guy who seems to have memorized \nevery line in the rule book (any rule book) and is quite happy to point this fact out \nwhen challenged on a call. He will tell anyone who cares to listen (or who is awake) \nthat he understands the letter of the rules and that, if you do not accept his \ninterpretation, you must be mistaken and should reread the rules until you come \naround. This type of player believes \nthat the most important aspect of the \ngame is strict adherence to the rules. \nThe rules are control. The rules are \npower.

Doing so helps cut down on misunderstandings, and it at \nleast gives Rules Lawyers the right rules to pore over. \nThe other problem Rules Lawyers cause is simple social annoyance.

Though the Journal isn’t exactly a resource for dealing with annoying \npersonalities, a helpful bit of advice in dealing with such a person is that it’s \nimportant to remember that even a Rules Lawyer has his positive side -namely, he \nknows his stuff. Therefore, this player can actually be an asset to the Storytellers. If \nhe shows that he understands the house rules and can be trusted not to make calls \nthat run counter to them, ask him to assist you in the role of a Narrator. That is, \npromote him so he’s not causing trouble at the grass-roots level and get him on your \nside. In doing so, you gain someone who understands the rules and can make the \ngame run more smoothly, and the player gets to demonstrate his grasp of the rules \nby helping to run scenes and challenges. \na.k.a. Knowitall, Guru, Oracle \nLOREMASTEE \nWhereas the Rules Lawyer seems to know the rules, the complete rules and \nnothing but the rules, the Loremaster seems to know everything about the setting \nof the World of Darkness, regardless of whether his character knows anything. This \nperson has probably bought every item ever published by White Wolf (even \nInphobia), and he is not afraid to let his character use any knowledge contained \ntherein. His character seems to be able to spout off details about creatures, events or \nAbilities that he has never come across in the course of your chronicle and about \nwhich his character history would have revealed nothing. (Alternatively, he could \nhave an impossibly outlandish charac- \nter history in which the great secrets of \nthe World of Darkness were revealed \nto him. You know that Gangrel in your \nchronicle who knows all about the \nBlack Spiral Dancers, Fomori and Banes \nJust because he “ran with the Garou for \nyears” before coming to your town? \nThat character is probably played by a \nLoremaster.) \nThis player presents a problem for \nany Storyteller who wishes to add a bit \nof mystery to a chronicle. Let’s face it: \nThere is nothing worse than introduc- \ning a mystery element (like a True \nBrujah or Siberakh) and havingachar- \nacter know all about it as soon as it \ncomes into play. \nFor the players, the Loremaster \nruins the game’s atmosphere and ten- \nsion because he robs them of the \nchallenge of finding clues and solving \n"

Loudly. \nThe easiest way to handle this problem is to establish a system of Lore levels (as \nJess Heinig has done on page XX of this issue of the Journal) and hold characters to \nthe amount ofknowledge eachlevel. Thus, if the Loremaster’scharacter does not have \nthe appropriate Lore, the character cannot utilize the player’s out of game knowledge. \nAn interesting way to handle this problem in game is to assign negative Status \nTraits (like Insane) to characters who spouts such unfounded information. If this \nbehavior continues despite the Trait penalty, nothing teaches a loud-mouth \nLoremaster to keep his “insights” to himself more effectively than having angry \nrepresentatives of the group whose secrets the character is spreading come calling. \nM I N - M A X E R  \na.k.a.

She believes that the stats on her sheet are \nthe true measure of her character’s growth, usefulness or longevity. If she spent half \nas much time fleshing out a history as she did with coming up with her stats, she \nwould have a well-rounded character, one she’d probably have loads more fun \nplaying and developing. Although the Min-Maxer’s preferred M.O. mimics the \nCombat Monster - \n“I need lots of Potence and Cekrity so 1 can do my Malkavian \npranks without fear” -you will also find such such derivatives as the Tremere Giga- \nRitualist, the Toreador Majesty Maven and the (ever-popular) Former Gangrel \nGhoul Recently Embraced by Clan Tremere. \nPlayers may have some problems dealing with Min-Maxers on the roleplaying \nlevel because of the Min-Maxer’s lack of character depth. There are few things worse \nthan trying to roleplay with a person who cannot tell you anything about her \ncharacter other than what Abilities she has or how many Traits she can bid. \nStorytellers also tend to have problems building plots for the Min-Maxer. It is \ndifficult to create gripping, meaningful situations for a character who does not have \nany sort of a past or any discernible motivations.

The Fudger’s usual target is a newbie, \nbecause more experienced players tend to recognize when he is fudging. \nThis type of problem player is the one which the Storyteller should be the most \nstrict. MET is a game system built on trust, and the Fudger violates that trust, \ndamaging the game for everyone involved. Take care in handling this type of player; \nreact too harshly, and you’ll lose a player (after all, most Fudgers either fudge by \naccident or out of a misguided desire to avoid breaking the flow of the story).

Replicants, Thelust-Us League \nWhereas most problem players are individuals, this type is a group. Clique \nClones tend to design characters that depend upon the pack mentality and sheer \nnumbers to accomplish their goals. Such a concept is not a problem in itself- it can \neven be an asset if the group works within the system to further the story - \nthings \ntend to get ugly if the group decides to work against other players or the flow of the \ngame for its own purposes. Rampant Clique Clones are the main ingredients in a \nrecipe for disaster - one that can turn an Elysium into a war zone. \nStorytellers should use their power to veto character concepts to control this \ntype of problem. If you have players who insist on linking concepts and histories and \nhave the potential to be Clique Clones, take extra caution in reviewing the \ncharacters. Help them develop their personal idiosyncrasies and motivations, and \ntake full advantage ofany loopholes in their linked histories. Such loopholes include \ncommon enemies, rivalries between members of the clique and exploiting the group \nmentality by holding the entire group responsible for the indiscretion of a single \nmember. By their very nature, Clique Clones will take up a good bit of a Storyteller’s \ntime, as it’s likely that they’ll encounter the majority of the plot hooks that are \npresented during a game. A wise Storyteller will realize this fact and try to ensure that \nplayers outside the clique have enough to do. \nREVENGERS \na.k.a. Inigo Montoyas, O’Barrs \nSo you lost your last character and you wanna take out the guy who did it, eh? \nDo you a.) work with friendly Storytellers to use your old contacts to eliminate the \nculprit, b.) start humming Que sera, sera and get a new character concept or c.) Make \na character who is the brother, sire or lover of your old character and take the SOB \nout yourself? Unless you chose B, welcome to your new incarnation as a Revenger. \nRevengers cause problems because they tend to have only one goal in their \ncharacter concept: the destruction of an offending character. When and if he \naccomplishes this goal, the Revenger often becomes one-dimensional and with- \ndrawn from the chronicle. \nThe Storyteller’s best option is to veto this type of character concept unless \nthere is a story-related reason for the concept - \na damn good one that would have \nexisted before the original character’s death became an issue. Even in such a case, \nyou might suggest that the revenge plot be handled from the Storyteller side by a \nStoryteller character played by a Narrator. This plot thread can be used to demon- \nstrate the fact that actions in the World of Darkness have consequences, while at the \nsame time heading off problems with player on player revenge at the same time. \nOtherwise, frankly, sometimes it’s okay to tell a sour player (one who’s likely to \nturn into a Revenger, that is) that his character died and that he should just get over \nit.

The \nfirst, the Freak of the Week, wants to play \nthe Tremere Anarch, the Ronin Get of \nFenrts or the Renegade Assamite (to name \na few choice concepts) not because it is an \nI interesting concept but because it sounds \ncool. He wants toplay something outside the \nestablished norm, but he may not be as \naccustomed to the downside of playing this \ncharacter type and may not understand why \nhis character is being targeted for destruc- \ntion by the Tremere or the Assamites (for \ninstance). The Freak of the Week can nor- \nmally be educated by a Storyteller or fellow \nplayer about why he might not want to \npursue his concept lightly. A good starting \npoint here is to give the player a copy of the \nclan/tribe/kith book so he understands the \nI I  \nproblems with the concept. This can save a \nplayer some trouble down the road. \nOne thing that should be made clear to the Rebel is that actions have \nconsequences. A rogue Tremere apprentice who spreads clan secrets to the entire \nknown world because he doesn’t like his superiors’ orders or a Brujah neonate who \nmouths off constantly to an elder may sound like an interesting concept at first. \nHowever, when the archon comes to call or the elder puts the neonate in torpor, the \nplayer needs to realize that his actions caused the reaction. \nThe more problematic Rebel is the one who has issues with authority figures in \nreal life and transfers these issues to the game. Examples of this type of character are \nthe ones who gossip about the Storyteller’s ability to be fair and impartial in her \nrulings, attempt to actively undermine the authority of the Storyteller or whine \nabout her decisions even if they are fair. \nWhen dealing with this type of Rebel, it is important to remain impartial and \ncalm. Losing your temper will just give a Rebel fuel for his gossip. \nThe last type of Rebel is the Plot Bomb. This person’s main goal in the chronicle \nis to break the plot and to wreak as much havoc as he can in doing so. This Rebel is \nthe worst by far, as he will go to any length to make the game unpleasant for the players \nwhile he searches for a way to break it. This type of Rebel appears most frequently in \none-shot or convention games in which his actions have no real consequences other \nthan ruining others’ enjoyment of the game. There are few ways to deal with a Plot \nBomb rationally because he does not usually have a logical reason for his behavior. \nYour best bet is to ask him to stop, then, if he doesn’t, ask him to leave. \nT H E  BROKEN \nRECORD \na.k.a.

Alternatively, you can make it clear that any information given to your \ncharacter by any means (aside from reading the sourcebooks) will be considered \ninformation that’s been garnered in game.

When shifted into their animalistic forms, \nwerewolves are powerful predators, but they retain a cunning instinct. You also \nbelieve that the bite of a werewolf may be sufficient to pass on its condition, but that \nthis does not always occur. Certain remedies, such as belladonna infusions, may help \nto delay or prevent the onset of lycanthropy contracted by a werewolf's bite. Of \ncourse, such potions are also poisonous. \nA werewolf in its animal form is always larger and stronger than normal, and its \nclaws and teeth are capable of rending flesh and bone with nearly equal ease. \nWerewolves can sometimes be told by specific marks and traits, but not all \nwerewolves exhibit all of those physical aberrations.

In any case, werewolves retain at least some \nintelligence in all of their forms, so they can be dangerously clever wolves or \npredatorial humans. They disdain technology, living primitively even among \nhuman society. A werewolf is difficult to capture, though, because people often \nforget when they have seen a werewolf enraged. \nYou know that werewolves have some means of traveling unseen, and that they \nsometimes gather in packs or groups. Different packs seem to have territories, and they \nmay fight or work with other packs. Individual werewolves sometimes show specific \ncultural characteristics. Most werewolves follow some sort of shamanistic tradition. \nWEREWOLE \nLORE x 4 \nYou always carry silver - \nit burns werewolves except in their most favored \nforms, and wounds caused to them with silver do not heal easily. Fire is an acceptable \nweapon, but not as effective as silver. Other attacks must rely on main force to slow \na werewolf down, and werewolves are killing machines that can hardly be matched \nby the toughest of hunters. Thus, you must rely on ambushes and careful planning \nto fight werewolves. \nYou know that werewolves refer to themselvcs as “garou,” possibly from the \nFrench term “loup-gurou.” Often, they run in packs, but each werewolf may claim \nallegiance to a specific camp or tribe as well. A few werewolves belong to packs that \nfight with the others, but most packs work together. The full moon brings out a great \nfury in werewolves, but it does not force them to change; oddly, different phases of \nthe moon carry significance to different werewolves. Each werewolf also has a \nfavored form - \nhuman, wolf or man-wolf. The werewolf is most comfortable in that \nform, but it does not heal anymore rapidly than normal. When in the man-wolfform, \nwerewolves are terrifying berserkers, and most humans are frightened beyond \nrational thought by their rage. People tend to forget about such encounters, their \nminds defensively pushing away the experience. \nYou’ve learned that werewolves have a sort of spiritual, shamanistic culture, \nand that they can do some sort of magic based around spirits. Different werewolves \nhave different powers, often related to some sort of status system. Werewolves also \nseem to have relatives among otherwise normal humans and wolves, though these \nindividuals cannot be told from their counterparts in society. When among human \nsociety, the werewolves often disdain technology, and have a particular dislike of big \ncorporations, factories and industry. Stranger still, there seem to be shapechangers \ncapable of taking other forms, but they are even more scarce legends than werewolves. \nWEREWOLE \nLOREX 5 \nAt this level of expertise, you know as much about werewolves as they usually \nknow about themselves.

Most Garou run in packs with others from different tribes, breeds and auspices. \nA few packs are composed of the “Black Spiral Dancer” tribe, agroup of werewolves that \nare all evil and corrupt, and these werewolves fight others of their kind. \nGarou also have potent spirituality. You know that the garou can enter a \nmagical spirit world, which they call the “Umbra,” by stepping into a reflective \nsurface, and that they can step back out through any similar surface. They also make \ndeals with spirits, calling upon them for magical powers. Some packs have a \nparticular patron spirit - \na “totem” [sic] - \nthat grants them additional boons. \nAll werewolves are killing machines when enraged. In their man-wolf forms, they \nate half again as tall as a human, incredibly fast and strong and deadly with their claws \nand teeth. However, they remain intelligent, able to call upon both human intelli- \ngence and animal instinct. At times, werewolves become terribly furious, and they are \nthen uncontrollably dangerous. They have a particular crusade against the spoils of \nprogress, such as pollution and toxic waste, though not all are total Luddites. You know \nthat werewolves spend most oftheir time in the wilderness, guarding holy places where \nthey commune with their spirit allies. You also know that they have relatives among \nboth humans and wolves, and that they choose mates from such relatives. \nIn their man-wolf forms, werewolves cause a reaction that they call “Delirium,” \ncausing people to forget the sight of the werewolf or to rationalize it away. This \nsurvival instinct causes normal humans to flee in terror or curl into a helpless ball; \nonly the strongest wills remain unbroken.

In many cultures, stories tell ofheroes traveling to the lands of the dead \nand returning, or of the dead passing their wisdom on to the living. Some speak of \nan age where the dead and living existed together in harmony. Such days, if they ever \nhappened, are long gone. The dead do not deign to commune with the living, or are \nthey unable; the living, in turn, fear the unlit corridors of the afterlife, when they \nbother to turn to such thoughts at all. \nThe Restless Dead themselves come into their darkly lit realm with scant \nknowledge of their condition. Indeed, most are not even aware, blinded and \ndeadened by their Cauls upon death. Only a very few arrive sensible and able to \ncomprehend their surroundings - \nand no wraith is ever guaranteed a mentor or \ntutor to learn the skills necessary to exist in the Underworld. The passion to hang \non to some memory of existence does not come with any more answers to the \nmysteries of death. Most ghosts can only discover their own powers and limitations \nthrough trial and error, or with the rare advice of another compassionate spirit. \nLearning Wraith Lore is a difficult and trying task. Finding a teacher capable of \ninstructing one in such secrets is a feat in and of itself; most wraiths learn their limits \nand capabilities through hard trial and error. A mortal probably needs a wraithly \ninstructor, or talent in areas like the Merit: Medium or the Ephemera sorcerous path, \nin order to gain this knowledge. Wraiths usually manage to puzzle out a small amount \nafter some time in the Underworld, but true understanding may take years, many \ninstructors and several failed ventures. Wraiths going about their business are the \nmost common learners of Wraith Lore, of course, though some necromantically- \ninclined supernatural creatures of other factions develop a small understanding of \nthe dead (most notably: Giovanni, Samedi, Harbinger of Skulls and Nagaraja \nvampires; Silent Strider Garou; various death-cult wizards; sluagh changelings and, \nof course, mummies). \nWRAITH \nLOREX I \nYou know (or at least believe) that ghosts exist, that some people go on to an \nafterlife. It may be that all the dead congregate in one eternal place, or that they go \non to separate unlives, or that some do not go at all - \nyou haven’t met enough ghosts \nto know for sure. Some ghosts are just plain nasty, apparently only being reflections \nof all of their pain, hate or fear in life; others mindlessly repeat their actions from \ntheir living days. A few are still sensible and able to talk, though they can freakily \nchange moods with extreme rapidity. \nMany wraiths seem to hold on to places or people that were familiar 01 \nimportant to them in life.

Some wraiths haunt areas through cold spots or \nlights; others speak in eerie whispers; still others even possess people or objects. \nThere’s no telling what powers a particular ghost manifests, though. You do know \nthat ghosts are normally immaterial, but can still see and hear things in the living \nworld. Even if driven off, most wraiths eventually return. \nA ghost is supposedly barred by sea salt, according to old tales, and it may also be \nvulnerable to exorcisms, to strewing an area with rose petals or to threatening the people \nor objects it holds dear. Swings or blows can affect wraiths, though this really just seems \nto annoy them, not injure them. However, ghosts can interact with one another. \nWRAITH \nLOREX \n2 \nApparently, not everybody becomes a ghost on dying, or perhaps some of them \ngo on to a place unable to reach the mortal realm. Whatever the case, ghosts seem \nto be nothing more or less than the souls of the dead, still clinging to some semblance \nof life. A few - \nspectres - \nare malicious and violent, but most are just a little \nunstable (doubtless from dying). \nYou know the term “Fetter.” A Fetter is an object, person or place with some \nsignificance to a particular wraith. Apparently, wraiths can use them for protection, \nand they hang around such objects or places due to some spiritual tie. Destroyed Fetters \nsometimes become “ghost objects,” as do other objects with important memories \nattached, though not under any conditions that you can conclusively repeat. \nWraiths term their special powers Arcanoi and study a wide range of abilities. \nSome can haunt areas, and some can appear material briefly. You only know of about \na half-dozen such powers, but there are supposedly a great many. Aside from that, \nwraiths have very sharp senses, and they sometimes see images of death or life \nswirling about things or people. They also are immune to most physical strikes. \nA wraith can be exorcised by a skilled priest, or kept out with magical wardings \nand strong belief (pure sea salt works best). Most wraiths have a very hard time \naffecting the living world, if at all. Also, they can be discorporated briefly, and if they \nsuffer too much ghostly injury (especially from other wraiths), they disappear for a \ntime - \nsometimes forever. \nThere are supposedly “layers” to the deadlands. The Shadowlands refer to the \nreflection of the mortal world. The Tempest is some sort of eternal storm, but it only \nrarely rages through parts of the Shadowlands. Also, there are apparently Heaven( s) \nand Hell(s) in the Underworld, though they are far away and barred to most (you \nhave to be worthy of entry, or something). \nWRAITH \nLOREX 3 \nMany people can and do become wraiths after death.

They’re all objects important to the \nwraith in some way, though the wraith may not understand why. A Fetter is more \neasily influenced by some powers, but conversely, injuring a Fetter is damaging to the \nwraith, and destroying one can cause serious problems. \nWraiths use Arcanoi to manifest various strange powers, the various “ghost \npowers” out of stories. You’ve heard of most of the common Arcanoi, and you know \nthat they were once taught by powerful Guilds, but those Guilds were disbanded. You \nalso know that using an Arcanos to deal with the living lands is apparently illegal. \nThose who are caught may be turned into slaves or punished by using parts of their \nbodies to make ghostly objects! \nWraiths do have some weaknesses. Without special powers, they have trouble \ninteracting with the material world. This is most true in areas ofdisbelief, science and \nvibrant life - a mundane supermarket is harder to haunt than a run-down \nabandoned house. Even when a wraith affects the material world, its passage and \npowers are often remembered incorrectly or forgotten by mortal witnesses entirely. \nExorcisms can sometimes bar or send away wraiths, but apparently only a few priests \nknow how to do them properly. Sea salt and those other old wives’ tales have no \neffect at all. Thankfully, a dedicated assault on the area that a ghost occupies can \ndiscorporate it, eventually forcing it away or even into a sort of nightmare play where \nit confronts its worst fears and terrors. This event is called a Harrowing. \nYou’re most familiar with the Shadowlands, the edge of the Undenvorldnearest \nthe living world.

To \nunderstand humans, or perhaps just as a trick, they occasionally take humans away \nfor a time, stealing wives or even replacing children. \nFaeries have their own society, from mischievous pucks to fair elf maidens, ruled \n(of course) by OberonandTitania (according to Shakespeare, anyway). Faeries have \nstrange rules and realms, even entire kingdoms like Avalon hidden away from \nhuman eyes. Should you step into a faerie door - \na door under a hill, or through a \nring of mushrooms or even into a tree - \nyou may find yourself trapped there for a \nlong time, even if it seems only a short while. Also, you should never accept a gift \nfrom a faerie, or you may be held enthralled; similarly, offering a gift is seen as an \ninsult, an attempt to indebt the faerie in question. \nFAERIE LOREX 2 \nThe faeries of the modem world sure aren’t anything like the old faerie tales. For \nthat matter, faeries in the old days probably weren’t like that, either. Though they \ncome in many shapes, sizes and forms, they seem to be able to cloak their true \nappearances, looking like normal people. Even when they decide to show their \npowers and forms, most people forget it later. \nChangelings seem to have a variety of magic spells to trick, confuse and call \nupon nature. Many also have knacks like performing great amounts of work or \nturning into mist; there’s no real way to tell how much a given faerie can do with his \nmagic. They rarely call upon these powers in the real world, though, content to cast \nsubtle and invisible spells instead. \nMagic spells of the right sort can certainly call or banish changelings or faeries, \nas can such tricks as hanging an iron horseshoe over your door. Church bells and holy \nground apparently keep faeries away, but most of the other little tricks from legend \ndon’t seem to have any effect (probably the results of faeries playing pranks on people). \nThey do get rather disturbed by the old refrain of ‘‘I don’t believe in faeries!”, though. \nIf you can get a changeling to swear an oath, it’s binding, so it is possible to trick them. \nSince they can get drunk or enraged like anyone else, and often with an even more \nterrible temper, this tactic may be a decent one to use when a changeling’s off-guard. \nExperience shows that changelings most often show up at places of natural \nbeauty or art, and they have an irresistible attraction for humans who are beautiful, \ncharismatic and influential, or conversely ignorant, arrogant and pushy. The former \nthey tend to seduce and carry away; the latter, they tease with vicious (and \nsometimes fatal) pranks. \nH U N T I N g  LORES \ne \n"

You’ve uncovered \ninformation about the various kiths, such as the sidhe and the trolls, though you \nprobably don’t know all of the European fae (and you’ve probably never heard of any \nof the stranger types). You’ve heard that the faeries are really dream-spirits from \nanother world, given captured human forms. Then again, you’ve also heard of tiny \nbrownies and sprites, which are obviously ridiculous. Still, faerie tales are sure to be \nfull of errors due to the Mists: most humans fail to see faerie magic, or forget about \nit later, possibly accounting for those stories of lost time. \nChangelings wield powers based on dream and the shaping of imagination. \nThey require the use of some sort of vibrant dream energy, and many changelings \ncloak their magic in comical guises or games. Changelings draw some sort of magical \nsustenance from creativity itself, though they can also apparently steal dreams when \nfeeling particularly vicious. Most changeling powers only affect others able to see \ndreams, though in dire straits a changeling can bring some of her magic across to the \nmaterial world. \nAs for weaknesses of the fae, you’ve discovered (possibly the hard way) that \nmost folk tales are totally wrong. Iron seems to have a deleterious effect upon them, \nas does the power of disbelief itself. Presumably, they can also be injured by magic. \nA faerie is also vulnerable to dream-creatures, and can be knocked unconscious by \nsuch attacks. Puzzlingly, the Mists can sometimes affect a faerie so injured, causing \nthe changeling to forget all about her heritage. Changelings canalso be held to sworn \noaths, though only sometimes - \nthe peculiars are unknown to you. \nChangelings obviously congregate wherever artists and dreamers gather. How- \never, most still lead some semblance of a normal life, as well. They occasionally refer \nto ranks of nobility, though these titles may simply be formalities for their courtly \ndances in their own, strange society. A few rare sites seem to serve as changeling \ndream-fortresses, called Freeholds, but you know nothing more than that (and, \nindeed, have probably never seen such a conceptually silly place, in any case). \nEAERIE LOREX 4 \nYou’ve seen or heard of most of the European kiths and understand that \nchangelings are basically fragments of dream instilled into human forms. Each kith \nwields a few rather spectacular powers and an unusual appearance, although both \ntraits usually only work in the dream-realm that overlaps changeling reality. \nThe powers of changelings are called Arts, and they affect things through \ntrickery, misdirection, illusion, natural forces and majestic charisma. Most change- \nlings have a modicum of skill with a few Arts, though they have limits on what they \ncan affect, dictated by various Realms of existence. Furthermore, fueling magical \npowers requires the use of special tricks called Bunks, seemingly random little \ngestures or games. Changelings harvest the power of creativity from artistic mortals, \neither by inspiration or by stealing the essence of dreams. This distilled power, \nGlamour, takes many random forms, but it ultimately ties a changeling to the dream \nworlds that exist parallel to mundane existence. \nOnly a few weapons prove truly deadly to changelings. Obviously, their mortal \nbodies are just as vulnerable to damage as anyone else, but their faerie souls can only \nbe permanently quenched with magic or cold iron. “Cold iron” doesn’t necessarily seem \n"

A Freehold is a faerie for- \ntress, often with its own dream \nappearance. Mortals tend to avoid such \nplacesdue to the effects of the Mists. In \nFreeholds, changelings can replenish \ntheir power, and sometimes even call \nupon new dream allies or treasures. \nFAERIE LOREX 5 \nYou know most secrets of faerie \nand changeling society. Changelings, \nfor instance, are faerie souls in human \nbodies, there in an attempt to survive in the mortal realm. True faeries are gone from \nthe world-only their mortal remnants live on now, some even unaware of their true \nnatures. These changelings protect themselves from Banality by hiding in mortal \nforms, reincarnating into new bodies when their mortal host shells die (except the \nsidhe - \nnobody knows what happens to them). The changelings that survive come \nfrom various groups, or kiths. Each kith traces its heritage back to a fragment of myth \nand dream. You can name the various kiths, as well as their common capabilities, and \nyou know about the existence of some unusual types of faeries in Asia and Native \nAmerican cultures, though particulars are sketchy at best. A rare few humans inherit \na little faerie blood but not a true soul; these kinain are valuable relatives, some even \npossessing a few changeling tricks. \nYou’ve learned about the names and effects of various changeling Arts and the \ncorresponding Realms. Furthermore, you’re familiar with the different common \nmodes ofgaining Glamour- Reverie, Rapture and Ravaging-and \nyou know about \nBunks and how to perform them. You’re aware of the distinction between the \nchimerical world and the “real” one, and of chimerical damage, faerie miens and how \nto influence both. The more esoteric aspects of faerie existence are still sketchy in \nyour experience, though you’ve heard tales about mighty quests, magical treasures \ncapable of instilling wonder and magic, realms of fantastic legend where youth and \nhope are restored and paths to immortality and true reconciliation for the fragmen- \ntary human and fae souls. \nO n  the flip side, you can also be a danger to the fae: Cold iron, unrefined and \nin its natural unalloyed iron state, is anathema, capable of inflicting mortal wounds \nand even destroying a faerie soul completely. As creatures of dream and wonder, \nfaeries are also vulnerable to disbelief and - \nmore terribly - \nboredom.

Furthermore, you know that changelings can be held to their \noaths, if they swear under the old forms, though such oaths can paradoxically grant \nthem the strength of will to fulfill their sworn promises. \nEven if you’ve never been to a Freehold, you know about the existence of these \nwellsprings of Glamour, their tendency to shift time and space and the balefire \nhearths that represent their power. The rulers of Freeholds are usually changeling \nnobles, which generally means one of the sidhe; however, some commoners hold \nsites, and the titles of nobles (duke, count and so on) vary widely enough to indicate \narange ofpossible possessions and treasures.

You’ve heard the salutory rumors \nof various gates and doorways to realms of faerie or even to Arcadia itself, though \nthese are nothing but faraway legends, of course. \nOTHER LORES \nMaking up other Lore Abilities is a task left to the individual Storyteller. Just \nabout any group or supernatural phenomenon in the World of Darkness could be a \nsubject of a specialized Lore. Some examples: \nCainite Lore: Deeper secrets of vampires, covering such things as the Book of \nNod, particulars of the Blood Bond, the development of Disciplines, lost bloodlines \nand the like. (Sometimes mistakenly called Kindred Lore - \nremember, only \nCamarilla Licks call themselves “Kindred,” so that’s a misnomer.) \nCamarilla or Sabbat Lore: Understanding of the history, policies and influential \nmembers of a particular vampire society. Useful for ghouls, revenants and neonate \nvampires who want to get ahead, or hunters who specialize in dealing with one \ngroup’s particular tactics. \nClan Lore: The inside scoop on a given clan of vampires. Great for toadying \nghouls on a waiting list. \nGarou Lore: The particulars ofshapeshifter society, includingranks, rites, Gifts, \nspirit dealings, history, the Silver Record, the Litany and so on. Higher levels may \nimpart some knowledge of other shapeshifter types. Useful for kinfolk. \nHsien Lore: Special knowledge of the hsien, the heavenly messengers of Asia. \nInfernal Lore: Knowledge of infernalists and demonologists, their practices, \npowers and forbidden magic. \nKinfolk Lore: Study into the recessive side of the shifting family, the limits of \nkinfolk, how their lineages interact with shifters and what sorts of powers they can \nunlock. Good for kinfolk in general (though they would not automatically have such \nknowledge) or for garou making a study of their relatives. \nMage Lure: The wiles, Traditions and techniques of powerful willworkers. \nMummy Lore: A bit ofexperience with theever-reincarnating Reborn, whether \nfrom Egypt or from other versions of the Spell of Life. \nSpirit Lore: Congress with and knowledge of the various natural spirits and \ncelestial entities in the Umbra and beyond. \nTribal Lore: An understanding of the tribal secrets and hidden history of a \nparticular family of werewolves. This is a good Lore for a kinfolk studying his \nparticular tribe, or someone studying the weaknesses inherent to one tribe. \n"

A player’s character might \nlearn more about a particular type of supernatural creature in one night than he’ll \never have the Experience Traits to buy the requisite levels of Lore to represent. \nIf you are running a chronicle, it is important to know when to anticipate this \naccelerated learning curve. If you are creating a human character for a largely \nvampire-populated chronicle, for instance, it may be advisable to put a cap on the \nlevel of Lore the human may purchase after character creation. After all, if a human \nenters the game with one level of Vampire Lure, and some loose-lipped Ventrue \nhistorian spills the beans as he understands things, purchasing more levels of Vampire \nLore is no longer cost-effective. However, you might state that any knowledge an \nuninitiated character gains about a supernatural creature must be purchased in the \nLore path, or the character will “forget” what he has learned. \nOn the whole, however, it is worthwhile to note that these lores are best used \nas roleplaying notes. If a hunter character has gained only the first level of Vumpire \nLure, make sure he acts on the supposition that vampires are repulsed by the cr \ngarlic, their own reflection and the barrier of running water. Having a hunter (even \na Storyteller character) learn from his mistakes and adapt to the true World of \nDarkness makes for a much more dramatic story than having someone say, “Okay, \nthis is what I think I know; what’s the truth?” \nBecause, after all, finding out the night’s true secrets and surviving to tell the \ntale of how you learned them is so much more rewarding in the end. \nI \nI \nI \nr \nI \n"

One of the \nscrews went skittering across the wooden floor, and with a silent curse Todd retrieved \nit in his long, chalky fingers. His face a pallid mask of concern, he looked up at the figure \nsnoring on the bed across the room, still blissfully asleep. \nTodd grinned. Even on his worst day, he still had it. “Not too shabby still, old \nman,” he hissed to himself, and stalked toward the figure on the bed. \nThe man lying in the tangle of blankets was huge, at least six and a half feet \nin height. His barrel chest rose and fell in time with his titanic snores, which were \nloud enough to be physically painful to Todd’s sensitive ears. The man’s face was \nwide, florid and bearded, and his massive hands clenched and unclenched in \nrandom, spasmodic motions. \n“You look a lot better when you’re blue, old man,” Todd whispered, studying his \ntarget for a moment. Normally Todd knew the man in his other guise, that of a troll \nknight with the laughable name of Waldo. Tonight, however, he was just plain old \nWally Bergen, and plain old Wally didn’t have a hope in hell against the subtlest, most \ninfamous and best paid (the last was important, Todd told himself) assassin the sluagh \nhad ever spawned. \nTruth be told, Waldo didn’t stand much of a chance either. Todd was that good. \nSir Waldo had made a mistake, you see. At court, he’d had a few too many mugs \nof ale and gotten a little too loud about certain indiscretions other court members had \nmade. Someone had taken offense, someone with a great deal of money to spend on \nvengeance. That someone had hired Todd the Grey. \nAs usual, Todd wore his working clothes -black \nsilk, from head to toe, and \npaper#soled shoes. He eschewed both gloves and mask - \nhe liked neither his \nvision nor his spidery fingers obstructed when he went to work. As always, he wore \na belt of black braided leather, with a single slim dagger and a single black pouch. \nHis fine, long hands paused over the dagger for a moment, then reached into the \npouch.

Within seconds, all had disappeared, leaving \nonly a smiling Todd to witness their departure. \nWith infinite care, Todd moved back to the duct, slid inside, and replaced \nthe vent. Behind him, the tenor of Wally’s snoring was changing. The Inner \nSpinners had gone to work. Todd permitted himself a last glimpse of his prey, and \nthen he vanished. \n*** \nWally jolted from his sleep with a choked snort. He sat up and tried to suck in a \nlungful of air to clear his head of the nightmares he’d been having and found to his \nhorror that he couldn’t. His mouth and nose were stuffed with something cold and \nsticky, and he could feel things swarming around inside his mouth. They were crawling, \nhe could feel it, and filling his throat with more of that same sticky stuff. In a panic, he \nbrought his hands to his mouth to try to tear out whatever was in there, but he could \nonly pull away tiny clumps of spiderweb while the creatures inside kept on spinning \nmore and more of it and the terrible pressure in his chest kept on building. \nThe last thing Sir Waldo, for he had returned to his fae mien in desperation, saw \nwas one of the Inner Spinners taking aleisurely walk across his left eye. Thankfully, after \nthat, he saw no more. \n*** \nIt was nearly dawn when the spiders finished marching themselves home. Todd \nhad been up waiting, sharpening his knives impatiently and otherwise engaging in all \nthe rituals of a worried parent. “There you are at last,” he said with relief when the first \nclumped its way onto his windowsill. “It certainly took you longenough.”The column \nof spiders halted and wobbled uncertainly. “Yes, I know what took you so long - \nhe \nhad a big, big mouth, didn’t he? That’s why you had to go pay him a visit. Now sit \nyourselves down and rest. You’ll need your strength.” \nOne by one, the clockwork spiders nestled themselves up so that Todd could \nsweep them, gently, back into his pouch. As the last one vanished into its dark \nconfines, Todd smiled the smile of a gently loving father.

So Slander just made do with various idle \ndefenestration fantasies as he tailed the Artificer to the previously arranged meeting \npoint. \nIt didn’t make the trip any more pleasant, Slander noted, that the bastard couldn’t \ncarry a tune in a bucket. \nEventually the Artificer, a short, squat man in painfully anachronistic overalls \nand work boots, ducked into a nondescript shop off the agora. Slander, wearing the \nface he’d once seen on a coin of Imperial Roman vintage, waited what might once \nhave been three heartbeats, then followed the client in. It was a trap, of course. These \nsorts of situations were always traps. The clients in these cases always had a particular \nflavor of nervousness that gave them away instantly.

Eventually, the assassin shrugged, gave up the fruitless \nchase, and stood perfectly still, waiting. \n“Three minutes, Slander.

Why the blackout?” \n“You can’t see me, you can’t take out your disappointment on me. For my part, I \nwas blind from birth until death, so this places me at a distinct advantage. I’m used to \nthis. And in the meantime, this gives me enough of an edge that you’ll talk instead of \ntrying anything, at least for a little while.” \n“So what do you want to know?” Slander’s tone was neutral, guarded. \n“Names of clients, names of targets, methods by which you can be contacted, your \nconnection to the Masquers’ Guild.” \n“The Guild doesn’t exist.” \n“And my name is Charon, Imperator of this Golden Age of Stygia.

When can I start?” \n“Ahem.”The nervous little man, Schiller’s assistant, cleared his throat, nervously, \nof course. “There is the matter of compensation, which we still haven’t ironed out yet. \nNow the figures you’ve provided as your acceptable range-” \n“If they’re too high, I’m open to negotiation.” Sheldon spread his big, soft hands \nin a gesture of magnanimity. “Really, that’s only an initial range.” \nThe little man, who went by the name of Keenan, shook his head vehemently, \nalmost dislodging his carefully combed-over hair from his forehead. “Nonononono. \nActually, I was going to say that your numbers were well below what we were expecting. \nWe were going to come in with an offer substantially higher than the range you \nproposed, which, frankly, I find a little puzzling when it comes to dealing with someone \nwith vour (of course) superb qualifications.” \nSheldon placed his hands on the table, palms down, and actually managed to \nlook embarrassed. “Well, I have a confession to make. I more or less lowballed \nmyself.” \n“Why!” \n“Well, because I really want the position. Call it the guilt discount for some of the \nthings that I worked on at Magadon. Though if you feel compelled to pay me more, how \nabout this as a compromise: Give me a net point on all the new business that I bring in \nthrough my contacts for the next twelve months, and then we can talk about adding \nanother point or going to straight additional compensation. But honestly, all that is \nsecondary.” Keenan had already tuned him out and was scribbling figures frantically on \nthe yellow pad in front of him. Schiller leaned forward, interested. \n“Secondary? That may be a first, frankly. Usually we have to cut these \ninterviews short when the interviewee decides that we can’t pay enough.” \nSheldonsmiled that too-wide smile again. “Look, Miss Schiller, let me level with \nyou. I want to work here, and I’ve done my research. I know you, and I know your \ncompany, and I know you’re not doing anywhere near as well as you could be. There \nare a lot: of companies out there who’d rather gamble with the EPA than pay you to \nstraighten their acts out. They all lose in the end,” he paused and shrugged, as if he \nknew that fact all too well, “but try telling them that until the time the government \ninspecmrs show up on their doorsteps with plastic bags and notepads. So, we need to \nfind a way to get them to listen to you, even when they don’t want to listen. We’ve \ngot to find a way to trick them, essentially, into buying what you’re selling. And that’s \nwhere I come in. These men don’t want to hear about how they can obey the law. Sad \nbut true, they want to hear how they can beat it, hypercompetitive bastards that they \nare. So we reposition Proac’s approach. We still provide the same product, but we sell \nit as a way to get around the EPA, a way to buy some time for compliance so it doesn’t \ncost as much. Let them think they’re getting away with something and they’ll pay \nthrough the nose for it; give them honest value and they’ll go looking for a bargain. \nHell, if any of them had any sense of responsibility in the first place, this company \nwouldn’t exist, right? So let me pitch it to you straight: I’ll take point. I’ll go in to the \nS T R I N ~  \nQUARTET \n"

Think you can work out the contract language?” \n“Cfcourse.” Keenan sounded hurt. “I’ll have it ready for the lawyers to look at by three.” \n“Excellent.” Internally, Sheldon was laughing. Schiller was clearly hooked, \nand Keenan was a nonentity. The woman had clearly caught the smell of money \nand she’d follow it off the path of her principles. Soon delays in conforming would \nturn into workarounds and avoidance, and she’d justify each step to herself. \nHonestly, if she were half as smart as she thought, she never would have fallen for \nthe lowball technique.

No idea at all.” \nPART \nIV: LOOSE THREADS \nThree and three they flew, three above and three below. Seen from the proper \nangle, Murder’s Daughters formed a perfect diamond. Seen from another, they were just \nanother unkindness of ravens riding a cold, angry wind. \nThe land they flew over was brown with dead leaves and gray with asphalt; it was \na place of square white houses with square mown lawns. It was a place where nothing \nextraordinary would be allowed to happen, where good and evil would both be kept at \nbay by the desire of the residents for normalcy above all else. \nGood tended to respect this desire. Unfortunately, evil didn’t. \nThe six ravens swooped over the neighborhood once, twice, three times, then \nfound their target and dove for it. One by one they swooped through an open window \non the second floor of an otherwise utterly ordinary house, landing one by one in an \nutterly ordinary computer room that just happened to have a corpse on the floor. \nThe dead man was of median height, with a florid face and eyes that stared \nunseeing in death. He wore a white dress shirt, strained a bit across his belly, and navy \nslacks. He wore no shoes, and there was a hole in the heel of one of his hideous argyle \nsocks. There was no blood, no sign of violence, but he was quite dead. \n“So,” said the eldest of Murder’s Daughters (for where there had been three plus \nthree ravens now sat six women with hair as black as coal, “anyone know why this one \ncalled so strongly?” \n“Not I,” said the next in age. “But we all heard it.” The others all nodded. \n“Perhaps we could ask him?” said the youngest. “Surely he would know why his \ndeath called us here.” \nM I N D ’ S  \nE Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n4D \n"

      "text": "The third and fourth nodded in agreement, while the fifth, who was jealous of the \nyoungest, said “Hmmph!” and turned away. The eldest pondered a moment, and said, \n“An excellent idea. Gwen, will you grant me the privilege ?“ The youngest flushed and \nnodded wordless approval. The eldest smiled, and shifted, and where there had been a \nwoman was a raven. The raven stepped gingerly onto the corpse and peered at his eyes \nhungrily, then cocked her head at a curious angle. She stood that way for a long minute, \nwhile her five companions watched anxiously. Then, suddenly, she flew to the top of \nthe monitor on the desk against the far wall and perched, agitatedly. \n“He’s not giving permission,” said the eldest, for Murder’s Daughters can under- \nstand the tongue of ravens while in woman’s form. “I’m not allowed.” \n“Just take it,” said the fifth oldest, anxious to outshine the youngest. “He’s dead. \nIt’s not as if he can stop you.” \nThe second oldest fixed her with an angry stare. “We must always ask. Even \nbefore we drink the eyes of the worst, the lowest, the foulest, we must ask. Raven \ntaught us thus, and so we follow his teachings. To do otherwise is to invite \ndisaster.” And the four eldest turned their back on their younger sibling, who \nblushed red with shame and anger. \n‘‘Perhaps I should try,” said the third eldest, who knelt before the dead man and \nwhispered imploring words to him. She knelt as long as the eldest had waited, then \nshook her head as well and stood. “He wants nothing from us but abandonment.” \nThe youngest stood when she heard this. The others all looked at her, save the \nnearest to her in age, who turned to stare pointedly out the still-open window. “Perhaps \nI could try?” \n“TWO \nof us have already spoken to him, girl,’’ said the second oldest. “What can \nyou say that they have not?” \nThe youngest said nothing to this, but only asked, “Please?” So the oldest and the \nsecond oldest looked at each other, and nodded assent, and the youngest changed \nherself into the form Raven had given her mother’s mother’s mother’s mother. \nAnd so, as a bird the youngest stood near the man’s face and asked the spirit of the \ndead man if he’d give up his eye to her. Wordlessly, she felt his assent, though she felt \nsorrow as well. And so she drank deep of his right eye, to see what he had seen in his \nlast moments of life. The others watched in silence and respect and waited for the \nyoungest to speak in her own time. \nShe changed first, and this was something unprecedented amongst Murder’s Daugh- \nters. Always one spoke of one’s visions of the dead while in raven form, out of custom. \n“Girl, what did you see?“ The eldest’s tone was ice, for she had a long respect for \nthe way things had always been done. \n“Rutcher the body,” said the youngest, in a voice colder still. “Tear out his other \neye. Make strings ofhis guts. Kill him all over again.” She turned to where the dead man \nlay on the, floor and spat on his now-bloody face. Then, eschewing raven form, she \nwalked out the door into the house, and thus made her way out. \n[t was the one who was now the youngest who made the first cut, using a knife of \nbone that she’d taken from a dead man. After a second’s hesitation, the others joined \nin. By the time five ravens flew away from the house, the room was an abbatoir, the \ncorpse a bloody ruin. \n.4nd the sixth? She stood on the sidewalk outside her father’s house and tried to \nforger what she had seen through his eyes, something that made it kinder to make it look \nas if he’d been murdered than to allow the truth to be found. For three hours and three \nmore she stood there. Then, when the last red rays of the setting sun struck her, she \nchanged to raven form and flew off to the west. Someone was waiting there for her, she \nwas sure of it. And nothing waited for her in that house any more. \nS T R I N C ~  \nQUABTET \nQp \n"

Because it needed doing. \nNow that that’s out of the way, let’s get into the other stuff. \nAfter writing for and editing the revised edition of Vampire, I realized that \nLaws of the Night wasn’t going to hold up to the sudden influx of new material \ncoming in. The World of Darkness was reinventing itself, and ye olde faithful Laws \nof the Night, as it stood, just wasn’t up to the challenge. Sure enough, the questions \nabout a new edition of Laws of the Night started to pour in as soon as the news \nabout VRev hit the press. I decided to bump the incipient Kindred of the East \ntranslation back somewhat on the schedule and prepare for a second edition of \nLaws of the Night. I did all this juggling within a few hours of suddenly receiving \nthe job of MET developer - \na scheduling feat something like watching the gates \ncome down when one is in the middle of the railroad crossing. \nThe writers I hunted down are some of MET’S best, bringing their experience \nas players and Storytellers to the task at hand. They include: \nPeter Woodworth- After auditioning with The Shining Host and further \ndisplaying his talents with Laws of the Wyld West, Peter was entrusted with the \nmonumental task of writing up the sections on rules and drama, and also the allies \nand antagonists. In addition to all this, he’s going to school and is becoming a \nheckuva swing dancer. \nJason Carl- Jason wrote the Storytelling chapters for Laws of Elysium and \nThe Long Night, largely from his own experiences. I told him to write as if he were \ngetting the chance to sit down with every Storyteller new to LARPing and every \ngrizzled veteran who thinks there’s nothing new to learn - \nI hope you agree with \nme that he delivered as promised. \nJess Heinig - \nThe Mage developer comes with a long history of playing \nand Storytelling in California, and I gave him the monstrous chore of re- \ncreating character creation, the clans and the Disciplines. A hefty task, one \nhe was up to in spades. \n"

      "text": "Now, the next big question on everyone’b minds - \nwhat’s been changed? \nWhy should Joe Vampire go pick this new edition up and set aside his faithful, \nragged Laws of the Night? \nFor starters, I’ve sought to make this book user-friendly for everyone, whether \nthe person picking it up is a longtime player getting the latest edition or someone \nextremely new to LARPing (or even the world of Vampire). Anyone can pick it \nup and start playing with a minimum of effort, and a new player can read the intro \nto get a sense of what’s happening. A new Storyteller has everything he needs to \nstart a small chronicle in his living room, whereas a veteran can pick up some tricks \nto make his life easier when the new players arrive. \nThe biggest effort came in when I incorporated anumber ofchanges that come \nnot only fromvampire but also from some five years ofsteady LARPing experience \nin various styles and venues. Consider that the real playtest -years of rugged wear \nand tear to see what lasts and what becomes the bane of existences. For example, \nspending a Willpower now allows you only to retest on a Social or Mental \nChallenge, not to ignore it. This proviso eliminates the problem of some cheese- \nweasel thinking he can blow through an elder’s Malesty or using Willpower to avoid \nbeing trapped by a social Discipline so he can mulch someone else. Likewise, \nHumanity, Paths of Enlightenment and Virtue came under hard scrutiny - \nhow \n“human” is a vampire with two Beast Traits, and how do you roleplay that? How \ndo these nifty new Paths of Enlightenment fit into the grand scheme of things? \nFrom Vampire, I brought in things that I had worked on during the book‘s creation \nand editing, such as the problem of Malkavians in fuzzy slippers (grrr ...) or how to \nroleplay the tightening hold of a blood bond. \nAnother major change to LotNZ is that the METstoryline has been advanced \nalong with the tabletop storyline. The Assamites have broken their blood curse \n(and Quietus suddenly has some sinister new uses), the Gangrel have abandoned \nthe sinking ship called the Camarilla and the entire clan of Malkav’s get has been \ninfected with Dementation. These changes don’t mean you have to chuck your \nentire storyline to start marching along with our drumbeat - \nthese developments \noccurred very much in secret (at this stage, even I don’t know how some of this stuff \nhappened), and you may choose to have your game touched by them only \nperipherally (for example, as strange rumors from the East Coast). \nOne question I’ve been hearing a lot is, “What happens to our old characters?” \nDon’t fret: thev don’t have to be retired. After all, it can be a lot of fun to \n’ \nthrough the mysteries of why the tetched Malkavian has suddenly become : \ntetched or what happens to city dynamics when the Gangrel as a whole tel \nCamarilla to go jump inalake. Asectiononupdatingcharacters has beeninch \nso chronicles can continue without missing a beat. \nAnd that is just some of what’s in store - \nhey, I can’t tell you everything 1 \nwould ruin the surprises)! So, if you’re new to Mind’s Eye Theatre and have \nlooking for a place to jump in, come on in. If you’re a battle-scarred trooper \nthinks there’s nothing new under the moon, this book is for you too. \nWelcome to the World of Darkness - \nThe Final Nights are upon us. \nNow that you know - \nor think you know - \nwhat’s in the new edition of La4 \nthe Night, kt’s take a look at what went into it from the writers’ perspectives. \n"

      "text": "My own vision of Vampire centers around a deep love of its ancient politics and \nthe highly delicate interactions between characters; happily enough, both are key \nelements to good live-action play. I believe the best stories for Masqerade games are \nmodeled after such influences as The Usual Suspects, tales in which hard facts are \nconcealed behind ever-shifting layers of personalities and deceit, and trust of any kind \nis a rare and often dangerous commodity. Unlike many Storytellers I have observed \nin the past, I don’t encourage total free-for-all backstabbing. Players tend to feel \nfrustrated and have a lot of out of character disputes when they thinkabsolutely no one \ncan be ever trusted. What true allies you do acquire in a Vampire game had better be \nready to stand by you come hell or high water, though. Supernatural powers are the \nicing on this decidedly deadly cake, an element that forces characters to adapt and \ninnovate constantly lest they fall prey to a vampire who has mastered more of her arts. \nIndeed, many of the basic Disciplines simply exaggerate existing human traits to a \nsupernatural degree; therefore, it is little surprise that vampires are often overblown \nrepresentations of what we dread we might become ourselves, from debauched artists \nto callous financiers to killers in the night. Imagine the paranoia a miserly millionaire \nfeels when guarding his treasures then imagine the fear that comes when he knows his \nfoes can sway emotions, change shape or even read his mind! \nAbove all, the most persistent thought that came to me while I was working on this \nbook was just how many people play Vampire in its live-action incarnation. The notion \nthat what I was writing would have an impact on so many different games just staggered \nme. It felt a little like taking the stage on opening night after months of rehearsals or \nbeing called up to the big leagues for the first time after doing a season in the minors. It’s \nexhilarating, sure, but more than a little scary, too, when you realize that not only will \nso many people be reading your work but that they’ll be testing it constantly for things \nlike fairness and playability as well. Add to that the fact that many dissatisfied souls will \nregister their opinions of your work, your writing ability and your family tree on the Web, \nand you’ve got yourself a genuine writer’s Maalox moment. Fortunately, my trusty troupe \npulled me through the worst early jitters, and I acquired a whole new appreciation for \na game I had thought I’d gotten to know top to bottom over the last six years. \nVampire turned the gaming world on its ear when it was released; Masquerade \ndid it again with the introduction of live-action gaming on a large scale. Now the \nrevised Vampire is turning heads and rocking worlds, and I hope that Laws of the \nNight 2nd Edition can carry on that proud tradition. Semper Vitae! \n- \nPeter Woodworth \nI started preparing to write the Storytelling chapter of this book long before \nCynthia asked me to contribute. Of course, I just didn’t know that I was preparing for it. \nIsn’t that the way these things often happen? My primary source of ideas was the stack \nof Storytelling notes I’d been compiling since discovering MET some six years ago. \nBefore I actually wrote anything, I forced myself to wade through this morass of half- \nfinished thoughts, lengthy polemics and nuggets of genuinely useful wisdom. The notes \nreminded me of an old adage: I learned a hell of lot more from my failures than from my \nsuccesses. My most useful ideas were the results of Storytelling experiences that didn’t \nturn out quite the way I expected or hoped, but it was clear that most of my errors could \nhave been remedied with some frank and solid advice from more experienced Storytell- \ners. So that’s what I decided I wanted to contribute to this book: In addition to providing \nnovice and experienced Storytellers alike the basic tools of the trade, I wanted to offer \nalk about what it really means to tell stories for this game. \n"

      "text": "However, I didn’t want to ignore the things that a Storyteller really needs to \nknow in order to run a successful game. I tried to pay particular attention to those \naspects of the game that have evolved most dramatically and rapidly. For example, \nthe first edition of the game presumed that Storytellers would run relatively small- \nscale games of limited duration. These nights, it’s not uncommon for Storytellers \nto work with groups of fifty players or more and devise plots that endure for years \nof continuous play - both of these considerations demand a change in the way \nStorytellers approach the game. Likewise, greater access to the Internet and the \nWorld Wide Web has changed the way Storytellers operate. The game no longer \nends when the players go home, and tonight’s Storyteller must take this extended \naccess into account or be drowned in a flood of e-mail. \nThe actual writing process is rather a blur in my memory, which, I suppose, is \na mercy of sorts. I do recall that I was sometimes frustrated in my attempts to \nprovide adequate information to the reader without straying too far from my core \nconcept. I also remember struggling with the right way to express certain ideas as \nclearly as possible without over-burdening the reader with unnecessary detail. \nFortunately, Cynthia offered plenty of direction, and that helped me stay focused \n- \nThanks, Cynthia! I think it’s appropriate that I also thank Melissa, my \nwonderful and beloved wife, for her steadfast support and for ignoring the constant \nsound of breaking glass that accompanies my writing efforts. \nIf1 could add anything to the manuscript I submitted, it would be a few more \nwords to Storytellers present and future: You’re an indispensable part of this game \nwe all enjoy with such fervor, and, whether or not we take the time to tell you, \nwe value what you do. \nThank you! \n- \nJason Carl \nSo there I was, playing an eighth-generation Tzimisce and getting pummeled \nseverely by a 13 th generation Lasombra who’d been created only minutes before. As his \nObfuscated cohort escaped (defeating my Advanced Auspex, no less) I buckled under \nthe force of the Potence-backed blows and thought, “This is seriously screwed up.” \nHaving just participated in the writing for the Guide to the Sabbat, I knew that \na lot of our existing Vampire material was sorely out of date, and Laws of the Night \nwas no exception. Laws of the Night had been compiled as an attempt to put together \na lot of out of print rules and to make accessible everything one needed to play live- \naction Vampire, all in an easy to carry format. It proved a smashing success, but many \nof the rules that it used originally had been taken from older material in The \nMasquerade Second Edition or, more decrepit still, the halcyon days of The Masquer- \nade Players Kit. The book tried to reconcile the differences between the first and \nsecond editions only halfheartedly; the idea was to make everything accessible, not \nnecessarily to rewrite all of the rules. Furthermore, the material had always been geared \ntoward small groups playing a few times. With the predominance of larger, longer- \nrunning games- and clubs like the Camarilla, boasting thousands ofplayers in a global \ncontinuity- this approach just didn’t work. Laws of the Night was showing its seams, \nand the material was pretty worn, too. \nSo, in my brief tenure as the Mind’s Eye Theatre developer, I settled on \npushing up the schedule for a revised edition of Laws of the Night. The sooner, \nthe better, I thought; besides, we wanted to address all of the changes in the revised \nM E T  PREVIEW \n6 \n"

      "text": "Vampire quickly. That rush moved the book up to a year after the release of \nVampire Revised. Even after I moved over to the Mage line and Cynthia Summers \nstepped up to Mind’s Eye Theatre, the book stayed on schedule. However, the \nincreased pace meant writing a lot of material very fast, and we had only a few \nwriters lined up for live-action. So, a large chunk of the book‘s writing fell to me. \n“No problem,” I thought (as I often do when beginning daunting projects), “I \nhave a handle on writing live-action material. I wrote stuff for Laws of the Hunt \nand I play enough to know what to fix, what works and what to change.” \nIf ever there was proof that a game developer can be wrong in his estimation ofhis \nown material. Nonetheless, I pressed on, making a list of what needed to be addressed. \nFirst: Fix the Disciplines. The idea of Disciplines with widely varying numbers ofpowers \njust appalled me and seemed unfair. I wanted to put everything back to five levels of power. \nSecond: More detailed character creation. Specifically, Backgrounds had \nbeen included in a lot of other MET books since Laws of the Night; why leave \nthem out of Vampire? The Beast Trait system also seemed to miss some of the \npoints of Vampire -vampires who don’t fear fire or sunlight or don’t feel hunger? \nTime to change that. \nThird: Clan write-ups that don’t explain the clan are of limited use to the \nplayers. Admittedly, a lot of the original live-action material depended on players \nwho were familiar with the tabletop game, so describing the clans seemed \nredundant. The prevalence of silly Malkavians, absurd Ravnos and gangster \nGiovanni showed that a lot of people either weren’t reading the tabletop books or \nhadn’t been exposed to them. Many first-time players found the clans confusing \nand hard to differentiate from one another. It was time to fix that, so expanded \nwrite-ups and notes on how to play each clan seemed like a good idea. \n... so I was sitting in front of the computer 50,000 words later, and itstill wasn’t \ndone. I had waiting playtesters, an overly-patient developer and a headache. \nThe most important thing I learned from writing for Laws of the Night ?The \nDevil’s in the details. \nIn tabletop games, a lot can be left to interpretation. Small groups of five or \nsix players can decide on their own variants of rules, and Storytellers can use what \nmakes sense for their games. \nIn live-action, the game often has 15 or more players (some even number in \nthe hundreds), and it has to run for several hours without a hitch. Nobody can afford \nto stop and argue about rules for two hours. Every eventuality must be covered, from \nwhat happens when two people Summon the same victim at the same time (the \nsubject goes to the summoner with the best generation) to whether it’s better to \ncompress Blood Traits for ease of play (you wanna carry around 14 cards saying \n“vitae” and try to keep track of them all?) at the risk of skewing some of the systems. \nThen, we had to include the changes to Merits and Flaws, the new Influences \nintroduced in Laws of the Hunt, specializations, conversions from previous \neditions, the new Necromancy and Thaumaturgy paths all in the greatest detail \npossible, while staying concise enough to fit in a trade-size book. \nI hoDe you like what you’re getting. Now that all is said and done, it’s hard to look \ne’ve produced and judge it impartially. So we leave it to you to decide, \nNut saying this: You’re sure getting your money’s worth! \neinig \n"

In this issue, howewer, I tackle some questions and issues about \nI \nthe world of LARPing in general, as well as some guidelines fm the Journal itself. \nHow do I get my LARP event \nlisted in the MET Journal? \nThis one’s pretty straightforward, \nthough I’ve never put the guidelines \ndown in an official format. Basically, \nwhat I’m looking for are World of Dark- \nness LARP events that occur with at \nleast monthly frequency. Your game \ndoesn’t have to be a Camarilla game or \npart of a large association, but it does \nhave to be aMind’s Eye Theatre World \nof Darkness game. Just e-mail submis- \nsions to me (carlawhite-wolf.com) in \nthe following format, and I’ll add you \nto the growing list: \nYour LARP’s Geographic Region \nYour LARP’s Title; the City and State you play in \nYour LARP’s Frequency (Avoid specific dates, as the Journal gets written \nYour Contact Person’s Name and an e-mail Contact Address \nYour Contact Person’s Phone Number \nmonths before you see it in stores.) \n(Oh, and put “MET Journal Event Horizon” in the subject line of your e- \nmail so my mail filters don’t choke or send it off to oblivion.) \n(How do I/can I) submit articles, stories and columns for publication in the \nMET Journal? \nI get this one a lot, and I must say I’m proud of the enthusiasm this little \nquarterly’s garnered already. If you want to pitch me an idea for a future article, \nhere’s what you do. First, check out the White Wolf web site (www.white- \n"

      "text": "wolf.com), go to the “Games” link and scroll down to the “Writer’s Guide- \nlines” link. Read through the part about submissions to find the Non-Disclosure \nAgreement. Print out a copy of that form, fill it out, sign it and mail it in. \nWithout this completed form, I’ve got to toss your submission in the recycle \nbin, so don’t forget it. \nThen, when you’re pretty sure I’ve gotten your NDA form, send me \nan e-mail with the title “MET Journal Article Query” or just “MET \nJournal Article,” and pitch me your idea. You can also snail-mail the \nsubmission, along with your NDA, to the address listed on the first page \nof the Journal if you like. \nIt’s best to send a query for article submissions first (“Hey, I had a great idea \nabout werebats in MET”), because I might have a similar idea already in the works, \nor I just might not be ready to place your piece yet. In either case, it’s better to ask \nfirst rather than send me a completed article only to find I can’t use it. \nAs far as specifics go, that’s pretty much it. I look for articles that convert \nrules from our tabletop books into live-action (please, query about these first) \nrather than completely new rule sets. I also seek out articles on the state of \nLARPing in general, outside the game. And, of course, you’ve noticed that I \nprint letters and event-listings as well, so if you want to see your name in print, \nby all means, get my attention. \nWhat can I do to get my LARP sanctioned by White Wolf? If I’m using \na variation of MET rules, can I still play? When is it okay to charge admission \nto my LARP? \nI put these questions together because I hear them all the time, and they’re usually \nasked in packs like that. And because I’m sure you want to know, I’ll make the official \npronouncement: \nYou can charge legally for a White Wolf LARP if you are using official \nWhite Wolf rules, books and item cards, and the only things you can photocopy \nand distribute to players are the character sheets. Adhering to these guidelines \nwon’t make a game an “approved White Wolf story-line” or anything like that. \nThat’s done through the Camarilla. These standards simply allow you to charge \nmoney for your events without violating our trademarks. \nDoes this statement mean you can’t run your game “based on White Wolfs \nWorld of Darkness” with its streamlined system or its house rules (or Mage rules \nor werewombats)? Nope; that’s not what it means at all. It just means that you \ncan’t charge folks an admission fee legally. So don’t panic. We won’t slay you. \n"

Sort ofa \ncross between a round-table discussion and a WWF cage-match, this is the place \nto hash out issues regarding Mind’s Eye from licensing to rule-brokenness to \nLARPing style. Give me your opinions, respond to opinions you see here, bnbe \nme just to get your name in print, whatever. Just keep it relatively clean, and stay \noff the bad side of the people you disagree with. After all, that keen-edged rapier \nwit is designed for each others’ arguments and opinions, not for each others’ \npersonal lives. \n(For the readers who aren’t clued in to how fast the publishing schedule \nmoves, let this letter column stand as a guide. Only now am I getting to print \nresponses to letters that appeared in the first issue of the Journal. For those \nof you who sent me mail concerning letters in the last issue, fear not - \nI’m \nnot ignoring you. As of publication of this issue, I simply hadn’t received \nthem yet.) For those of you just tuning in, a debate thread concerning two \ndifferent LARP games appeared in the first issue of the Journal. One \naccused the other of being a juvenile gore-fest that encouraged min-maxing; \nthe other accused the first of being overly complicated, thus hamstringing \nroleplaying. Our first outside contender, Matt Sullins, weighs in on that \nissue and others. \nWell, Carl, you asked for some personal opinions in the sidebar at the end \nof [“The Current Thinking” in the first issue of the Journal]. You asked, “HOW \nfar is too far before you lose the roleplaying and Storytelling aspects that make \nour games what they are?” My only thought here is that as soon as my players \nand I begin playing a game it is no longer yours. There is no such thing as “too \nfar” as long as we enjoy ourselves. The White Wolf Nazi Terror Squad is not \ngoing to break down my door and shut down my LARP. There is no reason not \nto play as the group sees fit. Mind you, I personally stand by the Big 6 rules in \nall of the Masquerade books. (While the White Wolf Nazi Terror Squad might \nnot stop you from breaking these, other groups, like the police, might. Keep \nthat in mind before you go biting some innocent teenager’s neck and trying to \nuse “Matt told me it was OK’ as a defense.) \nT\nH\n~\n \nC U R R E N T  THINK IN^ \nQ) \n\n\nFinally, I have a question of my own that I would like to throw into the \nring. Do other LARPers feel that their group should organize and encourage \ncharity work? I know that the Camarilla is in favor of this, and I have found it \nto be a good thing myself. I am just curious as to the opinions of others. \nHugs and Chainsaws, \n-Matt \nSullins \nHead Storyteller \nSeraphim Theater Troupe \n“Terror squad” indeed. Terror squads are sopuss. Everyone knows it’s \nall lawyers now. Anyway. \nI’ll keep this short and sweet. To solve this rules debate [from Issue #1], \ntake Liber des Goules, turn to page 16, look for the heading that says, “The \nOnly Rules That Matter,” and read. \nAside from that, if your troupe wants to incorporate wereparrots from \npost-apocalyptic Antarctica, go for it. It’s just a (damn great) game. \n-Robert \nDupuis \nWell then. Moving on, we come to Mark Lewis, a guy who (without \nhaving seen the second issue of the Journal, ironically) has come out with \nhis opinion on the Camarilla organization and One World by Night blazing. \nH e  also opines on the varying degrees of LARP maturity, as he sees them. \nBefore I begin, let me congratulate you on a good first issue. It was \nentertaining, well presented and didn’t suck. My one critique: is starting off \nwith “The True Black Hand” a device I have yet to see regarded as well liked \nby any of the local LARPs (or the glut of MUSHes I stop in at regularly). \nYour questions are interesting. Cam, Independent or Wannabecam (Le., \nOne World By Night)? Speaking only for the games in my area, that I have had \ncontact with, Indie appears the best. The Camarilla earned itself a bad name \nback in the early ‘90s with its - ahem - LARP. Unfortunately, the system of \n“buff stats for doing Cam organization stuff placed too much power in the \nhands of twits. The Storyteller staff felt the need to make each “episode” \n(episodic nature being a problem unto itself in my view) more grandiose than \nthe last. Why, in the first game I played, our opponent was an Unseelie Fae (a \nyear or two before The Shining Host, might I add) who had managed to kidnap \nthe Raccoon Totem. Oh yes, this is the subject of a Vampire LARP. My \nexperience with One Worldby Night andother “shareduniverse” groups is just \nas dismal. The few roleplayers that were present were dwarfed by the Rules \nLawyers, Stick Jocks Turned LARPer and Sixteen-Year-Old Cool Kids, none \nof whom had any idea what was going on. But the “Cam, Indie, Other” \nclassification system doesn’t hit the real issues. \n\n\nplot” is most important. The players are new to playing. They want to create \ncharacters who incorporate every cool little thing they’ve seen/read/heard/ \ndreamed. They see the letter of the rules and not the spirit. They consider a \nClan War to be that cluster-fuck-mass-combat that happens at the end of each \nand every one of their games because the boredom just has to be stopped. In \nshort, everyone has the drive to play and make a game of it, but they don’t yet \nknow the differences between MET LARPing and table top (or boffer weapons \nfor that matter). The combat wombats usually gravitate toward the fringes of \nthe game where no one will interfere with their challenges. The socialites will \nfind a dark comer and grope. The unsure will mill about, occasionally trying \nsomething that pops into their heads just to be doing something. And the \n“good LARPers” hide from everyone for as long as they can in the hopes their \nwell-thought-out character (who even has Flaws meant to build character, \nrather than to min-max points) can survive the night. This is the game where \narchons and justicars show up regularly because there “is just no other way to \nkeep control.” \nThe sophomore LARP comes about when the Storytellers or players (or \nsome of both) start to see the Story within the Game. The Storytellers try to \nmake some movement toward a coherent plot line that they hope is new and \ndifferent. They allow and encourage some player-driven plots, as long as the \nsanctity of “their plot” remains. They discourage the combat wombats by \nthrowing in some “heavy hitters,” designed just for that purpose. They start to \nprovide rumors based on Influences, and they encourage players to research \nsaid rumors to find plot. The players, in turn, place some thought into a new \ncharacter, with the emphasis more on character than min-maxing. The social \norder starts to develop, and primogen last more than a couple games, but there \nare still problems. Those one or two players who are better schemers then the \nStorytellers get stomped on “in the name of plot” cough - ego-bruised - cough. \nThe Storyteller’s roommate is the antagonist “since he knows everything \nabout the plot anyway”. The “fringe players” still can’t quite get involved \nenough, no one gloms on to them as the useful pawns they can be. Things still \naren’t right. \nThe senior LARP is a partnership between Storyteller and player. It is a \nseries of joint tales, told by everyone involved. Ego doesn’t rear its head much \nany more, the Storytellers encourage players who manage to outthink them, \nand they create fluid enough plots to compensate and entertain. Players make \ncharacters who need development, so they can find a personal story within that \ndevelopment. Combat is rare, but when it happens it furthers the story, not \nsimply kills an hour and 1/3 of the player base. The Storyteller’s plots are subtle \nand provoke emotion; they promote roleplaying rather than just existing as a \nthing to “discover and be amazed.” \nI have yet to see a senior game, and I’ve been a Storyteller at two separate \nLARPs. I’ve seen games come close but they always seem to fail in the end. And \nit’s due to that second question: Is this an invite-only game or open-invite? It’s \n\n\nalways that kid who’s a friend of a friend of a guy you work with, who shows up \nwith a bunch of friends and who are playing the freshman game, untended and \nuntaught. It’s the new Storyteller who, it turns out, has no clue but has to be \nin charge anyway. It’s the random factor of not knowing what new DNA is \nhitting the gene-pool this month. \nSo in my mind, the number of rules mean nothing. It’s the players and \nStorytellers that are using the rules that make the difference. \nWow, I really like this soapbox now, don’t I? \nLater. \n-Mark \nLewis \nLuchadore of Gehenna \nH e  sure does. Can anybody help me out on “luchadore” though? \nAnyhow, the next two letters jump track a bit from the previous discussion. \nThey deal with possible causes of sexism in roleplaying gaming (as opposed \nto “sexism in role-playing,” which is altogether different), from some people \nwho have been on the receiving end. Thanks to the “Conclave” mailing list \nfor sparking this topic of discussion. \nMost of the men in gaming have been playing roleplaying games for some \ntime now. They have been doing that playing with men, for the most part. That \nis the situation they are used to and it is somewhat strange to find themselves \nplaying with women now. But I think another factor could be the difference \nin styles of roleplaying between men and women. \n[Women] tend to play less aggressively (or at least less overtly aggressive) \nthan the guys do. Women also tend to care more about the roleplaying aspects \nof the game and having interesting in-game conversations than about maxing \ntheir points and having a heinous character. \nI know that I have been told that I don’t build my characters well. I have \nbeen told, with my points, I should have bought this and that and that over \nthere just to be a stronger more ‘efficiently’ built character. This player (and \nI think most of us may have an idea who might have said this) never considered \nthat I bought what I did for my character because it fit what my character was \ndoing in her life and then un-life. As her situation changed I bought different \nthings to help her not because it was a “good buy.” \nMy point in explaining all of that was that this player, and those like him \nwho believe in having the most solid player possible, do not have much respect \nfor me or my ability as a player when I don’t try to min-max. \nUnless you have an obviously strong character, you aren’t perceived as a \nthreat by the other characters. It’s true outside the game as well. Unless you are \nan obviously strong player, the others don’t go out of their way to play with you. \n\n\nAnd truthfully, it does get annoying to be treated as though the women \nin these games are merely there for decoration. This isn’t a ‘slight diversion,’ \nor a ‘cute hobby,’ for us, we are there to play and be involved. \nO n  the other hand, I do think that the women don’t tend to jump into the \ngame the way the men do. They often hang around the sidelines and wait to \nbe included, whereas the men tend to walk in and demand attention. \nAnd yet, when we do demand attention or stand up in a situation we \nshould be recognized in and they still overlook us, it gets harder to try and take \na stand the next time. Or the situation can occur that we try to stand up and \nget noticed, begin pushing to get noticed, and all the guys will do is think ‘bitch’ \nand then make it a point to not interact with our characters. \nIt just seems harder to strike that balance and gain their respect as a player. \n-Luciann \nWasson \nThe problem having been broached, another respondent on the same \nthread had this to say about where this brand of sexism comes from, as well \nas a thought on how to stem the tide. \nTrue, most of the guys spent the first formative years of their roleplaying \ncareers in hormonally swamped all-guy groups where the only females were the \nnefarious NPC succubi who attempted to lure their half-elf paladin fighter- \nmages away from the treasure caves. Our live-action games are (hopefully) \nmore mature and complicated, and they require more roleplaying skill than \nperhaps many of us have trained for. \nI think that men need the practice of seeing women as varied, three- \ndimensional fictional characters, and women need the practice of seeing (and \nexpressing) themselves that way. Let me give you a personal example: \nIn the process of my job search, I talked with a fellow from the Navy who \ninformed me that, with my qualifications, I was eligible for a nuclear physics \nprogram that could have me commanding my own nuclear-powered battleship \nwithin two decades. \nThe second most disturbing occurrence that I had to put up with upon \nrevealing this possible opportunity was that every male friend I told about it \nreacted with, “Awwww! Isn’t that cute! Although every time you give an order \nto fire, they’d just pinch your cheeks and pat you on the head!” - or something \nsimilar. \nThe most disturbing thing about it was that I couldn’t picture myself in \nsuch a job. It would take Xena or Demi Moore from G.I. June to do that - \nsomeone who could handle such a role. Not me. I would just get laughed at and \npinched on the cheeks. \nI wouldn’t call all of this “sexism,” however - \nthat label implies more of \na deliberate intent. I think that the situation of women in our live-action \ngames is more a result of the habits and social conditioning of both sexes as well \n\n\nas a side effect \ncan cure with \nof the low numbers of women who participate. \ngood storytelling, some you can't. \nSome of \n-Hannah \nCurry \nF U R T H E R  FUEL \nLet me hear from you! \nYou can e-mail your answers to these points or opinions on subjects of your \nWhite Wolf Publishing Inc. \nAttn: Mind's Eye Theatre Journal \n735 Park North Blvd. \nSuite 128 \nClarkston, GA 30021 \nchoosing to carl@white-wolf.com or mail them to: \nT H E  \nC U R R E N T  THINKING \n\n\nDFADCjUY SPFAKS \n- \nby Richard E.

If, perchance, you discover that the convention you want to \nattend is being held in a quote-unquote “Agricultural Center,” be aware that what they \nreally mean by that is “barn.” Actually, what they mean is “really big barn.” In the particular \ninstance from which I was able to glean this insight, “WesternNorth Carolina Agricultural \nCenter” was semantically equivalent to “Livestock Auction Building Off to the Side of a \nCollection of Big Barns.” In still other words, “Moo.” \nWhich doesn’t prove much of anything, I suppose, but it is good to keep in mind before \nyou traipse off to Asheville, or wherever. Now, where was I? \nOh yes. Elves in barns, and why it’s good to be one. \nThere’s been a slow but steady stream of mail into the office about the choice of books \nwe’ve put out for the Mind’s Eye Theatre line. These letters are about why some topics have \nreceived attention and others haven’t, i.e. why Wraith got translated early on, why \nApocalypse went out of print, why we haven’t printed one of the approximately four billion \nMET Mage submissions to come in and so on. And yes, all of these questions will be \nanswered in an upcoming column. Honest. There’s a method to this madness, and no, it \ndoesn’t involve a dart board or flipping a coin. \nIn any case, a repeated theme in this correspondence is a curiosity about The Shining \nHost. Some folks want to know why we did the book, because changelings are notoriously \ndifficult to integrate into Vampire LARP games. After all, they’re theoretically shiny and \nhappy, they don’t necessarily hang out at art museums after closing or trendy clubs at all, and \nthey have means of kicking a vampire’s ass that are both unexpected and very difficult to \nguard against. Others want to know why we did the book at all, or why we didn’t do it sooner, \nor why there aren’t nunnehi rules.. . well, you get the idea. But mostly, people are a bit thrown \noff by the fact that The Shining Host seems to stand in such opposition to Masquerade. \nSo let’s take some time and think about The Shining Host and what it’s good for. \n\n\nI admit that the concept of doing Changeling for MET was originally a daunting one. \nWhy? Well, for one thing, by the time the Mind’s Eye schedule got straightened out back \nthen, I had an appallingly short time to actually get the thing written. This is what we in \nthe business of putting games out there call a “panic situation.” Roughly, you want to leave \nat least two months’ lead time, preferably more (I try give a writer a month for each 20,000 \nwords of her assignment, although occasionally crises necessitate Herculean efforts to get \nthings in with little or no room to maneuver), before the first draft of a book is due, let alone \nthe final draft that goes into development. On a short book, like a Clanbook, you can fudge \nthings a little bit. On a longer book, you’re generally in trouble with less than three months’ \nlead time. O n  a huge book, like one over 200 pages, you need to set things rolling way in \nadvance or you’re liable to end up with a manuscript that is a.) too short, b.) written in fluent \nTagalog because your author burned out 47,000 words in and started typing with his nose, \nor c.) eaten by the cosmic ducks in transit. (Note: This third option is a polite yet delightfully \nwhimsical way of saying “never actually got written.”) \nFor those of you playing along with the home game, The Shining Host was a big, big \nbook. In other words, I was screwed. \nOr at least I would have been, if not for the intrepid, talented and entirely too eager \nPeter Woodworth, who had read the submissions guidelinesfor Mind’s Eye and decided that \na good old three-page submission wasn’t good enough for him. No, by gum, he was going to \nsend in his entire rules system for live-action Changeling for me to look at, and he was going \nto make sure I read every last word. Lucky for both of us that I was desperate, because the \npackage he finally sent was huge. \nI mean, I’d never seen a submission with a snow line on it. Acres of trees died to make \nthe paper for this thing. Two intems got hernias lugging it from the mail table. Mules gave \nup and died in the traces trying to haul it back to my office. I still had an office back then, \ninstead of a cubicle the color of the slime moldsrunning their own little Daytona 500 around \nthe inside of the company fridge, if that tells you how long ago this all was. \nAnd because I was able to scrape the last few pennies out of my karmic piggy bank, the \nsubmission was good. Perfect? Naaah - \nnothing’s perfect, as alt.games.whitewolf con- \nstantly reminds me. But did it have potential? Certainly. Could it be made universal in the \ntime we had! With a little luck, it could indeed. There was hope after all. \n(Side note: Peter is the sort of guy who makes me sick. I found out, after calling him \nup with a contract in hand, that he was all of 17. He’d written the whole kit and caboodle \nwhile attending high school, and he’d done it with a good prose style, an eye toward rules \nbalance and a healthy sense of humor. When I was his age, I was composing “Dear Sir, I \nalways thought the letters in your magazine were fiction until that night when I was viciously \nambushed by three voluptuous cheerleaders and a dancing bear” letters for publication, and \nanything longer than four pages was a moral victory. To make matters worse, he’s charming, \npolite, punctual and professional. Disgusting, ain’t it?) \nSo, the long and short of it is that, eventually, we got a book. It went through the usual \nplaytesting, editing, screaming, howling and gibbering phases that every book goes through, and \nit hit the shelves eventually. That, needless to say, is when the funny stuff started happening. \nBy funny stuff, I mean “weird even by the standards of this comer of this particularly \nunbalanced field of literary endeavor,” which is to say, pretty dam weird. Oh, there was the \nusual tug-of-war back and forth on the newsgroups (“I love it!” “I hate it!” “Duck season!” \n“Wabbit season! ”) and the usual hail of criticisms (some of which were warranted, and some \nof which weren’t), but there was also a significant undercurrent from folks talking about \nwhat they did at their Changeling LARPs. They didn’t stake the prince in the hallway three \ntimes before anyone brought out snacks. They did, however, have a lot of fun dressing to the \nnines and cutting loose - \nand they brought their kids. \n\n\nThat was important for me. As much fun as Vampire LARP is and as much as I enjoy \nit, it’s not the sort of place I’d ever feel comfortable taking my hypothetical children to hang \nout. Too much of the underlying dynamic is simply nasty - \nnot in the sense that the \ngameplay itself is nasty, but let’s face it. We’re talking about pretending to be a bunch of \npredators circling the same bloody half-pound of chuck roast in the water. That’s not \nnecessarily kid-friendly. \nThe Shining Host, on the other hand, is about wonder, at least to an extent. \nOccasionally, the game itself demands that you do something without an agenda, you have \nsome fun, you be creative for a bit. Mind you, it doesn’t have to be that way - \nif you want \nto run a Shadow Court game, more power to you. But it strikes me as a good thing that \nparents feel good about bringing their small children to Changeling LARPs and that those \ngames are perceived as safe, healthy places for those kids to be. \nYeah. Great. Whatever, right? What does that matter in the grand scheme of things? \nIt matters a lot, I think. By allowing folks to bring their kids along for a day of gaming, The \nShining Host opens up LARPing to people who might otherwise not have been able to do \nso. It’s one hell of a thing to try to find a sitter who’ll take care of Vlad Jr. until the local \nCamarilla game wraps up at 3 2 8  AM, let me tell you, and on-site vampiric daycare is pretty \ndifficult to come by. (No, this is not a suggestion; the insurance issues alone boggle the \nmind.) If you ask me, getting more people out there and playing, regardless of system, is a \npositive thing. \nAnd all of this brings me - \nby roads as roundabout as the highway that snakes down \nMt. Pisgah - \nto the topic mentioned in the title of the column: namely, why it’s good to \nbe an elf in a barn. \nRecently, I (along with the inimitable Jess Heinig -Go ahead. Try to nimit him. I dare \nyou.) had the pleasure of attending KarmaCon in Asheville, North Carolina. Yes, it was \nheld in a barn - \nwell, an Agricultural Center - \nand yes, there was a paint horse show \n(whatever that is) going on in the corral and large barns across the way. The convention was \nsmall, with all of the activities crammed into the livestock auction building. Still, it was an \nenergetic small con, with a healthy gaming track, a friendly and courteous con staff, a \nsurprisingly profitable charity auction and a LARP. Hoo boy, did they have a LARP. \nLet me preface this next section by saying that it is not for the faint of heart, the easily \noffended or anyone who believes that live action roleplaying begins and ends on the end of \na clove cigarette. What we’re about to dive into, ladies and germs, is the dreaded Elves In \nA Barn game. \n(Or, as noted by the inestimable David Bolack, a case of Barns and Nobles. Send the \nhate mail to me, and I’ll forward it to him.) \nBy all rights, the game shouldn’t have worked. Included in gameplay were, among other \nthings, a batch of Marauders who thought they were superheroes, a flying saucer, a \nbackwoods hick troll named Clem who worked for another changeling named J.R. (and yes, \nthe poor sumbitch did get shot so that everyone could ask “Who shot J.R.?” If you don’t get \nthat joke, you’re too young to be reading this.), an over-amorous cow and a six-year old \nUnseelie princess who got very annoyed when no one came to rescue her at various points \nduring the weekend. In other words, it was a mess. Sitting behind the White Wolf table, \ngazing down on the action, I could simultaneously see superheroics, high intrigue, down- \nand-dirty tussling and.. . em.. . umm.. . what Tom Lehrer once called “animal husbandry.” \nIf there was an actual plot, it was well-camouflaged. If there was a method to the madness, \nit escaped me. \nAnd you know what? The game was a rampaging, rollicking, foot-stomping saucer- \nlanding success. Nothing earthshattering happened, mind you - \nno Antediluvians woke \nfrom slumber, no Bastet Nagaraja Abominations with Mage spheres walked in the door, no \n\n\nno armiesofthe Risendead stormed the castle to get the WhosawhatLon. Folks just go; their \ncharacters, got hit over the head occasionally with assorted plot developments and had fun. \nAnd that, in the end, is why it’s a good thing to be an elf in a barn, or anywhere else, \nfor that matter. Not everyone digs the totally immersive roleplaying experience or needs the \npillars of Heaven to shake every time they play Rock-Paper-Scissors. Sometimes the best \ngame for a situation is low powered and freeform, and the hell with all the grand and glorious \nangst for a while. Come on, seriously, do you really think that a high-powered Masquerade \ngame, with elders and Machiavellian plots, would have worked terribly well in a livestock \nauction building? As good as you, I, or anyone might be at imagining the surroundings to \nbe other than what they are, there are times when you just have to go with what reality gives \nyou - \nand in this case, reality gave us straw, dirt and a faint, absurd whiff of horse. Trying \nto overcome the solid reality of the game’s surroundings would have taken too much effort, \nleaving too little energy for the game. \nAnd so, what we had was perfect for what we had. If the surroundings were a little bit \nwonky (and even the con staff admitted that things were a little goofier than they might \nhave expected), then we got a game that played up that attitude perfectly. Would things \nhave worked half so well were we not playing live action Changeling? Of course not :each \nsystem has its own strengths, but neither Laws of the Night’s nor Laws of the WildOs nor \nOblivion’s nor anything else’s rules play explicitly to the sort of wide-open, over the top \nfreedom that a Changeling LARP does. \nSo what’s today’s moral? Well, mainly it’s some sort ofmuttering about how picking the \nright game for the right circumstances generally leads to more fun for all concerned. \nReligiously strict adherence to a single system, no matter how much you love it, can force \nyou into some awkward gaming situations. Let’s face it, do you really want to try to convince \nthe local 900 year old Toreador to try to hang out in a barn for the duration of a weekend? \n(“What is that I just stepped in, Alfonse?” “Cow poopoo, mistress.” “Can we make art out \nof it?” “Sadly, no, mistress.”“Aieeeeeee!”) And let’s not even think about Apocalypse.. .(“Bad \ndog! Stay in the barn until you learn how to behave in the house! Stay!”). \nSo, in the end, if the hand you’re dealt calls for you to be an elf in a barn (or anywhere \nelse suitable, for that matter), well, take what you’re given and run with it. You might \nsurprise yourself by having one hell of a good time, whether you want to or not. \n(Oh, and for you filthv-mindedsouls who read all this way to find out about the ZOOM! \nI \n\n\nM € T  PROEILFS \nB I G  EISH, SMALL POND \nby Jess Heinig \nA DEVELOPMENT \nVIEWOE \nMIND’SEYFTHFATRF \nSo I had the job for all of three months. \nWhen I first showed up at White Wolf, I was slotted as the Kindred of the East \ndeveloper. The idea at the time was to expand Kindred of the East into a full line, \ncovering all of the mysteries of Asiatic vampires. I’d develop four books each year, \nand I’d also work as a co-developer for Vampire, handling maybe two additional core \nbooks per year. Since I liked Vampire, loved Kindred of the East and had a \nbackground in martial arts, Japanese history and Chinese culture, the idea seemed \nperfect at the time. \nA few development outlines later, we (meaning White Wolf) came to the \nconclusion that live-action games needed better treatment. To whit, Rich Dansky \nhad developed the last few MET books in addition to his usual development \nschedule for Wraith and anything else that needed the help. Now, Rich is no mere \nmortal, so he actually managed the Herculean task of pushing out quality Mind’s Eye \nTheatre books while working full-time on another line. Still, it had become clear \nthat the live-action game line needed a separate developer, someone to pay \nattention to the rapidly changing culture and rules. \nSilly me. I volunteered. \nWell, Kindred of the East got shuffled around to keep the books in develop- \nment, and I wound up with a new hat. Just when I got my business cards all printed \nwith “Kindred of the East Developer,” I changed over to working full-time on \nMind’s Eye Theatre. My first job: Salvage the manuscript of Laws of the Hunt, \nwhich was running late, short and choppy. \n“No problem,” I thought to myself. “I’ve always loved live-action, and I ran a \ngame of over 200 players. This can’t be any tougher than that.” \n\n\nSilly me twice - \nshame on me. \nA quick look over Laws of the Hunt showed me that it had the potential to \nwreak some serious live-action havoc -but \nin a good way. However, it needed a \nlittle push to fulfill that potential. So I tossed in some advanced True Faith. The old \nmaterial from Antagonists was, frankly, difficult to understand and of limited utility \nbeyond its basic powers, so I brushed up the various groups of hunters, giving them \neach a distinctive feel and a unique set of advantages. Next came equipment: Here, \nI pulled in all sorts ofnew ideas and material that had never been formalized, because \nhunters need all the combat tools they can get. I converted all of the Numina to a \n“two Basic, two Intermediate, one Advanced” power format (the uneven power \nprogressions from early MET books really get on my nerves). I even found time to \nadd to the Merits and Flaws section, sneaking in rules on the creation of ghouls, \nKinfolk and kinain characters with detailed character generation guidelines and \nspecial powers. (“What the heck,” I figured. “Liber des Goules didn’t have any \nExperience tables or Trait maxima, so I might as well address that.”) \nFrotn the base material by John Wick and Alison Young, I managed to draw out \na pretty dam good book. I even had a section that allowed games to update to the \nrules in Laws of the Hunt, so that players can avoid oversights from previous editions \nlike the famous “I spend Willpower to automatically win the Simple Test for staking \nyou, Mr. Vampire Elder.” I wrote in some controlled Military and Espionage \nInfluence, talked about the very cool Benandanti and managed some long-awaited \nupdates to mass combat, Willpower defense and retesting rules. Not bad for my first \nMET book! \nThen, ofcourse, came editing. The book wound up too long. Some of the powers \ncropped up with problems at the last second. The Dauntain had to go completely \nbecause there was no room and no time to develop them (don’t worry, they show up \nin a later MET book). \nMiracle of miracles, we managed to push the book to 184 pages (Heaven smiles \nupon our production staff), and it actually got edited and put out on time. The \nresponse was overwhelming: We brought 96 copies to a convention, and we sold out \nof them in an hour and a half. That’s a copy a minute. Wearing a big goofy grin, I \nsigned each one. \nWell! That wasn’t so bad. Pushing up my sleeves, I waded into the next project: \nThe Savage West (you’ll have seen it now as Laws of the Wyld West). I also got \nhanded the opportunity to start up the Mind’s Eye Journal, and I was looking at \nfuture releases- a follow-up to Laws of the Hunt, maybe some Kindred of the East \nlive-action and even (shudder) live-action Mage. \nThen, the Crash. \nWe all knew that the game market had been performing poorly. As a result, \nWhite Wolf had to reorganize. Several beloved members of the production, \ndevelopment, marketing and fiction departments wound up moving on to new jobs. \nAll of the development staff was in a frenzy, nobody knew who would get what job \nand the schedule flew into chaos. \nFinally, word came down that the staff had been cut considerably. New \npositions were to be assigned. I waited, barely able to breathe, for news of my new \nposition. Phil Brucato, developer of Mage for five years, had left the company, and \nhe’d picked me to succeed him! \n\n\nAfter 1 got over the initial shock, it was quite cool. \nSo, all in all, I wound up with only acouple ofMET books. I still think that Laws \nof the Hunt is an exceptional piece of work; I enjoyed it a lot and got to rework a \nlot of old MET rules that needed an update. Laws of the Wyld West is chock-full \nof gunfightin’ goodness; my only regret is that the 320-page monstrosity couldn’t \ncontain all of the Storytelling advice and setting notes written by the redoubtable \nPeter Woodworth, even after I cut it in size by a third! And, as this article shows, the \nJournal is off to a good start in the competent care of it’s current developer. \n(I paid him to say that. -Carl.) \nThe future of Mind’s Eye? That belongs now to Cynthia Summers. Ironically, \nCynthia was one of the first staffers to work on Mind’s Eye Theatre regularly. I must \nsay, Cynthia has her hands full. The Laws of the Hunt Players Guide revisits a lot \nof material from Laws of the Hunt, and it introduces wholly new addenda that \ncouldn’t be included the first time around, like the Dauntain. As for the rest of her \nschedule ... I leave that up to her to divulge. I’m the magic man, now, with the battle \nfor reality sitting here on my desktop. \nNow that I’m doing Mage, what does that bode for a live-action version of said \ngame? Nah. Never happen. After all, there are limits to wh \nAren’t there? \nT H E  N E w M € T  \nDEVELOPER \nSPEAKS \nby Cynthia Summers \nYO. \nNormally I can be found slaving away over a hot computer, but they’ve let me \nslip my chain for a little bit here, in between all the Mind’s Eye Theatre projects. \nWhat projects, you ask, could possibly keep me so busy that I can’t find time to \nanswer every question about live-action rules for a Malkavian-Nuwisha Abomina- \ntion with Chimerstry and faerie blood? Let’s see... \nKindred of the East -This book was shifted and turned around a little bit from \nits original spot in the schedule (hey, that was your idea, folks, though you don’t \nknow why yet), but it’s still on the stove and will be soup in 2000. It’s being written \nby the wondrously talented Peter Woodworth (The Shining Host, Laws of the \nWyld West). \nThe Camarilla Guide -New upper-level Disciplines, how to run a trial conclave, \nexciting uses for the various city posts and all the sorts of the things that make \nStorytellers’ eyes shine (and consequently, makes players tremble...). \nThe Sabbat Guide - \nYou didn’t think the Cammies were going to have all the \nfun, did you? New antinibu, new Paths of Enlightenment and all those extras to give \nyour antagonists that extra edge. \nThe Changing Breeds, Book 1 -The title is still in dispute, but it will be what \nit claims to be. This book can’t have everything (unless you want to haul the book \n\n\naround on a forklift inside a C-130 cargo plane), but we’re looking at rules for the \nCorax, Nuwisha, Bastet and Ratkin. The other critters will get outings in later books. \nLaws of the Night Revised- \nI’ll tell you about that elsewhere. [Seep. XX, in fact.] \nWhen I’m not developing the games, I’m playing them - \nI maintain two \nvampires, a Kinfolk, a mortal, a wraith and a nocker among the various games I play. \nI’ve played in independent venues and con games, and I’m a card-carrying member \nof the Camarilla (I’m also the one who gets to read all those Camarilla chapter reports \n-so make ‘em interesting, folks!). When I’m not playing White Wolf games, I help \nplot and run a fantasy-themed LARP local to the Southeast called Shattered Isles. \nPlaying these games gives me a perspective on what’s bugging players and \nStorytellers, what are legitimate gripes (or silly twinkery) and what will work (or \nwon’t) when I sit down to develop. And that’s why you’re not going to find a picture \nof me here. I not only develop the games, I’m a player, and I find anonymity best \nsuited to such pastimes. There is a collection ofpinheads, peahats and other assorted \nsmall minds who seem to think that rules-lawyering the developer, lecturing her \nmid-game about the viability of their own “positively guaranteed to work” Mage \nlive-action system or killing her character gives them bragging rights. Beware, fame- \nseekers - \nI write your kind into the books for the purposes of killing them in new \nand interesting ways. So behave - \nafter all, you never know where I may show up. \nI’m the sort of player who believes in the statement, “Rules schmules; gimme \nstory!”, and I take much the same approach to MET. I’m aware that rules are \nnecessary to keep things running, but I tend to slack off making rules regarding every \nlittle detail. Hey, it’s your story, after all. I’ll seed the books with story ideas and \nsuggestions for all the little peeves I’ve developed over the years (Tremere costuming \ndoes not include a nylon cape with all the wrinkles still in it), but in the end, it’s all \nto make things colorful for players and rife with juicy details for the Storytellers to \nhang their hats on. I find it far more satisfying (as a player and a Storyteller) to tell \nsomeone to look for the treasure after I’ve locked him in a haunted house and \ndropped the key down the well. \nAs both player and Storyteller, I’m the sort who wages continuous war on the \nlower forms of life that crawl into games occasionally. Having dealt with the press \nand disapproving public up close and personal on various occasions (such as the \nWendorff case) and endured the reign of terror that a single power player wreaked \non a chronicle, I want MET to be a game everyone can continue to enjoy. That \nmeans I’ll do what’s necessary to empower Storytellers to put the smackdown on \nmisbehaving players, talk to a curious parent or handle the Weekly World News. \nAnd in response to that inevitable question, my mother greets news of my work and \nleisure with the same bemusement that Buffy’s mother does when her daughter goes \nout slaying for the night. \nWhen I’m not LARPing, I’m sewing (which, nine times out of 10, is some \ncostume for LARPing), birdwatching, studying Middle Eastern dance, reading, \ncooking, walking or doing something related to my two cats. \nAnd that is what is worth talking about for now. \nTake care, \nCynthia Summers \n\n\nTHF SHADOW COURT \nby Peter Woodworth \nAnd people say changelings can’t be dark. Have you had enough of the \nbnght, shiny, spnghtly fae? Does the phrase “mercurialpooka trickster” make you \nwant to retch? If so, read on. These fae are the scum underneath the bottom of \nthe barrel, but worse, they don’t mind that one bit. They revel in their base, \nUnseek nature. Sound like fun? If it does, you’re twisted, vile and sick. \nWelcome, brother! \nNOTICE! \nThe following material is restricted to players and Storytellers who wish to include \nthe twisted members of the Shadow Court, the true embodiment of all that is Unseelie, \ninto their chronicles. All the Dark Arts, Thallain Kith, Unseelie Houses and new \nBackgrounds required to completely flesh out a Shadow Court character are, therefore, \nprovided. However, the transformation from a mere Unseelie to a member of the Shadow \nCourt is not so easy or so simple as marking a character sheet, and the White Wolf \nsourcebook The Shadow Court for Changeling: The Dreaming should be consulted \nin detail to fully realize the descent into darkness which accompanies the initiation into \nand advancement in this mysterious, ancient organization. In many ways, the Shadow \nCourt is the regular Kithain’s equivalent of the Sabbat - \nthough that’s a loose similarity, \nat best -- and it should only be created when players are ready and able to attempt the \nradical transition between fantasy and utter nightmare. Again, making a Shadow Court \ncharacter is not as simple as circling the Unseelie Legacy on your character sheet! Players \nare therefore advisednot to planonusing any of this information, or evennecessarily being \nallowed to read it, in any given chronicle, so unless thou be a Storyteller or have consulted \none first, go ye no further. It should be obvious by now that no characters outside the \nShadow Court possess any of the following powers or advantages (or are of the Thallain \nkith), and very, very few outside the Shadow Court have more than the tiniest bit of \nknowledge concerning any of the material below. If this wasn’t obvious before, consider \nit obviousnow. Ifyou have obtained such license, however, please, come in, make yourself \nat home, and let the nightmares and revelry begin ... \nTHALLAIN \nKITH \nThe following changeling types, known as Thallain to the few Unseelie of the \nShadow Court who know of them, represent degenerate types of some of the standard \nkiths. They are believed to have appeared only after the return ofthe sidhe in 1969, riding \nthe same wave from Arcadia, but from the other side of the tracks. They are physically \nindistinguishable from regular members of their “parent” kiths - \nif somewhat disgusting \n- \nbut they display very different Birthrights and Frailties. They also tend to express \nshocking thoughts and behavior patterns, even compared to their regular Unseelie \ncounterparts. They are thus used by the Shadow Court as secret weapons and closet allies. \nThey are assigned to cliques for specific and important reasons and they will not in any case \nbe found just wandering around. \nNote: Because they are so tainted by Nightmare, Thallain have no Seelie Legacies, \nand they can never get any. Instead, they have two Unseelie Legacies between which they \nalternate. (The difficulty is deciding what kind of bastard to be.) \nTHE \nS H A D O W  C O U R T  \n\n\nB E A S T I B S  \nLike their Kithain pooka counterparts, beasties display animalistic characteristics \nwhen in their fae miens. Beasties likewise share the pooka’s ability to change into a \nwholly animal form when out of sight. However, the similarity between beasties and \npooka ends there. Rather than any normal animal, beasties transform into horrible \ncreatures that defy description. And yet, these things’ terrifying appearence is but the \nslightest glimmer of the vile, deadly depravity that infests their dark hearts. \nAffinity: Nature \nBirthrights: \nBeastie Form: Like pooka, beasties can change into their monster forms while no \none is looking by spending 10 seconds of game time and a point of Glamour. The beastie \nform, however, does not need to be a real animal; in fact, it’s better if it isn’t. Players are \nencouraged to come up with frightening and bizarre beastie forms, but remember that the \nStoryteller has final say on what is allowed. Also note that even if a beastie can become \nasix-headedsnakedog, thisdoesn’t mean thatall the headscan thinkorattack-themain \nuse for the creature’s nightmarish form is to scare the bejesus out of opponents, not \nnecessarily increase fundamental utility. Beasties in their animal form receive a free \nIntimidating Trait and two other Traits of the Storyteller’s choosing. They must also take \nBestial x 2 and two other Negative Traits of the Storyteller’s choosing automatically. \nGaia’s Mercy: Within one hour of witnessing beastie violence, mortals will \nforget what they have seen, remembering only distorted stories of wild animals. This \ndistortion has no effect on Awakened creatures. \nFrailties: \nThe Hunt: All Seelie Kithain have an innate hatred of beasties, and they must \nmake a self-control check (usually a Static Mental or Social Challenge, with its \ndifficulty based on the nature of the scene - \nharder in times of conflict, easier in \npeacetime) to avoid attacking one on sight. If the Static Challenge fails, the character \nmay spend a Willpower Trait to avoid attacking, and its effects last for the rest of the \nscene. (The Seelie may, of course, attack later if he wishes.) However, this hatred \napplies only if the Seelie Kithain are somehow aware of the beastie’s true nature. All \nbeasties receive a permanent Bestial Trait, which can never be bought off. \nB O ~ ~ A R T S  \nImagine the worst aspects of a conniving thief combined with the cunning of a rat \nand the soulless self-absorption of a 1980s businessman. Now imagine what sucha thing \nwould be like if it were Unseelie, and you might have an inkling of what makes up a \nboggart. Sharing the strong boggan work ethic, the boggarts turn a greedy eye toward \ncorporate, political or even illicit hierarchies in modern society. Willing to buy, sell or \nuse anyone and anything necessary, the boggarts do whatever they have to in order to \nfurther their own malicious goals. \nAffinity: Actor \nBirthrights: \nIndustrious Comrades: Boggarts can perform physical labor in 1/3 the time it \nwould take normally, as long as they remain unseen. Furthermore, boggarts need only sleep \ntwo hours per day to remain rested, and as such, they often take two jobs in the mortal \nworld. Boggarts receive a free level ofFinance Influence to reflect this doubled income, and \nthis Influence can never be traded away permanently. All boggarts have a particular \nbusiness specialty, and they are two Traits up on all Challenges involving this field. (Pick \nthe Finance Skill and take a specific field, such as Accounting or Hostile Takeover.) \nPack Mentality: Boggarts have a knack for sensing others of their kind, and they \nwill often try to recruit normal boggans away from their Courts to serve them. They can \nsense an Unseelie boggan with a successful Static Mental Challenge, and a boggart can \n\n\ncall on his friends and recruit a band of his fellows once per story to alter, improve or \ndestroy a given location or situation by spending a Willpower Trait and making some \ncalls. It’s up to the Storyteller to decide if and how the other boggarts can help, but the \nresults should be devious and destructive, with an eye to the short term. It is assumed \nthat, in downtime, the boggart is helping his fellows in a similar manner. \nFrailties: \nGreed: When presented with an unguarded item of wealth, a boggart must make \na self-control check (see the beastie Frailty: The Hunt) to avoid stealing it. If he fails \nthis check, his fingers become sticky, putting him one Trait up on the Challenge to steal \nit but also leaving a telltale sign to characters who know of boggarts. \nCallousness: Boggarts cannot purchase the Social Trait: Empathetic, and they begin \nplay with the Negative Social Trait: Callous, which can never be bought off. They do not \nunderstand any social dynamics outside the corporate setting (though they understand that \none very, very well), and they should act this out as well as possible. \nBOGIES \nIn ultimate disregard for the evolutionary mistake that people represent, bogies \nappear as sad mockeries of human beings. They are often pale and bedraggled or flabby \nand pockmarked. In their fae mien, they resemble the worst depths to which a sluagh \ncould fall. However, their feeding habits are even more grotesque than their appear- \nance. Though not necessary for their survival, most bogies have developed a distinct \ntaste for some form of human fluid or secretion (be it sweat, bone marrow or mucus, \nto name a few). It’s rumored that their sluagh cousins hire these Thallain out for \nparticularly despicable jobs, but such claims are unconfirmed at present. \nAffinity: Scene \nBirthrights: \nSpawned In Darkness: Once per session/ day, bogies can vomit up a cloud of \nfoul, inky blackness, which puts them two Traits up on Challenges related to stealth and \nsilence because it disorients foes trapped within it as if they were blind. The cloud moves \nat the bogie’s discretion, about as fast as a human can walk. \nHatred of the Weaver: Bogies can spend a point of Glamour and become invisible \nto technological devices for one hour of game time. Mundane equipment malfunctions or \npicks up static, and even bright lights flicker on and off. Magically empowered treasures \nor fetishes may resist this Birthright with a Static Mental Challenge against the bogie. \nFrailties: \nCurse of the Weaver: There is an easy way to tell a bogie from a sluagh - \nbind him. \nBogies cannot contort the way sluagh can, and they lose one Health Level for each hour \nthey are so tied, followed by a loss of Physical Traits every half hour. When the character \nloses his last Physical Trait in this manner, he dies. Bogies cannot stand the thought of \nbeing confined, and they screech and cry and lose a Health Level for each day imprisoned. \nNote: Bogies do not need to whisper, though they can (and often do) in order to \nimpersonate regular sluagh. \nGOBLINS \nA riddle describing how to tell a goblin artiste from an Unseelie nocker: \nA: “Knock-knock!” \nB: “Who’s there!” \nA: “Open the door and find out!” \nA: “Uh, okay.” [B turns the doorknob. The doorjamb snaps closed like a toothy \nA: “Woo-ha!’’ \nbear trap, maiming B.] \nT H E  SHADOW C O U R T  \n@ \n\n\nI\nThe difference is that goblins have a penchant for creating devices of mayhem and \ndestruction out of physical items scrounged from nearby. Whereas Kithain nockers would \nuse chimerical means to create their masterpieces, goblins display their (misunderstood) \ngenius in whatever medium comes to hand. Such devices (be they exploding, glass-filled \nteddy bears or fishing rods that double as ranged cattle prods) are inherently flawed in \nsome way, but that makes them no less dangerous. \nAffinity: Prop \nBirthrights: \nMayhem: At the beginning of each story, a goblin can create a device capable of \nunleashing mayhem. Doing so requires a Static Mental Challenge with the Crafts or \nRepair Ability against a difficulty based on the complexity of the device created, the \nextent of the mayhem to becaused, whether it will inflict damage (and, ifso, how much) \nand the amount of time or number of tools put into creating it. The Storyteller should \nalways be present at the creation of such a device, not only to determine difficulty but \nalso to arbitrate the nature of the creation and its specific powers and requirements. The \nDreaming often hides such nasties in the guise of bizarre devices no one can figure out \nuntil the right time is reached. \nNote: Groups of goblins can combine their skills (shudder) on the Static \nChallenge and add one to the total for each extra goblin and for each level of the \nappropriate Ability being used. Note also that goblin devices can never have construc- \ntive results, only destructive ones. \nGremlin Urge: With the expenditure of apoint of Glamour and a win or tie result \non a Simple Test, a goblin can touch any mechanical device and cause it to malfunc- \ntion. Self-aware or empowered machines make this test a Social Challenge instead of \na Simple Test. If someone is holding the item in question and trying to defend it, the \ngoblin must also win a Physical Challenge in order to use this power. \nFrailties: \nDestructive Urge: Just like nockers, goblins always create flawed items; however, \ntheir flaws tend to be much more violent and destructive, and they sometimes even catch \nthe goblin in their unexpected results. Storytellers are encouraged to make full use of any \nfailed tests when goblins try to create devices, perhaps even convincing the goblin player \nthat the machine was created successfully after all ... \n\n\nOgaEs \nOgres are, by nature, the dumbest, meanest and most crude Thallain fae in existence. \nThey respect only physical strength, and they have all the social graces of a drunken half- \nwit boor at the end of happy hour. Well, almost all. What makes them useful (other than \ntheir prodigious strength) is their ability to ferret out Thallain from Kithain and Seelie \nfrom IJnseelie. What makes them dangerous (aside from the aforementioned strength, \ntheir extraordinarily deficient mental capacity and their “crush-kill-destroy” mentality - \nas if that weren’t enough) is the fact that they are all but indistinguishable from Kithain \ntrolls. Ogres don’t have much of a hand at infiltration, but an unwise Kithain’s first \nmistaken approach to an Ogre (“Noble sir, I seek your aid on a quest for the glory of the \nnoble baron, Geldeward N oh, do put me down!”) could well be his last. \nAffinity: Fae \nRirthrights: \nSmells Like Chicken: Ogres automatically sense the presence of other Thallain \ncharacters (the Storyteller should alert the player ahead of time as to who will be playing \nThallain and alert the player immediately if another enters later), and they can tell a Seelie \nfrom an Unseelie with a successful Simple Test. If they defeat a player in three consecutive \nSimple Tests, they can ask for a very rough overview of that character’s emotional state. \nStrong As Oaks: Ogres receive two free Brawny Physical Traits that can never \nbe lost, and they receive a free automatic retest on any Challenge that involves a \nstrength-related Trait directly (giving them quite an edge in most combats). \nFrailties: \nDumb As Rocks: Ogres are never the brightest chaps, and they face severe \nrestrictions on brainpower. They cannot choose Mental as their primary Trait category, \nthey may not possess more than one Mental Trait pertaining to intelligence and book \nlearning at the time of character creation and they buy any such Traits at twice the regular \ncost once play begins. Additionally, they must choose two permanent Negative Mental \nTraits, whichcannever be bought off, from the following list: Ignorant, Oblivious, Violent, \nShortsighted, Predictable, Gullible or Witless. \nN e w BAC \n~ c j  \nR O  u N D s \nThough the Shadow Court doesn’t recognize regular titles, it does have its own \nhierarchy, and many of its agents hold titles in the regular Concordian system, making \nit easier to spy on the Seelie and disrupt their proceedings. Thus, it is very possible to \npossess a high level of the Title Background in the regular court and very little Prestige \nin the Shadow Court or vice versa. The dangers of leading such a double life are obvious \nif the character is caught, but the rewards can be beyond imagining. And if you can’t \ntake risks, what are you doing on the dark side anyway? \nPRESTIC~F \nThe Shadow Court doesn’t recognize official titles, but it is possible to gain Prestige \nwithin the court. Trying to hold on to power and responsibility is seenas asking for trouble, \nbut stepping down occasionally is seen as a gesture of humility. A courtier probably doesn’t \nknow who stands more than one or two levels above her station, but she’d be foolish to \nexploit anyone below her. Prestige does not last longer than one year; if a changeling \ndoesn’t get promoted at Samhain, he loses at least one level of Prestige for the next year. \nIn fact, the court is always changing, and there’s no guarantee that a changeling can keep \nthis status beyond the first few sessions. It is a gocd indicator, however, of the level of \nrespect the character commands. Consider it your reputation, for better or worse. \nPrestige x 1: Condemned. You are firmly entrenched in the Shadow Court and \npermitted to learn secrets like the Dark Arts. You have forsaken your former life, even \ngiven a chance to return. If you do not have this level of the Background when play begins, \nT H E  S H A D O W  C O U R T  \ne \n\n\nyou must be given it by an lnstigator during Samhain to be a member of the court. Until \nthen, you are merely running with a clique. \nPrestige x 2: Guardian. Within your territory, you watch over an important location, \nanything from a freehold or glen to a gun store or chemical lab. You keep the various needs of \nlocal cliques supplied, and in turn, they respect your turf and protect your goods as best they can. \nPrestige x 3: Pretender. You hold a title within the Seelie or Unseelie Court, at least \nthat of knight or squire. This title gives you at least one level in the Title Background, as \nwell as a possible double life and the risk of being dealt with harshly if you’re caught. \nHowever, because you’re such a valuable informant, even anarchist cliques tend to leave \nyou be, giving you time to gather dirt on those above you as you rise to power in both courts. \nPrestige x 4: Mastermind. Certainly not everyone who plots and schemes has this \nlevel of Prestige, but changelings who have achieved it have literally made an art out \nof intrigue, and they tend to be visited often by Instigators in need of information. You \nare involved in a secret society of at least five members that trades favors freely. This \nclandestine involvement gives you three free levels of Influence (see Backgrounds) that \nyoucanuse (primarily Legalor Finance, but the Storyteller may modify this choice based \non the type and power of the society). You also receive regular rumor updates, and thus \nthe Storyteller usually has a few choice bits of dirt, in the form of gossip and other \nscurrilous sources you know well, for you when you begin a session. \nPrestige x 5: Instigator. You recruit others into the Shadow Court, although you \ncannot condemn them without learning the Advanced Contempt Art of Condemnatim. \nSlowly, you’re learning more about the hidden secrets of the court, and at least two cliques \nbrief you regularly on their activities. When you gather at least five Kithain for rituals, the \ndifficulty for outsiders to observe and discern the nature of the gathering rises by two (a two- \nTrait penalty on any related Challenges). If captured, you are expected to die rather than \ndivulge secrets, and ifyou are unwilling to do so, you will either be rescued or killed quickly \nby your fellows (have a nice afterlife). There are always Instigators more powerful than you, \nas well, who can overrule your authority, and if you begin to act as if you rule the cliques \nthat come to you, the backlash can be very nasty. As a function ofstation, you have at least \ntwo Masterminds working for and beneath you, although they are not your retainers and \nthey will not tolerate being treated as such. \nHOUSES \nAlthough these three Houses are certainly not the only options from which \nUnseelie fae may choose, they are the true Unseelie bloodlines and the only noble \nHouses yet found that lie squarely in the Unseelie camp. Being part of the Shadow \nCourt is not necessary for being a member of one of these Houses, but it is strongly \nrecommended, particularly for House Ailil and House Balor. Of course, commoners \nwho are affiliated with the House do not receive either the Boon or the Flaw of the \nHouse, just like the Seelie Houses. In no case will a character who is primarily Seelie \nbe from one of these families, although it is not impossible for anunseelie of one of these \nHouses to repent and become Seelie later in life. \nH O US E  AILIL \nThe sidhe of House Ailil -The House of Honeyed Words and Serpents’ Tongues \n-are \nrenowned for their Machiavellian plotting and firm belief in their own inherent \nsuperiority. They see the time of the Seelie as past, and they believe that only bold, \ndecisive (read: their own) leadership can save the Kithain now. They often promise \ncommoner equality, but they have no intention of pursuing it if their goals are met. \nMembers of this House are known for their dark hair and eyes, their compelling gazes \nand their choice of attire as black as the midnight lords they serve. In no case will a \nmember of this House ever be a happy underling of someone else; they’re always \nplotting, and frighteningly well at that. If a member of this House isn’t in the local \n\n\nShadow Court, you can bet she knows who is. Freeholds run by this House rend to be \nhotbeds of intrigue and politics that would make House Eiluned jealous of the intensity. \nBoon: Sidhe of this House are expert manipulators. They receive the Social Trait: \nBeguiling free, and they receive one free retest on all Subterfuge and Leadership Challenges. \nFlaw: Changelings belonging to House Ailil tend to believe too much in their fitness \nto rule, and they will take on tasks based on the belief that the virtue of their bloodline will \nallow them to succeed. They must make a Static Social Challenge to ever admit to doing \nwrong (difficulty depends on how serious the wrong is), even when it is obvious to all. If \nthey everbackdown fromasituation inwhich they havespent Influence,Challenged,cast \ncantrips, or otherwise become actively involved, they suffer a one-Trait penalty to all \nSocial Challenges until they gain some victory that restores face. They also must take the \npermanent Negative Social Trait: Condescending, which can never be bought off. \nH O U S E  BALOR \nThough others have forgotten, the sidhe of House Balor remember the time when \nsidhe mixed blood with Fomorians back in the Old Country - \nthey are the descendants \nof such unions. As such, members of House Balor bear some kind of deformity, be it \nphysical, mental, emotional or spiritual, and they bear bitter hatred toward their perfect \ncousins of the other houses. House Balor believes that the Endless Winter is almost here \nand that, if they can bring it on, they will be the ones chosen to lead the others during the \ndark times. This fatalism leads to many Balor becoming anarchists, but the ones who see \nbeyond such limited actions become dangerous fanatics with almost animal cunning. \nChangelings of this House also flirt with alliances with such Prodigals as Black Spiral \nDancerGarouand themodernday Fomori, and they delight inplayingwithironandother \nthings repulsive to changelings in general. Freeholds ruled by those of House Balor tend \nto be brutal domains in which everyone is out to get their own and keep it safe from the \nencroachments of others, very similar to the domain of wild animals. \nBoon: The sidhe of House Balor do not suffer from Banality’s Curse, the Frailty \nof most sidhe. In fact, they can handle cold iron without suffering any penalties, and \nthey lose no Glamour when struck by iron. This Boon allows them to carry and use iron \nweapons without penalties. If slain by iron, however, their soul is just as destroyed as \nany other changeling’s. \nFlaw: All of this House must take some kind of serious deformity or handicap, which \ncannot be rectified through prosthetics, psychological help, cantrips or treasures. Players \nare encouraged to work with the Storyteller to come up with strange and bizarre \ndeformities and to think beyond mere physical grossness to the possibilities ofhaving more \npoetic deformities like being born utterly without a conscience. Unlike the namesake of \nthe House and his evil eye, however, this deformity gives these changelings no special \npowers. Note: Members of House Balor must take either two permanent Negative Traits \nor a Derangement of some type, which can never be bought off, related to their deformity. \nIfthedeformity isrepresentedbyanexistingFlaw, they may take the Flaw, but they neither \nreceive compensation for it nor can they buy it off. No member of House Balor can have \na Willpower higher than 4 Traits, for any reason, as aresult of their savage Fomorian blood. \nH O U S E  LEANHAUN \nThis House keeps itself a close secret, for the most part, for the regular society of \nConcordia carries a noted dislike for them and their Glamour-hungry ways, which \nsometimes conflict with their powerful need for mortal inspiration. Without Glamour, \nchangelings of House Leanhaun age rapidly, growing one year older per week they spend \nwithout Rhapsodizing someone (see The Shining Host, p. 195, for details on Rhapsody) \nand thus also going from childling to wilder to grump in a painfully short period of time. \nThey are noted artists, and some hold positions such as Court Bard in unsuspecting \ncourts, but their power at causing mortals to create masterpieces, then die, is kept quite \nT H E  SHADOW C O U R T  \n\n\nsecret from such outsiders. Members of Leanhaun want to he safe from persecution, and \nthey feel justified in the damage they do, as it comes from a need to survive. Many of \nthem, in the greatest tragedy of all, even come to care for the mortals they doom with \ntheir touch. Freeholds ruled by this House tend to be places of great art but greater \ntragedy, with many avant-garde forms mixing with traditional works, and the mortals \ntend to be recycled quite often as the house’s infamous Glamour-hunger strikes. \nBoon: All members of House Leanhaun receive the Social Trait: Seductive, \nwhich can never be permanently lost, for free, and they are two Traits up on any \nChallenge during which they bid a Trait related to appearance or sex appeal. Flaw: \nLeanhaun age at a rate of one year per week unless they engage in Rhapsody at least \nonce during each week. This aging can be reversed and make the sidhe young again, \nbut only with greater and greater infusions of Glamour, which do more and more harm \nto the mortal being Rhapsodized. They also do not age gracefully and must take a \nNegative Physical Trait), which can only be bought off by changing back to a younger \nstate, each time they change seemings (childling, wilder, grump). \nDARK \nARTS \nThe following powers are Arts known only by members of the Shadow Court; \nalthough some have toyed with the idea of allowing outsiders to learncontempt as a way \nof undermining the sidhe nobility, no one is allowed to take this debate past the realm of \ntheory yet. After all, these Arts are the result of 600 years of secrecy and practice, and the \nShadow Court is in no hurry to lose its edge now with a hasty gamble. \nCONTEMPT \nThough Unseelie nobles have been known to use the Sovereign Art, some have \nchosen instead to counter it using their knowledge of the Art ofcontempt. Commoners \nhave also found it very useful when avoiding the dictates of the fascist Seelie sidhe, and \nit is true that this Art counters the effects of Sovereign on almost a one-for-one basis \n(with the exception of Weaver Ward, which is countered by Wayfare instead), which \ncauses rulers no end of frustration. \nType of Challenge: Mental \nArt Note: Though many uses of this Art invoke feelings ofbitter resentment and even \nviolence against traditional authority, players must still respect the rules of live-action and \nnot actually harm anyone or anything - \nthe “no touch” rule applies to one and all, even \n(especially) municipal buildings or classrooms that may be the targets of Contempt. In \naddition, unless the game is taking place in private, where everyone knows what’s going on, \nremember to keep your voices low and your language clean enough to avoid being given a \nticket or the boot from your locale. Finally, no use of Contempt can ever make the players \nrevolt out of character against the Storyteller (nice try, guys)! \nBasic \nMockery: This Art allows a changeling to directly avert the effects of Protocol from either \nherself or others, as the Realms used dictate. Once the Protocol is about to finish its casting, the \ncharacter casting Mockery must engage in a Mental Challenge with the person casting Protocol \nin addition to performing a Bunk - \nsuccess indicates immunity to the effects for the duration \nof the proceedings. The caster is considered anumber ofTraits up equal to the level ofthe Bunk. \nNote that the person Challenged will not necessarily know who is attempting Mockery unless \nthe Bunk performed is so obvious that they can put one and one together right away. This Art \nallows for a wide range of normally unacceptable behavior on the part of the changeling, from \nimmediate duels to grandstanding and interrupting the monarch. However, most fae will not \nsee anything odd in this, as the caster, after all, is almost always publicly Unseelie anyway. If \nMockery is cast without intent to counter Protocol, it becomes instead a twisted version of said \nmagic, allowing for a barbarian court of Unseelie law. Essentially, the ruler is allowed martial \nlaw over the changelings present, including Seelie fae and other bystanders. \n\n\nRealms: You have many different choices when deciding how to disrupt or ent’orce \nyour own court. Note that a fae can only attempt one of these cantrips at the beginning \nof the proceedings; any later and the cantrip will fail. \nDisobedience: An individual affected by this cantrip will show flagrant disregard for \nauthority for the remainder of the scene. It will not cause anyone affected to assault authority \nfigures physically, but it may result in acts of violence if the individual feels that he is being \nput down by the Man, so to speak. Once this cantrip has been cast, logical arguments seem \nhollow, and warnings or dictums against certain behavior seem offensive. Because so many \npeople in the modem world harbor such resentment, the target may only cancel the effect \nwith a Willpower Trait if this cantrip is successfully cast. If a noble is nearby, this cantrip may \nbe used to counteract the Basic Sovereign power, Dictum- the character must take his target \naside and give her a few choice words of encouragement about her rights (roleplay this out \nto the fullest), followed by the casting of the cantrip. The level of the Bunk used in the casting \nis added to the target’s Traits for the purposes of resisting Dictum, and this power allows the \ntarget to spend Willpower to ignore the effects of Dictum even if she would not be allowed \nto do so normally. At the Storyteller’s discretion, this cantrip may be used to counter powers \nof Prodigals (vampiric Presence or certain Garou Gifts, for example) in a similar fashion. \nRealms: Actor and Fue are most useful, but inventive revolutionaries can find ways \nto utilize the other three. \nIntermediate \nInsolence: Insolence can be used to inspire large groups of people to riot. This \npower is useful when emotions are already hot and heavy (like raves, rock concerts and \nlynchings). For each level of Bunk used, one person can be goaded into attacking \nsomeone or something else (unfortunately, you can’t decide exactly what the target will \nbe!). Anyone targeted can spend a Willpower Trait to enter into a Mental Challenge \nwith the caster (no Traits risked) to avoid these effects. This cantrip can also be used \nto negate the Sovereign power ofGrandeur. Only one Shadow Court fae can attempt this \nper scene, however, and if he fails, you’re all screwed. If used to counteract Grandeur, \nthe fae must make some remark or take some action that would detract from the \nseriousness of the noble’s power, then cast the cantrip. Each Bunk Trait gained allows \none person present to make a Simple Test against the user of Grandeur, with success \nmeaning that the target is immune to all uses of Grandeur for the rest of the session. \nRealms: Determines who will riot or what will be rioted against by the affected parties. \nDevil’s Advocate: A fae using this magic can convince a crowd of just about \nanything for one scene, after which the affected parties may realize what has happened \nto them (though only Awakened beings will realize that anything \noccurred). Instead of a normal Bunk, however, the character must make a speech \nexplaining the position he wants the crowd to take. After that, the fae must spend a \nWillpower Trait and make a Static Mental Challenge against a difficulty equal to one for \nevery two people he wishes to affect. This limit can be made one per every three with the \nexpenditure of an additional Willpower Trait. If the changeling is successful, the crowd \ncan be convincedof almost anything the character desires, and it will remain so convinced \nfor one hour of game time. This magic may also be used to counter aGem cantrip cast by \na noble. If the Unseelie is present at such a casting, he may use this Art (once again, with \na speech about why the Gem should be reconsidered) to try to make the noble reconsider. \nDoing so doesn’t absolutely cancel a Gem, but it does at least buy time. \nRealms: Actor and Fae are the only way to use the first part of this magic. \nAdvanced \nCondemnation: This magic is the unholy ritual of the Shadow Court, and it is always \nused in elaborate ceremony, as it defines an individual’s prestige in the Court. At Samhain, \nonly a few people, called Instigators, are considered worthy of learning this magic. Many of \nthese ceremonies are protected by the Mists, and even some of the participants will forget \nT H E  S H A D O W  C O U R T  \n\n\nmuch ofwhat occurs, remembering only in their subconscious minds what they are and what \nthey have to do. This power can also be used at other times of the year to recognize a clique, \ncast someone from the Court or recognize someone’s worthiness to learn the Dark Arts. The \nperson using the cantrip in this fashion always wears some sort of mystical disguise. \nCharacters to be Condemned for the first time must renounce all former ties, perhaps even \noaths, and give themselves fully to their Unseelie sides. There is no coming back. \nRealms: Determines who is affected by the ritual or its protective Mists. \nDELUSION \nThe Mists themselves have been usefull allies of the Shadow Court. Unseelie \nchangelings hide in a fog of doubts and uncertainties, of half-truths and insecurities. \nPerhaps the world recognizes that there must be a balance to all things and that the great \nevil of the Shadow Court would tip the already suffering world completely out ofbalance. \nType of Challenge: Social \nBasic \nInnocence: Hiding secrets and faces is a valuable ability, and this Art allows the Shadow \nCourt to plant agents with secrets foul and hideous among their ever-trusting Seelie brethren. \nThe simplest way to keep a secret, of course, is to act like you have no knowledge of it \nwhatsoever. This Dark Art masks any outward signs of recognition regarding one particular \ntopic or secret, making it extremely difficult for others to pry this secret from the character or \neven detect that he has it. The way it works is quite simple - \non all Challenges related to \nkeeping the secret, the character is up a number ofTraits equal to the number of Bunk Traits \ngained in the cantrip casting. Thus, if someone is using a SdmjLge Challenge to try to break \nyour character with interrogation, and you cast a three Bunk Trait Innocence cantrip, you are \nup three Traits on the Social Test required for the interrogation. This effect lasts for one day \nor night, and it must be renewed each interval to be effective. Note: The aura of a character \nusing this Art appears innocent to characters using Aura Perception and similar powers. \nFacade: This Dark Art allows the changeling to adopt a very effective disguise for a period \nof time, although her actual body doesn’t change, merely others’ perception of it. You must \nperform a Bunk related to changing your appearance (like wearing a mask, donning makeup or \nchanging clothes), then spend a Glamour Trait. The result is a disguise that lasts for one hour. \nThis time may be extended by expending an additional Glamour Trait per hour, but no more \nGlamour Traits may be spent this way than the number of Bunk Traits gained in casting the \ncantrip. If the disguise isn’t exceptionally hard to maintain (ooh, a video store clerk) or doesn’t \nencounter much strenuous activity, this time can be lengthened to one day per Glamour Trait, \nbut at the Storyteller’s discretion only. This disguise cannot be broken by powers like Heightened \nSenses (because it fools witnesses’ minds, not their physical perceptions); only someone who is \nactively suspicious of you for some reason or another may attempt to pierce the disguise, and he \nmust defeat you in a Challenge of his Mental Traits against your Social Traits. No matter what, \nyou can never adopt the same Facade twice. Other Realms may be used in connection to this \ncantrip as the caster sees fit. Using the Prop Realm might mean the disguise lasts as long as the \ncharacter holds a particular item, whereas Scene would dictate where the disguise can be adopted. \nIntermediate \nMists of Memory: The Mists are not always as objective as the Seelie would like \nthem to be. A disreputable fae may manipulate the Mists to cloud the minds of others \nand banish specific memories, but this Dark Art can never overcome certain things like \nthe loyalty of a troll, the chivalry of asidhe, an oath, a geas or true love. The caster must \nengage the target in a Social Challenge that, if successful, allows her to remove a broad \narea of memory determined by the number of Bunk Traits gained in casting, as \ndetermined by the following scale: \n1 Trait: memory of what was said in the last 15 minutes \n2 Traits: all memory of what happened in the last 15 minutes \n\n\nI \nI \nI \n3 Traits: memory of what happened in the last hour \n4 Traits: memory of what happened in the last session or day \n5+ Traits: any one memory, completely. \nThe Realm used in casting determines who is affected or what the memory concerns. \nThe Depths of Will: Although difficult to enact, this Dark Art can convince one \nwilling listener to undertake an enterprise that is not directly harmful to him and then \nforget about that activity afterward. (“You must take this to the duke. It’s important.”) \nIn addition to any other Bunk used, the cantrip must include an explanation of why the \nactivity is important (this does not need to be true, but it must be believable), which \ntakes at least five minutes of game time. If the listener is still willing, he must do it; if \nhe wishes to resist, he must spend a Willpower Trait to do so. Once the activity is \nperformed, the Mists erase all memory of it from the target’s mind (like vampiric \nMesmerism from Laws of the Night). \nAdvanced \nThe Darkest Heart: This power is as serious as Geas, and it is not undertaken lightly. \nSome undertake it of their own free will, whereas others (like weak Seelie) are condemned and \nforced into it. When a changeling performs an act, willingly or otherwise, that she later regrets, \nshe may come to terms with it by going on a quest, which hides the act in the darkest depths of \nherheart.Shecannotspeakofitunti1 thequest isover, andthememoryishiddenuntilthenext \nSamhaii comes around. The fae gives herself totally to her Unseelie nature, but she will retain \nthe memories, though hidden, of the incident that drives the quest, and they cannot be taken \naway by any means. Ifshe repeats the sin, wittingly or not, for which she was questing, she gains \na p e m e n t  Banality Trait and the quest is over. As long as she doesn’t violate that restriction, \nshe may confess to an Instigator at the end of the year. Until that time, she is under a Ban on \na paaicular Realm. If she succeeds at going the year without breaking her Ban or repeating her \nsin and then confesses to an Instigator, she will lose a permanent pint of Banality as the guilt \nrises from her heart and she is forgiven. This is an epic journey, even if it is one into darkness, \nand it should be treated accordingly. The Ban a character suffers must be related to a particular \nRealm that has some relation to her quest, and it should be fairly difficult to uphold: for example, \na lecherous fae seekmg to undo the damage done by a heartless nyst might be under an Actor Ban \nnot to associate with members of the opposite sex. \nT H E  S H A D O W  COURT \n\n\nCORRALLINCj P R O B L F M  \nby Charles Bailey \nIf you keep up with Rich Dansky’s “Deudguy Speaks” \ncolumn, you’ll likely note that his piece in the June issue \nof the Journal and this article are rather similar. \nThat’s no accident. Whereas Rich raises the \ninteresting (and humorous) quesnon of who \nthese people are and how to identify them, it can \nbe difficult sometimes to know exactly how to \ndeal with these problem players How do you \nkeep a person who’s only trying to have a good \ntime from raining on the other players’ parade? \nMaking sure everyone enjoys himself can be a tncky \nsituation, so Charles (another long-time LARP en- \nthusiast who work for White Wolf) steps up with \narticle to gwe some suggestions on how it’s done. \nEveryone has a story about someone who made his playing or Storytelling \nexperience anything from a boring snooze to a hellish nightmare. Sensing a subject \nfor the MET Journal, I’ve been taking notes on the different types ofproblem players \nmy friends and fellow garners have encountered, with an eye toward how to mitigate \ntheir negative (if unintentional) influence. After many cups of coffee, these \ncategories made the best of the worst. \nCOMBAT \nMONSTER \na.k.a. Twink, C ~ ~ ~ S U W ,  \nPoint-&-Click \nThe Combat Monster tends to be the by far most common type of problem player. \nThe typical goal of a Combat Monster is to build the strongest, fastest and most \ninvulnerable character in the chronicle. In his world, problems are best solved in a flurry \nof Celerity and Potence; he has little time for political maneuvering. If left unchecked, \nthe Combat Monster can turn a chronicle into the monster of the week special. \nThis is not to say that all characters with Physical Traits primary are Combat \nMonsters; most are not. The distinction lies in how the player portrays his character. \nIf he tends to run roughshod over other players and Storytellers just for the thrill of \ncrushing, breaking and stomping anything in his path, chances are he’s a Combat \nMonster. If you look into the world of a physical character’s motivation and find a \nvast, arid desert, those chances get even better. \nThere are several ways to handle a Combat Monster. The easiest one is to create \nopponents who can beat him at the physical game. Doing so has the advantage of \nshowing the player’s character that there are things in the World of Darkness that \ncan defeat even him; however, it tendsnot to teach him (or his player) anything. The \nTougher Bad Guys tactic usually backfires when the player decides that he needs to \nbeefup his character’s Disciplines or Abilities to defeat this new threat. You’re then \nleft with a virtual arms race that has the potential to lay waste to the chronicle’s plot \n(and its characters). \n\n\nAnoi.her way to control on the Combat Monster is to find a way to pair him with \na Storyteller character who is primarily a social or political figure. Typically, this \ntrick takes the form of making the physical character a bodyguard for the Storyteller \ncharacter (“I heard you’re the baddest SOB this side of the international date line; \nI need somebody like that in my organization.”), but it’s not the only way. Suggesting \nthat he be moved into a position of law enforcement within the game could easily \npair him with investigators and judges working to uphold the laws of their society, \nfor instance. This pairing tends to give Combat Monsters interaction with other \nplayers without undercutting the player’s usefulness as a physical powerhouse. \nFinally, a Storyteller can present the Combat Monster with problems that \ncannot be solved by brute force alone. Making him the target of a mysterious agency \nwith a hidden motive (like a cult, a government operation or a criminal ring) that \nmakes its moves from the shadows, for instance, forces the Twink to examine the \nsituation, determine why he’s such a star all of a sudden and possibly seek out \nassistance from other, less physically intensive characters. Again, this sort of idea \nredirects the Combat Monster’s enthusiasm and keeps the player happy while \nallowing you to refrain from tossing bad guy after bad guy mindlessly into the \nchipper-shredder that is his character. \nRULES LAWYER \na.k.a. Poindexter, Page Slave, Windbag \nEveryone who’s played live-action games (or any sort of roleplaying game) more \nthan a few times knows a Rules Lawyer. This is the guy who seems to have memorized \nevery line in the rule book (any rule book) and is quite happy to point this fact out \nwhen challenged on a call. He will tell anyone who cares to listen (or who is awake) \nthat he understands the letter of the rules and that, if you do not accept his \ninterpretation, you must be mistaken and should reread the rules until you come \naround. This type of player believes \nthat the most important aspect of the \ngame is strict adherence to the rules. \nThe rules are control. The rules are \npower. All hail the rules! \nFor players, the problem with the \nRules Lawyer is that he might give \nrulings that run counter to house ex- \nceptions and corollary changes the \nStorytellers have made to the specific \nchronicle’s rules. Though it’s all well \nand good to have a single source of \nreference for any game you might go to \n(like Laws of the Night, for instance), \nexpecting every Mind’s Eye Theatre \nchronicle to function by the letter of \nthe rules is incredibly idealistic at best. \nOne way to avoid this particular \nproblem is to provide players with a \nwritten set of house rules to cover any \nareas that differ from the standard \n\n\nMind’s Eye Theatre rules. Doing so helps cut down on misunderstandings, and it at \nleast gives Rules Lawyers the right rules to pore over. \nThe other problem Rules Lawyers cause is simple social annoyance. Nobody \nwants to have a fellow gamer breathing down his neck, making sure his actions \nadhere to what’s written on page XX of a book that’s been out of print since time \nuntold. Though the Journal isn’t exactly a resource for dealing with annoying \npersonalities, a helpful bit of advice in dealing with such a person is that it’s \nimportant to remember that even a Rules Lawyer has his positive side -namely, he \nknows his stuff. Therefore, this player can actually be an asset to the Storytellers. If \nhe shows that he understands the house rules and can be trusted not to make calls \nthat run counter to them, ask him to assist you in the role of a Narrator. That is, \npromote him so he’s not causing trouble at the grass-roots level and get him on your \nside. In doing so, you gain someone who understands the rules and can make the \ngame run more smoothly, and the player gets to demonstrate his grasp of the rules \nby helping to run scenes and challenges. \na.k.a. Knowitall, Guru, Oracle \nLOREMASTEE \nWhereas the Rules Lawyer seems to know the rules, the complete rules and \nnothing but the rules, the Loremaster seems to know everything about the setting \nof the World of Darkness, regardless of whether his character knows anything. This \nperson has probably bought every item ever published by White Wolf (even \nInphobia), and he is not afraid to let his character use any knowledge contained \ntherein. His character seems to be able to spout off details about creatures, events or \nAbilities that he has never come across in the course of your chronicle and about \nwhich his character history would have revealed nothing. (Alternatively, he could \nhave an impossibly outlandish charac- \nter history in which the great secrets of \nthe World of Darkness were revealed \nto him. You know that Gangrel in your \nchronicle who knows all about the \nBlack Spiral Dancers, Fomori and Banes \nJust because he “ran with the Garou for \nyears” before coming to your town? \nThat character is probably played by a \nLoremaster.) \nThis player presents a problem for \nany Storyteller who wishes to add a bit \nof mystery to a chronicle. Let’s face it: \nThere is nothing worse than introduc- \ning a mystery element (like a True \nBrujah or Siberakh) and havingachar- \nacter know all about it as soon as it \ncomes into play. \nFor the players, the Loremaster \nruins the game’s atmosphere and ten- \nsion because he robs them of the \nchallenge of finding clues and solving \n\n\nmysteries during play. How? The Loremaster already knows the answer, and his \ncharacter shares. Loudly. \nThe easiest way to handle this problem is to establish a system of Lore levels (as \nJess Heinig has done on page XX of this issue of the Journal) and hold characters to \nthe amount ofknowledge eachlevel. Thus, if the Loremaster’scharacter does not have \nthe appropriate Lore, the character cannot utilize the player’s out of game knowledge. \nAn interesting way to handle this problem in game is to assign negative Status \nTraits (like Insane) to characters who spouts such unfounded information. If this \nbehavior continues despite the Trait penalty, nothing teaches a loud-mouth \nLoremaster to keep his “insights” to himself more effectively than having angry \nrepresentatives of the group whose secrets the character is spreading come calling. \nM I N - M A X E R  \na.k.a. Calculator, Twink v. 2.0 \nNo matter what name this player goes by, the theory is the same - \nget the most \nbang for the smallest Experience buck. She believes that the stats on her sheet are \nthe true measure of her character’s growth, usefulness or longevity. If she spent half \nas much time fleshing out a history as she did with coming up with her stats, she \nwould have a well-rounded character, one she’d probably have loads more fun \nplaying and developing. Although the Min-Maxer’s preferred M.O. mimics the \nCombat Monster - \n“I need lots of Potence and Cekrity so 1 can do my Malkavian \npranks without fear” -you will also find such such derivatives as the Tremere Giga- \nRitualist, the Toreador Majesty Maven and the (ever-popular) Former Gangrel \nGhoul Recently Embraced by Clan Tremere. \nPlayers may have some problems dealing with Min-Maxers on the roleplaying \nlevel because of the Min-Maxer’s lack of character depth. There are few things worse \nthan trying to roleplay with a person who cannot tell you anything about her \ncharacter other than what Abilities she has or how many Traits she can bid. \nStorytellers also tend to have problems building plots for the Min-Maxer. It is \ndifficult to create gripping, meaningful situations for a character who does not have \nany sort of a past or any discernible motivations. The Storyteller can help the player \nflesh out the character at character creation by requiring some sort of history or \noffering to help the player develop some goals for the character. \nT H E  \nE U D ~ E R  \na.k.a. The Hedger, The Liar \nOh, yes - \nthe Fudger. This player always seems to have the right trait or skill \nfor the job, even if it’s not on his character sheet. Fudger is a kind nickname for this \ntype of player; in most arenas he would be called a cheater. \nHonest players suffer at the hands of this problem player when they make \nChallenges because they will take the Fudger at his word about the skills he possesses. \nAfter all, it’s insulting to ask a fellow player to whip out his character sheet just \nbecause he seems to be bidding better than you. The Fudger’s usual target is a newbie, \nbecause more experienced players tend to recognize when he is fudging. \nThis type of problem player is the one which the Storyteller should be the most \nstrict. MET is a game system built on trust, and the Fudger violates that trust, \ndamaging the game for everyone involved. Take care in handling this type of player; \nreact too harshly, and you’ll lose a player (after all, most Fudgers either fudge by \naccident or out of a misguided desire to avoid breaking the flow of the story). React \n\n\ntoo leniently, however, and your chronicle tumbles out of control. In confronting \na Fudger (or any problem player, really), remain calm, present the problem fairly and \ngive him the benefit of the doubt, but make it clear that further incidents of that \nnature will be dealt with severely. \nCLIQUE \nCLONES \na.k.a. Replicants, Thelust-Us League \nWhereas most problem players are individuals, this type is a group. Clique \nClones tend to design characters that depend upon the pack mentality and sheer \nnumbers to accomplish their goals. Such a concept is not a problem in itself- it can \neven be an asset if the group works within the system to further the story - \nthings \ntend to get ugly if the group decides to work against other players or the flow of the \ngame for its own purposes. Rampant Clique Clones are the main ingredients in a \nrecipe for disaster - one that can turn an Elysium into a war zone. \nStorytellers should use their power to veto character concepts to control this \ntype of problem. If you have players who insist on linking concepts and histories and \nhave the potential to be Clique Clones, take extra caution in reviewing the \ncharacters. Help them develop their personal idiosyncrasies and motivations, and \ntake full advantage ofany loopholes in their linked histories. Such loopholes include \ncommon enemies, rivalries between members of the clique and exploiting the group \nmentality by holding the entire group responsible for the indiscretion of a single \nmember. By their very nature, Clique Clones will take up a good bit of a Storyteller’s \ntime, as it’s likely that they’ll encounter the majority of the plot hooks that are \npresented during a game. A wise Storyteller will realize this fact and try to ensure that \nplayers outside the clique have enough to do. \nREVENGERS \na.k.a. Inigo Montoyas, O’Barrs \nSo you lost your last character and you wanna take out the guy who did it, eh? \nDo you a.) work with friendly Storytellers to use your old contacts to eliminate the \nculprit, b.) start humming Que sera, sera and get a new character concept or c.) Make \na character who is the brother, sire or lover of your old character and take the SOB \nout yourself? Unless you chose B, welcome to your new incarnation as a Revenger. \nRevengers cause problems because they tend to have only one goal in their \ncharacter concept: the destruction of an offending character. When and if he \naccomplishes this goal, the Revenger often becomes one-dimensional and with- \ndrawn from the chronicle. \nThe Storyteller’s best option is to veto this type of character concept unless \nthere is a story-related reason for the concept - \na damn good one that would have \nexisted before the original character’s death became an issue. Even in such a case, \nyou might suggest that the revenge plot be handled from the Storyteller side by a \nStoryteller character played by a Narrator. This plot thread can be used to demon- \nstrate the fact that actions in the World of Darkness have consequences, while at the \nsame time heading off problems with player on player revenge at the same time. \nOtherwise, frankly, sometimes it’s okay to tell a sour player (one who’s likely to \nturn into a Revenger, that is) that his character died and that he should just get over \nit. Welcome to Darwin’s world, whiner. \n(Just be nice about it.) \n\n\nR E B E L  \nW I T H O U T A  C L U E  \ne \na k.a. Freak of the Week, Plot Bomb \nThere are several types of Rebels. The \nfirst, the Freak of the Week, wants to play \nthe Tremere Anarch, the Ronin Get of \nFenrts or the Renegade Assamite (to name \na few choice concepts) not because it is an \nI interesting concept but because it sounds \ncool. He wants toplay something outside the \nestablished norm, but he may not be as \naccustomed to the downside of playing this \ncharacter type and may not understand why \nhis character is being targeted for destruc- \ntion by the Tremere or the Assamites (for \ninstance). The Freak of the Week can nor- \nmally be educated by a Storyteller or fellow \nplayer about why he might not want to \npursue his concept lightly. A good starting \npoint here is to give the player a copy of the \nclan/tribe/kith book so he understands the \nI I  \nproblems with the concept. This can save a \nplayer some trouble down the road. \nOne thing that should be made clear to the Rebel is that actions have \nconsequences. A rogue Tremere apprentice who spreads clan secrets to the entire \nknown world because he doesn’t like his superiors’ orders or a Brujah neonate who \nmouths off constantly to an elder may sound like an interesting concept at first. \nHowever, when the archon comes to call or the elder puts the neonate in torpor, the \nplayer needs to realize that his actions caused the reaction. \nThe more problematic Rebel is the one who has issues with authority figures in \nreal life and transfers these issues to the game. Examples of this type of character are \nthe ones who gossip about the Storyteller’s ability to be fair and impartial in her \nrulings, attempt to actively undermine the authority of the Storyteller or whine \nabout her decisions even if they are fair. \nWhen dealing with this type of Rebel, it is important to remain impartial and \ncalm. Losing your temper will just give a Rebel fuel for his gossip. \nThe last type of Rebel is the Plot Bomb. This person’s main goal in the chronicle \nis to break the plot and to wreak as much havoc as he can in doing so. This Rebel is \nthe worst by far, as he will go to any length to make the game unpleasant for the players \nwhile he searches for a way to break it. This type of Rebel appears most frequently in \none-shot or convention games in which his actions have no real consequences other \nthan ruining others’ enjoyment of the game. There are few ways to deal with a Plot \nBomb rationally because he does not usually have a logical reason for his behavior. \nYour best bet is to ask him to stop, then, if he doesn’t, ask him to leave. \nT H E  BROKEN \nRECORD \na.k.a. Reiterators, Version 2.0 \nI \nCORRALLING D R O B L E M  DLAYERS \n\n\n“Billy, my Brujah, learned Thamaturgy from a Tremere he saved. I have this \ngreat idea for a new character: Glen, a Gangrel who learned Thamaturgy from a \nTremere he saved when he ...” \nThe Broken Record’s character concept, Abilities and goals may have worked \nthe first time around, but after four incarnations of the same character with a \ndifferent name each time, things tend to get predictable. Though this situation is not \nnecessarily a problem, it does cry out for someone to help this poor soul get a clue. \nThe main problem with a Broken Record is that his new character is indistin- \nguishable from its previous incarnations, and, as such, it adds nothing to the \nchronicle. \nOne key to stopping a Broken Record is another player or Storyteller who will \ntake the time to sit down and discuss more original (i.e., different) concepts. \nHowever, the best way to break a Broken Record of his habit is to let him continue \nto make the same mistakes until he gets a clue and changes his tune. \nCAPTAIN \nLOOSE- LIPS \na.k.a. Grapevine, Babbler \nCaptain Loose-Lips will tell you anything you want to hear about what his \ncharacter is up to and many things that you don’t. If you try to use the information \nagainst him during the course of the game, though, he will complain that he told you \nonly out of character. Your character didn’t know that; you were only having an out \nof game conversation, after all -. The line between player and character can get \nblurry and confusing; worse yet, it gets annoying. \nCaptain Loose-Lips also has a counterpart known as the Grapevine. This \nperson takes information he gained out of game and use it to his advantage in game, \nnormally by passing it to someone who does not know the source of the information \nand thus can’t call him on it. \nEither of these problem players is an annoyance to the rest of the players because \nthey can never be sure if the information Captain Loose-Lips or the Grapevine gave \nthem was in game or out ofgame. Confusion like this blows continuity to bits. Asking \nplayers to keep from discussing their characters out of game can avoid crossing the \nblurry line, but how many players can really stand to keep all of their best-laid plans \na secret? Alternatively, you can make it clear that any information given to your \ncharacter by any means (aside from reading the sourcebooks) will be considered \ninformation that’s been garnered in game. This step is usually an effective means of \ncurtailing Captain Loose-Lips. \nIf the Grapevine leaks plot information (or other sensitive information), \nhowever, the Storyteller should address the situation with extreme prejudice. Take \ncare in finding the source of the Grapevine, but once it has been found, consider \ndeducting experience or suspension if the leak was intentional. A carefully chosen \nexample or two will usually shut down problems of this type. \nC LO s I N q WORD \ns \nAs you can see, problem players come in many shapes and sizes. Each causes \ndifferent problems for players and Storytellers. However, if you take the time to \nunderstand the problem and work around it, there is a good chance that a problem \nplayer can be turned into a productive member of your LARP troupe. In fact, you’ll \n\n\noften find that choices that turn happy players into problem players usually spring \nfrom a desire to be productive members in the first place. The most important thing \nto remember when dealing with problem players is that all players are out to have fun, \nand most of them aren’t there to spoil anyone else’s fun. Keep your cool and address \nsituations brought up by problem players from a standpoint of doing what’s best for \nthe game at large. In most cases, problem players (regardless of type) will come \naround after the first or second such intervention. \nBut if they don’t - \nif they seem carelessly or even maliciously intent on causing \nproblems, the game be damned - \nwell, you do have a room full of friends and \nacquaintances there backing you up, right? Nothing says ‘conform’ like 20 annoyed, \nlike-minded people in trench coats who’ve been practicing making fists all night.. .. \nI would like to thank the following people for their input for this article: Glas \nDurbarow, Nash Bozard, Stacy Whisenant and the players and Storytellers of the Black \nDog chapter of the Camarilla for the storks and recommendations presented here. \n-\n.\n- ~\n.\n\n\nVAMPIRE \nLORE \nDoctor Alberton looked upfrom his dusty volume ofEuropean history as Charles \ncame scnding into the room, backlighted by the setting sun that peered through the Doctor’s \nwindow. Charles’ trenchcoat bulged in warious places, and the Doctor could just barely \nmake out the gleam of a golden cross peeking above the nylon bandolier of garlic bulbs \nCharles had strupped across his chest. The doctor tried not to sigh. \n“I think I’we tracked the bloodsucker to his lair, Doctor,” Charles said, looming over \nthe aging Doctor, ewen across his desk. “I’m going after him tonight.” \n“Do you hawe garlic?” the Doctor asked. \n“Yes,” Charb said, patting the bandolier. \n“Hawe you a mirror to confirm your suspicions of the kilkr’s nature?” \n“In my pocket.” \n“And Holy Water?” \n“That, and I hawe a wan ready to take the beast to the East river.” \n“Why the riwer?” the Doctor asked. \n“To throw the vampire in after I’ve knocked him out with the garlic fumes,” Charles \nbeamed, clearlyprowlofhis o w  ingenuity. “Runningwaterdissolves vampireflesh, right?” \nThe Doctor pinched the bridge of his nose beneath the divots made bj his ghses. “Sit \ndown, Charles,” he sighed. “You’re notready togo traipsingoffafter this thingin the Village \njust yet. ” \nThe hidden world of vampires brims with intrigue and secrecy. As a result, few \nbesides the unliving claim any knowledge of the true nature of vampires. With \nVampire Lore, however, you have discovered some of the legends of vampires, and \nyou may be aware of some of their secrets, powers and capabilities. Without this \nAbility, you may not even be aware that vampires exist. \nActual vampires (aside from those abandoned or misinformed by their sires) are \nassumed to possess the equivalent of all levels of this Lore. Characters with full \nmastery of this Lore (five levels) can discern the deeper secrets of vampires with \nCainite Lore (sometimes called Kindred Lore erroneously, though the term “Kindred” \nrefers only to Camarilla vampires), which deals with the legends of the undead \n\n\nthemselves. More unusual forms of vampires might require specialized Abilities as \ndetermined by the Storyteller ( such ascathayan Lore). \nVAMPIRE \nLOREX I \nYou know that vampires are real. Sunlight, silver, fire, wooden stakes through \nthe heart and holy symbols are said to injure them, and the unliving may not \napproach a bearer of the cross. Garlic wards against vampires, vampires may not cross \nrunning water (which disintegrates them if they are immersed in it), and they may \nnot enter a domicile uninvited. Vampires cannot cross holy ground. They may not \ncast reflections. Vampires must sleep during the day in a coffin lined with fresh grave \nearth. You know that all vampires are unusually pale and thin, and they often have \nclaws or glowing eyes in addition to fangs. \nYou believe that most vampires are stronger and faster than humans, and they \ncan control minds, change into bestial forms and see or hear things that humans \ncannot sense. People who are bitten by vampires become vampires themselves, as \nmay some people who are buried without proper rites and who were sinners in life. \nI \nA vamDire must have its head cut off and its mouth filled with holv wafers or parlic \nif it is to be killed permanently, or else it must die from exposure to sunlight or \nrunning water. \nVAMPIRE \nJ ~ R E X  \n2 \nSunlight and fire can kill vampires, and crosses, silver and wooden stakes can \ninjure them, though these last may not kill them. Vampires dislike garlic but it does \nnot hurt them. Running water has no adverse effect upon them, but they cannot \ncross it. A strongly presented cross can force a vampire to stay back, but only for a \nshort time. Vampires cannot tread on holy ground or enter churches uninvited. A \nvampire must sleep during the day, usually in a coffin or crypt. You know that \nvampires are pale and often thin, and they have fangs, while a few may have glowing \neyes or claws (although these are usually only evident if the vampire is enraged). \nYou know that vampires are stronger and hardier than humans, and are \nsometimes faster, though not always. All vampires can heal wounds rapidly, so most \nmortal injuries do not slow them overmuch. Most vampires have some ability to \ninfluence minds or emotions in some form. People bitten by vampires may not \nbecome vampires themselves, but such victims do die. A vampire, once beaten, can \nbe slain only if it’s decapitated. \nVAMPIRE \nLORE x 3 \nYou know that fire and sunlight can injure vampires, and prolonged exposure \ncan kill them. Silver has no special effect on most vampires, nor do crucifixes, \nalthough priests can harm vampires with crosses, and blessed crosses or holy water \nare effective. A vampire’s body decomposes rapidly upon death. Priests can keep \nvampires at bay by holding out a cross, but this tactic does not necessarily work for \nothers. Vampires can enter places uninvited, but they can only enter a church if \ninvited by the priest. Running water neither harms nor blocks vampires, and garlic \nmay repulse them briefly but does not injure or stop them. Mirrors have no effect \nupon vampires, and most vampires cast reflections. All vampires must sleep during \nthe day, though they need not do so in a coffin or crypt, and they don’t always need \nfresh soil. Many vampires have particular quirks, such as feeding only on a few select \nvictims, collecting ancient art of all sorts or evidencing horrific or animalistic \nfeatures. Vampires are often pallid and sometimes unnaturally lean, and they do not \n\n\nnaturally breathe; they also do not eat \nor drink. A vampire’s fangs are only \nvisible when the vampire feeds. \nYou know that vampires drink \npeople’s blood, but doing so does not \nalways kill the victims, and even those \nkilled by the vampire’s thirst do not \nalways come back as vampires. A vam- \npire is usually stronger than a human, \nand it can always absorb more injury, \nbut it may or may not be faster. Vam- \npires are not always smarter than \nhumans, but old ones are usually quite \ncrafty. All vampires have at least some \nspecial powers, though these vary; mind \ncontrol, speed, sensitivity, concealment \nand emotional control are common, \nwhile more arcane abilities like \nshapeshifting are more rare. You know \nI \nhave similar powers and weaknesses. \nVampires sometimes claim certain allegiances, and groups of vampires from different \ncities may be hostile to one another. \nthat vampires that are related often \nVAMPIRE \nLOREX 4 \nFire and sunlight injure or kill vampires, and the unliving flee from these forces. \nYou know that a wooden stake through the heart immobilizes avampire but does not \nkill it. Decapitation will kill a vampire, though. A vampire’s body decomposes \nrapidly upon death, unless the individual became a vampire recently. Crosses and \nholy objects sometimes hurt or ward against vampires, though not always; most \noften, they work for priests, but not all priests can use them, and some people who \naren’t priests can. A vampire can enter a place uninvited, even a church, and it can \ncross holy ground unless barred by someone using a holy symbol. Running water, \nmirrors and garlic do not injure or hinder vampires. Most vampires cast reflections. \nVampires often sleep deeply during the day, but they can do so in any location away \nfrom sunlight. You know that vampires are usually pale and sometimes rather thin, \nand that they don’t generally breathe; they are also cold to the touch, and sometimes \nhave monstrous features (especially when angry). \nYou’ve learned that vampires often gather in groups or families, and these \nfamilies usually share similar powers. You’ve also heard that many vampires claim \ndescent from Caine, the first murderer from the Bible, though there are some \n(especially outside of Europe and the Americas) who have different legends of \nancestry. Furthermore, most vampires claim allegiance to some sort of political group \n(though you’ve probably only heard the name of one of the sects, and you know only \nthat other sects exist). Young vampires have a few powers, while older ones have \nmultiple powers and stronger, stranger abilities. Vampires usually have some sort of \nweakness, and families often share the same weaknesses, such as a preference for \nfeeding on a certain type of person or a fondness for art. Vampires are not always more \nphysically powerful than humans, but they can often temporarily boost their \n\n\nstrength or speed, and some are always stronger. Old vampires tend to be far, far more \npowerful than humans or even younger vampires. Vampiric powers include the \nability to control animals or people, to sway emotions, to resist injury, to become \nhighly sensitive, to conceal oneself, to shapeshift (a rare power), to cast spells (also \nrare) or to exhibit incredible strength and speed. A vampire can heal most wounds \nvery rapidly, though only to some degree. You know that vampires sometimes go \nberserk when very hungry or badly wounded. People bitten by vampires do not \nalways become vampires; the vampire must feed the person some blood first, and \nthen the victim must die. People who drink vampire blood without dying may gain \ngreat strength or vampiric powers, and such people often serve the vampire in \nquestion. Vampires can retract their fangs to hide them, and they can close the \nwounds from their bites. \nVAMPIRE \nLOREX 5 \nYou know that vampires are injured or even killed by fire and sunlight, that holy \nsymbols and objects only have an effect if the bearer has faith, and that decapitation \nkills vampires. A wooden stake through the heart paralyzes a vampire, but does not \nkill it. You know that running water and garlic bar only a very few vampires at all, \nand that only some lackreflections. Vampires must sleep during the day, though they \ncan rise (with great difficulty) in times of danger. \nYou know that vampires organize themselves according to lines of lineage \n(sometimes called “bloodlines,” “families” or “clans,”), and that vampires of com- \nmon lineages often share similar powers and interests. Each of these lineages \napparently traces back to a powerful progenitor, and then to Caine, the Biblical \nmurderer cursed with vampirism by God for his deeds. Vampires also divide \nthemselves among certain political allegiances; the “Camarilla” consists of vampires \nwho try to hide their nature from humanity, while the “Sabbat” is populated with \nvampires who revel in their monstrous natures. Vampires may enter domains freely \nand without invitation. Many vampires manifest a few different powers, and you \nknow of many of the common abilities (incredible speed, strength, resilience, \nsensitivity; the ability to control minds [sometimes ofpeople, sometimes of animals], \nsway emotions, conceal or change shape), but only very old vampires have a great \nvariety of powers. Also, some rare vampires can cast spells, control shadows, \nshapechange into animals or control the dead. A vampire passes on the curse by \ndraining the blood of an individual and then feeding that person some blood. \nIndividuals who drink of a vampire’s blood may feel a mystical bond of servitude to \nthat vampire; if human, such individuals may gain some vampiric powers. Vampires \nhave a mortal terror of fire and sunlight, both of which may cause them to flee. \nVampires can also be goaded into a rage through insult, injury or hunger. A vampire \ncan heal injuries inflicted by normal sources -swords, falls and the like - \nrapidly. \nVampires are usually (but not always) somewhat pallid, and they lose a bit of weight \nin the process of “dying.” The fangs of a vampire only extend when the vampire \nwishes to feed or is enraged. Furthermore, a vampire can lick a bite wound, causing \nit to close. Vampires do not breathe naturally, and they are cold, although some \nvampires can overcome this shortcoming with effort. \nWEREWOLF \nLORE \n“My god,” Detective Gilder said as he arrived at the gruesome scene. “Did a family \nof bears go crazy here?” \n\n\nGore painted every inch of the wooded clearing, and what wasn’t soaked was torn, \nmangledor broken. The only evidence that this place hadonce beenacampsite (rather than, \nsay, an abbatoir) was a circle of stones with some blackened bits of wood in the center. \n“Not likely, Detective,” one ofthe officers on the scene responded, picking through a \nparticularly sogg-j mess with apen. “We don’t get many bears in this part of Connecticut. \nBesides, bears don’t do this. ” \nGilder swallowed hard (against a shift in the wind) and said, “So what happened?” \n“Your call, Detective,” the officersaid, sundingbackup, still holding thedrippingpen. \n“We’re of the opinion it was some sort of animal attack, but who knows what kind? We \nfound claw and scratch marks on the trees and some of the larger rocks scattered about, but \nthey don’treally matchany patterns Irecognize. lfound wolftracks, but they’refarther on, \noutside of this area. ” \n“Any idea of the victims?” Gilder asked. “Like who they a- \nwere.” \n“Some surt of survey team, we think,” the officer said, moving away from the scene \nof slaughter. Gilder gkdly followed him. “We found smashed survey equipment around the \nclearing, and the tripodwas impaled through ow ofthe more intact bodies we took outearlier. \nThe tripod had the letters ‘NTEX’ on it. The rest had broken off in the victim’s body.” \nGilder stopped in his trucks. \n“Show me some of the claw mrks you found,” he said, steeling himself to go buck to \n‘Two nights ago, most likely.” \n“-was \nthere a full moon out?” \nIn the wild places outside of the cities, the werewolves congregate; in the \nhuddles of urban society, they move unnoticed among the ranks of mankind. Their \nspiritual rites are strange and their many forms terrifying. Only the most stalwart of \nsouls can withstand their fury, and they are a secretive kind indeed - \nand not above \ndestroying threats to their hidden society. \nYour Werewolf Lore measures your knowledge of the elusive and horrifying \nshapeshifters, as well as their culture and ways. Those without this Lore may well \nbelieve that werewolves are nothing more than folk tales or myths. You know better \n- \nyou know that they’re real, that they’re dangerous, but that they can be fought \nor (rarely) befriended. Learning Werewolf Lore is a difficult undertaking; separating \nfact from myth is extremely hard when the Delirium makes sure that few hunters ever \nremember their experiences with werewolves. \nWerewolf characters are automatically considered to have the equivalent of all \nfive levels of this Ability; only a lost and untrained cub would not know of the many \nforms and the dangers of silver, for instance. Further knowledge of the various \nshapechangers is provided by more specialized Garou Lore. \nthe scene of the attack. “And think back. When this happened-” \nWEREWOLE \nLORE x I \nMuch of your knowledge of werewolves comes from fantasy and myth. You \nbelieve that werewolves may exist, and that they can be killed by silver bullets and \nrepelled by wolfsbane. Werewolves can be hurt by normal weapons, but do not die \nfrom such attacks. You believe that werewolves change shape into hideous man- \nwolves on the night of the full moon, and then rampage about killing and eating \npeople. Werewolves can supposedly pass on their condition by biting others - \nbe \ncareful while hunting them! \n\n\nYou suspect that werewolves gain \nsome size, strength and speed while \nrampaging, but that they are unintel- \nligent, slavering monsters while the \nmoon is full. A werewolf can often be \ndiscerned by certain markings: a pen- \ntagram on the hand, index and middle \nfingers of the same length, eyebrows \nthat meet in the center of the fore- \nhead. Most werewolves are solitary, \nbestial creatures, just as quick to fight \ntheir own kind as to war with vam- \npires or humans. \nWBREWOLE \nLORBX 2 \nYou've learned that silver is quite \neffective against werewolves and that \nother attacks can injure them, but not \nkill them. You suspect that they can \nchange shape any time at night, but \nthey are forced to change by the sight \nof the full moon. Wolfsbane is repel- \nlent to some, but not all, werewolves. When shifted into their animalistic forms, \nwerewolves are powerful predators, but they retain a cunning instinct. You also \nbelieve that the bite of a werewolf may be sufficient to pass on its condition, but that \nthis does not always occur. Certain remedies, such as belladonna infusions, may help \nto delay or prevent the onset of lycanthropy contracted by a werewolf's bite. Of \ncourse, such potions are also poisonous. \nA werewolf in its animal form is always larger and stronger than normal, and its \nclaws and teeth are capable of rending flesh and bone with nearly equal ease. \nWerewolves can sometimes be told by specific marks and traits, but not all \nwerewolves exhibit all of those physical aberrations. Werewolves in the city are \nusually solitary individuals, though some werewolves run in groups or packs - \na \nterrifying notion considering their strengths! \nWEREWOLE \nLOREX 3 \nYou now know that silver and fire can both injure and kill werewolves, and that \npersistent attacks of other sorts can incapacitate or sometimes kill them. Silver is \nbaneful to werewolves in almost all of their forms, so they avoid it whenever possible. \nWolfsbane and other herbs are largely useless against the shape-changers, unfortu- \nnately. Werewolves heal from most attacks quite rapidly, but a single overwhelming \nattack can slow one down long enough for a hunter to escape or to make a final blow. \nWerewolves apparently have several different forms, a range between man and \nwolf. Each werewolf can assume any of these forms, but some are more comfortable \nwith particular forms. In any case, they can shapechange whenever they want. \nHowever, the sight of the moon at night often causes the werewolf to change \ninvoluntarily. \nIt can be difficult to tell werewolves from other people - \nmany are comfortable \nin their human forms, and they show few telltale signs of their heritage. Some, \n\n\nthough, ,act more like wolves, and can be spotted because of their primitive \nunfamiliarity with their human forms. In any case, werewolves retain at least some \nintelligence in all of their forms, so they can be dangerously clever wolves or \npredatorial humans. They disdain technology, living primitively even among \nhuman society. A werewolf is difficult to capture, though, because people often \nforget when they have seen a werewolf enraged. \nYou know that werewolves have some means of traveling unseen, and that they \nsometimes gather in packs or groups. Different packs seem to have territories, and they \nmay fight or work with other packs. Individual werewolves sometimes show specific \ncultural characteristics. Most werewolves follow some sort of shamanistic tradition. \nWEREWOLE \nLORE x 4 \nYou always carry silver - \nit burns werewolves except in their most favored \nforms, and wounds caused to them with silver do not heal easily. Fire is an acceptable \nweapon, but not as effective as silver. Other attacks must rely on main force to slow \na werewolf down, and werewolves are killing machines that can hardly be matched \nby the toughest of hunters. Thus, you must rely on ambushes and careful planning \nto fight werewolves. \nYou know that werewolves refer to themselvcs as “garou,” possibly from the \nFrench term “loup-gurou.” Often, they run in packs, but each werewolf may claim \nallegiance to a specific camp or tribe as well. A few werewolves belong to packs that \nfight with the others, but most packs work together. The full moon brings out a great \nfury in werewolves, but it does not force them to change; oddly, different phases of \nthe moon carry significance to different werewolves. Each werewolf also has a \nfavored form - \nhuman, wolf or man-wolf. The werewolf is most comfortable in that \nform, but it does not heal anymore rapidly than normal. When in the man-wolfform, \nwerewolves are terrifying berserkers, and most humans are frightened beyond \nrational thought by their rage. People tend to forget about such encounters, their \nminds defensively pushing away the experience. \nYou’ve learned that werewolves have a sort of spiritual, shamanistic culture, \nand that they can do some sort of magic based around spirits. Different werewolves \nhave different powers, often related to some sort of status system. Werewolves also \nseem to have relatives among otherwise normal humans and wolves, though these \nindividuals cannot be told from their counterparts in society. When among human \nsociety, the werewolves often disdain technology, and have a particular dislike of big \ncorporations, factories and industry. Stranger still, there seem to be shapechangers \ncapable of taking other forms, but they are even more scarce legends than werewolves. \nWEREWOLE \nLOREX 5 \nAt this level of expertise, you know as much about werewolves as they usually \nknow about themselves. Silver hurts and kills any werewolf, except when it is in its \nfavored form - \nthe form in which it was born. Fire works as well. Anything else \nsimply slows the werewolf down, although toxic waste and radiation may hurt them \nbadly. You know that werewolves are not immune to damage, but that they heal most \ninjuries with incredible rapidity. However, a werewolf in its “breed form,” its birth \nform, does not heal any faster than usual. \nAll individual Garou, as they call themselves, are part of a particular tribe. Also, \nthey are affiliated with acertain phase of the moon, and they draw anger from it. Certain \nphases of the moon have specific roles in society - \ntrickster, shaman, mediator, bard, \n\n\nwarrior. Most Garou run in packs with others from different tribes, breeds and auspices. \nA few packs are composed of the “Black Spiral Dancer” tribe, agroup of werewolves that \nare all evil and corrupt, and these werewolves fight others of their kind. \nGarou also have potent spirituality. You know that the garou can enter a \nmagical spirit world, which they call the “Umbra,” by stepping into a reflective \nsurface, and that they can step back out through any similar surface. They also make \ndeals with spirits, calling upon them for magical powers. Some packs have a \nparticular patron spirit - \na “totem” [sic] - \nthat grants them additional boons. \nAll werewolves are killing machines when enraged. In their man-wolf forms, they \nate half again as tall as a human, incredibly fast and strong and deadly with their claws \nand teeth. However, they remain intelligent, able to call upon both human intelli- \ngence and animal instinct. At times, werewolves become terribly furious, and they are \nthen uncontrollably dangerous. They have a particular crusade against the spoils of \nprogress, such as pollution and toxic waste, though not all are total Luddites. You know \nthat werewolves spend most oftheir time in the wilderness, guarding holy places where \nthey commune with their spirit allies. You also know that they have relatives among \nboth humans and wolves, and that they choose mates from such relatives. \nIn their man-wolf forms, werewolves cause a reaction that they call “Delirium,” \ncausing people to forget the sight of the werewolf or to rationalize it away. This \nsurvival instinct causes normal humans to flee in terror or curl into a helpless ball; \nonly the strongest wills remain unbroken. However, the relatives of werewolves are \nimmune to this “Delirium.” Aside from human and wolf relatives, there are some \nshapeshifters that take other forms - \ngreat cats, rats, lizards, crows and the like - \nbut you know little of their ways. \nWRAITH \nLORE \n“I don’t know why the police referredme to you,” Lydiasaid, lookingnerwous andout \nof place. “Are you a specialist in stalkers or something?” \nEmilio Loren? considered how much he should tell the distraut housewife about what \nhe actually did for a liwing, and decided instead to get right to business. \n“I’ma special consultant to the police, ” he said, gesturingfor her to sit down in the chair \nacross thedeskfrom him. “Now, I’we lookedower yourreport, andIhaweafewquestions.” \nLydia sat and nodded dumbly. Something about the Italian man’s voice was very \nreassuring, if not particularly warm or comforting. \n“You say that a stranger approached you and began to ask you about personal matters \nof which he should have had no prior knowledge. Is that correct! That’s why you feel you \nare being stalked?” \n“Yes,” Lydia said. “He asked me about a manuscript my husband was working on. But \nmy husband died two years ago, and he’d newer talked about it in depth to anyone but me. \nAnyway, this weirdmansaid the title, andaskedmeifI, ofallpeople, wasgoingtofinishit. Then \nhe started asking me how I was doing and what I was thinking. I got so scared I just ran away .” \n“Understood,” Emilio said, marking something on a yellow legal pad. “How exactly \ndid your husband die?” \n“A car accident,” the womn said, not sure why the strange consultant had brought it \nup. “Itwas sudden.. . he was on his way backfromameetingwith his agent whenit happened.” \n“I see. And this manuscript. Was it something your husband had been particularly \nhard at work on?” \n\n\n“It w a  all he talked about before.. . before it happened,” Lydia said, suppressing \nremembered tears from that hom‘ble time. “Is that relevant to my case?” \n“Quite relewant,” Emilio said. “I’d wager that you and this manuscript were the two \nmost important things in your late husband’s life, were they not?” \n“Yes,” Lydia said. “But why does that matter? What does that hawe to do with the \nweirdo who came up to me on the street?” \n“Oh, more thanmight be immediately apparent,” Emilio said, stadingand picking up \na steel cane fro mastand beside his desk. “Do you mind ifwe t a k a  lookat your apartment?” \nHumans have searched - \nmostly in vain - \nfor clues to what lies beyond the \nveil of death. In many cultures, stories tell ofheroes traveling to the lands of the dead \nand returning, or of the dead passing their wisdom on to the living. Some speak of \nan age where the dead and living existed together in harmony. Such days, if they ever \nhappened, are long gone. The dead do not deign to commune with the living, or are \nthey unable; the living, in turn, fear the unlit corridors of the afterlife, when they \nbother to turn to such thoughts at all. \nThe Restless Dead themselves come into their darkly lit realm with scant \nknowledge of their condition. Indeed, most are not even aware, blinded and \ndeadened by their Cauls upon death. Only a very few arrive sensible and able to \ncomprehend their surroundings - \nand no wraith is ever guaranteed a mentor or \ntutor to learn the skills necessary to exist in the Underworld. The passion to hang \non to some memory of existence does not come with any more answers to the \nmysteries of death. Most ghosts can only discover their own powers and limitations \nthrough trial and error, or with the rare advice of another compassionate spirit. \nLearning Wraith Lore is a difficult and trying task. Finding a teacher capable of \ninstructing one in such secrets is a feat in and of itself; most wraiths learn their limits \nand capabilities through hard trial and error. A mortal probably needs a wraithly \ninstructor, or talent in areas like the Merit: Medium or the Ephemera sorcerous path, \nin order to gain this knowledge. Wraiths usually manage to puzzle out a small amount \nafter some time in the Underworld, but true understanding may take years, many \ninstructors and several failed ventures. Wraiths going about their business are the \nmost common learners of Wraith Lore, of course, though some necromantically- \ninclined supernatural creatures of other factions develop a small understanding of \nthe dead (most notably: Giovanni, Samedi, Harbinger of Skulls and Nagaraja \nvampires; Silent Strider Garou; various death-cult wizards; sluagh changelings and, \nof course, mummies). \nWRAITH \nLOREX I \nYou know (or at least believe) that ghosts exist, that some people go on to an \nafterlife. It may be that all the dead congregate in one eternal place, or that they go \non to separate unlives, or that some do not go at all - \nyou haven’t met enough ghosts \nto know for sure. Some ghosts are just plain nasty, apparently only being reflections \nof all of their pain, hate or fear in life; others mindlessly repeat their actions from \ntheir living days. A few are still sensible and able to talk, though they can freakily \nchange moods with extreme rapidity. \nMany wraiths seem to hold on to places or people that were familiar 01 \nimportant to them in life. Not all do so, though. Some even keep ties to special \nthings, strong enough to reach into the living land and affect these subjects. \n\n\nOccasionally, objects manifest in the ghost world, but you don’t really know how \nthey get there or why. \nGhosts seem to manifest a variety of powers, though you’re not really sure of the \nrange and versatility of them all. Some wraiths haunt areas through cold spots or \nlights; others speak in eerie whispers; still others even possess people or objects. \nThere’s no telling what powers a particular ghost manifests, though. You do know \nthat ghosts are normally immaterial, but can still see and hear things in the living \nworld. Even if driven off, most wraiths eventually return. \nA ghost is supposedly barred by sea salt, according to old tales, and it may also be \nvulnerable to exorcisms, to strewing an area with rose petals or to threatening the people \nor objects it holds dear. Swings or blows can affect wraiths, though this really just seems \nto annoy them, not injure them. However, ghosts can interact with one another. \nWRAITH \nLOREX \n2 \nApparently, not everybody becomes a ghost on dying, or perhaps some of them \ngo on to a place unable to reach the mortal realm. Whatever the case, ghosts seem \nto be nothing more or less than the souls of the dead, still clinging to some semblance \nof life. A few - \nspectres - \nare malicious and violent, but most are just a little \nunstable (doubtless from dying). \nYou know the term “Fetter.” A Fetter is an object, person or place with some \nsignificance to a particular wraith. Apparently, wraiths can use them for protection, \nand they hang around such objects or places due to some spiritual tie. Destroyed Fetters \nsometimes become “ghost objects,” as do other objects with important memories \nattached, though not under any conditions that you can conclusively repeat. \nWraiths term their special powers Arcanoi and study a wide range of abilities. \nSome can haunt areas, and some can appear material briefly. You only know of about \na half-dozen such powers, but there are supposedly a great many. Aside from that, \nwraiths have very sharp senses, and they sometimes see images of death or life \nswirling about things or people. They also are immune to most physical strikes. \nA wraith can be exorcised by a skilled priest, or kept out with magical wardings \nand strong belief (pure sea salt works best). Most wraiths have a very hard time \naffecting the living world, if at all. Also, they can be discorporated briefly, and if they \nsuffer too much ghostly injury (especially from other wraiths), they disappear for a \ntime - \nsometimes forever. \nThere are supposedly “layers” to the deadlands. The Shadowlands refer to the \nreflection of the mortal world. The Tempest is some sort of eternal storm, but it only \nrarely rages through parts of the Shadowlands. Also, there are apparently Heaven( s) \nand Hell(s) in the Underworld, though they are far away and barred to most (you \nhave to be worthy of entry, or something). \nWRAITH \nLOREX 3 \nMany people can and do become wraiths after death. However, not all retain \ntheir sentience, some become quite malevolent and a few just never seem to show \nup. Regardless, all wraiths share in common strong passions, the desire to do \nsomething they left unresolved in life. Some items also pass across the Shroud (the \nbarrier between life and death), particularly those with important memories at- \ntached to them, but they tend to fade away after time. You’ve even heard rumors of \nghosts who cross back into the living world physically, but aside from some of the \n\n\nmore difficult powers of the Arcanoi, this is probably nonsense. In any case, the \nHierarchy - \nan organization of old, powerful and cynical wraiths - \ndeclares it \nillegal to interfere with the living, though this doesn’t stop rebels and cultists from \ndoing so. Sometimes, other creatures come to the deadlands, or so it is said, but they \nrarely enjoy doing so, and they often leave as quickly as they can. If they can. \nYou know a little bit about Fetters - \nalmost any young wraith has some, and \nthey keep the wraith tied to the living lands. They’re all objects important to the \nwraith in some way, though the wraith may not understand why. A Fetter is more \neasily influenced by some powers, but conversely, injuring a Fetter is damaging to the \nwraith, and destroying one can cause serious problems. \nWraiths use Arcanoi to manifest various strange powers, the various “ghost \npowers” out of stories. You’ve heard of most of the common Arcanoi, and you know \nthat they were once taught by powerful Guilds, but those Guilds were disbanded. You \nalso know that using an Arcanos to deal with the living lands is apparently illegal. \nThose who are caught may be turned into slaves or punished by using parts of their \nbodies to make ghostly objects! \nWraiths do have some weaknesses. Without special powers, they have trouble \ninteracting with the material world. This is most true in areas ofdisbelief, science and \nvibrant life - a mundane supermarket is harder to haunt than a run-down \nabandoned house. Even when a wraith affects the material world, its passage and \npowers are often remembered incorrectly or forgotten by mortal witnesses entirely. \nExorcisms can sometimes bar or send away wraiths, but apparently only a few priests \nknow how to do them properly. Sea salt and those other old wives’ tales have no \neffect at all. Thankfully, a dedicated assault on the area that a ghost occupies can \ndiscorporate it, eventually forcing it away or even into a sort of nightmare play where \nit confronts its worst fears and terrors. This event is called a Harrowing. \nYou’re most familiar with the Shadowlands, the edge of the Undenvorldnearest \nthe living world. However, you know that the Tempest is a storm-tossed layer \nsomehow “underneath” the Skindlands. Some wraiths go there out of need or \ndesperation, and powerful cities stand in islands within the Tempest itself. Rumor \nspeaks of Far Shores and distant Dark Kingdoms, but you know nothing specific \nabout such matters. \nWRAITH \nLORE x 4 \nVery few people actually become wraiths - \nonly those with powerful memo- \nries, drives and passions, or horribly violent deaths. Some become mindless drones \nwhile others keep their consciousness; rumor has it that a few people actually become \nSpectres (which you understand as “evil” ghosts) immediately upon death. It is those \nincomplete passions of life that drive a ghost and give it power. However, those very \nsame passions can be turned to dark ends, fueling the darkhalf of the wraith‘s persona \n(or its “Shadow”). It is possible for a ghost to rise from the dead, though such a thing \nis apparently chancy and random. It is also possible for some creatures, especially \nvampires, to walk in the Shadowlands, though doing so is exceedingly rare. \nFetters tie a wraith to the material world but also offer succor. When a Fetter \nis destroyed, it plunges a wraith into a Harrowing. However, wraiths can often home \nin on their Fetters and use them for shelter. Certain Arcanoi work more easily on \nFetters than on other things. Most Fetters are objects that were important to the \nwraith for some reason, even if the wraith does not know why or denies the \n\n\nconnection. Aside from Fetters, objects of importance in the living world can \nbecome Relics when destroyed, passing into the Shadowlands. Most such items \ndisappear as memory of them fades, but some possess an inner power that sustains \nthem; these last are exceedingly valuable. Other objects in the Shadowlands come \nfrom soulforging, the process of turning a whole wraith into a simple item. \nAll of the common Guild Arcanoi are familiar to you. You know that the Guilds \nonce held power in Stygia, the city of the west, but that they were broken apart \n(although some wraiths still claim secret ties to Guilds). You can recognize most \nguildmarks in practitioners of particular Arcanoi. However, you do know that there \nare some Arcanoi that were barred even more severely than others, and some that \nare native to non-western wraiths or to those who rise from the grave. What these \npowers are called and what they can do, you do not know. Spectres also use some \nDark Arcanoi; you’ve heard a few names like Contaminate, though the specifics are \nsketchy. Aside from that, you are familiar with the usual ghostly powers of \ninsubstantiality, sharp senses, lifesight and deathsight and healing through Pathos. \nYou’ve become quite familiar with the Hierarchy, its Legions and bureaucracy and \nthe politics thereof, and you can name several different Heretic cults and a few \nRenegade groups. \nYou know that ghosts are mostly immune to harm from the living world. Only \nspecial magic weapons and spells can really capture, bar or injure them. With the \nproper Arcanoi, a wraith can also affect the material world, though this usually takes \na great deal of effort. Mortals generally don’t remember a ghost’s interactions with \nthe living realm, \nYou know the Underworld fairly well. You can locate Stygia’s place in the \nTempest and navigate about the Shadowlands easily. You know of the Venous Stair, \nand you could probably get to it if you felt suicidal. You’ve heard of the Well of \nOblivion, but who’d ever want to go far enough into the Tempest to see it? You know \nmany safe Byways in the Tempest, though they are probably a last resort if you don’t \nknow Argos. You also know about some of the other major Dark Kingdoms - \nin \nAfrica and Asia, for instance. \nWRAITH \nLORE x 5  \nYou’ve learned that only very few people, and the rare deceased supernatural \ncreatures with strong passions, become wraiths; most others apparently go on to \nTranscendence, Oblivion or whatever. A wraith seems to be nothing more than a \nmemory of emotions. Thus, ghosts are motivated only by their strongest passions. \nThose who have very dark desires can fall prey to the whisperings of their Shadows, \nthe brutal and insidious parts of their personalities, thus becoming Spectres - \nwraiths who have succumbed to the lure of self-destruction and the desire to wreak \nit upon others. Lastly, a rare few wraiths actually inhabit their old bodies, striving up \nfrom the grave to take matters in hand in the material world once more. These Risen \nare startlingly tough and can even develop incredible physical powers, but they \nrapidly fall prey to the Shadow. Rising also requires a modicum of proficiency in \nseveral Arcanoi - \nInhabit and Puppetry being chief among them. A rare few \nvampires, werewolves and magicians can visit the Shadowlands, too, but it is \ndangerous for them. \nA wraith‘s most important connection to the Skinlands is its Fetters. Through \nthe Fetters, the wraith maintains a fragile link to the living world and to its reflection \n\n\nYou know all the territory of the Underworld. You know about the Skinlands, \nthe Tempest, the Labyrinth, the Far Shores and the Venous Stair; you’ve even heard \nof the Well of Oblivion and many of the secret hide-outs in various parts of the \ndeadlands. The Dark Kingdoms are known to you, from the deadlands of Jade (Asia) \nto such obscure places as the Enclave of Wire (Auschwitz) and the Dark Kingdom \nof Sand (ancient Egypt). Moving about in the Tempest may be dangerous, but at \nleast you can recognize most hazards, including plamics and other non-wraithly - \nthings - that dwell there. \nEAERIE LORE \n“How are youfeelingtoday, James?” DoctorNazelsaidinhisusualfriendly, distant way. \n“Fine, I guess ,” James said, keeping his voice even, trying to be helpful. Trying to “get \nwith the program” as Nazel h a  drummed into his head time and again. “How are the test \nresults?” \nNazel consulced his ever-present clipboard and flipped a few neatly typed pages. At \nlast, he looked up over the gray frames of his glasses and said, “Promising. We seem to have \ntamed your odd allergy to ferrous metal, if nothing else.” \n“Oh good,” James said eagerly. “Do you think we can take my jacket off today, \nmaybe?” He wriggled against the restraining canvas for emphasis. \n“I don’t think so,” the Doctor said, frowning but not meetingJames’ eyes. “It’s still \ntoo soon after the incident with Nurse Johnson. You nearly bit her hand off, James.” \n“I was only trying to scare her a bit,” James said slowly, attempting a shrug beneath \nhis straightjacket. “I think. It’s so hard to remember. Didn’t I eat her thermometer or \nsomething?” \n“Yes, James,” Doctor Nazel sighed. He flipped another page on his clipboard. “Now \nabout these delusions.. . are you still having those dreams?” \n“What dreams?” James said, winkling his forehead and blinking in confusion. \n“About beingamonster,” Nazelsaid. “Aboutserving.. . let’s see.. . ‘the elfkingin the \nmansionat theendofWildcrestLane.’ Thecondemnedmansion, as Irecall. Youwerequite \nadamant about all of it when you were first brought here by your parents, James.” \n“I don’t know,”]ames said slowly. “I can’t remember.. . .” \nDoctor Nazel sighed and turned to go. “Sometimes, James, I swear I just can’t \nunderstand you.” \nYou believe infaeries? Well, there was that case of the girls who saw some, and \nthere are old folk tales and even the occasional bit of Muse-inspired art that seems \nto reflect on some otherworldly beauty. Heck, if those people can talk about \nvampires and ghosts, why not faeries? \nKnowledge of Faerie Lore refers to the history of the fae, and to the modem \nchangelings that lurk otherwise unnoticed in human society. Of course, someone with \nthis knowledge would never actually refer to them as faeries. With this Ability, you may \nhave some information regarding their arts, their movements and their ways of hiding \nfrom humanity. You may even have snippets of memory from a time being enchanted. \nMost true changelings are instructed in their faerie natures shortly after the \nChrysalis. Indeed, the Chrysalis itself draws other faeries, so the young fae may have \nmany potential mentors waiting for the blessed transformation to a creature of \ndreams. Unless specifically untutored or otherwise ignorant (perhaps due to exposure \n\n\nto too much Banality), all changelings are assumed to have knowledge equivalent to \nall of this Lore. Mythlore covers further hidden knowledge of changeling history. \nFAERIE L O R E X  I \nFaeries are real! They are ephemeral creatures of beauty and temperament. Your \nparticulars are a little fuzzy, but you’re sure that they are out there, gossamer wings and all. \nFaerie powers are a mystery to you. According to stories, they can do the work \nof many men in a night, turn invisible, flow through walls, fly, cast powerful illusions \nand make people fall in love. On the other hand, they are said to be vulnerable to \nthe touch of iron, the shadow of the Cross, the sound of church bells or rooster crows \nand to the touch of holy men. Their attention (and ire) is often drawn when they \nare called “faeries,” so you rely on allusions like “Fair Folk” and “Wee Ones.” \nSupposedly, wearing your coat inside-out and walking backwards renders you \ninvisible to them; they seem to have trouble with inversions of human custom. To \nunderstand humans, or perhaps just as a trick, they occasionally take humans away \nfor a time, stealing wives or even replacing children. \nFaeries have their own society, from mischievous pucks to fair elf maidens, ruled \n(of course) by OberonandTitania (according to Shakespeare, anyway). Faeries have \nstrange rules and realms, even entire kingdoms like Avalon hidden away from \nhuman eyes. Should you step into a faerie door - \na door under a hill, or through a \nring of mushrooms or even into a tree - \nyou may find yourself trapped there for a \nlong time, even if it seems only a short while. Also, you should never accept a gift \nfrom a faerie, or you may be held enthralled; similarly, offering a gift is seen as an \ninsult, an attempt to indebt the faerie in question. \nFAERIE LOREX 2 \nThe faeries of the modem world sure aren’t anything like the old faerie tales. For \nthat matter, faeries in the old days probably weren’t like that, either. Though they \ncome in many shapes, sizes and forms, they seem to be able to cloak their true \nappearances, looking like normal people. Even when they decide to show their \npowers and forms, most people forget it later. \nChangelings seem to have a variety of magic spells to trick, confuse and call \nupon nature. Many also have knacks like performing great amounts of work or \nturning into mist; there’s no real way to tell how much a given faerie can do with his \nmagic. They rarely call upon these powers in the real world, though, content to cast \nsubtle and invisible spells instead. \nMagic spells of the right sort can certainly call or banish changelings or faeries, \nas can such tricks as hanging an iron horseshoe over your door. Church bells and holy \nground apparently keep faeries away, but most of the other little tricks from legend \ndon’t seem to have any effect (probably the results of faeries playing pranks on people). \nThey do get rather disturbed by the old refrain of ‘‘I don’t believe in faeries!”, though. \nIf you can get a changeling to swear an oath, it’s binding, so it is possible to trick them. \nSince they can get drunk or enraged like anyone else, and often with an even more \nterrible temper, this tactic may be a decent one to use when a changeling’s off-guard. \nExperience shows that changelings most often show up at places of natural \nbeauty or art, and they have an irresistible attraction for humans who are beautiful, \ncharismatic and influential, or conversely ignorant, arrogant and pushy. The former \nthey tend to seduce and carry away; the latter, they tease with vicious (and \nsometimes fatal) pranks. \nH U N T I N g  LORES \ne \n\n\nE A E R I E  L O R E X  3 \nDespite the numbing effect of the Mists, you are somewhat educated about the \nways of the fae - \nor, at least, their changeling descendants. You’ve uncovered \ninformation about the various kiths, such as the sidhe and the trolls, though you \nprobably don’t know all of the European fae (and you’ve probably never heard of any \nof the stranger types). You’ve heard that the faeries are really dream-spirits from \nanother world, given captured human forms. Then again, you’ve also heard of tiny \nbrownies and sprites, which are obviously ridiculous. Still, faerie tales are sure to be \nfull of errors due to the Mists: most humans fail to see faerie magic, or forget about \nit later, possibly accounting for those stories of lost time. \nChangelings wield powers based on dream and the shaping of imagination. \nThey require the use of some sort of vibrant dream energy, and many changelings \ncloak their magic in comical guises or games. Changelings draw some sort of magical \nsustenance from creativity itself, though they can also apparently steal dreams when \nfeeling particularly vicious. Most changeling powers only affect others able to see \ndreams, though in dire straits a changeling can bring some of her magic across to the \nmaterial world. \nAs for weaknesses of the fae, you’ve discovered (possibly the hard way) that \nmost folk tales are totally wrong. Iron seems to have a deleterious effect upon them, \nas does the power of disbelief itself. Presumably, they can also be injured by magic. \nA faerie is also vulnerable to dream-creatures, and can be knocked unconscious by \nsuch attacks. Puzzlingly, the Mists can sometimes affect a faerie so injured, causing \nthe changeling to forget all about her heritage. Changelings canalso be held to sworn \noaths, though only sometimes - \nthe peculiars are unknown to you. \nChangelings obviously congregate wherever artists and dreamers gather. How- \never, most still lead some semblance of a normal life, as well. They occasionally refer \nto ranks of nobility, though these titles may simply be formalities for their courtly \ndances in their own, strange society. A few rare sites seem to serve as changeling \ndream-fortresses, called Freeholds, but you know nothing more than that (and, \nindeed, have probably never seen such a conceptually silly place, in any case). \nEAERIE LOREX 4 \nYou’ve seen or heard of most of the European kiths and understand that \nchangelings are basically fragments of dream instilled into human forms. Each kith \nwields a few rather spectacular powers and an unusual appearance, although both \ntraits usually only work in the dream-realm that overlaps changeling reality. \nThe powers of changelings are called Arts, and they affect things through \ntrickery, misdirection, illusion, natural forces and majestic charisma. Most change- \nlings have a modicum of skill with a few Arts, though they have limits on what they \ncan affect, dictated by various Realms of existence. Furthermore, fueling magical \npowers requires the use of special tricks called Bunks, seemingly random little \ngestures or games. Changelings harvest the power of creativity from artistic mortals, \neither by inspiration or by stealing the essence of dreams. This distilled power, \nGlamour, takes many random forms, but it ultimately ties a changeling to the dream \nworlds that exist parallel to mundane existence. \nOnly a few weapons prove truly deadly to changelings. Obviously, their mortal \nbodies are just as vulnerable to damage as anyone else, but their faerie souls can only \nbe permanently quenched with magic or cold iron. “Cold iron” doesn’t necessarily seem \n\n\nto mean iron that’s physically cold, \nthough; it has more to do with impure, \nnatural iron. Dream-beasts and weap- \nons also hurt changelings, though not as \nbadly. A changeling who dies mortally \nis apparently completely dead; one who \ndies in dreams falls into a coma, reviv- \ning with no memory of changelings. \nChangelings tend to gather at \nplaces patronized by artists, of course, \nbut they also hold special realms called \nFreeholds. A Freehold is a faerie for- \ntress, often with its own dream \nappearance. Mortals tend to avoid such \nplacesdue to the effects of the Mists. In \nFreeholds, changelings can replenish \ntheir power, and sometimes even call \nupon new dream allies or treasures. \nFAERIE LOREX 5 \nYou know most secrets of faerie \nand changeling society. Changelings, \nfor instance, are faerie souls in human \nbodies, there in an attempt to survive in the mortal realm. True faeries are gone from \nthe world-only their mortal remnants live on now, some even unaware of their true \nnatures. These changelings protect themselves from Banality by hiding in mortal \nforms, reincarnating into new bodies when their mortal host shells die (except the \nsidhe - \nnobody knows what happens to them). The changelings that survive come \nfrom various groups, or kiths. Each kith traces its heritage back to a fragment of myth \nand dream. You can name the various kiths, as well as their common capabilities, and \nyou know about the existence of some unusual types of faeries in Asia and Native \nAmerican cultures, though particulars are sketchy at best. A rare few humans inherit \na little faerie blood but not a true soul; these kinain are valuable relatives, some even \npossessing a few changeling tricks. \nYou’ve learned about the names and effects of various changeling Arts and the \ncorresponding Realms. Furthermore, you’re familiar with the different common \nmodes ofgaining Glamour- Reverie, Rapture and Ravaging-and \nyou know about \nBunks and how to perform them. You’re aware of the distinction between the \nchimerical world and the “real” one, and of chimerical damage, faerie miens and how \nto influence both. The more esoteric aspects of faerie existence are still sketchy in \nyour experience, though you’ve heard tales about mighty quests, magical treasures \ncapable of instilling wonder and magic, realms of fantastic legend where youth and \nhope are restored and paths to immortality and true reconciliation for the fragmen- \ntary human and fae souls. \nO n  the flip side, you can also be a danger to the fae: Cold iron, unrefined and \nin its natural unalloyed iron state, is anathema, capable of inflicting mortal wounds \nand even destroying a faerie soul completely. As creatures of dream and wonder, \nfaeries are also vulnerable to disbelief and - \nmore terribly - \nboredom. A change- \nling can also be injured by dream-weapons or creatures (that is, chimera); this sort \n\n\nof injury is more likely to render a changeling comatose and without memories due \nto the Mists, though. Furthermore, you know that changelings can be held to their \noaths, if they swear under the old forms, though such oaths can paradoxically grant \nthem the strength of will to fulfill their sworn promises. \nEven if you’ve never been to a Freehold, you know about the existence of these \nwellsprings of Glamour, their tendency to shift time and space and the balefire \nhearths that represent their power. The rulers of Freeholds are usually changeling \nnobles, which generally means one of the sidhe; however, some commoners hold \nsites, and the titles of nobles (duke, count and so on) vary widely enough to indicate \narange ofpossible possessions and treasures. You also know about the Dreaming, and \nhave heard of the Deep Dreaming. The tales of Arcadia are no stranger to your ears, \nthough you know that it is sadly closed and lost. You’ve heard the salutory rumors \nof various gates and doorways to realms of faerie or even to Arcadia itself, though \nthese are nothing but faraway legends, of course. \nOTHER LORES \nMaking up other Lore Abilities is a task left to the individual Storyteller. Just \nabout any group or supernatural phenomenon in the World of Darkness could be a \nsubject of a specialized Lore. Some examples: \nCainite Lore: Deeper secrets of vampires, covering such things as the Book of \nNod, particulars of the Blood Bond, the development of Disciplines, lost bloodlines \nand the like. (Sometimes mistakenly called Kindred Lore - \nremember, only \nCamarilla Licks call themselves “Kindred,” so that’s a misnomer.) \nCamarilla or Sabbat Lore: Understanding of the history, policies and influential \nmembers of a particular vampire society. Useful for ghouls, revenants and neonate \nvampires who want to get ahead, or hunters who specialize in dealing with one \ngroup’s particular tactics. \nClan Lore: The inside scoop on a given clan of vampires. Great for toadying \nghouls on a waiting list. \nGarou Lore: The particulars ofshapeshifter society, includingranks, rites, Gifts, \nspirit dealings, history, the Silver Record, the Litany and so on. Higher levels may \nimpart some knowledge of other shapeshifter types. Useful for kinfolk. \nHsien Lore: Special knowledge of the hsien, the heavenly messengers of Asia. \nInfernal Lore: Knowledge of infernalists and demonologists, their practices, \npowers and forbidden magic. \nKinfolk Lore: Study into the recessive side of the shifting family, the limits of \nkinfolk, how their lineages interact with shifters and what sorts of powers they can \nunlock. Good for kinfolk in general (though they would not automatically have such \nknowledge) or for garou making a study of their relatives. \nMage Lure: The wiles, Traditions and techniques of powerful willworkers. \nMummy Lore: A bit ofexperience with theever-reincarnating Reborn, whether \nfrom Egypt or from other versions of the Spell of Life. \nSpirit Lore: Congress with and knowledge of the various natural spirits and \ncelestial entities in the Umbra and beyond. \nTribal Lore: An understanding of the tribal secrets and hidden history of a \nparticular family of werewolves. This is a good Lore for a kinfolk studying his \nparticular tribe, or someone studying the weaknesses inherent to one tribe. \n\n\nWyrmLore: The black secrets of the Wyrm, the Triatic entity ofcorruption and \nthoughtless destruction. \nO N  R E C ~ U L A T I N ~  \nLORES \nObviously, the learning curve of the average player is going to exceed the \nExperience-Trait-earning curve of the average player, making the regulation of \nLores as purchased in your chronicles somewhat difficult. A player’s character might \nlearn more about a particular type of supernatural creature in one night than he’ll \never have the Experience Traits to buy the requisite levels of Lore to represent. \nIf you are running a chronicle, it is important to know when to anticipate this \naccelerated learning curve. If you are creating a human character for a largely \nvampire-populated chronicle, for instance, it may be advisable to put a cap on the \nlevel of Lore the human may purchase after character creation. After all, if a human \nenters the game with one level of Vampire Lure, and some loose-lipped Ventrue \nhistorian spills the beans as he understands things, purchasing more levels of Vampire \nLore is no longer cost-effective. However, you might state that any knowledge an \nuninitiated character gains about a supernatural creature must be purchased in the \nLore path, or the character will “forget” what he has learned. \nOn the whole, however, it is worthwhile to note that these lores are best used \nas roleplaying notes. If a hunter character has gained only the first level of Vumpire \nLure, make sure he acts on the supposition that vampires are repulsed by the cr \ngarlic, their own reflection and the barrier of running water. Having a hunter (even \na Storyteller character) learn from his mistakes and adapt to the true World of \nDarkness makes for a much more dramatic story than having someone say, “Okay, \nthis is what I think I know; what’s the truth?” \nBecause, after all, finding out the night’s true secrets and surviving to tell the \ntale of how you learned them is so much more rewarding in the end. \nI \nI \nI \nr \nI \n\n\n... \n__ . ... . -. . . \n- -. . \n- \nSTRINCj QUARTFT \nby Richard E. Dansky \nWe intend to include a piece of World of Darkness fiction in every issue of the \nJournal. Fiction dealing with the World ofDarkness offers insights into the lives and \ntimes of the people (i.e., the characters) who inhabit it, and such insights offer you \n(as players and Storytellers) flavor and spice to make your Mind’s Eye Theatre \ngames all the more attractive. Mind’s Eye Theatre releases should be simulta- \nneously entertaining and useful. This piece, in line with the theme ofthis issue, gives \na glimpse of what it’s like to be the bad guy in the World of Darkness. A bad guy’s \nmotivations are important to any story, but how to play a bad guy is something that \ngets overlooked. How does one act? What does one do to accomplish his sinistergoah? \nHow does one think? Read on to find out. \n~ \n~ \n~~~~ \nPARTI: \nTHE WEB \nThere is nothing quite like squeezing through a heating vent to make one lose all \nappreciation for the dessert tray. \nThat’s what Todd the Grey was thinking, anyway, as he hauled himself out of the \nduct and turned to place the vent cover where he’d be able to reach it later. One of the \nscrews went skittering across the wooden floor, and with a silent curse Todd retrieved \nit in his long, chalky fingers. His face a pallid mask of concern, he looked up at the figure \nsnoring on the bed across the room, still blissfully asleep. \nTodd grinned. Even on his worst day, he still had it. “Not too shabby still, old \nman,” he hissed to himself, and stalked toward the figure on the bed. \nThe man lying in the tangle of blankets was huge, at least six and a half feet \nin height. His barrel chest rose and fell in time with his titanic snores, which were \nloud enough to be physically painful to Todd’s sensitive ears. The man’s face was \nwide, florid and bearded, and his massive hands clenched and unclenched in \nrandom, spasmodic motions. \n“You look a lot better when you’re blue, old man,” Todd whispered, studying his \ntarget for a moment. Normally Todd knew the man in his other guise, that of a troll \nknight with the laughable name of Waldo. Tonight, however, he was just plain old \nWally Bergen, and plain old Wally didn’t have a hope in hell against the subtlest, most \ninfamous and best paid (the last was important, Todd told himself) assassin the sluagh \nhad ever spawned. \nTruth be told, Waldo didn’t stand much of a chance either. Todd was that good. \nSir Waldo had made a mistake, you see. At court, he’d had a few too many mugs \nof ale and gotten a little too loud about certain indiscretions other court members had \nmade. Someone had taken offense, someone with a great deal of money to spend on \nvengeance. That someone had hired Todd the Grey. \nAs usual, Todd wore his working clothes -black \nsilk, from head to toe, and \npaper#soled shoes. He eschewed both gloves and mask - \nhe liked neither his \nvision nor his spidery fingers obstructed when he went to work. As always, he wore \na belt of black braided leather, with a single slim dagger and a single black pouch. \nHis fine, long hands paused over the dagger for a moment, then reached into the \npouch. He smiled softly as he drew forth a gentle handful of what looked like tiny \nSTRING \nQUARTET \na \n\n\nclockwork toys, all shaped like spiders. The largest had a single human hair tied \naround one leg. \n“Time for work, my children,” he said. He blew gently across the handful of toys, \nand the spiders came alive. Silently, gracefully, they sprung from Todd’s hand to the \nbeard of the man beneath, nimbly making their way up toward his face. One by one they \nvanished into his mouth, his nose, his ears. Within seconds, all had disappeared, leaving \nonly a smiling Todd to witness their departure. \nWith infinite care, Todd moved back to the duct, slid inside, and replaced \nthe vent. Behind him, the tenor of Wally’s snoring was changing. The Inner \nSpinners had gone to work. Todd permitted himself a last glimpse of his prey, and \nthen he vanished. \n*** \nWally jolted from his sleep with a choked snort. He sat up and tried to suck in a \nlungful of air to clear his head of the nightmares he’d been having and found to his \nhorror that he couldn’t. His mouth and nose were stuffed with something cold and \nsticky, and he could feel things swarming around inside his mouth. They were crawling, \nhe could feel it, and filling his throat with more of that same sticky stuff. In a panic, he \nbrought his hands to his mouth to try to tear out whatever was in there, but he could \nonly pull away tiny clumps of spiderweb while the creatures inside kept on spinning \nmore and more of it and the terrible pressure in his chest kept on building. \nThe last thing Sir Waldo, for he had returned to his fae mien in desperation, saw \nwas one of the Inner Spinners taking aleisurely walk across his left eye. Thankfully, after \nthat, he saw no more. \n*** \nIt was nearly dawn when the spiders finished marching themselves home. Todd \nhad been up waiting, sharpening his knives impatiently and otherwise engaging in all \nthe rituals of a worried parent. “There you are at last,” he said with relief when the first \nclumped its way onto his windowsill. “It certainly took you longenough.”The column \nof spiders halted and wobbled uncertainly. “Yes, I know what took you so long - \nhe \nhad a big, big mouth, didn’t he? That’s why you had to go pay him a visit. Now sit \nyourselves down and rest. You’ll need your strength.” \nOne by one, the clockwork spiders nestled themselves up so that Todd could \nsweep them, gently, back into his pouch. As the last one vanished into its dark \nconfines, Todd smiled the smile of a gently loving father. After all, they were his \nchildren in a sense, and they’d just helped him carry on the family business. \nPART \nI I :  CAT’S CRADLE \nSlander always thought it was in poor taste for any wraith to sing“Maxwe1l’s Silver \nHammer,”muchless an Artificer. Unfortunately, the wraith inquestion was apotential \nclient, and as poor as his taste might be, it would be infinitely worse form for Slander \nto turn him into a tasteful desk accessory. So Slander just made do with various idle \ndefenestration fantasies as he tailed the Artificer to the previously arranged meeting \npoint. \nIt didn’t make the trip any more pleasant, Slander noted, that the bastard couldn’t \ncarry a tune in a bucket. \nEventually the Artificer, a short, squat man in painfully anachronistic overalls \nand work boots, ducked into a nondescript shop off the agora. Slander, wearing the \nface he’d once seen on a coin of Imperial Roman vintage, waited what might once \nhave been three heartbeats, then followed the client in. It was a trap, of course. These \nsorts of situations were always traps. The clients in these cases always had a particular \nflavor of nervousness that gave them away instantly. Still, the question of for whom \nthe trap had been set remained open. \nM I N D ’ S  \nE Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n\n\nIt was no surprise when the outer door slammed shut, though the utter darkness \nthat resulted was startling. There was no light, no light at all. Slander could see nothing, \nand the assassin’s brief glimpse of the room wasn’t enough to allow recollection of \nanything more than the haziest details. \nAnd then, in the darkness, there came a sound. It was a soft sound and \nregular, the sound of a rocking chair. Slander stopped and tried to track the sound. \nIt came from everywhere and nowhere, and every time Slander made a move \ntoward it the sound faded. Eventually, the assassin shrugged, gave up the fruitless \nchase, and stood perfectly still, waiting. \n“Three minutes, Slander. I’m disappointed,” came the voice of the wraith Slander \nhad presumed was the client. “I’d been led to expect that you’d come to your current \nconclusion much more quickly, and with fewer bumps on the shins.” \n“Who are you?” Slander asked, not expecting an answer. \n“I’m with the Magisterium Veritatis, Slander, though my name is unimportant at \nthe moment. What is important is that you’ve been a rather spectacular thorn in the \nMagisterium’s side. However, you’ve got some very powerful friends, so I wanted to talk \nto you.” \n“Talk?” \n“Talk. Honestly, Slander, I have enough from just our dealings to get you \nhammered into a wind chime to hang off the weathervane on the Onyx Tower, but \nreally, I just want to talk.” \nSlander shrugged invisibly. “Then why all of the rigmarole? Why the blackout?” \n“You can’t see me, you can’t take out your disappointment on me. For my part, I \nwas blind from birth until death, so this places me at a distinct advantage. I’m used to \nthis. And in the meantime, this gives me enough of an edge that you’ll talk instead of \ntrying anything, at least for a little while.” \n“So what do you want to know?” Slander’s tone was neutral, guarded. \n“Names of clients, names of targets, methods by which you can be contacted, your \nconnection to the Masquers’ Guild.” \n“The Guild doesn’t exist.” \n“And my name is Charon, Imperator of this Golden Age of Stygia. Tell you what, \nSlander. Why don’t we pretend that I’ve asked the first round of questions, and you’ve \nmade your categorical denials about client confidentiality and so on. Honor and form \nhave been satisfied, now we can get down to brass tacks. Who’s next, and why? I won’t \ninterfere, but I want to know who, when, why and how.” \n“What’s it to you?” \nThe invisible voice made sounds like its owner was shifting in its chair. “Because \nsomething big is coming, Slander, and 1 want to understand it. 1 want to know why so \nmany Anacreons and old-time wraiths throw roadblocks in my way every time 1 try to \ngo after you or anyone like you, and I want to know where you fit in. So, now it’s your \nturn for an answer. Who’s next?” \nSlander spoke quickly, but without emotion. “Szandor Holzy is my next target. \nHe’s in the Grim Legion, relatively high up, and he’s annoyed a consortium of Gaunts \nfrom the Emerald and Skeletal Legions, apparently over a matter of allocating space \nat the shipyards. Grim ships are getting precedence over the ones belonging to other \nLegions, and Holzy’s going to be made an example. One would assume that the fact \nthat dockyard refit space has suddenly become a hot issue is enough of a clue as to \nwhat’s going on for you, yes?” \n“Certainly interesting, yes. Do you have anything else for me?” \n“One more tidbit you might find of interest.” \n“Oh?” \nSTRING \nQUARTET \n\n\n“You’ve been set up. Those Domens and Gaunts you mentioned earlier have \ndecided that you’re a nuisance. Unfortunately, Holzy isn’t quite the next one on my list. \nYou are.” \nSlander picked up the sound of the figure launching itself across the room, the \nnoise of the chair swinging empty. “Interesting. I think I’ll be leaving now.” \n‘‘I think you won’t,” Slander said. “The wraiths on your team are involved. \nHand-picked. As for the darkness, well ...” A moment of concentration was all it \ntook before a soft yellow glow spilled from Slander’s perfectly still form. “One of \nthe first tricks we teach youngsters in the Guild, centurion. I’m surprised you \ndidn’t know that. Now don’t struggle, and I’ll make it so it doesn’t hurt.” \nFrom the sounds of the screams the guards outside the sealed building heard, \nit was obvious that the poor fool inside had indeed struggled. They nodded \nknowingly to one another, and then they guarded the building some more. It was \nwhat they were paid to do, after all. \nIn the end, there was silence inside, except for the sound of a rocking chair. \nIt creaked slowly and steadily as the wraith sitting in the chair rocked back and \nforth, back and forth. Slander was in no hurry, after all. His attention wasn’t on \nthe furnishings, the walls or even the door. \nSlander was paying very close attention to the game of cat’s cradle he was playing, \ninstead. After all, snapping the wraith you were playing with was said to be bad luck, \nvery bad luck indeed. \nPART \nI I I :  RED TAPE \nIt was an office park, much like any other office park. All of the buildings \nwere a single story, with flat roofs guaranteed to resonate like bass drums during \na hard rainstorm. Each building was some variation on a basic blocky rectangle, \nwith tall windows and glass doors and white lettering over each doorway pro- \nclaiming proudly that TechStar Consultants or some equivalent laired within. \nIn one of these mundane buildings, behind an equally mundane glass door, \nrested the offices of Proac Environmental Consultants, a firm devoted to helping \ncompanies deal with the ever-changing complexities of EPA regulations. Today’s \nperfectly legal barrel of solvent was tomorrow’s $100,000 fine waiting to happen, \nand smart firms hired someone like PEC to help them stay one step ahead of the \ngovernment officials. It was part of doing business, after all - \npaying a little up \nfront to clean things up could save millions in fines on the back end. Proac (or \nsome firm very much like it) was just the company to help businesses over that \nparticular hump. \nOn this particular afternoon (64 degrees and partially cloudy, with the light \ncoming down in bored curtains of chiaroscuro through the gaps in the clouds), a \nmeeting of singular importance was taking place in Proac’s offices. Seated in the small \nconference room that housed all of the firm’s good office chairs were a woman and two \nmen, one of whom was of singular appearance. The man in question was all of five and \na half feet tall and grossly fat. His chin, such as it was, sagged down until it was \nindistinguishable from the cavernous folds of his neck. He was bald, with a wrinkled \npate and a broad, flat nose that turned up in a way that reminded observers of either an \nancient prizefighter or a young hog. He wore a suit of greenish-gray fabric and a yellow \nshirt, and his massive hands spilled from jacket cuffs that were an inch too short to hide \nhis thick wrists. \nThe other two, oddly enough, were thrilled to see him. \n“We are very, very happy that you’re interested in joining us here, Mr. \nSheldon,” said the woman. She was tall and angular and thin, with faded blonde \nhair and a severe blue suit. “We know that you’re moving from the other side of \nM I N D ’ S  \nE Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n\n\nthe fence, as it were - \nMagadon is not exactly known for its adherence to \nenvironmental regulations - \nbut we really look forward to the expertise you can \nbring to our operations. And you come very, very highly recommended.” Beside \nher, a small man with brown hair and mannerisms that would have fit better on \na sparrow, nodded nervously and repeated the phrase “highly recommended” two \nor three times before fading into a humiliated silence. \nThe man on the other side of the table smiled a wide, wide smile, showing \nperhaps a few more teeth than most people would consider appropriate for a business \nmeeting. “Honestly, it’s my pleasure, Miss - \nit is Miss, yes - \nSchiller. I’ve been part \nof the problem, as it were, long enough. Now it’s time to be part of the solution. I’m \nvery much looking forward to being part of your team. When can I start?” \n“Ahem.”The nervous little man, Schiller’s assistant, cleared his throat, nervously, \nof course. “There is the matter of compensation, which we still haven’t ironed out yet. \nNow the figures you’ve provided as your acceptable range-” \n“If they’re too high, I’m open to negotiation.” Sheldon spread his big, soft hands \nin a gesture of magnanimity. “Really, that’s only an initial range.” \nThe little man, who went by the name of Keenan, shook his head vehemently, \nalmost dislodging his carefully combed-over hair from his forehead. “Nonononono. \nActually, I was going to say that your numbers were well below what we were expecting. \nWe were going to come in with an offer substantially higher than the range you \nproposed, which, frankly, I find a little puzzling when it comes to dealing with someone \nwith vour (of course) superb qualifications.” \nSheldon placed his hands on the table, palms down, and actually managed to \nlook embarrassed. “Well, I have a confession to make. I more or less lowballed \nmyself.” \n“Why!” \n“Well, because I really want the position. Call it the guilt discount for some of the \nthings that I worked on at Magadon. Though if you feel compelled to pay me more, how \nabout this as a compromise: Give me a net point on all the new business that I bring in \nthrough my contacts for the next twelve months, and then we can talk about adding \nanother point or going to straight additional compensation. But honestly, all that is \nsecondary.” Keenan had already tuned him out and was scribbling figures frantically on \nthe yellow pad in front of him. Schiller leaned forward, interested. \n“Secondary? That may be a first, frankly. Usually we have to cut these \ninterviews short when the interviewee decides that we can’t pay enough.” \nSheldonsmiled that too-wide smile again. “Look, Miss Schiller, let me level with \nyou. I want to work here, and I’ve done my research. I know you, and I know your \ncompany, and I know you’re not doing anywhere near as well as you could be. There \nare a lot: of companies out there who’d rather gamble with the EPA than pay you to \nstraighten their acts out. They all lose in the end,” he paused and shrugged, as if he \nknew that fact all too well, “but try telling them that until the time the government \ninspecmrs show up on their doorsteps with plastic bags and notepads. So, we need to \nfind a way to get them to listen to you, even when they don’t want to listen. We’ve \ngot to find a way to trick them, essentially, into buying what you’re selling. And that’s \nwhere I come in. These men don’t want to hear about how they can obey the law. Sad \nbut true, they want to hear how they can beat it, hypercompetitive bastards that they \nare. So we reposition Proac’s approach. We still provide the same product, but we sell \nit as a way to get around the EPA, a way to buy some time for compliance so it doesn’t \ncost as much. Let them think they’re getting away with something and they’ll pay \nthrough the nose for it; give them honest value and they’ll go looking for a bargain. \nHell, if any of them had any sense of responsibility in the first place, this company \nwouldn’t exist, right? So let me pitch it to you straight: I’ll take point. I’ll go in to the \nS T R I N ~  \nQUARTET \n\n\noil companies and the petrochem boys and the paint manufacturers and I’ll let them \nthink that I’m on their side. After all, I’ve got the Magadon credentials, right? I can’t \npossibly be one of those naughty environmentalists. And then I give them the \npresentation on how they can ‘work around’ the EPA, when really what we’re doing \nis just stringing out their cleanup so that it looks like a money saver. They think \nthey’re getting away with something, we get increased business and the EPA gets what \nit wants, eventually. It’s just this way the bad guys aren’t so inclined to dig their heels \nin and fight tooth and nail.” \nSchiller uncrossed her arms and leaned forward. She smiled. “I’d be very \ninterested in seeing your proposed presentation, Mr. Sheldon. Robert?” she called \nto Keenan, still scribbling away, “I think Mr. Sheldon’s proposal is very intrigu- \ning. Think you can work out the contract language?” \n“Cfcourse.” Keenan sounded hurt. “I’ll have it ready for the lawyers to look at by three.” \n“Excellent.” Internally, Sheldon was laughing. Schiller was clearly hooked, \nand Keenan was a nonentity. The woman had clearly caught the smell of money \nand she’d follow it off the path of her principles. Soon delays in conforming would \nturn into workarounds and avoidance, and she’d justify each step to herself. \nHonestly, if she were half as smart as she thought, she never would have fallen for \nthe lowball technique. Clearly, she wanted to believe he’d come work for her \nnickel and dime outfit out of the goodness of his heart, and that was her weakness. \nShe’d profit by it in one sense, but not without paying the price. Proac would be \ndiverted from its original purposes, and so profitably that no one could gainsay the \nslow change. God help any actual environmentalists on board, because no one in \nmanagement was going to. \n“Mr. Sheldon,” she said. “for a former oil company executive, you are remarkably,” \nand she laughed, “green.” \nSheldon joined in her laughter. “My dear Miss Schiller,” said the Toad, “you \nhave no idea of just how green 1 really am. No idea at all.” \nPART \nIV: LOOSE THREADS \nThree and three they flew, three above and three below. Seen from the proper \nangle, Murder’s Daughters formed a perfect diamond. Seen from another, they were just \nanother unkindness of ravens riding a cold, angry wind. \nThe land they flew over was brown with dead leaves and gray with asphalt; it was \na place of square white houses with square mown lawns. It was a place where nothing \nextraordinary would be allowed to happen, where good and evil would both be kept at \nbay by the desire of the residents for normalcy above all else. \nGood tended to respect this desire. Unfortunately, evil didn’t. \nThe six ravens swooped over the neighborhood once, twice, three times, then \nfound their target and dove for it. One by one they swooped through an open window \non the second floor of an otherwise utterly ordinary house, landing one by one in an \nutterly ordinary computer room that just happened to have a corpse on the floor. \nThe dead man was of median height, with a florid face and eyes that stared \nunseeing in death. He wore a white dress shirt, strained a bit across his belly, and navy \nslacks. He wore no shoes, and there was a hole in the heel of one of his hideous argyle \nsocks. There was no blood, no sign of violence, but he was quite dead. \n“So,” said the eldest of Murder’s Daughters (for where there had been three plus \nthree ravens now sat six women with hair as black as coal, “anyone know why this one \ncalled so strongly?” \n“Not I,” said the next in age. “But we all heard it.” The others all nodded. \n“Perhaps we could ask him?” said the youngest. “Surely he would know why his \ndeath called us here.” \nM I N D ’ S  \nE Y E  T H E A T R E  J O U R N A L  \n4D \n\n\nThe third and fourth nodded in agreement, while the fifth, who was jealous of the \nyoungest, said “Hmmph!” and turned away. The eldest pondered a moment, and said, \n“An excellent idea. Gwen, will you grant me the privilege ?“ The youngest flushed and \nnodded wordless approval. The eldest smiled, and shifted, and where there had been a \nwoman was a raven. The raven stepped gingerly onto the corpse and peered at his eyes \nhungrily, then cocked her head at a curious angle. She stood that way for a long minute, \nwhile her five companions watched anxiously. Then, suddenly, she flew to the top of \nthe monitor on the desk against the far wall and perched, agitatedly. \n“He’s not giving permission,” said the eldest, for Murder’s Daughters can under- \nstand the tongue of ravens while in woman’s form. “I’m not allowed.” \n“Just take it,” said the fifth oldest, anxious to outshine the youngest. “He’s dead. \nIt’s not as if he can stop you.” \nThe second oldest fixed her with an angry stare. “We must always ask. Even \nbefore we drink the eyes of the worst, the lowest, the foulest, we must ask. Raven \ntaught us thus, and so we follow his teachings. To do otherwise is to invite \ndisaster.” And the four eldest turned their back on their younger sibling, who \nblushed red with shame and anger. \n‘‘Perhaps I should try,” said the third eldest, who knelt before the dead man and \nwhispered imploring words to him. She knelt as long as the eldest had waited, then \nshook her head as well and stood. “He wants nothing from us but abandonment.” \nThe youngest stood when she heard this. The others all looked at her, save the \nnearest to her in age, who turned to stare pointedly out the still-open window. “Perhaps \nI could try?” \n“TWO \nof us have already spoken to him, girl,’’ said the second oldest. “What can \nyou say that they have not?” \nThe youngest said nothing to this, but only asked, “Please?” So the oldest and the \nsecond oldest looked at each other, and nodded assent, and the youngest changed \nherself into the form Raven had given her mother’s mother’s mother’s mother. \nAnd so, as a bird the youngest stood near the man’s face and asked the spirit of the \ndead man if he’d give up his eye to her. Wordlessly, she felt his assent, though she felt \nsorrow as well. And so she drank deep of his right eye, to see what he had seen in his \nlast moments of life. The others watched in silence and respect and waited for the \nyoungest to speak in her own time. \nShe changed first, and this was something unprecedented amongst Murder’s Daugh- \nters. Always one spoke of one’s visions of the dead while in raven form, out of custom. \n“Girl, what did you see?“ The eldest’s tone was ice, for she had a long respect for \nthe way things had always been done. \n“Rutcher the body,” said the youngest, in a voice colder still. “Tear out his other \neye. Make strings ofhis guts. Kill him all over again.” She turned to where the dead man \nlay on the, floor and spat on his now-bloody face. Then, eschewing raven form, she \nwalked out the door into the house, and thus made her way out. \n[t was the one who was now the youngest who made the first cut, using a knife of \nbone that she’d taken from a dead man. After a second’s hesitation, the others joined \nin. By the time five ravens flew away from the house, the room was an abbatoir, the \ncorpse a bloody ruin. \n.4nd the sixth? She stood on the sidewalk outside her father’s house and tried to \nforger what she had seen through his eyes, something that made it kinder to make it look \nas if he’d been murdered than to allow the truth to be found. For three hours and three \nmore she stood there. Then, when the last red rays of the setting sun struck her, she \nchanged to raven form and flew off to the west. Someone was waiting there for her, she \nwas sure of it. And nothing waited for her in that house any more. \nS T R I N C ~  \nQUABTET \nQp \n\n\nM € T  PRFvIFW \nby Cynthia Summers \nit’s all you can think about. When’s it due out? \nWhatissueswillitaddress? How willitchn \nLAWSOETHB \nNIC~HT \nREDUX \nWhy? Because it needed doing. \nNow that that’s out of the way, let’s get into the other stuff. \nAfter writing for and editing the revised edition of Vampire, I realized that \nLaws of the Night wasn’t going to hold up to the sudden influx of new material \ncoming in. The World of Darkness was reinventing itself, and ye olde faithful Laws \nof the Night, as it stood, just wasn’t up to the challenge. Sure enough, the questions \nabout a new edition of Laws of the Night started to pour in as soon as the news \nabout VRev hit the press. I decided to bump the incipient Kindred of the East \ntranslation back somewhat on the schedule and prepare for a second edition of \nLaws of the Night. I did all this juggling within a few hours of suddenly receiving \nthe job of MET developer - \na scheduling feat something like watching the gates \ncome down when one is in the middle of the railroad crossing. \nThe writers I hunted down are some of MET’S best, bringing their experience \nas players and Storytellers to the task at hand. They include: \nPeter Woodworth- After auditioning with The Shining Host and further \ndisplaying his talents with Laws of the Wyld West, Peter was entrusted with the \nmonumental task of writing up the sections on rules and drama, and also the allies \nand antagonists. In addition to all this, he’s going to school and is becoming a \nheckuva swing dancer. \nJason Carl- Jason wrote the Storytelling chapters for Laws of Elysium and \nThe Long Night, largely from his own experiences. I told him to write as if he were \ngetting the chance to sit down with every Storyteller new to LARPing and every \ngrizzled veteran who thinks there’s nothing new to learn - \nI hope you agree with \nme that he delivered as promised. \nJess Heinig - \nThe Mage developer comes with a long history of playing \nand Storytelling in California, and I gave him the monstrous chore of re- \ncreating character creation, the clans and the Disciplines. A hefty task, one \nhe was up to in spades. \n\n\nNow, the next big question on everyone’b minds - \nwhat’s been changed? \nWhy should Joe Vampire go pick this new edition up and set aside his faithful, \nragged Laws of the Night? \nFor starters, I’ve sought to make this book user-friendly for everyone, whether \nthe person picking it up is a longtime player getting the latest edition or someone \nextremely new to LARPing (or even the world of Vampire). Anyone can pick it \nup and start playing with a minimum of effort, and a new player can read the intro \nto get a sense of what’s happening. A new Storyteller has everything he needs to \nstart a small chronicle in his living room, whereas a veteran can pick up some tricks \nto make his life easier when the new players arrive. \nThe biggest effort came in when I incorporated anumber ofchanges that come \nnot only fromvampire but also from some five years ofsteady LARPing experience \nin various styles and venues. Consider that the real playtest -years of rugged wear \nand tear to see what lasts and what becomes the bane of existences. For example, \nspending a Willpower now allows you only to retest on a Social or Mental \nChallenge, not to ignore it. This proviso eliminates the problem of some cheese- \nweasel thinking he can blow through an elder’s Malesty or using Willpower to avoid \nbeing trapped by a social Discipline so he can mulch someone else. Likewise, \nHumanity, Paths of Enlightenment and Virtue came under hard scrutiny - \nhow \n“human” is a vampire with two Beast Traits, and how do you roleplay that? How \ndo these nifty new Paths of Enlightenment fit into the grand scheme of things? \nFrom Vampire, I brought in things that I had worked on during the book‘s creation \nand editing, such as the problem of Malkavians in fuzzy slippers (grrr ...) or how to \nroleplay the tightening hold of a blood bond. \nAnother major change to LotNZ is that the METstoryline has been advanced \nalong with the tabletop storyline. The Assamites have broken their blood curse \n(and Quietus suddenly has some sinister new uses), the Gangrel have abandoned \nthe sinking ship called the Camarilla and the entire clan of Malkav’s get has been \ninfected with Dementation. These changes don’t mean you have to chuck your \nentire storyline to start marching along with our drumbeat - \nthese developments \noccurred very much in secret (at this stage, even I don’t know how some of this stuff \nhappened), and you may choose to have your game touched by them only \nperipherally (for example, as strange rumors from the East Coast). \nOne question I’ve been hearing a lot is, “What happens to our old characters?” \nDon’t fret: thev don’t have to be retired. After all, it can be a lot of fun to \n’ \nthrough the mysteries of why the tetched Malkavian has suddenly become : \ntetched or what happens to city dynamics when the Gangrel as a whole tel \nCamarilla to go jump inalake. Asectiononupdatingcharacters has beeninch \nso chronicles can continue without missing a beat. \nAnd that is just some of what’s in store - \nhey, I can’t tell you everything 1 \nwould ruin the surprises)! So, if you’re new to Mind’s Eye Theatre and have \nlooking for a place to jump in, come on in. If you’re a battle-scarred trooper \nthinks there’s nothing new under the moon, this book is for you too. \nWelcome to the World of Darkness - \nThe Final Nights are upon us. \nNow that you know - \nor think you know - \nwhat’s in the new edition of La4 \nthe Night, kt’s take a look at what went into it from the writers’ perspectives. \n\n\nMy own vision of Vampire centers around a deep love of its ancient politics and \nthe highly delicate interactions between characters; happily enough, both are key \nelements to good live-action play. I believe the best stories for Masqerade games are \nmodeled after such influences as The Usual Suspects, tales in which hard facts are \nconcealed behind ever-shifting layers of personalities and deceit, and trust of any kind \nis a rare and often dangerous commodity. Unlike many Storytellers I have observed \nin the past, I don’t encourage total free-for-all backstabbing. Players tend to feel \nfrustrated and have a lot of out of character disputes when they thinkabsolutely no one \ncan be ever trusted. What true allies you do acquire in a Vampire game had better be \nready to stand by you come hell or high water, though. Supernatural powers are the \nicing on this decidedly deadly cake, an element that forces characters to adapt and \ninnovate constantly lest they fall prey to a vampire who has mastered more of her arts. \nIndeed, many of the basic Disciplines simply exaggerate existing human traits to a \nsupernatural degree; therefore, it is little surprise that vampires are often overblown \nrepresentations of what we dread we might become ourselves, from debauched artists \nto callous financiers to killers in the night. Imagine the paranoia a miserly millionaire \nfeels when guarding his treasures then imagine the fear that comes when he knows his \nfoes can sway emotions, change shape or even read his mind! \nAbove all, the most persistent thought that came to me while I was working on this \nbook was just how many people play Vampire in its live-action incarnation. The notion \nthat what I was writing would have an impact on so many different games just staggered \nme. It felt a little like taking the stage on opening night after months of rehearsals or \nbeing called up to the big leagues for the first time after doing a season in the minors. It’s \nexhilarating, sure, but more than a little scary, too, when you realize that not only will \nso many people be reading your work but that they’ll be testing it constantly for things \nlike fairness and playability as well. Add to that the fact that many dissatisfied souls will \nregister their opinions of your work, your writing ability and your family tree on the Web, \nand you’ve got yourself a genuine writer’s Maalox moment. Fortunately, my trusty troupe \npulled me through the worst early jitters, and I acquired a whole new appreciation for \na game I had thought I’d gotten to know top to bottom over the last six years. \nVampire turned the gaming world on its ear when it was released; Masquerade \ndid it again with the introduction of live-action gaming on a large scale. Now the \nrevised Vampire is turning heads and rocking worlds, and I hope that Laws of the \nNight 2nd Edition can carry on that proud tradition. Semper Vitae! \n- \nPeter Woodworth \nI started preparing to write the Storytelling chapter of this book long before \nCynthia asked me to contribute. Of course, I just didn’t know that I was preparing for it. \nIsn’t that the way these things often happen? My primary source of ideas was the stack \nof Storytelling notes I’d been compiling since discovering MET some six years ago. \nBefore I actually wrote anything, I forced myself to wade through this morass of half- \nfinished thoughts, lengthy polemics and nuggets of genuinely useful wisdom. The notes \nreminded me of an old adage: I learned a hell of lot more from my failures than from my \nsuccesses. My most useful ideas were the results of Storytelling experiences that didn’t \nturn out quite the way I expected or hoped, but it was clear that most of my errors could \nhave been remedied with some frank and solid advice from more experienced Storytell- \ners. So that’s what I decided I wanted to contribute to this book: In addition to providing \nnovice and experienced Storytellers alike the basic tools of the trade, I wanted to offer \nalk about what it really means to tell stories for this game. \n\n\nHowever, I didn’t want to ignore the things that a Storyteller really needs to \nknow in order to run a successful game. I tried to pay particular attention to those \naspects of the game that have evolved most dramatically and rapidly. For example, \nthe first edition of the game presumed that Storytellers would run relatively small- \nscale games of limited duration. These nights, it’s not uncommon for Storytellers \nto work with groups of fifty players or more and devise plots that endure for years \nof continuous play - both of these considerations demand a change in the way \nStorytellers approach the game. Likewise, greater access to the Internet and the \nWorld Wide Web has changed the way Storytellers operate. The game no longer \nends when the players go home, and tonight’s Storyteller must take this extended \naccess into account or be drowned in a flood of e-mail. \nThe actual writing process is rather a blur in my memory, which, I suppose, is \na mercy of sorts. I do recall that I was sometimes frustrated in my attempts to \nprovide adequate information to the reader without straying too far from my core \nconcept. I also remember struggling with the right way to express certain ideas as \nclearly as possible without over-burdening the reader with unnecessary detail. \nFortunately, Cynthia offered plenty of direction, and that helped me stay focused \n- \nThanks, Cynthia! I think it’s appropriate that I also thank Melissa, my \nwonderful and beloved wife, for her steadfast support and for ignoring the constant \nsound of breaking glass that accompanies my writing efforts. \nIf1 could add anything to the manuscript I submitted, it would be a few more \nwords to Storytellers present and future: You’re an indispensable part of this game \nwe all enjoy with such fervor, and, whether or not we take the time to tell you, \nwe value what you do. \nThank you! \n- \nJason Carl \nSo there I was, playing an eighth-generation Tzimisce and getting pummeled \nseverely by a 13 th generation Lasombra who’d been created only minutes before. As his \nObfuscated cohort escaped (defeating my Advanced Auspex, no less) I buckled under \nthe force of the Potence-backed blows and thought, “This is seriously screwed up.” \nHaving just participated in the writing for the Guide to the Sabbat, I knew that \na lot of our existing Vampire material was sorely out of date, and Laws of the Night \nwas no exception. Laws of the Night had been compiled as an attempt to put together \na lot of out of print rules and to make accessible everything one needed to play live- \naction Vampire, all in an easy to carry format. It proved a smashing success, but many \nof the rules that it used originally had been taken from older material in The \nMasquerade Second Edition or, more decrepit still, the halcyon days of The Masquer- \nade Players Kit. The book tried to reconcile the differences between the first and \nsecond editions only halfheartedly; the idea was to make everything accessible, not \nnecessarily to rewrite all of the rules. Furthermore, the material had always been geared \ntoward small groups playing a few times. With the predominance of larger, longer- \nrunning games- and clubs like the Camarilla, boasting thousands ofplayers in a global \ncontinuity- this approach just didn’t work. Laws of the Night was showing its seams, \nand the material was pretty worn, too. \nSo, in my brief tenure as the Mind’s Eye Theatre developer, I settled on \npushing up the schedule for a revised edition of Laws of the Night. The sooner, \nthe better, I thought; besides, we wanted to address all of the changes in the revised \nM E T  PREVIEW \n6 \n\n\nVampire quickly. That rush moved the book up to a year after the release of \nVampire Revised. Even after I moved over to the Mage line and Cynthia Summers \nstepped up to Mind’s Eye Theatre, the book stayed on schedule. However, the \nincreased pace meant writing a lot of material very fast, and we had only a few \nwriters lined up for live-action. So, a large chunk of the book‘s writing fell to me. \n“No problem,” I thought (as I often do when beginning daunting projects), “I \nhave a handle on writing live-action material. I wrote stuff for Laws of the Hunt \nand I play enough to know what to fix, what works and what to change.” \nIf ever there was proof that a game developer can be wrong in his estimation ofhis \nown material. Nonetheless, I pressed on, making a list of what needed to be addressed. \nFirst: Fix the Disciplines. The idea of Disciplines with widely varying numbers ofpowers \njust appalled me and seemed unfair. I wanted to put everything back to five levels of power. \nSecond: More detailed character creation. Specifically, Backgrounds had \nbeen included in a lot of other MET books since Laws of the Night; why leave \nthem out of Vampire? The Beast Trait system also seemed to miss some of the \npoints of Vampire -vampires who don’t fear fire or sunlight or don’t feel hunger? \nTime to change that. \nThird: Clan write-ups that don’t explain the clan are of limited use to the \nplayers. Admittedly, a lot of the original live-action material depended on players \nwho were familiar with the tabletop game, so describing the clans seemed \nredundant. The prevalence of silly Malkavians, absurd Ravnos and gangster \nGiovanni showed that a lot of people either weren’t reading the tabletop books or \nhadn’t been exposed to them. Many first-time players found the clans confusing \nand hard to differentiate from one another. It was time to fix that, so expanded \nwrite-ups and notes on how to play each clan seemed like a good idea. \n... so I was sitting in front of the computer 50,000 words later, and itstill wasn’t \ndone. I had waiting playtesters, an overly-patient developer and a headache. \nThe most important thing I learned from writing for Laws of the Night ?The \nDevil’s in the details. \nIn tabletop games, a lot can be left to interpretation. Small groups of five or \nsix players can decide on their own variants of rules, and Storytellers can use what \nmakes sense for their games. \nIn live-action, the game often has 15 or more players (some even number in \nthe hundreds), and it has to run for several hours without a hitch. Nobody can afford \nto stop and argue about rules for two hours. Every eventuality must be covered, from \nwhat happens when two people Summon the same victim at the same time (the \nsubject goes to the summoner with the best generation) to whether it’s better to \ncompress Blood Traits for ease of play (you wanna carry around 14 cards saying \n“vitae” and try to keep track of them all?) at the risk of skewing some of the systems. \nThen, we had to include the changes to Merits and Flaws, the new Influences \nintroduced in Laws of the Hunt, specializations, conversions from previous \neditions, the new Necromancy and Thaumaturgy paths all in the greatest detail \npossible, while staying concise enough to fit in a trade-size book. \nI hoDe you like what you’re getting. Now that all is said and done, it’s hard to look \ne’ve produced and judge it impartially. So we leave it to you to decide, \nNut saying this: You’re sure getting your money’s worth! \neinig \n\n\n1 I l . t :  L v r w y ~ r u u r -  - \n- \nThis classic includes everything you need to enter the world of the Kindred.

In this issue, howewer, I tackle some questions and issues about \nI \nthe world of LARPing in general, as well as some guidelines fm the Journal itself. \nHow do I get my LARP event \nlisted in the MET Journal? \nThis one’s pretty straightforward, \nthough I’ve never put the guidelines \ndown in an official format. Basically, \nwhat I’m looking for are World of Dark- \nness LARP events that occur with at \nleast monthly frequency. Your game \ndoesn’t have to be a Camarilla game or \npart of a large association, but it does \nhave to be aMind’s Eye Theatre World \nof Darkness game. Just e-mail submis- \nsions to me (carlawhite-wolf.com) in \nthe following format, and I’ll add you \nto the growing list: \nYour LARP’s Geographic Region \nYour LARP’s Title; the City and State you play in \nYour LARP’s Frequency (Avoid specific dates, as the Journal gets written \nYour Contact Person’s Name and an e-mail Contact Address \nYour Contact Person’s Phone Number \nmonths before you see it in stores.) \n(Oh, and put “MET Journal Event Horizon” in the subject line of your e- \nmail so my mail filters don’t choke or send it off to oblivion.) \n(How do I/can I) submit articles, stories and columns for publication in the \nMET Journal? \nI get this one a lot, and I must say I’m proud of the enthusiasm this little \nquarterly’s garnered already. If you want to pitch me an idea for a future article, \nhere’s what you do. First, check out the White Wolf web site (www.white- \n\n\nwolf.com), go to the “Games” link and scroll down to the “Writer’s Guide- \nlines” link. Read through the part about submissions to find the Non-Disclosure \nAgreement. Print out a copy of that form, fill it out, sign it and mail it in. \nWithout this completed form, I’ve got to toss your submission in the recycle \nbin, so don’t forget it. \nThen, when you’re pretty sure I’ve gotten your NDA form, send me \nan e-mail with the title “MET Journal Article Query” or just “MET \nJournal Article,” and pitch me your idea. You can also snail-mail the \nsubmission, along with your NDA, to the address listed on the first page \nof the Journal if you like. \nIt’s best to send a query for article submissions first (“Hey, I had a great idea \nabout werebats in MET”), because I might have a similar idea already in the works, \nor I just might not be ready to place your piece yet. In either case, it’s better to ask \nfirst rather than send me a completed article only to find I can’t use it. \nAs far as specifics go, that’s pretty much it. I look for articles that convert \nrules from our tabletop books into live-action (please, query about these first) \nrather than completely new rule sets. I also seek out articles on the state of \nLARPing in general, outside the game. And, of course, you’ve noticed that I \nprint letters and event-listings as well, so if you want to see your name in print, \nby all means, get my attention. \nWhat can I do to get my LARP sanctioned by White Wolf? If I’m using \na variation of MET rules, can I still play? When is it okay to charge admission \nto my LARP? \nI put these questions together because I hear them all the time, and they’re usually \nasked in packs like that. And because I’m sure you want to know, I’ll make the official \npronouncement: \nYou can charge legally for a White Wolf LARP if you are using official \nWhite Wolf rules, books and item cards, and the only things you can photocopy \nand distribute to players are the character sheets. Adhering to these guidelines \nwon’t make a game an “approved White Wolf story-line” or anything like that. \nThat’s done through the Camarilla. These standards simply allow you to charge \nmoney for your events without violating our trademarks. \nDoes this statement mean you can’t run your game “based on White Wolfs \nWorld of Darkness” with its streamlined system or its house rules (or Mage rules \nor werewombats)? Nope; that’s not what it means at all. It just means that you \ncan’t charge folks an admission fee legally. So don’t panic. We won’t slay you. \n\n\nMIND’S E Y E  T H E A T R E  J \ntsigane@wizards.com \n\n\nDan Paqe, Allm \n"
