Deep in the ducts, \nsomething made an intermittent thumping. \n“Seems like nothing works right these days,” murmured Agent \nGraham. Pressing his identity card against the sealed door, he submitted \nto the quick DNA scan - \nnone of this blood-drawing nonsense; the \ndead skin cells from his finger would suffice - \nand entered a moment \nlater when the door whisked open. \n“Any leads?” Graham barked with a stern, authoritarian voice. The \nwoman in the doctor’s coat barely turned her head; she looked tired and \nresigned. Quite unlike the Academy cadets who jumped at anything. \nProbably already used to the authority, Graham thought. \nAfter a protracted sigh, the woman placed her stylus on her \nworkbench and stood up. She unceremoniously shoved her hands into \nher coat pockets. “A few. Nothing major. A little bit of skin sampling, \nsome extrapolation, protease matching, the usual. Three people, maybe \nwith some friends that they didn’t bring.” \nGraham peered over his sunglasses quizzically. “That’s all?” he \nmurmured quietly. His body language and voice inflection carried more \nto the question, though: Curiosity about those “friends”, uncertainty \nover the techniques used, possibility of contamination. \n“I’m sure. For now,” the woman muttered. “No mistake. No \nattempts to stymie a trace or investigation. Almost as if they didn’t care \n- \nor had bigger problems to worry about.” \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

The paperwork and the reports and the \npsych evals would have him tied up for months, keeping him from \nstaying on the streets and doing good work. \nSome days, Graham hated the bureaucracy.

You're \nprobably champing at the bit for ways to expand your chronicle, or \nscratching your head over some rules that didn't quite click for you. In \nshort, that's what this book is for: Everything you wanted to know about \nlive-action Mage that couldn't fit in the first book. \nAgain, since there's no telling how you run your game and what \nworks for your troupe, many parts of this book contain optional rules \nand potential ideas. Based on the same mechanics as the rest of the \nlive-action system in Laws of Ascension, these rules provide different \nways to expand your chronicle, but you can always pick and choose \nwhat works for you. \nThis Companion clarifies a few rules and adds many new ideas. \nYou'll find that a lot of these spring directly from ideas presented by \nthe original book, or from other sourcebooks for Mage. With this \nbook, you should have just about all the guidelines you need to any of \nthe Mage cosmology fully accessible. \nSo, without further ado, here's what you'll find in this Companion: \nChapter One: Introduction is this little stuff right here. \nChapter Two: The Technocracy covers in detail that most \nfearsome of organizations - \nthe conspiratorial Technocratic Union. \nFrom Technocracy character recruitment to special Storytelling \nconsiderations to running a Technocracy-based game, it's all here. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

It's \neverything from the advantages and disadvantages of playing a strange \nmage like an Ahl-i-Batin, to how to convert the Merits and Flaws from \nyour tabletop supplement. \nChapter Four: Rotes and Wonders expands upon the sample \nrotes from the core book. This comprehensive list includes a lot more \nthings for mages to do, and some clarifications on the uses of earlier \nrotes. Also, you'll find some rotes that show a wide range of capabilities, \nfrom shaking the world to just getting along in daily life, all suitable \nfor inspiration. \nChapter Five: Rules Addenda updates and clarifies some of the \nrules from Laws of Ascension so that you can avoid headaches or \nminor mistakes. Also in here are a few additional optional rules, like \nhow to build a Paradox deck with a deck of normal cards and how to \ndeal with the headaches of crossovers with other World of Darkness \ngames. \nChapter Six: Places of Stories covers the Umbra, spirits, \nShallowings, hauntings, the Digital Web and the like all in detail. \nYou'll find ideas on how to create new and compelling places for your \nstories.

      "text": "HISTCBRY \nThe first members of the Technocracy, by some accounts, were the \nprehuman that grabbed a leg bone and bashed his opponent over the \nhead with it, the Cro-Magnon that grabbed a burning hunk of tree from \na lightning strike and used it to light his cave, and the Neanderthal that \ndomesticated the wolf and the horse. Others trace the origins of the \ngroups that would become the Technocracy to ancient Egypt, or to \nChina, or suggest that the scientist-magi of early Arabia might have \nbeen their antecedents. Stll others credit Pythagoras, Archimedes, \nHero and Daedalus of the Greeks. Any or all of these theories may be \ncorrect - \nit really depends on what interpretation of history you want \nto use. \nThe Technocracy truly began to get organized in the beginnings of \nthe second millennium. A noble named Wolfgang von Reismann \nhelped organize the Craftmasons, an organization of secret societies \ndedicated to the pursuit of knowledge, the betterment of Mankind and \n(secretly), a cure for death itself. The Craftmasons soon made contact \nwith an organization of alchemists and herbalists called the Solificati, \nwho joined them in an informal alliance. They were joined by the High \nGuild, a brotherhood of Enlightened tradesmen and merchants. As the \nloose coalition grew, they became increasingly concerned about the \nthreats presented by the supernatural world. Mages and vampires ruled \nthe civilized world, while the woods were home to all manner of fell \nbeasts and monsters. Most people spent their lives wracked with fear. \nSomething hadto be done. \nThe Order of Reason announced its presence to the world with a \nbang, at the Covenant of Mistridge. Mistridge was a large Hermetic \nChantry located in southern France that had long since fallen into \ncorruption and moral decay. The local peasants, tired of magical \ndepredations and heavy taxation brought the tower of Mistridge under \nsiege, and the Craftmasons showed up to help. Artificer artillery blasted \ndown walls of stone, while prayers, sacred geometry and alchemically \nerected barriers in the Gauntlet prevented escape. By the time the siege \nwas over, Mistridge Tower was no more, and the members of the Order \nof Hermes who had lived there were dead. In place of the tower, the \nCraftmasons raised a school and a church. \nNews of the events at Mistridge spread, and the influence of the \nCraftmasons and their allies soon followed. While their success was not \nuniversal - \nthe disastrous events in Languedoc and the Cathar heresy \nbeing perhaps the most notable error- \nit was ever-present and \nI '  \n' \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "I \ngrowing. In 1325, the Convention of the Ivory Tower at Yossamy \nformalized the alliance between the Craftmasons, the Cabal of Pure \nThought (a group of religious warriors that may be the predecessors of \nthe modemNWO), the Artificers (agroup of smiths, artisans, inventors \nand mechanics), the Celestial Masters and the Void Seekers (guilds of \nexplorers and stargazers), the Cosians (healers, herbalists and alchemists), \nand the High Guild (financiers, traders, and merchants) into a new \norganization- \nthe Order of Reason. The Solificati, one of the \nCraftmasons' first allies, were members of the Order for only a short \ntime, quickly falling away from them, and eventually leaving the \nTraditions as well. Within a century, the Order wielded influence in \nevery court in Europe and the Middle East, and its touch was felt as far \naway as China and South America. In many parts of the world, their \nadvice came to be more important than that of the mages who had acted \nas advisors for years before. At first, this rivalry was nearly friendly, a \ndisagreement between equals, but this was not to last. Eventually the \nTraditions and the Order would be locked in a secret war that has lasted \nuntil recently, when the Ascension War finally ended. \nEven in the early days, the Order was not without internal strife. The \nCraftmasons were at odds with the Cabal and the High Guild on a number \nof subjects, and in 1670 they were betrayed and destroyed, apparently to a \nman. Today, only scraps of records exist to suggest that the Craftmasons \never existed, the result of some unknown cover-up or reworking of history. \nMembers of the Technocracy can take many roles in your story, and \ndifferent members can take on different roles at different times.

That’s where Technocracy \nchronicles come in. A Technocracy chronicle is a chance for people to \ndress to the nines, pull out their scientific magazine subscriptions and \ngo hunting for freaky Things that Should Not Be. It’s a game about \nbeing the Man and part of the System, but also about being a hero. \nThe Technocracy has its flaws and problems. At heart, the machine \nof the Union plans to go on, with agendas hard-wired centuries ago and \npolicies that are obsolete and contradictory. Even the New World \nOrder can’t completely eliminate bureaucratic inefficiency - \nand \nParadox, it seems, even strikes to cripple social orders. So it is that \nTechnocracy characters could range from the cold, heartless agents \nwho cover up supernatural events and bring out the inhumanly heavy \nfirepower, to sympathetic, insightful researchers and protectors who \nwant to make the world a better place. It’s up to you to decide which \nstyle of play you prefer, or whether to have elements of both. \nIncluded in this book are all the Conventions of the Technocracy, \nas well as some of their specific abilities and tools. With these, you can \nbuild your own Technocracy characters, whether as protagonists or \nvillains. \nTKHNKRACY \n@P T m s  \nWhen you’re organizing Technocracy groups, the smallest group is \nthe op team - \na squad formed to deal with specific emergencies or \nproblems. Sometimes they’re formed “on the fly” in response to an issue. \nIn other cases, they’re long-standing groups of allied Technocrats who \ncombine skills to complete tasks, in an X-Files-like fashion. \nThe Technocracy can and does use normal people in its work. \nIndeed, many of the Union’s agents don’t even realize the nature of the \nconspiracy for which they work. Player groups, however, if they consist \nprimarily of Enlightened individuals, probably know at least passingly \nof the Union and its organization. While they have day jobs and normal \nlives, they also do special tasks for the Technocracy to accomplish \nthings that normal governments and agencies can’t or won’t deal with. \nMore importantly, while some players might enjoy playing an \nunEnlightened operative, for most games you’ll want to forge entire \ngroups of Enlightened agents. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

      "text": "A Technocratic op team is roughly equivalent to a Tradition cabal: \nA group of mages that all work together for common goals. Op teams in \nturn report to higher-level facilities, such as Technocratic Constructs \n(bases). In many cases, higher-level administrators in the Union hand \ndown specific goals and instructions. Some op teams, though, have wide \nleeway to investigate and resolve cases of Deviants on their own. As a \nStoryteller, you can be as controlling or as free-handed as you wish with \nyour players, either keeping them in rigid lockstep or assuming that their \nsuperiors don’t have the time or inclination to watch over them heavily. \nUltimately, the Technocracy operates under the auspices ofcontrol. \nThis shadowy group of anonymous figures generally sends its missives \nand directives - \nincluding updates to the Time Table, the plan for \nworld innovation and influence - \ndown through the many layers of \nEnlightened bureaucracy. In dire cases, someone from Control may \nbecome more directly involved, but in modern eras this is not only very \nrare but very difficult. Representatives of Control use anonymity as a \nshield and source of power; they distance themselves from problem \nsituations, so as to avoid repercussions. As many agents of Control are \nliterally hundreds of years old, thanks to biological and bionic \nengineering, and they reside in Constructs on the other side of the \nDimensional Barrier (the Gauntlet), they don’t make trips to Earth \nfrivolously.

Certain herbs and practices \nreversed symptoms and even brought wellness where before only slow \ndeath lay. From these beginnings sprang the Cosians, researchers into \nthe process of life and all of its permutations. At first simple physicians, \nthe Cosians quickly took to the study of all biological phenomena. As \nthe Enlightened communities developed germ theory, cell theory, \nunderstanding of herbalism and pharmacology, and the repeatable \nbenefits of trauma care, the science of medicine came to fruition. At \nlength, these researchers reached for the ultimate question: Where does \nlife come from? How does it persist? In seeking the answers, they became \nthe Progenitors, the scientists and doctors who sustain - \nand create - \nlife. \nAs one would expect of a medically oriented Convention, the \nProgenitors count doctors, research physicians, pharmacologists and \npsychiatrists among their numbers. Less common but no less important \nare paleontologists, xenobiologists, botanists and other researchers \nwho contribute to the understanding of extinct creatures, \nextradimensional entities and the plants and animals that surround the \nhuman world. Through their studies, the Progenitors insure health and \nlong life; their regular treatments can cure grievous injuries, and even \nfield medicines greatly improve the survival chances of young \nTechnocratic operatives. High-ranking Technocrats undergo special \nprocedures to extend their lifespans, effectively renewing their flesh \nand returning youth to the mind. Even the Masses benefit; Progenitors \nworking in research hospitals turn their talents to saving all lives, and \ntheir work often slowly filters into the medical community. Perhaps \nmore frighteningly, the Convention experiments with the alteration \nand synthetic augmentation of living beings, and can and does create \nmutated animals, retroviruses that can re-engineer a human’s protein \nprocesses to change the body’s chemistry, or even clones sprung from a \nsingle sample of an individual.

Such thoughts do not \ncomfort the agents who rely on Progenitor techniques for their continued \nhealth and youth. \nProgenitor ranks follow the same academic mindset that rules the \nrest of the Convention. While it's possible for someone without a \nprofessorial appointment or formal advanced degree to hold authority, \nit's rare; such highly Enlightened individuals usually learn to work \nwithin the system, at least for appearance's sake. At the low end, Street \nOps, Recruiters and Technicians handle the day-to-day maintenance of \nthe Convention, doing everything from working at public clinics to \nmaintaining hospital machinery or serving as interns. Enlightened \noperatives who show promise generally become Students under an \nexperienced Progenitor; these students participate in fieldwork and \nhone a research thesis, just like any other graduate student at a \nuniversity. The difference lies in the nature of the field work, which can \ninclude research on alien or Deviant creatures and high-security secret \nmedical technology. A surviving Student whose thesis passes muster \ngoes on to become a Research Assistant, usually posted to a specific \nConstruct for continued training, but given greater discretion to pursue \npersonal projects.

From crude barter to the innovation of coins, then \npaper money, and finally modem credit and debit, the traders and \nfinanciers have been the grease that lubricated human progress. Medieval \nguildsmen protecting their livelihood formed trade consortiums to \nguarantee their product quality and training; later, these High Guilds \nbecame powerhouses of the Renaissance, issuing letters of credit that \ncould be cashed in faraway cities. Hard currency gave way to portable \npaper with no intrinsic value; only the value that people perceived in \nan otherwise worthless scrap propped up emerging economies. Finally, \npeople accepted even invisible currency: the idea of notes or cards that \nsymbolized not only a fixed amount but a potential to earn or a chance \nto spend. The transaction of humanity culminates in the Syndicate, \nwhich places a value on everything and pushes humanity to a society \nwhere every trade registers in ephemeral energy that tracks everyone’s \nwants and needs. \nUp front, the Syndicate sounds like a cartel - \ncriminals and money \nmen, shady dealers and con artists. The true Syndicate agent realizes, \nthough, that only the desperate trade with criminals; to become a true \nconnoisseur of money, one must earn trust. That makes the high-profile \nSyndicateers bond traders, international bankers and investors, but also \nmarketing reps, empowerment speakers, even social commentators. \nOther Conventions make things, but it’s the Syndicate that provides \nthe luxury of doing so: Without the patronage of the purse-strings, \nthere’s no funding for expensive toys. The Syndicate knows who’s \nbuying what, be it mundane or Enlightened, and they hold the \ndisbursements for many of the Union’s most important projects. While \nsome operatives might complain that this unfairly burdens their research \nwith Syndicate agendas, the Syndicate itself wisely points out that \nmoney doesn’t come from nowhere, even with Enlightened Science. \nThe Syndicate’s top representatives can smooth out even the most \nruffled feathers, and in conjunction with the rest of the Union, \ninfluence the market pricing and introduction of new technology - \nas \nwell as buying off politicians and leveraging out entire corporations or \ncountries. \nCorporate mentality dominates the Syndicate.

If \nyou violate this Geas, you could suffer the loss of life, magic, perhaps \neven your soul. The Gem might be due to a curse, a particularly bad \nParadox backlash, a special quest laid upon you or a hereditary condition. \nYou must attach your Geas to a specific Merit, Flaw or Background. \nThe Gem represents a point-break, because it limits the final utility of \nthat Trait. For instance, you could have the Gem of “If I ever entrap the \nsouls of the dead with magic, I will lose their favor forever,” linked to \nyour Merit: Sphere Affinity: Spirit. Trapping the souls of the dead is a \npretty easily avoided, unlikely circumstance - \na four-Trait Geas, \nsubtracted from the five-Trait value of the Merit, which yields a final \nresult of one Trait. The Gem is thus a one-Trait Flaw. Conversely, if you \nstuck a very heavy prohibition on it (“If I ever see the full moon, I will \nlose my affinity for spirits”), that would be worth more: a five-Trait \nMerit, minus a one-Trait Gem, means that the final value of the Gea \nis a four-Trait Flaw. Or, say that you decided that if you ever eat red \nmeat, you will sicken and die (gain the Flaw: Degeneration, six-Trait \nlevel). The condition is pretty unlikely (four Traits); take the four-Trait \nGem from the six-Trait Flaw and you have two Traits - \nthe final value \nof the Flaw with Gem, since it’s unlikely to happen and thus not worth \nas many points. This means that a Geas on a relatively trivial boon is \nnot worth much, but a Gem on a hefty power can heavily cut the cost \nof apower if the conditions are strict enough. Note that if the Gem Trait \nvalue exceeds the other Trait’s value, you can still take the Geas but \nyou’d get no Traits for it. For instance, you decide that if you ever bind \nthe dead, you will lose your Medium Merit. The circumstance is a four- \nTrait Gem, pretty unlikely to happen, but the Merit itself is only two \nTraits; that would be a negative two Trait total, which would make the \nGem a two-Trait Merit (you’d have to spend Traits for it!). Instead it’s \njust not worth any Traits - \nthe only way that you can cut the cost of \nan already-cheap Merit or Flaw is to take a very, very strong Geas with \nit. \nA Gem cannot reduce a Merit, Flaw or Background cost to zero \nTraits. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

From their shelter, the Templars shepherded \nChristendom while remaining out of sight.

In 1837, the Order of Reason came to the conclusion that \nreligion and faith were superstitious tripe to be expunged from Consensual \nreality, and any who strengthened religion needed to be removed. The \nOrder attacked the Templars and killed many of them, but those who \nretreated and survived went even deeper underground. \nThe Templars exist today as a secret magical order that follows four \nmajor tenets, known as the Edicts of the Just - \n1) Strive to create anew \nChristendom that is not created in the image of the Order of Reason; \n2) Defend the innocent from the horrors of the supernatural and \ninfernal; 3) Defeat the Order of Reason and gain justice for their \nbetrayal and their promulgation of irreligion; and 4) Preserve the Order \nitself, with secrecy being the paramount directive.

The Shamans commonly go through many steps in the \ncreation of a single Effect, and even after the Effect has been done, they \nmake sure that the gods are sufficiently appeased. These practices \nbecome part of their daily lives; for example, they pray over a meal to \nthree different gods in thanks for the meal itself, the fire that cooked it, \nand the spirits of the animals and plants that gave of themselves for it. \nA peasant Shaman is likely to be considered a superstitious person who \ndoes odd things at odd times in appeasement for different spirits and \ngods. Usually they are small acts of supplication and thanks, but they \nbecome far more elaborate rituals to court the spirits' affections and \nattention in the workings of something major. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

No \nfurther Reputation is earned for levels beyond this. \nWhen an archmage performs an Effect that uses one of his \nArchmaster Spheres, he automatically gains an additional number of \ngrades of success equal to his levels exceeding Master. Thus, using \nArchmaster (Superior) Forces grants one extra grade of success on any \nForces Effect.

For this reason you may want to limit \nhow you allow mages to use shapechanging Effects. Listed below are \nsome examples of ways to deal with shapechanging rotes and a few \nexamples of such rotes that may show up in your game. \nAppearance Changes \nThese changes are done to conceal a character’s appearance either \nfor stealth or subterfuge. When a mage is concealing her features in this \nway, the player should either hold her chin with her hand, or hold her \nhand in front of her face, to represent that she does not look the way that \nother characters would recognize her. If necessary the player should \nannounce to people out of character what she looks like when she does \nthat. Listed below are three variations on disguising effects. \nHello, my name is...: Adept Mind. This rote, created by a rather \nresourceful Hollow One, has been adopted by other Traditions in \ndiffering forms. The Hollower would take a “Hello, my name is ...” \nsticker and write on it the name of what she wanted to look like. Doing \nthis took advantage of the fact that most people took things they saw \nfor granted. Whatever she wrote on the tag and stuck on herself was \nwhat people saw - \nshe drew a small badge, and people saw a cop; she \nwrote “Bob Dole” and looked like an impotent presidential candidate. \nThe Effect does not allow the mage to look inhuman or inanimate. Any \nperson who is interacting with the mage under this Effect, and has some \nform of heightened sensory perception, may make a Mental Challenge \nagainst three times the mage’s Arete Traits to notice there is something \nwrong with what he is seeing.

Sometimes, though, the field does not show the proper interaction \nwith exterior stimuli - \nfor instance, the image’s hair might stay perfect \nin a stiff breeze. Any person who is interacting with the mage under this \nEffect may make a Mental Challenge against the caster to notice that \nthere is something wrong with what she is seeing.

Grades of Success: Increase the grade of \nduration. \nButcher’s Disguise: Disciple Life. Some of the more pain-oriented \nCultists use this rote to help disguise themselves or to change their faces \ndramatically. The mage uses a razor blade to cut his face and molds it \ninto the appearance that he wants to have. The new face lasts for one \nminute/conflict.

When the duration \nends, the mage heals the damage and his face returns to its original \nshape. The mage has two choices when doing this Effect: he may make \nhimself look like a different person, or he may increase his Social Traits \ntemporarily. If the mage makes himself look like a different person, \nthere is no real way for anybody to see what is really underneath since \nthe mage is changed physically. A character who knows the person \nbeing imitiated might use an Investigation Social Challenge to realize \nthat the mage isn’t who he appears to be.

Body armor enhanced by Technocratic \nmaterial science is an Artifact, because it relies on physically enhanced \nproperties outside the bounds of normal science. An Artifact costs one \nTrait per level of the Sphere magic involved. Thus, if an item has a \nDisciple-level Effect, it is a three-Trait Wonder. An Artifact’s Effect \ntypically has only the base success for the rote or Sphere in question. At \nthe Storyteller’s discretion, an Artifact might have extra grades of \nsuccess built in for extra Traits (typically on a one-for-one basis). \nCham - \nA Charm is a small, single-use, disposable item, such as \na magic potion or candle. Once it’s used, its effect takes place, but the \nitem is gone. A Charm generally works just like an Artifact. It costs one \nless Trait, however, and counts as a set of 10. Therefore, a set of 10 \nCharms that invoke a Disciple-level Sphere would cost two Traits. All \nCharms in a set have the same power. \nFetish- Spirits bound into material objects can grant their powers \nas a type of Wonder. Generally, equate the spirit’s power to a rote of the \nsame type; the cost equals a number of Traits equal to the Sphere levels \ninvolved. Since spirit powers aren’t Paradoxical and just about anyone \ncan use them, Fetishes have great advantages.

A Periapt typically \n~ \nE \n: \ncomes charged, but the mage must see to recharging it with Prime after \nusing its power.

Rather, they tend to be the focus of story \narcs, often with careful caveats as to why they can’t solve all problems \n-narrow \nset of highly efficient powers, severe drawbacks, have owners \nlooking for them, etc. Each and every Wonder should have some story \nbehind it and some purpose in the game. \nSpeaking of drawbacks, a Wonder’s powers can have limits or \nproblems. Such drawbacks mitigate the cost of the Wonder. Typically, \napply a Flaw as a limit or hindrance, and lower the Wonder’s cost by that \nnumber of Traits. For instance, a Wonder that causes its holder to suffer \na minor Vulnerability (as the two-Trait version of that Flaw) would \nknock two Traits from its cost, potentially allowing more powers along \nwith the problems. A Wonder might have conditional magic - \nit might \nnot work during the day, or on women, or in other strange circumstances. \nJust remember, when players purchase Wonders on starting characters, \nany disadvantage clearly mitigated by the character’s innate capabilities \n(such as the aforementioned Vulnerability granting Wonder held by a \ncharacter with a specific Invulnerability) gains no bonus points for those \nnon-drawbacks. \nUltimately, the Storyteller should shift the values of Wonders as \nnecessary to comfortably integrate them into the game. Some games \nwill want to make Wonders very rare and thus will raise their Trait value. \nOthers will encourage the use of minor Wonders and thus make them \nvery cheap. \nFuel Pellets \nOne-Trait Charm \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

At this point it looks like a short column of roiling flames. \nDuring the third turn, the caster must hold the Effect in place long \nenough for him to get away from the blast area. The first parts of the spell \nare easy compared to the timing element, and this is the part that tends \nto break down (and this is when the actual casting test is made). The \nEffect requires three turns togather the necessaryenergy. Ondetonating, \nit inflicts four aggravated wounds to everything with half a mile of the \npentagram. If the casting test fails, the effect goes off immediately, but \nthe blast radius is only about 100 yards. In conjunction with \nCorrespondence, the mage can selectively target areas, using grades of \nsuccess to eliminate certain people or objects from the blast. This spell \nis, in many ways, the mage's version of a bomb, and Storytellers should \ntreat it as such. It's not a cheap way to destabilize a game, but a powerful \nand dangerous tool for a story that demands a tremendous overhaul. \nGrades of Success: Increases the damage by one aggravated wound per \ngrade. \nBattery Man: Adept Life, Initiate Forces.

A Virtual Adept who was a bit of Frank \nHerbert freak created this rote so that he could stay awake longer.

A Hollow One rote to make the caster more \nsocially accepted wherever she is.

The Akashic Brother- \nhood has used this rote to make entire groups of thugs obliterate each \nother without the mage striking asingle one. Through the use of Do, the \nBrother bends space around himself to cause attacks that would have hit \nhim to strike other attackers.

After the Effect is finished, it takes one hour \nfor the storm to gather - \nover that hour, the clouds become more and \nmore threatening, the wind picks up, and rain starts to fall. After the \nstorm has formed, the violent center lasts for an hour over the area \nwhere the Effect was done. Everything within a mile of the center of the \nstorm is buffeted by high winds, hail and rain. Any character who is \nunprotected in this weather must win a Static Physical Challenge \nagainst eight Traits every 10 minutes or take one level of bashing \ndamage from flying debris and hail. The caster is unaffected by his own \nstorm. For the duration of the storm, the caster may focus the storm \nagainst a single target. He may only do this once and must win a magical \nattack test against the target. If the mage succeeds, he may hit the target \nwith a wind attack that inflicts two bashing levels and knocks her down, \nor with a lightning strike that inflicts two aggravated levels of damage. \nGrades of Success: One grade of success for one extra attack by the storm \nper grade; these grades cannot be done in the same turn. \nChange the Flow of the Masses: Adept Entropy, Initiate Corre- \nspondence, Apprentice Time. Crowds of moving people actually emulate \nthe flow of viscous fluids, simulating compression waves, tremors and \nflows. Because of this, the movement of the people is predictable and \ncan be altered in minute ways. This rote does just that: it allows the \nprediction and control of large groups of people to either increase or \ndecrease a person’s movement through the crowd. It can be used in \ntraffic jams to always be in the lane that is moving. It can be used on a \nbank teller line, so that the line you choose moves fastest. It can be used \nto remain untrampled while people are panicked and running for the \nemergency exits. \nBut just as it can be used to speed movement though crowds, it can \nalso be used slow movement through the same crowded sidewalk, rush- \nhour traffic jam or bank teller line. The mage selects if he will speed or \nslow movement when he casts.

Usually this requires both \nthe Chorister and the tainted subject to undergo a strenuous and painful \nordeal. In the process, the Chorister takes on some of the taint from the \nsubject and cleanses it from himself, making the suffering less upon the \nsubject so that she does not kill herself in the process.

For example, you cannot ban the victim from breathing, \neating or pissing; but you could ban them from killing, stealing or even \nusing foul language.

Other actions may be performed, but \nattempting to summon another swarm of animals causes both swarms \nto dissipate and go back to what they were interrupted. The swarm has \nseven Physical Traits and four Healthy health levels; it inflicts lethal \ndamage when it hits and may only attack one target at a time.

This rote, taught to \nyoung students of this Sphere among the Dreamspeakers, gives the \nmage a vision of where a subject belongs in the Great Dance.

The mage can \ncontort and stretch his body in unbelievable ways. He may contract \nparts of his body as small as three inches or stretch an appendage up to \na length of six feet (including his torso).

By \npreparing a body for a spirit, a Hermetic may force a summoned spirit \ninto a physical form. Some spirits will be more than happy about this, \nwhile others may become quite violent. While the spirit is in the \nphysical form, the mage holds no control over it except the threat of \nphysical harm. Older and more powerful spirits are not likely to feel \nthreatened by physical harm, as they know that the destruction of the \nform will not destroy them.

A Static Medicine Mental Challenge against three times the \nmage's Arete Traits is required to find a cure for the disease; magical \nEffects may also be used to find a cure.

The Cult of \nEcstasy is always looking for new experiences and new sensations. A lot \nof times they simply stare off into space and remember an experience \nfrom the past. This rote allows a Cultist to initiate a full recall of an \nexperience by doing something that emulates a sensation from the \nmoment in time she wishes to recall.

He \nneeds no tools to craft the object, though an appropriate Crafts Ability \nmay be necessary. The rote draws ephemera from the Umbra and \nsolidifies it into a material object.

No Effect may kill a character who isn’t already at the \nMortally Wounded health level (or equivalent, for non-humans). \nThus, if you hit a perfectly healthy (or even Bruised, Wounded or \nIncapacitated) character with an Effect that somehow inflicts 10 levels \nof damage, all this does is bring the character to the Mortally Wounded \nhealth level.

As the werewolves and other \nchangers see it, mages perform feats that are fundamentally wrong; they \ninvoke powers they shouldn’t have, which is why Gaia punishes them \n(with Paradox). Worse still, mages and werewolves sometimes clash \nover places of natural power - \nthe Garou caerns, which also sometimes \nserve as mage Nodes. These fights are no-holds-barred, as the Garou \nbattle to protect their sacred areas. \nRemember the following when dealing with mage-shapeshifter \ninteraction: \nEven moreso than with vampires, mages are flimsy compared to \nshapeshifters. As normal humans, mages will tend to die in two turns (or \nless! ) against even a single moderately experienced shifter. \nMages don’t have the ability to artificially change a Pattern from \na human into a werewolf, or vice versa. You can’t just reshape someone’s \nLife/ Spirit Pattern into a werewolf. Attempting to do so tends to draw \ndown the wrath of Gaia and the related spirits. \nSpeaking of spirits, mages don’t have any sort of Pact the way that \nGarou do. While spirits are inclined to at least talk to Garou and deal \nwith them reasonably fairly, they have no compunctions about just \nkilling or cheating mages out of hand. A mage cannot assume that just \nbecause he’s a Garou ally he will gain any special favors from the Garou \nspirits. Hand-in-hand with this, mages can’t necessarily guarantee that \na given child will be a full-fledged Garou, although mages could barter \nwith spirits for intercession in this matter and a Master of Spirit could \nprobably compel a powerful spirit to “fudge things” (with severe \nconsequences down the road for such arrogance, of course). \nMages are immune to the Delirium, but this doesn’t mean that a \nmage is stupidly oblivious in the face of a nine-foot-tall furry killing \nmachine. Most sensible mages - \nespecially those who know nothing \nabout shapeshifters - \nwill run like madmen without needing the \nDelirium as incentive. \nSpecific rules might go as follows: \nFor powers that work with supernatural concealment, treat this \nmuch like the interaction of mages with vampiric Obfuscate or Auspex. \nThus, a mage uses Mind to penetrate Blissful Ignorance. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

A mage can use Time to try to \ncancel any of these powers, but requires a test against the Garou. For \ninstance, canceling Spirit ofthe Fray requires the mage to make an Arete \nchallenge for a Time Effect, then make a challenge against the Garou \n(Mental versus Physical in this case). If the mage wins, the Spirit of the \nFray is retroactively removed in a sort of “time crunch,” even though \nthe Garou normally would’ve gone first. Otherwise, it’s a fine red mist \nof mage. \nNo Garou will allow mages into a caern. Period. Even Kinfolk. \nThis is “allowing a caern to be violated,” since mages are known caern- \nraiders. No amount of fast-talking will cover this. Spirits (who help \ntrack Garou Renown) will take note of this and punish Garou who \nviolate this rule, if the other Garou don’t get to them first. \nMages can’t perform shapeshifter rites. A mage can simulate a \nGarou rite with Spirit magic, but unless compelled or bartered with, \nspirits won’t respond to the rites as they would to a shapeshifter. \nWRAITHS \nFew mages want anything to do with the Shadowlands. The realms \nof the Dead are not a place for mortals to walk. Nonetheless, ghosts do \nhaunt the living, and sometimes mages are the intermediaries for them. \nDealing with wraiths is somewhat troublesome; dealing with the \nUnderworld itself is exceedingly dangerous. Keep the following caveats \nin mind: \nA mage uses Spirit magic on wraiths, as with other spirits; most \ncompulsions require a Social Challenge. A wraith can spend a Pathos \nTrait for one retest on a Spirit-backed binding or compulsion. \nA mage must combine Spirit with Mind for any Effect that would \ntry to penetrate wraith concealment or trickery on the other side of the \nShroud - \nfor instance, to look into the Shadowlands and see a wraith \nhidden with Argos. If the wraith manifests across the Shroud, on the \nother hand, Spirit isn’t necessary except to smack the wraith directly. \nThus, if a wraith tries to Skinride a mage, the mage can defend with Mind \nalone, but could only counterattack by adding Spirit. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n"

Mages with a lot of study of wraiths might be able to tell the \ndifference between the two states with Mind and Spirit magic. \nMagic working in the Underworld itself is very, very dangerous. \nCrossing into the Underworld (without a Shallowing or like) \ndoes cross the Avatar Storm. \nOnce in the Underworld, the mage is at grave risk. A failed \nattempt to return, or being “killed” in the Underworld, means that the \nmage dies and becomes a wraith there. \nAny Effect done in the Underworld automatically has extra \nEntropic Resonance. \nThe necrotic effects of the Underworld leach away magical wards \nand creations, causing their durations to unravel with one less grade of \nduration.

Changelings, on the other \nhand, may find some mages too banal to deal with. \nAs some rules of thumb, assume the following: \nTechnocrats average Banality 9 or 10, because they’re typically \nConditioned, procedurally oriented and not given to a whole lot of \nfanciful imagination.

There's also no easy way to dress up the park or \nseparate it into rooms. Without multiple rooms, there's a tendency for \nthe players to stick together in large clumps, which makes running \nstorylines much more difficult. It's easier to run a plot with a small group \nto manage instead of trying to cover things for dozens of people at once. \nYour best bet with a park is to have multiple Narrators on hand to \nsplit up the players into groups.

Perhaps you don’t have enough money to \ncompletely redecorate your house, or maybe you don’t have the time or \ninclination to put up huge Styrofoam plinths and flashing techno- \ngadgetry. That’s fine - \nalthough, of course, the more you immerse your \nplayers in the game, the more they’ll probably enjoy it. \nThe immersion factor of your site can’t be overestimated. The more \nyour site pushes players into the spirit of things, the more they’re likely \nto remain in character. It’s much, much easier to keep a sense of \ncharacter when the world actually feels and looks like the world the \ncharacter’s supposed to be in. A site that doesn’t fire the imagination \nrisks players feeling out of place or bored, which leads to out-of-play \nchatter. \nObviously, if you’re using a public site, you have strict limitations \non what you can and can’t do. Private sites fare a little better, especially \nif you have a few hours of prep time. \nm @ @ D  mUSIC \nSome venues like to use music to help set the feel of a specific \nlocation. This is good so long as it’s not overdone. One of the biggest \nproblems of the nightclub-format venue is that players often can’t even \nhear one another over the music. Music shouldn’t be intrusive; it should \nbe an audio cue that helps to set mood. \nYou’ll probably want to avoid music with lyrics. Stick with pure \ninstrumentals, otherwise conversations wind up fighting over the words \nof the music.

If some of it drops off and isn't quite audible, that's all right. \nThe music is an accompaniment; it's not supposed to intrude. \nLIGHTING \nMost of the time, your site will have strong overhead white lighting \nor sunlight. This is fine for a typical game, but specific settings might \ncall for something different. \nA good way to generate a more \"spooky\" atmosphere (such as an old \nChantry) is to diffuse your light. Remove the bulbs from overhead \nlighting, and instead rely on lamps scattered about the room in various \ncomers. If a room has white walls, try draping fabrics; this cuts down on \nthe reflection and makes the light softer. Such diffusion gives more \nshadows, more areas of overlap and less of a sunlit atmosphere. It's a bit \nmore cloistered and claustrophobic. \nColored lighting's a neat trick, but be careful not to rely on it \nexclusively. For one thing, it's annoying when it makes reading difficult \nor a costume impossible to see. Blue or violet lights can make for a soft, \nnightlike atmosphere, but they also render dark print hard to read, \nwhich can hurt the ability to use character sheets, books and references. \nDark red lights work a little better, and they create a more menacing \ntone. Yellow lighting seems more naturalistic and works well for scenes \nin the Middle Umbra. Green lights offer some of the same problems as \nblue, but also tend to project an oceanlike or unwholesome pallor, and \nmake people look unhealthy; they're perfect for blighted places or nasty \nparts of the Umbra. \nSpecific lighting, instead of just general room lighting, can also \nmake a difference. Perhaps your high muckety-muck Hermetic mage \nhas a small lamp stand next to his chair where he keeps a dim red lamp. \nThis will cause the mage to seem sinister and out-of-place with respect \nto the rest of the room.

Scents cause memories of similar situations to come to the fore, \nand thus can create a vivid sense of connection between a game scene \nand real events. \nUsually your site will have a neutral scent: Lived-in, visited, not \nparticularly scented. Clever use of aromas and incense can change this. \nIf you want to get across the idea of a Technocratic area, try \ncleaning tile floors just beforehand and spraying disinfectant about. \nThese sharp smells will remind people of sterile, universitylike \nenvironments. For a hospitallike feel, put some rubbing alcohol near \nthe doors and air vents; anywhere that there's air motion will cause the \nalcohol to evaporate, bringing its smell to the players who pass by. \nTradition areas tend to have other strong scents.

The scents from those can overwhelm \nyour players and cause the game to suddenly become a little too strong \nfor comfort. Instead, try safer smells that bring up Tradition images. \nIncense is, of course, the first one to spring to mind, but it's not the only \npossibility.

A lodge or living room can benefit from the use of a \nfireplace, which generates a musty, wooden smell; this has connotations \nof comfort and home.

While not everyone’s a good \ncook, a few people will probably rise to the challenge, and you can \nalways let someone bring a salad or simple dish from the supermarket’s \ndeli counter.

The \nUmbra is not a safe haven, nor is it a place to effectively do battle for \nwars on Earth, nor is it an easy trip. Nevertheless, it’s a useful stopping \nground for mages willing to brave its dangers. Like most magical \nendeavors, the mage risks much for the opportunity to gain much. \nYour key point should be this: Mages don’t just jump into the \nUmbra for a quick jaunt. Umbral travel is an important, powerful \njourney, requiring preparation and forethought. While a fast vulgar \neffect might suffice to slip through in some occasions, most Umbral \ntravel relies on ceremony.

Thus, the Storm causes damage \nwhen the mage passes the Gauntlet, and it distorts magical Effects that \npenetrate the Gauntlet. \nA mage who simply projects his mind through other realms (with \nMaster-level Mind) never actually takes his spirit or body through the \nGauntlet, so he’s safe from the Storm. \nStepping into or out of the Umbra triggers the Storm’s effect once, \nas the mage crosses the Gauntlet. Once inside, the mage has crossed the \nStorm and is safe (at least, as safe as someone can be, in the Umbra). \nEffects cast from the Umbra to Earth or vice versa generally don’t \nhurt the caster, but they do damage the Effect.

Unfortunately, \nmages tend to fight hotly over Shallowings as a result of this, and they're \ndangerous places because you never know what will come through. \nReaching across the Gauntlet to thwack a spirit or pick something \nup does cause Storm damage.

Because the mage exists in a more detailed \ndimension of webspace, it’s possible for the mage to also do tricks that \nseem impossible to Sleepers, like easily rearranging websites, booting \nSleepers from the ‘net, even providing streams of real-time information \nfrom sound and video that seem implausible to Sleepers. \nWithin the Web, everything’s a construct of Forces - \nenergy given \na virtual form. Thus, mages must use Forces to control, create or destroy \n“objects” in the Web. A mage who enters holistically can bring items \nwith him but must use Matter and Forces to give themvirtualequivalents. \nConversely, a master of Forces can create items at a whim. \nOf course, the Digital Web isn’t all fun and computer games.

Also, you'll find some rotes that show a wide range of capabilities, \nfrom shaking the world to just getting along in daily life, all suitable \nfor inspiration. \nChapter Five: Rules Addenda updates and clarifies some of the \nrules from Laws of Ascension so that you can avoid headaches or \nminor mistakes. Also in here are a few additional optional rules, like \nhow to build a Paradox deck with a deck of normal cards and how to \ndeal with the headaches of crossovers with other World of Darkness \ngames. \nChapter Six: Places of Stories covers the Umbra, spirits, \nShallowings, hauntings, the Digital Web and the like all in detail. \nYou'll find ideas on how to create new and compelling places for your \nstories. You'll also learn the rules governing those strange locations \nand how mages interact with them. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nL \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nEvery Tradition mage fears them. Every shadowy conspiracy is \nattributed to them. Every historical impetus to stamp out the mystical \nworld in favor of reason is a victory at their feet. They are the \nTechnocracy. \nThe Technocracy, or Technocratic Union, is often considered the \ngreatest antagonist for any Tradition Mage game - \nor the greatest set \nof heroes and protagonists for a game centered around the Union. \nTo understand the Technocracy and use it in your games, you'll \nneed to know a bit about where they come from. With the helpful \nindoctrination/education \nguide here, you'll have no problem getting in \nstep with the Pogrom. You might even find yourself Conditioned to \nplay a Technocracy-based game instead of a Tradition-oriented one! \nMost Tradition mages see the Technocracy as a faceless megalith \nbent on domination not only of the Earth but all of Reality. They claim \nthat the agents of the Technocracy are at best willing dupes, and most \nare actively evil. They see the philosophy of the Technocracy as \nabhorrent. \nAnd the Technocracy doesn't mind one bit. Let their enemies \nunderestimate them, they say. Technocracy members know better; \nthey are the last, desperate bastion of hope against madness and chaos. \nTHE TECHNKRACY \nITSELF \nThey just might be right. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ndoing is imposing their views on th \nand beauty. They want a sterile, clockwork universe where \neverything is totally regimented and precisely controlled. They \nwant all magic gone from the world - \nno sense of wonder, no \njoy of discovery, just endless tedium and toil, forever. \nThat's what the Tradition mages will tell you. \nThe Technos no more see themselves as mustache-twirling \nvillains bent on world subjugation than the Traditions see \nthemselves as bomb-throwing anarchists bent on unmaking the \nlaws of reality just so they can regain power. Members of the \nnventions of the Technocracy see themselves as many things \nemployees of an advanced group of companies devoted to \npromoting scientific understanding of the universe, agents in a \nsecret war against paranormaluerrorists, defenders of humanity, \nor promoters of civilization and rational thinking.

Others trace the origins of the \ngroups that would become the Technocracy to ancient Egypt, or to \nChina, or suggest that the scientist-magi of early Arabia might have \nbeen their antecedents. Stll others credit Pythagoras, Archimedes, \nHero and Daedalus of the Greeks. Any or all of these theories may be \ncorrect - \nit really depends on what interpretation of history you want \nto use. \nThe Technocracy truly began to get organized in the beginnings of \nthe second millennium. A noble named Wolfgang von Reismann \nhelped organize the Craftmasons, an organization of secret societies \ndedicated to the pursuit of knowledge, the betterment of Mankind and \n(secretly), a cure for death itself. The Craftmasons soon made contact \nwith an organization of alchemists and herbalists called the Solificati, \nwho joined them in an informal alliance. They were joined by the High \nGuild, a brotherhood of Enlightened tradesmen and merchants. As the \nloose coalition grew, they became increasingly concerned about the \nthreats presented by the supernatural world. Mages and vampires ruled \nthe civilized world, while the woods were home to all manner of fell \nbeasts and monsters. Most people spent their lives wracked with fear. \nSomething hadto be done. \nThe Order of Reason announced its presence to the world with a \nbang, at the Covenant of Mistridge. Mistridge was a large Hermetic \nChantry located in southern France that had long since fallen into \ncorruption and moral decay. The local peasants, tired of magical \ndepredations and heavy taxation brought the tower of Mistridge under \nsiege, and the Craftmasons showed up to help. Artificer artillery blasted \ndown walls of stone, while prayers, sacred geometry and alchemically \nerected barriers in the Gauntlet prevented escape. By the time the siege \nwas over, Mistridge Tower was no more, and the members of the Order \nof Hermes who had lived there were dead. In place of the tower, the \nCraftmasons raised a school and a church. \nNews of the events at Mistridge spread, and the influence of the \nCraftmasons and their allies soon followed. While their success was not \nuniversal - \nthe disastrous events in Languedoc and the Cathar heresy \nbeing perhaps the most notable error- \nit was ever-present and \nI '  \n' \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nI \ngrowing. In 1325, the Convention of the Ivory Tower at Yossamy \nformalized the alliance between the Craftmasons, the Cabal of Pure \nThought (a group of religious warriors that may be the predecessors of \nthe modemNWO), the Artificers (agroup of smiths, artisans, inventors \nand mechanics), the Celestial Masters and the Void Seekers (guilds of \nexplorers and stargazers), the Cosians (healers, herbalists and alchemists), \nand the High Guild (financiers, traders, and merchants) into a new \norganization- \nthe Order of Reason. The Solificati, one of the \nCraftmasons' first allies, were members of the Order for only a short \ntime, quickly falling away from them, and eventually leaving the \nTraditions as well. Within a century, the Order wielded influence in \nevery court in Europe and the Middle East, and its touch was felt as far \naway as China and South America. In many parts of the world, their \nadvice came to be more important than that of the mages who had acted \nas advisors for years before. At first, this rivalry was nearly friendly, a \ndisagreement between equals, but this was not to last. Eventually the \nTraditions and the Order would be locked in a secret war that has lasted \nuntil recently, when the Ascension War finally ended. \nEven in the early days, the Order was not without internal strife. The \nCraftmasons were at odds with the Cabal and the High Guild on a number \nof subjects, and in 1670 they were betrayed and destroyed, apparently to a \nman. Today, only scraps of records exist to suggest that the Craftmasons \never existed, the result of some unknown cover-up or reworking of history. \nMembers of the Technocracy can take many roles in your story, and \ndifferent members can take on different roles at different times.

The Technocracy doesn't need to \nbe played in any one particular style, but a trend or theme in their \nbehavior can lend a sense of how the game is to be played. Some \nexamples include: \nShadowy Nemesis \nIn this version, the Technocracy works from the shadows, using its \ninfluence and information to hamper your players' characters, but rarely \ntaking an active role against them. The players may not even be aware that \nthe Technocracy is actually out to get them, or may suspect, but not be able \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe Technos are a bunch of fascist bastards.

Charactersmay find theirResources diminishedasthesyndicate \nworks against them, the local police (at the behest of an FBI agent who \nunknowingly works for a cutout that works for the NWO) might start \nhassling them, their Chantry might be threatened by Eminent Domain and \npossibly seized. At every turn, anything that can go wrong involving local \ngovernment, politics, criminals or society will go wrong. This kind of \nTechnocracy can be amazingly effective.. . and insanely frustrating. Make \nsure you give your players some chances to finally make the connections, \ntrack down the leads and put paid to some of their tormentors, or they are \ngoing to hate not just the Technocracy, but you. \nRemember, the Technocracy uses science as a tool, but \nscience itself is not the only end. While there are in fact many \nscientists in the Union who perform experiments, try to fit \nobserved data into theories and look for ways to make the \nuniverse \"make sense,\" these scientists usually aren't on the fro \nlines, nor are they policy-makers. The Technocracy runs t \nropagate its own structure. Once upon a time, the Order \neason tumbled to science as a tool to advance its agenda of \nprotecting humanity. Now, that tool and others fall into the \nhands of agents who may still have that agenda or may have \nSo what, you say? This is why the Technocracy doesn't \nbother trying to figure out Tradition magic. Remember, since \nTechnocratic researchers don't believe that magic \nit doesn't, for them anyway.

Maybe science never \nan explain the strange things these people do- and somewhere \nalong the way, the Union stopped caring to explain. They \ndecided that \"magic\" was dangerous, so it had to go. \nThe end result: The Technocracy doesn't really care wh \nTradition magic comes from, or how it works, or why. This i \nvery scientific, but that's because the Union is not about scie \nfor science's sake. All the Union cares about is making a better \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nOverwhelming Force \nThis form of the Technocracy strikes without warning. Suddenly, \ncombat cyborgs are chasing the players, NWO cutouts are everywhere, \ngenetically engineered monsters are crawling out of the sewers, and \nspace Marines in power-armor are coming through the roof of the \nChantry! This kind of Technocracy can be very cathartic, a target-rich \nenvironment for the players to get all Matrix on. It can also ruin a story, \nkill off all the players if they aren’t careful, and often is very much at \nodds with the feel of many Laws of Ascension chronicles. Care should \nbe used in making this the standard version of the Technocracy in your \nchronicle, as it can be hard to manage, and is always available as an \noption when needed. \nBeleaguered Hostiles \nThe Technocracy is spread thin, but the players don’t know how \nthin. There are actually only a handful of agents in your local area, in \nthis version of the Technocracy - \nthey work through cutouts and \nunwitting pawns for the most part. While this can be similar to \n“Shadowy Nemesis”, in this version the agents who are around are more \nout in the open. A Man in White might show up on the doorstep of the \nChantry (carefully providing for plenty of defenses and lots of \nplainclothes officers about) to let the players know they are under \nsurveillance, and if they step out of line.. .. \nIntimidation and misdirection are the tools of the Technocracy in \nthis case. The agents on point know the only way to keep the Traditions \noff their backs until they can gather forces to definitively squash them \nis to keep them off-balance and guessing, never knowing when, or if, the \nTechnos are going to strike. \nPotential Allies \nEspecially suited for a game with a number of Sons of Ether and \nVirtual Adepts, or other technology- and science-friendly characters in \nit, this version of the Technocracy is surprisingly friendly. Oh, they’ll \nstomp on anyone who gets too far out of line, but other than that, their \nprimary focus appears to be elsewhere. You can let the players hear \nabout operations against the shapeshifters in the nearby national park, \nor actions taken to stop the outbreak of some plague. These Technos \nmight even ask for help, once in a while - \nworking at stopping the \nmachinations of a crazed Marauder, or eliminating a particularly nasty \nNephandi cult. \nBut there should always be a glimmer of doubt, of hidden malice. \nAre the Technos really nicer than the characters’ masters said they \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwould be, or is that Lady in Gray with her not-quite-convincing smile \njust luring them into a trap? Things are rarely as they seem with the \nTechnocracy, and wheels within wheels rule their agendas. \nTKHNKRACYKENTEWD \nG m ~ s  \nOf course, sometimes you have to put on your shades, play the good \nguys and kick some Reality Deviant ass. That’s where Technocracy \nchronicles come in. A Technocracy chronicle is a chance for people to \ndress to the nines, pull out their scientific magazine subscriptions and \ngo hunting for freaky Things that Should Not Be. It’s a game about \nbeing the Man and part of the System, but also about being a hero. \nThe Technocracy has its flaws and problems. At heart, the machine \nof the Union plans to go on, with agendas hard-wired centuries ago and \npolicies that are obsolete and contradictory. Even the New World \nOrder can’t completely eliminate bureaucratic inefficiency - \nand \nParadox, it seems, even strikes to cripple social orders. So it is that \nTechnocracy characters could range from the cold, heartless agents \nwho cover up supernatural events and bring out the inhumanly heavy \nfirepower, to sympathetic, insightful researchers and protectors who \nwant to make the world a better place. It’s up to you to decide which \nstyle of play you prefer, or whether to have elements of both. \nIncluded in this book are all the Conventions of the Technocracy, \nas well as some of their specific abilities and tools. With these, you can \nbuild your own Technocracy characters, whether as protagonists or \nvillains. \nTKHNKRACY \n@P T m s  \nWhen you’re organizing Technocracy groups, the smallest group is \nthe op team - \na squad formed to deal with specific emergencies or \nproblems. Sometimes they’re formed “on the fly” in response to an issue. \nIn other cases, they’re long-standing groups of allied Technocrats who \ncombine skills to complete tasks, in an X-Files-like fashion. \nThe Technocracy can and does use normal people in its work. \nIndeed, many of the Union’s agents don’t even realize the nature of the \nconspiracy for which they work. Player groups, however, if they consist \nprimarily of Enlightened individuals, probably know at least passingly \nof the Union and its organization. While they have day jobs and normal \nlives, they also do special tasks for the Technocracy to accomplish \nthings that normal governments and agencies can’t or won’t deal with. \nMore importantly, while some players might enjoy playing an \nunEnlightened operative, for most games you’ll want to forge entire \ngroups of Enlightened agents. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nA Technocratic op team is roughly equivalent to a Tradition cabal: \nA group of mages that all work together for common goals. Op teams in \nturn report to higher-level facilities, such as Technocratic Constructs \n(bases). In many cases, higher-level administrators in the Union hand \ndown specific goals and instructions. Some op teams, though, have wide \nleeway to investigate and resolve cases of Deviants on their own. As a \nStoryteller, you can be as controlling or as free-handed as you wish with \nyour players, either keeping them in rigid lockstep or assuming that their \nsuperiors don’t have the time or inclination to watch over them heavily. \nUltimately, the Technocracy operates under the auspices ofcontrol. \nThis shadowy group of anonymous figures generally sends its missives \nand directives - \nincluding updates to the Time Table, the plan for \nworld innovation and influence - \ndown through the many layers of \nEnlightened bureaucracy. In dire cases, someone from Control may \nbecome more directly involved, but in modern eras this is not only very \nrare but very difficult. Representatives of Control use anonymity as a \nshield and source of power; they distance themselves from problem \nsituations, so as to avoid repercussions. As many agents of Control are \nliterally hundreds of years old, thanks to biological and bionic \nengineering, and they reside in Constructs on the other side of the \nDimensional Barrier (the Gauntlet), they don’t make trips to Earth \nfrivolously. With communication sporadic due to the strength of the \nDimensional Barrier, field agents usually hear of Control only third- \nhand. \nLKATICBN \nThe locales of a Technocracy-centered story are often very different \nthan those of an ordinary Laws of Ascension game, although there is \nsubstantial overlap (and in a mixed game, of course, there will be \nlocations fitting both/all sides). Technocracy games take place in \nscience labs and starship bridges, in submarines exploring the Marianas \nTrench and Wall Street trading floors. They are often the antithesis of \nTradition sites; where a Hermetic library is dusty and cramped, \noverflowing with ponderous tomes, the research library in a Progenitor \nlab complex is clean and tidy. It may be tightly organized, with roll-out \nshelving units to store data tapes and research files, or open and \nspacious, with plenty of room to slide one’s chair out from the computer \nwhile contemplating the wrapping of an artificial protein. \nIn terms of actual locations for play, almost any university contains \na wealth of spots that can be used. Actual chemistry or other science \nlabs can be very cool places, but keep in mind the fact that they are often \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nresearch equipment. Actual computer labs, server rooms or wiring \nclosets are also probably off-limits, lest the wrath of a real sysadmin \ncome down upon your head! \nIf you can’t use those kinds of areas, there is still a lot you can do to \nsimulate them. An ordinary classroom can be turned into a lab with the \nhelp of some tubing, a burned-out oscilloscope (or better, a working \none), and some miscellaneous widgets and gadgets. Some working (but \nnot irreplaceable) computers, gotten for cheap at a computer show or \ndonated/ borrowed from the computer interest floor can help make a \nlounge look like the computer center in a laid-back Iteration X front \nOf course, the Technocracy’s agents also spend time in the field. \nAll of the burned-out buildings, street games and glitzy clubs are open \nto them, where they’ll be watching over humanity, taking notes and \nhunting down their adversaries. \nLING@ \nAND IARGCDN \nWhile on a rules-specific level the Technocrats are ultimately \nmages, they don’t see themselves that way and would never refer to \nthemselves in such a fashion. For those used to the terms from Laws of \nAscension, this handy guide gives you the ways that the Technocracy \nsees everything. \nArcane: “Cloaking.” Some agents are so unobtrusive that it’s \nalmost impossible to track them. Others have specific programs at work \nto remove their identities from databases and records. \nArete: “Enlightenment.” The stream of high-level thought and \nintuition combined that allows the operative to understand the universe \non a fundamental level imperceptible to the common man. \nAvatar Background: “Genius.”The subconscious parts of the mind \nthat whisper hints and offer dreams to help break through the barriers \nof mundane science. \nAvatar Essence: “Eidolon.” The form that dreams and inspirations \noften take when they suddenly bubble forth to give new ideas. \nAwakening: “Empowerment.” The fundamental spark of Genius \nChantry: “Construct.” A place for operatives to gather and a \nConsors: “Citizens.” Useful aides and confederates (although they \nwhen the agent realizes his ability to change the world. \n- \ncentral information source. \n: \nmay not know it). \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDream Background: “Hypercram.” Technocrats don’t connect to \nany sort of universal unconscious. Instead, they call upon the densely \nimpacted knowledge imparted with their training, and sometimes \nformulate amazing leaps of deduction from it. \nFocus: “Apparatus.” A technological device that assists in the \nperformance of Enlightened Science. \nHorizon Realm: “Colony.” A place in extradimensional space \nwhere the Technocracy maintains a stronghold. \nMagic: “Inspired (or Enlightened) Science.” Magic is an aberration. \nIt doesn’t work in the lab; it shouldn’t work at all. True agents use their \nphenomenal knowledge of science and technology to “bend” the rules \nof the cosmos. \nMentor Background: “Patron.” A higher-ranking figure who offers \nadvice and occasional behind-the-scenes aid. \nQuintessence: “Prime energy.” The whole universe vibrates on a \nsubquantum level with the raw energy of Creation’s frequency. \nEnlightened personnel with the right tools can sense and manipulate \nthat energy, thus reinforcing or reversing aspects of the cosmos. \nSanctum: “Laboratory.” A clean room with controlled conditions \nwhere experimental Inspired Science is almost guaranteed to work \nwithout drawbacks or hindrances. \nSleepers: “The Masses.” Common people, unEnlightened. \nSorcerer: “Extraordinary Citizen.” An otherwise unEnlightened \nperson who still manages to follow and grasp certain specific Enlightened \nprocedures, and can thereby perform certain very limited feats of \nEnlightened Science. \nSpirit Sphere: “Dimensional Science.” Spirits are useless rubbish \nfrom superstitious cultures. Quantum physics shows that “spirits” are \nreally emanations and creatures from other dimensions. \nTradition mage: “Superstitionist.” Someone who believes in and \nuses the power of superstition. That it works for a few people is \nirrelevant; that such power is dangerous to humanity is of paramount \nconcern. \nWonder: “Device.” A tool that uses Enlightened Science so far \nbeyond mundane technology that it seems impossible is a special \nDevice. Sadly, such devices are often prone to malfunction and require \nlots of maintenance (i.e., they suffer Paradox). \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nlocation, it is strongly recommended that you place a restriction \ncostuming to avoid any outfits that might be misconstrued. \nmake sure nobody is unduly alarmed and calls the cops to \nnervous when they hear about such things. \nthe owners of the site know about it ahead of time, \nss to the location as much as you can, and make sure \ngoing on. If you have a member of your group who is actu \npolice officer, ormember of the campus security, they should b \nrepresentative (that will usually be you, as the chief \nwho has been listed as the contact person, and who is r \nquestions if the police do show up. That means, by the way \nshould leave the Merlin robes at home - \na conservativ \nlot more presentable. \nENLIGHTENED \nSCIENCE \nLoopholes. Enlightened Science is all about loopholes. \nReality has laws. Energy flows from areas of high potential to areas \nof low potential. A dropped item falls. Whether these laws are just \nbeliefs so deeply ingrained in the subconscious of humanity that even \nthe Awakened are unable to flaunt them indiscriminately, or are actual \nobjective laws of reality, is a subject of great debate. In the end, despite \nwhat scholars in the Technocracy and the Traditions may believe or \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nargue, they are real. The laws are there, and the Technocracy wrote the \ndefinitions, the case law and the majority opinions. \nSo the Technocrats know the loopholes and exceptions. They \nknow the sub-paragraphs and exit clauses. This gives the Technocracy \ntheir greatest advantage, and their greatest weakness. The average \nTradition mage is willing to flaunt the rules of reality, bend them and \nbreak them at will. ATechnocrat must work within the laws- indeed, \nmost are unaware that they can break the rules. Only those Technocrats \nwith very high Enlightenment scores are truly aware that reality is \nconsensual, and that technology is merely magic gone static. \nFor most Technocrats, their foci are more than just convenient \ntools for concentrating their will - \nthey are the means by which they \nalter the universe. Just as a soldier relies on his rifle to kill, Technocrats \nrely on their foci to create the Effects they use. An Iteration X cyborg \nwithout his plasma gun can no more blow up the car across the street \nthan a soldier without a grenade launcher can. Enlightened Scientists \nare able to wrap their minds around concepts and ideas most Sleepers \nfind difficult or impossible to understand, granting them the ability to \nwork with technologies most simply cannot make work, regardless of \ntraining, but they still must have access to those technologies. So a \nTechnocrat can’t just wave a magic wand, mumble a few incantations, \nand cause a bouquet of roses to appear in his other hand. But he could \ntrigger a holographic generator, or activate a sub-space wrinkle \ntransporter, or use nanoassemblers to create the roses out of the \nelements located nearby and the effect would be the same, or nearly so. \nThe most advanced Technocrats finally begin to understand what \nit is to be Awakened in a consensual universe, but even they find it \ndifficult to perform Enlightened Science outside the paradigms of \ntechnology and science. Their own beliefs and doctrines get in the way \nof their magics - without their tools, any Effects they try are \nautomatically vulgar with witnesses, or simply fail outright. \nPARADCBX \nAND TECHNICAL \nSYSTE~I-IS \nAlthough most Technocrats will hotly deny it (speaking instead of \n“system crashes”, “hardware failures”, “genetic incompatibilities” and \neven “subconscious use of anti-psi”), technological systems are just as \nprone to Paradox effects, although the manifestations are usually less \nflamboyant than those suffered by the Tradition mages. (This, of \ncourse, depends largely on the Effect and the device used; Iteration X \nmages are known for their rather.. . pyrotechnic Paradox backlashes, as \nwhen a laser’s super-conducting power cells backfire.) \ni; - \n.d -.- \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAlmost any science is of use to some arm of the Technocracy, but \nthese are some of the more commonly encountered ones. \nNanotechnology: Use of molecular-scale devices and engi- \nneering. This can create amazingly perfect materials, assemble or \ndisassemble objects out of (or into) seeming nothingness, heal \nimpossible wounds and all manner of other “miracles.” Its drawbacks \nare heat, and the possibility of the nanobots getting out of control. \nHyperphysics: The study of extremely advanced (and theoreti- \ncal, to modern scientists) physics involving alternate universes; \n“imaginary” numbers, materials and sub-atomic properties; and gross \nmanipulation of the space-time continuum. The drawbacks to this \nence include the massive power requirements, and the extreme \nanger of most of the effects; one wrong step usually means death for \nthe subject, experimenter and everyone else within a couple blocks \nof the experiment site. \nComputers: Computers are everywhere in the Technocracy, \nand are used for everything from record-keeping to doing predictive \nanalysis on future trends and overseeing routine surveillance gear. Of \ncourse, computers are only as perfect as their programmers. \nCheinistry: Including medicines, drugs, poisons and many other \nsubstances. Advanced fuels, plastics and other materials, \nexplosives and super-adhesives are all some of the to \nmakes possible. Drawbacks include the difficulty of synthesizing \ny of these compounds, the hazards in storing and shipping them, \nsheer cost of manufacturing and their side-effects. \nMemetics: The science of ideas and thought constructs. Memes \nare ideas or concepts that are infectious; they can spread, replicate, \n“breed” with other memes to create new ideas; they can even be \ninoculated against, engineered and isolated. Some examples are \ncatchy songs, advertising logos, slogans, urban myths and ideologies \n(most -isms are complexes of interrelated memes). This is different \nfrom psionics, below, in that a meme doesn’t have to be deliver \ntelepathically, and someone with strong mental defenses may still \nsusceptible to attacks by hostile memes. \nPhysics: More conventional studies than hyperphysics, in g \neral. Room temperature superconductors, high-energy lasers and \nplasma, magnetic acceleration systems, sonic fields, advanced aerody- \nnamics and many other advances. Paradox tends to be messy and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ninvolve a lot of exploding stuff - \nmost Technocracy physics devices \npack a lot of power into a fairly small space. \nPsionics: A controversial field of study in the Technocracy, \nbut one with slowly gaining popularity. NWO agents use telepathy \nto ferret out secrets, projective empathy (and sub-sonic sound \nwaves) to give themselves the sense of unease and dread that \nsurrounds them, and mind shields to keep unwanted intruders out \nof their cerebrums. Progenitors hold up psionics as the ultimate \nperfection of the mind. Still, psionics smacks of magic in the eves \nof many (including most in Iteration X), and its study, while not \nbanned, is subject to more than the usual levels of oversight. \nGenetic Engineering: Along with its close cousin cloning, \nnetics is the home ground of the Progenitors. With the right bit \nresquencing, a Gengineer can create a new protein for use in \nnanotechnology, a microbe that deposits titanium in a particular \npattern when it dies, or a supervirus. Larger-scale operations are \nalso possible; cloned dinosaurs and other extinct creatures have \nbeen kept in isolated zoological research centers, and stranger \ncreations (called Chimera) have been created, although their \nChaos Math/Complexity: Chaos math is the \nis meteorology; the planet is so large, and so many factors involved \nin the weather, that it is impossible to predict it beyond a certain \nset of general trends, and very short-scale predictions of limited \naccuracy. Fractals are another example of chaos theory. An under- \nstanding of how complex systems work, what can be predicted and \nwhat can't, how trends work, and where the borderline between \nlinear, predictable systems and nonlinear, complex systems falls is \nvital to almost all aspects of the Technocracy, but the NWO and \nSyndicate make perhaps the most direct applications of these \nCybernetics: At its most fundamental level, cybernetics is \nstudy of augmenting or enhancing the human body with mechan \nsystems; a pair of glasses might be considered a cybernetic device. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe earliest legends speak of smiths and craftsmen able to build \ntools and weapons that were impossibly strong, light or sharp - \nthese \nwere the predecessors to the modem Iteration X. The Artificers (also \nknown as the High Artisans) could be found building weapons of war \nfor Thothmes in Egypt, steam-powered toys in Greece and the great \nwaterworks of Rome. During the “Dark Ages”, their wonders delighted \nthe courts of Arabia and Persia, and fortified the walls of Byzantium. \nThe coming of the Renaissance saw the High Artisans brought to new \nheights of power. They joined the Order of Reason, and their \nmechanisms, printing presses, gunpowder weapons, clockwork devices \nand mathematics helped create new ideas about civilization, science \nand technology, laying the groundwork for an ideal of science and \nrationality that persists to this day. The hidden lords of the Industrial \nRevolution, the High Artisans grew increasingly fascinated with the \nmechanical computing engines first prototyped by Charles Babbage, \nrevising and improving them until, in an unknown iteration, one \nachievedsentience. Inoverjoyedcelebration, the High Artisans renamed \nthemselves “Iteration X ,  in honor of their success. \nA Convention composed of engineers, mathematicians, physicists \nand computer scientists and programmers, for many years ItX provided \nthe weapons (and weapon carriers) of the Technocracy. HIT-Marks and \ncyborgs provided shock troops, and ItX-designed sidearms and defenses \nprovided more fragile agents (Enlightened or not) with the firepower \nthey needed to pursue the Pogrom. IterationX was one of the most fervent \npursuers of the assault on the Traditions, tracking down and destroying \nmages and Chantries with a brutality that disturbed even their peers in \nthe Union. Tradition rumors (and Technocracy turncoats) speak of \nmassive slave labor camps outside the Barrier, and Tradition mages (or \nparts of them) being converted into killer cyborgs and turned against \ntheir former allies. On the flip side, the Iterators contend that they’ve \nneither the inclination nor the budget to pursue such tremendously costly \nand dubious ventures; besides, why turn someone into a slave in a \nConstruct when a couple of simple chips in the head will let the person \ngo back to a safe, normal, productive and non-Deviant lifestyle? \nIteration X theoretically follows a strict hierarchy of command and \ncontrol, deviated from only in extreme situations. At the bottom of the \nConvention are the unEnlightened poles, who take care of most of the \nday-to-day tasks. Ranging from lab assistants, graduate students and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsome professors, IT professionals to secretaries, security officers, tech- \nnicians and maintenance personnel (many of them not even aware of \nwhat they are part of), proles also form the core memberships of labor \nunions (particularly in technological fields), Internet discussion and \nspecial interest groups, and professional organizations. Especially gifted \nmembers (including Enlightened Scientists, but also Extraordinary \nCitizens and Sleeper scientists or researchers of unusual merit) are \nrecruited as Ciphers, and placed in a grueling training program. Ciphers \nare often unaware they have been recruited; they find themselves \nworking on demanding jobs in frustrating projects, sent to far-away \ncities and forced to live in motels, or stuck with incredible classloads \nunder dictatorial professors. Those who persevere are promoted to the \nstatus of Armature, the lowest actual rank in the Convention. Until \nrecently, all Armatures, regardless of their final position or calling, \nserved for a time in a front line combat unit; while this practice has \nfallen out of favor, most Armatures receive at least some basic combat \ntraining. \nSince Earth lost contact with the Union's extraterrestrial holdings, \nand the end of the Pogrom, Iteration X has undergone a change that \nmany in the Technocracy see as for the better. Younger, more flexible \nprogrammers and Armatures are taking charge of the Union's Earthbound \noperations, bringing with them new ideas about how the Convention \nshould proceed and what sciences are important. Where many of the \nhigher-ranking members of the Convention frowned on \nnanotechnology, quantum physics and other esoteric studies, preferring \nthe stability and predictability OfNewtonianphysics, younger members \nthrive on the new sciences. A subscription to Paradigma, (the newsletter \nand research journal of the Sons of Ether) has for many years been \nconsidered a minor breach of Protocol, but rumors circulate that some \nArmatures may be (or already are) seeking closer ties with their \nTradition cousins, particularly the younger generation of Etherites, \nwhich is more concerned with cutting-edge sciences and alternate \ntheories, and less with etherships and radium projectors. Another \nrumor, that a Virtual Adept is nothing more than an Xer on the \nweekends, may have more truth to it; the Virtual Adepts and Iteration \nX have always had common interests, even after the Adepts left the \nUnion. \nRoleplaying Hints: Not every Iteration X member is a rigid- \nthinking automaton under constant surveillance by her implants and \nfollowing pre-programmed orders, despite what Tradition propaganda \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nand Technocracy lore would have some believe. The average Armature \nis a low-ranking scientist, computer technician, server administrator, \nprogrammer or other high-tech professional. \nSpecialty Sphere: Mutter \nCommon Foci: Sensor gear, lab equipment, cybernetic systems, \nConvention Advantage: Hardware Supremacy \nIterators have access to the best hardware available - \nand if they \ndon't have it, they can make it. All Iterators have two free levels to split \nbetween Enhancements and Devices as desired; these can be added to \nlevels taken as Backgrounds or with free Traits or experience, up to the \nusual limit. \nAn Iterator's hardware familiarity and knowledge also translates \ninto real competence in dealing with modern technology. Once per \nsession, an Iterator can make a free special retest when coaxing \nperformance out of some piece of technology, be it a Device or a \nmundane bit of tech. This doesn't apply to magical challenges (it can't \nbe used to retest an Enlightenment test) but does give an Iterator an \nedge on Computer and Technology challenges, even if the Iterator \ndoesn't have a lot of personal experience with the items in question. \nConvention Disadvantage: Dimensional Incompetence \nFor many years, members of Iteration X were forbidden to learn the \nSphere of Dimensional Science (Spirit). While the lack of contact with \nAutocthonia (the home of Iteration Xs vaunted sentient Computer \nand controller) has allowed some adventurous members to take tutelage \nfrom members of the Void Engineers or the NWO, they still find this \npathofstudyadifficult one. Members of IterationX may not begingame \nplay with this Sphere, and pay double to acquire levels or rotes using it. \nAdditionally, Iterators typically have some sort of monitoring \nimplant hand-in-hand with their usual technological wonders. Assume \nthat at any time an Iterator's location can be found (unless magically \nshielded) by his superiors, so he'd better not screw up. \ncomputers, robots, nanotechnology, hyperphysics, energy weapons \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nhese Iterators create the hardware and implants that go i \nStatisticians - \nMathematicians and hyperphysicists wh \ndelve into abstract models of the universe. \nss and resolve issues in projects, as well as working on \nkeep projects working as well-oiled as the machines they bu \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nHistorically, the New World Order’s functional roots seem quite \nrecent compared to the rest of the Technocracy - \nrecords claim that \nQueen Victoria created the NWO by fiat as a bureaucracy to deal with \nthe transition of government from a religious, divinely backed edifice \nto an enlightened, reasoned nation-state. Conspirators point out, \nthough, that the Order has roots stretching back to such early groups as \nthe Cabal of Pure Thought, a religious conspiracy devoted to the spread \nof orthodoxy under one united church. Noting the NWO’s penchant \nfor advanced planning and political manipulation, a few pundits claim \nthat the group actually socially re-engineered itself from its roots as a \nreligious conspiracy so that it could purge divisive or conservative \nelements and create its own rebirth. Regardless of the truth, NWO \nhistorians consider the matter closed. Drawing inspiration from such \nhistorical figures as Hammurabi and his famous legal code, or Confucius \nand his Analects, the NWO points out that so long as humans have \norganized in groups, they’ve always had governments, information \ndisseminators, educators and secrets. From such roots comes the New \nWorld Order, but only the Order’s highest academics can tell where it’ll \ngo. \nThe New World Order oversees the dissemination of information \nin all its forms and the structures that build around that information. \nGovernments, academies and media outlets all hover along the NWO’s \nfringe of influence. Let the Syndicate concentrate on the buying and \nselling - \nthe NWO focuses on those things that people don’t buy, on \npublic goods and externalities like infrastructure or the moral ambiguity \nof legal codes. Other Conventions provide hard-tech while the NWO \ncollates historical information, makes projections for future society, \narranges hyperefficient bureaucracy and political communication, \nstreamlines dissemination and education procedures, and locks away \nthe things that people don’t need to know about. Hand-in-hand with \nthese programs are the editation projects to rewrite history to the \nTechnocracy’s liking, removing all “superstitious” viewpoints that \nwould hinder the Union’s goals, and the political projects to carefully \nbalance world development in hopes of raising the Masses’ intelligence \nand education to a less dangerous level. Tradition mages speak fearfully \nof NWO’s practiced conditioning techniques: according to rumor, the \nappearance of black-suited agents means that someone will disappear \nsoon after with no records left. Most fearsomely, the NWO does oversee \npsychological conditioning, and their special projects in the halls of \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nRoom 101 provide whispered, terrifying stories. Those who return from \nsuch conditioning sessions don't need any technological alterations to \ntheir minds or bodies - \nthe advanced psychology of the NWO turns \ntraitors into loyalists, rebels into conformists and the most staunch \nTraditionalist into a Technocratic operative. \nAs the masters of bureaucracy, the New World Order oversees \ncommunication not only internally but among the other divisions of \nthe Technocracy. New recruits and education programs most often \nform out of the NWO's advance planning. Of course, other Conventions \nsuspect that NWOeducation indoctrinates agents with hidden loyalties, \nbut the NWO's psychology also insures that such recruits often have \nveryusehl talents- \ntheNWOknows how to pick them. UnEnlightened \nrecruits fall into the category of Sympathizers, including everything from \ntrained spies to the occasional janitor who keeps an ear out. Those who \nmove up in the Convention gain prestige and influence according to \ntheir pursuits: Academics have limited pull but can set policy with their \npapers and reports, while media pundits exert their ties on the Masses \nsubtly. The most infamous ranking agents are the Men in Black, \nEnlightened field operatives (or sometimes clones or constructs) who \nwear the signature black suit, black tie, blackshoes and shades and have \nall the influence one would expect of a covert government operative. \nThe top of the NWO hierarchy lies with the mysterious Gray Men and \nMen in White, who oversee the Convention as a whole and maintain \northodoxy (such as it is in a non-religious organization) among the \nentire Union. \nThe modem New World Order always rides the forefront of social \nchange. Why not, with advanced social sciences 50 or a hundred years \nahead of the current human condition? This isn't to say that they're \nperfect; after all, they couldn't predict the Technocracy's current \nproblems, nor can they always model the vagaries of Tradition mages or \neven the occasional Deviant moving among the Masses. Some up-and- \ncoming operatives suspect that perhaps humanity is simply too complex \nto understand completely; the human spirit can't be bounded so easily. \nWith this in mind, field agents operate with greater personal discretion, \nso that they can bring their own intuition to bear on rapidly changing, \nunpredictable situations. Upper-level operatives - \nthose that remain \nand keep in touch-offer \nthe idea that the NWO should be guides, not \npolice, in the quest to shepherd humanity to a better social state. Ethics, \nonce considered a marginalized study that could be brought down to a \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncalculable state, now demands that perhaps some compromises aren't \nworth it. \nRoleplaying Hints: NWO operatives are savvy, alert and in charge. \nAlthough there's some room for personal eccentricities, all NWO \noperatives give off the impression that they've already laid plans and \ncontingencies for every possibility. With their superlative understanding \nof ethics, social evolution and information flow, agents constantly and \nintuitively put together disparate pieces of a scene to arrive at an \noverarching picture of the dynamics at work behind it. NWO members \ninclude everything from teachers and reporters to historians, politicians, \nspies, spin doctors and psychologists. \nSpecialty Sphere: Mind \nCommon Foci: Government ID badges, black suits, authoritarian \nbehaviors (\"It's a matter ofnational security\"), research papers, historical \nrecords, spy gadgets \nConvention Advantage: Information is Power \nNew World Order agents have access to some of the best informa- \ntion sources in human existence, and some can even open rare files of \nhistorical import that have long since been sealed away from the public \neye. Whether by calling in government favors or digging through \nacademic paperwork, an operative can find information on nearly any \ntopic. Every agent has two free levels in any combination of the \nfollowing Backgrounds: Contacts, Influence: Media or Influence: \nEspionage. \nFurthermore, the authoritarian and knowledgeable position of \nNWO agents places them regularly at the top of the chain for information \nretrieval. Information truly is power. Once per session, an agent can do \na background check on a piece of information gleaned from a Contact \nor Influence (it doesn't even have to have been one of the agent's \nContacts or Influences, if someone else cooperates). The agent \nautomatically determines whether the information is true or a deliberate \nfalsehood. This doesn't necessarily tell if it'saccurute, but will immediately \ntell if a Contact or Influence is giving incorrect information or if the \ninformation has been tampered with. \nConvention Disadvantage: Who Watches the Watchers? \nSometimes politicking gets in the way of free information flow. \nOther times, a superior determines that it's \"for the greater good\" that \ncertain files don't make it out, or that a given agent winds up on a hit \nlist for learning things better left unknown. NWO agents must step \ncarefully, because their Convention monitors them just as much as it \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmonitors everyone else. Somewhere, somebody has a record of every- \nthing an agent does on a mission - \nincluding every screw-up. Iterators \nmight have some sort of locator beacon, but the NWO agent has \nsomething arguably worse: a permanent record. \nAny NWO operative of higher rank than the character (typically, \nsomeone with higher Enlightenment and a commensurate posting in \nthe Convention) can use every Negative Reputation Trait the chructer has \never had in any Social Challenge against the character. \nAgents who rack up too many bad missions on their records (i.e., \ntoo many Negative Traits, at the Storyteller’s discretion) may be retired \nto desk jobs (taken out of active duty and play). \nlvoy Tower - \nAcademics and historians who perform pure \nresearch and soft science. The Ivory Tower intellectuals may \nm distant from worldly affairs, but have a firm handle on the \nOperatives - T h e  feared Men in Black work as \ntroubleshooters, taking care of problem elements. Their higher- \nlevel Gray Men and Men in White coordinate government \nsub-agencies and special policing units to keep a \nnfluence throughout the civilized world. \nstory and psycliology behind the world’s events. \nWatchers - \nMass media and instant information merge into \nhyperattenuated picture of the world, one that the Masses \nconsume readily. The Watchers observe and sometimes \nmanipulate this process to keep an eye out for social developme \nand nudge the public’s opinions. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nEarly man lived in constant fear of the mystery of death. Around \nevery corner waited disease, accidental injury, age and eventually the \ninevitable end. At first, humanity sought spiritual recourse from rigors \nthat couldn’t be avoided, constructing elaborate mystical causes for \nsickness and life. The blossoming of reason, though, bent Mankind to \nstudy of the self, which in turn led to the realization that perhaps some \nelements of the life process could be controlled. Famine could be \nwarded off with the cultivation of crops and animals. Disease could be \nhalted with sanitation and treatment. Certain herbs and practices \nreversed symptoms and even brought wellness where before only slow \ndeath lay. From these beginnings sprang the Cosians, researchers into \nthe process of life and all of its permutations. At first simple physicians, \nthe Cosians quickly took to the study of all biological phenomena. As \nthe Enlightened communities developed germ theory, cell theory, \nunderstanding of herbalism and pharmacology, and the repeatable \nbenefits of trauma care, the science of medicine came to fruition. At \nlength, these researchers reached for the ultimate question: Where does \nlife come from? How does it persist? In seeking the answers, they became \nthe Progenitors, the scientists and doctors who sustain - \nand create - \nlife. \nAs one would expect of a medically oriented Convention, the \nProgenitors count doctors, research physicians, pharmacologists and \npsychiatrists among their numbers. Less common but no less important \nare paleontologists, xenobiologists, botanists and other researchers \nwho contribute to the understanding of extinct creatures, \nextradimensional entities and the plants and animals that surround the \nhuman world. Through their studies, the Progenitors insure health and \nlong life; their regular treatments can cure grievous injuries, and even \nfield medicines greatly improve the survival chances of young \nTechnocratic operatives. High-ranking Technocrats undergo special \nprocedures to extend their lifespans, effectively renewing their flesh \nand returning youth to the mind. Even the Masses benefit; Progenitors \nworking in research hospitals turn their talents to saving all lives, and \ntheir work often slowly filters into the medical community. Perhaps \nmore frighteningly, the Convention experiments with the alteration \nand synthetic augmentation of living beings, and can and does create \nmutated animals, retroviruses that can re-engineer a human’s protein \nprocesses to change the body’s chemistry, or even clones sprung from a \nsingle sample of an individual. Rumor holds that many otherwise \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ndisabled agents or captured enemies are replaced with clones, and that \nthe Progenitors hold a special protein combination that causes such \ncopies to disintegrate quickly with a single application - \nor, equally \ndisturbingly, that Progenitor projects might contain the secrets to \nreversing any of their biological engineering. Such thoughts do not \ncomfort the agents who rely on Progenitor techniques for their continued \nhealth and youth. \nProgenitor ranks follow the same academic mindset that rules the \nrest of the Convention. While it's possible for someone without a \nprofessorial appointment or formal advanced degree to hold authority, \nit's rare; such highly Enlightened individuals usually learn to work \nwithin the system, at least for appearance's sake. At the low end, Street \nOps, Recruiters and Technicians handle the day-to-day maintenance of \nthe Convention, doing everything from working at public clinics to \nmaintaining hospital machinery or serving as interns. Enlightened \noperatives who show promise generally become Students under an \nexperienced Progenitor; these students participate in fieldwork and \nhone a research thesis, just like any other graduate student at a \nuniversity. The difference lies in the nature of the field work, which can \ninclude research on alien or Deviant creatures and high-security secret \nmedical technology. A surviving Student whose thesis passes muster \ngoes on to become a Research Assistant, usually posted to a specific \nConstruct for continued training, but given greater discretion to pursue \npersonal projects. Some RAs instead continue field work, to support \ntheir own theories, to gather specimens or just to stay out of the lab. \nPrimary Investigators and Research Directors operate at the top rungs; the \nPIS follow through on important topics of research, using their formidable \nEnlightenment to bring unique solutions to bear, while the RDs decide \non the up-and-coming technologies to study. RDs also handle all of the \nTechnocracy-related political maneuvering, since they have the long \noverview of the Convention's work. The only ones above the RDs are \nthe Progenitor elements associated with Control, the Administration - \nwho have all the qualities one would expect of hospital administrators \nwho're seen only through paperwork, intermediaries and their special \noperatives for dealing with emergency situations (\"Damage Control\" \nteams). \nThe Progenitors have fortunately undergone a hefty shift in policy \nover the last few years. Originally, the modern Administration seemed \nbent on the creation of genegineered creatures, augmented clones and \ntailored viruses almost purely out of some grotesque \"pure research\" \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ndirective. Doubtless some of this had to do with the fact that Progenitor \nAdministrators had an effective life expectancy outstripping anything \nelse in the Technocracy; the heads of the Convention were, quite \nliterally, old-school physicians from the Renaissance, still obsessed \nwith the creation of creatures and with raw experimentation as compared \nto logical, scientific medical development. With the Administration \nout of the picture, the Progenitor RDs and, in some cases, PIS have taken \nthe initiative to re-organize their departments for specialized research \nin different areas of personal interest. A Progenitor Student is unlikely \nto see or engineer some sort of monstrous beast unless it’s for specific \nstudy; disease programs initially made for bio-war have turned into \npathogen control centers. While the Convention can and does still \nperform biological augmentation for combat operatives, the focus of the \nvast majority of Progenitor work now lies directly in line with improving \nthe human condition and understanding the processes of life. Many \nProgenitors now openly assert that this is where it should’ve been all \nalong. \nRoleplaying Hints: Fully 95 percent of Progenitors hail from \nexperienced medical academic backgrounds, and it shows. Most are \naffluent, fit and just a little bit nerdy - \nnot too much contact with \npeople outside the lab for 30 years, after all. Many have the glazed, \nstressed-out look of an overworked medical intern, but their \nEnlightenment makes them sharp and steady when it comes to medical \nmatters. \nSpecialty Sphere: Life \nCommon Foci: Medical equipment, surgical tools, retroviruses, \nCHON (carbon-hydrogen-oxygen-nitrogen - the basis of living \nproteins) reservoirs, genegineering, grafts, psionic enhancements \nConvention Advantage: Better Living Through Chemistry \nAccess to pharmacoepia, retroviral engineering, protease inhibi- \ntors and catalysts, grafts, cloned transplants and any number of minor \nmedical miracles gives Progenitors a leg (or two) up on physical health \nand recovery. Due to minor enhancements, body tailoring and just dam \ngood medical care, a Progenitor heals all damage as if it were one health \nlevel less severe for time purposes. (This is 10 minutes/ one hour for the \nBruised level). \nA Progenitor earns one level of Medicine Ability and one level of \nInfluence: Medicine as a by-product of working in university medical \ndepartments for so long. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nConvention Disadvantage: Stuck in the Lab \nProgenitors, more than just about any other Conventioneers, \nspend their days (and nights, and weekends) stuck in the lab. Earning \nan M.D. is taxing enough, but Students must prove themselves above \nand beyond the “normal” medical crew. Progenitors cannot begin play \nwith more than two Abilities outside their medical study profile. This \neffectively limits Progenitors to mostly having Academics, Biotech, \nHypertech, Medicine, Research, Science and Technology. Furthermore, no \nAbility can ever be raised above the level of the highest of these - \nthus, \nif a Progenitor wants to learn five levels of an Ability, he must first learn \nfive levels in one of his university disciplines (most likely Medicine). \nForced Adaptation and Clone Alteration Developmental Eugenecists \n(FACADE Engineers) - \nCloning experts who produce tissue, \ngans and entire bodies. These clones can, with Enlightened \nience, even take on the memories of their originals, thereby \norking as replacement bodies or spies, and also serve as raw meat \nmanufacture of HIT-Marks and low-grade Men in Black. \nCADE Engineers also perform surgery and trauma care. \nGenegineers - \nSpecialists ingenetic manipulationand protein \nrecombination. The creations of the Genegineers are born better, \nster and stronger, but often have unforeseen chaotic side-effects \nom Paradox). Both monsters and supermen come from these \nlabs. The sub-division of Damage Control specifically designs bio- \nly for use against Reality Deviants. \nPhmopoeists - \nChemists and biologists who examine the \nhuman body with outside influences and \nng from herbalism to high-tech pharmaceuticals \nthodology’s purview. Some Pharmacopoeists \nalso started researching the interconnectedness of macro- \nthe human place in the living world \ne refer to it - \nout of earshot of the New W \n’ I, ‘.-, ..\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSYNDICATE \n“What do you want?” is a signature question of the Syndicate. It’s \nall about money, this Convention claims - \nor, at least, about what \npasses for money. From crude barter to the innovation of coins, then \npaper money, and finally modem credit and debit, the traders and \nfinanciers have been the grease that lubricated human progress. Medieval \nguildsmen protecting their livelihood formed trade consortiums to \nguarantee their product quality and training; later, these High Guilds \nbecame powerhouses of the Renaissance, issuing letters of credit that \ncould be cashed in faraway cities. Hard currency gave way to portable \npaper with no intrinsic value; only the value that people perceived in \nan otherwise worthless scrap propped up emerging economies. Finally, \npeople accepted even invisible currency: the idea of notes or cards that \nsymbolized not only a fixed amount but a potential to earn or a chance \nto spend. The transaction of humanity culminates in the Syndicate, \nwhich places a value on everything and pushes humanity to a society \nwhere every trade registers in ephemeral energy that tracks everyone’s \nwants and needs. \nUp front, the Syndicate sounds like a cartel - \ncriminals and money \nmen, shady dealers and con artists. The true Syndicate agent realizes, \nthough, that only the desperate trade with criminals; to become a true \nconnoisseur of money, one must earn trust. That makes the high-profile \nSyndicateers bond traders, international bankers and investors, but also \nmarketing reps, empowerment speakers, even social commentators. \nOther Conventions make things, but it’s the Syndicate that provides \nthe luxury of doing so: Without the patronage of the purse-strings, \nthere’s no funding for expensive toys. The Syndicate knows who’s \nbuying what, be it mundane or Enlightened, and they hold the \ndisbursements for many of the Union’s most important projects. While \nsome operatives might complain that this unfairly burdens their research \nwith Syndicate agendas, the Syndicate itself wisely points out that \nmoney doesn’t come from nowhere, even with Enlightened Science. \nThe Syndicate’s top representatives can smooth out even the most \nruffled feathers, and in conjunction with the rest of the Union, \ninfluence the market pricing and introduction of new technology - \nas \nwell as buying off politicians and leveraging out entire corporations or \ncountries. \nCorporate mentality dominates the Syndicate. As a result, the \nbottom ranks are those who rely on the good graces of the company: the \nProviders, who work indirectly for the Syndicate in return for a paycheck \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthat goes back into the Syndicate's pockets through debts and bills. \nThose who manage to turn around their financial fortunes and realize \ntheir ability to control transactions may rise to become Associates, who \nare actual (very junior) partners in the Syndicate's pseudo-corporate \nhierarchy. Associates handle day-to-day business for the Syndicate, \noften working mundane jobs while occasionally doing side work \ncoordinating larger projects or making sure that a specific account has \njust the right delay or expedite to meet the requests of a supervisor in \nthe Convention. Associates who continually show not only financial \nacumen but also social skill move up to Management, and take on \nresponsibilities for overseeing entire Syndicate accounts, including \nsome of the funding for extra-Convention projects run by the Union. \nManagers have wide-ranging discretionary funding and connections \nthroughout dozens of companies and projects of all sizes. Above \nManagement are the Chairmen and Vice-Presidents of Operations; the \nformer set continental policies and hold voting power over proposed \nprojects, while the latter make up the Syndicate's contribution to \nControl and see to the continued financial development of human \neconomic systems. \nWhile some people might accuse the Syndicate of leeching off \nproductive angles of society, the Syndicate itself points out that all \nhuman behavior comes down to trades. Energy is expended in the \npursuits of survival, entertainment and procreation; that energy can be \nmeasured and traded, assigned to the same items that might fulfill those \nsame desires. The modem Syndicate isn't about money or debt, argue \nits agents: It's about calculating that exchange of energy, figuring out \nhow to evaluate efficiencies and place the most favorable transactions \nin places where they'll reap the most output. Forget leveraged buyouts \nwith stocks and holding debt over the heads of unwilling accomplices \n- \nthe real race now is to form an adaptable, imaginary currency that \ncan describe everything humans might trade without needing any solid, \nstealable form. \nRoleplaying Hints: Syndicate agents excel not only in the use of \nmoney, but also in the social circumstances of the transaction. That \nmeans they're poised, slick and able to sell anything - \nbe it an item or \na story-at \na moment's notice. Syndicateers recognize the value of first \nimpressions and surroundings, and tend to place themselves in situations \nwhere they can make an impression through the exercise of their \nincredible finances. \nSpecialty Sphere: Entropy \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCommon Foci: Credit cards, cell phones, wads of money, elec- \ntronic debit systems, gadgets bought from other Conventions, financial \nreports, economic predictions \nConvention Advantage: Money, Money, Money \nSince the Syndicate’s livelihood hinges on money, every Syndicate \nagent learns to handle and take charge of personal finance early on. A \nSyndicate operative has at least one level of Finance Ability and one \nlevel of the Resources Background; most have extensive Resources \nbeyond this as well. \nBecause of their incredible money and their ability to use it well, \nSyndicate ops who have access to their Resources can cash in levels of \nthat Background for extra Traits in a Social Challenge. Treat this as a \nnormal expenditure of Resources, so money spent this way is used up for \nthe game session. Each Background level grants one extra Social Trait, \nand this can be used to initiate a Social Challenge, too; even if the \nchallenge is lost, the money is simply spent, and the Resources are used \nfor the session but available again at the next game. The Syndicate op \ndoesn’t have to use all Resources at one time, but can only declare their \nuse before the challenge is entered - \nno fair swinging the vote in mid- \nstride; you either committed your Resources or you didn’t. (This \ntypically takes the form of a challenge like “I use my incredible Resources \nto convince you to see things my way.”) \nConvention Disadvantage: Everybody Hates Marketing \nBecause of their rumored belief that everyone can be bought, many \npeople consider the Syndicate’s agents little more than sleazy hucksters \n(if well-dressed, well-mannered sleazy hucksters). Even the Syndicate’s \nsocial acumen still only gives them the ability to put off this impression \nin person, and with effort; the Syndicate is often the target of all sorts \nof malicious rumors and slander when other Conventions think that \nnobody’s listening. \nDue to the Syndicate’s extensive bad rep (a lot of it earned), all \nSyndicate agents count as having one less Reputation Trait with all \nother Conventions. A Syndicate op can never gain free access to other \nConventions’ materials and research - \nthe operative must always use \nResources or equivalent trade (probably calculated with the Finance \nAbility); none of the other Conventions will give anything away for \nfree. They’ll only grudgingly part with their hard work, and then only \nfor the right price. Of course, a Syndicate agent knows that everyone \nhas a price and excels in figuring it out.. . . \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDisbursements - \nAs the credit holders for the entire Union, \nthe Disbursements division sees to funding of all important \nprojects and can halt or forward nearly anything with its stamp of \napproval. Every erg of transacted energy that makes its way to the \nUnion traces through some accounting line at Disbursements. \nThese financiers thus have the power to make or break \nTechnocracy projects, regardless of what the other Conventions \nmight consider critical or assured. \nEnforcers - \nAny good company needs security, and any \ninal organization needs muscle. The Syndicate is both, so the \nrcers serve double duty, from rep0 men to highly trained \nto simple thugs. Enforcers make sure that people respect \nwer of the Syndicate and of money, and that the bills are \nFinanciers - While Disbursements handles internal \nTechnocracy funding, the Financiers carefully adjust the world of \nhese super-economists see to the development of \national policy, the fate of megacorporations and the future of \nnking. Their wide-ranging vision allows them to take in the \ni \neconomic state of the world and make subtle manip \nlong-term benefits. \nMedia Control - \nThere's no sale when there's \ndia Control handles the packaging and perception angle \nrything that the Syndicate and Technocracy sells. From \nntees to blazing advertisements, Media Control \nects Division - \nMoney may not buy everything, \nhell of a lot, including some impressive toys. \nthe Syndicate must rely on the technologies of other \nions for hardware, the Special Projects Division sees to \nf promising and unique technologies from outside \ncy sphere. This gives the Syndicate access t \nr special patents that other Conventions don \ncases, this means dealing with companies t \ne decidedly Deviant bents, but as long as the money is goo \nis on time, nobody (in the Syndicate, anyway) is \nsures that people want to buy. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nVCEIID \nENGINEERS \nTo touch the stars, to ascend the brightest heaven of invention (in \na paraphrase of Shakespeare) - \nthe motive of exploration is so deep \nthat it touches a chord in the human soul that stirs poetry and grandeur. \nWhether from the first primal man who decided to see what was over \nthe next hill, or the one who wanted to conquer the night with fire, the \nVoid Engineers represent all the impulses to explore the world and \nmake it safe for humanity. Travel, once a dire hazard and improbable \ndifficulty, bent to the advent of maps, horses, sailing ships - \nand later, \nto the automobile, submarines and even spacecraft. The Void Engineers \noversaw it all. As the Celestial Masters and the Void Seekers of the \nRenaissance, they sought the twin goals of expanding knowledge of the \nterrestrial sphere and reaching for the heavens. They achieved both \ngoals; their early ships set down the oceans and islands into static form, \nmaking maps that anyone could use to aid travel. Their skyriggers and, \nlater, aircraft reached up into the ether and the Void, and although they \nfound many horrors, they also found the courage to continue exploring \nin places where Man had no right to tread. Be it in the depths of the \nocean, the darkest recesses of the Earth, the coldest reaches of space or \nthe chaotic realms of other dimensions, the Void Engineers have a \nsystem to map it, understand it and -perhaps - \nto some day make it \nsafe and habitable for Mankind. \nThe split between support structure and field work is pronounced \namong the Void Engineers, but nobody enters the Convention without \na passion for its work. Indeed, many Conventioneers relegated to \nsupport technologies and mission control long for the chance to explore \nand do so vicariously through their work. The actual explorers and \nfighters of the Convention are some of the toughest men and women \naround. They must be capable of surviving in environments inimical to \nhumanity, of adapting and working with incredible precision, since the \nslightest error could be fatal. Worse still, terrible things lurk beyond the \nDimensional Barrier, and it's the duty of the Void Engineers not only \nto seek out those other dimensions but to protect the Earth from the \nthings that would come back. For this reason, the Convention includes \nnot only the astronauts and technicians that so many associate with it, \nbut also land-based travelers, cartographers, communications engineers, \nvehicle mechanics, soldiers, physicists and propulsion scientists. \nDue to the irrepressible nature of the Engineers - \neveryone would \nbe in the field, all the time, if they could - \nrelations are relaxed; \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nprotocol is informal, except when on task in the field. There’s no room \nfor questioning hierarchy when a single slip can kill everyone, after all. \nInternally, low-ranking personnel are Cadets; they learn the ropes, help \nwith projections for future missions, study engineering and try to make \nthemselves useful while they absorb the knowledge they’ll need later. \nCadets graduate into Officers, who’re informally classed as Enforcers \n(who perform heavy combat and defense), Explorers (who head out to \nmake maps of new places), Investigators (who look into the scientific \nrepercussions of strange places) and Researchers (who develop new \ntechnology for travel). Those Engineers with a desire for greater \nresponsibility move up to the rank of Coordinators, who act as command \nstaff for entire mission teams, stations or ships. Above this is the “desk \njob” that all pilots dread, the DSEATC: Dimensional Science Evalmtion \nand Training Committee. Since extradimensional travel is the most \nhazardous of the Void Engineers’ jobs, only the most dedicated and \nexperienced Engineers have the authority to oversee who undertakes \nDimensional Science training and travel. \nThe Void Engineers have always had a spark of inspiration that \nsometimes seems lacking from other Conventions. Their maverick \nattitudes and drive to see new, wondrous things beyond human \nexplanation paint them as loose cannons, but also as visionaries. \nEngineers often see the other Conventions as overly concerned with \nhumanity - \nthere’s a whole cosmos out there, and it’s too damn big to \nstay focused on such a small subject! On the flip side, the other \nConventions argue that they must solve humanity’s problems before \nthe species is ready for the true jump into transplanetary (and \ntransdimensional) civilization. Void Engineers also have contact with \nextra-planetary entities, and sometimes this leaves them a little bit \nchanged, and usually not for the better. The rest of the Union keeps a \nclose eye on the Engineers to make sure that the Deviants beyond the \nBarrier don’t push the Engineers into wholesale uncontrollability. \nRoleplaying Hints: Void Engineers run the gamut from science- \noriented professor/ flight controller to heroic explorer/ captain. Most of \nthem radiate a raw, tireless stamina. It’s not enough to extrapolate; one \nmust see for oneself all the variety the world and the universe has to \noffer. Of course, it’s a dangerous world out there, so it’s up to the \nEngineers to be ready as the first line of defense, too. No nonsense, no \nmargin for error, but a whole lot of enthusiasm and attitude. \nSpecialty Sphere: Correspondence \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCommon Foci: Travel equipment, vehicles, space gear, measuring \ninstruments, specially made jumpsuits, maps, planetary charts and \nprograms, extrapolation models \nConvention Advantage: Hardened Travelers \nThe irrepressible urge to explore causes Void Engineers to develop \na strong survival instinct and a keen insight into their environment. \nEven those who stay behind often must react on a moment’s notice to \ncrisis situations, all the better to provide solutions to teams that could \notherwise be stranded in inaccessible, hostile areas. A Void Engineer \nhas two free Traits from the following list: Alertness, Athletics, Computer, \nInfluence: Trumportation, Science, Survival or Technology. The Void \nEngineer must take two separate Traits; both levels can’t be used in the \nsame one. \nAs the premier experts in Dimensional Science, all Void Engineers \ntreat the Dimensional Barrier (the Gauntlet) as two Traits lower for \nthemselves and their Effects. \nConvention Disadvantage: Space Case \nLong-term travel in strange conditions with highly technical \nequipment causes many Void Engineers to lose sight of what does and \ndoesn’t work quite right on Terra Firma. A Void Engineer in mundane \nsociety gains one Paradox for performing a coincidental Effect in front \nof Sleepers, although this penalty can’t accrue more than once per \nscene (all further coincidental Effects really are coincidental). This is \nbecause the Void Engineer uses Procedures or Apparatuses that are \nobviously strange, responds to information he couldn’t plausibly know, \nand otherwise exhibits mannerisms that clearly show to “normal \npeople” that the Technocrat is up to something weird. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n~ E T H B D ~ L G G I E S  \nBorder Corps Division - \nThe vaunted “space Marines’’ who \ndefend Earth against invaders from space or other dimensions. \nThese tough-as-nails troopers also defend ships and Constructs; \nin contrast to the usual stereotype of soldiers, they’re not only \nexcellent combatants, but also must be fully skilled in all the \ntechnologies necessary to survive in hostile turf. The Border \nCorps Division’s troops are well-trained crack survivors who can \nthink with the best of them and outfight the best, too. \nEarth Frontier Division - \nFrom the deep seas to the arctic \naches to the steaming jungles, the Earth Frontier Division \nexplorers continue the job of mapping out the most inaccessible \nregions of the world. They experiment with novelties such as \nunderwater habitations or long-range underground travel routes. \nNeutrulizution Specializution Corps -Some extradimensional \nentities seem to be beings of pure energy, yet they manifest and \nmolest humanity. The NSC specializes in wiping them out with \ncustommade tools and a good background in Dimensional Science. \nThe NSC also runs facilities for the treatment of \nunhinged by a close encounter of the spiritual kind. \nan-Dimensional Corps - \nThe vaunted extradimensiona \nrers of the Void Engineers sometimes run afoul of Horizon \nand Chantries of the Traditions, which they dutifully \nlater destruction. They also explore the reaches of the \nra where more sensible mages don’t travel, sometimes \nencountering Nephandi, Marauders or even more bizarre crea- \ntures. A rare few even explore time travel or the Digital Web. \nSpecialty Sphere: Dimensional Science. \nResearch B Execution-With \ngrants from the Syndicate and \naned tech from Iteration X, the R&E group (or “Q Divisio \nandles all the hardware that makes travel possible -constructi \nmaintenance of communications arrays, spacecraft and \nions, as well as new technologies for experimental travel and \n~€ICBRE \nCBN TKHNCECRATS \nThe preceding descriptions should give you the means to build \nTechnocracy Conventioneers, and the equivalent terms for their \nmagical capabilities. Their special character Traits, Backgrounds and \nAbilities are covered in Chapter Three; see Chapter Four for some \nsample Procedures and Devices. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe character creation rules in Laws of Ascension provide plenty \nof options for building Tradition mages. But what about Disparates? Or \nthe special Abilities ofTechnocrats? Wondering about how to translate \nsome additional Backgrounds? It's all here. This is the meat and bones \nfor your character systems: All of the Merits, Flaws, Backgrounds and \nAbilities from the Guide to the Traditions and Technocracy, plus the \nmaterial from Laws of the Ascension that didn't make it before. \nABILITIES \nThe additional Abilities here not only give your mages some variety \nto play around with, they also allow you to explore the expanded \ntraining available to Technocracy characters. You can use these Abilities \nlike any other Ability in your Laws of Ascension game, to perform \nspecialized tasks. Most of them have a special benefit as well. \nAbilities marked with \"(Traditions)\" are intended for mystically \noriented mages. Abilities marked with \"(Technocracy)\" assume that \nthe character has some level of training in Technocratic or \nTechnomagical procedures; a mage can't simply learn Energy Weapons \nwithout having some way to practice it! \nImportant Note: Giving all Abilities some special capability isn't \nnecessarily the best idea for all games. In many cases, the base Abilities \npresented in Laws of Ascension will more than cover the activities \nmages do, and any other Abilities added on could be considered Hobby/ \nProfessionallExpert Abilities. In such games, there's no need to complicate \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmatters by adding on yet more rules, and the Abilities below therefore \ndon't necessarily have to use all of the special benefits and challenges \npresented. \nActing \nAs a special form of Performance, you're particularly good at \npretending to be something that you aren't, or having some emotion \nthat you don't really feel. This is essential for a spy as well as for a stage \nperformer. You can use a Social Challenge to put on a convincing \ndisplay. Performance entertains; Acting allows you to convincingly \nportray a role and emotion (contrast a stand-up comic with a \nShakespearean actor). \nYou can also use Acting to block an Empathy challenge against you. \nBiotech (Technocracy) \nWhile Medicine handles all sorts of techniques from mundane \ntreatment to surgery, Biotech handles the organic machinery and \nhyperadvanced genetic projects of the Technocracy. Extraordinary \ncitizens sometimes master a little bit of this Ability, and most Progenitors \ndevelop some skill in Biotech along the course of their career. Biotech \ncovers the use of cloned organs, genetically engineered materials and all \nthe machines that make, store and use them. Essentially, it's like a \nhighly advanced version of Medicine, as far above Medicine as Medicine \nwould be beyond simple first aid. \nProgenitors use Biotech in conjunction with many specialty foci. \nBiotech is also necessary to understand and operate Technocratic \nbiological machinery and living Devices. \nConspiracy Theory \nSome would consider it a form of history or perhaps a type of \npolitics. You know better: Conspiracy Theory explains the way that the \nworld works, according to the hidden principles that They don't want \nyou to know. You know enough to know about it - \nthe question is, will \nyou survive once They know you know? \nUse Conspiracy Theory like aformoflme: Youcangather information \nabout the tangled webs of networks and possible connections between \nshadowy organizations. While Conspiracy Theory never offers solid, \nconcrete information, it can offer possibilities about who's behind a \nplot or why some groups are suddenly working together. As a rule of \nthumb, the more convoluted the plot, the more effective this Ability is \nat rooting it out. Conspiracy Theory doesn't necessarily grant knowledge \nof people's Reputation Traits (that's Politics); rather, it tells you about \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthe ones who don’t have a Rep because they want to remain hidden. \nThe exact knowledge implied by this Ability is best left to the Storyteller; \nit may not be useful or appropriate for all games. \nConstruct Politics (Technocracy) \nUnlike the politics of the Masses, the Technocratic Union relies on \nadvanced sociology. Management is more efficient, bureaucracy is less \nwasteful, and the politics are less dangerous. Usually. The downside of \nthis is that the structures often don’t make immediate sense to the \nuneducated. You’ve survived long enough to know your way around the \nConstructs, though, and you know who’s who. \nUse Construct Politics to unearth the Reputation of Technocrats \nwho’re attached to a Horizon Construct. Since the Horizon Constructs \nhave limited contact with Earth and often have their own (experimental) \nsocial structures, this Ability is invaluable for determining who’s really \nin charge and how to go about getting things done. Essentially, this is \na special form of Politics that works for Technocratic advanced \nbureaucracy in the same way that Hypertech compares to Technology or \nBiotech to Medicine. \nCovert Culture \nSpies, secret agencies and government ops are right up your alley. \nYou don’t waste your time on frivolous strange conspiracies or on the \nmundane aspects of police work. Rather, you concern yourself with the \nagencies that actually do things: Mossad, MI-6, the Readiness Agency \nand similar groups. And you know a lot about them. \nLike Conspiracy Theory, this is a specific form of h e .  In this case, \nthis is information regarding secret agencies, spies and (non- \nTechnocratic) government operatives. You should use Covert Culture \nto navigate such groups and to understand Influence: Espionage. You \nalso can probably look up information about the groups, what they do, \nwho works for them and what range of jurisdiction they have, given \nenough time. \nCryptography \nPublic encryption keys are quickly becoming a thing of the past. \nCiphers and substitution codes are laughable child’s play. Through \nintuition, pattern recognition and large number theory, you can crack \njust about any code known to man - \nand maybe a few that aren’t! \nUse Cryptography to try to decipher coded messages that your \nStoryteller introduces. Even if you can’t decipher it, you can usually tell \na coded message from random static and maybe tell what sort of code \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwas used (say, if you're picking up signals over a radio or computer). If \nyour Storyteller decides to give you cryptographical puzzles, you can \nexpend a Cryptogruphy Ability to gain one of two benefits (depending \non whether your Storyteller wants to stretch out the time to solve the \npuzzle): You can either gain more time to solve it, equal to the time you \nnormally would have (so three Cryptography Traits turn a one-minute \npuzzle into a four-minute one), or you can choose a letter and have all \ninstances of that letter revealed a la Wheel of Fortune. \nYou may need other Abilities for certain codes. For example, you \nmight recognize a fractal pattern as a code because of your Cryptography, \nbut without Science: Fractals you probably couldn't decipher it. Similarly, \nyou would recognize Navajo code-talking but couldn't understand it \nwithout appropriate Linguistics. \nEmpathy \nYou're sensitive to people's emotions. This can be an upside, when \nyou catch someone lying to you. It can also be a downer, when you find \nyourself sharing in the misery of one of your friends. Still, the ability to \nsee where someone's coming from helps you to win trust and also to \nfigure out the real motives behind the people you deal with. \nYou can use an Empathy challenge to determine the general \nemotional state of someone you're dealing with, if you can best the \ntarget in a Social Challenge. This might be agitated, angry, afraid, sad, \nmoody, withdrawn or any number of other things; this can sometimes \ngive you a clue to the subject's motives. \nEnergy Weapons (Technocracy) \nVoid Engineer space Marines and Iteration X grunts can't always \nrely onsimple projectile weapons. Guns don't fire inspace or underwater, \nand don't always have the power to take out threatening Deviants. \nFortunately for humanity, the Union has and uses various forms of \nEnergy Weapons: Lasers, plasma casters, shockers, particle beams and \nwhat- have-you. These weapons differ markedly from Firearms, and \nsomeone used to normal Firearms will find the advanced energy \ntechnology and the lack ofrecoil rather difficult to adjust to. Furthermore, \nEnergy Weapons Ability covers the maintenance and minor repair of \nsuch weapons. \nYoucanuseMentalChallenges to attackwithhnergy Weapons, just \nlike using Firearms with guns. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nNote that while the Technocracy most commonly uses Energy \nWeapons, some Technomancers (especially Sons of Ether) occasionally \nbuild various \"ray guns\" as well, and could use this Ability. \nHelmsman (Technocracy) \nIt's one thing to drive a car or pilot an airplane. It's another thing \nentirely to learn the three-dimensional tactics and incredibly complex \noperations necessary to pilot a Void Engineer spacecraft. This highly \nspecialized Ability covers just such an occasion. While you probably \nwon't spend a lot of time in spacecraft, getting from place to place can \nbe difficult if nobody knows how to start the engines. \nYou must have Helmsman Ability to operate a Void Engineer \nspacecraft; guesswork isn't enough. The Storyteller may impose various \nchallenges for piloting the craft through asteroids, into combat, landing \nand through other such hazards. \nSons of Ether can also use the Helmsman Ability with their \netherships. \nHigh Ritual (Traditions) \nYou're a master of pomp and circumstance. You know exactly \nwhere the candles go, how the invocation reads and which color of \ndrapes to use for the best effect. You can take into account Resonance, \nthe participants' personalities, your own knowledge and the limitations \nof your budget and still come up with a ritual that will not only succeed \nin amplifying your magic, but will look damn cool, too. \nPlay out your performance of High Ritual for a short time (assuming \nyou're in a private location). You can expend a High Ritual Ability \nthereafter as a downtime action to extend your rite into the realm of \nSuperhuman Ritual (see Laws of Ascension p. 140). Each level allows \nyou to tack on one more grade of casting time, and thus one more grade \nof success. Of course, once you're done, you likely collapse from \nexhaustion and sleep for about 16 hours. Alternatively, you can use your \nHigh Ritual to grant a single retest to one other participant who fails a \nchallenge when attempting to aid you in a cooperative rite. \nHypertech (Technocracy) \nThere's technology, and then there are toys. The Technocratic \nUnion has at its fingertips access to some of the most amazing devices \nnever seen by man. Of course, Enlightened Scientists can learn to use \nthese incredible Devices by rote, but you actually understand some of \nthe super-advanced abstractions of science that make them work. In \ntheory, anyway. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nApparatuses; otherwise, you’re limited to using the equipment that \nyour Convention supplies. With Hypertech you can puzzle out and \npossibly even repair damaged Technocratic equipment, subject to \nmaking a Mental Challenge (difficulty varies at the Storyteller’s \ndiscretion, but usually eight or more Traits). \nSometimes you need information. Sometimes the informant doesn’t \nwant to talk. If you don’t want to work over the target physically, this \nrequires a level of psychological finesse. You may not be a psychologist, \nbut you sure know how to read people. You can get them to talk, and \nmore importantly, you understand how to draw conclusions from what \nthey’re not saying. Given enough time, you can crack some of the \nhardiest minds, but that’s not even necessary - \nyou’re good enough \nthat you can get them to betray themselves without breaking them. \nUse Interrogation in a Social Challenge to gather information from \na subject. You can ask one yes/ no question up to 10 words in length. \nExpend an Interrogation Ability and make the challenge; if you win, the \nsubject must answer truthfully with “Yes,” “No,” or “I don’t know.” A \nquestion based on an assumption that’s partially false counts as false \n(and generates a “NO” answer). The subject can defend with Acting. \nUsing Interrogation in this fashion requires a full scene/ hour uninterrupted \nwith the subject and can’t be done under duress (that is, you can’t \nInterrogate someone if you’re both hanging from manacles in a prison or \nwhile you’re being shot at; you must be in asituationof clear superiority). \n’ \nJetpack (Technocracy) \nThe Masses already have jetpack technology, but it’s shaky, \nexpensive, unreliable and just not very good. Technocratic jetpacks, of \ncourse, are much, much better. You’re trained in the use of such \njetpacks. Thanks to widespread televising of early jetpack experiments, \nmost such jetpacks are now considered entirely coincidental and \naccepted by the Masses. \nUseJetpack as your piloting skill if you’re flying with a jetpack and \nin a dangerous situation, such as trying to pull up from the last minute \nto avoid a building, or flying between tight canyons at high speed. \nProper use of aJetpuck can give you great mobility advantages (see p. \nXX). Without this Ability, a character is limited to normal walking \nmovement with a jetpack. \nJury-Rig \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nbut \nit a \nYou may not know how things are put together or why they work, \nyou've got the knack of putting the right wires together and giving \nlittle duct tape to make things almost as good as new. Subject to \nhaving a few handy tools like a spool of metal wire and some chewing \ngum, you can often get one or two more uses out of the most crazily high- \ntech item. \nWhen an item's destroyed (reduced to zero Traits or health levels), \nyou canJury-Rig it to bring it back to minimal functionality. Expend a \nJury-Rig Ability and make a Mental Challenge with a difficulty of three \ntimes the object's normal Trait value - \nso an object that normally \nprovides one bonus Trait has a difficulty of three. If you succeed, the \nitem goes back up to one Trait. You can'tlury-rig something above one \nTrait, and the item breaks again immediately after you use it. You can \nrepeatedly Jury-Rig the same item, but the difficulty increases by one \nTrait each time. You canJury-rig just about anything that the Storyteller \nallows, subject to time and materials - \nsome duct tape might Jury-Rig \na knife back into functionality for one hit, but you probably couldn't \nJury-Rig a Void Engineer space cruiser that rammed an asteroid. \nLaw Enforcement \nTechnocratic agents in the field often have to work with police or \nlocal law agencies. Tradition mages often find themselves on the run \nfrom those same groups. In either case, a working knowledge of the \ngroup is more than helpful, it's practical survival. Police don't like \noutsiders taking their cases, after all, so knowing how to appease them \nhelps smooth along the transition. By the same token, if you know what \nthe police are going to do, you have a better chance of getting away. \nLaw Enforcement acts again as a special type of Lore much like \nCovert Culture. You know the patterns of local law enforcement, their \ntechniques, who'd be put on an investigation (a coroner, a detective or \nsome other specialist), and what sorts of paperwork they fill out. You \ndon't necessarily know specific people; that's the purview of Influence: \nPolice. You do, however, have a good idea of what the reaction will be \nif you perform a specific criminal act, or need to work with the police, \nsheriff or other duly appointed badge-wearing representative. \nMicrogravity Operations (Technocracy) \nThe Void Engineers naturally spend a lot of time in space, and \nsometimes they bring other Conventioneers with them for specialty \nmissions. You've been trained to handle the rigors of low gravity, and \ncan handle spacewalking, ship operations and lunar travel with a \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nof their umbilical tethers, you’re floating upside-down and backward, \ngetting a lovely view of the stars. \nNormally, when in microgravity (that is, on the moon, in space, on \na ship with no gravity and so on), characters can’t use Abilities at all. \nYou can use Abilities normally as long as you have at least one level of \nMicrogravity Operations. You never lose your bearings and become \nconfused by direction, nor do you suffer nausea due to microgravity \n(characters exposed to microgravity for the first time should make a \nStatic Physical Challenge, six Trait difficulty, or be subjected to vertigo \nand incapacitating nausea for a full conflict/ 10 minutes). You use \nMicrogravity Operations as your Ability to direct yourself in potentially \nhazardous free-fall situations, such as to slip out from between two slow- \nmoving but heavy objects that might crush you or to avoid coming loose \nfrom the ship’s hull and floating off into Jupiter. \nSons of Ether who spend a lot of time on etherships may also \ndevelop Microgravity Operations Ability. \nTalking to a lone individual is one thing. Reaching an entire \naudience is another. Preparing something to offend the least people and \nattract the most attention takes a lot of careful thought. Of course, \nsometimes you want to offend people in order to grab their attention. \nYou know all of this, and how to do it, and when, and why. When it \nabsolutely, positively has to have a sound bite, you’re the one to do it. \nYou know how to best place and use media coverage. In conjunction \nwith Influence: Media, this Ability allows you to make strong campaigns \nwith the connections you have. Normally, when you invoke Media \nInfluence, you kill a specific story, get an advance story or place a small \npublication. Using Media Ability in conjunction with your Influence, \nyou can block an effort to kill a story (if you spend as many Media Ability \nTraits as the opposing individual), or you can guarantee that it shows \nup on everyone’s doorstep (if you have at least one Media Ability left to \nuse after canceling attempts to kill the story, you should ask the \nStoryteller to make sure that your story appears in a hand-out with all \nof the character sheets at the beginning of the appropriate game \nThe trick lies in making both sides feel like they got a good deal. \nSoothe egoes, make compromises and come out on top - \nthat’s the \n. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ntrick of Negotiation. You can tell when to put on pressure, when to ease \noff, when to play things up and when to look like you’re on the losing \nend. Most importantly, this helps you in cross-dealings when you need \ntit-for-tat. \nYou canuseNegotiation in conjunction with your various Backgrounds \nthat normally gamer aid (but not information). Your Negotiation \nAbility allows you a retest on the use of such a Background. For instance, \nif your Mentor refuses to help you, you can use Negotiation for a retest to \nsee if you can convince her otherwise. \nNetworking \nIt’s all in who you know. You can make contacts on the fly, figure \nout the power structures and milk your information sources for all the \nright dirt. With a few hours and a bunch of phone calls, you can usually \ndig up a little information about - \nwell, just about anything. \nUse Networking Ability in lieu of an established information \nnetwork. If you don’t have Contacts or a similar Background, you can \nrely on Networking instead. Networking has several disadvantages by \ncomparison, though. It takes you a full scene/ hour to perform a use of \nNetworking. You only gain information to answer one question or \ninvestigate one rumor. You must still make a Social Challenge with a \ndifficulty determined by a Storyteller. Use of Networking does not \ngenerate a permanent social network; it just represents your ability to \npull together bits and pieces of information from a few contacts and \nsome hastily researched paperwork. Some information may be outside \nthe scope of Networking. On the flip side, Networking doesn’t count \nagainst your uses of Contacts, so you can potentially gain even more \ninformation if you spend enough time. \nNewspeak \nControl the language and you control the thoughts, Orwell asserted \n- \nand he was right. It’s a known fact that languages drift, but you’re \nplugged into the new jazz and spinning the verbage out faster than \nanyone candecrypt it. WithNewspeak, you turnwords toyour advantage \nand make them mean what you want them to mean, instead of feeling \nconstrained to formal, traditional vocabulary. \nYou can bum a Newspeak Ability to place a subtext into one \nsentence. Only other characters with Newspeak will gain this subtext. \nThe subtext can only be two words. This can be in any mode of \ncommunication: You could blather out a sentence in person, over a \nmegaphone, by computer, by Internet, written on paper - \nultimately, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nanyone who reads or hears it may gain the subtext, subject to having \nNewspeak Ability. Deciphering a subtext doesn’t cost a use of the \nAbility. \nPilot \nRotorhead, stick-jock, jetboy - \nyou’ve heard them all, and if it has \nwings (fixed or rotary) you’ve flown it. You’re familiar with how to \nhandle planes, helicopters and hovercraft. Anything that floats on air \nis your baby. \nUse Pilot in conjunction with dangerous maneuvers in a plane, jet, \nhelicopter or hovercraft. You can’t operate such a vehicle without the \nPilot Ability. \nPower-Brokering \nInstead of making connections and wheedling with random people, \nyou head straight for the top. By bullying your way past secretaries and \nslash-and-burning through red tape, you may not make friends, but you \ncan certainly get things done. Of course, if your interpersonal skills \naren’t up to par, you might get into position to talk to someone who’s \njust powerful enough to give you a swift kick to the head, but if you’re \nsuave enough, you can bring the real power players together. \nUnlike Negotiation, this Ability doesn’t represent interpersonal \ncommunication skills; unlike Networking, it’s highly targeted. You \nspecifically find the people who can get things done in an organization, \nand you bring them together to accomplish a task. When you invoke \nyour Power-Brokering Ability, you can combine your Influence, Contacts, \nAllies and similar aiding Backgrounds with other characters. Each level \nof Power-Brokering expended (to call up people and bum a few bridges) \nlets you bring one additional person’s Backgrounds into the group. You \ncan add these Backgrounds as noted in the optional rule for Stacking \nBackgrounds on p. XX at double efficiency: That is, a character with \none level of Contacts counts as having two levels for stacking purposes \nonly. \nPropaganda \nYou’ve run smear campaigns with the worst of them. You don’t just \nsell things to the public - \nyou get them to feel strongly about whatever \nyou tell them, and you make them believe it. \nBy using your Propaganda Ability between games (it remains \nexpended for the game in which it’s set to take effect), you can briefly \naugment or hamper someone’s Reputation Traits. Each expended \nPropaganda Ability allows the subject to recoup an expended Reputation \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTrait, so that although it doesn’t count as additional Traits, it’s useable \nmore than once because it refreshes immediately. Or, you can cause one \n(and only one) Negative Reputation Trait on a subject to count as two \nTraits. \nPsychology \nThe workings of the human mind are laid bare to you. Behavior \npatterns and defenses are all clear. Well, perhaps not clear -humans \nare unpredictable and Psychology isn’t an exact science. You do, though, \nhave a better idea than average of what motivates people and why they \ndo things. \nYou can use Psychology in conjunction with a Social Challenge to \ndiscern someone’s current Demeanor. Given a full hour of time to study \na subject, you can also use a Social Challenge to try to learn the subject’s \nNature, or to change the Demeanor for the next scene to a Demeanor \nof your choosing. \nRD Data (Technocracy) \nThe Technocratic Union keeps files on all sorts of Reality \nDeviants- \nextensive files. You’ve read some. Maybe you’ve even \nencountered some of those Deviants. Be that as it may, you know about \nsome of the dangers that humanity doesn’t. Sometimes it makes you \nwish that you were blissfully ignorant. \nRD Data is the Technocratic term for specific Lore regarding \nsupernatural creatures. It’s tightly controlled; the Union regards it as a \n“need-to-know” information resource. \nSecurity \nYou fiddle with traps, electronic locks, scanners, motion sensors. In \naddition to knowing how to operate them, you know how to beat them. \nWhether it’s with simple lockpicks or sophisticated electronic bypasses, \nodds are you can figure out a way around the system - \nor find a way to \nclose an existing loophole. \nUse your Security Ability to make challenges to set up or penetrate \nexisting Security operations. For instance, you would use Security to set \nup a network of cameras in a building, with your Mental Traits as the \ndifficulty that someone else would have to use Security to find a way to \nbypass it. Security with a Dexterity-related Physical Trait could pick a \nphysical lock. You can also use Security to examine blueprints and look \nfor holes in a building’s security. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nYou've studied the myriad layers of quantum uncertainty and \nuniversal shear. Using string resonances and other obscure theories, \nIn game terms, this Ability works like Cosmology for Technocrats. \nInstead of granting knowledge of spirits and secret Umbral realms, it \ncovers in detail areas that Technocrats frequent: Horizon Constructs, \nmachine realms, parallel worlds and other \"scientific\" dimensions. \nThere's an art to fostering absolute, sheer, abject, mind-numbing \nterror. Sometimes it involves bombs and demonstrations. Other times, \nit's all about the subtlety of things that prey on the weak mind. From \nbomb-slinging to psychological warfare, you've practiced them all. To \nthe wrong people, you are a monster. \nThe Terrorism Ability gives you specific knowledge of terrorist \norganizations and techniques, much like a Lore Ability. No specific \nmechanic or challenge applies; rather, you can gather information \nabout what techniques would be effective in a given situation, what \ngroup might have something to gain from a specific action, or who's \nfaking a terrorist attack in order to draw attention off. \nFirst they beg. Then they scream. Then they bleed. \nYou understand how to drag out pain and punishment. Whether as \nknow the most effective ways to injure without killing, to keep someone \nalive through mutilation and to keep someone conscious for the whole \nprocedure. You know how to take advantage of specific fears and how \nto stimulate suffering that your victims wouldn't believe possible. \nto try to deliver agony without causing fatal damage. If you win, your \n\"tender ministrations\" cause the subject to lose a Willpower Trait \ninstead of a health level. If you desire, after stripping all temporary \nWillpower Traits, you can even cause the victim to lose permanent \nWillpower with further applications. A subject reduced to zero \npermanent Willpower is little more than an utterly insane, vegetative \nI : \nI . \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nlump (apply the derangement: Catatonia). Applying torture requires \nspecial equipment and can’t be done in a hurry. Given enough time, \nthough, you will either break or kill the subject. \nNaturally, making someone lose permanent Willpower is pretty \nnasty, but if you’ve already got the subject in that position, you could \nhave presumably killed him anyway, so.. . . \nVice \nThere’s an entire subculture to the criminal underworld, one that’s \nnot open to people who don’t know the lingo. This isn’t the penny-ante \ntrade of the street hustlers and the signs of the gang-bangers, either. It’s \nalso in the high-class prostitutes, the secret gambling dens and the posh \nparties where stars come to get strung out of their minds. \nYour Vice Ability works in a fashion similar to Streetwise, allowing \nyou to make specific contacts and avoid trouble. Where Streetwise works \nwith street culture, gangs and thugs, though, Vice deals specifically in \nthe seedy elements that cater to illegal pleasures. You can find opium \ndens, strip joints that house prostitution, adult film stores that make \ntheir own porn in the back, and nastier, scarier things. Your Vice Ability \ncan help you to navigate these places safely without seeming like a narc \nor becoming caught up in someone else’s schemes. \nBACKGR~UNDS \nThe additional Backgrounds presented here, like the Abilities \npresented previously, are sometimes marked (Technocracy) or \n(Traditions). Again, these delineate Backgrounds that are specifically \nappropriate to the group in question. \nBackup (Technocracy) \nDue to your rank in the Union, you have the ability to call up some \nadditional muscle when the situation warrants it. This isn’t exactly \nskilled muscle (they’re not Allies), but rather a pool of faceless minions \nfrom the Union’s rank-and-file proles - \ner, citizens. \nBackup can be very hard to portray in a live-action game, because \nyou’ll typically need other people in order to represent the Backup that \nshows up. You can handle this in one of several ways. First, you can \nsimply decide that Backup is too egregious and not allow it. Second, you \ncan hold some Narrators in reserve, or use the recommended system of \nhaving some players take a little time each game to play Narrator \ncharacters, in order to represent Backup. Third, you can simply issue \ncards for Backup, which must be prominently displayed. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nBackup typically takes a scene to arrive. Each level of Backup grants \none additional warm body with normal human Attributes (you decide \nthe character's strength in Mental, Physical or Social). You might suffer \nsome repercussions if your Backup dies, but in general these are people \nexpected to work in a dangerous job and to serve in the line of duty. \nWhen multiple characters get together they sometimes \nfor large and impressive actions. For instance, several mag \nResources x3 might go in together to purchase an expensive \ndditional levels remain. \nthing with the equivalent of Resources x4, he'd need \nthree) or two other people with Resources x3, or s \nombination that added up to six levels. \nThe Chancrj Background provides a special exception to th \nthan his total Attribute Traits. Donated Influence co \nthis limit, making it very difficult to coordinate large-sca \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nADVERSARIAL \nBACKGRWNDS \nThe Guide to the Traditions presents a sort of “negative \nBackground,” the adversarial Background. While this could be \nadapted into live-action play, it’s a difficult proposition to do so. \nIn a tabletop game, the Storyteller always has control of the story \nto consideration. In a live-action game, a single character’s \nindrance won’t always come‘to the fore like this, especially if \ne Traditions should suffice. \nBlessing (Traditions) \nYou’ve got it - \nsome natural, inherent magical quality. It’s not an \nitem you carry or apower from a familiar; it’s just something in you. You \nmight’ve been born with it, or maybe you gained a Blessing from a spirit \nor demon. \nA Blessing functions just like a power in a Wonder, except that it’s \npart of you. It has a cost equal to the level of Spheres required to make \nit work, doubled if it’s always on. Subject to your Storyteller’s approval, \nthis could allow you to heal quickly, have a permanent supernatural \nsense, or just make you always manage to get a date when you go \nclubbing. \nCult (Traditions) \nYou have a group of people who support your magic and believe in \nits power. While they don’t provide specific additional help - \nthey’re \nnot competent to do special jobs, nor do they have access to unusual \ninformation - \nthey are good for one thing: When you get them all \ntogether, they can help in the casting of ritual magic. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nBackground. If you have access to your Cult, you can expend its levels \nfor the session to treat this as gaining additional Sleeper helpers in a \nritual (see p. 138 of Laws of Ascension). You don't have to use them \nall at once, or all in the same ritual. Remember, your Cult can desert you \nif you don't keep them motivated, and they can be hunted down, jailed \nor disbanded by your enemies if you don't protect them. \nChantry/ Construct \nYou're part of a group that holds territory in a place designed \nspecifically for study and improvement. Your turf might have a Library, \na resident Mentor, a small Sanctum for your style of magic or any number \nof other benefits. By sharing it with your friends, you all contribute and \nmake the place better. It could be as simple as a small coffee shop that \nyou all jointly own or as magnificent as a restored turn-of-the-century \nAll of the mages in a given C h n q  may contribute Background \nlevels to it. Every two levels in the Chanq gives it one shared level of \none of the following: Arcane, Destiny, Library, Wonder, Sanctum, \nMentor, Allies, Retainers, Cult, Influence, Fame or aReputationTrait. In \nthis case, the Chntry itself hosts these benefits, but any contributing \nmember (that is, a character with levels spent into it) may call upon \nthese benefits. This allows the Chuntry to collectively give the characters \naccess to many more Backgrounds than they would have on their own. \nNote also that a C h n q  isn't always supported completely by the \ncharacters; a bunch of poor characters in a wealthy Chantry are probably \nmembers alongside a wealthy mage who subsidizes it. \nThe C h n q ' s  furnishings come out of its Background level. A \nChntry with no Resources is little more than a ramshackle hut in some \nout-of-the-way park corner. A C h n q  without a Node has no Horizon \nRealm. \nDemesne (Traditions) \nYou have a stretch of dream-territory with which you're familiar. \nWhenever you sleep, you go there, and sometimes you can even control \nor shape it. The Dream Realm that you command is fluid and malleable \nto your will, and with the right magic you can even trap other dreamers \nthere and subject them to your powers, or use it as a jumping-off point \nto enter the Umbra through dreams. \nYour Demesne represents the area and control you have over a \ndream-realm that you visit whenever you dream. With Mindmagic, you \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncan pull other people into that realm; with Spirit, you can use it as a \njump-off point. Your Dream Realm typically has an area of effect based \non the grades of success for area, with your number of levels as the \ngrades. Thus, a one-Trait Demesne is a single room, but a five-Trait \nDemesne stretches across an entire Dream continent. You can also add \nyour Demesne Traits to all challenge resolution against other dreamers \nwho enter your Dream Realm. Within your Demesne, the reality bends \nto your will, but if you're not careful, it is possible to spawn elements that \ncan harm you as well. In all other ways the Dreamscape is essentially \nsimilar to a Mindscape (see Laws of Ascension p. 176). \nEnhancement \nDue to genetic engineering, grafts or bionic implants, you've been \nmade.. . more than human. Or perhaps just different. \nYou can choose to be cybernetically or biologically enhanced - \none or the other. A cyborg has bionic implants that provide weaponry, \narmor, replacements to organs and other such useful gadgetry. A \ngenegineered human typically has superior physiological capabilities, \noften with enhanced mental ability as well. \nCyborg: Your cybernetic enhancements cause Paradox because \nthey're not yet accepted in the Consensus. Eachlevel of the Background \ngrants one permanent Paradox Trait that counts for backlashes but \nnever goes away. Each level allows you to purchase one additional \nAttribute Trait (which can take you above your normal maximum) or \ntwo Traits of implanted Devices. Naturally, you're still limited to Devices \nthat can fit in your body, and no Devices above five Traits. Thus, you can \nhave implanted armor or a plasma cannon, but not a car. \nBiomod: Your biological modifications cause physiological disorders. \nChoose one Negative Trait for every level you take in the Enhancement, \nor one Derangement for every two levels. You gain one additional \nAttribute Trait (above normal human maximums) or two Traits of \nbiological modifications. \nFamiliar/ Companion \nWhether it's a traditional black cat, a ferret, a favored horse or even \na tiny dragonet, you have some sort of bonded companion that shares \na link with your very spirit. You may or may not realize the depth of this \nlink (Technocrats often think their Companions are simply very clever \npets), but you can gain many benefits from your Familiar's presence. \nYou spend levels from your Familiar Background, when you choose \nit, to gain certain benefits for your Familiar. The Familiar is essentially \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\na small physical creature invested with a spirit that has become bound \nto you. \nA Familiar automatically serves as an arcane connection for you. \nThus, you can affect with magic anything your Familiar touches, but the \nreverse is also true. The Familiar serves as part of a pact (perhaps \nunspoken) that requires your attention and perhaps some effort on your \npart; you can take elements of this pact as Flaws to reduce the cost of the \nFamiliar (for instance, if your Familiar requires you to compose eccentric \npoetry to it and read it aloud at cabal meetings, this is probably an \nobnoxious one- or two-Trait Flaw). Your Familiar can take on your own \nParadox and suffer the backlash from it, although this typically requires \nsome level of incentive. Finally, a Familiar requires a supply of Quintes- \nsence; generally this is one Quintessence Trait per week per level of the \nFamiliar, or else it fades away, loses its powers or otherwise becomes inert \nuntil fed. \nFor one Trait, the Familiar can talk; for two Traits, it can \ncommunicate with telepathy with anyone in sensory range, regardless \nof language. \nThe Familiar can have countermagic Traits equal to the Traits you \nplace into that capability, and you gain this while you are physically in \ncontact with the Familiar. \nYou can grant the Familiar special Lore on a one-Trait-for-one- \nLore-level basis. \nYour Familiar can nullify one Trait of Paradox per game session per \nTrait spent on Paradox nullification. \nFor one Trait, your Familiar can be an unusual form of an otherwise \nnatural creature, like a dog with a prehensile tail. For two Traits, it can \nbe clearly unnatural, such as a multicolored, six-legged frog. \nFor one Trait, your Familiar can have two extra health levels or two \nextra Physical Traits. \nFor one Trait, your Familiar can be larger than cat-sized, up to horse- \nsized. \nLegend (Traditions) \nYou are literally a living legend. You’re the reincarnation of some \nlegendary ideal; when you live up to that ideal, you generate energy like \na Node. Quintessence gathers from the strength of the Consensus and \npeople’s belief in the Legend. \nChoose a specific Legend associated with your character. You might \nbe a reincarnation of Jack the Ripper, or the home of all the legends \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nassociated with Achilles. When you behave according to your Legend, \nyou generate Quintessence just like a Node. Someone else can tap this \nQuintessence by participating in your Legend. For instance, if you are a \nLegend of Jack the Ripper, you gain Quintessence by stalking and trying \nto kill prostitutes; the victim in question can gain Quintessence (if she \nsurvives) by playing out that role. If you are a Legend of Achilles, you \nwould gain Quintessence for going on a mad rampage through an enemy \nfortification, especially if the enemies just defeated one of your friends. \nTreat Quintessence generated in this fashion (including limits per \nsession) the same as you would a No&. \nPast Lives (Traditions) \nAncient days and half-remembered events flash before your eyes. \nYour Avatar carries memories, and sometimes they open up and reveal \nto you the lives that the Avatar has guided before. While this can be \ndisconcerting, it can also be very helpful when you need to draw out \nspecific knowledge of the past. \nSpend a turn in concentration of your Past Life to bring forth images \nfrom it, then make a Simple Test. If you win or tie, you can expend a \nPast Life level to gain a level in one Ability appropriate to the life (for \ninstance, you couldn't gain Microgravity Operations from a Past Life in \nHan Dynasty China). You can spend multiple levels of Past Life but \nmust make a Simple Test for each. On a failure, you spend the Trait, but \ngain no benefit this time. \nRequisitions (Technocracy) \nA typical Technocrat can't afford energy weapons and hyperdense \nbody armor - \nnot to mention rooms full of surveillance equipment and \nspaceships. That's what Requisitions are for: An agent doesn't have to \nown these things. The Technocracy does, and it provides when necessary. \nIf you fill out the right paperwork - and your bosses think it's \nworthwhile - \nyou can get your hands on special gear for your missions. \nWhen you invoke Requisitions, you can access special Technocracy \nequipment that's not normally available. Each level of Requisitions \ncounts as two levels of Influence or Resources to gamer a specific item. \nYou must make a Simple Test (win or tie). If you lose, your request isn't \ngranted in time, or the items aren't available, or for whatever reason you \njust don't get the goods. You may test separately for each item, though. \nSanctum/ Laboratory \nOver time, a mage's influence can bend and warp the Tapestry in \na specific place. That place becomes attuned to the mage and familiar \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwith his magic. You have just such a place: a Sanctum. A Sanctum offers \na hiding ground and, more importantly, a safe haven for magic. Within \na Sanctum, all rules of magic are those of the owner. Your Sanctum \nfollows your paradigm; your magic is coincidental there, while other \nmagic is vulgar. Your years of work - \noften a decade or more in one \nplace - \nhave made it your mystical home. \nA Sanctum is attuned to you and only you. Unless someone has a \nremarkably similar paradigm (perhaps an apprentice), the Sanctum \nwon't work for the individual. In rare cases, old Chanties sometimes \nhave small Sancta that act with a paradigm broad enough to encompass \nan entire Tradition's practices, and to work for any member of that \nTradition. (Such Sanctu are part of a Chncty package and not available \nto individual characters except through development in play). \nYour magic is completely coincidental in a Sanctum. This trumps \nany other consideration: You can heal vulgar wounds, create elements, \nenchant weapons - \nanything you desire. You must still make all of the \nnormal challenges and pay the normal costs. Magic that you send \noutside of your Sanctum, such as a ranged attack or enchanted item, is \nsubject to Unbelief; the Paradox that you would normally gamer from \nsuch an Effect applies to the Effect instead of you, and probably weakens \nor warps it. Thus, you can't easily send screaming bolts of death halfway \nacross the world to coincidentally kill your foe, but you can repair your \ndamaged foci, heal yourself and conjure a few spirits for advice. \nThe size of your Sanctum depends upon the level of the Background: \nOne Trait - \nA circle, one pace across \nTwo Traits - \nA small room, five paces \nThree Traits - \nA workshop, 10 paces \nFour Traits - \nA house, 30 paces \nFive Traits - \nA manor, one hundred paces \nSecret Weapons (Technocracy) \nQ Division fills out the forms and hands you special Devices that're \nstill on the drawing board. Instead of using the usual goods, you get to \ntry out the new stuff. Sure, sometimes it's buggy as hell, but it's also stuff \nthat nobody else will even see for a year. \nYou can use your Secret Weapons Background like Requisitions, \nexcept that it allows access specifically to Devices. In concert with your \nStoryteller, you can design special new Devices according to the usual \nrules for Wonders. Subject to this approval, you can then try out the \nDevice. As with Requisitions, each level of Secret Weapons counts as two \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nlevels for the Device. In this case, though, the Device is untested; the \nStoryteller will always assign it some secret Flaw or Flaws equal to half \nits total value. You only get to use the Device for one session. (You also \nneed to fill out paperwork about how it worked - \nor didn't - \nafterward, but that's a job for downtime.) \nSpies (Technocracy) \nYou have a network of informants who watch your enemies' every \nmoves. Just a couple calls and you can have your men keeping watch for \nspecific actions or people, and returning to you with information about \nwhat's going on. \nYou use Spies in your downtime. Allocate your Spies to different \ncharacters (player or Narrator). EachSpy returns to you at the beginning \nof the next session with information about what the individual is doing \nwith one Background. For instance, if you send two Spies after your \nnemesis who's using his Influence: Health and his Contacts, your Spies \nwill come back and tell you that he's doing so, and what he's asked them \nto do. \nNote that your Spies can be detected with other Spies, or by properly \ndirected use of other Backgrounds. \nThese rules only work if you want a crop of diverse mages at the risk of \nhuving some overused or abusive powers that you may not foresee. \nSome heroic (or even otherwise mundane) individuals possess \ncapabilities beyond the norm - \ntwists of fate, chance knacks or \nadvantages beyond usual skill and talent. Others have, like the Greek \nheroes, tragic flaws of character that impede or harm. These are Merits \nand Flaws. \nYou must have Storyteller permission to take Merits and Flaws. \nA Merit is a special boon or benefit. It has a cost in Traits and is \ntypically purchased with Free Traits equal to this cost. AFlaw, conversely, \nis a special problem. Taking a Flaw gives you a number of extra Free \nTraits equal to its rating. You can't take more than five Traits of Flaws \nnormally, though you can take any two Flaws of any value (so you could \nbe both blind and paraplegic, but we don't recommend it, and you \ncouldn't have a'whole host of problems all at once). \nIn some cases you may gain a new Flaw in the course of play. You \ngenerally don't gain points for this. You might be able to gain a Merit \n(at an Experience Trait cost of twice the Merit's rating), but this is \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nunusual and should be specially worked into the story; generally, you \neither have a Merit or you don't. \nPHYSICAL r k U T S A N D  FLAWS \nACUTE SENSE (I CBR 3 TRAIT \n~IIERITI \nYou have a naturally sharp sense, be it sight, hearing or whatnot. \nFor one trait you have a one-Trait resolution bonus on all challenges \ninvolving that sense. For three Traits, you gain this bonus with all \nsenses. \nA~I-IBIDEXTRCBUS \n(I TRAIT \n~\n~\nm\n)\n \nYou can use both hands with equal facility. You suffer no Trait \npenalty when using an \"off hand,\" because you don't have an off hand. \nIf you use both hands at once, you still suffer a coordination penalty, as \ndescribed on p. XX. \nCATLIKE \nBALANCE \n(I TRAIT \n~TIERITI \nBalance comes naturally to you - \nyou almost never slip or fall.

While under the effects of your substance of \nchoice you typically suffer from an additional Negative Trait; perhaps \nImpatient for amphetamines or Obnom’ous for alcohol. If you can’t get \nyour fix, you will likely become sick and/ or violent, with results up to \nthe Storyteller (but usually at least a two-Trait resolution penalty on \nchallenges). \nDETWE SENSE \n(I TRAIT FLAW) \nOne of your senses from abnormally poor functionality. In all \nchallenges involving that sense, you suffer a two-Trait resolution \npenalty. You can temporarily overcome this with certain magics, but \nyou cannot permanently repair this without permanent changes to your \nPattern (i.e., spending experience and casting a powerful ritual). \nObviously, you cannot take this in conjunction with an Acute Sense of \nthe same type. \nThis problem may be correctable (wearing glasses, for instance), \nbut the problem should be apparent if the correction factor is ever lost, \ndamaged or removed. You can lose your hearing aid, for instance, or \nyour enemy might break your glasses. \nSHCBRT \n(I T m  FLAW) \nWear a tag to note that your character is actually less than four and \na half feet tall. You have trouble reaching countertops, doorknobs and \nsimilar height-based objects. You can only move two steps in each turn, \ninstead of three. \nDISFIGUMD \n(2 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nSome hideous disfigurement, scar or defect makes you look \nfrightening. You suffer a two-Trait penalty on all Social Challenges not \nrelated to intimidation, and you cannot take any Appearance-related \nSocial Traits. \n@NE ~ R / & E  (2 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nDue to injury or defect, you lack an ear or eye. (Wear a tag or patch \nto indicate this.) You suffer a two-Trait resolution penalty on tests of \nthe appropriate sense, just like someone with a Defective Sense. \nAdditionally, if you are missing an eye, you suffer anadditional one-Trait \npenalty on ranged challenges, while missing an ear causes an additional \none-Trait penalty on sound location. \nPRUTJAL \nUIAKS (2 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nPotent mystical traits manifest in your physical appearance. You \nmay have the features of a legendary Norse god, the look of a famous \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nfamily of reputed magicians, animallike characteristics or the mark of \nsupernatural creatures (based on folklore and myth). These marks make \nyou stand out to anyone with Occult Ability, who may recognize them. \nYou almost certainly inherit a moniker to go with your traits: Your \nfriends may call you “Badger” because you look like one, or “Thor” if \nyou’re tall and Nordic, or just refer to you as “that witchy woman.” \nIf your inherited marks carry some sort of disfiguration, you have \nthat as well, though you do get the Traits for it (for instance, if you seem \nto be a reincarnation of the god Hephaestus, you are automatically \nLame in one leg but you get the Traits for it). Other than that, you’re \nsimply noticeable for your traits. Witch-hunters may recognize them, or \nother people may associate them with undesirable legends - \nif you \nresemble someone from the Bathory family, for instance, they’ll \nremember tales of that ancestress who bathed in blood; if you look like \na wolf, they may assume that you’re dangerous, and so on. \nBAD SIGHT \n(3 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nYou have a noncorrectable vision problem like astigmatism or severe \ncataracts. You suffer a two-Trait resolution penalty on all vision rolls, \nbut you can only ever overcome this with extensive Life magic (i.e., \nspending experience and a long, probably painful, ritual). \nDmmm (3 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nA club foot, hunchback or similar problem cripples you. The \nspecific deformity typically causes you three Traits’ worth of problems. \nYou might have a two-Trait penalty on movement and a one-Trait \npenalty on Social Challenges with a hunchback, for instance, or you \ncould be completely unable to run if you have a badly malformed leg. \nThe exact nature of these Traits is up to the Storyteller. You must wear \na tag indicating your deformity and its Trait penalties unless you \nsomehow conceal it magically. As with other biological problems, \nextensive Life magic might cure this, but only with lots of experience \nand time. \nDKENERATICBN \n(3,6 \nCBR 9 TRAIT \nRAW) \nWithout some sort of supernatural or super-scientific help, you will \ndie. You could be necrotically falling apart, or perhaps you’re an \nanimated construct that needs magical energy to survive, or maybe you \nhave a terminal disease. \nFor two Traits, you do not naturally heal from any wounds. This \napplies to all of the higher levels, as well. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nFor six Traits, you suffer wounds at the reverse of the healing chart: \nthe amount of time it would take to heal the Mmtally Wounded level is \nthe amount of time it takes for you to suffer one level of damage, and you \nprogress up the chart backward as you continue to take damage. \nFor nine Traits, you take damage as before, but it’s aggravated. \nNote that without a regular source of magical healing, your character \nis pretty much doomed. Good luck. \nDI~INISHED \nA’ITRIBUTES \n(VARIABLE \nFLAW) \nWhen everyone else got the good stuff growing up, you got the \ncrappy end: You’re living proof that you can be dumb, weak and ugly. \nYou have fewer Attribute Traits than normal. For every two Traits that \nyou don’t take from your normal starting allotment, you gain back one \nfree Trait. You still must have at least one Trait in each category, \nthough. This doesn’t prevent you from buying more Traits, later, nor \ndoes it affect your Trait maximums. \nLUI-IE \n(3 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nYou have a badly injured or misshapen leg or legs. Use something \nto show this Flaw - \na cane, leg braces or the like. You should take the \nNegative Physical Trait Lame as well (though you gain Traits for it). \nYou cannot run and you can only take one step per action. \n~QNSTRQUS (3 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nYou have a thoroughly hideous visage -perhaps covered completely \nin scars, wracked by Paradox or whatever. You may not take Appearance- \nrelated Social Traits. You cannot initiate any Social Challenges, except \nthose relating to intimidation, while your true form is apparent. Yes, \nthis includes empathic senses with Mind magic - \nnobody feels normal \naround you! \nPEIUTIANENT \nWWND \n(3 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nLike the proverbial wound in the side, you have some injury that \nnever properly heals. This could be stigmata, a Paradox injury or some \nsort of permanent Pattern damage. At sunrise or sunset of each day \n(your choice, though once chosen it’s set), you drop to the Wounded \nhealth level with lethal damage, if you aren’t already there or worse. \nSLQW HEALING (3 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nYou heal all injuries at half speed -double \nthe healing times on the \nchart on p. 192 ofLaws of Ascension. All healing magic heals only half \ndamage to you (round down). \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDEAF \n(4 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nAs you cannot hear at all, you cannot understand spoken language \n(unless you take Linguistics: Lip Reading), and you certainly can’t hear \npeople sneaking up on you. You suffer a three-Trait resolution penalty \nto challenges of alertness and sensitivity to your surroundings. Anyone \nwho approaches you from outside your line of sight automatically \nsurprises you. \nUIUTE \n(4 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nTalk about a pain for any mage who relies on language. You may not \nspeak in character, at all, nor may you break character to explain your \nmotives to anyone but a Storyteller. You can use Linguistics: Sign \nLanguage, though of course this does you no good if you don’t have the \nAbility or you don’t know anyone else with it. \nAGING \n(S TRAIT \nFLAW) \nYou’re just not a teenager anymore. For each decade over the 40- \nyear mark, you take the Flaw once and you lose one from both your \nstarting and maximum Physical Trait total. You may also take this if \nyou’re underage: Once at 11-14, twice at 7-10 and up to three times for \n4-6, with the same penalties (though you must buy off the Flaw with \nexperience as you age, in the latter case). You must also take the Child \nFlaw if you’re “underage.” Obviously, you’ll need makeup or a special \ntag to indicate your apparent age. \n~TIAYRY \nCURSE \n(S CBR I 8  TRAIT \nFLAW) \nYou age at an accelerated rate - \nand death comes soon. For five \nTraits, you age one physical year for every two real months. For 10 \nTraits, you age one physical year every single real week! You may take \nthis Flaw in conjunction with Agzng (above), based on your physical \nage, to represent decrepitude that has already caught up with you. You \ncannot take this Flaw if your chronicle won’t outlast your projected \nlifespan, though (generally, it’s only appropriate for long-term games). \nYou can’t see, and you automatically lose all challenges that rely on \nsight. On a test where sight can help but isn’t strictly necessary (like \nfinding a door by touch), you lose on ties. Wear a special tag or dark \nglasses to indicate your condition. \nBLIND (6 TRAIT FLAW) \nPARAPLEGIC \n(6 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nConfined to a wheelchair, bed or crutches, you can’t move at all \nwithout extreme effort. You can only move one step per action, and \ndoing so is very painful - \ntake one level of bashing damage from \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nexhaustion each time you move this fast. Anyone who relies on \nmaneuverability (striking with a sword, kicking you or just running \naway) automatically bests you on all ties. \nSKIAL, mERITSAND 'FLAWS \nTRUE \n~\nV\nE\n \n[4 TRAIT \n~ E I U T )  \nYou have found (and possibly lost) a True Love. This love buoys you \neven in the worst of times and gives you strength to continue against all \nodds. You gain one True Love Trait, which you may use each game \nsession just like a Willpower Trait. (This Trait cannot be saved up from \ngame to game.) Of course, your True Love may require rescuing, or \nperhaps you have to quest to find him, her or it. \nCHILD \n(I TCB 3 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nThe Awakening can strike nearly anyone - \nin your case, it struck \nduring early life. Very early. You're a young child, with all of the \nattendant problems: Small size, inability to get into certain places, \nnever taken seriously by adults and so on. You gain one Trait if you're \n11-14, two if you're 7-10 and three if you're 4-6. See also &ng if your \nchild isn't very physically adept or precocious. \nPlaying an Awakened child isn't an excuse to carry a teddybear, act \ncute and derelict yourself of responsibility. You're a child thrust into the \nmiddle of a war for belief, subjected to supernatural enemies that don't \ncare about your age and at risk of blowing your mind due to magical \nstresses before you ever even have a life. This isn't funny or cute; it's a \nchild thrown into a situation of horror. \nDARK \nSECRET [I TRAIT \nFLAW) \nSomething terrible from your past haunts you and surfaces from \ntime to time to make you miserable. You might have done something \nvery naughty or perhaps you have a discredited past. Either way, you'll \nsuffer significant social consequences (like ostracism, hatred or being \nhunted by new enemies) if your secret comes out. Perhaps you were \ntaught by a mage who was later learned to be a Nephandus, or maybe \nyou participated indirectly in the Gilgul of an innocent. Your secret \ncould come up at any time and the Storyteller will be sure that it haunts \nyou. If it gets out, you'll either gain an immediate Negative Trait \n(Untrustworthy is a good one) or lose a Trait of Reputation - \nand you \nmay suffer other in-game repercussions. \nI IS TAKEN IDENTITY [I TRAIT \nFLAW) \nYou're not a reincarnated god, an Oracle descended from the \nUmbra, a miracle-worker or prophesied hero - \nbut you sure look the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\npart. People may automatically assume that you have some capabilities \nor significance beyond your actual abilities, or may even think that \nyou're someone you aren't. You should wear a tag that indicates the \nindividual you resemble. This could be troublesome if your look-alike \nis particularly well-known or infamous for some notorious deeds. \nSHY (I TRAIT FLAW) \nLarge groups of people make you uncomfortable. It's not that you \ndon't get along with people; rather, crowds just cause you to become \nnervous. You suffer a two-Trait resolution penalty on social interaction \nwith groups of three or more people; this goes up to three Traits for \ncrowds of 10 or more. \nWRCH-HUNTED \n(4 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nSome hunter is out to get you, whether for religious reasons, for \nsome perceived injustice, as a member of a secret cabal or just plain due \nto craziness. However, this hunter knows about your magics and has \nsome idea of your capabilities. The hunter won't rest and takes steps to \nprepare for and counter your skills, and tends to show up at the most \ninconvenient times. Worse still, since the hunter keeps an eye on you, \nyour friends and allies might be in danger as well if they're seen \nassociating with you. Even if you defeat or convert the hunter, another \nwill take up the crusade unless you buy off the Flaw. The Storyteller \nmakes up this hunter and has a Narrator play the role anytime the \nhunter comes into play. \nPRGBATICBNARY \n~ ~ T I B E R ( ~  \nTRAIT \nFLAW) \nPerhaps you defected from the Technocracy, or maybe you split \nfrom a Craft, studied early on under an Orphan or switched Traditions \nwith some bad blood left behind. Your current Tradition doesn't trust \nyou, and your old group remembers you none too fondly. Although you \nmay have Reputation and a powerful Destiny, nobody trusts you and \nnobody wants to risk you turning coat again to become a new enemy. \nThus, you're treated by everyone above you as if you had only one \nReputation. \n ENTAL r€I~wrs \nAND 'FLAWS \n&ILITY&T~UDE \n(I TRAIT \n~ ~ R I T )  \nYou have a natural aptitude for some Ability that goes beyond \nsimple proficiency. With one non-combat capability (such as Computer \nor Drive) you gain a two-Trait resolution bonus. This can't apply to a \ncombat skill or an exotic/esoteric Ability like Firearms or Vampire Lore. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nC~I-TXTBN SENSE \n(I TRAIT \n~T~NT) \nSimple wisdom just comes naturally to you. When you’re in a bind, \nyou can think of any number of proverbs and you just have an instinct \nfor “the right thing to do” -or \nat least you know better than to stir up \nany hornets’ nests. When you’re about to do something stupid, the \nStoryteller or Narrator should stop you and say, “DO you really want to \ndo that?’’ This is a good Merit for novice players, as it allows them to play \ncharacters who know better or to help them learn the ropes of the game. \nWhen you shut out distractions and focus on a task, you can \novercome any outside disturbance. It doesn’t matter if you’re in a \nfirefight, in sleet or hail, hanging upside down- these annoyances just \ndon’t bother you. You never suffer any penalty Traits for deleterious \ncircumstances, though you can still be distracted by Mind magic or \nwounds, and you still suffer penalties if you’re actually mentally or \nphysically restrained from performing your task completely. \nC~NCENTRATICBN \n(I TRAIT r€hrr) \nLIGHT SLEPER \n(I TCB 3 TRAIT \n~I~ERIT) \nWhether due to magical boon or just a quirk of physiology, you \nsubsist on less sleep than the average person. For one Trait, you need \nsleep only four hours a night. You don’t take penalties for sleep \ndeprivation, unless you get less than this. For two Traits, you need sleep \nonly two hours a night - \nyou can remain functional even on the run \nor while holding down multiple jobs at once. At a cost of three Traits, \nyou never sleep naturally; you can still be physically exhausted, but you \ndon’t require rest for your mind, and you only go to sleep if you choose \nto, if you are magically influenced or just plain knocked out. \nLIGHTNING \nCALCULAT~R \n(I TRAIT \nr€hrr) \nYou’re a whiz with numbers. You can perform all manner of \ncomplex math in your head instantly with incredible accuracy. You’re \nallowed to carry and use a calculator, which isn’t considered “in play” \n(it’s just there so that you can do your calculations “in your head”). \nT I ~ E  \nSENSE \n(I TRAIT \nI’~RIT) \nYou have an unusual acuity for the passage of time. Although you’re \nstill susceptible to Time magic manipulation, you have an internal sense \nfor time that’s accurate to about a minute and, barring magical \ncompression or time travel, always correct. This can be useful in \ndetermining exactly when a given spell will wear off or in calculating \ntime differences for strange Umbral Realms. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nBERSERKER (2 TRAIT IbRIT) \nThe killing fury lurks within you. When you’re injured, a red haze \nseems to obscure your vision, and you kill.. . and kill.. . and kill. Each \ntime you’re injured in combat, make a Static Challenge pitting your \npermanent Willpower against a difficulty of six Traits plus one Trait for \neach health level of damage you’ve suffered. If you fail, you enter a \nberserk frenzy. While berserk, you suffer no penalties for wounds \n(though you still collapse when Mortally Wounded), and you \nimmediately attempt to engage the nearest enemy target in close \ncombat. You must make the same test each time you wish to snap out \nof the frenzy, unless there’s nobody left (including your friends and \nallies!) around you. \nIf you have the Flaw: Short Fuse, you suffer a two-Trait resolution \npenalty on all challenges to resist or snap out of your berserk state. \nC@N @? HCI”R (2 TRAIT ~ ~ R I T )  \nA specific code of behavior and ethics guides your actions. Your \npersonal experiences and beliefs shape this code, so it’s guided by your \nown nature, not some arbitrary list of external injunctions. You must \nwork with the Storyteller to delineate the nature and limits of your \ncode, and you must roleplay living up to it. However, you gain one free \nretest on any Mental or Social Challenge that might result in you \nviolating your Code of Honor. \nEIDETIC \n~ E ~ @ R Y  \n(2 TRAIT \n~ E R I T )  \nYour memory is nearly perfect, and you recall with incredible \nclarity almost everything you experience. A single turn of attention is \nsufficient to commit a page, picture or short conversation to memory. \nIf you are involved in a combat or otherwise distracted, you must make \na Static Mental Challenge, difficulty of six Traits, to successfully \nmemorize the contents of your subject of scrutiny. You should keep a \n“cheat sheet” of your memories to aid you and the Storyteller in \n“recollection.” \nI R ~ N  \nWILL \n(3 TRAIT \n~ ~ R I T )  \nWhen your mind is set, your will is not easily broken. You gain three \nbonus Traits in resolution of challenges where the outcome would \naffect your rational thoughts (most Mind manipulation counts, including \nmanipulation of your senses with illusions or invisibility) but not \nagainst emotional alteration. Should you run afoul of a vampire with \nthe Dominate Disciple (a set of hypnotic vampire mind-control powers), \nyou may spend a Willpower Trait to gain a retest against it (as usual), \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nbut if you win, you gain total immunity to all Dominate powers of that \nvampire for the next five minutes. \nCGXIIPULSICBN \n(I re 4 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nWhether by psychological, physical or supernatural impairment, \nyou find yourself forced to do (or not do) a specific thing or class of \nthings. The action could be just about anything; by its very nature, it \ncan make your existence uncomfortable at the very least. \nWith a psychological Compulsion, you might be able to overcome \nyour difficulty with a Static Challenge of your permanent Willpower \nTraits versus a difficulty of the Flaw's value plus six Traits. (If you lose, \nyou do lose a temporary Willpower Trait - \nyou fought and failed.) \nWith a supernatural or physical Compulsion, you're stuck: Your body or \nsoul just can't cope. Even if you manage to overcome your Compulsion \nbriefly in some fashion, you don't escape it without extensive work (and \nExperience Traits). \nThe value for a Compulsion varies with its severity. Storytellers, \ntake note of players who look for loopholes to take a Compulsion and \nthen use the letter of the Compulsion to suffer no real hindrance for it. \nThat's a violation of the spirit of the rules and should be disciplined \nappropriately. \nFlaw \nCompulsion \nOne Trait \nDo not cross a threshold without permission, \nnever show fear to the enemy, never contradict \na superior, always keep your hands clean \nNever refuse a reasonable bet, never betray \nany emotion, do not touch anything hold or \nconsecrated to a particular faith, never harm a \nchild \nNever refuse a duel, never strike a woman, \nnever refuse an offer of sex, never tell a lie, \nnever take a life, always check for fire hazards \nbefore you leave the house \nNever tell the truth, dance whenever you hear \nmusic, become entranced by the beauty in \nmirrors or books, never refuse a dare, do no \nharm ever \nTwo Traits \nThree Traits \nFour Traits \nDEP SLEEPER \n(I TRAIT \nFLAW) \nSnore, toss and ignore the alarm - \nyou sleep like a force of nature. \nWhen you must wake up to deal with something, you're stuck. If you just \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nwoke up, roleplay it: You stagger, stumble and look bleary-eyed, and rest \nup against anything vaguely pillowlike in an attempt to return to \nDreamland. Take a one-Trait resolution penalty on $1 challenges for the \nscene, after which you finally wake up. \nINEPTITUDE (I TRAIT \nFMW) \nYou just suck at something. Pick one Ability that you possess. You \nsuffer a two-Trait resolution penalty on all challenges related to that \nAbility. The Storyteller has final say on which Ability you may limit in \nthis fashion; taking Ineptitude with, say, Computer in a chronicle where \nyou never use the things is not worth any Traits. \nNIGWS \n[I TRAIT \n%w) \nHorrible nightmares wrack your sleep and prevent you from rest. \nYou dread slumber as it may mean the return of the terrors, and you \nsometimes find yourself in such stunningly complex and real nightmares \nthat you can't tell them from reality. If you suffer from Nightmares before \nagiven game (Storyteller's discretion), you suffer a one-Trait resolution \npenalty on all challenges due to the fatigue. You might also find yourself \ninvolved in a short story that turns out to be a nightmare instead of \nreality, though you wouldn't know at first. You cannot take this Flaw in \nconjunction with the Merit: Sleepless. \nSLEPWALKER \n(I TCB 4 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nMagic? What a load of horse-puckey. No sane person believes in \nthat - \nleastwise, not you. Or perhaps you don't believe in this high- \nfangled super-science - \nmaybe you're from a backwater part of the \nworld, or perhaps you have some reincarnation of a Past Life translocated \nto the present from the past, or just wound up coming from a non- \ntechnological background. \nSince you don't believe in these things, you don't see them, and you \ncertainly don't cause them. With the one-Trait version of the Flaw, you \ncan only perform magic (or super-science) that would be coincidental, \nbecause you don't believe in it. For two Traits, you don't believe in \neither. This means that you count as a witness for Paradox purposes on \nother peoples' magic. For two extra Traits on top of this, you can still \ndo vulgar magic but you count as a witness against your own magic, so \nit's always Paradox-prone. \nSWHHEARTED \n(1 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nYou cannot abide suffering, because of the emotional disturbance \nor pain that it causes you. You must avoid causing pain or suffering to \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nanyone; only by spending a Willpower Trait can you overcome this \nlimitation for a scene/hour. \nS\n~\nH\n \nImPE~~rhem \n(I TRAIT FLAW) \nA stammer, Tourette's Syndrome or other speech deficiency makes \ncommunication difficult for you. Roleplay your deficiency, and suffer a \ntwo-Trait resolution penalty on all verbal communication. \nA~NESIA \n(2 TRAIT \n~%Aw) \nYou've got this problem, but damned if you can remember what it \nis.. .. You have no memory of your past, history, family or pretty much \nanything. This doesn't prevent you from having Abilities (you stilt know \nhow to do things) but you may not know exactly what you can do, or how \ngood you are. The Storyteller keeps your character record and never \nreveals to you your exact Traits, Spheres or the like until you try to use \nthem. \nPHCDBIA \n(2 TRAIT FLAW) \nSome object, creature or circumstance fills you with dread. This fear \ngoes far beyond the normal level of phobias. You react with primal terror \nto the thing, treating it as a dire threat. When confronted by the object \nof your fear, you must make a Static Challenge of your permanent \nWillpower Traits against a difficulty of six Traits, risking a temporary \nWillpower Trait. Should you fail, you flee in terror. If you're out of \nWillpower, you simply curl up into a helpless ball, unable to act. Ifpressed \ninto a comer and forced to defend yourself against the object of your fears, \nyou suffer a two-Trait resolution penalty on all challenges against it. \nSHCDRT \nFuse (2 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nWhenever someone ticks you off, you tend to fly off the handle. \nMake a Static Willpower Challenge (difficulty six Traits) when you're \ninsulted or threatened. Failure means that you automatically take the \noffensive - \nthis may mean responding in kind, be it with verbal abuse, \nsocial vendettas or physical violence. If you have the Berserker Flaw, you \nsuffer a two-Trait penalty on your challenges to control your berserk \nrages, as well. \nVENGEFUL \n(2 TM FLAW) \nYou want to even a score, either from before your Awakening or \nwith some group or individual encountered thereafter. You constantly \nplan ways to satisfy your revenge, and if presented with an opportunity \nfor vengeance, you must spend a Willpower Trait to take any different \naction for the scene. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nI \" -  \n, I  \nI\n.\n \nJ \nI .  \n* \n&ILIR \nDWICIT (5 TRAIT \nFFLAW) \nYou're not in tune with your natural Abilities; perhaps you lack an \neducation, or maybe you're just not good with them. You start play with \nno Abilities other than those you take with Free Traits. Furthermore, \nyou cannot purchase more than one level of any Ability, or any \nspecialization at all, until you overcome this Flaw. \nSUPERNATURAL r k U T S A N D  FLAWS \nCCBNDITICBNAL \n~\nG\nI\nC\n \n(I TCB 6 TRAIT \nmew CBRFLAW) \nSome specific condition either enhances or hinders your craft. \nMaybe you work your magic best in bright sunlight, or when affecting \nredheads, or on Halloween. Perhaps your magic has no effect on \nanything larger than you can hold, or anyone who's sworn to uphold \njust ice. \nThe value for this Merit or Flaw varies with the scarcity of \noccurrence. If you gain a bonus against something really common, that \ncosts several Traits; similarly, if your magic fails against a common \nfixture, that's a significant Flaw worth several Traits. As a base, this \ngives you a three-Trait resolution modifier to all Arete challenges \nwhere the condition is a factor. You may adjust this modifier downward; \ndoing so reduces the value of the Conditional Magic by the same number \nof Traits. \nTraits \nCondition \nOne Trait \nTwo Traits \nUnique: The Sword of Roland, the Matriarch \nof the MECHA construct, leap year \nScarce as hen's teeth: Current or former \nmembers of the Council of Nine, your former \nMentors, once in a blue moon \nRare, but not unheard of: toadstones, Swedish \nroyalty, werewolves, rowan and red thread, \nthe holy days of the archangels \nSpecial order: virgins, Middle Eastern eye- \nbead charms, any member of Iteration X, during \na thunderstorm \nAvailable without much trouble: cold iron, \nsilver, Christians, any member of the \nTraditions, a windy day, holy ground \nCommon as dirt: men, anyone who's ever \nbeen baptised, the color purple, under cloud \ncover, Tuesdays \nThree Traits \nFour Traits \nFive Traits \nSix Traits \n. e  \nI \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nExample: Melissa decides that she wants her character to be a “weather \nwitch” --Verbena \nwitha knackfor s t o m .

Your hands are as warm as sunlight or stones from a cheery \nhearth. A common Merit among Verbena. \nPARL~RTIUCK \n(I TRAIT \nI ~ ~ I T )  \nYou have some petty, not-very-useful-but-still-impressive magical \nfeat that you can perform pretty much at will. This doesn’t mean that \nyou can duplicate the effects of the Spheres easily; it’s just a little knack \nor trick that you’ve come by and which is so simple that it requires no \nchallenge or risk of Paradox on your part. \nYou can use a Parlor Trick to conjure a dime with a twist of your \nwrist, make a spark with a snap of your fingers, turn around and cause \nmotes of light to fly from the hem of your wardrobe, or perform some \nother simple feat. This doesn’t give you bonus Traits, nor does it inflict \nany damage. The Storyteller has absolute discretion in the nature of \nwhat your Parlor Trick can or can’t do. Note that you only get a single \nParlor Trick; you can’t do all of the above with this Merit, just one of \nthem. \nCIRCU~SPECT \nAVATAR \n(2 T~asr \n~€IERIT) \nAvatar? What’s that? You may believe in Avatars, but you’ve \ncertainly never had any dealings with yours. You do not enter a \nMindscape in order to undergo a Seeking; instead, you find \nenlightenment in mundane things. Your Avatar does not guide you \ndirectly or appear to you in dreams. At most, it simply gives you \nimpressions or hunches. \n~ E D I U ~  \n(2 TRAIT \n  TIER IT) \nYou hear dead people. More specifically, you can hear the sounds \nof the Underworld. When a particularly fierce patch of storms races \nacross the Deadlands, you hear the shrieking winds; when a ghost pleads \nfor aid, you’re aware. If this ability becomes known to the Dead, they \nmay flock to you, begging for your aid and intercession in the living \nlands. Conversely, you don’t have to rely on Spirit magic to speak with \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthe departed, and occasionally they can provide useful advice or \nassistance. \nUNAGING \n(2 TRAIT \nIITem) \nYou never suffer the rigors of age. It’s up to you and the Storyteller \nto decide whether you appear to age, or whether you just “stopped” \nsomewhere along the line. You never suffer any penalties for old age \n(and you cannot take the &ng Flaw relating to old age). \n@RACW&ILITY \n(3 TRAIT \n~ E R I T )  \nNo, you’re not one of the strange and distant Enlightened masters \nliving out beyond the Horizon, but you do have an uncanny knack for \nspotting signs and portents. Once per session, you may attempt to read \naparticular omen by making a Static Mental Challenge with a difficulty \nof eight or more Traits (Narrator’s discretion). If you succeed, you \nreceive some insight into the current situation, allowing you to claim \none retest at some point during the night as you draw on the visions that \nyou interpreted. \nCYCLIC \n~ A G I C  \n(3 TRAIT \nIII~RIT) \nSome natural phase ties directly into your magic. Perhaps you’re in \ntune with the tides and your magic ebbs and recedes with them, or \nmaybe you follow the pattern of seasons. Pick one cyclical phenomenon \n-phases of the moon, stock market patterns, Internet outages - \nand \ndecide when your “high” and “low” points exist. Your Arete challenge \nresolution varies by up to three Traits depending upon the point of the \ncycle - \nplus three at your high point, minus three at the low. The \ntiming should balance out, but this is an advantage because you can \nplan your most important and dangerous workings around your cyclical \npeaks. \nrkNIRSTAVATAR(3 TR4IT ITIEIuT) \nYour Avatar isn’t content to sit idly by, whispering wisdom and \nurging you in dreams. No, it wants attention, and it wants it now! As a \nresult, your Avatar actually manifests from time to time. When it \nappears, it does so as an illusory form that only you can see (though \nothers who read your mind can also sense and see it). The Avatar may \ntalk with you, order you around or just make cryptic mutterings. If you \nhave the Allies Background, you may choose to specify that your Avatar \nis actually inside of a person or creature Ally, and it speaks and interacts \nthrough that entity. Destruction of that form doesn’t hinder the \nAvatar; it simply finds anew home. If you have the Phylactery Flaw, your \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAvatar may have a physical form that can interact with you (like a \ncomputer). With magic, you can even give your Avatar a separate form. \nYou focus the spirit and material worlds together with your very \npresence. The Gauntlet is always considered one level lower for you. \nFor some mysterious reason, the deadly veil that separates spirit \nfrom flesh has no effect upon you. While other mages must suffer \nterrible trials to quest in the spirit world, your magic can directly affect \nit without interference. You do not suffer any damage from the Avatar \nStorm. With the five-Trait version of this Merit, your protection \nextends to anyone touching you. \nNATURAL CHANNEL \n(3 TRAIT \nlTIe~r) \nSTCI\"ARDEN (3 QRS TRAIT \nr€brr) \nUNBCBNDABLE \n(3 TRAIT \nI~~ERIT) \nYou're resistant to the blandishments of supernatural compulsion \n- \nwell, maybe one such type of compulsion, anyway. You might be \nimmune to cursed items that force you into servitude, or perhaps you are \nimmune to the Blood Bond that befalls those who drink thrice of \nvampire blood. Pick one such condition of magically enforced slavery; \nyou're immune to it. If, however, you are in a position to reap benefits \nas well due to it (say, you have a magical ring that normally corrupts the \nwearer but also gives him powers, or you want to be a ghoul without \nsuffering the Blood Bond), you must pay double for this Merit. \nFAE \nBLWD (4 TRAIT \n~TIEIUT) \nThe blood of the fae runs in your veins. As a result, you can sense \nand interact with the faerie worlds, to a limited degree. You're considered \nkinain, a mortal who has a blood-relation to the fae and can thus learn \nsome of their powers. Although you can't hold Glamour, you can learn \nchangeling cantrips, and they're Paradox-free to you. You can also be \neasily enchanted to see the Dreaming worlds and interact with the fae. \nYou have a naturally low Banality, so you aren't off-putting to many \nfaeries. \nFor more about the kinain and their special gifts, see The Shining \nHost Players Guide. \nYou're just plain lucky. You get three retestsper story (for which you \nbid a Lucky Trait: \"I got Lucky -you \nmissed me last time.\"), though you \nmay not use more than one to retest on any given challenge. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSHAPECHANGER \nKIN (4 TRAIT \n~ ~ ~ E R I T )  \nA cousin to wolves, or so it’s said, you have a family relation \n(however distant) to the shapeshifter races. Even if you’re not Awakened, \nyou do not suffer the Delirium, the madness that overtakes humans who \nwitness the Changing Breeds in their monstrous forms. You might even \nlearn one of their spiritual tricks -Gifts -which gather no Paradox, \nbut you cannot hold Gnosis, the innate connection to the spirit world \nshared by the true shifters. Some family or friends might know of \nshapeshifters, and you could perhaps learn a few rudiments about them, \nbut you’d best be careful; the shapeshifters tread very carefully with \nmages. Still, you have a better standing than most with the changers. \nFor more about the Kinfolk of Garou and the Changing Breeds, see \nLaws of the Wild and the Changing Breeds books. \nTWIN \nSWLS (4 TRAIT \n~TIEw~) \nYour Avatar sundered at some point, and you have a soulmate who \nhas a similar piece of Avatar. This person could be anyone - \na twin, \na mage, a Sleeper, a stranger. The only thing you know is that when you \ntwo come in contact, your Avatar seems briefly whole. With your \nsoulmate, you can share Quintessence and cast spells using the highest \nratings for your Arete and Spheres. You gain an additional amount of \nQuintessence equal to the Avu,atar Background rating of the two of you \ncombined, though this “bonus pool” is like any other pool in that it must \nbe refreshed if you want it to continue to hold Quintessence for later \njunctures. \nIf you have Apprentice-level Correspondence, you always know \nwhere your soulmate is. With Apprentice-levelLife, you know his exact \nstate of health; with Apprentive-level Mind, you may share thoughts \nand emotions. If one member of the pair dies, the survivor must succeed \nin a Static Willpower Challenge (difficulty of eight Traits) or suffer a \npsychic shock leading to the loss of one permanent Willpower Trait. In \nany case, you won’t have a soulmate to work with until the Avatar \nfragment returns through reincarnation. \nThe unholy blood of vampires gives you cursed power and sustains \nyou. So long as you drink about a pint of vampire blood each month, you \ngain a multitude of inherent (Paradox-free) powers. You may refresh all \nof your Strength-related Physical Traits once per game at no cost, and \nyou do not age. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nIf you use Laws of the Night, you gain the first Basic level of Potence \nand you can learn additional Basic Disciplines known to the vampire \nwhose blood you drink (at twice the normal cost). You have a Blood \nPool and can gamer and use additional Blood Traits if they’re given to \nyou by a vampire. \nOn the downside, you’re a parasite sucking on a parasite. You gain \none extra Resonance Trait of both Entropic and Static Resonance. You \nrisk the Blood Bond, and your Avatar is eclipsed by the curse of the \nblood, which may cause any of your Seekings to fail at a Narrator’s \ndiscretion. If you fail to get your “fix,” you lose your special powers and \nall of your skipped age catches up with you. Plus, vampires will fear or \nhate you and want to use you as a pawn. If they make you one of them, \nyou lose your magical powers, forever. Step carefully. \nLSENDARY ATTRIBUTE \n6 TRAIT \nrIleRIT) \nThe might of Hercules, the wisdom of Solomon, the speed of \nMercury - \nyour mage inherits some phenomenal characteristic that \nexceeds normal human strengths. Pick one Attribute Trait category: In \nthat category, your Trait maximum increases by three Traits. Actually \npurchasing these additional Traits still costs you the usual points, \nthough. Furthermore, you have some sort of legendary capability tied to \nyour improved Attribute. Work with your Storyteller to devise some \npassive (always on) or active (usable once per day) capability. Some \nexamples include: \nWith Legendary Strength, you might have the capacity to lift a \ntremendous weight once per game. You could heft a car, a boulder or a \ntelephone booth, perhaps even staggering a few steps with it. \nWith Legendary Stamina, you might heal one health level per day, \nregardless of the level of injury. \nWith Legendary Perception, you might never be surprised. \nWith Legendary Charisma, you might gain one free retest on any \nSocial Challenge of first impressions, once per game. \nSHATTEREDAVATAR~ \nT w  \nrIleRIT) \nSome crisis in the past shattered your Avatar. This may have been \nbefore you were born, or perhaps a botched magical rite broke your \nAvatar to pieces after your Awakening. Although you start with only \nyour basic Avatar Background, you have the potential to improve it \nduring the course of the game. You need only hunt down the lost, \nshattered pieces of your Avatar, which could be anywhere - \nin some \nother dimension, trapped in an item, in another mage, etc. Liberate \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthese pieces or claim them for yourself (by finding them, taking the item \nand breaking it or killing the other mages), and you gain the strength \nof that piece of your Avatar added to your own. You must seek these out \non your own-some \nPrime, Spirit and Correspondence magic might help, \nbut these pieces are flung across the whole of Creation with no telling \nwhere they're located or how they might be guarded against scrying or \nintrusion. Some might not even want to come back! \nYou may exceed the usual Background limit of Traits with this \nMerit, but of course only to the limit that your Storyteller allows. If the \nStoryteller decides that five Traits of Avatar is enough, he's not \nobligated to put in more quests for pieces of your Avatar. \nSPHERE \nNATURAL 6 \nT W  \n~ E R I T )  \nChoose one Sphere. You have a natural affinity for this sort of \nmagic. You pay one less Experience Trait for every level that you \npurchase in this Sphere. \nAVATARCCBITIPANICBN \n(7 \nTRAIT \n~TIEIUT) \nJust as your Avatar cycles through many lives, so too does a lesser \nAvatar bound to yours by some skein of fate. Each time your Avatar is \n\"reborn\" to a new life, this other Avatar also returns to the mortal world \nwith a body and soul. Your companion, though, retains many memories \nand past images of your earlier incarnations. This can be a great help in \npuzzling out Past Lives, working through problems that you've ostensibly \nsolved before, and in recognizing works made by your Avatar in the past. \nThe Storyteller should create this companion, though another \nplayer's character might suffice if you trust the players sufficiently not to \nuse this as an excuse to maximize their combined skills. The companion \nhas no special characteristics other than its memories, unless you also \ntake the Allies Background. \nDUAL TRADITICBNS \n(3 TRAIT \n  TIER IT) \nYou trained early on in multiple styles: Perhaps your teacher was a \nmaveric or Orphan, or maybe you swapped from one Chantry to a new \nmentor when your old instructor died or vanished, or maybe you just \ndecided that you liked one Tradition better than the one that first \ninducted you. You may use the foci of both Traditions, and you gain a \nspecialty Sphere from both. \nTRUE \n'FAITH (7 TRAIT ~€IERIT) \nThe light of God, Allah, Buddha or whatever name you use for the \nAlmighty shines from your soul. You have one Trait of True Faith, \nwhich can be used in a variety of ways. Among mages, you gain one \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nextra Trait in defense against anyone else’s magical Effects. Further- \nmore, you can use this Trait just like a Willpower Trait. However, \nretaining the compassionate, generous, honorable demeanor of one of \nthe truly faithful requires you to uphold an exceedingly demanding \ncode. You must live and exemplify all the best virtues of your religion: \nCharity, mercy, understanding and so on. Of course, you might also \nhave some personal flaws - \nTrue Faith seems common among witch- \nhunters - \nbut this is not often the case. \nFor more comprehensive information about True Faith, see Laws \nof the Hunt. \nTHE \nBARD’S T~NGUE \n(I TRAIT \nFFLAW) \nWhen you mutter unpleasant imprecations, they have a nasty way \nof coming true. Once per session, some uncomfortable possibility that \nyou mention - \neven sarcastically! - \nwill come true. Anything from \n“It could only get worse if the car broke down” to “This guy’s too good \nto be true - \nI bet he’s a Nephandus” could come to pass. If you don’t \nmention anything particularly noteworthy, a Storyteller or Narrator \nmight whisper to you a cryptic pronouncement that simply comes upon \nyou and blurts out. To quash this urge you must expend a Willpower \nTrait and suffer one health level of bashing damage as you bite down on \nyour tongue. \nDEVIL‘S mARK (I TRAIT \nFLAW) \nA small physical characteristic or deformity seems to lend credence \nto the belief that you’re in league with infernal forces. While you may \nor may not really be an infernalist, this marking (which is otherwise not \nharmful or crippling) certainly looks like one of the signs out of folklore \n-a \nconspicuous, oddly shaped birthmark, an extra nipple, a set of bums \nthat don’t heal. Those who look for witches may recognize these signs. \n(If you do happen to have a pet or consor of infernal origin, this \nfamiliar can draw Quintessence from you by contact with your mark, \nthough this bonus is admittedly a slim one.) \n~ H W S  \n(1 ~e s TRAIT l%~w) \nVarious legends and stories about magicians manifest around you. \nPerhaps your presence causes horses to sweat, or makes cows’ milk \ncurdle. Maybe wind chimes always ring when you’re around, even if \nthere’s no wind. On the really nasty end, you might be vulnerable to \nnails driven through your footprints, or blocked by pure seasalt. Perhaps \nyour shadow japes at you when you aren’t looking, or your powerful chi \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nenergy causes you to float slightly when you sit. Pick one specific flaw \nbased on folklore and seek your Storyteller’s approval (and value). \nG ~ S A  \n(I TCB S TRAIT \nFLAW) \nUnlike a Compulsion, which is something that you deliberately \nhave no choice to do or not do, a Gem represents a magical imperative \nthat still gives you the choice, but requires you not to indulge in it. If \nyou violate this Geas, you could suffer the loss of life, magic, perhaps \neven your soul. The Gem might be due to a curse, a particularly bad \nParadox backlash, a special quest laid upon you or a hereditary condition. \nYou must attach your Geas to a specific Merit, Flaw or Background. \nThe Gem represents a point-break, because it limits the final utility of \nthat Trait. For instance, you could have the Gem of “If I ever entrap the \nsouls of the dead with magic, I will lose their favor forever,” linked to \nyour Merit: Sphere Affinity: Spirit. Trapping the souls of the dead is a \npretty easily avoided, unlikely circumstance - \na four-Trait Geas, \nsubtracted from the five-Trait value of the Merit, which yields a final \nresult of one Trait. The Gem is thus a one-Trait Flaw. Conversely, if you \nstuck a very heavy prohibition on it (“If I ever see the full moon, I will \nlose my affinity for spirits”), that would be worth more: a five-Trait \nMerit, minus a one-Trait Gem, means that the final value of the Gea \nis a four-Trait Flaw. Or, say that you decided that if you ever eat red \nmeat, you will sicken and die (gain the Flaw: Degeneration, six-Trait \nlevel). The condition is pretty unlikely (four Traits); take the four-Trait \nGem from the six-Trait Flaw and you have two Traits - \nthe final value \nof the Flaw with Gem, since it’s unlikely to happen and thus not worth \nas many points. This means that a Geas on a relatively trivial boon is \nnot worth much, but a Gem on a hefty power can heavily cut the cost \nof apower if the conditions are strict enough. Note that if the Gem Trait \nvalue exceeds the other Trait’s value, you can still take the Geas but \nyou’d get no Traits for it. For instance, you decide that if you ever bind \nthe dead, you will lose your Medium Merit. The circumstance is a four- \nTrait Gem, pretty unlikely to happen, but the Merit itself is only two \nTraits; that would be a negative two Trait total, which would make the \nGem a two-Trait Merit (you’d have to spend Traits for it!). Instead it’s \njust not worth any Traits - \nthe only way that you can cut the cost of \nan already-cheap Merit or Flaw is to take a very, very strong Geas with \nit. \nA Gem cannot reduce a Merit, Flaw or Background cost to zero \nTraits. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nFour \nFive \nThe Trait values here are merely suggestions. The Storyteller, as \nTraits \nGeas \nOne \nalways, has final say about appropriate Geasa. \nInevitable circumstance or incredible sacrifice: \nWhen you die, if you ever let the sun touch \nyour skin, if you ever allow your feet to touch \nthe earth, if you ever speak another word \nsignificant sacrifice: Remain a virgin, never \nharm a living creature, never tell a lie \nEveryday circumstance or common sacrifice: \nNever back down from a fight, never tell a \nsecret, never refuse hospitality, never marry, \nnever have children \nUnlikely circumstance or a small sacrifice: \nStop and pet every cat you see, never eat any \nanimal product, never harm a certain type of \nanimal or a certain type of person, never raise \nyour sword in anger \nEasily avoided circumstance or trivial sacrifice: \nNever break bread with a red-haired man, say \nyour prayers every night, take your vitamins, \nnever harm the kind, don’t eat ham, keep \none small secret \nTwo \nAlmost unavoidable circumstance or \nThree \nClassic penalties for violating a Gem include suffering a Dark Fate, \nhaving luck turn from good to bad (like losing the Lucky Merit), being \ndeserted by your familiar, losing your Avatar, losing a totem, losing all \nof your friends or losing all of your worldly possessions. \nIf you ever violate your Geus, you also become oath-marked. The \npatterns of fate determine that you have done so, and anyone with \nApprentice-level Entropy who senses fate about you can tell that you are \nan oathbreaker. \nCRUCIAL C@mP@NENT (2 T@ s TRAIT ‘FLAW) \nSome special ingredient fuels your magic. This isn’t just a focus - \nit’s an absolutely essential material or prop that completes your magical \ncastings for all of your spells. The value depends on the scarcity of the \nitem: \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCrucial Component \nSunlight, eggs, motor oil, tea, aspirin, \nelectricity, emotion, ectoplasm \nBeeswax candles, blood, fresh lavender, grave \ndirt, holy water, rage, spectral residue \nVirgin's blood, hashish, dead humans, gold, \nplatonic love, the fires of Hell \nDiamonds, live humans that you sacrifice, rare \norchids, lightning strikes, transcendent joy, \nthe tears of an angel, any variety of Tass \nDARK FATE \n(S TRAIT \nFFLAW) \nSome horrible end awaits you, and you cannot avert it. Worse still, \nyou have glimpses or some foreknowledge of your demise or eternal \ntorment. The Storyteller will determine a particular fate, which will \ninvariably strike you, removing your character from play. Furthermore, \nin any particular session where the Storyteller deems it appropriate, you \nmay receive a vision of your impending misery. You must spend a \nWillpower Trait to shake off the experience, or you are a Trait down on \nall challenge resolution for the rest of the session. This Flaw can be \ndifficult to roleplay, and players are advised to think carefully before \nchoosing it. Some may believe that this Flaw removes free will, but \nforeknowledge of one's demise can be quite liberating. \n, \nSPHEE \nINEPT (s TRAIT FFLAW) \nYou're just miserable with one of the Spheres. It simply doesn't \nwork well for you. Maybe your Avatar is damaged, or perhaps your \nunderstanding is incomplete, or you may even labor under some karmic \ndebt of a past life. The end result is the same: You must pay one extra \nExperience Trait for each level that you purchase in the Sphere. You \nmay only choose this Flaw once. \nI/ \nPHYLACTERY \n(7 TRAIT \nFFLAW) \nYour Avatar isn't tied directly to you - \nit's invested in some \nconcept, object or location. So long as you remain in a place where that \ninvestiture is strong, you can tap your magical potential. If you lose the \nitem, if the concept fades or if you leave the area, your ability to work \nmagic vanishes until you can get back to your Avatar! \nYour object, location or idea is essentially considered a part of you; \nthat is, if your Phylactery happens to be your magic sword, you can affect \nit withCowespodnce as if you have an arcane connection to it, and you \ncan't be forced to discard it any more than you could be forced to discard \n, \na -  \n. \nI ' r  . I '  , \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nyour own hand. (It would still be affected with Matter instead of Life \nmagic, though.) You must use your Phylactery in some way in all of your \nmagic. If it’s a magical staff, you must wave it grandly about; if it’s the \nPacific Ocean, you must hold up, splash and spray the ocean’s water; if \nit’s the idea of democracy, you must spout rhetorical dogma. \nYou can always sense the location of your Phylactery, so if you are \nteleported away or lose it, you can locate it. If it’s damaged or destroyed, \nyou can repair or replace it, but you can’t have more than one. \nIf you are tied to a specific location, you can only work magic while \nyou’re there. Similarly, if you have a specific concept or group whose \nbeliefs you espouse, your magic only works so long as you’re a recognized \npart of that group (so destroying the group would also effectively snuff \nyour Phylactery, unless you managed to rebuild the group from scratch \nor re-awaken the concept in people’s minds.). \nIf you die, your Avatar may or may not go back into the cycle of being \n- \nthe Phylactery might await you next incarnation, or it might crumble \nand vanish, or your Avatar might simply flee and return to the Wheel. \nThe following Merits and Flaws are from the Guide to the Technoc- \nTEHNKRACY \n~T~ERITS \nAND FLAWS \nracy and thus are especially appropriate to Technocrat characters. \nUNBBTRUSIVE \n(I TRAIT \nr€krr) \nThis Merit allows you to be the person that no one ever notices. \nThis is not as powerful as Arcane - \nyou aren’t invisible, people won’t \nforget you were there, and evidence of you won’t vanish. It does, \nhowever, allow you to not stand out of a crowd. Think of it as aperpetual \n“blandness” effect that you cannot turn off. \nAdd two Traits to all difficulties to recall your appearance, or your \nactions if you were not the center of attention. \nACUTE SENSES (1 BR 3 TRAIT mEIUT) \nYou have one or more senses that are above and beyond the human \nnorm. While not superhuman, the amount your character can perceive \nis exceptional. \nFor one Trait, you have one sharp sense. This gives you a two-Trait \nbonus for resolution of challenges for tests involving that sense. \nFor three Traits, all your senses are enhanced. \nNote that when your heightened senses are exposed to particularly \npowerful stimuli (such as spotlights, jet engines, a discharging skunk), you \nmay, at your Storyteller’s discretion, be rendered temporarily “numb” in that \nsense, resulting in severe penalties or lack of use of that sense for some time. \nI’ I I - r  \n. \nI ,r. \n‘&.it, \n‘, ; \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nFACTICBNS \nZmrar: Many mages who have met Taftani see them as \nloud, brash, egotistical, obnoxious warmongers. The Zaotar \nvery much resemble this remark. They live by the credo, \"If it \noffends you, blow it up\" and love nothing more than using great \nulgar Effects to smash the lies of the Technocracy. Their \notism stems from their unshakeable belief that they are right \nand any who buy into the lie are wrong. While their ways seem \nchaotic, they do in fact have a cause - \nthe destruction of the \nTechnocratic paradigm. Specialty Sphere : Forces \nesoteric. They tend to concentrate on divinations, \nKuhin: These mages rely more heavily on the \nses.

(I-S TRAIT \n~ E R I T )  \nThis merit allows the type of licenses that allow you to kill, break \nlaws, etc., as well as the more mundane types of civil permits. Depending \non the cost of the Merit, you can: \nOne Trait \nTwo Traits \nThree Traits \nFour Traits \nFive Traits \nOwn and operate specialized vehicles \n(limousines, trucks, planes, helicopters) \nPractice medicine, law (lawyer, paramedic, \ndoctor) \nUphold the law (police officer, government \nagent, detective) \nOwn/operate military hardware (heavy \nweapons, milspec vehicles, explosives) \nBreak the law in the course of duty (diplomat, \nsecret agent - \nand yes, this level includes \nkilling people) \nThe level of license you take requires certain responsibilities - \ntypically a job, membership in certain groups/agencies/etc. There are \nalso always consequences to abusing the license - \na secret agent who \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nkills four or five people a session is going to get called on by his superiors \nto find out why, possibly even having his license revoked. The Storyteller \nis completely within his rights to take this merit away from you if you \nabuse it. \nCCBNFIDENCE \n(2 PCBINT  em) \nWhile the Technocracy may be “The Man,” you are definitely “Da \nMan!” and you know it. You have an overwhelming self-confidence in \nyour abilities, perhaps to the point of hubris, but you are sure of yourself \n- \nand others notice too. \nThis Merit grants you a two-Trait bonus for resolution of all \nLeadership and Intimidation challenges. \n€&FICIALLY DEAD (2 TRAIT ~€IERIT) \nAccording to all government records and documents, you are dead. \nAny attempts to locate official records of documents reflect this status \n- \ntracking you via official means is very difficult. All attempts to use \nBureaucracy Influences directly against you fail. The Storyteller may \ngive other Influences similar modifications at his discretion. \n(Typically, going to see old family and friends who knew you from \nbefore is a good way to lose this Merit - \nenough “Elvis”-type sightings \nby old acquaintances, and someone will discover that you are not dead. \nThis may cause you to lose the Merit, or, more likely, to actually be \nkilled to make sure your secret is not exposed.) \nPCBKERFACE \n(2 TRAIT \nr h u ~ l  \nYou have the ultimate poker face -no sign of emotion ever crosses \nyour face.

You \nreceive a one-Trait bonus for resolution of challenges involving such \npowers being used against you. Further, if affected with such a power, \nyou may expend a Willpower Trait to retest the effect.

For whatever reason, \nwhen you were created, steps were not taken to make sure you looked \nlike a normal human. For this reason, you suffer a one-Trait penalty \ndealing with non-Technocrats, may not take any Appearance-based \nTraits, and are likely to be chased down like Frankenstein’s monster if \nyou venture out into the everyday world. \nIcr (2 TRAIT \nFLAW) \nYou are so cold and emotionless that even other Technocrats find \nyou creepy.

You may still be a member of the Technocracy, \nbut if you are, it’s only because they haven’t killed you yet. This Flaw \nindicates that you have had your status in the Union changed.

Enjoy the ride. \nFIRH DEGREE \n(S TRAIT \nFMW) \nThis Flaw indicates you are in big trouble with the Union. You are \nunder constant watch by your superiors in the Union, and feel their \nweight upon you. You suffer a three-Trait penalty to all Social tests with \nother Technocrats. The higher-ups still consider you a member of the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nUnion, so you will still get missions and assignments, though they are \nthe worse sort.

Double all internal Requisitions and \nInfluence costs for use within the Technocracv. \nTRADITI~N \n~€IERITS \nAND FLAWS \nThe following Merits and Flaws, translated from the Guide to the \nTraditions, are particularly appropriate for high-magic games. They \nmay not be appropriate for all venues. Storytellers, remember that \nMerits and Flaws are optional - \nthese even more so. \nPHYSICAL \nENHANC~~I-I~NT \n(3* TRAR \nI h u ~ 1  \nYou have some sort of obvious physical enhancement that sets you \napart from human - \nand probably makes you look decidedly demonic. \nThis could be claws, horns, fangs, hooves or a tail with a barb or stinger. \nThese might look mystical, or they could be somewhat mundane (such \nas surgically implanted spikes in your head). One such enhancement \ncosts three Traits. Each additional one costs two Traits. Making a tail \nprehensile costs three Traits. One Trait raises the size to a fairly large \nversion, and two Traits increases to a huge set of horns, claws or \nwhatnot. One Trait also can make such a feature retractable. Each such \nfeature grants you an extra Trait in physical combat (two if it's large, \nthree if it's huge). On the flip side, you're likely to be noticed. \nSo long as you're playing in a private area, you should go out of your \nway to use makeup or prosthetics to represent this Trait. Storytellers \nshould feel free to dock experience from players who demand huge \nhorns for goring their enemies and then just wear a cheesy card taped \nto the forehead. \nANACHRCBNISIII \n(I m 3 TRAIT \nRAW) \nYou're from out of time - \nliterally. You're not familiar with the \nways of the current century. For one Trait, you're more familiar with the \nways of a decade from the previous or next century (maybe you were \nraised in a Technocratic Horizon Construct, or you came from the \npast). For two Traits, raise this to two or three centuries away; for three \nTraits, it's further than that. You may require Mental Challenges to use \nsimple tools and concepts; a 12th-century freeman probably doesn't \nunderstand democracy, and a phone is too primitive for a 24th-century \nman to use. \nFailure to roleplay this Flaw and its consequences may result in the \nStoryteller docking experience to buy it off. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nPERS~NAL \nTALIS~AN \n(I TRAIT \n~TERIT \nCBRFFLAW) \nWhile you're not a master mage yet, you managed to secure help \nfrom one long enough to make a personal Talisman for yourself. This \nminor Talisman has a Trait of your Willpower, so you have one extra \nWillpower as long as you hold it. It's also an arcane connection to you. \nIn conjunction with Backgrounds, it might be a useful Wonder. \nIf you take this as a Merit, you still own the item. As a Flaw, it's in \nsomeone else's hands. \nNINE LIVES (6 TRAIT \n~TERIT) \nFor some reason, you have the luck of a cat.

For an extra Trait, you die instantly if contacted \nby the substance. For another Trait, being in the same room as the Flaw \ncauses you damage.

You don’t know what it is, but something wretched always \nhappens to you at the last minute. Once per game the Storyteller may \nintervene and negate any one success you make completely; no test is \nrequired. \nDISPARATE \nThe Traditions and Technocrats aren’t the only players in the \nbattle for enlightenment. Hidden in the sidelines and among the cracks \nare the Disparates - \nsmall Crafts of independent mages who refuse to \ntake sides and practice separate cultural magics. \nAHLTBATIN \n”Inscrutable” and “confusing” are two words frequently used to \ndescribe the Ahl-i-Batin. Ever since they first revealed themselves to \nother mages, they have always been a mysterious group. Their views on \nunity and faith have carried them through the ages, even when most \nthought they had died out. \nDuring the formation of the Council of Nine, the Ahl-i-Batin were \ninstrumental in contacting mages all over the world and bringing them \ntogether so they might share ideas and debate philosophies. Underlying \nthe Batini’s desire to bring the disparate groups together, though, was \ntheir belief that the true path to enlightenment was through the unity \nof thought and belief. They believed that unity, cemented with faith, \nwould result in a greater good that would bring all Mankind to \nAscension. \nShortly after the forming of the Council of Nine and the events of \nthe First Cabal, the Batini dropped from sight, leaving the Seat of \nCorrespondence empty until the Virtual Adepts defected from the \nTechnocracy. Many believed the Technocracy exterminated the Batini \nwhen they made a push into the Middle East, but over the centuries, \nTradition mages spoke of seeing strange mages using Arabic trappings. \nTheir purpose and goals were unknown; all that could be guessed was \nthat they fought the Technocracy as the Traditions did. \nIn truth the Ahl-i-Batin have always been here - \nthey just chose \nto remain secret. The Ahl-i-Batin had discovered many secrets, and \nhad made just as many enemies, and it was safer for them to “disappear” \nfrom the world. Yet, even while hidden, they altered and manipulated \nfrom the shadows. Quietly they sought to maneuver the Sleepers toward \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAscension, and they remain a considerable power in their homelands \nof the Middle East, even with the incursions of the Technocracy. \nRoleplaying Hints: The Batini are called the Subtle Ones for a \nreasons. The Batini do not isolate themselves to remain hidden, though \n- instead, they integrate themselves wholly. From their hidden \npositions among the Sleepers, the Batini may manipulate Sleepers and \nmages alike. Just as they are able to seamlessly integrate themselves as \nsleepers, however, they can also drop whatever role they play and pick \nup another just as easily -one day a healer, the next a beggar, the next \na taxi driver. The Batini are masters of hiding in plain sight. Many \nBatini count themselves among the faithful of Islamic religions. \nSpecialty Sphere: Correspondence \nCommon Foci: Prayer, meditation, music, dancing, pen and ink \nAdvantage: The Subtle Ways \nThe subtlety of the Ahl-i-Batin has been enforced so strongly by \nthe mages themselves and all who know of them that all Batini start the \ngame with an extra Trait ofArcune. New Batini characters may start the \ngame with up to six Arcane traits. Furthermore, the Subtle Ones may \nenact the Rite of Occultation (see Hidden Paths, page xx) upon \nthemselves and increase their Arcane Traits up to a maximum of 10. \nOnly Batini may uses the Rite of Occultation; it simply does not work \non mages of other Traditions for reasons that have never beenexplained. \nDisadvantage: Removed From Fate \nDue to what some believe to be a Euthanatos curse, or maybe as a \nside-effect of their natural subtlety and seeming invisibility, Batini \nseem to be cut off from the control of Fate, which seems a paradox for \nthe most subtle of all mages to be unable to effect the subtlest of all arts. \nBatini are unable start with or learn Entropy, ever. They essentially are \nall Sphere Inept at Entropy. This Disadvantage may never be bought off \nlike the Flaw. \nSISTERS \nw HIPPWYTA \nThe Sisters of Hippolyta are an extended, entirely female family of \nAwakened willworkers and Enlightened Sleepers. Their historical \nroots lie with the ancient Amazons, but the Sisters of today have little \nin common with their violent, man-hating ancestors. The Sisters live \nmost of their lives in isolated communities called conclaves; in the \nconclaves, they work together to produce food and commodities, \nengage in shared governance, and nurture each other's spiritual growth. \n'/ ' \n;\"J ; \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSome Sisters spend considerable time away from their conclaves, \nworking in the outside world and helping the needy, then bringing back \nskills and tools to the community. Among the Sisters can be found \nphysicians, computer programmers, teachers, accountants, farmers and \nchefs - \nany woman who professes her belief in the Sisters' communal \nlifestyle (with its joys of sisterhood and its isolation from the outside \nworld) is welcome. For all their other duties, the Sisters do not neglect \nthe magical arts. Skilled healers of mind and body, and intuitive \ndiviners of time and nature, these mystics conduct their arts as rituals \nand celebrations of family ties. Their magic glorifies the unique nature \nof women, their voices, their inner strength, their connection to the \nearth and their ability to create life. Each Sister is a power unto herself, \nbut with in the framework of communal magic, the group becomes \nmightier than the individual. \nThe near-fanatical devotion to the group over the individual is the \nthorn of this paradise, though. Those who forsake the community and \nreturn to the outside world are commonly cast from the Craft completely. \nWhether the Sister leaves due to love, familial duty or because of a \ndisagreement is immaterial. While the Craft sanctions temporary \nsojourns, the Sisters consider each member who leaves permanently to \nbe like a thread pulled from the tapestry of the community. In the \nSisters' minds, those who depart and don't return have joined the \nenemy, and their relatives and companions share the blame for their \ndefection. \nRoleplaying Hints: Yes, they are all women, There are no men in \nthe Sisterhood. Period. The Sisters are not man-haters, though - \nthey \nsimply do not believe they can exercise the power of their womanhood \nin the outside world. If a Sister was in a position to help a man in need, \nshe would-not \ndoing so would deny the nurturing nature of a woman's \nheart and lessen the Sisterhood as a whole. The Sisters believe strongly \nin the cycles of birth, life, death and rebirth. They see their ability to \ncreate and bear children as a metaphor for their spirituality which gives \nthem a mystical tie to the power of creation. \nSpecialty Sphere: Life \nCommon Foci: Dance, poetry, song, meditation, massage, techno- \nlogical devices, sex, childbirth \nAdvantage: Sister's Synchronization \nSince its creation, the Sisterhood has approached everything as a \nteam effort. They do not concentrate on the group and the things the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ngroup can accomplish as a one. Because of this, Sisters are very skilled \nin leading and directing people in team efforts, from planting a field, to \nfinding a lost child, to dealing with a wife-beater. In any mass or mob \nchallenge where the Sister is the leader, she has a two-Trait competency \nbonus, and any member of her group may spend an Ability retest for the \ngroup, even if she is not the leader. Only one member of the group may \nmake an Ability retest per challenge. \nDisadvantage: Samantha's Tears \nWomen who live and learn under the Sisters become very used to \ntheir acceptance in the conclave, and when they are in the normal \nworld, they find themselves pining for it. This is not to say the Sisters \nare weak; they just become so used to the environment of the conclave \nthat they suffer an erosion of their morale. To represent this, Sisters \nregain Willpower at half the normal rate of other mages. If the game \nreplenishes willpower at the beginning of each session for easier \nbookkeeping, then Sisterhood characters must spend one extra \nWillpower whenever they spend Willpower. This Disadvantage is \nnegated if the Sister is at one of the few conclaves that the Sisterhood \nruns away from society. \nIn Arabic mythology, there are stories of magi who bound and \ncommanded djinn, rode on flying carpets, and laid curses that make \neven the most malicious Verbena blush. These are the Taftani, born \nfrom the cradle of civilization when Babylon was at its height. These \nwillworkers are thought by some to be the bravest of all mages; others \nsee them as the most absurd. \nThe Taftani worship the ideal of a world of truth and order, and \nfight against the forces of deceit and chaos, which they believe are \nembodied in the Technocracy. The Taftani believe the world as we \nknow it is created by the friction between Asha (the force of truth and \norder) and Druj (the force of chaos and deceit). And the truth is that \nthey have been gifted their power by the ancient gods to shape reality. \nThis entitlement from the gods does not give them the right to do \nmagic, though. It requires them to perform magic as a show of their faith \nand belief in their gods and paradigm. Taftani culture dictates that they \nmust inflict their wills on reality to fight the forces of Druj. \nThe Taftani also represent throwbacks to older times - \ntheir \nmagics are based on the beliefs and practices of ancient Babylon. Their \nfabled King Suleiman the Wise granted them some of their most valued \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nlore, especially the Solomonic Code, the mysterious rules of order that \nall djinn must follow. The Craft's adherence to the old ways has been \na constant stumbling block to the Technocracy's attempts to wipe out \nthe Traditions in the Middle East. How does a Technocratic agent \nconvince a populace that magic is not real and can be explained away \nwith science and logic, when there is a madman on the mountain who \ncan summon djinn and bend them to his will? The Taftani pay dearly \nfor their fidelity to Asha and the gods, however. Most end up dying by \ntheir own hand due to an overabundance of Paradox. They accept this \nas part of the war that they must wage against the Technocracy's \nparadigm. Remarkably enough, the Taftani's constant use of obvious \nand memorable vulgar Effects has been able to jam a wedge in the \nTechnocratic paradigm and halt or push back its advance. The Taftani \nalso have an abhorrence for coincidental Effects, as they see such as \ngiving in to the lies of the Technocracy. It is only through fighting for \nwhat they believe to be the truth and retaining their freedom to act in \nany way that they like that the Taftani have managed to survive. \nRoleplaying Hints: Taftani take a rather arrogant view of their \nposition in the world. They do believe that they have the right to do \nmagic any way they like and everybody else be damned. They carry this \nattitude into everything that they do, and consequently, they do not \npresent themselves as the most sociable of mages, even among each \nother. Taftani hate being limited, even by their own failings; they \nbelieve that the only way to remain free is to keep one's options open. \nBecause of this, they try to be prepared for anything that might happen \nand learn a very broad array of skills so they can meet any situation \nprepared and ready to act. Many apprentices are required by their \nmasters to show aptitude in many different skills before they are taught \nanything of magic. This has a secondary effect, though - \nbecause these \nmages concentrate so much on mastering their mundane abilities, they \nneed not use their devastating and vulgar magics until they are more \nthan ready. \nSpecialty Sphere: Spirit \nCommon Foci: Poetry, art, crafting, swords, bottles and other \nAdvantage: Code of Solomon \nTaftani apprentices are taught early on about the Solomonic Code, \nhow it applies to the beings of the Invisible World, and the rules that \nall spirits must follow. By applying their knowledge, Taftani are able to \nmanipulate certain spirits much easier than most other mages. In all \nvessels, prayer \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ndealings with djinn, Banes and elementals, Taftani have a two-Trait \ncompetency bonus to any Social Challenges with those spirits. \nThe Taftani do not attempt to hide their Resonance, and see it as \na badge of identity and honor. A Taftani with little Resonance is \nobviously not trying to reawaken the magic in the world like his \nbrethren, and is likely to be snubbed by them. Further, suppressing one's \nResonance is seen as suppressing the truth of oneself and a mortal \naffront to the gods from whom magic springs. A Taftani who has very \npronounced Resonance displays it proudly, and is respected and revered \nby his fellows. Because of the feeling of self-worth that this high \nResonance gives, a Taftani with a combined number of Entropic and/ \nor Dynamic Resonance Traits equaling five receives a bonus Social \nTrait of Confident. A combined number of Entropic and Dynamic \nTraits equaling 10 grants a second Confident Trait. \nDisadvantage: Accepting the Lie \nThe Taftani abhor coincidental magic because they feel it only \nstrengthens the structure of the Technocracy. Only by resisting what \nthey perceive as the problem can they defeat the lie that permeates \nreality. Because of these strong beliefs, a Taftani must spend a Willpower \nTrait in order to accept the lie for one round and perform a coincidental \nEffect. This penalty does not apply if they are creating an Effect in an \narea where their paradigm is supported, such as their Sanctum or an \nUmbral Realm. \nMost people have heard the history of the Templars, an order of \nknights founded in 11 19 to protect pilgrims on the roads to Jerusalem. \nDuring the Crusades, they were regarded as some of the most brave and \nvaliant warriors; they were the first into battle and the last to retreat (in \nfact, one of their tenets forbade retreat). The Templars not only became \nmilitarily successful but economically powerful, and this led to many \nrumors. After the fall of Jerusalem to the Muslims, the rumors became \naccusations, and in 1307 King Philip the Fair of France ordered all \nTemplar Knights arrested on charges of heresy. Most of the knights \nrecanted their \"heresy\" and joined other orders as penance, except for \nJacques de Molay, the Grand Master of the order. He claimed that there \nwas no heresy among the Knights Templar, and before his execution he \nstated that Philip the Fair and the Pope would stand with him before \nGod's Throne in judgment before the end of the year; both of them died \nin that same year. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThis is the history that the Sleepers know. In actuality, the Knights \nTemplar were allied with the Cabal of Pure Thought, a member of the \nOrder of Reason, and when the accusations of heresy were handed \ndown, the remaining Templars went underground and joined the \nCabal’s membership. From their shelter, the Templars shepherded \nChristendom while remaining out of sight. During the turbulent years \nof the Reformation, the Templars grew to see all of Christendom as their \ncharge, and began to limit their foes to the supernatural enemies of \nChrist. In 1837, the Order of Reason came to the conclusion that \nreligion and faith were superstitious tripe to be expunged from Consensual \nreality, and any who strengthened religion needed to be removed. The \nOrder attacked the Templars and killed many of them, but those who \nretreated and survived went even deeper underground. \nThe Templars exist today as a secret magical order that follows four \nmajor tenets, known as the Edicts of the Just - \n1) Strive to create anew \nChristendom that is not created in the image of the Order of Reason; \n2) Defend the innocent from the horrors of the supernatural and \ninfernal; 3) Defeat the Order of Reason and gain justice for their \nbetrayal and their promulgation of irreligion; and 4) Preserve the Order \nitself, with secrecy being the paramount directive. Over the past 150 \nyears, the Order of Knights Templar have persevered, never surrender- \ning, knowing that their mission to shepherd and protect the innocent \nin the name of God is what has brought them through all their past \ndifficulties. \nRoleplaying Hints: The Knights Templar are not all Catholic as \nthey used to be and now encompass all of Christendom. They just \nrequire that their Knights agree on the primacy of the Gospel, and \ndoctrinal argument within the Order is forbidden; theological debate is \nbest left to theologians not warriors. And Templars do not fight for the \nascension of mankind, they instead work to restore Christendom to \nwhat it was in ancient and believe that when this is done shall herald \nfor the Reconciliation of God and the Salvation of the entire world. But \nit is very hard to do this with sword and shield; they now fight these \nbattles with words in court rooms, universities, and parliaments; quietly \nthey manipulate man and shepherd him into the loving arms of Christ. \nSpecialty Sphere: Forces \nCommon Foci: Bibles, altars, Eucharist, hymnal, crosses or cruci- \nAdvantage: Apocalyptic Destiny \nfixes, flagellation, guns, knightly mantle, shields, sword, prayer \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe Templar knights do not merely believe they are the chosen \nwarriors of Christendom - \nthey know they are such. They know that \nthey are the guardians of the innocent in the coming Apocalypse, and \nare prepared to face their destiny head on. Because of this knowledge, \nTemplars get an extra number of traits of Destiny equal to their Arete \nrating (up to a maximum of five). These are bonus Destiny Traits and \nadd on to any Destiny Traits bought at character creation. As the \ncharacter increases his Arete rating, his Destiny also increases with it. \nA Templar character may have greater than five Destiny because of his \nbonus Traits, but still is limited to a Destiny x 5 when buying the Traits \nat character creation. Also the bonus Destiny of the Templar character \ncannot be removed by the Storyteller until -well, until the Storyteller \nhappens to run the Apocalypse, and then the bonus Destiny is gone \nbecause it has been fulfilled. \nDisadvantage: Scourge of God \nPart of the oath of becoming a Templar is to be humble in the eyes \nof God and to accept His judgment above all others. Templars believe \nthat Paradox is God showing His disfavor over something that the \nTemplar has done. Because of this, Templars believe that they must \ntake the judgment of God immediately because to make God wait is the \nhighest form of hubris. Whenever a Templar spends a Willpower Trait \nin order to hold off a Paradox Flaw or backlash, he is at a Trait penalty \nequal to the number of accumulated Paradox on all magical Effect tests. \nThis penalty immediately goes away after the Paradox has been allowed \nto dissipate. \nThe Wu Keng did not start off as a Craft unto themselves. Originally, \nthey were disparate shamans who tended to the spiritual matters of their \nhome villages. They were brought together when their practices were \noutlawed by the secular Chou dynasty around 1000 BC. Many of the Wu \navoided death by pursuing scholarly endeavors, while others maintained \ntheir shamanistic practices. Ofthe few who remained in their ancestors' \nvillages, tending to the spirits for the villagers, some wished to restore the \ngreatness of the past. Banding together, these shamans and scholars \nformed the Wu Keng, and they guarded the secrets of the spirit world \npreparing for a time when their lore would be necessary. To insure their \nsuccess they made a deal with the ancient spirits of Feng-tu, the land of \nthe dead. These spirits promised that after three millennia of devout \nservice, they would renew the power and authority of the Wu Keng over \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthe affairs of man. There was a catch, though - \nthe magi would have to \nremain hidden and stay behind the scenes of the civilized world, using \ntheir magics only in the subtlest ways; and any who they taught would also \nbecome servants of the spirits. \nThough the Wu Keng survived, they suffered greatly at the hands \nof their masters. During their most grueling trial, the entire Craft was \ncaptured and imprisoned by the cruel First Emperor Qin Shihuang and \ntortured mercilessly. The Feng-tu masters of the Wu Keng came to their \nrescue, but exacted payment for their assistance. The spirits ordered the \nWu Keng to dress and act as women for the remainder of their service - \nthe Yin energy of doing so would balance the aggressive Yang energy \nand make them subtler. As part of this punishment, and as a reminder \nof the shame of being captured, all Wu Keng had to bind their feet in \nthe traditional Chinese way, resulting in slender mutilated feet that \nforced them to take mincing (and painful) steps. Further, they could not \nalleviate the pain by any means. \nNow, with the third millenniaof their service just past, the Wu Keng \nfind that their founders, the Chou-an, have betrayed them. The Chou- \nan were the six remaining shamans from the Chou dynasty, and, \naccording to the spirits of Feng-tu, betrayed the pact by teaching their arts \nto others who were not made servants of the spirits. Because of this, the \nspirits of Feng-tu have extended the deal for another millennia, and \nadded another clause to it: The Wu Keng are to find all the Chou-an and \ntheir pupils and destroy them. This has a new catch, however - \nthe \nspirits of Feng-tu will not let the Wu Keng teach any new mages, unless \nit is a replacement for one who has died. The oldest of the Wu Keng \ncontinually plead to the spirits to let them swell their ranks to fight this \nwar in which they are finding they are outnumbered, but their pleas \nalways fall on deaf ears. \nRoleplaying Hints: Yes, the Wu Keng are all cross-dressing male \nmages; this means that players should either dress themselves as women \nor be women. Yes, they serve otherworldly masters. The Wu Keng do \nnot think too much about their pact with the spirits of Feng-tu, and \ninstead busy themselves with doing their masters' bidding, because \ntarrying on a task brings quick and painful punishment. Wu Keng tend \nto act like traditional Chinese women, quiet and humble, their feet \nbound, in remembrance of their shame. The Wu Keng do not actively \nhunt their wayward brethren, mainly because the spirits of Feng-tu keep \nthem busy on other tasks, but they will attempt to destroy anythey find. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSpecialty Sphere: Forces \nCommon Foci: Painting, calligraphy, poetry, language, wood carv- \nAdvantage: Wedding Gift of Feng-Tu \nDuring character creation, the player may choose an Effect up to \nDisciple level to have as a permanent Effect (subject to Storyteller \napproval). These “gifts” are given to the mage by his Feng-tu “mate” and \nmaster as rewards for faithful service. These gifts are not truly magical, \ndo not gamer Paradox, and are not eroded by disbelief. The gift chosen \nmay not be a Spirit or Time Effect, and may not be a conjunctional \nSphere Effect. The Effect may not have any extra grades of success. \nWith Storyteller permission, a mage may take an extra gift, but the \ncharacter also receives five Traits in Flaws of the Storyteller’s choosing. \nDisadvantage: Mandates of Feng-tu \nAll Wu Keng are forced to dress and live like traditional Chinese \nwomen, to counteract the Yang of their male natures and bring them \nmore into balance. Because of this, they receive the Negative Social \nTrait: Passive. The Wu Keng are also forced to bind their feet in the \ntraditional way, a practice that is painful and crippling. They receive \nthe Negative Physical Trait: Lame from this. \nThe Feng-tu spirits do not approve of their “wives” practicing the \narts of Spirit or Time magic. Therefore, the Wu Keng are forbidden to \nlearn or use either any way. In game terms, Wu Keng characters may \nnever learn any levels of the Spirit or Time Spheres. If a Wu Keng uses \na Device or Wonder that works with Time or Spirit magic, he gains \nParadox equal to the Wonder’s level, as he has angered his master and \nis punished harshly. \n~ \nA group of mysterious old women are the founders of this Craft, \nteaching the young to dance in the halls of the gods and speak with the dead \nas the old shamans of China once did before the Chou Dynasty outlawed \nsuch practices. These six women traveled throughout eastern and \nsoutheastern Asia in search of potential students. They sought those who \ncould still touch the spirits of their loved ones, and they sought the \nlink to the spirit world. They gathered their students into circles, teaching \n9, \n1 :. \n, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ngods. Each circle was taught quickly, then a new circle of pupils was \ngathered. Over a two-year period, the little group of subtle ladies created a \nformidable number of shamans. \nThe mysterious teachers taught their pupils, called the Wu Nung, \ntwo things. The first lesson was the ways to woo and flatter the gods and \nthe etiquette required to gain their favor. The second lesson was on the \nways of demons, specifically how to fight them effectively. The Wu \nNung returned to their communities, from squalid inner cities to far- \nflung farming villages, and took up the mantle as spiritual guides of their \ncommunities. They rebuilt belief and respect for the spirits and old gods, \nslowly bringing back the culture of old China. In many places, the \nShamans are still persecuted by the secular state, but they are usually \nhidden and supported by their faithful communities. \nThe numbers of the Wu Nung grew by leaps and bounds. The \ngroups taught by the beneficial old ladies spread and took on more \napprentices and taught them the ways of the gods. Then, almost \novernight, things changed for the worse. Early in 2001, the beneficial \nladies, who were the most learned among them, disappeared and have \nnot been seen since. Soon after, there were reports of groups of Shamans \nbeing attacked by ladies like their original teachers. Many of their \nnumber have died at the hands of this mysterious new threat that they \ndo not fully understand. Rumors claim that these are old students of the \nbeneficial ladies who have somehow fallen from the grace of the gods. \nThe Wu Nung now build their number in preparation for what they see \nas a coming war. \nRoleplaying Hints: The Wu Nung's magic comes from their \nconsorting with the old Chinese gods and spirits of the dead. They write \npoetry to these gods to gain their favor and attention, but there are very \nstrict protocols that must be observed with each god to keep from \nangering them. The Shamans commonly go through many steps in the \ncreation of a single Effect, and even after the Effect has been done, they \nmake sure that the gods are sufficiently appeased. These practices \nbecome part of their daily lives; for example, they pray over a meal to \nthree different gods in thanks for the meal itself, the fire that cooked it, \nand the spirits of the animals and plants that gave of themselves for it. \nA peasant Shaman is likely to be considered a superstitious person who \ndoes odd things at odd times in appeasement for different spirits and \ngods. Usually they are small acts of supplication and thanks, but they \nbecome far more elaborate rituals to court the spirits' affections and \nattention in the workings of something major. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSpecialty Sphere: Spirit \nCommon Foci: Painting, calligraphy, poetry, language, wood carv- \nAdvantage: Oni Slayer \nThe mysterious mentors of the Wu Nung hinted that they had served \ndemonic masters in the past, and had recorded the weaknesses, strengths, \nneeds and desires of their masters during that service. They taught this \nknowledge to the Wu Nung, impressing on them the necessity of fighting \nfire with fire. This training gives Shamans an advantage when fighting \ndemons and Banes. The Wu Nung receives a one-Trait training bonus to \nany challenge when in combat against a demon or Bane. This bonus applies \nif the mage is initiating or defending against a challenge with a demon or \nBane, or if she attempts to perform an Effect against such a beast. \ning, sewing, flower arranging, feng shui \nDisadvantage: Loss of the A-ma \nAbout a year ago, the mentors of the Shamans disappeared. It is \nbelieved by some that they are in hiding and will come to the aid of the \nShamans when they need it. Others believe some evil force discovered that \nthey were teaching the lost ways and destroyed them. All that is known is \nthat the mentors of the Shamans are gone, and the Wu Nung must now \nteach themselves how to carry on the mission. In game terms a Shaman \ncannot start with the Mentor or Library Backgrounds, and any Spheres \nabove Disciple level must be taught to them by a mage of another Tradition. \nSome people are raised in certain paradigms, then learn about \nothers, and grow to combine the beliefs, fears and differing aspects of \nreality into one cohesive worldview. Everybody does this - \nit is a \nnatural way of life and a way of evolving with the changing times and \nthe shrinking of the world. We are born into one culture, but have easy \nexposure to other cultures and tend to take parts of those cultures into \nour own. We accept their art, their stories and even parts of their \nlanguage without too much thought. Because the culture we live in \nchanges, the world culture globalizes. But this mixing of paradigms and \nbeliefs has a very profound effect on the World of Darkness. \nEach culture is built on certain mythic threads, bits of mythology and \nbelief that endure even in the Technocratic society of today. These \nthreads are the reason why some things can be done with magic and some \nthings cannot. Certain mythic threads are more powerful in some places \nthan others because the culture supports them in one place and does not \nin another. For instance, in Ireland the mythic thread of “the little \nTHE \n@RPHANS \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\npeople,” the fae and the spirits of the land is still very strong. People report \nseeing evidence of a brownie or a selkie, and they warn their children \naway from certain moors saying they are haunted by the bane-sidhe. \nVerbena and their magic find few challenges to certain Effects in this \nregion because of the strength of those particular mythic threads. Were \nthat same Verbena to visit midwestern America and attempt the same \nfeats, she’d get a rude surprise because the mythic threads have changed. \nIn the Midwest, the mythic thread speaks of cattle mutilations and crop \ncircles caused by strange little gray men. Both beliefs are of the same \nmythic thread - \nthe wild things from parts unknown with mysterious \npowers - \nbut viewed through different lenses. \nThese mythic threads are important to mages because it is through \nthese that they form their own magical paradigms. Some leniency is \nexpected in the way that individual members within a Tradition view \nmythic threads, but for the most part all the mages of that Tradition \nbelieve in and follow those threads. What can happen is that sometimes \nthese mixing and clashing cultures can create a confusing welter of \nmythic threads within an individual. While this is usually not a \nproblem, sometimes these people come to an epiphany and Awaken. \nUsually it is quite sudden, and goes unnoticed by other mages in the \narea. Some of these are later discovered by a Tradition or the Hollow \nOnes and taught to control their powers; others destroy themselves \naccidentally with a vulgar Effect. Still others simply wander about, lost \nin a world they no longer understand. It is a rare Orphan who is able to \nteach himself how to control his own power and avoid killing himself \nin the process. Those who are discovered by a Tradition rarely become \nproductive members of their adoptive Tradition. These lost mages tend \nto move from Tradition to Tradition looking for bits and pieces of \ninformation that sound like truth to them, learning what they can here \nand there but never quite grasping hold of one paradigm completely. \nOrphans are commonly taken in by the Hollow Ones, who see \nkindred spirits in those who have been so royally screwed by the magical \nworld. This feeling of being of kindred may be quite true as the Hollow \nOnes rarely fit into any one grouping of mystical ideas, like the \nOrphans. And like the Orphans, the Hollow Ones are not usually \nrespected by the established Traditions and Conventions because their \nbelief structure does not match that of the more established groups. \nHere is where the similarities end, though. Orphans tend to be their \nown people and do not necessarily buy into the Hollower idea that the \nworld is doomed to decay and destruction. The Orphans are also not \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncounterculture revolutionaries as many of the Hollow Ones claim to be. \nThey are in fact the most extreme of individualists, creating their own \nindividual paradigms that may be bits and pieces of others meshed \ntogether but in the end something that is wholly unique to the Orphan. \nSo, if Orphans hold this special place in Limbo when it comes to \nother mages, then how do they do certain things like learn rotes and \nSpheres? Must they teach themselves everything from the ground up? \nMostly, they do have to teach themselves everything. A Storyteller may \nwant to include one some, or all of the optional rules below to flesh out \nthe special lifestyle that Orphans must lead in the World of Darkness. \nSometimes an Orphan exhibits traits of more than one Tradition. \nOrphans in this situation usually start by learning with one Tradition \nand then moving on to learn with another one when the original \nTradition does not fit in with the rest of their beliefs. With the \nStoryteller's approval, the Orphan may take the specialty Sphere of one \nTradition and take the other Tradition's specialty Sphere as a faction \nSphere. The Orphan also takes the Tradition Flaw from the Tradition \nhis specialty Sphere comes from and the Tradition Advantage from the \nTradition his faction Sphere comes from. The only exception to this is \nthat no Orphan may have the Order of Hermes Tradition Advantage, \nas it is completely dependant on the clout and backing of the Order of \nHermes. The Orphan would not be able to use that Advantage unless \nhe trained with and became accepted as a member of the Order of \nHermes, which is highly unlikely. \n@ F T I ~ A L  \nRULES \nF@R BRPHANS \n~ I X E D  \nPARADIGITI \n'FLAWS [ G ~ P T I ~ A L  \nRULE) \nAVATAR \nFILTER \n(G~PTICBNAL RULE) \nSome Orphans are born with Avatars that are, for lack of a better \nterm, confused. Such Avatars force these mages to become Orphans \nbecause they are nothing but chaotic whirlwinds of paradigms and \nideas. An Orphan with a chaotic Avatar must learn everything on her \nown because her Avatar, which ultimately determines the mage's \nability to use magic, is continually shifting the paradigm. Orphans so \ncursed require twice as long to learn any new Spheres or rotes - \nthey \nare spending all that time in guesswork and experimentation as they \nfumble their way through creating Effects. \nOn the plus side, these mages' Avatars also result in very flexible \nparadigms, and every new discovery that the mages make in their \nSphere also gives them new ways to focus their magic. It gives them a \nI \n3; \nf \n, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nlittle more insight into the natures of their unique Avatars, and a little \nmore choice in how they wield their magic. In game terms, every time \nan Orphan increases his level in a Sphere, he may choose a new \nspecialty focus for that Sphere or make a specific item used as a focus a \nunique focus. \nDWT%XJRSELF PARA DIG^ (@PTI~NAL RULE) \nYour average Orphan Awakens with his own preconceived notions \nof the world and the way reality works. Orphans do not have a society \nof mages to guide them and teach them about the magic, so they tend \nto create their own magical paradigms as both a mental defense for the \nshock of Awakening, and to be able to actually manipulate their newly \ndiscovered power. Because they start with no Traditions to guide them, \nthey do not start with the Advantages of any of the Traditions, but \nlikewise they do not start with the Weaknesses. \nThe player should create a paradigm for the character, and choose \nbetween five and 10 common foci that the character would use to \nmanipulate magical energies. The player also starts with no specialty \nSphere. The Orphan starts as a tabula m a  as mages go and forges her \nown paradigm in the magical World of Darkness. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nIn addition to the rotes and Wonders sampled in Laws of Ascen- \nsion, a near-infinite variety of other magical happenings is possible. In \norder to broaden mage options (especially in games that don't use \ndynamic magic) and simply to offer examples of what mages do with \nmagic from day to day, this chapter includes a lengthy listing of rotes, \nWonders and other magics that you can try out for your games. \nARCH~AGE \nSPHERES \n( @ P T I ~ A L  RULE) \nThis rule only works if you're reudy to have tremendously powerful \nmages in a long-running chronicle. \nAs chronicles advance and characters become more powerful, \nthere may come a point when a character is able learn Spheres above \nthe Master level, by Mastering a given Sphere and raising Arete above \nfive Traits. This optional rule facilitates the use of Spheres above the \nMaster level. \nThe additional levels of magic beyond Advanced level are Superior, \nExceptional, Ascendant and Transcendent, all of which are classed as \nArchmaster-rank Spheres. Higher levels of Spheres grant a mage much \ngreater efficiency in all magical workings with that Sphere. Furthermore, \nthey provide benefits in concrete, physical terms, allowing a mage to \nexpand slightly beyond human limitations. Each level of a Sphere \nbeyond the Master level allows the mage to gain (with experience) one \nadditional Attribute Trait above and beyond all other capabilities, \naccording to the Sphere's association: Life, Matter and Forces to Physical; \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nEntropy, Spirit and Prime to Social; Mind, Correspondence and Time to \nMental. Archmages thus can have very high Trait maximums, if the \n\"Beyond Human Limits\" optional rule is in effect (see Laws of Ascen- \nsion p. 123). \nGaining an archmage Sphere grants a sixth Reputation Trait. No \nfurther Reputation is earned for levels beyond this. \nWhen an archmage performs an Effect that uses one of his \nArchmaster Spheres, he automatically gains an additional number of \ngrades of success equal to his levels exceeding Master. Thus, using \nArchmaster (Superior) Forces grants one extra grade of success on any \nForces Effect. Invoking this bonus costs one Quintessence Trait, but \nthat single Trait is sufficient to grant all applicable levels. Aconjunctional \nEffect gains bonuses only according to the single highest Sphere \nknowledge used (so the Archmaster will often be tempted to build new \nrotes using his Archmaster Sphere, in order to gain the bonus successes \n- \nwhich is one reason that Archmasters often become known for \nhaving a favorite Sphere). \nLearning Archmaster-level Spheres takes twice as long as usual \n(four sessions per Sphere level, or two for a specialty Sphere). The \nSuperior level costs 16 experience, Exceptional costs 20 experience, \nAscendant costs 24 experience and Transcendent costs 28 experience \nTraits as a specialty Sphere. For a non-specialty Sphere, the cost is 201 \n25/30/35. \nTHE C@NT€ST€D \n%T \nRULE \n(CBPTICBNAL RULE) \nThis rule only works if you believe strongly that no magical Effect should \nbe a sure thing. \nSome rotes or Effects might not always list a need for a challenge. \nEven if not listed, assume that a challenge is always required for an \nEffect that has an immediate, direct effect on a character - \nwhether it \nmeans dropping a conjured piano on someone or striking with a curse \nthat causes infertility 10 years later. The caster, after performing the \nEffect, must make a follow-up challenge against the target. The Traits \nused depend upon the spell: aiming the conjured piano mentioned \nabove would pit the caster's Mental Traits against the target's Physical \nTraits. In general, attacks on the body use Physical, mental and occult \nattacks use Mental, and spiritual or emotional attacks use Social. \nGRADES a= \nPBWER (CBPTI~NAL RULE) \nThis rule only works if you want mges to risk casting more powerful \nspells in order to have a stronger chance at affecting their targets, especially \nfor mages with high Arete and Sphere levels. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe \"grades of power\" rule assumes that, when a mage generates \ngrades of success for a spell, these could potentially be used to make the \nspell more powerful in its targeting, instead of increasing its duration or \narea. A caster may trade one grade of success for two additional Traits \nin any follow-up challenge resolution, such as the test to strike an \nenemy with a conjured lightning bolt or to penetrate a mind shield. \nThis could even precipitate an overbid. Remember, though, that no \namount of modifiers can raise a character's Trait total for a challenge \nabove double the character's normal number of unaided Traits in a \ngiven Attribute (that is, a mage who normally has seven Physical Traits \ncan never bid more than 14 Physical Traits in a challenge, regardless of \naids and bonuses). \nThree months \nEXTENDED \nGRADES w DURATI~N \n(@PTI~NAL RULE) \nThis rule only works if you feel the need for a much larger scope of lasting \nEffects in your game, beyond the grades presented in the core rules. \nSometimes a player is going to want to create an Effect that he \nwants to last for much longer than the basic rules allow. It is suggested \nthat no Effect should be created to last for more than one month, but \ndepending on how you wish to run your game and the scope of the game \nthat you are playing, having Effect durations longer than a month may \nbe needed. Set out below is a quick chart for the grades of duration \nbeyond one month. \nFor these Effects, the character is going to have expend more than \nthe normal amount of energy to extend the duration to the levels listed \nbelow. The reason this extra energy has to be expended is because the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nEffect has to stand up to the erosive effects of consensual reality. Even \nlong-lasting coincidental Effects will eventually be worn away. To \nsimulate this, beside each grade of success is a listing for any extra grades \nof success that have to be expended past the normal grades of success for \nextra grades of duration. For example, if Gary wants to increase the \nduration of an Effect that has a standard duration of one month to two \nyears, then he would have to spend 1 1 grades of success -five for each \ngrade of duration as listed below, plus six more for the extra cost (one \nfor two months, three months, six months and 12 months; and two \nmore for two years). \nSHAPECHANGING \nShapechanging is one of those sticky areas in a LARP because it \ntakes the greatest amount of suspension of disbelief of all the players to \nbe able to roleplay with it properly. For this reason you may want to limit \nhow you allow mages to use shapechanging Effects. Listed below are \nsome examples of ways to deal with shapechanging rotes and a few \nexamples of such rotes that may show up in your game. \nAppearance Changes \nThese changes are done to conceal a character’s appearance either \nfor stealth or subterfuge. When a mage is concealing her features in this \nway, the player should either hold her chin with her hand, or hold her \nhand in front of her face, to represent that she does not look the way that \nother characters would recognize her. If necessary the player should \nannounce to people out of character what she looks like when she does \nthat. Listed below are three variations on disguising effects. \nHello, my name is...: Adept Mind. This rote, created by a rather \nresourceful Hollow One, has been adopted by other Traditions in \ndiffering forms. The Hollower would take a “Hello, my name is ...” \nsticker and write on it the name of what she wanted to look like. Doing \nthis took advantage of the fact that most people took things they saw \nfor granted. Whatever she wrote on the tag and stuck on herself was \nwhat people saw - \nshe drew a small badge, and people saw a cop; she \nwrote “Bob Dole” and looked like an impotent presidential candidate. \nThe Effect does not allow the mage to look inhuman or inanimate. Any \nperson who is interacting with the mage under this Effect, and has some \nform of heightened sensory perception, may make a Mental Challenge \nagainst three times the mage’s Arete Traits to notice there is something \nwrong with what he is seeing. Technological devices are not fooled by \nthis Effect. The Effect lasts for one minute/conflict. Grades of Success: \nIncrease the grade of duration. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCamouflage Field Generator: Disciple Forces. This rote, created by \nthe Sons of Ether, uses etheric manipulation to form a pattern of light \naround the user so he appears as another person. Etherites commonly \nuse this Effect to make their robotic minions look like regular people as \nthey are walking around in public. The field can make the affected \ntarget look like anything that is the same general shape and size of the \ntarget. Sometimes, though, the field does not show the proper interaction \nwith exterior stimuli - \nfor instance, the image’s hair might stay perfect \nin a stiff breeze. Any person who is interacting with the mage under this \nEffect may make a Mental Challenge against the caster to notice that \nthere is something wrong with what she is seeing. Technological \ndevices are just as fooled as anybody else by this Effect. The Effect lasts \nfor one minute/conflict. Grades of Success: Increase the grade of \nduration. \nButcher’s Disguise: Disciple Life. Some of the more pain-oriented \nCultists use this rote to help disguise themselves or to change their faces \ndramatically. The mage uses a razor blade to cut his face and molds it \ninto the appearance that he wants to have. The new face lasts for one \nminute/conflict. When he is done, the mage looks different than when \nhe began. The process is quite painful and causes two lethal wounds that \ncannot be healed for as long as the Effect’s duration. When the duration \nends, the mage heals the damage and his face returns to its original \nshape. The mage has two choices when doing this Effect: he may make \nhimself look like a different person, or he may increase his Social Traits \ntemporarily. If the mage makes himself look like a different person, \nthere is no real way for anybody to see what is really underneath since \nthe mage is changed physically. A character who knows the person \nbeing imitiated might use an Investigation Social Challenge to realize \nthat the mage isn’t who he appears to be. If the mage changes his Social \nTraits, he may add three Traits relating to Appearance or intimidation. \nGrades of Success: Increase the grade of duration. \nANImAL F@ms \nThere are two rotes in the main book dealing with taking on animal \nforms: Mutate F o m  (Adept Life) and Perfect Metamorphosis (Master \nLife). Both of these create their own minor problems in game when the \nplayer needs to make a representation of herself as said animal. Some \nsuggestions are for the player to crawl around on all fours, like an \nanimal, or to wear a mask of the animal in question. An equally good \noption for those players who are not spryly built or are poor is to hold \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nyour hands up at about shoulder height right up against the body with \nthe palms facing away from you. \n& I ~ L  IFmrr~ KNCBWLEDGE \n(@PTI~BNAL RULE) \nThis rule only works if you want a little more “realism” in your \nshapeshifting at the expense of more complexity. \nRealistically, if you were suddenly changed into a bird, would you \nknow exactly how to flap your wings to be able to take flight? If you were \nto shape-change into a wolf, would you be able to decipher the sudden \nincrease in your range of olfactory senses and deal with the fact that your \nsight was now only black and white? You probably would be caught off \nguard while in your new form, and so it would be with your character. \nIt would take practice for you to actually use this new form to its fullest \nextent. To simulate this difficulty with the new form, a character must \nbid an additional Trait to enter any challenge as an unfamiliar shape \npenalty. With practice, the shapeshifting mage could become used to \nthe new senses and body and eliminate the penalty. This knowledge \nmay be either bought with experience, or a magnanimous Storyteller \nmight grant the knowledge with the appropriate amount of practice \n(one month is usually good). Each Knowledge Ability is specifically \ntailored to one animal form and one alone. For instance, Bob is playing \na Dreamspeaker named Wind Walker who has Animal Knowledge: \nEagles. Wind Walker enjoys soaring in the clouds and watching the \nearth below. Today, though, he needs stealth, not soaring ability, so he \nchanges himself into an owl; he suffers the unfamiliar shape penalty. He \nsees what he needs to see, and changes into a human form, but not his \nown; since he has been a human his entire life, he suffers no penalty \nfrom this form. He then decides to change shape one more time into a \nhawk. This time, he receives no penalty, because a hawk and an eagle \nhave the same general body form. \nBESTIAL Pmms \nEventually you are going to have a character who researches or \ncreates a rote that changes him into something that is neither animal \nnor human but some type of amalgam between the two. These Effects \nare almost universally Paradoxical - \nhow do you explain to reality that \nit’s perfectly acceptable for you to be 20-foot-tall, half-man, donkey- \ncreature with lobster claws? The most difficult part about these \nshape-changes is representing them in play without Tom Savini or Ray \nHarryhausen doing your props for you. A suggestion is to have the \nplayers hold their hands above their head with their fingers out \nstretched. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nA couple examples of bestial forms are below, but your players will \nundoubtedly think up even more bizarre creations than these. \nIron Avatar: Disciple Life, Disciple Matter, Initiate Mind, Initiate \nPrime. By attuning herself to the essence of Kali, a Euthanatos may take \non the guise of goddess (male members of the Tradition channel the \nform of Shiva). Iron daggers appear in the mage’s hands, and six arms \nsprout from her shoulders. The mage also grows to a height of 10 feet, \nand her skin turns black as night. While in this form, the mage gains \nthree extra Physical Traits from the extra arms and blades, and gains an \nextra attack each turn immediately after her initial attack for the turn. \nThe transformation lasts for one combat round, after which the mage \nis exhausted and may not initiate any further challenges for the session. \nGrades of Success: One grade gives the mage an extra Healthy health \nlevel per grade spent. One grade of success increases the grade of \nduration per grade of success spent up to a maximum of one scene/ hour. \nOne grade of success increases the bonus Physical Traits by three. \nAvatar Form: Disciple Life, Disciple Mind, Disciple Prime. By \nbringing mind, body and soul into alignment, an Akashic Brother may \nproject his Avatar’s form through his own physical body. The mage’s \nskin turns blue and becomes as tough as wood. He also sprouts four extra \narms that can be controlled as normal, because the Mind part of the \nEffect divides the mind in the ways necessary for controlling the extra \narms naturally. The mage’s hands glow with a white-blue light of Prime \nenergy. While in this form, the mage gains one extra Healthy health \nlevel, and his Do attacks cause aggravated damage. The transformation \nlasts for only one turn. The mage’s Avatar rating is reduced to zero, and \nhe loses all Quintessence stored in his Pattern. When the session ends, \nhis Avatar rating returns to normal and he may store Quintessence in \nhis Pattern again. Grades of Success: One grade of success increases the \ngrade of duration by one per grade spent on it, up to a maximum of one \nscene/ hour. One grade gives the mage an extra action that occurs \nimmediately after the character’s initial attack for the turn; one extra \nattack is gained for each grade of success spent in this way. One grade \nof success gives the mage an extra Healthy health level. \nWonders come in all shapes and sizes, of course; the trick lies in \ndetermining the Wonder’s capabilities and in assigning it an appropriate \nvalue. The sample Wonders here serve not only as potential additions \nto a game, but also as guidelines for the capabilities of other Wonders. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe broad, separate classifications for Wonders are: \nArtifact - \nAn Artifact is a Wonder with some sort of invoked or \ncontinuous mystical power. Body armor enhanced by Technocratic \nmaterial science is an Artifact, because it relies on physically enhanced \nproperties outside the bounds of normal science. An Artifact costs one \nTrait per level of the Sphere magic involved. Thus, if an item has a \nDisciple-level Effect, it is a three-Trait Wonder. An Artifact’s Effect \ntypically has only the base success for the rote or Sphere in question. At \nthe Storyteller’s discretion, an Artifact might have extra grades of \nsuccess built in for extra Traits (typically on a one-for-one basis). \nCham - \nA Charm is a small, single-use, disposable item, such as \na magic potion or candle. Once it’s used, its effect takes place, but the \nitem is gone. A Charm generally works just like an Artifact. It costs one \nless Trait, however, and counts as a set of 10. Therefore, a set of 10 \nCharms that invoke a Disciple-level Sphere would cost two Traits. All \nCharms in a set have the same power. \nFetish- Spirits bound into material objects can grant their powers \nas a type of Wonder. Generally, equate the spirit’s power to a rote of the \nsame type; the cost equals a number of Traits equal to the Sphere levels \ninvolved. Since spirit powers aren’t Paradoxical and just about anyone \ncan use them, Fetishes have great advantages. On the downside, the \nspirit might come loose or run out of Power, or simply refuse to work for \nsome users. In some cases, a mage must best the spirit in a psychic \ncontest (a continuous series of Mental Challenges, with the loser losing \none Willpower Trait each time until a victor emerges) or else grant it \nPower (through Quintessence, typically one Trait each time the user \ninvokes the Fetish). \nPeriapt - \nA Periapt is a power source. Every Trait invested in a \nPeriapt grants it five Quintessence of storage space. A Periapt typically \n~ \nE \n: \ncomes charged, but the mage must see to recharging it with Prime after \nusing its power. Like a battery, the Periapt’s Quintessence may be spent \nand then restored. \nTalisman - \nRare Talismans hold a small piece of the creator’s will. \nA Talisman typically has a single Trait of Arete, at a cost of one Trait. \nThis allows the Talisman to invoke Spheres invested into it at the same \ncost as an Artifact. Since the Talisman performs the work, it’s usable \neven by a Sleeper, and it gains any Paradox from the effect. Paradox \nbacklashes that do damage reduce the item’s bonus Traits or health \nlevels until none are left, at which point the Talisman is broken. On the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nup side, this means that the user didn’t suffer the Paradox effect, so these \nWonders are popular among mages for working vulgar effects. \nA Wonder can contain multiple powers for the appropriate costs \nadded together. \nwCT”RS AND DRAmA \nAs rare items of magical mystery, Wonders can add a great deal of \ndrama. They’re wonderful McGuffins - \nquest items and gewgaws for \nmages to seek. Unfortunately, too many Wonders in the hands of the \nplayers can cause a mess. Mages may fall back on the magic item of the \nweek, or a few players might hoard all of the Wonders and thereby gain \ndisproportionate power. \nIt’s possible to create Wonders with phenomenal powers, beyond \nthe usual five-Trait system. Such Wonders won’t start out in the hands \nof players’ characters, though. Rather, they tend to be the focus of story \narcs, often with careful caveats as to why they can’t solve all problems \n-narrow \nset of highly efficient powers, severe drawbacks, have owners \nlooking for them, etc. Each and every Wonder should have some story \nbehind it and some purpose in the game. \nSpeaking of drawbacks, a Wonder’s powers can have limits or \nproblems. Such drawbacks mitigate the cost of the Wonder. Typically, \napply a Flaw as a limit or hindrance, and lower the Wonder’s cost by that \nnumber of Traits. For instance, a Wonder that causes its holder to suffer \na minor Vulnerability (as the two-Trait version of that Flaw) would \nknock two Traits from its cost, potentially allowing more powers along \nwith the problems. A Wonder might have conditional magic - \nit might \nnot work during the day, or on women, or in other strange circumstances. \nJust remember, when players purchase Wonders on starting characters, \nany disadvantage clearly mitigated by the character’s innate capabilities \n(such as the aforementioned Vulnerability granting Wonder held by a \ncharacter with a specific Invulnerability) gains no bonus points for those \nnon-drawbacks. \nUltimately, the Storyteller should shift the values of Wonders as \nnecessary to comfortably integrate them into the game. Some games \nwill want to make Wonders very rare and thus will raise their Trait value. \nOthers will encourage the use of minor Wonders and thus make them \nvery cheap. \nFuel Pellets \nOne-Trait Charm \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nquantity of water of no more than eight gallons. The water must then \nbe agitated for 15 minutes in a very careful manner away from any open \nflames. At the end of 15 minutes, the water is changed into eight gallons \nof high-octane gasoline. \nIntuitive Medicine Bag \nOne-Trait Artifact \nThis Wonder is usually shaped like a doctor's bag, but has been \nknown to look like a stethoscope or scalpel. With it, the user of the bag \ncan intuitively sense the ailments and injuries of a person he tries to \ntreat. As long as the user has at least one level of the Medicine Ability, \nhe will be up two extra Traits on all Medicine challenges used on a \nMata Hari's Bobby Pin \nOne-Trait Artifact \nThis Wonder is usually a hairpin or some small piece of wire. It is \nvery small and easy to conceal, and its actual use is hard to determine. \nThe pin grants two extra Traits whenever trying to pick a mechanical \nlock. The Wonder unfortunately does not give any kind of bonus against \nelectronic locks like keypads or magnetic card locks. \nMotion Sensor \nOne-Trait Artifact \nA small hand-held device with a display that shows the location of \nall moving objects in a 180-degree arc in front of the holder of the \ndevice, up to a range of 10 paces. The display can show movement on \n~ \nNight Vision Bifocals \nOne-Trait Artifact \nThese bifocal lenses use an Apprentice-level Forces effect to allow \nsuffers no ill effects from darkness while wearing these glasses. \nBaby's New Shoes Dice \nTwo-Trait Artifact \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThis Wonder is usually shaped like a pair of dice, but has also been \nshaped like a deck of cards. The user of the dice can choose to roll them \nagain if the first roll is not what was wanted, and he can then choose the \npreferred roll. To activate the dice he simply needs to blow on them, or \nsay, “Baby needs a new pair of shoes”, or some other appropriate ritual \nfor luck. The user receives the bonus of the Games of Luck (Initiate \nEntropy) Effect, when using this Wonder and only in use of this Wonder. \nBob’s Pipe \nTwo-Trait Artifact/ Periapt, holds five Quintessence \nThis rather ordinary-looking pipe tends to be overlooked, some times \neven used without the smoker even realizing its power, for it functions \nlike a normal pipe. The pipe is activated when held firmly between the \nteeth on the right side of the mouth and puffed on once - \nwhich \nexpends one of its points of Quintessence. When the pipe is activated \nthe user wins all ties on the next Mental Challenge dealing specifically \nand solely with knowledge or Lore. \nMercury Sword \nTwo-Trait Artifact \nThis silvery blade is usually attached to a hilt common to most short \nswords. The blade of the sword can be in almost any form imaginable. \nEach sword has a name that it responds to, and when this name is \nchanted to it, the wielder of the blade may shape the blade with his \nhands. Successfully shaping the blade requires a Crafts challenge \nagainst seven traits and at least a minute of work. The blade may take \nthe shape and Traits of a dagger, a rapier or a short sword; it will keep \nthis shape until the wielder attempts to reshape it again. When in one \nof these three forms, it assumes all the bonus Traits, Negative Traits, \ndamage and abilities of the weapon it is shaped like. \nForce Shield \nThree-Trait Artifact/ Periapt, holds five Quintessence \nThis Wonder is shaped like a rather bulky belt, looking a little like \na comic book hero’s utility belt. It is impossible to conceal under \nclothing, and if it is hidden, it is unable to function. The force shield \ncreates a small shield of tangible energy around the wearer that can stop \none level of damage at the cost of one Quintessence. Any single attack \nthat does more than one level of damage is only reduced by a single \nlevel, with the rest of the damage being applied to the mage. The type \nof damage blocked does not matter- \nit can be bashing, lethal or \naggravated and the force shield will stop it. The person inside the force \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nshield may attack people as normal as the shield only stops incoming \nenergy. \nMagic Eight Ball \nTwo-Trait Artifact \nA recent means of divination that has gained popularity. The \nholder of the eight ball asks it a question, and it returns an answer. \nThough usually this is a confusing answer, sometimes these things can \nbe frighteningly accurate. The player should ask aNarrator the question \nand the Narrator should choose one of the following answers (at least \nmostly true): Outlook Good, Outlook Not So Good, My Reply Is No, \nDon't Count On It, You May Rely On It, Most Likely, Cannot Predict \nNow, Yes, Yes Definitely, It Is Certain, Very Doubtful, It Is Decidedly \nSo, Signs Point to Yes, My Sources Say No, Without a Doubt. \nCarte Blanche \nThree-Trait Artifact \nThe carte blanche looks like a simple magnetic strip card with no \nmarkings on it, but it imitates a legitimate card of a needed type. It can \nbe placed in an ATM and allow the mage to withdraw up to $100 a day, \nand it can also be used as a credit card for the same amount. If used on \na card reading security system, and the owner wins a Static Mental \nChallenge against a difficulty based on the complexity of the security \nsystem, the card is accepted and whatever was locked now opens. These \ncards tend to gain the attention of the Syndicate, and overusing one can \ncause the Syndicate to liquidate your assets. Furthermore, \nTechnocratically enhanced security stations tend to be immune to this \ncard's blandishments. \nEfreet Bottle \nThree-Trait Artifact \nThese talismans are commonly shaped like small glass or clay \nbottles, sometimes boxes. They are created to trap Umbral beings. By \npointing the uncorked bottle at the target spirit and beating the spirit \nin an opposed Willpower Challenge, the holder causes the spirit to be \nsucked into the bottle, whereupon the mage may the cork the bottle and \ntrap the spirit. This Effect only works on Umbral creatures such as \nUmbrood, demons and spirits. Entities like shapechangers, Bygones \nand Umbral traveling mages are not truly spiritual creatures and have \na physical form. A spirit trapped in the bottle may not use a Charm to \nreform outside the bottle, and may not affect anything outside the \nbottle. Only one spirit may inhabit one bottle at a time. A spirit may \nt \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nescape the bottle if the bottle is destroyed, uncorked or if the spirit wins \na Static Willpower Challenge against 10 Traits (the spirit must spend \nfive Power to do this). After the spirit escapes, the bottle becomes inert, \nand appears to be cracked or the cork has fallen out. Spirits of exceeding \npower, like Celestines and Incarna, may either test to escape every turn \nat no cost or automatically escape at the Narrator’s discretion. Spirits \ntrapped in this way tend to become very angry and will seek the \ndestruction of the one who trapped them if they escape. These bottles \nare in no way related to the objects created by the Taftani to trap and \nbind djinn; they are in fact cheap knock-offs of the same. \nMr. Fusion’s Atomic Sleep-Enhancing Mask \nThree-Trait Artifact \nThese odd, somewhat uncomfortable sleeping masks are rarely \nfound these days, though they were all the rage some 50 years ago; most \nof them now collect dust in curio shops and grandmothers’ attics, their \nmagic long vanished. The mask itself is made of “space age polymers” \nthat affect the way a wearer sleeps, altering brain waves to give the \nwearer a restful night’s sleep. In game terms, these little Wonders make \nany dream-affecting Effects used upon the wearer three Traits more \ndifficult while the mask is worn and the wearer is asleep. \nSabot of Lud \nThree-Trait Artifact \nThis Wonder is a wooden shoe that would fit the average woman’s \nfoot. The shoe appears somewhat aged, possibly even petrified, but is \nlightweight and easily carried, though not at all comfortable to wear. \nNow other than shodding a person’s foot, this Wonder has another \nrather impressive effect. If placed on a mechanical or electronic device \nthat is as technologically advanced as a steam engine or better, the \ndevice takes one level of damage, or loses one bonus Trait, for every \nminute that the sabot is in contact with the device. The damage appears \nto be caused by normal wear and tear on the parts. \nUniversal Cookbook \nThree-Trait Artifact \nThis red and white checkered tome contains recipes for anything \nthat you may want to eat, even if it might not usually be edible. The \nowner of the cookbook simply needs some raw material, a modestly \noutfitted kitchen and one hour to work. After an hour in the kitchen, \nthe mage has enough nutritious food to feed four people. The food will \nnot be a great culinary delight; in fact the best way to describe it would \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nbe tasteless - \nbut when all you have is crap to eat, tasteless crap is \npreferable to the alternative. \nVorpal Letter Opener \nThree-Trait Artifact \nThis letter opener was created by a very old archmage who had a \npalsy problem and tended to cut himself whenever he was opening a \nletter with his letter opener. He created this in replacement, one that \ncould cut through anything that he needed-paper, \nbread, wood, steel, \ndiamonds, etc. The one thing it would not cut was living matter. It is \nnot a quick cutter, though, because it is a dull blade, and takes a turn for \nthe letter opener to cut six inches. \nOne of the other things that this handy little knife does is allow any \ncut that it makes to be reversed, causing the cut to reseal itself as the \nblade is drawn back. It also takes a turn to reseal a cut six inches. The \nknife can cut any material unless it is created by an Adept-level Matter \nEffect or higher. \nThe vorpal letter opener cannot automatically cut through certain \nmagic-resistant materials, such as Primium. Since it can’t injure living \nthings, it’s not very useful as a weapon. A clever mage can still find all \nmanner of uses for it, though. \nWeapon of the Psyche \nThree-Trait Artifact \nThis small piece of jewelry, which looks like a miniature melee \nweapon worn around the neck or wrist, is actually a type of psychic \nimage that forges a structure within the wearer’s psyche. This structure \nis always present in the wearer’s subconscious and is used to defend \nagainst psychic intrusion. In mindscapes and dreams, the character is \nimmediately armed with a weapon like the charm, and may use Physical \nor Mental Traits to attack beings encountered in the dream or mental \nrealm. The weapon itself gives three extra Traits and causes one lethal \nwound when it strikes successfully, no matter the type of weapon that \nthe charm is shaped like. If the wearer of the charm becomes aware of \na being that has forged a mental link with her, she may attack the \nlinking mind by engaging in a Mental Challenge. With success, she \ninflicts one lethal wound on the invader and may choose to eject him. \nI \nWild Certamen Card \nThree-Trait Artifact/ Periapt, holds five Quintessence \nThe last time a mage was caught using one of these it was shaped as \na simple playing card - \nthe Jack of Spades, to be precise. This Wonder \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthe match. The certamen referee must make an Awareness test as a \nMental Challenge if either of the Wonder’s abilities are used during the \nmatch; the referee only gets one chance to see this, as the Wonder is very \nsubtle. \nEbony Horse \nFour-Trait Artifact \nA life-size horse statue made of ebony, with a single ivory knob in \nplace within the present realm (Umbra, Horizon Realm, etc) that she’s \nbeen to previously and knows fairly well. The statue turns into a horse \nthat gallops off at an incredible pace. Ten minutes later, the horse and \nrider appear near the destination, the horse gallops up to the destination \nand turns back into a statue. The horse is unaffected by physical harm, \nand travels through obstacles by moving through them with rider \nthrough the use of co-location. These horses are rarely seen these days \nbecause their effect is very Paradoxical, but are useful as quick means of \ntransportation in some Horizon Realms and even in the Umbra. Note \nthat the horse does not actually become a real, living horse; rather, it \nanimates through the use of Matter and phases (with rider) through \nsolid objects as it gallops. \nKali’s Tongue \nFour-Trait Artifact \nA punch dagger with a wave-shaped blade, the metal of the blade \nis usually stained red or green. The dagger, when successfully used in an \nattack, activates an Adept-level Life Effect to harm the victim severely. \nThe blade never actually pierces the flesh of the victim, though. The \nattack inflicts two lethal wounds to the victim, but on examination \n* \n, \nLightning Gun \nFour-Trait Artifact/ Periapt, holds five Quintessence \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThis Wonder, commonly shaped like a '50s-style plastic toy laser \ngun, is not a toy at all. It is, in fact, a very dangerous weapon. The gun \nemits a low-powered laser beam at its intended target. This beam ionizes \nthe air between the shooter and the target, which creates a perfect \npathway for the arc of electricity that is released by a very powerful \ncapacitor - \nat least, this is the mundane explanation for what would \nusually be a very Paradoxical effect. The shooter uses a standard energy \nweapons test to hit his intended target, and ifhe hits, the shot scores two \nlevels of aggravated damage. Since this weapon inflicts aggravated \nwounds, each shot uses one charge of Quintessence. \nQuestor's Map \nFour-Trait Artifact \nThese maps - \nalso known as pathway guides, hyperdimensional \npathway maps, and treasure maps - \nhave appeared in a multitude of \ndifferent forms from ratty vellum maps to hand-held GPS maps, but \ntheir use is always the same. The map shows a rough picture of the \nGauntlet and Near Umbra in a one square mile area around the mage. \nThe rating of the Gauntlet is seen as a topographical map with high \nelevations representing high Gauntlet ratings and low areas showing \nlow Gauntlet ratings. Also shown are Shallowings and Airts, though \nthe destinations of these Airts is rarely clear and the Shallowings tend \nto appear as rather indistinct markings on the map, marking general \nareas where Shallowing may lie but no details on how to activate the \nShallowing. \nExtra-Dimensional Backpack \nFive-Trait Artifact \nThe extra-dimensional backpack is created to fold and spatially \nmutate any thing placed within it so that it fits. As long as the object \ncan fit into the opening of the backpack, the backpack will be able to \nhold the object. The weight of the object does not change, though. So, \neven though you can place an I-beam into the backpack, you are not \ngoing to be able to move once you do. It takes time to place anything \ninto the backpack, usually a turn or more depending on the size. Living \nthings cannot enter the backpack. \nFolk Ward \nOne-Trait Charm \nThese wards tend to take many different shapes and forms depending \non the paradigm and culture of their mage creators. These small wards \nand charms act as single-use anti-magic talismans, designed to counter \nI . \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nspecific Spheres or types of magic. To be used, the Charm must be in \nplain sight and easily identifiable. Whenever an Effect is done with the \nholder of the Charm named as the target of the Effect, and the Effect \nis of the category of the Charm, then the Effect is resolved at a one-Trait \npenalty (as if a Trait of Quintessence had been used for anti-magic). At \nthis point the Charm becomes inert and cannot be reimbued for the \nsame purpose. These Charms must have types of spells specified as what \nthey guard against. For instance curses, lightning and teleportation are \nacceptable; damage-causing effects are not, as the category is too broad. \nThese Charms may only be used one per effect. Even if you have a Folk \nWard against fire spells and curses, and somebody creates an Effect \ncursing you with flaming urine, only one of the talismans will activate, \nalthough you may choose which. Common Folk Wards are things like \nfour-leaf clovers that ward against bad luck, blue ribbons around the \nneck that ward against the evil eye (curses), and handfuls of posies to \nward off disease. \nNinja Smoke Bomb \nTwo-Trait Charm \nThese small clay balls, when broken open, cause the surrounding \narea to become filled with choking, irritating, obscuring smoke. Only \nthe activator of the talisman is unaffected by the smoke. The smoke \ncloud created by the Charm is six paces wide and 10 feet tall. Anyone \nin the cloud (except the activator) loses all ties in Physical Challenges \nbecause of blindness. The choking effect of the cloud causes anyone \nwithin to suffer a two-Trait penalty on all challenges. The smoke cloud \nlasts for two rounds or until a strong wind causes the smoke to dissipate. \nNote that use of appropriate Abilities (Blind-Fighting) and effects \n(Correspondence or other sensory Effects) can negate the penalties. \nTornado in a Can \nThree-Trait Charm \nThis is a one-use Charm that is thrown at a target using normal \nphysical ranged attack rules. If the attack is successful, a spinning \nkinetic force erupts from the can and holds the victim in place for three \nturns. The spinning vortex makes the victim unable to initiate any \nchallenges and impervious to personal-scale physical attack but not to \ndamage. So, if the victim is shot at, he will be unaffected by the attack, \nbut if a building falls on him, he will most likely die. (Treat this as an \nIntermediate Forces Effect that attempts to negate kinetic energy and \nhold the victim in place.) \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSpirit Rattle \nTwo-Trait Fetish \nThese rattles - \nsometimes made of dried gourds, or from the tails \nof rattlesnakes - \nare made to ward off spirits by making the area \nuncomfortable for them. When the spirit rattle is rattled purposefully, \nall spiritual beings in the area suffer a two-Trait penalty for all actions. \nThis penalty applies not only to spirits, but also to any being that is in \nthe Umbra, because the rattle sounds like thunder in the Umbra when \nit is shaken. For as long as the rattle is shaken, the penalty persists; the \nshaker of the rattle may do nothing except shake the rattle to get the \neffect of the Wonder. A spirit that is materialized suffers the same \npenalty as if it were in the Umbra. \nDragon Pearl \nFive-Trait Talisman \nThese perfectly formed pearls, each about the size of a large marble, \ncould easily fetch $1000 a piece, but mages who know their true nature \nwould never sell them for such a paltry sum. The pearls are always \nslightly warm to the touch and in near darkness they seem to reflect \nback more light than what strikes them. If a person swallows one of \nthese pearls he must first win a static Physical Challenge against eight \ntraits or take two aggravated wounds as the pearl releases its powerful \nmagic with in the body. Over the next turn the character may do \nnothing as his body transforms into a 10-foot-long, serpentlike Eastern \ndragon. When the transformation is done, the mage receives six extra \nPhysical Traits (Ferocious x 2, Enduringx 2, Lithe x 2), two extra Healthy \nhealth levels, his brawl attacks inflict lethal damage, and he can take \nsix steps for movement instead of three. The transformation lasts for a \nsingle combat or one minute, whichever comes first. While in the \ndragon form you may still talk and do magical effects if you were able to \ndo so before, but you may not use any tools or weapons as the dragon \nform does not have opposable thumbs. After the effect wears off any \ndamage done to you is applied to your normal health levels - \nif you \ntook six wounds while in the dragon form, when you transform back, \nthe six wounds applied to your normal health levels. A dragon pearl \ntypically works only once, releasing all of its stored power as it transforms \nthe user. \nTRANSLATING \nWe\"m \nNot all Wonders from other Mage supplements translate easily into \nthe live-action format. Due to the differences in pricing for live-action \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nWonders as compared to their tabletop cousins, some Wonders might be \nout of reach of live-action characters, while others might be a little \ncheaper. \nThe recommended solution is to translate all Wonders according to \nthe pricing guidelines for Laws of Ascension. Those guidelines are \nbalanced for the live-action game, which has slightly different scales of \npower than the tabletop Mage. Figure the Trait value of a Wonder based \nupon its powers, and assign it a new value for live-action play. \nIn some cases the Storyteller may wish to make an exception for a \nWonder that has Effects particularly difficult for a live-action game or \nespecially useless for agivenvenue; this can adjust the value up or down. \nThe important part of the estimate is to recalculate from the live-action \nperspective rather than being wedded to the tabletop numbers, since \nlive-action items may have different scope, smaller Effect and different \nnumbers of effective Traits. A Wonder that grants a bonus Trait, for \ninstance, is probably not as powerful in live-action play as a Wonder that \ngrants a -1 difficulty in tabletop play, because the Traits can often \nspread beyond a 1-10 range while difficulties rarely reflect a spread \nbeyond 2- 10. \nTKHNKRATIC \nENHANCE~I-IENTS \nBecause they’re placed inside the body and attached to a mage’s \nPattern, Technocratic Enhancements don’t quite follow the same rules \nas other Wonders. See the Background on p. XX for information. The \nsamples listed below only scratch the surface of potential Enhancements \nfor your operatives. In general, an Enhancement’s value should be \nroughly similar to that of a Wonder (Artifact). The Enhancement has the \nadvantage that it can’t be lost, but the disadvantage that it causes \nParadox. \nExtrasensory Access Device \nOne-Trait Enhancement \nYour field agent has some sort of extra device or sense - \neither an \nengineered organ or implanted bionic piece - \nthat permits a range of \nsensation beyond the human norms. In game terms, your character \nbenefits from one Apprentice-level Sphere sensory Effect at all times. To \nyour character, it’s as normal as seeing and hearing. \nNight Vision \nOne-Trait Enhancement \nBiological modifications to include higher densities of the right \nrods and cones, or completely re-engineered bionic eyes, allow the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\noperative to see in near darkness. Your character can see in anything but \ntotal darkness with no penalties. \nSkeletal Enhancement \nOne-Trait Enhancement \nInternal bracings or specially engineered spiral bone structure \ngrants a superstrong skeleton and better muscular attachment points. \nYour agent can mount heavy hardware such as energy weapons along \nthese bracings. You also gain one extra Bruised health level. \nClaws \nTwo-Trait Enhancement \nClaws - \neither bony or metallic - \nextend on command and allow \nyou to rake your opponents for lethal damage. The claws grant you a \none-Trait bonus in hand combat and in climbing. \nComputer Coprocessor \nTwo-Trait Enhancement \nYou have a computer chip tied into your brain - \nor a part of your \nbrain is so finely wired that it functions just as well as a computer. You \ngain all the benefits of permanent mental enhancement: Incredible \nmath skills, ability to record reams of raw text data, even the potential \nto process other information if (say) you have some cybernetic recording \ndevice and a means to tie it into the computer headware. With an \noutput port or a dermal interface, you can output your computer's \ninformation to another system or upload new programs. \nEnvironmental Adaptability \nThree-Trait Enhancement \nImproved filters, gills, pressure compensators and similar \nredundancies enable your operative to function underwater, in intense \nheat or perhaps even in a vacuum. Choose one type of high-threat \nenvironment, such as high heat, radioactivity or space. Your character \nsuffers neither damage nor Trait penalties in that environment, even \nwithout any protections. Note that fiery and freezing substances can \nstill cause damage -just \nbecause you're engineered to work near the \nheart of a volcano doesn't mean you'll survive a dip in the lava. \nThe sample rotes here run a wide gamut. Some are highly useful to \npolitically or militarily active mages; others tie in specifically to \neveryday life. Many are conjunctional. Again, like the sample Wonders \npresented previously, these pieces provide examples, not concrete \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nguidelines for all situations. From these rotes can spring inspiration for \nother magical Effects and ideas. Just as important as the powers of the \nrotes is their intended use. Remember that mages can and do make \nmagical Effects for things that some people might consider trivial, and \nnot all spells are designed for battle, curses or defenses. \nAccess This: Initiate Forces, Initiate Correspondence. This rote, \nprimarily used by the Virtual Adepts, forges a link between two \nelectronic devices, allowing one to control/access another within \nvisual sight. The control that the casting mage has is limited by the \nmechanics of the device that he uses to access the other device. For \ninstance, a mage using a Game Boy to access a computer may only be \nable access the monitor through his LCD and move the mouse around; \nby using a palmtop computer, he would be able to access the computer \nmuch more effectively. For one hourlscene, the mage may use the \naccessed device. If there is any type of security on the device being \naccessed, the mage must win a Mental Challenge using the Computer \nAbility against a number of Traits determined by a Narrator. Grades of \nSuccess: None. \nActivate Next Clone: Master Life, Adept Time, Master Mind, \nAdept Spirit, Adept Prime, Disciple Correspondence. This incredibly \npowerful Effect done through a conjunctional effort by multiple arms of \nthe Conventions is reserved for only their most highly ranked members. \nA clone is created of the caster, then placed in a stasis chamber. A piece \nof cyberware is then implanted in the mage that monitors physical \nstatus and transfers his consciousness when he is at risk of being killed. \nWhen the monitor detects that the mage is at Incapacitated or worse, \nhis consciousness is instantly downloaded into the clone that wakes up \n10 minutes later exactly as the mage was before, except with no damage. \nThe shock of the transfer and the near-death experience has a profound \neffect on the mage, as he loses apermanent Trait of Willpower and gains \na derangement. If the mage was at worse than Mortally Wounded when \nthis occurred, then the toll is doubled (loss of two permanent Willpower \nand gaining two derangements). The stasis chamber is only able to keep \nthe clone viable for one month. After one month, the Effect wears off \nand the mage simply dies as normal. If the mage is killed while his \nconsciousness is outside of his body, the transfer fails and the mage dies. \nIf there is another consciousness in the body when it dies, that \nconsciousness is transferred to the new clone with all the penalties \nimposed from the transfer. If the mage's consciousness and another \nconsciousness are in the body when it dies, the transfer takes place and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthe transfer device tries to make as close an approximation as it can - \nthe final result is the clone having both wills with in it fighting for \ncontrol (winner of a Mental Challenge has control for a scenehour). \nGrades of Success: Increase the grade of duration of the stasis field. \nAkashic Cliff Notes: Apprentice Mind. This rote has been quietly \npassed from apprentice to apprentice over the years among the Akashic \nBrotherhood. Through meditation the apprentice is better able to \nconcentrate and understand the koans and proverbs his sensei is trying \nto teach. In game terms, the mage receives a one-Trait bonus on any \nEnigmas challenges. Grades of Success: None. \nBall of Abysmal Flame: Master Forces, Master Prime, Adept Time, \nDisciple Mutter. This is the most powerful destructive spell known to \nexist in the lone mage's repertoire. It has been used few times, and only \nin the direst of circumstances, as it is highly dangerous to perform and \nthe results can be devastating. To cast this spell, the mage draws a \npentagram that points south. During the first turn of casting, a little bit \nof Quintessence is drawn from everything in the surrounding area (an \neffect that can be detected with a Static Awureness Mental Challenge \nagainst 12 Traits). The second turn of casting transmutes this \nQuintessence into heat and fire that is bound within the confines of the \npentagram. At this point it looks like a short column of roiling flames. \nDuring the third turn, the caster must hold the Effect in place long \nenough for him to get away from the blast area. The first parts of the spell \nare easy compared to the timing element, and this is the part that tends \nto break down (and this is when the actual casting test is made). The \nEffect requires three turns togather the necessaryenergy. Ondetonating, \nit inflicts four aggravated wounds to everything with half a mile of the \npentagram. If the casting test fails, the effect goes off immediately, but \nthe blast radius is only about 100 yards. In conjunction with \nCorrespondence, the mage can selectively target areas, using grades of \nsuccess to eliminate certain people or objects from the blast. This spell \nis, in many ways, the mage's version of a bomb, and Storytellers should \ntreat it as such. It's not a cheap way to destabilize a game, but a powerful \nand dangerous tool for a story that demands a tremendous overhaul. \nGrades of Success: Increases the damage by one aggravated wound per \ngrade. \nBattery Man: Adept Life, Initiate Forces. Created at first as a \npractical joke by a less-than-humorous Son of Ether, it changes the \ncaster's body to act as a wet cell battery and able to store enough \nelectricity to inflict a serious shock. The mage can store up to two \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncharges that each inflict one lethal wound; these charges must be \ndischarged one at a time. The charges can be discharged against any \nperson or metal object that is touching the ground and touching the \ncaster. The caster may also power anything that can be powered with \nelectricity, up to a car battery, for one minute per charge. The Effect \nlasts for one hour, and if there are any charges left after that hour, they \nall ground out through the caster causing the damage to him. Grades of \nSuccess: Each grade increases the number of charges by two. \nBean: Apprentice Mind. A Virtual Adept who was a bit of Frank \nHerbert freak created this rote so that he could stay awake longer. The \nmage chews on a single coffee bean and chants the mantra: \"It is \nthrough will alone I set my mind in motion, through the juice of the \ncoffee bean the thoughts acquire speed, the hands acquire shakes, the \nshakes become a warning. It is through will alone I set my mind in \nmotion.\" The Virtual Adept may now remain awake for a full 24 hours \nlonger than normal without incurring any penalties. When the duration \nends, he sleeps for twice as long as he forced himself to stay wakeful. \nGrades of Success: None. \nBe Cool: Initiate Mind. A Hollow One rote to make the caster more \nsocially accepted wherever she is. When the Effect is done, it makes \neverybody who interacts with the mage feel like she belongs there and \nwhatever she says is socially acceptable. For one scene, the mage \nreceives a bonus Social Trait of Charming. Grades of Success: One grade \nincreases the bonus Trait by one, to a maximum of three, or increases \nthe duration by one grade. \nBending Willow: Adept Correspondence. The Akashic Brother- \nhood has used this rote to make entire groups of thugs obliterate each \nother without the mage striking asingle one. Through the use of Do, the \nBrother bends space around himself to cause attacks that would have hit \nhim to strike other attackers. The opponents he is affecting must be \nwithin arm's reach of him. For the one-turn duration of the Effect, a \nsingle attack that has hit the mage strikes a different opponent of the \nmage's choice. Only non-magical physical attacks directed against the \ncaster may be redirected with this rote. Grades of Success: One grade \nincreases the grade of duration (to a maximum of one scene/hour); one \ngrade of success redirects an extra attack per turn. \nCall the Tempest: Disciple Entropy, Adept Forces, Disciple Spirit. \nThis rote is attributed to the weather witches of the Verbena, and has \nrarely been seen to be used in any form by any other Tradition. They \nwould seem to be the only ones who either understand nature enough \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nto use the rote, or the only ones mad enough to unleash this level of \nuncontrolled energy. Typically this Effect is done beside a seething \ncauldron with many unmentionable ingredients thrown into it, along \nwith a lot of dancing and chanting. The culmination of the Effect \nreleases a violent squall of wind, rain and lightning that is nominally \nunder the mage’s control. After the Effect is finished, it takes one hour \nfor the storm to gather - \nover that hour, the clouds become more and \nmore threatening, the wind picks up, and rain starts to fall. After the \nstorm has formed, the violent center lasts for an hour over the area \nwhere the Effect was done. Everything within a mile of the center of the \nstorm is buffeted by high winds, hail and rain. Any character who is \nunprotected in this weather must win a Static Physical Challenge \nagainst eight Traits every 10 minutes or take one level of bashing \ndamage from flying debris and hail. The caster is unaffected by his own \nstorm. For the duration of the storm, the caster may focus the storm \nagainst a single target. He may only do this once and must win a magical \nattack test against the target. If the mage succeeds, he may hit the target \nwith a wind attack that inflicts two bashing levels and knocks her down, \nor with a lightning strike that inflicts two aggravated levels of damage. \nGrades of Success: One grade of success for one extra attack by the storm \nper grade; these grades cannot be done in the same turn. \nChange the Flow of the Masses: Adept Entropy, Initiate Corre- \nspondence, Apprentice Time. Crowds of moving people actually emulate \nthe flow of viscous fluids, simulating compression waves, tremors and \nflows. Because of this, the movement of the people is predictable and \ncan be altered in minute ways. This rote does just that: it allows the \nprediction and control of large groups of people to either increase or \ndecrease a person’s movement through the crowd. It can be used in \ntraffic jams to always be in the lane that is moving. It can be used on a \nbank teller line, so that the line you choose moves fastest. It can be used \nto remain untrampled while people are panicked and running for the \nemergency exits. \nBut just as it can be used to speed movement though crowds, it can \nalso be used slow movement through the same crowded sidewalk, rush- \nhour traffic jam or bank teller line. The mage selects if he will speed or \nslow movement when he casts. If the mage chooses to increase speed, \nthen the target may take one extra step through the crowd of people; \nchoosing to slow decreases the target’s steps by one. Grades of Success: \nNone. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrote is used primarily by Verbena to protect them from hostile magic. \nIt is cast by creating a circle and making an offering to the elements or \nsome spirits to protect the caster and the circle. The mage then stays in \nthe circle and chants, meditates or dances. As long as the caster stays \nwith in the circle, which may be no more than three feet wide, the caster \nhas a one-Trait bonus on all countermagic against any Effect directed \nagainst anything within the circle from anything outside the circle. The \ncircle lasts for one hour or one scene, whichever comes first; when the \nmage leaves the circle; or when he makes any action other than \nconcentrating on maintaining the circle. The mage can do nothing \nduring the duration except maintain the spell; if he is disrupted, he must \nwin a Static Mental Challenge against five Traits (plus one Trait per \ngrade of success). Gr&s of Success: One grade increases the diameter \nof the circle by three feet, one grade increases the Trait bonus by one \nTrait, one grade increases the grade of duration. \nCleansing Penance: Disciple Prime, Disciple Entropy, Disciple Life. \nThis dangerous rote allows a Chorister to attempt to cleanse apenitent \nperson of something that is tainting her soul. Usually this requires both \nthe Chorister and the tainted subject to undergo a strenuous and painful \nordeal. In the process, the Chorister takes on some of the taint from the \nsubject and cleanses it from himself, making the suffering less upon the \nsubject so that she does not kill herself in the process. Each hour during \nthe process, the Chorister and the subject must win Static Physical \nChallenges against three times the subject’s Entropy Traits, or take \nthree aggravated wounds from the cleansing of the Entropic energy that \nis flowing through them. The process can be stopped at any time, but \nAvatar will only allow this process to be done once per incarnation - \nany other attempts to cleanse the same person will fail automatically. \nAlso, there are some souls that are too far gone to be affected by this rote. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\npacts are beyond the help of this rote; and Euthanatos who have five \nEntropic Resonance Traits cannot be helped. This rote can never \nreduce a mage to less than one Trait of Entropic Resonance. Grades of \nSuccess: None. \nCode: FIDA: Master Spirit, Disciple Cowespodnce, Disciple Life, \nAdept Mind. When the rest of the Conventions cannot deal with a \nparticularly difficult Reality Deviant, they call in the Marines - \nnamely the Void Engineer Marines. The Engineers set up a portable \ndimensional rift teleportation generator at a point in the near Umbra. \nThe equipment generates a shell of reality around them that is friendly \nto the Technocratic paradigm. They focus on their intended target and \nopen a dimensional rift, which sucks in the intended victim and \ntransports the hapless target to the Engineers’ location where there are \nusually 10 to 20 well-armed and -armored Marines awaiting them. The \nMind portion of the Effect keeps bystanders from noticing what happened \nor that the victim was even there. The rift only stays open long enough \nfor the victim to be pulled through; there is not enough time for \nanybody to jump into the rift as well. The transportation to the prepared \nsite is instantaneous, and the victim does take damage from the Avatar \nStorm if that is applicable. This rote is unfortunately very Paradoxical, \nand the Void Engineers have become loath to risk their resources on \nwhat they usually see as other people’s problems. Grades of Success: \nNone. \nCommand the Summoned Beast: Master Entropy, Initiate Spirit. \nThis important rote gives a Hermetic mage a way to create binding \nagreements with summoned beings. Most summoned beings feel no \nneed to keep their agreements with mortals, even with mortals who are \nmagically adept. This rote makes sure the spirit will hold to a bargained \nagreement. The rote does not actually command the spirit to do \nanything - \nbecause it can say no - \nbut once it makes an agreement \nto perform a task, the spirit is bound to carry out the task to its \ncompletion. Along the same lines, though, if the mage agrees to do \nsomething in exchange for service done by the spirit, the Effect compels \nthe mage to keep up his part of the bargain. Grades of Success: None. \nCommune: Initiate Spirit, Initiate Time, Initiate Mind, Initiate \nPrime. There is nothing as beautiful as watching the sun rise over a hill, \nto see all the world come to life as the rays of the sun strike each blade \nof grass and each leaf on a tree. The world changes in that instant from \nnight to day. Ecstatic mages hunger for these moments in order to \ncommune with spirits ofnature. When they are able to find one of these \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmoments, they may extend the time when they remain in that moment \nof ecstasy for up to an hourlscene. During this time, they are a little \ndistracted and suffer a two-Trait penalty on all actions for the duration \nof the Effect. They may also use this extended feeling as a focus, but once \nthey do so, the Effect ends after the next Effect is done. Grades of \nSuccess: Increase in the grade of duration. \nCracks in the Conscience: Apprentice Entropy, Initiate Mind. By \nwatching the Dharma of a subject and sensing the subconscious mind, \nan initiate Euthanatos senses pangs of guilt and the deviation from a \nsubject's past path, and know when the victim lies. For the one scene/ \nhour duration of the Effect, the mage engage the subject in a Social \nChallenge to judge if the last statement was a lie. Grades ofSuccess: One \ngrade of success detects one derangement of the subject's choosing. \nCurse of Luck: Adept Entropy, Adept Mind. This rote, created ages \nago, has remained pretty much the same over the centuries, altering \nslightly from culture to culture. It requires a small object with some \nconnection to the potential victim and a statement to the effect of \"May \nall that you do come to naught.\" The victim is then cursed to be \nunsuccessful in almost every task he attempts, even the simplest ones, \nand worse, his mental faculties may be dulled to the point that he does \nnot realize what is happening to him. In game turns, for the one-turn \nduration of the spell, the victim loses on all ties in all challenges as fate \nworks against him. The Mind component causes his mental faculties to \ndull, making any learned Abilities nearly useless. Grades of Success: \nIncrease the grade of duration. \nDecrypt Thoughts: Disciple Mind, Disciple Entropy. A Virtual \nAdept named C.H. Modroot created this as a means to mess with people \nwho always kept their thoughts encrypted. The rote probes the person's \nmind and uses complex algorithms to decipher a target's mind, using \ncues from the victim's own id, and giving the caster of the rote the \nkeyword to gain access whenever desired. The caster engages the \nprotected mage in a Mental Challenge. If the caster wins, he gets the \nkeyword; if he loses, he doesn't. The target of the spell may attempt an \nAwareness Mental Challenge against the caster to see if he realizes what \noccurred. Ever since this rote started becoming common, many paranoid \nVirtual Adepts have created increasingly complex and secure rotes to \nprotect their thoughts. Grades of Success: None. \nDiscordant Sanctum: Initiate Correspondence, Initiate Mind. Used \nto halt intruders, the Discordant Sanctum causes the mage's home or \nSanctum to become confusing and disorienting to invaders. The victim \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsees the room as constantly shifting and chaotic, lights will flicker for \nhim and concentration on anything becomes difficult. The victim \nsuffers a one-Trait penalty on all actions. The spell lasts for as long as \nthe victim remains in the affected room or building. Typically, the \nsubject must lose a Static Mental Challenge (difficulty of the casting \nmage's Mental Traits) at the time of the rote's casting. This makes the \nrote particularly formidable if the mage uses enhancements to gain \ntemporary Mental Traits and then invokes this protection. Grade of \nSuccess: Each of grade of success increases the penalty by one Trait or \naffects one additional victim. \nDuct Tape and WD-40: Apprentice Matter, Apprentice Entropy. \nThis rote allows a machine to function for just a little bit longer. The \nmage casts the spell after checking for weak points in a machine and \napplying copious amounts of duct tape and WD-40. With success, the \nmachine gains one extra health level for one scenehour. Grades of \nSuccess: None. \nEncrypt Thoughts: Apprentice Mind, Apprentice Life, Initiate \nPrime. A very paranoid Virtual Adept who was always afraid somebody \nwas trying to read his mind created this rote. The rote gives the \nprotected mage a free retest on any attempts to read his mind. This \nincludes magical lie detection and telepathy. The mage must select an \nencryption keyword at the casting of the spell (this keyword should be \nwritten on a card). He may tell people the keyword so that they may \nfreely gain access. Any of these people may spread the keyword to \nanybody else; any who have the keyword get a free retest when trying \nto access the protected mage's mind. The Life and Mind magic affects \nboth the physical brain and the mental projection, so that all forms of \nreading have to penetrate the encryption, while the Prime magic \nactually overlays the encryption on the Pattern level. The effect lasts \none scene or one hour, whichever comes first. Grades of Success: \nIncrease the grade of duration. \nFall Upon Thy Knees: Adept Mind or Disciple Forces, Initiate \nPrime. This rote used by the Celestial Chorus reveals the awesome \npower of the One and forces a target to a kneeling position unable to \nmove or act. The Mind version of this places the subject in a state of awe \nthat makes him incapable of initiating any Physical Challenges as he \nfalls upon his knees from the overwhelming emotion. The Forces \nversion creates physical pressure upon the target and forces him to his \nknees, unable to initiate any Physical Challenges. The victim must win \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\na Static Physical Challenge against three times the mage’s Arete to \nstand. Grades of Success: None. \nFaux Curse: Initiate Mind. This insidious rote was created by the \nVerbena, but has seen variations in many different paradigms. The \neffect is done by verbally chanting a curse at a target where he can hear, \nusually accompanied with a brew or hand gesture of some sort and a \nMental Challenge. If the Effect succeeds, the target is struck with a \nsense of foreboding that he is cursed. This uneasy feeling causes the \nvictim to be one Trait down on all challenges due to his fear. After the \none minute/conflict duration is complete, the victim may attempt to \nwin a Static Mental Challenge against a number of Traits equal to the \nmage’s Arete times three. If the victim fails, he still believes himself to \nbe cursed and still has the penalty because his mind has fooled itself into \nbelieving the curse to be true. The victim sees any small misfortune as \na sign that the curse still hounds him. The victim may only shake the \ncurse if he convinces the mage to “remove” it, or if he spends a \nWillpower Trait and wins the Static Mental Challenge. Grades of \nSuccess: None. \nFeng Shui: Disciple Correspondence, Disciple Prime. By taking one \nhour and rearranging the furniture, and thereby encouraging the flow \nof chi in the room to collect in one place, the mage may gather bits of \nexcess energy and gain one Quintessence Trait. After this is done, it \nmay not be done in the same building again for one month. Grades of \nSuccess: Each grade channels one extra Quintessence Trait. \nFind Reality Flaws: Apprentice Prime, Apprentice Enaopy . By \nexamining the faults and damage to the Tapestry, the mage can better \njudge how to cast an Effect without causing as much damage to reality. \nThe mage discovers the level of the Domino Effect and the direction of \nthe ebb and flow of Paradox. As long as the mage is the next person to \ncast a coincidental Effect, he will feel no penalties from the Domino \nEffect when casting that single spell. No other mage can take advantage \nof this bonus, and while neither spell is penalized by the Domino Effect, \nthey do add to the tally. The bonus from Find Reality Flaws will not \nwork if the penalty from the Domino Effect has reached three Traits, \nbecause at that point all Effects are vulgar. Because this rote was created \nonly to look at the state of reality, it is not penalized by the Domino \nEffect. Grades of Success: None. \nGot a Hunch: Initiate Correspondence, Initiate Spin’t, Initiate Time, \nApprentice Mind. This rote has gone through many incarnations and \nnames, but an Orphan who worked as a private investigator coined its \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nmost recent one. The rote gives the mage the ability to look at multiple \naspectsof an area where she is standing and correlate all that information \nto give her some intuitive ideas of what is going on. When cast, the \nmage may ask a Narrator one question of the area, such as “Has the \nNephandus been through here?” The Narrator need only give one \nanswer to one question (i.e., a two-part question will only get one part \nanswered - \nNarrator’s choice regarding which part). Note that the \nanswer does not have to be specific or detailed: “You see some Morley \nCigarette butts,” while not directly an answer, would be a significant \nclue. Grades of Success: None. \nGremlins: Disciple Spirit. This rote, first created by a Dreamspeaker \nwho was angered by the Industrial Revolution, has seen many versions \nand incarnations over time. The rote awakens the spirit residing in a \nmachine and imbues it with a malevolent personality. The machine \nbecomes “temperamental,” usually refusing to work correctly, sometimes \neven making attacks against its owner. For one hourlscene (whichever \ncomes first), any challenges made with the machine will be at a one- \nTrait penalty. For example, a computer with a gremlin loosed in it will \ncause all Computer challenges performed with it to be at a one-Trait \npenalty. If an object has bonus Traits that are reduced to zero, the object \nsimply refuses to work for the duration. Grades ofsuccess: One grade of \nsuccess increases the grade of duration. One grade of success increases \nthe Trait penalty by one. Three grades of success gives the object some \nanthropomorphism and lets the object make physical attacks against \nanybody in contact with it every turn. The object has six PhysicalTraits \nand the type of damage should be appropriate for what the object may \nbe able to physically do. For instance, a computer may shock a victim \nfor lethal damage, an oven may shoot flames for aggravated damage, and \nso on. \nGuilty Whispers: Adept Mind, Initiate Entropy, Initiate Prime. \nThis rote, used by some inquisitors of the Celestial Chorus, feeds energy \nto the conscience of a subject, summoning up a whispering voice in the \nback of the person’s mind that hounds her about her misdeeds and sins. \nNo matter what the morals of the target may be, for the duration of the \nEffect, her whispering conscience has the moral beliefs of the mage. The \naffected character should roleplay having these voices in her head, and \nthey are quite persistent, becoming louder when she is asked about one \nof her misdeeds. In game terms, for the one hourlscene duration, the \ncharacter feels compelled to admit to any misdeed that she has committed \nwhen she are asked about it. The character may opt to spend a \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nWillpower rather than spill the beans. Once the affected character has \nadmitted to a misdeed that he is asked about, the voice calms down and \nreturns to sleep, having been sated. Striking with Guilty Whispers \ngenerally involves a Mental Challenge between the caster and victim. \nGrades ofsuccess: None. \nHead of a Pin: Initiate Prime. How many angels can dance on the \nhead of a pin? How many drops of water are there in a drop of water? \nAccording to most paradigms, there is only one angel on the pin, and \nthere is only one drop of water, but the Chorus sees the infinity of reality \nand sees that the drop of water can be separated into an infinite number \nof drops of water, and that an infinite number of angels can dance on \nthe impossibly small head of a pin. Because of this, the Chorus is able \nto concentrate Tass to hold multiple Traits of Quintessence. After this \nis done, though, it becomes impossible for any but a Chorister to access \nall the Quintessence within the Tass. A Chorister with some of this \ntreated Tass can access all the Quintessence within it all at once. For \ninstance, an Ecstatic has a mushroom that is a piece of Tass -he eats \nthe mushroom and gets a Trait of Quintessence. A Chorister has some \nholy water with eight Traits of Quintessence - \nhe anoints himself with \nthe holy water and may choose to either access all eight Traits or only \none at that instant. The Chorister needs to have a single source of Tass \nto start with; through prayer and ritual, he then concentrates other \nTraits of Quintessence (either from his Pattern or from other sources of \nTass) into the initial source of Tass. He may place one extra Trait of \nQuintessence into the source of Tass; it will remain there until removed. \nGrades of Success: One grade of success allows for an extra Trait of \nQuintessence to be stored. \nHistoric Editing: Master Entropy or Adept Time. This tool of the \nNew World Order has allowed them to destroy or alter almost every \nhistorical event to their favor and to reflect their paradigm. The Effect \nis set into motion by historical studies and media coverage of \"newly \ndiscovered facts.\" These facts then disseminate through the populace \nand alter the Consensus' perception of the events. Any person trying to \nfind out atrue facts about an event in the past that has been changed by \nthis Effect must win a Static Mental Challenge against three times the \nArete of the mage who made the edit. A mage using Time magic to look \nback at the event must make the same Mental Challenge in order to see \nthe true history. Grades of Success: None. \nHungarian Phrase Book: Master Entropy. This amusing yet \ndangerous curse causes everything the victim says to sound like \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nnonsensical (sometimes silly) words. If cast properly, the victim can say \nnothing correctly - \nhe should use the wrong nouns and verbs and be \nunable to be understood at all verbally. The victim does not realize he \nis speaking gibberish, and will likely become quite frustrated and \nconfused. Anyone who wants to understand the victim must win a \nStatic Mental Challenge against three times the caster's Arete Traits. \nThis spell lasts for one hour or one scene, whichever comes first. Grades \nof Success: Increase the grade of duration. \nImbue the Living Vessel: Disciple Prime, Disciple Life. The mage \ncan store Quintessence in another person. This rote takes advantage of \nthe fact that even the unAwakened have Patterns that can hold \nQuintessence, and temporarily makes a person into walking, talking \nTass. This is commonly used by Verbena on their followers before \nrituals to have extra Quintessence on hand for magical works. It is \ncommonly cast by using sex, drugs or ordeals. During the casting, the \nmage transfers some Quintessence from himself or from some Tass into \nthe target. There is an added side-effect to this rote -the \ntarget feels \na great rush of energy that tends to bring on a strong sense of euphoria. \nIn the case of some types of Tass, it may bring on feelings of depression \nor intense focus. This side-effect fades within an hour, and the Tass \ntakes on a Resonance appropriate to the target's emotional state when \nthe Quintessence is drawn from her. The rote stores one Quintessence \nfor one day. After a day, any unused Quintessence leaks out of the \ntarget's Pattern at the rate ofone per day. The caster of the rote can draw \nupon the Tass at any time while the Quintessence is still in the Pattern. \nGrades of Success: Increase the number of Quintessence stored by one \nper grade. \nInformation Glut: Initiate Correspondence, Disciple Mind, Initiate \nTime. The mage gains the Mental Trait: Observunt and sees and hear \nthings at longer distances than would normally be possible. The mage \nmay also take in a glut of confusing information and sort through the \ndata, getting what he wants without being confused by the overload or \nmissing necessary details. The duration of the Effect is one scene or one \nhour, whichever comes first. Grades of Success: Increase the grade of \nduration per success. Two grades of success adds an extra observer for \nthe duration. \nInstant Karma: Disciple Correspondence, Adept Entropy. This rote \nis a kind of curse employed recently by some Euthanatos, but has been \nused in different forms by the Celestial Chorus and the Verbena. It uses \nthe interconnections of all things in the universe and the inexorable \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncascade of events to cause a victim to feel immediate consequences for \nhis actions. When cast, the Euthanatos must choose an action that the \nvictim should not do and then choose a consequence of that action. \nThe banned action must be something that the victim would have to \nwillfully do as an immoral action and cannot be an action necessary for \nnormal survival. For example, you cannot ban the victim from breathing, \neating or pissing; but you could ban them from killing, stealing or even \nusing foul language. Placing a ban against killing on a person also counts \nif that person accidentally kills a person in self-defense, because the \ndesire causes the action and this brings about the karmic justice. The \nconsequence of the action is chosen by the mage when the Effect is \ndone, and may either cause a wound (up to aggravated), or give the \nvictim a Negative Trait. After the Effect is cast, the victim becomes \naware that his actions cause immediate consequence, and knows what \nthose consequences will be. The Effect lasts for one day. For example: \nBob the Euthanatos knows a man named Jim. Jim is at a crossroads in \nhis destiny - \non one path, he could become a great and benevolent \nleader; on the other he could become a thief who would prey on the \nweak and cause the further decay of the world. So Bob places a ban on \nJim, causing Jim to suffer one lethal wound every time he steals \nsomething. Jim ignores his conscience and steals an old lady's purse, \nonly to feel a stabbing pain in his hand. By this, Bob quietly guides Jim \nonto the preferred path. Casting this unusual curse on someone requires \nbesting the subject in a Social Challenge. Grades of Success: Increase \nthe duration by a grade of duration. \nKnock Out: Disciple Mind, Initiate Prime. Invented by a Son of \nEther who hated killing, this rote effectively incapacitates a target \nwithout causing any serious harm. The caster must succeed in a magical \nattack against the intended target. If successful, the target is stunned \nand unable to initiate any challenges or move. This stun status is \ncanceled if any aggressive damage-causing action is directed at the \nstunned character (this includes indirect sources of damage like hand \ngrenades and burning buildings). The target is only stunned for one \nturn, so it is best that the mage move quickly after doing this. G r d s  of \nSuccess: Increase the grade of duration. \nKnow the Leper's Mind: Initiate Mind, Disciple Spirit. A \nDreamspeaker created this rote centuries ago when he tended a small \ncolony of lepers. The rote summons a spirit of hatred and binds it to a \nsingle victim to follow and torment him. This spirit inspires hatred and \ndisgust in every person who comes into contact with the victim. While \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nfrom the enchanted head, and it only speaks when alone with the \ncaster. Grades of Success: Increase the grade of duration. \nMind GREP: Disciple Mind. By attaching a computer to a victim's \nhead with a SQUID helmet, a Virtual Adept may use GREP searches \nto find information from a victim's brain. For one minute/conflict, the \nmage may ask one question of the victim, which he must answer \ntruthfully (if the mage wins a Mental Challenge). Grades of Success: \nEach grade of success allows the mage to ask one more question of the \nvictim. \nMoment of Inspiration: Apprentice Time, Apprentice Spirit. Many \ninitiates of the Cult of Ecstasy are artists of some type, and they come \nto realize that the Muses of old are still present, but they now speak to \nartists infrequently and tease with fleeting glimpses of inspiration. \nApprentices use this rote to concentrate on these brief moments and \nhold onto them for as long as possible. With this they gain a one-Trait \nbonus on any challenge dealing with artistic ability or creativity (Crafts, \nPerformance, Expression, etc.) Grades of Success: None. \nMr. Fusion's Clean Burning Fuel Fabrication Formula: Disciple \nMatter. This formula created by the mad Mr. Fusion changes an amount \nof non-living inorganic matter into an equal volume of methane. While \nmost people don't see much use for this rote, Mr. Fusion thought it was \njust keen and was planning on making loads of money when he started \nselling his kerosene-burning line of cars. Grades of Success: None. \nMurder of Crows: Disciple Life, Initiate Mind. This rote, first \ncreated by the Verbena, has been adopted in different forms by other \nTraditions and changed to match their paradigm and the animals \navailable. The Effect summons a group of a specific type of animal that \ndoes the mage's bidding. It takes one full turn for the swarm to arrive. \nSince this is not a natural action it takes a bit of concentration from the \nuser to keep them on track. Other actions may be performed, but \nattempting to summon another swarm of animals causes both swarms \nto dissipate and go back to what they were interrupted. The swarm has \nseven Physical Traits and four Healthy health levels; it inflicts lethal \ndamage when it hits and may only attack one target at a time. The \nswarm remains around the caster for one scenehour (whichever comes \nfirst). If its four health levels are removed, the swarm dissipates, as \ninstinct overcomes the magical compulsion. Grades ofsuccess: Increase \nthe Physical Traits of the swarm by one, or increase the health levels of \nthe swarm by one Healthy health level. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nMy God Can Beat Up Your God: Disciple Spirit, Disciple Prime. \nIn the past, the Choristers have crushed cults to dangerous Umbroods \nand demons with this rote. The rote summons a spirit, which usually \nappears as an angel, tkiat does battle with another spirit in the area that \nthreatens the Chorister or is an enemy of the Chorister. The \"angel\" \ndoes retain free will, and will refuse to attack a spirit without good \nreason, and will never attack a non-spiritual creature (but it will attack \na materialized spirit). The angel summoned with this particular Effect \nhas eight Traits in Rage and Gnosis, 20 Power, and has the Charms Airt \nSense and Flames ofPurification. During the battle, the mage may spend \nhis Quintessence to increase the Power of the spirit at a one-to one rate. \nThe mage may spend his own Ability Traits to give the angel retests, \nand the mage may take on damage for the spirit. Grades of Success: \nNone. \nMystic Tag: Initiate Spirit, Initiate Prime. This rote, created by a \nHollow One, is used as a clandestine means of communications. A \nHollow One writes a stylized tag (a picture or a nickname usually \nwritten with a Sharpee permanent marker, for those unfamiliar with \ntagging) on something out in the open that can be easily seen. As she \nis writing the tag, she also writes a small message on the webs of the \nstructure she is tagging. Any person with Apprentice Spirit can \nimmediately see the message contained in the tag. The message may be \nup to five words long, and is usually used to warn other Hollow Ones of \ndangers in an area or to point \"newbies\" toward gathering places. The \nmessage lasts as long as the tag remains visible on the structure. G r d s  \nof Success: Increase the size of the hidden message by five words. \nNice Boots, Wanna Fuck?: Disciple Life, Disciple Mind. This \nHollow Ones rote starts by increasing a few hormones in the target's \nbody to make him more \"aroused.\" The Mind part of the rote gives the \nmage information on the right things to say to her target. As a \nconsequence, the target becomes more open to carnal suggestions, and \nthe mage receives two bonus Traits of Seductive against the person she \ntargets with the Effect. (As a side note, just because your character is able \nto seduce another character does not mean you the player can get frisky \nwith the player of that character. We really should not have to mention \nthis, but we will, because inevitably there will be somebody who tries \nto use this rote as a kind of LARPer mating ritual. Remember, No \nTouching.) Grades of Success: None. \nParma Magica: Disciple Prime. The famed Parma Magica, created \nby House Bonisagus of the Order of Hermes, is one of the catalysts of the \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\norganized Traditions as they are today. It is cast on a small object - \nusually something with some importance to the caster, and many times \nis fashioned to look like a shield. The newly empowered object then acts \nas a store for Quintessence that is instantly accessible in any amount to \nbe used for countermagic. For Sphere countermagic, it makes the \nshielded mage’s difficulty one less per Quintessence used. The Talisman \ncan hold two Quintessence, and is unique to the caster and cannot be \nused by anybody else. The mage must still have the Quintessence to \nplace in the object, of course. Grades of Success: One grade increases the \nheld Quintessence by two. \nPlace in the Dance: Apprentice Correspondence. The Dreamspeakers \nhave a slightly different view of the Correspondence Sphere. They do not \nsee it as a Sphere of space and distance, but as the Sphere of \ninterconnectedness, in which all beings are part of the Great Dance and \nwhat they do affects everything else in the dance. This rote, taught to \nyoung students of this Sphere among the Dreamspeakers, gives the \nmage a vision of where a subject belongs in the Great Dance. In game \nterms, the player may ask one question about the subject’s geographic \nbackground - \ni.e., what culture is she from, where was she born/ \ncreated, what area does she live in, etc. The question may also be about \nconnection the subject may have, such as is she married, is she a sibling, \nwho she is owned by. Unwilling victims can resist with a Social \nChallenge. Grades of Success: Each grade gives an extra question. \nPlastic Body: Disciple Life, Adept Correspondence. The mage can \ncontort and stretch his body in unbelievable ways. He may contract \nparts of his body as small as three inches or stretch an appendage up to \na length of six feet (including his torso). Making a change of shape takes \none turn of concentration to complete and is very uncomfortable, \ncausing one level of bashing damage. The duration of the Effect is one \nround, and the mage’s body returns to its original shape immediately at \nthe end of the duration, even if the mage does not fit his present \nconfinements. The Storyteller should assign damage he sees fit for such \nan unfortunate occurrence. Grades of Success: Increase the grade of \nduration. \nPortal’s Herald: Initiate Correspondence, Apprentice Life; with \nInitiate Mind and Initiate Prime, or Disciple Spirit. When cast on a door, \nthe Portal’s Herald immediately alerts the casting mage when a living \nbeing crosses through the threshold. The base duration of the rote is one \nnight. Grades of Success: Increase the grade of duration. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nill i \nI \nPraise Asphalta: Disciple Correspondence, Initiate Spirit. This odd \nVerbena rote asks Asphalta, the goddess of parking lots and parking \nspaces, for assistance in finding a place to park a vehicle. After paying \nhomage to Asphalta, a parking space is found immediately, and it is \nalways near the place the mage wanted to go in the first place -usually \nless than 10 steps, and it isn't even a handicapped spot. Grades of \nSuccess: None. \nPrecipitate the Summoned Form: Adept Life, Disciple Spirit, \nInitiate Prime or Adept Mutter, Disciple Spirit, Initiate Prime. By \npreparing a body for a spirit, a Hermetic may force a summoned spirit \ninto a physical form. Some spirits will be more than happy about this, \nwhile others may become quite violent. While the spirit is in the \nphysical form, the mage holds no control over it except the threat of \nphysical harm. Older and more powerful spirits are not likely to feel \nthreatened by physical harm, as they know that the destruction of the \nform will not destroy them. The form is temporary, and is destroyed after \none hour or scene, whichever comes first. The new form has six Physical \nTraits, and its Mental/ Social Traits are based on the spirit's Gnosis; the \nform also starts with the normal number of health levels. Grades of \nSuccess: Increase the grade of duration, or increase the Physical Traits \nof the form by two Traits, or give the form an extra Healthy health level. \nPyro Manos: Initiate Forces. With this rote, taught to most new \nmembers of House Flambeau, the initiate lights a small chunk of \nsulphur and throws it at a target. A magical attack (typically a Physical \nChallenge) must be made to hit. If the mage succeeds in the challenge \nagainst the target, the chunk of sulphur explodes, causing one aggravated \nwound to the intended target. Grades of Success: None. \nRed Ones Go Faster: Initiate Forces. This odd little rote uses a \nlittle-known theory that says different wavelengths of light move faster \nthan others in certain situations. Mages use this rote to make things \nmove just a little bit faster than everything else by painting them red, \nas it is the lowest wavelengthofvisible of light, and therefore will reflect \nthe slowest wavelength of red while absorbing the faster wavelengths. \nHence the red object is given a little extra energy from all the other \nmore energetic wavelengths being absorbed. Anything that the Sons of \nEther use this rote on and paint completely red gains one extra step in \nmovement when in combat, and vehicles this rote is used on will move \n10 percent faster than normal. Sadly, the Effect is only temporary as the \npaint quickly becomes saturated with energetic light, so the Effect only \nlasts for one hourlscene. Grades of Success: None. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nRelease the Red Death: Adept Life, Disciple Spirit. This deadly rote \nis cast very rarely by the Verbena because of its indifference toward \ninnocent bystanders. The Effect summons a spirit of disease; the disease \nis different each time, but alwaysfatal. The spirit infects all living beings \nwithin a single building with a wasting disease. Each half-hour, the \nvictims lose one Physical Trait. Once they are out of Physical Traits, \nthey fall into a coma and suffer one level of lethal damage each half- \nhour. A Static Medicine Mental Challenge against three times the \nmage's Arete Traits is required to find a cure for the disease; magical \nEffects may also be used to find a cure. The disease usually manifests as \nsomething familiar, but in a highly resistant form. The disease is not \ncommunicable, because it is caused by the presence of the spirit, which \nis only present long enough to infect everybody in its target building. \nGrades of Success: None. \nRe-live Experience: Disciple Time, Apprentice Mind. The Cult of \nEcstasy is always looking for new experiences and new sensations. A lot \nof times they simply stare off into space and remember an experience \nfrom the past. This rote allows a Cultist to initiate a full recall of an \nexperience by doing something that emulates a sensation from the \nmoment in time she wishes to recall. If the Effect succeeds, the Cultist \ncan recall any detail from the experience vividly, and may make any \nappropriate Inoestigution, Alertness or other challenges to see if she can \nrecognize something from the scene that her subconscious picked up \nbefore. The mage only has a minute to do this before the flash of \nexperience will fade. Grades of Success: None. \nReveal the Holy Path: Disciple Correspondence, Apprentice Prime. \nBy making a prayer to the One and asking it to show the mage the path \nto the divine, the mage sees a glowing path before him that leads him \nto the closest source of Tass. Sometimes this leads the Chorister to \ncreatures or places that are not exactly holy .... This Effect will not \ndetect Quintessence within Avatars, but it will detect Nodes and Tass \nthat a mage may be carrying. Typical range starts at sight. Grades of \nSuccess: Each grade of success extends the range by one Correspondence \nrange block. \nRemove Divine Favor: Disciple Prime. This rote of the Celestial \nChorus is one of their more devastating weapons in war. With it the \nmage can cause the extra Quintessence within a Pattern to be expelled. \nThe effect causes one Trait of Quintessence to evaporate from a Pattern \nthat contains more Quintessence than is normal, such as Tass or a mage \nwith more Quintessence than his Avatar rating. The effect can only \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nremove Quintessence from one pattern. Typically this requires a Social \nChallenge between the attacker and target. Grades ofsuccess: Removes \none extra Quintessence per grade of success. \nRinging Strike: Disciple Matter. This technique is used by the \nAkashic Brotherhood to damage inanimate objects. It has been used by \nDoists to break swords with their bare hands, shatter stone columns with \na single kick, or destroy an opponent’s helmet with a head butt. The rote \nallows the mage to shatter Matter Patterns; it is either done with a weapon \nor a Do strike. The mage must make a magical attack challenge against \nthe inanimate object. If the object being worn or held by another \ncharacter, then he must make the magical attack challenge against the \nholder. This Effect can damage any non-magical material, but cannot \ndamage the Pattern of Wonders or of materials made with Muster-level \nMatter like Primium. Magically altered materials may be damaged as \nnormal. If the magical attack test is successhl, the object instantly takes \none health level of aggravated damage. If an object has no health levels, \nreduce any bonus Traits it gives, destroying the object when it is reduced \nto zero Traits. Grades of Success: Each grade of success causes an extra \nhealth level of damage to the object or removes one bonus Trait. \nSanctify Sacred Relic: Initiate Prime, Apprentice Mutter. Initiate \nChoristers preparing foci for larger ceremonies use this rote. Through \nvarious cleansing and purifying rituals, they prepare the focus. The next \nspell cast using this focus is at one difficulty less. This Effect may not be \ncombined with any other Effects that reduce the difficulty of creating \nmagical Effects. Grades of Success: None. \nSanctum’s Sense (also known as “Where are my Keys”): Initiate \nCorrespondence; with Apprentice Mutter or Apprentice Life. This rote \nis cast in a place familiar to the mage, usually with his Sanctum or home. \nIt allows the mage to locate any one thing he is looking for - \nhis keys, \nhis wallet, a handy gun or maybe a bug. The Life variation of this rote \nallows the caster to locate interlopers. Use the Correspondence ranges \nfor location range. Grades of Success: Grades increase the range as for \nCorrespondence Effects. \nSee the Tainted Soul: Apprentice Prime, Apprentice Spirit, Ap- \nprentice Entropy. The Choristers learned this long ago from a mysterious \nrace of half-men, half-angels who claimed to battle the evil of the \nworld. With proper cleansing rituals, the mage may see stains on \nanother’s soul that are sometimes left by exposure to Nephandi, some \ndemons and even by Jhor. By winning an Awareness Social Challenge \nagainst a target, the mage can discover how many traits of Entropic \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nResonance the target holds. Though this is not always a sure sign of the \nsubject being evil and a force of destruction, it does identify potential \nproblems. Grades of Success: None. \nSemi-Auto Cad-Cam: Disciple Matter, Master Correspondence. The \nrote allows the mage to combine two guns into a single weapon that has \nTraits from both weapons. The combined weapon looks like a patchwork \ngun with parts of both, and looks like no other weapon in existence. \nDuring the combination, the mage must choose two attributes from one \nweapon and two attributes from the other; the Negative Traits of both \nweapons are combined. For instance, Eddie wants to take his shotgun and \ncombine it with his pistol. He takes the bonus Traits from the shotgun \n(three); the concealability of the pistol (Pocket); the damage of the pistol \n(two lethal wounds); and lastly the Special Abilities of the shotgun (spray \nand mass trauma); the Negative Traits of this weapon are Loud x 2. What \nhe gets is a really small, really loud shotgun with a pearl-handled pistol \ngrip. The Effect lasts for one turn, and the weapon falls back into the two \noriginal guns. With sufficient duration, it might be possible to combine \nSemi-Auto Cad-Cam on multiple objects in a series. Grades of Success: \nEach grade of success increases the grade of duration. \nSense the Fleeting Moment: Apprentice Time. Through the use of \nastrology, a Verbena may figure out the exact moment to act on \nsomething so that the action has a better chance of succeeding. In game \nterms, the mage may choose one non-magical Ability and on the next \nuse of that Ability, receive a one-Trait bonus to that one challenge. \nGrades of Success: Increase the Trait bonus by one per grade of success. \nSharing the Experience: Disciple Mind, Initiate Correspondence, \nDisciple Time. This rote allows a Cultist of Ecstasy to share experiences \nand messages in instantaneous flashes of thought that are usually seen \nby most around them as only a lingering meeting of the eyes. Where \ntelepathy among other Traditions takes just as much time as talking \ndoes, this rote flashes meaningful experiences and visions between the \nCultists that they can easily interpret into conversation. The two rnages \nin the conversation may ask for a one-minute time-stop to discuss \nwhatever they wish to discuss privately. This minute should be timed \nby a Narrator and kept strictly down to a single minute to keep from \ninterfering with the game flow too much. Nothing other than \ncommunication can be done over this fleeting connection, and this \ncommunication can only be understood by other Cultists. Other \nTraditions receiving the visions are not able to process them properly \nand simply become confused by them. Grades of Success: None. \nI \nr \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nSolomon's Binding: Disciple Spirit, Disciple Correspondence. To \nstart this Effect, the Hermetic mage must create a seal of Solomon upon \nthe ground surrounded by a ring of salt. The ring of salt need not be \ncompleted until a spirit is summoned. Upon the summoning, the ring \nof salt is completed and the spirit is trapped within the circle. The spirit \nmay try to force its way out by winning a Static Physical Challenge \nagainst three times the mage's Arete; if it is unable to win the initial \nStatic Challenge, it cannot try to force its way out again for 24 hours. \nThe spirit may not affect anything outside the circle; if anything were \nbreak into the circle, it would break the binding and the spirit would be \nfree to leave any time thereafter. The spirit may be held in the binding \nfor as long as the physical circle of salt exists around the seal, or until \nthe spirit is able to force its way out. The spirit held by this binding is \nin no way under the mage's control. Grades of Success: None. \nSpirit Cloak: Initiate Mind, Initiate Spirit. This important rote is \ntaught to many Dreamspeakers early in their lives to give them a small \nedge in the spirit world. The denizens that call it home often take an \nunhealthy interest in amage walking along the spirit paths, so to protect \nthemselves, Dreamspeakers create this Effect to dim their presence to \notherworldly eyes. In game terms, this Effect makes it more difficult for \nspirits to notice the mage, giving her a one-Trait bonus on any Stealth \nand Subterfuge tests for one hourlscene. Grades of Success: Increase the \ngrade if duration, or increase the bonus by one Trait. \nSpoliatio Posterus ad Pensio Nam Nunc: Apprentice Correspon- \ndence, Apprentice Prime, Initiate Time. An apprentice Hermetic named \nStephanie Russel created this rote when her Chantry was in a pinch and \nneeded some quick Tass for a major Effect. It is done by measuring all \nthe possible factors that affect the strength of a Node - \nthe timing, ley \nlines and the flow of Prime energy. After calculating all of these \nvariables, the mage discovers the ideal place and time to gather Tass at \nthat Node, and gathers one extra Tass than usual. In game terms, the \nNode Background is increased by one for the session. This rote can only \nbe performed once a month on a Node, and after it is performed, the \nNode produces one less Tass in the next month - \ni.e., the Node \nBackground is reduced by one for the next month. Grades of Success: \nNone. \nThe Syndicate is in- \nterested in keeping everybody in the system, but sometimes a Deviant \nbecomes such a problem that the Syndicate needs to remove her so she \ncannot further affect the Technocracy's delicate machinery of economics \nSurprise, You're Dead!: Master Entropy. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nand influence. To do this, the Syndicate employs this insidious rote. It \nstarts with an obituary that declares the Deviant as dead. All the proper \npaperwork is processed, including coroner's report, burial schedules and \naccount closings. The victim's worldly ties slowly begin to disappear as \nher accounts are closed and turned over to the state. Contacts and \nSleeper associates also begin to believe the Deviant is dead, remembering \nto have witnessed her funeral, and may believe she is actually an \nimposter. In game terms, each month the victim loses the top level of \neach of her Influences, Allies, Contacts and Resources. The degradation \ncontinues until all of those Backgrounds go to nothing or the mage \nfigures out a way to stop the Effect. Any new Backgrounds bought while \nthe Effect is working are lost as well. Grades of Success: None - \nain't \nit bad enough already? \nTaliesin's Song: Disciple Matter, Disciple Spirit, Initiate Prime. In \nthe times when the world was young and the material and the spiritual \nwere one, it is said that the wizard-bard Taliesin could sing new things \ninto existence. Though the world has changed, parts of that original \nshaping song still remain. The mage begins this Effect by singing about \nthe object he wants to create as he mimes shaping it with his hands. He \nneeds no tools to craft the object, though an appropriate Crafts Ability \nmay be necessary. The rote draws ephemera from the Umbra and \nsolidifies it into a material object. The finished object may be made of \nany normal substance and may be any non-technological/mechanical \nobject that the mage desires. The object must be no larger than the \nmage's closed fist. Objects created this way sometimes suffer from \nUnbelief, especially if conjured in front of Sleepers. Paradox from this \nrote tends to unravel the item in question. Objects that don't degrade \nthusly still have a basic duration of only 10 minutes/ conflict. Grades of \nSuccess: Eachgrade expands the maximum object size by one handspan, \nor one grade can extend the duration by a grade. \nTrick Shot: Apprentice Correspondence, Apprentice Forces, Ap- \nprentice Time, Apprentice Entropy. The Trick Shot rote gives the mage \na better understanding of the forces, timing and distances involved in \nfiring a gun. In game terms, it gives the mage a one-Trait bonus on the \nnext firearms attack. Grades of Success: One grade allows the mage to \nricochet the shot off one object with no penalty. One more allows the \nricochet to hit a target that is behind full cover with no penalty. (The \nfirer must still win an attack challenge.) \nTrippy Light Show: Adept Mind or Initiate Forces. This Hollow \nOne rote requires that the area being affected have multiple, different \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ni \n\" \ncolored lights illuminating it. The Effect causes a single person to be \nconfused and dazzled by the lights in an area, leaving him distracted. \nThe victim of the Effect receives the Negative Mental Trait: Oblivious \nfor the one scenehour duration. Grades of Success: One grade allows the \nEffect to be extended to one more victim, or one grade gives the victim \none more Negative Trait up to a maximum of three. \nUndying Endurance: Disciple Life. The Cult of Ecstasy has used \nthis rote for more than a few millennia. Usually the Effect is activated \nby enchanting a garlic bulb -or, \nmore recently, a ginseng root - \nand \nthen the enchanted item is eaten by the person who needs theundying \nEndurance. From that point, for the rest of the session, that character \nmay expend any of his Physical Traits as if they are Stamina-related \nTraits. At the end of the session, the character is exhausted and unable \nto initiate any Physical Challenges for the rest of the day. Grades of \nSuccess: For one grade of success, the mage may add the option of letting \nthe character take levels of lethal damage and replenish three Physical \nTraits; damage taken in this way does not adversely affect the character \nunless he takes damage from any other source, then all penalties of his \ncurrent health status will take effect. A character reaching Mortally \nWounded while under this Effect can still function unless he has taken \ndamage from another source. Once the Effect ends, whatever damage \nhe has taken hits him all at once, so it's entirely possible for a mage to \nkill himself doing this. \nVoid Strike: Adept Spirit, Initiate Correspondence. This rote was \ncreated recently by a Dreamspeaker ecoterrorist. He first created this to \npush enemies into the Umbra where he was much more skilled and \nwould have the upper hand. After the appearance of the Avatar Storm, \nhe found a new use for it. He discovered that the same rote could be used \non mages to force them into the Umbra and therefore into the Avatar \nStorm. In game terms, when the Effect is peformed, a rift opens in the \nGauntlet to the Umbra. The attacker must win a magical attack \nchallenge (Social, if it's done solely with Correspondence manipulation; \nPhysical, if the attacker physically pushes) against the intended victim. \nIf he wins, the victim is unceremoniously dumped into the near Umbra; \nif the victim is a mage, she takes the damage from the Avatar Storm. \nGrades ofsuccess: None. \nWard the Inner Sanctum: Disciple Correspondence; Disciple Life, \nPrime, or Spirit. This rote is made to create specific bans on an area to limit \naccess according to the caster's needs. The Life version creates a ban (per \nthe ward effect of the Initiate Correspondence) against a specific person or \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ntype of creature, or to allow only a specific person or creature to enter. For \na violator to cross into the banned area, she must win a Static Physical \nChallenge against three times the caster's Arete Traits. The Spirit version \nacts the same as the Life version, except the invading spirit must win a \nStatic Willpower Challenge against two times the caster's Traits. The \nPrim version acts as a standing anti-magic shell around the banned area; \nany spell that is cast at anything inside the banned area has its casting \ndifficulty increased by the warding mage's Arete Traits. As with other \nwards and bans, the base duration is one hour or one scene, whichever \ncomes first, and can protect an area of 15 paces in diameter, plus three \npaces per Arete Trait. Grades ofsuccess: Each grade of success doubles the \narea diameter or increase the grade of duration. \nWoad Warrior: Disciple Life, Initiate Mind. The warriors of the \nancient Picts used to paint themselves in blue woad before battle, \nbelieving it would protect them. Roman soldiers were rarely prepared \nfor the sight of the howling, blue-painted boogeymen. The Verbena \nrecently rediscovered the rote used by the druids of the time to protect \ntheir warriors from the spears and swords of Roman soldiers. The \nVerbena creates a paste from a mix of herbs and clay and paints it in \ncurling knots and whorls on the person he wishes to enchant. If the \nEffect test is successful, the affected character receives no penalties from \nwounds and has one extra Healthy health level when he activates the \nwoad patterns by spending a Willpower Trait. The activated woad \nsends the character into a berserker frenzy bent on destruction. While \nthe woad is active, the affected character may initiate only Physical \nChallenges. Physical attacks that may be performed as Mental Challenges \n(such as Firearms) must bid Physical Traits. The Effect lasts for the rest \nof the session, or until the enchanted character spending a Willpower \nactivates it. Once activated, the Effect lasts for one combat or one \nminute, whichever comes first. Grades of Success: One grade gives the \ncharacter one extra Healthy health level per grade, or one grade of \nsuccess gives the effected character three extra Physical Traits. \nWork or Else: Disciple Spirit, Disciple Matter. Supposedly a Son of \nEther got the idea for this Effect from a Hermetic scholar who was \nresearching old magics of the Babylonians. The mage makes a vague \nthreat toward one of his technological foci to make it work more \neffectively. The next Effect cast with that focus has its casting difficulty \nreduced by one Trait. Foci under this Effect may be used together, but \nno more than a one-Trait bonus may be gained. Similar rotes, which \nreduce the difficulty of magical effects, cannot be stacked with this rote. \nGrades of Success: None. \n' \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nRules help a game to flow smoothly - \nat least, ideally. All too \noften, however, rules also become the focus of endless debate and \nargument. For a live-action game, that’s a problem; the game must run \nquickly and seamlessly, so that a dozen players don’t wind up standing \naround completely bored for an hour while the Storyteller and Narrators \nhave it out with a couple of recalcitrant players. \nTo that end, all of the rules in Laws of Ascension are designed to \nbe as streamlined and simple as possible. Inevitably, issues will crop up, \nregardless of the attention paid to detail. Therefore, the updates here \nultimately should only be used as a way to try to help a game, not simply \nto add more complexity. \nRight after “Have fun,” and just after the rules of safe play, the next \nmost important rule is: \nThe Storyteller is always right. \nllr- \n-- \nSome players make a habit of arguing the rules in hopes of garnering \nspecial privileges or pulling out weird benefits for their characters. \nThese players often consider rules a challenge in engineering, a way to \nwork “the system” in order to maximize the benefits for themselves. \nThey also tend to see the game as an antagonistic affair, with their \ncharacters pitted against all of the other characters and up against \nanything the Storyteller can throw at them. \nThe previous approach is fundamentally flawed. Live-action games, \nby their nature, often have large player bases. For everyone to have fun, \n* \n‘1 \n: \n- \nI \nb;-.-. \n>ST \neveryone must have a chance to participate. It’s not about centering on \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\none person as the protagonist to everyone else’s expense. It’s not about \n“beating the system” to force a Storyteller to comply with some absurd \nnotion supported by a convoluted interpretation of the rules. It’s about \nhaving a good time in a social setting with a shared story. \nThe result of this is: No amount of rules-lawyering or arguing can \nsave you from the Storyteller. It doesn’t matter that page XX of some \nrandom sourcebook says “You can blow up another character’s head \nwith this Effect without making a test.” If the Storyteller says it doesn’t \nfly, it doesn’t happen. This may be for any number of reasons. It’s a \nmistake to assume that the Storyteller does this just to screw with a \ncharacter. Storytellers also juggle huge games; it’s possible that something \nisn’t working as expected due to some unknown background condition \nthat the Storyteller’s aware of but isn’t sharing. Perhaps the Storyteller \nhas a character with certain exceptions to the rules. If the Storyteller \nmakes a call, it’s done. \nThis means that the player’s responsibility is to accept a Storyteller \nor Narrator’s ruling with good grace and allow the game to move on. \nStopping the game to argue an obscure point of rules over what is \nultimately an imaginary character is not only missing the point, it’s \nselfish. It’s demanding that the game come to a screeching halt so that \nyour character can have some perceived challenge to the Natural Order \nas represented by the Storyteller. The worst is taking advantage of a \nplayer who doesn’t know the rules well in order to destroy that player’s \nenjoyment of the game. Such antisocial behavior has no place in a \ncommunity-driven social activity. Characters can and will come to \nblows, but that doesn’t mean that it’s OK to have a character whose sole \npurpose is to exploit a rules loophole in order to blow up less rules- \nproficient players’ characters. Know when to step aside so that everybody \nmay participate. \nAll of this, of course, must still bow to the most important rule: \nHave fun. Sometimes Storytellers do make mistakes; they’re only \nhuman. Pointing out that something is potentially a mistake is no \ncrime. Once the Storyteller says“No, this is deliberate,” it’s time to drop \nthe issue and proceed with the game. Similarly, the Storyteller’s task is \nto provide a fun and compelling environment for many characters to \ninteract, not just to throw antagonists at the players’ characters. A \nStoryteller isn’t there to show off how he can make powerful critters \nthat can crush any player, or solve any plot problem with his pet \nNarrator character. Once the Storyteller’s rulings push the game out of \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nthe players’ hands and turn them into passive observers, they’re watch- \ning a (probably tragic) play, not participating in a game. \nOnce again, to quote a prodigious writer of game material, “Rules \nare nothing. Story is everything. Obey your Storyteller.” \nLive-action games aren’t contests or fights. They’re social activities \nfor everyone’s enjoyment. \nWith all that out of the way, here are some more ideas for speeding \nyour game along. \nNe INSTANT KILLS ($PTICBNAL RULE) \nThis rule only works if you’re willing to suspend a little disbelief in order \nto prohibit some charactersfrom exploitingsuper-powerful attackcombinations . \nIt’s never very fun to have an unbeatable antagonist, which is what \nhappens when someone’s rote performs instant-kill effects. Some rotes \ncan be powered-up with grades of success, potentially to the level of \nwhacking a character instantly. \nWhen in doubt, assume that it’s not possible to instantly kill a \nhealthy character with a single strike (whether from a spell or weapon \nor whatever). No Effect may kill a character who isn’t already at the \nMortally Wounded health level (or equivalent, for non-humans). \nThus, if you hit a perfectly healthy (or even Bruised, Wounded or \nIncapacitated) character with an Effect that somehow inflicts 10 levels \nof damage, all this does is bring the character to the Mortally Wounded \nhealth level. This may not make sense in some cases; if you drop \nsomeone into a volcano, hit a character with a Quintessence-charged \nBuick or otherwise perform a spectacular damaging feat, you’d expect \nthe victim to vaporize instantly. This rule simply keeps some players \nfrom charging around with super-spells ready to vaporize anyone in \ntheir way. It also means that a character must deliberately take an \naction to kill a downed opponent - \nsomething the Storyteller should \nplay up for the full realization of the literally murderous act about to be \ncommitted. \nTHE \nI-hw-Dw RULE \n( @ ~ C B N A L  \nRULE) \nThis rule only works if your combat-heavy chronicle has people dropping \nlike flies, and needs to insure that everyone gains a little breathing room and \nat least a chance to retaliate in battle. \nOccasionally, even with the No Instant Killsrule (above), wandering \nhit squads will jump characters and make short work of them in a single \nturn. Actually, it’s pretty common. T o  mitigate this, you might make \ncombat a more protracted and risky affair by making it harder to kill \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\npeople with large attacks. Under this system, no attack, regardless of \ngrades of success or magnitude, can inflict more than three health \nlevels. Thus, several turns are necessary to pull apart avictimcharacter, \nunless the attackers come up with a complex plan (and somehow \nmanage to avoid using a mob challenge, which should happen \nautomatically if they gang up, so that each can do damage separately). \nThis rule only works if you feel the need for victims to have a last-ditch \nbit of justice so that no fight is a “sure thing.” \nWhen the brute squad rolls up on a hapless foe and has a cunning \nplan in mind, sometimes the victim pretty much folds up and dies at \nonce without a chance to do anything. This isn’t very sporting, and if \nthere’s absolutely no risk to the attackers, it’s very one-sided- and also \ntends to generate more such brute squads, as people gang up to form \ncabals specifically designed to take out their enemies without ever \nhaving to risk a counter-attack. \nWith this rule, a character who’s about to die - \nthat is, just suffered \nan attack that would Incapacitate the individual or worse- may spend \none Willpower Trait and immediately perform one action at full, normal \nAttribute Trait values. Thus, even if the brute squad busts out on a \nhapless soul and pounds the victim into the ground, removing all Traits \nand kicking the sod into the Dead health level, the victim can spend \nthat last ounce of Willpower to make a single action as if none of those \nAttribute Traits were lost. (The character must still apply penalties for \nbeing Bruised and Wounded, unless another Willpower Trait is spent \nor other magic supersedes this. Incapacitation and worse don’t apply to \nthis action.) The victim isn’t guaranteed a win and doesn’t get back any \nlost Quintessence, Willpower or Abilities, but at least has one chance \nto make the attackers hurt. \nImmediately after Final Retribution is done, the character becomes \ncomatose or expires, at the discretion of the attackers. (You can’t use \nthis rule to get in a final shot and deliberately avoid capture by killing \nyourself.) \nYou may only use Final Retribution once in any fight. Seesawing \nback and forth around the Incapacitated health level with healing \nmagic doesn’t mean that you can do this many times. \nFINAL \nRTRIBUT‘ICBN \n(G~PTICBNAL RULE) \nC ~ I B A T  \n~ ~ B I L I T Y  \n(~PTICBNAL \nRULE) \nThis rule only works if you want to represent the benefits of flexibility in \ncombat response situations. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nAs per Laws of Ascension, p. 193, a typical character can move up \nto three normal-sized paces in a single action. \nCharacters with enhanced speed can take multiple movement \nactions: A mage with two actions can thus move six paces. \nCharacters with special Devices or Effects might be able to fly or \nmove with incredible speed. Typically, this allows the character to \ndisengage by Fair Escape if the opponent has no plausible way of \nstopping the target. For instance, a character with a jet pack fighting a \ngroup of club-wielding thugs can, as an action, declare Fair Escape by \nflying up and away. If one of the thugs pulls out a gun, though, the \ncombat must continue until the flying character manages to escape or \nis shot down. \nA character who has higher ground, partial cover or enhanced \nmobility - \nsuch as the aforementioned jet-pack wearing trooper, or \nsomeone fighting from the top of stairs with a sword, or from behind a \ncar door - \ngains a one-Trait bonus due to beneficial circumstances. \nMob challenges are some of the worst nightmares for Storytellers; \nthey’re slow and some people don’t quite “get it,” which can make them \neasily exploited. Keep the following things in mind with a mob \nchallenge, and you’ll be OK. \n1. No talking. Players who’re waiting for their turn tend to kibitz \namong themselves. This disrupts the game and slowly escalates the \nvolume. If you catch people stepping out of character to chit-chat while \nwaiting, give one warning; after that, pull the player from the scene and \nassign an appropriate penalty. (“Oh, you decided to chit-chat with your \nfriends so I’d pull you from the scene and you’d ‘escape’? Gotcha. \nMortally Wounded. Enjoy.”) \n2. No arguing. This goes hand-in-hand with “The Storyteller is \nalways right.” Every player should have one appeal for any given ruling, \njust to point out if something might be a mistake. But nobody else butts \nin, and if the player insists on arguing, pull the player out of the scene. \nIt’s not fair or fun for all of the other players to wait on one arguing \nantagonist’s rules cheese. \n3. No more than five people per physical mob against a normal \nopponent. A normal, human-size opponent can suffer a mob challenge \nphysically from five, normal human-size enemies. Any more than that \nand they have to stand back and wait. You can’t fire through such a \ncrowd without potentially hitting the people in the way, too. Thus, for \nR ’ ‘i \n.‘.-. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nphysical mob challenges, limit it to five people. The Storyteller and \nNarrators decide who’s close enough and who waits. \nAce - \nParadox hangs; character holds the Paradox points \nuntil next backlash. \nNumber Card - \nRegular Paradox backlash; the character \nsimply suffers damage. \nFace Card - \nLasting Paradox effect; the character garners \na troublesome Flaw, of a type determined by the suit (see below). \nClubs- Physical effect. The Paradox has a physical backlash: \nThe character might suffer from static build-up, muscle spasms, \nppearance change, bad body odor, changes to clothes, \nppearance of strange items, changing certain items (like all \nmilk products becoming rancid within 10 paces, all clocks \nrunning backward when touched) or other manifestations on \nphysical, material processes. \nDiamonds - \nMental effect. The Paradox has a mental \nbacklash: The character has trouble translating short-term \nHearts - Emotional effect. The Paradox has a social \nacklash: The character suffers radical mood changes, gives off \nemotional states to others, causes animals to behave strangely, \ncolors all interactions with some emotional by-product (like all \nliquids taking on a color according to the character’s emotions), \nor otherwise has Social-related Attributes played out. \nSpades - \nSpiritual effect. The Paradox has some sort \nsupernatural backlash: The character leaves a smoke trail in t \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n4. If multiple people assault someone using similar attack forms, \nthey must mob. You can’t decide “not” to mob challenge an enemy just \nso that you and your friends can all potentially do three levels of damage \nin separate attacks and bypass some of the damage reducing optional \nrules previously listed. If you and your buddies gang up on an enemy \nwith physical attacks, you must use the mob challenge rules, because you \nare a mob. \n~ I ~ I T E D  \nmms ($PTI@NAL RULE) \nThis rule only works if your game has an abundance of multiple mobs all \nchallenging victims at once, and you want to stretch realism for playability. \nSometimes a mob challenge gets way out of hand, as a physical mob \nwades into combat while a couple of mental and social attack power \nmobs hang back and target the same individual. Once again, such beat \nsquads have a tendency to wreck just about anything. You may want this \nto be the case in your game, so that nobody feels invincible; on the other \nhand, you might have a mob challenge on your hands with 50 people \nall attacking one or two victims (this happens a lot at large convention \ngames). \nFor the sake of expedience, assume that no more than one mob of \neach attack type can assault a given victim. This means five physical \nattackers as one mob, five mental attackers as a second mob and five \nsocial attackers as a third mob. Anyone else must wait for an opening. \nPlayers naturally learn to dread the intervention of the Paradox \nJudge. This is in some ways as it should be: Mages should never just \n“shrug off Paradox. It’s a balancing force, and not always a fair one. \nDon’t mistake this, however, for making the Paradox Judge out to be a \nbad guy. While the Paradox Judge may not be buddy-buddy with all of \nthe players, the players also shouldn’t have the impression that the \nJudge is someone to be hated or someone who’s out to screw them over. \nAt the same time, Paradox itself is not always impartial or even- \nhanded. Some players may feel they’ve gotten a raw deal with Paradox. \nThis happens. They must learn to live with it. It’s one of the foibles of \nMage. \nP m e x  PLAYING Dex \nIf you don’t have the time or inclination to build a custom Paradox \ndeck out with 3” x 5” cards, you can always use a regular deck of playing \ncards for your Paradox effects. It’s simple. Have a player draw a card \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n'b \nc \nwhenever Paradox fires off. Reshuffle. Repeat ad infinitum. You might \nsometimes remove a card from the deck in order to keep people from \nsuffering the same sorts of Paradoxes. If you don't want the headache of \nrunning Paradox spirits and realms, just remove the Jokers. \nIn order to spread out your probabilities, you can use the following \nlayout of the cards: \nIf you really want to go all-out, you can customize your deck, so that \neach card indicates a specific Paradox problem. For instance, you might \ndecide that you really want to emphasize Paradox Flaws; to do so, \nreverse the effects of face and numbered cards, thereby making backlash \ndamage less common and Flaws more so. You could have a table that \nindicates a specific Paradox backlash for each card: the 10 of hearts \nmight mean broadcasting melancholy while the nine of hearts indicates \nsudden bouts of rage. You'll want to change these from time to time just \nto keep players on their toes. \n&PUTATI@N SYSTEITIS \nWhile mages can and do have a complex system of Reputation, it's \nsometimes a bear to track - \nespecially for games networked across \nmultiple chronicles, where characters might gain or lose Reputation \naccording to different standards. For this reason, Storytellers need to be \nclear on having specific standards for Reputation. You may want to \nindulge in the following rules to clarify your Reputation system. \nS L ~ W  \nREPUTATI~N \nBUILD \n(@PTI~NAL RULE) \nThis rule only works if you want to limit Reputation to long-term works \nower the course of a potentially lengthy game. \nNo character can gain more than one Reputation Trait per session. \nIf the character gains Reputation from improving a Sphere to a higher \nlevel (going from a Disciple to an Adept, for instance), that's the only \nReputation the character gains in that session. The character wouldn't \ngain any Reputation for noteworthy deeds or chantry positions until a \nlater session. \nThe order of precedence is Reputation for Sphere achievement, \nthen positions, then notable deeds. \nThere's no limit to how much Reputation a character can lose in \nagame, though. The journey up is tough; the fall is fast anduncontrolled. \nThis rule only works if you're having problems with people gaining \nReputation every game by specifically doing one big thing each game and then \nsitting around. \nSTAGGERED \nREPUTATKBN BUILD \n( @ P T I ~ A L  RULE) \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCharacters don’t gain a Reputation just for one great deed. The \nStoryteller should track a character’s noteworthy achievements - \nthings that the Storyteller hears about after the game or witnesses in \nplay. (If people don’t see it or hear about it, you won’t gain Reputation \nfor it.) Each time a character does something noteworthy, this gains one \npoint toward more Reputation. Each time the character does something \ndumb, this loses one such point. To gain a new Reputation Trait, the \ncharacter must amass a number of partial points equal to the current \nnumber ofTraits. So, an Apprentice with only one AcceptedReputation \nTrait would gain a deed-based Trait for a single noteworthy deed, while \na Master would have to perform at least five, because people expect \nmore from characters who already have a strong Reputation and a lot \nof skill. \nREPUTATICBN \nERCBSICBN \n(@FTI~NAL RULE) \nThis rule only works if you’re running a long-term game where the \ncharacters gain Reputation and then just sit on it. \nReputation is very much a “What have you done for me lately?” \nsystem. A character loses one deed-earned ReputationTrait every three \ngame sessions. The character must constantly perform noteworthy \ndeeds in order to keep a high Reputation. \n~ P U T A T I ~ N  \nIb,x~mums \n(@PTI~NAL RULE) \nThis rule only works if you want to make Reputation a more closed-in, \nchallenging system, instead of an open-ended system of legendary social \nstanding. \nSome characters will do their best to gain Reputation at every turn, \ngoing to as many games as possible and being loud and flamboyant to \ndraw notice. These characters may occasionally rocket up in Reputation \nto obscene heights - \n12, 15, even 20 or more Reputation Traits. To \nlimit this, allow no character to gain more Reputation than double the \ncharacter’s Rank, plus Destiny. Thus, an Apprentice (Rank 1) with \nDestiny x 4 could have a maximum of six Reputation Traits. People \nexpect more from high-ranking characters or characters destined for \ngreat things, but will in return give them accolades when they achieve \nskillful things. \nNEGATIVE REPUTATICBN \n(@FTICBNAL RULE) \nThis system only works if you need a way to socially punish characters \nwho constantly flout the Traditions and don’t expect any sort of social \nconsequences. \ni ; \n‘\nI\n \n’ *A‘ I \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nA character who repeatedly and demonstrably screws up in mage \nsociety not only risks the punishments of the Traditions, but could gain \na nasty Reputation to boot. A character might potentially gain one \nnegative Reputation Trait: Witless, Tactless, Brash, Obnoxious, Pushy \nand the like are all possibilities. A negative Reputation Trait can be \nassigned by a Storyteller or by any means that would be sufficient to strip \nReputation Traits from a character. This Reputation Trait counts as a \nNegative Trait against the character and can be used as such, and the \nPolitics Ability does allow opponents to know about it. \nA character may have as many negative Reputation Traits as his or \nher maximum Reputation total (there might be no maximum, if you \ndon’t establish a top end). A character may have both positive and \nnegative Reputation at the same time. \nCRCDSSWERS \nCrossover games, even moreso than mob challenges, present a host \nof nightmares for Storytellers. What power trumps what? Who has the \nupper hand? What the heck is the mood and theme of the game, \nanyway? Some stories, though, subsist on the collision of the very \ndifferent natures of World of Darkness inhabitants. \nIt’s impossible to present a totally comprehensive guide to all things \ncrossover. There’s too much to track and it would require that every \ngame developer become totally enmeshed in the ongoing work of every \ngame line. Storytellers will have to judge many cases for themselves, but \nthe guidelines here may help at least a little. \nP ~ W E R  \nSQURCE \nSIEPARATICBN \n(@FTI~NAL RULE) \nThis rule only works if you need to keep your players from being “buddy- \nbuddy” between supernatural types and trying to share around their power \nsources. \nVitae is not Gnosis is not Quintessence. While mages can perform \nphenomenal transmutative feats, it’s no simple matter to pull the mystic \nenergy out of other supernatural creatures, and it’s even harder to turn \nit into something else. \nA supernatural creature’s power reserve up to its Willpower rating \nis considered inviolable, just like a mage’s Quintessence from the \nAvumr Background. Thus, a mage facing off against a vampire with \nthree Willpower Traits cannot remove the power from the vampire’s \nlast three Blood Traits, short of actually cutting the vampire open and \nsuctioning the blood out. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nBy the same token, a mage cannot simply remove magical energy \nfromother creatures’ power sources, or change power from one type into \nanother. The mage must have specific Lore relating to the creature type \nand must build a rote that accounts for the shift. This requires at least \nPrime (for working with Quintessence) and usually two other Spheres \nas well (Matter and Life for vampires, Spin’t and Life for shapeshifters, and \nsoonasdetailedinLaws of Ascension onpp. 266-271).The magemust \nalso have extensive study with the power source. A mage doesn’t just \npick up some vampire blood and suck the magical potential out of it; the \nmage must fundamentally understand how and why vitae holds magical \nenergy. Even if a mage has the know-how to do this, the energy always \ncarriesResonance (generally Entropic for vampires and ghosts, Dynamic \nfor shapeshifters and changelings). Trying to turn Quintessence without \nthe right Resonance into a different supernatural power type is doomed \nto failure: You cannot, for instance, take Gnosis, turn it into Dynamic \nQuintessence, and then turn it into vitae, because vitae has Entropic \nResonance, not Dynamic. Similarly, if your mage wants to conjure \nvampire blood, it must have Entropic Resonance. \nA mage cannot simply inject Quintessence into a different \nsupernatural creature’s Pattern. The difference between mage and \ncritter is too great. Therefore, a mage cannot (for example) cause a \nvampire to never need blood by just giving the vampire transmuted \nQuintessence; the vampire would still require blood. Similarly, a mage \ncannot easily restore a werewolf s Gnosis. \nJust by way of keeping things from getting really out of hand, a \nStoryteller should probably never allow a mage to duplicate specific \nsupernatural qualities of a power type. That is, a mage cannot simply \nconjure a sample of sixth-generation vampire blood and use it to make \nsome seventh-generation vampires. \nVrnPIWS \nSince vampires often permeate many levels of human society and \ntry to move invisibly through supernatural circles, they’re natural \nadversaries to mages. The book Blood Treachery even covers, in detail, \nsome of the potential consequences of such a secret war. Both sides \ncrave influence and hope to shape the future of human society. As a \nresult, they’ll almost inevitably butt heads. \nIdeally, crossover interaction with vampires should come down \nmostly to Influence Backgrounds. The Technocracy doesn’t crack \ndown on vampires as much as it could, simply because it has less \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nexperience with vampire-hunting than with mage-hunting. Tradition \nmages trying to protect and promote specific social programs will often \nrun afoul of the influence of conservative vampires who want to \nmaintain the corrupt status quo. This can be a perfect game of dodging \nhidden bullets as each side slowly becomes aware of the other without \nresorting to physical combat. \nMore commonly, though, games will feature a cast of multitudes, \nwherein mages confront the undead directly or vice versa. There are \nseveral important points to keep in mind: \nA mage below Archmaster level cannot remove the Curse of \nCaine. Turning a vampire back into a mortal for more than a minute \nrequires fighting a primal curse with tens of thousands of years of \nhistorical inertia behind it. \nBy the same token, no rotes exist of “Transmute vampire to lawn \nchair.’’ While this oft-discussed humorous sort of transmutation might \nbe theoretically possible, remember that magic follows paradigm, and \nparadigm followsTradition teachings. The Order of Hermes specifically \nforbids dealing with vampires. Verbena, Akashic Brothers and \nEuthanatosconsider themunnatural, and avoid them. Other Traditions \nrarely encounter them. The upshot is that most Traditions don’t have \nthe knowledge of vampires necessary to make effects specifically to \naffect them in such gross ways. (As another writer said, “Okay, you \ntransmute the vampire into a gingerbread man. It’s now a six-foot-tall \ngingerbread man animated by the blood of Caine.”) \nIn brute-force contests, vampires tend to win. They’re more \nresilient than mages, and their powers are slightly easier for them to \nlearn. Conversely, mages with a lot of set-up time or an arcane \nconnection can make unlife very difficult for the undead by using long- \nrange attacks and things that vampires can’t easily counter, like spirits. \nSpecific instances of stuff you might want to know can go like this. \nA vampire’s Obfuscate Discipline is mental. Thus, it’s resisted by \na mage’s Mind Sphere Effect of Mind Shielding. If a mage has Mind \nShielding, use a standard Mental Challenge between the two to see if the \nvampire’s unnoticed or not. Treat the mage’s level of the Mind Sphere \nas equivalent to levels of Auspex for purposes of modifying the challenge \ndifficulty. Conversely, a vampire can use Auspex to try to notice a mage \nwho’s invisible with Forces, Mind or Life, in each case contesting it just \nlike it’s Obfuscate. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nMages will probably want to make their blood toxic or simply \nunpalatable to vampires. This is doable with a Life Effect to transmute \npersonal Pattern (to make it valueless) and with Prime to make it a \nweapon (to make it toxic). Doing so will cause Pattern bleeding because \nit alters the nature of the mage’s own blood. \nA vampire’s Chimerstry works normally against mages, just like \nthey’re mortals. A mage can use Mind to contest it just like a vampire \nwith Auspex. \nAuspex (Telepathy) and Dominate must penetrate a Mind Shield as \nwell to have an effect on a mage. As a general rule of thumb, a Mind \nShield created with Mind Sphere magic at least equal to the Dominute \nlevel (Basic Mind versus Basic Dominate, for instance) offers a special \nretest against the Dominate. \nSince Presence is a Social Discipline and works on spiritual ties as \nwell as emotions, you might want to have mages defend against it with \nSpirit instead of Mind (especially for powers like Summon that clearly \nwork over long distances according to supernatural ties). This functions \njust like a Mind Shield: A special retest against the power in question. \nNecromancy, Spirit Munipuhtion and Spirit Sphere all resolve by \ncontesting between the opposing controllers (vampire’s appropriate \nAttribute Traits versus mage’s appropriate Attribute Traits), with a \ndifference in levels granting a one-Trait up bonus (one Trait for having \nIntermediate power against an opponent’s Basic, for example). \nSunlight Corresponded from other parts of the world causes full \ndamage to vampires. Sunlight created or transmuted must use Prime to \nbe fully vibrant. \nThe Animalism power Quell the Beast works on emotions like \nPresence, by contesting the vampire’s Beast against the victim’s instinct, \nso it’s shielded against with Spirit. \nThe Spirit’s Touch power always picks up a mage’s Resonance as \npart of any image that includes the mage in any way, unless the mage \nspecifically used an effect to remove the Resonance from an area. \nA mage can invoke countermagic against vampiric Thaumaturgy \nusing the normal countermagic rules. You might require a mage to have \nat least a modicum of Vampire Lore to do this, since Thaumaturm isn’t \nquite the same as Hermetic magic any more. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nS HAPESHIFERS \nSome players assume that, since it’s possible for mages to be Kinfolk \nand some mages (like Dreamspeakers and Verbena) have a respect for \nthe natural world, that mages and shapeshifters canget along beautifully. \nThis is a horribly mistaken notion. As the werewolves and other \nchangers see it, mages perform feats that are fundamentally wrong; they \ninvoke powers they shouldn’t have, which is why Gaia punishes them \n(with Paradox). Worse still, mages and werewolves sometimes clash \nover places of natural power - \nthe Garou caerns, which also sometimes \nserve as mage Nodes. These fights are no-holds-barred, as the Garou \nbattle to protect their sacred areas. \nRemember the following when dealing with mage-shapeshifter \ninteraction: \nEven moreso than with vampires, mages are flimsy compared to \nshapeshifters. As normal humans, mages will tend to die in two turns (or \nless! ) against even a single moderately experienced shifter. \nMages don’t have the ability to artificially change a Pattern from \na human into a werewolf, or vice versa. You can’t just reshape someone’s \nLife/ Spirit Pattern into a werewolf. Attempting to do so tends to draw \ndown the wrath of Gaia and the related spirits. \nSpeaking of spirits, mages don’t have any sort of Pact the way that \nGarou do. While spirits are inclined to at least talk to Garou and deal \nwith them reasonably fairly, they have no compunctions about just \nkilling or cheating mages out of hand. A mage cannot assume that just \nbecause he’s a Garou ally he will gain any special favors from the Garou \nspirits. Hand-in-hand with this, mages can’t necessarily guarantee that \na given child will be a full-fledged Garou, although mages could barter \nwith spirits for intercession in this matter and a Master of Spirit could \nprobably compel a powerful spirit to “fudge things” (with severe \nconsequences down the road for such arrogance, of course). \nMages are immune to the Delirium, but this doesn’t mean that a \nmage is stupidly oblivious in the face of a nine-foot-tall furry killing \nmachine. Most sensible mages - \nespecially those who know nothing \nabout shapeshifters - \nwill run like madmen without needing the \nDelirium as incentive. \nSpecific rules might go as follows: \nFor powers that work with supernatural concealment, treat this \nmuch like the interaction of mages with vampiric Obfuscate or Auspex. \nThus, a mage uses Mind to penetrate Blissful Ignorance. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nPowers that create social effects should be resisted with Spirit \nmagic: If a Garou uses Roll Over to force subservience, for instance, the \nmage uses a Spirit shield to protect against this and gain a retest \n(assuming the mage already had such a shield in place). \nPowers that change speeds (like Rage or Spirit of the Fray) are, of \ncourse, countered with Time magic. A mage can use Time to try to \ncancel any of these powers, but requires a test against the Garou. For \ninstance, canceling Spirit ofthe Fray requires the mage to make an Arete \nchallenge for a Time Effect, then make a challenge against the Garou \n(Mental versus Physical in this case). If the mage wins, the Spirit of the \nFray is retroactively removed in a sort of “time crunch,” even though \nthe Garou normally would’ve gone first. Otherwise, it’s a fine red mist \nof mage. \nNo Garou will allow mages into a caern. Period. Even Kinfolk. \nThis is “allowing a caern to be violated,” since mages are known caern- \nraiders. No amount of fast-talking will cover this. Spirits (who help \ntrack Garou Renown) will take note of this and punish Garou who \nviolate this rule, if the other Garou don’t get to them first. \nMages can’t perform shapeshifter rites. A mage can simulate a \nGarou rite with Spirit magic, but unless compelled or bartered with, \nspirits won’t respond to the rites as they would to a shapeshifter. \nWRAITHS \nFew mages want anything to do with the Shadowlands. The realms \nof the Dead are not a place for mortals to walk. Nonetheless, ghosts do \nhaunt the living, and sometimes mages are the intermediaries for them. \nDealing with wraiths is somewhat troublesome; dealing with the \nUnderworld itself is exceedingly dangerous. Keep the following caveats \nin mind: \nA mage uses Spirit magic on wraiths, as with other spirits; most \ncompulsions require a Social Challenge. A wraith can spend a Pathos \nTrait for one retest on a Spirit-backed binding or compulsion. \nA mage must combine Spirit with Mind for any Effect that would \ntry to penetrate wraith concealment or trickery on the other side of the \nShroud - \nfor instance, to look into the Shadowlands and see a wraith \nhidden with Argos. If the wraith manifests across the Shroud, on the \nother hand, Spirit isn’t necessary except to smack the wraith directly. \nThus, if a wraith tries to Skinride a mage, the mage can defend with Mind \nalone, but could only counterattack by adding Spirit. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nA mage’s Pattern Effects go through incorporeal wraiths just like \nnormal things - \nmage-created fire is no different from normal fire to \nan incorporeal wraith, and equally ineffective. \nMost mages won’t understand the workings of the Shadow or \nCatharsis. Mages with a lot of study of wraiths might be able to tell the \ndifference between the two states with Mind and Spirit magic. \nMagic working in the Underworld itself is very, very dangerous. \nCrossing into the Underworld (without a Shallowing or like) \ndoes cross the Avatar Storm. \nOnce in the Underworld, the mage is at grave risk. A failed \nattempt to return, or being “killed” in the Underworld, means that the \nmage dies and becomes a wraith there. \nAny Effect done in the Underworld automatically has extra \nEntropic Resonance. \nThe necrotic effects of the Underworld leach away magical wards \nand creations, causing their durations to unravel with one less grade of \nduration. Thus the mage must generate more grades of success to keep \nprotections and sensory Effects and conjurations running. \nCHANGELINGS \nThe so-called Fair Folk would seem to have a lot of natural \ninteraction with Tradition mages - \nboth sides champion creativity, \nthe magical world and mysticism. Indeed, the Verbena and the Order \nof Hermes explicitly consider faeries and changelings a necessary \ncomponent of their magical worldview. Still, relations between \nchangelings and mages have often been rocky, for many reasons. At \nleast both sides are usually not actively hostile. \nChangelings’ biggest defense, the Mists, works equally well against \nmages as against anyone else. This means that mages often don’t \nremember their interactions with changelings, chalk up changeling \npowers to coincidence and coincidental magic, and usually can’t \nremember anything they learn from the fae. Changelings, on the other \nhand, may find some mages too banal to deal with. \nAs some rules of thumb, assume the following: \nTechnocrats average Banality 9 or 10, because they’re typically \nConditioned, procedurally oriented and not given to a whole lot of \nfanciful imagination. Some rare theoretical or abstract scientists might \nhave a lower Banality because of their sense ofwonder and imagination \nabout science, but even they don’t believe in faeries and are thus \npoisonous to changelings. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTradition mages have wildly varying Banality ratings: stratified \nTraditions like the Order of Hermes and Technomantic Traditions like \nthe Virtual Adepts tend to have Banality ratings of 7 or 8. Highly \nmystical and whimsical mages like Verbena and some immature Cultists \nof Ecstasy might go as low as 5 .  (A Cultist on a binge could temporarily \ndip to a 3 or 4.) \nMages have no special capacity to see or interact with fae miens, \nalthough mages can be enchanted like anyone else. \nFor a mage to figure out how to do “faerie magic” and see the \nDreaming, the mage must have enoughLore to understand the workings \nof Glamour, changelings and the Dreaming, and Mind and Spirit magic. \nUnfortunately, since almost anything a mage learns disappears with the \nMists, this means that very few mages will ever know enough to build \nsuch an Effect or remember how to do it later. \nA mage who scans through Mist-distorted memories with Mind \nmay realize “Something has magically altered these memories,” but \nwon’t necessarily understand what or how, or how to undo it, without \nappropriate Lore. \nA changeling may enact countermagic against a mage’s Effect just \nlike trying to cancel an opposing Glamour, but gains a Banality Trait \nfor doing so. \nMages can and do generate Glamour like regular mortals when \nthey’re inspired. Cultists of Ecstasy are the most likely to have friendly \nlong-term relations with the fae, followed by the Verbena (who often \nsee changelings as threatening) and then distantly by the Order of \nHermes (who have a few members who specialize in faerie magic). \n“Making up rotes” doesn’t count as artistic inspiration, though. The \nmage must do something of phenomenal breakthrough creativity, like \ndeveloping an entirely new metaphysical theory. \nIn all cases of “appropriate Lore” for crossovers, the assumption is 4 \nor 5 levels - \nenough that the mage has been immersed in that \nsubculture and fully understands that creature type’s (un)life style and \nsupernatural qualities. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nMages have, potentially, all the universe to explore. Unfortunately, \nthe universe is a big place, which means that it can be a real headache for \nStorytellers! This is especially true for a game with a budget and limited \navailable space. \nHow does one go about setting a story in many exotic sets without \nhaving the means to fly people out “on location?” A little preparation \nand a lot of imagination, of course. As usual, the key is early prep work \n-get \nto the site before hand and turn it into the type of site you want \nor need. \nMany places make good settings for Mage games. Some can easily \nbe dressed up into something phenomenal with just a little work. Of \ncourse, the Storyteller should be aware of the advantages and \ndisadvantages of each site beforehand - \nhence, the ideas presented \nhere. \nLKALPARKS \nBenefits: Usually have plenty of space, often free \nDrawbacks: Very public, rarely have actual rooms \nA local park often serves as one of the first meeting places for a \nbrand-new game. It’s generally cheap and spacious enough that everyone \ncan fit in without worry to cost or elbow room. Mages among the \nDreamspeakers and Verbena find these settings right at home, but often \nlocal parks are small enough and centrally located enough that other \nmages will find them easy to visit, too; this makes it convenient for \neveryone in the game to plausibly show up. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe largest problem with a local park is its very public venue. The \ntroupe must take extreme care to avoid drawing too much attention \nfrom the local populace. While a little curiosity isn't bad, especially if \nit brings new players, a game with players running around screaming \nand pantomiming combat or massive magical Effects may draw lots of \nnegative attention. There's also no easy way to dress up the park or \nseparate it into rooms. Without multiple rooms, there's a tendency for \nthe players to stick together in large clumps, which makes running \nstorylines much more difficult. It's easier to run a plot with a small group \nto manage instead of trying to cover things for dozens of people at once. \nYour best bet with a park is to have multiple Narrators on hand to \nsplit up the players into groups. Work out plotlines that cover different \nareas of the park, and fire them off simultaneously; this way, your players \nare forced to split into smaller groups. You don't have any way to easily \nrepresent exotic costuming or locations, so you'll have to rely on \ndescriptions, but you can bring pictures or sketches to indicate special \nthings. \nA few parks have an entertainment center that you can use. If you \ncan make arrangements ahead of time, you can often have access to a \nroom or two at a minimal cost. This provides you with an opportunity \nto dress up a single area as an office, complex, part of a larger building \nor whatever you need on the spot. \nAlso, be careful of weather conditions. Character sheets and \nParadox cards often don't survive well against sudden rain and wind. \nSTATE CBR NATI~AL \nPARKS \nBenefits: Large; may have organized buildings for camping \nDrawbacks: Usually cost money; sometimes too public; require \nupkeep from the rangers \nFor a large-scale game with a little money, a state or national park \npresents a special opportunity. Most troupes can't afford to host a game \nin an entire city block or apartment complex of their own. Renting out \na campsite at a large park, though, provides just as much room. \nSome parks are purely natural preserves, with simple benches, trails \nand the occasional pavilion. These parks run much like small local \nparks, above. The advantage lies in the ability to split people up along \nspecific landmarks or areas of the park, since the park often has multiple \nsmall clearings with wooden furnishings - \nleftovers of public works \nimprovements. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCamping sites offer the unique opportunity to spend the night in a \ngame, if you don't mind shelling out money for rentals and organizing \nschedules ahead of time. This opens the door to a fully immersive game. \nYou can often find sites that rent small cabins for the weekend, and use \nthem as different locations. This even lets you set the game easily in the \nUmbra or in different times, since you can put special signs up on \nspecific cabins or use different cabin blocs to represent different sites. \nIf you're not careful, though, you may find frequent interruptions a \nproblem for your game. While state and national parks often have an \nabundance of back trails that allow for some privacy, there's also the \nconstant chance of hikers or campers passing through. Your best bet is \nsimply to suspend game play until they move on, or drop to soft \nroleplaying (no challenges) for the duration. \nFurthermore, state and national parks abide by multiple special \nlaws. Most of these won't be a problem - \nas long as you're following the \nbasic Mind's Eye Theatre rules, and you eschew weapons, drinking, \netc. at your games. Often, you'll have to entice your players to pitch in \nfor clean-up, especially if you brought along foodstuffs for picnicking. \nRangers can fine you if they don't like your treatment of the site, and \nmay deny you later access. \nnowing what the heck is going on. \nThe simplest solution lies in handing out identifying badg \no everyone in play. This way, everyone knows who's \"safe\" to ta \no or challenge. Make sure that your badge is something small and \nAmusement Parks \nBenefits: Surreal; lots to do \nDrawbacks: Expensive; very public; distracting \nAn unusual one-shot event might take place in an amusement \npark, such as Universal Studios. Generally, it's best to plan such an \nevent as a special one - \nmost games can't handle constant, monthly \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nplay in such an environment. On the flip side, it's a great departure from \nthe routine and a way to have everyone enjoy themselves in the game \nas well as out of play. \nAn amusement park can make for a strange, Prisoner-esque episode \nto your chronicle. Technocrats may hide out in the bowels of the park, \nor perhaps they use it as a social experiment. Maybe some supernatural \nmenace lurks in a back lot. Perhaps the sets themselves have a special \nResonance, or a strange Node is hidden somewhere on the premises. \nOf course, an amusement park is also terribly public. Such venues \noften become very crowdedvery quickly. This can be a special challenge \nto the players, who want to \"blend in\" and look like normal people. \nMake sure that everyone in your game wears some sort of identifying \nbadge. \nAlso, be wary of distraction. Your players may wander off to \nexperience the park itself. This is fine, but they should remain in \ncharacter while they're going on the rides or watching the shows. Try \nto set up regular meeting times and places (every four hours or so is \ngood) to make sure that you don't lose anybody, and so that you can run \nnecessary follow-ups to long-range challenges and Effects. \nz@@S \nAND &ImAL \nPMSERVES \nBenefits: Spacious; change of pace \nDrawbacks: Public; limited venue; may be costly \nZoos and animal preserves have some of the advantages and many \nof the disadvantages afforded to amusement and local parks. While \nthey're usually fairly large and thus offer a wide-ranging area in which \nto play, they're also public. They can be costly for entry and they risk \ndistracting players. \nThat said, a zoo or animal preserve makes for a unique change of \nvenue; few people consider using such a spot. It's a good showcase for \nProgenitor activities, or for urban Dreamspeakers andverbena. Outside \nof these boundaries, a zoo is pretty limited in its capabilities. Since you \nprobably won't have spaces to dress up as your own, you'll have to rely \non the setting itself, and that means you may have difficulty getting \nacross anything more than the location of the zoo. \nLIBRARIES \nAND I b m - ~ - ~ s  \nBenefits: Esoteric; often spacious; sometimes allow special groups \nDrawbacks: Require quiet; public; may be costly \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nStudious mages make a habit of frequenting libraries and museums \n- \nso why shouldn’t the games? The logistics of handling such venues \ncan be touchy, but also rewarding. \nWith a few Narrator characters devoted to roles of your game world \n“museum staff,” you can provide an academic experience that Hermetics, \nVirtual Adepts and similar characters will love. It’s also a great way to \nshow off some odd part of a storyline - \nsay, by stationing a Narrator with \nspecial information as a character at a particular display that matches up \nwith your current story arc. \nMuseums and libraries have all the drawbacks of other public \nlocations, of course. Identifying tags are a must. More troublingly is the \nproblem of quiet. Most museums and libraries demand silence from \ntheir patrons, so running a scene can become a chore, especially if \noverexcited players start shouting and running. It’s best to lay out \nground rules in advance: Anyone whose voice winds up carrying sits out \nof the rest of the scene. This will quickly pare down scenes to manageable \nlevels if the players can’t control themselves. \nUnless your game takes place in a very small area, you should \nays set aside a”smal1 Storyteller’s office. Have a Narrator or \nNote also that some museums have entry fees. If you schedule \nthings right, you can often get in for free on “founder’s day,” but these \ndays are also packed with visitors. \nSome libraries have back rooms that they’ll open or rent to clubs by \nspecial arrangement. Such rooms offer a good opportunity to have a \nsmall space away from everything else, if necessary, and a place where \nyou can make a little noise. \nNIGHTCLUBS \nBenefits: Atmospheric; often spacious \nDrawbacks: Semi-public; may be costly \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nThe nightclub is the venue de rigeur for the World of Darkness, and \nit seems that every game stops by one at some point or another. While \nit's not the perfect venue site, it has several advantages. \nFirst, despite being a fairly public area, most nightclubs rely upon \nanonymity; few people will give trouble to a group of gamers who're \ngoing about their own business without bugging other people. Treat it \nas a live-action attempt to uphold the Rule of Shade. \nSecond, a nightclub practically demands atmosphere. It's a great \nway to encourage your players to dress up and partake of the World of \nDarkness mood. If you pick your club carefully, you can make sure it has \na specific style and music that fit with what you want in your game. \nOf course, all of your players will have to be able to pay cover, and \nmake sure that you can all meet the dress code. Still, a punk, rave or \nGoth style club probably won't pay much attention to outlandish props \nand tchotchkes. \nIf you're fortunate enough to know the owner of a club, you might \ngain access to a back room, as well. You can use this for an off-stage \nlocation or just as a Storyteller's office. \nRESTAURANTS AND CWFW SHWS \nBenefits: Good social atmosphere; wide varieties for cultural mood \nDrawbacks: Public; may be costly \nUnlike other denizens of the World of Darkness, mages can and do \ncongregate in public places for social activities with each other and with \nnormal people. Restaurants are key among these gatherings: Sharing a \nmeal is a very sociable setting. Plus, the choice of restaurant can vastly \ninfluence the mood of the game. A Japanese steakhouse provides a \npseudo- Asiatic influence and encourages socialization around the \ntable, while a somber, Renaissance-recreation tavern won't blink an \neye at a group of gamers, and a large pub may have a whole room to \ndedicate to the troupe. \nThe key to restauranteering is, like other public venues, to be aware \nof the surrounding people. If the group has enough players and calls \nahead, most restaurants can make arrangements for a specific party \nroom. This provides a great setting not only for socializing, but also for \nTradition leaders to discuss business and for mages to ponder over clues \nor talk shop. If you're in a bar or other setting with lots of the public \naround, try to pick a specific corner or set of large tables and isolate your \ngroup, so that you don't risk accidentally shocking the folks just down \nthe way. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nDepending upon your venue, you may need to gather up a little \nextra money in advance. Sometimes players will be a little too poor for \nyour choice ofrestaurant, or someone might accidentally stiff part of the \nbill or tip. It’s usually best if the Storyteller takes on the responsibility \nfor coordinating payment, sticks it all on one tab and gathers up money \nfrom the players at check-out. \nBUSINESS WICES \nBenefits: Good Technocratic setting; practically guarantees pri- \nDrawbacks: May be hard to secure; can interfere with real-life job \nIf some of your players (or you!) work in big business, chances are \nthat your company has a building with one or more meeting rooms. \nWith the proper arrangements, many businesses may be happy to open \nthese to the employees after hours, so long as there’s no security issue. \nPlaying in meeting rooms and offices gives the game avery Technocratic \nfeel, so it’s perfect for just that sort of venue. \nvacy \nOn the down side, some managers and companies don’t quite “get” \nthe whole gaming thing. They may be less than pleased to learn that the \nafter-hours club activity is actually some sort of strange organized \ntheaterlike game. Furthermore, there’s always the risk that, if some \ndamage or theft occurs, the troupe could be blamed. You must be \nextremely careful to stress the consequences of players getting out of \nhand. \n~ A L L S  \nAND CCHTI~I-IERCIAL \nDISTRICTS \nBenefits: Spacious, with many locations \nDrawbacks: Public; limited hours \nAn unusual sort of game could take place in or near a mall, or along \na series of commercial streets. The players have the opportunity to \nspread out among the many stores, restaurants and plazas. Meetings are \neasily disguised in the back of a cafe or at the edge of a plaza as just a \nbunch of friends chatting. As long as players avoid running, shouting \nand making a mess in public, they can even play out having subtle \nmagical duels! Just be careful with players who go overboard: Mall \nsecurity can be frighteningly quick to crack down on potential threats; \nnone of the stores wants to have their customers scared away. \nMost malls have limited hours of operation, so you need to plan \nyour venue appropriately. If you live in a large college town or downtown \nin a city, you may have access to stores and restaurants that stay open \nlate. In more rustic settings, only daytime will suffice. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n. -  \nRemember to use identity tags, so that players don’t accost random \nshoppers. It’s also recommended that you set up a Storyteller’s office in \nsome easy-to-meet location, so that you can have players meet with you \nevery two hours or so in case you need to make announcements, \nchanges or scene rulings. \nAll of the usual caveats for sub-types of places in malls - \nstores and \nrestaurants - \napply, as well. \nPRIVATE RESIDENCES \nBenefits: Privacy \nDrawbacks: Few players willing to provide \nGaming inside of a private home is, of course, the recommended \nvenue. In a private residence, you can set up all the decorations, special \nscenes and unusual costuming that the host allows. Your players can be \nas boisterous and as deeply into their roles as desired, as long as you don’t \ndisturb the neighbors. Such gatherings often look to the neighbors like \njust another evening party, too, so you can get away with a lot, especially \nif you keep the really odd props, costumes and sets indoors. \nFew people, however, will open their homes willingly and repeatedly \nto game nights. Large LARPs can cause a lot of mess, and some less- \nthan-reputable sorts use this as an excuse to get a little light-fingered. \nOne bad incident can turn a host off - \nand perhaps cause the host and \nfriends to leave the game, too. \nAlways make sure to close off any “off limits” rooms and denote \nthem clearly with a sign. \nHQTELS \nBenefits: Private and meeting rooms available \nDrawbacks: Expensive \nLarge-scale, convention-style games generally rake advantage of \nhotels. A hotel is, essentially, a private residence that you just use for \na few days. Within the individual players’ rooms, anything goes, so long \nas it doesn’t violate the hotel’s rules: This makes it perfect for splitting \nup characters to meet by Tradition or cabal. At the same time, you can \nusually rent out a party or meeting room for your formal game site itself. \nIf the Storyteller has a suite, the outer room can also serve as a special \nlocation for the game. This allows a wide variety of settings for play. \nMost hotels include a restaurant and are within driving distance of just \nUnfortunately, hotelling is expensive. Unless your troupe has very \ndeep pockets, chances are you won’t be able to afford a hotel regularly. \n’ ’ \n‘ *  \nabout all of the other settings described here, too. \n;” \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nCHURCHES \nBenefits: Very atmospheric; spacious \nDrawbacks: Generally hostile to LARPs \nA group with strong ties to a real-world church might be able to gain \naccess to the church facilities as a club organization. Doing so outside \nof normal church hours can sometimes even guarantee a private set of \nrooms for use. This is in addition to the fact that many churches just bok \ntoo cool, and thus provide a great setting for Mage games. \nUnfortunately, roleplaying games have had a bad reputation with \ncertain religious elements. While some pastors may be more tolerant \nthan others, this is definitely a case of \"find out beforehand.\" Never, \never try to sneak a LARP into a church without all parties knowing \nwhat's involved. There's too much risk of alienating the community. \nBenefits: Often have a good World of Darkness feel; spacious \nDrawbacks: May be hazardous; hard to arrange \nLarge industrial corporations use industrial parks and lots - \nfactories, steel mills and junkyards. Such locations often have a barren, \ntechnological look to them, which plays into the World of Darkness \nperfectly. Plus, they often have a great deal of space available, from \ngravel yards to abandoned factories. \nAcquiring the right to use such space can be difficult, though. \nWithout proper connections to the owning company, using such space \nis generally considered trespassing. More importantly, old steel mills \nand factories often have very hazardous areas around them. A group that \ndoes manage to secure a site is best served by doing their gaming only \nin the outdoor gravel lots and small management sheds; don't risk losing \nplayers inside the bowels of some factory. \nBenefits: Wide range of scenery \nDrawbacks: Very difficult to coordinate \nOne experimental form of venue is the traveling venue. In this form \nof play, your troupe splits up with Narrators, each of whom stays in touch \nby radio or cell phone. Each piece of the game is free to travel where it will. \nYou can delineate specific areas and give them World of Darkness \nequivalents. This lets your players move from place to place with actual \ntravel time taken into account, and lets you play up the separation \nbetween groups when they move out for different tasks. \nINDUSTIUAL PARKS \nTRAVELING \nVENUE \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nUnfortunately, this is extremely difficult to coordinate. Every \ngroup needs a Narrator with it. Every Narrator needs a way to \ncommunicate with the central Storyteller regularly and consistently. \nYou may find a need to suddenly pull people back together, such as \nwhen someone Correspondence steps to a friend; this can be hard to do \nwhen they’re 20 minutes apart in the real world. \nTraveling venues are best done as an experimental one-shot until \nyou get the hang of them. \nDK~RATING \nYWRVENUE \nOnce you’ve settled on a venue location, it’s also up to you to make \nsure it fits the game style you’re trying to promote. A little decoration \ngoes a long way; the World of Darkness subsists on mood, not just on \nbuildings. \nYour first and most important task is, of course, to figure out just \nhow far you plan to go. Perhaps you don’t have enough money to \ncompletely redecorate your house, or maybe you don’t have the time or \ninclination to put up huge Styrofoam plinths and flashing techno- \ngadgetry. That’s fine - \nalthough, of course, the more you immerse your \nplayers in the game, the more they’ll probably enjoy it. \nThe immersion factor of your site can’t be overestimated. The more \nyour site pushes players into the spirit of things, the more they’re likely \nto remain in character. It’s much, much easier to keep a sense of \ncharacter when the world actually feels and looks like the world the \ncharacter’s supposed to be in. A site that doesn’t fire the imagination \nrisks players feeling out of place or bored, which leads to out-of-play \nchatter. \nObviously, if you’re using a public site, you have strict limitations \non what you can and can’t do. Private sites fare a little better, especially \nif you have a few hours of prep time. \nm @ @ D  mUSIC \nSome venues like to use music to help set the feel of a specific \nlocation. This is good so long as it’s not overdone. One of the biggest \nproblems of the nightclub-format venue is that players often can’t even \nhear one another over the music. Music shouldn’t be intrusive; it should \nbe an audio cue that helps to set mood. \nYou’ll probably want to avoid music with lyrics. Stick with pure \ninstrumentals, otherwise conversations wind up fighting over the words \nof the music. Your choice of music has a strong effect on the environment, \nand can make it discordant, eerie or pleasant. Remember that music \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ndoesn't always have to be soft tones and slow melodies. You can use \ninstrumental rock, trance, grunge or techno to provide a more fast- \npaced, tension-filled atmosphere. Conversely, a Technocratic base \nmight have elevator music designed to set visitors at ease (and make \ntheir minds open to manipulation). Strong classical music is almost \nalways in vogue, unless you're talking about a game purely dominated \nby modem computer junkies and techno-wizards. \nRemember, the players don't necessarily have to easily hear all of \nthe music. If some of it drops off and isn't quite audible, that's all right. \nThe music is an accompaniment; it's not supposed to intrude. \nLIGHTING \nMost of the time, your site will have strong overhead white lighting \nor sunlight. This is fine for a typical game, but specific settings might \ncall for something different. \nA good way to generate a more \"spooky\" atmosphere (such as an old \nChantry) is to diffuse your light. Remove the bulbs from overhead \nlighting, and instead rely on lamps scattered about the room in various \ncomers. If a room has white walls, try draping fabrics; this cuts down on \nthe reflection and makes the light softer. Such diffusion gives more \nshadows, more areas of overlap and less of a sunlit atmosphere. It's a bit \nmore cloistered and claustrophobic. \nColored lighting's a neat trick, but be careful not to rely on it \nexclusively. For one thing, it's annoying when it makes reading difficult \nor a costume impossible to see. Blue or violet lights can make for a soft, \nnightlike atmosphere, but they also render dark print hard to read, \nwhich can hurt the ability to use character sheets, books and references. \nDark red lights work a little better, and they create a more menacing \ntone. Yellow lighting seems more naturalistic and works well for scenes \nin the Middle Umbra. Green lights offer some of the same problems as \nblue, but also tend to project an oceanlike or unwholesome pallor, and \nmake people look unhealthy; they're perfect for blighted places or nasty \nparts of the Umbra. \nSpecific lighting, instead of just general room lighting, can also \nmake a difference. Perhaps your high muckety-muck Hermetic mage \nhas a small lamp stand next to his chair where he keeps a dim red lamp. \nThis will cause the mage to seem sinister and out-of-place with respect \nto the rest of the room. Technocrats may have light strips around \nspecific doors or on walls, indicating hazards or directions. \nPlayers can carry light, too - \nyou can cheaply buy glowsticks at \nhardware stores and use them to represent magical light. A procession \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nof mages at night, all holding different colored glowsticks, can make for \nan eerie sight. With a little work you can also place a glowstick inside \nof a prop, making for a simple torch or lantern without the hazards of \nusing real fire. \nAR@mAs \nFew games pay attention to scent, but it's a powerful memory \ntrigger. Scents cause memories of similar situations to come to the fore, \nand thus can create a vivid sense of connection between a game scene \nand real events. \nUsually your site will have a neutral scent: Lived-in, visited, not \nparticularly scented. Clever use of aromas and incense can change this. \nIf you want to get across the idea of a Technocratic area, try \ncleaning tile floors just beforehand and spraying disinfectant about. \nThese sharp smells will remind people of sterile, universitylike \nenvironments. For a hospitallike feel, put some rubbing alcohol near \nthe doors and air vents; anywhere that there's air motion will cause the \nalcohol to evaporate, bringing its smell to the players who pass by. \nTradition areas tend to have other strong scents. You want to avoid \nanything that will cause nausea or problems for players and visitors, of \ncourse, so using various items that Tradition mages count as foci - \nlike \nblood, dung or ash - \nis right out. The scents from those can overwhelm \nyour players and cause the game to suddenly become a little too strong \nfor comfort. Instead, try safer smells that bring up Tradition images. \nIncense is, of course, the first one to spring to mind, but it's not the only \npossibility. Different types of incense might represent different \nTraditions. A lodge or living room can benefit from the use of a \nfireplace, which generates a musty, wooden smell; this has connotations \nof comfort and home. Restaurants tend to have the sharp smell of \nmustard and spices, which bring out a kitchen atmosphere and heighten \nthe appetite. Some bookstores also sell aromas, and you can use \nperfumes to give a place a masculine scent or a smell like fresh rain. Even \nscented air fresheners can affect your environment. \nAs with music, scent shouldn't be overwhelming. Just a little bit is \nenough to trigger memories. \n%BD \nAND l%EFMSHiTIENTS \nAside from making sure that your site has access to bathroom \nfacilities (since most games last for several hours), you might consider \nbringing foodstuffs as well. Mages eat just like anyone else, after all! \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nJust like other facets of your venue, your choice of foods influences \nthe appearance of the game. Neatly arranged sushi and rice dishes \nclearly tell the players “Akashic Brotherhood,” while barbecue and \nchips set the tone for more of a modern American trailer cook-out. An \nafternoon gathering with light snacks doesn’t feel as serious as a full \ndinner or potluck. \nSimilarly, you can offer incentives for the players to bring foods \naccording to their Tradition cultures. While not everyone’s a good \ncook, a few people will probably rise to the challenge, and you can \nalways let someone bring a salad or simple dish from the supermarket’s \ndeli counter. The “taste of a Tradition” helps players to feel more in \ncharacter as they indulge in the character’s specific culture - \nor find \nit alien in spite of their Tradition training. \nWhat you serve has a strong effect on what you say about the game’s \nlocation, too. If you serve only coffee, you establish a more office-like \natmosphere. Fruit juices give a picnic feeling, while sodas are more in \nline with a restaurant or home location. If you have heavy, elaborate \nmeals, you generate more of a sense of permanence - \nthe location \nseems to be more like a house or store, some place where one would find \nsuch foods; having only light snacks enforces that the characters are on \nthe run or highly mobile. \nSIGNS \nAND PICTURES \nSometimes you can’t be bothered to build a replica of Stonehenge \nin your back yard. That’s OK -your players can imagine that they use \nmagic; they can imagine the location as well. \nSigns and pictures are a good compromise. Generally, having a \nvisual is better than just having a description. For the aforementioned \nStonehenge, you might copy a picture of the circle of stones onto apiece \nof paper, and label it ‘Standing Stones” underneath. Stick the picture \non the end of a wooden post, and place a post for each stone - \nvoila, \nyou give your players a good approximation of the site, the locations of \nthe stones and the appearance. \nSigns help indoors, too; having access to computer-printed signs \ngreatly improves the look of your site. A Technocratic door with a \nlaminated “No Entry” sign and a biohazard symbol is far more menacing \nthan a 3” x 5” card with the same words hand-scrawled in pencil, and \nit’s only slightly more effort to make. \nYou can tie a sign in with scent, too. Just apply the appropriate scent \nto your sign. Then, when your players interact with it, they get a sense \nof the location from more than just a picture. For instance, instead of \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ndigging a grave in your backyard, you might put down a small cardboard \ncut-out in the shape of a headstone with a picture, and anoint it with \nan aroma like that of moist loam. Players who examine this will not only \nquickly realize that it’s an open grave (from the picture and description), \nbut will smell from the sign the cues that come with the site. \nU~BRAL \nLKATI~NS \nAs mages grow more experienced with Spirit magic and with the \nhistories of their Traditions, an eventual push into the Umbra is nigh- \ninevitable. Umbral Realms offer chances to play in just about any \nimaginable type of site. Also, in the Umbra, mages can quest to find \nmentors or information long since lost to the real world. With the \nUmbra’s lesser restrictions on magic, it’s also a very tempting place for \nmages to do a lot of their work. \nKEEPING \nTHE U ~ B R A  \nIN CHKK \nIn spite of its obvious advantages, the Umbra isn’t a place for mages \nto stay forever. Many a mage would retreat to the Umbra for all business \nif it were possible. After all, magic’s more powerful and Paradox less \nthreatening there! So what keeps mages in the real world? Several \nthings: \nNormal Sleepers can’t survive unaided in the Umbra. While it’s \npossible to bring people there, and some Realms are self-sustaining \necologies, it’s a very dangerous place. Marauding spirits, enemy mages \nand collapsing realities can all threaten Sleepers, who have no special \ndefenses in the Umbra. Is your mage really going to take his family \nsomewhere that a random, wandering Umbrood might eat them all? \nIt’s hard to affect the material world from the Umbra. Mages must \nexert their powers across the Storm and into the realms of Unbelief to \nsend magic from the Umbra to the physical world. In most cases, it’s \neasier just to do the magic on Earth. \nThe Umbra has less impact on the consensus. Mages know that \nthe Umbra reflects the real world, so if all the Traditions flee to the \nUmbra and the Technocracy completely takes over the Earth, the \nUmbra will soon follow. To make meaningful changes, magesmust fight \nfor belief on earthly battlegrounds. \nThe Umbra is downright dangerous! Spirits, demons and other \nmalefic entities roam free in the Umbra without the threat of Unbelief \nto limit their powers. Many of these creatures are far more powerful than \nany mortal mage will ever be. This isn’t even counting the environmental \nhazards of places that are hostile to human life: Realms of fire, protean \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nplaces where the laws of reality shift at whim, primordial forests full of \nterrible dinosaurlike creatures and cannibals with barbed spears - \nat \nleast the material world is a bit more predictable. Sure, you can always \nrun into a mugger or get hit by a bus. In the Umbra, though, there are \nthousands more ways to die. \nStorytellers should be sure to play up some of these inconveniences \nof the Umbra from time to time, just to keep mages on their toes. The \nUmbra is not a safe haven, nor is it a place to effectively do battle for \nwars on Earth, nor is it an easy trip. Nevertheless, it’s a useful stopping \nground for mages willing to brave its dangers. Like most magical \nendeavors, the mage risks much for the opportunity to gain much. \nYour key point should be this: Mages don’t just jump into the \nUmbra for a quick jaunt. Umbral travel is an important, powerful \njourney, requiring preparation and forethought. While a fast vulgar \neffect might suffice to slip through in some occasions, most Umbral \ntravel relies on ceremony. Consider the hero striding down a long \nstairway in a damp cave as he closes in on the Underworld, or laying out \na circle of stones in the deep woods to open the path to the Penumbra. \nSuch travels should always have a sense of mystery and duty to them. \nlf your game assumes the existence of the Avatar Storm - \nwhich \ndoesn’t always have to be the case - \nyou’ve probably already run into \narguments about when to use it and when not to use it. In simplest \nterms, the Storm causes injury to mages because shards of Quintessential \npower are drawn to the strength of the Avatar, and these shards flense \nthe mage’s Avatar, spirit and body. Thus, the Storm causes damage \nwhen the mage passes the Gauntlet, and it distorts magical Effects that \npenetrate the Gauntlet. \nA mage who simply projects his mind through other realms (with \nMaster-level Mind) never actually takes his spirit or body through the \nGauntlet, so he’s safe from the Storm. \nStepping into or out of the Umbra triggers the Storm’s effect once, \nas the mage crosses the Gauntlet. Once inside, the mage has crossed the \nStorm and is safe (at least, as safe as someone can be, in the Umbra). \nEffects cast from the Umbra to Earth or vice versa generally don’t \nhurt the caster, but they do damage the Effect. Such Effects become \n“Storm-tainted” and have a tendency to degrade. Ingeneral, a Storyteller \ncan require anywhere from one to five extra grades of success for the \nEffect to penetrate at all, and these grades are stripped from the Effect, \nlowering its duration and potency. Furthermore, Effects often warp in \nWHEN \nTCB Use THE STCBIUI-I \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nsome strange way. If you're not sure how to warp the Effect, you might \ntry drawing a card from a prepared Paradox deck and generating a suit- \nbased phenomenon (see p. XX). \nIt's possible to cross into the Umbra at a Shallowing, a site where \nthe Gauntlet drops between worlds. No Gauntlet, no Avatar Storm. \nAnyone can cross there, even Sleepers and spirits. Unfortunately, \nmages tend to fight hotly over Shallowings as a result of this, and they're \ndangerous places because you never know what will come through. \nReaching across the Gauntlet to thwack a spirit or pick something \nup does cause Storm damage. Just peeking across usually doesn't, \nalthough there may be exceptions. \nIt's sometimes possible to find a \"backdoor\" through which a mage \ncan reach the Umbra; for instance, a mage might slip into a Demense \n(p. XX) while asleep, then walk from dreams to the Umbral Dream- \nRealm and thence to the Umbra itself. This does bypass the Gauntlet, \nbut it's a hazardous journey at best. \nYou may find it easiest to set down a checklist of things that might \ntrigger Gauntlet crossing and Storm damage, and then figure it out for \nyour own game. For instance, in your game you might decide that \nfloating around as a disembodied consciousness with Mind still draws \nStorm damage, but that mages can project their senses across with \nCorrespondence and Spirit without risk, or you might even decree that for \nsome reason the Digital Web is isolated from Storm effects (which will \nturn it into a popular jumping-off ground). \nAs noted in Laws of Ascension, the Penumbra reflects all of the \nphysical world. It is, in a sense, a mirror image of the real world, but \nviewed in a lake that sometimes has ripples, distortions or images from \nthe past. \nPenumbral travel is pretty simple, and it's probably the least risky \narea of the Umbra. With but a step in all but the most Gauntlet-heavy \nareas, the mage can travel back to reality. Since the Penumbra contains \nreflections of the real world, you don't even need to make special sets \nand locations for it. Simply have your players indicate Umbral travel by \nplacing one hand, palm facing down, against the chest. \nThe Penumbra offers useful clues and travel opportunities. Since it \nreflects places in the material world as their Resonance shows, you can \nuse the Penumbra to give hints about the real issues with a site. If a \nbuilding has twisted cables that spark with energy and drip with slime, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nfor instance, this is aclear indication that even if the place looksnormal \nin the real world, something is terribly wrong with it. By the same token, \na Node isn’t necessarily immediately visible, but the area of the Umbra \nnear it will probably seem vibrant and full of energy, which is a good \nindicator if the characters have lots of Cosmology or Node Lore. \nIf you want to have a highly spiritual game, you can try adding props \nand scenery to show off parts of the Umbra. Give them a prominent \npurple tag or handkerchief to indicate that they’re in the Velvet \nShadow. That way, players can ignore them until they use Spirit sight \nor travel. Of course, you probably don’t want to set out too many \nimportant clues this way - \notherwise some players might be tempted \nto metagame.. . . \nThe Penumbra has one other important function as far as mages are \nconcerned: It offers pathways to other parts of the Umbra. By following \nthe Penumbra through the heart of a city and down a paved road \nsurrounded by skyscrapers, for instance, a mage can reach the realm of \nDystopia. Similarly, sticking to the deepest shadows and losing the trail \nto blindly walk in places of decay may lead to the Chasm. For a mage \nwithout a guide, this is the only way to really find other Realms. Mages \n(and Sleeper visitors!) can become lost in the Umbra, though; not all \npaths are marked, and sometimes walking into a place doesn’t also mean \neasily walking back out. \nNote especially that the Technocracy tends to use Dimensional \nScience to protect its installations. Not only is the Gauntlet \npreternaturally high in such areas, but a few field generators can easily \nerect shielding that prevents mages from simply “walking” through \nbuilding security into a heavily fortified installation and then dropping \noff bombs across the Gauntlet. \nTHE ASTRAL \nUIIIBRA: \nIDEAS \nUnlike other areas of the Umbra, most astral travelers don’t rely \nheavily on Spirit magic; rather, they are travelers of the Mind. \nThe Astral Umbra represents abstraction and ideas. You don’t even \nnecessarily have to have a room to use it; players can be placed in a \nconvenient quiet comer and run the scene all through narration. After \nall, the Astral Umbra is all in the head. \nIf you want to make a place that has an Astral Umbra impression, \ntry using a small, white room. Remove as much furnishing as you can, \nexcept for a single spartan item. Go for the feel of the surreal rooms \ninside Dave Bowman’s mind at the end of 2001 : A Space Odyssey. Items \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nor creatures suddenly appear in response to the mage’s thoughts, but \nthey are only ephemeral things, without true substance. They are the \npatterns from which things form. With magic a mage can give them \nsubstance, but things with substance do not belong in the Astral Umbra \nand “fall” out to somewhere else (usually the Penumbra). \nThe Astral Umbra is a place for confronting ideas. A mage can run \ninto an idea given form here (try dressing someone up in plain white to \npersonalize an idea). Other travelers of the mind sometimes meet, and \ntime occasionally flows strangely here; it’s a place to swap ideas of \nhistory as well as thoughts of the future. \nSome other supernatural creatures sometimes frequent the Astral \nUmbra. In this place, combat doesn’t take place physically. Attacks \ngenerally rely on Mental Challenges, with the loser suffering Willpower \nTrait loss. A character who runs out of Willpower finds himself ejected \nfrom the Astral Umbra. \nIn places where the Astral Umbra intersects with the Penumbra, \nAstral space has some level of “reality” to it, but visitors who concentrate \non the thoughts of the place quickly move up into the realm of \nabstraction. Eventually it’s like a Zen riddle: Nothing but emptiness \nwrapped in ideas. Fortunately, leaving the Astral Umbra isn’t difficult; \nthe traveler simply needs to let his mind lose hold of the ephemeral and \nsink back into the material - \na sort of metaphysical slow descent back \nto the Penumbra. \nTHE \nDARK UII-IBRA: \nGH~STS \nThe Dark Umbra is a hostile place to mages. As noted in the \ncrossover rule guides on p. XX, mages who visit find their powers \nweakened, and those who die here have no recourse. \nThe Dark Umbra comprises two separate but coexistent layers: The \nShadowlands and the Tempest. \nThe Shadowlands are a sort of “negative Penumbra.” Take all the \nvibrancy of the Penumbra, the building up of things spiritual and the \nemotional outpouring that affects its structure. Now, send it through a \nnegative filter, like a piece of film. That’s the Dark Umbra: A reflection \nof the physical world, but one tattered, sullied, decayed and overcome \nwith despair. Travelers in the Shadowlands find that landscapes are \nbleak and crumbling, everything’s falling down. Negative emotions are \namplified, and places of brightness and hope seem washed out. Some \nmages do use the Shadowlands for quick jaunts, but this is risky. Since \nthe Shadowlands sucks away energy, a mage who isn’t careful can find \nhimself trapped if he can’t perform a ritual strong enough to step back \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nI \ninto the physical world. And, of course, ghosts lurk here, and they often \nresent the living. \nMetaphysically “below” the Shadowlands is the Tempest, a \nrampaging storm of primal matter. If the Penumbra is dynamic energy \nand growth reflected from reality and the Shadowlands are decay, the \nTempest is the storm of raw primordialism from which all things sprang \nand to which they will all one night sink again. The Tempest itself \ngenerally seems like a strange plain of congealed soil and viscera, beaten \nby an ever-blowing wind that propels dust, grit, bits of flesh and chunks \nof forgotten detritus. Somewhere in the Tempest is a dark sea that seems \nto be the beginning and ending of all the land of the Tempest itself. \nUnderneath the “soil,” tunnels and caverns crisscross, entering caves \nwith sleeping monstrosities. In a few rare places, pockets of the storm \nsubside, and in these sanctuaries ghosts raise citadels and sanctuaries. \nThe Tempest is a nightmare for mages -very little other than powerful \nForces and Entropy magic can shield against its energies, and the \nnightmare winds send flaying shards that will rip body and spirit apart. \nThings lurk out there, too: Not only ghosts, but plasmic creatures \nspawned from the not-quite-nothingness left over from the effluvia of \nCreation, and twisted memories of creatures and places that never were. \nAs these things have no hold on “reality,” a mage cannot even rely on \ntaking them across the Gauntlet to study; they are, in a sense, closer to \nthe nothingness from which the cosmos originally came - \nand they all \nsee intruding life as a cancer that must be cut out forever. \nMoving between Shadowlands and Tempest isn’t too difficult for \nghosts, who do so as a matter of course. For mages it’s a matter of \nfollowing paths, just as one might follow a Penumbral path to a Realm. \nThe mage can follow sinkholes and places where reality seems to crack \nat the seams, often by dropping into pits, cracks in the ground or \ndecaying streets. Coming back up from the Tempest is much harder: \nThe Byways between safe citadels are not always consistent, and the \nmage may have to use Spirit magic just to pull himself back ‘(up.” Once \nsomething falls toward the heart of Oblivion, the pull of utter vacuum \nis loath to give it up. \nMages might visit the Darkumbra to gain information from ghosts, \nor in search of memories, or reflections of things destroyed. It’s said that \nsomewhere in the Tempest one can find anything that ever died or was \nbroken. That’s a powerful incentive for a seeker of lost knowledge. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nRwns: GTHER \nWau~s \nAs a mage moves beyond the reflections of earthly reality, the \nUmbra takes on other, stranger shapes. At the Horizon, the boundary \nof imagination, it forms Realms, or places where specific images of \nreality hold sway. These Realms sometimes look like bits out of the real \nworld, and other times are places that defy imagining. Some mages \nargue that Realms may have once been part of the world, but the \nConsensus ejected them to the Umbra when they were believed \n“unreal” by too much of humanity. Other mages argue that Realms are \nsimply parts of the Umbra that respond to deeply imbedded urges and \ndreams of humanity. \nRealms offer you a very exciting level of flexibility with Mage play. \nSince Realms can mimic just about any place you could imagine, you \ncan take yourMage characters into awelter ofdifferent settings-near- \nfuture dystopia, sci-fi, fantasy, savage exploration, nihilistic tribalism or \nanything else you can imagine. Depending upon what your players want \nto do with their characters, you might make such trips a one-time deal \nfor a little flavor, or a large part of the chronicle. You could even have \nyour game set mostly in the Umbra or half-and-half split between \nRealms and reality. \nVery powerful mages can actually create their own Realms, but \ndoing so typically requires access to a Node. The Quintessence flow of \nthe Node is moderated by the mage and sent into the Umbra; the mage \nuses his power to direct it into creation of a new place. Out on the \nHorizon, where the Umbra reflects space, the emptiness can be tumed \ninto anything a mage can dream of. In the past, Chantries would form \nUmbral Realms specifically for their members, using the power of their \nhosting Nodes. Unfortunately, the dearth of skilled mages in the \nmodem age, combined with the difficulty of sustaining a Node’s power \nacross the ever-strengthening Gauntlet, makes it harder and harder to \nkeep up a Horizon Realm now. \nRealms can range from tiny to near-infinite. A mage with a yen for \nprivacy and a small Node might shape a tiny, one-room Realm on the \nHorizon, a place where he can shut himself away from outsiders and \ncloak it with all manner of spells to avoid detection and entry (probably \nusing Comespondence and Spirit). Legendary Realms of the past were said \nto house entire planets of their own; mages could visit whole worlds- \nthat-might-have-been. \nOf course, some Realms seem to sustain themselves. These highly \nprized places are stable within the Umbra; mages can make use of them \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nat whim. Unfortunately, their rules are their own - \na mage can’t step \ninto a pocket Realm and simply reshape it as desired, but must rather \naccept its version of reality. That’s why so many mages prefer to make \ntheir own Realms; sculpting a Realm allows the mage to make up its \nrules. \n%4RD AND sHA14E &ALlTIS \nMost Tradition mages know about the Shard Realms: Umbral \nreflections of the planets that correspond to specific Spheres. Each \nplanetary body has a Sphere attuned to it, according to magely lore. \nArguments still rage about whether this indicates some underlying \ncosmological truth to the system of Spheres, or whether the widespread \nacceptance of the Spheres caused their projection onto the Shard \nRealms. \nMages visit the Shard Realms to gain specific understanding of a \ngiven Sphere. A mage who wants to learn more about the nature of \nTime, for instance, can visit the Shard Realm of Time. There, the laws \nof the Sphere become manifest. In strange ways, the Sphere’s power \ncomes to the fore and becomes visible to visitors. \nA Shade Realm, by constrast, is an Umbral reflection of the cosmos, \nas cast through the lens of a given Sphere. The Shade Realm of Life, for \ninstance, is an entire universe filled with life and living things, with \nonly tiny places here and there containing Forces or Matter. These \nRealms also offer insights into their Spheres, but are very dangerous to \nvisit. Magical protections are a necessity so that the traveler can \nbreathe, survive the forces at work and even comprehend the altered \ncosmology. \nWhen you set out to use a Shard Realm in play, you should prepare \na special setting in advance. Shard Realms have very strange \ncharacteristics that definitely set them apart from normal Earth. \nTherefore, you should take pains to dress up a room or outdoor garden \nspecifically in the way the Shard Realm would look. If possible, try your \nbest to use lighting and scent to increase its exotic appeal (see previous \nnotes on those). You can use strobing, crashing red-and-yellow lights \nfor the Realm of Forces, for instance, or softly pulsing yellow lights for \nLife. Always make sure that the surroundings play up the fact that it’s \nan alien place. \nSol: The sun is the “Shard Realm Infinite,” the beginning and \nending of magical power. No portals or paths lead to it now; travel is \nseemingly impossible. \n“: \n-.-. \n” \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nas the people from Earth? \nYes, if you want them to be. \nEarth that humanity decided to live in. This doesn't make th \ncomponents less \"real,\" though. A sword taken from Concordia \nrth is still a sword, and still functions and has solid mass (as lo \notherwise be a normal person. \nYou can even allow people to play characters who come fro \nthese other Realms. The benefits and drawbacks of doing so shou \ne Renaissance-era sensibilities and technical know-how, as pe \nt may suffer from Agoraphobia. \nMercury: The Shard Realm Correspondence. Travel to and from \nthis Shard Realm is difficult at best, because it seems to occupy a level \nof Correspondence understanding that surpasses the way Correspondence \nworks in conventional three-dimensional space. The Shard Realm is a \nplace where distance and direction are nearly meaningless; navigation \nis impossible to anyone without Correspondence knowledge and difficult \neven to those mages. \nVenus: The Shard Realm Life. In the Umbral reflection of Venus, \nthe planet is a verdant, hot jungle. Mages sometimes visit to explore its \nreaches for special herbs or spores, but it's also the home to spiritual \npredators of great size and danger. Below its surface are tunnels filled \nwith all manner of crawling things. The dusty layer of the planet is \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nactually an organic soup. Travelers risk disease and parasitic infection \nif they do not have Life magic protection. \nMars: The Shard Realm Forces. The most famous Chantry of \nTradition history, Doissetep, once resided here. The Umbral reflection \nof Mars is a barren land tom with lightning, earthquakes and roiling \nskies. The temperature reflects reality: Burning during the day, freezing \nat night. Here all extremes of forces come to bear. Some evidence \nindicates the presence of Bygones on the Shard Realm, although none \ncan say with certainty if these were simply things that passed to the \nUmbra from Unbelief, or creatures that actually thrived on Mars before \nhumanity. \nJupiter: The Shard Realm Matter. As a tremendous body of swirling \nmatter in the physical world, Jupiter casts an Umbral reflection of a \nhuge place of caverns, rocks, magma and metal. Due to its sheer size, a \ngreat variety of possibilities emerge. Mages sometimes visit this Shard \nRealm specifically to look for rare elements or unusual compounds for \nmagical research. \nSaturn: The Shard Realm Time. Saturn's Shard Realm may be the \nmost cryptic of all. It seems a place devoid of spatial dimension; rather, \ntravelers in it find themselves altering their relationship to the time- \nstream, causing passage of time for themselves or changing when they \ncome back. For this Shard Realm, you may simply want to use a very \nsmall room with blacklighting and violet wall hangings - it's so \nesoteric that even mages have trouble navigating it. Saturn's Shard \nRealm is a place where desperate mages go either to study Time Mastery \nor to hope to be catapulted into another era. Nobody yet knows how to \ncontrol the flow of Time here to successfully predict the exit point. \nUranus: The Shard Realm Spirit. Essentially, this Realm is a large \n\"reflection of a reflection.\" Here, spiritual power is unfettered by any ties \nto the material world. Binding spirits is difficult, and all Resonance is \npronounced. Emotional states flare up in auras, and a person's spiritual \nnature becomes visible in a halo or aura. You might choose to double the \neffects of all Resonance in this Realm. More eerily, if you have a bunch \nof colored glowsticks on hand, try passing them out to the players with \ncolors that seem to match their personalities - \nred for hot-tempered, \nblue for serene, green for sullen and so on. In the Shade Realm of Spirit, \nall spirits become untethered: Spirits are no longer trapped in fetishes and \nthe Avatars of mages accompany them side-by-side. Each spirit keeps a \nthin cord that binds it to its housing, but this can easily be broken - \nand \nthings can be ejected, spiritless, from the Shade Realm. \nI \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nNeptune: The Shard Realm Mind. Much like the Astral Umbra, \nthis is a place of thoughts. Mental states come to the fore, but unlike the \nShard Realm Spirit, they don’t simply appear in halos - \nthey can \nactually cause subtle changes in the environment. In the Shade Realm, \nthis is even more pronounced, and mental states can dramatically shift \nthe landscape. Some mages consider the Shade Realm to be essentially \na tabularasa that forms an entire mindscape around every visitor. Other \nmages theorize that the Shade Realm of Mind is, itself, a tremendous \nconsciousness - \nperhaps the universal unconscious. \nPluto: The Shard Realm Entropy. At the edge of the solar system \nlies the tiny world devoid of light and heat, where all things freeze and \ncrumble. In its Shard Realm, the Euthanatos have one of the few \nremaining powerful Umbral Chantries (placed on the Umbral reflection \nof Cerberus, a moon of Pluto). The archmaster Senex continues to \nteach the power of Entropy as students survive inside the walls of a place \nwhere, just beyond the protective barrier, the world is devoid of light, \nheat or anything but slowly cracking ice, crumbling dust and energy- \nsapping vacuum. The Shade Realm of En~opy is even more of an \nenigma; old journals describe it as a place of utter darkness that makes \nthe Shadowlands look well-lit by comparison, where nothing has form \nor structure. \nSPACE AND THE DI~ENSI~NA: \nBARRIER \n$ 4  \n1:s \na i  4I \nSome mages mistakenly believe that, beyond a certain point, outer \nspace becomes the Umbra. This isn’t quite true, although it’s close. Past \nthe asteroid belt, the Gauntlet becomes staggeringly low; it’s very easy \nto cross between “our” space and the other dimensions at that point. \nStill, the Umbra remains separate - \nthat’s why mundane astronomers \non Earth don’t see giant ruined castles on Mars; Doissetep existed in the \nUmbral reflection of the planet. \nSons of Ether, Void Engineers and the occasional travel-minded \nVirtual Adept do make jaunts out into space itself. As the Gauntlet \nthins (to about a 2), it becomes possible to very easily slip into other \nRealms. Tradition mages attribute this to space remaining largely \n_- unmapped and unknown and thus analogous to areas of the Umbra; the \nVoid Engineers simply claim that outer space is free from the distortion \nshadows cast by Earth-bound technological signatures and therefore \nopen field for warp effects and dimensional travel. \nGames taking place in outer space have their work cut out for them. \nI, \n\\ : \n; - P I ‘  . \n7 ,  \nUnless you’re in the movie business, you’ll have to fake a whole lot - \nor set all of your action on the inside of a station or ship, such as the \nL I ,  - \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nTechnocracy’s recent Mars base, Ares City. Remember that space \nexpeditions are still very much like early submarine excursions: Quarters \nare cramped, regulations are strict, and one false move could kill \neveryone! Players should always have the overwhelming sense that \nthey’re way out of their element, in a hostile environment that’s waiting \nto kill them. \nYou probably don’t need specific rules for explosive decompression \nand such. Suffice to say that an unprotected mage in space suffers just \nlike anyone else. Sure, a magical Effect can turn the void into breathable, \nhabitable ether, but the mage had best be quick about it. \nAssume, if you must, that characters unprotected in space take two \nlevels of aggravated damage automatically each turn, due to pressure \nchange, radiation and the boiling/ freezing of bodily fluids and tissues. \nOf course, the Shard Realms aren’t the only places out there. Nor \nare the reflections of the Umbra. As noted before, many places exist \nthat predate magely intervention - \nand that exist without mages’ \ninput. \nThe trick lies in keeping the Umbra mysterious and unknowable. \nWhile the descriptions here provide some leeway for playing in various \nRealms, there should never be a ”complete catalog to the Umbra” or an \neasy map. New places form; old places change. No mortal will ever fully \ncomprehend the depths of the Umbra. Some mages might become \nfamiliar enough with a given Realm or two to feel comfortable there, \nbut no traveler should ever be totally confident that he’s seen all of the \nUmbra or that he always knows what to expect. \nThe sample Realms presented below encapsulate some ideas of \nthings in the Umbra as described in the Book of Worlds for Mage. They \nare, however, by no means the only places, and even Storytellers who \nuse that resource should not consider it the be-all end-all of everything \nUmbral. \nCBTHERKENJIS \nCHAS~: \nTHE \nREALIII w THINGS \nLQST \nBecome lost in the Penumbra, follow the cracks and the shadows, \nand there’s a chance you’ll end up at the Chasm. The Chasm is \nessentially a tremendous rift that stretches as far as the eye can see in \neither direction, surrounded by barren, wasted plains. Supposedly, \neverything that’s lost (but not broken) eventually makes its way here. \nJust looking at the Chasm is dangerous: It has a hypnotic effect on \nthe viewer. A mage who looks over the edge of the Chasm and into its \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ndepths must make a Static Willpower Challenge (difficulty of six \nTraits). Failure means that he becomes hypnotized by it. On the \nfollowing turn, he must make another challenge; failing that, the mage \nleaps into the Chasm. If friends don’t save the mage within a turn - \nusing magic, rope, whatever - \nthe mage falls into the darkness beyond \nviewable range and is gone. \nSeveral paths lead down into the Chasm itself. Watching the path \nwhile descending seems relatively safe; it’s only looking into the \nunfettered Deep that carries the hypnotizing, self-destructive weight. \nMages can follow paths of Iron, Gold, Silver, Soil - \neach path seems \nalmost metaphorical as well. Typically, the mage follows a narrow \ncrevice or channel limned with a specific material. The paths seem, in \nsome ways, to apply to metaphors of Ascension; the path of Iron has \njagged rock and treacherous footing, while the path of Gold tempts with \nlost relics and jutting bits of valuable-looking crystals and minerals. \nMages who can’t master their own desires may find the paths too \ndifficult to walk safely. \nBeyond a certain distance down, the gloom of the Chasm becomes \nimpenetrable. The Chasm itself sucks away magical energy; only a few \nhundred feet down and all magical Effects fail. This means (also) that \nmages have no way to see the path or to fly out if they fall.. . . \nSince all things lost end up at the Chasm eventually (if they don’t \nwind up in someone else’s hands), there’s always potential to find a lost \nrelic or bit of knowledge here. The price may be too high, though. It \nseems that nobody ever leaves the Chasm without making some sort of \nsacrifice. \nC@NC@RDIA: H@ES SI-IA’rT€ED \nIn the Renaissance, the Traditions gathered their most powerful \nresources and, with the help of Nodes donated by every Tradition, \ncreated one of the most enduring and powerful Horizon Realms ever \nknown. Called Concordia, the Realm was (and is) an entire world, \ncomplete with people, ecology, landscapes and cities. In the midst of it \nwas Horizon itself - \nthe Traditions’ centerpiece Chantry, the seat of \ntheir archmages’ power and the show of all that mythic strength could \ncreate. \nHorizon was betrayed and destroyed. The Tradition archmasters \nand Primi scattered in its wake. Technocrats crushed the stronghold \nand set up powerful barriers to shut Concordia out from the power of its \nearthly Nodes. Still, with the arrival of the Avatar Storm soon after, the \nTechnocracy lacked the resources to co-opt or destroy Concordia \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncompletely. Horizon itself became little more than a decrepit shell, \noccasionally visited by a daring member of the Traditions, while \nConcordia slowly fell apart around it. \nWithout the power of earthly Nodes to sustain it, Concordia is \ncoming apart. Its people and creatures sicken, and the land cracks and \nshakes. In some places, the world itself breaks off and reveals the endless \nnight-void of the Umbra. Because the world was built as a reflection of \nthe Renaissance, its inhabitants don't understand what's happening; \nthey only know that their paradise is dying, and that the powerful \nwizards who once protected them have died or fled. \nOnly desperate or hopelessly idealistic Tradition mages come here \nnow. In some ways, Concordia once exemplified the best impulses of \nthe Traditions: The Renaissance's cultures and arts all came together in \na world where the Traditions blended their instincts and beliefs. Now \nit's a Realm suffering from the Traditions' hubris. \nDYST~PIA: THE \nb ~ r n  \ne+ THE CITY \nSome mages think of Dystopia as the near future. Others assert that \neven the Technocracy would never allow the world to come to this fate. \nThis is a Realm crafted in the image of Memopolis and Blade RU~WT. A \nRealm where the great, technologically advanced but socially decadent \ncities sprawl over a dessicated landscape in a world where progress' \neffluvia permanently blackens the sky. \nWhen mages travel along Umbral roads between sprawling \nskyscrapers, they sometimes approach Dystopia. The city itself is nearly \nlimitless; it's as if civilization had spread endlessly across the face of the \nplanet. Skyscrapers rise up from asphalt and blacksoil, while in between \nthem low, neon-sign-covered buildings huddle with their patched roofs \nand metal-corrugated walls, barely keeping out the acidic rains. Sunlight \nis wan at best, and nightfall lit by the burning of multitudes of glaring \nlights and giant screens. \nIn the depths of the streets and below them, squatters eke out a \nprecarious existence from the trash and rubbish that trickles down. \nEntire villages, buried by new layers of technology, exist under the \ncities. Above them, the masses work and live in cramped apartments, \nstaring at glazed computer screens in cubicles. At the tops of the \nskyscrapers, above the toxic clouds, are the arboreal palaces of the few \nand privileged, who live in the sky with the sun. \nPattern-based spirits are common in Dystopia, though they usually \ntake the form of small robots or computer programs. Mages must be \ncautious: Technology for tracking strangers is much better than Earth's, \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nand mages have none of the identity cards, chips or numbers that \nDystopia's citizens take for granted from birth. Even the Technocracy \nshuns this place; its bleak take on social structure and its polluted \nwreckage are signs of a failed technology. \nCitizens of Dystopia often have small Enhancements (as the \nBackground): Many can plug into computer terminals or have small \ncosmetic modifications. The people who live Down Below are often \nmutated aberrations, by contrast, turned squalid by their living \nconditions. \nThe streets of Dystopia often seem eerily familiar. That's because \nthey're borrowed from the streets of the most teeming cities the world \nover. A vendor's cart from Hong Kong may stand in front of a Calcutta \nalleyway in which lurks a tin shack used as housing in New York. \nMages in Dystopia are recommended to leave as expediently as \npossible. Unfortunately, the only sure way out is to either get above the \ncloud layer and use magic to Leave (a tricky proposition, because of all \nthe guards and protections on the upper class), or to pay off a local spirit \nto guide one out and hope that it doesn't signal an alarm. \nTHE \nDIGITAL WEB \nPerhaps the most infamous of magely Realms is the Digital Web: \nthe magical reflection of the connections behind all computer, telephone \nand similar communication devices. While Sleepers can experience \nthe Web in its mundane internet form, mages with the right Effects or \ndevices can actually enter the Digital Web and see an entire computerized \nworld of virtual reality. \nWhen entered holistically or with sensory input, the Digital Web \nresembles some sort of strange cross between Tron, Johnny Mnemonic, \nThe Matrix and just about every other vision of cyberspace out there. \nBright lines of light connect distant vistas; travelers can enter these \nvistas and find themselves in mini-Realms (\"sectors\") that have patterns \nand rules just like any other Realm. It's possible for a web sector to seem \nlike a haunted castle, a Victorian manor, a high-tech spacecraft or just \nabout any other imaginable setting; it all depends on the whims of the \nmage who \"formatted the sector and programmed it. \nWhile in the Digital Web, mages interact through their \"icons\" - \ndigital representations of themselves. Mages who enter solely with \nMind magic often take on a sort of abstract representation or simple \nimage; mages who enter holistically (in body, using Correspondence and \nLife) have \"physical\" reality in the web as well. Actions in the Web \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\nreflect things going on in the internet: For instance, a mage can “see” \nlayers of things not visible to Sleepers. A mage doesn’t see a website as \na static, flat thing, but rather an object floating in the air with images \naccording to its design. Because the mage exists in a more detailed \ndimension of webspace, it’s possible for the mage to also do tricks that \nseem impossible to Sleepers, like easily rearranging websites, booting \nSleepers from the ‘net, even providing streams of real-time information \nfrom sound and video that seem implausible to Sleepers. \nWithin the Web, everything’s a construct of Forces - \nenergy given \na virtual form. Thus, mages must use Forces to control, create or destroy \n“objects” in the Web. A mage who enters holistically can bring items \nwith him but must use Matter and Forces to give themvirtualequivalents. \nConversely, a master of Forces can create items at a whim. \nOf course, the Digital Web isn’t all fun and computer games. People \nwho experience the Web for long periods of time tend to suffer \nrepetitive stress injuries, headaches, eyestrain and back trouble - \nall \nsigns that the Web slowly pulls a trickle of Quintessence from its users \nto sustain itself. Some programs in the Web can be dangerous, and \nNephandi and worse also lurk in the digital byways. Plus, there’s the \ndanger of a crash. During the Reckoning, the entire Web crashed and \n“whited out.” As a result, dozens of web-spinning mages died, their \nAvatars torn into fractal patterns and scattered across webspace. Entire \nsectors were lost; in some places, pieces of original programming \npatterns shone through, making haunted areas. And, of course, more \nSleepers become hooked up every day, and they’re always becoming \nmore skilled. Eventually they may reach the same level of skill that \nmages have with the web. \nENTERING \nTHE WEB \nA mage can experience the Web in multiple different forms. Using \nMind magic, a mage can send his mind into the Web itself. In this form, \nthe mage has a translucent icon indicating that he’s essentially a \nprojected sensory presence. The mage can experience the Web but \ncan’t actually affect it without doing magic. \nUsing Life and Correspondence, a mage can holistically shift into the \nWeb. Spirit can do this as well; mages theorize that the Web is, in some \nsenses, a manifestation of Correspondence space (the “space between \nspaces,” if you will) and therefore that Spirit isn’t always necessary. A \nphysically-present mage literally vanishes from the “real” world and \nappears inside the Web, and can move around, interact with things and \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\ncause repercussions just as a result of picking things up, breaking them, \nsetting them on fire, etc. \nMages experiencing the Digital Web holistically do cross the \nAvatar Storm (unless you don’t want to use the Storm, or want to make \nthe Web a popular stomping ground). \nTypical foci used for entry include virtual rigs (for sensory entry) or \nfull-body virtual suits like those in The Lawnmower Man (for holistic \nentry). \nREPRESENTING \nTHE WEB \nRepresenting the Web in your game is much like representing any \nother Realm. You can use a separate room and place players there when \ntheir characters visit the Web. Dress it up with colored lighting, \nespecially strip-lighting and glow sticks; use computer parts from \nsecond-hand stores to add to the technology appearance. Some special \nsites might have ground rules that make them look like a different \nRealm; you’ll want to use a slightly off-colored light to make these \nplaces seema little “odd” even if they’re meticulously designed to match \nup with what they seem to be. (Note how in The Manix a green filter’s \nused for all scenes that take place in webspace.) \nYou can also use IRC and similar internet chat programs for Web \nreps. A tech-savvy player can set up a mIRC room, and mages can drop \nby there to chat. In the Digital Web, such private havens can take on \nthe appearance of actual rooms, and the mages can see each other and \nconverse (or even fight!) normally. Just make sure that a Storyteller is \non hand to moderate! \nFor a much more detailed look at the Digital Web, see the \nsourcebook Digital Web 2.0. This gives example locations, some rotes \nand chronicle ideas revolving around the Web. \nrobert wheeler (order #16032)\n6\n\n\n%, \n1 ,IC ,C\",JC.u CULL..,I. \n\"I \nYU..., \n\"L \nU.S *..b... \nI .  mdates Mind's Eve Theatre with the develoD- \nFrom the shrinking \ncities, the signs are ev \nI \nSTOCK #SO22 \n$19.95 U \nis nigh.
