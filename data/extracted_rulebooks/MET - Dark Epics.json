Your characters interact with numerous\nStoryteller characters throughout the course of the game, all of whom are filtered\nthrough the imagination and portrayal of the Storyteller.\nWhen you step into a live-action roleplaying game, however, everything\nchanges. In a tabletop chronicle, your Storyteller represents all the roles that you\nencounter, be they pivotal to the story or not. Now, it’s possible that of the dozens\nof people milling about the venue, any could be a Storyteller character, could be vital\nto your character’s plot, could be irrelevant, could be… anything. Real one-to-one\nnumbers represent the creatures of the setting, at least insofar as any given scene is\nconcerned. You’re now face-to-face with the situation, and you no longer have a\ncentral single person presenting the worldview to you.\nWe all prefer different styles of gaming. Some prefer one-shot games involving\nimmediate plots and resolutions. Some of us prefer smaller, more personal chronicles\nthat focus on the characters and their internal issues and in which the external\npolitics are merely a background to the central characters’ lives. Smaller games allow\nfor more personal interaction between Storytellers, players, plots and the rules. If\nyour chronicle consists of seven players and one Storyteller, it can be run like a\ntabletop game, describing the reactions of the World of Darkness and helping\neveryone through the challenges they perform. The feel is personal, the plots can be\ngrand and world-changing, and the mechanics of the rules can be governed by the\nconsensus of the players. In a game of this size, the Storyteller has a good idea of what\neach character is doing, and he can work on character development, personal horror\nand intriguing plot twists from each character’s past.\nCHAPTER ONE:\nINTRODUCTION\n"

We want a chronicle that\nis rich in history and a story that evolves in response to our characters’ actions. We\nwant to create something lasting and memorable that we can revisit time and again.\nBecause so many roleplayers have these desires, they share their games with each\nother, intertwine their stories and invite others to experience the interactivity of this\nhobby. The numbers in a chronicle swell, and the Storyteller has to take up the slack.\nSome Storytellers prefer to keep their chronicles small, choosing to emphasize\nintimacy and ensuring a comfortable workload for their staff and themselves. Placing\na limit on the number of players is a reasonable method of controlling the scope of\nthe game, in and out of character.\nOthers embrace the growth of the chronicle and work hard to produce the best\nroleplaying environment possible for the swelling mass of players that they must\naccommodate. Additionally, a popular chronicle may go on for years as old stories\ndevelop, characters grow and new ideas and new people keep the game fresh. Any\nStoryteller will find that tweaks to the rules and systems with which they are familiar\nwill eventually be necessary.\nAs the game grows larger, conflicts between more players subtly shift the\nchronicle away from a situation in which the Storyteller describes the World of\nDarkness to one in which the players define the World of Darkness for each other.\nEven if the ratio of Storytellers to players is the same as that of a smaller game, the\nlarger game becomes less personalized for each character. Unlike a game with one\nStoryteller and seven players, no one Storyteller can know the plans of each and\nevery character in a game with 10 Storytellers and 70 players. Many player actions\nand challenges take place beyond the view of the Storytellers in a large game. Social\ndynamics also become a factor in the 70-person game, whereas personal dynamics\nare more prominent in the seven-person game. Therefore, the psychological rules of\nplay change for everyone involved.\nTHERE\nHERE\nHERE\nHERE\nHERE B B B B BE G\n G G\n G GIANTS\nIANTS\nIANTS\nIANTS\nIANTS\nThe sheer scope of organizing a one-shot convention game, administering a\nnetwork of games or simply keeping a large chronicle going from month to month\nall have their own challenges. Mind’s Eye Theatre provides a core system for event\nresolution, basic information on genre-specific social dynamics and guidelines for\nrunning an average game.

Such\na game includes one or two Storytellers, a handful of Narrators and perhaps 20 to 30\nplayers in regular attendance over a few years.\nThe Storyteller’s load is still manageable at this level, but it is significant. If the\ngame has newsletters, rumor sheets, character sheets, item cards, Willpower tokens\nand other paraphernalia to hand out during each session, these routine tasks can use\nup time and resources that might be better spent on more important aspects of the\ngame, such as plot development, genre interaction and a Narrator’s character\nportrayal. The Storyteller would be wise to delegate some of these tasks to her\nNarrators or players.\nThe average number of people in any given scene is likely to remain low (less\nthan 10) for a small game, barring major gatherings such as a prince’s announcement\n"

The players will tend to drift into\nand between groups, staying in smaller, more discrete numbers (coteries, clans or\npower blocs), until it is necessary for the city’s inhabitants to assemble.\nWith such small average scenes, it is much easier for players and Narrators to\nfollow rules designed to segue easily between roleplaying and so-called “ruleplaying.”\nThe detail available through the application of the Mind’s Eye Theatre rules is more\nrepresentative of in-game reality at this level. Mass challenges are likely to be\nresolved quickly, and everyone in the scene can communicate easily to resolve any\ndifficulties or confusion.\nThe regular Mind’s Eye Theatre books can stretch comfortably to accommo-\ndate a game of up to 50 to 75 players with few problems if the Storytellers and\nNarrators are capable of running the game smoothly while also handling the details\nof the game between sessions. As the size of the game expands, the Storyteller may\nfind it difficult to juggle all of the information he requires in order to maintain the\ngame (such as character sheets, status, plots, backgrounds and character goals). No\nsingle Storyteller can realistically be expected to remember everything, and keeping\nrecords becomes more and more important.\nGames usually need an administrative staff by the time they reach the 50- to 75-\nplayer mark. One Storyteller might maintain the character database while another\nhandles Influence actions throughout the month, and yet another ensures that\nnewsletters and props are ready for Saturday night. Meanwhile, a Narrator contacts\nall the players to let them know that the venue has been booked and that the game\nthis week will involve the Ventrue primogen’s deathnight celebrations. She then\nupdates the website with directions to the game and sends a copy to the group’s email\nlist. Sharing the load is a Good Thing.\nIf your game continues to grow, you’ll find that you need to adjust a few things\nsooner or later. You’ll have to tweak some internal game systems to maintain balance\nand deal with the growing administrivia, for example. Fortunately, that’s what this\nbook is here to help you do.\nBY T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E B\n B B\n B BOOK\nOOK\nOOK\nOOK\nOOK\nThe standard Mind’s Eye Theatre book emphasizes the establishment of core\nrules for playing the game. For example, Laws of the Night gives us a complete\nsystem to cover the resolution of most situations that arise in an average Mind’s Eye\nTheatre game. That book covers rules for character creation, challenge resolution,\na basic set of social structures and all the essential information you will need to run\na Mind’s Eye Theatre game. It establishes a central system around which more\ndetailed (or simplified) rules versions can be constructed, if necessary.\nExpansion books, such as the Laws of the Night Camarilla Guide and the Laws\nof the Night Sabbat Guide, are rich sources of material for developing your\nchronicle’s background, resources, antagonists and the darker side of its history.\nThese books contain rules for dealing with elders, expanded options for character\nconcepts, more details on the specific societies upon which each book focuses and\nguidelines for settings and plots. However, as helpful as these books are, they still\nfocus on a smaller game.\nThe remainder of the available background material for the World of\nDarkness can be found in White Wolf’s tabletop supplements.

Each\nhas information and misinformation that can contribute to your chronicle or\nnetwork game. Additionally, supplements such as Nights of Prophecy deal with\nthe metaplot — the overall and ongoing history of the World of Darkness as it\nhas been laid out by White Wolf.\nAs a guide for network games that follow the World of Darkness, these resources\nare invaluable. They provide a source of consistency that any chronicle can access\nto stay on the same page as its neighbors. If discrepancies arise in the flow of play in\nthe network (if the Gangrel were treated nicely, for instance, and Xavier is sitting\ndown for tea and scones with Hardestadt tomorrow evening) then the network will\nneed to make those differences known to the rest of the member chronicles. The\nmember chronicles will also need to notify intended players of these differences so\nthat, again, everyone remains on the same page.\nFor large or convention games, these sourcebooks can be used to paint the\nbackdrop of the rest of the world, if needed. External consistency is less important\nwhen your chronicle is not related to or affected by any others.\nDURABILITY\nURABILITY\nURABILITY\nURABILITY\nURABILITY\nThe Mind’s Eye Theatre books are designed to deal with short- to medium-\nterm chronicles lasting for a couple of years and in which games are held once or\ntwice a month. Usually, the chronicle will cover the development and conclusion\nof one or two major story arcs, and the overarching theme will remain constant.\nThe growth of characters over that period of time in terms of Experience Traits\nwould be within the range of 20-30 Traits, depending on the rate of play and\nadvancement. As a slice of the character’s life, the chronicle is an active and exciting\none in which the character grows and learns.\nThe chronicle would also address the growth and experience of the city in\nwhich it is set, but it is likely that such background evolution will be marked only\nas the backdrop against which the characters strut their stuff.\nIt is possible to use the regular books for long-term chronicle play, but the\naccelerated rate of character growth that derives from the standard rules can give rise\nto characters who become too powerful too quickly. Games that play frequently\n(once a fortnight, maybe more) but still award the usual one to three Experience\nTraits per game will quickly notice the disparity between the rate of growth of a\nMind’s Eye Theatre character and that of a similar tabletop character.\nInterconnected chronicle networks present their players with the opportunity\nto visit other games, and thus to earn additional Experience Traits for their\ncharacters. Storytellers must scrutinize the growth rate of those characters in\ncomparison with non-traveling characters in order to make sure that a balanced\nprogression takes place throughout the organization.\nEXPANSION\nXPANSION\nXPANSION\nXPANSION\nXPANSION\nLARPs become large around the 75-player mark. That figure is fairly arbitrary,\nbut experience has shown it to be accurate as a guideline. You may consider a game\nlarge if it hits only the 50-player mark, or you might consider a game of 200 players\nto be perfectly comfortable. As in any generalized demographic, your mileage may\nvary. The kind of games that you’d find at a convention or a gathering of chronicles\nfrom within a LARPing network may have hundreds or thousands of players, which\ncertainly places them within the large category.\n"

Players bring along their significant others to show them\nwhat they’ve been involved in on Saturday nights, but the SO might play only\na couple of times and then drop out. People also drag friends along for\nsomething to do for the evening, but those friends sometimes find that live-\naction roleplaying is not for them. Some casual gamers may or may not turn up,\ndepending on what’s on TV that night. As far as the population figures for a\nsingle ongoing chronicle go, we’re referring to regular players (i.e., those who\nattend the game 75% of the time).\nGames will grow to the aforementioned size if your local area has the gamer\npopulation to support it and if the quality of the game is such that others\nrecommend it to their friends. Some games prefer to vet potential players in\norder to ensure compatibility with their game styles. Others advertise for\ninterested individuals, and still others allow anyone to turn up to try the game.\nIn any case, players will stay if they have fun and if they see that the chronicle\nis run fairly and well. They also need to know that the staff is capable of handling\nthe necessary paperwork. In the end, remember, it’s not the size of the game that\nmatters; it’s the quality that counts.\nLARGE\nARGE\nARGE\nARGE\nARGE G G G G GAMES\nAMES\nAMES\nAMES\nAMES\nAs a chronicle matures and develops, it will attract new players, whether they\nare seasoned roleplayers, newly interested gamers or casual give-it-a-try types.\nPeople come and go as their interest waxes and wanes. A game’s population is\ntypically dynamic and ever-changing.\nSometimes, the quantity of players in a popular chronicle rises to an over-\nwhelming number. If the game rocks, the population stays high, and the Storyteller\nfinds herself with more players than she knows how to handle or entertain. Roles and\nplots expand, and the scope of the chronicle expands as well. The entire situation\nwould be a real challenge for any Storyteller to deal with.\nChronicles that enter this upward spiral will eventually encompass all levels of\ntheir chosen genre on the city scale. Players will take the roles of elders and princes,\nbishops and paladins, Garou elders or local dukes. Simultaneously, the lower\nechelons expand to encompass the underdogs, all of whom are exciting and vibrant\ncharacters in and of themselves.\nMost of the players would play “average” citizens of the genre — the neonates,\nancillae, fosterns and wilders of the area — while a few may hold positions of\nauthority in the city’s power structure. If your chronicle is large enough, you may\nhave players’ characters holding primogen positions, or even portraying the prince\nand his city officers.\nSo how does a Storyteller deal with organizing all of these people? The game\nneeds a site large enough to accommodate everyone comfortably. It needs plots that\nwill hold the interest of as many players as possible. It needs to develop sub-plots that\nwill keep the rest of the players happy as well, unless they’re comfortable dealing\nsolely with plots of their own creation.\nThese large games — let’s cement a lower boundary of 75 people to that label\n— are amazing fun when they are run well. They can also be mind-splitting\nheadaches when they are run poorly.\n"

Imagine a chain of interconnected chronicles that encompasses and\npresents the World of Darkness and the machinations of the monsters that dwell\ntherein. Imagine a cohesive mega-chronicle of thousands of characters’ intertwining\nstories that reach around the world and in which the potential repercussions are felt\nfor years to come.\nMind-boggling? Perhaps. An administrative nightmare? Maybe. But is it\npossible? Very definitely. In fact, several such organizations already exist and have\nbeen in operation for a number of years. New groups form and grow with their own\nstyles of administration and interaction, which ensures a wide range of options for\nany isolated chronicle that might consider becoming a part of such a group.\nThese network groups consist of like-minded chronicles that have joined\ntogether to present their view of the World of Darkness to their players on a local,\nnational or global scale. Sometimes, the groups focus primarily on one genre-group,\nsuch as The Masquerade or The Shining Host. Others admit a cross-section of\ngenres, each of which exists alongside the others.\nIn a single chronicle, a Storyteller has the freedom to take his stories wherever\nhe wishes. He has complete autonomy, and the genre police are not going to come\nknocking on his door if he decides that the Camarilla finally wiped out the\nGiovanni in a fit of pique. A network, however, relies on chronicles working\ntogether to remain on the same page. Therefore, the individual chronicles must be\nprepared to sacrifice some of their autonomy in order to comply with the overall\nvision of the network.\nIndividual chronicles within the network do not have to be large, but the total\nnumber of players in a network certainly brings the count to staggering proportions.\nThousands of people worldwide share their roleplaying experiences under a commu-\nnal umbrella, knowing that the actions that they take next Saturday night might\naffect enemies and allies across the continent. The potential for interaction between\ncharacters is enormous, whether that interaction occurs via the Internet or players\nactually traveling to other member chronicles in order to further their own plots,\nmake allies and meet fellow players in person. Given the combined talents of\nhundreds of Storytellers working together, you can be sure that the games remain\ninteresting and fresh. Every chronicle can touch the next with its plots, and every\ncharacter can reach the others with his stories.\nSuch groups rely on communication, compromise and courtesy, just as any\nsmaller single chronicle does, albeit on a larger scale. Networks need a central\nsupport structure to guide members in their dealings with other chronicles. Smaller\nnetworks (which comprise only a handful of member chronicles) may be able to\noperate comfortably on a casual consensual basis, but the larger networks require a\nset of rules to deal with the administration of the networks and the interactivity of\ntheir members. An out-of-game council or committee reflects the organizational\nneeds of such groups, looking after the out-of-character maintenance that is\nnecessary for such a network to remain cohesive. In order for the communal game\nto flourish as a whole, some degree of bureaucracy is required to represent and\nmonitor the interests of the individual chronicles in the network.\nThe internal structure of these organizations varies according to the desires of\nthose within. Some networks prefer a top-down structure, in which a central\n"

Another group may\nencourage the communal development of plots by representatives from each\nmember chronicle.\nThe Storyteller workload will vary according to the size of any individual\nchronicle within the network. The degree of involvement of the network in the\nusual maintenance of a member chronicle is minimal. The network administrators\noversee the shared and universal aspects of the World of Darkness, and they\ncoordinate their efforts with the chronicles involved as necessary.\nCONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nSome roleplayers revel in convention games, large conglomerations of people\nwho meet annually to game the heck out of whatever scenario is thrown at them.\nThese massive gatherings are usually annual affairs, drawing hundreds of players\nfrom around the world together to share their styles of gaming.\nEven smaller convention gatherings of 100-200 people can be a challenge for\na Storyteller who is accustomed to dealing with a couple dozen of his friends every\nLOCAL\nOCAL\nOCAL\nOCAL\nOCAL A A A A AR E A\nR E A\nR E A\nR E A\nR E A N\n N\n N\n N\n NETWORKS\nETWORKS\nETWORKS\nETWORKS\nETWORKS\nAn interesting subset of the network arises when a multi-genre chronicle’s\npopulation grows too large. The split-genre local network consists of a series\nof games run in parallel in the same setting, one game for each genre (i.e.,\nsupernatural creature type). Each game has a specialized set of Storytellers,\nand the Storytellers from each of the games meet regularly to govern cross-\nchronicle interactions.\nTheoretically, minimal cross-genre interaction should occur on a player\nlevel, so the major interaction would occur through the effects that the\ncharacters have on their environment. Most types of characters can have the\nInfluence Background, so any individual can affect the Influence of another\ncreature in the same city directly. The responsibility of sorting out these\ninteractions falls upon the Storytellers, who resolve the interactions and report\nthe results back to the players affected.\nIt is very possible that players may play different characters in several or all\nof these games, and policies must be made to deal with the potential of\noverlapping interest or plots with these characters. Players of multiple charac-\nters should be able to separate the information and plots of each of their\ncharacters, but at times a conflict of interest may arise.\nIf these games are in violent contention (in character) with each other,\nthen interaction may be more immediate, and rules of engagement on an out-\nof-character level may need to be resolved by the collective Storytellers. Is it\nacceptable for the werewolf characters to kill other players’ vampire charac-\nters during the day if they know where the vampires in question sleep? What\nsort of impact will direct conflict have on the flow of the individual chronicles\nand the entire network? Is it okay to wipe out a chronicle for reasons of genre?\nWell, no, it’s not. Players should know better and plan more nefarious and fun\nways of dealing with their opponents. Conflict between two characters is\ncommon, and it can be dealt with easily. Conflict between two species is to\nbe avoided unless you really enjoy hours of challenges and dealing with\nembittered players in the aftermath.\n"

The logistics of pre-registering hundreds of players,\ncreating or vetting a similar number of characters and finding venues and accommo-\ndations adds a considerable amount of work to the usual duties that a Storyteller\nwould perform in the course of a smaller game.\nStories for convention games often focus on a singular event or series of\nevents, the background for which is outlined for the players when they arrive at\nthe game. Similarly, the characters in play are generated by the convention staff,\nrather than being the players’ regular characters. These one-shot events allow\nplayers to exercise their acting skills in different roles than those they may be\naccustomed to in their regular game.\nNetworks may also hold their own convention-style gatherings — conclaves\nor moots or simply Halloween or Christmas gatherings — in which they invite\nmembers to bring their regular characters together. These conventions help build\nthe sense of community within the network, and they can serve to play out pivotal\nevents in the network’s own metaplot. Due to their origins in the network, the\ncohesive nature of these games makes the game easier for the Storytellers in terms\nof constructing plot and characters. These conclaves will already be rife with\naction from ongoing inter-chronicle plots, as well as personal character rivalries\nand alliances. The workload decreases due to the valuable assistance of Storytell-\ners from other chronicles who can help with a number of matters.\nStand-alone conventions are a lot of hard work (and we’ll discuss them further\nin the next chapter), but they are very rewarding if all goes well.\nLESS\nESS\nESS\nESS\nESS C C C C COMMON\nOMMON\nOMMON\nOMMON\nOMMON I I I I ITERATIONS\nTERATIONS\nTERATIONS\nTERATIONS\nTERATIONS\nISOLATED\nSOLATED\nSOLATED\nSOLATED\nSOLATED C C C C CHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nAlmost the inverse of a network, an isolated chronicle draws in players from\nneighboring areas because it is the only game in a large area due to either geographic\nor demographic concerns. In a vast but sparsely populated area, players are unlikely\nto live near each other, and would probably travel to a central location to play.\nA considerable amount of communication is necessary for a widespread but\ncentralized game to remain cohesive, and the Storytellers will need to be adept\norganizers. Available transportation and ease of travel may be a concern in some\nplaces, and those in the isochronicle will assist each other as much as possible to\ngather for the game.\nIf the interest (and therefore, population) in the game continues to grow, then\nan isochronicle may evolve into a network.

Rules of play will vary according to the game’s interpre-\ntations of the Storyteller system’s rules and the systems the chronicle utilizes to\ndetermine the outcome of challenges.\nSEQUELS\nEQUELS\nEQUELS\nEQUELS\nEQUELS A N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D O\n O O\n O\n OFFSHOOTS\nFFSHOOTS\nFFSHOOTS\nFFSHOOTS\nFFSHOOTS\nAs games grow, players may discover a need to divide themselves into smaller\nor more defined games, sometimes depending on personal taste or style, or depending\non how they’d rather see the game played.\nSpin-offs are smaller, more focused games that originate from a larger parent\ngame. They tell stories of a group that is separate from the main parent, but these\ngames can quickly blossom into independent chronicles. Spin-off games sometimes\narise after a large multi-genre game splinters into smaller single-genre fragments, but\nthey maintain a network-style consistency of setting. A larger game may separate\ninto several neighboring smaller games (which are either networked or separate),\nwhile maintaining the shared history of the earlier chronicle. Another permutation\nis an intimate regular game involving only a handful of players from the parent game\nwho meet separately, but follow the same continuity as the original game.\nEpilogues or aftershocks are games that sometimes stem from convention\ngames, portraying the aftermath in the lives of the convention characters. Some-\ntimes players meet at a convention and decide to resume playing the characters that\nthey were given to play at the event. Players may wish to continue exploring these\ncharacters after a chronicle officially ends.\nParallel games usually arise when a group of players splits into two factions over\na difference in style preference. The overall plot and history of the resulting parallel\ngames remain the same, but each game may take a different path. As with a spin-off,\nthis type of game may arise due to a split-up of a multi-genre chronicle. Parallel games\nare not usually networked, and they share little other than a common background.\nIN FOR\nFOR\nFOR\nFOR\nFOR THE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE D\n D D\n D\n DURATION\nURATION\nURATION\nURATION\nURATION\nA long-running game can be defined as one that has run regularly over an\nextended period of time. Okay, that’s nicely vague, without actually giving any\ndefinitive reference points. Let’s clarify.\nHow often does a game have to run to be considered “regular”? You may play\nyour LARP monthly, fortnightly or every full moon. Your LARP may also be an\nannual event that continues the story and plots from the previous year. You might\neven play constantly throughout the week.\nThe duration and frequency of your game will have a marked impact upon its\ngrowth and development. A regular game ensures a consistency of characteriza-\ntion and permits a sense of tangible transition as the protagonists and their\nenvironment change.\nThink of an annual chronicle as a series of feature films, with recurring\ncharacters and evolving plots. The same characters appear and take action, and large\ngaps in time occur between each gathering. Annual chronicles deal with monumen-\ntal events in the existences of these characters’ lives. An annual chronicle maintains\na consistent background and allows for considerably more detailed story work to be\ndone by the staff between the actual games. Meticulous care can be taken to maintain\ntheme, mood, plot, story consistency and quality, and back-stories can be written to\nupdate the players on their characters’ activities throughout the intervening\n"

Additionally, it may be\ndifficult for some players to attend annually, so absent players’ characters may have\nto be played by other people, which causes disparity in the consistency of character-\nization from one year to the next.\nYou can overcome some of these challenges by ensuring that the character\nportfolio that you present to the players is comprehensive and that it includes strong\nroleplaying guidelines. A few convention games follow an annual story, but it is more\ncommon for a convention game to be a one-shot game rather than a chronicle.\nSome chronicles run super-intensively, covering the actions of the characters\non an ongoing basis, and allowing for detailed (and possibly painful) roleplaying\nacuity. The “24/7” chronicle is a very active style in which players are potentially in\ncharacter at any time of the day or (in a Masquerade setting) night. You may\nencounter another player’s character at the local convenience store or at the movies,\nor you can receive phone calls to deal with plot issues at any hour.\nIf such a game is to last more than a few weeks, the storytelling team must\ndevelop methods for dealing with the rate of earning Experience Traits, resolving\nconflicts in the absence of a Storyteller, standards of public play and display, how\nto tell if a player is in or out of character and long-distance storytelling commu-\nnications. Most importantly, the players and the Storytellers need to learn how to\ndeal with roleplaying overload. A game that requires essentially total immersion\ncan take a toll on a player’s everyday life. Remember to keep a reasonable\nperspective and a sense of reality.\nA normal chronicle runs once, maybe twice a month — possibly as often as\nweekly. Our heroes are caught in summary without an in-depth exposition of their\ndaily routine, but in enough detail that we can appreciate their developing\npersonalities from month to month. We know that the characters are not\nconstantly at Elysium or the caern, and we can appreciate that the gatherings that\nthey have with the others of their kind in the city are sporadic occurrences rather\nthan the norm of an evening.\nThe long-running or stabilized chronicle can be identified by a number of\ncommon elements. It has been in regular play for well over a year, and it has\nestablished a strong set of house interpretations of the published Mind’s Eye\nTheatre rules. A communications network (email lists and/or phone numbers) is in\nplace, and people are responsible for overseeing and maintaining it. Regular game\nsites have been found, and a set of protocols for dealing with incoming new players\nhas been developed. The Storytellers have probably changed at some point,\nalthough some of the original members may still be in their original position. It’s\nlikely that players have moved up to fill Narrator and Storyteller positions, and the\nchronicle has worked out a way to deal with such transitions. In other words, the hard\nwork has been done, and the chronicle can settle in for the long haul. As long as the\nstories remain fresh and interesting and the staff is prepared to handle the workload,\nthere is no reason why a chronicle cannot continue for many years.\nGROWING\nROWING\nROWING\nROWING\nROWING P\n P\n P\n P\n PAINS\nAINS\nAINS\nAINS\nAINS\nAny game that plays regularly for a long time will evolve.

As the sum of the\ncontributions of everyone involved, the flow of the game will change depending\nupon those contributions.\nTHEME\nHEME\nHEME\nHEME\nHEME\nYour theme doesn’t have to vary from month to month, but it may do so. As a\nStoryteller, you will need to decide whether you will allow the characters to\ndetermine the theme and mood, or whether your subtle manipulations of plot, story\nand Storyteller characters will maintain the prevailing feel of the game. You and your\nteam of Storytellers and Narrators can influence the atmosphere in a variety of ways.\nWith a large long-running game, multiple themes can arise, and it\nbecomes difficult with so many different characters (each with their own\nmotivations and goals) to maintain a strong predominant theme. It’s possible\nthat every theme that has ever been mentioned in a White Wolf book is in use\nat any one time to some degree as the players take control of the action and\nswing the chronicle into areas that the Storytellers had not considered.\nEnthusiastic players will have their own ideas about how the theme of a\nchronicle affects their characters, and their roleplaying will shape the overall\ntheme and mood of the chronicle in due course.\nIf a predominant theme of chaos, for example, kick-starts the chronicle — the\nprevious prince has been murdered, and the city must re-establish order — then\neventually the chaos will subside as the characters find a new prince and stabilize the\nCamarilla presence. While this story arc is fine for a one-shot or short-term game,\nthat predominant theme will pass its use-by date very quickly in a long-running\nchronicle, and another theme must be introduced or developed. However, with the\nexit of one theme comes the entrance of another, and the motivations of the\ncharacters will likely shape the theme of the next game. If one vampire becomes\nprince to the detriment of another, revenge may be the next theme. If the choice is\nunpopular, rebellion may become the flavor of the month.\nHISTORY\nISTORY\nISTORY\nISTORY\nISTORY\nEvery event in a game becomes a slice of the chronicle’s communal story. All\nthe characters contribute to it, whether they do so as pivotal main characters, foils,\nsupporting roles or cameos. The history of the chronicle continues from the jump-\noff point that the Storytellers provided initially, and the game then grows in its own\nunique direction.\nAs a game ages, it is fun to look back over the prior months or years and\nsummarize the turning points in various characters’ development. Amusing anec-\ndotes, rumors and tall tales all shape the history of any community, and the collation\nof these memories gives the game a stronger sense of depth with each passing year.\nThe players are acquainted more intimately with the major story that they have\nconstructed — the story of the world in which their characters exist.\nA common phenomenon among players of a chronicle that helps keep the\nhistory of a game alive is the telling of “war stories” — remembrances of events in\ngames past. As with traditional storytelling, this verbal sharing of events can\neducate new players in important events in the setting’s history and give them an\nidea of the style of chronicle they are playing. The stories are typically of the, “No\nshit, there I was…” variety, and they are biased from the character’s point of view;\nbut then what first-person view of any history wasn’t biased by the observer?

A new\nplayer’s unfamiliarity with the nuances of your chronicle can disrupt the smooth flow\nof roleplaying your regulars have come to expect.\nTraining novices can absorb a considerable amount of time, although the\nmajority of their learning will occur as they play the game. They need to learn at\nleast the basics of the genre and setting of the game, as well as some of the parlance,\nhow to handle simple challenge situations and how to interact with the other\ngamers. A non-roleplayer’s first time at a LARP can be a very daunting experience,\nand these new players will benefit from some careful attention and mentoring. If\nthe inexperienced player is inundated with information and thrown to the wolves,\nhe may not have a very rewarding experience, and he may not return. You lose\nmore players that way….\nExperienced tabletop players may be old hands at roleplaying, but they have\nnever been in a LARP or in a World of Darkness game, they may need training in\nthe new rules and systems. They also need to be brought up to speed on the setting,\nnetwork protocols and any other situations that are particular to your chronicle. Any\nplayer who presents herself to your chronicle thinking that she already knows\neverything may have a good background in other people’s games and her own\ninterpretations of the rules or genre. However, she needs to be aware that she is\nentering your unique chronicle, with its own variations and expected behaviors.\nAn established chronicle should have systems in place to deal with incoming\nplayers, perhaps including training sessions (“Kindredgarten”) to introduce them to\nthe various aspects of the game. Even experienced players in your own chronicle may\nbenefit from such education. The more familiar your players are with your interpre-\ntation of the World of Darkness, the higher the quality of roleplaying you can expect\nfrom them will be. If people are well-trained in the rules systems you use, the burden\non your Storytellers and Narrators is less, since your players are more self-sufficient\nin resolving challenges or rules disputes.\nMAJOR\nAJOR\nAJOR\nAJOR\nAJOR C C C C CHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nOrganizing any large game will naturally be prone to challenges that are more\nintense or time-intensive than those of smaller games.

Your players are champing at the bit to turn up and\ntell larger stories than they’ve imagined before, and you’ve come up with the killer plot for\nthe chronicle. But you’ll need to sort out a few mundane details before you even get to the\ngame itself. These details comprise the kind of irritating stuff that obstructs your creativity,\nstifles your plotting and crunches into your characterization time. Don’t ignore them,\nhowever.

In networks, a degree of compromise is required to\nbalance the playing field for all the chronicles involved. In large games, the present\npopulation will have a bearing on the choices that are available to a player.\nBecause the players and Storytellers in a seven-person game are able to negotiate and\ndefine the entire world themselves, character creation and setting are very different from\na game that incorporates many cities. When 100 players are involved, the established ratios\nin the World of Darkness play a role in character creation. The conventions of the genre\nstart to unravel when the Lasombra antitribu outnumber the Brujah two-to-one. The World\nof Darkness source material gives indications of the likelihood of X character type being\npresent in any given setting, and these guidelines should be followed to preserve the genre.\nFor example, the appearance of the Harbingers of Skulls has doubtless led to\nplayers asking for access to them as a new and unique character type. The tabletop\nGuide to the Sabbat suggests that Harbingers are most suitable as Storyteller\ncharacters, due both to their strangeness and their rarity. While a Sabbat-based\nchronicle may have a stronger argument for the presence of such beings, the tabletop\nbooks clarify that their presence within the Sabbat is still small and that the Harbingers\n“are all at least eighth generation, and hundreds (if not thousands) of years old.”\nFrom the same source material, the Kiasyd interact rarely with other vampires,\nand they devote their time to contemplation and research.

Not for very long, unless they\nintend to be overcome by Banality. Then there’s the tradition of the Masquerade to\nconsider. Use some common sense when deciding what characters you will allow in your\nchronicle, especially when it comes to cross-genre concepts. Werewolves and vampires do\nnot play nicely in the sandbox together, despite the common misconception that\nwerewolves are cozy with the vampires of Clan Gangrel. How many Corax or Bastet are\nacceptable at a caern? If you are running a multi-genre chronicle, you may need to stretch\nthe conventions of each genre a little to allow for these exceptions. If you are in a stand-\nalone game, this choice is a personal issue for the chronicle. If you are in a network, then\nyou must establish the compromise level in line with the worldview shared by the network.\nHow many elder-class characters will you allow in your chronicle? If you already have\n15 elders in a 70-player game and another player presents you with his new eighth-generation\nTremere from 13th-century France, can you justify allowing another elder into play? Genre-\nbased demographics again can assist as a guideline. If you prefer a glib, face-saving line, try,\n“Too many officers, not enough grunts.” In order for your game to portray a reasonably\naccurate representation of the Jyhad, the Methuselahs have to have someone to toy with, the\nelders need someone to manipulate, and the ancillae need someone to kick around. Is it vital\nto the concept that the character’s generation be that low? Some Storytellers may prefer that\ntheir players alternate their characters’ relative power levels when they switch from one\ncharacter to the next. In such an arrangement, not only is the potential for power shared\namong the players, it also allows the individual player to experiment with different levels of\nthe political dynamics and expand his roleplaying capacity.\nYou should also consider the background and outlooks of the character concept\nas they are presented to you and balance the suitability of the personality type with\nthe personality demographics that are already present within the chronicle. If you\nalready have half a dozen Brujah bikers, do you need another one? Why not make\nthe biker a rebellious Ventrue neonate? You’ve added a totally cool character twist\nright off the bat. The archetypes of the clans and tribes allow for an incredible degree\nof versatility in their membership, and it can be tiresome to reinforce the stereotypes\nconstantly. The flip side of this concern is that you do need to make sure that the\nstereotype is maintained before the exception becomes the rule and all your\nincoming Ventrue characters are gum-snapping street-rats.\nAny aspect of a character concept can be altered slightly to create a distinctive\npersonality. While it is certainly easier for a new player to dive into an archetype,\nmore experienced players should be able to come up with interesting variances from\nthe norm that still conform to the common expectations.\nSETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nSimilarly, any deviation from the actual place and time in which the players are\ninvolved has to be explained meticulously to large groups. This is especially true if you\nplay your game in an environment that is not identical to the in-game location.\nImagine the out-of-play disaster that happens when the group patrolling the park\naccidentally comes into the same play area as the group hunting in the forest, and it\ntakes several rounds to figure out that the groups are not in the same place in character.\nIn a large game, you will probably have reached the demographic limit of your\nsupernatural population unless you’re living in a major city. For the Camarilla, the\nMasquerade demands a low-impact presence. The common ratio is one Kindred to 100,000\nmortals, so seven million people could support a population of roughly 70 vampires as long\n"

If only a few hundred thousand people\nlive in your town, then you should theoretically only have a handful of Kindred present.\nSome games basing their chronicles on the town in which they play embellish\nthe in-game mortal population in order to accommodate more vampires. The World\nof Darkness is more populous and more sprawled than our reality, and a population\nboost of the faceless masses shouldn’t stretch a player’s imagination farther than it\nalready has been stretched to play a vampire in the first place.\nYou will also need to consider how much larger that decision makes the city in terms\nof geography. You’ll want to consider drawing up a new map based on the expanded\nnumbers. Where are the schools and hospitals to support these additional people? How\nhas this expansion affected the economy of the region? Extrapolation of your current real-\nlife setting should provide you with most of the answers to these questions, but you’ll need\nto have that information when your players want to start throwing Influence about.\nActually, Influence is another factor that you’ll need to consider, especially if it is\nan important point of conflict between the characters in your chronicle. How much is\nnow available due to the enlarged population? How high are the standards of leadership\nand law enforcement? Even if you do not have an expanded populace, consider how\nmuch of the Influence available in the city is taken up by the characters, and how much\nmay be in the hands of mortals or other Storyteller characters. A city is not an ever-\nexpanding resource that gains an additional three Traits of Church Influence just because\nanother Tremere arrived in town. If you choose to place a limit on Influence, then you\nwill need to tell players who join the game that you are doing so.\nIf your city setting has been addressed in any of the World of Darkness books,\nare you using the same information as is written, or have you altered certain pertinent\npieces of history or public knowledge that need to be clarified for someone who might\nhave read the source material? Is your Baltimore still a Camarilla city?

Rules\nfor character-type distribution, setting variations and using places that are not in any of the\nparticipating cities have to be worked out between all the Storytellers in all the chronicles.\nNetworks must develop policies to deal with these sorts of issues before they arise.\nA unified view of the genre will assist in determining acceptable character-entry\nlevels of power or rarity. If the network has established that the Ravnos antediluvian\nhas not died in India yet, then Clan Ravnos may be a freely accessible choice. If he has\ndied, and the clan was decimated as per the World of Darkness setting, then the\nnetwork may choose to restrict access to that clan since only a hundred or so are\nsupposedly left on Earth. Similarly, if the network decides that characters should be\nlimited to a specific power level (for example, a maximum of eighth generation, or 200\nExperience Traits), then that decision must apply across the board.\nHow will you handle the exchange and manipulation of Influence between\nnetworked chronicles? The Fame Background gives some basic ground rules for how\nthis sort of interaction could be handled, but you will need to be ready for the\npossibility of people manipulating Influence that has already been taken by other\ndenizens. If no Street is left to tweak, whose toes will get stepped on if a neighboring\nGlasswalker decides to help out his buddies with some loaned Influence?\nStorytellers are advised to avoid making major decisions about how their plots affect\nplaces that are not within their geographical area of jurisdiction, in case a game in that area\ndecides to join the network. It is terribly embarrassing when a new city joins a multi-city\nchronicle with a great background only to find out that the new city was a radiation zone\nin the existing chronicle. If you do need to do something external to your chronicle, bring\nit up with the others of your network and make a communal decision to determine a “safe”\nplace for the external event to occur.

If a character originates in\nSaint Louis, and your network has a member chronicle there, then elements of that\nchronicle’s setting should be reflected in the character’s own past. Rather than having\nto create a background from whole cloth, the player can use highlights from events in the\nchronicle’s past to enrich the character’s viewpoints and history.\nFor vampire characters, the opportunities abound to create detailed and structured lineages\nthat can interlink chronicles through broods. Considerable depth can be added to a character\nif the vampire has a solid line of Kindred to look back on for examples. This is especially true for\nfamilial clans, such as the Ventrue and Giovanni. It opens up possibilities for interaction on a\nwider scale instantly if the lineage relates characters in several chronicles.

And yeah, it’s probably going to cost some.\nFinding a site that will be suitable for your chronicle will take some legwork, but\nyou’re best to start off letting your fingers do some walking. The phonebook is a great\nplace to start, and it costs less than bus fare or gas. Check for hotels, rental\naccommodation, clubs, convention centers, camping grounds, parks, schools, enter-\ntainment venues, theatres, anyplace that might be able to handle the number of\npeople that you anticipate attending. Your local city council may be able to help, and\nit may have personnel on staff to deal with just such matters.\nWhile you’re looking for a game site, you will definitely benefit from drawing\nupon the knowledge and experience of your players and staff. Someone may know\nof a place that might be suitable or know someone who knows. Perhaps they even\nknow whom to contact for costs, availability and capacity.\nBy the way, this exercise also increases your area knowledge of your hometown,\nwhich makes it a very useful research method for locations, areas of importance and\nlikely targets of story focus for your chronicle if it is based there.\nSELECTING\nELECTING\nELECTING\nELECTING\nELECTING L L L L LOCATIONS\nOCATIONS\nOCATIONS\nOCATIONS\nOCATIONS\nNow that you’ve selected a handful of prime sites, check them out in person.\n(Don’t just throw away all your options except the one that has the most Gothic-\nPunk name.) Make an appointment with the site’s staff to walk over the site during\nthe day so that you can get a feel for the room and accessibility. A venue will always\nfeel smaller at night, but if it’s small from the outset, it will feel stifling and cramped.\nCheck the place out at night as well, if you intend to play during the darker hours.\nIs the site one big hall? A bonus for crowd scenes, but it’s not so wonderful if it’s\nthe only room you have. It is very hard to run a large game in one open room due to\nthe noise level, if nothing else. Look for enough space to hold two thirds of your\nplayers comfortably in the main hall, and enough space in other rooms to accommo-\ndate two thirds as well. If you have extra space, consider it a bonus. Treasure it. Silent,\ndeserted areas of large premises beg for covert scenes.\nKeep an eye on ambience and layout. Dormitory-style rooms connected by long\ncorridors produce a different mood than partitioned offices. A theater has a different\nroom structure than a hotel. Consider where your props and/ or background music\nwill be best suited and which rooms will lend themselves to the various moods you\nmay wish to engender in your players during the game.\nAsk which aspects of the premises you may be able to modify and what built-in facilities\nmight be used. It is unlikely that a venue used regularly by a number of different groups will\nallow you to redecorate to any great extent. If you can get permission to twist out a few light\nbulbs, however, or even use the PA system for the authority figure’s announcements, then you\nhave another set of setting tools for your Storyteller team. Always ask before burning candles,\nhowever. The site’s fire standards may prohibit their use, or their sprinkler system may be very\nsensitive. After all, nothing dampens a game like… well, okay.\nAccessibility will be another concern. Make sure that you can give easy\ndirections to your players when you notify them of where the site is. Keep an eye out\nfor quick routes from major roads, and note nearby landmarks that will assist in\n"

If you have young players, check the host’s policy on their\npresence. Check to see if any insurance matters must be dealt with in the rental of the\npremises, or whether the rental fee covers that cost. As with any contractual\nagreement, know your responsibilities and your rights. Consult a lawyer if you have to.\nPrivacy is always a concern, and you should cast an eye toward the neighbors when\nselecting your game site. It may be beneficial to check with the owners of the venue to find\nout what the patrons of the neighboring premises might think if it looks at all likely that\nthey may take note of the game. Your primary ally remains communication, and it will be\nworthwhile to talk with those neighbors if you think that they’ll be concerned. You do not\nneed the local authorities casting baleful glares over your activities because an uninformed\nwitness is alarmed by the strange events he has seen taking place next door.\nFinally, consider the cost of rentals. If you can get the place free, that’s all good, but\nit’s likely that you’ll have to shell out. How you work out payment is really up to you and\nbeyond the scope of this book. We might suggest considering forming your game into an\nincorporated club, but your game will need to find out what is required by local laws. If\nit’s for a one-shot event (like a convention), then we seriously suggest financial advice.\nMAINTENANCE\nAINTENANCE\nAINTENANCE\nAINTENANCE\nAINTENANCE\nIf you have an ongoing large game, then you’re likely to want to hang on to the\nideal venue you’ve found. You will need to consider the viewpoint of the host or\nlandlord. On one hand, he’s ensuring the booking of his venue on a regular basis. On\nthe other hand, he may have others who want to reserve the venue for the same nights\nyou planned to play. Be prepared to negotiate such matters, and schedule your games\naround his timetable as much as possible. Is there a difference between Friday and\nSaturday for you and your players? How about the third Saturday instead of the first?\nAre Sundays an option? Be flexible, and you will find your host flexible in return.\nYou’ll also need to be prepared to explain your hobby to this person who has no\nidea of what you’re up to. While a convention of strangely dressed people throwing\narcane hand signals at each other may be a mild social blip as a once-off, regular\noccurrences of such behavior may draw some concern from the management. You’re\nbetter off explaining what you’re involved in so they and their staff understand what\nyou’re into is just a game. Heck, some of them might even want to join in now and then.\nEncourage your players to respect the property. If the management doesn’t want\npeople leaving cigarette butts scattered around the premises, make sure that the smokers\npick up after themselves or use the appropriate receptacles. Don’t allow players to go\nthrough “Staff Only” doors. Try to leave the place cleaner than it was when you arrived.\nRemember that your hosts don’t have to rent to you, and you don’t want to have to go\nlooking for another place too often if you can help it. Actually, this little piece of rocket\nscience goes for any game at any venue. If you want to use the place again, look after it.\nAll games should observe a kind of out-of-character Masquerade when it comes to\ndealing with the non-playing public. One of the primary rules of Mind’s Eye Theatre is Be\nMindful of Others. This rule becomes ultimately important when you have 400 Gothic-Punk\ncharacters in everything from leather to lace milling about. Be aware that you are not just\nresponsible for the reputation of the game, but also the reputation of the venue. The owners\nmake their living from the property. To have it devalued due to the foolish antics of a few\nmisbehaving players can be disastrous to their cash flow. It may also lose you your site.\n"

You’ll only need the place for a night or a weekend, and\nbooking availability for a once-off is simpler to get than trying to persuade the\nestablishment to keep every second Saturday free for gaming.\nIf your game is being run alongside a large established gaming or sci-fi\nconvention, chances are you will be allotted space by the convention organizers in\naccordance with your requested space and the number of players you project to\nattend. Having the convention staff handling some of your work will also mitigate\nconsiderations such as insurance, registration, security and publicity.\nIf you’re on your own, then here are a few things to consider:\nYou can never quite tell how many people may turn up at a convention, especially\nif you have thrown it open to all comers. With a regular game, you have a more accurate\nfigure of how many are likely to be in attendance at any one time. You will need to make\nan intelligent guesstimate as to how many people are likely to attend and thereby what\nsize venue you will require. You then need to balance the final selection of venue with\nthe cost overall and the cost-per-head you will be charging the gamers. Remember that\ninitial enthusiasm can dampen over time, and the flurry of “Hell yeah!” letters may die\noff when the potential players see the registration fees.\nConversely, convention games can get really big really fast. You are better off\ncapping the number of people in attendance based on your venue rather than trying\nto cram extra players in over and above fire safety regulations. While it may seem\nimpolite, pre-registering your players and refusing non-registered entry can alleviate\npotential crowding issues if you have a comparatively small venue. If you advertise\nyour event by saying that pre-registration is required, you are less likely to offend\nthose who turn up on the spur of the moment when you have to turn them away.\nDon’t rush your decision for a convention venue. Other considerations such as\naccommodation for visitors (hotels versus crash-space), availability of late-night\nrefreshments, public transportation hours and routes all should be taken into\naccount before you sign on the dotted line.\nIf you’re expecting out-of-towners to arrive, you will need to make doubly sure that they\ncan find the site. Scout out multiple routes from each of the major entrances to the city. Publish\nthose directions online for the visitors. Make someone (or several people) with a cell phone\nresponsible for taking calls from lost players. Make sure they know the directions as well.\nPREPARATION\nREPARATION\nREPARATION\nREPARATION\nREPARATION O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E V V V V VENUE\nENUE\nENUE\nENUE\nENUE\nIf you’re storytelling in an area that someone else has arranged for you, then make\nsure you reconnoiter the site well in advance of the game. You will need to know your\nterritory, so that if you’re contacted to meet another Storyteller, you have a point of\nreference and don’t get lost on the 14th floor while they await your arrival in reception.\nCheck out the site with your Storyteller/ Narrator team, and sort out which areas will\nbe appropriate for set-scenes you may have scripted. Decide which areas will be communal\ngathering places that all the characters in the game can reach, which areas will be “secure”\n(the Chantry, the sewers, the freehold, etc.) and which areas are designated for out-of-\ncharacter relaxation. Make signs so the players will know which areas are off limits. If you have\nthe staffing capabilities, assign Narrators who are familiar with the workings of the Chantry,\nsewers, freehold, etc., to supervise those specific areas when play is in progress there.\n"

Booking venues, printing character\nsheets and badges, website hosting… all these things take time and resources your\naverage mortal may not have available.\nYour biggest issue is likely to be financing the ongoing expenses, such as rental\nof the game venue, printer paper and ink. Of course, the upshot is that if you can’t\nafford the location, you’re unlikely to be able to continue using it.\nGenerally, charging players for game attendance or club membership can cover\nadministrative costs. You are strongly advised to seek accounting advice before\nembarking on any such mission. Your local accounting laws may require registration\nof your game as a club, non-profit or not-for-profit organization. The finances may\nbe considered income for one or more of your members and therefore taxable. If you\nhave to fork out your own cash, you may need to obtain reimbursement from the\nplayers. Money can be one of the biggest bugbears of a game, and proper handling\nof the finances of a game will reduce tensions due to such matters.\nTime is the other less-considered major resource. There’s never enough of it,\nand if you’re trying to run a large game with a minimal staff, you’ll run out of it sooner\nor later… normally sooner. If you’re holding down a day job and you find that the\nchronicle may as well be a second form of employment because you’re topping 50\nhours a week on it, it may be time to farm out some of the work.\nOptimize the use of your storytelling team by arranging cohesive meetings and\nsorting out issues as or before they arise. If your game is intensive, playing more than\ntwice a month, then weekly meetings become a must to keep on top of things.\nMonthly games can probably survive on monthly meetings unless there is a\nconsiderable amount of downtime activity by the characters to resolve.\nPROPS\nROPS\nROPS\nROPS\nROPS\nAll the suggestions in the other Mind’s Eye Theatre books in regards to\nsetting, ambience, lighting and music apply to large games as well, and you will\nfind that a bit of hard work in these areas is eventually rewarding. You are dealing\nwith a larger scale here, and you will find yourself with much more room to fill.\nDon’t panic and be tempted to cram as many props as you can into each area.\nYour rooms will fill with people quickly, and people obscure properties. You’re\nprobably better off focusing on a few well-placed and well-presented props in any\none area to establish the nature of that area. A cloth-draped throne on a dais\nstates “prince’s chamber” as eloquently as a dozen tapestries. A few strategically\nplaced candelabra will call up the feeling of a Chantry chamber more effectively\nthan dragging in the taxidermically stuffed alligator and all the glassware from\nthe local chemist. Allow the players to stretch their imagination without\novertaxing their attention.\nIf you are fortunate enough to have an established venue and a fair\nassortment of regular props, you might be able to negotiate storing your\nproperty with your host. It will certainly save you having to drag the damned\nstuff across town every weekend.\n"

Additionally, your Storytellers will need to\nhave methods of distributing information quickly to each other and to the players.\nThe storytelling team also needs to develop methods for handling plot contingencies\nand for maintaining the internal records of the chronicle (such as character sheets).\nYou should consider your policies and procedures for managing such information with\ncare. Make sure that up-to-date information is available to anyone who needs it, and that\nthey can contact you (or your designated representatives) easily if they have any questions.\nWith the expanded options available with today’s technology, you have a\nvariety of methods for the dissemination of your chronicle’s information.\nWEBSITES\nEBSITES\nEBSITES\nEBSITES\nEBSITES\nPerhaps the easiest way for a chronicle to maintain a central repository of game\ninformation is through a website. If you’re not an Internet guru, you should delegate\nresponsibility of this site to one or two of your players who know how to handle a\nwebsite, and make sure that they are fed the necessary information to keep the site\ncurrent. One of the biggest killers of websites is stagnation, and if you want to keep\nthe interest of your Internet observers, you’ll need to update regularly.\nEncourage the others in the game to contribute information to the website as\nwell. Have them submit character profiles, photographs, poetry or whatever else\nthey feel will be of assistance. A steady stream of player submissions can help reduce\nthe overall pressure on the Storyteller to create the site from whole cloth while still\nhandling the rest of the chronicle’s organization.\nSetting information is vital. Your chronicle’s historical background, for ex-\nample, will contribute to both new and old players. If you are setting your chronicle\nin the city in which you play, reference the differences that would be notable to a\nresident. You should already have the majority of this information ready to go if\nyou’ve done your pre-chronicle set-up thoroughly. The Laws of the Night Camarilla\nGuide can help you flesh out your setting if you need some hints.\nYour gossip or the player of your harpy (or the Galliards or bards) could be encouraged\nto write regular reports on recent important events and the elders’ announcements.

Some of these facilities allow you to share\nfiles via the Internet. If your house rules (or any other files you might share) are larger\nthan would be considered polite to post in an email (say, 20 kilobytes) you could\nprovide a link for people who wish to see the latest version when it is released by the\nStoryteller team.

Email can be such an impersonal method of\ncommunication, since it lacks any real indication of tonal inflection other than emoticons\nand font faces. Additionally, phone conversations are immediate, so you don’t have to rely\non people checking their email accounts regularly.

What a mission! Chances are good that even a\nsmall chronicle will need to share the duties of handling the out-of-game organization.\nThe Storyteller team structure has many forms, depending on the preferences\nof the people involved. Your preference may be different that the ones we discuss\nhere, but as long as your communication, compromise and courtesy issues are\naddressed and your players are happy, we’re not going to hassle you.\nA common team structure might consist of a head Storyteller and several assistant\nStorytellers. The head Storyteller has the ultimate guiding control over the flow of the\nchronicle, and she delegates areas of responsibility to her assistants. Perhaps one assistant is\nin control of monitoring Influence expenditures and reporting plot developments along those\nlines back to the head Storyteller, while another is responsible for the antagonists’ actions.\nThis structure is really just an expansion of the relationship between Storytellers\nand Narrators, but with an intermediary step. Some games may prefer that the\nNarrators simply assume such responsibilities. The advantages of this structure are the\nfacts that the buck stops somewhere and that an ultimate decision-maker is available\nSECRETS\nECRETS\nECRETS\nECRETS\nECRETS R\n R R\n R REVEALED\nEVEALED\nEVEALED\nEVEALED\nEVEALED\nYour players can gain a large amount of in-character information each game,\nwhether they do so from Storyteller sources or from other characters in the chronicle.\nIn a network, in-character information can come from hundreds of other involved\nplayers who presumably have gotten their information from similar sources.\nMany of the “secrets” of the World of Darkness are written up in the various\nbooks from White Wolf, and they will almost inevitably come into play at some\nstage during the life of the network. It falls to the Storytellers and the administrators\nof the network to ascertain whether or not it is acceptable for sensitive information\n(such as the true story of the Cappadocians) to become publicly known. If a\ncharacter learns of the information in a valid manner — from a Storyteller, by\nwitnessing the events or from a reliable source — then it is almost certain that that\ninformation will reach the ears of other characters, unless the character in question\nis really good at keeping secrets. Such information then spreads like wildfire via\nemail and other avenues of modern communication, and it becomes “valid” for the\nentire network to have it. Thus the value of that secret is reduced to doggerel.\nIf you wish to preserve the mystery, then simply don’t allow the information to\nbe released. Since you’re part of a network, other Storytellers will have decided\nwhether or not they want their characters to know piece of information. Respect their\ndecision to conceal information, and ask before you release it. Consultation on these\nmatters will benefit the entire network and prevent you from having to retract\ninformation, negating several evenings of roleplay and a significant quantity of email.\n"

In a large game, players will possess most of the\nauthoritarian positions, so the characters that your team portrays are more likely to\nbe central plot devices or external authorities. Who handles these characters? Does\none person coordinate all of your Storyteller characters while the team portrays\nthem, or do you allow the individual team members to play the characters as they see\nfit? If your team is coordinated around a central authority, it is likely that that person\nwill determine these characters’ reactions to events in the game. If you have a\ndecentralized team, each character will grow in its own direction. However, it\nremains important for the team to remain in touch with the plot to determine the\nrequired eventualities of the characters’ actions.\nStoryteller characters are no more static than the players’ characters are. Most of the\nmembers of your team are likely to be portraying these characters in the chronicle from\ntime to time (or on an ongoing basis if necessary). The actions of the players’ characters\nwill affect each of the Storyteller characters differently. Treat each character as an\nindividual, just as you would portray the character if you were a player. As in real life,\nactions lead to repercussions, and there is no reason that a Storyteller character should\nnot react appropriately to a situation that challenges his own position. For example, if\nyou are portraying a Storyteller prince, and a vampire is caught breaching the Masquer-\nade, then you need to punish that character. To ignore the situation is to ignore one of\nthe conventions of the genre. Of course, the offending character may be able to swing\na deal to escape Final Death, but that’s all part of the in-character politics.\nSHIFTS\nHIFTS\nHIFTS\nHIFTS\nHIFTS I N\nI N\nI N\nI N\nI N T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E T\n T T\n T TE A M\nE A M\nE A M\nE A M\nE A M\nEventually, one of your team members will become tired, jaded or just plain\nburned out as a Storyteller.

If so, you need to let the players\nknow this in advance. Avoid disappointing those players who turn up expecting to\nbe able to play their own characters.\nIf people want to play their own characters, and you are prepared to allow them\nto do so, they should be prepared to present them to your Storyteller team prior to\nthe event. If you have foreknowledge of the characters that are going to be in\nattendance and you have some basic information about their backgrounds and\ndriving goals, then you can tailor plots or sub-plots to suit.\nYou won’t have time on the night of the game itself for your team to be vetting\ncharacters. You’re expecting several hundred people to walk past your registration desk,\neach with a dozen questions. You won’t have time to be sifting through their hand-written\nnotes wondering how they learned out-of-clan Thaumaturgy or whether the item card for\ntheir six-Trait broadsword is valid according to Laws of the… which book was it in?\nGather the players’ character information as soon as possible so that you can get a feel\nfor what sort of event you have looming before you. If you are part of a network, you’re more\nlikely to be familiar with the characters you see posting on the network’s email lists, or you\ncan deal easily with their Storytellers if you have any questions about the character or player.\nIf you throw wide the doors to your convention game, you’re in for a wild ride, and you\nwill need to seriously consider how to handle the likely interactions that will occur at the\nevent. The characters may have come from wildly disparate game types, and their character\nhistories might clash. The Camarilla might still recognize the Gangrel as a member clan\nin one player’s game. Another might have a different Brujah justicar. Red Star or no Red\nStar? If your game’s planned story differs significantly from the World of Darkness metaplot,\nthen be sure that you let the players know as much before they start playing.\nWeigh up all the character submissions in terms of game balance. If something sticks out\nlike a sore thumb as not belonging, contact the player to discuss the matter. Don’t be afraid\nto decline the character if it is likely to be detrimental to the game. The player may be willing\nto negotiate some fine points of the character to bring it more in line with your vision. You\nmight find it useful to contact the player’s Storyteller to verify details of the character.\nEven for an event that allows existing characters to attend, your team should\ncreate a number of pre-generated characters for players who turn up short a sheet.\nThese characters need not be mainstream or headlining characters. You may not\nknow how many people to expect at the convention. Start with 30 spare sheets, and\nkeep a few blanks handy for emergencies.\nGive your pre-gens more than just Traits. Create goals, plots and interaction\nhooks so that the player has a kick-start into the game. You don’t want to get bogged\ndown in character creation and approval when you should be running the game or\nportraying a plot-critical Storyteller character entrance. You certainly don’t want to\nspend the rest of the evening answering, “So what was my motivation in this scene?”\nDon’t be tempted into creating a stack of eighth-generation powerhouses. The World\nof Darkness focuses more closely on the underlings of the various species. Create ghouls, high-\ngeneration vampires, fosterns and adren. Resist the urge to scatter the sheets with extra Traits\nunless that character’s age, history or experience absolutely demands it. A starting-level\nneonate can have as much, if not more, roleplaying potential than a brooding but static elder\nvampire, and a player is more likely to play such a character believably.

You have too many people to deal with and too few staff to be policing the\ngame constantly, and you will have no time to deal with cheese-heads, whiners, gun-\nbunnies or whatever you want to call them. Make it a “one warning then you’re out”\nsituation. That said, deal with all such situations politely. Courtesy will not hurt the\nsituation, and it may defuse it before it escalates into a nasty situation. For example,\nif a character is about to start a combat in a game that you have stated will be politically\nbased, and that will result in a huge time bubble for dozens of players, check the\ncharacter’s motivations. If it’s inconsistent with the character’s general personality,\nadvise the player of the likelihood of disruption and ask him to reconsider the action.\nIf a player is in breach of the core rules of Mind’s Eye Theater, handle him as you\nwould any other player. Just because you’re at a convention does not mean that the\nrules of play or civility fly out the window. It’s easy for people to become a little over-\nexcited and make a few simple mistakes, but the core rules exist for a reason. When\npeople break said rules, you must deal with them firmly and immediately for the sake\nof the game.

With the expanded scope and scale of such organizations come a number of\nissues that will need to be addressed. Many of the concerns that large games or\nconventions need to address are equally applicable to networks, but such mega-\nchronicles have considerations all their own.\nCORE\nORE\nORE\nORE\nORE N\n N\n N\n N\n NETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK Q\n Q Q\n Q QUALITIES\nUALITIES\nUALITIES\nUALITIES\nUALITIES\nIn order for a network of chronicles to prosper and grow, three primary policies\nneed to be considered and developed.\nCOMMUNICATION\nOMMUNICATION\nOMMUNICATION\nOMMUNICATION\nOMMUNICATION\nNetworks need to establish systems of communication that will address the\nneeds of the organization adequately. While a few simple email lists will suffice for\na small local group of chronicles, when the network grows to encompass an\ninternational audience, the sheer daily volume of email can quickly grow to be\noverwhelming. Thousands of emails will pass between characters, either in private\nor on established lists. The administrative staff will likewise be in constant commu-\nnication as they develop systems and deal with situations as they arise.\nIndividual member chronicles will be responsible for monitoring local lists (those\nthat apply to their specific chronicle or geographic area of responsibility) and for\nmaking sure that the quality of information distributed to their players or characters\nis consistent with the network’s agreed rules and/ or genre. If it is not public knowledge\nthat the Assamites have lost their curse, then that information should not appear in\nthe network unless a justifiable reason exists for the character who releases that\ninformation to have discovered it. Of course, the Storyteller that permitted that\ncharacter to have that information will have checked with the administration as to\nwhether it would be appropriate for the character to know the facts in the first place.\nThe network will have policies in place to monitor and prevent the release of\nsuch genre-sensitive information, and contingencies planned for informing the\nnetwork of any falsely released “facts.” A simple fix for such situations is to require\nthe characters involved to have an appropriate level of Lore Ability in the specific\narea before they are permitted to speak of such issues.\nRegular information updates from chronicles to the administration staff are\nrequired in order to monitor the overall status of the organization. Such chronicle\nreports can serve to update the network on changes in Storyteller staff, plots or\nevents that may affect other chronicles, as well as any other matters that are of\nspecific relevance to the network. These updates allow the network staff to remain\nin touch with the member chronicle and deal with any issues as they arise.\nIn return, reports from the various appointed officials in the network will keep\nmember chronicles abreast of their opinions and actions, so that the whole can work\nas one.

Those who decide to transgress those accepted norms and\nwho disrupt the unity of the organization in so doing can expect to be likewise dismissed.\nIn a single chronicle, personal problems can be dealt with on an intimate level, but allowing\nthose personal issues to spill into the community in a network can be very disruptive. No longer\nare you dealing with a handful of people, you are presenting yourself to several hundred —\nperhaps several thousand — who will expect you to be civil and understanding of others’\nviewpoints. You sure as heck can’t please all of the people all of the time, however, and it’s\ngenerally considered polite to know when to bow out of a contentious issue and agree to disagree.\nWhen dealing with email through a network, the additional layer of “netiquette”\nmust be applied. Many of the folk who are familiar with email will already have\nexpectations of acceptable levels of behavior, and they will be quick to jump on those\nwho transgress.

Just as a Storyteller may vet the opinions of her players to\ntweak her chronicle to improve the growth and flow of the game, a network should\napproach the member chronicles for feedback on the development of the organization.\nThe process through which a network handles personal representation can be\nimmediate or filtered. A network may designate a single person to handle queries from\nplayers, or it may prefer that the queries be presented through the chronicle’s represen-\ntative to the administration.

Define the roles that are\nrequired and the duties that are attached to those roles. Decide what level of authority\nany specific role grants in regards to the network or to any individual chronicle.\nFor example, the network’s staff, as opposed to any specific chronicle or the\ncollective mass of chronicles, will monitor the movement of the justicars or other\nhigh-ranking elder vampires. It would be unfortunate if the Brujah justicar were\nkilled in one chronicle while dispensing justice in another on the other side of the\nworld! Likewise, the network staff would address issues of the continuity of the genre,\nsuch as monitoring the progression of the metaplot within the World of Darkness\nsupplements and ascertaining the impact of those plots on the chronicles in the\nnetwork. At any time, that information needs to be available to the chronicles that\nare interested in examining plots that involve those characters or situations.\nCan a tribal coordinator dictate tribal policy without sanction from the\nadministration? Can someone administering elder-level Storyteller characters over-\nride a Storyteller and insist on involvement in plots? Can someone coordinating a\njusticar at the network level insist that a chronicle submit a local archon character\nfor an investigation? What level of Storyteller veto is available in a given situation?\nDeciding on the roles and their authority early in the growth of the network will\nboth relieve future potential pressure and shape the face of the network.

During this period, is the member\nchronicle able to contribute to the administration of the network, or would you\nprefer that it familiarize itself first?\nIt is helpful to have an admissions team who can help new chronicles orient\nthemselves and fill them in on the history of the network. This team will also be\nconversant with the network’s rules, and it will be able to address any concerns that\nthe chronicle has in regards to those rules.\nWhat sort of criteria might you consider for chronicles that wish to join your\nnetwork? Will you consider newly formed games, or should they be well established?\nStability may be a major concern if you are not prepared to deal with fly-by-night\nchronicles that might not be around in six months. Could the network handle solo\ncharacters that play solely by email, or do you prefer players to be members of an\nestablished chronicle?

A network must be prepared for\nthese situations. Is a generic character based in a specific chronicle, or is it considered\nto be a part of the network as a whole? If the former is the case, are Experience Traits\nfrom chronicles that the character has visited viable, or should all Experience Traits\nbe awarded by a character’s “home” chronicle?

It is the moments of beauty created between players that mark your game\nas something special.

One of the best ways to combat this potential is to define your\ngame early and not be afraid to steer potential players toward similar concepts that fit\nwithin the game’s bounds of reason. If the game is set up as a standard grouping of\nCamarilla vampires in an Elysium-style game of politics, it usually doesn’t make sense\nif the representation of non-standard clans outnumbers the standard clans.\nEventually, though, you will receive your fifth application for a modern-day Bunyip\nor a Scathach Sidhe, and you will come to the point that every Storyteller dreads: telling\nthe player no. Take a moment to really analyze what the player is asking for. Frequently,\nplayers request to play a special kind of creature, but the character concept that the player\nhas in mind can work just as well in another, much more reasonable character type. Try\nto look at the application from the standpoint of helping the player realize his vision of\na character. Try to find out what that player really wants, then work with him to fit those\ngoals into the game. Make sure that you resist the urge to simply deny requests without\nmaking suggestions or offering an alternative. No matter how large the game gets, it still\nlives and breathes on the perceptions of the players. If the players feel that they will be\ndenied the opportunity to play what they want — or that the Storytellers are not\nconsidering their wishes — they will find another game.\nIf Storytellers aren’t careful, they may look around one night and realize that they\nhave a Camarilla game with almost no Camarilla clans in play, or a Garou game with\nmore Fera than Garou. There enters into the game a dichotomy that the players may\nnot be able to voice, but that they will notice. If the game is intended to be a gathering\nof the rare and unique, then it will likely go for some time without being a problem.\nHowever, there is a very real risk of becoming known as a game where anything goes.\nThe opposite is also true, though. Games that keep the levels of rare characters\nto very reasonable levels become known for their even-handed approach to\nportraying the World of Darkness. If players look around and see only one public\nvampire, who is obviously the odd man out, they will receive a very visible message\nthat your game takes the source material seriously and that you are going to use the\noddities of the setting to reinforce the normal.\nWhen deciding how many rare birds are too many, the Storyteller needs to\nexamine the expected attendance of his game. Making such a decision is rarely as\nsimple as setting a straight ratio of one abnormal character for every 20 normal ones;\nit’s more of a sliding scale. For a game of 20 or fewer members, one special approval\nmight be plenty. When the size of the game gets to 50, add in a second. At 75 or 100,\nmaybe one more. In general, you need to keep the special characters to less than 10%\nof the game’s population.\nWith larger games, that percentage should go down, not up, because you will\nnot have full attendance at every session in a large game. You will, however, get\nalmost full attendance from anyone who has spent the time and effort to play a rare\ncharacter type. This phenomenon will create the illusion that the ratio of rare\ncharacters to regular ones is far greater than it really is, because those odd ducks will\ntend to be the more active characters.\nBASIC\nASIC\nASIC\nASIC\nASIC C C C C CHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER A A A A APPROVAL\nPPROVAL\nPPROVAL\nPPROVAL\nPPROVAL\nThe largest crush on any new game is the initial work and time one must spend\non character approvals.

Decide your game’s\ntheme and mood, then set the limits of roughly how many rare characters will be allowed\nin at the start. Make sure that both the players and any other Storytellers who are helping\nunderstand the limits and expectations, and that they are prepared to adhere to them.\nSecond, try to complete the majority of your approvals as soon as possible. The\nlonger the task lingers, the less likely you are to be satisfied with the results. For any\ngame of 20 or more characters, the main Storyteller will likely want help from\nNarrators or assistants. Before everything gets busy, meet with any Storytellers you\nhave and spend some time going over the players’ backgrounds and character sheets.\nTurn the meeting into a planning session for your first game, setting aside anywhere\nfrom one night to one week to accomplish the initial planning.\nThird, have a character creation party for your group’s first meeting rather than\nan actual game. Invite as many of the players as you can, and invite them to discuss\ntheir characters’ connections to each other and to the game setting’s history. For\ninstance, are you having a Storyteller character portray the city’s prince and\nprimogen when the game starts, or are the players’ characters going to fill those roles?\nWill the players’ characters be encouraged to play a big role in the governance of the\ncity, or are they trying to bring down the powers that be? Whatever background\nyou’ve written for the setting, use this first gathering of the players as an opportunity\nto meet with them and generate ideas. Players’ characters who enter your game with\nconnections already in place have far more invested into the game than those players\nwho make a character with no pre-existing connections.\nFinally, allot your storytelling team approximately one week to go through all\nof the character sheets and backgrounds before the game. The more time you give\nyourself the better, but try to stick to the same schedule you will be using for games.\nIf you play every other week, then try to get it all ready within a two-week timeframe.\nDon’t let yourself procrastinate on these initial preparations, because it may infringe\non everyone’s enjoyment of playing the game.\nWhen reviewing the backgrounds and sheets, look for plot hooks that can be\nused in various stages of the game. Look for items, such as an Enemy, that can be\nexpanded to affect a sizeable portion of the game. Flaws and other hooks that you can\nshowcase will help draw the spotlighted characters into the chronicle. Players will\nrealize that the characters they’ve created have an impact on the world around them.\nIt is important for players to feel that their characters have significance within the\ngame, especially if you want them to keep coming back.\nOnce the game is underway, you will undoubtedly be asked to approve\ncharacters during game-play while you are trying to attend to other business. If you\nare faced with a player in need of immediate approval and you don’t have the time\nto examine the character sheet in depth, scan the character sheet for obvious abusive\npowers and fuzzy math. If the basics look all right, approve the character for the game.\nThen make sure to tell the player that although the character is approved for this\nsession, he will need to leave it with you at the end of the session so that you can\nexamine it in more detail before the next session. Typically, these steps are sufficient\nfor in-game approval, since they enable you to deal with more pressing game issues.\nUNLEVELING\nNLEVELING\nNLEVELING\nNLEVELING\nNLEVELING T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E P\n P\n P\n P\n PLAYING\nLAYING\nLAYING\nLAYING\nLAYING F F F F FIELD\nIELD\nIELD\nIELD\nIELD\nThe World of Darkness is rarely a level playing field.

To remedy that disparity, you can\nsimply start some of the characters off with more free Traits than others.\nAt the beginning of a chronicle, the Storyteller needs to decide if he will allow\nanyone to enter play with a more powerful character for the sake of the story. If so,\nthe Storyteller must then decide how he is going to pick who gets to play those more\npowerful characters. This decision is important because the players chosen for these\nmore potent characters must agree to not abuse the power given to them. The\nStorytellers need to keep an eye on the powerful characters and keep those players\ninformed about how they are doing, as well as what the chronicle needs from them.\nEstablishing the personal communications between Storyteller and player in these\nsituations can be a tremendous boon to the game’s flavor.\nOver time, the longer-running characters will accumulate power in ways that\nmake raw statistics irrelevant. As time goes on then, the characters will redistribute the\npower according to the way they roleplay. This approach works best in games that focus\non Laws of the Wild or The Shining Host, since both of those settings have mutable\nin-game hierarchies through which the players’ characters can rise. Being an Elder\nGarou is much more impressive if the character began as a cub and earned the renown\nfor the higher rank through hard experience. In this system, the Storyteller usually has\nto use Storyteller characters to fill in leadership roles that the players’ characters do not\nmeet, then phase those Storyteller characters out as the players’ characters increase in\npower. Vampire games rarely manage to benefit from this approach simply because one\nof its main indicators of power — Generation — is not something that a character\ngenerally earns through play. The problem here is that it does take time for this\napproach to pay off. It can sometimes be a year or more of play before the players’\ncharacters are truly ready to take over the full spectrum of a chronicle’s key characters.\nIf and when you make the decision to make some starting characters in your\nchronicle more equal than others, your sense of fair play (or the players themselves) will\ndemand that you not make the concomitant decision arbitrarily. The following three\nmethods will help you choose which characters to boost or reward as the chronicle begins.\nLOTTERY\nOTTERY\nOTTERY\nOTTERY\nOTTERY\nIf you throw a character creation party before your chronicle’s first session, you\nmight offer your players the chance to participate in a lottery-style drawing. Prepare\na deck of index cards before the party by writing a small bonus award on each and\nshuffling the deck. These awards can range from an extra three to five free Traits to an\nextra level of one Influence to one free Basic level of an out-of-category supernatural\npower of that character’s creature type. Hold this drawing only once, and use it as an\nincentive to attend the pre-chronicle character creation party. This method is the\nmost arbitrary and random of the three, but it remains fair for everyone involved.\nAUDITIONS\nUDITIONS\nUDITIONS\nUDITIONS\nUDITIONS\nIn chronicles in which the size and scope are still limited to approximately a dozen\nclose cities and well under a thousand members, you might hold auditions for key parts\nand more powerful characters. Through the audition system, a Storyteller or a team of\nStorytellers interviews the players for the privilege of playing rare or more powerful\ncharacters. The dangers of this system are obvious — favoritism and workload.\nFavoritism is a frequent problem, no matter what system you use, but it is a particularly\nserious drawback to the audition method. To minimize this potential abuse of power,\nit is recommended that auditions not rely on a single Storyteller but on a team.\n"

This system allows its Storytellers\n(past and present) to come into play with more powerful characters once they become\nregular players themselves. The system might also benefit people who take on other\nactivities that the group wants to emphasize. Storytellers can award extra Experience\nTraits for record-keeping work or for tracking the group’s funds and site fees.\nThe principal danger in this reward method becomes apparent when those players\nwho are doing the work are doing it simply to get a more powerful character rather than\nlooking after the health of the chronicle. Such players will make themselves readily\napparent, however, so spotting them shouldn’t be particularly difficult.\nBALANCING\nALANCING\nALANCING\nALANCING\nALANCING THE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE S S S S SCALES\nCALES\nCALES\nCALES\nCALES\nAs the chronicle matures, characters will die off and be replaced by new ones.\nWhen the chronicle isn’t expected to last any longer than a year, or if it’s confined to\na single group, this fact of life might not present an issue. In larger chronicles, however,\nit can become a real hurdle. When a new player looks at the chronicle from the outside,\nthe chronicle can appear to be a daunting and dangerous setting in which he will be\noverwhelmed by existing characters and plots. The successful chronicle will develop\nways to bring those new players into the fold and help them cope with the opportunities\npresented in such a grand endeavor. Some suggestions follow on doing just that.\nMENTORING\nENTORING\nENTORING\nENTORING\nENTORING\nEvery chronicle has its experts and experienced members. It is a good idea to\nidentify those players who enjoy helping out the new players and who are willing to\nspend some extra time with someone who is still unfamiliar with the game and\nsystem. Building an established network of mentors and then systematically linking\nnew members to them will have lasting positive effects on the chronicle.\nMentors can help with all aspects of integration. They offer newcomers a\nmethod to learn about the ways in which the organization operates, and they keep\nnewcomers from feeling overwhelmed by the systems that keep such a large game\nrunning smoothly. During the game itself, mentors help newcomers find an in-game\nniche and establish the in-game contacts that will allow them to excel. In both\narenas, a well-done mentoring system can have a dramatically beneficial effect.\nIn Laws of the Night chronicles, for instance, a large number of subordinate\ncharacters (such as ghouls and mortal retainers) typically make up the entourage of the\ndead. In Laws of the Wild games, kinfolk and cubs are a great place to start out, because\nthey tend to be sheltered by the older characters by their very nature. Any character who\nis attached to another in a way that removes the need to take a lot of independent action\n— but which still allows the player to be around the action — is a good place to start.\nSETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING S S S S STORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nA variant on the mentoring approach is to assign a set of Storytellers to each\ndeal with and track smaller portions of the ongoing chronicle. The Setting Storytell-\ners are responsible for maintaining a top-down view of their portion of the game and\nhelping any new members who interested in that part fit in. Therefore, as a new\ncharacter enters the game, he can check in with a Setting Storyteller and look for\nkey links that establish the character in the setting’s history.\n"

Unfortunately, the vast majority of these hooks will\nbe ignored unless the Storyteller actively uses them against the players’ characters.\nTherefore, your game may find it very useful to pick one Storyteller to be the\nConsequences Storyteller.\nThis person reads through the players’ character sheets and brings to life the plots\nand problems that the players have already written for their characters. Obviously, no\none can do so effectively for every character in a very large game, but it can be very\neffective to pick perhaps five characters a month and make a point of focusing on those\ncharacters throughout that month. If the Consequences Storyteller times his activities\ncorrectly, these characters will be ones who are not otherwise engaged in the game\nthrough more conventional plots and activities, and this can serve as a way to keep\ncharacters involved who would otherwise be watching the action from the sidelines.\nABILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND B B B B BACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nABILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES\nACADEMICS\nCADEMICS\nCADEMICS\nCADEMICS\nCADEMICS\nYou possess a level of education and general knowledge beyond rudimentary\nschooling.

Each level of this Ability removes one\npenalty Trait. Additionally, you can expend a level of Blindfighting to avoid having to\nretest after each successful challenge in a single turn because of darkness.

You can fashion works of art by studying Painting,\nDrawing or similar physical media. The Crafts Ability also covers more technical\nskills, such as Mechanics and Electronics.\nMaking or repairing an item with Crafts usually involves a Physical Challenge of your\ndexterity, for which the Storyteller sets the difficulty based on the type of job.

The difficulty equals the total Mental Traits of the individual who set the\nexplosive. If you do not possess this Ability, you cannot use or disarm explosives at\nall. Similarly, Demolition does not help you aim a thrown bomb or grenade. It simply\nallows you to build, arm and disarm explosive devices.\nNote that the use of explosives in games should be regulated strictly.

Each type\nof Lore is considered to be a separate Ability, so a character could have Camarilla Lore\nx4 and Sabbat Lore x4 without exceeding the maximum level.\nLore is not meant to restrict what information a character can remember about\nwhat he is told in a game. A few bits of information hardly constitutes as lore of the\nsubject (or a valid reason to learn the Lore Ability), even if the information passed\nincludes secrets known only to those with high levels in the Ability. Lore is meant\nto allow characters to know certain important pieces of information from the World\nof Darkness sourcebooks, such as the history of the Silver Fangs or the natural\nweaknesses of changelings.\nOne level of Lore represents a more-than-passing knowledge of the subject, and\nit is the lowest level of understanding that requires Lore to back it up. The character\ncan cite basic, widely known concepts within the lore’s area, such as the Escheat (for\nChangeling Lore) or the Litany (for Garou Lore).\nA second level of Lore represents a higher-than-basic understanding of the subject\nin question. At this level, the character has heard of a few bloodlines, special societies\nor other low-level secrets from within, but he has no expansive knowledge of them.\nHaving three levels of Lore represents a specialized study in the particular\nsubject. This level is generally more common to the leaders and powerful political\nfigures within the subject lore’s area. The character becomes more familiar with the\nworkings of many secret societies, and can probably name a few members. The\ncharacter understands higher-level politics better at this level, as well as some of the\ntruth behind the whispered secrets.\nThose who attain four levels in a Lore are aware of the goals and the movements\nof most of the secret factions within the lore’s area. Their knowledge of the subject’s\nsecrets lays bare the truths to which the elders and ancient texts only allude. Lore at\nthis level and higher represents many elements specific to your chronicle, so work\nclosely with your Storyteller to get the information.\nHaving five levels of Lore represents the pinnacle of understanding. You can\noften expound upon ancient historical texts as though you’d been present at the time\nin question.

By choosing a specialization in an Ability, you hone your skills\nwith a particular facet of that talent.\nAbility specializations are wholly optional.

Who should\nhave access to the higher levels? How should it be taught?\nA character can attain a single level of a Lore in just a few months of diligent\nstudy. Learning the second level is more substantial task that requires at least a\nyear of study and training. It is effectively the highest level that one can learn in\nthe course of a live-action chronicle unless the Storyteller does not follow a real-\ntime timeline, and he allows years to pass in the game world between sessions.\nOne attains the third level in a Lore through in-depth study for a decade or more.\nThe fourth level is available only to those who have made it a lifelong study, as\nat least a lifetime is required to attain such a level of scholarly understanding. It\nis effectively the highest level that non-immortal characters can achieve without\nsome means of greatly extending their life span. Attaining the fifth level in a Lore\nis extremely difficult. Those who have achieved this level of expertise have spent\nseveral lifetimes or more in pursuit of knowledge pertaining to the subject.\nTherefore, the fifth level is only truly available to immortal or undead creatures.\nFor the Storyteller, laying down restrictions on the types of Lore available\nto characters becomes more important the larger her game gets. She may wish\nto restrict the number of characters that have access to high levels, or she may\nrestrict out-of-setting Lores. (For instance, a Storyteller in a Shining Host\nchronicle might not allow her players to buy Wraith Lore.) Talk to your\nStoryteller to see what levels and types of Lores she will let you start with.\nAfter character creation, characters must be taught Lore in order to gain more\nlevels in it. Simple observation of the subject can hardly justify learning levels of\nthe Ability. Since it is difficult for one person to teach someone the entirety of her\nknowledge on a subject (especially in an unbiased manner), a character must learn\nLore levels beyond the first from multiple teachers. The number of teachers\nrequired is equal to the level of Lore being learned, and each teacher must have that\nlevel of Lore to be able to teach it. For example, in a game where the Storyteller\nadvances the story line by 50 years or so between games, a character could learn\nBrujah Lore to level four in “downtime” if he had four teachers that each had four\nlevels of that Lore. At your Storytellers discretion, Lore can be learned from tomes\nand texts, but such a source should never count as being more than a single level,\nregardless of how many ancient libraries the character sifts through.\n"

You also can never gain more than one bonus Trait at a time\nfrom specializations, even if more than one would be appropriate to a given challenge.\nThat is, even if you have Medicine: Physiology and Science: Biology Research, you get only\na one-Trait bonus on a test of biochemistry, despite your multiple specializations.\nA specialization is a fairly narrow area of research or practice. You cannot, for instance,\ntake a Firearms specialization in “guns,” nor could you have an Occult specialization of\n“writing.” An appropriate specialization refers to one small class of items or to one type of\npractice within the Ability, such as Firearms: Antique Pistols or Occult: Superstitions.\nYou may take a specialization in an Ability with an area of study. In such a case,\nyou concentrate your research in one particular facet of that sub-Ability, or in one\napplication of it. Therefore, you could have Crafts: Woodworking with a specializa-\ntion in Hidden Panels, or Science: Botany with a specialization in Exotic Flora.\nNote that the bonus Trait from a specialization does not have an adjective,\nand it is not bid or used like other Traits. You simply are one Trait up on\nchallenges within the specialization.\nExample: Marcus von Schlagenhanz is an experienced fighter, but he is especially good\nwith fencing weapons. He has Melee x3 with a specialization in fencing. When Marcus engages\na foe in combat, he normally uses his 11 Physical Traits. With a fencing blade, however, he has\n12 Physical Traits because of his intense training. Of course, if he gets tired out or wounded (after\nlosing several challenges), he may not have as many Traits, but as long as he has at least one level\nof his Melee Ability left, he gets to add the one bonus Trait to his remaining Physical Trait total.\nBACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nYour character’s Backgrounds help flesh out his ties with mundane human\nagencies, as well as reflecting beneficial elements of your character’s history.

Although your allies may not be aware of your supernatural nature\n(if you have any), they can be quite useful if you direct them properly.\nIn general, your allies do not appear during game-play. Instead, you can use\nthem for certain services between play sessions, by notifying your Storyteller.\nAn ally can be directed to follow up on research or activities that you have\nstarted.

When you call on your contacts, you make a few phone calls, check\nwith likely snitches and grease a few palms. In return, you get rumors and informa-\ntion. Doing so lets you find out exactly what’s going on in the city within a particular\narea. You can get information of a level equal to however many contacts you use.

The Storyteller will\ncertainly make the effects of your Fame apparent, and people may take notice of you\nat bothersome times.

You must engage in a Simple Test\nwhen you call on your mentor. If you succeed, your mentor deigns to aid you. If you tie, your\nmentor grants you assistance, but he requires something in return. If you fail, your mentor\ndemands the favor first before helping. In any case, you can call on your mentor only once in\nany given game session, and only if you have an appropriate way to contact him or her.\nThe level of aid that your mentor can give depends on the number of Traits you\nhave in this Background (and Storyteller approval, of course):\n• For one Trait, your mentor is privy to a single piece of specialized information\nat a level above your own. If you have Wraith Lore x2, for instance, your mentor can\nbe called on to gift you with one piece of information from Wraith Lore x3.\n• For two Traits, you can borrow one level of Contacts, Influence, Resources or\nStatus from your mentor for the duration of the game. If your mentor is very powerful\n(four or five Traits), you can borrow two levels.\n• Having two Traits allows your mentor to instruct you in a Basic power that\nyou do not know.\n• For three Traits, your mentor can instruct you in an Intermediate power that\nyou do not know.\n• Also at a cost of three Traits, your mentor can train you in the ways of a special\nHobby/ Professional/ Expert Ability that is outside your normal ken, such as Mage Lore.\n• For four Traits, your mentor can train you in an Advanced power beyond your grasp.\n• For five Traits, your mentor can train you in the phenomenal powers of the\nelders, if you are puissant enough to learn such secrets.\nSince mentors can prove unbalancing by providing too many different powers\nover the course of a long game, the Storyteller may lower your total Mentor Traits\nas you call on his knowledge.

Being descriptive when reporting the results of Influence\nendeavors to the players is critical. Otherwise the interactions of Influences in a city\nwill degrade into a sub-game of number-crunching, in which no story is being told\nat all. Much of the burden of this task falls upon the shoulders of the players\nthemselves. When a player wishes to perform an endeavor, the Storyteller should\nhave her give him a write-up of the activity, complete with a description of exactly\nhow her Influences are going about executing the desired task. Examples of\ndescriptive use of Influence are given with each new endeavor type.\nPOSSESSING\nOSSESSING\nOSSESSING\nOSSESSING\nOSSESSING A N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D U\n U\n U\n U\n USING\nSING\nSING\nSING\nSING I I I I INFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nYou cannot manage more Influence than the sum of your permanent Physical,\nSocial and Mental Traits. This limit counts against all of your total Influence —\nyour combined levels cannot exceed this total. After all, there are only so many\nthings you can do in a day.\nWhen you exercise Influence, you expend temporary Influence Traits. The tables for\nvarious Influence areas detail what you can do with a specific number of Traits. Performing\nan endeavor requires a number of Traits equal to the level of the action. Therefore, with\nhigh levels of Influence, you can perform many small actions or a few significant ones. To\nperform the new Influence endeavors presented here (such as Attack, Grow and Watch),\nyou must spend Traits just as you would for endeavors on the traditional charts.\nCertain levels of Influence gift you with items, money or aides. Unlike the\nResources Background, money and equipment garnered with Influence does not come\nautomatically each month. If you want a steady income from Influence, you must direct\nyour Influence in that direction continually, and this income does not come with any\nassociated trappings of wealth. (You’d have to buy a house and car separately, for\ninstance.) Aides garnered with Influence generally help for only one specific task, and\nthey usually have the equivalent of only one level of Ability in their area of skill. For\nmore competent and readily available help, take the Allies Background.\nMost cities have only a set amount of Influence in various areas. For instance,\nAtlanta has a great deal of Transportation Influence, while Hollywood would have a lot\nof High Society and Media Influence. A Rust-Belt city in which manufacturing and\nheavy industry has all but disappeared would have very little to no Industry Influence.\nStorytellers should map out the total amount of each type of Influence to be had in\nthe city setting. Once all of the Influence of a given type is used up, the only way to get more\nis to use existing Influence to grow that area of society (making new projects or sponsoring\ninvestment) or to destroy someone else’s Influence and free up those resources. Also, each\ncity may have different reflections of the Influences listed here. A city with a thriving\nindependent film community is going to have a different picture of Media or High Society\nInfluence than a city in which the arts are being literally starved out due to budget cuts.\nBureaucracy\nYou can manage various government agencies and bureaus. By dealing with social\nprograms and public servants, you can spin red tape, bypass rules and regulations or twist\nbureaucratic regimentation to your advantage. Bureaucracy is useful in operating or\nshutting down businesses, faking or acquiring permits and identification papers and\nmanipulating public utilities and facilities. Government clerks at the city and county level,\nutility workers, road crews, surveyors and other civil servants are potential contacts or allies.\n"

Traits banked for Growth are lost as well, even if they would have\ngiven the victim a new, higher level Influence at the beginning of the next month.\nMechanics Example: Scott and Wade both have Media Influence, at levels five\nand two respectively. Scott Traced Wade’s Influence successfully last month, and he\ndesires to make an Attack upon it this month. He spends four Traits on the endeavor,\nmeaning that the Attack’s level is four. Since the level of Scott’s Attack is greater than\nthe level of Wade’s Media Influence, Wade will only have a level-one Media to work\nwith next month. If Wade had been spending Traits for Growth, and had accumulated\nthree or more, he would immediately apply three of them to bring it back to level two.\nDescriptive Example: When Scott made his character, he decided that his Media Influence\nwould be represented by his control over various media moguls through Blood Bonding and the use\nof Dominate. To Attack Wade’s Influence, Scott performed the necessary prerequisite of\nsucceeding in a Trace on it. Having done so, Scott discovered that Wade’s Media Influence was\nrepresented by his control over one of the city’s major newspapers. When writing an explanation\nof the Attack endeavor for the Storyteller, Scott describes influencing his media mogul thralls to have\ntheir networks broadcast a television news story about Wade’s newspaper. The television news story\nhighlights the paper’s “long history of poorly researched news articles” and describes a number of\nincidents in which the paper was forced to print retractions. The television news story goes on to rate\nthe various other papers in the city, giving them a far more favorable rating than Wade’s paper.\nWhen the Storyteller looks at the Influence numbers and decides that Scott’s Attack is successful,\nhe informs both Scott and Wade of the resulting decline in the paper’s circulation, which represents\nWade’s Media Influence dropping to level one at the beginning of the next month.\nBlock\nYou can use your Influence to prevent Influence endeavors from taking place for\nthat month. Any action from the other sourcebooks may be blocked, provided that\nyour Influence level is at least equal to the endeavor’s level on the chart. The Block’s\neffective level is the total number actions spent toward it. A Block will affect all\nattempts at the selected endeavor during that month; anyone attempting the Blocked\naction in the city will not succeed unless they have added enough levels of Boost to the\nendeavor. Multiple Blocks against the same endeavor type are not cumulative in effect.\nIf more than one Block is put in place on the same endeavor, use only the highest level\nwhen calculating the success of those attempting the endeavor.\nMechanics Example: Jana has four levels of Legal Influence. Because she is\ncapable of arranging a parole, she is therefore able to put a Block on that endeavor\ntype as well. She decides to spend two of her Legal Influence Traits to create a level\ntwo Block. Anyone wishing to arrange a parole in the city that month must spend\ntwo or more additional Influence Traits into Boost in order to be successful.\nDescriptive Example: When Jana made her character, she decided that an extensive\nnetwork of judges, lawyers and corrections facility officials who are accepting bribes from\nher would represent her Legal Influence. Now that one of Jana’s character’s enemies has\njust been arrested, she doesn’t want anyone to arrange for his parole. When writing an\nexplanation of the Block endeavor for the Storyteller, Jana describes bribing members of the\nparole board to stop proceedings, or at least delay them until the end of the month.\nBoost\nBoost is simply a term used to describe spending additional unneeded Influence\nTraits to perform an endeavor, just in case someone has put up a Block that needs\nto be overcome. If the Traits spent into Boost equal the level of the Block, the action\nis successful. The Block does not go away if one action beats it, though. It can still\nbe effective against any additional attempts at that endeavor in that month.\n"

Sue attempts to acquire a Blood Trait using\na Trait of her level-four Health Influence. When the Storyteller informs her that she\nis not successful because of a Block, Sue tries it again, this time adding her last two\nTraits into Boost, thereby raising the cost of her second attempt to three Health\nInfluence Traits. Since the level of the Boost is at least equal to the level of the Block,\nSue is successful, and she acquires the Blood Trait.\nDescriptive Example: When Sue made her character, she decided that ownership of\na small, private clinic would represent her Health Influence. She uses her clout to have a\nsmall amount of blood delivered to her while she is off-site. She finds out that there is a major\nshortage of blood in the city and that her request for whole blood isn’t prioritized highly\nenough to acquire it (thanks to Mathew’s Block). Sue’s second attempt is backed by an\nurgent request from two of her clinic’s doctors, who falsely claim to need the whole blood\nfor an emergency surgery. This time, the request is granted.\nCombine\nCombine allows you to aid the Influence endeavor of another character. No action\non the Mind’s Eye Theatre sourcebook charts can be attempted by a character who doesn’t\nhave the required Influence level according to that chart. For every two Traits that you\nspend on Combine, the character you are helping gains one action to use toward his\nendeavor. Influence borrowed through the Allies and Mentor Backgrounds are also subject\nto this rule. A character can spend no more than 20 Traits toward a single endeavor in any\ngiven month, including all actions spent for modifications such as Combine.\nMechanics Example: Corey has four levels of Political Influence. He wants to enact\nsome minor legislation in the city, which would cost him all four of his Political Influence\nTraits for the month. Corey has already used a Political Influence Trait this month, so he\ndoesn’t have enough. He asks a friend to Combine her Political Influence with his. Cynthia\nhas only two levels, but she loans them both to Corey. Since the number of Traits loaned\nis effectively halved when using Combine, Corey nets only one extra Political Influence\nTrait for the month, but that’s all he needs to enact the minor legislation.\nDescriptive Example: When Corey made his character, he decided that blood bonding the\ncity’s mayor would represent his Political Influence. Since he’d already had the mayor ask the city\ncouncil for a small favor this month, he knows that getting him to push for the minor legislation would\nbe straining the mayor’s authority. Corey asks his ally Cynthia to help him with the endeavor, using\nCombine. Cynthia manipulates a member of the city council through regular uses of Dominate,\nand she has this council member propose the minor legislation. With the issue on the table, the mayor\ncan throw his full support into it without burdening his relationship with the council.\nConceal\nConceal can be used to hide your Influence from uses of Trace. The number of\nactions spent toward Conceal generates that month’s Conceal level, which you pit\nagainst attempts to Trace it.\nMechanics Example: Jess has heard a rumor that Tim is going to Trace his\nUniversity Influence. He spends all four of his University Traits to generate a level-\nfour Conceal over them. For three months in a row, he continues to spend his four\nTraits on Conceal. On the fourth month, Jess hopes that Tim has lost interest in his\nUniversity Influence, and goes back to using it for Growth.\nDescriptive Example: When Jess created his character, he decided that his University\nInfluence would be represented by the sway he has gained by providing major contributions to\nthe local universities in the past few years. Now that he fears that Tim will be able to follow the\npaper trail of his donations (Tim’s Trace), Jess quickly uses his clout to convince the universities\nthat the records of his donations and other dealings should be suppressed for the time being.\n"

To employ this special endeavor, assign a number of Traits as the\nlevel of the defense. The level of any Attacks directed at that Influence must exceed\nthe Defend level plus the level of your Influence in order to be successful.\nMechanics Example: Eric fears that someone is going to attack his Underworld\nInfluence this month, so he puts up a defense to protect it. He assigns three of his four\nUnderworld Traits to the defense. An incoming Attack must now be level eight or\nhigher to affect his Influence.\nDescriptive Example: When Eric made his character, he decided that his Under-\nworld Influence would be represented by his control of the Lasciano Family, a major\norganized crime syndicate.

To use Follow, assign a number of Traits to\nestablish the level of the endeavor. The Follow endeavor will reveal all activities performed\nby the targeted Influence, less any activities hidden with an equal or higher level of Stealth.\nMechanics Example: Jean successfully used her level-three Occult Influence to\nperform a Trace on Toby’s Occult Influence several months ago. This month, Jean\nis curious as to what Toby is up to, so she spends all three Traits of Occult Influence\nto Follow Toby’s Occult activities. She finds out that Toby attempted to acquire a\nminor magical item. If Toby had put three or more levels of Stealth on that endeavor,\nJean would not have been able to detect it.\nDescriptive Example: When creating her character, Jean decided that her level-three\nOccult Influence would be represented by her hold over a couple of millennium cults dedicated\nto the research of mystical writings and prophecies. With the successful Trace, Jean discovered\nthat Toby’s Occult Influence is represented by his sway over an organized group of “psychics”\nwhose clientele are powerful and wealthy VIPs in the city. When Jean writes down her Influence\nactivities for the Storyteller, she describes how she will have the leaders of her cults direct their\nfollowers to research groups of “psychics” in the city, specifically the group that Toby controls.\nGrowth\nTo raise one of your Influences to the next level, you must spend a number of\nTraits equal to three times your current level. In general, you can gain a new level in\nan Influence once every three months, provided you are using your Influence for\nnothing else. Unlike other endeavors, Traits spent for Growth can be banked from\nmonth to month. When you bank Traits thus, they accumulate until you reach the\nnumber required for an increase. If you meet the number of Traits required to increase\nto the next level, the Influence level improves by one at the end of the month.\nMechanics Example: Cheyana has three levels of Street Influence, meaning she\nwould need nine Traits spent to get to level four. In one month, she spends two of\nher three Traits on Growth (two banked). In the next month, she spends two more\nTraits on Growth (four banked). In the month following that, she spends all three\nTraits on Growth (seven banked). In the fourth month, Cheyana spends two more\nTraits on Growth, meeting the requirement to achieve level four. At the end of the\nmonth, her Street Influence improves by one. Cheyana could have grown her Street\nInfluence a little faster if she had spent all of her actions on Growth each month.\n"

When writing a description of her Growth activities for the Storyteller, Cheyana describes\nencouraging her contacts in several gangs to push for mergers with other gangs across the city. The\nnext month, she describes organizing the homeless people into small “communities” for safer living,\nwhich draws more homeless people into the area to spy for her. The month following, Cheyana\ndescribes convincing the prostitutes that sometimes report to her to recruit more prostitutes to her\ncause. In the fourth month, she describes working with the gangs again to direct their spare time\ntoward more high-profit activities such as the buying and selling of guns and other contraband. Now\nthat Cheyana has strengthened her contacts enough to warrant an increase in her Influence, the\nStoryteller agrees to raise her Street to level four at the end of the month.\nStealth\nStealth is added to endeavors to counter the use of Follow and Watch. If the\nnumber of Traits spent to add Stealth to an endeavor equals or exceeds the level of the\nFollow or Watch, the endeavor is remains undetected. Stealth can be applied to any\nof the actions on the charts, as well as to Attack, Block, Follow, Growth or Watch.\nMechanics Example: Donny wishes to use his Finance Influence to raise the capital\nto purchase a small business. Doing so would normally only require two of his five Finance\nInfluence Traits, but because Donny doesn’t want anyone else to know what he’s up to,\nhe throws in the other three Traits for Stealth. If someone had instituted a Watch of level\nthree or less to notice that activity in the city, she would not detect Donny’s sneaky\nacquisition of the capital. If the observer had put up a Watch of level four or higher,\nDonny’s stealth would not have hidden him from her prying eyes.\nDescriptive Example: When Donny made his character, he decided to have his\nFinance Influence be represented by his controlling interest in a large acquisitions company.\nWhen writing out his Influence activities for the Storyteller, Donny describes the added\nStealth as using a large network of dummy corporations through which to move the money\nso that it could not be tracked back to him through his acquisitions company.\nTrace\nYou can use this endeavor to establish the identity of a character whose Influence\nyou have come into contact with. You cannot simply guess that a character has an\nInfluence in a particular category and then attempt to Trace it. You must first have come\ninto contact with it in one of the several ways. This can be accomplished by suffering an\nAttack from the target’s Influence, by noticing one of the target’s endeavors with the use\nof Watch, by stopping one of the target’s endeavors with a Block, or by having one your\nown endeavors stopped by the target’s use of Block. Additionally, if someone ever loans\nyou Influence Traits with Combine, you can Trace them. Finally, if the target ever tells\nyou in great detail about his Influence (i.e., agrees to let you Trace it), you can perform\nthe Trace. The total actions spent on the Trace define its level. If the level of this Trace\nexceeds the highest level of Conceal or Stealth put up to guard the Influence that month,\nthe Trace is successful. Success tells you the Influence owner’s identity, and whether their\nInfluence level is higher than your own or not. It also gives you a general description of\nthe Influence and the ability to spend Traits to Attack it.\nUsing Trace is specific to one city. Therefore, if a character has Influence of the same\ntype in more than one city, your Trace only tells you about the Influence in the city you\nare searching. If you have succeeded in a Trace on an Influence, you may not simply relay\nthat information to someone else for his or her Influence to make an Attack on. The\ninformation is too complex for them to relay to their own Influence contacts without them\nactually performing a Trace themselves. If you have performed a successful Trace, you can\nrelay enough information for someone else to perform a Trace with his or her own Influence.\n"

Recently her\nattempt to access confiscated weapons was stopped by Carl’s level-two Block.\nHaving established contact, Pauline decides to Trace the influence. The next\nmonth, she spends all four Traits to Trace. Carl, who has level-five Police\nInfluence, is spending two Traits to Block again this month, and because he fears\nothers will Trace him, he puts his remaining three Traits into Conceal. As the\nlevel of Pauline’s Trace more than equals the level of Carl’s Conceal, Pauline\ndiscovers that the Influence that blocked her endeavor last month belongs to Carl.\nShe discovers its general description (defined by Carl when he created his\ncharacter) and that its level is higher than hers.\nDescriptive Example: When Pauline made her character, she decided that her bribery\nand blackmail of the members of the local precinct would represent her Police Influence. To make\na Trace, Pauline writes up her Influences activities for the Storyteller as simply having every one\nof her contacts poke around until they discover who tightened the security on the confiscated\nweapons lock-up. After all, the police are supposed to be practiced investigators, right?\nWatch\nYou use Watch when you want to notice a certain Influence action in a city from\nthe chart listed in the sourcebooks. Your Influence must be of sufficient level to\nperform that action before you can Watch it. A Watch will let you know when and\nhow often the action is attempted in the city for that month, and you will even\ndiscover uses of the action that occurred earlier in the same month before the Watch\nwas instituted. The total number of Traits spent on the Watch define its level. You\ncan also use Watch to look for the following endeavors: Attack, Block, Follow (only\nthose targeted at you), Growth and Watch.\nMechanics Example: Mark decides to spend one of his five Church Influence\nTraits into a Watch this month. He decides to Watch for individuals attempting to\ncontact church-associated hunter groups. Because Mark is paranoid, he decides to\nput up a level-two Watch on the Watch activity to see if anyone else is doing the\nsame thing. Mark’s Watch for individuals attempting to contact church-associated\nhunter groups doesn’t get him anything. His second Watch (the one on the Watch\nendeavor) notices his own Watch of course, and discovers that someone has put up\na Watch to notice anyone attempting to peruse general church records.\nDescriptive Example: Mark decided when he created his character to have his\nChurch Influence be represented by an extensive network of blackmail against highly placed\nmembers of the local churches. When writing up his activities for the Storyteller, Mark\ndescribes how his blackmailed network of priests, deacons and elders are going on “crusades”\nwithin their various churches to discover any corrupting Influences that might be at work.\nThey are using their authority to persuade other impressionable church members to report\nany suspicious activities or requests to them immediately.\nWH E N\nH E N\nH E N\nH E N\nH E N T O\nT O\nT O\nT O\nT O R\n R R\n R RESOLVE\nESOLVE\nESOLVE\nESOLVE\nESOLVE A A A A ACTIONS\nCTIONS\nCTIONS\nCTIONS\nCTIONS\nFor the purpose of these rules, Influence Traits spent on endeavors return at the\nbeginning of the month after they are spent. The Storyteller may desire to extend\nthis time for large games that run less often than once a month. Either way, this\nperiod of time should remain constant, giving all of the players the same opportunity\nto employ their Influences on a regular basis.\nAttack, Follow, Growth, Trace and Watch endeavors should only be resolved at\nthe end of the month. This limit gives everyone a chance to put up levels of Conceal,\nDefense and Watch, and it lets the Storyteller take everyone’s Influence actions into\naccount so that he can produce better descriptive results of each person’s endeavors.\n"

In this way, it is even possible\nfor you to simulate the effects of Combine by loaning Influence to yourself from\nanother category.

In a network game,\nyou will need to clear an Influence action or endeavor that is intended to affect\nanother city with the Storyteller from the member chronicle who presides over the\ncity you are trying to affect.\nIf you wish to attempt an endeavor in a city other than the one in which your Influence\nis located, you may attempt to do so, but each action is effectively halved. If you wish to affect\na city on another continent, then each Trait you spend functions as one quarter of a Trait.\nSYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nThese systems are optional, but they have been developed by the Camarilla\n(White Wolf’s official fan organization) to suit large-scale games more easily.

For example, a character resisting Dread Gaze could use one\nAbility Trait to retest (as could his opponent), but he could not use a second Ability\nfor another retest. If he fails the challenge even after his Ability retest, he may still\ncall for another retest from another category, such as Willpower.\nWhen a character calls for a retest to a challenge, his opponent can employ an\nappropriate retest to negate it. The retest used to negate must be from the same\ncategory. A retest called for with a Willpower Trait may not be negated in this manner.\nEXTENDED\nXTENDED\nXTENDED\nXTENDED\nXTENDED C C C C CHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nExtended Challenges are often too cumbersome for quick play in large games.\nWhen engaging in an Extended Challenge, the player may optionally perform the\nfirst test as normal, gaining one “success” if he wins the test. If he gets that first\n“success,” he can opt to spend up to four additional Attribute Traits from the\nappropriate category to gain extra “successes.” For example, a wraith attempts to use\nMindspeak (Basic Mnemosynis). After winning the Mental Challenge, the wraith\nmay spend up to four Mental Traits for extra successes. With this system, or the\noriginal system, no power that relies upon Extended Challenges to inflict varying\ndegrees of damage should be allowed to inflict more than three levels of damage per\napplication, regardless of the number of “successes.”\n"

He is at the mercy of other characters, and\nhe may do nothing more than heal himself.\n• Mortally Wounded — Bleeding profusely and suffering from shock, a Mortally\nWounded individual has little time left. Mortally Wounded characters do not regain\nconsciousness normally. Instead, the character loses one Physical Trait every 20 minutes.\nOnce the character runs out of Physical Traits, he dies. Only the assistance of someone\nwith the Medicine Ability can halt this inexorable loss, and the character will not even\nbegin to heal unless he is treated by magic or full hospital resources. Vampires who are\ninjured beyond Incapacitated fall into a deathlike sleep known as torpor.\n• Death — To kill a character in combat requires that the character first be brought\nto the Mortally Wounded or Torpor health level. His attacker must then declare that he\nis performing a “killing blow” and defeat him in a Physical Challenge. Vampires can be\nkilled thus only if the blow involves aggravated damage or decapitation.\nIf a character is at the Mortally Wounded/ Torpor health level and is left in a\nposition that would logically lead to his demise, such as in a flaming building or a\ntrash compactor, the Narrator will declare the character to be dead after the\nappropriate amount of time.\nNarrators should never allow an “instant kill” without the consent of the target\n(i.e., he agrees to die for story purposes).

The second\nquestion is whether the players involved are going to enjoy a quick, narrative scene,\nor if they’d prefer a drawn-out, by-the-book scene. If you’re not sure, it’s okay to ask\nthe players directly. A good rule of thumb is that if any real out-of-character tension\narises between the players over the scene, you should likely just stick to a by-the-book\nstyle and leave the more diplomatic negotiation-oriented styles for later.\nPlaying It Conservatively\nIf you have determined that the players really want a more structured approach\nto the mob scene, this can be effectively accomplished if you stay focused throughout\nthe scene. The Storyteller needs to keep things moving at a reasonable pace\nthroughout the scene and not lose the players’ attention. It’s very easy in these\nsituations to let the focus drift away from the scene at hand or to become bogged\ndown in the minutiae of details that pertain to only a single challenge or retest.\nWhen playing the scene using the straight-and-narrow approach, taking some basic\nsteps will help keep things moving in the proper direction.\nTime spent arguing about the rules is time lost. Through the course of any long\nmob combat, the Storyteller will have to make several rules calls. Don’t worry about\npleasing everyone, but focus instead on making the fairest call possible, given the\ninformation you have. If a player wants to object after you make a call, let him. A single\nobjection is sometimes quite helpful, because the players may notice things that you\nmissed. However, if you still feel after hearing the objection that you made right call,\nsimply stick to the original call and move on. If the players still want to argue, tell them\nto abide by the decision for the time being and to bring it up after the game for further\ndebate if they would like. This approach allows the players to voice their concerns, but\nit also lets them know that no one is going to receive preferential treatment.\nIf the scene is in a public or high-traffic area, passersby will to want to get\ninvolved. You can handle this eventuality in a number of ways, but it has to be\naddressed, because the inclusion of new participants on any side of a fight can alter\nthe outcome dramatically. At the very beginning of the scene, establish who is in the\nscene, then limit any outside inclusion strictly. You can either move the whole group\nto a secluded area outside the general area, or simply record who is involved at the\nbeginning with a snapshot of the scene or a written list of participants. However you\nrecord it, the scene should be considered closed until the mob combat is over.\nOnce the scene begins, it is recommended that you keep tight control on the\nflow of the combat. Everyone should progress through the turns and Celerity/ Rage\nactions at the same pace, with no one moving farther ahead of the group in time or\nlagging behind. At the beginning of each turn, simply call for everyone’s stated\nactions, then break the situation down into its smallest component parts. Work on\neach of these components until everything is resolved, then start over for the next\nturn. As long as you keep things moving at a steady pace and you strive to incorporate\neveryone’s goals, the scene should play out without much difficulty.\nThe Narrative Approach\nIf the players are amenable to a more cooperative approach, then it might be\neasier to take a more freeform style to completing the scene. In this style, the players\nagree that the exact rules are not as important as the final outcome, and they agree\nto some give and take. Obviously, this approach doesn’t work as well if everyone’s\ngoals are to kill their enemies mercilessly, but sometimes it can be very rewarding.\nFirst off, the Narrator is responsible for making sure that things move forward\nat a reasonable pace and that everyone is focused on completing the scene as\nsmoothly as possible. The Narrator needs to remember that even in using this style,\n"

Frequently, the answers to this simple question can provide\nhints to the solution. If multiple or conflicting goals come up, it can be a good second\nstep to go back through the group after the first question and ask about each player’s\nlimits. In other words, the Narrator establishes each player’s best and worst\nconclusion to the scenario and then sets about trying to negotiate a way to satisfy as\nmany players as possible without letting anyone’s worst-case scenario come up.\nIf any diametrically opposed goals arise, then it is suggested that the Narrator find a\nway to meet (as much as possible) both goals without denying either outright. For instance,\na neonate has gravely insulted his elder, and the elder is attempting to kill the young upstart.\nThe neonate’s goal might be to simply get away, while the elder’s goal might be to kill the\nneonate. The Narrator can easily suggest that the elder mitigate his goal down to putting\nthe neonate into torpor and sending him to his clan’s elders. The neonate may accede to\ncapture if it doesn’t result in his death. Therefore, both parties could have what they want,\nwhile the path to get there may be different than either expected.\nIf the Narrator fails to reach an equitable solution between the groups, it is\nrecommended that the entire party default back to the conservative approach of\nplaying out every challenge as best as possible. The desired end of the narrative\napproach is to keep the story moving as long as possible and to give each party just\nenough closure to move on from this chapter without unnecessary problems. The\ngoal of the conservative approach, on the other hand, is to play out a single gambit\nin the larger story to the bitter end. Neither approach is intrinsically any better than\nthe other, but both have their place in the Narrator’s arsenal.\nA Cinematic Approach\nA compromise between the conservative and narrative styles is a more cinematic\nblend, which still attempts to pay close attention to the structure of the mob combat while\nmaking each turn as narrative as possible. Like the straight narrative style, this approach\nworks best if the combatants are not all absolutely set on killing each other as the only\noutcome. In this format, start as before by inquiring what everyone’s goals and limits are.\nThese answers should inform the individual turns as the scene moves forward. Then at each\nturn, inquire again what everyone wants to do. If some goals can be met without problems,\nsimply narrate what happens instead of worrying about the challenges for everything.\nDealing with the Innocent Bystanders\nIn most mob combat situations, you will have a collection of onlookers who are\neither there watching the scene in character and they chose not to get involved in\nthe chaos, or they have an out-of-character interest, and they are watching to see\nhow their friends do in the melee. Either case is usually fine, as long as the Narrator\nmakes it clear who is purely a spectator and who’s a participant. Regardless of the\nmethod he uses, the diligent Narrator will likely want to keep these onlookers at least\ninformed as to what is happening in the scene so that everyone gets the most out of\nit. The easiest way to do so is to call out what happens during each turn. Doing so\nserves two purposes, since it not only informs and entertains the audience, but it also\nwill cue the participants that they have to decide what their next actions will entail.\nThroughout the battle, it’s always good to keep track of roughly how much time\nhas passed in game, as well. Obviously this tally will never be exact, and it will never\nsync up with the real time that has passed, but it’s important nonetheless.

It’s important to track how much time has passed inside the\nscene so that the Narrator can understand when to allow outside agents to start\naffecting things. Since most turns do not take longer than about four seconds, it’s\nusually not feasible to allow outsiders into the combat until it is already over.\nAnother factor to watch for is the passerby. Players always just happen to be walking\nby, and they will typically want to either watch what’s going on or join in. Just like the\nauthorities, you don’t want the random passerby joining in either, since it’s unlikely that\nthey would actually be able to get into the situation by pure chance unless they come by\nduring the very first turn. After that first turn, it is advisable that the Narrator not allow\nanyone new to enter the combat who was not forewarned about it. If you notice that\nseveral people are preparing to walk back to the rest of the game, simply inform them that\nif they leave the area before the scene is over, they should refrain from making any\nannouncements or warnings to other players based on this situation. Frankly, it is not\nrealistic to have the general bystander walk leisurely by the site of a fracas, watch for a\nmoment, go tell other people about it, then come back with reinforcements or just more\nonlookers. Doing so would take several minutes at the least, and the whole combat could\nbe over in that much game time. Therefore you have the time-bubble effect, which\nusually traps people within its influence until the scene is done unless the bystander is\nwilling to walk away and pretend he really did not see any of the events taking place.\nOften, you will find that players are quite happy to accept that condition if it means that\nthey do not have to wait out of character for an hour while the mob combat runs its course.\nVAMPIRE\nAMPIRE\nAMPIRE\nAMPIRE\nAMPIRE S S S S SETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING S S S S SYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nTEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING D\n D\n D\n D\n DISCIPLINES\nISCIPLINES\nISCIPLINES\nISCIPLINES\nISCIPLINES\nIn large games, actual players’ characters often take the place of mentors and teachers\nfor other characters.

For example, a vampire who possesses an\nIntermediate level of his clan Disciplines may teach the Basic levels. With the exception\nof those who are portraying characters’ mentors, Narrator may not teach Disciplines.\nTo teach Advanced Necromancy or Thaumaturgy, the teacher must be a sixth- or\nseventh-generation vampire, and he must have the Advanced level in at least two paths\nof the Discipline.

Larger objects (such as melee weapons big enough to\ninflict two damage levels) reduce the Gnosis pool by two each. Even carrying a klaive penalizes\nthe wielder. These penalties last for a full day after the Garou stops carrying the object(s).\nHARANO\nARANO\nARANO\nARANO\nARANO\nHarano is an inexplicable gloom and inexpressible longing for unnamable\nthings. Some say it is caused by contemplation of Gaia’s suffering. Garou who suffer\nfrom Harano are prone to depression, lassitude and sudden mood swings. They may\nnot act at all, or they may explode into intense but ill-advised activity. One never\nknows. What is certain is that a Garou suffering from Harano is certainly not at his\nbest, and he may well be a liability to his pack, his sept and the fight to defend Gaia.\nIt is not common for a Garou to plunge into Harano, but it happens often enough\nto make it a concern. At the Narrator’s discretion, any werewolf who has suffered some\nsort of crushing defeat recently (failure of a plan, loss of a loved one, extended\nhumiliation) must make a Mental Challenge against 10 Traits. If he fails, he slips into\nHarano. Although this condition is not permanent, the gloom of Harano is hard to lift.\nA player whose character suffers from Harano must make a Willpower Test against\nseven Traits each scene. If he fails, the Garou plunges into either of the following:\nFanatical, Desperate Activity — The Garou must succeed on a Simple Test to\navoid acting immediately on any impulse that comes to mind. Furthermore, he is\ndown three Traits on all Mental and Social Challenges, and loses all ties.\nDeep Gloom and Depression — The Garou must succeed on a Simple Test to\nact at all. Otherwise he simply curls up and hopes the world goes away. In addition,\nhe is down three Traits on all Mental and Social Challenges, and loses all ties.\nThese effects last for the duration of a scene. A new test must be made at the\nbeginning of the next scene.\nFurthermore, the senses of any Garou in Harano are inevitably distorted by his\nintense inner torment; all Garou in Harano are down one additional Trait in any\nchallenges involving sight, smell or hearing.\nThose who suffer from Harano may have moments of lucidity after the expenditure\nof a Willpower Trait. This expenditure lifts the gloom for as many hours as a character\nhas permanent Willpower. Harano is not necessarily permanent. Extraordinary Garou\nmay free themselves from its grip after exceptional travails (at Storyteller discretion).\nGiven the crippling effects of this condition, only extreme circumstances\nshould sink a player’s character into Harano.\nTEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING G\n G G\n G GIFTS\nIFTS\nIFTS\nIFTS\nIFTS\nAll spirit teachers of Gifts must be approved by the Storyteller.

Spirits will teach out-of-breed/auspice Gifts if the\ncharacter has two Renown Traits not previously dedicated to the learning of another Gift.\nTribal Gifts are treasured secrets. Spirits will not teach tribal Gifts unless an\nathro or elder of that tribe (who is also a player’s character) authorizes it.\nFellow Garou Teaching Gifts\nAny time your character teaches or is taught a Gift from another werewolf\nwithout the approval of a spirit that could teach it, both teacher and student of the\nGift gain a Notoriety Trait. This penalty represents the jealous nature of spirits in\ntheir role as teachers of Gaia’s Gifts.\n"

All Artificers must\ntake at least one level in this Ability at character creation, or the character must buy\na level when adopted into the guild.\nBACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nHaunt\nThere are some places in the Skinlands where the Shroud is not as strong as it\nshould be. Whether the place is old and spooky or actually haunted, wraiths in that\nplace find it easier to cross the Shroud or use Arcanoi. A circle of wraiths can create\na haunt by crossing the Shroud repeatedly and using their Arcanoi to suspend the\ndisbelief of the Quick (usually by scaring them), but doing so takes many years. Most\nhaunts are either found by a lucky few, taken over by an ambitious circle or given to\na wraith by one of the factions.\nX\nYou’re homeless, and you have only your Fetters for refuge\n1\nIt’s so small you have to sleep standing up\n2\nIt’s not too fancy, but at least you have room to move around (A small studio)\n3\nYou finally have room for some guests (An apartment or a tiny house)\n4\nYou’re either living in luxury (or as close to it as you can get in the\nShadowlands), or you have an unusual or fortified haunt (A large house or\nmobile home)\n5\nYour haunt’s in Deader Homes and Gardens (A mansion)\nEach level of Haunt lowers the Shroud rating in the area by one. For example, if\nthe Shroud rating would normally be eight, a second-level haunt would lower it to six.\nWhile performing Arcanoi in the haunt, a wraith gets one free retest per Haunt rating.\nThese retests can only be performed once per session. While anyone may receive the\nbenefits of the lowered Shroud rating, the retests can only be used by the haunt’s owner.\nA circle of wraiths can share the benefits of a haunt, but each wraith must put\nin enough Background Traits to make the Haunt rating equal to three or higher.\nThey must also provide ample background justification for it. While anyone in the\nhaunt can share the lowered Shroud rating, only those who put background points\ninto it can share the free retests for Arcanoi. In this case, the number of retests for\nArcanoi for any particular character is the number of Background Traits that that\ncharacter invested, plus one. If a player’s character donated Background Traits to\nHaunt, and that character is destroyed or otherwise is put out of the game, then the\nHaunt rating is made of the Background Traits of the remaining characters. If the\nnew Haunt rating or number of remaining circle members is less than three, then the\ncircle will not receive free retests for Arcanoi until the situation is remedied.\nLegacy\nPeople dedicate their lives to leaving something behind to mark their existence\nafter they’re dead and gone. A legacy is not the memories that people have about a\nwraith or things that represent their ties to the Skinlands, but rather it is a measure\nof the accomplishments that they have left behind. A wraith’s legacy can be just\nabout anything such as a work of art, a term of slang or a scientific formula.\nX\nYou left nothing behind that marks your existence\n1\nSomebody printed a poem that you wrote in an obscure journal\n"

Each\nsuccess heals a normal wound instantly, or an aggravated wound (with an additional\nhalf an hour spent at the legacy site). For example, a wraith with a Legacy rating of\ntwo makes two Simple Tests, but wins only one.

There is no challenge to detect this activity, and they can feel it each\ntime the wraith expends a Willpower Trait for attunement.\nAttunement benefits only apply to the wraith who successfully manifested, skinrode\n(or otherwise hid in the Consort), and spent the Willpower for attunement. Therefore, if\na wraith attunes a mortal to itself, then only that wraith receives the benefits of attunement,\nunless other wraiths spend the time and energy to attune the mortal as well. The process\nof attunement takes time. Each successful manifestation and Willpower spent for attunement\nmust occur on different occasions, and they can occur no more than once per night. A\nConsort can be attuned to more than one wraith at a time at Storyteller discretion. If a\nwraith wishes to attune someone else’s Consort to itself, then the wraith must make a greater\nnumber of manifestation attempts and spend a greater amount of Willpower to do so. A\nStoryteller determines the specific number of attempts and the Willpower cost.\nMortals with True Faith cannot become Consorts. Wraiths tend to find the\npresence of such people uncomfortable to say the least. An exorcism on a Consort\nby a character with True Faith will remove the effects of being a Consort.\nEXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE T\n T T\n T TRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT E E E E EXPENDITURES\nXPENDITURES\nXPENDITURES\nXPENDITURES\nXPENDITURES\nInnate Abilities of an Arcanos cost two Experience Traits.

Incidental Chimera are the most\ncommon type found in the Enchanted World. They are stray dreams that have\npopped up here and there, and they are almost always tied to a specific place or\nperson. While these Chimera may seem solid in their proper setting, they are actually\nvery frail, and they will crumble if removed. Most sentient Chimera in the real world\nare Incidental Chimera.\nDreamed Chimera are the type that are found most commonly in the\nDreaming. They are those that are most generally turned into Crafted Chimera.\nWhile these Chimera are much sturdier than Incidental ones, they are still likely\nto dissolve if they are not crafted or forged properly. Sentient Chimera in the\nDreaming are usually this type of Chimera. Chimera or companions created with\nDream Weaving are of this type.\nCrafted chimerical items are the kind that most Kithain are familiar with.\nThese Crafted Chimera are items such as leather, wood or metal that have been made\ninto something. Generally, Chimera cannot be crafted into items more complicated\nthan a simple mechanical device. Crafted Chimera are still as vulnerable to Banality\nas Dreamed Chimera are.\nForged Chimera are the rarest type because generally only nockers can make\nthem. Forged Chimera have been altered on the most fundamental level. Forged\nChimera have an amazing resilience against Banality, and they are not connected\nto a certain person or place like most other Chimera are. Through their Arts, nockers\ncan create a wide variety of forged mechanical monstrosities.\nCreating Chimera\nIncidental Chimera may be changed into Crafted Chimera as per the rules in\nThe Shining Host with the following changes. After all the Glamour has been spent,\na point of Willpower must be spent as well. A Simple Test must then be won allowing\nthe Chimera to last until it comes in contact with high levels of Banality (7+ Traits).\nThese Chimera may still erode over time, and they may need to be infused with\nadditional Glamour each session at the Storyteller’s discretion.\nDreamed Chimera may be changed into Crafted Chimera as per the rules in\nThe Shining Host. These Chimera are much sturdier than Incidental Chimera, but\nthey still may fade if they come into contact with high levels of Banality (9+ Traits).\nThis is up to the Storyteller who may call for a Challenge or Simple Test as desired.\nChimera Creation Time\nThe Storyteller has final say on how much time is required to create Chimera\nand companions, but it generally ranges from six hours to one year (depending on\nthe Background level simulated).\nTreasure Creation\nTreasures are not Chimera, and they are not created like standard Chimera\nor companions. The creation of a treasure is an epic undertaking, one that should\nrequire an appropriate quest of some sort. There are no raw mechanics for making\ntreasures. Their creation should be a story in itself, and the Storyteller should\ndetermine when (and if) the proper moment of completion has come. Treasures\nare granted powers by the supervising Storyteller with approval restrictions\nequivalent to the Treasures Background. Characters who quest for a treasure must\npay an amount in Experience Traits equivalent to the rating of the treasure before\nbeing able to harness its magic.\n"

A weapon capable of destroying a shield penetrates\nit automatically and renders it useless after three successful blows, no matter what\nsize or strength the shield may be.\nFully Automatic\nA firearm with this ability is capable of emptying dozens of rounds into a single target\nat close range. By expending 10 bullets in a single attack, this weapon inflicts an extra health\nlevel of damage automatically due to the sheer volume of fire. Once the clip is empty, the\ncharacter must spend one action reloading the weapon before he may fire again.\nHigh-Caliber\nFirearms of particularly high caliber can cause crippling wounds with only a few\nshots. When a high-caliber bullet hits a target, the attacker should make a Simple\nTest immediately. A win or tie indicates that the target suffers an additional health\nlevel of damage from the shot.\nIncendiary\nBurning weapons cause aggravated wounds to just about anything. Some, such as flame\nthrowers or Molotov cocktails, burn the target with streams or explosions of fire, while others\nsuch as incendiary rounds (“hot loads”) burn the target with superheated ammunition.\nMass-Trauma\nCertain weapons are so powerful that they inflict massive damage on a target,\nliterally tearing away portions of flesh. Such weapons score an extra health level of\ndamage when they are used appropriately.\nSpeed\nIn close combat with someone whose weapon has a Negative Trait of Slow,\nClumsy or Heavy, you gain one additional bonus Trait, provided you have at least one\nlevel of the Melee Ability.\nSpray\nThe weapon can strike up to three closely grouped targets at once, as long as they\nare farther than five feet from the shooter. The shooter makes one test against all the\ntargets simultaneously. Each target who fails the test suffers the weapon’s damage, while\neach target who succeeds avoids the weapon’s damage. The shooter risks only the Traits\nrequired to test against each member of the group, and he loses only those Traits if any\nof the defenders wins the test.

In the course of any single evening’s game, these definitions are often enough to\ndefine the boundaries of the powers in use. However, when the scope of the game\nextends past a single night or location, things get more complicated. A small set of\nthese powers becomes truly problematic as the effects begin to extend beyond even the\njurisdiction of a single Storyteller. When dealing with these powers, it’s usually best to\ndefine the basics first and then expand the concepts from that starting point.\nOne of the important aspects of the Mind’s Eye Theatre rules is the idea of\nhusbanding resources. The system is built with this game of limited resources in mind. The\nplayers have a pool of Attributes that decreases continuously over the course of a session,\na Willpower rating which is used to invoke a large number of powers and is very difficult\nto refresh and a special Trait pool (be it Blood, Gnosis, Glamour or whatever) that takes\ntime and effort to replenish. Retaining these expendables correctly is a large part of the\ngame, so regulating the times over which they can be used effectively is a key tool in the\nStoryteller’s arsenal for enforcing the tension of a game. The last few hours of any long game\nweekend can be especially terrifying to the players if they haven’t been able to refresh some\nof those pools and the Storytellers are enforcing the duration limits in creative ways.\n"

Most sites have an open area\nthat ends up being the central gathering point, and the “scene” that takes place in\nthat room almost never actually ends. This approach is common enough that players\nhave grown to expect it as a focal point of activity in a game. As a consequence, the\nStorytellers are left redefining the scope of their game.\nIn a traditional tabletop session, a scene is marked by the change of location or a\nmajor shift in the action of the story. The demands of a live-action game alter this\nexpectation dramatically, as the number of participants rises. The Storytellers have less\nand less direct control over the indicators of scene. Therefore, it is best to set a standard\nthat everyone knows and can rely on. In the case of the scene, wherever there is a doubt\nabout how long something should last, the scene duration defaults to one hour or one\nscene, whichever is shorter. If characters get into such situations, we still want them to\nact within the confines of the scene, and not have the effects of powers spilling over into\nother scenes once the immediate need is over. For example, if the local anarchs make an\nattack on the prince of the city and the prince invokes Majesty and manages to escape,\nhe won’t have that Majesty still active when he walks into the Elysium later on to rally\nthe primogen. He’d have to invoke it again and pay its corresponding cost again.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E S S S S SESSION\nESSION\nESSION\nESSION\nESSION\nThe usual definition of a session includes the events of one night’s game,\nstarting at character check-in and ending with a wrap-up. Surprisingly, in a long-\nrunning game, even this value needs to be evaluated and either reinforced or tossed\naside. In any serial game, one in which the overall chronicle runs through multiple\ngame sessions, then the standard definition works well until the group decides to run\na full weekend-long event with multiple evenings worth of play. The plots and stories\ndesigned for such games almost always take the multiple nights into consideration,\nbut the rules still just say “session.”\nThere are several ways to handle this, and they can even be made to handle the\ntime between weekly or semi-weekly games as well. The largest issue is the\nreplenishment of Traits. The Storytellers need to decide the rates at which Traits are\nreplenished. For long-running games, the following is recommended:\nAttributes are replenished at the end of each evening. In a game in which things\nrun 24 hours a day and seven days a week, it is recommended that these Traits be\nreplenished only after the character sits out of play for the equivalent of a night’s\nsleep. At some conventions, this measure can be an effective prod to encourage the\nmore exuberant participants to get some much-needed sleep.\nWillpower replenishes one Trait per week on its own. A character can replenish\none additional Trait per week for satisfying the requirements of her Nature.\nAll special Traits (such as Blood or Gnosis) have character-driven replenishment\nmethods. These methods can even form the basis for stories all on their own. The more\norganized games find a lot of utility in the idea of an Influence and Feeding Center for\nexactly this purpose. When using such a central Storyteller base, a game typically\nestablishes a small area that’s considered out-of-play and always has at least one\nStoryteller on duty at all times. That on-call Storyteller is then responsible for running\nthe feeding challenges or Influence expenditures that happen during any game. In a\nLaws of the Wild game, this position is sometimes combined with the Spirit Keeper\npost. In an Oblivion chronicle, this Storyteller sometimes runs Harrowings.\n"

      "text": "92\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nIn games lasting for a few days — usually in a convention style setting — the\nStorytellers need to decide how quickly the characters can recover Traits. The choice they\nmake can reinforce the themes and moods of the overall game. For instance, if one of your\nkey issues in an event is the scarcity of resources, then you will likely want to limit and slow\nthe rate of recovery. You may even wish to keep characters from recovering Attribute Traits\nuntil the entire event ends, thereby forcing the players to truly think about how they will\nspend Traits, and what challenges are worth their effort. To establish a more cinematic and\naction-oriented theme, you may wish to make Trait-replenishment happen much faster.\nWillpower, for instance, is a key Trait for using some vampiric Disciplines, so if it is\nreplenished in full every morning, you will encourage people to use it far more often.\nSessions have yet another connotation. In a chronicle composed of numerous gaming\ngroups running separate sessions in which players can travel freely between them, it becomes\nimportant to look at the possible frequency of sessions. Many powers and refresh rates are set\non a “per session” basis. For instance, a character overcomes Conditioning in six sessions minus\none session for each Willpower Trait spent. If one of the gaming groups of your chronicle runs\nonce a month and its neighbor runs every weekend, which time frame is the character\nsupposed to use? Inconsistency will leave the players feeling like there is an inherent bias\ntoward or against some of them, so you will want to set a standard that is not dependent upon\nthe actual sessions available, or on the frequency of the gaming groups gathering. Typically,\njust as a scene can default to one hour, a session can default to one month.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E S S S S STORY\nTORY\nTORY\nTORY\nTORY\nThe last, and largest, of the variable time durations used is the story. In its\noriginal context of a limited time frame game, or a serialized collection of stories, this\nlimit may work very well, but in the rolling field of a game that never stops (or which\nhas multiple Storytellers running multiple stories), it can be very vague. The story\nduration tends to be a long-term marker of time, and it is usually composed of several\nsessions. If the session equals roughly one month of time, then it is recommend that\na story be either three months or six months of real time. This measure of time may\nseem unusually long, but when discussing the long term items like gaining a new Path\nTrait or Virtue Trait, such a frame of time is not uncalled for.\nCROSSOVER\nROSSOVER\nROSSOVER\nROSSOVER\nROSSOVER P\n P P\n P\n POWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS\nFew creatures in the World of Darkness welcome the idea of dealing and\nmingling openly with other supernatural creatures. The denizens of the World of\nDarkness all have secrets that they struggle to keep hidden. Every kind of monster,\nafter all, has some prohibition against revealing its true nature to anyone who is not\nalready in the know. This secrecy is an important aspect of the world, and it helps\nthe Storyteller establish a sense of mystery and exploration. The world is much more\nfrightening when the characters don’t understand the fine points of werewolves and\nghosts. Times come, though, when the crossover game is exactly what you want.\nMost crossover games present a stylistic risk to the unprepared Storyteller. That\nrisk is that the crossover game, more so than any single setting on its own, tends to\ndevolve into one of three unfavorable scenarios. Note that there are generally\npositive versions of all three of these scenarios, but the following represents the most\nlikely end when things don’t go the way you planned.\nBIASED\nIASED\nIASED\nIASED\nIASED V V V V VIOLENCE\nIOLENCE\nIOLENCE\nIOLENCE\nIOLENCE\nOne side is attempting to assert its control and/ or dominance over the other.\nThis is the frequent end of Sabbat/ Camarilla and vampire/ werewolf crossovers, and\n"

As a plot\ndevice, it could be great, but when the Shadow Lord was supposed to be a cunning\ninfiltrator until the player decided to branch out… well, that can get messy.\nUNHEARD\nNHEARD\nNHEARD\nNHEARD\nNHEARD-O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F A A A A ALLIES\nLLIES\nLLIES\nLLIES\nLLIES\nThis pitfall occasionally is the result of vampire/ werewolf crossovers, but is just\nas prevalent in the werewolf/ changeling dynamic. It typically leads to the free\nexchange of lores and items that truly do not belong in the opposite setting, which\nwreaks havoc on a Storyteller’s ability to control the flow of information in the game\nand upsets the themes we strive to establish.\nNOISE\nOISE\nOISE\nOISE\nOISE\nThis is the typical result of wraith/ vampire crossovers, although it has been\nknown to characterize the results of almost any crossover combination. Typically\nthis pitfall occurs when an interaction fails to produce a definable result or add to the\nhost setting’s themes or plots. The interaction is reduced to background noise\nsubtracting from the inherent mood and ambiance of the host genre. For example,\nyour local game plays in a small bar and the wraith that you just approved for the\nsubtle shock and horror value is drowned out by the background noise of the club and\nmost of the other participants simply tune the intruder out.\nA successful crossover requires that the Storytellers pay special consideration to\nthe two most basic tools at their disposal: plot and mechanics. Loss of plot leads either\nto senseless violence and friction or to the lion and lamb lying down together. Loss of\nmechanics inevitably ends in making players angry when they feel that they’ve played\nat the expense of their character. While this can be said of almost any chronicle, it’s\nparticularly evident during the cross-genre event as creatures of vastly different aims\nand abilities attempt to get the better of each other. Despite all the pitfalls of such an\nendeavor, though, a successful crossover game can add immensely to the story. In any\ncrossover, you can limit the number of intruders into the host setting (such as a pack\nof werewolves coming into a Camarilla Elysium), make the game a free-for-all\ncrossover with relatively equal portions of two or more supernatural creature types.\nGENERAL\nENERAL\nENERAL\nENERAL\nENERAL R R R R RULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nWhen two powers conflict, the Storyteller or Narrator should first decide who\nis the more potent contestant. Compare the vampire’s Discipline level, werewolf’s\nRank, mage’s Sphere rating, wraith’s Arcanoi, or changeling’s Art level and\ndetermine the higher level. If any question of effectiveness arises, decide in the favor\nof the more potent contestant, as noted in the Power Interaction chart. Obviously\ndoing so is unnecessary in some cases (such as when a vampire tests damage down\nwith Fortitude), but it can save a lot of time in resisted efforts.\nThis approach will generally speed up the interactions and dispute resolutions\nimmensely, but it will have the side effect of favoring vampires, fae and wraiths, who\ncan buy up to Advanced powers without the accompanying hassle of buying up\nexpensive Arete Traits or Rank.\nAs an example, a vampire with Intermediate Obfuscate should be able to hide\nfrom the Rank One or Two werewolf with Heightened Senses without much difficulty.\nIf the Garou is of Rank Three or Four, they should test as normal.

If you\nwant to encourage the interaction between vampires and werewolves, then reduce\nthe number to a more manageable level, but this is one of the few limiting factors on\nthe abuse of the Umbra against Cainites.\nWRAITH\nRAITH\nRAITH\nRAITH\nRAITH I I I I INTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nMixing wraiths and vampires is popular due to the similar themes expressed in\neach setting. Special care needs to be taken in such a crossover, though. Vampires\nhave almost no natural defenses from wraiths, and the wraiths have several Arcanoi\nthat allow them to affect and harm a physical creature directly. Werewolves and the\nfae are more evenly matched versus wraiths, although still not entirely so. When\njudging an interaction between wraiths and anything in the Skinlands, keep the\nfollowing things in mind at all times:\nThe Shroud\nThis rating defaults to an 8, and it must be beaten in a Static Mental Challenge at\nthe start of every scene in which the wraith is attempting to affect something on the other\nside. Using Embody to cross it physically will negate this challenge and allow the direct\nusage of all other Arcanoi. Crossing the Shroud thus also leaves the wraith open to such\nretaliations as Disciplines, Gifts and Physical Challenges. Note that particularly intense\nscenes may require testing against the Shroud for every turn at the Storyteller’s discretion,\ninstead of every scene. If you would like to make things easier to cross between vampires\nand wraiths, any gathering of vampires is bound to lower the Shroud slightly since a\ngathering of the undead tends to lend a creepy and gothic feel to any place.\nRight-Minded Wraiths Fear Angst\nAny collection of vampires is a veritable festival of Angst. A good technique\nto bring this point home: Have a wraith make a simple test every time he enters a\nscene with more vampires than his permanent Angst rating, in order to resist gaining\na temporary Angst. Spectres, of course, are immune to this aspect of the collected\npsychic baggage of a roomful of the dead, although they may attempt to harvest\nAngst as normal. Conversely, Spectres in the presence of several Garou or fae should\nlikely test for temporary Composure in the same manner as wraiths for Angst.\nLifesight Works Against Vampires.\nLifesight will function as Aura Perception for the purposes of information yielded.\nHowever, it is only an innate ability of wraiths, so any level of Obfuscate that the\nvampire possesses will defeat it. For instance, while this ability will not allow a vampire\nwith only Unseen Presence to mask his true feelings (Soul Mask is still needed for that),\nit will allow him to remain hidden when the wraith using Lifesight is looking for him.\n"

The only exceptions to this\nguideline are the Malkavians who have both relatively low Banality levels and an\naffinity to the Dreaming. Therefore, they should not count against the total Banality\nof a room. The Kiasyd have an affinity for the Dreaming, but normal Banality for a\nVampire. Ravnos vampires have a low Banality, but no affinity to the Dreaming.\nGarou are more likely to interact with the fae, due to similarities of setting more than\nanything else. While Garou do not inherently exude Banality as vampires do, they are\nstill fearsome creatures with an extremely quick temper, and care should be taken in the\ninteractions of the two groups. These interactions should highlight the similarities\nbetween their struggles but make it clear that the struggles are not really compatible. A\ngood theme here is to play the differences of each race against the similarities.\nThe restless dead have little to do with the fae, or more precisely, the fae want\nlittle to do with them.\nThe Mists\nEveryone is subject to the Mists, with the sole exception of Malkavian vampires.\nBanality\nMost fae Arts are fairly fragile in that retests are almost unheard of, but they are also\nunfettered in what they can accomplish. Banality is one of the few natural defenses that all\nother creatures have against the fae Arts. Setting the Banality of the other creatures in the\nchronicle is a great way to help limit or control interactions of a magical nature. The average\nvampire, for example, has a Banality of approximately 8. However, if you would like the\ninteractions to be more difficult, feel free to raise the Banality to a 9 or even a 10.\nIndividual Powers\nAs far as powers go, several Arts can be rather heinous when used against\nanother creature type. Some examples are Elder-Form, Quicksilver and Flicker Flash.\nA Storyteller should never feel out of line for stating that it is not possible to convert\nthe angry Get of Fenris into a toad by kissing it on the nose with Elder-Form/Dire\nEnemy.

You will find that the longer your chronicle runs, the greater the diversity\nin power levels grows between the characters of such players and the players who attend\nonly occasionally. This diversity is not a bad thing. People will put into your chronicle\nwhat they expect to get out of it. Often though, this escalation creates an arms race\namong players as they build their characters to new heights in an attempt to keep up\nwith one another’s power levels. Experience Trait build-up leads to several problems.\nThe first and most important is that players lose track of the goal of the game, which\nis to have fun in a live-action setting, not to build stats on a piece of paper.\nAnother problem is that if a player’s character is killed after the player spent the\nlast two years investing Experience Traits into it, she can be disheartened by her\nreduced standing in the race. For similar reasons, players who have a lot of\nExperience Traits invested into their character will be reluctant to retire their\ncharacter in favor of exploring fresh new concepts.\nOne way to get around this problem is to allow a player to use a portion of the\nearned Experience Traits from her last character on her new character. It is\nrecommended that if you use this system, you set that amount at about 25 percent,\nand certainly no more than 50 percent. Giving too much back encourages players\nto make careless decisions with their characters, since they have little to lose if their\ncharacter is killed. Likewise, players may retire their characters too often, which\nkeeps a balance of power and politics from being developed in the game.\nFor chronicles that are intended to run in excess of several years, a more complex\nsystem may be required to address the problem. Varying your chronicle’s Experience Trait\ncaps as they apply to each character individually (based upon total Traits earned) may be\nthe answer. For example, if a starting character can earn a certain amount of Experience\nTraits in a month until the total reaches 50, and characters with over 50 Experience Traits\ncan earn only half that much, older characters still end up being more powerful. However,\nthe gap between old and new characters can be closed a bit. If the player of the new character\nearns the maximum amount each month, she will find that she is not as far behind the other\ncharacters as she would have been if everyone had the same cap.\nFor more finite control of this effect (with a touch more complexity), consider\napplying this graduated Experience Trait cap in several tiers, gradually reducing the\nmaximums for characters as they increase in power. This system allows you to better\ncontrol the learning curve in your chronicle and extend its lifetime. Each month, the\nplayer checks her total earned Experience Traits and compares it to your graduated\nchart to find out what her maximum will be for that month. If you give extra\nExperience Traits at character creation to some characters, do not consider these\nTraits when calculating “earned” Experience for these purposes.\nAUTOMATIC\nUTOMATIC\nUTOMATIC\nUTOMATIC\nUTOMATIC A A A A AWARDS\nWARDS\nWARDS\nWARDS\nWARDS\nSometimes the Storyteller may wish to exercise even more control over the\ncharacters’ growth in a chronicle. In this case, it might simply be better to award\nExperience Traits based on the desired rate of increase, rather than the standard\nmethod. In chronicles that run with large periods of time between sessions (such as\nan annual event), the Storyteller may wish to award Experience Traits in a similar\nmanner rather than relying on the standard method.\nCHANGING\nHANGING\nHANGING\nHANGING\nHANGING THE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE R R R R RULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nThe World of Darkness is a constantly expanding and changing work, and many\nplayers want to feel that they are in a chronicle that reflects the major changes in that world.\nThese changes are realized in two principle ways — through rules and through plot.\n"

Therefore, it is sometimes useful to break the\nchanges down into changes that are justification for rules additions and changes that\nare purely setting additions. Rules addition changes should be implemented if the\nchronicle is going to use the new rule, while setting additions need to be evaluated on\nthe basis of the chronicle’s commitment to stay true to the White Wolf story line.\nAn example of a change implemented for the purpose of making a rules addition\nis the advent of the plague which afflicted the Malkavian clan and left the clan with\nDementation instead of Dominate. Clearly, this event is something that you can run\nin your chronicle to explain the change. It can have a positive impact on the stories\nof every Malkavian in your chronicle and give them the reasoning to transition over\nto Dementation.\nThe destruction of the Ravnos Antediluvian, on the other hand, does not\nexplain any changes in the rules since it is a more purely story-driven plot point. It\nis a part of White Wolf’s published story line, and can be easily implemented through\nthe Time of Thin Blood sourcebook. However, if you aren’t following the official\nstory line, there’s little express need to run the story in that book, except that it would\nbe fun for the players involved.\nIMPLEMENTING\nMPLEMENTING\nMPLEMENTING\nMPLEMENTING\nMPLEMENTING N\n N\n N\n N\n NE W\nE W\nE W\nE W\nE W R R R R RULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nULES R R R R RELEASES\nELEASES\nELEASES\nELEASES\nELEASES\nNew releases are part and parcel of the gaming experience. Players will\nconstantly ask if they can use the latest gadget or ability that was published in a new\nsupplement. Being prepared for this situation is essential to any long-time Story-\nteller. As long as the Storyteller understands how the new rules fit into the chronicle,\nand he sticks to a plan to implement them, there is no reason for such things to be\nunduly painful to a game. Your game can implement new materials as soon as they\nare available, which becomes less about Storytellers implementing changes accord-\ning to plots run in the chronicle, and more about when your players can purchase the\nnew books. You can also schedule points in the game when new rules will generally\nbe implemented. Scheduling regular intervals for updates will make anticipating\nthose updates easier for the players and minimize the negative impact of not having\na direct control over the game’s growth in this area, but it also can remove some of\nthe spontaneity of the constantly growing chronicle.\nWhen making changes to a chronicle, decide whether the change needs to be\nexplained in the world with a plot that alters things to accommodate the new rule,\nor if it simply needs to change and be done. Major system changes and rules that are\nnot tied to the setting are best to simply drop into place on a set date and be done\nwith, since doing so forces the players to change and everyone has to deal with it\ntogether.

      "text": "101\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nWhen converting rules from the tabletop sources, try to keep to a few simple\ntips in mind:\nTry to stay as true as possible to the original idea. If you didn’t like what the rule\nor power was trying to accomplish, you wouldn’t be converting it. That sounds like\nan obvious point, but as you try to translate ideas from one system to another, it’s\nsometimes easy to warp the original intent of a rule beyond recognition.\nTry to maintain definable benefits and flaws in your conversions. It’s great to\nsay that a certain power makes the character more attractive when activated and\nthat people can’t resist their presence, but that benefit alone doesn’t really describe\nanything that can be enforced as a mechanic. It’s always better to include some form\nof mechanics that will add or subtract defined Traits and abilities. Stating that a\npower makes someone more attractive and adds the Social trait of Attractive and\ngives a free retest on Presence Challenges is much more helpful.\nTry to avoid powers that allow one character or character type to have a huge\nstatistical advantage. While it may seem great for a new discipline to have the ability\nto stake anyone without a test, the people who are victims of that power won’t likely\nbe having much fun. Try to always allow for a way to counter the power, or at least\nprovide a test so that some element of escape is available.\nDon’t make up completely new mechanics when existing ones will do. Part of\nthe danger of any new rule is that it won’t fit in well with the rules that are already\nin play, or that it will needlessly complicate matters. Be familiar with other published\nconversions and look for similar powers in supplements that can be modified slightly\nto arrive at the goal you want. Doing so can relieve you of the necessity of making\nup wholly new material, while assuring you that the new rule will fit in well with the\nestablished material.\nActivation costs such as Blood, Gnosis, Rage, Willpower and Glamour that\nmust be expended to initiate or fuel a power usually rely on a straight one-to-one\nconversion. For instance, all Thaumaturgy powers cost one blood point to activate\nin tabletop, and the same is true in the MET version.\nTabletop rules sometimes require a roll against a standard difficulty to activate\na power. Usually, this mechanic can be translated as an appropriate Static Test\nagainst a difficulty slightly higher than the tabletop version. For instance, if the\noriginal write up requires a Wits roll with a difficulty of 5, it is perhaps best translated\nas a Static Mental Challenge against six traits. If the tabletop power called for a Wits\nroll with a difficulty of 10, the translation should likely be against 12 to 15 Traits,\nwhich simulates more accurately the difficulty of rolling 10s.\nPowers that add successes to another roll or add dice to the roll should usually\nbe translated as a number of Traits added to the character’s total. It is unadvisable\nto add more than three or four Traits for any single power; a two-Trait addition is\nmore reasonable. Another way to translate these powers is to provide a retest in a\nfailed challenge rather than extra Traits.\nIt is almost always best to translate extended challenges as expending Traits. For\ninstance, if the original write-up requires a success for each degree of damage done\nor level of success in the power, it is advisable to have the translation require the\nexpenditure of the appropriate Traits to increase the damage done or level of success.\n"

Trying to account for all the variables in the way a plot plays out\n(especially a plot that involves a large number of characters) takes a long time. To\navoid this problem, consider the following questions when constructing a plot:\nWhat is the time frame for this plot?\nDo you intend to make this idea a centerpiece of your chronicle, or will it be a\nshort diversion or follow up to previous character actions? Depending on your\nanswers, you’ll need to budget your time both in and out of game to do justice to the\nidea. There is nothing so annoying to a player as a plot that fizzles just as it’s getting\ninteresting or a fairly minor plot that drags on and on.\nIs this plot idea something that would appeal to the player base?\nYou may think that the immortal globe-trotting veteran of the Finnish War that\nyou’ve been fleshing out since your seventh-grade World History class is the neatest\ncharacter concept since Hamlet. You may think that his search for his family’s lost signet\n"

Players are looking for substance in live-action stories, but that\nsubstance must be of interest to them. Never rely on ideas that are too obscure or too tedious\nto be of immediate interest to a majority cross-section of your players.\nCan I tie character backgrounds into the plot?\nFollowing up on the previous question, your players are much more likely to be\ninterested in a plot line that includes elements that affect their characters directly.\nTying your local underworld kingpin into a plot that has to do with a power play in\nthe arms-smuggling business via a long time friend (from his character history) is a\nmuch better idea than having a random source in the player’s downtime report\nrelaying news to him anonymously.\nWhat is the threat level of this plot?\nPlot can kill, but it does not have to kill. Should you arrive at the conclusion that\ncharacters can die in the course of your plot, you need to ensure that the story payoff will\nbe such that they will feel rewarded even if they do not come out alive. Having a character\ndie is painful, but knowing that his death was worth something lessens the blow\nsomewhat. Also, remember that not every antagonist should seek to kill a story’s\nprotagonist(s), even if a major difference of opinion on one or more issues separates them.\nCan I involve characters of various potencies in this story?\nGenerally speaking, your plots should be accessible to all levels of players, from\nthose who are new to your game to those who have been around from day one. Granted,\ncertain plot lines do not lend themselves easily to upholding that ideal. Plots that set\nthe characters against minor threats are imminently accessible to weak or inexperi-\nenced characters, but they are consequently uninteresting to more experienced ones.\nThe challenge of major threats may be perfect for higher-level characters, but they will\nvery likely destroy any low-level characters who have the gumption to tag along.\nWhen you create stories for groups of characters of various strengths, try to\nseparate the characters’ identifiable goals into sub-goals of equal importance but\nvarying difficulty. Doing so can be as simple as making sure that antagonists in a mob-\ncombat scene attack protagonist characters of an equal or greater degree of power,\nor as complex as arranging circumstances in such a way that the characters decide\nto split up into internally consistent specialty groups.\nSCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND S S S S SCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nWhether they are character-generated or Storyteller-generated, plots must fit\nthe chronicle that you are creating. Based on the earlier decisions you made when\nsetting up the chronicle, you should have some idea of how grandiose you want your\nsetting to be. Depending on your decisions, your chronicle will be one of three sizes.\nUsually, chronicles will start at the local scale and progress to the mixed scale, where\nthey tend to stay.

Plots of this scale tend\nto affect the heads of the society in question first then trickle down to smaller movers\non the local scene.\nThis scale is a very comfortable level for both players and Storytellers, since it\nprovides the variety of a connection to non-local events while retaining the focus\non local events that the previous level of involvement had. It is important, however,\nto ensure that the stories of this scope that you tell are entertaining for all players.\nDue to the monopolization of societal connections by more experienced players,\nnew players or lower point players may feel left out of the equation.

One method of creating a world-spanning plot requires\nthat your player’s characters and your Storyteller characters possess sufficient political\nand personal power to make them the center of the culture of which they are a part.\nFor this level of scale to serve as an ongoing chronicle, you must also see that you have\na sufficient reason for such powerful characters to be massed in one area. Resist the urge,\nhowever, to trot out the All-Consuming End of the World Threat. Saving the world\nonce makes for a fine and fulfilling story; having to save the world time and again will\neventually bore your players and make you feel like a scriptwriter for Dragon Ball Z.\nAn easier way to create a world-spanning plot is to drop a key element of that plot\ninto your chronicle and make clear the chain of events that will result when your\nplayers’ characters resolve that part of the plot. The scope of the action of your plot\nremains local, but the ramifications of your characters’ actions resound throughout the\nWorld of Darkness. Similarly, you can use the outcome of an individual chronicle’s\nlocal plot as the genesis for a broader chain of events throughout a chronicle network.\nLike knocking over dominoes, one chronicle’s actions will affect its neighboring\nchronicles, and their reactions will affect still more neighboring chronicles until the\nentire network feels the effects of what was originally a local story.\nWORKING\nORKING\nORKING\nORKING\nORKING W\n W\n W\n W\n WITH\nITH\nITH\nITH\nITH T T T T THEME\nHEME\nHEME\nHEME\nHEME AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND M\n M\n M\n M\n MOOD\nOOD\nOOD\nOOD\nOOD\nBefore you can scout out potential players, create characters, construct plots or\ndetermine the breadth of your version of the World of Darkness, you should\ndetermine what sort of theme and mood you want your chronicle to uphold.

An understanding of the\nchronicle’s theme helps players create characters that will flourish in your game and\navoid types that will fail. Storytellers and Narrators will build plots and characters\nbased on these considerations, and the success of your story can be judged based on\nhow well it has stayed true to the theme and upheld its mood.\nBooks, magazine articles, plays or movies you’ve enjoyed can all provide ideas for you\nto choose from. They need not even be supernatural in nature. The air of scholarly intrigue\nand whodunit mystery in Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose would suit a number of\nfactions in the World of Darkness perfectly, ranging from the vampires of Clan Tremere\nin Vampire: The Masquerade to the enlightened wizards of the Order of Hermes or\nCelestial Chorus in Mage: The Ascension. Also, don’t be afraid that you’ll ruin a perfectly\ngood theme by pulling it out of its original context and applying it to a modern story. A good\ntheme appeals to something central in the human mindset, and it can be recast in any\nnumber of settings and genres. A good example of how a theme (or even just a good story)\ncan last the ages would be Akira Kurosawa’s The Seven Samurai, which subsequently was\nadapted in the United States as The Magnificent Seven. Despite major changes in setting and\ntime period (not to mention language), the theme still shone through.\nThe best place to start in your review is your potential player base. You could\nchoose a theme because it seems interesting to you, but will this same theme appeal\nto those people you would like to see playing the game? For example, a player base\nthat is young, immature or new to MET might not appreciate (or even recognize)\na particularly subtle or complex theme. Such players might also have trouble\nseparating their appreciation for a well-constructed mood from the way they actually\nfeel when they are exposed to it. Creating a perfect mood of morbid despair with a\nstory is an impressive feat, for example, but your work won’t be worth anything if the\nplayers are too depressed by your chronicle to come back for more. As players grow\nin experience and artistic taste (should you even want them to), you can vary your\nchoice of theme and use more subtle means of evoking dramatic mood. Otherwise,\nkeep your theme basic and rely on direct action to get your mood across.\nWhen considering which genre of Mind’s Eye Theatre game to play, don’t be afraid\nto play against type in support of your theme and mood. While the core setting of a game\nmay present certain facts as gospel, you do not necessarily have to transfer these ‘facts’\nfaithfully. Rather than the standard themes of redemption or freedom that Masquerade\ngames are heir to, consider the theme of honor. What would the honorable action be\nshould a Camarilla neonate receive direct proof that the Sabbat sect is telling the truth and\nthat the Camarilla really is the tool of the eldest vampires? Playing with setting\nconventions thus is an excellent way to give existing settings great new twists, and it will\ngo a long way toward increasing excitement and interest in your chronicle.\nThe final consideration when choosing themes and moods for your chronicle\nis your logistical base. In other words, are the themes and moods that you are\nconsidering ones that can be supported by your available site and the time you will\nbe able to devote to the game? If your potential play site is a series of unfurnished\nbasement rooms, trying to evoke the regal grandeur of Renaissance Europe will\nprobably not be successful. On the other hand, if your play site is out in the middle\nof nowhere and well beneath the notice of overeager societal watchdogs, it will be\neasier to explore the theme of the consequences of growing decadent. Your site will\nencourage images in the mind of your players, and these images will determine what\nthey will bring both to their characters and to exploration of the theme and mood.\n"

The important thing to keep in mind is that themes and moods\ncan change for both good and bad reasons. It is your job as a Storyteller to\ndifferentiate between the two.\nThese changes occur for a variety of reasons, the most common of which derive\nfrom your player base. The characters in your chronicle are going to run with any\ntheme that is central to their existence, and they will eventually exhaust the central\ntheme. At this point, they will either explore related elements of different themes,\nmeld the existing theme with a new one or abandon the old theme entirely in favor\nof a completely new one. When these things happen, consider these points as a\nmeasure of the value of the change:\nIs the change player-driven or character-driven?\nA very fine line exists between these two forces, despite the fact that they both\noriginate from the same place. Character-driven change can best be described as\ndevelopment or deviation from a what you (the Storyteller) had in mind, which is\ndue to the dictates of what a player has defined as his character’s motivations. This\nsort of change in your theme is usually for the best, since it means that your chronicle\nis supporting the sort of in-depth character development that is always enjoyable.\nPlayer-driven change results when players make adjustments to their style or\nthe portrayal of their character for purely out-of-game reasons. This type of change\ncan involve either a desire to try something different or reflect a desire for an out-\nof-game result, such as playing with a different subsection of the player base. The\neffect of this kind of change on the theme and mood will usually be more abrupt and\ndirect than a character-based change, since it usually involves a fundamental\nretooling of the current character’s goals and values. This type of change is less\ndesirable than one that derives from in-game changes in the characters’ lives.\nHowever, it may also indicate that your players are not happy with the way you are\nrunning the chronicle and that they’d have more fun doing something else.\nIs the change due to dissatisfaction with the theme?\nIf your theme is changing due to player dissatisfaction with the current theme, there\nis usually very little that you can do directly or forcibly to prevent that change. If it\nhappens, talk with your players. Are they generally dissatisfied (i.e., totally sick of the way\nthings are going)? If so, work with them to develop a theme and/ or mood that they will\nenjoy playing and that you will enjoy supporting. You shouldn’t force your players to\nsuffer through a game that they don’t like, but you shouldn’t sacrifice the artistic\nsensibility with which you create your stories just because they aren’t immediate hits.\nRemember, any MET chronicle is founded on a guiding principle: People are\ncoming together to tell great stories and have a great time doing it. Getting upset\nwith each other defeats the purpose. When players and Storytellers are contentious\nwith each other out of game, the chronicle involved is in a great deal of trouble.\nSTANDARD\nTANDARD\nTANDARD\nTANDARD\nTANDARD R R R R ROLES\nOLES\nOLES\nOLES\nOLES\nThe single most important aspect of any story is the collection of characters who\npopulate it.

One could even argue that populating a large live-action\ngame with good characters is more important than making up good plots, since those\ncharacters will end up creating stories just by virtue of being themselves. For the most\npart, character quality is not even the Storyteller’s concern once the game is underway.\nThe way in which the character element of a story does concern the Storyteller,\nthough, lies in the overarching purpose that certain types of characters serve.\nIf you have had previous experience in constructing or running a small-scale\nlive-action roleplaying game, then you will already know that certain types of\ncharacters appear time and again in manifold variety. Certain types of characters are\npractically essential in a large chronicle that is just beginning. Should your players\nnot provide them, you may even need to supply these types of characters yourself in\nthe form of Narrator or Storyteller characters. Having these character archetypes in\na chronicle gives you a set of basic starting points on which to hang your plots.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E A A A A AUTHORITY\nUTHORITY\nUTHORITY\nUTHORITY\nUTHORITY\nThis character will either be the total authority of the setting (e.g., a city’s\nprince or the leader of the Garou sept), or he can be the point man and liaison for\nthe authority group (such as a representative for the Council of Nine or a visiting\nAnacreon). Regardless of his actual title or his personal power, this character\nrepresents the accepted laws and customs of the group around which your chronicle\nis centered. This is not to imply, however, that this character’s power must be great\nand terrible. Weak authority characters are perfect for a chronicle centered on a\ntheme of chaos, war or millennial disruptions.\nMany chronicles will begin with a Storyteller character in this role, but the role\nwill usually pass on to a player’s character over time, either through Storyteller\ndesign or through player action. You will likely find that your players will prefer to\nhave a one of their own in this role after a few games, since they will enjoy being able\nto support or defend a fellow player.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E O\n O O\n O\n OPPOSITION\nPPOSITION\nPPOSITION\nPPOSITION\nPPOSITION\nThe direct opposite of the authority archetype, the character who upholds the\nopposition archetype does not necessarily have to be a violent anarchist. Rather, this\nrole is intended to provide a wrinkle in the social order, one that creates questions and\nissues for the characters to deal with without plunging the setting into revolt. Unlike\nan antagonist, the opposition character is accepted on some level by the society of the\nplayer group. Opposition characters include disillusioned neonates, Hollow Ones and\nRagabash Garou. Their presence is intended to raise objections, not revolutionary\narmies. In other words, characters of the opposition tend to approve of the general\nstatus quo, but they object to the specific characters in charge of it.\nStorytellers or Narrators can portray opposition characters, but you should\nencourage the players to assume these roles. Generally speaking, players make more\nconvincing members of the opposition, since their separation from the Storyteller\ncommunity makes their arguments more convincing. Furthermore, some players\nreally enjoy playing members of the community whose quirks or philosophical\ndifferences make them stand out.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E A A A A ANTAGONIST\nNTAGONIST\nNTAGONIST\nNTAGONIST\nNTAGONIST\nEvery chronicle is going to have a need for conflict, and the outside threat posed\nby the antagonist character is the most common source of conflict in a roleplaying\nsetting.

Why? By the strictest definition of the word, each player’s\ncharacter represents a protagonist in your chronicle. That is, he pursues goals and endures\nconflict based on his own motivations. In effect, every character is the main character.\nTherefore, the antagonist archetype represents the characters that you (as a Storyteller)\nput in the players’ characters’ way to prevent them from achieving their goals. As games\nget larger and more characters get involved in your stories, the players themselves take\non the roles of antagonists as their characters come into conflict in the course of play.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E M\n M\n M\n M\n MERCHANT\nERCHANT\nERCHANT\nERCHANT\nERCHANT\nWhen large numbers of supernatural creatures group together, a desire will arise\nfor things, and the merchant character fills that need. Merchant characters are dealers\nin anything in which another character or group of characters has expressed an\ninterest. The desired things need not be physical items, although physical items such\nas weapons, armor, cell-phones, computers, limousines and meeting areas are often the\nmost desired items. The merchant most often supplies the information needs of the\ncommunity as well, either openly or in secret. Regardless of the manner in which they\ndo business, merchants will always receive payment, either in hard goods or favors.\nThe merchant role is excellent for players’ characters, due to the networking\neffect that their interactions with other players cause. Merchants create relationships\nbetween disparate groups. In a starting game, merchant characters will need some\nstarting support from the Storytellers, since they will not be able to enter game with\nthe backing necessary to set up shop otherwise.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E S S S S SOCIALITE\nOCIALITE\nOCIALITE\nOCIALITE\nOCIALITE\nPlayers who enjoy the role of the socialite are interested in the subtle interac-\ntions that occur in structured social environments, and their numbers are many.\nAs in the case of the merchant role, the socialite archetype is a role best suited for\nplayers’ characters. Unlike the merchant, however, Storyteller characters can work\nwell with players’ characters in this regard. The socialite’s player will probably want to\nwork with you on the decoration of your play site, since atmosphere is one of the great\naids for this character’s role. Working closely with the socialite’s player pays dividends,\nin that you can get a good feel for how the players are enjoying the chronicle.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E M\n M\n M\n M\n MYSTIC\nYSTIC\nYSTIC\nYSTIC\nYSTIC\nMany plot and background story elements in an MET setting have occult or arcane\ntrappings, and the mystic role is best equipped to deal with them.

As such, the temporary absence of a certain role from your game does\nnot necessarily indicate that disaster looms. However, should absences of a certain\ncharacter type develop, you might find it difficult to create certain types of plot. For\ninstance, you can’t very well tell a story about an internal play for power if you have\nno opposition characters. You can’t engender in your characters deep soul-searching\nabout the ethics of their way of life if your chronicle has no antagonist characters to\nprovide conflict.\nShould you find that your game lacks important archetypal characters and your\nplayers don’t seem willing to take up the slack, you may want to consider inserting\na Storyteller or Narrator character into the mix.

A socialite’s love of conversation and low-tension-level\ncharacter interaction will suffer in climates in which the vast majority of players are\nportraying either violent characters (such as certain versions of the opposition role) or\ncharacters who are cerebral but not talkative or sociable (such as the mystic archetype).\nSocialites who lack people with whom to socialize become bored, and roleplaying suffers.\nThey may even add to the problem by jumping ship to the same faction that is already\noverpopulated, just for the sake of interacting regularly with others.\nIt is possible that the problem will solve itself, as players move on to different\nroles and the different roles become repopulated. Should this not happen, though,\nyou should encourage players gently to diversify their roles, either through develop-\nment of existing characters or by taking on new roles. Furthermore, you may want\nto change you current plots or add new plots in order to encourage a return to a more\nbalanced atmosphere. The arrival of Storyteller or Narrator characters who have a\nsocial emphasis can restart the atmosphere that a socialite thrives in and possibly\nturn some of the attention of the players to the societal aspects of the game.\nIs your plot encouraging an unfriendly atmosphere?\nWhen the antagonist is running around with a gun in one hand and a torch in\nthe other, very few characters are going to have time to interact with the socialite.\nYour ability to set the climate of the chronicle is a powerful tool for solving\nimbalance in roles, but it very often can be the cause of that imbalance.

Luckily for you, however, Storytellers are not\nthe only providers of plot. Assuming that you have quality players in your game, you\ncan rely on them to furnish you with characters whose motivations and backgrounds\nwill either provide elements for you to work with or which are fully formed plots in\nand of themselves. However, you are not relieved of the responsibility to create a\nworld of plot for your players to interact with. After all, Storyteller plots and\ncharacter plots fulfill very different goals.\nCharacter plot and background material provides a way for a self-directed player\nto keep herself entertained over the course of several games. As such, the elements\nof these plots are self-centered. Character plots are imminently fulfilling for the\nplayer or players who created them, but they tend to lose appeal the further they grow\nfrom the characters who set them into motion. Storytellers should endeavor to tie\nthese plots into the main plot line of the game as soon as possible.\nThe characteristics of great Storyteller-generated plots are mirror images of the\ncharacteristics of character-created plots. Trying to visit a huge, world-spanning plot\nupon a small group of characters is not the way to go. Start small, with a few minor\nhints to a broad group of players. Throwing your net wide will ensure that the\nmaximum section of your game will be involved and entertained. Grow your plot\nslowly, attaching appropriate character plots to the body of your plot. Eventually,\nyou will have created a plot in which many disparate characters are involved each\nfor their own reasons with varying levels of investment at stake. Once the characters\nare motivated thus, the players will have all the more reason to roleplay and work\ntogether against the obstacles in their characters’ way.\nRESOLUTION\nESOLUTION\nESOLUTION\nESOLUTION\nESOLUTION\nAt some point, the character’s struggle to achieve his goal has to end one way\nor another. No player will wait in line indefinitely to see if his characters’ schemes\nwill ever come to fruition, and no story is truly satisfying unless it concludes. The\nsame is true even in a long-running chronicle that you hope will still have years of\nlife left in it. Players may come to live-action games simply to be characters, but\ncharacters get involved in stories in order to achieve something.\nAs a Storyteller, you must make sure that every story arc you create has some\nway to play itself out. You need not feel inclined to make sure that the players’\ncharacters always get what they want, but you must see that the struggle to get it\ncomes to a close. However, as in any novel or motion picture, a live-action story’s\nresolution must always leave room for a follow-up tale. If you can, try to end every\nstory with a question that makes the characters want to know or find out more.\nAnswer the lingering questions that arose during the story arc itself, but leave\nenough clues for the characters to realize that a whole new set of questions awaits.\nKeep your players on the hook, and they’ll keep coming back to play in your game.\n"

Your characters interact with numerous\nStoryteller characters throughout the course of the game, all of whom are filtered\nthrough the imagination and portrayal of the Storyteller.\nWhen you step into a live-action roleplaying game, however, everything\nchanges. In a tabletop chronicle, your Storyteller represents all the roles that you\nencounter, be they pivotal to the story or not. Now, it’s possible that of the dozens\nof people milling about the venue, any could be a Storyteller character, could be vital\nto your character’s plot, could be irrelevant, could be… anything. Real one-to-one\nnumbers represent the creatures of the setting, at least insofar as any given scene is\nconcerned. You’re now face-to-face with the situation, and you no longer have a\ncentral single person presenting the worldview to you.\nWe all prefer different styles of gaming. Some prefer one-shot games involving\nimmediate plots and resolutions. Some of us prefer smaller, more personal chronicles\nthat focus on the characters and their internal issues and in which the external\npolitics are merely a background to the central characters’ lives. Smaller games allow\nfor more personal interaction between Storytellers, players, plots and the rules. If\nyour chronicle consists of seven players and one Storyteller, it can be run like a\ntabletop game, describing the reactions of the World of Darkness and helping\neveryone through the challenges they perform. The feel is personal, the plots can be\ngrand and world-changing, and the mechanics of the rules can be governed by the\nconsensus of the players. In a game of this size, the Storyteller has a good idea of what\neach character is doing, and he can work on character development, personal horror\nand intriguing plot twists from each character’s past.\nCHAPTER ONE:\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n6\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nMost of us play our games for the long haul, however. We want a chronicle that\nis rich in history and a story that evolves in response to our characters’ actions. We\nwant to create something lasting and memorable that we can revisit time and again.\nBecause so many roleplayers have these desires, they share their games with each\nother, intertwine their stories and invite others to experience the interactivity of this\nhobby. The numbers in a chronicle swell, and the Storyteller has to take up the slack.\nSome Storytellers prefer to keep their chronicles small, choosing to emphasize\nintimacy and ensuring a comfortable workload for their staff and themselves. Placing\na limit on the number of players is a reasonable method of controlling the scope of\nthe game, in and out of character.\nOthers embrace the growth of the chronicle and work hard to produce the best\nroleplaying environment possible for the swelling mass of players that they must\naccommodate. Additionally, a popular chronicle may go on for years as old stories\ndevelop, characters grow and new ideas and new people keep the game fresh. Any\nStoryteller will find that tweaks to the rules and systems with which they are familiar\nwill eventually be necessary.\nAs the game grows larger, conflicts between more players subtly shift the\nchronicle away from a situation in which the Storyteller describes the World of\nDarkness to one in which the players define the World of Darkness for each other.\nEven if the ratio of Storytellers to players is the same as that of a smaller game, the\nlarger game becomes less personalized for each character. Unlike a game with one\nStoryteller and seven players, no one Storyteller can know the plans of each and\nevery character in a game with 10 Storytellers and 70 players. Many player actions\nand challenges take place beyond the view of the Storytellers in a large game. Social\ndynamics also become a factor in the 70-person game, whereas personal dynamics\nare more prominent in the seven-person game. Therefore, the psychological rules of\nplay change for everyone involved.\nTHERE\nHERE\nHERE\nHERE\nHERE B B B B BE G\n G G\n G GIANTS\nIANTS\nIANTS\nIANTS\nIANTS\nThe sheer scope of organizing a one-shot convention game, administering a\nnetwork of games or simply keeping a large chronicle going from month to month\nall have their own challenges. Mind’s Eye Theatre provides a core system for event\nresolution, basic information on genre-specific social dynamics and guidelines for\nrunning an average game. The viability of some of these guidelines weakens when\nthey are stretched to accommodate a large number of characters over an extended\nperiod of time, however.\nBY T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E N\n N\n N\n N\n NUMBERS\nUMBERS\nUMBERS\nUMBERS\nUMBERS\nThe Laws of… books have been written with a single small game in mind. Such\na game includes one or two Storytellers, a handful of Narrators and perhaps 20 to 30\nplayers in regular attendance over a few years.\nThe Storyteller’s load is still manageable at this level, but it is significant. If the\ngame has newsletters, rumor sheets, character sheets, item cards, Willpower tokens\nand other paraphernalia to hand out during each session, these routine tasks can use\nup time and resources that might be better spent on more important aspects of the\ngame, such as plot development, genre interaction and a Narrator’s character\nportrayal. The Storyteller would be wise to delegate some of these tasks to her\nNarrators or players.\nThe average number of people in any given scene is likely to remain low (less\nthan 10) for a small game, barring major gatherings such as a prince’s announcement\n\n\n7\nIntroduction\nIntroduction\nof judgment, or the arrival of visiting dignitaries. The players will tend to drift into\nand between groups, staying in smaller, more discrete numbers (coteries, clans or\npower blocs), until it is necessary for the city’s inhabitants to assemble.\nWith such small average scenes, it is much easier for players and Narrators to\nfollow rules designed to segue easily between roleplaying and so-called “ruleplaying.”\nThe detail available through the application of the Mind’s Eye Theatre rules is more\nrepresentative of in-game reality at this level. Mass challenges are likely to be\nresolved quickly, and everyone in the scene can communicate easily to resolve any\ndifficulties or confusion.\nThe regular Mind’s Eye Theatre books can stretch comfortably to accommo-\ndate a game of up to 50 to 75 players with few problems if the Storytellers and\nNarrators are capable of running the game smoothly while also handling the details\nof the game between sessions. As the size of the game expands, the Storyteller may\nfind it difficult to juggle all of the information he requires in order to maintain the\ngame (such as character sheets, status, plots, backgrounds and character goals). No\nsingle Storyteller can realistically be expected to remember everything, and keeping\nrecords becomes more and more important.\nGames usually need an administrative staff by the time they reach the 50- to 75-\nplayer mark. One Storyteller might maintain the character database while another\nhandles Influence actions throughout the month, and yet another ensures that\nnewsletters and props are ready for Saturday night. Meanwhile, a Narrator contacts\nall the players to let them know that the venue has been booked and that the game\nthis week will involve the Ventrue primogen’s deathnight celebrations. She then\nupdates the website with directions to the game and sends a copy to the group’s email\nlist. Sharing the load is a Good Thing.\nIf your game continues to grow, you’ll find that you need to adjust a few things\nsooner or later. You’ll have to tweak some internal game systems to maintain balance\nand deal with the growing administrivia, for example. Fortunately, that’s what this\nbook is here to help you do.\nBY T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E B\n B B\n B BOOK\nOOK\nOOK\nOOK\nOOK\nThe standard Mind’s Eye Theatre book emphasizes the establishment of core\nrules for playing the game. For example, Laws of the Night gives us a complete\nsystem to cover the resolution of most situations that arise in an average Mind’s Eye\nTheatre game. That book covers rules for character creation, challenge resolution,\na basic set of social structures and all the essential information you will need to run\na Mind’s Eye Theatre game. It establishes a central system around which more\ndetailed (or simplified) rules versions can be constructed, if necessary.\nExpansion books, such as the Laws of the Night Camarilla Guide and the Laws\nof the Night Sabbat Guide, are rich sources of material for developing your\nchronicle’s background, resources, antagonists and the darker side of its history.\nThese books contain rules for dealing with elders, expanded options for character\nconcepts, more details on the specific societies upon which each book focuses and\nguidelines for settings and plots. However, as helpful as these books are, they still\nfocus on a smaller game.\nThe remainder of the available background material for the World of\nDarkness can be found in White Wolf’s tabletop supplements. The various clan-\n, kith- and tribebooks provide players with more detail on the backgrounds of\ntheir character types, and they supply plenty of ideas for new characters. The\n…by Night books present plots and information suitable to the locale in\n\n\n8\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nquestion, and act as a springboard for ideas that can apply to any chronicle. Some\nsourcebooks address creatures outside the mainstream, such as mummies. Each\nhas information and misinformation that can contribute to your chronicle or\nnetwork game. Additionally, supplements such as Nights of Prophecy deal with\nthe metaplot — the overall and ongoing history of the World of Darkness as it\nhas been laid out by White Wolf.\nAs a guide for network games that follow the World of Darkness, these resources\nare invaluable. They provide a source of consistency that any chronicle can access\nto stay on the same page as its neighbors. If discrepancies arise in the flow of play in\nthe network (if the Gangrel were treated nicely, for instance, and Xavier is sitting\ndown for tea and scones with Hardestadt tomorrow evening) then the network will\nneed to make those differences known to the rest of the member chronicles. The\nmember chronicles will also need to notify intended players of these differences so\nthat, again, everyone remains on the same page.\nFor large or convention games, these sourcebooks can be used to paint the\nbackdrop of the rest of the world, if needed. External consistency is less important\nwhen your chronicle is not related to or affected by any others.\nDURABILITY\nURABILITY\nURABILITY\nURABILITY\nURABILITY\nThe Mind’s Eye Theatre books are designed to deal with short- to medium-\nterm chronicles lasting for a couple of years and in which games are held once or\ntwice a month. Usually, the chronicle will cover the development and conclusion\nof one or two major story arcs, and the overarching theme will remain constant.\nThe growth of characters over that period of time in terms of Experience Traits\nwould be within the range of 20-30 Traits, depending on the rate of play and\nadvancement. As a slice of the character’s life, the chronicle is an active and exciting\none in which the character grows and learns.\nThe chronicle would also address the growth and experience of the city in\nwhich it is set, but it is likely that such background evolution will be marked only\nas the backdrop against which the characters strut their stuff.\nIt is possible to use the regular books for long-term chronicle play, but the\naccelerated rate of character growth that derives from the standard rules can give rise\nto characters who become too powerful too quickly. Games that play frequently\n(once a fortnight, maybe more) but still award the usual one to three Experience\nTraits per game will quickly notice the disparity between the rate of growth of a\nMind’s Eye Theatre character and that of a similar tabletop character.\nInterconnected chronicle networks present their players with the opportunity\nto visit other games, and thus to earn additional Experience Traits for their\ncharacters. Storytellers must scrutinize the growth rate of those characters in\ncomparison with non-traveling characters in order to make sure that a balanced\nprogression takes place throughout the organization.\nEXPANSION\nXPANSION\nXPANSION\nXPANSION\nXPANSION\nLARPs become large around the 75-player mark. That figure is fairly arbitrary,\nbut experience has shown it to be accurate as a guideline. You may consider a game\nlarge if it hits only the 50-player mark, or you might consider a game of 200 players\nto be perfectly comfortable. As in any generalized demographic, your mileage may\nvary. The kind of games that you’d find at a convention or a gathering of chronicles\nfrom within a LARPing network may have hundreds or thousands of players, which\ncertainly places them within the large category.\n\n\n9\nIntroduction\nIntroduction\nOf course, every game has its share of casual players — those who only turn\nup occasionally, maybe only once — and those people skew the population\ncount somewhat. Players bring along their significant others to show them\nwhat they’ve been involved in on Saturday nights, but the SO might play only\na couple of times and then drop out. People also drag friends along for\nsomething to do for the evening, but those friends sometimes find that live-\naction roleplaying is not for them. Some casual gamers may or may not turn up,\ndepending on what’s on TV that night. As far as the population figures for a\nsingle ongoing chronicle go, we’re referring to regular players (i.e., those who\nattend the game 75% of the time).\nGames will grow to the aforementioned size if your local area has the gamer\npopulation to support it and if the quality of the game is such that others\nrecommend it to their friends. Some games prefer to vet potential players in\norder to ensure compatibility with their game styles. Others advertise for\ninterested individuals, and still others allow anyone to turn up to try the game.\nIn any case, players will stay if they have fun and if they see that the chronicle\nis run fairly and well. They also need to know that the staff is capable of handling\nthe necessary paperwork. In the end, remember, it’s not the size of the game that\nmatters; it’s the quality that counts.\nLARGE\nARGE\nARGE\nARGE\nARGE G G G G GAMES\nAMES\nAMES\nAMES\nAMES\nAs a chronicle matures and develops, it will attract new players, whether they\nare seasoned roleplayers, newly interested gamers or casual give-it-a-try types.\nPeople come and go as their interest waxes and wanes. A game’s population is\ntypically dynamic and ever-changing.\nSometimes, the quantity of players in a popular chronicle rises to an over-\nwhelming number. If the game rocks, the population stays high, and the Storyteller\nfinds herself with more players than she knows how to handle or entertain. Roles and\nplots expand, and the scope of the chronicle expands as well. The entire situation\nwould be a real challenge for any Storyteller to deal with.\nChronicles that enter this upward spiral will eventually encompass all levels of\ntheir chosen genre on the city scale. Players will take the roles of elders and princes,\nbishops and paladins, Garou elders or local dukes. Simultaneously, the lower\nechelons expand to encompass the underdogs, all of whom are exciting and vibrant\ncharacters in and of themselves.\nMost of the players would play “average” citizens of the genre — the neonates,\nancillae, fosterns and wilders of the area — while a few may hold positions of\nauthority in the city’s power structure. If your chronicle is large enough, you may\nhave players’ characters holding primogen positions, or even portraying the prince\nand his city officers.\nSo how does a Storyteller deal with organizing all of these people? The game\nneeds a site large enough to accommodate everyone comfortably. It needs plots that\nwill hold the interest of as many players as possible. It needs to develop sub-plots that\nwill keep the rest of the players happy as well, unless they’re comfortable dealing\nsolely with plots of their own creation.\nThese large games — let’s cement a lower boundary of 75 people to that label\n— are amazing fun when they are run well. They can also be mind-splitting\nheadaches when they are run poorly.\n\n\n10\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nNETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK G\n G G\n G GAMES\nAMES\nAMES\nAMES\nAMES\nImagine the scope of a game that encompasses not just one city and its internal\npolitical structure, but which represents the larger picture of the entire continent or\neven the globe. Imagine a chain of interconnected chronicles that encompasses and\npresents the World of Darkness and the machinations of the monsters that dwell\ntherein. Imagine a cohesive mega-chronicle of thousands of characters’ intertwining\nstories that reach around the world and in which the potential repercussions are felt\nfor years to come.\nMind-boggling? Perhaps. An administrative nightmare? Maybe. But is it\npossible? Very definitely. In fact, several such organizations already exist and have\nbeen in operation for a number of years. New groups form and grow with their own\nstyles of administration and interaction, which ensures a wide range of options for\nany isolated chronicle that might consider becoming a part of such a group.\nThese network groups consist of like-minded chronicles that have joined\ntogether to present their view of the World of Darkness to their players on a local,\nnational or global scale. Sometimes, the groups focus primarily on one genre-group,\nsuch as The Masquerade or The Shining Host. Others admit a cross-section of\ngenres, each of which exists alongside the others.\nIn a single chronicle, a Storyteller has the freedom to take his stories wherever\nhe wishes. He has complete autonomy, and the genre police are not going to come\nknocking on his door if he decides that the Camarilla finally wiped out the\nGiovanni in a fit of pique. A network, however, relies on chronicles working\ntogether to remain on the same page. Therefore, the individual chronicles must be\nprepared to sacrifice some of their autonomy in order to comply with the overall\nvision of the network.\nIndividual chronicles within the network do not have to be large, but the total\nnumber of players in a network certainly brings the count to staggering proportions.\nThousands of people worldwide share their roleplaying experiences under a commu-\nnal umbrella, knowing that the actions that they take next Saturday night might\naffect enemies and allies across the continent. The potential for interaction between\ncharacters is enormous, whether that interaction occurs via the Internet or players\nactually traveling to other member chronicles in order to further their own plots,\nmake allies and meet fellow players in person. Given the combined talents of\nhundreds of Storytellers working together, you can be sure that the games remain\ninteresting and fresh. Every chronicle can touch the next with its plots, and every\ncharacter can reach the others with his stories.\nSuch groups rely on communication, compromise and courtesy, just as any\nsmaller single chronicle does, albeit on a larger scale. Networks need a central\nsupport structure to guide members in their dealings with other chronicles. Smaller\nnetworks (which comprise only a handful of member chronicles) may be able to\noperate comfortably on a casual consensual basis, but the larger networks require a\nset of rules to deal with the administration of the networks and the interactivity of\ntheir members. An out-of-game council or committee reflects the organizational\nneeds of such groups, looking after the out-of-character maintenance that is\nnecessary for such a network to remain cohesive. In order for the communal game\nto flourish as a whole, some degree of bureaucracy is required to represent and\nmonitor the interests of the individual chronicles in the network.\nThe internal structure of these organizations varies according to the desires of\nthose within. Some networks prefer a top-down structure, in which a central\n\n\n11\nIntroduction\nIntroduction\nstorytelling team administers and directs the overall plot of the network’s chronicles,\nwhile allowing the individual chronicles to handle sub-plots. Another group may\nencourage the communal development of plots by representatives from each\nmember chronicle.\nThe Storyteller workload will vary according to the size of any individual\nchronicle within the network. The degree of involvement of the network in the\nusual maintenance of a member chronicle is minimal. The network administrators\noversee the shared and universal aspects of the World of Darkness, and they\ncoordinate their efforts with the chronicles involved as necessary.\nCONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nSome roleplayers revel in convention games, large conglomerations of people\nwho meet annually to game the heck out of whatever scenario is thrown at them.\nThese massive gatherings are usually annual affairs, drawing hundreds of players\nfrom around the world together to share their styles of gaming.\nEven smaller convention gatherings of 100-200 people can be a challenge for\na Storyteller who is accustomed to dealing with a couple dozen of his friends every\nLOCAL\nOCAL\nOCAL\nOCAL\nOCAL A A A A AR E A\nR E A\nR E A\nR E A\nR E A N\n N\n N\n N\n NETWORKS\nETWORKS\nETWORKS\nETWORKS\nETWORKS\nAn interesting subset of the network arises when a multi-genre chronicle’s\npopulation grows too large. The split-genre local network consists of a series\nof games run in parallel in the same setting, one game for each genre (i.e.,\nsupernatural creature type). Each game has a specialized set of Storytellers,\nand the Storytellers from each of the games meet regularly to govern cross-\nchronicle interactions.\nTheoretically, minimal cross-genre interaction should occur on a player\nlevel, so the major interaction would occur through the effects that the\ncharacters have on their environment. Most types of characters can have the\nInfluence Background, so any individual can affect the Influence of another\ncreature in the same city directly. The responsibility of sorting out these\ninteractions falls upon the Storytellers, who resolve the interactions and report\nthe results back to the players affected.\nIt is very possible that players may play different characters in several or all\nof these games, and policies must be made to deal with the potential of\noverlapping interest or plots with these characters. Players of multiple charac-\nters should be able to separate the information and plots of each of their\ncharacters, but at times a conflict of interest may arise.\nIf these games are in violent contention (in character) with each other,\nthen interaction may be more immediate, and rules of engagement on an out-\nof-character level may need to be resolved by the collective Storytellers. Is it\nacceptable for the werewolf characters to kill other players’ vampire charac-\nters during the day if they know where the vampires in question sleep? What\nsort of impact will direct conflict have on the flow of the individual chronicles\nand the entire network? Is it okay to wipe out a chronicle for reasons of genre?\nWell, no, it’s not. Players should know better and plan more nefarious and fun\nways of dealing with their opponents. Conflict between two characters is\ncommon, and it can be dealt with easily. Conflict between two species is to\nbe avoided unless you really enjoy hours of challenges and dealing with\nembittered players in the aftermath.\n\n\n12\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nthird Saturday of the month. The logistics of pre-registering hundreds of players,\ncreating or vetting a similar number of characters and finding venues and accommo-\ndations adds a considerable amount of work to the usual duties that a Storyteller\nwould perform in the course of a smaller game.\nStories for convention games often focus on a singular event or series of\nevents, the background for which is outlined for the players when they arrive at\nthe game. Similarly, the characters in play are generated by the convention staff,\nrather than being the players’ regular characters. These one-shot events allow\nplayers to exercise their acting skills in different roles than those they may be\naccustomed to in their regular game.\nNetworks may also hold their own convention-style gatherings — conclaves\nor moots or simply Halloween or Christmas gatherings — in which they invite\nmembers to bring their regular characters together. These conventions help build\nthe sense of community within the network, and they can serve to play out pivotal\nevents in the network’s own metaplot. Due to their origins in the network, the\ncohesive nature of these games makes the game easier for the Storytellers in terms\nof constructing plot and characters. These conclaves will already be rife with\naction from ongoing inter-chronicle plots, as well as personal character rivalries\nand alliances. The workload decreases due to the valuable assistance of Storytell-\ners from other chronicles who can help with a number of matters.\nStand-alone conventions are a lot of hard work (and we’ll discuss them further\nin the next chapter), but they are very rewarding if all goes well.\nLESS\nESS\nESS\nESS\nESS C C C C COMMON\nOMMON\nOMMON\nOMMON\nOMMON I I I I ITERATIONS\nTERATIONS\nTERATIONS\nTERATIONS\nTERATIONS\nISOLATED\nSOLATED\nSOLATED\nSOLATED\nSOLATED C C C C CHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nAlmost the inverse of a network, an isolated chronicle draws in players from\nneighboring areas because it is the only game in a large area due to either geographic\nor demographic concerns. In a vast but sparsely populated area, players are unlikely\nto live near each other, and would probably travel to a central location to play.\nA considerable amount of communication is necessary for a widespread but\ncentralized game to remain cohesive, and the Storytellers will need to be adept\norganizers. Available transportation and ease of travel may be a concern in some\nplaces, and those in the isochronicle will assist each other as much as possible to\ngather for the game.\nIf the interest (and therefore, population) in the game continues to grow, then\nan isochronicle may evolve into a network. This occurs when players who live near\neach other form their own games once their numbers grow to a level which they can\nsupport a chronicle in their specific area.\nONLINE\nNLINE\nNLINE\nNLINE\nNLINE C C C C CHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nWhile they are not the focus of this book, a number of online World of Darkness\ngames have been playing for quite some time and have amassed a large number of\nplayers. While this style of game is not a live-action game per se, a huge number of\npeople are often involved in the chronicle, and many of the organizational and\nnetworking matters that come up in this book may be of interest.\nMost of these games revolve around email and require access to the Internet,\nso they will already be set up in terms of communications. Players in this type of game\nwill be familiar with the concepts of e-scenes (in-character scenes that play out over\nemail or chat programs). As an alternative to a tabletop or live-action game, online\n\n\n13\nIntroduction\nIntroduction\ngames can be a lot of fun. They also proceed at your leisure, rather than relying on\nconsensual meeting times.

They tell stories of a group that is separate from the main parent, but these\ngames can quickly blossom into independent chronicles. Spin-off games sometimes\narise after a large multi-genre game splinters into smaller single-genre fragments, but\nthey maintain a network-style consistency of setting. A larger game may separate\ninto several neighboring smaller games (which are either networked or separate),\nwhile maintaining the shared history of the earlier chronicle. Another permutation\nis an intimate regular game involving only a handful of players from the parent game\nwho meet separately, but follow the same continuity as the original game.\nEpilogues or aftershocks are games that sometimes stem from convention\ngames, portraying the aftermath in the lives of the convention characters. Some-\ntimes players meet at a convention and decide to resume playing the characters that\nthey were given to play at the event. Players may wish to continue exploring these\ncharacters after a chronicle officially ends.\nParallel games usually arise when a group of players splits into two factions over\na difference in style preference. The overall plot and history of the resulting parallel\ngames remain the same, but each game may take a different path. As with a spin-off,\nthis type of game may arise due to a split-up of a multi-genre chronicle. Parallel games\nare not usually networked, and they share little other than a common background.\nIN FOR\nFOR\nFOR\nFOR\nFOR THE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE D\n D D\n D\n DURATION\nURATION\nURATION\nURATION\nURATION\nA long-running game can be defined as one that has run regularly over an\nextended period of time. Okay, that’s nicely vague, without actually giving any\ndefinitive reference points. Let’s clarify.\nHow often does a game have to run to be considered “regular”? You may play\nyour LARP monthly, fortnightly or every full moon. Your LARP may also be an\nannual event that continues the story and plots from the previous year. You might\neven play constantly throughout the week.\nThe duration and frequency of your game will have a marked impact upon its\ngrowth and development. A regular game ensures a consistency of characteriza-\ntion and permits a sense of tangible transition as the protagonists and their\nenvironment change.\nThink of an annual chronicle as a series of feature films, with recurring\ncharacters and evolving plots. The same characters appear and take action, and large\ngaps in time occur between each gathering. Annual chronicles deal with monumen-\ntal events in the existences of these characters’ lives. An annual chronicle maintains\na consistent background and allows for considerably more detailed story work to be\ndone by the staff between the actual games. Meticulous care can be taken to maintain\ntheme, mood, plot, story consistency and quality, and back-stories can be written to\nupdate the players on their characters’ activities throughout the intervening\n\n\n14\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\ndowntime. Some danger of distancing players from their characters exists, since the\nplayers are not interacting regularly as their characters. Additionally, it may be\ndifficult for some players to attend annually, so absent players’ characters may have\nto be played by other people, which causes disparity in the consistency of character-\nization from one year to the next.\nYou can overcome some of these challenges by ensuring that the character\nportfolio that you present to the players is comprehensive and that it includes strong\nroleplaying guidelines. A few convention games follow an annual story, but it is more\ncommon for a convention game to be a one-shot game rather than a chronicle.\nSome chronicles run super-intensively, covering the actions of the characters\non an ongoing basis, and allowing for detailed (and possibly painful) roleplaying\nacuity. The “24/7” chronicle is a very active style in which players are potentially in\ncharacter at any time of the day or (in a Masquerade setting) night. You may\nencounter another player’s character at the local convenience store or at the movies,\nor you can receive phone calls to deal with plot issues at any hour.\nIf such a game is to last more than a few weeks, the storytelling team must\ndevelop methods for dealing with the rate of earning Experience Traits, resolving\nconflicts in the absence of a Storyteller, standards of public play and display, how\nto tell if a player is in or out of character and long-distance storytelling commu-\nnications. Most importantly, the players and the Storytellers need to learn how to\ndeal with roleplaying overload. A game that requires essentially total immersion\ncan take a toll on a player’s everyday life. Remember to keep a reasonable\nperspective and a sense of reality.\nA normal chronicle runs once, maybe twice a month — possibly as often as\nweekly. Our heroes are caught in summary without an in-depth exposition of their\ndaily routine, but in enough detail that we can appreciate their developing\npersonalities from month to month. We know that the characters are not\nconstantly at Elysium or the caern, and we can appreciate that the gatherings that\nthey have with the others of their kind in the city are sporadic occurrences rather\nthan the norm of an evening.\nThe long-running or stabilized chronicle can be identified by a number of\ncommon elements. It has been in regular play for well over a year, and it has\nestablished a strong set of house interpretations of the published Mind’s Eye\nTheatre rules. A communications network (email lists and/or phone numbers) is in\nplace, and people are responsible for overseeing and maintaining it. Regular game\nsites have been found, and a set of protocols for dealing with incoming new players\nhas been developed. The Storytellers have probably changed at some point,\nalthough some of the original members may still be in their original position. It’s\nlikely that players have moved up to fill Narrator and Storyteller positions, and the\nchronicle has worked out a way to deal with such transitions. In other words, the hard\nwork has been done, and the chronicle can settle in for the long haul. As long as the\nstories remain fresh and interesting and the staff is prepared to handle the workload,\nthere is no reason why a chronicle cannot continue for many years.\nGROWING\nROWING\nROWING\nROWING\nROWING P\n P\n P\n P\n PAINS\nAINS\nAINS\nAINS\nAINS\nAny game that plays regularly for a long time will evolve. Themes and moods\nthat were explored at the start of the chronicle may no longer be applicable to the\nongoing plot arcs, perhaps due to the actions of characters or because the plots that\npointed up those themes and moods have been resolved. The departure of regular\nplayers and the arrival of new people can change the face of the chronicle. An\n\n\n15\nIntroduction\nIntroduction\nongoing chronicle becomes a living entity to some extent. As the sum of the\ncontributions of everyone involved, the flow of the game will change depending\nupon those contributions.\nTHEME\nHEME\nHEME\nHEME\nHEME\nYour theme doesn’t have to vary from month to month, but it may do so. As a\nStoryteller, you will need to decide whether you will allow the characters to\ndetermine the theme and mood, or whether your subtle manipulations of plot, story\nand Storyteller characters will maintain the prevailing feel of the game. You and your\nteam of Storytellers and Narrators can influence the atmosphere in a variety of ways.\nWith a large long-running game, multiple themes can arise, and it\nbecomes difficult with so many different characters (each with their own\nmotivations and goals) to maintain a strong predominant theme. It’s possible\nthat every theme that has ever been mentioned in a White Wolf book is in use\nat any one time to some degree as the players take control of the action and\nswing the chronicle into areas that the Storytellers had not considered.\nEnthusiastic players will have their own ideas about how the theme of a\nchronicle affects their characters, and their roleplaying will shape the overall\ntheme and mood of the chronicle in due course.\nIf a predominant theme of chaos, for example, kick-starts the chronicle — the\nprevious prince has been murdered, and the city must re-establish order — then\neventually the chaos will subside as the characters find a new prince and stabilize the\nCamarilla presence. While this story arc is fine for a one-shot or short-term game,\nthat predominant theme will pass its use-by date very quickly in a long-running\nchronicle, and another theme must be introduced or developed. However, with the\nexit of one theme comes the entrance of another, and the motivations of the\ncharacters will likely shape the theme of the next game. If one vampire becomes\nprince to the detriment of another, revenge may be the next theme. If the choice is\nunpopular, rebellion may become the flavor of the month.\nHISTORY\nISTORY\nISTORY\nISTORY\nISTORY\nEvery event in a game becomes a slice of the chronicle’s communal story. All\nthe characters contribute to it, whether they do so as pivotal main characters, foils,\nsupporting roles or cameos. The history of the chronicle continues from the jump-\noff point that the Storytellers provided initially, and the game then grows in its own\nunique direction.\nAs a game ages, it is fun to look back over the prior months or years and\nsummarize the turning points in various characters’ development. Amusing anec-\ndotes, rumors and tall tales all shape the history of any community, and the collation\nof these memories gives the game a stronger sense of depth with each passing year.\nThe players are acquainted more intimately with the major story that they have\nconstructed — the story of the world in which their characters exist.\nA common phenomenon among players of a chronicle that helps keep the\nhistory of a game alive is the telling of “war stories” — remembrances of events in\ngames past. As with traditional storytelling, this verbal sharing of events can\neducate new players in important events in the setting’s history and give them an\nidea of the style of chronicle they are playing. The stories are typically of the, “No\nshit, there I was…” variety, and they are biased from the character’s point of view;\nbut then what first-person view of any history wasn’t biased by the observer? Much\nof the World of Darkness information in various tabletop books is biased from the\n\n\n16\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\npoint of view of the “writer,” and disparate views of the “true history” are common.\nListeners are welcome to have their own opinions on the validity of any reiteration\nof events past.\nHaving said that, a number of chronicles do keep records of their games’\nhistories with some degree of accuracy so that new players (and old-timers) can gain\na sense of the development of the chronicle over time.\nNE W\nE W\nE W\nE W\nE W P\n P\n P\n P\n PLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nAs a game grows, it must develop strategies for dealing with new players,\nwhether those players are experienced roleplayers or complete novices. A new\nplayer’s unfamiliarity with the nuances of your chronicle can disrupt the smooth flow\nof roleplaying your regulars have come to expect.\nTraining novices can absorb a considerable amount of time, although the\nmajority of their learning will occur as they play the game. They need to learn at\nleast the basics of the genre and setting of the game, as well as some of the parlance,\nhow to handle simple challenge situations and how to interact with the other\ngamers. A non-roleplayer’s first time at a LARP can be a very daunting experience,\nand these new players will benefit from some careful attention and mentoring. If\nthe inexperienced player is inundated with information and thrown to the wolves,\nhe may not have a very rewarding experience, and he may not return. You lose\nmore players that way….\nExperienced tabletop players may be old hands at roleplaying, but they have\nnever been in a LARP or in a World of Darkness game, they may need training in\nthe new rules and systems. They also need to be brought up to speed on the setting,\nnetwork protocols and any other situations that are particular to your chronicle. Any\nplayer who presents herself to your chronicle thinking that she already knows\neverything may have a good background in other people’s games and her own\ninterpretations of the rules or genre. However, she needs to be aware that she is\nentering your unique chronicle, with its own variations and expected behaviors.\nAn established chronicle should have systems in place to deal with incoming\nplayers, perhaps including training sessions (“Kindredgarten”) to introduce them to\nthe various aspects of the game. Even experienced players in your own chronicle may\nbenefit from such education. The more familiar your players are with your interpre-\ntation of the World of Darkness, the higher the quality of roleplaying you can expect\nfrom them will be. If people are well-trained in the rules systems you use, the burden\non your Storytellers and Narrators is less, since your players are more self-sufficient\nin resolving challenges or rules disputes.\nMAJOR\nAJOR\nAJOR\nAJOR\nAJOR C C C C CHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nOrganizing any large game will naturally be prone to challenges that are more\nintense or time-intensive than those of smaller games.

What sort of things will you need to consider when planning\na convention? How does a network determine its structure and rules? There’s a lot\nmore to running a large game than initially meets the eye, and most of the work that\nmust be done occurs behind the scenes. The following chapter explores these areas\nof concern in greater detail.\n\n\n17\nIntroduction\nIntroduction\nNUTS\nUTS\nUTS\nUTS\nUTS AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND B B B B BOLTS\nOLTS\nOLTS\nOLTS\nOLTS\nThe goal of the Mind’s Eye Theatre system is to help players have fun\nroleplaying and acting out stories. In larger games, some categories of rules begin to\nfray, and sometimes the rules won’t fit the situation. House rules and spot-rules may\nbe suitable for a smaller-scale game, but they may also cause confusion among a mass\nof visiting players who are not familiar with your personal style. Can you avoid half-\nhour time stops while a whole room attempts to see through a Nosferatu’s Obfuscate?\nWhat happens when a character attempts to spend Influence across a network to\naffect a member chronicle located several states away? And just how do you run a 10-\nsecond mob combat without stopping the game for an hour and a half? Chapter\nThree answers these questions and collects some of the disparate basic information\nthat has appeared in various Mind’s Eye Theatre books thus far.\nPLOTS\nLOTS\nLOTS\nLOTS\nLOTS\nIs a story that entertains seven people interesting enough to entertain 70\npeople? How do you involve everyone in a story when you don’t even know everyone\nat the game by name?

What basic story\nelements do you need to provide the players in order for them to do just that? Chapter\nFour answers these questions.\n\n\n18\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\n\n\n19\nLogistics\nLogistics\nPR E\nR E\nR E\nR E\nR E- G\n- G\n- G\n- G\n- GAME\nAME\nAME\nAME\nAME I I I I ISSUES\nSSUES\nSSUES\nSSUES\nSSUES\nSay you’re organizing a huge game. Your players are champing at the bit to turn up and\ntell larger stories than they’ve imagined before, and you’ve come up with the killer plot for\nthe chronicle. But you’ll need to sort out a few mundane details before you even get to the\ngame itself. These details comprise the kind of irritating stuff that obstructs your creativity,\nstifles your plotting and crunches into your characterization time. Don’t ignore them,\nhowever. The more attention you devote to these elements, the better your large game\nexperience will be, especially if you want your huge game to rock the players’ world.\nCHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER C C C C CREATION\nREATION\nREATION\nREATION\nREATION\nIn small LARPs, the players can select what they want to play within the\nStoryteller’s comfort zone. In networks, a degree of compromise is required to\nbalance the playing field for all the chronicles involved. In large games, the present\npopulation will have a bearing on the choices that are available to a player.\nBecause the players and Storytellers in a seven-person game are able to negotiate and\ndefine the entire world themselves, character creation and setting are very different from\na game that incorporates many cities. When 100 players are involved, the established ratios\nin the World of Darkness play a role in character creation. The conventions of the genre\nstart to unravel when the Lasombra antitribu outnumber the Brujah two-to-one. The World\nof Darkness source material gives indications of the likelihood of X character type being\npresent in any given setting, and these guidelines should be followed to preserve the genre.\nFor example, the appearance of the Harbingers of Skulls has doubtless led to\nplayers asking for access to them as a new and unique character type. The tabletop\nGuide to the Sabbat suggests that Harbingers are most suitable as Storyteller\ncharacters, due both to their strangeness and their rarity. While a Sabbat-based\nchronicle may have a stronger argument for the presence of such beings, the tabletop\nbooks clarify that their presence within the Sabbat is still small and that the Harbingers\n“are all at least eighth generation, and hundreds (if not thousands) of years old.”\nFrom the same source material, the Kiasyd interact rarely with other vampires,\nand they devote their time to contemplation and research. Such an existence makes\nCHAPTER TWO:\nLOGISTICS\n\n\n20\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nthem a poor choice for a live-action game, except perhaps as a Storyteller character\nmentor or sage whom the characters may encounter eventually.\nWould you expect to see a changeling in an Elysium? Not for very long, unless they\nintend to be overcome by Banality. Then there’s the tradition of the Masquerade to\nconsider. Use some common sense when deciding what characters you will allow in your\nchronicle, especially when it comes to cross-genre concepts. Werewolves and vampires do\nnot play nicely in the sandbox together, despite the common misconception that\nwerewolves are cozy with the vampires of Clan Gangrel. How many Corax or Bastet are\nacceptable at a caern? If you are running a multi-genre chronicle, you may need to stretch\nthe conventions of each genre a little to allow for these exceptions. If you are in a stand-\nalone game, this choice is a personal issue for the chronicle. If you are in a network, then\nyou must establish the compromise level in line with the worldview shared by the network.\nHow many elder-class characters will you allow in your chronicle? If you already have\n15 elders in a 70-player game and another player presents you with his new eighth-generation\nTremere from 13th-century France, can you justify allowing another elder into play? Genre-\nbased demographics again can assist as a guideline. If you prefer a glib, face-saving line, try,\n“Too many officers, not enough grunts.” In order for your game to portray a reasonably\naccurate representation of the Jyhad, the Methuselahs have to have someone to toy with, the\nelders need someone to manipulate, and the ancillae need someone to kick around. Is it vital\nto the concept that the character’s generation be that low? Some Storytellers may prefer that\ntheir players alternate their characters’ relative power levels when they switch from one\ncharacter to the next. In such an arrangement, not only is the potential for power shared\namong the players, it also allows the individual player to experiment with different levels of\nthe political dynamics and expand his roleplaying capacity.\nYou should also consider the background and outlooks of the character concept\nas they are presented to you and balance the suitability of the personality type with\nthe personality demographics that are already present within the chronicle. If you\nalready have half a dozen Brujah bikers, do you need another one? Why not make\nthe biker a rebellious Ventrue neonate? You’ve added a totally cool character twist\nright off the bat. The archetypes of the clans and tribes allow for an incredible degree\nof versatility in their membership, and it can be tiresome to reinforce the stereotypes\nconstantly. The flip side of this concern is that you do need to make sure that the\nstereotype is maintained before the exception becomes the rule and all your\nincoming Ventrue characters are gum-snapping street-rats.\nAny aspect of a character concept can be altered slightly to create a distinctive\npersonality. While it is certainly easier for a new player to dive into an archetype,\nmore experienced players should be able to come up with interesting variances from\nthe norm that still conform to the common expectations.\nSETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nSimilarly, any deviation from the actual place and time in which the players are\ninvolved has to be explained meticulously to large groups. This is especially true if you\nplay your game in an environment that is not identical to the in-game location.\nImagine the out-of-play disaster that happens when the group patrolling the park\naccidentally comes into the same play area as the group hunting in the forest, and it\ntakes several rounds to figure out that the groups are not in the same place in character.\nIn a large game, you will probably have reached the demographic limit of your\nsupernatural population unless you’re living in a major city. For the Camarilla, the\nMasquerade demands a low-impact presence. The common ratio is one Kindred to 100,000\nmortals, so seven million people could support a population of roughly 70 vampires as long\n\n\n21\nLogistics\nLogistics\nas the vampires took extra care to keep a low profile. If only a few hundred thousand people\nlive in your town, then you should theoretically only have a handful of Kindred present.\nSome games basing their chronicles on the town in which they play embellish\nthe in-game mortal population in order to accommodate more vampires. The World\nof Darkness is more populous and more sprawled than our reality, and a population\nboost of the faceless masses shouldn’t stretch a player’s imagination farther than it\nalready has been stretched to play a vampire in the first place.\nYou will also need to consider how much larger that decision makes the city in terms\nof geography. You’ll want to consider drawing up a new map based on the expanded\nnumbers. Where are the schools and hospitals to support these additional people? How\nhas this expansion affected the economy of the region? Extrapolation of your current real-\nlife setting should provide you with most of the answers to these questions, but you’ll need\nto have that information when your players want to start throwing Influence about.\nActually, Influence is another factor that you’ll need to consider, especially if it is\nan important point of conflict between the characters in your chronicle. How much is\nnow available due to the enlarged population? How high are the standards of leadership\nand law enforcement? Even if you do not have an expanded populace, consider how\nmuch of the Influence available in the city is taken up by the characters, and how much\nmay be in the hands of mortals or other Storyteller characters. A city is not an ever-\nexpanding resource that gains an additional three Traits of Church Influence just because\nanother Tremere arrived in town. If you choose to place a limit on Influence, then you\nwill need to tell players who join the game that you are doing so.\nIf your city setting has been addressed in any of the World of Darkness books,\nare you using the same information as is written, or have you altered certain pertinent\npieces of history or public knowledge that need to be clarified for someone who might\nhave read the source material? Is your Baltimore still a Camarilla city? Perhaps the\nVentrue truly rule your Las Vegas?\nThe chronicle should develop an information package to inform visitors and\nnew players of the notable differences between the real-life city setting and the\nsetting, as their characters will perceive it.\nALTERNATIVE\nLTERNATIVE\nLTERNATIVE\nLTERNATIVE\nLTERNATIVE P\n P\n P\n P\n POPULATION\nOPULATION\nOPULATION\nOPULATION\nOPULATION C C C C CONTROL\nONTROL\nONTROL\nONTROL\nONTROL\nIf you prefer to keep the city’s size within reasonable limits, but you also\nwish to have a large player base, remember that players can have an equally\nrewarding game playing ghouls or kinfolk. Having them do so also promotes the\ninternal hierarchical structures of the creatures in the World of Darkness and\ndevelops a darker mood for the chronicle.\nSure, it might suck that your character can’t get kewl powerz and stuff and\nyou can die really easily, but with clever play, you can develop a character that\ncan challenge the more powerful supernatural creatures on a different playing\nfield. So you’re the legal advisor to the Ventrue Whip? How might she reward you\nif you can use your Bureaucracy Influence to tie the hands of an opposing Kindred,\nespecially if you do it before she realizes that it needs to be done? Perhaps you’re\nworking for the Setites, and you can lay your hands on better dope than they can.\nPlayers, why limit yourself to playing blood-sucking creatures of the night,\nwhen the day can be your playground, and you still get Potence? Or rather, why\nnot consider a more dynamic character than a stuck-in-time predator? Con-\nsider the potential for drama that is inherent in playing a servitor who both\nloves and loathes the monster who grants them eternal youth… for a price.\n\n\n22\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nNETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK C C C C CONSIDERATIONS\nONSIDERATIONS\nONSIDERATIONS\nONSIDERATIONS\nONSIDERATIONS\nNetworks require an even higher level of attention to initial characters and setting. Rules\nfor character-type distribution, setting variations and using places that are not in any of the\nparticipating cities have to be worked out between all the Storytellers in all the chronicles.\nNetworks must develop policies to deal with these sorts of issues before they arise.\nA unified view of the genre will assist in determining acceptable character-entry\nlevels of power or rarity. If the network has established that the Ravnos antediluvian\nhas not died in India yet, then Clan Ravnos may be a freely accessible choice. If he has\ndied, and the clan was decimated as per the World of Darkness setting, then the\nnetwork may choose to restrict access to that clan since only a hundred or so are\nsupposedly left on Earth. Similarly, if the network decides that characters should be\nlimited to a specific power level (for example, a maximum of eighth generation, or 200\nExperience Traits), then that decision must apply across the board.\nHow will you handle the exchange and manipulation of Influence between\nnetworked chronicles? The Fame Background gives some basic ground rules for how\nthis sort of interaction could be handled, but you will need to be ready for the\npossibility of people manipulating Influence that has already been taken by other\ndenizens. If no Street is left to tweak, whose toes will get stepped on if a neighboring\nGlasswalker decides to help out his buddies with some loaned Influence?\nStorytellers are advised to avoid making major decisions about how their plots affect\nplaces that are not within their geographical area of jurisdiction, in case a game in that area\ndecides to join the network. It is terribly embarrassing when a new city joins a multi-city\nchronicle with a great background only to find out that the new city was a radiation zone\nin the existing chronicle. If you do need to do something external to your chronicle, bring\nit up with the others of your network and make a communal decision to determine a “safe”\nplace for the external event to occur. What are the chances that the other chronicles might\npick up the plot and run alongside you with it? Pretty good, since you’re all on the same team.\nCHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER B\n B B\n B BACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nWhile a strong character background is important in any chronicle, a network\nprovides wonderful opportunities for further cross-chronicle interaction through char-\nacters in different cities sharing aspects of their backgrounds. If a character originates in\nSaint Louis, and your network has a member chronicle there, then elements of that\nchronicle’s setting should be reflected in the character’s own past. Rather than having\nto create a background from whole cloth, the player can use highlights from events in the\nchronicle’s past to enrich the character’s viewpoints and history.\nFor vampire characters, the opportunities abound to create detailed and structured lineages\nthat can interlink chronicles through broods. Considerable depth can be added to a character\nif the vampire has a solid line of Kindred to look back on for examples. This is especially true for\nfamilial clans, such as the Ventrue and Giovanni. It opens up possibilities for interaction on a\nwider scale instantly if the lineage relates characters in several chronicles. Although those\ncharacters need not be the best of friends, or even loosely allied, a thread still binds them, and\nit can be plucked by the clever Storyteller to increase the drama in the network.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E G\n G G\n G GAME\nAME\nAME\nAME\nAME S S S S SITE\nITE\nITE\nITE\nITE\nOne of the largest and most immediate problems you may face in the ongoing\nadministration of your large game will be finding a place to accommodate everyone.\nYou can hold a smaller game at someone’s house, at the park or at a friendly nightclub\nor cafeteria. Cramming a couple hundred caped carnivores into such a place may be\nstretching the realms of plausibility, however.\n\n\n23\nLogistics\nLogistics\nWH A T\nH A T\nH A T\nH A T\nH A T T O\nT O\nT O\nT O\nT O L L L L LO O K\nO O K\nO O K\nO O K\nO O K F F F F FO R\nO R\nO R\nO R\nO R\nA site for a large game needs multiple rooms for private meetings, centralized halls\nfor assemblies, outside areas for a bit of fresh air (and to allow your smokers some\nbreathing room), just like a smaller chronicle’s game site does. The site must be large\nenough to handle your volume of players, yet small enough so the storytelling and\nnarrating team isn’t running the equivalent of a half-marathon each night. Consider\nconvention halls, hotels or large nightclubs. And yeah, it’s probably going to cost some.\nFinding a site that will be suitable for your chronicle will take some legwork, but\nyou’re best to start off letting your fingers do some walking. The phonebook is a great\nplace to start, and it costs less than bus fare or gas. Check for hotels, rental\naccommodation, clubs, convention centers, camping grounds, parks, schools, enter-\ntainment venues, theatres, anyplace that might be able to handle the number of\npeople that you anticipate attending. Your local city council may be able to help, and\nit may have personnel on staff to deal with just such matters.\nWhile you’re looking for a game site, you will definitely benefit from drawing\nupon the knowledge and experience of your players and staff. Someone may know\nof a place that might be suitable or know someone who knows. Perhaps they even\nknow whom to contact for costs, availability and capacity.\nBy the way, this exercise also increases your area knowledge of your hometown,\nwhich makes it a very useful research method for locations, areas of importance and\nlikely targets of story focus for your chronicle if it is based there.\nSELECTING\nELECTING\nELECTING\nELECTING\nELECTING L L L L LOCATIONS\nOCATIONS\nOCATIONS\nOCATIONS\nOCATIONS\nNow that you’ve selected a handful of prime sites, check them out in person.\n(Don’t just throw away all your options except the one that has the most Gothic-\nPunk name.) Make an appointment with the site’s staff to walk over the site during\nthe day so that you can get a feel for the room and accessibility. A venue will always\nfeel smaller at night, but if it’s small from the outset, it will feel stifling and cramped.\nCheck the place out at night as well, if you intend to play during the darker hours.\nIs the site one big hall? A bonus for crowd scenes, but it’s not so wonderful if it’s\nthe only room you have. It is very hard to run a large game in one open room due to\nthe noise level, if nothing else. Look for enough space to hold two thirds of your\nplayers comfortably in the main hall, and enough space in other rooms to accommo-\ndate two thirds as well. If you have extra space, consider it a bonus. Treasure it. Silent,\ndeserted areas of large premises beg for covert scenes.\nKeep an eye on ambience and layout. Dormitory-style rooms connected by long\ncorridors produce a different mood than partitioned offices. A theater has a different\nroom structure than a hotel. Consider where your props and/ or background music\nwill be best suited and which rooms will lend themselves to the various moods you\nmay wish to engender in your players during the game.\nAsk which aspects of the premises you may be able to modify and what built-in facilities\nmight be used. It is unlikely that a venue used regularly by a number of different groups will\nallow you to redecorate to any great extent. If you can get permission to twist out a few light\nbulbs, however, or even use the PA system for the authority figure’s announcements, then you\nhave another set of setting tools for your Storyteller team. Always ask before burning candles,\nhowever. The site’s fire standards may prohibit their use, or their sprinkler system may be very\nsensitive. After all, nothing dampens a game like… well, okay.\nAccessibility will be another concern. Make sure that you can give easy\ndirections to your players when you notify them of where the site is. Keep an eye out\nfor quick routes from major roads, and note nearby landmarks that will assist in\n\n\n24\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nnavigation, such as parks, monuments or large buildings. Also identify other\nimportant local conveniences, such as the closest gas station and the local late-night\ncafé for the inevitable after-game coffee and chat.\nIf you are expecting disabled players to show up, make sure that they will be able\nto move about freely. If you have young players, check the host’s policy on their\npresence. Check to see if any insurance matters must be dealt with in the rental of the\npremises, or whether the rental fee covers that cost. As with any contractual\nagreement, know your responsibilities and your rights. Consult a lawyer if you have to.\nPrivacy is always a concern, and you should cast an eye toward the neighbors when\nselecting your game site. It may be beneficial to check with the owners of the venue to find\nout what the patrons of the neighboring premises might think if it looks at all likely that\nthey may take note of the game. Your primary ally remains communication, and it will be\nworthwhile to talk with those neighbors if you think that they’ll be concerned. You do not\nneed the local authorities casting baleful glares over your activities because an uninformed\nwitness is alarmed by the strange events he has seen taking place next door.\nFinally, consider the cost of rentals. If you can get the place free, that’s all good, but\nit’s likely that you’ll have to shell out. How you work out payment is really up to you and\nbeyond the scope of this book. We might suggest considering forming your game into an\nincorporated club, but your game will need to find out what is required by local laws. If\nit’s for a one-shot event (like a convention), then we seriously suggest financial advice.\nMAINTENANCE\nAINTENANCE\nAINTENANCE\nAINTENANCE\nAINTENANCE\nIf you have an ongoing large game, then you’re likely to want to hang on to the\nideal venue you’ve found. You will need to consider the viewpoint of the host or\nlandlord. On one hand, he’s ensuring the booking of his venue on a regular basis. On\nthe other hand, he may have others who want to reserve the venue for the same nights\nyou planned to play. Be prepared to negotiate such matters, and schedule your games\naround his timetable as much as possible. Is there a difference between Friday and\nSaturday for you and your players? How about the third Saturday instead of the first?\nAre Sundays an option? Be flexible, and you will find your host flexible in return.\nYou’ll also need to be prepared to explain your hobby to this person who has no\nidea of what you’re up to. While a convention of strangely dressed people throwing\narcane hand signals at each other may be a mild social blip as a once-off, regular\noccurrences of such behavior may draw some concern from the management. You’re\nbetter off explaining what you’re involved in so they and their staff understand what\nyou’re into is just a game. Heck, some of them might even want to join in now and then.\nEncourage your players to respect the property. If the management doesn’t want\npeople leaving cigarette butts scattered around the premises, make sure that the smokers\npick up after themselves or use the appropriate receptacles. Don’t allow players to go\nthrough “Staff Only” doors. Try to leave the place cleaner than it was when you arrived.\nRemember that your hosts don’t have to rent to you, and you don’t want to have to go\nlooking for another place too often if you can help it. Actually, this little piece of rocket\nscience goes for any game at any venue. If you want to use the place again, look after it.\nAll games should observe a kind of out-of-character Masquerade when it comes to\ndealing with the non-playing public. One of the primary rules of Mind’s Eye Theatre is Be\nMindful of Others. This rule becomes ultimately important when you have 400 Gothic-Punk\ncharacters in everything from leather to lace milling about. Be aware that you are not just\nresponsible for the reputation of the game, but also the reputation of the venue. The owners\nmake their living from the property. To have it devalued due to the foolish antics of a few\nmisbehaving players can be disastrous to their cash flow. It may also lose you your site.\n\n\n25\nLogistics\nLogistics\nIt will also be helpful to be on good speaking terms with local law-enforcement\nauthorities. In some cities, you may actually be required to register any assemblage\nof people, especially if you are gathering in a public place.\nCONVENTION\nONVENTION\nONVENTION\nONVENTION\nONVENTION S S S S SITES\nITES\nITES\nITES\nITES\nOrganizing a venue is a considerably easier task for a convention game than it\nis for a long-term chronicle. You’ll only need the place for a night or a weekend, and\nbooking availability for a once-off is simpler to get than trying to persuade the\nestablishment to keep every second Saturday free for gaming.\nIf your game is being run alongside a large established gaming or sci-fi\nconvention, chances are you will be allotted space by the convention organizers in\naccordance with your requested space and the number of players you project to\nattend. Having the convention staff handling some of your work will also mitigate\nconsiderations such as insurance, registration, security and publicity.\nIf you’re on your own, then here are a few things to consider:\nYou can never quite tell how many people may turn up at a convention, especially\nif you have thrown it open to all comers. With a regular game, you have a more accurate\nfigure of how many are likely to be in attendance at any one time. You will need to make\nan intelligent guesstimate as to how many people are likely to attend and thereby what\nsize venue you will require. You then need to balance the final selection of venue with\nthe cost overall and the cost-per-head you will be charging the gamers. Remember that\ninitial enthusiasm can dampen over time, and the flurry of “Hell yeah!” letters may die\noff when the potential players see the registration fees.\nConversely, convention games can get really big really fast. You are better off\ncapping the number of people in attendance based on your venue rather than trying\nto cram extra players in over and above fire safety regulations. While it may seem\nimpolite, pre-registering your players and refusing non-registered entry can alleviate\npotential crowding issues if you have a comparatively small venue. If you advertise\nyour event by saying that pre-registration is required, you are less likely to offend\nthose who turn up on the spur of the moment when you have to turn them away.\nDon’t rush your decision for a convention venue. Other considerations such as\naccommodation for visitors (hotels versus crash-space), availability of late-night\nrefreshments, public transportation hours and routes all should be taken into\naccount before you sign on the dotted line.\nIf you’re expecting out-of-towners to arrive, you will need to make doubly sure that they\ncan find the site. Scout out multiple routes from each of the major entrances to the city. Publish\nthose directions online for the visitors. Make someone (or several people) with a cell phone\nresponsible for taking calls from lost players. Make sure they know the directions as well.\nPREPARATION\nREPARATION\nREPARATION\nREPARATION\nREPARATION O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E V V V V VENUE\nENUE\nENUE\nENUE\nENUE\nIf you’re storytelling in an area that someone else has arranged for you, then make\nsure you reconnoiter the site well in advance of the game. You will need to know your\nterritory, so that if you’re contacted to meet another Storyteller, you have a point of\nreference and don’t get lost on the 14th floor while they await your arrival in reception.\nCheck out the site with your Storyteller/ Narrator team, and sort out which areas will\nbe appropriate for set-scenes you may have scripted. Decide which areas will be communal\ngathering places that all the characters in the game can reach, which areas will be “secure”\n(the Chantry, the sewers, the freehold, etc.) and which areas are designated for out-of-\ncharacter relaxation. Make signs so the players will know which areas are off limits. If you have\nthe staffing capabilities, assign Narrators who are familiar with the workings of the Chantry,\nsewers, freehold, etc., to supervise those specific areas when play is in progress there.\n\n\n26\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nDefine in advance (and clear with the venue’s staff) the outside borders of your\ngame area. Players may wander out of the game zone and inadvertently disrupt staff\nat work or others present in the venue.\nRESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nWhen you run a large game, you’ll need to make sure you have the resources to\nadminister your group of players adequately. Booking venues, printing character\nsheets and badges, website hosting… all these things take time and resources your\naverage mortal may not have available.\nYour biggest issue is likely to be financing the ongoing expenses, such as rental\nof the game venue, printer paper and ink. Of course, the upshot is that if you can’t\nafford the location, you’re unlikely to be able to continue using it.\nGenerally, charging players for game attendance or club membership can cover\nadministrative costs. You are strongly advised to seek accounting advice before\nembarking on any such mission. Your local accounting laws may require registration\nof your game as a club, non-profit or not-for-profit organization. The finances may\nbe considered income for one or more of your members and therefore taxable. If you\nhave to fork out your own cash, you may need to obtain reimbursement from the\nplayers. Money can be one of the biggest bugbears of a game, and proper handling\nof the finances of a game will reduce tensions due to such matters.\nTime is the other less-considered major resource. There’s never enough of it,\nand if you’re trying to run a large game with a minimal staff, you’ll run out of it sooner\nor later… normally sooner. If you’re holding down a day job and you find that the\nchronicle may as well be a second form of employment because you’re topping 50\nhours a week on it, it may be time to farm out some of the work.\nOptimize the use of your storytelling team by arranging cohesive meetings and\nsorting out issues as or before they arise. If your game is intensive, playing more than\ntwice a month, then weekly meetings become a must to keep on top of things.\nMonthly games can probably survive on monthly meetings unless there is a\nconsiderable amount of downtime activity by the characters to resolve.\nPROPS\nROPS\nROPS\nROPS\nROPS\nAll the suggestions in the other Mind’s Eye Theatre books in regards to\nsetting, ambience, lighting and music apply to large games as well, and you will\nfind that a bit of hard work in these areas is eventually rewarding. You are dealing\nwith a larger scale here, and you will find yourself with much more room to fill.\nDon’t panic and be tempted to cram as many props as you can into each area.\nYour rooms will fill with people quickly, and people obscure properties. You’re\nprobably better off focusing on a few well-placed and well-presented props in any\none area to establish the nature of that area. A cloth-draped throne on a dais\nstates “prince’s chamber” as eloquently as a dozen tapestries. A few strategically\nplaced candelabra will call up the feeling of a Chantry chamber more effectively\nthan dragging in the taxidermically stuffed alligator and all the glassware from\nthe local chemist. Allow the players to stretch their imagination without\novertaxing their attention.\nIf you are fortunate enough to have an established venue and a fair\nassortment of regular props, you might be able to negotiate storing your\nproperty with your host. It will certainly save you having to drag the damned\nstuff across town every weekend.\n\n\n27\nLogistics\nLogistics\nCOMMUNICATIONS\nOMMUNICATIONS\nOMMUNICATIONS\nOMMUNICATIONS\nOMMUNICATIONS\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND I I I I INFORMATION\nNFORMATION\nNFORMATION\nNFORMATION\nNFORMATION M\n M\n M\n M\n MANAGEMENT\nANAGEMENT\nANAGEMENT\nANAGEMENT\nANAGEMENT\nWith hundreds of people involved in your chronicle or network, it becomes\nimportant that everyone is kept informed of any important events or news, both in\nand out of character. You will need to be able to notify all your players of the dates\nand locations of upcoming games, and they need to know where they can find other\ninformation pertinent to the chronicle. Additionally, your Storytellers will need to\nhave methods of distributing information quickly to each other and to the players.\nThe storytelling team also needs to develop methods for handling plot contingencies\nand for maintaining the internal records of the chronicle (such as character sheets).\nYou should consider your policies and procedures for managing such information with\ncare. Make sure that up-to-date information is available to anyone who needs it, and that\nthey can contact you (or your designated representatives) easily if they have any questions.\nWith the expanded options available with today’s technology, you have a\nvariety of methods for the dissemination of your chronicle’s information.\nWEBSITES\nEBSITES\nEBSITES\nEBSITES\nEBSITES\nPerhaps the easiest way for a chronicle to maintain a central repository of game\ninformation is through a website. If you’re not an Internet guru, you should delegate\nresponsibility of this site to one or two of your players who know how to handle a\nwebsite, and make sure that they are fed the necessary information to keep the site\ncurrent. One of the biggest killers of websites is stagnation, and if you want to keep\nthe interest of your Internet observers, you’ll need to update regularly.\nEncourage the others in the game to contribute information to the website as\nwell. Have them submit character profiles, photographs, poetry or whatever else\nthey feel will be of assistance. A steady stream of player submissions can help reduce\nthe overall pressure on the Storyteller to create the site from whole cloth while still\nhandling the rest of the chronicle’s organization.\nSetting information is vital. Your chronicle’s historical background, for ex-\nample, will contribute to both new and old players. If you are setting your chronicle\nin the city in which you play, reference the differences that would be notable to a\nresident. You should already have the majority of this information ready to go if\nyou’ve done your pre-chronicle set-up thoroughly. The Laws of the Night Camarilla\nGuide can help you flesh out your setting if you need some hints.\nYour gossip or the player of your harpy (or the Galliards or bards) could be encouraged\nto write regular reports on recent important events and the elders’ announcements. They\nmay even wish to maintain a list of your characters’ status or renown, positions and rumors\nor anecdotes about them so that a visitor to the website (and possibly to your chronicle)\ncan enter the game at least partially informed as to the city’s politics.\nEMAIL\nMAIL\nMAIL\nMAIL\nMAIL L L L L LISTS\nISTS\nISTS\nISTS\nISTS\nA number of free facilities exist on the Internet that allow you to set up email lists\nwith which you can keep subscribers informed as to the goings-on in your chronicle.\nAs with your website, you ought to post regularly and keep the information current.\nYou should schedule a regular posting of your game date and location, perhaps even\nyour house rules if the file size is small enough. Some of these facilities allow you to share\nfiles via the Internet. If your house rules (or any other files you might share) are larger\nthan would be considered polite to post in an email (say, 20 kilobytes) you could\nprovide a link for people who wish to see the latest version when it is released by the\nStoryteller team. Include a link to your chronicle’s website as well.\n\n\n28\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nPlayers will inevitably wish to maintain communications between games,\neither in or out of character, so perhaps separate email lists for announcements, in-\ncharacter and out-of-character conversations might be an option. As the network\nof your game grows, you might even find players who are willing to assist. They might\nrun clan-, kith- or tribe-specific lists, a list closed to all but the city’s officers, coterie\nor pack lists or whatever other kind of list they can come up with.\nIf you have a team of Storytellers and Narrators, consider running lists for these folks\nas well. Having a well-informed staff will result in a slicker chronicle in the long run.\nPHONE\nHONE\nHONE\nHONE\nHONE L L L L LISTS\nISTS\nISTS\nISTS\nISTS\nIf you have the staff, finances and motivation, you can maintain regular contact with\nyour players by ringing around to notify them of upcoming games and recent events. However,\ndoing so can be a costly option, and it is more suitable for smaller chronicles. You could\nencourage those players who are on your email lists to contact those without Internet access.\nIn any case, it is always handy to have a record of the phone numbers of your players\nin case you do need to speak with them. Email can be such an impersonal method of\ncommunication, since it lacks any real indication of tonal inflection other than emoticons\nand font faces. Additionally, phone conversations are immediate, so you don’t have to rely\non people checking their email accounts regularly. Many people would prefer to deal with\na live voice in real time rather than have to translate an email letter’s potential nuances.\nExamine the option of having an information hotline that people can call to\nfind out game dates and locations, and where they might be able to leave a message\nfor the Storytellers. If you can afford it, an 800 number (or similar messaging system)\nmakes a great repository for basic game and contact information for those who don’t\nhave access to the Internet.\nINFORMATION\nNFORMATION\nNFORMATION\nNFORMATION\nNFORMATION O\n O O\n O OVERLOAD\nVERLOAD\nVERLOAD\nVERLOAD\nVERLOAD\nThe larger your game is (especially in the case of an interconnected network of\nchronicles), the more email is likely to be swapped between players and staff.\nKeeping track of all the pieces of information can become a nightmare, so be\nprepared to delegate responsibility for separating the wheat from the chaff and\nreporting the pertinent issues back up the chain to the storytelling team.\nIt is also very tempting for players to continue to further plots during downtime via email.\nYou will need to decide whether this practice is acceptable, or whether you would prefer for\nall the action to take place during the actual game. E-scenes (which occur in chat rooms or\nvia email) may be permissible, but they can be difficult to adjudicate from a Storyteller’s point\nof view, unless you are participating in or observing the scene electronically. Requiring players\nto keep archives of conversations can help keep “he said/ she said” situations from arising.\nUltimately, the decision as to what actions are permissible via email or chat\nrooms is up to you. Determine who is responsible for collating the downtime\ninformation, presenting it to the storytelling team and for reporting any issues that\nmay have arisen that require urgent Storyteller attention. Keep an eye out for\ncharacters releasing information they don’t justifiably possess. Notify the players of\nwhich Storytellers are available at what times to supervise e-scenes.\nAT- G\n- G\n- G\n- G\n- GAME\nAME\nAME\nAME\nAME M\n M\n M\n M\n MANAGEMENT\nANAGEMENT\nANAGEMENT\nANAGEMENT\nANAGEMENT\nIf you are truly a Storyteller legend and you can run a 100-plus player game by\nyourself, then we worship you.

You can give\nspecific roles to others, or you can opt to share the overall workload. Hey, doing so\nfrees up some spare time for eating, at least!\nMULTIPLE\nULTIPLE\nULTIPLE\nULTIPLE\nULTIPLE S S S S STORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nManaging a game and supervising a large number of players are mammoth tasks, and\nmany chronicles will find it beneficial to divide the Storyteller’s duties among multiple people.\nA Storyteller in a small game has a million tasks and details to look after, including\nInfluence, Storyteller characters, plot arcs, character sheets, Experience Traits, venue\norganization and contacting players. What a mission! Chances are good that even a\nsmall chronicle will need to share the duties of handling the out-of-game organization.\nThe Storyteller team structure has many forms, depending on the preferences\nof the people involved. Your preference may be different that the ones we discuss\nhere, but as long as your communication, compromise and courtesy issues are\naddressed and your players are happy, we’re not going to hassle you.\nA common team structure might consist of a head Storyteller and several assistant\nStorytellers. The head Storyteller has the ultimate guiding control over the flow of the\nchronicle, and she delegates areas of responsibility to her assistants. Perhaps one assistant is\nin control of monitoring Influence expenditures and reporting plot developments along those\nlines back to the head Storyteller, while another is responsible for the antagonists’ actions.\nThis structure is really just an expansion of the relationship between Storytellers\nand Narrators, but with an intermediary step. Some games may prefer that the\nNarrators simply assume such responsibilities. The advantages of this structure are the\nfacts that the buck stops somewhere and that an ultimate decision-maker is available\nSECRETS\nECRETS\nECRETS\nECRETS\nECRETS R\n R R\n R REVEALED\nEVEALED\nEVEALED\nEVEALED\nEVEALED\nYour players can gain a large amount of in-character information each game,\nwhether they do so from Storyteller sources or from other characters in the chronicle.\nIn a network, in-character information can come from hundreds of other involved\nplayers who presumably have gotten their information from similar sources.\nMany of the “secrets” of the World of Darkness are written up in the various\nbooks from White Wolf, and they will almost inevitably come into play at some\nstage during the life of the network. It falls to the Storytellers and the administrators\nof the network to ascertain whether or not it is acceptable for sensitive information\n(such as the true story of the Cappadocians) to become publicly known. If a\ncharacter learns of the information in a valid manner — from a Storyteller, by\nwitnessing the events or from a reliable source — then it is almost certain that that\ninformation will reach the ears of other characters, unless the character in question\nis really good at keeping secrets. Such information then spreads like wildfire via\nemail and other avenues of modern communication, and it becomes “valid” for the\nentire network to have it. Thus the value of that secret is reduced to doggerel.\nIf you wish to preserve the mystery, then simply don’t allow the information to\nbe released. Since you’re part of a network, other Storytellers will have decided\nwhether or not they want their characters to know piece of information. Respect their\ndecision to conceal information, and ask before you release it. Consultation on these\nmatters will benefit the entire network and prevent you from having to retract\ninformation, negating several evenings of roleplay and a significant quantity of email.\n\n\n30\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nto resolve any issues that may arise. It can result in the game being somewhat forced,\nunless the head Storyteller is open to suggestions and discussion from his teammates.\nAnother viable team structure consists of equal-measure Storytellers. None\nis dominant over the rest, and decisions are made by consensus. This structure\nrequires a team-development process that is similar to the authority structure, and\nit involves considerably more trust and communication between the people\ninvolved. However, it encourages a sharing and growth of ideas, which can be\nbeneficial to the game as a whole.\nRegardless of the structure of your Storyteller team, it requires the acceptance\nof the players in order to survive. If the players are not happy with the structure of\nthe game or the pecking order, then they have the right to vote with their feet and\nplay elsewhere. If you lose enough players, you won’t have much of a game.\nSPECIALIZATION\nPECIALIZATION\nPECIALIZATION\nPECIALIZATION\nPECIALIZATION\nConsider specific roles for each of the people in your team and how you will\ndetermine their responsibilities. For example, you may decide that one Storyteller\nis responsible for handling plots, Storyteller characters and Influence. Another\nhandles character sheets and Experience Traits between games, is in charge of rules\ncalls during the game, and supervises clans A, B and C. Meanwhile, a third\nStoryteller adjudicates clans X, Y and Z, organizes venues and the website. A fourth\nhandles interaction with other games in a network and non-vampire concerns.\nInevitably, some overlap will occur between the roles and duties, but as long as\neveryone knows who is responsible for what aspect of the game, things will run\nsmoothly. Players in a large game have more confidence when they know that people\nhave been appointed specifically to address their individual concerns.\nASSEMBLING\nSSEMBLING\nSSEMBLING\nSSEMBLING\nSSEMBLING Y Y Y Y YO U R\nO U R\nO U R\nO U R\nO U R S S S S STORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nYou will need to schedule downtime meetings for your team in order to keep each\nother abreast of situations that arise within each of your areas of responsibility. Stay on\nthe same page. If you each forge ahead without knowing what the other heads of the\nhydra are doing, you will tear apart the team (and possibly the game). Maintaining\nconsistency and unity in the decision process will benefit the game in the long run.\nTake time to bring everyone up to speed on current plots and character activity.\nConsider the reactions of your setting to the plots in motion and how those reactions will be\nreflected in your next game. If you have information that should be passed on to one of your\nteam specialists, this meeting is the time to do it, so that he can do his job more efficiently.\nDURING\nURING\nURING\nURING\nURING T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E G\n G G\n G GA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nYour storytelling team will be very busy during a large game, and the members\nwill spend considerable time covering a large area cross-referencing scenes, adjudi-\ncating important challenges and portraying Storyteller character. Unless you have\na strong game-plan as a team or you are all naturally telepathic, you need to settle\non a method of transferring information or questions between each other quickly\nand efficiently, with minimal disruption to the game in progress.\nOne useful method is to invest in a set of short-range multi-channel walkie-talkies\nor radio-telephones. Separate channels can be set for Storytellers or Narrators, open or\nclosed conversations, tactical talk or chatter, and so on. These items are somewhat pricey\n(check your local electronics stores), but they can save a considerable amount of walking\nor having to ask a Narrator to drop out of game to find a player on the other side of the\ngame site. Multiple people can chat on the same channel, which is very useful if you need\nto assemble a team and update your Storytellers on developments. If your wallet can\nhandle it, cell phones are also useful for such communications. If you’re going to use them,\n\n\n31\nLogistics\nLogistics\nmake sure that everyone who requires them has the correct numbers in the cell phone’s\nmemory and that the phones’ batteries are charged before the game.\nEither way, it is useful to arrange meeting place and times for several gatherings of the\nstaff during the game to touch base on the game’s progress. Taking a few minutes away from\nthe game will not alter the flow too much, as long as your players are capable of continuing\nwithout you present. Take the time to have a snack and a short rest, and refresh everyone\nwith any important plot developments, ideas and events that have come up thus far.\nSTORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER C C C C CHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nAlthough it may seem that they become less important due to numbers, primary\nor long-running Storyteller characters become more pivotal in a large game.\nSecondary Storyteller characters, such as incidental mortals or minor flavor charac-\nters, remain important, but the inherent size of the game dictates that the Storytellers\nwill be called on the play stronger roles.\nIn a smaller game, it is likely that the Storytellers and Narrators portray the\nmore powerful characters in a city. In a large game, players will possess most of the\nauthoritarian positions, so the characters that your team portrays are more likely to\nbe central plot devices or external authorities. Who handles these characters? Does\none person coordinate all of your Storyteller characters while the team portrays\nthem, or do you allow the individual team members to play the characters as they see\nfit? If your team is coordinated around a central authority, it is likely that that person\nwill determine these characters’ reactions to events in the game. If you have a\ndecentralized team, each character will grow in its own direction. However, it\nremains important for the team to remain in touch with the plot to determine the\nrequired eventualities of the characters’ actions.\nStoryteller characters are no more static than the players’ characters are. Most of the\nmembers of your team are likely to be portraying these characters in the chronicle from\ntime to time (or on an ongoing basis if necessary). The actions of the players’ characters\nwill affect each of the Storyteller characters differently. Treat each character as an\nindividual, just as you would portray the character if you were a player. As in real life,\nactions lead to repercussions, and there is no reason that a Storyteller character should\nnot react appropriately to a situation that challenges his own position. For example, if\nyou are portraying a Storyteller prince, and a vampire is caught breaching the Masquer-\nade, then you need to punish that character. To ignore the situation is to ignore one of\nthe conventions of the genre. Of course, the offending character may be able to swing\na deal to escape Final Death, but that’s all part of the in-character politics.\nSHIFTS\nHIFTS\nHIFTS\nHIFTS\nHIFTS I N\nI N\nI N\nI N\nI N T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E T\n T T\n T TE A M\nE A M\nE A M\nE A M\nE A M\nEventually, one of your team members will become tired, jaded or just plain\nburned out as a Storyteller. Storytelling is a lot of work, much of which goes on\nbehind the scenes, and sometimes it can seem thankless. However, a run-down\nStoryteller will only drag the game down with him, and any large game should have\na policy in place when a Storyteller decides to step down.\nWhether someone is groomed for replacement, is elected into the position, gravitates\nthere by general charisma or is just the only person available at the time, the new Storyteller\nwill need to be brought up to date on current plots and team decisions. He’ll be exposed to\nan initial flood of information, much of which has been concealed from him as a player.\nYou will need to be prepared to bring the new team member up to speed in the areas\nthat she will be dealing with. The outgoing Storyteller should set aside some time to talk\nwith the incumbent and detail the necessary information. Transitional difficulties will\nreflect themselves into the game, and can cause problems for the players. If a plot suddenly\n\n\n32\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nturns through 180 degrees for no discernible reason other than a change of Storyteller,\nthen the suspension of disbelief required for a good game is shattered.\nStorytellers who are stepping down have a challenging time ahead of them if\nthey intend to join in the game immediately as a player. They have a lot of\ninformation about ongoing plots and other characters in the game, which gives them\nan unfair advantage over other players. As long as the game is satisfied that the\nformer Storyteller can separate that knowledge from what his new character may\nknow, then all is good. If doubt persists, it can color the game experience. It is\nadvisable for the ex-Storyteller to create a character who is distinctly removed from\nany of the plots that he supervised during his tenure.\nTE A M\nE A M\nE A M\nE A M\nE A M U\n U\n U\n U\n UNITY\nNITY\nNITY\nNITY\nNITY\nAs long as everyone is on the same wavelength within the team, it becomes\nmuch easier for any member to make a snap decision in the middle of a game without\nfear of stepping on another team member’s toes. A unity of purpose and vision gives\nrise to additional freedom for interpretation within that vision without disrupting\nthe whole. When you all know the story, you can tell the story equally well.\nCONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nOrganizing a convention game is a very challenging task, and one that involves\na considerable amount of planning. In addition to finding a venue you will need to\nconsider marketing and strategic planning of the event, characters, histories,\nsettings… all the stuff that you would normally consider in starting a new chronicle,\nbut on a much larger scale and possibly just for a single night.\nSome suggestions follow, concerning how to approach the situations involved\nin planning a convention.\nINITIAL\nNITIAL\nNITIAL\nNITIAL\nNITIAL P\n P\n P\n P\n PLANNING\nLANNING\nLANNING\nLANNING\nLANNING\nAssemble a core team of organizers and determine their areas of responsibility. Who\nwill locate and reserve the site? Who is a central communication point for external\ninquiries? Who is handling player and/ or character registrations? If the game is to be part\nof a larger convention, who will interact with other convention staff? Who is handling\nplots and Storyteller characters? Is someone dealing with pre-generated characters and\norientation for novice players? Cross-chronicle plots for network conventions? Who will\nlook after the finances? Who are your Storytellers? Your Narrators?\nAsk questions. Identify as many considerations as you can well in advance of\nyour event and work out your team strategy before you become swamped with last-\nminute matters. You will become swamped.\nPR E\nR E\nR E\nR E\nR E- R\n- R\n- R\n- R\n- REGISTRATION\nEGISTRATION\nEGISTRATION\nEGISTRATION\nEGISTRATION\nIf you are part of a larger convention, then it is likely that the convention’s organizers\nwill require registration for the overall event. If you have additional requirements for people\nattending your game — such as character sheets and backgrounds — ask that they be\nprovided when the players register at the convention itself. If not, you will have to ask the\nplayers themselves for the information in some manner. If the organizers will give you a list\nof players and their contact details, get in touch with the players sooner rather than later\nand inform them of your needs. If that is not possible, then make sure that the information\nabout your game in their literature includes your contact information.\nIt will be useful to compose a record of all the players who attend your game,\nalong with their contact information, in case you or other convention staff should\nneed to contact them after the event.\n\n\n33\nLogistics\nLogistics\nCHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nYou may have constructed the whole game, including all of the character parts,\nwhich you will assign to players at the convention. If so, you need to let the players\nknow this in advance. Avoid disappointing those players who turn up expecting to\nbe able to play their own characters.\nIf people want to play their own characters, and you are prepared to allow them\nto do so, they should be prepared to present them to your Storyteller team prior to\nthe event. If you have foreknowledge of the characters that are going to be in\nattendance and you have some basic information about their backgrounds and\ndriving goals, then you can tailor plots or sub-plots to suit.\nYou won’t have time on the night of the game itself for your team to be vetting\ncharacters. You’re expecting several hundred people to walk past your registration desk,\neach with a dozen questions. You won’t have time to be sifting through their hand-written\nnotes wondering how they learned out-of-clan Thaumaturgy or whether the item card for\ntheir six-Trait broadsword is valid according to Laws of the… which book was it in?\nGather the players’ character information as soon as possible so that you can get a feel\nfor what sort of event you have looming before you. If you are part of a network, you’re more\nlikely to be familiar with the characters you see posting on the network’s email lists, or you\ncan deal easily with their Storytellers if you have any questions about the character or player.\nIf you throw wide the doors to your convention game, you’re in for a wild ride, and you\nwill need to seriously consider how to handle the likely interactions that will occur at the\nevent. The characters may have come from wildly disparate game types, and their character\nhistories might clash. The Camarilla might still recognize the Gangrel as a member clan\nin one player’s game. Another might have a different Brujah justicar. Red Star or no Red\nStar? If your game’s planned story differs significantly from the World of Darkness metaplot,\nthen be sure that you let the players know as much before they start playing.\nWeigh up all the character submissions in terms of game balance. If something sticks out\nlike a sore thumb as not belonging, contact the player to discuss the matter. Don’t be afraid\nto decline the character if it is likely to be detrimental to the game. The player may be willing\nto negotiate some fine points of the character to bring it more in line with your vision. You\nmight find it useful to contact the player’s Storyteller to verify details of the character.\nEven for an event that allows existing characters to attend, your team should\ncreate a number of pre-generated characters for players who turn up short a sheet.\nThese characters need not be mainstream or headlining characters. You may not\nknow how many people to expect at the convention. Start with 30 spare sheets, and\nkeep a few blanks handy for emergencies.\nGive your pre-gens more than just Traits. Create goals, plots and interaction\nhooks so that the player has a kick-start into the game. You don’t want to get bogged\ndown in character creation and approval when you should be running the game or\nportraying a plot-critical Storyteller character entrance. You certainly don’t want to\nspend the rest of the evening answering, “So what was my motivation in this scene?”\nDon’t be tempted into creating a stack of eighth-generation powerhouses. The World\nof Darkness focuses more closely on the underlings of the various species. Create ghouls, high-\ngeneration vampires, fosterns and adren. Resist the urge to scatter the sheets with extra Traits\nunless that character’s age, history or experience absolutely demands it. A starting-level\nneonate can have as much, if not more, roleplaying potential than a brooding but static elder\nvampire, and a player is more likely to play such a character believably. If you need to have\npowerful Storyteller characters in the game, then give those characters to your team to play.\nYour Storytellers and Narrators will already know their expected roles and have rehearsed\n\n\n34\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nthem prior to the event. Besides, the more underdogs who are running around for the elders\nto play with, the more representational of the society in question your game can be.\nTE A M\nE A M\nE A M\nE A M\nE A M C C C C COORDINATION\nOORDINATION\nOORDINATION\nOORDINATION\nOORDINATION\nBefore the event, establish who is in control of what aspects of the game. Meet\nwith your team well in advance and coordinate. Know which Storytellers will\ncontrol which physical areas of your venue and aspects of the overall game.\nNominate your Narrators. Designate those folks who will play your Storyteller charac-\nters, and make sure that they are aware of their required roles. Make sure that they are familiar\nwith any genre discrepancies or house interpretations of the standard rules that may apply to\nthe game so that everyone is on the same planet when the questions come flying.\nKnow your territory and your limits. Communicate with the other convention staff\n(if you’re part of a larger convention) about their expectations, and don’t go beyond them.\nPrepare the same information for presentation to the players. Know where you can play your\ngame and where you are trespassing. Learn the venue’s emergency procedures and your roles\nin an emergency. Think for a moment about potential first-aid requirements. Having a few\nhundred people in a confined area can lead to accidents, as much as we hope it won’t.\nConduct a thorough examination of the site as a team. Learn the quickest routes through\nthe game site so that you and your players won’t get lost. Identify any areas that you think\nshould be of concern in regards to safety and consider striking them from the game zone.\nThink about how you will handle communication during the game. Consider\ninvesting in some short-range, multi-channel walkie-talkies so that you can keep in\ntouch with each other from across the game site. Make sure they meet local radio\ncontrol specifications. These devices can be invaluable tools for plot coordination,\nscene timing and even simple rules matters.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E F F F F FRONT\nRONT\nRONT\nRONT\nRONT D\n D\n D\n D\n DESK\nESK\nESK\nESK\nESK\nEncourage players to turn up as early as possible (or feasible) on the day of the\nevent. Deal with all of the bookkeeping and discussions in advance of the actual\ngame. Reserve the game time for the game itself. The front desk is not a hangout.\nAt this stage, players should receive a copy of their character sheets and any notes\nthat may have been prepared for them. Willpower and special Trait tokens can be\ndistributed alongside item cards. If you are concerned about players altering character\nsheets, print them on event-specific letterhead, and accept information only from\nsheets that have that letterhead during the game. Keep copies of all official sheets for\nStoryteller reference. If you have access to a laptop computer and a portable printer,\nbring them along so that you can print out more information (or copies) quickly.\nHand each player a copy of the house interpretations of the Mind’s Eye Theatre\nrules that are in play for the night, as well as a basic information and rumor sheet so\nthat they have an idea of what they are facing in the hours to come. Take this\nopportunity to inform the players of any special conditions of play and any out-of-\ngame rules that you (or the convention staff) expect them to abide by, and let them\nknow what might happen if they decide to break those rules.\nAs your Storytellers and Narrators arrive, hand them pre-printed badges to\ndenote their out-of-character position. Doing so makes them more easily recogniz-\nable to players during the game should they be needed.\nNE W\nE W\nE W\nE W\nE W P\n P\n P\n P\n PLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nIdentify people who are attending your game but who have never played in a\nMind’s Eye Theatre game before.

Perhaps the Narrator can play an ancilla with her\nbrood of childer, or a den mother with her cubs. The Narrator can then mentor the\nnew players and act as a roleplaying buffer for them as need be.\nYOUNG\nOUNG\nOUNG\nOUNG\nOUNG P\n P\n P\n P\n PLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nOur games deal with mature and adult topics. With this fact in mind, make a policy\nearly in your pre-event organization about whether you will allow minors to attend. If the\ngame that you are planning to run will explore adult themes, consider your local laws on\nexposing minors to such issues. If young players are going to be at the game, it is advisable\nthat you get a signed permission and disclaimer form from their parents. Of course, you\nmight like to invite the parents to come and play with their children.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E I I I I INTRODUCTION\nNTRODUCTION\nNTRODUCTION\nNTRODUCTION\nNTRODUCTION\nBefore the game starts, assemble all the players in a central area for some\nStoryteller quality time. With a large number of players present, it will be too difficult\nto give each person the individual attention he needs. Take half an hour to an hour\nto cover any salient points that you need to address with the players.\nAt this time, introduce your Storyteller and Narrator staff, so that the players will\nknow whom they can deal with for out-of-character matters. Point out their nice badges.\nNote that they are the officials for the event and that they have final say in any rules\ninterpretations or plot calls. Also introduce any administrative staff that will be available\nfor player queries or matters of emergency. Outline any safety issues and procedures.\nLATECOMERS\nATECOMERS\nATECOMERS\nATECOMERS\nATECOMERS\nIt happens. Your convention game’s been rolling smoothly for the last four\nhours, and now 15 players from the GeekCon’s Last Glooming — the LARP that\nyou heard about going on downstairs — have decided that they want to join\nyour game because it looks cooler. Meanwhile, the missing pre-registered\nplayers whose car broke down on the freeway are finally pulling up outside. You\nneed to have a plan in place for dealing with these people.\nIf you have a strict pre-registration requirement, then non-registered\nplayers are not getting through the door. If you have an open-door policy, then\nyou may choose to bring the stragglers up to date with the events of the evening,\nor you might just throw them in to sink or swim. The latter option can be a lot\nof fun for a player — after all, his character wouldn’t know what had gone down\nif he had turned up late, would he?\nYou will also need to go over the rules of the convention game just as you did\nwith all the players who turned up on time. Sort out a character for them from your\npre-generated sheets, then introduce them into the game as smoothly as possible.\nIf people have come from another game to your game, you will need to\ndecide whether they can join in. It might pay to have a quick chat with the\nStorytellers of the other game as to why these people have changed their minds,\nand then make a decision. Let common sense prevail.\n\n\n36\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nIntroduce your plot and setting. Much of this information should be included on the\ninformation sheets that you have already distributed to the players, but it is helpful to them\nto reinforce that information verbally. Call forward your key characters so that they can be\nidentified easily. It’s not very helpful if the Garou of a caern can’t identify their sept’s Warder,\nnor does it assist matters if the local established Kindred don’t know who the prince is.\nField reasonable questions and allow some time for chitchat. If the noise level rises too\nhigh, call people back down to order and move the conversation along. People will by now\nbe champing at the bit to game on. Frantic roleplayers are a scary lot, and you’re already eating\ninto their game time. Deal with any lingering issues quickly and firmly, and move on to the\nnext question. Allow a few moments of comic relief, sure, but don’t waste too much time.\nAnnounce the start and end times of your game, as well as any intermissions or\nscheduled assemblies. If the game is to continue over several nights, talk about the\ntiming and procedures that pertain to the subsequent nights.\nSplit the players up into their respective coteries, cities, septs, social cliques, whatever.\nThey should spend the next half-hour or so getting to know each other’s characters and\nfaces. This is where your prepared background and information sheets come in handy again.\nThen let them loose.\nDURING\nURING\nURING\nURING\nURING THE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE G\n G G\n G GAME\nAME\nAME\nAME\nAME\nYou’re going to be run ragged keeping track of dozens of scenes, coordinating\nnumerous Storyteller characters and tweaking an amorphous plot that will change\nwith the wind and at the whim of the players. Here are some basic pointers for keeping\nsome semblance of control over the masses and making sure that people are having fun.\nPROBLEM\nROBLEM\nROBLEM\nROBLEM\nROBLEM P\n P\n P\n P\n PLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nLAYERS\nDeal with these people as quickly as you discover them. You will have laid out your\nground rules at the start, so all the players will be aware of the expected codes of\nconduct. You have too many people to deal with and too few staff to be policing the\ngame constantly, and you will have no time to deal with cheese-heads, whiners, gun-\nbunnies or whatever you want to call them. Make it a “one warning then you’re out”\nsituation. That said, deal with all such situations politely. Courtesy will not hurt the\nsituation, and it may defuse it before it escalates into a nasty situation. For example,\nif a character is about to start a combat in a game that you have stated will be politically\nbased, and that will result in a huge time bubble for dozens of players, check the\ncharacter’s motivations. If it’s inconsistent with the character’s general personality,\nadvise the player of the likelihood of disruption and ask him to reconsider the action.\nIf a player is in breach of the core rules of Mind’s Eye Theater, handle him as you\nwould any other player. Just because you’re at a convention does not mean that the\nrules of play or civility fly out the window. It’s easy for people to become a little over-\nexcited and make a few simple mistakes, but the core rules exist for a reason. When\npeople break said rules, you must deal with them firmly and immediately for the sake\nof the game. For instance, if the player is engaged in an illegal or harmful activity, call\nsecurity and have him removed. You’re not the police, and the people in charge of the\nconvention or premises have the authority and ability to deal with criminals. Don’t\nendanger yourself or others. Also, you don’t want yourself or your large friends being\nbrought up on assault charges for helping a troublesome miscreant find the door.\nENVIRONMENTAL\nNVIRONMENTAL\nNVIRONMENTAL\nNVIRONMENTAL\nNVIRONMENTAL I I I I IMPACT\nMPACT\nMPACT\nMPACT\nMPACT\nWith so many players active in a confined area, the game is bound to get a little\nloud. Depending on what your game site is like, consider the impact of your presence\non others nearby. If you’re part of a larger convention, be aware of the effect your players\n\n\n37\nLogistics\nLogistics\nmay have on other people’s games. If you’re running a stand-alone convention, remain\nconscious of the neighbors, and avoid disrupting their normal lives. If you cause overt\ndisruption, you may find yourselves pointedly uninvited in the future.\nIt’s possible that your players will intermingle with other convention-goers who\nare not involved in the game itself, which can add strain to your game. It can be very\ndifficult for a player to maintain an in-character posture if he is being distracted by an\nelf babe showing more bosom than brassiere or if he’s being glowered at by a passing\nKlingon. Encourage your players to keep away from the other non-players during game\nplay for everyone’s sake. Don’t let non-players get dragged into the game.\nDE A D\nE A D\nE A D\nE A D\nE A D P\n P\n P\n P\n PLOTS\nLOTS\nLOTS\nLOTS\nLOTS\nIf you find that your plots are dying, have a back-up plan. You need to either\nspark their interest further or be ready to replace the plot. You can conceivably\ncombine the two concepts by inserting a new, fresh and exciting plot device that\nleads the characters back to the over-arcing story. If the plot is a dead duck, cook it\nand eat it. There’s little point in letting it stink up the game. Have spare plot threads\navailable for such contingencies. Even red herrings can spark a whole new concept\nfor story that you might not have thought of. Be prepared to wing it.\nEXCESSIVE\nXCESSIVE\nXCESSIVE\nXCESSIVE\nXCESSIVE O\n O O\n O\n OU T\nU T\nU T\nU T\nU T-O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F- G\n- G\n- G\n- G\n- GA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nA M E A A A A ACTIVITY\nCTIVITY\nCTIVITY\nCTIVITY\nCTIVITY\nYour players have come a long distance to play, so encourage them to remain in\ncharacter as much as possible. Although it is very tempting for players to sit around and\nchat about what’s happened in their character’s histories, they are there for a reason,\nand that reason is to play your game. Ask people to save their out-of-character\nmoments for non-game time. There is plenty of time afterward for chitchat.\n“ C\n“ C\n“ C\n“ C\n“ CHEESE\nHEESE\nHEESE\nHEESE\nHEESE”  C\n”  C\n”  C\n”  C\n”  CALLS\nALLS\nALLS\nALLS\nALLS\nSomeone is going to complain about something somewhere along the line, be it\ndue to plot (“This is nuts! Since when did the Brujah know so much about the\nSalubri?”), rules (“But we play Aura Perception like this back home.”) or events (“I don’t\nthink it’s in character for the Ventrue justicar to deal with that situation by killing the\nprince”). If your Storyteller team is well organized, you should be prepared to deal with\nall of these situations. If your convention is part of a network or ongoing chronicle,\nthen you have the contact information for the players involved in any specific scene\nso you can sort issues out after the game is finished. To avoid situations of this sort, keep\nyour plots and character motivations simple, and keep your rules clear.\nNETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK C C C C CONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nONVENTIONS\nIf you’re running a convention as part of a network of chronicles, abide by the\nnetwork’s rules. Get clearance for anything that requires it well in advance of the\nevent. Remember that the event is going to become part of the network’s communal\nhistory, and it will affect the development of any network character who attends.\nThe appearance of any international-level Storyteller characters should be cleared\nthrough the appropriate authorities. Any plots that will affect multiple member\nchronicles in the network should be discussed with the Storytellers concerned.\nCHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER D\n D\n D\n D\n DEATH\nEATH\nEATH\nEATH\nEATH\nWhile a predominantly political game can carry on with minimal character\nremoval, it remains a fact of game that characters may die due to plot or character reasons.\nLosing your sole character at a convention while several hours of playtime remain is\ndisappointing, and players may justifiably complain. Again, be prepared. Have available\na selection of alternative characters that are ready for play and insertion into the story.\n\n\n38\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nNETWORKS\nETWORKS\nETWORKS\nETWORKS\nETWORKS\nWhile conventions and large games have much to offer, the potential for plot\nand interaction that is available through network games surely overshadows them\nboth. With the expanded scope and scale of such organizations come a number of\nissues that will need to be addressed. Many of the concerns that large games or\nconventions need to address are equally applicable to networks, but such mega-\nchronicles have considerations all their own.\nCORE\nORE\nORE\nORE\nORE N\n N\n N\n N\n NETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK Q\n Q Q\n Q QUALITIES\nUALITIES\nUALITIES\nUALITIES\nUALITIES\nIn order for a network of chronicles to prosper and grow, three primary policies\nneed to be considered and developed.\nCOMMUNICATION\nOMMUNICATION\nOMMUNICATION\nOMMUNICATION\nOMMUNICATION\nNetworks need to establish systems of communication that will address the\nneeds of the organization adequately. While a few simple email lists will suffice for\na small local group of chronicles, when the network grows to encompass an\ninternational audience, the sheer daily volume of email can quickly grow to be\noverwhelming. Thousands of emails will pass between characters, either in private\nor on established lists. The administrative staff will likewise be in constant commu-\nnication as they develop systems and deal with situations as they arise.\nIndividual member chronicles will be responsible for monitoring local lists (those\nthat apply to their specific chronicle or geographic area of responsibility) and for\nmaking sure that the quality of information distributed to their players or characters\nis consistent with the network’s agreed rules and/ or genre. If it is not public knowledge\nthat the Assamites have lost their curse, then that information should not appear in\nthe network unless a justifiable reason exists for the character who releases that\ninformation to have discovered it. Of course, the Storyteller that permitted that\ncharacter to have that information will have checked with the administration as to\nwhether it would be appropriate for the character to know the facts in the first place.\nThe network will have policies in place to monitor and prevent the release of\nsuch genre-sensitive information, and contingencies planned for informing the\nnetwork of any falsely released “facts.” A simple fix for such situations is to require\nthe characters involved to have an appropriate level of Lore Ability in the specific\narea before they are permitted to speak of such issues.\nRegular information updates from chronicles to the administration staff are\nrequired in order to monitor the overall status of the organization. Such chronicle\nreports can serve to update the network on changes in Storyteller staff, plots or\nevents that may affect other chronicles, as well as any other matters that are of\nspecific relevance to the network. These updates allow the network staff to remain\nin touch with the member chronicle and deal with any issues as they arise.\nIn return, reports from the various appointed officials in the network will keep\nmember chronicles abreast of their opinions and actions, so that the whole can work\nas one. That ideal may sound a little airy-fairy, but if you can’t maintain communi-\ncations, you can’t maintain a cohesive network.\nCOMPROMISE\nOMPROMISE\nOMPROMISE\nOMPROMISE\nOMPROMISE\nAn independent chronicle has the world at its fingertips. If the staff wants Tipperary\ndemolished by Godzilla in order to further a plot, so be it. In a network, though, the players\nin the Tipperary chronicle may be a tad annoyed to find that their two-year old chronicle\nhas been demolished at the whim of the Storyteller in Kalamazoo. Member chronicles\n\n\n39\nLogistics\nLogistics\nneed to be prepared to limit their impact on the world outside their immediate area.\nJoining a network involves sacrifice, but the reward for that sacrifice is scope.\nThe degree of compromise will depend on the communal agreement that forms\nthe foundation of the network. If the network agrees to be guided by a central authority,\nthen the individual chronicles must be prepared to allow that authority to guide and\neven override the Storytellers in how their game develops. If the network provides for\nstrong chronicle autonomy, then the entire network must be more flexible in order to\nallow for variations in interpretation of the overall worldview.\nEstablishing the level of compromise during the creation of the network will\nprevent a number of potential future disruptions. Not every level of compromise will\nsuit every chronicle that is considering joining a network. Be prepared to shop\naround to find a group that suits your preferences.\nCOURTESY\nOURTESY\nOURTESY\nOURTESY\nOURTESY\nAny community relies upon accepted social graces to survive. A chronicle has an\nexpected level of behavior, beyond which the individual can expect to be expelled from\nthat chronicle. Similarly, a network relies upon a communal agreement as to what\nconstitutes acceptable behavior. Those who decide to transgress those accepted norms and\nwho disrupt the unity of the organization in so doing can expect to be likewise dismissed.\nIn a single chronicle, personal problems can be dealt with on an intimate level, but allowing\nthose personal issues to spill into the community in a network can be very disruptive. No longer\nare you dealing with a handful of people, you are presenting yourself to several hundred —\nperhaps several thousand — who will expect you to be civil and understanding of others’\nviewpoints. You sure as heck can’t please all of the people all of the time, however, and it’s\ngenerally considered polite to know when to bow out of a contentious issue and agree to disagree.\nWhen dealing with email through a network, the additional layer of “netiquette”\nmust be applied. Many of the folk who are familiar with email will already have\nexpectations of acceptable levels of behavior, and they will be quick to jump on those\nwho transgress. Game-related lists are not the place to send your favorite jokes or\nsurveys unless it is an in-character action. Also, be aware of the typical risks of the\nInternet, such as viruses or the sharing of personal out-of-character information.\nNETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK A A A A ADMINISTRATION\nDMINISTRATION\nDMINISTRATION\nDMINISTRATION\nDMINISTRATION\nIn order for a network to function efficiently, it will require a staff of responsible\nand reliable people to coordinate the integration of the chronicles and to supervise\nthe interactions between players’ characters, Storyteller characters and chronicles.\nCHRONICLE\nHRONICLE\nHRONICLE\nHRONICLE\nHRONICLE R\n R R\n R REPRESENTATION\nEPRESENTATION\nEPRESENTATION\nEPRESENTATION\nEPRESENTATION\nThe majority of the internal administration of a network’s member chronicles\nwill fall to the chronicles themselves. It is unreasonable of a member chronicle to\nexpect that the network will handle all of its local affairs. The network will have\nexpectations of the member chronicles in terms of communications, and it will ask\nthat the member chronicle share some of the administrative load, especially as it\napplies to them. The member chronicle is expected to share any issues that will affect\nthe network, even in part, and it agrees to abide by the network’s accepted rules and\ncode of conduct. Additionally, the chronicle is prepared to compromise in order to\nconform to the unilateral views of the network in any given area.\nThe network should not, however, expect a member chronicle to simply be\nslavishly devoted to following the party line, nor should the member chronicle be\nwithout voice in matters that affect it. Representation of the chronicle’s interests to\nthe central authority is required in order to avoid the potential alienation of the\n\n\n40\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nchronicle. Compromise is a two-way affair, and the network must remain open to the\nopinions of its members. Just as a Storyteller may vet the opinions of her players to\ntweak her chronicle to improve the growth and flow of the game, a network should\napproach the member chronicles for feedback on the development of the organization.\nThe process through which a network handles personal representation can be\nimmediate or filtered. A network may designate a single person to handle queries from\nplayers, or it may prefer that the queries be presented through the chronicle’s represen-\ntative to the administration. Either way, it remains important that any player’s concerns\nare addressed, even if just to refer the player back to his chronicle’s staff for solutions.\nINTERNAL\nNTERNAL\nNTERNAL\nNTERNAL\nNTERNAL S S S S STRUCTURES\nTRUCTURES\nTRUCTURES\nTRUCTURES\nTRUCTURES\nAs mentioned earlier, you will need to have established a defined administration\nto handle the out-of-character aspects of your network. Define the roles that are\nrequired and the duties that are attached to those roles. Decide what level of authority\nany specific role grants in regards to the network or to any individual chronicle.\nFor example, the network’s staff, as opposed to any specific chronicle or the\ncollective mass of chronicles, will monitor the movement of the justicars or other\nhigh-ranking elder vampires. It would be unfortunate if the Brujah justicar were\nkilled in one chronicle while dispensing justice in another on the other side of the\nworld! Likewise, the network staff would address issues of the continuity of the genre,\nsuch as monitoring the progression of the metaplot within the World of Darkness\nsupplements and ascertaining the impact of those plots on the chronicles in the\nnetwork. At any time, that information needs to be available to the chronicles that\nare interested in examining plots that involve those characters or situations.\nCan a tribal coordinator dictate tribal policy without sanction from the\nadministration? Can someone administering elder-level Storyteller characters over-\nride a Storyteller and insist on involvement in plots? Can someone coordinating a\njusticar at the network level insist that a chronicle submit a local archon character\nfor an investigation? What level of Storyteller veto is available in a given situation?\nDeciding on the roles and their authority early in the growth of the network will\nboth relieve future potential pressure and shape the face of the network. It will also\nhelp shape the decision of any potential applicant chronicle to join.\nNE W\nE W\nE W\nE W\nE W C C C C CHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nHRONICLES\nConsider also your criteria for admitting new chronicles and integrating them\ninto ongoing plots. They may also have plots that can contribute to the network. A\nnew member chronicle will go through a period of adjustment and orientation as it\nbecomes used to the peculiarities of the network. During this period, is the member\nchronicle able to contribute to the administration of the network, or would you\nprefer that it familiarize itself first?\nIt is helpful to have an admissions team who can help new chronicles orient\nthemselves and fill them in on the history of the network. This team will also be\nconversant with the network’s rules, and it will be able to address any concerns that\nthe chronicle has in regards to those rules.\nWhat sort of criteria might you consider for chronicles that wish to join your\nnetwork? Will you consider newly formed games, or should they be well established?\nStability may be a major concern if you are not prepared to deal with fly-by-night\nchronicles that might not be around in six months. Could the network handle solo\ncharacters that play solely by email, or do you prefer players to be members of an\nestablished chronicle? Ultimately such a character is going to need to be answerable\nto a Storyteller, surely.\n\n\n41\nLogistics\nLogistics\nDISCIPLINARY\nISCIPLINARY\nISCIPLINARY\nISCIPLINARY\nISCIPLINARY I I I I ISSUES\nSSUES\nSSUES\nSSUES\nSSUES\nThe network must be prepared to deal with problem players or chronicles, and\nit must have systems in place to deal with these matters. Options range from\nprobationary periods to outright dismissal or removal. All members of the network\nwill respect a firmly stated policy in regards to accepted levels of conduct if you\nenforce that policy firmly.\nAlthough this topic is an unpleasant one, problems can arise with people that\nwish to consider themselves above and beyond the rules of the community. Having\nsystems in place to deal with these people can act as a deterrent to such behavior, as\nwell as giving the network a method of dealing with the situations when they do arise.\nCROSS\nROSS\nROSS\nROSS\nROSS- C\n- C\n- C\n- C\n- CHRONICLE\nHRONICLE\nHRONICLE\nHRONICLE\nHRONICLE C C C C CHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nHARACTERS\nNinety-nine percent of the time, character interaction between chronicles will\nbe amicable, and no major problems will arise. After all, that’s one of the primary\nreasons people become involved in networks — to share their games. As the games\nbecome more closely interrelated, it becomes possible for players to move between\nthem regularly, especially if those chronicles are geographically close to one another.\nSituations may arise in which characters or players decide to move their base\nfrom one chronicle to another for whatever reason. A network must be prepared for\nthese situations. Is a generic character based in a specific chronicle, or is it considered\nto be a part of the network as a whole? If the former is the case, are Experience Traits\nfrom chronicles that the character has visited viable, or should all Experience Traits\nbe awarded by a character’s “home” chronicle? If the latter is the case, who will award\nthe character Experience Traits, and who keeps track of the player’s character sheet?\nIf a character is considered to belong to a home chronicle, what sort of systems\nmight be needed to administer the transferal of that character to another chronicle,\nensuring consistency of plots in regards to that character? Is it acceptable for a\ncharacter to be based in one chronicle when he plays primarily in another? Consider\nthe impact that such rules will have on the other players in the network.\nNETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK\nETWORK R R R R RULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nAs a network grows, it will develop its own interpretations of the Mind’s Eye\nTheatre systems and rules. It is important that these interpretations be readily\navailable to any member chronicle and player therein, perhaps through a website or\nregular email system. Since you expect every member of your network to share in\nyour understanding of the published rules, it makes sense to make every effort to\nmake them available to those members.\nGA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nA M E R\n R R\n R RULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nWill you have a central set of game rules that every chronicle will use, or will\nyou allow member chronicles to tailor the Mind’s Eye Theatre individually?

The latter will allow an individual\nchronicle to have its own flavor and maintain its own internal balance.\nConstruction of a universal set of rules is a huge undertaking (although we’ve\ndone most of the work for you already), and it involves further compromise on behalf\nof the member chronicles. Chronicles that intend to join need to be aware of your\nrules when they consider joining. Also consider whether you, as a network, are\nprepared to allow exceptions to your established rules. If such is the case, what\nmechanisms do you have in place to monitor and permit such exceptions?\n\n\n42\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\n\n\n43\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nThis chapter collects the disparate and inconsistent rules and systems from\npreceding Mind’s Eye Theatre publications in an attempt to reconcile them with\nthe particular concerns of a large or long-running live-action chronicle. While\nclearing up every lingering question or point of contention to which MET rules are\nheir is beyond the scope of this book, this chapter brings together rules and systems\nthat are common to most kinds of live-action games. It also offers systemic solutions\nto problems that are specific to large or long-running chronicles, it offers additional\nsystems for using the Influence Background, and it answers some sticky questions\nthat arise when live-action settings cross over.\nCHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER C C C C CREATION\nREATION\nREATION\nREATION\nREATION\nIn any live-action roleplaying game, the main ingredient is not plot or\nStoryteller characters or even a realistic world background. The key ingredient is the\nplayers’ characters. The group of characters active in the game will create the core\nof stories that everyone who plays in it will be retelling when they all get together\nout of game. It is the moments of beauty created between players that mark your game\nas something special. A large part of the Storyteller’s responsibility and reward is\ngetting the players excited about their characters while still having those characters\nfit within the larger world that you have created. The Storyteller builds the stage, but\nthe players are writing the speaking roles in the play.\nRARITY\nARITY\nARITY\nARITY\nARITY A A A A APPROVALS\nPPROVALS\nPPROVALS\nPPROVALS\nPPROVALS\nEvery group needs to decide what type of game it wants to play. They have to\ndecide if they would like to play within just one setting, such as Laws of the Night or\nLaws of the Wild, or if they want to explore the possibilities of a fully integrated World\nof Darkness, in which all types of creatures appear. Regardless of what the group\ndecides, some character types just don’t fit. Every setting has a few character types that\nare rare or which simply don’t mix well with the standard choices. The obvious\nexamples are the rare creatures of each genre such as the Nagaraja, True Brujah and\nSalubri in Laws of the Night, or the Thallain and Shadow Court in The Shining Host.\nCHAPTER THREE:\nNUTS AND BOLTS\n\n\n44\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nLikewise, every game has a few players who will want to play those rare creatures.\nIt is perfectly natural to want to play the special characters, so don’t be surprised when\nyou get roughly half of any single game asking to play things like Daughters of\nCacophony or Siberakh. One of the best ways to combat this potential is to define your\ngame early and not be afraid to steer potential players toward similar concepts that fit\nwithin the game’s bounds of reason. If the game is set up as a standard grouping of\nCamarilla vampires in an Elysium-style game of politics, it usually doesn’t make sense\nif the representation of non-standard clans outnumbers the standard clans.\nEventually, though, you will receive your fifth application for a modern-day Bunyip\nor a Scathach Sidhe, and you will come to the point that every Storyteller dreads: telling\nthe player no. Take a moment to really analyze what the player is asking for. Frequently,\nplayers request to play a special kind of creature, but the character concept that the player\nhas in mind can work just as well in another, much more reasonable character type. Try\nto look at the application from the standpoint of helping the player realize his vision of\na character. Try to find out what that player really wants, then work with him to fit those\ngoals into the game. Make sure that you resist the urge to simply deny requests without\nmaking suggestions or offering an alternative. No matter how large the game gets, it still\nlives and breathes on the perceptions of the players. If the players feel that they will be\ndenied the opportunity to play what they want — or that the Storytellers are not\nconsidering their wishes — they will find another game.\nIf Storytellers aren’t careful, they may look around one night and realize that they\nhave a Camarilla game with almost no Camarilla clans in play, or a Garou game with\nmore Fera than Garou. There enters into the game a dichotomy that the players may\nnot be able to voice, but that they will notice. If the game is intended to be a gathering\nof the rare and unique, then it will likely go for some time without being a problem.\nHowever, there is a very real risk of becoming known as a game where anything goes.\nThe opposite is also true, though. Games that keep the levels of rare characters\nto very reasonable levels become known for their even-handed approach to\nportraying the World of Darkness. If players look around and see only one public\nvampire, who is obviously the odd man out, they will receive a very visible message\nthat your game takes the source material seriously and that you are going to use the\noddities of the setting to reinforce the normal.\nWhen deciding how many rare birds are too many, the Storyteller needs to\nexamine the expected attendance of his game. Making such a decision is rarely as\nsimple as setting a straight ratio of one abnormal character for every 20 normal ones;\nit’s more of a sliding scale. For a game of 20 or fewer members, one special approval\nmight be plenty. When the size of the game gets to 50, add in a second. At 75 or 100,\nmaybe one more. In general, you need to keep the special characters to less than 10%\nof the game’s population.\nWith larger games, that percentage should go down, not up, because you will\nnot have full attendance at every session in a large game. You will, however, get\nalmost full attendance from anyone who has spent the time and effort to play a rare\ncharacter type. This phenomenon will create the illusion that the ratio of rare\ncharacters to regular ones is far greater than it really is, because those odd ducks will\ntend to be the more active characters.\nBASIC\nASIC\nASIC\nASIC\nASIC C C C C CHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER A A A A APPROVAL\nPPROVAL\nPPROVAL\nPPROVAL\nPPROVAL\nThe largest crush on any new game is the initial work and time one must spend\non character approvals. To make this daunting task less troublesome, we recommend\nthat you take the following few small steps.\n\n\n45\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nFirst, decide what the demographics for your game will be. Decide your game’s\ntheme and mood, then set the limits of roughly how many rare characters will be allowed\nin at the start. Make sure that both the players and any other Storytellers who are helping\nunderstand the limits and expectations, and that they are prepared to adhere to them.\nSecond, try to complete the majority of your approvals as soon as possible. The\nlonger the task lingers, the less likely you are to be satisfied with the results. For any\ngame of 20 or more characters, the main Storyteller will likely want help from\nNarrators or assistants. Before everything gets busy, meet with any Storytellers you\nhave and spend some time going over the players’ backgrounds and character sheets.\nTurn the meeting into a planning session for your first game, setting aside anywhere\nfrom one night to one week to accomplish the initial planning.\nThird, have a character creation party for your group’s first meeting rather than\nan actual game. Invite as many of the players as you can, and invite them to discuss\ntheir characters’ connections to each other and to the game setting’s history. For\ninstance, are you having a Storyteller character portray the city’s prince and\nprimogen when the game starts, or are the players’ characters going to fill those roles?\nWill the players’ characters be encouraged to play a big role in the governance of the\ncity, or are they trying to bring down the powers that be? Whatever background\nyou’ve written for the setting, use this first gathering of the players as an opportunity\nto meet with them and generate ideas. Players’ characters who enter your game with\nconnections already in place have far more invested into the game than those players\nwho make a character with no pre-existing connections.\nFinally, allot your storytelling team approximately one week to go through all\nof the character sheets and backgrounds before the game. The more time you give\nyourself the better, but try to stick to the same schedule you will be using for games.\nIf you play every other week, then try to get it all ready within a two-week timeframe.\nDon’t let yourself procrastinate on these initial preparations, because it may infringe\non everyone’s enjoyment of playing the game.\nWhen reviewing the backgrounds and sheets, look for plot hooks that can be\nused in various stages of the game. Look for items, such as an Enemy, that can be\nexpanded to affect a sizeable portion of the game. Flaws and other hooks that you can\nshowcase will help draw the spotlighted characters into the chronicle. Players will\nrealize that the characters they’ve created have an impact on the world around them.\nIt is important for players to feel that their characters have significance within the\ngame, especially if you want them to keep coming back.\nOnce the game is underway, you will undoubtedly be asked to approve\ncharacters during game-play while you are trying to attend to other business. If you\nare faced with a player in need of immediate approval and you don’t have the time\nto examine the character sheet in depth, scan the character sheet for obvious abusive\npowers and fuzzy math. If the basics look all right, approve the character for the game.\nThen make sure to tell the player that although the character is approved for this\nsession, he will need to leave it with you at the end of the session so that you can\nexamine it in more detail before the next session. Typically, these steps are sufficient\nfor in-game approval, since they enable you to deal with more pressing game issues.\nUNLEVELING\nNLEVELING\nNLEVELING\nNLEVELING\nNLEVELING T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E P\n P\n P\n P\n PLAYING\nLAYING\nLAYING\nLAYING\nLAYING F F F F FIELD\nIELD\nIELD\nIELD\nIELD\nThe World of Darkness is rarely a level playing field. Most of the Mind’s Eye\nTheatre and tabletop source material makes it clear that no player’s character is ever at\nthe top of the pecking order. Each supernatural setting has someone at the top looking\ndown upon the players’ characters, as well as an entire range of positions in between. A\n\n\n46\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\ngame of vampiric politics in which the Ventrue prince has the same basic statistics as his\ndowntrodden Caitiff antagonists doesn’t offer quite the same dynamic as one can find in\nthe tabletop version of Vampire: The Masquerade. To remedy that disparity, you can\nsimply start some of the characters off with more free Traits than others.\nAt the beginning of a chronicle, the Storyteller needs to decide if he will allow\nanyone to enter play with a more powerful character for the sake of the story. If so,\nthe Storyteller must then decide how he is going to pick who gets to play those more\npowerful characters. This decision is important because the players chosen for these\nmore potent characters must agree to not abuse the power given to them. The\nStorytellers need to keep an eye on the powerful characters and keep those players\ninformed about how they are doing, as well as what the chronicle needs from them.\nEstablishing the personal communications between Storyteller and player in these\nsituations can be a tremendous boon to the game’s flavor.\nOver time, the longer-running characters will accumulate power in ways that\nmake raw statistics irrelevant. As time goes on then, the characters will redistribute the\npower according to the way they roleplay. This approach works best in games that focus\non Laws of the Wild or The Shining Host, since both of those settings have mutable\nin-game hierarchies through which the players’ characters can rise. Being an Elder\nGarou is much more impressive if the character began as a cub and earned the renown\nfor the higher rank through hard experience. In this system, the Storyteller usually has\nto use Storyteller characters to fill in leadership roles that the players’ characters do not\nmeet, then phase those Storyteller characters out as the players’ characters increase in\npower. Vampire games rarely manage to benefit from this approach simply because one\nof its main indicators of power — Generation — is not something that a character\ngenerally earns through play. The problem here is that it does take time for this\napproach to pay off. It can sometimes be a year or more of play before the players’\ncharacters are truly ready to take over the full spectrum of a chronicle’s key characters.\nIf and when you make the decision to make some starting characters in your\nchronicle more equal than others, your sense of fair play (or the players themselves) will\ndemand that you not make the concomitant decision arbitrarily. The following three\nmethods will help you choose which characters to boost or reward as the chronicle begins.\nLOTTERY\nOTTERY\nOTTERY\nOTTERY\nOTTERY\nIf you throw a character creation party before your chronicle’s first session, you\nmight offer your players the chance to participate in a lottery-style drawing. Prepare\na deck of index cards before the party by writing a small bonus award on each and\nshuffling the deck. These awards can range from an extra three to five free Traits to an\nextra level of one Influence to one free Basic level of an out-of-category supernatural\npower of that character’s creature type. Hold this drawing only once, and use it as an\nincentive to attend the pre-chronicle character creation party. This method is the\nmost arbitrary and random of the three, but it remains fair for everyone involved.\nAUDITIONS\nUDITIONS\nUDITIONS\nUDITIONS\nUDITIONS\nIn chronicles in which the size and scope are still limited to approximately a dozen\nclose cities and well under a thousand members, you might hold auditions for key parts\nand more powerful characters. Through the audition system, a Storyteller or a team of\nStorytellers interviews the players for the privilege of playing rare or more powerful\ncharacters. The dangers of this system are obvious — favoritism and workload.\nFavoritism is a frequent problem, no matter what system you use, but it is a particularly\nserious drawback to the audition method. To minimize this potential abuse of power,\nit is recommended that auditions not rely on a single Storyteller but on a team.\n\n\n47\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nThe workload required to hold auditions also presents a real dilemma as the\nchronicle’s number of participants increases. Once a chronicle’s size nears a thousand\nplayers, it becomes extremely difficult to track the rising stars of a chronicle accurately.\nIN- G\n- G\n- G\n- G\n- GA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nA M E B\n B B\n B BONUSES\nONUSES\nONUSES\nONUSES\nONUSES\nThis system can work for any size game, but the overhead devoted to supporting the\nsystem becomes harder to manage as the game grows. This system allows its Storytellers\n(past and present) to come into play with more powerful characters once they become\nregular players themselves. The system might also benefit people who take on other\nactivities that the group wants to emphasize. Storytellers can award extra Experience\nTraits for record-keeping work or for tracking the group’s funds and site fees.\nThe principal danger in this reward method becomes apparent when those players\nwho are doing the work are doing it simply to get a more powerful character rather than\nlooking after the health of the chronicle. Such players will make themselves readily\napparent, however, so spotting them shouldn’t be particularly difficult.\nBALANCING\nALANCING\nALANCING\nALANCING\nALANCING THE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE S S S S SCALES\nCALES\nCALES\nCALES\nCALES\nAs the chronicle matures, characters will die off and be replaced by new ones.\nWhen the chronicle isn’t expected to last any longer than a year, or if it’s confined to\na single group, this fact of life might not present an issue. In larger chronicles, however,\nit can become a real hurdle. When a new player looks at the chronicle from the outside,\nthe chronicle can appear to be a daunting and dangerous setting in which he will be\noverwhelmed by existing characters and plots. The successful chronicle will develop\nways to bring those new players into the fold and help them cope with the opportunities\npresented in such a grand endeavor. Some suggestions follow on doing just that.\nMENTORING\nENTORING\nENTORING\nENTORING\nENTORING\nEvery chronicle has its experts and experienced members. It is a good idea to\nidentify those players who enjoy helping out the new players and who are willing to\nspend some extra time with someone who is still unfamiliar with the game and\nsystem. Building an established network of mentors and then systematically linking\nnew members to them will have lasting positive effects on the chronicle.\nMentors can help with all aspects of integration. They offer newcomers a\nmethod to learn about the ways in which the organization operates, and they keep\nnewcomers from feeling overwhelmed by the systems that keep such a large game\nrunning smoothly. During the game itself, mentors help newcomers find an in-game\nniche and establish the in-game contacts that will allow them to excel. In both\narenas, a well-done mentoring system can have a dramatically beneficial effect.\nIn Laws of the Night chronicles, for instance, a large number of subordinate\ncharacters (such as ghouls and mortal retainers) typically make up the entourage of the\ndead. In Laws of the Wild games, kinfolk and cubs are a great place to start out, because\nthey tend to be sheltered by the older characters by their very nature. Any character who\nis attached to another in a way that removes the need to take a lot of independent action\n— but which still allows the player to be around the action — is a good place to start.\nSETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING S S S S STORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nTORYTELLERS\nA variant on the mentoring approach is to assign a set of Storytellers to each\ndeal with and track smaller portions of the ongoing chronicle. The Setting Storytell-\ners are responsible for maintaining a top-down view of their portion of the game and\nhelping any new members who interested in that part fit in. Therefore, as a new\ncharacter enters the game, he can check in with a Setting Storyteller and look for\nkey links that establish the character in the setting’s history.\n\n\n48\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nThese Storytellers then become “librarians” for the chronicle, storing informa-\ntion about the current makeup of the chronicle and dispensing it to those who need\nit. This information can be a valuable asset and tool for any new player who is trying\nto understand the world he has just stepped into.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E C C C C CONSEQUENCES\nONSEQUENCES\nONSEQUENCES\nONSEQUENCES\nONSEQUENCES S S S S STORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER\nFlaws and Negative Traits come up often during character creation and\nintegration. They provide great hooks to pull the characters into the larger story and\ngame. Likewise, backgrounds can be a way for players to provide wonderful plot\npoints that everyone can share. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these hooks will\nbe ignored unless the Storyteller actively uses them against the players’ characters.\nTherefore, your game may find it very useful to pick one Storyteller to be the\nConsequences Storyteller.\nThis person reads through the players’ character sheets and brings to life the plots\nand problems that the players have already written for their characters. Obviously, no\none can do so effectively for every character in a very large game, but it can be very\neffective to pick perhaps five characters a month and make a point of focusing on those\ncharacters throughout that month. If the Consequences Storyteller times his activities\ncorrectly, these characters will be ones who are not otherwise engaged in the game\nthrough more conventional plots and activities, and this can serve as a way to keep\ncharacters involved who would otherwise be watching the action from the sidelines.\nABILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND B B B B BACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nABILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES\nBILITIES\nACADEMICS\nCADEMICS\nCADEMICS\nCADEMICS\nCADEMICS\nYou possess a level of education and general knowledge beyond rudimentary\nschooling. With Academics, you can express artistic criticism, debate the classics,\nconsider philosophy and indulge in studies of culture. This broad Ability covers all\nsorts of humanities in learning.\nAcademics allows you to recognize historical, art and cultural references. You\ncan use Academics when working in such fields, when developing a critique or\nresearching. Calling on Academics Ability may require a Mental or Social Challenge\nto determine your exact level of competence.\nYou may further direct your studies by choosing a specific field, such as Art\nCriticism, Classical Studies, History, Journalism, Theology or any subject that can be\nstudied with higher education.\nARCHERY\nRCHERY\nRCHERY\nRCHERY\nRCHERY\nYou have studied the difficult skill of using a bow or crossbow. You can care for\nweapons of this type and identify the quality of various bows and arrows. When firing\na bow, you can choose to use your Mental Traits to attack instead of testing with\nPhysical Traits. You may also use this Ability for retests when firing a bow. Also,\nwooden bolts and arrows are quite effective in staking vampires through the heart.\nATHLETICS\nTHLETICS\nTHLETICS\nTHLETICS\nTHLETICS\nYou are skilled in all manner of athletic endeavors due to a background in sports\nor just personal talent. You can throw a ball, sprint, climb, jump and swim with ease.\nThis last talent can be especially useful to vampires, who do not float naturally.\nYour Athletics Ability applies to retests on most forms of raw physical\nactivity — acrobatics, swimming, jumping, throwing, climbing and running —\n\n\n49\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nbut not combat. It also applies to aerial maneuvers for characters that have some\nmeans of flight.\nAWARENESS\nWARENESS\nWARENESS\nWARENESS\nWARENESS\nWith Awareness, you notice that things are not as they should be. This Ability\nis useful in detecting evidence of supernatural powers or beings, as well as sensing\nwhen something contrary to the laws of nature is about to happen.\nBLINDFIGHTING\nLINDFIGHTING\nLINDFIGHTING\nLINDFIGHTING\nLINDFIGHTING\nYou’ve trained to accommodate yourself to low-light conditions, or perhaps you\nhave naturally good night vision. Whichever the case may be, your other senses\ncompensate adequately for darkened conditions. Blindfighting allows you to mitigate the\ntwo-Trait penalty for taking actions in darkness. Each level of this Ability removes one\npenalty Trait. Additionally, you can expend a level of Blindfighting to avoid having to\nretest after each successful challenge in a single turn because of darkness. The character\ncan still use another Ability for a retest in the same challenge if he loses the initial test.\nCRAFTS\nRAFTS\nRAFTS\nRAFTS\nRAFTS\nDepending on your area of expertise, you know how to manufacture items and\nmake handy tools or decorations. You must choose a focus for Crafts and specify\nyour form of creation. Carpentry, Clockworks, Blacksmithing, Leatherworking and\nthe like are all possibilities. You can fashion works of art by studying Painting,\nDrawing or similar physical media. The Crafts Ability also covers more technical\nskills, such as Mechanics and Electronics.\nMaking or repairing an item with Crafts usually involves a Physical Challenge of your\ndexterity, for which the Storyteller sets the difficulty based on the type of job. Making a\nconcealed spring-loaded trap is far more difficult than planing a board, for instance.\nDEMOLITION\nEMOLITION\nEMOLITION\nEMOLITION\nEMOLITION\nYou know how to blow things up. More specifically, you’ve trained in the use\nof various explosives, such as C-4, dynamite and possibly white phosphorous. When\nsetting an explosive, you have a decent chance of arming the device without blowing\nyourself to smithereens. You can also try to disarm explosives with a Static Mental\nChallenge. The difficulty equals the total Mental Traits of the individual who set the\nexplosive. If you do not possess this Ability, you cannot use or disarm explosives at\nall. Similarly, Demolition does not help you aim a thrown bomb or grenade. It simply\nallows you to build, arm and disarm explosive devices.\nNote that the use of explosives in games should be regulated strictly. While in\nreality it is quite easy to acquire or create a myriad of explosive devices and\nsubstances, we must acknowledge that such things rarely aid in the telling of stories.\nDODGE\nODGE\nODGE\nODGE\nODGE\nWhen trouble rears its ugly head, you know how to get out of its way. Unhesitating\nreactions let you evade blows and gunshots. You can use Dodge for a retest when\ndefending against an attack that you can see or sense coming. Dodge is not an appropriate\nretest Ability for challenges in which you are attempting to harm someone.\nENIGMAS\nNIGMAS\nNIGMAS\nNIGMAS\nNIGMAS\nThe Enigmas Ability concerns your ability to solve mysteries and puzzles. In\nessence, it is a measurement of your problem-solving skills and how well you combine\nvital details into a coherent solution. Enigmas comes in handy when solving mazes,\nanswering riddles and the like. This Ability is used with Mental Challenges to see\nif you can figure out the problem before you.\n\n\n50\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nEMPATHY\nMPATHY\nMPATHY\nMPATHY\nMPATHY\nYou are sensitive to the moods and emotions of people around you. When you\nlisten to someone, you understand her feelings. You can identify with others and tell\nwhen people are lying or holding back while talking to you.\nWith a Social Challenge and the expenditure of an Empathy Trait, you can\ndetermine if the last thing that someone said was a lie (although Subterfuge can\ndefend against this expenditure). Alternatively, you can attempt to determine the\nsubject’s current Demeanor.\nETIQUETTE\nTIQUETTE\nTIQUETTE\nTIQUETTE\nTIQUETTE\nEven though knowing which fork to use isn’t terribly important to many\nsupernatural creatures, you do know the proper way to greet someone, when to rise\nand how to make introductions. You can make a toast with the best of them, and you\nkeep your cool in any social scenario, from high tea to a gang’s rally.\nYou can use the Etiquette Ability with Social Tests to impress or blend in at parties.\nIf you make a social faux pas, you may expend an Etiquette Ability immediately to\nnegate the gaffe. After all, your character knew better than to make the mistake.\nEXPRESSION\nXPRESSION\nXPRESSION\nXPRESSION\nXPRESSION\nWords and feelings flow freely from you. When the muse strikes, you put pen\nto paper (or fingers to instrument) and pour out a torrent of emotion and stirring\nimagery. You can convey message and meaning in your art, from symphonies to\npoetry, and whatever you write is both clear and moving.\nWhen you write or compose something in order to generate a specific emotional\nresponse, you may spend one Expression Trait on the effort. Thereafter, a character who\nspends at least one turn contemplating the completed work must engage in a challenge\nof his Social Traits against a static difficulty equal to your Mental Traits. If the viewer\nwins the challenge, he experiences no particular effect. If the viewer loses the\nchallenge, he is overcome with a brief burst of the emotion that you set out to generate.\nHOBBY\nOBBY\nOBBY\nOBBY\nOBBY/ P\n/ P\n/ P\n/ P\n/ PROFESSIONAL\nROFESSIONAL\nROFESSIONAL\nROFESSIONAL\nROFESSIONAL/ E\n/ E\n/ E\n/ E\n/ EXPERT\nXPERT\nXPERT\nXPERT\nXPERT A A A A ABILITY\nBILITY\nBILITY\nBILITY\nBILITY\nIn a certain esoteric area of expertise, you have achieved some level of skill. You\nmay have a small grasp of a trade due to some work on the side, or perhaps you’ve\nstudied a topic specifically.\nHobby/ Professional/ Expert Ability is a catchall category for highly unusual\nAbilities such as Thanatology or Torture. Any Ability of this type must be approved\nspecifically by the Storyteller.\nINTIMIDATION\nNTIMIDATION\nNTIMIDATION\nNTIMIDATION\nNTIMIDATION\nIntimidation represents any of a broad variety of techniques for terrifying people into\ncompliance. Your method of intimidation could be anything from using your physical size\nto wearing a particularly frightening grin to knowing which emotional buttons to push.\nLO R E\nO R E\nO R E\nO R E\nO R E\nLore Abilities are similar to Academics or Science Abilities in that they represent\naccumulated knowledge and training. The difference is that Lore pertains to less\nmundane topics in the World of Darkness. It covers a diverse set of subjects, but most\nare specific to the history and politics of a supernatural type of creature or\norganization of supernatural creatures.\nLore is rated at levels one through five. A player can purchase Lore with\nExperience Traits as with other Abilities, but doing so usually requires special\napproval from the Storyteller. Consult your Storyteller to discover what kind of\n\n\n51\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nlimitations she wishes to impose on each type (or level) of the Lore Ability. Each type\nof Lore is considered to be a separate Ability, so a character could have Camarilla Lore\nx4 and Sabbat Lore x4 without exceeding the maximum level.\nLore is not meant to restrict what information a character can remember about\nwhat he is told in a game. A few bits of information hardly constitutes as lore of the\nsubject (or a valid reason to learn the Lore Ability), even if the information passed\nincludes secrets known only to those with high levels in the Ability. Lore is meant\nto allow characters to know certain important pieces of information from the World\nof Darkness sourcebooks, such as the history of the Silver Fangs or the natural\nweaknesses of changelings.\nOne level of Lore represents a more-than-passing knowledge of the subject, and\nit is the lowest level of understanding that requires Lore to back it up. The character\ncan cite basic, widely known concepts within the lore’s area, such as the Escheat (for\nChangeling Lore) or the Litany (for Garou Lore).\nA second level of Lore represents a higher-than-basic understanding of the subject\nin question. At this level, the character has heard of a few bloodlines, special societies\nor other low-level secrets from within, but he has no expansive knowledge of them.\nHaving three levels of Lore represents a specialized study in the particular\nsubject. This level is generally more common to the leaders and powerful political\nfigures within the subject lore’s area. The character becomes more familiar with the\nworkings of many secret societies, and can probably name a few members. The\ncharacter understands higher-level politics better at this level, as well as some of the\ntruth behind the whispered secrets.\nThose who attain four levels in a Lore are aware of the goals and the movements\nof most of the secret factions within the lore’s area. Their knowledge of the subject’s\nsecrets lays bare the truths to which the elders and ancient texts only allude. Lore at\nthis level and higher represents many elements specific to your chronicle, so work\nclosely with your Storyteller to get the information.\nHaving five levels of Lore represents the pinnacle of understanding. You can\noften expound upon ancient historical texts as though you’d been present at the time\nin question. This level goes beyond the books and delves almost entirely into\nchronicle-specific information.\nMEDITATION\nEDITATION\nEDITATION\nEDITATION\nEDITATION\nYou are able to center your thoughts, calm your emotions, control your mind and relax\nyour body. This Ability is useful for reaching the state of mind necessary for using Psychic\nPhenomenon and regaining True Faith Traits. A Storyteller may allow a character to regain\nWillpower or True Faith Traits by meditating out of play at a game session for an hour and\nmaking a Simple Test for each level of Meditation Ability expended. A success or tie returns\na Willpower Trait (one maximum per session) or a Faith Trait.\nSTEALTH\nTEALTH\nTEALTH\nTEALTH\nTEALTH\nBy blending into cover, blurring your lines and moving carefully and quietly,\nyou can evade notice and sneak past people. You know how best to take advantage\nof surrounding cover and how to use light and shadow. With an appropriate Physical\nChallenge, you can sometimes sneak past the notice of guards and searchers (who\ncontest your Ability with their Mental Traits and Investigation Ability).\nTHROWING\nHROWING\nHROWING\nHROWING\nHROWING\nYou’ve spent a lot of time as a hard-core survivalist with a throwing ax, a\nwannabe ninja with shuriken or an aspiring professional pitcher with baseballs. You\n\n\n52\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nhave the techniques of throwing in combat down pat, and you can hit your targets\nwith ease almost every time. While most people don’t even know how to hold a\nthrowing knife, you’re a virtuoso with any sort of thrown weapon, from a spear to a\nrock. You can use Mental Traits instead of Physical Traits when throwing a weapon,\nand you may use this Ability to retest with thrown objects.\nABILITY\nBILITY\nBILITY\nBILITY\nBILITY S S S S SPECIALIZATIONS\nPECIALIZATIONS\nPECIALIZATIONS\nPECIALIZATIONS\nPECIALIZATIONS\nWithin a given area of expertise, some practitioners further hone their knowl-\nedge to a razor’s edge. By choosing a specialization in an Ability, you hone your skills\nwith a particular facet of that talent.\nAbility specializations are wholly optional. Remember to ask your Storyteller\nbefore taking a specialization.\nTaking a specialization requires that you spend one Experience Trait or free Trait\non an Ability that you already have. Whenever you perform a task with that specializa-\nGETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING L L L L LO R E\nO R E\nO R E\nO R E\nO R E\nHow long should a level of the Lore Ability take to learn? Who should\nhave access to the higher levels? How should it be taught?\nA character can attain a single level of a Lore in just a few months of diligent\nstudy. Learning the second level is more substantial task that requires at least a\nyear of study and training. It is effectively the highest level that one can learn in\nthe course of a live-action chronicle unless the Storyteller does not follow a real-\ntime timeline, and he allows years to pass in the game world between sessions.\nOne attains the third level in a Lore through in-depth study for a decade or more.\nThe fourth level is available only to those who have made it a lifelong study, as\nat least a lifetime is required to attain such a level of scholarly understanding. It\nis effectively the highest level that non-immortal characters can achieve without\nsome means of greatly extending their life span. Attaining the fifth level in a Lore\nis extremely difficult. Those who have achieved this level of expertise have spent\nseveral lifetimes or more in pursuit of knowledge pertaining to the subject.\nTherefore, the fifth level is only truly available to immortal or undead creatures.\nFor the Storyteller, laying down restrictions on the types of Lore available\nto characters becomes more important the larger her game gets. She may wish\nto restrict the number of characters that have access to high levels, or she may\nrestrict out-of-setting Lores. (For instance, a Storyteller in a Shining Host\nchronicle might not allow her players to buy Wraith Lore.) Talk to your\nStoryteller to see what levels and types of Lores she will let you start with.\nAfter character creation, characters must be taught Lore in order to gain more\nlevels in it. Simple observation of the subject can hardly justify learning levels of\nthe Ability. Since it is difficult for one person to teach someone the entirety of her\nknowledge on a subject (especially in an unbiased manner), a character must learn\nLore levels beyond the first from multiple teachers. The number of teachers\nrequired is equal to the level of Lore being learned, and each teacher must have that\nlevel of Lore to be able to teach it. For example, in a game where the Storyteller\nadvances the story line by 50 years or so between games, a character could learn\nBrujah Lore to level four in “downtime” if he had four teachers that each had four\nlevels of that Lore. At your Storytellers discretion, Lore can be learned from tomes\nand texts, but such a source should never count as being more than a single level,\nregardless of how many ancient libraries the character sifts through.\n\n\n53\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\ntion — even if you do not expend the Ability — you gain a one-Trait bonus on resolution\nof challenges, as long as you have at least one Trait of the Ability left. You may have only\none specialization in any given Ability. You cannot take Firearms: Pistols and Firearms:\nRifles together, for instance. You also can never gain more than one bonus Trait at a time\nfrom specializations, even if more than one would be appropriate to a given challenge.\nThat is, even if you have Medicine: Physiology and Science: Biology Research, you get only\na one-Trait bonus on a test of biochemistry, despite your multiple specializations.\nA specialization is a fairly narrow area of research or practice. You cannot, for instance,\ntake a Firearms specialization in “guns,” nor could you have an Occult specialization of\n“writing.” An appropriate specialization refers to one small class of items or to one type of\npractice within the Ability, such as Firearms: Antique Pistols or Occult: Superstitions.\nYou may take a specialization in an Ability with an area of study. In such a case,\nyou concentrate your research in one particular facet of that sub-Ability, or in one\napplication of it. Therefore, you could have Crafts: Woodworking with a specializa-\ntion in Hidden Panels, or Science: Botany with a specialization in Exotic Flora.\nNote that the bonus Trait from a specialization does not have an adjective,\nand it is not bid or used like other Traits. You simply are one Trait up on\nchallenges within the specialization.\nExample: Marcus von Schlagenhanz is an experienced fighter, but he is especially good\nwith fencing weapons. He has Melee x3 with a specialization in fencing. When Marcus engages\na foe in combat, he normally uses his 11 Physical Traits. With a fencing blade, however, he has\n12 Physical Traits because of his intense training. Of course, if he gets tired out or wounded (after\nlosing several challenges), he may not have as many Traits, but as long as he has at least one level\nof his Melee Ability left, he gets to add the one bonus Trait to his remaining Physical Trait total.\nBACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nACKGROUNDS\nYour character’s Backgrounds help flesh out his ties with mundane human\nagencies, as well as reflecting beneficial elements of your character’s history. Each\nBackground works differently. In general, having multiple Traits in a given Back-\nground allows for better or more common use of that benefit, but characters are\nlimited to having no more than five levels in any single Background. Some\nBackgrounds affect your character’s creation and development directly. Others\ncome into play later during the game.\nALLIES\nLLIES\nLLIES\nLLIES\nLLIES\nYou have powerful or useful friends who help you out in your endeavors. You\ncan make a few calls and cut a few deals to get assistance in a wide range of activities.\nYour Storyteller will probably require you to define how you keep your allies and\ntheir relations to you.\nEach Allies Trait possessed represents one person whom you can call upon for aid.\nUnlike Influence, your Allies have special talents that make them better than the average\nperson on the street. Although your allies may not be aware of your supernatural nature\n(if you have any), they can be quite useful if you direct them properly.\nIn general, your allies do not appear during game-play. Instead, you can use\nthem for certain services between play sessions, by notifying your Storyteller.\nAn ally can be directed to follow up on research or activities that you have\nstarted. If you undertook a specific task previously (such as tailing someone,\nresearching a project or building a device), your allies can continue the work, doing\nso with one Ability Trait’s worth of expertise. As long as they work on the project,\nyour Allies Trait for the individual is tied up.\n\n\n54\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nIf you need a particularly competent ally, you can expend multiple Traits to gain\naccess to a mortal with multiple levels of an Ability or Influence. Each Allies Trait\nthat you spend after the first gives an extra level of expertise to your allies. They may\nuse this expertise on your behalf, though rarely with your own skill, and they help\nonly as long as you tie up your Allies Background Traits in this manner.\nBe wary of calling on your allies too often. An ally may call on you for mutual\naid or refuse to help if you press him into dangerous or illegal activities.\nCONTACTS\nONTACTS\nONTACTS\nONTACTS\nONTACTS\nWith the right contacts in all walks of life, you can get a line on all sorts of useful\ninformation. Although having an “ear to the wall” doesn’t necessarily provide you\nwith good help or loyal servants, it does mean that you know whom to ask when\nlooking for the movers and shakers behind the scenes.\nIn game terms, your rating in Contacts allows you to gather rumors and\ninformation. When you call on your contacts, you make a few phone calls, check\nwith likely snitches and grease a few palms. In return, you get rumors and informa-\ntion. Doing so lets you find out exactly what’s going on in the city within a particular\narea. You can get information of a level equal to however many contacts you use. If\nyou use Contacts x3 on Industry Influence, for instance, you get information as if\ndigging up dirt with Industry Influence x3. The advantage of the Contacts Back-\nground is that contacts can be switched from place to place.\nContacts levels can also be spent as Influence to perform the Follow, Trace and\nWatch endeavors.\nUsing Contacts for especially dangerous or secret information may require you to\nspend money or perform a few favors, at the discretion of a Storyteller. On occasion,\naccidents can cause contacts in one area to dry up, such as a strike that affects your\nIndustry contacts, or a particularly unlucky astronomical conjunction sends your\nOccult contacts running for the hills. Your contacts will not generally function as aides\nor lackeys. That sort of service is the purview of the Allies and Retainers Backgrounds.\nFA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nA M E\nSome characters come from the ranks of the wealthy or talented elite. Although such\nnotoriety often fades with the years, your Fame lingers on to influence mundane society.\nFame allows you to exercise your connections over a longer distance than usual.\nCertainly, if you’ve got the right Influence, you can push things around on an\ninterstate or even a national scale, but with Fame, you can just make a few calls and\nexert your Contacts, Influence or Resources over a greater range without any\nimpediment. You do not necessarily have to have Fame to get things done, but it\nhelps. Your total Fame determines your maximum range for unimpeded use of your\nContacts, Influence and Resources.\nFAME\nAME\nAME\nAME\nAME R R R R RANGES\nANGES\nANGES\nANGES\nANGES\nFame Traits\nMaximum Range for Backgrounds\n1\nLocal scene\n2\nCity\n3\nState\n4\nAdjoining states\n5\nEntire country\n\n\n55\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nWhen you make an effort to exert your Contacts, Influence or Resources over a\nlong range, you lean on your popularity and image, which expends your Fame Traits\nuntil the next game session. Fame is most often used in the downtime between\nsessions to facilitate long-range plans.\nIn a less mechanical fashion, your Fame also dictates how recognizable you are\nto members of mundane society, for one reason or another. The Storyteller will\ncertainly make the effects of your Fame apparent, and people may take notice of you\nat bothersome times. Being profiled on America’s Most Wanted or spotted at the\nAcademy Awards does things for one’s reputation, after all.\nFame does have its limitations. Fame does not always indicate widespread\ninstant name recognition. You may be known to only a subset of a particular group,\nor you might just be a recognized expert in a field who’s unknown to those outside.\nMENTOR\nENTOR\nENTOR\nENTOR\nENTOR\nAn older or more experienced individual looks after you and comes to your aid\noccasionally. Whatever the case is, you can get assistance from your mentor,\nalthough his favor may be fickle.\nWhen you call on your mentor, you risk a certain number of Traits to achieve a given\neffect. A lowly one-Trait mentor probably knows only little more than you, while a five-Trait\nmentor may well have luminous standing within your sect and a wide range of potent powers.\nRegardless, taking up your mentor’s valuable time is costly. You must engage in a Simple Test\nwhen you call on your mentor. If you succeed, your mentor deigns to aid you. If you tie, your\nmentor grants you assistance, but he requires something in return. If you fail, your mentor\ndemands the favor first before helping. In any case, you can call on your mentor only once in\nany given game session, and only if you have an appropriate way to contact him or her.\nThe level of aid that your mentor can give depends on the number of Traits you\nhave in this Background (and Storyteller approval, of course):\n• For one Trait, your mentor is privy to a single piece of specialized information\nat a level above your own. If you have Wraith Lore x2, for instance, your mentor can\nbe called on to gift you with one piece of information from Wraith Lore x3.\n• For two Traits, you can borrow one level of Contacts, Influence, Resources or\nStatus from your mentor for the duration of the game. If your mentor is very powerful\n(four or five Traits), you can borrow two levels.\n• Having two Traits allows your mentor to instruct you in a Basic power that\nyou do not know.\n• For three Traits, your mentor can instruct you in an Intermediate power that\nyou do not know.\n• Also at a cost of three Traits, your mentor can train you in the ways of a special\nHobby/ Professional/ Expert Ability that is outside your normal ken, such as Mage Lore.\n• For four Traits, your mentor can train you in an Advanced power beyond your grasp.\n• For five Traits, your mentor can train you in the phenomenal powers of the\nelders, if you are puissant enough to learn such secrets.\nSince mentors can prove unbalancing by providing too many different powers\nover the course of a long game, the Storyteller may lower your total Mentor Traits\nas you call on his knowledge. This decrease represents the fact that as your character\nlearns the mentor’s secrets; the mentor has less left to teach.\nRESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nESOURCES\nYou have access to liquid capital and spending money. You also have some solid\nresources that you can use when times are tight. Unlike the use of Finance, these\n\n\n56\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nresources are always readily available, and they come to you automatically due to\nyour investments, jobs and holdings.\nYour number of Resources Traits determines the amount of money and capital\nthat you can secure. By expending temporary Resources Traits (which return at the\nnext game session), you can draw on your regular income, as shown in the\naccompanying table. If you expend permanent Resources, you can divest yourself of\nholdings, allowing access to 10 times the amount shown on the table. However, the\nlimits of what you can buy are always adjudicated by the Storyteller. Truly powerful\nuses of Resources are best left to downtimes and moderation between game sessions.\nRESOURCE\nESOURCE\nESOURCE\nESOURCE\nESOURCE A A A A ALLOCATION\nLLOCATION\nLLOCATION\nLLOCATION\nLLOCATION\nTraits\nIncome\n0\nPoverty. $200.

You own a large house or some\nsmall properties, two vehicles, some luxuries and unusual items.\n5\nRich. $30,000. You own an estate and grounds, multiple small\nproperties, several vehicles, treasures and luxury items.\nRETAINERS\nETAINERS\nETAINERS\nETAINERS\nETAINERS\nWhether out of personal loyalty, love, supernatural coercion or some other\nmeans, you have managed to secure the fellowship of a person (or small group) who\nobeys your every whim. Unlike your allies, your retainers are nearly always around,\noverseeing your personal effects, defending your property and furthering your goals.\nThey may not have the specialized knowledge of allies, but they are mostly loyal to\nyour cause, and they serve your needs first.\nYou should work with your Storyteller to determine how you managed to secure\na loyal retainer. Your retainer’s exact capabilities are up to the Storyteller. A retainer\nmay be skillful but unmotivated, or loyal but inept. No retainer is ever perfect, but\nhe can be a great help nonetheless.\n• A retainer can be assigned to watch over a particular location. Generally, if someone\nattempts to break into your house, the retainers there will attempt to stop the intruder.\n• A retainer can manage your assets and perform tasks. Retainers who are tied\nup in this fashion allow you to manage more Influence than normal. They add to the\nnumber of Attribute Traits that you possess for purposes of counting your total\nInfluences. Each retainer directed in this fashion adds one to your maximum\nInfluence Traits. If retainers are later lost, killed or reassigned, the excess Influence\nTraits disappear, starting with the highest levels of Influence held you hold.\n• A retainer can perform other menial functions, as allowed by the Storyteller.\nIf it becomes necessary to have a character sheet for a retainer, use the standard\nmortal creation guidelines.\nINFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nThe additional Influence rules here expand upon the systems presented in the\nvarious Mind’s Eye Theatre source books. They are intended to add a level of\n\n\n57\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nintrigue to larger games, facilitating a shadow war of characters struggling behind the\nscenes to maintain their tenuous grip on the mundane world.\nKEEPING\nEEPING\nEEPING\nEEPING\nEEPING I T\nI T\nI T\nI T\nI T F F F F FU N\nU N\nU N\nU N\nU N\nFor the Storyteller, it is important to maintain the flavor of Influences when\nusing them in a game. Being descriptive when reporting the results of Influence\nendeavors to the players is critical. Otherwise the interactions of Influences in a city\nwill degrade into a sub-game of number-crunching, in which no story is being told\nat all. Much of the burden of this task falls upon the shoulders of the players\nthemselves. When a player wishes to perform an endeavor, the Storyteller should\nhave her give him a write-up of the activity, complete with a description of exactly\nhow her Influences are going about executing the desired task. Examples of\ndescriptive use of Influence are given with each new endeavor type.\nPOSSESSING\nOSSESSING\nOSSESSING\nOSSESSING\nOSSESSING A N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D U\n U\n U\n U\n USING\nSING\nSING\nSING\nSING I I I I INFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nNFLUENCE\nYou cannot manage more Influence than the sum of your permanent Physical,\nSocial and Mental Traits. This limit counts against all of your total Influence —\nyour combined levels cannot exceed this total. After all, there are only so many\nthings you can do in a day.\nWhen you exercise Influence, you expend temporary Influence Traits. The tables for\nvarious Influence areas detail what you can do with a specific number of Traits. Performing\nan endeavor requires a number of Traits equal to the level of the action. Therefore, with\nhigh levels of Influence, you can perform many small actions or a few significant ones. To\nperform the new Influence endeavors presented here (such as Attack, Grow and Watch),\nyou must spend Traits just as you would for endeavors on the traditional charts.\nCertain levels of Influence gift you with items, money or aides. Unlike the\nResources Background, money and equipment garnered with Influence does not come\nautomatically each month. If you want a steady income from Influence, you must direct\nyour Influence in that direction continually, and this income does not come with any\nassociated trappings of wealth. (You’d have to buy a house and car separately, for\ninstance.) Aides garnered with Influence generally help for only one specific task, and\nthey usually have the equivalent of only one level of Ability in their area of skill. For\nmore competent and readily available help, take the Allies Background.\nMost cities have only a set amount of Influence in various areas. For instance,\nAtlanta has a great deal of Transportation Influence, while Hollywood would have a lot\nof High Society and Media Influence. A Rust-Belt city in which manufacturing and\nheavy industry has all but disappeared would have very little to no Industry Influence.\nStorytellers should map out the total amount of each type of Influence to be had in\nthe city setting. Once all of the Influence of a given type is used up, the only way to get more\nis to use existing Influence to grow that area of society (making new projects or sponsoring\ninvestment) or to destroy someone else’s Influence and free up those resources. Also, each\ncity may have different reflections of the Influences listed here. A city with a thriving\nindependent film community is going to have a different picture of Media or High Society\nInfluence than a city in which the arts are being literally starved out due to budget cuts.\nBureaucracy\nYou can manage various government agencies and bureaus. By dealing with social\nprograms and public servants, you can spin red tape, bypass rules and regulations or twist\nbureaucratic regimentation to your advantage. Bureaucracy is useful in operating or\nshutting down businesses, faking or acquiring permits and identification papers and\nmanipulating public utilities and facilities. Government clerks at the city and county level,\nutility workers, road crews, surveyors and other civil servants are potential contacts or allies.\n\n\n58\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nCost\nEffect\n1\nTrace utility bills\n2\nFake a birth certificate or driver’s license\nDisconnect a single small residence’s utilities\nClose a small road or park\nGet public aid ($250)\n3\nFake a death certificate, passport or green card\nClose a public school for a single day\nShut down a minor business on a violation\n4\nInitiate a phone tap\nFake land deeds\nInitiate a department-wide investigation\n5\nStart, stop or alter a city-wide program or policy\nShut down a big business on a violation\nRezone areas\nObliterate records of a person on a city or county level\nChurch\nAlthough the modern church has arguably less control over temporal society\nthan it did in the Middle Ages, church policies still exert considerable influence over\nthe direction of politics and communities. Knowing the appropriate people gives a\ncharacter insight into many mainstream religions, such as Christianity, Judaism,\nIslam, Hinduism, Shinto or Buddhism. (Fringe or alternative groups, such as\nScientology, are the purview of the Occult Influence.) When you exercise Church\nInfluence, you can change religious policy, affect the assignment of clergy and access\na variety of lore and resources. Contacts and allies affected by Church Influence\nwould include ministers, priests, bishops, Church-sponsored witch-hunters, holy\norders and various attendees and assistants.\nCost\nEffect\n1\nIdentify most secular members of a given faith in the local area\nPass as a member of the clergy\nPeruse general church records (baptism, marriage, burial, etc.)\n2\nIdentify higher church members\nTrack regular church members\nSuspend lay members\n3\nOpen or close a single church\nFind the average church-associated hunter\nDip into the collection plate ($250)\nAccess private information and archives of a church\n4\nDiscredit or suspend high-level church members\nManipulate regional branches of the church\n5\nOrganize major protests\nAccess ancient church lore and knowledge\nFinance\nManipulating markets, stock reports and investments is a hobby of many,\nespecially those who use their knowledge to keep their wealth hidden.

It is important to note that Influence can generally only affect other Influences\nof the same type. A character can use his Street Influence to aggress another player’s\nStreet Influence, but he would have a hard time getting it to interact with a player’s\nHigh Society Influence successfully.\nAttack\nYou can Attack another’s Influence with your own, provided you have\npreviously Traced the target Influence. To Attack, you assign a number of Influence\nTraits, and that number becomes the level of the Attack endeavor. If the level\n\n\n65\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nexceeds the victim’s Influence level, the victim drops a level of her Influence at the\nend of the month. Traits banked for Growth are lost as well, even if they would have\ngiven the victim a new, higher level Influence at the beginning of the next month.\nMechanics Example: Scott and Wade both have Media Influence, at levels five\nand two respectively. Scott Traced Wade’s Influence successfully last month, and he\ndesires to make an Attack upon it this month. He spends four Traits on the endeavor,\nmeaning that the Attack’s level is four. Since the level of Scott’s Attack is greater than\nthe level of Wade’s Media Influence, Wade will only have a level-one Media to work\nwith next month. If Wade had been spending Traits for Growth, and had accumulated\nthree or more, he would immediately apply three of them to bring it back to level two.\nDescriptive Example: When Scott made his character, he decided that his Media Influence\nwould be represented by his control over various media moguls through Blood Bonding and the use\nof Dominate. To Attack Wade’s Influence, Scott performed the necessary prerequisite of\nsucceeding in a Trace on it. Having done so, Scott discovered that Wade’s Media Influence was\nrepresented by his control over one of the city’s major newspapers. When writing an explanation\nof the Attack endeavor for the Storyteller, Scott describes influencing his media mogul thralls to have\ntheir networks broadcast a television news story about Wade’s newspaper. The television news story\nhighlights the paper’s “long history of poorly researched news articles” and describes a number of\nincidents in which the paper was forced to print retractions. The television news story goes on to rate\nthe various other papers in the city, giving them a far more favorable rating than Wade’s paper.\nWhen the Storyteller looks at the Influence numbers and decides that Scott’s Attack is successful,\nhe informs both Scott and Wade of the resulting decline in the paper’s circulation, which represents\nWade’s Media Influence dropping to level one at the beginning of the next month.\nBlock\nYou can use your Influence to prevent Influence endeavors from taking place for\nthat month. Any action from the other sourcebooks may be blocked, provided that\nyour Influence level is at least equal to the endeavor’s level on the chart. The Block’s\neffective level is the total number actions spent toward it. A Block will affect all\nattempts at the selected endeavor during that month; anyone attempting the Blocked\naction in the city will not succeed unless they have added enough levels of Boost to the\nendeavor. Multiple Blocks against the same endeavor type are not cumulative in effect.\nIf more than one Block is put in place on the same endeavor, use only the highest level\nwhen calculating the success of those attempting the endeavor.\nMechanics Example: Jana has four levels of Legal Influence. Because she is\ncapable of arranging a parole, she is therefore able to put a Block on that endeavor\ntype as well. She decides to spend two of her Legal Influence Traits to create a level\ntwo Block. Anyone wishing to arrange a parole in the city that month must spend\ntwo or more additional Influence Traits into Boost in order to be successful.\nDescriptive Example: When Jana made her character, she decided that an extensive\nnetwork of judges, lawyers and corrections facility officials who are accepting bribes from\nher would represent her Legal Influence. Now that one of Jana’s character’s enemies has\njust been arrested, she doesn’t want anyone to arrange for his parole. When writing an\nexplanation of the Block endeavor for the Storyteller, Jana describes bribing members of the\nparole board to stop proceedings, or at least delay them until the end of the month.\nBoost\nBoost is simply a term used to describe spending additional unneeded Influence\nTraits to perform an endeavor, just in case someone has put up a Block that needs\nto be overcome. If the Traits spent into Boost equal the level of the Block, the action\nis successful. The Block does not go away if one action beats it, though. It can still\nbe effective against any additional attempts at that endeavor in that month.\n\n\n66\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nMechanics Example: Mathew has used a Trait of his Health Influence put a\nlevel one Block on getting mortal blood. Sue attempts to acquire a Blood Trait using\na Trait of her level-four Health Influence. When the Storyteller informs her that she\nis not successful because of a Block, Sue tries it again, this time adding her last two\nTraits into Boost, thereby raising the cost of her second attempt to three Health\nInfluence Traits. Since the level of the Boost is at least equal to the level of the Block,\nSue is successful, and she acquires the Blood Trait.\nDescriptive Example: When Sue made her character, she decided that ownership of\na small, private clinic would represent her Health Influence. She uses her clout to have a\nsmall amount of blood delivered to her while she is off-site. She finds out that there is a major\nshortage of blood in the city and that her request for whole blood isn’t prioritized highly\nenough to acquire it (thanks to Mathew’s Block). Sue’s second attempt is backed by an\nurgent request from two of her clinic’s doctors, who falsely claim to need the whole blood\nfor an emergency surgery. This time, the request is granted.\nCombine\nCombine allows you to aid the Influence endeavor of another character. No action\non the Mind’s Eye Theatre sourcebook charts can be attempted by a character who doesn’t\nhave the required Influence level according to that chart. For every two Traits that you\nspend on Combine, the character you are helping gains one action to use toward his\nendeavor. Influence borrowed through the Allies and Mentor Backgrounds are also subject\nto this rule. A character can spend no more than 20 Traits toward a single endeavor in any\ngiven month, including all actions spent for modifications such as Combine.\nMechanics Example: Corey has four levels of Political Influence. He wants to enact\nsome minor legislation in the city, which would cost him all four of his Political Influence\nTraits for the month. Corey has already used a Political Influence Trait this month, so he\ndoesn’t have enough. He asks a friend to Combine her Political Influence with his. Cynthia\nhas only two levels, but she loans them both to Corey. Since the number of Traits loaned\nis effectively halved when using Combine, Corey nets only one extra Political Influence\nTrait for the month, but that’s all he needs to enact the minor legislation.\nDescriptive Example: When Corey made his character, he decided that blood bonding the\ncity’s mayor would represent his Political Influence. Since he’d already had the mayor ask the city\ncouncil for a small favor this month, he knows that getting him to push for the minor legislation would\nbe straining the mayor’s authority. Corey asks his ally Cynthia to help him with the endeavor, using\nCombine. Cynthia manipulates a member of the city council through regular uses of Dominate,\nand she has this council member propose the minor legislation. With the issue on the table, the mayor\ncan throw his full support into it without burdening his relationship with the council.\nConceal\nConceal can be used to hide your Influence from uses of Trace. The number of\nactions spent toward Conceal generates that month’s Conceal level, which you pit\nagainst attempts to Trace it.\nMechanics Example: Jess has heard a rumor that Tim is going to Trace his\nUniversity Influence. He spends all four of his University Traits to generate a level-\nfour Conceal over them. For three months in a row, he continues to spend his four\nTraits on Conceal. On the fourth month, Jess hopes that Tim has lost interest in his\nUniversity Influence, and goes back to using it for Growth.\nDescriptive Example: When Jess created his character, he decided that his University\nInfluence would be represented by the sway he has gained by providing major contributions to\nthe local universities in the past few years. Now that he fears that Tim will be able to follow the\npaper trail of his donations (Tim’s Trace), Jess quickly uses his clout to convince the universities\nthat the records of his donations and other dealings should be suppressed for the time being.\n\n\n67\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nDefend\nYou use the Defend endeavor when you fear that someone is going to Attack\nyour Influence. To employ this special endeavor, assign a number of Traits as the\nlevel of the defense. The level of any Attacks directed at that Influence must exceed\nthe Defend level plus the level of your Influence in order to be successful.\nMechanics Example: Eric fears that someone is going to attack his Underworld\nInfluence this month, so he puts up a defense to protect it. He assigns three of his four\nUnderworld Traits to the defense. An incoming Attack must now be level eight or\nhigher to affect his Influence.\nDescriptive Example: When Eric made his character, he decided that his Under-\nworld Influence would be represented by his control of the Lasciano Family, a major\norganized crime syndicate. Fearing an Attack, Eric writes a description of his Defend\nendeavor, detailing how he is having all of the family members lay low for a while, out of\nthe sight of other crime families and the authorities.\nFollow\nIf you want to keep an eye on what someone is doing with his Influence, you can\nattempt to Follow them with your own. Follow is similar to Watch, except that it only keeps\na lookout for actions performed by a single Influence. To Follow someone’s Influence, you\nmust have a successful Trace on it already. To use Follow, assign a number of Traits to\nestablish the level of the endeavor. The Follow endeavor will reveal all activities performed\nby the targeted Influence, less any activities hidden with an equal or higher level of Stealth.\nMechanics Example: Jean successfully used her level-three Occult Influence to\nperform a Trace on Toby’s Occult Influence several months ago. This month, Jean\nis curious as to what Toby is up to, so she spends all three Traits of Occult Influence\nto Follow Toby’s Occult activities. She finds out that Toby attempted to acquire a\nminor magical item. If Toby had put three or more levels of Stealth on that endeavor,\nJean would not have been able to detect it.\nDescriptive Example: When creating her character, Jean decided that her level-three\nOccult Influence would be represented by her hold over a couple of millennium cults dedicated\nto the research of mystical writings and prophecies. With the successful Trace, Jean discovered\nthat Toby’s Occult Influence is represented by his sway over an organized group of “psychics”\nwhose clientele are powerful and wealthy VIPs in the city. When Jean writes down her Influence\nactivities for the Storyteller, she describes how she will have the leaders of her cults direct their\nfollowers to research groups of “psychics” in the city, specifically the group that Toby controls.\nGrowth\nTo raise one of your Influences to the next level, you must spend a number of\nTraits equal to three times your current level. In general, you can gain a new level in\nan Influence once every three months, provided you are using your Influence for\nnothing else. Unlike other endeavors, Traits spent for Growth can be banked from\nmonth to month. When you bank Traits thus, they accumulate until you reach the\nnumber required for an increase. If you meet the number of Traits required to increase\nto the next level, the Influence level improves by one at the end of the month.\nMechanics Example: Cheyana has three levels of Street Influence, meaning she\nwould need nine Traits spent to get to level four. In one month, she spends two of\nher three Traits on Growth (two banked). In the next month, she spends two more\nTraits on Growth (four banked). In the month following that, she spends all three\nTraits on Growth (seven banked). In the fourth month, Cheyana spends two more\nTraits on Growth, meeting the requirement to achieve level four. At the end of the\nmonth, her Street Influence improves by one. Cheyana could have grown her Street\nInfluence a little faster if she had spent all of her actions on Growth each month.\n\n\n68\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nDescriptive Example: Cheyana decided when she made her character that a network of\ninformants consisting of gang members, homeless people and prostitutes would represent her Street\nInfluence. When writing a description of her Growth activities for the Storyteller, Cheyana describes\nencouraging her contacts in several gangs to push for mergers with other gangs across the city. The\nnext month, she describes organizing the homeless people into small “communities” for safer living,\nwhich draws more homeless people into the area to spy for her. The month following, Cheyana\ndescribes convincing the prostitutes that sometimes report to her to recruit more prostitutes to her\ncause. In the fourth month, she describes working with the gangs again to direct their spare time\ntoward more high-profit activities such as the buying and selling of guns and other contraband. Now\nthat Cheyana has strengthened her contacts enough to warrant an increase in her Influence, the\nStoryteller agrees to raise her Street to level four at the end of the month.\nStealth\nStealth is added to endeavors to counter the use of Follow and Watch. If the\nnumber of Traits spent to add Stealth to an endeavor equals or exceeds the level of the\nFollow or Watch, the endeavor is remains undetected. Stealth can be applied to any\nof the actions on the charts, as well as to Attack, Block, Follow, Growth or Watch.\nMechanics Example: Donny wishes to use his Finance Influence to raise the capital\nto purchase a small business. Doing so would normally only require two of his five Finance\nInfluence Traits, but because Donny doesn’t want anyone else to know what he’s up to,\nhe throws in the other three Traits for Stealth. If someone had instituted a Watch of level\nthree or less to notice that activity in the city, she would not detect Donny’s sneaky\nacquisition of the capital. If the observer had put up a Watch of level four or higher,\nDonny’s stealth would not have hidden him from her prying eyes.\nDescriptive Example: When Donny made his character, he decided to have his\nFinance Influence be represented by his controlling interest in a large acquisitions company.\nWhen writing out his Influence activities for the Storyteller, Donny describes the added\nStealth as using a large network of dummy corporations through which to move the money\nso that it could not be tracked back to him through his acquisitions company.\nTrace\nYou can use this endeavor to establish the identity of a character whose Influence\nyou have come into contact with. You cannot simply guess that a character has an\nInfluence in a particular category and then attempt to Trace it. You must first have come\ninto contact with it in one of the several ways. This can be accomplished by suffering an\nAttack from the target’s Influence, by noticing one of the target’s endeavors with the use\nof Watch, by stopping one of the target’s endeavors with a Block, or by having one your\nown endeavors stopped by the target’s use of Block. Additionally, if someone ever loans\nyou Influence Traits with Combine, you can Trace them. Finally, if the target ever tells\nyou in great detail about his Influence (i.e., agrees to let you Trace it), you can perform\nthe Trace. The total actions spent on the Trace define its level. If the level of this Trace\nexceeds the highest level of Conceal or Stealth put up to guard the Influence that month,\nthe Trace is successful. Success tells you the Influence owner’s identity, and whether their\nInfluence level is higher than your own or not. It also gives you a general description of\nthe Influence and the ability to spend Traits to Attack it.\nUsing Trace is specific to one city. Therefore, if a character has Influence of the same\ntype in more than one city, your Trace only tells you about the Influence in the city you\nare searching. If you have succeeded in a Trace on an Influence, you may not simply relay\nthat information to someone else for his or her Influence to make an Attack on. The\ninformation is too complex for them to relay to their own Influence contacts without them\nactually performing a Trace themselves. If you have performed a successful Trace, you can\nrelay enough information for someone else to perform a Trace with his or her own Influence.\n\n\n69\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nMechanics Example: Pauline has a level-four Police Influence. Recently her\nattempt to access confiscated weapons was stopped by Carl’s level-two Block.\nHaving established contact, Pauline decides to Trace the influence. The next\nmonth, she spends all four Traits to Trace. Carl, who has level-five Police\nInfluence, is spending two Traits to Block again this month, and because he fears\nothers will Trace him, he puts his remaining three Traits into Conceal. As the\nlevel of Pauline’s Trace more than equals the level of Carl’s Conceal, Pauline\ndiscovers that the Influence that blocked her endeavor last month belongs to Carl.\nShe discovers its general description (defined by Carl when he created his\ncharacter) and that its level is higher than hers.\nDescriptive Example: When Pauline made her character, she decided that her bribery\nand blackmail of the members of the local precinct would represent her Police Influence. To make\na Trace, Pauline writes up her Influences activities for the Storyteller as simply having every one\nof her contacts poke around until they discover who tightened the security on the confiscated\nweapons lock-up. After all, the police are supposed to be practiced investigators, right?\nWatch\nYou use Watch when you want to notice a certain Influence action in a city from\nthe chart listed in the sourcebooks. Your Influence must be of sufficient level to\nperform that action before you can Watch it. A Watch will let you know when and\nhow often the action is attempted in the city for that month, and you will even\ndiscover uses of the action that occurred earlier in the same month before the Watch\nwas instituted. The total number of Traits spent on the Watch define its level. You\ncan also use Watch to look for the following endeavors: Attack, Block, Follow (only\nthose targeted at you), Growth and Watch.\nMechanics Example: Mark decides to spend one of his five Church Influence\nTraits into a Watch this month. He decides to Watch for individuals attempting to\ncontact church-associated hunter groups. Because Mark is paranoid, he decides to\nput up a level-two Watch on the Watch activity to see if anyone else is doing the\nsame thing. Mark’s Watch for individuals attempting to contact church-associated\nhunter groups doesn’t get him anything. His second Watch (the one on the Watch\nendeavor) notices his own Watch of course, and discovers that someone has put up\na Watch to notice anyone attempting to peruse general church records.\nDescriptive Example: Mark decided when he created his character to have his\nChurch Influence be represented by an extensive network of blackmail against highly placed\nmembers of the local churches. When writing up his activities for the Storyteller, Mark\ndescribes how his blackmailed network of priests, deacons and elders are going on “crusades”\nwithin their various churches to discover any corrupting Influences that might be at work.\nThey are using their authority to persuade other impressionable church members to report\nany suspicious activities or requests to them immediately.\nWH E N\nH E N\nH E N\nH E N\nH E N T O\nT O\nT O\nT O\nT O R\n R R\n R RESOLVE\nESOLVE\nESOLVE\nESOLVE\nESOLVE A A A A ACTIONS\nCTIONS\nCTIONS\nCTIONS\nCTIONS\nFor the purpose of these rules, Influence Traits spent on endeavors return at the\nbeginning of the month after they are spent. The Storyteller may desire to extend\nthis time for large games that run less often than once a month. Either way, this\nperiod of time should remain constant, giving all of the players the same opportunity\nto employ their Influences on a regular basis.\nAttack, Follow, Growth, Trace and Watch endeavors should only be resolved at\nthe end of the month. This limit gives everyone a chance to put up levels of Conceal,\nDefense and Watch, and it lets the Storyteller take everyone’s Influence actions into\naccount so that he can produce better descriptive results of each person’s endeavors.\n\n\n70\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E S S S S SCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F I I I I INFLUENCES\nNFLUENCES\nNFLUENCES\nNFLUENCES\nNFLUENCES\nAs stated previously, an Influence can only affect Influence from the same\ncategory. In very rare circumstances, the Storyteller may allow Influences from one\ncategory to assist endeavors in another, but only in the same city. In this case, each\naction is spent as though it was only half of an action. In this way, it is even possible\nfor you to simulate the effects of Combine by loaning Influence to yourself from\nanother category. This type of cross-category Influence use should be rare, and it\nshould be regulated strictly lest it become a common thing. You may have Influences\nin multiple cities (subject to local Storyteller approval), which are considered to be\nentirely separate Influences even if they are of the same category.\nGAMES\nAMES\nAMES\nAMES\nAMES I N\nI N\nI N\nI N\nI N M\n M\n M\n M\n MO R E\nO R E\nO R E\nO R E\nO R E THAN\nTHAN\nTHAN\nTHAN\nTHAN O\n O O\n O\n ON E\nN E\nN E\nN E\nN E C C C C CITY\nITY\nITY\nITY\nITY\nSome endeavors on the Influence charts state that they can affect an area larger\nthan a city, but this can be difficult to run for large-scale games. In a network game,\nyou will need to clear an Influence action or endeavor that is intended to affect\nanother city with the Storyteller from the member chronicle who presides over the\ncity you are trying to affect.\nIf you wish to attempt an endeavor in a city other than the one in which your Influence\nis located, you may attempt to do so, but each action is effectively halved. If you wish to affect\na city on another continent, then each Trait you spend functions as one quarter of a Trait.\nSYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nThese systems are optional, but they have been developed by the Camarilla\n(White Wolf’s official fan organization) to suit large-scale games more easily. Some\nof the systems have been included in only the most recent Minds’ Eye Theatre\npublications, so they are reprinted here to be usable in any live-action setting.\nMISCELLANEOUS\nISCELLANEOUS\nISCELLANEOUS\nISCELLANEOUS\nISCELLANEOUS S S S S SYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nRETESTS\nETESTS\nETESTS\nETESTS\nETESTS\nA character may retest a single challenge only once from each of the following\ncategories, when applicable: Abilities, Willpower, Merits or supernatural powers\n(Disciplines, Gifts, etc.). For example, a character resisting Dread Gaze could use one\nAbility Trait to retest (as could his opponent), but he could not use a second Ability\nfor another retest. If he fails the challenge even after his Ability retest, he may still\ncall for another retest from another category, such as Willpower.\nWhen a character calls for a retest to a challenge, his opponent can employ an\nappropriate retest to negate it. The retest used to negate must be from the same\ncategory. A retest called for with a Willpower Trait may not be negated in this manner.\nEXTENDED\nXTENDED\nXTENDED\nXTENDED\nXTENDED C C C C CHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nExtended Challenges are often too cumbersome for quick play in large games.\nWhen engaging in an Extended Challenge, the player may optionally perform the\nfirst test as normal, gaining one “success” if he wins the test. If he gets that first\n“success,” he can opt to spend up to four additional Attribute Traits from the\nappropriate category to gain extra “successes.” For example, a wraith attempts to use\nMindspeak (Basic Mnemosynis). After winning the Mental Challenge, the wraith\nmay spend up to four Mental Traits for extra successes. With this system, or the\noriginal system, no power that relies upon Extended Challenges to inflict varying\ndegrees of damage should be allowed to inflict more than three levels of damage per\napplication, regardless of the number of “successes.”\n\n\n71\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nORDER\nRDER\nRDER\nRDER\nRDER O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F C C C C CHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nHALLENGES\nA single character may be subjected to only one Mental and one Social\nChallenge in a turn.

If the character has four\nor more levels of the Ability appropriate to the weapon being used (i.e., Firearms,\nMelee, etc.), he may add one to the number of Bonus Traits given by the weapon he\nis using. Characters using a weapon and a shield are required to have only one level\nof Melee to make use of the shield’s additional Trait(s).\nDuring the challenge, only one weapon is considered to have a damaging effect, while\nthe other simply aids with parrying or spraying. Therefore, a character with Incendiary\nammunition in one pistol and Armor-piercing rounds in the other may not take advantage\nof both types of ammunition in the same attack (although rounds from both guns would\nbe expended). For another example, a character with Baal’s Caress on his sword, and a Ward\nversus Kindred on his dagger could not apply both effects to the same attack.\nCOMBAT\nOMBAT\nOMBAT\nOMBAT\nOMBAT I N\nI N\nI N\nI N\nI N D\n D\n D\n D\n DARKNESS\nARKNESS\nARKNESS\nARKNESS\nARKNESS\nIn darkness, characters suffer a two-Trait Penalty on all combat challenges. In\nthe case of absolute darkness (or blindness) they must also retest any successful\nchallenges that they make (once per challenge), unless their opponent is suffering\nthe same penalty for darkness. Certain powers can affect the Trait penalty, while\nothers can allow the character to disregard darkness penalties altogether.\nHEALTH\nEALTH\nEALTH\nEALTH\nEALTH\nA character in a Mind’s Eye Theatre game has different health levels that represent\nthe amount of injury the character can endure. These levels include: Healthy, Healthy,\nBruised, Bruised, Bruised, Wounded, Wounded, Incapacitated, Torpor and/or Final\nDeath. If a Healthy character loses two health levels from a combat challenge, she\nbecomes Bruised. If she loses three more health levels, she becomes Wounded, and so on.\n• Healthy — When a character is Healthy, he is virtually or completely\nuninjured. He suffers no penalty aside from possibly being cosmetically scuffed up a bit.\n• Bruised — A Bruised character is more seriously roughed up, and his injuries have\nstarted to impair his viability a bit. He is considered one Trait down on all tied challenges.\n• Wounded — When a character is Wounded, he is seriously injured in one\nor more locations. To reflect this injury, he must risk an additional Trait to attempt\na challenge, and his opponent wins all ties, regardless of who has more Traits. If\nthe injured character has a power which normally allows him to win all ties, ties\nare resolved through comparing Traits instead. Note: A character may always\nattempt to overbid.\n\n\n72\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\n• Incapacitated — When a character is Incapacitated, he is completely out of\nplay for at least 10 minutes. Once awake, the character is still effectively immobile,\nalthough he may whisper pained sentences. He may not enter into challenges until\nhe has healed at least one health level. He is at the mercy of other characters, and\nhe may do nothing more than heal himself.\n• Mortally Wounded — Bleeding profusely and suffering from shock, a Mortally\nWounded individual has little time left. Mortally Wounded characters do not regain\nconsciousness normally. Instead, the character loses one Physical Trait every 20 minutes.\nOnce the character runs out of Physical Traits, he dies. Only the assistance of someone\nwith the Medicine Ability can halt this inexorable loss, and the character will not even\nbegin to heal unless he is treated by magic or full hospital resources. Vampires who are\ninjured beyond Incapacitated fall into a deathlike sleep known as torpor.\n• Death — To kill a character in combat requires that the character first be brought\nto the Mortally Wounded or Torpor health level. His attacker must then declare that he\nis performing a “killing blow” and defeat him in a Physical Challenge. Vampires can be\nkilled thus only if the blow involves aggravated damage or decapitation.\nIf a character is at the Mortally Wounded/ Torpor health level and is left in a\nposition that would logically lead to his demise, such as in a flaming building or a\ntrash compactor, the Narrator will declare the character to be dead after the\nappropriate amount of time.\nNarrators should never allow an “instant kill” without the consent of the target\n(i.e., he agrees to die for story purposes). An instant kill is any single challenge or\neffect that takes a character from his first Healthy health level to Mortally Wounded\nor Torpor. The Mind’s Eye Theatre rules are designed to be theatrical, not strictly\nrealistic, so emphasize story over combat.\nNOTICING\nOTICING\nOTICING\nOTICING\nOTICING P\n P\n P\n P\n POWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS I N\nI N\nI N\nI N\nI N E E E E EFFECT\nFFECT\nFFECT\nFFECT\nFFECT\nWhen a power is used unsuccessfully upon a character, that character can\ninitiate a Static Mental Challenge to detect its use.

If the original character wins the Static Challenge, he might\nalso recognize the power and/ or who used it on him (at Narrator discretion). Some\npowers are obvious in their effect, target, and/ or source. The Narrator may rule that\nany of the pertinent information is available without testing.\nNARRATING\nARRATING\nARRATING\nARRATING\nARRATING T H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E\nT H E M\n M\n M\n M\n MO B\nO B\nO B\nO B\nO B S S S S SCENE\nCENE\nCENE\nCENE\nCENE\nAny Narrator who has worked with a large group of players has probably noticed\nthe tendency for mob combats to develop into huge, time consuming affairs that can\nturn a fun game into a boring session of rock-paper-scissors. This outcome can be\navoided, but the Narrator should be the one who controls the situation and keeps\nthe scene on track. Players will usually diverge into out-of-character conversations\nand mill about waiting to find out what happens for as long as the Narrator allows.\nKeeping Things Moving\nThe faster the characters move with speed-enhancing powers, the slower the\nplayers move in reality. One of the most important goals to strive for when running\na mass combat is to keep things moving so that players can get through with the scene\nwhile still maintaining their focus on the game. When combats drag out, the spirit\nof the scene can easily be lost in a sea of hand signals.\nWith that goal in mind, the Narrator must take two more things into consider-\nation before employing any of the following techniques. The first thing to consider\nis whether the results of this scene are likely to cause such harm to one of the\n\n\n73\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\ncharacters that you ought to follow each and every rule just to be fair. The second\nquestion is whether the players involved are going to enjoy a quick, narrative scene,\nor if they’d prefer a drawn-out, by-the-book scene. If you’re not sure, it’s okay to ask\nthe players directly. A good rule of thumb is that if any real out-of-character tension\narises between the players over the scene, you should likely just stick to a by-the-book\nstyle and leave the more diplomatic negotiation-oriented styles for later.\nPlaying It Conservatively\nIf you have determined that the players really want a more structured approach\nto the mob scene, this can be effectively accomplished if you stay focused throughout\nthe scene. The Storyteller needs to keep things moving at a reasonable pace\nthroughout the scene and not lose the players’ attention. It’s very easy in these\nsituations to let the focus drift away from the scene at hand or to become bogged\ndown in the minutiae of details that pertain to only a single challenge or retest.\nWhen playing the scene using the straight-and-narrow approach, taking some basic\nsteps will help keep things moving in the proper direction.\nTime spent arguing about the rules is time lost. Through the course of any long\nmob combat, the Storyteller will have to make several rules calls. Don’t worry about\npleasing everyone, but focus instead on making the fairest call possible, given the\ninformation you have. If a player wants to object after you make a call, let him. A single\nobjection is sometimes quite helpful, because the players may notice things that you\nmissed. However, if you still feel after hearing the objection that you made right call,\nsimply stick to the original call and move on. If the players still want to argue, tell them\nto abide by the decision for the time being and to bring it up after the game for further\ndebate if they would like. This approach allows the players to voice their concerns, but\nit also lets them know that no one is going to receive preferential treatment.\nIf the scene is in a public or high-traffic area, passersby will to want to get\ninvolved. You can handle this eventuality in a number of ways, but it has to be\naddressed, because the inclusion of new participants on any side of a fight can alter\nthe outcome dramatically. At the very beginning of the scene, establish who is in the\nscene, then limit any outside inclusion strictly. You can either move the whole group\nto a secluded area outside the general area, or simply record who is involved at the\nbeginning with a snapshot of the scene or a written list of participants. However you\nrecord it, the scene should be considered closed until the mob combat is over.\nOnce the scene begins, it is recommended that you keep tight control on the\nflow of the combat. Everyone should progress through the turns and Celerity/ Rage\nactions at the same pace, with no one moving farther ahead of the group in time or\nlagging behind. At the beginning of each turn, simply call for everyone’s stated\nactions, then break the situation down into its smallest component parts. Work on\neach of these components until everything is resolved, then start over for the next\nturn. As long as you keep things moving at a steady pace and you strive to incorporate\neveryone’s goals, the scene should play out without much difficulty.\nThe Narrative Approach\nIf the players are amenable to a more cooperative approach, then it might be\neasier to take a more freeform style to completing the scene. In this style, the players\nagree that the exact rules are not as important as the final outcome, and they agree\nto some give and take. Obviously, this approach doesn’t work as well if everyone’s\ngoals are to kill their enemies mercilessly, but sometimes it can be very rewarding.\nFirst off, the Narrator is responsible for making sure that things move forward\nat a reasonable pace and that everyone is focused on completing the scene as\nsmoothly as possible. The Narrator needs to remember that even in using this style,\n\n\n74\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nhe is the final authority on how things proceed, and he should keep a close eye on\nthe negotiations to make sure that everyone is treated fairly.\nFor this scene to proceed, everyone participating needs to divulge what they\nwant out of the scene. Frequently, the answers to this simple question can provide\nhints to the solution. If multiple or conflicting goals come up, it can be a good second\nstep to go back through the group after the first question and ask about each player’s\nlimits. In other words, the Narrator establishes each player’s best and worst\nconclusion to the scenario and then sets about trying to negotiate a way to satisfy as\nmany players as possible without letting anyone’s worst-case scenario come up.\nIf any diametrically opposed goals arise, then it is suggested that the Narrator find a\nway to meet (as much as possible) both goals without denying either outright. For instance,\na neonate has gravely insulted his elder, and the elder is attempting to kill the young upstart.\nThe neonate’s goal might be to simply get away, while the elder’s goal might be to kill the\nneonate. The Narrator can easily suggest that the elder mitigate his goal down to putting\nthe neonate into torpor and sending him to his clan’s elders. The neonate may accede to\ncapture if it doesn’t result in his death. Therefore, both parties could have what they want,\nwhile the path to get there may be different than either expected.\nIf the Narrator fails to reach an equitable solution between the groups, it is\nrecommended that the entire party default back to the conservative approach of\nplaying out every challenge as best as possible. The desired end of the narrative\napproach is to keep the story moving as long as possible and to give each party just\nenough closure to move on from this chapter without unnecessary problems. The\ngoal of the conservative approach, on the other hand, is to play out a single gambit\nin the larger story to the bitter end. Neither approach is intrinsically any better than\nthe other, but both have their place in the Narrator’s arsenal.\nA Cinematic Approach\nA compromise between the conservative and narrative styles is a more cinematic\nblend, which still attempts to pay close attention to the structure of the mob combat while\nmaking each turn as narrative as possible. Like the straight narrative style, this approach\nworks best if the combatants are not all absolutely set on killing each other as the only\noutcome. In this format, start as before by inquiring what everyone’s goals and limits are.\nThese answers should inform the individual turns as the scene moves forward. Then at each\nturn, inquire again what everyone wants to do. If some goals can be met without problems,\nsimply narrate what happens instead of worrying about the challenges for everything.\nDealing with the Innocent Bystanders\nIn most mob combat situations, you will have a collection of onlookers who are\neither there watching the scene in character and they chose not to get involved in\nthe chaos, or they have an out-of-character interest, and they are watching to see\nhow their friends do in the melee. Either case is usually fine, as long as the Narrator\nmakes it clear who is purely a spectator and who’s a participant. Regardless of the\nmethod he uses, the diligent Narrator will likely want to keep these onlookers at least\ninformed as to what is happening in the scene so that everyone gets the most out of\nit. The easiest way to do so is to call out what happens during each turn. Doing so\nserves two purposes, since it not only informs and entertains the audience, but it also\nwill cue the participants that they have to decide what their next actions will entail.\nThroughout the battle, it’s always good to keep track of roughly how much time\nhas passed in game, as well. Obviously this tally will never be exact, and it will never\nsync up with the real time that has passed, but it’s important nonetheless. When\nlarge combats break out, the local authorities tend to want to get involved to stop\n\n\n75\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nthings and restore order. It’s important to track how much time has passed inside the\nscene so that the Narrator can understand when to allow outside agents to start\naffecting things. Since most turns do not take longer than about four seconds, it’s\nusually not feasible to allow outsiders into the combat until it is already over.\nAnother factor to watch for is the passerby. Players always just happen to be walking\nby, and they will typically want to either watch what’s going on or join in. Just like the\nauthorities, you don’t want the random passerby joining in either, since it’s unlikely that\nthey would actually be able to get into the situation by pure chance unless they come by\nduring the very first turn. After that first turn, it is advisable that the Narrator not allow\nanyone new to enter the combat who was not forewarned about it. If you notice that\nseveral people are preparing to walk back to the rest of the game, simply inform them that\nif they leave the area before the scene is over, they should refrain from making any\nannouncements or warnings to other players based on this situation. Frankly, it is not\nrealistic to have the general bystander walk leisurely by the site of a fracas, watch for a\nmoment, go tell other people about it, then come back with reinforcements or just more\nonlookers. Doing so would take several minutes at the least, and the whole combat could\nbe over in that much game time. Therefore you have the time-bubble effect, which\nusually traps people within its influence until the scene is done unless the bystander is\nwilling to walk away and pretend he really did not see any of the events taking place.\nOften, you will find that players are quite happy to accept that condition if it means that\nthey do not have to wait out of character for an hour while the mob combat runs its course.\nVAMPIRE\nAMPIRE\nAMPIRE\nAMPIRE\nAMPIRE S S S S SETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING\nETTING S S S S SYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nYSTEMS\nTEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING D\n D\n D\n D\n DISCIPLINES\nISCIPLINES\nISCIPLINES\nISCIPLINES\nISCIPLINES\nIn large games, actual players’ characters often take the place of mentors and teachers\nfor other characters.

For example, a vampire who possesses an\nIntermediate level of his clan Disciplines may teach the Basic levels. With the exception\nof those who are portraying characters’ mentors, Narrator may not teach Disciplines.\nTo teach Advanced Necromancy or Thaumaturgy, the teacher must be a sixth- or\nseventh-generation vampire, and he must have the Advanced level in at least two paths\nof the Discipline.

This follow-up challenge may not be followed\nby additional extra attacks. If an opponent is using follow-up attacks (i.e., Celerity,\nRage or similar powers), Rage may be spent to participate in these challenges as normal.\nRISKING\nISKING\nISKING\nISKING\nISKING T\n T T\n T TRAITS\nRAITS\nRAITS\nRAITS\nRAITS: R\n: R\n: R\n: R\n: RA G E\nA G E\nA G E\nA G E\nA G E A N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D\nA N D G\n G G\n G GNOSIS\nNOSIS\nNOSIS\nNOSIS\nNOSIS\nRisking a Rage or Gnosis Trait for such things as extra actions or fetish\nactivation counts as an expenditure for the purpose of limiting Rage and Gnosis\nspent in the same challenge.\n\n\n76\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nSILVER\nILVER\nILVER\nILVER\nILVER\nCarrying silver reduces the size of a Garou’s Gnosis Trait pool by at least one per item.\nTen silver bullets counts as one object.

These penalties last for a full day after the Garou stops carrying the object(s).\nHARANO\nARANO\nARANO\nARANO\nARANO\nHarano is an inexplicable gloom and inexpressible longing for unnamable\nthings. Some say it is caused by contemplation of Gaia’s suffering. Garou who suffer\nfrom Harano are prone to depression, lassitude and sudden mood swings. They may\nnot act at all, or they may explode into intense but ill-advised activity. One never\nknows. What is certain is that a Garou suffering from Harano is certainly not at his\nbest, and he may well be a liability to his pack, his sept and the fight to defend Gaia.\nIt is not common for a Garou to plunge into Harano, but it happens often enough\nto make it a concern. At the Narrator’s discretion, any werewolf who has suffered some\nsort of crushing defeat recently (failure of a plan, loss of a loved one, extended\nhumiliation) must make a Mental Challenge against 10 Traits. If he fails, he slips into\nHarano. Although this condition is not permanent, the gloom of Harano is hard to lift.\nA player whose character suffers from Harano must make a Willpower Test against\nseven Traits each scene. If he fails, the Garou plunges into either of the following:\nFanatical, Desperate Activity — The Garou must succeed on a Simple Test to\navoid acting immediately on any impulse that comes to mind. Furthermore, he is\ndown three Traits on all Mental and Social Challenges, and loses all ties.\nDeep Gloom and Depression — The Garou must succeed on a Simple Test to\nact at all. Otherwise he simply curls up and hopes the world goes away. In addition,\nhe is down three Traits on all Mental and Social Challenges, and loses all ties.\nThese effects last for the duration of a scene. A new test must be made at the\nbeginning of the next scene.\nFurthermore, the senses of any Garou in Harano are inevitably distorted by his\nintense inner torment; all Garou in Harano are down one additional Trait in any\nchallenges involving sight, smell or hearing.\nThose who suffer from Harano may have moments of lucidity after the expenditure\nof a Willpower Trait. This expenditure lifts the gloom for as many hours as a character\nhas permanent Willpower. Harano is not necessarily permanent. Extraordinary Garou\nmay free themselves from its grip after exceptional travails (at Storyteller discretion).\nGiven the crippling effects of this condition, only extreme circumstances\nshould sink a player’s character into Harano.\nTEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING\nEACHING G\n G G\n G GIFTS\nIFTS\nIFTS\nIFTS\nIFTS\nAll spirit teachers of Gifts must be approved by the Storyteller.

Spirits will teach out-of-breed/auspice Gifts if the\ncharacter has two Renown Traits not previously dedicated to the learning of another Gift.\nTribal Gifts are treasured secrets. Spirits will not teach tribal Gifts unless an\nathro or elder of that tribe (who is also a player’s character) authorizes it.\nFellow Garou Teaching Gifts\nAny time your character teaches or is taught a Gift from another werewolf\nwithout the approval of a spirit that could teach it, both teacher and student of the\nGift gain a Notoriety Trait.

Whether the place is old and spooky or actually haunted, wraiths in that\nplace find it easier to cross the Shroud or use Arcanoi. A circle of wraiths can create\na haunt by crossing the Shroud repeatedly and using their Arcanoi to suspend the\ndisbelief of the Quick (usually by scaring them), but doing so takes many years. Most\nhaunts are either found by a lucky few, taken over by an ambitious circle or given to\na wraith by one of the factions.\nX\nYou’re homeless, and you have only your Fetters for refuge\n1\nIt’s so small you have to sleep standing up\n2\nIt’s not too fancy, but at least you have room to move around (A small studio)\n3\nYou finally have room for some guests (An apartment or a tiny house)\n4\nYou’re either living in luxury (or as close to it as you can get in the\nShadowlands), or you have an unusual or fortified haunt (A large house or\nmobile home)\n5\nYour haunt’s in Deader Homes and Gardens (A mansion)\nEach level of Haunt lowers the Shroud rating in the area by one. For example, if\nthe Shroud rating would normally be eight, a second-level haunt would lower it to six.\nWhile performing Arcanoi in the haunt, a wraith gets one free retest per Haunt rating.\nThese retests can only be performed once per session. While anyone may receive the\nbenefits of the lowered Shroud rating, the retests can only be used by the haunt’s owner.\nA circle of wraiths can share the benefits of a haunt, but each wraith must put\nin enough Background Traits to make the Haunt rating equal to three or higher.\nThey must also provide ample background justification for it. While anyone in the\nhaunt can share the lowered Shroud rating, only those who put background points\ninto it can share the free retests for Arcanoi. In this case, the number of retests for\nArcanoi for any particular character is the number of Background Traits that that\ncharacter invested, plus one. If a player’s character donated Background Traits to\nHaunt, and that character is destroyed or otherwise is put out of the game, then the\nHaunt rating is made of the Background Traits of the remaining characters. If the\nnew Haunt rating or number of remaining circle members is less than three, then the\ncircle will not receive free retests for Arcanoi until the situation is remedied.\nLegacy\nPeople dedicate their lives to leaving something behind to mark their existence\nafter they’re dead and gone. A legacy is not the memories that people have about a\nwraith or things that represent their ties to the Skinlands, but rather it is a measure\nof the accomplishments that they have left behind. A wraith’s legacy can be just\nabout anything such as a work of art, a term of slang or a scientific formula.\nX\nYou left nothing behind that marks your existence\n1\nSomebody printed a poem that you wrote in an obscure journal\n\n\n78\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\n2\nYour paintings still hang in an art gallery\n3\nYou helped found a charity\n4\nYou drafted important laws during your tenure at public office\n5\nYou started the disco craze\nOnce per story, a wraith can travel to the site of her legacy (or some\nrepresentation of it) and engage in a Simple Test for each level of the Legacy. Each\nsuccess heals a normal wound instantly, or an aggravated wound (with an additional\nhalf an hour spent at the legacy site). For example, a wraith with a Legacy rating of\ntwo makes two Simple Tests, but wins only one. In this case, the wraith can only heal\none wound in that one sitting at his legacy.\nA wraith can only use a legacy for himself; he can’t use the legacy to heal others.\nWraiths cannot combine Legacy Traits as they can those for the Haunt Background.\nRelics\nRelics are the ghosts of items that somehow crossed over to the Shadowlands\nafter being destroyed, or items that were so loved by their owners that they crossed\nover after their owners died. Unlike Artifacts, Relics have no special powers, they’re\njust useful in and of themselves.\nX\nYou’re broke\n1\nSomething functionally useless but important nonetheless (A wedding ring)\n2\nSomething you might trade or find some use for (A pair of sunglasses)\n3\nSomething useful, but simple (A knife)\n4\nSomething with moving parts (A gun)\n5\nSomething powerful or really useful (A car)\nIt takes a Pathos Trait to power complex relics (or relics with moving parts) for\na scene. It should be noted that some relics need more than Pathos to work. (For\nexample, relic guns need relic bullets.)\nATTUNEMENT\nTTUNEMENT\nTTUNEMENT\nTTUNEMENT\nTTUNEMENT\nPlayers’ characters should know automatically when a wraith is making them\ninto a Consort. There is no challenge to detect this activity, and they can feel it each\ntime the wraith expends a Willpower Trait for attunement.\nAttunement benefits only apply to the wraith who successfully manifested, skinrode\n(or otherwise hid in the Consort), and spent the Willpower for attunement. Therefore, if\na wraith attunes a mortal to itself, then only that wraith receives the benefits of attunement,\nunless other wraiths spend the time and energy to attune the mortal as well. The process\nof attunement takes time. Each successful manifestation and Willpower spent for attunement\nmust occur on different occasions, and they can occur no more than once per night. A\nConsort can be attuned to more than one wraith at a time at Storyteller discretion. If a\nwraith wishes to attune someone else’s Consort to itself, then the wraith must make a greater\nnumber of manifestation attempts and spend a greater amount of Willpower to do so. A\nStoryteller determines the specific number of attempts and the Willpower cost.\nMortals with True Faith cannot become Consorts. Wraiths tend to find the\npresence of such people uncomfortable to say the least. An exorcism on a Consort\nby a character with True Faith will remove the effects of being a Consort.\nEXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE T\n T T\n T TRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT E E E E EXPENDITURES\nXPENDITURES\nXPENDITURES\nXPENDITURES\nXPENDITURES\nInnate Abilities of an Arcanos cost two Experience Traits.

While in possession of such\nobjects, a changeling is one Trait down on all challenges, and her maximum\nGlamour decreases by one Trait. Weapons forged of cold iron inflict aggravated\ndamage on changelings and give them one Trait of temporary Banality.\nBeing manacled in cold iron prevents a changeling from casting any Cantrips or\nemploying Birthrights. In addition, the manacles will burn the changeling’s wrists over\ntime. Other effects of the burning manacles are up to the Storyteller’s discretion.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E E E E E ENCHANTED\nNCHANTED\nNCHANTED\nNCHANTED\nNCHANTED S S S S STROKE\nTROKE\nTROKE\nTROKE\nTROKE\nThe Physical Challenge for the Enchanted Stroke is always considered to be a\nsurprise challenge (which incurs the concomitant penalties).\nENCHANTMENT\nNCHANTMENT\nNCHANTMENT\nNCHANTMENT\nNCHANTMENT\nGenerally, most enchantments last one day per Trait of Glamour that the\ncharacter spends if the character is not within a freehold.

If the freehold is destroyed, the owner gains as many\ntemporary Traits of Banality as the level of the freehold.\nA freehold may be taken at the previous owner’s death, or the owner can give\nit away. A noble with a pennon (Count or higher) can take a freehold from\nsomeone with a lesser title by demanding a fior. If the person refuses the fior, the\nfreehold mystically transfers to the noble. The sidhe reclaimed many freeholds in\nthis way upon returning to Earth.\nIf a freehold owner becomes Undone, the freehold drops one level per year, and\nthe balefire gains a bluish light. It will dry up until the owner awakes or someone else\nclaims the freehold. Seelie typically believe that if the previous owner returns, the\nfreehold should go back to them, whereas Unseelie believe that the previous owner\nwas weak and has lost any claim to the freehold.\nGaining Glamour\nIf no one is using the freehold’s balefire to heal, one person per evening may gain an\namount of temporary Glamour Traits from the balefire equal to the level of the freehold.\nREAVING\nEAVING\nEAVING\nEAVING\nEAVING\nReaving is the act of sucking extra Glamour from a freehold. Anyone may do\nso, but it is considered a terrible crime. A Simple Test must be won in the presence\nof the balefire, giving the Reaver a point of temporary Glamour for every three points\nof permanent Banality she has. On a tie, the character gains one point of temporary\nGlamour for every two points of permanent Banality she has, and the freehold drops\none level permanently. On a loss, nothing happens. The owner of the freehold will\nimmediately become aware of the Reaving unless the Storyteller deems that he is too\nfar away or insufficiently in tune with his freehold.\n\n\n80\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nCHIMERA\nHIMERA\nHIMERA\nHIMERA\nHIMERA\nThe four basic types of Chimera include Incidental Chimera, Dreamed Chi-\nmera, Crafted Chimera and Forged Chimera. Incidental Chimera are the most\ncommon type found in the Enchanted World. They are stray dreams that have\npopped up here and there, and they are almost always tied to a specific place or\nperson. While these Chimera may seem solid in their proper setting, they are actually\nvery frail, and they will crumble if removed. Most sentient Chimera in the real world\nare Incidental Chimera.\nDreamed Chimera are the type that are found most commonly in the\nDreaming. They are those that are most generally turned into Crafted Chimera.\nWhile these Chimera are much sturdier than Incidental ones, they are still likely\nto dissolve if they are not crafted or forged properly. Sentient Chimera in the\nDreaming are usually this type of Chimera. Chimera or companions created with\nDream Weaving are of this type.\nCrafted chimerical items are the kind that most Kithain are familiar with.\nThese Crafted Chimera are items such as leather, wood or metal that have been made\ninto something. Generally, Chimera cannot be crafted into items more complicated\nthan a simple mechanical device. Crafted Chimera are still as vulnerable to Banality\nas Dreamed Chimera are.\nForged Chimera are the rarest type because generally only nockers can make\nthem. Forged Chimera have been altered on the most fundamental level. Forged\nChimera have an amazing resilience against Banality, and they are not connected\nto a certain person or place like most other Chimera are. Through their Arts, nockers\ncan create a wide variety of forged mechanical monstrosities.\nCreating Chimera\nIncidental Chimera may be changed into Crafted Chimera as per the rules in\nThe Shining Host with the following changes. After all the Glamour has been spent,\na point of Willpower must be spent as well. A Simple Test must then be won allowing\nthe Chimera to last until it comes in contact with high levels of Banality (7+ Traits).\nThese Chimera may still erode over time, and they may need to be infused with\nadditional Glamour each session at the Storyteller’s discretion.\nDreamed Chimera may be changed into Crafted Chimera as per the rules in\nThe Shining Host. These Chimera are much sturdier than Incidental Chimera, but\nthey still may fade if they come into contact with high levels of Banality (9+ Traits).\nThis is up to the Storyteller who may call for a Challenge or Simple Test as desired.\nChimera Creation Time\nThe Storyteller has final say on how much time is required to create Chimera\nand companions, but it generally ranges from six hours to one year (depending on\nthe Background level simulated).\nTreasure Creation\nTreasures are not Chimera, and they are not created like standard Chimera\nor companions. The creation of a treasure is an epic undertaking, one that should\nrequire an appropriate quest of some sort. There are no raw mechanics for making\ntreasures. Their creation should be a story in itself, and the Storyteller should\ndetermine when (and if) the proper moment of completion has come. Treasures\nare granted powers by the supervising Storyteller with approval restrictions\nequivalent to the Treasures Background. Characters who quest for a treasure must\npay an amount in Experience Traits equivalent to the rating of the treasure before\nbeing able to harness its magic.\n\n\n81\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nOATHS\nATHS\nATHS\nATHS\nATHS\nTaking an Oath multiple times does not grant cumulative effects.\nOath of Adoption\nSidhe who change Houses do not change their original House Boon or Flaw, nor\ndo they gain the Boon or Flaw of their new House.\nOath of Clasped Hands\nThe benefit of this Oath may be gained only once.\nOath of Fealty\nA character can be under only one Oath of Fealty at a time. To swear another\nOath of Fealty is to break the first.\nOath of the Long Road\nA character may swear have only one Oath of the Long Road at a time, and he\nmay gain the benefit of the permanent Willpower and Glamour only once. Use of\nthis oath on a trivial quest results in consequences as dire as if the Oath were broken.\nWEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND A A A A ARMOR\nRMOR\nRMOR\nRMOR\nRMOR\nThis section expands the weapon lists from the different Mind’s Eye\nTheatre sourcebooks and introduces some new rules that help simplify combat\nsituations in large games.\nWEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nCONCEALABILITY\nONCEALABILITY\nONCEALABILITY\nONCEALABILITY\nONCEALABILITY\nEach weapon has a concealability rating. If the weapon is not concealable, or\nif you do not have the proper amount of clothing or cover to conceal it, you must\ndisplay that card at all times. You cannot, for example, pull a broadsword out of your\npocket. Instead, you must carry that card in hand at all times or, optionally, you could\npin the card to your shirt, indicating that the weapon is slung over your shoulder.\nSomeone with the Investigation Ability who wins a Mental Challenge may\nnotice when a character is carrying concealed weapons or items. Searching the\ncarrier physically reveals hidden weapons automatically without a test in most cases.\nAVAILABILITY\nVAILABILITY\nVAILABILITY\nVAILABILITY\nVAILABILITY\nSerious firearms and archaic melee weapons can take some time to locate. Obtaining\nfirearms also requires a permit, which involves undergoing background checks or waiting-\nperiods in some areas. A character can turn to more “colorful” channels in order to procure\nequipment, but shopping the black market often means shady dealings and vastly inflated\nprices. The Influence values listed under many weapons’ Availability indicate the level and\ntype of Influence required in order to procure the weapon through illicit channels.\nOtherwise, a character must have some level of the Finance Ability or money-raising\nInfluence to procure exotic melee weapons and nearly all firearms.\nOnce a character has a weapon, he can’t necessarily keep it forever. Too often,\ncharacters run about firing shotguns and large automatic weapons without facing the\nmassive police manhunts that such battles invariably provoke. Take care that\ncharacters with powerful weapons understand the equally powerful repercussions\nthat follow irresponsible use. These consequences not only preserve game balance,\nbut they enforce a sense of realism and keep the game from turning into an arms race.\nSPECIAL\nPECIAL\nPECIAL\nPECIAL\nPECIAL W\n W\n W\n W\n WEAPON\nEAPON\nEAPON\nEAPON\nEAPON C C C C CAPABILITIES\nAPABILITIES\nAPABILITIES\nAPABILITIES\nAPABILITIES\nSome weapons have special abilities that allow an attacker to inflict extra\ndamage, ignore certain types of protection or strike multiple opponents.\n\n\n82\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nArmor-Piercing\nSpecial rounds, which are generally Teflon-coated, are able to pierce armor\nwith ease. Although they do not inflict extra damage, armor-piercing rounds ignore\nany defenses from armor. Such rounds are typically tricky to acquire, though, and\nlegal inquiries often follow their use.\nDestroy Shield\nAlthough they are rare in this day and age, certain Inquisitors and anachronistic\nelder vampires still use shields. A weapon capable of destroying a shield penetrates\nit automatically and renders it useless after three successful blows, no matter what\nsize or strength the shield may be.\nFully Automatic\nA firearm with this ability is capable of emptying dozens of rounds into a single target\nat close range. By expending 10 bullets in a single attack, this weapon inflicts an extra health\nlevel of damage automatically due to the sheer volume of fire. Once the clip is empty, the\ncharacter must spend one action reloading the weapon before he may fire again.\nHigh-Caliber\nFirearms of particularly high caliber can cause crippling wounds with only a few\nshots. When a high-caliber bullet hits a target, the attacker should make a Simple\nTest immediately. A win or tie indicates that the target suffers an additional health\nlevel of damage from the shot.\nIncendiary\nBurning weapons cause aggravated wounds to just about anything. Some, such as flame\nthrowers or Molotov cocktails, burn the target with streams or explosions of fire, while others\nsuch as incendiary rounds (“hot loads”) burn the target with superheated ammunition.\nMass-Trauma\nCertain weapons are so powerful that they inflict massive damage on a target,\nliterally tearing away portions of flesh. Such weapons score an extra health level of\ndamage when they are used appropriately.\nSpeed\nIn close combat with someone whose weapon has a Negative Trait of Slow,\nClumsy or Heavy, you gain one additional bonus Trait, provided you have at least one\nlevel of the Melee Ability.\nSpray\nThe weapon can strike up to three closely grouped targets at once, as long as they\nare farther than five feet from the shooter. The shooter makes one test against all the\ntargets simultaneously. Each target who fails the test suffers the weapon’s damage, while\neach target who succeeds avoids the weapon’s damage. The shooter risks only the Traits\nrequired to test against each member of the group, and he loses only those Traits if any\nof the defenders wins the test. Submachine guns and assault rifles expend 10 rounds to\nspray, and the shooter cannot use this capability at the same time as Fully Automatic.\nStaking\nStaking weapons paralyze vampires when a successful blow penetrates one’s\nheart. The attacker must win or tie two successive Simple Tests in order to stake the\nvampire successfully.\nTwo-Hand Requirement\nCharacters must employ two-handed weapons with both hands regardless of\ntheir strength, meaning that they may not also make use of a shield or second\nweapon when doing so.\n\n\n83\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nMELEE\nELEE\nELEE\nELEE\nELEE W\n W\n W\n W\n WEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nAll melee weapons use the Melee Ability for retests.\nBroken Bottle\nBonus Traits: 1\nNegative Traits: Fragile, Short\nConcealability: Pocket\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any\nKnife/ Dagger\nBonus Traits: 2\nNegative Traits: Short\nConcealability: Pocket\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any\nClub/Stake\nBonus Traits: 2\nNegative Traits: Clumsy\nConcealability: Jacket\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any\nSpecial Ability: Staking (if wooden)\nMace/Small Axe\nBonus Traits: 2\nNegative Traits: Clumsy\nConcealability: Jacket\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any\nSpecial Ability: Destroy Shield\nShortsword\nBonus Traits: 2\nNegative Traits: Short\nConcealability: Jacket\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any\nSpecial Ability: Speed\nFencing Blades\nBonus Traits: 3\nNegative Traits: Fragile\nConcealability: Trenchcoat\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any.\nSpecial Ability: Speed\nSpear/Staff\nBonus Traits: 3\nNegative Traits: Heavy\n\n\n84\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nConcealability: NA\nDamage: Two health levels\nAvailability: Any\nSpecial Ability: Staking (if wooden), Two-Hand Requirement\nBroadsword\nBonus Traits: 3\nNegative Traits: Heavy\nConcealability: Trenchcoat\nDamage: Two health levels\nAvailability: Any\nLarge Axe\nBonus Traits: 3\nNegative Traits: Clumsy, Heavy\nConcealability: Trenchcoat\nDamage: Two health levels\nAvailability: Any\nSpecial Ability: Destroy Shield\nGreatsword/Polearm/Scythe\nBonus Traits: 4\nNegative Traits: Clumsy, Heavy\nConcealability: NA\nDamage: Two health levels\nAvailability: Any\nSpecial Ability: Two-Hand Requirement\nTHROWING\nHROWING\nHROWING\nHROWING\nHROWING W\n W\n W\n W\n WEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nThese weapons use the Throwing Ability for combat retests.\nThrown Rock\nBonus Traits: 0\nNegative Traits: Clumsy\nConcealability: Pocket\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any\nThrown Dagger, Knife or Shuriken\nBonus Traits: 1\nNegative Traits: Clumsy\nConcealability: Pocket\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any\nMolotov Cocktail\nBonus Traits: 2\nNegative Traits: Fragile\nConcealability: Jacket (until lit!)\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any\nSpecial Ability: Incendiary, Spray, Two-Hand Requirement\n\n\n85\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nGrenade\nBonus Traits: 2\nNegative Traits: Clumsy\nConcealability: Pocket\nDamage: Two health levels\nAvailability: Police 5, or Underworld 4\nSpecial Ability: Spray, Two-Hand Requirement\nThrown Small Axe\nBonus Traits: 2\nNegative Traits: Clumsy, Heavy\nConcealability: Jacket\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any\nThrown Spear\nBonus Traits: 3\nNegative Traits: Clumsy, Heavy\nConcealability: Jacket\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any\nSpecial Ability: Staking (if wooden)\nRANGED\nANGED\nANGED\nANGED\nANGED W\n W\n W\n W\n WEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nEAPONS\nThis category covers non-thrown projectile weapons other than firearms.\nThese weapons use the Archery Ability for retests in combat.\nCrossbow\nBonus Traits: 2\nNegative Traits: Heavy, Slow\nConcealability: NA\nDamage: Two health levels\nAvailability: Any\nRate: One\nSpecial Ability: Destroy Shield, Armor-piercing, Staking (if wooden), Two-\nHand Requirement\nShortbow\nBonus Traits: 2\nNegative Traits: Fragile\nConcealability: Trenchcoat\nDamage: One health level\nAvailability: Any\nRate: One\nSpecial Ability: Armor-piercing, Staking (if wooden), Two-Hand Requirement\nCompound Bow/Longbow\nBonus Traits: 3\nNegative Traits: Fragile, Heavy\nConcealability: NA\nDamage: Two health levels\n\n\n86\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nAvailability: Any\nRate: One\nSpecial Ability: Destroy Shield, Armor-piercing, Staking (if wooden), Two-\nHand Requirement\nFIREARMS\nIREARMS\nIREARMS\nIREARMS\nIREARMS\nFirearms, as would be expected, use the Firearms Ability for combat retests.\nUnless otherwise noted, Firearms have a clip or magazine capacity of 10 rounds.\nFirearms have an additional capacity called rate, which governs their interaction with\nCelerity and similar powers.

These health levels are lost before the character himself suffers any damage in\ncombat. Of course, armor does not soak all attacks. A suit of chain-mail does little good\nfor a character whose blood is being boiled by Thaumaturgy, for instance.\nDifferent types of armor can absorb different amounts of punishment before losing\ntheir effectiveness. It should be noted that armor that has lost all its health levels is not\nnecessarily completely destroyed. It is more likely that it has been temporarily rendered\nuseless instead. Of course, some attacks may destroy armor beyond repair. Fixing armor\nrequires the proper tools and a Static Physical Challenge with the Crafts Ability.\nArmor has two different traits for game purposes. Health levels indicate how\nmany levels of damage the armor can absorb before needing of repair. Negative Traits\nare the drawbacks a wearer gains for donning a particular type of armor.

For the sake of\ndramatization, the Storyteller may have explosives destroy large tracts of land, buses\nfull of helpless victims (Narrator-driven characters) and floors of skyscrapers if it\nadds to the story. For use among the characters of players, bombs should not be\navailable as offensive weapons.\nStorytellers should limit the availability of explosives to prevent them from\nbecoming commonplace. Attempting to use explosives without having the Demo-\nlition Ability should result in bad things for the foolish character. Lost limbs, hands\nand nasty scarring should all be consequences of handling explosives cavalierly.\nDURATION\nURATION\nURATION\nURATION\nURATION AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND S S S S SCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F P\n P P\n P\n POWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS\nMany of the powers and Backgrounds listed in MET sourcebooks provide a frame\nof time during which they are active or a set of circumstances after which the power\nends. In the course of any single evening’s game, these definitions are often enough to\ndefine the boundaries of the powers in use. However, when the scope of the game\nextends past a single night or location, things get more complicated. A small set of\nthese powers becomes truly problematic as the effects begin to extend beyond even the\njurisdiction of a single Storyteller. When dealing with these powers, it’s usually best to\ndefine the basics first and then expand the concepts from that starting point.\nOne of the important aspects of the Mind’s Eye Theatre rules is the idea of\nhusbanding resources. The system is built with this game of limited resources in mind. The\nplayers have a pool of Attributes that decreases continuously over the course of a session,\na Willpower rating which is used to invoke a large number of powers and is very difficult\nto refresh and a special Trait pool (be it Blood, Gnosis, Glamour or whatever) that takes\ntime and effort to replenish. Retaining these expendables correctly is a large part of the\ngame, so regulating the times over which they can be used effectively is a key tool in the\nStoryteller’s arsenal for enforcing the tension of a game. The last few hours of any long game\nweekend can be especially terrifying to the players if they haven’t been able to refresh some\nof those pools and the Storytellers are enforcing the duration limits in creative ways.\n\n\n91\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E S S S S SCENE\nCENE\nCENE\nCENE\nCENE\nWithin any live-action session, the possibility of having a coherent scene with\nan easily marked beginning and end is unlikely at best. Most sites have an open area\nthat ends up being the central gathering point, and the “scene” that takes place in\nthat room almost never actually ends. This approach is common enough that players\nhave grown to expect it as a focal point of activity in a game. As a consequence, the\nStorytellers are left redefining the scope of their game.\nIn a traditional tabletop session, a scene is marked by the change of location or a\nmajor shift in the action of the story. The demands of a live-action game alter this\nexpectation dramatically, as the number of participants rises. The Storytellers have less\nand less direct control over the indicators of scene. Therefore, it is best to set a standard\nthat everyone knows and can rely on. In the case of the scene, wherever there is a doubt\nabout how long something should last, the scene duration defaults to one hour or one\nscene, whichever is shorter. If characters get into such situations, we still want them to\nact within the confines of the scene, and not have the effects of powers spilling over into\nother scenes once the immediate need is over. For example, if the local anarchs make an\nattack on the prince of the city and the prince invokes Majesty and manages to escape,\nhe won’t have that Majesty still active when he walks into the Elysium later on to rally\nthe primogen. He’d have to invoke it again and pay its corresponding cost again.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E S S S S SESSION\nESSION\nESSION\nESSION\nESSION\nThe usual definition of a session includes the events of one night’s game,\nstarting at character check-in and ending with a wrap-up. Surprisingly, in a long-\nrunning game, even this value needs to be evaluated and either reinforced or tossed\naside. In any serial game, one in which the overall chronicle runs through multiple\ngame sessions, then the standard definition works well until the group decides to run\na full weekend-long event with multiple evenings worth of play. The plots and stories\ndesigned for such games almost always take the multiple nights into consideration,\nbut the rules still just say “session.”\nThere are several ways to handle this, and they can even be made to handle the\ntime between weekly or semi-weekly games as well. The largest issue is the\nreplenishment of Traits. The Storytellers need to decide the rates at which Traits are\nreplenished. For long-running games, the following is recommended:\nAttributes are replenished at the end of each evening. In a game in which things\nrun 24 hours a day and seven days a week, it is recommended that these Traits be\nreplenished only after the character sits out of play for the equivalent of a night’s\nsleep. At some conventions, this measure can be an effective prod to encourage the\nmore exuberant participants to get some much-needed sleep.\nWillpower replenishes one Trait per week on its own. A character can replenish\none additional Trait per week for satisfying the requirements of her Nature.\nAll special Traits (such as Blood or Gnosis) have character-driven replenishment\nmethods. These methods can even form the basis for stories all on their own. The more\norganized games find a lot of utility in the idea of an Influence and Feeding Center for\nexactly this purpose. When using such a central Storyteller base, a game typically\nestablishes a small area that’s considered out-of-play and always has at least one\nStoryteller on duty at all times. That on-call Storyteller is then responsible for running\nthe feeding challenges or Influence expenditures that happen during any game. In a\nLaws of the Wild game, this position is sometimes combined with the Spirit Keeper\npost. In an Oblivion chronicle, this Storyteller sometimes runs Harrowings.\n\n\n92\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nIn games lasting for a few days — usually in a convention style setting — the\nStorytellers need to decide how quickly the characters can recover Traits. The choice they\nmake can reinforce the themes and moods of the overall game. For instance, if one of your\nkey issues in an event is the scarcity of resources, then you will likely want to limit and slow\nthe rate of recovery. You may even wish to keep characters from recovering Attribute Traits\nuntil the entire event ends, thereby forcing the players to truly think about how they will\nspend Traits, and what challenges are worth their effort. To establish a more cinematic and\naction-oriented theme, you may wish to make Trait-replenishment happen much faster.\nWillpower, for instance, is a key Trait for using some vampiric Disciplines, so if it is\nreplenished in full every morning, you will encourage people to use it far more often.\nSessions have yet another connotation. In a chronicle composed of numerous gaming\ngroups running separate sessions in which players can travel freely between them, it becomes\nimportant to look at the possible frequency of sessions. Many powers and refresh rates are set\non a “per session” basis. For instance, a character overcomes Conditioning in six sessions minus\none session for each Willpower Trait spent. If one of the gaming groups of your chronicle runs\nonce a month and its neighbor runs every weekend, which time frame is the character\nsupposed to use? Inconsistency will leave the players feeling like there is an inherent bias\ntoward or against some of them, so you will want to set a standard that is not dependent upon\nthe actual sessions available, or on the frequency of the gaming groups gathering. Typically,\njust as a scene can default to one hour, a session can default to one month.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E S S S S STORY\nTORY\nTORY\nTORY\nTORY\nThe last, and largest, of the variable time durations used is the story. In its\noriginal context of a limited time frame game, or a serialized collection of stories, this\nlimit may work very well, but in the rolling field of a game that never stops (or which\nhas multiple Storytellers running multiple stories), it can be very vague. The story\nduration tends to be a long-term marker of time, and it is usually composed of several\nsessions. If the session equals roughly one month of time, then it is recommend that\na story be either three months or six months of real time. This measure of time may\nseem unusually long, but when discussing the long term items like gaining a new Path\nTrait or Virtue Trait, such a frame of time is not uncalled for.\nCROSSOVER\nROSSOVER\nROSSOVER\nROSSOVER\nROSSOVER P\n P P\n P\n POWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS\nOWERS\nFew creatures in the World of Darkness welcome the idea of dealing and\nmingling openly with other supernatural creatures. The denizens of the World of\nDarkness all have secrets that they struggle to keep hidden. Every kind of monster,\nafter all, has some prohibition against revealing its true nature to anyone who is not\nalready in the know. This secrecy is an important aspect of the world, and it helps\nthe Storyteller establish a sense of mystery and exploration. The world is much more\nfrightening when the characters don’t understand the fine points of werewolves and\nghosts. Times come, though, when the crossover game is exactly what you want.\nMost crossover games present a stylistic risk to the unprepared Storyteller. That\nrisk is that the crossover game, more so than any single setting on its own, tends to\ndevolve into one of three unfavorable scenarios. Note that there are generally\npositive versions of all three of these scenarios, but the following represents the most\nlikely end when things don’t go the way you planned.\nBIASED\nIASED\nIASED\nIASED\nIASED V V V V VIOLENCE\nIOLENCE\nIOLENCE\nIOLENCE\nIOLENCE\nOne side is attempting to assert its control and/ or dominance over the other.\nThis is the frequent end of Sabbat/ Camarilla and vampire/ werewolf crossovers, and\n\n\n93\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nit inevitably results in one side losing — with all the accompanying hard feelings.\nAn example of this pitfall would be a Shadow Lord walking into an Elysium,\noverbidding the prince’s Majesty and slaughtering him while a shocked court looks\non with no means of overcoming the beast’s frightful Icy Chill of Despair. As a plot\ndevice, it could be great, but when the Shadow Lord was supposed to be a cunning\ninfiltrator until the player decided to branch out… well, that can get messy.\nUNHEARD\nNHEARD\nNHEARD\nNHEARD\nNHEARD-O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F A A A A ALLIES\nLLIES\nLLIES\nLLIES\nLLIES\nThis pitfall occasionally is the result of vampire/ werewolf crossovers, but is just\nas prevalent in the werewolf/ changeling dynamic. It typically leads to the free\nexchange of lores and items that truly do not belong in the opposite setting, which\nwreaks havoc on a Storyteller’s ability to control the flow of information in the game\nand upsets the themes we strive to establish.\nNOISE\nOISE\nOISE\nOISE\nOISE\nThis is the typical result of wraith/ vampire crossovers, although it has been\nknown to characterize the results of almost any crossover combination. Typically\nthis pitfall occurs when an interaction fails to produce a definable result or add to the\nhost setting’s themes or plots. The interaction is reduced to background noise\nsubtracting from the inherent mood and ambiance of the host genre. For example,\nyour local game plays in a small bar and the wraith that you just approved for the\nsubtle shock and horror value is drowned out by the background noise of the club and\nmost of the other participants simply tune the intruder out.\nA successful crossover requires that the Storytellers pay special consideration to\nthe two most basic tools at their disposal: plot and mechanics. Loss of plot leads either\nto senseless violence and friction or to the lion and lamb lying down together. Loss of\nmechanics inevitably ends in making players angry when they feel that they’ve played\nat the expense of their character. While this can be said of almost any chronicle, it’s\nparticularly evident during the cross-genre event as creatures of vastly different aims\nand abilities attempt to get the better of each other. Despite all the pitfalls of such an\nendeavor, though, a successful crossover game can add immensely to the story. In any\ncrossover, you can limit the number of intruders into the host setting (such as a pack\nof werewolves coming into a Camarilla Elysium), make the game a free-for-all\ncrossover with relatively equal portions of two or more supernatural creature types.\nGENERAL\nENERAL\nENERAL\nENERAL\nENERAL R R R R RULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nWhen two powers conflict, the Storyteller or Narrator should first decide who\nis the more potent contestant. Compare the vampire’s Discipline level, werewolf’s\nRank, mage’s Sphere rating, wraith’s Arcanoi, or changeling’s Art level and\ndetermine the higher level. If any question of effectiveness arises, decide in the favor\nof the more potent contestant, as noted in the Power Interaction chart. Obviously\ndoing so is unnecessary in some cases (such as when a vampire tests damage down\nwith Fortitude), but it can save a lot of time in resisted efforts.\nThis approach will generally speed up the interactions and dispute resolutions\nimmensely, but it will have the side effect of favoring vampires, fae and wraiths, who\ncan buy up to Advanced powers without the accompanying hassle of buying up\nexpensive Arete Traits or Rank.\nAs an example, a vampire with Intermediate Obfuscate should be able to hide\nfrom the Rank One or Two werewolf with Heightened Senses without much difficulty.\nIf the Garou is of Rank Three or Four, they should test as normal. If the Garou is Rank\nFive, he would see through the vampire’s effect.\n\n\n94\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nMany of the individual notes here are of a cautionary nature. They give tools\nto the Storyteller in order to help control the flow of the story. The Storyteller should\nalways feel free to loosen any or all of these controls if the desired goal is a World of\nDarkness in which all the worlds’ denizens interact with regularity.\nVAMPIRES\nAMPIRES\nAMPIRES\nAMPIRES\nAMPIRES\nVampires are unchanging, immortal and mostly uncaring. In short, they are the\nphysical embodiments of a wraith’s Angst and a changeling’s Banality. They are\ncreatures of the Wyrm even if they have never heard of the Wyrm. Standing in a\nroomful of vampires should be remembered as a frightening brush with Death’s\nfavorite agents. Changelings should walk out of the room clutching their coats\ntightly against the cold, while the restless dead try desperately to remember what it\nwas they love without drowning in the oblivion these creatures exude. Garou caught\nmaking deals with vampires over a long period of time should expect to at least be\nchallenged on the “rightness” of such dark dealings. No one wants to deal with\nvampires, but they are the undisputed masters of the cities and the mortals. They do\nnot have as many of the innate tricks and advantages as the other types of\nsupernatural creatures do, but no one else blends in as well as the dead.\nFew vampire-specific rules present problems between vampires and other supernaturals.\nSimply keep the comparison chart in mind when dealing with opposed abilities.\nWEREWOLVES\nEREWOLVES\nEREWOLVES\nEREWOLVES\nEREWOLVES\nGarou cross over into other genres frequently as antagonists. Their holy war\nagainst the Wyrm gives them a reason to hunt almost any of the other denizens of\nthe World of Darkness.\nThe following is a short list of key issues:\nThe Gauntlet\nVampires tend to be rather static and unnatural creatures. In the Garou’s terms,\nthey are creatures of the Wyrm who are powered by the Weaver. As such, feel free\nto make the Gauntlet in areas that vampires frequent fairly high. An 8 would not be\nunreasonable for someplace such as Elysium. This limit alone will help cut down on\nthe tendency for Umbral incursions or strikes against vampires.\nFae, wraiths and mages all hold places of power, which are known as freeholds,\nhaunts and Chantries respectively. These places of power usually have lower\nGauntlet ratings except where a concerted effort has changed the Gauntlet. For\ninstance, a Technocracy lab is still going to have a Gauntlet rating of 9 or 10, but\nPOWER\nOWER\nOWER\nOWER\nOWER I I I I INTERACTION\nNTERACTION\nNTERACTION\nNTERACTION\nNTERACTION\nVampire\nWerewolf\nChangeling\nWraith\nMage\nN/A\nCub and Kinfolk\nN/A\nInnate\nN/A\nBasic\nRank One\nBasic Arts\nBasic\nBasic\nDiscipline\nand Two\nArcanoi\nSpheres\nIntermediate\nRank Three\nIntermediate Intermediate Intermediate\nDisciplines\nand Four\nArts\nArcanoi\nSpheres\nAdvanced\nRank Five\nAdvanced\nAdvanced\nAdvanced\nDisciplines\nArts\nArcanoi\nSpheres\nSuperior\nLegends\nN/A\nN/A\nN/A\nDisciplines\n\n\n95\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nthe Gauntlet rating in a Dreamspeaker’s sweatlodge may be as low as it is in a\npowerful caern.\nBanes and Vampires\nBanes love vampires. Vampires are innately unnatural, and their existence is\ndependent on inhumane and “evil” acts. They spawn feelings of pain and betrayal,\nand they bring out the worst in people. Any Garou attempting to approach vampires\nthrough the Umbra should expect to deal with several Banes as the spirits harvest\nthe ill will that surrounds vampires. After interacting with vampires, they may also\npick up a Bane that may plague them for days or weeks to come. Most Banes will not\nbother to affect vampires. They recognize the fact that they both are on the same\nside, even if the vampires don’t. Obviously, the larger the gathering of vampires is,\nthe more Banes will be attracted to the area. Therefore, a conclave of several\nhundred Cainites might bring together hundreds of hungry Banes in a weekend long\nfeeding frenzy, of which the vampires themselves remain blissfully ignorant. If you\nwant to encourage the interaction between vampires and werewolves, then reduce\nthe number to a more manageable level, but this is one of the few limiting factors on\nthe abuse of the Umbra against Cainites.\nWRAITH\nRAITH\nRAITH\nRAITH\nRAITH I I I I INTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nMixing wraiths and vampires is popular due to the similar themes expressed in\neach setting. Special care needs to be taken in such a crossover, though. Vampires\nhave almost no natural defenses from wraiths, and the wraiths have several Arcanoi\nthat allow them to affect and harm a physical creature directly. Werewolves and the\nfae are more evenly matched versus wraiths, although still not entirely so. When\njudging an interaction between wraiths and anything in the Skinlands, keep the\nfollowing things in mind at all times:\nThe Shroud\nThis rating defaults to an 8, and it must be beaten in a Static Mental Challenge at\nthe start of every scene in which the wraith is attempting to affect something on the other\nside. Using Embody to cross it physically will negate this challenge and allow the direct\nusage of all other Arcanoi. Crossing the Shroud thus also leaves the wraith open to such\nretaliations as Disciplines, Gifts and Physical Challenges. Note that particularly intense\nscenes may require testing against the Shroud for every turn at the Storyteller’s discretion,\ninstead of every scene. If you would like to make things easier to cross between vampires\nand wraiths, any gathering of vampires is bound to lower the Shroud slightly since a\ngathering of the undead tends to lend a creepy and gothic feel to any place.\nRight-Minded Wraiths Fear Angst\nAny collection of vampires is a veritable festival of Angst. A good technique\nto bring this point home: Have a wraith make a simple test every time he enters a\nscene with more vampires than his permanent Angst rating, in order to resist gaining\na temporary Angst. Spectres, of course, are immune to this aspect of the collected\npsychic baggage of a roomful of the dead, although they may attempt to harvest\nAngst as normal. Conversely, Spectres in the presence of several Garou or fae should\nlikely test for temporary Composure in the same manner as wraiths for Angst.\nLifesight Works Against Vampires.\nLifesight will function as Aura Perception for the purposes of information yielded.\nHowever, it is only an innate ability of wraiths, so any level of Obfuscate that the\nvampire possesses will defeat it. For instance, while this ability will not allow a vampire\nwith only Unseen Presence to mask his true feelings (Soul Mask is still needed for that),\nit will allow him to remain hidden when the wraith using Lifesight is looking for him.\n\n\n96\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nPresence (including Majesty) and Dominate Cannot Cross the Shroud.\nA wraith may act against a character with Majesty without testing. This also pertains\nto gifts such as Roll Over and Icy Chill of Despair, Arts such as Sovereign, and the mortal\narts of Fascination. The wraith must embody in order to be affected by these powers.\nObtenebration is a Manifestation of Oblivion.\nThe vampiric Discipline of Obtenebration can be treated as if it accessed Oblivion\ndirectly. Any wraith caught within the confines of an effect of Obtenebration should test\nfor a temporary Angst Trait as the Shadow siphons a small bit of Oblivion into itself.\nCHANGELING\nHANGELING\nHANGELING\nHANGELING\nHANGELING I I I I INTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nNTERACTIONS\nThe fae and vampires don’t interact much on widespread levels, although a few\nvery notable exceptions do occur. Mixing these two settings is a wonderful opportunity\nto highlight all the things that vampires have lost. The undead can generally be\nconsidered as walking manifestations of Banality and loss. The only exceptions to this\nguideline are the Malkavians who have both relatively low Banality levels and an\naffinity to the Dreaming. Therefore, they should not count against the total Banality\nof a room. The Kiasyd have an affinity for the Dreaming, but normal Banality for a\nVampire. Ravnos vampires have a low Banality, but no affinity to the Dreaming.\nGarou are more likely to interact with the fae, due to similarities of setting more than\nanything else. While Garou do not inherently exude Banality as vampires do, they are\nstill fearsome creatures with an extremely quick temper, and care should be taken in the\ninteractions of the two groups. These interactions should highlight the similarities\nbetween their struggles but make it clear that the struggles are not really compatible. A\ngood theme here is to play the differences of each race against the similarities.\nThe restless dead have little to do with the fae, or more precisely, the fae want\nlittle to do with them.\nThe Mists\nEveryone is subject to the Mists, with the sole exception of Malkavian vampires.\nBanality\nMost fae Arts are fairly fragile in that retests are almost unheard of, but they are also\nunfettered in what they can accomplish. Banality is one of the few natural defenses that all\nother creatures have against the fae Arts. Setting the Banality of the other creatures in the\nchronicle is a great way to help limit or control interactions of a magical nature. The average\nvampire, for example, has a Banality of approximately 8. However, if you would like the\ninteractions to be more difficult, feel free to raise the Banality to a 9 or even a 10.\nIndividual Powers\nAs far as powers go, several Arts can be rather heinous when used against\nanother creature type. Some examples are Elder-Form, Quicksilver and Flicker Flash.\nA Storyteller should never feel out of line for stating that it is not possible to convert\nthe angry Get of Fenris into a toad by kissing it on the nose with Elder-Form/Dire\nEnemy. Chicanery should be treated just like Obfuscate for purposes of testing against\nAuspex, and Thaumaturgical countermagic does work against fae Arts.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E F F F F FREE\nREE\nREE\nREE\nREE-FOR\nFOR\nFOR\nFOR\nFOR- A\n- A\n- A\n- A\n- AL L\nL L\nL L\nL L\nL L C C C C CROSSOVER\nROSSOVER\nROSSOVER\nROSSOVER\nROSSOVER\nAll of the preceding suggestions are primarily tips aimed at allowing the Storyteller\nto introduce controlled elements of another creature type into a host setting, such as\ninjecting a handful of Garou into a large vampire chronicle. It is entirely possible to\nsimply open the floodgates and allow all five main types of supernaturals into one\nchronicle setting, though, either by running all of the various creatures in separate but\nconnected games or by simply allowing all of them to mix at the same game. In a free-\n\n\n97\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nfor-all game, you will need to decide ahead of time how special abilities are handled and\nhow the many genres will interact. The setting-specific scores that affect others need to\nbe assigned — such as giving all characters a Banality score and assigning a base Banality,\nShroud and Gauntlet rating for each major game area of your site. Decide if you will be\nusing the Power Interaction chart for competing powers or if you will be simply allowing\neveryone to test. The first option speeds things up but puts more emphasis on the\nStoryteller to make sure that weaker creatures don’t get completely run over. The second\noption will likely seem more level, but it will result in far more challenges.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E M\n M\n M\n M\n MORTAL\nORTAL\nORTAL\nORTAL\nORTAL Q\n Q Q\n Q\n QUESTION\nUESTION\nUESTION\nUESTION\nUESTION\nWhile the other supernatural creatures all hunt and stab at each other, the\nmortals slide by unnoticed and try desperately to avoid being caught. A mortal in an\ninteraction with almost any other creature type will die in an outright fight. If he\nplays intelligently and carefully, he has a much better chance of surviving in the long\nrun. Mortals should represent the best agents for the dissemination of information\nbetween groups and one of the greatest security risks to each supernatural type. That\nis, after all, why there’s a Veil, a Masquerade, a Dictum Mortuum and a Right to\nIgnorance. Mortals risk their lives every time they enter even play with supernaturals,\nsimply because of what they are. It’s part of the thrill of being human.\nLORES\nORES\nORES\nORES\nORES\nLores gained on subjects outside the host setting should almost always be purchased\nwith Experience Traits. While they may be granted by the Storyteller, the willingness of\na player to spend an Experience Trait on the odd lore is a show that he truly is devoting\ntime and effort to learning this information. It will also help cut down on extremely high\nlores for characters outside of the setting. It is certainly not unreasonable to ask them to\nspend points on information to reflect a level of true understanding.\nEXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE T T T T TRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT S S S S STANDARDS\nTANDARDS\nTANDARDS\nTANDARDS\nTANDARDS\nIn any chronicle in which there are multiple Storytellers or multiple games\nrunning (not just multiple sessions), it is important to set a standard for Experience\nTrait awards. If one chronicle runs twice as often as a chronicle in a neighboring area,\ncharacters in the more commonly played chronicle will grow in power at twice the\nrate of their neighbors. To facilitate a balance of power in networks made up of\nmultiple chronicles, the Storytellers should set a maximum possible award per each\ngiven period of time. It is recommended that the number of Experience Traits one\ncan earn be capped with a per-month maximum. The exact number of Experience\nTraits one can earn per month should be based upon the desired learning curve.\nLEARNING\nEARNING\nEARNING\nEARNING\nEARNING C C C C CURVE\nURVE\nURVE\nURVE\nURVE\nA large chronicle’s learning curve is one of the more important aspects to consider\nbefore beginning.

Should certain things (such as high level Lores or Superior Disci-\nplines) be off-limits characters within the chronicle’s time span? When you have\nanswered these questions, you will be prepared to set the maximum for your monthly\nExperience Trait cap or devise a similar system to regulate the power of the characters.\nEXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE\nXPERIENCE T T T T TRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT\nRAIT B B B B BUILD\nUILD\nUILD\nUILD\nUILD U\n U U\n U\n UP\nIn long-running games, the issue of Experience Trait build-up arises.

Often though, this escalation creates an arms race\namong players as they build their characters to new heights in an attempt to keep up\nwith one another’s power levels. Experience Trait build-up leads to several problems.\nThe first and most important is that players lose track of the goal of the game, which\nis to have fun in a live-action setting, not to build stats on a piece of paper.\nAnother problem is that if a player’s character is killed after the player spent the\nlast two years investing Experience Traits into it, she can be disheartened by her\nreduced standing in the race. For similar reasons, players who have a lot of\nExperience Traits invested into their character will be reluctant to retire their\ncharacter in favor of exploring fresh new concepts.\nOne way to get around this problem is to allow a player to use a portion of the\nearned Experience Traits from her last character on her new character. It is\nrecommended that if you use this system, you set that amount at about 25 percent,\nand certainly no more than 50 percent. Giving too much back encourages players\nto make careless decisions with their characters, since they have little to lose if their\ncharacter is killed. Likewise, players may retire their characters too often, which\nkeeps a balance of power and politics from being developed in the game.\nFor chronicles that are intended to run in excess of several years, a more complex\nsystem may be required to address the problem. Varying your chronicle’s Experience Trait\ncaps as they apply to each character individually (based upon total Traits earned) may be\nthe answer. For example, if a starting character can earn a certain amount of Experience\nTraits in a month until the total reaches 50, and characters with over 50 Experience Traits\ncan earn only half that much, older characters still end up being more powerful. However,\nthe gap between old and new characters can be closed a bit. If the player of the new character\nearns the maximum amount each month, she will find that she is not as far behind the other\ncharacters as she would have been if everyone had the same cap.\nFor more finite control of this effect (with a touch more complexity), consider\napplying this graduated Experience Trait cap in several tiers, gradually reducing the\nmaximums for characters as they increase in power. This system allows you to better\ncontrol the learning curve in your chronicle and extend its lifetime. Each month, the\nplayer checks her total earned Experience Traits and compares it to your graduated\nchart to find out what her maximum will be for that month. If you give extra\nExperience Traits at character creation to some characters, do not consider these\nTraits when calculating “earned” Experience for these purposes.\nAUTOMATIC\nUTOMATIC\nUTOMATIC\nUTOMATIC\nUTOMATIC A A A A AWARDS\nWARDS\nWARDS\nWARDS\nWARDS\nSometimes the Storyteller may wish to exercise even more control over the\ncharacters’ growth in a chronicle. In this case, it might simply be better to award\nExperience Traits based on the desired rate of increase, rather than the standard\nmethod. In chronicles that run with large periods of time between sessions (such as\nan annual event), the Storyteller may wish to award Experience Traits in a similar\nmanner rather than relying on the standard method.\nCHANGING\nHANGING\nHANGING\nHANGING\nHANGING THE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE\nTHE R R R R RULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nThe World of Darkness is a constantly expanding and changing work, and many\nplayers want to feel that they are in a chronicle that reflects the major changes in that world.\nThese changes are realized in two principle ways — through rules and through plot.\n\n\n99\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nThe rules evolve as the Storyteller system matures. New rules and creatures get\nadded in, and new powers are created. These new features are all additions to the\nbasics defined in the main rulebooks, which you can use or discard as your chronicle\nwarrants. The core mechanics of the systems stay relatively stable, while much of the\nadditional material is quite easily updateable and changeable.\nThe Storyteller is responsible for establishing the system for converting new\nmaterial into the chronicle in a fair and consistent manner. The goal of any\nconversion is to make new material available to the players without upsetting the\nbalance of your existing game world. Where possible, it’s beneficial to try and\nincorporate anything new with story lines that will explain the additions while\nadding an element of mystery and surprise to the chronicle.\nAdhering to the White Wolf metaplot is usually the best way to incorporate new\nmaterial if your game stays true to the published materials. Most of the published plot\npoints are far enough removed from the everyday activities of the characters to be run\nas background elements which the characters can then investigate if they chose but\nwhich still impact on the characters’ existence if they choose to ignore them. The\nlarge-scale chronicle has to look at these points carefully since the events usually\nassume that most of the world is composed of Storyteller characters, which is not\nMODERATELY\nODERATELY\nODERATELY\nODERATELY\nODERATELY L L L L LO N G\nO N G\nO N G\nO N G\nO N G C C C C CHRONICLE\nHRONICLE\nHRONICLE\nHRONICLE\nHRONICLE\nHere is an example of the graduated Experience Trait caps in use.

Therefore, it is sometimes useful to break the\nchanges down into changes that are justification for rules additions and changes that\nare purely setting additions. Rules addition changes should be implemented if the\nchronicle is going to use the new rule, while setting additions need to be evaluated on\nthe basis of the chronicle’s commitment to stay true to the White Wolf story line.\nAn example of a change implemented for the purpose of making a rules addition\nis the advent of the plague which afflicted the Malkavian clan and left the clan with\nDementation instead of Dominate. Clearly, this event is something that you can run\nin your chronicle to explain the change. It can have a positive impact on the stories\nof every Malkavian in your chronicle and give them the reasoning to transition over\nto Dementation.\nThe destruction of the Ravnos Antediluvian, on the other hand, does not\nexplain any changes in the rules since it is a more purely story-driven plot point. It\nis a part of White Wolf’s published story line, and can be easily implemented through\nthe Time of Thin Blood sourcebook. However, if you aren’t following the official\nstory line, there’s little express need to run the story in that book, except that it would\nbe fun for the players involved.\nIMPLEMENTING\nMPLEMENTING\nMPLEMENTING\nMPLEMENTING\nMPLEMENTING N\n N\n N\n N\n NE W\nE W\nE W\nE W\nE W R R R R RULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nULES R R R R RELEASES\nELEASES\nELEASES\nELEASES\nELEASES\nNew releases are part and parcel of the gaming experience. Players will\nconstantly ask if they can use the latest gadget or ability that was published in a new\nsupplement. Being prepared for this situation is essential to any long-time Story-\nteller. As long as the Storyteller understands how the new rules fit into the chronicle,\nand he sticks to a plan to implement them, there is no reason for such things to be\nunduly painful to a game. Your game can implement new materials as soon as they\nare available, which becomes less about Storytellers implementing changes accord-\ning to plots run in the chronicle, and more about when your players can purchase the\nnew books. You can also schedule points in the game when new rules will generally\nbe implemented. Scheduling regular intervals for updates will make anticipating\nthose updates easier for the players and minimize the negative impact of not having\na direct control over the game’s growth in this area, but it also can remove some of\nthe spontaneity of the constantly growing chronicle.\nWhen making changes to a chronicle, decide whether the change needs to be\nexplained in the world with a plot that alters things to accommodate the new rule,\nor if it simply needs to change and be done. Major system changes and rules that are\nnot tied to the setting are best to simply drop into place on a set date and be done\nwith, since doing so forces the players to change and everyone has to deal with it\ntogether. Setting-related changes are best explained through a plot that the players\ncan experience for themselves.\nCONVERTING\nONVERTING\nONVERTING\nONVERTING\nONVERTING O\n O O\n O OL D\nL D\nL D\nL D\nL D O R\nO R\nO R\nO R\nO R O\n O O\n O OBSCURE\nBSCURE\nBSCURE\nBSCURE\nBSCURE R R R R RULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nULES\nWhile most of White Wolf’s core rules have been converted to MET — and\neven many of the more obscure rules have been brought over to MET by now — your\nplayers will always want to bring forward a few small rules to have them converted\nfor their characters. If you choose to allow this conversion, it is highly recommended\nthat you develop a small system for converting these tabletop rules to the MET. Our\nrecommendation would be to assign this duty to a specific Storyteller or team of\nStorytellers and let them do it for the entire chronicle. Relying on this team will help\nkeep consistency high, which helps keep the converted rules fair and balanced in\nrelation to other, more established rules.\n\n\n101\nNuts and Bolts\nNuts and Bolts\nWhen converting rules from the tabletop sources, try to keep to a few simple\ntips in mind:\nTry to stay as true as possible to the original idea. If you didn’t like what the rule\nor power was trying to accomplish, you wouldn’t be converting it. That sounds like\nan obvious point, but as you try to translate ideas from one system to another, it’s\nsometimes easy to warp the original intent of a rule beyond recognition.\nTry to maintain definable benefits and flaws in your conversions. It’s great to\nsay that a certain power makes the character more attractive when activated and\nthat people can’t resist their presence, but that benefit alone doesn’t really describe\nanything that can be enforced as a mechanic. It’s always better to include some form\nof mechanics that will add or subtract defined Traits and abilities. Stating that a\npower makes someone more attractive and adds the Social trait of Attractive and\ngives a free retest on Presence Challenges is much more helpful.\nTry to avoid powers that allow one character or character type to have a huge\nstatistical advantage. While it may seem great for a new discipline to have the ability\nto stake anyone without a test, the people who are victims of that power won’t likely\nbe having much fun. Try to always allow for a way to counter the power, or at least\nprovide a test so that some element of escape is available.\nDon’t make up completely new mechanics when existing ones will do. Part of\nthe danger of any new rule is that it won’t fit in well with the rules that are already\nin play, or that it will needlessly complicate matters. Be familiar with other published\nconversions and look for similar powers in supplements that can be modified slightly\nto arrive at the goal you want. Doing so can relieve you of the necessity of making\nup wholly new material, while assuring you that the new rule will fit in well with the\nestablished material.\nActivation costs such as Blood, Gnosis, Rage, Willpower and Glamour that\nmust be expended to initiate or fuel a power usually rely on a straight one-to-one\nconversion. For instance, all Thaumaturgy powers cost one blood point to activate\nin tabletop, and the same is true in the MET version.\nTabletop rules sometimes require a roll against a standard difficulty to activate\na power. Usually, this mechanic can be translated as an appropriate Static Test\nagainst a difficulty slightly higher than the tabletop version. For instance, if the\noriginal write up requires a Wits roll with a difficulty of 5, it is perhaps best translated\nas a Static Mental Challenge against six traits. If the tabletop power called for a Wits\nroll with a difficulty of 10, the translation should likely be against 12 to 15 Traits,\nwhich simulates more accurately the difficulty of rolling 10s.\nPowers that add successes to another roll or add dice to the roll should usually\nbe translated as a number of Traits added to the character’s total. It is unadvisable\nto add more than three or four Traits for any single power; a two-Trait addition is\nmore reasonable. Another way to translate these powers is to provide a retest in a\nfailed challenge rather than extra Traits.\nIt is almost always best to translate extended challenges as expending Traits. For\ninstance, if the original write-up requires a success for each degree of damage done\nor level of success in the power, it is advisable to have the translation require the\nexpenditure of the appropriate Traits to increase the damage done or level of success.\n\n\n102\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\n\n\n103\nPlots\nPlots\nHaving read the previous sections, you may be thinking, “Wow, large-scale\nMind’s Eye Theatre games sound like a whole lot of work!” It’s true that planning,\nsetting up and running large chronicles involves a great deal of time and effort.\nHowever, this effort gives rise to story and entertainment possibilities that are\ndifficult to come by in traditional MET games. For this reason, becoming a large or\nlong-running game is usually the goal of a starting chronicle.\nAs with any other activity that requires great effort, having a plan is helpful.\nWhat follows is an attempt to guide you in all aspects of the construction of your new\nand (hopefully) successful dark epic, as well as an overview of the more common\nquestions you’ll need to answer as the game goes on. The Mind’s Eye Theatre books\nthat have been published already (as well as the tabletop books that inspired them)\ncontain plenty of seeds for specific stories, so you won’t find a specific subsection of\nthem here. What this chapter does contain is advice on overcoming hurdles that\nstand in the way of creating long-lasting stories for a large group of people.\nSTANDARD\nTANDARD\nTANDARD\nTANDARD\nTANDARD E E E E ELEMENTS\nLEMENTS\nLEMENTS\nLEMENTS\nLEMENTS O F\nO F\nO F\nO F\nO F S S S S STORY\nTORY\nTORY\nTORY\nTORY\nEvery interesting story, no matter how complex or moving it is, is built in the same\nfundamental way. From the way you relate what happened to you over the weekend\nto the events in a high-tech spy novel to your average live-action roleplaying\nsequences, all stories demonstrate three standard elements. The first such element is\nthat of the character. Without a character, you don’t have a story. The second element\nis the goal. The character wants to reach that goal, and the story exists in order to show\nwhether the character achieves it or not. The final standard element of a story is the\nobstacle. Whether it takes the form of an army of invading heathens, a vicious storm\nin unfriendly territory or a debilitating shortcoming of the character’s own psyche, the\nobstacle in a story exists to keep the character from achieving his goal.\nUse these elements as you create plots in your live-action chronicle. Start by\nexamining your characters and thinking up a goal for them to strive for. Ask yourself\nwhat it is that your players’ characters want. Do they want peace in a highly\nCHAPTER FOUR:\nPLOTS\n\n\n104\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\ncontested piece of prime real estate? Do they want to overthrow a villainous\nauthority figure and establish a more egalitarian regime? Do they want to purge their\nranks of those characters who will not get with the program?\nOnce you find out what they want, provide some means of achieving those\ngoals. Have your Storyteller characters drop hints about certain current or upcoming\nopportunities that the characters will have for pursuing those goals. If the players’\ncharacters don’t bite right away, start to show them what will happen to the setting\n(or in their personal lives) if they do achieve the goals in question. Give them plenty\nof reasons to take action.\nOnce the characters are motivated, set up the obstacles. If the characters want\nto achieve these goals so badly, who else might be interested in pursuing said goals?\nWhen you’re setting up whatever the goal is, it’s a good idea to make it something\nthat both the protagonists and antagonists want.\nAfter you’ve set up the goal, gotten the characters motivated and engaged the\nobstacles in the characters’ path, your plot-creation work is all but finished. The rest\nof the plot-related work that goes into a chronicle is that of making sure that the\ncharacters remain on track until they have either achieved their goal or failed to do\nso. Once the outcome of the players’ characters struggle (or the story arc) ends, it’s\nup to you to set another goal up with which to tantalize the characters.\nIt’s awfully cavalier to make that kind of statement, though, and make the job\nin question sound so easy. The toughest part of being a Storyteller and dealing with\nplots in a large live-action game is that you have to perform the same process for\nmultiple stories of varying scope and complexity all at the same time in order to\nincorporate as many players as possible. Fundamentally, however, the task of\ncreating a story is just that simple, and the text of this chapter goes over some of the\nconsiderations that go into each step of story-creation. Once you get these basics\ndown, you should be just as ready to handle live-action plots in a dark epic chronicle\nas you would be in a standard-size chronicle. The hardest part is really the legwork.\nPLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nLOT C C C C CREATION\nREATION\nREATION\nREATION\nREATION AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND T T T T TIMING\nIMING\nIMING\nIMING\nIMING\nWhen considering a plot idea, remember to devote an amount of time to creating\nthe plot that’s proportional to the time you expect the plot to be active. If you want\na plot to run for months on into years, don’t think that you can scratch off an outline\nover lunch. A common mistake Storytellers of large games make is to create plots\nwithout fleshing them out. This mistake is usually revealed when an unforeseen action\non the part of the players causes the plot to unravel far earlier than the Storyteller would\nhave preferred. Trying to account for all the variables in the way a plot plays out\n(especially a plot that involves a large number of characters) takes a long time. To\navoid this problem, consider the following questions when constructing a plot:\nWhat is the time frame for this plot?\nDo you intend to make this idea a centerpiece of your chronicle, or will it be a\nshort diversion or follow up to previous character actions? Depending on your\nanswers, you’ll need to budget your time both in and out of game to do justice to the\nidea. There is nothing so annoying to a player as a plot that fizzles just as it’s getting\ninteresting or a fairly minor plot that drags on and on.\nIs this plot idea something that would appeal to the player base?\nYou may think that the immortal globe-trotting veteran of the Finnish War that\nyou’ve been fleshing out since your seventh-grade World History class is the neatest\ncharacter concept since Hamlet. You may think that his search for his family’s lost signet\n\n\n105\nPlots\nPlots\nring makes for the most heart-wrenching story since Schindler’s List. It is unlikely, however,\nthat your players will agree. Players are looking for substance in live-action stories, but that\nsubstance must be of interest to them. Never rely on ideas that are too obscure or too tedious\nto be of immediate interest to a majority cross-section of your players.\nCan I tie character backgrounds into the plot?\nFollowing up on the previous question, your players are much more likely to be\ninterested in a plot line that includes elements that affect their characters directly.\nTying your local underworld kingpin into a plot that has to do with a power play in\nthe arms-smuggling business via a long time friend (from his character history) is a\nmuch better idea than having a random source in the player’s downtime report\nrelaying news to him anonymously.\nWhat is the threat level of this plot?\nPlot can kill, but it does not have to kill. Should you arrive at the conclusion that\ncharacters can die in the course of your plot, you need to ensure that the story payoff will\nbe such that they will feel rewarded even if they do not come out alive. Having a character\ndie is painful, but knowing that his death was worth something lessens the blow\nsomewhat. Also, remember that not every antagonist should seek to kill a story’s\nprotagonist(s), even if a major difference of opinion on one or more issues separates them.\nCan I involve characters of various potencies in this story?\nGenerally speaking, your plots should be accessible to all levels of players, from\nthose who are new to your game to those who have been around from day one. Granted,\ncertain plot lines do not lend themselves easily to upholding that ideal. Plots that set\nthe characters against minor threats are imminently accessible to weak or inexperi-\nenced characters, but they are consequently uninteresting to more experienced ones.\nThe challenge of major threats may be perfect for higher-level characters, but they will\nvery likely destroy any low-level characters who have the gumption to tag along.\nWhen you create stories for groups of characters of various strengths, try to\nseparate the characters’ identifiable goals into sub-goals of equal importance but\nvarying difficulty. Doing so can be as simple as making sure that antagonists in a mob-\ncombat scene attack protagonist characters of an equal or greater degree of power,\nor as complex as arranging circumstances in such a way that the characters decide\nto split up into internally consistent specialty groups.\nSCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE\nCOPE AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND S S S S SCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nWhether they are character-generated or Storyteller-generated, plots must fit\nthe chronicle that you are creating. Based on the earlier decisions you made when\nsetting up the chronicle, you should have some idea of how grandiose you want your\nsetting to be. Depending on your decisions, your chronicle will be one of three sizes.\nUsually, chronicles will start at the local scale and progress to the mixed scale, where\nthey tend to stay. World-spanning chronicles are comparatively rare due to the\nheavy plot involvement that is required of the Storytellers, but they are not so very\ndifficult if you give yourself plenty of time to prepare them.\nLOCAL\nOCAL\nOCAL\nOCAL\nOCAL S S S S SCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nBest suited for smaller player groups, the plot and world background of this\nchronicle centers around the immediate political landscape. Plots involve local\nproblems created by local threats. The antagonists, while possibly tied to world-\nspanning organizations (such as a nomadic Sabbat pack that operates out of the\nbarrens or a wandering collection of Banes that has drifted into the nearby Umbra)\n\n\n106\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nwill not rely on their connections to those organizations. Individual motivations are\nespecially important to both the antagonists and the protagonists, and the charac-\nters’ goals will be personal on almost every level.\nEven at this basic scale, however, plots can be complex and have long-lasting\neffects. A plot in which the leadership of the local sphere of influence changes can\nchange the entire dynamic of the chronicle. Member chronicles in a network tend\nto tell stories of this scale, however, no member chronicle is an island.\nMIXED\nIXED\nIXED\nIXED\nIXED S S S S SCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nWhen plots reach this scale, some elements of the local setting have begun\ninteracting with elements of the greater community to which they belong. Examples\ninclude the local vampire prince who has achieved sufficient power and respect to\ninfluence neighboring cities and states, or the wise Theurge of the Garou who now\naccepts students and questing tribemates from nearby septs. Plots of this scale tend\nto affect the heads of the society in question first then trickle down to smaller movers\non the local scene.\nThis scale is a very comfortable level for both players and Storytellers, since it\nprovides the variety of a connection to non-local events while retaining the focus\non local events that the previous level of involvement had. It is important, however,\nto ensure that the stories of this scope that you tell are entertaining for all players.\nDue to the monopolization of societal connections by more experienced players,\nnew players or lower point players may feel left out of the equation. To keep as many\npeople as possible busy in a mixed-scale plot, make sure that the larger events in the\nstory have a definite and immediate impact on the local scene.\nWORLD\nORLD\nORLD\nORLD\nORLD- S\n- S\n- S\n- S\n- SPANNING\nPANNING\nPANNING\nPANNING\nPANNING S S S S SCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nCALE\nGenerally speaking, world-spanning settings are rare in live-action gaming, and\nthey are difficult to construct. One method of creating a world-spanning plot requires\nthat your player’s characters and your Storyteller characters possess sufficient political\nand personal power to make them the center of the culture of which they are a part.\nFor this level of scale to serve as an ongoing chronicle, you must also see that you have\na sufficient reason for such powerful characters to be massed in one area. Resist the urge,\nhowever, to trot out the All-Consuming End of the World Threat. Saving the world\nonce makes for a fine and fulfilling story; having to save the world time and again will\neventually bore your players and make you feel like a scriptwriter for Dragon Ball Z.\nAn easier way to create a world-spanning plot is to drop a key element of that plot\ninto your chronicle and make clear the chain of events that will result when your\nplayers’ characters resolve that part of the plot. The scope of the action of your plot\nremains local, but the ramifications of your characters’ actions resound throughout the\nWorld of Darkness. Similarly, you can use the outcome of an individual chronicle’s\nlocal plot as the genesis for a broader chain of events throughout a chronicle network.\nLike knocking over dominoes, one chronicle’s actions will affect its neighboring\nchronicles, and their reactions will affect still more neighboring chronicles until the\nentire network feels the effects of what was originally a local story.\nWORKING\nORKING\nORKING\nORKING\nORKING W\n W\n W\n W\n WITH\nITH\nITH\nITH\nITH T T T T THEME\nHEME\nHEME\nHEME\nHEME AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND M\n M\n M\n M\n MOOD\nOOD\nOOD\nOOD\nOOD\nBefore you can scout out potential players, create characters, construct plots or\ndetermine the breadth of your version of the World of Darkness, you should\ndetermine what sort of theme and mood you want your chronicle to uphold. Theme\nand mood considerations affect all aspects of your chronicle. Deciding on a mood will\n\n\n107\nPlots\nPlots\nhelp you create advertising materials (should you be planning an open-access game),\ndetermine what sites are best suited for your game, decorate the play areas and figure\nout what day and time you will be running the event. An understanding of the\nchronicle’s theme helps players create characters that will flourish in your game and\navoid types that will fail. Storytellers and Narrators will build plots and characters\nbased on these considerations, and the success of your story can be judged based on\nhow well it has stayed true to the theme and upheld its mood.\nBooks, magazine articles, plays or movies you’ve enjoyed can all provide ideas for you\nto choose from. They need not even be supernatural in nature. The air of scholarly intrigue\nand whodunit mystery in Umberto Eco’s The Name of the Rose would suit a number of\nfactions in the World of Darkness perfectly, ranging from the vampires of Clan Tremere\nin Vampire: The Masquerade to the enlightened wizards of the Order of Hermes or\nCelestial Chorus in Mage: The Ascension. Also, don’t be afraid that you’ll ruin a perfectly\ngood theme by pulling it out of its original context and applying it to a modern story. A good\ntheme appeals to something central in the human mindset, and it can be recast in any\nnumber of settings and genres. A good example of how a theme (or even just a good story)\ncan last the ages would be Akira Kurosawa’s The Seven Samurai, which subsequently was\nadapted in the United States as The Magnificent Seven. Despite major changes in setting and\ntime period (not to mention language), the theme still shone through.\nThe best place to start in your review is your potential player base. You could\nchoose a theme because it seems interesting to you, but will this same theme appeal\nto those people you would like to see playing the game? For example, a player base\nthat is young, immature or new to MET might not appreciate (or even recognize)\na particularly subtle or complex theme. Such players might also have trouble\nseparating their appreciation for a well-constructed mood from the way they actually\nfeel when they are exposed to it. Creating a perfect mood of morbid despair with a\nstory is an impressive feat, for example, but your work won’t be worth anything if the\nplayers are too depressed by your chronicle to come back for more. As players grow\nin experience and artistic taste (should you even want them to), you can vary your\nchoice of theme and use more subtle means of evoking dramatic mood. Otherwise,\nkeep your theme basic and rely on direct action to get your mood across.\nWhen considering which genre of Mind’s Eye Theatre game to play, don’t be afraid\nto play against type in support of your theme and mood. While the core setting of a game\nmay present certain facts as gospel, you do not necessarily have to transfer these ‘facts’\nfaithfully. Rather than the standard themes of redemption or freedom that Masquerade\ngames are heir to, consider the theme of honor. What would the honorable action be\nshould a Camarilla neonate receive direct proof that the Sabbat sect is telling the truth and\nthat the Camarilla really is the tool of the eldest vampires? Playing with setting\nconventions thus is an excellent way to give existing settings great new twists, and it will\ngo a long way toward increasing excitement and interest in your chronicle.\nThe final consideration when choosing themes and moods for your chronicle\nis your logistical base. In other words, are the themes and moods that you are\nconsidering ones that can be supported by your available site and the time you will\nbe able to devote to the game? If your potential play site is a series of unfurnished\nbasement rooms, trying to evoke the regal grandeur of Renaissance Europe will\nprobably not be successful. On the other hand, if your play site is out in the middle\nof nowhere and well beneath the notice of overeager societal watchdogs, it will be\neasier to explore the theme of the consequences of growing decadent. Your site will\nencourage images in the mind of your players, and these images will determine what\nthey will bring both to their characters and to exploration of the theme and mood.\n\n\n108\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nCHANGING\nHANGING\nHANGING\nHANGING\nHANGING T T T T THEMES\nHEMES\nHEMES\nHEMES\nHEMES AND\nAND\nAND\nAND\nAND M\n M\n M\n M\n MOODS\nOODS\nOODS\nOODS\nOODS\nEven the greatest stories change direction now and then, and your chronicle\nwill be no different. The important thing to keep in mind is that themes and moods\ncan change for both good and bad reasons. It is your job as a Storyteller to\ndifferentiate between the two.\nThese changes occur for a variety of reasons, the most common of which derive\nfrom your player base. The characters in your chronicle are going to run with any\ntheme that is central to their existence, and they will eventually exhaust the central\ntheme. At this point, they will either explore related elements of different themes,\nmeld the existing theme with a new one or abandon the old theme entirely in favor\nof a completely new one. When these things happen, consider these points as a\nmeasure of the value of the change:\nIs the change player-driven or character-driven?\nA very fine line exists between these two forces, despite the fact that they both\noriginate from the same place. Character-driven change can best be described as\ndevelopment or deviation from a what you (the Storyteller) had in mind, which is\ndue to the dictates of what a player has defined as his character’s motivations. This\nsort of change in your theme is usually for the best, since it means that your chronicle\nis supporting the sort of in-depth character development that is always enjoyable.\nPlayer-driven change results when players make adjustments to their style or\nthe portrayal of their character for purely out-of-game reasons. This type of change\ncan involve either a desire to try something different or reflect a desire for an out-\nof-game result, such as playing with a different subsection of the player base. The\neffect of this kind of change on the theme and mood will usually be more abrupt and\ndirect than a character-based change, since it usually involves a fundamental\nretooling of the current character’s goals and values. This type of change is less\ndesirable than one that derives from in-game changes in the characters’ lives.\nHowever, it may also indicate that your players are not happy with the way you are\nrunning the chronicle and that they’d have more fun doing something else.\nIs the change due to dissatisfaction with the theme?\nIf your theme is changing due to player dissatisfaction with the current theme, there\nis usually very little that you can do directly or forcibly to prevent that change. If it\nhappens, talk with your players. Are they generally dissatisfied (i.e., totally sick of the way\nthings are going)? If so, work with them to develop a theme and/ or mood that they will\nenjoy playing and that you will enjoy supporting. You shouldn’t force your players to\nsuffer through a game that they don’t like, but you shouldn’t sacrifice the artistic\nsensibility with which you create your stories just because they aren’t immediate hits.\nRemember, any MET chronicle is founded on a guiding principle: People are\ncoming together to tell great stories and have a great time doing it. Getting upset\nwith each other defeats the purpose. When players and Storytellers are contentious\nwith each other out of game, the chronicle involved is in a great deal of trouble.\nSTANDARD\nTANDARD\nTANDARD\nTANDARD\nTANDARD R R R R ROLES\nOLES\nOLES\nOLES\nOLES\nThe single most important aspect of any story is the collection of characters who\npopulate it. Actions that will take place in a story and themes that will come out during\nthe telling of the tale are all well and good, but they are useless without characters to\ncarry out those actions or display those themes. As such, most of the Mind’s Eye\nTheatre material that has been published to date revolves solely around characters and\n\n\n109\nPlots\nPlots\nthe players who portray them. One could even argue that populating a large live-action\ngame with good characters is more important than making up good plots, since those\ncharacters will end up creating stories just by virtue of being themselves. For the most\npart, character quality is not even the Storyteller’s concern once the game is underway.\nThe way in which the character element of a story does concern the Storyteller,\nthough, lies in the overarching purpose that certain types of characters serve.\nIf you have had previous experience in constructing or running a small-scale\nlive-action roleplaying game, then you will already know that certain types of\ncharacters appear time and again in manifold variety. Certain types of characters are\npractically essential in a large chronicle that is just beginning. Should your players\nnot provide them, you may even need to supply these types of characters yourself in\nthe form of Narrator or Storyteller characters. Having these character archetypes in\na chronicle gives you a set of basic starting points on which to hang your plots.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E A A A A AUTHORITY\nUTHORITY\nUTHORITY\nUTHORITY\nUTHORITY\nThis character will either be the total authority of the setting (e.g., a city’s\nprince or the leader of the Garou sept), or he can be the point man and liaison for\nthe authority group (such as a representative for the Council of Nine or a visiting\nAnacreon). Regardless of his actual title or his personal power, this character\nrepresents the accepted laws and customs of the group around which your chronicle\nis centered. This is not to imply, however, that this character’s power must be great\nand terrible. Weak authority characters are perfect for a chronicle centered on a\ntheme of chaos, war or millennial disruptions.\nMany chronicles will begin with a Storyteller character in this role, but the role\nwill usually pass on to a player’s character over time, either through Storyteller\ndesign or through player action. You will likely find that your players will prefer to\nhave a one of their own in this role after a few games, since they will enjoy being able\nto support or defend a fellow player.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E O\n O O\n O\n OPPOSITION\nPPOSITION\nPPOSITION\nPPOSITION\nPPOSITION\nThe direct opposite of the authority archetype, the character who upholds the\nopposition archetype does not necessarily have to be a violent anarchist. Rather, this\nrole is intended to provide a wrinkle in the social order, one that creates questions and\nissues for the characters to deal with without plunging the setting into revolt. Unlike\nan antagonist, the opposition character is accepted on some level by the society of the\nplayer group. Opposition characters include disillusioned neonates, Hollow Ones and\nRagabash Garou. Their presence is intended to raise objections, not revolutionary\narmies. In other words, characters of the opposition tend to approve of the general\nstatus quo, but they object to the specific characters in charge of it.\nStorytellers or Narrators can portray opposition characters, but you should\nencourage the players to assume these roles. Generally speaking, players make more\nconvincing members of the opposition, since their separation from the Storyteller\ncommunity makes their arguments more convincing. Furthermore, some players\nreally enjoy playing members of the community whose quirks or philosophical\ndifferences make them stand out.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E A A A A ANTAGONIST\nNTAGONIST\nNTAGONIST\nNTAGONIST\nNTAGONIST\nEvery chronicle is going to have a need for conflict, and the outside threat posed\nby the antagonist character is the most common source of conflict in a roleplaying\nsetting. The antagonist is a threat to the social order, someone or something that\nwishes to destroy the status quo rather than tinker with it and make it better.\n\n\n110\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nAntagonists are considered anathema by the established society, and characters who\njoin the ranks of the antagonist will no longer be accepted by the society (unlike\npersons allied with the opposition).\nRegardless of whether your chronicle is new or ongoing, your players cannot portray\nantagonist characters. Why? By the strictest definition of the word, each player’s\ncharacter represents a protagonist in your chronicle. That is, he pursues goals and endures\nconflict based on his own motivations. In effect, every character is the main character.\nTherefore, the antagonist archetype represents the characters that you (as a Storyteller)\nput in the players’ characters’ way to prevent them from achieving their goals. As games\nget larger and more characters get involved in your stories, the players themselves take\non the roles of antagonists as their characters come into conflict in the course of play.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E M\n M\n M\n M\n MERCHANT\nERCHANT\nERCHANT\nERCHANT\nERCHANT\nWhen large numbers of supernatural creatures group together, a desire will arise\nfor things, and the merchant character fills that need. Merchant characters are dealers\nin anything in which another character or group of characters has expressed an\ninterest. The desired things need not be physical items, although physical items such\nas weapons, armor, cell-phones, computers, limousines and meeting areas are often the\nmost desired items. The merchant most often supplies the information needs of the\ncommunity as well, either openly or in secret. Regardless of the manner in which they\ndo business, merchants will always receive payment, either in hard goods or favors.\nThe merchant role is excellent for players’ characters, due to the networking\neffect that their interactions with other players cause. Merchants create relationships\nbetween disparate groups. In a starting game, merchant characters will need some\nstarting support from the Storytellers, since they will not be able to enter game with\nthe backing necessary to set up shop otherwise.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E S S S S SOCIALITE\nOCIALITE\nOCIALITE\nOCIALITE\nOCIALITE\nPlayers who enjoy the role of the socialite are interested in the subtle interac-\ntions that occur in structured social environments, and their numbers are many.\nAs in the case of the merchant role, the socialite archetype is a role best suited for\nplayers’ characters. Unlike the merchant, however, Storyteller characters can work\nwell with players’ characters in this regard. The socialite’s player will probably want to\nwork with you on the decoration of your play site, since atmosphere is one of the great\naids for this character’s role. Working closely with the socialite’s player pays dividends,\nin that you can get a good feel for how the players are enjoying the chronicle.\nTH E\nH E\nH E\nH E\nH E M\n M\n M\n M\n MYSTIC\nYSTIC\nYSTIC\nYSTIC\nYSTIC\nMany plot and background story elements in an MET setting have occult or arcane\ntrappings, and the mystic role is best equipped to deal with them. Depending on which\nMET game system you have selected, mystic characters can either be comparatively rare\nor very widespread, such as they are in the Mage: The Ascension setting.\nMystics can either be Storyteller- or player-filled roles, as they will rarely take\na lead position in the plot. Advising the players as a Storyteller, however, should be\nhandled carefully. Your mystic should not have all the answers, but only those that\nwill point the players in the right direction.\nARCHETYPE\nRCHETYPE\nRCHETYPE\nRCHETYPE\nRCHETYPE T T T T TRENDS\nRENDS\nRENDS\nRENDS\nRENDS\nOne of the best ways to judge your game’s health is to check the status of the\nvarious archetypal roles. Reviewing the status of the roles can take many forms,\nincluding asking for comments in downtimes, watching what plot actions the players\n\n\n111\nPlots\nPlots\ntake, and just asking players whether they’re having fun in a certain archetypal role.\nThe roles we’ve talked about are not set in stone, and they will fluctuate as players\ntry new things. As such, the temporary absence of a certain role from your game does\nnot necessarily indicate that disaster looms. However, should absences of a certain\ncharacter type develop, you might find it difficult to create certain types of plot. For\ninstance, you can’t very well tell a story about an internal play for power if you have\nno opposition characters. You can’t engender in your characters deep soul-searching\nabout the ethics of their way of life if your chronicle has no antagonist characters to\nprovide conflict.\nShould you find that your game lacks important archetypal characters and your\nplayers don’t seem willing to take up the slack, you may want to consider inserting\na Storyteller or Narrator character into the mix. Once this character (or characters)\nhas become a recognizable fixture, you can use him to help tell the story that his\nabsence precluded.\nShould you be unable to fill the archetypal gap, asking yourself the following\nquestions about the situation will help immensely:\nIs the character climate of the chronicle to blame?\nHaving the right mix of characters is necessary for certain roles to succeed. When\ntoo many players have chosen to play a particular type of character, the utility of other\ntypes of characters will suffer. A socialite’s love of conversation and low-tension-level\ncharacter interaction will suffer in climates in which the vast majority of players are\nportraying either violent characters (such as certain versions of the opposition role) or\ncharacters who are cerebral but not talkative or sociable (such as the mystic archetype).\nSocialites who lack people with whom to socialize become bored, and roleplaying suffers.\nThey may even add to the problem by jumping ship to the same faction that is already\noverpopulated, just for the sake of interacting regularly with others.\nIt is possible that the problem will solve itself, as players move on to different\nroles and the different roles become repopulated. Should this not happen, though,\nyou should encourage players gently to diversify their roles, either through develop-\nment of existing characters or by taking on new roles. Furthermore, you may want\nto change you current plots or add new plots in order to encourage a return to a more\nbalanced atmosphere. The arrival of Storyteller or Narrator characters who have a\nsocial emphasis can restart the atmosphere that a socialite thrives in and possibly\nturn some of the attention of the players to the societal aspects of the game.\nIs your plot encouraging an unfriendly atmosphere?\nWhen the antagonist is running around with a gun in one hand and a torch in\nthe other, very few characters are going to have time to interact with the socialite.\nYour ability to set the climate of the chronicle is a powerful tool for solving\nimbalance in roles, but it very often can be the cause of that imbalance. Review what\nyou hope to accomplish with the plot, and change those elements that can be\nchanged to encourage a more balanced game.\nKNOWING\nNOWING\nNOWING\nNOWING\nNOWING W\n W\n W\n W\n WHEN\nHEN\nHEN\nHEN\nHEN T O\nT O\nT O\nT O\nT O S S S S SA Y\nA Y\nA Y\nA Y\nA Y W\n W\n W\n W\n WHEN\nHEN\nHEN\nHEN\nHEN: S\n: S\n: S\n: S\n: STOPPING\nTOPPING\nTOPPING\nTOPPING\nTOPPING A A A A ARCHETYPE\nRCHETYPE\nRCHETYPE\nRCHETYPE\nRCHETYPE T T T T TRENDS\nRENDS\nRENDS\nRENDS\nRENDS\nAll of the role types presented here have the potential for going over the line.\nThe desire for a character to seek total success in a role (i.e., to look for a way to\n“win”) is a threat that you should watch out for constantly. If unchecked, that\ndesire can create chronicles in which only one or two types of characters are really\nviable. Don’t be afraid to encourage the rise of other archetypal characters through\nthe use of Storyteller and Narrator characters as well as direct (though even-\nhanded) plot intervention.\n\n\n112\nDark Epics\nDark Epics\nCHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER\nHARACTER P P P P PLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nLOT VERSUS\nVERSUS\nVERSUS\nVERSUS\nVERSUS S S S S STORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER\nTORYTELLER P P P P PLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nLOT\nPlot is the lifeblood of your game. Luckily for you, however, Storytellers are not\nthe only providers of plot. Assuming that you have quality players in your game, you\ncan rely on them to furnish you with characters whose motivations and backgrounds\nwill either provide elements for you to work with or which are fully formed plots in\nand of themselves. However, you are not relieved of the responsibility to create a\nworld of plot for your players to interact with. After all, Storyteller plots and\ncharacter plots fulfill very different goals.\nCharacter plot and background material provides a way for a self-directed player\nto keep herself entertained over the course of several games. As such, the elements\nof these plots are self-centered. Character plots are imminently fulfilling for the\nplayer or players who created them, but they tend to lose appeal the further they grow\nfrom the characters who set them into motion. Storytellers should endeavor to tie\nthese plots into the main plot line of the game as soon as possible.\nThe characteristics of great Storyteller-generated plots are mirror images of the\ncharacteristics of character-created plots. Trying to visit a huge, world-spanning plot\nupon a small group of characters is not the way to go. Start small, with a few minor\nhints to a broad group of players. Throwing your net wide will ensure that the\nmaximum section of your game will be involved and entertained. Grow your plot\nslowly, attaching appropriate character plots to the body of your plot. Eventually,\nyou will have created a plot in which many disparate characters are involved each\nfor their own reasons with varying levels of investment at stake. Once the characters\nare motivated thus, the players will have all the more reason to roleplay and work\ntogether against the obstacles in their characters’ way.\nRESOLUTION\nESOLUTION\nESOLUTION\nESOLUTION\nESOLUTION\nAt some point, the character’s struggle to achieve his goal has to end one way\nor another. No player will wait in line indefinitely to see if his characters’ schemes\nwill ever come to fruition, and no story is truly satisfying unless it concludes. The\nsame is true even in a long-running chronicle that you hope will still have years of\nlife left in it. Players may come to live-action games simply to be characters, but\ncharacters get involved in stories in order to achieve something.\nAs a Storyteller, you must make sure that every story arc you create has some\nway to play itself out. You need not feel inclined to make sure that the players’\ncharacters always get what they want, but you must see that the struggle to get it\ncomes to a close. However, as in any novel or motion picture, a live-action story’s\nresolution must always leave room for a follow-up tale. If you can, try to end every\nstory with a question that makes the characters want to know or find out more.\nAnswer the lingering questions that arose during the story arc itself, but leave\nenough clues for the characters to realize that a whole new set of questions awaits.\nKeep your players on the hook, and they’ll keep coming back to play in your game.\n"
